The taste compensates with a big flavor, hoppy up front,  slightly bitter on the finish that sticks around. A nice medium body, the mouthfeel is not as smooth as it could be, but it still adds a great dimension to the beer. Overall a nice ipa, very enjoyable.","wingman14","Apr 03, 2015"

Weed joke, or actual freshness date, I don't rightly know... but I do know that I can't pick fresh IPAs with a gun to my head. 3 fingers of beige head on a golden body, crystal clear (despite being marketed as unfiltered). Astringent pine on the sinuses, bitterness, and an alarming savory hop note (comes off as a cheese aroma to me, more interesting than off-putting, but definitely from the 'dank/earthy' hop varieties; have gotten the same aromas in Six-Point Hi-Res and a couple of others that escape me at the moment; more of a headscratcher than a deal breaker). Clean bitterness on the front of the palate, bit of that dank hop note on the finish. Average IPA mouthfeel with a couple of slightly odd lingering flavors (yeasty bit). Nothing special in the wide world of IPAs, but I wouldn't refuse a fresh bottle at a BBQ. Wouldn't trade my firstborn for one though.","Mikus","Mar 09, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Outstanding aromas with awesome complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 02, 2015"

Hops on the nose and front of the palate are definitely there, with dominant grapefruit and a bit of sour apple.  The beer's body is where it differs from a typical IPA, though.  The hopping doesn't seem heavy in the boil, leading to a some sweetness after a couple sips.  While the bitterness of many IPAs can get cloying, the balance of a sharp hop nose and sweeter body make this really drinkable.  My wife, who typically tends towards sweeter beers and shies away from bitterness even in food, found the grapefruit element refreshing.  A great beer and really unique.","HeightsEats","Nov 05, 2014"

I understand why this beer was always reguarded as one of the better IPAs in the past. This was something that was ahead of its time at one point. Maybe other breweries have caught up and eclipsed this, but this still holds up as a winner in the world of IPAs. I like it.","BB1313","Oct 17, 2014"

Very nice nose of grapefruit and tropical (mango) with a touch of spice and pine over a very light biscuit. Medium bodied with a normal carbonation level that imparts a bit of effervescence on the finish. Nice balanced flavor profile with a bit of hop complexity in a blended fashion. It begins with the flavors of the nose then flows into a mild bitterness. The finish is dry, not quite crisp, and leaves you with a light grapefruit rind bitterness and a touch of spice.","tillmac62","Aug 08, 2014"

The smell -- grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit! Also subtle hints of mango in there. Really nice. Grapefruit is also the overwhelming quality of the taste. Nice level of carbonation. Really fresh tasting beer. I had one on 8/7 that had a Best Buy date of 8/17 and it felt like I was drinking this right at a brewery. Really solid IPA. For a 6.3% ABV, very easy to drink.","oldirtycaffrey","Aug 08, 2014"

Aromas of rich and sweet caramel, tart citrus fruits (grapefruit and lemon), bitter hops aromas, subtle pine pitch, and subtle spice. Flavors are a well blended blast of grapefruit, resinous piney hops, and a caramel backbone. Cut grass, pine tassels, and hints of evergreen build as you go. Despite all the robust flavors, the body stays light and crisp. A tart, bitter, dry aftertaste loaded with hops characteristics and citrus highlights. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry, as well. Very well put together, drinkable IPA. Bravo!","GarthDanielson","Jun 22, 2014"

At 7% it's really not a session ale for me and doesn't have quite a unique or bold taste for a beer I'd relax with at the end of the day. So, for me, it doesn't have a place in my fridge as a regular resident but it's not a bad choice if you're on the go and looking for something less expensive and yet enjoyable. Probably good for a day in the sun or on the lake when you just don't want a massive IPA.","HopHog87","Apr 16, 2014"

It's a great staple. It's a great blend of both West Coast and East coast IPAs.

The nose seems to have been the muse for Founders All Day IPA, as they are quite similar in base, but with more booze and medicinal bite here. That said, however, the flavoring does cheapen up a bit in the grain profile, causing the hops to come across, themselves, as a bit hollow and skeletonized. This takes the balance off in a direction that we were not too eager to follow, although we were ultimately pleased with the big picture of the beer as a whole. This is a beverage for some fun outdoor activities in the sun, and nobody can argue with how easy it slugs back. This is an excellent beer if you’re all about sippin’ and relaxin’, but if you linger too long and begin to dissect it out, you might find some unwelcomed and simplified layers here and there.","TheBrewo","Mar 22, 2014"

The head is very nearly white, a bit spritzy though it has a thick, creamy texture. Lace is moderate, a thin ring at the top with spotting to follow. Slightly mineral undertones lie beneath perfume and floral bitterness with light fruity esters and breads. Ruby red grapefruit, orange zest, lemon peel, and floral bitterness show a hoppiness not foreseen in the aroma, strong and straightforward with most of the balance coming from a hint of sugared fruits and some bready malts. There's a strong crispness in a medium body with plenty of smoothness running over the tongue and into the finish with a mildly lingering bitterness.","Brenden","Jan 29, 2014"

First, when uncapping the bottle the first thing that hits you is the aroma. There is hop cloud released with citrusy, resiny notes. No doubt dry hopped at a high level and certainly with a Cascade, Simcoe blend. The appearance was good clarity, a deep golden color, little head retention and no noticeable lacing on the way down. On the tongue it starts with a grassy presence, leveling out to a little alcohol tinge and finishing with a lingering grapefruit bitterness. Well balanced and extremely drinkable. One of my top 5 all time AIPA examples. Excellent!!","Hoperator","Dec 10, 2013"

Color was a deep-amber with just the slightest haze (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose had a pine resinous scent that was perfect for post-season baseball. Pine tar and baseball just go together. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops bite was immediate. It was not as much of a kick in the teeth as they might have liked (and I have had those, both literally and figuratively), but this hophead was getting his groove on. The lacing was ongoing and unabating. Finish was semi-dry, very pine-like and a welcome addition to my afternoon.","woodychandler","Oct 06, 2013"

The label says it was dry-hopped, which no-doubt added to the excellent bouquet. This is definitely an IPA that IPA lovers should try. It may not appeal to non hop-heads due to its level of carbonation, but they should give it a shot, too.","BeerDocT","Jul 26, 2013"

Although pretty one dimensional, the fruity character of the nose is really nice. Flavor follows through a bit more malt balanced with some light bitterness, hints of wood and still plenty of fruity sweet mango with a touch of grapefruit pith. Medium on full bodied for the style with a light, fine carbonation and a wet finish. I bet this hits the spot on a hot southern day.","harrymel","Apr 07, 2013"

It pours a hazy orange brown with a two finger head of large bubbles. There are hints of carbonation rising to the top. Nice lacing. Head fades within a couple of minutes. Right from the start you get a combination of sweetness and hops. The hop bite isn't quite as large as other times I've had it, but has a large body to it. Hints of lemon and grapefruit. The finish has more of the hop bite. It has a very refreshing feel to it and should be best enjoyed after a lot of man sweating. Overall a seriously good IPA.","csparace","Mar 27, 2013"

A very nice aroma. Taste is very sweet with just the right amount of bittering for an IPA. Hops taste more floral than the citrusy aroma promised. The finish is long and steady with no odd tangents. Texture is a little sticky. Carbonation is above average - biting. The carbonation gives the beer a refreshing quality. A nice IPA the selection of hops (Columbia for bittering, and Golding for aroma) made this IPA interesting.","chickenflea","Jan 28, 2013"

Clear amber body produces a thin loosely bubbled head that leaves some spider web like lacing. Aroma is pretty one dimensional. Grapefruit hops overpower anything else that might be in this beer. Taste is very grapefruity as well. Although some caramel sweetness and maybe a hint of cracker poke thru. Carbonation is decent but this just feels a little thin and watery for an IPA. Long bone dry finish with more of that dry plain cracker on the finish. Overall this is a good IPA that is easy to drink.

They’re not pulling any punches with this beer, and it does everything an IPA should do without ever coming off as out of whack in any regard: the hops are relatively one-dimensional but solid and not overly harsh, the malt is solid enough but neither too sweet or too toasted, and the hops are always front and center.

Hazy in appearance, there is some very small particles of suspended yeast in it. Smell is floral, pine, and citrus. Taste follows the nose basically. Balance is excellent between sweet and bitter. The taste is not in your face and is one of the weaker tasting IPAs that I've had. But it is a good one and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is nice with a pleasing mild aftertaste. I'd try this one if you never have. Not the best ever, but a nice offering nonetheless.","Mojo","Dec 08, 2012"

Maybe a finger of white foam crowns the beer and hangs around for just a minute or two. Lacing is hard to come by though. The nose is nice, with just a bit of a bready note mostly failing to pull my attention away from the bouquet of tangerine and grapefruit peel wafting out of the glass. The already slight maltiness from the aroma pretty much disappears in the flavor profile. I'm all for a dry, hop forward IPA, but there needs to be at least a little bit of a malt presence to serve as a baseline. The mildly assertive bitterness and potent grapefruit and tangerine citrus finish are all nice, but there's nothing for them to play off of. The body is nice and dry for the style, but the carbonation just lacks energy, and doesn't pop as much as it should. Sweetwater IPA is a decent brew that, with a couple minor tweaks, could be one of the better IPAs brewed on the east coast.","axeman9182","Nov 30, 2012"

It has a good appearance with a half inch head and lacing that hangs around throughout. The nose is a combination of hops and malts that's blended very well. The tongue gives way to hops with a hop/malt backbone. The mouthfeel is moderated with a dry finish. Really like this IPA and will indulge these more. Can't wait to get a growler of this soon.

Very nice brew, really easy drinking, and great southern warm weather beer.","BMMillsy","Mar 22, 2012"

The nose is fruity sweet with citrus hop character. Very appealing. The flavor is more powerful than the nose, a nice blast of citrus fruity sweetness and hop character immediately. Medium bitterness. As the beer warms it becomes more balances with the sweet malt and hops. Lighter end of medium bodied and a bit chewy. Easy to drink and refreshing.

Bottle dated ""Best before 3-02-12", so assuming pretty fresh. Poured from bottle into my Victory tulip. Pours a rich and completely transparent orange color- on the darker side for an IPA. Smell- an interesting hop aroma- blood orange, grapefruit. Taste- a blast of bitterness hits the front of my palate. Waves and waves of bitterness without a real malt backbone. I love IPA's and love a hop forward IPA, but this lacks balance. Its wave upon wave of bitterness without anything sweet to counter. Very medium to light bodied, the mouthfeel is light and airy. This IPA would be better if the malt developed some tropical fruit sweetness, but it's still a decent IPA regardless that I would have again.","lnashsig","Jan 13, 2012"

4.15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The first beer I had after a week of Presidente while in the D.R. and it was so damn refreshing and tasty. The amber color and low carbonation was nice to look at. The aroma was hoppy and a bit woody. The taste had a lot of the hops up front with a touch of citrus followed by a light driness then a sharp flavor decrease. The body is spot on and burps up a good amount of the hops. Little malt present. This is definitely a repeat buy if I go through Atlanta again.","DesMoinesMike","Oct 31, 2011"

It has a good IPA nose with strong piney notes, some vegetal scents and a touch of sweet, caramel maltiness. The taste has a medium bitterness for an IPA, it definitely doesn't overpower the beer. The mouthfeel was slightly thin and the carbonation had lots of small bubbles. Overall, this IPA is not going to blow you out with ultra bitterness or ultra hop aroma but it is eminently quaffable and in this sense the thin mouthfeel and dry finish add to its drinkability.","quirkzoo","Oct 04, 2011"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep copper color with a thick, creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the side of the glass. It has a wonderfully sweet, floral, perfume-like aroma. This floral hop character is well-balanced, however, by an abundant but light malt sweetness. The hop character is a welcome change from the citrus hop flavor that is so prevalent in many of the IPAs on the market. In addition, despite being an IPA, the bitterness is not overwhelming, making this a very easy-drinking.","MayLattimore","Sep 27, 2011"
3.97,0,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger head, decent lacing throughout. Aroma of all citrus hops, simply delicious flavor profile that balances out with malts.

3.67,-7.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"This was quite good for a single IPA but I found it lacking backbone a bit.

Definitely a good six-pack beer but not in my dream team lineup.","Klym","Sep 13, 2011"
3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Visited J. Clydes in Birmingham and was able to due a flight of tap beers and selected Sweetwater IPA as one of five to try. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a white head that settles into a very sticky lace that loves to cling to the sides of the glass. Wonderful IPA aroma of pine oil with some underlying fruity notes. Medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation that does a nice job of offsetting the sticky texture of the beer. Taste begins with some sweet and biscuity malt flavors that soon give way to tart acidic citrus rind and bitter hop resins that remain in a lasting aftertaste. I certainly would recommend any hop head to try it.","WoodBrew","Sep 13, 2011"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow amber color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of grapefruit and lemons mostly. Pine and resin play a role here, but this one is all about the citrus. Malt, yeah I guess there's some in there. If I close my eyes and take a deep breath I can find hints of bread and maybe some hay. Taste is lemon and grapefruity with surprisingly a little bready grainy malt in there as well. Fairly dry finish with a bitter lemony aftertaste. Medium to thin body, moderated level of carbonation with a resinous watery mouthfeel. Decent light IPA that I could see going down quite easily on a hot summer day.","johnnnniee","Aug 23, 2011"

The head hangs around for a while, but doesn't leave any lacing as it subsides and the liquid level lowers. Smells of piney hops, citrus (orange, grapefruit), some floral notes, and some nice hop spice. Taste is a bit weak; hops and citrus up front, a watery middle, and some spice and faint malt on the finish. All of the flavors seem a bit muted, though balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but smooth and crisp; amply carbonated. Overall, a decent IPA that I'm glad to have tried, but there are other readily available offerings I prefer a bit more.","eclipse54","Aug 18, 2011"

4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours cloudy, sappy gold with a really nice white head. The nose on this is very enjoyable. It’s sweet of flowers and honey with pine, tea, and citrus depth. Really tasty brew here, it walks the line of a beefier APA and a more typical IPA. The finish lingers of sweetened green tea and honey with adequate hop bite to deliver refreshing zing. Citrus notes are there, but not as prominant as a piny, foresty character. This is really well done, easily one of the better india pale ales I’ve had from the south.","GeorgeAldi","Aug 10, 2011"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"As far as southeastern IPAs I've had, this is probably one of my favorites. Pours a coppery-orange with a fingers' worth of head….swirling he brew in the glass leaves an ameoba-like ring around the edges. I love the nose on this IPA….some pineapple, orange marmalade, and floral notes abound. The taste closely follows the nose, but there seems to be more of the grapefruit and piney notes and not as much as the sweet citrus flavors. Goes down with a slight bitterness from the hops, but not too overpowering….it also has a pleasant lingering, citrusy aftertaste. Just a solid IPA from one of my favorite southeastern breweries.","NCBeerFan","Aug 08, 2011"

It's great for the reasons I stated above, but if you're looking for a highly complex IPA, this probably isn't your beer.

But really, it is more complex than that. There is a grapefruit undertone from start to finish, which pairs well with a malty sweetness at the start to a big burst of tart grapefruit at the end, and a slight lingering piney aftertaste.

4.61,16.1,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured out a nice looking darkish golden-light amber color into my pint glass. Nice amount of yeast sediment seems to be floating around in this one as well. A fluffy, thick white head immediately formed and left copious amounts of lacing behind after each sip. Beautiful. Smell is of strong pine, grapefruit and citrus. The taste starts out strong with hops, a barrage of pine, oranges, lemons and limes, while a semi-sweet maltiness manages to make it's way onto the palate to mellow out the hoppiness. This beer is mildly carbonated, allowing for your tastebuds to be fully aware of the hop presence, not at all blinding the piney, earthy and natural citrus flavors. You get the strong, crisp bitterness at the end of each sip, while a slick and oily mouthfeel hangs around. Moderate body in this one with a bready and sweet malt presence. Pretty darn good in my opinion, light enough to enjoy more than a few. I'd say the drinkability is higher than most IPA's I've had in the past. Great brew from Sweetwater.","jsdunlop","Jan 12, 2011"

It does not have that lingering sour flavor that makes you wish you could brush your teeth; and you would if you didn't already know how terrible beeramint is.

Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Huge citrus and tropical fruit in the aroma. Malt does not make an appearance. And the malt does not add much to the flavor either. This is a hop showpiece and the brewer evidently did not want any of that pesky malt getting in the way. Just a lot of citrus hops is tasted but bitterness does not get out of hand and is very manageable. I enjoyed the body in this beer.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy burnt golden orange color with a thick, soapy white head. The nose definitely tells the story of an AIPA, thick with citrus notes like orange and grapefruit, resinous piney notes also are present. Upfront the flavor is very malty sweet, hops are almost unnoticeable in bitterness but are definitely present in the preceding flavor components. This IPA is very interesting in that it does have an intense hop nose/flavor but most of it must come from dry hopping because it doesn't have the mouth puckering bitterness you would expect. Very well done indeed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin yet creamy carbonation. Overall an incredibly easy drinking beer due to the excellent hop flavor but subdued yet balanced bitterness.

As it dies down it leaves behind a lot of lace and finally settles into a 1/4 inch foam cap. The aroma is very citrusy with grapefruit, hints of lemon, sweet wildflowers and a slight earthiness. The first impression is that it is quite creamy, medium bodied and actually has more balance to it than I initially expected. Some light malt flavor is intertwined with all the citrusy hop flavors that the aroma prepared me for. The malt is very good, but not what I would expect from the style or the aroma. A great IPA and I have to say that so far this is my favorite Sweet Water beer.","SuperSpy","Aug 30, 2010"

Not super hoppy but hoppy enough to know you are drinking an IPA. Medium mouthfeel. Citurs hop notes.

2.74,-31,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Tasted from 12oz bottle obtained in a trade. Pours clear bright amber orange with a good-sized beige head that has some real retention. Nose is more caramel malt with the hops, citrus, and light yeast taking a back seat. The palate is similar with the caramel and some chocolate malt taking over. The hops kicks in as bitterness on the back of the palate and finish, and there is also some grapefruit citrus. The body is light with heavy carbonation and a decent bitter and chocolate finish. Kind of strange for an IPA.","wedgie9","Aug 22, 2010"

Huge citrus nose, with pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot, with some bitter hops. The taste confirmed the aroma, with a huge citrus flavor, though more balanced with malt at midpalate than expected, and then finished on a sweet pineapple citrus note. Not as overpoweringly sweet on the finish as some other pineapple-flavored ipa's I've had recently. Modestly carbonated, and very smooth and medium-bodied. Very nice, citrus-oriented specimen of the style.","donniecuffs","Aug 03, 2010"

I actually enjoy the sweetness to it, there isn't much bitterness at all. Some fruit is also present in the taste. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good for this.

4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This poured a slightly hazy light copper with some light tan head. It smelled like oranges and grapefruit, with a bit of pineapple and lemon and honey malt. It tasted like fresh grapefruit and orange and lemon, with some sweet pineapple and honey malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a fantastic IPA that I would place just below Blind Pig and/or AleSmith IPA. It had a great clean hops taste with good body. It had just enough malt to keep this easy to drink without the hops being overpowering. I've heard this beer can be temperamental (i.e. must be drunk very fresh), but it's awesome if you get a good bottle.","Pencible","Nov 03, 2009"

Strong aroma with citrus flavors leaping out of the glass and coming through nicely on the palate. Loads of grapefruit and some sweet orange flavors and I almost feel like there's some mango in there as well. It seems a little softer than most IPA's. It's different but nice.

4.2,5.8,4,4,4,4,5,"Opened a week after the freshness date, but still very enjoyable. Pours a deep copper color with a thick, creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the side of the glass. It has a wonderfully sweet, floral, perfume-like aroma that melds with a grapefruit character that is more typical of IPAs on the market. This grapefruit-laden, floral hop character is well-balanced, however, by an abundant but light malt sweetness. In addition, despite being an IPA, the bitterness is not overwhelming, making this a very easy-drinking selection. Two thumbs up.","devilben02","Sep 29, 2009"

3.96,-0.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"The smell is initially that of a tropical and citrus fruit basket. Unfortunately, as the beer nears room temperature it completely falls apart as the grains start to show more. The same thing happens in the taste, however the mango and lemon remain in the flavor and match with a light caramel flavor. The body is full but sort of grainy.

There is a bit of haze and a small bit of hop dust at the bottom. It smells like an overly ripened ruby red grapefruit. The taste is all grapefruit and orange peel. The mix of citrus flavors and light body makes this so easy to consume. It is now my go-to beer for a relaxing evening in the summer. My suggestion to anyone that loves IPAs and ranked this beer below A, is to go out and look for a fresh bottle and try it again. Sweetwater IPA is a baby Sculpin. Similar hop character without the degree of intensity. Absolutely wonderful.","raverjames","Jul 07, 2009"
4.34,9.3,3,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a hazy, brownish-gold, solid layer of foam on top which retains well. Good lacing. Aroma is sticky, citrusy hops. Grapefruit rind, grapefruit juice, and a sweetish malt note in the background, kind of like honey or something. Taste is big time grapefruit, huge hop flavor but very little bitterness. A bit of malt in the background but it is really the hops that take center stage. Overall, the taste and smell are very clean, refined, huge emphasis on the citrus notes. Finishes real smooth, extremely drinkable. This is a very good IPA and a good showcase for citrusy hops.

The aroma is of a citrusy hops and floral notes. The flavor was actually very similar to a Stone Ruination for me but not as harsh. The Hops were very prominant and were a specific hops that are a bit to bitter for me. In the Ruination the beer's hops killed my taste buds quickly but this beer the flavor lasted which I was very happy for. The medium body and alcohol level makes the drinkability pretty good.

Had some other tastes of this brewery's beer and very suprised. If I am ever in atlanta I will seek this place out. Very good beer but this one stood out above the rest.

Taste is out of this world the hop profile is not a palate burner but very subtle. Hints of orange and pine with a bit of a lingering hop bitterness towards the end.

The smell is a nice combination of citrus and strong hops (I realize hops are obvious in an IPA, but I do find some lacking in the aroma, which this certainly does not). Taste includes that strong hops character as well, without being overdone, which also can be the case with these ""West Coast"" style IPAs. A crisp, but not too bitter mouthfeel adds to what I feel is a very drinkable IPA.

Taste is just an all-out citrus riot....grapefruit, tangerine, clementine, slightly bitter grassy element here...you could argue that the taste is a little one-dimensional, with the huge grapefruit/citrus presence, but it's just plain tasty.

The color is golden amber, with a nice whitish head and good lacing. On the palate, this is a superb beer.

Hops turn creamy on the back of the tongue as you continue to drink. Malt balance is really there also. Bitter does develop on the mouthfeel but it is pleasant.

The flavors were equally bold as though the beer has been dry-hopped during brewing. Sharp and tart, hops, citrus, honey and malt to balance. Well thought out and quite drinkable.

I think that the lack of head had more to do with the pour than the beer, but not the fact that it did not last. The aroma was a heavy floral but the hops squarely in the background and not as pronounced as I would have thought. The taste was OK, but it really followed the aroma, heavy on the floral with a hint of hops. The beer had good carbonation and it left you with a nice bitter aftertaste.

3.56,-10.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a somewhat hazy dark copper hue with a generous two finger off-white head that slowly falls leaving a thick layer of webbing on the sides of the glass. Smell is oily slick hops with some floral notes. A fair amount of caramel malt and earthy hops as well. I could use more citrus sweetness in the nose. Taste begins with a smooth caramel malt followed by over ripe grapefruit and gritty hops. Cane sugar and buttered biscuits with a dirty hop aftertaste. Creamy medium body with slick feel. Mild carbonation on the tongue. The label proclaims it to be a ""mammoth IPA"". Maybe, but it's mammoth on the malty side for the style. I like my IPA's with a good amount of citrus hops, so I can't say this is a favorite of mine. Solid IPA, worth a shot.","BeerTruth","May 10, 2008"
4.27,7.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Just a damned good beer. It not heavy, or is it too sticky. It doesn't wear on you like over hopped west coasters tend to. This is not a west coast hop bomb, and I am not trying to sell it as one. What it is is an easy drinking IPA with fantastic, big time flavors and aromas. Its not going to wreck you with bitterness or dryness but it has those qualities. This is a beer that needs the respect it deserves. Fine crafted IPA that is certainly a diamond in the rough of Southern offerings.","everetends","May 09, 2008"

Grapefruit is the main culprit and a sugary sweet malt is also present. About as great as it gets, with hops winning but malts providing a solid backbone that keeps it in place.

Great body and high quaffability, for sure. It could be a little bit more crisp, as some others have said, but this is very, very well balanced.

4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice dark amber with some orange highlights. Decent initial head fades to a ring pretty quickly but leaves some okay lacing. The smell is of faintly bitter hops, apricots, and just a touch of that meatiness you find sometimes with Simcoe hops. Nice. More apricot up front in the taste, but this fades to a more conventional hop bitterness with some citrus and pine. There is a nice malty backbone, but the hops are definitely have the upper hand. Deep bitter aftertaste, and I don't get any of the meatiness I caught in the aroma. Really nice session ipa. This one makes it easy to support the local brewery. Crisp mouthfeel and medium body. refreshing and drinkable. It's 93 degrees and sunny right now- this one quenches my thirst and gives me a nice hop hit at the same time.

I can't quite place the aroma but it is primarily grapefruit, but a much more bitter grapefruit than normal.

Smells like grapefruit and pine resin. I must admit, I have to be in the mood for this kind of beer, and it just so happens that right now, I am! The taste is wonderfully bitter and pine like, and while I know that they must be there, I cannot really detect any malt; Just pure pine sap and grapefruit.

4.22,6.3,4.5,5,4,3.5,4,"This beer is certainly not what I have come to think of as a traditional IPA. It was gold to amber in color (lighter than expected) and was very effervescent. Overall, quite an attractive appearance. The nose was surprising also. The most prominently projected aromas here are of peach and apricot and a little of noble hops. The taste is a bit light on the malt for my taste, but is still pretty flavorful. The hops domiate the palate, as expected. I could certainly drink a few of these on a hot summer evening. Outstanding beer.","BRoberts914","Jun 14, 2006"

Sweet fore tastes a bit of orange/lemon spiked cake, slightly toasty with a firm malty feel. Hops are fairly low in bitterness and an excellent compliment to the fruity malt base.

Candied orange zest was definitely used in this beer, I just know it. The beer has a solid bitterness to it that starts up front and becomes more noticeable as it finally has a strangle hold on the long, lingeringly bitter finish. The hop character creates a bit of a tingling tongue sensation, much like carbonation does, and it is accompanied by an herbaceous hop character that is quite nice as well. This beer is fairly light and drinkable, of course I mean that it has a medium fullness to eat that is not so much that I couldn't see drinking a couple pints of this quaffable IPA.","Gueuzedude","Mar 07, 2006"

Poured a deep orange into my pint glass with a nice 2 finger head which dissipated rather quickly leaving some nice lacing. Smell is malty sweet at first then the hops come in and take over the sweetness. Taste is initially bubblegum sweet then the hops take over, but not with the authority of a good IPA such as Stone or Hop Ottin. The label claims this is the beer I have been training for, but I'm not feelin it. This may be a step up for a macro beer drinker, but in my opinion it is a decent Pale Ale that is easy drinking but not much more than that.","imblane","Oct 22, 2005"

Pours an easy two finger very light yellow head over a rather cloudy apricot orange liquid. Smells oranges and tangerines, some grapefruit pith beneath, and just a wisp of pine sol. It's got a real sugary sweet smell, like rock candy. Tastes citrus hoppy with a little bit of a sour hop twang at the end. The draw is grapefruit pith, orange oil and honey in the mouth, and then ""pine sol"" at the end. I think the ""Pine sol"" is actually a combination of a pine hop character mixed with rough grassy co-humulone, topped with some acrid on the tongue from a bit too much carbonation. Not much in the way of fruity esters. Perhaps some mango as the beer warms. Md body and md-heavily carbonation. The flavor grew on me as I drank it and as it warmed.","mentor","Aug 19, 2005"

Picked up a sixer while in Boone and had to ration myself when I find out how far I was going to be from refreshing my empty beer cooler.

4.12,3.8,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This beer takes on a nice golden straw color with a slight orange hue. Head was rather small and disappeared quickly. Aroma is quite strong and runs rampant with juicy hops. Aroma is characterized by a blend of grapefruit and a touch of tangerine. Taste is slightly different than the smell and is a nice crisp blend of citrus, pine and resin flavors. Initially the juicy citrus and pine show through but the finish is of resin. Mouthfeel is average in heaviness for an IPA. Flavors linger for a short while, a little too short. Drinkability is awesome for this beer. The intense aroma and nice taste make this beer my usual session beer of choice (it doesnt hurt that I can get it locally and fairly cheap).","blitz134","Jan 19, 2005"

Substantial body holds a palate of slightly sweet malt up front, with notes of honey and fresh ale yeast. Towards the back of the mouth the hops come out with a vengeance. Very assertive and bitter hoppy aftertaste hangs around for quite some time. While not as ""monstrous"" as the bottle advertises, it's a great beer nonetheless.

Balance is totally great on that aroma, soapy woodiness somehow.. yum yum. Once again though in this IPA tasting, I still am not able to identify so many flavours in this, its certainly nicely floral and presents a firm sandy/bushy bitterness, but the body is certainly a bit too bubbly, lively biting. So this is obviously in the better half of the American IPAs, but once again, it so dries out on your tongue that it leaves you the impression that youre missing a lot.","Rastacouere","Nov 08, 2004"

Taste brings out a nice spicy hop bitterness at first, more piney than citrus, then transitions into a huge chewy center. Lots of sweet and caramel malt flavor through the middle, maybe even a bit creamy. Body is a little more than medium, I could definitely drink a couple of these but more than that might get a bit sweet. Finish leaves a lingering bitterness more appropriate to the IPA style.

Beautiful chunks of foamy lace are left cling to the glass that seem to cling on for dear lift as they stay in place throughout the beers life. Glorious citrus hops jump through your nose when first sampling the aroma. Quickly the hop scent dies down to let the sweet caramel malt profile take center stage. Hmmmm the first thing that comes to mind when I took a sip was balance that seems to be the game here. The sweet caramel malt play at the front of my tongue while the bitter hops take residence in the back balancing each other out one for one it seems. I would expect more hop presence in an IPA than this; it seems at times malt is in the starring role. Mouthfeel is great medium body with creaminess written all over it. Drinkability is good too as this went down very quickly and I would have had a few more if I had them. Overall the only knock on this baby is the taste and smell, which needed a bit more hops for what I want in an IPA. Besides that the brew still tastes great and is something you should give a shot if you come across it. Many thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle.","meathookjones","Aug 20, 2004"

Muted base of pale malt lends some sweetness, but is outdone completely by the hopping. Moderately bitter with flavors of citrus & pine - great use of hops here, this is delicious stuff.

Lovely nose with ample potency and plenty of hops complexities grapefruit, citrus rinds, sharp acidicness, and very distant malt. Exceedingly inviting! The first sip is ass-kicking hops dry and leafy yet acidic and citrusy the bitterness is assertive (and tasty)! The malt backbone is solid; the complexities added to the flavor profile are subtle but important yeast influences are noticeable towards the end, it has a softening effect, which is overpowered by the dry, bitter, grapefruit rinds. Very tasty! It is balanced enough definitely leans heavily on the hoppy side. The body is very solid, perfect carbonation great mouthfeel, almost dead-on for what I want in an IPA. Great aftertaste that does not allow your brain to forget how damn tasty it was. Yummy its on par with many of the absolute great IPAs. Recommended.","bditty187","Jul 31, 2003"
4.45,12.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A slightly hazy (unfiltered), very deep amber-orange body reveals wide golden highlights when held to the light; and it's creamy off-white head slowly drops to a good-sized collar and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The aroma is bold with brightly floral, sweetly citrusy, and softly piney hops over a sweetish malt. Very nice!!! The same hoppiness appears in the flavor (it's loaded with grapefruit!), tempered a bit by the fuller sweetness of the gently biscuity and softly caramelized malt; and accentuated by a delicate, fruity contribution from the yeast. It's bitterness is firm, but never steps ahead of the rich maltiness; and only makes it's full strength known in the dry finish and long-lingering aftertaste. It's rich, and the medium-full body and very fine, moderate carbonation serves to accentuate that. I'd almost like to try this beer a little bit crisper (with the thought that that would add to it's drinkability), but I like it so much as it is that I feel that might be a fool's errand. Quite nice! Brewed with a firm but delicate hand. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Jul 28, 2003"
3.33,-16.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Beautiful looking amber/orange and cloudy with significant sediment. Thick head which is settling down rapidly. Looks similar to Bells Two Hearted. Fat piney hop aroma. Crisp with a medium body and a bitter slightly dry finish. Not an outstanding brew but definately worth a try. I accidentily poured thesediment in my glass and I'll re-rate on next one without sediment.","BierReise","Jul 18, 2003"
3.84,-3.3,3,4,4,3,4,"Originally sampled on 5 November 2002. Thanks to aracauna for this beauty. Poured a cloudy orange color w/ a foamy white head. A nice citrus/hoppy nose w/ a nice bite. Definitely a must-try for the IPA afficionado. This, in my opinion, is a very nice IPA.","jcalabre","Jun 13, 2003"

4.02,1.3,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Light amber hue, animated by fervent carbonation. Thick, rutted off white head leaves rough lace. The aroma is dominated by pungently dry hopped, juicy grapefruit and spruce laced Cascades. As the hop oils dissipate, softer, light caramel malt surfaces and partially offsets, lending a sweeter, orangey citrus character. Quinessential, hop driven American IPA hop nose. The flavor is a more placid, balanced extension of the aroma. Mild, dextrin malt sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by citrus hop notes with hints of peach. Moderate hop bitterness emerges mid palate and complements the underlying, token residual and caramel malt derived sweetness. Somewhat understated, but functional malt character. Hint of buttery malt late merges with the citrus hop presence leaving a lightly sweetened orange Julius impression late. Medium bodied, with the well calculated attenuation facilitating an agreeably smooth, dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bitter and mildly bready. A well balanced, flavorful IPA, that falls a bit short on the aroma's promise. Nonethless highly drinkable and satiatingly hopped. Very tasty.","marc77","May 02, 2003"
3.77,-5,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This IPA poured a very VERY cloudy yellow but did have a fine white head that lasted long and provided a lot of lace on the glass. The aroma was hoppy but not overly so. The taste of citrus was quite present but did not dominate the taste as many IPA do. The hops were well blended with the malts so that they were in the forefront but were balanced more than most IPAs. The mouthfeel was very light and had no exceptional qualities. This is a very drinkable IPA and I look foward to tasting the remaining two bottles that are in my refrigerator.","LarryKemp","May 01, 2003"
3.59,-9.6,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall a nice IPA with good balance and flavor for a warm climate. I personally would have liked a bit more malt flavor balanced with some more hop bite. But I am a hop head.","purplehops","Mar 02, 2003"

3.85,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Got this solid IPA via trade. I think it is every bit as good as Fuller's and Stone's version, but not on the scale of Buckeye '76 or Ruination. Light and hazy amber color with a medium bone white head. Resonant hops aroma with some citrus. Flavor is nicely sharp and crisp, consisting of floral hops, pine and citrus. Finish is rather dry with a nice bite. Not as intense as the great IPAs out there but it is good enough.","Dogbrick","Feb 19, 2003"
2.98,-24.9,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"The draught version of this beer is bland and only mildy hoppy. The bottled version is one of my favorite beers. Since I can't see a logical reason to brew them on two different recipes I don't know what causes the difference in taste. The only difference I know of for sure is that the stuff out of the tap is clear while the bottle has plenty of yeast, but I am clueless as how the lack of yeast removes the juicy hop flavor and stips a bit of the malt as well. What is a juicy, well-balanced IPA in the bottle becomes a bland middling beer on tap.","aracauna","Jan 28, 2003"

4.24,6.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"This is one of the better IPAs available anywhere on the face of Gods green earth. Slightly cloudy orange, with a generous head and oodles of fine lace, also lots of goodies coating the bottom of the bottle. The nose simply reeks of hops, citrus like in its crispness with a malt sweet backing, and yes even a tad bit of yeast, a damn nice sniff, with the start sweet and pleasantly malted, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasingly acidic, the hop bite Herculean in its spiciness, the aftertaste droughty.","Gusler","Dec 20, 2002"

3.68,-7.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice bitterness in the flavor, not a huge hop flavor, more just bitter, but nice. Malt vanishes very fast and dosnt linger to balance the hop finish, but is nice and clean without any detracting suagry cloying ness. A very refreshing IPA in the british character, but with american hops. Works very well. Would like some more malt complexity and presence, but the way it is makes it very drinkable","nathi","Nov 20, 2002"

Great cloudy golden color, unfiltered scares alot of people lol.  Heavy on the hops and a excelelnt hoppy aroma.

I was expecting an onslaught of hops on the first sip, but it was a pretty mellow, balanced flavor with a lingering  bitterness late in the swallow.  Overall, a nice beer I wouldn't mind having in my area.  Thanks to aracauna, I was able to sample it.","pbrian","Apr 17, 2002"
3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very balanced, almost too balanced for the style. Good amount of dextrin sweetness with a softer yet bold hop bitterness. This one reminds me of some west coast pale ales, light in color with a big dose of pale malt and low - medium alpha hops. Clean finish with dextrins and floral hop.","Jason","Feb 05, 2002"
