"Simply put, this IPA is fantastic.  One thing Maine Beer Co. has been able to do with this IPA (and others in general) is make a very clean, delicious, IPA that isn't overly complicated.  If you come across Lunch, pick it up and follow the bottled instructions to, ""Drink this beer fresh."""
"Thanks Crown Wine & Beer for this wonderful treat. Certainly one of my favorite IPA's so far. Look forward to trying Maine's DIPA ""Dinner""."
""
"Amazing. Finally got my hands on this and it seems worth the hype"
""
""
"Overall, I find this brew goes past citrus clean to downright angular. It's a pungent array of compelling sensations, and killer IPA elements, and I'd go back for more. I appreciate the craft, but can't deeply enjoy it without food. Thai and mild Indian work well."

"Bottled on 3/17/15, poured hazy orange, two finger head sticky looking and laced like a mother. Some citrusy aspects in the nose as well as a bit of earth and the occasional whiff of booze actually, especially after it warmed.  Taste followed nose with more balance than MBC Another One. More great stuff from Maine"
""
""
""
""
"Creamy in color, reminds me of King Sue from TG. Great citrus and floral notes, finishes clean. Wish it had a bit more body to it, but amazing beer none the less."
""
"I pick up more of a citrus note on the nose, but it goes down with a lot harsher bitterness and taste of pine. Always an interesting IPA and grows on you with each taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So good! Best single IPA I've ever had."

"O.  A really well put together APA.  Pretty much everything in this beer is done very well and obviously was aimed at perfection.  Many APA/IPA's out there now focus on flavor and aroma which are prob the two most important factors but MBC did a great job at mouthfeel and everything just kinda comes together as an overall very enjoyable beer.  Well done."

"I liked it but it just doesn't hit me like some of the other killers in the category.  Stopped at the brewery and had a great time, good people."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best I have ever had."
""

"Not a bad beer I like MO better"

"Amazing Maine IPA. A total experience for the palate. Balanced extremely well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A lot like Pliny and a lot like other Maine beers that I have had. They make some good ones and this is probably the best one yet. I would love to try Dinner next, that is on that short list!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another phenomenal beer from MBC.  Had Dinner a couple of times and love it but Lunch is great since it is available year round.  Hard pressed to beat this beer for something that is readily available year round in ME."
""
""
""
""
"Lunch is dry and piney. I like my IPAs to be more juicy and tropical. Overall, a very good balanced beer but not one of my top picks. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Phenomenal brew with a ridiculously high drinkability. The initial taste is mild (with warm notes of clove honey), but gradually intensifies as the hoppiness takes over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fanstastic"
""
""
""
""
"M: light-to-medium, bright but warm"
"good. Not very unique. Still delicious."
""
""
""
"Great IPA. Just not a fan of the IPA style."
""
"A subtle, restrained take on the IPA. Really made me realize how many IPAs and DIPAs take an intense, maybe over-the-top, and even a scorched-palate approach in creating a flavor profile (and how accustomed to that I've become). Lunch touches on all the IPA components - sweetness, bitterness, hoppiness - but keeps everything balanced and proportionate. Good, unique stuff."
""
""
"Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
"The best single IPA I have ever had. Amazingly clean taste, not too bitter, but plenty of hop flavor that lasts throughout the entire sip. I need to try more beers from these guys..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA that's very balanced, and the taste is delicious."

"Very smooth and crisp. Drinking from a 12/30/2014 bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very easy drinking and well crafted IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh hops but not bitter"
"Favorite IPA of all time. Very happy to be a craft beer enthusiast living in New England. We are holding it down."
""
"The best ipa I've had to date. Hands down. 5's across the board"
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally got my hands on a bottle of lunch and was not dissapointed! Begins with a great looking amber color. Smell is a nice mix of citrus and pine. Classic ipa flavor without the bitterness that some have. Smooth finish. One of the best ipas I've had. Just wish I could get my hands on more."
""
"Much much much thanks to @Roguer for breaking me off with this as part of his  Pequodic BIF package!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA. Definitely in my top 5 for IPA's.  Wish I could get more often. Sooo good."
""
"Update: Falls off fast. I've had a 3 month old bottle and a 9 day old bottle within a few days of each other so I'm pretty confident on my comparison. The fresher bottle had way better hop flavors. I wish they'd switch to cans, and I wish stores would refrigerate them.  Alternatively, if stores advertised their inventory properly these wouldn't sit around for 3 months and a fridge wouldn't really be needed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer, highly recommend if you can get your hands on it. I have yet to try the other brews from the Freeport Maine brewery. Nice color, great taste. Smell was sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not your typical ""let's see how bitter we can make this while still keeping it drinkable"" IPA. A distinct and lovable example of the style."
"O: I've waited a long time for this and was not disappointed.  I loved another one but this is even better.  Perfect taste for me.  Has all of my favorite notes: pine, dank, tropical fruit plus a smooth finish"
"Delicious!! My favorite beer of all time!!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Defnitely a great IPA and worth procuring."
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious IPA. Hopefully I can get more of it!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Very fresh and of high quality.  Very good flavor.  I would be happy to drink this again, though would not want this all the time due to the dry finish.  While delicious, the beer left me feeling somewhat parched and looking for a drink of water."
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite IPA - perhaps even favorite beer. Beats Heady Topper *gasp*"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an awesome beer. One of my new favorite IPAs."
""
""
""
"O: Solid, solid, solid.  Drinkability is through the roof.  Lots of hype--well deserved!"
""
"Could be the east coast answer to my favorite west coast Pliny."
"Great beer from a great Brewery"
""
""
"Without question, this is the best smelling IPA I've ever had. Strong citrus and floral notes that will knock you off your seat. The flavor profile is similar, but just doesn't fully follow the amazing aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The quintessential IPA. Balanced, great aroma, delicious."

"A fantastically balanced and smooth IPA"
"The way an IPA should be. Amazing in every aspect, one of my favorite beers. Period."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Phenomenal.  Nose is subtle, yet resinous and oily, pungent taste. A staple of what an IPA should be like."
"My favorite Maine thus far, but I haven't had dinner yet."
""
"The East Coast's best brewery.  Love this beer (yes it's West Coast styled)."
"The depth and complexity of this beer always astounds me, each sip is like a flavor odyssey. The flavor develops and changes as it warms, turning a bit sweeter and more floral. It's a great beer that deserves it's reputation. Any hophead should seek this one out, it's a true fresh gem of an ipa."

"Absolutely fantastic, though I had it fresh (5 days old). Not sure if it'd hold up to being more than a couple weeks old."

"Overall: I'd describe this beer as up to the hype. It's kind of a blow-the-budget treat, but it's worth it. One of the best IPAs from the East Coast, I'd say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That was definitely a treat, one of the very best IPA I ever had with amazing aromas and flavors. Perfect low sweetness level and complex and balanced hop profile between citrus, pine and tropical fruits. As good as it gets, so not sure I should even rate this higher. It did hold up to the hype. Great beer for ending Sunday to counterbalance that shitty feeling for this day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer o just sit and enjoy. It's got a ton of flavor but remains uncomplicated. It's all about the hops, but there is enough malt presence to make this one smooth drinking beverage. The flavors all blend and get along nicely - this here is a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Citrus rinds; Caribbean lime; pink grapefruit. Light hay; green pine; fresh minty aftertaste. Almond astringency. Overall rating reflects the cost/reward ratio."

""

""
""
""

"O - I love this beer. Maine Beer Co. beers just have a freshness to them IMO.  Lunch is one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
""

"Tried this again.  Way better than the first time I had it.  Doesn't lack for quality in any one area.  All around great ipa"

"On tap at the Cask and Vine in Derry, New Hampshire. I was quite pleased to see this on the menu as I have been wanting to try it for years. Bright yellow-orange color, slightly hazy, good head. Aroma is quite hoppy, tropical and dare I say West Coast. Flavor was bitter, tropical, hoppy and again possibly West Coast. Probably one of the best IPA's from the east coast I've ever had, wish I could have brought home bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall: This is one beautifully fine tuned beer. I love the big nectarine and peach notes with big simcoe and Amarillo hop notes the malt is balanced beautifully and I love the simcoe finish. This beer was obliviously fine tuned and lovingly crafted. A east coast IPA to challenge all west coast IPAs. The best IPA I have had since Alpine. Check it out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent IPA.  I was drinking this side by side with Another One and although both are excellent, I preferred the additional complexity that was present in Another One.  But you can't go wrong with either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's been a few years since I last had this.  I remember it being a bit more rustic, similar to a homebrew.  It's still fantastic but I think that over the years it's lost a bit of character.  No complaints though.  One of the MBC beers that's actually worth the price tag."

"O- Great beer by Maine.  I'll grab it whenever I can.  As mentioned, it was lacking a little bit of what the smell indicated.  Maine's ""Another One"" is rated a little lower, but I think its the better IPA of the two.  Its has a similar nose, but packs that homerun taste to follow it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Standard IPA pour.  Rather midwestern-seeming hop profile, with loads of centennial and amarillo.  Tastes a bit more variegated, less green citrus and more tropical nodes as the simcoe hops shine through.  The hop profile is one of the best and most complex I've ever come across, and it spite of its variety and nuance it never gets too intense or cloying. Nice malt balance on the back end, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light copper with a few floaties.  The nose is wonderfully hoppy – the flavor profile does not quite deliver the hop bitterness “promised” in the nose.  The body is a touch lighter than most top-shelf IPAs .  Very good but not quite up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
"if the beer was more reasonably priced i'd buy it constantly. At this price i may buy it again if i see it this fresh."

"Simply amazing. First beer of the night, will not be topped. Hop taste is there up front with a smooth finish. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of the most elusive beers on my list, and I've gotta say, at long last, it holds up to the  hype. Maine Beer Co. does it again. Named after an injured whale off the coast of Maine, Lunch is easily one of the top pours from the brewery. The pricetag isn't friendly (as is the Maine way) but if you're looking for a quality pour, look no further."

"Overall: I feel I have give Maine beer a more than fair shot. This is the fourth and most highly rated hoppy beer I have tried from there and only 2 weeks old. And I can hardly stand to drink it. I usually love apas and ipas with a toasty malt base. But the earthiness and dryness just make it hard to drink and not the most appetizing."
"Carbonation is moderate and keeps this beer flowing smoothly while citric brightness keeps it from drying. It does get drier as the hops keep coming, but it's creamy up front before going clean and semi-dry in the middle. Crispness keeps up the whole way. It eases a little in the middle as far as the body, but never thins out."

"Overall this is a very impressive IPA from the folks at Maine Brewing. It didn't spoil my appetite for Dinner, but that, like so many days' meals, will have to wait."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big frothy head, easily three fingers with a very slow dissolve, uneven surface, cream white not bright, the lacing is thinner than you’d think, average stickiness at best, very light gauziness to the orange bronze liquid, consistent coloration throughout, few visible bubbles, maybe they all rushed to the top during the pour. The nose is thick which marginally hampers freshness, plenty of pine, herbal matter, the white grapefruit adds to overall punch, same for the white pepper element, the cocoa and malt cloaked, thickly layered nectarine, pineapple, guava, peach fruit scents, not going for finesse but comes off as a gentle steamroller. Full-bodied, tangy and biting, even the carbonation has a chip on its shoulder, steady push towards the throat. More tangerine and orange mixed into the grapefruit. The floral element softens a few rough spots. Earthy and close to minerally or metallic. The fruit pulls back, apricot, peach pit and some pineapple, green apple. As in the nose the malts wait until the 11th hour to arrive. Piney qualities add to bitterness. This is no messing around, no smiling, just business, type of beer."
""
""
"Poured from pint bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light copper color with a white half finger head, with good lacing ten minutes after the pour. Smells of malt, sugar, Hops, and citrus (mostly grapefruit). Tastes just as it smells, with first impression being the malt, then an earthy sugary taste, lastly the citrus lingers as you swallow. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with moderate carbonation (a little less than I usually like in IPAs). Overall a good IPA but not one I'd go out of my way to get, I much prefer the King Titus porter or dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, what a great looking beer! Beautiful orange with amber to ruby hues, big towering and thick just off white head that stays atop the beer till nearly the end and deposits big sticky and chunky lacing. Aromas burst from the glass alive with grapefruit citrus like notes and slightly sweet tropical aromas. Initially your met with sweet malt flavor with a wave of hop flavor bringing big citrus and tropical favors. Malt sweetness hangs in just to right before the finish which brings on some teeth clenching bitterness and that amazingly bright hop flavor. Mouthfeel starts amazingly lively with the carbonation with a medium body. It bursts into a creamy feel then finishes completely dry and compliments that great hop flavor and bitterness bringing an amazing drink ability. This is a world class IPA that has it all figured out."

"Family vacation to Maine and driving up with my brother in law. We go to see his brother outside of Portland and he mentions that he lives ""about a mile"" from the Maine Beer Company. Let's go! Tasting room with plenty of selections , I am on the hunt for lunch and dinner. No dinner but fresh lunch on tap. Buy up a mixed case of fresh beers in the cooler for more tasting afterwards. Bring one bottle back for my neighbor," hey, this is a real good one!"" What a well crafted beer. Only wish I had bought more."

"Delicious! East Coast, West Coast - who cares, this is a well done IPA. What can be said about a really good IPA that hasn't been said a million times in these reviews. It looks great, it smells great, it tastes great. It's a West Coast / East Coast IPA made and it's done well. Citrusy, fruity, even piney. Good stuff."

"The taste has tons of hops w/ the right complexity -blend of citrus and tropical flavors of grapefruit with mild malt adding a very gentle toasted taste with some sweetness on the palate and yeast adds a slight creaminess with gentle fruity orange-like accent with a peppery spice aspect which adds to the subtle dry yet bitter and very enjoyable quality to the finish. Overall this is on of the best IPA's in the realm of standard American style ales: Truly a work of liquid art -Kudos Maine!"

"An interesting gutting of the West Coast IPA bitterness paradigm, while keeping the rest of the hop goodness well intact. The malt perhaps suffers in this one-sided focus, and that powdery/chalky character, while weird, is not really off-putting in the least. Another (or was it the first - I'm too lazy to look that up) decent IPA from this brewery - glad to see them available around here."

"O: Very good IPA. A very well balanced beer with a great citrus and pine flavor."
"I did this side by side with dinner and preferred it SLIGHTLY."
"Pour is a golden amber with a fairly tight white head and a good bit of lacing on the glass. Nose has a hint of grain and some sweet malt with a fair bit of citrus hop and lots of resin. Taste follows the nose, sweeter malt and lots of resiny hop. Citrus is mild, moderate bitterness, strong hop flavor but not the kind I love and gets a touch sweet. It is heavily carbonated, moderately soft but a touch of syrup."

"Milestone review (#500) and it came down to a Maine Beer Co. brew versus one from Green Flash. Since I am pretty pumped that we just got another wave of four Maine beers hitting Alberta, here goes. Different array of hops from Another Round and this one is rooted more firmly in citrus and herbal territory, with Another Round skewing more tropical and perhaps more pungent overall (see that review). This one is a cloudy lemon yellow with a rich beige head, a matrix of smaller bubbles encapsulated in a layer of larger ones. A remarkable fresh hop aroma greets the drinker, pineapple, mixed citrus and fresh spruce needles, resinous with hints of berry. Palate is a sublime mix of orange/grapefruit/tangerine/lime rind and juice, pineapple, rock candy, baby aspirin, sage, red berry, guava, and a whiff of burnt toffee. Largely a hop flavor and aroma showcase but with enough malt to add a balancing sweetness to the equation. Very bitter but said bitterness is ultra-clean, buttressing an assertive and juicy finish of mentholated cough candy, lime, and flower shop. Body on the low end of moderate with the carbonation on the high end. Another clear cut masterpiece from this brewery, sophisticated and nuanced yet bold of flavor. The worst thing anyone can say about these guys is the high price point, which frankly I will keep paying so long as the quality remains this high. The social and environmental initiatives these guys take only sweeten the deal."

"The freshness was great. I guess its easy to create a beer with a bunch of hops, but it’s much more difficult to craft a beer with lots of hops that feels balanced but not sweet. Excellently done MBC."

"Pours dark amber..almost rusty orange.. Deep foamy white head with prominent lacing. Aroma is deeply citrusy and bitter..bright. Flavor is grapefruit, hops, bitter orange. Bold and intense..oily mouthfeel that's thick and chewy. Overall a full bodied IPA."

"A fairly gentle pour generated a big foamy white cap. Lots of carbonation streaming up. Head lasted a decent amount of time before settling into a quarter inch blanket on top of an awesome copper orange beer. Lots of citrusy hops on the nose not much from the malt bill. Smells awesome. Taste is great. Lots of hops but no overpowering bitterness. This isn't a beer about power as much as it is about balance. I feel like its limited availability gives unrealistic expectations. Taste the beer not the hype, and this sh@t is tasty."

"Bottle dated 4/29/14 poured on 5/31/14. Pours hazy golden colored with a one finger fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet caramel maltiness, grapefruits, some orange peel. Flavor is a bit brighter. Sweet grapefruit and orange rind, some grassy vegetal hops that I like. Much fresher flavor than aroma. Very light bodied and drinkable with medium carbonation. Very nice. While this is a solid brew I’m not quite on the hype train for this one. With that said, would be happy to have again."
""
""
""
"Poured out with a slight haze into a snifter forming a solid 2 inch head which sunk back in after a minute. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and prominent pineapple. Taste is a solid mix of pineapple and grapefruit with the latter in the finish with a bit of bitterness. This brew tingles the taste buds hitting the front of the tongue and palate most. Overall a very solid IPA which I would highly recommend."

"Pours a deep gold orange with some amber accents topped by a two and a half finger slightly off white fluffy, creamy white head. Fantastic retention with thick lacing that coat the glass all the way down. Mandarin orange, herbal notes including green tea and fresh cut grass, citrus blossom notes, some breadiness and grain. Starts with citrus and fruit notes, mandarin orange, kumquats, nectarines, fresh green tea, light floral notes. Some breadiness and grains midpalate and semisweet malt. Finishes semi dry with mildly bitter citrus rind and just a very light touch of caramel. Smooth, slick, silky mouthfeel with a hint of creaminess. Wonderful! Lunch lives up to the acclaim for sure. A superb American IPA."

"So glad I got to try this time sensitive beer pretty fresh. To start; this is absolutely wonderful and smooth to drink. Golden in color with a very serious head that was quite intense. Aroma is a bouquet of citrus and floral with some mild earthiness mixed in too. Tastes of wonderful grapefruit, some hops and citrus notes as well. Virtually no bitterness and extremely well balanced, complex, and very easy to drink. This ""lunch"" is somewhat medium bodied, creamy, has a little warming alcohol at the end, and finishes cleanly on the palate. Overall, this american ipa, truly is worthy of trying and is masterfully crafted!"

"O - As the simplistic white label art suggests, this beer is more about nuance and minimalism than hitting you over the head with flavors. It tastes astoundingly fresh - almost in a newly-bottled homebrew sort of way (albeit a very, very good homebrew). It may not be the biggest citrus-bomb out there, but it has a definite charm in its clean and balanced approach to the American IPA."

"(Bottle stamped within one month) Poured from bottle into tulip glass. 2” creamy head, semi-hazy bright orange in color, lively carbonation. Fresh, bright citrus and floral scent. Taste is hoppy citrus zest, some floral notes, subdued sugary malts. Well-balanced, finishes clean, medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and slight alcohol warmth at finish. Overall, a delicious fresh IPA that I'd definitely seek out again."

"Enjoyed, no - loved, on tap at Plan B in Simsbury CT.  This IPA, from the citrusy nose to the delicate lacing left on the goblet, to the outstanding, complex, citrusy, and yet not too bitter flavor, this IPA is absolutely delicious.  I will look for it on bottle, because it's just not around enough here on tap."

"I was quite impressed by this beer. The color was a hazy medium orange with a 1 finger white head. There was an excellent hop profile up front with nice notes of orange, lemon zest, and pine. Then it finishes with a nice balance with a little bit of malt that comes across as a light but smooth caramel. This beer is by no means sweet though and definitely focuses on the hops. Appropriate carbonation and great aftertaste. I could drink this all day."

"Supurb look upon first pour. Great golden honey color with plenty of transparancy. Aroma is true nectar of the gods - great fruity citrus smell. Little bit of pine and maybe even some white grape. Taste follows the nose and is incredible. A must buy if you ever see this. It is very rare in DC and was lucky to find some. I cleared the shelf promptly."

"UPDATE 2. I found a couple of fresh bottles in a shop (2 weeks old) and immediately invited a friend over for an afternoon tasting. And, yeah, this is a great beer. The first time I had it, the hops didn't come forward at all, I had to wait for them. This time with the fresh bottle, there was a blast of hops on the nose that gelled upon tasting into a very smooth, refreshing drink, with a bite. Re-rated to reflect the difference."

"Bought most of the beers that Maine Beer Co. was offering this past Fall with plans to do a tasting with six of my BA Buddies. But I wound up drinking them all with a couple of my beer buddies who attended my annual New Year's Party. Tasted Peeper Ale, Another One, Zoe, Mean Ole Tom, King Titus, Lil One, Lunch and Mo. Lunch and Mo were two of the eight Maine Beer Co. beers that I was really looking forward to tasting. Lunch did not dis-appoint me in any way. Outstanding is where I rated it and it was all of that."

"What needs to be said? For some beers that have garnered a strong following there's no question as to why. The balance here is incredible. The flavors are just perfect and the contributions the hops, malts and yeast make come together for a wonderful experience. If you haven't had this beer, seek it out."

"Overall: This is hop forward. There is very little malt to balance but man is it easy to drink. Even though this is fresh, I still prefer MO over this. Call me a mad man, call me what you will. Don’t get me wrong I love the aroma and Centennial in the flavor. I just feel that this is lacking a little bit from being insanely great. I still recommend this to any IPA die hard fanatics."
"This was amazing - I couldn't stop reminiscing about this beer for weeks after consumption, and invited a friend to try the second bottle I had (4 weeks old, at that point). I was shocked with the results. The beer had completely changed into a one dimensional zesty flavor (mainly of lemons and faded grapefruit), and had become grainy and earthy with none of the juiciness I loved the first bottle for. This falls off rapidly, it seems, and I'd warn anyone of getting one of these to make sure that you know what you're getting is as fresh as possible. For that matter, it's a tricky beer for me to want to revisit. I would love to try this fresh on tap, one of these days..."

Even more annoying is their do what's right propaganda. At these prices that's really in poor taste. Overall I'd give the beer a 93."

"I heard the hype and I'm just not that impressed. I drink a lot of IPA's and imperial IPA's both American and English and this over rated ale doesn't do it for me. Mouth feel is too light, where are the malts in this ale. Hoppy, yes but, again doesn't follow all the hype it gets as I don't get any malt sweetness. Don't get me wrong it's very good but, with all the hype, there are a lot of other ales out there that are better."

""
"Pleasant golden color with lacing. Bright pine and floral citrus scents. Mildly bready backbone with heavy citrus flavors and pine. The finish is long and dry with bitter grapefruit. Nicely balanced with excellent mouthfeel. Finely crafted IPA and very easy to drink. I would never turn one down but the bitter finish keeps this out of circle of my favorite IPAs."
""

"O: This both is and isn't a hop bomb. It somehow manages to be light and drinkable for such an aggressive flavor profile. The only mildly sour note is a slightly bitter aftertaste. I'll definitely have to try a fresher example."

Lots of different tropical fruits, with some citrus thrown in too. The taste is also quite good. A good hope bite to it, with some citrus notes.

"Pours a beautiful orangy color, pretty clear, but with a little haze and a very nice, creamy head. The smell is a citrus hops and while it's not overpowering, it's really nice. The taste is similar, hoppy on the citrus side, very little malt, not really bitter at all, it's very, very good and just what you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, but still great. All said, this is an excellent IPA and one that I would drink often if it were easier to find and if it were priced reasonably. It's similar to Flower Power and since FP is easy to find and reasonably priced, I'll probably never buy this one again. MBC: You make great beer, but your prices are RIDICULOUS!"

"Overall- if there were one word to describe this beer it would be ""balanced", as this IIPA truly is.  I love a good hoppy IIPA, but it's nice to finally have one that's not one sided. One of my new favorite beers, I definitely look forward to having another!"
""
"Overall: Really well-balanced (I've set that word a lot in this review, because it's true). The flavors all come together nicely to make a really drinkable, refreshing IPA. A really nice profile for an IPA - this one would be really nice if I could find it more!"

"Taste is juicy hops right upfront, full of tangerine and grapefruit, some piney notes, tingly on the tip of the tongue. Good balance of honey malt riding along, but this is hop central. Moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly slick, a bit watery. Great beer, been looking forward to this one."

"500mL thanks to Travlr. Pours a clear orange amber with a massive, off-white head. Massive retention and giant lacing. Nose is fruity hops with squashy melons. Softer aroma with some subtle complexity like vanilla ice cream, peaches. Yum. Taste is a little sugary and sticky with vanilla, nutty bitterness, sugary strawberry. Gets a little cheesy. Probably not the freshest bottle, but very well made."

"Had this at Max's during Hops Fest with a turkey frank and homemade chips and was thoroughly impressed. Crisp, slightly biscuity malt, great hop flavor and a nice hop aroma. I got some citrus and light pine and resins. Well-balanced, not overly bitter. It was a bit of a challenge because I had a half dozen other hoppy beers prior to this one, so the old flavor-taker was being challenged, but I loved every drop. I would have this one again and again."

"Poured from bottle to Tree house snifter. 7/30/13 bottle date. Poured with a monster head. Like half the snifter. I don't pour very vigorously, so very surprising. Dissipated fairly quickly though, leaving good lacing. Very bitter earthy smell. Less citrus than I remember from previous batches. Taste is also very bitter. Not a to of citrus. Nice creamy mouthfeel. I feel that MBC beers, and lunch in particular, suffer from batch variation. I've had amazing bottles of lunch, and mediocre bottles. This one fell somewhere in between."
"overall very good and extremely recommended."
"O: Very solid and approachable balanced IPA. This is one of my favorite IPAs. The aroma is great and the flavor is very good. Also makes very good beer batter for fish or chicken."

"O - Pretty awesome. Love the thickness, this is one for the bitter lovers - bitter-sweet-bitter again, but certainly nothing overwhelming. Certainly drinks like a IIPA. Certainly happy about this one."

"lunch is one of those beers ive been dying to try for a long time. finally found some, albeit not on tap, at the maine beer company itself, a very cool spot to visit. it was bottled a mere two days before I bought it, so freshness was prime. bottle pours a burnt orange sort of color, maple syrup looking, with half an inch of thick and lasting khaki colored head. the nose is a lot more balanced than expected, with some amber type malts, caramel color and aromatic to the roast, a bit sweet, and definitely robust. the hops are on the tropical end, quite apart from the picture the malt paints. pineapple and passion fruit, less bitterness than flavor. almost English pale ale sort of malt bill, way fuller bodied than I expected this to be. the hops come in about half way through, and crescendo into a really sunny fruity island sort of bouquet. the division here is pronounced. just a tad more body than I need in my ipa, but its sturdiness is appreciated, and id like to best in winter I think. a beer I am super stoked to have gotten to drink, share with my lovely girlfriend at out beautiful maine campsite, and contemplate at length. a great great beer from a fantastic little brewery. worth the hype."

"This brings the IBU's but balances the finish just shy of overpowering. Still would have liked to see more layers of hop flavor, mostly dominated by a dry, bitter piney-resin taste."
""
""
"For me, at this point I'd stick to Double Jack, Union Jack or Resin for half the price, or Torpedo for even less. But no question this is a superior IPA."

"Hazy, golden orange-amber. Huge head on top , off–white in color, three finger’s worth. Wonderful retention as I’m drinking. There’s juicy grapefruit and fresh orange aroma, sweet pineapple, and bright green grass. It smells extremely fresh and inviting, brightness everywhere. The taste is almost as juicy and fruity as the aroma, but it quickly fades into a more bitter, piney flavor. Mouthfeel is ok, nothing spectacular with good carbonation levels. I wish the flavors would envelope my mouth more because the hoppiness is great – it just needs a little bit more body. This is surely a quality IPA."
""
""
""

"Lighter side of medium body with smooth but ample carbonation. Easy drinking IPA with pretty good balanced flavor profile. The aroma might have been a little better with less age, but still a nice beer."

"A: Deep ruby to dark gold, impressive head, significant lacing along the edge, sea foam froth, craggy head – 4.50, S: Nose isn’t overpowering and actually quite meek, some caramel and mild citrus such as grapefruit – 3.50, T: Unquestionably an IPA, not over-the-top, quite herbal some grapefruit, doughy sweetness – 4.25, M: Slight crispness from the effervescence, hint of creaminess – 4.00, D: 7% beer and very drinkable, a little cost prohibitive but worth a premium, very nicely crafted and worth searching out – 4.25"

"Overall, nice bubbles, amazing fruity, melon, smooth taste. Just the right amount of alcohol, absolutely one of my favorites. Though, Mo and Another One may be higher in the Maine Beer Co. line."
"D: even with the bottle conditioning, they aren't fucking around with the consume within 90 days from the stamped on date. there is a slight oxidation that takes it down a peg for me. bummer. however, ill keep my eyes peeled for a fresher bottle and try again for sure. (3.75)"
""
""
""
""
"O: The hype-train hasn't stopped rolling once this one got started and I see why. This is a great, balanced IPA. I tried at about 60 days after bottling, so I am sure some of the hops have faded, but its still a fantastic beer at this juncture. I'm lucky to have tried, and I hope to be able to try again. I love the tangerine notes mixed with huge, upfront pine."

"Great smell. There was a hint of citrus and it smelled like pine. The taste was great and the taste held on well after the drink. The shops different and neat. It is in barn shaped building that has a window view of the brewing process. I would highly recommend this beer."

"Classic IPA look with pale golden body that is a little dense and a giant. foamy head that just left lace patches everywhere as it receeded into the brew. Smell is textbook with strong citric and wet hop aroma along with a caramel and bready malt sweetness. Taste and mouthfeel follow as I get a strong taste of hops, mostly citric with touches of plush tropical fruit and grape (pretty rare for a ""single IPA"") but nothing overpowered the tastebuds and the balance with the grainy, bready, and sweet malts is great. The hops are the star but don't dominate and the beer finishes crisp and dry but doesn't dry out tongue making this a dangerous session beer."
""
""
"A very good lunch indeed."
"It poured a light lemony-orange with a generous, two-finger head which held to no less than a coating until finished. There was proper lacing throughout, as well. Nose was floral and citrus with lemon up front. There was also some pine, grassiness and apricots. Taste was well-balanced with citrus, pine, but with the malt background evident and pleasant. Mouthfeel is creamy and dry but not overly bitter. Finish did not have much bitterness or hop bite either. This is a well-balanced offering I will absolutely try again."

"O - This was one of the few MBC beers I had not had the pleasure of trying. On a recent trip to Maine, I scooped up several bottles and enjoyed a few on draft. While I preferred the draft version, I thought both were excellent. Great citrus and tropical hops while maintaining some balance. This is another fantastic New England IPA. Fully deserving of its high rating."

"Lunch lived up to the hype. Definitely the best beer put out by Maine Beer Company, this one sits up there with the big boys. Comparable to PtE but not quite heady topper in my opinion. I really like the unfiltered, raw character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A very good brew from Maine Beer Co. I’m glad they made a standard IPA instead of a double IPA that everyone goes for these days. This is a solid, almost, I repeat almost, class leading offering in terms of east coast IPAs."
""
""
"Verdict: A really nice IPA from Maine Beer Co. Hops are definitely on the forefront, but balanced nicely. While not overly complex, the balance and temperance is what really shines. I could definitely drink this quite regularly."
"Overall it's an enjoyable IPA. Much like Peeper Ale, the malt character avoids a heavy caramel component and the hops are intriguing. Simcoe appears to be a brewery favorite variety, along with perhaps amarillo. Do I think it's a top 10 IPA? Not in my mind, but that's personal preference. This is a well-made beer with enough originality to separate it from the abundance of American IPAs on the market."
"Lunch pours a very clear deep gold with a beautiful head that really lingers. Fruity orange citrus and pine in the aroma with a bit of sweetness. The orange gives way to grapefruit which leads nicely into the flavor. The grapefruity hops come on strong in the flavor with just a bit of sweetness. The malt is dominated by a strong, but not overpowering bitterness. Overall this is a really nice IPA especially for a couple months old. I imagine it's hard to beat right off the bottling line."

"the aroma this beer gives off is excellent.. unfortunately it didn't taste as citrust as it smelled. the bittering hops used were a bit too herbal and not really what i was looking for. still a really nice ipa, but having waited over a year to try to land a bottle of this, i was slightly disappointed."

"This beer reminds me ever so slightly of Ale Asylum's Ballistic. The metallic bitterness and lemon aspects for sure. Here the malt is more understated though there's just something a bit strange about the overall cohesion. Lots of distinctive players that don't quite equal a memorable band."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: The best IPA I've had to date. Flavorful, but subtle at the same time. The alcohol is masked perfectly and is nowhere to be found for me. It looks great in the glass, it smells great, and it tastes great. I am in love."
""
"Drink within 90 days of May 23, 2013. Served in Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a hazy amber with a white, creamy two-finger head that settles into a nice frothy cap. Nice lacing and legs. Rich smell of grapefruit rind and pine. Citrus pith strikes the palate first and finishes with a heaping dose of pine. Sweet malt backbone balances the bitterness nicely. Medium body with lively carbonation. A superbly crafted IPA that gives the west coast IPAs a run for their money!"
"O- A nice IPA, definitely, worth the price, not really. I am very happy I tried this, but I don't see myself buying this again since I can get other IPA of the same quality for much less. Still haven't had a beer I haven't really enjoyed for Maine Beer Co."
""
""
"Even with a moderate-easy pour, a 2 finger off-white head just refuses to quit. Nice amber body, good carb. The nose is pretty faint. Not sure if it has dropped off with time or started out mellow. Not bad, but was expecting much more here. Taste is solid, but I have the feeling this started out much more than what it is now. Not getting any of the citrus or pine that others have described and what you'd expect of a west coast IPA. The bottle says drink within 90 days, personally I think the limit is much shorter than that. Still a solid drink, just doesn't have the shelf life it says it does. Would really like to try this again when it is much fresher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is creamy and has a texture unlike any other IPA. It's complex and full without heaviness. Not complex because it has too many things going on, but because each quality is deeply met and it has perfect balance. The fruits are succulent, the malt resounds. The hop perfume lasts and translates into the drink. The resin is light and the bitter is essential. Intense but not overdone. This IPA soars."
""
""
"Hyped up, looks nice, smells nice tastes excellent. Surrounded by Excellent beers here in the northeast it isn't the best beer I have had but it certainly is extremely good, better than most no doubt.The hype is legit and the price is right. Would drink several times over."
"Bought 2 more bottles and enjoyed them as much or more."

"Overall an outstanding brew from Maine Beer Co - less punch than a Heady, less creaminess than Can't Dog, Less malt/caramel than some of the other highly rated IPAs and more bitter and complex than Pliny."
""
""
"Lunch pours a nice darkish golden color, with a nice large lacing head. Their is a very nice strong dry floral aroma from this beer. The taste has a nice floral bite from the hops, on a rich and almost hidden malty backbone. Nice full flavors, yet easy to drink, very smooth and nice carbonation. Overall a no frills IPA with lots of flavor."
"Pours a cloudy amber in color with a nice big white head and some excellent lacing. The smell is fantastic very floral with some sweet citrus notes. The flavor is good but dose not quite live up to the nose. The whole profile is rather bitter with some grapefruit bite and a tad of a bitter plastic taste I cant put my finger on. The mouthfeel is good for an average strength IPA and it is a very drinkable brew. Over all this is a good beer but I expected a bit more out of they ""hype"" Being a local IPA thats not to expensive I will surely give it another go in the future especially seeing as it got better as it warmed. Bottled 5/28 so its very fresh."

"This is easy to drink. Though overall, I do feel like it's too boozy, and at only 7%. A pleasant drinker, but in all honesty I was expecting more out of this one. Especially since, at the time of this review, it's ranked as the 11th best ipa in the world. Considering that: I've had many IPAs I would say are better than this."
""
"From the brewer: ""Lunch is a special whale that has been spotted off the Maine coast since 1982. She has what looks like a bite taken out of her fin which adds to her unique character. We dedicate this beer to her determination and persistence."""

"Overall: This is obviously a great IPA from Maine Beer Co that I just had to try. This is a wonderful West Coast IPA that if not for the high price I would drink a lot of. Need to get my hands on some Pliny to truly compare."
"overall. This one really impressed me, if you could not tell already. If you are a fan of a very nicely made west coast ipa in the vein of pliny (with a little less alcohol) then you are in for a treat. I admire the subtlety and restraint that this one shows in the face of many of the over-the-top ipas that are present in the beer world today. nicely done mbc."

"MF - Light to medium body, moderate carbonation, smooth, a little creaminess with some minor lasting bitterness."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly light body. Super clean and crisp tasting. Bright citrus flavors right off the bat, lots of orange flavor, starts dry but finishes juicy making the mouth water a bit. Brisk carbonation. A little thin on the front end but the body builds near the back end. All hop flavor throughout with the exception of the lingering flavors. Some malt and alcohol linger along with the bright fruity hops. Faintly grainy underneath it all. Slow building bitterness but an otherwise incredibly smooth beer. Nicely balanced and incredibly drinkable. If it came in a 6 pack rather an incredible hard to track down single bottle that would be fantastic."
"O- The most amazing thing to me about this one is that it has the hop profile of a huge double IPA, yet it is only 7% ABV. Aside from the fact that it is 8 dollars for a 16.9 oz bottle, this IPA is a tremendous offering. Would definitely have again. Best aroma of any IPA I have reviewed. Almost worth the confiscatory price just for the chance to experience the aroma."

"Nice mix of citrus, tropical, and piney hop character with a supportive malt backbone. Very well attenuated, the dry finish lends an excellent drinkability. Again, huge thank you to Mike for the hookup!!!"

"O: 4.50 - surprisingly, I never drank this beer after living in CT for 12 years, but I'm glad that they've recently started distributing to the greater D.C. area; I have tried several of their APA/IPAs to date, and this is clearly the highlight; it's one of the most well-balanced American IPAs out there, and, for $7.99 for a >16 oz., the price is right if you can find it, recommended fresh!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent American IPA. One of my favorites."
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has a killer hop nose that boasts of citrus hops; probably citra or simcoe. The malts lend an adequate base and complimentary aroma. The taste is good. It has incredible balance for a beer with so much hop character. It's tasty as hell with loads of residual citrus hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an incredible beer. It's loaded with flavor and a ton of hop character."
"Bottled 05/21/2013 and served in a tulip nonic. Pours a dull burnt orange with a slight haze and a rocky, three inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses notes of tropical fruit, a hint of rind and a light graininess. Taste consistent with nose, but a bit more muted. There's also a slight medicinal bitterness that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation, and a slight acidity. Finish leaves a light, residual prickle between quaffs. Overall - no where near worth the $7.49 price tag. A decent IPA, but not all that mind-blowing an experience. I'm quite surprised at all the hype this beer gets."
"Serving type: bottle"

"500mL bottle with 052113 printed on the side. Pours a murky dark orange color with over an inch of thick, frothy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical fruits and citrus hops. Pineapple, mango, orange and others. Nice bitter flavor of the citrus and tropical fruits along with pine. Some sweet malt flavor but this one is all about the hops. Citrus and tropical at the finish with some slight floral notes. Creamy mouthfeel. Glad Maine Beer Co finally made it to Ct. Overall, really good IPA but with so many other comparable choices out there the price will keep me from buying it all the time. Still great and worth seeking out."
""
"O: It's easy to see why this is hyped. As far as east-coast IPAs go, I can't think of one that's on this level - maybe super-fresh Troegs Perpetual IPA or Flower Power? Obviously I haven't sampled any of the (supposed) Vermont masterpieces, but I'd still imagine this one is really high up the totem pole regardless. And to think I was ready to complain about MBC pricing before sampling this - I'd gladly pay $8/500ml for this one again. And again, and again, and again..."

"Pours golden yellow with a very impressive head and lace. The smell gets you right away with nice hop, citrus and sweet nose. Honestly, you'd think this was a top double IPA from the look and smell. The taste is the best IPA I've had. Typically im not all that impressed with IPAs since double are so much more loaded and well balanced, but this is close to a double in a standard IPA skin. Well balanced is the definition of this beer. The hops, citrus and sweetness blend so nice with a smooth aftertaste. Maine Brewing Company continues to impress me more and more and they appear to be the big up and comer. As far as this IPA, its the best on the market."

"Three day old bottle. Über fresh. The beer is clear and yellow with a small white head. The aroma brings a bouquet of citric hops. Absolutely delicious.

"OV: A very tasty lip smacking IPA that lets the hops flavours shine through without being too bitter. Good malt base for balance. Definitely a treat to the taste buds. As I've said before, I wish Maine Beer would send more of their brews to NJ as the majority of them are just so limited."

"O: Unfortunately, this one just did not live up to the hype. I was SOOO excited to try this one, and the second I took a sip, my immediate impulse was to check the bottled-on date to see if this was fresh....a definite red flag. Despite a bottling date of 5/7/13 (050713), a mere 19 days old, this beer tasted a bit lifeless. Pleasant no doubt, but not even close to comparable to some of the greats of the style. I went into this beer thinking it would be comparable to Pliny, a beer I am very familiar with, but this one fails to compete. While the nose was out of this world, that was the only stellar aspect of this brew. Reading some of the other reviews, I am really questioning my palate right now...Might come back and edit this one after I crack my other bottle. Maybe I am still coming down from my cold..."
""
"O: A top notch brew. Actually, reminds me a bit of Heady Topper. Fruity and earthy. I think this one is slightly less malty and more bitter than Heady Topper. Nonetheless, it is quite the honor to have tried this beer and put it in the ranks of IPA's elite."
"Bottled on 5/21/13; poured into a Bell's nonic pint. I didn't seek this beer, it sought me and demanded that I consume it. Pouring itself into the aforementioned vessel, it jumped out of its holding container to exclaim, ""I am IPA; marvel at me."" A huge, two-finger cap of foam gives way to myriad lace patterns resembling broken guitar strings, frayed curtains, and shower-glass film residue. The nose is permeated by a citric cornucopia that is backed by just enough malt to create a majestic balance of hop perfection. To characterize the taste would never do this beer any justice, as words pale in comparison to the sheer pleasure that follows the first sip. As I consumed more, I began to sense a tectonic shift within the craft beer industry. This isn't just Maine Beer's version of a West Coast style IPA; this is their version of a better one. You know the brewer has struck a chord when you can hear the cherub and the seraphim rejoicing holy, holy, holy while you're drinking it. Maybe none of it was real. Maybe I woke up one morning and imagined what the perfect IPA would taste like. All I know is that this version of IPA is without rival. Rumors have already surfaced that it can re-grow hair on bald men, and resurrect lifeless medical patients from their catatonic state. You know what, I believe them. If you're fortunate enough to get your hands on this brew, consider yourself among the chosen. Ladies and Gentlemen, Lunch is served."
"Poured from a bottle with a date of 05/09/13 so fairly fresh (2 weeks old) wonderful yellow-orange color with a huge fluffy white head. A light piney, citrusy smell that I cant get enough of. Not overpowering but just enough. Goes down easy would definitely buy this again but too bad it's eight bucks for a 500ml bottle. I want more."
"O - very good example of the style, it totally kicks ass if you drink it straight from the bottle."

"Wow! What a beer. I've had 2 MBC beers so far and every one of them has been really good. They must be doing something right up there in Maine. Would I drink this again? I certainly would like another one! I would like to thank my good BA friend RCM505 for hooking me up with this winner."

"Very enjoyable IPA, lives up to their description as a great version of a West Coast IPA. My overall rating would have been higher if not for the hefty price tag, there's quite a few beers just as good or better even, that cost half of what this one does."
"O: Light tasting and highly drinkable. So drinkable that it reminds me more of a pale ale than a 7% IPA. I could probably down a pitcher of this, and I don't say that often. That being said, the level of hoppiness and flavor is quite low."

"The only detraction is the value of the 500ml bottle for $8 plus tax. Is this exponentially better than the numerous amounts of hop-forward American IPAs, probably not, but amazing good and worth a try at least once. The price is worth while at least for one go around, same with Zoe from this brewery, but I can't say the others are worth the hefty investment."
"O - great take on an IPA. This would be perfect for summertime"

"O: This beer is much lighter in mouth feel and overall vibrato than I anticipated. It shows amazing restraint which pays off with complete balance. It is fresh and light, opposite again from what I would expect with a name like LUNCH. I am impressed and thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer. I can see why some comments I've read say this beer is watery, it does feel light on your palate and depending upon your mood some beers will speak more to your taste. That said would I enjoy a lunch with just a bit more malt body sure, but I also can appreciate what has been crafted in this bottle. There are many BIG IPAs on the market so therefore I believe there is also a place for a well balanced well crafted refreshing IPA. Bottled on 3-26-13."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I suppose this was the freshest beer I have ever consumed. Bottled: 3/26/13. Consumed: 4/3/13. Uh, let's not kid around here: This was an awesome beer. Any fan of beer owes it to themselves to drink a bottle of this beer. And quickly! lol"
""
""
""
"O- here we go! The east coast continues to counter punch the west coast! Tropical bitterness. While the scent was all fruity hops... The taste gave some delicious balance. So glad Maine Beer Co. Is here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a slightly hazy, rich golden yellow with a generous amount of fluffy white head that settles down into a thin blanketing. Even with >1 month of age on it the nose presents dank grapefruity hops with a good backbone sweetness. The taste is initially grainy & sweet, but then the juicy/bitter hops kick in and create a savoring/balanced APA. The potent grapefruit in the nose and taste do not translate into the mouthfeel, which has more grainy sweetness and subtle, non-lingering bitterness as an afterthought. I taste more of a lingering graininess than hoppiness. It could afford to ferment out more sugars to dry out the finish, but I think that might distort the juiciness of the fresh hops. This beer is very distinctly hoppy, highly drinkable when fresh. The beer could maybe afford a bit more attenuation, but that's just personal preference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With medium complexity and simple succulence, the beer is remarkably hop-balanced, dry, and clean- giving the ale a unique and clear near-perfect demeanor from the initial sip 'til its deeply resinous finish."
""
""
""
"O: A winner for Maine Brewing. This is Plinyesque in its ease to drink. While not a hop bomb, it does a great job of balancing citrusy flavor, hop, and bitterness. I found it be extremely enjoyable and would recommend it unequivocally."

""
""
""

"O: Overall I thought the beer had good bitterness and a great appearance. I wish it had more actual hop flavor to marry with the bitterness. For an American IPA, I would expect to see more presence in the beer instead of just blatant bitterness. There was also a strange (what tastes to me) carbonic flavor that was off-putting. I'm on the fence about recommending the beer...it's good but I think it could be matched or beat by many of the other IPA varieties on the market. I probably won't by it again, given the available alternatives."
""

""
""
""
""
""

""

"O- Like I said before, this is one of my favorite IPAs and I really look forward to it's release. Even though this bottle was a little more bitter than what I remember, it still didn't take any enjoyment out from drinking it. This is definitely a must buy whenever and if ever you come across it. This brewer knows they have a dependable recipe for this IPA and continues to make it great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It's good, but I can find better IPAs at better prices year round."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the versatility to the hops in both the nose and flavoring. At each aspect of the sip, or with a slightly warmer temperature, the hops seem to take on a different persona. Soap, pine, citrus, and herbals all show up at some point through the tasting. This helps to keep the beer refreshing and seemingly new to the end. Everything else about this beer embodies the inherent “clean and simple” attitude of this brewery, and when coupled with the basic complexity of the hops, makes for a delicious beverage. Dare we say, our first thought at the first sip was ”Pliny”?!"

"Maine Beer Company's Lunch is by far the finest IPA I've ever enjoyed. In reality, its comparables aren't IPAs but DIPAs like Heady Topper and Stone's Enjoy By series. Lunch manages a similar level of hop flavor and malt backbone with only 7% ABV. This blows the competition out of the water. The only drawbacks are that Lunch isn't sold in 6-packs and isn't always available, making it more like specialty DIPAs than other IPAs. Regardless, if you see a bottle for sale in your local craft beer shop: buy it!"

"A superb IPA and definitely worth purchasing if you can find it. This IPA is certainly unique and a nice variation on a popular style."
""
""
"Its a good beer, but this is almost twice as much as Pliny? Oh well, its definitely better than average, but the price seems way higher than average too. Eh, if you feel like being a balla, hit it up. The only thing disappointing about this beer is the price."
""
""

"Lots of delicious juicy orange citrus flavour, from Warrior, Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo. Orange coloured body, with some retained head. Orange aroma. Similar to a DIPA without any palate erasure. Masterful IPA. . Very good hop aroma. Had again a half year later, also a month after brewing, from Capone's Superior, smooth mouthfeel IPA."
""
""
"O: A fantastic, flavorful IPA, made on the east coast but very much in the style of the best west coast IPAs, with loads of hops and a rich, complex profile."
""
""
"O: Frankly, Maine Lunch is a bit of a disappointment. I don't dislike the beer at all, but the flavor is more blandly bitter without more complex hops flavor. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be going back, especially at the pretty outrageous price."
""
""
""
"Very impressive IPA. The appearance and the smell are the highlights, but the rest of it holds up just fine. Pleasantly thin on body and taste. Happy I got the chance to try this - it's right in the sweet spot of top-notch IPAs."

"Overall: Maine Beer Company you have ""Wowed"" me again!"
"O: Good, balanced american IPA"
""

"O: A real soild Dipa fairly well balanced with a good hoppy flavors and a solid feel. I got it super fresh (3 days old) but that didn't make the difference for me though i still didnt love it. Despite that it is still worth a try"
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, just nothing profound or overwhelming. They say this is an East Coast made IPA dedicated to West coast IPAs and I can see that. It leans more towards hops than malts and is definitely drinkable. Not my favorite, but this company donates 1% of its yield to environmental non-profits. Cool."
""
""
"O: Been searching for this one for a while and finally got my hands on some and damn, this is good stuff. Top 2 or 3 IPA for me. Now having completed the entire MBC brew lineup, I think its safe to say that these guys up in Portland mean business."

"But for what it is worth, it is a really good local IPA, which I could really dig if I wanted something of low complexity to enjoy with some casual fair and light conversation, or sitting by the pool in the summer, maybe a cigar with a connecticut shade wrapper to add to (or even escape) the flavor experience. For the price and format though I cannot see myself buying this again as there are many more examples in the segment that have a more fulfilling taste and a better price point."

"Overall a quite nice beer. Nothing spectacular, but I feel it is a little different from anything else I have had, so I'm glad I got to try it. Would be nice to get a sip direct from the tap to see how that compares."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with ample carbonation. I had high expectations for this one based off of it's freshness and how I enjoyed their pale ale at 3 months old. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a let down and I think I give the nod to the pale ale over this ipa. While it is decent and without fault, I felt it came up a little short and was lackluster. I would pass on spending $8 for 500 ml again in the future."
""

"Overall: This is one of the best IPAs you'll ever have. By no means is this something that will blow your face off. This is a nice warm weather brew that you just enjoy.

"Overall (4.5): This is an excellent IPA. I know it’s not weighted heavily here, but I’m a sucker for a really good-looking IPA, and this looks fantastic. It smells fantastic, too, and the taste is great—not perfection but I really can’t knock it much. Every IPA is different and this one does what it does very well: not blindingly bitter, but with a great flavor and a fantastically dry-hopped aroma, with a nice body and excellent look thanks to some good bottle conditioning. This is a great beer. Too expensive and hard to find to make it a regular, but a nice treat when it’s fresh."

"Was able to share a bottle of this with a friend that I bought from Tru Beer, a bottle shop in Northampton, MA. Nice find there! Pours a slightly hazy orange copper color with a two inch off-white head that laces well throughout and settles into a nice creamy-looking top. The aromas are rich tropical fruit, citrus, sawdust and a bit of malty sweetness. On the palate, it is full of flavor - pine sap, cedar, earthy spice and a nice counterbalance of ripe fruit; pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of mango. The finish is long and woodsy with a good bitterness bite. A bit overrated as I’ve had better IPAs, but this was a solid beer nonetheless."
""
""
""

""

"The beer pours a gorgeous golden brown and murky, with a huge fat cream head with big patches of sticky lacing on the sides. The color is really gorgeous and I am loving the two finger width head that lasted for quite some time. The smell is beyond heaven with its fruity punch. Mango, papaya, and a wonderful pop of pine are the dominant smells here, but the malts are also there with a very slight biscuit. There’s even a slight bite of alcohol in the back of the smell, along with a classic bitter bite. On the taste there is a lighter bite of fruit. Mango and papaya are still dominant, but there is also the classic tinge of grapefruit in the taste. Malt is light and biscuity, but definitely a side show to the delicious hops of this beer. Mouthfeel is also to die for with velvety smoothness. Carbonation is effervescent in the start, but mellows out instantly into a sweet caress on the tongue. The mouth is left with some nice saliva along the sides of mouth and great dry bitter streak on the top and bottom of the mouth. The afterfeel is a little too dry for my taste, but still pleasant. Overall this is an awesome IPA with terrific fruitiness and a dry streak. This is a must drink, and is up there with the best IPA’s of the East Coast. This one doesn’t top Heady Topper, obviously, but it is quite tasty and a tremendous example of the style. Drink this beer."

"Bottle marked 8-10-12, one month old when I tried it."

"This poured out as a golden color. The head was white and had a good retention and a nice sticky lacing. The smell of the beer has a piney resin like aroma and a subtle malt sweetness in there. That taste of the beer has a good spicy flavor from the hops. It's got a decent balance of flavor blended with the malts and bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is tingly and remains smooth at the same time with a subtle booze kick. Overall this is a good beer, one of the best from this company this far."
""
""
""
"Wish I could get this more often."
"o - this is a damn fine beer and one that falls in the supremely drinkable category. goes down easy and it's so good that i have to make myself slow down and enjoy each sip. worth seeking out."
""
""
"Medium bodied, smooth carbonation, a nicely creamy feel. This is totally drinkable, full of flavor and finesse, putting a lot of the more heavy-handed hoppy beers to shame in my estimation. Get one and get it fresh if you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: This is my second review of this beer. The first time around, I noted some problems and perhaps some off tastes. This is not the same beer, and I was aware of it even upon pouring it. The first time I had this beer, a normal pour sent foam shooting out of the glass. The beer was over-carbonated and unpleasantly boozy. Whatever the issue was, it has since been ironed out, because I don't see the same problems in this bottle."
"An aggressive but not overpowering bitter note, and I’m pleased that it doesn’t have too much of that unctuous maltiness that comes with some super-hoppy beers. The primary association it evokes for me is haying season. Freshly mown grass still green, and the clumps of compressed sod in the back of the tractor bed, strong and complex with a ganja-tinge and just the faintest hint of fermented sweetness."
"Update 9/21: drank another bottle dated 9/9...incredible, even fresher, could chug it (but why would you do that?), the bottle went down so quickly; the reviews and ratings are justified."
"O- This is definitely a world-class IPA that I could easily compare to other top-notch IPAs. Very nice appearance, very aromatic smell, pleasant well-balanced taste, and was very easy to drink. One of the things that really stood out in this IPA to me was how well the citrus flavors and pine flavors balanced with each other without finishing too bitter. This is definitely one of my new favorite local IPAs right up there with HF, Heady Topper, Lawson's and others. I'm not saying it's as good, but definitely in the same league. I definitely recommend trying this one out."
""

"O: Great drinkability. Smooth and balanced. Top notch IPA, wish I could try it fresh since this was bottled 2 months ago, but really glad I got to try this."
""
""
""
"Bottled two weeks ago. Beautiful deep brown with orange-copper shades and a creamy thick white foam. Almost a 5. Aroma: All citrus, from tangerine to pinneaples with very light pine and malt. Taste is juicy hops, very fruity. The bitterness lingers in the aftertaste and remains for a long time. Ample and smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Being very fresh, hops take all the place. Maybe a little simple but so damn good. It’s up there with Edward. Above my expectations since I didn’t enjoy Peeper and Zoe that much."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very solid example of the style. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Solid IPA all around. I feel bad for my brother because I think this ended up being a 70/30 split in my favor. Worth seekin out."
""
""
"Overall: Once I had this, it took over Sculpin for my favorite single IPA. Tied with Harlan from HF. Need to have Blind Pig again to make a decision."
""
"D - Very nicely done. Unlike so many IPAs these days that border on DIPA territory, this one is firmly and drinkable a single IPA. Tthe malt is a bit on the dark side of the style, which isn't usually my preference, but I enjoyed it anyway."
"Overall: this is a very nicely made IPA. It is well balanced, decently complex and I look forward to trying others from this brewery."
""
""
""
"Overall not at all what I expected, not super hoppy and not super malty, just some kind of strange in between."
""
""
"An incredibly balanced and flavorful offering with an almost perfect mouthfeel. This one stands out among the crowd. Get it!"
"O: Seems like the cap might not have been perfectly sealed - especially since other reviewers seem to indicate that the beer was more carbonated than I experienced. Great hop flavors and this beer is very enjoyable. I found it easy to drink and would like to get another to check out the carbonation."
""
"O: This beer is packed with lots of interesting aromas and flavors from the hops but seems to be under carbonated."
"O: I wish I could get this in Indiana because it would be in my fridge all the time. Thanks again to skipjack"

"Overall: Another fantastic offering from Maine Beer Company! I think Zoe still get the nod as my favorite, but this one is really tasty too."

""
"Appearance is a dark yellow tone with a full finger of white head, that with a couple sips becomes a small, nice looking ring of lace. Its` nose contains lemon and orange, some hops, nothing too crazy going on with the aroma, but it is pleasant. Taste is bread, citrus hops, candy and pine. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit sticky, light bitterness in the finish. A hyped up beer which turns out to be quite good. But, would really love to see 6 packs released at $10-12, instead of just barely more than a pint for $8."
""
"O: this was a mostly impressive beer that I would definitely have again."
""
""
"O: This is way different from the last batch of Lunch I had. Way more murky and malty. To be honest I preferred it the first time, but this one is still pretty solid. This is definitely an above average IPA, but I wish it could be more consistent."

"I lucked into this bottle because a good friend had my back, thanks Bert. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a huge meringue like head that leaves lots of stickies on the way down. This smells incredible! Grapefruit, pine, resin, a bit of tangerine or orange, and hardly any barley to be found. The flavor follows the aroma obviously. There's a splash of bready malt somewhere in the beginning before the resinous pine and citrus onslaught. Nice tropical fruit flavors coming through along side the dank sticky pine and resin. Finish is fairly dry with a pleasant lingering hoppy bite. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. If this beer wasn't so damn hard to get and so highly priced I would drink these all the time, its a beautiful beer. Maine beer, you make wonderful brews, but the 16oz bottles and your high price point turn a lot of people off. /end rant"

"Big thanks goes out to ferillo for sending this one my way as a part of a very recent trade! Served from bottle into Mikkeller Teku. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, floral, and floral hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, spice, earth hop, floral, floral hop, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really happy to get the chance to finally try this one and for good reason. Upon pouring it into the glass I put my nose right up to it. I was surprised at how nice this brew smelled on first inspection. Really well balanced and all the right notes in all the right places going on here. The flavor was pretty nice too, but just wasn’t as balanced as the aroma unfortunately. The earthy note felt a little invasive to me, but it didn’t hurt the brew at all. Definitely worth your time to try or seek out if you have never had it and call yourself a hop-head."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, orange-gold coloring with a thick, light, frothy head almost an inch high. Great head retention, too. Clings all over the glass as you drink. Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing, with lime, orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. Hop forward with a follow up blast of tart grapefruit keep your taste buds standiing at attention. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing. Peppery and roast qualities at the end of the palate transition into the aftertaste, where a resiny and bitter kick displays the hops presence once again in this gem. The finish is clean, smooth, and only slightly drying. Amazing. Utterly amazing brew!"

Very good smelling. Taste is grapefruit, oranges, hops, and floral notes. Pretty standard for an IPA. Taste is spot on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is fantastic. I could drink this all the time."

"Lunch is named after a whale and, indeed, it is in fact what the beer geeks on this site would call a 'whale' (rare beer, difficult to attain). The bottle I just reviewed was almost 3 months old before I was fortunate enough to get my hands on it, but it was every bit as good as others hyped it up to be. I can only imagine how much more wonderful it must be fresh... it might just be worth trading a kidney for."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is of citrus zest up front with a malty finish. There is a mild level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."

"O: This was a delicious experience. MBC is very good at keeping the flavor profile restrained and balanced."
"Overall - WOW. Awesome IPA. Only knocked it down for the appearance and the mouthfeel - which are only afterthoughts when you smell and taste this one. Well done, welll done."
""
"A solid IPA that adheres to the West Coast style, though I prefer the citrusy, malty East Coast brews."
""
"Was given the 411 on this from my good friend at Colonial Wine & Spirits in Acton, MA. What I loved about this IPA is that versus all the other limited disty IPA's I've tasted, this one took the earthy/hoppy route versus the citrus finish that most others gravitate to. Very smooth at the same time which is rare to have that much hops without the LaGunitas-esque bite. Bravo Lunch!...Please brew more."

""
"This was a nice East Coast made IPA that had a good balance of citrus and earthy hops, along with a grounded malt base. Not my favorite IPA ever but a really tasty and enjoyable one at that."
""
""
"O-an excellent IPA that I hope to be able to drink on a regular basis"

"Overall: Lunch was worth the wait. It's one of the more interesting American IPAs on the market. If you see it, grab one. It'll surprise and impress."

"O - I wanted to give this beer a 3.75 overall, which isn't possible, unfortunately. But it's probably slightly closer to 4 than 3.5. This beer had set me up to think it was gonna be an absolute monster that lived up to the minor hype it was getting. No dice on that. Sad. One and done, like Derrick Rose (minus the whole not taking the SAT thing, which doesn't fit into the whole analogy)."
""
""
""
""
"O - Superbly crafted, Lunch is an excellent American IPA from Maine Beer Co. with a powerful hop profile that remains delicately balanced. And what's more, Maine Beer Co. recycles and gives back; a delicious IPA one can truly feel good standing behind!"
""
"O: An excellent drinking experience. Any IPA lover should go out of their way to try this."
""
"A winning entry among new East Coast IPAs."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice IPA. I thought the nose was great, very fresh and hoppy, with a lot of oranges and fruits. Taste was very good as well, with some bitterness and a lot more grapefruit. Would certainly like to have this one again, and would certainly buy it if I could."
"Very good offering. Im very impressed by this small brewery offering and glad Im able to keep getting them thanks to this site."
"O: This would be in my fridge all the time if it were readily available in FL."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled on 1/24/12. Pours a hazy dark orange, with a two inch sticky white head, with awesome retention and tons of lace. Smell tangerine, pineapple, mango, and pine. Taste like the nose would have you expect, with some grapefruit in the finish. Body is perfect not big or small, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is one of the best I have had, wish it was easier to find and more affordable."
""
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, explosive juiciness and sticky feel. In an avalanche of IPAs, this is one to remember - I'd definitely like more of this. I'm also a fan of the packaging, even though the pricing isn't the best."

"Poured into a pint glass, a slightly hazy honey color with a huge puffy white head, three fingers tall at least, displaying excellent retention and leaving a crusty full coat of lacing on the glass. Amazingly attractive beer. Floral aroma, thick with citrus and tropical fruits. Lots of fruity hops in the taste, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, mostly, pithy; a very nice sweet, bready malt base that comes out more when the beer comes closer to room temperature. Smooth and clean on the palate, medium body, and extremely drinkable. Exemplary."
""
""
""
""
"Great carbonation level and smooth. Medium bodied beer. It starts off nice and sweet with a nice, clean and dry bitter finish. Reasonably complex throughout and it the flavor lingers. Overall a really nice beer, lingering flavor is the best part."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a little one dimensional, slightly raw feeling too, but what a dimension it is."
""
"Lazy hazy amber ale. A great big, super tall off white head is produced on the pour. this fluffy billowing head leaves lacing aplenty. Hop aroma is excellent with a bouquet of herbal and floral and a touch of pine. Not picking up much in malts, but in fragrant beers like this do you really care. First sip bodes quite bitter and dry with a floral taste essence. Not as pungent as the nose leads us to believe. Caramel malts are found towards the end with a low level of diaceytl, thats not an issue here since it is quite low. This beer finishes smooth and with a semi-dry after taste. Pleasing to look at, smell and drink although the flavor is a bit muted still excellent none the less. I'm jumping on the MBC bandwagon right now."
""
"O: An incredibly juicy and balanced IPA. Cantaloupe and honeydew flavors are unique and the citrus and tropical fruits don't hurt at all. I finished my pint in record timing and am left wanting more. EXCELLENT!"
""
"Great stuff. Really impressed with the beer here. Not the most balanced IPA out there, alot of clashing going on, but hey, this is from the East Coast and we are not known for our IPA's. I can seriously say that this is worth a go, if fresh."
"Over all I loved this beer and price was spot on, up there or above all my other faver"
"This is an IPA that pushes towards DIPA without completely becoming one. Full bodied, hoppy ipa that leans more on the earthy side than the citric side. It keeps balance in mind while still trying to showcase hops. It's definitely an east coast ipa, and a very good one. Problem is, it doesn't warrant its cost. Nice to have once, but I won't buy it any time soon again. I can get the same fix from an equally good ipa that's more affordable and easier to get."
""
""
""
"Overall i enjoyed this beer and i'm glad i got the chance to try it fresh, I could see this beer being a good sessionable ipa that won't overwhelm your taste buds after a few, but the price point is too high for me for a session beer, so i probably won't be picking this one up again very soon but i did enjoy it and would like to try more of what Maine brewing co. has to offer"
""
"O- a very good ipa, one that i try to grab a bottle of whenever a fresh case comes to town, always a nice treat and a must try, very well done."
"1/24/12 bottle. Pours copper orange with a fluffy head. Nose is an array of bright hops, tropical fruit. Floral. Focus is more on fruit flesh than on pine and grapefruit rind. Pretty dry in the mouth throughout, bitter and long, some grassy floral qualities. Very nicely balanced but not much expression in the mouth between hop and malt. Light biscuit toward the back palate, a nice crisp delivery there. Nice stuff, not something I'm going to go nuts over."
""
""
"I reckon this is what the brewers intended, and it is a very well made beer. And apparently lots of folks think it is even better than that. But to me it is just another good IPA, but not one that stands out above the others in any significant way. I am a fan of Maine Beer Co and will continue to support and try their stuff. But I like my IPA's with more malt character and body than Lunch has. I understand that many others like them dry, like this one is, and that's fine. Just not for me on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice hazy dark golden amber color, very nice carbonation, with a nice two-finger creamy off-white head, with some very nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, nice citrus note, with some pineyness. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, with a nice malt balance, nice citrus note, and some very slight pine notes. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitterness finish. This is another very tasty brew from MBC, always a joy to try these. Thanks Bill!"

"Pours a hazy golden orange with creamy white head. Nice pungent citrus tropical hop aroma, grainy. Fantastic tropical hoppy flavor, some nice bitter hop balance with a perfect grain bill...well balanced and smooth. Its chugable, delicate, balanced, near perfect. What hasn't been said about this brew. Its delicious."

"Slow pour still produces a sizable head; dull amber glow sans sediment. Fresh clementines, nectarines, strawberry taffy, toasted bread, nutty yeast and fresh-cut grass in the nose. Rustic, smooth yet bitty mouthfeel—a beer of sub- stance. Tame bitterness, though the flavor flogs the taste buds for a while. Nice hop bite with citric and herbal flavors, and some spice in the middle as the dry maltiness tries to rise above. Apple and pear fruitiness, warming alcohol and graininess try to stave off the hop flavor, but it just keeps pushing along. Pretty amazing brew, bringing back some clout for the true East Coast IPAs."

"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a great beer to drink for a whole evening."

"Pours a rich gold color with what seem to be ruby hues throughout the body. About an inch of fluffy, pillowy, pure-white head develops, but dissipates after a minute or so; gobs of lacing remain. The aroma is of spicy hops, pine resin, orange citrus, lemon zest, various grains (straw, hay, wheat), and a muddled earthen sensation. It tastes of spicy hops, bitter/piney hops, various citruses, straw, and wet earth (read dirt, but in the best possible way; strange, yes). It is surprisingly delicious (or unsurprisingly, given your expectations; either way, it’s damn tasty). Mouthfeel is crisp, and finishes clean. Overall, a very good IPA that I’m very happy to have finally tried. I’ve been eyeing this one for a while, and Bill deserves another mention for his generosity."

"Overall, a very good IPA. The malt and hops balance nicely and the hop flavors are complex and blend together well. This is one of the best looking beers I've had and the aroma is excellent. It seems just a hint watered down but really not much, it may just be me. I was surprised, I really like this beer. I know a few people who would really enjoy this. A very good representation of the style."
""
""
"Overall this was a great representation of an IPA - Bitter, hoppy, foggy , yet smooth craft beer. I have not had the chance to drink an IPA for some time and this beer definitely got me infatuated with IPAs again. With only 4 types of beer available to purchase, Maine Beer Company is still a brilliant local craft beer maker that you need to check out."

"Medium bodied, but on the fuller end, with a blast of dry, bitter hops up front that linger over the malt backbone into a sticky, dry finish. Floral with lots of earthy pine flavor and sticky hop oils countered by a subtle citrus/tropical fruit presence. Hints of grapefruit and orange peel balance out the bitterness without overpowering them. Towards the end of the palate, the malt backbone is evident with subtle toffee, caramel and biscuit. Really well balanced and easy to drink with only slight boozy heat in the finish. Another solid offering from Maine Beer Co."

"Super-juicy piney-citrusy hops plow through, along with a decently concealed sweet malt body, bready, comes out in the nose later too. I would be interested to see how this tastes when it's not fresh, or even aged a bit - even though I'm not a fan of aging hoppy beers. Just a tongue assaulting array of hops. It has very similar hop profile to Smutty's Finest Kind, but seriously beefed up. Wowsers."
"D - Extremely well done."
"O- This is a supreme beer drinking experience! I would have this repeatedly if it came to Cincinnati."
"Perfectly crafted IPA. Up there in my ranks with Hill Farmstead Ipas and heady topper. Definitely more subtle and overall more balanced."
"D - One of my favorite IPAs, I buy one whenever I see one."
"O- One of the most unique IPA's I've had. The hop profile was really interesting and this beer is so easy to drink with some many different flavors and no bitterness to destroy the taste buds. I could drink this all day/night."
"O - This was a very good IPA. Not worth the high price and its a bit of a pain tracking it down, but I am impressed by this beer."
"This is, at the moment my very favorite IPA! Incredible IPA!"
"Seems like a lot of hype around this brew, mostly due to scarcity I suspect. Get it if you can, but there are comparable and more readily available IPAs."
"Overall an incredible IPA. Very drinkable, complex but balanced, it's well worth it if you can get your hands on one. Kudos once again to Main Beer Company!"
"This is easily an elite IPA. Bright, big hops with a clean backbone."
"Overall: One of the freshest, most aromatic IPA’s out there. Truly unique and artisanal. Reminds me of Hill Farmstead, only a notch behind. A true class act, and incredibly drinkable to boot."
"overall great beer will def trade for more in the future"
"Looks good dark amber nice head that sticks around. Scent is very pleasant. Hoppy and bready nose. Great flavor. Not as hoppy as the nose describes. Nice and full, malty backbone. Malts and hops are matched very wells. Although an amazing beer, I had my hopes up for one of the most amazing IPAs considering how fast it flies off the shelf, and it's good, but I would drink some easier to find and cheeper beers before I scoured the state for this. If Pliny does taste like this then I will not fly to Cali to get it. That being said I will buy it to support small, environmentally conscience, breweries. And it is really good beer."
"O: This was a complete surprise. I hadn't heard of this beer at all, didn't expect anything from it, and was very impressed."
"O: This is a very good beer. I can see why this has gotten the grades that it has. I don’t know that I necessarily prefer these softer fruity/floral hop notes in my IPAs…but that being said, there aren’t any negative aspects to this beer at all. It is well crafted and highly enjoyable. The mouthfeel is especially impressive. Would love an opportunity to try this one again."
"O - a darn good ipa. Comfortable taking it off my wants"
"O-very nice. Would really like to get more of this beer. And more from ththis brewery"
"O: Really nice honey floral beer that I'd love to revisit super fresh. The beer is not a punch in the face but it certainly has some gets some high marks from me in terms of refined flavor. The beer is balanced with an unusually forward presence of florals that are kept very drinkable by a malty honey sweet malt backbone. Some nice juicy flavors from fruits as well, but these are all dusty with age. Would love to revisit, but really it's already evidently a very good beer."
"Malt bomb IPA!?!"
"Caramel color, completely opaque, solid bubbly white head. Nice hoppy, almost rye scent to it."
"O: Awesome IPA. I'd put this up against Sculpin, Stone IPA, Masala Mama and other world-class IPAs, and expect it to be right in the mix. I wish I had bought more, as I have no idea when (if?) I will be able to get this again."
"O: Another contender from the Northeast. Awesome IPA."
"Overall: Not an offensive beer but far from inspiring. I wouldn't buy it again."
"O - Absolutely outstanding brew from Maine Beer Co. I wouldn't be surprised in the least to see people catching on to this beer and spreading the word. You might just find this to be the next hyped beer from the northeast, possibly the east-coast, and deservedly so. If this is billed as a single-IPA, it's up there amongst the best I've had. Absolutely a must try."
"Pours a nice amber gold color with some haze, nice densely packed meringue like head with great retention and lacing. Scent is big on pine resin and juicy citrus, lightly sweetened malt backbone. Taste is quite bitter without leaning heavily towards piney or fruity, very fresh with a splash of herbal notes, malt backbone is light but sweet. Medium bodied, splash high in carbonation, dry finnish. Just a good IPA thats hard to describe because it follows all the rules but exceeded others in quality."
"I really like this beer, it would be a privilege to make this and everyday drinker. The aroma is outstanding, the flavor is well balanced and Lunch is just a tremendously easy beer to drink."
"Definitely not a hophead, but even I can appreciate a well-crafted IPA, which Lunch is. Would definitely love to try this even fresher and on-tap, but will probably have to make the drive up to Maine to do so. Not that I would have a problem with that."
"Lunch, well its after lunch but thats ok. Murky amber orange, not quite opaque but not transparent. A rather hard pour produces some head. Not the very prettiest beer but what a smell. Huge citrus and pine, so fresh. Can't get over how fresh, piney and citrusy this smells. Big hop flavor up front, resinous, pithy pine, some grapefruit like citrus. Bitter mid-palate through the finish. Obviously malt plays second fiddel here, but its just enough to balance the extreme hops. Kinda dryish finish, not cloying from over hoppiness. Just a hugely successful beer by Maine Brewing."
"At around $8.00 for a pint bottle in NYC, it's a little pricey, but easily one of the best newfangled East Coast IPAs I've had in ages. If it ever becomes available in a six-pack....watch out, as it may rival Flower Power for my east coast go to IPA. Between this and Peeper Ale, Maine Beer Co. is killing it, and I'm thrilled that their distribution has reached NYC. Highly recommended."
"This beer is a treat. It's so clean and well-balanced. My only complaint is the bottle format. With a beer that is this easy to drink, I want to be able to buy a case of tallboys, not pay $6 for a 500mL bottle. Bottle conditioning works in cans, right?"
"Crisp and light-bodied. Thin bitterness and slight drying feel on palate. Very good. Satisfied the inner hophead in me. Easily my favorite offering from the MBC."
"A very enjoyable IPA. Good hop flavor without any crushing bitterness."
"Wow! Wonderful brew."
"This was a sweet surprise in a box I recently got, right after opening the bottle I smelled citrus floral notes and quickly became happy, as I poured it into a founders sniffer with about 1 finger of head that leveled out to just a ring of bubbles. The color of almost liquid copper sits right below the bubbles. The sweet smell of juicy fresh hops hasn't stopped since opening and only gets better as you get a strong whiff from the glass. you get tastes of citrus and slight pine and sweetness from the malt but it's not overwhelming at all, it's a complete compliment. The mouthfeel is full of lively carbonation and leaves your mouth dry after each sip, making you long for the next one. Overall this was an awesome beer that I would live to have again. Very drinkable at 7% makes me almost think stone ups but a bit more body."
"O: Excellent IPA! I went into this being forwarned to drink ASAP because it was 4 months old (the horror!). That being said, I'd have guessed that this no more than a week or two old by how lively and hoppy it was. I chalk up it's longevity to nothing more than being a very well made and well cared for beer. Thanks Jax!"
"The carbonation is just shy of average, which is fine by me as I like undercarbed IPAs more than overcarbed ones. Overall an enjoyable break from the stouts we were opening this weekend, I wouldn't hesitate to get it again."
"Much better!"
"-GFunk"
"Many thanks to Mdaschaf for the chance to taste this one. Excellent extra in our recent trade. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a unique cloudy yellow-orange color, with crazy head that fills the top of the glass and takes forever to recede. Smell- tropical citrus, sweet honey hops, sweet orange flavors that remind me of dreamcicle popsicle. So excited to try this. Taste- this one is all about the tropical flavors and the citrus. I get some really nice orange flavors, a little bitterness on the end. This bottle isn't ultra fresh but I love it. Can only imagine what it would be like with fresh pungent hops. Overall, love this beer."
"I feel like I'm missing something here. Lots of praise for this beer but I dont see the hype. Glad I didnt trade for this one, good but not worth the hype for sure."
"O - A solid beer, but not a world class IPA. I probably won't seek it out in the future, but certainly wouldn't turn down another bottle."
"O: very nice East Coast IPA, delightful balance and good use of hops."
"Really well-balanced and a joy to drink. Will definitely buy some of the next batch if I got the cash."
"Overall: Really nice beer. This one was from the end of July, so I think it would be even better fresher, but still very good. I'll definitely seek this out in the future."
"It finally dawned on me about three quarters into my pint that this brew reminds me almost exactly of Port’s Wipeout. In fact you could probably cut n paste my review from Wipeout here. Even has that same homemade IPA type feel with the murky sediment and fresh hop flavors. * Have to conduct a side by side sometime."
"But, worth it. Very drinkable. Wish I had another, but the store from which I had purchased it a strict one per customer limit. Will definitely try again, if I can find another....I hope!"
"O: An excellent offering from the Maine Beer Company. It took me a while to track this down on my trip to Maine, but I'm glad I did. Lunch reminds of Alpine Duet, in terms of both smell and taste. This beer is very easy and pleasant to drink. I'm looking forward to the day when they are able to expand their distribution."
"Thanks, smokeypeat, for the opportunity"
"Overall: This is a top shelf beer. It is very refreshing, and quite gulpable. The people at Maine Beer Company are doing all of the right things."
"This is so fresh and refreshing. Great summer beer. I have had the pleasure of having this beer on 3 occasions in the last month and each time it was fresh and great. The pop when being opened was strong. When very fresh I would say this rivals the best of the west. I wish Maine Beer Co. the best of luck in the future in producing beer that both rivals and surpass this beer."
"Overall, another great beer from main brewing. Would love more from them."
"O: This is a great IPA! Love how smooth the bottle conditioning makes this one. From nose to close, just flat out amazing brew. Beats Peeper Ale hands down. Rivals many WC ales for sure. Lives up to the hype."
"O: Wow. I'm ridiculous impressed with this one. The best IPA I've had to date. It was just perfectly balanced and simply wreaked havoc (in a good way) on my taste buds. I wanted more and more. I need more and more. I love it."
"overall: decent amount of hop bitterness but this beer felt (and looked and tasted) more like a sort of strong pale ale than an IPA if that makes sense"
"the pop and the pour makes a grown man cry. powerful pop without any aggravated head coming up. pour is like a german bombshell in carbonation. amber clear with bubbles coming up consecutively 10 minutes after popped. head is about 3 fingers in a pint glass but i poured it too aggressively. and definitely sticky... nose if tropical but not forward. passionfruit, dragonfruit, and mango. palate is a bit of all thoughs but justifiably grounded in a note of floral and earthy. notes of pear and lychee as well. malt is a bit orange meringue. very subtle peppery ender. first IPA i've had with a yeast flocculation in the bottle. but that doesn't not effect that taste as all if just makes a bit more bready and earthy. a well made hop recipe with what i would believe to be an english german yeast in origin... but a man can dream. california look out."
"O - Such a nicely balanced IPA, great drinkability, for a 7% beer I could put away a few of these without a problem"
"I can't gush enough about this wonderful beer, and absolutely recommend seeking it out. It's beauty in a bottle."
"I had this finally for the first time at the Hop Head Throwdown last month. It really blew me away, exceeded all the hype that had been placed upon it. So clean and delicious, i saw angels around me as i drank it. I hope to get my hands on a bottle of it in the next few months."
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not filling, decent kick, nice representation of style. I really enjoyed the pine, fruit, and citrus hops and were balanced with the malt presence very nicely. The only knock is the carbonation and feel to this beer. I'd drink it again in a heartbeat though!"
"Overall: Throw a couple of hop pellets into any beer and I will most likely enjoy it at least a little bit. That said, this really did not blow me away as anything spectacular. Kind of an IPA with an even keel attitude."
"O - Another great offering from the Maine Beer Company's family of IPAs. I've really enjoyed everything they've done, and big thanks to Shane for sending them all my way!"
"Thanks again to my friend Eric and his wife Christine for grabbing this for me, a beer I likely would never have had the chance to try otherwise."
"Go get Lunch!!!"
"I'll have to have some more to find out what's going on. Keeping in mind that this was at a bar...perhaps it's a bit old?"
"O: The rumors are true, this is a fantastic single IPA, among the best I've had. Hard to compare and rank relative to our best out here on the west coast, but it certainly deserves to be among them."
"Good IPA, though it started out as an easy A, wound up bringing the smell/taste scores down about halfway through, warming didn't help this one for me. Glad I finally tried this."
"Overall: Another quality IPA from Maine. I tried this at the Union Brewhouse a month ago and have decided to buy a bottle up in Maine to enjoy down here in lovely old Adams Village. Looking to have more in the future."
"O: One of the handful of IPAs outside of my distro that actually saddens me that I can't get it. These flavors are just layered together in perfect fashion, nothing gets it's toes stepped on, they just all play together perfectly synchronized."
"Tasty beer and certainly showing plenty of promise. Very pricey for an IPA and without there being a bottle date on there I would not buy again. This one was a bit faded and the nose was lacking."
"Overall- A little underwhelmed, honestly. I like the first burst of hops, but the rest leaves something to be desired. Not as dry as I prefer. Certainly tasty, but nothing too special in my mind. Oh well, it's a nice hop fix."
"What an awesome beer. I went to a package store that was advertising that they got a shipment of this beer in. When I got there it was not on the shelves and I was bummed out. But a store employee gave me a bottle out of a stash. Man it was well worth the hour plus drive I made to get it. What a crisp and clean tasting IPA. Well done."
"O: Overall this is a very well blended and balanced Ipa -none of the flavors distract from one another , Just enough malts and just enough hops, very well made - Great job Maine Beer Co.."
"Overall - There's something a little bit unclean about the finish and the appearance. It's tough to specify exactly what's wrong with it, but it's just shy of spectacular. Still something delicious and another great IPA coming from northern New England. Look out, San Diego."
"O: Again, MBC puts out a beer that I really like. Hard to pick a favorite, but this one is really good. A west coast IPA made in Maine! Need to get more next time I go up north."
"Pours a hazy red/copper with a very impressive, thick, fluffy marshmallow white head. The head does not mess around and isn't going anywhere, despite your best attempt at a careful pour. Aroma of sweet mango, grapefruit and touches of pine and lemon. Flavor beings with a burst of crisp, zesty, citrus hops. Very nice, bready, cracker sweetness that comes around and mixes well with the grapefruit and minor tropical notes that stand out. Ends with dry, semi-bitter pine hops, a touch of spice and a bit more citrus sweetness. Really crisp and compact flavor profile, but allows you to sense the different layers in the beer. Cohesion is off the charts. Certainly will be a star in the New England IPA scene."
"O- I had big expectations for this one, as it took me a while to score a bottle (thanks Tully's!), and it doesn't disappoint. Very impressive offering from Maine Beer Co. and hope I don't have to wait as long to try my second bottle. Very good IPA!"
"O: Delicious and plenty hoppy for a single IPA. The combination of hop flavors is nearly perfect to me. Enjoyed this on a warm summer day and was very refreshed by it. I only wish it was easier to find."
"O- Very nice IPA. West coast take on an East coast brewery. Wish there was more of this."
"the CPJ"
"O: Wasn't sure what I was getting myself into with this one, but it was a pretty nice IPA."
"Aromas excellent, taste very very good. Overall, extremely tasty ipa."
"O: A solid, delicious IPA that just finishes a touch thin but this is still one fine beer; and wow, does it have an amazing aroma; I could breathe this all day or perhaps wear it as my new cologne"
"o - i'm giving this beer the full monty. a 5 on overall. the look is weird, the mouth is normal, but the smell and taste are my definition of what the perfect ipa should taste like. this beer being bottled a little over a week ago makes it one of the freshest ipas i've ever tasted, so perhaps that adds to it, but this beer is incredible. i recently spotted maine brewing stuff locally and hope that this one makes it out here since i'd buy up the lot and drink them all the time. thank you maine brewing company for bottling my perfect ipa."
"D - This was bottled on 5/8/11, yet this tasted pretty damn fresh! Really glad I was able to find some of this stuff. Beer... it's not just for breakfast anymore. This is one liquid lunch I could enjoy over and over for my second meal of the day."
"This is a beer that confirms why I enjoy standard IPA’s more than DPA’s. You’d never know this was 7%... Fantastic Beer!!!! Hopefully this will become a standard beer in MA distribution. I had to fight to get these bottles."
"O - Overall I like this IPA alot. Really good aromas and flavors, but the billowing tower of head killed it just a little bit for me. Still, worth seeking out."
"Overall a really good beer but didn't quite meet up to my expectation from all the hype. Definitely would buy again and try a re-review"
"By far my favorite offering from these guys, well done. I definitely will be picking up more of this in the near future."
"O: A very good East coast IPA, this one offers up an awesomely perfumed nose, lightly sweet malts on the palate and a wonderful blend of floral and citrus hops in the flavor. Another hit from Maine Beer Company."
"O-Simply put, this is one of the best IPA's I've experienced. Refreshing, citrusy, bitter and all-round exactly what I look forward to (i.e. not much malt backbone). I just wish it was not so expensive ($6) for a pint bottle (purchased from VT)...for me, I wish I could get a bomber for that price...but a good beer is worth it...exceptional!"
"This stuff brings new meaning to the saying ""Let's have some Lunch."" It pours a clear gold topped by over a finger of marshmallow foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, orange peel, light pine, mild caramel, honeydew, light flowers, and a decidedly light whiff of mint. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is a touch sweeter, and some cantaloupe and light apricot have been added, bringing a more-than-welcome extra bit of fruitiness to the proceedings. Damn, this stuff is tasty! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a great IPA, one I'm really glad I was able to try."
"Even with two months on it, there is no doubt that this has quite the vivid and well balanced hop profile to it and a pretty smooth body overall. It’s just a shame that this ended up showing as much heat from the ABV as it did. I knocked my grade down a bit based on this experience with it, but I’d be willing to tango with another fresher bottle of this. The potential is definitely there."
"Beer is way thinner than I expected, finishes mildly dry with moderate bitterness. The beer is chewy up front with a sulfury and sweet sort of hoppiness that carries through to the midpalate. The beer is pretty good, just thinner than I hoped but I would have it again. A mighty fine IPA."
"O - A very solid IPA, but nothing to go all that crazy over. It's good, just not world-class, IMO. An enjoyable go-to beer if you're looking for an IPA, no doubt."
"D - A very nice IPA from the East Coast that I suspect was even better 6 weeks ago. Still it's aged remarkably well and is quite hop-forward. I'd gladly have this one again."
"O - Good ipa, highly sessionable. Nice clean taste, refreshing, would love to have this on a regular basis."
"O: I'm a huge fan of this beer. If it were available in my area, I would be seeking it out all the time."
"Thanks to Jason (amphion1065) for this. Nice brown with light lacing. Smell is tropical, grapefruit, a little funky. Taste is solid for an IPA, piney and tropical notes a little alcohol in the aftertaste. Great mouthfeel and good taste overall. An outstanding IPA that lives up to hype. Highly recommend tracking this one down."
"Thanks to Chris for this bottle... murky light peach, a really wonderful light tope head, great retention and cap, decent lacing... smells outstanding, very tropical, pineapples with some grass hops, wonderful balance... the taste is really good as well, something living up to the buzz, grapefruit with a wonderful bitterness to it, pine with a touch alcohol, so much flavor, this is outstanding"
"A big bubbly head stands on top of an extremely carbonated copper/orange body. These bubbles will not settle down. About two fingers of head. Nose is sweet bread and tropical fruits but with some pine as well. Light and balanced but the aromas still stand out. The flavor is completely different than I expected from the nose. Malts are sweet and roasted fruity like an imperial but on the light side. Hops are a mix of pineapple and spicy herbal. It finishes fruity and dry. The dryness is a mix of piney fruit and malt tartness. Creamy and fruity body with a bitter but thirst quenching finish. A large amount of head stuck around until I was finished."
"O- After having Zoe a few weeks ago, I was expecting this to be just as good, and it almost is. This is a very refreshing beer that is well balanced, but still has that nice hop presence that I'm looking for in an IPA. I hope Maine Beer Company keeps up the great work, as I will be looking for more of their beers in the future."
"O: A very good beer. My first from MAINE, hopefully not my last. Definitely one worth seeking out - that is for sure!!!"
"This is one good yet overpriced ipa. the beer pours a darker yellow to almost light orange color with a decent white head. the smell is huge grapefruit and pine notes, with almost no malt character whatsoever. the flavor is citrusy and piney at the same time, very bitter very dry and very delicious. the mouthfeel is thin and well carbed. overall one of the top 3 ipas ive had"
"Still my favorite IPA, can't wait for a fresh batch!"
"The palate opens with plenty of ripe citrus flavor blended with some pine resin., Orchard oranges, some tropical fruits, and a fruity peach character are all present. Bitterness is low here, the palate is dominated by the hop flavor. Malt character is subdued, there's not much here apart from a mild sweetness. Drying on the finish, there's a mild resin character and plenty of citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is sublime. Softly carbonated, this is expertly conditioned. Redolent and resplendent, this is an excellent IPA. Thanks again, John!"
"O: Very good IPA, and although my review does not say it, there is just something I don’t absolutely love about it. It’s really good, but not my favorite. Thanks again Michael for sending me these!"
"O: Maine Brewing hit a home run with this one. Honestly I put this up there with Sculpin and Blind Pig. It might be even better when super fresh. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of these (if you can, they disappear at an incredible rate)."
"The first one of the night I wanted some lighter fare to get things going in the right direction and this one definitely did the job for me for sure. Pours out a nice medium amber color with a light head of white that caps the top rather nicely and leaves a smooth and even layer of lacing. Aroma is nice piney hops that mix in and mingle with a smooth and delicate orange note and a touch of a light malty base. Very clean and crisp flavor, light body is more then adequately carbonated and left no doubt in my mind as to how good this one could be. Nice biting hops up front are quickly subdued by a light buttery taste and an earthy, piney freshness that cuts right through. Smooth as silk and overall just a very solid and drinkable IPA."
"Hazy amber color with a big white head the retains very well. Smell is of pine and grapefruit. Taste has a combo of tropical fruit and pine and some malty sweetness coming through about midway. Nice mouthfeel, about medium carbonation and body. This was a pretty tasty beer."
"The hop is the story of this beer as to be expected. There is also a strong alcohol bite to the taste. The malt is present but plays second fiddle. The body is spot on. Pretty good combination for me. A classic IPA."
"Overall, this is another wonderful beer from Maine Beer Co. I'm a huge Zoe fan, and I now consider myself quite the Lunch fan!"
"Another good beer from MBC, they have yet to disappoint me."
"Kind of feels like a mix of West and East coast, bringing a nice balance. Somehow I get a cotton candy feel out of it but it really is a nice beer. Reminds me of the late Uber Sun."
"damn. This is definitely going to be a permanent ISO. I've had pliny more times than i can count, and I think this blows it out of the water. the only problem is that I don't have any more."
"Glad I got to have one of these. Good stuff. Hope I come across it again."
"Good on ya Maine Beer Company! Love the expansion of both the brewery and the styles you're adding. I'm psyched to be able to find these beers down here in MA after leaving Maine."
"Overall: My first take on this beer was that it was mindblowing. I decided to drink a second bottle to make sure. the second bottle showed me that it's not a knock-your-socks-off kind of beer, but it's extremely well balanced and delicious to boot. Probably one of the best examples of the East coast IPA, and at $7-$8 for the 500mL, it's a solid find."
"Pours a beautiful sunset color. Thick off white head that lasts awhile, webs of lacing. This is one nice smelling IPA! Tropical fruits, and citrus. Imagine a hop marmalade if you will. The flavors follow the nose. Pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, and pepper. Light to medium body, it is just a little thin for my liking. Its a bit warm. An easy drinking, straightforward IPA. It goes down fast an easy!"
"Fresh and fragrant, with notes of lemony hop goodness, light tropical fruits, maple sweetness and bready notes to balance out this stunner...How come I have not heard more about this brewery?!? and where can I get more of their brews?!?"
"As I said, highly enjoyable and strongly drinkable."
"Overall-- I'm impressed with this brewery, and I look forward to trying more from them! The beer is certainly interesting and tasty, but the nose and appearance crush the other aspects."
"Overall: The flavor and mouthfeel of this beer combine to make an extremely refreshing IPA. I could easily drink a lot of these, especially on a hot day. Maine Beer Company continues to impress."
"A very tasty, fairly well balanced IPA. Hops dominate, but don't overwhelm. Easy to drink, but a bit overcarbonated."
"A real drinker. I will buy anything from these guys. Keep it coming!"
"O- A great IPA. Lots of variety in the taste department during a sip. I strongly suggest picking this beer up."
"Off the top of my head one of my top 10 all time IPAs."
"Medium thick, light carbonation, syrupy body with a slick, sweet finish that is only mildy bitter or dry. Flavor is dominated by biscuit and caramel malt with some resin and pulpy citrus in the finish with some dry pine hops. Very well balanced and drinkable, but a little too sweet for my taste."
"An extremely solid IPA, and the best Maine Beer Co. has to offer."
"This was a very well-balanced IPA. Will pick up more of these."
"Much better than the first, tons more citrus and tropical fruit hops, fairly bitter, still got the earthy hops and quite bit of bitterness, but really tasty on this batch, still a bit more booze than I would expect for 7% too."
"The flavor starts off tropical with some mango, slight pineapple, and actually a bit of cantaloupe. Light orange there as well. Really smooth bitterness hits throughout. Medium body and only a slight hint of alcohol, which actually works its way in nicely with the bitterness. Average carbonation. Smooth going down again and again. Really nice beer. Cheers to the whale who inspired this brew."
"O - This is a good IPA, but I was expecting better because I hold Maine Beer Company in very high regard with Zoe and Peeper in their arsenal. There are better IPAs out there, but this one definitely deserves respect. I believe that this beer is going for a ""refreshing"" IPA like all of Maine's other refreshing beers, and it definitely achieves this characteristic. Prosit!"
"Cheers"
"O - you have got to love this beer simply because Maine exhibits such CSR."
"Perhaps not distinctive or over the top in any particular way. Just a well-made beer, delicious and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a creamy medium body feel that seems a bit heavier than many other IPAs. Overall, Lunch is another top notch offering from Maine Beer Co. These guys really know how to use hops."
"This is exactly what I wanted after a long shift slingin' booze in a non-A/C warehouse. Delicious and more refreshing (but just as good as) than Zoe."
"O: This is a great example of a hoppy bitter IPA. Maine Beer Company brews some fantastic beer. Definitely try if you like bitter IPA's."
"Overall: If anyone ever wants to know what a super hoppy, yet not bitter IPA tastes like, go to this beer. If you don't understand what the terms hop aroma and hop character mean aside from IBUs, reach for a Lunch IPA. Really a great brew from what is fastly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"terrific. Was the perfect beer after a day of hiking. well done, again, Maine Beer Co."
"Taste is nice and fruity, a bit bitter, but well balanced, a bit chewy and very tasty, Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with a nice sharp finish. Super tasty & very drinkable. Another hit from Maine Beer Co."
"A sip is...delicious. Smoothly bodied with medium to lower carbonation and a swell of sweet fruit goodness. A good balance - with a sweeter malt base that never overpowers, allowing a clean, lightly pine bitterness to follow through to the end - if anything I'd say that the finish is too balanced and could use a touch more hop bite. But with an almost non-existent alcohol presence, this is a very drinkable pint."
"Add Lunch to the growing list of outstanding IPAs coming out of northern New England. With more and more beers of this quality being produced locally, I have fewer reasons to envy the folks on the West Coast."
"O/D-This is yet another great beer from this company. I do not know it this defeats Zoe, but this is one damn good IPA. The alcohol is masked effectively. The taste, nose and the feel are exceptional as well. Maine Beer Co. is quickly climbing up the ranks of my favorite breweries!"
"So far have loved everything from Maine beer. Lets pop this open. Golden/orangy pour with a sizable white head that settles down. First whiff, we have a winner! Is this another tropical IPA? I'm getting the grapefruit and piney hops in the nose, it is very aromatic, similar to Flower Power. Mild bitterness starts the tasting experience, nice bready malt in the background blends with tasty hops. Considering all of the strong flavors, this is light on the tongue and very drinkable with a quick dry finish. This is among the best IPA's that I have ever had. I'm not getting the real tropical flavor that the nose exudes, but it is damn near perfect. Maine Beer Company is 4:4 with me! Fantastic"
"O: This has been getting a lot of hype lately and while I did enjoy this, it's didn't really impress me all that much. Perhaps it's just from the fact I had Sculpin and Hellhound on tap just last night, but this didn't seem as hoppy as people have been saying. I thought the finish was rather weak. A solid IPA with really pleasant flavors, but certainly not on the level of the Sculpins."
"O - wow this is one amazing beer. maine beer company has done it again and i can't say that i'm at all surprised at this point. definitely pick this up if you can."
"Yummm.... outside of Allagash's outstanding interlude, I'm not sure I can recall having another beer from Maine I've enjoyed as much as I've enjoyed lunch. Now I'm wishing I picked up more than the 3 bottles I purchased at RSVP."
"O-> Another fantastic offering from Maine Beer Co. Have yet to be disappointed by any of the three beers so far from these guys. Glad I was able to enjoy this pretty much as fresh as possible as it was purchased the same day it arrived at a local bottle shop. Will be looking forward to the 2nd bottle I bought that is sitting the fridge, waiting to be enjoyed..."
"651"
"I like this one about as much as I like Maine Beer Co. beers; a lot."
"O - Excellent IPA...this is my first experience with this beer and at only 2 days old, it is probably as good as it gets. Will be interesting to see how things change over a few weeks/months, although the several other bottles I have aren't very likely to survive the weekend."
"Had this with lunch (how apropos) in the house my wife and I closed on today. An excellent fresh beer as the first bottle enjoyed in the new home. Well done Maine Beer Co., especially with the snap distribution."
"Lunch is another impressive beer from MBC. I'm sure that drinking this beer when it is just two days old helps, but I imagine it will hold its own for a number of weeks. I definitely see myself drinking a lot of this; I don't think I'll start packing a bottle as much lunch, but it will certainly pair well with many future meals."
"D/O: Amazing new beer from Maine Beer Co. Luckily, this is brewed 2 minutes from my house and I can get it this fresh, hopefully all the time now. Simply amazing IPA. Get this if you can!"
"Overall, a really solid IPA that really impressed m in almost all aspects. Similar to Peeper, but better in my opinion. Just a really nice IPA that I plan on picking up more of."
"The feel seems a bit light and the carbonation is a little bit low. I feel like this one just needs to get a little more lively and a little more body to it and it will really shake things up. Overall, I love Maine Beer Company. This one isn't a homerun for them but it's still a hell of a lot better than a lot of beers on the market. A few flaws in my opinion but this is still one I'll picking up."
"A modest pour yields an immense head - thick, rocky, and white, leaving loads of snowflakey lacing down the sides and lasting til the final sip. Pretty gorgeous. I'm getting a lot of orange creamsicle in the nose - plenty of citrus, but a nice touch of honey and cream malt profile. Extremely fresh hop taste here - again mostly citrus with a strong orange oil presence. Nice bitterness up front, but as hoppy as this is, it's actually quite balanced too. Nice deep malt here, a touch of caramel, smooth and sweet. Excellent body, slightly chewy and full. Really a lot of flavor here from all sides of the spectrum, but remaining somehow simple, straightforward, and refreshingly drinkable. Another awesome beer from the guys down the road."
"Well worth trying and is really good."
"D: This is a really great IPA. If you like their Peeper, you will love this. Just imagine that but with even more hops. Just delicious. The second bottle in my fridge won't last too long"
"The taste well what can I say its probably the best IPA I've ever had. The taste is all hops but never overwhelming. The flavor starts sweet becomes a citrus hop flavor and ends with a slight bitter of hops flavor. Wonderful."
