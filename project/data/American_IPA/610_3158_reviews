"Light copper in color.  Decent hoppiness on the nose but no real essence of rye is present.  The rye notes comes through in the flavor profile, however, and the hoppiness takes a back seat.  A pleasant fruity notes pokes through on the finish to nicely accompany the hop bitterness."

"Looks really dark and malty. But not malty as it looks. Initial taste is somewhat bland with a hint of malt. It's meh but it does have a great mouthfeel"

"12 oz bottle poured into nonic. Pours deep orange to brown with floaties and a fairly tall off-white head. Aroma is grapefruit, pine, and floral hops, caramel, and rye spice. Taste is similar with light malt sweetness followed by a wave of high hop bitterness and some rye spice on the finish. Individual flavors that I enjoy, but the combination in these proportions seems off. Medium-full bodied, creamy and sticky, soft carbonation, bitter finish."
""
"O: I really like this beer.  Some people may be put off by the floaties in the glass, but it tastes great.  And what's more important, how it looks or how it tastes?"

"GOD DAMN, this beer hits the spot every single time. Might be my favorite bomber to pick up on a whim, and it's 5 bucks. Achieves such a fine balance of malt and hops to the point where you can almost pick one or the other to focus on, but both are still respectfully present. Casual but classy; solid from start to finish with no fuss . This beer is marriage material."

"I'm in love with this great brew and need to get more ASAP! Pours a dark copper with a modest head and a small ring like lace that retains throughout. It seems that this one is unfiltered as you can see some sediment. No problem, as it does not affect it negatively. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of caramel, chocolate, syrup, toasted bread and a tiny bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste is a malt lover's dream. A firm malt backbone with toasty bread flavors and caramel. Yet, this sweetness is never at risk of being cloying. Make no mistake about it, this one is also a bit of a hop bomb. This is evident in the finish and aftertaste which is a perfect marriage of dry, bitter and sweet. There are also elements of spice coming from the rye. I like my IPAs to have a good balance between hops and malts and I'm so impressed by the perfect balance this one has achieved. What a feel! It is full bodied and chewy yet so drinkable. I just finished it and I'm sad because I wish I had more. Reminds me a lot of dogfish head IPA 90."

"Someone seriously mis-classified this beer as an IPA.  It's far more like the American Strong Ales that I've had than any IPA.  I would rate it more highly along those lines, but it's not my preferred style and probably not something I would buy again."

"Delicious rye beer for those who worship at the house of rye beers. Enjoyed this in draft 16 oz pour in standard pint glass at The Craft Bar Destin, Fl. Dark Amber colored color with very nice head leading to nice lacing sip after sip. Caramel, earthiness leading to wonderful rye notes. A beer worth seeking out for sure. Pick this one up on your next trip to your local craft beer shop or pub."

"Initial thought: sweet and hoppy. Amber, slight smoky, deep rich maltiness. Roasty notes. Hints of caramel. Floral hoppiness. Resinous and dankiness from the hops counteract some of the sweetness. I'm really digging the soft bitterness from early addition hops.  For how sweet the beer starts out it finishes somewhat dry possibly because of the rye in the grist. Some nice subtle spiciness is detected in the finish combined with some cereal grain finish. Nice beer, a little sweet for me. Medium body w/ perfect carbonation allows all the flavors to shine and lends very well to the drinkability of this brew. If your going BR, give me a Red Rocket Ale or Racer 5 please. Good brew non-the-less."

"12 oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours positively dark, more amber than pale ale. Massive tan head accompanies a rich aroma with a good bit of rye in it, along with secondary notes of pine forest hops. Visible sediment left in bottle. Flavor is more classic rye-ale meets West coast IPA. Quite delicious."

"Another fantastic IPA entry from Bear Republic, one of my favorite California breweries. Nice frothy head, highly enticing aroma, and an excellent rye-dominated flavor. A big mouthful, to be sure, but an easy-to-drink 8%. Very nicely done, Hop Rod takes its well-earned place next to Racer 5, Big Bear & Café Racer!"

"O: Did I mention that this beer is 8% ABV? The alcohol is really well hidden. This is a medium-bodied and more than medium-carbonated beer. It goes down smooth and easy but it that high alcohol content can creep up. It's a really nice beer: easy to drink, complex and tasty."

"Mouthful: body is on the lighter side of medium, not crisp but not creamy either, but moisture from the thick head lingers on the back of the tongue on the way down."

"Despite it's tacky looking label, the inexpensive Hop Rod Rye is a formidable ale that hits both levels of hops and malt and issuing a nice flavor profile. The micro sediment is barely noticeable in its nice amber tone. And even though I was the dumbass who sniffed this one too close and got a nostril full of head to bring some water to my eyes, I am not judging the ""smell"" because of this. The scent is light, semi-sweet, and gives but a hint of what the flavor really can bring. For the price and the availability, the Hop Rod Rye is definitely worth its merit. . . Just don't snort the damn thing. . ."

"Not going to give the same ole type of review for Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye. No way! This is my most favorite beer in all the lands. From the opening aromas of rye and hops gently wafting into the air, to the wonderful dark pour and oh so wonderful rocky, creamy, off white head that stays with you like a best friend, and leaving the most wonderful lace, to the malty/bready/caramel rye flavor and truly perfect balance of hops and carbonation, to the finish that begs you to take another sip, this beer is king. Bear Republic is a brewer that has never let me down. Hop Rod Rye is hoppy rye heaven in a bottle!"

"* it's really annoying I had an impression on first taste that I was distracted before I wrote down. It didn't make itself as obvious to me after the first taste, but at the time I thought it perfectly described the taste to me."

"O: This is a fun, tasty, and very drinkable beer. Everyone plays nicely together. I would pair this with spicy roasted chicken, most likely Moroccan style. A smoked pork shoulder would go well too. For dessert: caramel and spice creme brulee, apple pie a la mode, or peach cobbler."

""

"The beer is good. It looks great--incredible head, excellent appearance on the glass--and feels only slightly heavy in the mouth. It also tastes good, albeit a bit sweet for me. I wish that it was a bit hoppier and that the sweetness was toned down a bit. But, I do like it and wouldn't shy away from having another."

"Not your run of the mill IPA that's for sure. Spicy notes in the flavor and aroma compliment the hops profile. Quite easy to drink and real nice feel. Get this if you can find it fresh."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely beautifully crafted. The sweetness of maple at the front of the mouth, the incredible balance of malt, booze, molasses, and bready biscuits all come together perfectly and caps off with a refreshing bitterness that makes you want to repeat the sweet and smoothness you get at the beginning. Highly drinkable. This beers aroma ends up melting right into the flavors as it warms up. Some rye ales have great aroma but tastes one dimensional. This one offers aroma and taste. Just a superb beer, have it at 55-60 degrees. Phenomenal."
""
""
""
"Oh damn that's good!!! This is the first beer I've tried from Bear Republic but I've been on a rye kick lately so I thought I'd give this a taste. Glad I did. This offering pours a rich caramel brown with a very generous thick beige head that lasts throughout the pour. The aroma is malty and spicy. Definite rye notes, toffee, pepper, spice, floral citrus, and light coffee notes. This beer is chewy and coating in the mouth. The flavor is what really sets it apart. Rich and malty, spicy and bitter, sweet and deep. It hits all the right notes. If this is a kin to all of Bear Republic's offerings then I greatly look forward to a long and enjoyable relationship."

"Pours a dark gold color with a small white head that laces up the side of the glass. The smell is nice, fresh, hoppy and almost a little starchy at the end. It smells very rich for lack of a better term. The beer is initially sweet and a little fruity up front, less carbonated than most IPAs, and then the real profile starts to set in. The rye is very rich and malty but the hops really define the aftertaste. Very dry and very bitter finish. A little flat and syrupy but a really nice balance of the rye and the hops definitely would purchase this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A malty spicy full bodied beer. This brew is somewhat hoppy, similar to some light to medium IPAs but with a full body. Although the beer boast an ABV of 8%, a strong alcohol taste or smell permeate through the beer."

"Overall - This is the best IPA I've tasted because the taste balance is good and the hops are not overpowering. It is bitter, but not to the extreme. There is still a strong hoppy taste, so I would probably not drink this beer that often, and I am not a huge fan of the hoppy aftertaste. If you like hoppy beers, however, you will probably like this beer."

"A very intimpressive, very enjoyable rye ale. Deeply complex, revealing taste surprises with every sip. The rye stands out from beginning to end, complimenting and not overwhelming the other great aspects of this brew. Definitely malt and grain forward but with plenty of other outstanding sensory components that makes this beer stand above most others."

"Second sampling of this. I had a bomber of it previously and was disappointed, mostly because I was wanting more of an imperial marzen, but I’m finding this is actually closer to that than I'd previously experienced...just with tons of hoppiness. Pours a rusty brown with some cloud to it – I love how Bear Republic’s IPA and now this have some cloud. I’d like to try more of their stuff but those two are all I’ve found in CO. Decent head that breaks down in a couple minutes and laces the glass. Smells hoppy and sweet, with citrus and pineapple to it. The flavor is where the rye comes in, giving it some heartier grain and malt, cherry and light spice, along with the hop bitters. Has a medium mouthfeel, leaning heavy, and the alcohol is present but not offensive, especially for being as up there as it is. Works well with the flavors. Overall, really glad I tried this again. I think the first time I was so affronted by the hops that I couldn’t get past it to enjoy the rye aspects, but this time around, definitely enjoying the combo. Will definitely get this again."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the incredible showcasing of rye grain, with its unexpected smoke and hidden darkness to it in the taste. The grain is so prominent that you actually forget about everything else, especially the hops. That is not to say that the hoppy side is missing, because if you stop and think about it, they are as strong and forward as ever!! This just speaks to how deep and intoxicating the grain bill is here, as it really will take you by surprise if you let it. This is due, in part, to the rich and sweet fruity inclusions that meld so well with the grain bill. In evaluating the hops, they do show an excellent oiliness and variety across the spectrum of flavor, with great dimensionality. In the end, this guy may be a bit booze heavy for some, but it is an undeniable classic that we’ve ignored for far too long, and one of Bear Republic’s best."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, caramel, bread, spicy rye, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pine, caramel, bread, spicy rye, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, caramel, bread, rye, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with moderate rye presence; with a fair amount of malt balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent rye IPA! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"poured a dark amber in color. The mouth feel of this beer is slightly chewy in texture but is very refreshing on the pallet. Has a medium to high hoppy flavour to it with good hints of fruity and citrus tastes. The rye added to this beer gives a very unique taste and aroma. The aroma itself has a slightly heavy quality to it and in the pour it had very little head to it. Due to the taste and aroma however I give this brew a two thumbs up and would recommend this to any drinker who wants to experience a good beer that isn't too harsh, it is a very kind and rewarding drink."
"O - Very good IPA. All the flavors are very well balanced and drinkable. Awesome beer."
"The Hop Rod Rye poured a deep amber with plenty of hops and the sweet rye on the nose. A nicely balanced beer between the hop profile of the Racer 5 and the sweet rye malts. It was very delicately balanced and a nice drinking brew. If you are a fan of the Racer 5, be sure to check out the Hop Rod Rye Ale."

"O - instant favorite of mine. From the first sip this brew became something I will always be able to drink and enjoy. It's just a matter of finding a way of getting it here where I live. Easily 1 of the 10 best tasting brews for me personally I've ever had. It has a bit of everything for it and I'm extremely glad I picked it up. Bear Republic is becoming one of my favorite breweries and I can't even get their brews here. They are definitely pumping out some of the world's best tasting brews and I look forward to getting my hands on more Hop Rod Rye."

"Deep amber, almost red with little to no head to speak of, leaves solid lacing. Aroma of  toasted rye with faint floral hops. Malt and rye hit the tongue first followed by moderate hop bitterness. Medium body with good carbonation, finishes slightly off dry with some lingering hop bitterness. Overall a  good, not great IPA. It's more of a rye beer than a true IPA. I expected more hops."
"Bottle  Appearance: Dark reddish/brown with creamy off-white head  Aroma: Sweet malts, dark fruit  Taste: Pleasant bitterness  Palate: Medium body, with lively mouthfeel. Warm alcohol mid-palate through finish. Drying finish.  Overall: Very tasty complex beer. Bitterness is very present, but not unpleasant."

"I looked at Barnes and Noble, but I just couldn't find the newest issue of Hop Rod Magazine... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of off-khaki foam. The nose comprises pine sap, grapefruit zest, rye spice, and a touch of lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine coming through a tad sharper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a solid, tasty rye-ish IPA, good times despite the relative lack of balance in favor of the hops."

"Overall Impression: Spicy, grainy, and citrusy with a medium bitter finish. Darker and maltier than most American IPAs but the rye also adds a certain spicy quality that using crystal or Munich malt does not. Refreshing but not as much on a hot summer day as a normal IPA. this is much better suited for fall drinking. Overall, delicious and worth drinking again."
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. Dark, amber, hazy color with finger width foamy head that dissipates after 3 drinks. Slight lacing on glass. A very malty smell with hints of pine and caramel. Very malty up front tastes with a nicely balanced hop bitterness at the end. Can taste pine and caramel. Excellent beer!! Definitely one of my favorites!!"
""
""
""
"Poured a deep clear mahogany with a big pillowy light tan head. The head has great retention and leaves sticky lacing. The aroma has a nice blend of caramel sweetness, pine hops and a little peppery spice. The taste is a close mirror of the smell but with just a little bit more depth in all the characteristics. It has a nice weight to the body and an nice bite from the hops and rye on the finish. A nice full flavored beer."

"American IPA or DIPA or rye IPA?!?! Who the hell knows? So judgement based primarily on not pinning it down to a specific style. Great spicy bitterness from the rye and amazing hop presence throughout. Not much balance so I can see why many would not identify it in the DIPA category as a strong malt backbone is required by some to qualify as a good IPA. I can't pin down the style and can easily identify it as all the 3 I mentioned as well as dare I say an American strong ale to boot. Good solid beer my only qualm and it is a small one is I tried this in a 22oz bomber and the mouthfeel and flavor seemed to dissipate on the last 1/2 of the bomber. Not sure if this is available in 12oz bottles but if so I would like to re-visit it in that format. Nonetheless no matter the ""identity"" of this beer it is a very satisfying experience. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all but after finishing it and typing this up it is slightly sneaking up on me. Excellent job Bear Republic!"

"Pours a dark cloudy rusty brown with a large long lasting tan head with very good lacing throughout. Aroma and Taste of floral earthy pine hops, sweet caramel malt, rye flavor with some fruity notes. A medium body on the palate, smooth with good carbonation. Finishes with a combination of sweet caramel malt, floral pine hops for balance with a bit of lingering rye flavor. A very good, flavorful and enjoyable brew."
""
""
"O-This is a tasty brew, and perhaps my favorite from Bear Republic. The hops and rye are the highlights of this show, but they are balanced by a nice base and the flavors, while aggressive, are not out-of-whack or ridiculously showy. I really enjoyed how the spice notes and the citrus notes played together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer, different from what I had tasted so far. You can really taste the rye here differentiating from other IPAs. I did like this one."
"I can't believe I passed so many chances to try this until now. While Racer 5 is my personal favorite, this may be, objectively speaking, the best thing I've had from these guys. None of these flavors conflict with each other, and the rye provides a spicy, rustic flavor that is a breath of fresh air for the style. Extremely well crafted, and world class in the realm of hoppy rye beers. I'd love to have this on tap or fresh one of these days. This is a charm to drink any day of the year on any occasion. Absolutely recommended!"

"Good beer but more of an IPA than a hybrid hoppy/rye. I would have loved to taste more spicy/caramel rye and malt. If you want more malt taste serve very cold from freezer. I was surprised with the rye. I expected more spice. Maybe if they would have aged in oak or something? According to the bottle they used 18% rye so I don’t know. I’m not a brewer."

"Poured into becker pint glass; deep amber with a thin, tight white head that stays. Smells of crackery malts, spicy rye malt and slight piney hops. I'm excited to smell the rye in the forefront; even though it's an IPA, I'm really getting into rye beers lately. Taste is deliciously subdued; this isn't a hop bomb, but it has a nice hoppy flavor at first, melding into rye flavors and then finishing into smooth, caramelized malts with a bitter hop pinch at the very end of the aftertaste. Alcohol is well-hidden for 8%; drinkable and delicious."
"If you like a rye style IPA, this one should be on your list. I have it brought in from adjacent states to MS when ever possible. Excellent brew, and now this bottle is gone! Cheers!"

"First beer I have ever given a perfect score to. This beer will spoil your taste buds, I promise you that. Not sure what they have done here, or how much the rye plays a part, but this is one killer beer, in every respect. If this beer were a little cheaper in cost, it would become my main beer."
"O: Great beer. This was one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. 100s of beers later and this one is still fantastic. I would drink this all day if it weren't so darn high in abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really awesome, lots of rye and sweetness/tartness and some bitterness initially, lots of honey and a slight alcohol burn at the finish. Really enjoying this."
"O - The balance of hops and rye work very well together. Mature beer, appropriate amount of hops, malt, and rye - all well combined, and well distinguished."
""
""
""
""
"Well, you decide!"
""
"A real must try beer. I don’t think I’ve ever had a beer with such a deft combination of hops and a strong rye maltiness. Really interesting, unique, and tasty. I thought the mouthfeel was the only part that left a bit to be desired in an otherwise excellent brew. Memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Showed signs of being an old bottle (lots of yeast, hop aroma/taste a bit muted) but was still decent. Since the cost was so low, I'll give it another shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- My first Bear Rep. Very enjoyable I must say. Not exactly what i expected, but no complaints other than I could have used a little more rye. Call me crazy, but i feel this is a cross between an American Barley Wine and a tasty ESB."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a slow sipper with great balance, I couldn't find a bottling date but imagine mine mig not be the freshest as the hops weren't as prevalent as I would expect. Nonetheless, still a solid IPA"
"O - a very good Rye PA. I haven't had many examples of the style, but this is currently my benchmark."
""
""
"EDIT: Another BA graciously told me where to find freshness data on the bottle. Turns out that despite looking, I couldn't see it in the store. My bottle was nearly 8 months old. I will attempt to secure a fresher bottle and re-review this beer in the future. Until then, my review stands."

"O: I really loved this beer, perfectly balanced, I had this at the Stirling Hotel in NJ, great stuff all around."
"There are subtle notes of caramel apple on the nose while the palate is plastered with a semi-sweet toastiness (rye toast?) that fades with a hoppy rush. (Let’s go to the hop.) If drunk at the proper temperature, this brew provides a well defined balance makes this a surprisingly smooth hot rod to ride. A few quaffs and we are ready to race Bob Falfa out on Paradise Road."
"O: very impressive - forgot this was going to be a rye infused beer - the barley and rye ratio must be spot-on, because this beer was so good tasting, and the layer of IPA-style hops over the malt mix was the perfect compliment"

""

"O - Damn good beer! After writing this review I read a few others and noticed the hoppy flavor seemed a lot more present in theirs than mine. I have no idea how old my brew is, but I'd venture to guess it's been sitting for a bit because that bitterness didn't quite seem to reach the level that everyone else is boasting. Definitely seemed like mine was a mellow version of Jason & the BA reviews. Perhaps another attempt is in order from a more fresh batch."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this one. Not the most drinkable ever, but I love how rich the rye flavors are without killing the balance. A good one to veg over without any aural distractions #foreveralone"
""
""
"O - Overall, This was a good, slow drinking IPA that is closer to a Barleywine in nature. Perhaps slightly below sessionable."
""
""
"Hop Rod is tremendous. Very hop forward, with the rye tasting warmly spicy instead of biting. Also nicely woven in are some nice German style malts that add a touch of euro flavor to this wonderful brew, which in the end retains its west coast ipa character."
""
"Overall: I have to thank myself for buying a four pack, this is quality brewing once again from Bear Republic. Grab a glass and pour one on me...Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer wasn't what I was expecting it to be. I was thinking of a palate wrecking double ryepa. Instead it really drinks more like a slightly hoppy barleywine. It's a good thing though. This beer is freaking delicious, whatever it's supposed to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly full bodied, dry finish, medium effervescence. Cleans the palate nicely. Slightly warming as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. IMO, this would pair really well with some Asian food, curries, and meats. It remains a complex beer and yet is completely drinkable and balnced. All the flavors work harmoniously together. Well done and I'll be hunting these out."
""
""
"Thanks to Treyliff for the try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - 4.0 - Enjoyable and different. I like the richness of it - so flavorful. But still not too overtaxing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer for the price -- excellent value and readily available. Definitely can taste the rye flavoring without being overpowered. Dark coloration... pours easily... and clean aftertaste. Not for drinking everyday... but perfect for watching NASCAR!"
""
""
""
"This was a solid Rye. The onion and mustard seed quality made this beer for me."
""
"O- very good rye pa. Really enjoyable sweet malts, a touch of citrus and nice punch of pine bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: killer beer for the style. Even though it may be alittle hop heavy the rye-malt element dominates adding complexity and balance. beautiful beer!!!"

"O: Good Rye IPA. Seems almost like a double IPA."

""
""
""
""

"Wow! What a well balanced beer. Let me say first that I am a malt, not a hop, fan. This beer is so well balanced with a wonderful spicy alcohol finish. Hop presence is barely there but compliments the malt well. I let it sit out at room temp for about 45 min before I drank it and it was perfect. Get some of this amazing beer today."
""
""
"T: Opens with some rye and earthy hops. A lingering piney hop bite throughout with some toasted malt and charred rye on the finish."
""
""
"The dryness in the end detracts from the beer slightly, but it's pretty different from non-ryed IPAs. Definitely recommend this variation to the style. Everytime I have this beer, it just keeps getting better. The rye and maltiness along with the slight punch of hops sells this beer for me."

"I would probably rate this slightly higher if I was paying US prices for it, but at £3 for a 12oz bottle, I was hoping for a bit more complexity - it's straightforward and delicious but I wouldn't go to great lengths to seek it out again."

"O: Super nice beer. I tried Racer 5 IPA last week and that made me buy this one yesterday. Great decision. This is one of my first rye beers, and if all are like this, it's going to be a favorite style. These guys are making some killer brews!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A great pleaseant feel to this beer and easy drinking."
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly cloudy super dark amber. A sturdy off white head takes a while to disappear leaves sheets of lacing. Nose is typical IPA, pleasant grapefruit, but slightly bready from the unique malts used. First sip is surprisingly mild. The rye malts come through strongly in the middle and the hops aren't as pronounced. In fact this is one of the sweetest IPA's I've had in recent memory. As such the alcohol is almost undetectable. Not a hint of metal or lingering bitterness form the hops, just a really clean finish. Almost ESB-like in its smoothness and balance. Nice hefty body too. An instant favorite, I think! I know I will becoming back to Hop Rod again."

"O: A great Rye IPA; this ale has nice complexity and an interesting palate. Bear Republic shows what ingenuity, creativity, and guts can do when it comes to microbrewing."
"O- I love IPAs and this beer did not disappoint me. It was delicious, well balanced, but not overly sweet. Had a complexity of hop flavors and provided the bite that I always crave. I will have it any chance I get."

"Poured from 22oz bottle into Crooked Stave tulip. Pours a deep amber brown with a finger of head. Big spicy hop and rye aromas...very hot hop aroma. Taste is a bit spicy hop and rye, but quickly mellows out to a really nice brown sugary malt with a great almost sweet hop balance. Some citrus and more pine notes, but mostly sweet sugary malt. Really nice finish and mouthfeel. It smells very aggrestive and ""hot"" but it actually is very well balanced and finishes nice. I typically dont enjoy rye IPA's but this one is an exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I imagine it's best on draught."
""
"OVERALL: This is excellent stuff. Piles of hops here, with a nice malt backbone and some spicy rye as well. Looks and feels good too. This is one I'd be glad to have regular access to, as it's a great example of the style. Cheers for this one Cody. Hope to hang out again!"
""
""
""
""
"O: most impressive selection from Bear Republic as it is new to market. Complexity of an Arrogant Bastard, raisin notes of a boont amber ale, drinkibility and hop profile of a well built imperial red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A strong hoppy IPA that is matched by its sweet malt with a rye kick. This is a beer that should satisfy all hop heads, but is supported by a deep malt backbone. This is a beer I'll have again and again, and have!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This beer is drinkable as is, but very, very disappointing for an IPA. Huge fail, and if not for the reasons of dating, then the beer is a fail in the style in general."
""
"O - Good. Not great. I expected more hop. There is a lot of malt to this, and rye. Its a good beer, I'd buy it again, and if I ever see it at a bar I'll order by the pitcher. Good value as well at <$5/22oz"
"ISO."
""
""
""
"Overall I'd call this a decent beer, definitely not what I ea expecting though. It's more of a malt bomb with a medium hop characteristic. I prefer a more refreshing, easy drinker when I have an ipa."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A nice deep caramel brown with just a slight off white head. A nice fruity aroma on top of a bready and caramel malt base and a little of the rye adding a nice twist. Sweet and bready, citrus, pine, and a nice hit of rye in the finish which seems to fill out and magnify that hit of bitterness. A medium bodied, active mouthfeel. Overall, a very solid brew that continues to get better each time I drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good IPA with a good amount of complexity from the rye, and a good balance between the up-front bitterness and the sweet malty followthrough."
""
""
""
""
"Another drinkable beer from Bear Republic. Nice overall compliment of hop and malt flavors. Sweet and bitter and spicy. Hits everywhere it should and makes winter warmers cry. They wish they were this good."

"Smooth as...."

"Pours a dark burnt sugar/caramel color with a rocky cream head. Head retracts to a frothy cap. Aromatics are quite floral and sweet. Tastes of white wine and general woody notes. Also pick up hints of toast followed by spicy hop finish. Aftertase lingers for a while and is bitter. Mouthfeel is a little pungent but smooth and creamy. Great IPA. Leans toward the bitter opposed to being truly balanced, but it works well with the other flavor characteristics here."
"O: A pretty decent beer, overall. This bottle might be a bit past its prime, but it was stored cold at the store. It's a little heavy and sticky feeling for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this on tap in LA about 5 years ago - wonderful. Found a bottle at Total Wine last night. Please, oh please, stock more of this!"
""
""
""

"It's simple and strait to the point. My kind of beer. You can't beat the flavor for the price, and heck... the abv :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a wild beer. Lots of flavors are battling it out on the palate. It's a little too much, but it's also intriguing. Although I'm not thinking of drinking this every day, it's a fun one once in a while."
""
"Overall: Definitely tasty and a fine brew to kick back and relax with. Don't expect a ton of complexity with it, but it definitely does a good job at what it is. It's also a dangerously drinkable beer at ~8% ABV. Sessionable? I think so."
""
"Drinkability – This is a really nice very easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty brew, although isn't a complex beer to be sure. Solid, glad to have it around."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear red-orange with one finger khaki colored head, a few rings of lace stick to the glass. Smell: grapefruit, resinous pine, caramel, lightly spicy and grainy back, orange citrus note. Taste: caramel, grapefruit rind, orange, spiciness and soft graininess. Creamy feel, medium bodied, juicy, semi-drying finish. This is a killer impy red with a decent rye hit."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Clear, oily, sticky lacing, clearly this one is hopped to holy hell. Light beige head, dark amber in color. Aroma is loaded with hop juiciness, mainly pine and grass and some nice malt sweetness as well. Taste is very smooth, bitter throughout, some grapefruit and nice sweetness in the background on the back end. Insanely drinkable for a high abv, no alcohol anywhere in the tasting. This must be an expensive beer to make, it's clearly loaded up with malt and hops. Awesome."
""
""
"Hop Rod Rye pours a hazy red-brown color with a smaller head. The aroma is outstanding, citrusy hops and spicy rye rule here, along with some caramel malts. The taste is just about tailor made for me - it's got a huge hop kick along with a massive amount of rye spiciness. There's a bit more of a pine flavor in the hops than the nose let on, which works excellently with the rye. This is a big and brash beer, which is perfect for me. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has that hop dryness that can only come from a massive amount of hops. The drinkability is superb. Overall, Hop Rod Rye is really a beer that's just about tailor-made for me. I love rye beers and huge IPAs. This is an excellent beer that really offers the best of both worlds there."

"O: It's really good, extremely sweet, yet so bitter, it balances its self out, very sweet, very bitter, should be on your want list if it isn't already."
""
""
"Opened a 22oz bottle, I can smell the hops from here pre-pour. Poured into a tulip glass, unknown bottled date. This pours a hazy yeast filled mahogany brown with a large tan head which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of nice caramel malts, rye, fruit. The feel is medium to thicker. The taste is good, nice balance of hops and malts, you get a spicy amount of rye, some bitter hops followed by a nice semi sweet caramel finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall great drinking beer. Nice combination of hops and rye. Not a common IPA style. Bear Republic does a great job with all their beers but this one stands out in front of their lineup of products. Cheers!"
"O: this is an awesome beer, great use of everything, and the hop flavor is delicious, I live rye ipa's and this one is deffinatly towards the top of my list."
"been meaning to get on this one for awhile. this is a monster beer. hands down one of the most hoppy and most complex rye beers ive had. it pours a deep indian brown color with just a bit of haze. looks pretty dense, with some light coming through, but not much. theres about a one inch off white head on it, but it recedes pretty quickly. the nose is very very hoppy. sticky sweet dank hops, oily and aggressive. theres also some spice from the rye, bready and pungent, as well as a darker sweeter malt profile than i expected when i bought it. the flavor is unreal. so much going on. at first sip its a hop trip, high alpha and mean, but that gets interrupted fairly quickly by a really distinct and different peppery rye flavor that comes out of nowhere and lasts the rest of the time. sweeter malt kicks up at the end, and the bitter aspect of the hops finally comes back. the finish is long and complex. this is a gem as far as flavor journey goes, more rye heavy than any ive had i think. mouthfeel is good, big and thick on the body, with enough carbonation to make it dangerously drinkable. there is some hop resin left in the mouth though that is a love it or hate it kind of thing. i think it makes the beer come across a bit heavy, but thats just me. this is a perfect cold weather beer, with all the necessary elements. high abv, big hop, lots of body, and stick to your guts malt. this is worth the hype for sure."
"O - For a rye beer this is a must try with a lot of positive aspects to it. I do wish Bear Republic would get with it and date their bottles. Not sure how fresh my bottle is however it is really enjoyable none the less. One that I will revisit when in the mood for a great Rye IPA. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: solid brew all the way around. It has a nice balance in both the nose and in the taste and has the right amount of complexity for this style."
""
""
"O: Lot going on in this beer. In your face. Very unique and well crafted. I would prefer more late boil hops than early boil (more hop flavor, less bitterness) but I quib. Extremlely rye forward, must try for any craft beer fan."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent IIPA rye beer."
"O: I am really impressed by this beer, just happened to pick this up as I had not tried it before and I am glad I did. This will be a must have in the future."
"O...I would have liked a little more hops presence in this beer since hop is in the name. That being said, it was very enjoyable. I really liked the nutty sweetness in this brew. Heavy alcohol (8%) was not noticable. Nicely balanced. I will buy again."
""
""
"Light brown head with a good lacing and a slightly hazy reddish amber fluid. Smell is very sweet with lots of caramel and toffee. A healthy amount of bakery bread and pine forrest along with a citrus grove spiciness. Light sweet alcohol. Taste is so big, malty and smooth at first. Then BAM hops hit like a velvet fist with a lovely grapefruit and hop oil finish. This is full of spicy rye bread and malt to give it a nice chewy flavor and overall feel. Finish is quite nice with dry graininess and a light minty grapefruit. Feel is lightly syrupy and chewy with a nice smooth carbonation. A great robust beer that rewards sipping but begs you to keep it up so seductively that the glass is empty before you know it. Very drinkable and no real notice of the abv so watch out. Simply one of the best I've had."

"An incredibly easy drinking beer."

"No head really with nice lacing on a brownish amber with slight golden hues. Aroma is a little light with caramel, citrus hops and candied orange. Flavor is actually pretty complex with both toasted and caramel malts, rye breads, orange peel, red apples, candied fruits, earthy hops and a mild pine presence. Medium body and moderate carbonation. I like the Fruitness which isn't too sweet with and excellent base malt and rye character."

"O-Not just the best rye beer I have ever had, but one of the best period."
""
""

"Favorite Rye Beer thus far. Smell is very bready and floral. Smells like a brewery (In a good way). Taste is very much the same. Rye comes through nicely, well balanced pretty drinkable. Just delicious. Great mouthfeel and color as well. If you have not tried it just go get it."

"O - Getting a fix of rye beers, and this one is just as enjoyable. Perfect change-up to all the IPA & APA's on the taps."
"Hayward Abbey Rating: 98"

"O – This beer is outstanding. It’s like a good DIPA, but the added rye makes it more unique. This beer really has very few flaws. It looks and smells amazing, tastes great, and has a terrific mouthfeel. Add the fact that it is insanely drinkable for a hop-loaded rye beer at 8% ABV and you have yourself a winner. Awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would have like a touch more hops in there to balance out the sweetness of the malts and the spiciness of the rye, but overall it is a nicely crafted rye beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So in short, another excellent, dynamic, but well-balanced beer from The Republic of Bear. Definitely check it out if you are a fan of big but well-balanced beers."
""
""
""
""
"Though pricey, this IPA is well balanced. Strong hoppy taste that is not too bitter to a point where it takes you awhile to get through one. Citrus apple accents? Won't pretend that I am that much of a connoisseur, but I do love beer. Definitely try this, especially if you love IPAs... you will not regret it."
""
""
""
"The beer pours with a generous off-white head and a dark amber body. Before I even stuck my nose in the glass I could smell the beer, it's pugnant and fruity. As soon as the beer touches your lips, you are overwhelmed with the distinctive rye taste. Despite this strong taste, the aftertaste of the beer is pleasantly smooth and even. The mouthfeel is great and very palpable."
""
"Bitter grapefruit and bitter rye followed by the sweet ruby red notes flowing into sweet caramel notes with a biscuity mouth feel pulling back to a dry finish with some sweetness lingering. A nice big flavor-packed beer that keeps a sense of balance despite its aggressive hop profile."

"First of all, I'm not sure how old this bottle is. Got it in WI and that's a ways from CA, so who knows. Pours a dark red/brown, lots of clarity; sticky head. Smell is sweet rye with faint hops. Taste - first thing that struck me was a definate note of buckwheat honey. This is probably the mix of the sweet malt and darker rye malt but if you've ever had buckwheat honey, it has a very distinct flavor that is what this beer reminds me of. Also notes of toffee and very nicely balanced hops. Mouthfeel is slick and coating, goes down smooth. Rated the best Rye beer for a reason. Wide distribution and reasonable price point makes this one that I think will be a constant in the cooler."
""
""
""
""
""
"The careful marriage of hops, malt and rye provide for an interesting and unique experience, another winner from Bear Republic."
"Overall: A nicely made American IPA, addition of rye makes for a very interesting beer. Unfortunately in Australia, the price is far too high at AU$130 a case (2012). An occasional indulgence."

"A very tasty rye beer here with a multitude of flavors in it. Goes down quite well for its ABV."
""
"First stop on NoCal microbrew vacation in Jul 2011. Perhaps that tainted my perspective, but I truly enjoyed this beer. Reddish-amber color, zesty hoppy nose, solidly bitter without going completely over the top, full but dry (from the rye I suppose) mouthfeel, and lasting finish. Honestly made it difficult for me to order a different beer for my second round."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very complex and interesting beer, maybe one of the most complex I've ever had. Not for your average beer drinker. It is enjoyable though. Sip and contemplate this beer. Would pair great with food."
""
""
"Overall, very good indeed! Enjoyed it a lot."
""
"overall this is a pretty good example of a rye ale. very tasty, very well balanced, and very deceiving - no idea this was 8%.. had to do a double take!"
""
"this one poured a bit flat... don't know what the brew date was... smell and taste are still there... so i'm not sure this is the best one to review... but I've had it before and will rely on reputation... the mouthfeel is above average... I like this beer a lot and would never turn it down..."

"Edit: I'd add that subtle, but clearly present, dark fruits emerge as you drink and the tulip warms."
""

"Overall an outstanding Rye that I will add to my regular list"
""
"O: A really nice, big rye beer at 8% ABV. It strays from the Rye-PA most folks are used to, but is still pretty liberal with the hops. Perhaps it's just my perception, as the complex malts and careful balance steal the show here. I'd get it again, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a VERY good Rye beer! I will keep this one in my memory bank as one to purchase from time to time."
""
""
"Overall - This beer gets high marks, but frankly I find it a tad boring. It's got all the elements, but for whatever reason they just don't work for me. Maybe it's the dryness. I'd rather have a SN Ruthless Rye."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has an amber, malty color with quite nice foam retention. A malty sweetness rounds out the aroma and there’s a good amount of dark, malty sweet notes on the flavor, along with an evident bitterness and a rye spiciness on the finish.. I am thinking of caramel malts, almost like a barleywine-ish “lite” sort of feel and finish—not to mention appearance. Hops on this have either faded considerably or were not as prominent as I remembered. A classic West Coast IPA and one of the first rye beers I drank on a regular basis."
""
"O - Excellent beer, must try more from Bear Republic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is brown, nearly the color of iced tea, with a light tan head. Not a particularly attractive beer upon pouring, but lacing is very good. Hops dominate the smell, with citrus and pine. The taste is more balanced - caramel sweetness from malts, spiciness from rye, bitterness from hops all combine for an interesting flavor profile. Piney hops are more noticeable than other flavors. Mouthfeel is prickly on the tongue. Very enjoyable, and one of the better rye beers I've had."
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer. I need to try more ryes before I'm sold on them in general."
"O: An excellent beer, far better than I remember it being. Recommended, and would drink again, though not what I typically expect from a Rye IPA (less spicy-dry, more thick-sweet)."
""
"M - Medium body. Tingling but not too prominent carbonation--lets the flavors shine through. Minimal booziness. Leaves my tongue feeling slightly sticky, but the rye balances things out nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the aroma was a bit misleading. Hops are definitely the stars of this brew, accentuated by a bready malt and rye bitterness. Not a big rye fan, but the citrus hops are favorable."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another nice brew from BR. I was very hesitant to try this beer since I am not a fan of rye but this was a great beer. It tastes like what I thought Ruthless Rye was going to be like. I plan on buying this frequently and at 3.49 for a bomber I can't go wrong!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this brew. Not at all what I expected from a hoppy rye bomb. Extremely smooth for this style, and that's what makes it good imo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first rye beer that's really impressed me. The combination of strong spicy rye and grassy hops makes for a really varied tune of grainy notes. I like it."

"Medium body, good carbonation too that generally works in hoppy beers. Glad to drink it finally."
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep copper red with a large, creamy white head. Funky rye smell mixed with piney hops, some grapefruit, resinous tones, aromatic as hell. Mostly IPA here, rather than rye, with a nice up front grapefruit bitter that fades into some sweet toffee malts, and then finishes with a VERY light rye spiciness. Resinous palate with medium high carbonation and way too easy drinking for 8%. Very nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes sort of bitter, peppery with a thin mouthfeel. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, but it does sort of come through. An interesting beer. I do start to like it more and more as I drink it, but not my favorite."
""
"Overall this is a good showcase of rye malt with an IPA twist, maybe not an everyday go-to beer but still a solid product."
"Pours a deep brownish amber with a small tan head that dissipates quickly, but leaves excellent lacing as you drink. The smell is almost all bready nutty malt tones. This is mirrored in the taste, although there is some resin flavor in the finish. The nouthfeel is sticky sweet, but I would've liked a little more carbonation, which was on the lower end of the spectrum. Overall an enjoyable beer. I was expecting more obvious rye, and a little bit more hops to counter the heavy malt charter. I also would have liked a little bit more carbonagion. I was underwhelmed with this one at firdt. However, I definately noticed myself enjoying this one more and more as I sipped it. A very solid offering from Bear Republic."
""
""
"o - solid beer overall and quite enjoyable. glad i found a local store that has this in stock as i will be picking up more sooner than later."
"O/D - Couldn't have two of these but the character of the beer was quite good. Spciciness of the rye seemed a bit rich, but otherwise, a nice and strong hopped up rye beer."
""
""
""
""
"Deep copper color with a minimal light beige head that leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Pine aroma dominates with some spices I cant identify and a slight citrus. The taste up front malty, with a nice kick of hops in the center and finishes with a gorgeous weave of rye and spice. A medium mouthfeel of cream."
"A pretty good beer. The only other rye I tried was the Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye, but this was much better. Good beer."
""
""
"From a bomber into a duvel tulip. Pours a medium brown with a small head that quickly shrinks leaving behind decent lacing. Aroma is citrus, caramel, and rye. Flavor is somewhat bitter with caramel and toffee notes. The rye grain comes through pretty strong. The mouthfeel is medium to lighter an it leaves a nice bitter rye taste. Good rye beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent and supremely well balance brew... definitely recommended..."

"Overall: A great beer that I plan to keep stocked up on."

"O - I don't drink many rye beers, but if I do, I am a bit particular. This is one of the best rye beers I have come across, bar none. The flavors balance well and the rye is well represented. Another great Bear Republic beer. I'm glad I picked this one up and I will definitely get it again."
""
"Brown body with an offwhite head quality lacing. Strong aroma of hops(pine). Starts out dry and hoppy with a nice complement of rye and malt. Finshes bitter and hoppy with just a trace of tea leaves. Overall a nice beer where the rye a malt add balance, preventing this from becoming overally hopped."
""
""

"I dont know why it took me so long to try this beer. Really good."
"see you on the next one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep copper color with a fair bit of floaties and a thin light tan head. The aroma's a pungent mixture of sweet caramel and spicy/citrus hops. The malt profile plays a prominent role in the taste - sweet toffee, bready, and spicy flavors are all present. The big malt body is balanced by a fair amount of piney/citric bitterness which seems to hit hard at first then mesh nicely with the malt leading to a long, pleasant balanced finish. The rye is detectable and lends a nice layer of spicy earthy complexity to the malt profile but doesn't overwhelm the beer. This full-flavored ale is also moderate to full-bodied with a slightly creamy and oily mouthfeel. I fear this may have spent a bit of time on the store shelf before I picked it up, but it still proved to be a great rye beer."
""
""
"O - Loved it, not a rye DIPA which others may be looking for but a SOLID rye IPA. Deff will be buying again."
""
"Mouthfeel is generally not as carbonated as I like it but it is very refreshing. Light to medium bodied with very little carbonation. For some reason it suits the flavor profile. I""ll definitely get this again- rate it up there with Red's Rye PA."
"O- this is a pretty good beer. I enjoyed it. I'll have to try a few more rye beers, pretty new to the rye game. Only had surlyfest besides this."
"O: overall, i like this beer. I would drink it again and would like to try an even fresher beer. I believe this was from September 2011."
""
""
""
"Not so bitter, I'd have to call it a notched-down IPA. Carbonation isn't so aggressive, same goes for the hops. Seemed to be a one note brew here. Maybe I'm just not that into rye, it is sorta floral and sorta spicy but I'm not picking up much sweetness. Hop Rod's not offensive, but it's not terribly interesting either."
"Taste is a sweet malty base, with what I guess is the rye malt that adds a slightly nutty taste and what I would describe as wild rice, maybe even some light husk. Though not astringent. The bitterness is not too high like an average IPA. It goes well with the malt. The hops are really balanced. They add an exotic taste that has pineapple, mango and some grapefruit."

""
""
""
"The taste is of a nice combination of bitter hops with malt sweetness always having a presence. The rye spiciness fills the middle and really gives this beer a nice kick. It finishes slightly dry but again, the malt never leaves the scene. This is another stellar offering from Bear Republic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brownish amber with a foamy off white head. Lots of hops and malts in the aroma and flavor. I did not get much, if any, in the way of rye (which might be a good thing). The finish is balanced and good. Nice clean finish with a strong emphasis on the rye aspect."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a mixed beer of the month club six pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice reddish hue with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of hops and floral notes, with a slight smell of rye. Tastes of darker malt and rye, with with a nice bite from the hops that add a bit of a citrus tone. Has good carbonation and goes down easily and without any aftertastes. Overall, a very good, and very close to exceptional beer."
""
"Taste is really smooth, with the hops and carbonation coming in towards the middle, and hanging out after the rye disappears with the liquid like two strangers who meet half way through a decent party, then have a great conversation and decide to go out for drinks when the host runs out of good liquor and the lame co-workers take over the iPod playlist. Overall, a winner."
"Overall an enjoyable beer. Little bit one note though in the grape/spice thing. I'll always be generous with intensely hoppy beers regardless."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I love this beer Bear Republic has some really great enjoyable beers, and this is one of them"
""
"O: Nice complexity and nice balance in the smell as well as the flavors. I really enjoy rye beers and this is a great example. I could drink many of these and hope to do so in the future."

""
"This is a great beer. The ranking is well deserved. On top of all that, this beer is very accessible."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is a little rough in the finish but is still very enjoyable. The body is a bit on the thicker side for a beer of this style but never becomes sticky or coating. The carbonation is a little light and does not really help this beer's drinkability. A bit more carbonation would certainly go a long way here."

""
"I don't know what else to say? If I could drink one beer, and one beer only, this would be the one. tribute to the brewers art."
"O - A unique and tasty offering. Definitely a great representation of a rye beer. Had I not known the ABV beforehand, I'd even say it was sessionable; however, this beer is deceptive and will definitely creep up on you after a few. And I would recommend having quite a few. Well done."

"O - Must say Bear Republic did a great job with this one. Perfectly balanced & not a bad price. This is a must have for any beer enthusiast!"
"Looks like a dark beer when you pour it, says the critic. Fortunately everything else about it is very good. Malt, hop, and sugar are the first things I smelled. The flavor was smooth, and this with a nice balance of bitter and tang that follow a malty experience. I've always liked the flavor and experience of this beer, from a great brewery too. A great find!"

"Overall: A nice twist on the Rye/IPA style. Big rye, bright citrusy hops, subdued malt character and easy to consume."
"Overall a solid beer from BR. I love Racer 5, which is a better beer, but this is a solid go to."
"Overall - Very good American IPA but the bitterness lingers too long in aftertaste for me to really love this beer. I can revisit this one plenty in future however."
"Appearance has a rich amber color with minimal head leaving spotty lace. Smell of rich malt, dark fruits and a rye note in the back. Taste has an upfront dark bread rye, rich malt, piney, grapefruity and a good spike of balanced hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Maybe my first rye beer and it's very enjoyable."
"Overall: A unique balance in between an IPA and a DIPA. Clearly a passion at work within this brew."
"This is a delightful rye beer, very enjoyable to drink. A well balanced combination of rye malt and hops. Best rye beer I've had."
"Solid fairly complex and incredibly well balanced beer. Neither the hops, malt or rye are overdone, yet all make a nice presence."
"This brew poured out as a dark amber color, mostly brown in specific lighting. The heas was nice looking and tan in color. The smell of the beer was more hoppy than anything else I could pick up on the nose. The taste of the beer was also quite hoppy, I was hoping to pick up on some more Rye than anything else but I continue to struggle with picking up the Rye in most beers. The aftertaste is bitter and yet sweet almost all at once. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty nice, well carbonated, stings the tongue a bit, leave a bitterness on the sides of the mouth. Overall this beer was pretty good."
"O-a great IPA with excellent flavor and balance"
"Overall this is an awesome beer and one that I would never guess is 8% abv. It is extremely balanced. Wish it was available where I live."
"O - I always enjoy this beer and it's combination of rye spice and hops."
"Very nice. Interesting juxtaposition of flavours and nicely balanced. Bravo!"
"Overall - I'm easy to please when it comes to rye beers, but this is still outstanding in its field. A great hop profile of an IPA, perfect balance of caramel malt base for a pale ale, rye used as a spotlight spice, and the sweet tones laced within a bitter back end make this one of the best you can ask for. This is my fallback rye, and a bit of a standard for measurement."
"Wow, what took me so long to try this. Pours a nice two inch head into my chalice, brown sugar colored foam and rich dark brown body. Smell the malty richness with pine needle accents. Taste is very complex for this rich IPA. Malty carmel not any rye bread taste, thankfully, but bread like as far as the body of this beer goes. A wonderful hop sandwich with a suntan. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodies, better than a stout. Overall one of my favorite American IPA and certaijnly challenges Arrogant Bastard for best in show. WIll be seeking this one out for future mini sessions."
"O: This is interesting, I'll give it that. I am impressed. This is a serious IPA that deserves respect. Quite delicious."
"The beer is good, but not great. It’s just average, and for a rye I expected more. The aftertaste almost brought me back over the top, but can’t save those initial bubbles. The beer does have a big ABV, and while that is not obvious, after a few of these, and an 8% ABV, you will feel them when you stand up. With a label like that, I wanted more. Not upset, just wanted more. Either way, wherever you are tonight, bottoms up!"
"D: 8% is quite high for me at this point, been drinking a lot of session beers. This, however, is quite palatable and easily drinkable. Great beer overall."
"O - I would have written a more descriptive review but Im pressed for time. Bear Republic nailed this beer in every sort of way. Go buy one now."
"O- A good effort that I enjoyed quite much. I wouldn't necessarily put it in the very upper levels of beerdom, but it is still definitely worth a try."
"I've had so many opportunities to try this, but I've somehow missed it time after time. Now that it is finally distributed in Rhode Island, I knew that I needed to get some. This really is a great beer. It's surprisingly balanced, with an interesting sweetness that is perfectly in the gray area between ""sweet"" and ""too sweet."" Overall, however, I think I still prefer Racer 5."
"D: Nicely balanced, this is a well crafted brew. ABV is well masked, so I could have many of these at once. Job well done from Bear Republic."
"Similar in flavor and character to Founders Red's Rye Ale, but a bit more malty. Absolutely top-shelf brew with plenty of added rye and hop balance. Me likey. A very solid ""A" rated brew and one that will certainly be a regular in my rotation."
"Heck of a good beer, with aroma being the only place this is anything less than stellar."
"O: Wow – This beer blew me away. A hoppy rye brew with a 8% abv! Love it!"
"O: 3.5."
"O - This taste more like an Imperial IPA than an American IPA, but I like Imperial IPA's. Depending on what you were looking for, though, this might not be your perfect ""American IPA."" That might sound like a strange comment, but hey, just trying to put this beer in context. It reminds in some ways of Hop Czar from Bridgeport, but with a tastier malt/rye background. I like this beer a lot and would recommend it. It's not one that I will usually pick over others, but I get why this is so popular. Try it!"
"Overall - Very solid IPA. It wasn't outstanding, but it was just a very well constructed beer."
"O: Overall a very good IPA. The great aroma stands out particularly. American IPAs are one of my favorite styles, and although this isn’t the best one I’ve had (my top 2 being Sculpin and Stone) it is very good in its own right and certainly worth a try. I recently had Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA, and I think this one is far superior. Definitely worth checking out."
"This is great. Perfect balance, nice hop character, intense, smooth malt character. Nicely done Bear Republic."
"O- A good offering that is basically a more hoppy rye beer. Not my favorite rye beer, but another good year-round brew from Bear Republic."
"O - One of the best AIPA's I'll ever have (I'm sure of it!). I would highly recommend that any beer lover try this and go out of their way to find it!"
"This one poured a lot darker than I was expecting. It has an unfiltered haze to it along with a nice big, tan head. The nose is most notably sugary, but the hops and the grains come through as well. I haven’t had many ryes, so I am still figuring them out. I do feel a difference in the body. For an 8% beer, it seems like this beer should be much heavier; somehow the rye has a less oppressive presence than a heavy malt version. The beer is very caramely, but then bitter hops to follow to round this one out. I cannot get over the clean feeling this beer has in the aftertaste. This brew boasts a great aroma, crisp yet complex flavor, and a clean bite finish…easy drinker considering. Note: This beer only contains 18% rye, so it isn’t a dominant flavor."
"Pours a very nice ruby red with a bit of a purplish hue in there as well. Slight off-white head. Aroma of pine hops, hints of citrus and big bready and caramel notes. Flavor beings with bittering pine hops before moving to to sweeter grapefruit notes. Huge, thick caramel malt comes next and stays until the finish. Hints of black cherry and raisin as well add to this really big malt that battles with, but complements this well-hopped brew. Spiciness and more bittering pine hops finish this one out with some rye shining through late and more as it warms. Really thick, substantial, yet drying mouthfeel."
"O- The perfect blend to encourage easy drinkability. Alcohol seems like it should be there but isn't."
"What can I say? An exceptional beer. Very wet at first then turning to a dry finish. Mouthfeel is not too carbinated. Citrus and piney flavors along with a deep caramel. Very drinkable as are most of the Bear Republic line. If you love hops, you can't go wrong with this one. Cheers."
"D-"
"M: malty with piny grapefruit finish back of the tongue"
"O: Outstanding IPA. Darker, richer and more balanced than I am used to."
"O: What a ride! I would have never guessed that this beer would have fit my exact taste profile so perfectly, but it most certainly did. Hoppy yet sweet, roasty yet fruity; this really should be a more powerful force in the beer world. Hop Rod Rye is destined to go down as one of my “desert island beers,” and that is not something I take lightly. Keep ‘em coming, Bear Republic."
"The taste starts with a lot of sweet caramel malt, and a lot of rye grains, some brown sugar, into some nice hops, probably some Zeus hops along with the more common west coast varieties. Nice citrus, grapefruit, floral and bittering elements. Medium bodied and wet."
"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep amber with tightly bubbled 3/4 inch head. This beer is beautiful to watch as rivulets of lacing cascade down after each sip. Caramel aroma with citrus hops. Very well balanced malt profile hides the 8% alcohol nicely with fantastic pine/citrus hop blend. Really like the way this dances lightly on the front of the tongue but finished off rather thick. Overall I'm a big fan of this beer and Bear Republic. At 8%, I'm not sure why this isn't considered an Imperial IPA. Maybe the most impressive aspect of this beer is the price - a world class Imperial IPA at $4.99 a bomber!"
"Overall this is a very good and intriguing beer. To me it tastes like a good American Strong Ale with a shot of bourbon thrown in for good measure. While I can't say I'll drink on a regular basis, I will recommend it to any one looking to try a different tasting strong ale, or any fan of rye beers. Cheers!"
"Poured the no dated bottle into my 13 oz tulip. A rust red, with a fluffy white head, plenty of lacing. Smell is mild pine, a little flower, and a little breadyness. Taste is all that, a little subdued, but good. Easy drinking for it's abv, wish I new the age of this beer. I think it may be on the older side, for a hop head like myself. Nice body, would like a little more life in it. This is solid, but wanted more out of it. Will definitely get some again."
"O: really interesting twist on the American IPA style. Pretty abv for the style, and fairly well masked. And for 2.59 it was a steal for a custom six pack."
"O: I don't know why it's taken me this long to try any beers from Bear Republic, but after this offering, I will be tasting many more from them soon."
"A slightly chilled bottle is split between two pint glasses. Big brown head tops a dark copper liquid. Some visible carbonation. There's a very pleasing aroma of citrus hops and rye. Very good flavor! Bitter throughout, but never too strong. I'd describe the hops as having citrus and pine characteristics. Rye is tasted and gives a good kick. Despite the higher ABV, there is any taste of alcohol. It goes down very easily without much coating. What is left behind has some rye spiciness that I like. Overall, this is a very impressive beer. It's too bad I can't buy this locally. I'd keep some on hand at all times."
"O- A unique brew, definitely glad to have the experience. Don't know that this would be one of my go-to beers, but I will surely enjoy one from time to time. I would certainly recommend it."
"This beer pours a nice reddish color with a big off white head that lasts a while, laces the glass as it recedes and leaves a cap on the beer. the smell is definitely hoppy up front pine and fruit notes, followed by the rye malt aroma. the flavor follows suit lots of hop flavor and rye malt with a nice bitter finish and a little bit of fullness form the malt. mouthfeel is definitely a little more than i was expecting but it works. overall a very very good beer."
"O - Yawn, not so much to be excited about here."
"O: Umm...In my amateur opinion, this is the greatest beer in the world. I can't imagine improving it in any fashion. Some folks may ask for a stronger flavor, but not me. I love this brew and I recommend to everybody!"
"O: This is a keeper!! Abundantly available here, even in the groceries, It is reasonably priced and a real hop-hog. I like this beer to no end!! At 8% ABV, almost a DIPA and a sessionable on at that!! To the bear I say: RRROOOAAARRR!!!"
"O: Really impressed, this is a well crafted beer that does a ton of stuff right. The nose and appearance are all decent but then Bear Republic kicks it up a notch with the taste and mouthfeel. Just top notch stuff in my opinion."
"Final thought - bear republic, I love you. 8% and only $4, noire!"
"Awesome beer."
"Probably the best beer I've had since Arrogant Bastard Ale a couple of months ago. Worth the price of this bottle!"
"D: not to get too caught up in classifications, i wouldnt exactly call this beer an AIPA. however it is still a tasty, unique brew with the added complexity of the rye and heavily hopped body."
"O- A great offering from Bear Republic. These guys do the middle-of-the-road amber style ale with great precision and offer individualistic flavor profiles in each (red rocket, etc.). This one is very balanced with a great fruity hop flavor and spicy malt finish."
"O: balanced, yes. This is a very solid beer. I will definitely have it again if I can."
"O: i enjoy the brew, nice warmth to it, smooth, great depth, great representation of the style"
"I'm happy to say Bear Republic never disappoints! Well worth a try, you'll be happy you did."
"O: Overall this is a very well brewed beer, with a great balance of rye, malt and hops. This is a very good show case of the hoppy rye red from the west coast."
"One of my old school favorites..It's been quite some time, so let's give it a whirl. Coppery, sexy, yes. Citrus, booze, caramel, and pine on the nose. Don't remember it being this boozy smelling. Definitely can taste the alcohol as well. Bitterness comes first then the malt, bringing some caramel and booze, followed by citrus hop finish with a twist of rye. Surprisingly alcoholic. I guess I didn't know it was 8% before..Those crazy Californians. Probably won't get another bottle of this til I know it's a different batch. Not knocking it too hard because of my past with it until I have another try."
"Well worth seeking out."
"Very nice rye beer with a hoppy slap. Not quite what I would call an IPA though."
"O: a damn good IPA (i.e. Hop Monster). the 18% rye mix seems to lend all compliments and no distractions to this unique California ""specialty"" ale."
"o: probably my favorite rye beer to date. everyone should enjoy."
"I had this beer this week for the first time, and i was very pleased by it. I bought it in the bottle and poured it into a pint glass. The appearance was very amber brownish with a nice light brown whitish head on it . It had a nice refined taste to it of barley malts and hops on the front end followed by more hops and a hint of citrus. There was a fair amount of lace left on the glass when i was finished. Overall this beer was one of the best rye's I've had and im looking forward to trying a lot more of the bear republic line!"
"Find a way to try this beer if you love IPA’s."
"I think Bear Republic makes some fantastic beers and this is no exception. A hoppy amber that offers up something pleasantly different with just enough Rye in the grist."
"Pours a deep red, with some nice mahogany hues. An offwhite head of a couple fingers forms, leaving some nice lacing and moderate retention. Nose holds rye, tropical fruits and some grapefruit. A beautiful malt profile, holding rich caramel, rye bread and graham cracker notes. Taste has again some nice rye and caramel character, bitter grapefruit and orange again. Strong lingering bitterness. Good full mouthfeel, light to moderate alcohol notes and exceptional drinkability, a sort of IPA+ due to the ABV. Quite excellent and I can only imagine this being divine on tap, as I believe freshness may have detracted from the fulll experience here."
"The feel is a little sticky with decent carbonation. A little heavier than I would like. Overall not to bad here. Nothing really exciting. The rye is good but the other flavors are simply underwhelming."
"O: Good beer although I was surprised to see this in the IPA category. I would have pegged this as a hopped up red ale. At any rate, this is a very tasty beer that I'd be happy to drink again."
"This is an exceptionally hoppy beer. I have yet to try any other bear republic beers, but this is certainly a good start. Strong and hoppy, it fits the standards I set for a beer well, and has an attractive dark color. I have had smoother beers, but overall it goes down relatively smooth with a hint of carbonation (but not so much as to make my stomach bubble). I have had better beers, but this is certainly fairly high on my list."
"Overall: A very good west coast style hop bomb. Take a very good IPA, add some rye and more hops to make it super bitter; you'll get this masterpiece."
"O-Very nice and balanced beer here, definitely not a 6 pack beer but a bomber here and there would be nice...love this beer..."
"Definitely a big boy, but not over the top as some IPAs can be. The rye adds a lot. I couldn't pound these one after another, but it is nice to sip and enjoy one."
"Damn, this beer hit the spot. Flawless execution of a rye IPA. I was at first skeptical of the high ratings of this beer, but this brew sure can back it up. Highly worth checking out."
"Appearance is a dark brown body with a good sized head. HRR has a smell filled with rye, bread, some mango or other fruit too. Taking a sip from my pint glass and I am hit with some malts and hops, first off. From there, there is a sweetness from citrus and maybe some caramel. More malt and some bitterness also hits the palate. MF is med-heavy. Alcohol content on this one can easily sneak up on you, it is well hidden."
"O. Whoever built this beer knew what they were doing. Comparing to style guidelines it's up there with the best. On a personal level it's absolutely one of my favourites."
"A decent beer but I’m not digging it. It lacks depth and clarity. The hops and the malt create something a bit muddy. Prefer it in the bottle."
"Overall Drinkability - Good, balanced, strong ESB. Regardless of what they want to call it. Good IPA gateway to ESB's or vice versa."
"O - Absolutely fantastic IPA. Huge hoppiness dwells swelly well with rye spicyness"
"O: Tasty brew. I haven't had this one for a a while, but will now try to seek this one out more often."
"It's been a while since I've been this impressed with a beer. Very good stuff."
"A great beer, and one of my first loves."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and has been made by someone who truly appreciates the craft of craft brewing. It's not a beer for everyone, though, as evidenced by, if nothing else, the fact that the liquid is so bitter and tart--75+ IBUs, and that doesn't include the effects of the rye--that when left in the mouth for several seconds (as it is when, for instance, the drinker is writing a review of it) the tongue numbs and tingles. But enthusiasts who don't mind a good bit of bitterness should give this one a try."
"O- Brilliant marriage of hop bitterness, malt sweetness, and rye spice. All the mouthfeel, color, and sweetness of a brown ale; with a bright hop flavor. I imagine I'll be back to the beer store sometime this week to pick up another 4 pack. Worth every penny. Find it; drink it."
"O - Yeah, have yet to have a bad Bear Republic beer. Didnt enjoy as much as som eof their other ales though."
"O: Absolutely awesome. I really like this beer. It is different from any IPA I have tried. This is one I look forward to order quite often."
"Notes: Complex, yet very well-balanced, this brew has got it all. Medium to full-bodied, and has a mouthfeel and finish that lasts forever. It's awesome stuff! Easily my favorite offering from Bear Republic that I have had thus far."
"Tastes of heavy hearty rye pumpernickel bread at first, joined up by the bittering wave of a standard hop bomb of boiled pine sap and grapefruit pith. I've not had a beer like this in quite some time which wears its ""Rye-ness"" on it's sleeve so proudly. I would even call it -educational- for providing an easily identifiable textbook example of what Rye malt should taste like. Spicey, earthy goodness all around with a heavy wallop of bittering. I'm OK with this."
"M - Thickness from the malt and creaminess in general. Delicious."
"O- A very unique IPA that is hard to pin down. It is good, but not the same league as Racer 5. Maybe the bottle has some age on it, but with no dating I'll never know."
"O: Interesting IPA made with 20% rye malt."
"Pours a deep amber, a finger of light stone colored foam. Nice retention and solid sheets of lacing. Smells like spicy rye, malt, piney hops, and lemon. Taste is a bready rye with some lemon, finishing moderately bitter. I don't know if the hops are supposed to be this restrained, or if this is just an older bottle. In any case, I was expecting more hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium-full body and medium carbonation. Overall, this was pretty good, but a heftier dose of hops would take this to another level."
"Overall a very solid beer - don't usually drink rye beer but couldn't really tell it apart from any other really good IPA. Would buy this more often if I could!"
"O- Overall i would say i that i would definitely buy this again. It's one of those brews i could drink all night"
"the rye aspect is mild but works well, I'd be drinking this on a regular basis if I could find it in my area, for now I'll need to thank EskimoDave for sending a want my way"
"Overall - Tough to categorize this, but the flavors all work together nicely. It doesn't look all that appealing, but it smells great and goes down nicely."
"Notes - Just a solid beer, one of the best offerings from Bear Republic, which is an extremely solid brewery. The IPA characteristics from racer 5, but with some of the malt backbone of red rocket."
"It's a good beer - flavorful and fairly drinkable. I do have to warn you that this is on the malty side of IPA's (I guess 1.020), and many, including me, prefer to stay on the dry side of the spectrum. It just makes things more drinkable and refreshing. But if you enjoy something sweet on occasions, this would be a good ipa one to try."
"O - A tasty IPA from Bear Republic that falls outside the mainstream California IPAs, but doesn't disappoint. Thoroughly enjoyable and easy to consume. A must for all IPA and Bear Republic fans."
"O - Overall, I was really looking forward to this one and I wasn't disappointed. However, I just based my ranking on how much I enjoyed it, not to the style because I believe it has been wrongly categorized. This is at least a DIPA, and you could make the case that it should be a barleywine. I found it to be VERY similar to Terrapin's Rye Squared. This is another good one from Bear Republic, looking forward to the other bottle I received!"
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. The spicy notes from the rye made this something great. Bravo Bear Republic, well done."
"Pours a thick three finger head which fades into ample spider web lacing. The color is amber with no visible carbonation. Looks similiar to a barley wine. The smell is of hops coupled with a sweetness, maybe carmel? The taste is balanced with hops, malt, and caramel all molded nicly together. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Very Tasty beer."
"D-Overall this was a very drinkable IPA. it almost had a DIPA punch to it but i enjoyed the ryeness and hops together very much"
"O: A delicious IPA with rye notes. I'm not a huge fan of rye beers and I know that this is technically not a rye, rather an IPA but it has wonderful rye spice that adds to the delicious IPA that lies underneath."
"O: A wonderful beer to explore the influences of rye. Definitely a keeper."
"Overall, very enjoyable and easy to sip throughout an evening, with the unique scent of rye replacing what would be hops in any other ale. Thinner than a stout, without any sense of ""soy-maltiness"" or ""guinness dryness"" this is a gorgeous brown ale. Try it! My only complaint was that the label didn't quite do the beer justice; they should rework it. lol."
"Overall a real good beer. I think this might be my first rye style, who knows I've forgotten more beers that I've had than many people Have had. If it isn't, it's definitely the best rye I've had."
"My slow, gentle pour still got me a finger of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity, thanks to my pour. I will stir up the lees at the end to see what I get. Nose was grapefruit and black pepper, owing to both the copious hops and all of the rye. Man, but the mouthfeel was full, with a spicy intensity that makes me want to remind you to be sitting down when drinking this beer! That was a Public Service Announcement, courtesy of yours truly. Stone likes to think that we are ""not worthy", but even as a self-avowed hophead, I may not be worthy of this one. It just exploded in my mouth with citrus and black pepper and swallowing did not help, since it was so dry that I immediately gasped and reached for the water. Oh my! To say that this was good would be an understatement. Put another way - it may not be for everyone, but if you like American IPAs and you appreciate what rye can do for a beer, you should try this beer, if you haven't already. I have a feeling that this review at this stage is either a) gilding the lily or b) preaching to the choir or c) some of both."
"O - Bring a sixer home and share with the honey (ies). Yeah the bros can have a few, but really, at 8% it may be your lucky nite."
"T: a high hop flavour, piney, completely bitter, some caramel and malt, dry finish, medium light body"
"Very satisfying and clever brew. The rye provides just enough spunk without detracting from the hop profile, which is magnificent in its own right. Definitely the best use of rye in a heavily hopped ale I've come across."
"Libation: 8% ABV might be enough to push this into DIPA range, but this is quite drinkable. One of the very first rye IPAs to become distributed, and is stil one of the very best."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good, balanced and complex IPA. This brew was heavy on the citrus hops but the excellent caramel malt and spicy rye base of this beer helped balance out all those hops ans made for a pretty complex brew. I liked the aroma the most with the flavor just falling a little short and it had really good drinkability for an IPA, I could for sure go for another one if I had one. I could see buying a six pack of this when I am in the mood for IPA, the balance and complexity were awesome. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPA's, it's doesn't hit you over the head with hops, but it wins you over with its balance and complexity. This beer made for a good first impression of Bear Republic and I am looking forward to trying some of their other brews."
"I was very pleasantly surprised by the dryness of this Ale. IMO so many beers are becoming more and more sweet, especially if they have a high ABV. I have not been overly impressed with the offerings from the Bear Republic Brewing Co., but I have to say this is a very good brew. I would definitely by another case. This is one of the few beers that I find more flavorful on the colder side, that being said I drank this at between 50-55 degrees. Just right!"
"Overall, I was wildly pleased with this beer. I LOVE hops, and this one definitely didn't disappoint. Had i not have known that this was an 8% beer going into it, i would have never guessed anything near that. I certainly foresee myself actively seeking out this brew in the future."
"O- A fantastic beer, loads of flavor. It's great to see such an outstanding IPA done with rye."
"Impressive IPA standing by itself but rye as a novelty ingredient really adds a unique spice note and exceptional dryness despite malts darkening this up. A little heavy but another stellar offering from this brewery."
"This beer is the best of so many worlds. I love dark hoppy brews and I seem to love beers brewed with rye; I've also always considered a well-hidden 8% to be my favourite ABV. If I lived near a ready supply of Hop Rod Rye, my fridge would never be without it. Exceptional stuff."
"Appearance was of sweet brewed tea that was a bit cloudy but that's my fault. I love yeast sediment. Toffee colored head with decent retention considering it's abv. Sticky powdered malt like lacing coats the glass. Nose is boozie and packed with earthy floral hops. A slight tinge of grapefruit is present as well. As it warms more caramel and toffee are present in the entire beer and has a awesome hop presence and the buiscuity mouthfeel is not outdone. The rye being 18 percent of the grist defiantly gives this beer a crisp sharp dry finish. I love the hop bitterness and malty backbone. This is such a well balanced beer to sip on. Cheers"
"A bit spicy but very drinkable. This is my first Bear Republic and I am quite impressed and will be back to try their other brews."
"Great beer all around, another job well done from BR."
"Easily one of the best RyePA's I've had to date."
"Overall Impression- All around IPA, fantastic, gotta try! What else do I have to say? I'm ready to have ANYTHING from the Bear Republic Brewing Co. in bottle. Haven't seen anything yet but looking."
"O: An interesting take on the oh-so-common American IPA. The hops work well with the rye in an odd but good way"
"O - A fantastically balanced IPA with malt and hop in perfect sync."
"overall, a great drinker. this growler was such an easy kill on a nice summer night, in my backyard next to a fire. ill always come back to this beer, it seems to have just a little more to offer than your average IPA, almost like an amber rye IPA...love it!"
"O - Wow I really enjoyed this one. I mean, really enjoyed it. This is a perfect example of a DIPA with great complexity and a nice rye touch. Not overly boozy like many of the DIPA's I'm seeing these days and I can really appreciate that."
"Overall a really good beer. I don't know if I'd go all the way with an A rating but it seems b+ish to me."
"Overall: Just about perfect in every way. The only things for me that could have made it better would have been a heftier head retention and maybe ONE more scent in the nose...but I'm just splitting hairs at this point, a truly good beer."
"Verdict: This is a really phenomenal IPA, the rye spicing adds a nice subtle touch that adds a lot to the beer. It’s really easy to drink and very approachable without compromising the quality and complexity of the beer."
"O: This is an intense beer, strong flavors abound. I think it's a great beer for anyone that likes a strong ale. Definitely the best rye ale I've had."
"Overall/notes - Well, I like the Racer 5, but this just ran right over it (pun not intended). Much more potent than I generally expect out of an IPA, and with great balance, too! Never would have thought the rye could go such a long way, but Bear Republic apparently was on to something. Well-done."
"Drink and Overall: Okay, good beer. Little disappointed, but I really enjoyed it. First time trying this beer, I will have another go at some point."
"Overall the medium bodied brew is a solid IPA, and a solid offering for rye lovers that's available in half the bodegas in New York City. That's a feat to accomplish, and although my rating may be slightly affected by my anti-rye bias, I should still salute Bear Republic for this hot rod of a beer."
"Whoa, first sip's reaction is ""now that's an interesting and unique take on an IPA"". Certainly very hoppy and robustly bitter on the back side of the taste, but also pleasantly balanced out by a certain heartiness that becomes this beer's character. The ultra-crisp mouthfeel and dry finish also help to balance out any and all flavors within. Virtually no alcohol taste at all at 8% ABV. While I can only imagine that the 18% rye malt is giving this beer its uniqueness, it doesn't take away from the overall balance of the beer. That is why this beer shines. It's unique and delicious and will be sure to please any hophead, but it's so delicately balanced that most people would be able to appreciate it. Just one of these has turned it into one of my favorite IPA's, or specialty ales, whatever it is, and it has peaked my interest for some other rye beers. Great beer, congrats and thanks to Bear Republic."
"Deep cherry tinted chestnut brown with a creamy mocha head that leaves thick rings of sparkling lace on the glass. Citrusy hops, pine sap and caramel rye malt aromas. Big resinous hop flavor with rich caramel maltiness to balance the hop oily bitterness. The rye adds a nice spicy kick to round out the flavors. Medium bodied with perfect cleansing carbonation. Bear Republic makes some fine ales, Hop Rod Rye may be the best one."
"O: Great rye pale ale. Crisp, malted with a kick of rye and hops in the background but noticeable. Will always grab another when Racer 5 isnt biting enough. This is its bad bro."
"O- A hop monster with a nice malt backbone and lots of spice."
"O: Really nice and enjoyable beer, goes down very smooth for 8%. The hops are persistent but without overkill. I liked this a lot and I'm glad there's more at the store (special shipment to Iowa). Did I mention that I really like this?"
"O: really balanced, not nearly as bitter as the smell would indicate. It's a real tasty change of pace west coast IPA."
"Pours very dark, cloudy, amber, with a near two finger head. A fair amount of lacing as the beer is consumed. There is a very lovely hops aroma. The taste is both sweet and bitter (I’d say bitter sweet, but that implies that some part of this beer is not good). The beer starts off very sweet and then the hops kick in. The hops bite is very good, but not over the top. This is a very balanced rye beer. The mouthfeel is very good too, not to heavy, not too thin. This is a very drinkable IPA, almost dangerously drinkable given the 8% ABV. Too bad I need to travel out of state to get this one."
"Beer pours out to a mahogany body with a thin tan head that maintains some superb lacing and retention. It has a nice aroma of pine and grapefruit along with some sweet caramel. The taste is rye, caramel and a load of hops which the bitterness just bites the tongue and balances out the sweetness. This beer has got to be one of the smoothest, creamiest and best mouth feel I have ever experienced with a beer. A very good beer and just like the other two Bear Republic beers that I have reviewed this also is a must try."
"This is a great amber colored beer with a light foam. An aggressive pour released a great nose. The smells were Apple, citrus, and papaya. I thought that it might be too sweet for me but upon tasting it I was surprised to find a deep complex piny IPA with strong notes of simcoe hops. This is a very well rounded beer that has a lot of hop characteristic. with just enough malt to balance it out."
"This beer is perfect. A manly beer. Full of flavor, balanced a d highly drinkable."
"Word to brewers, use rye in a black double IPA…really I’m waiting! Racer 5 is still among the best IPA’s I’ve ever had and Hop Rod is another wonderful beer from bear republic. I’m hoping this beer is a hair old and the fresher version has more hops, but either way wonderful beer!"
"O-- Grows on me as I drink on with this. Quite interesting and different but very good. Keeps alot of the essence of what an IPA is but the rye adds a new dimension to this with the sweetness and richness of it"
"O - This beer is a great change of pace and i love it for bringing a different depth to the table, brewers should experience more with rye. recommend this to all"
"I have liked this beer for a long time. Glad to see it's rated highly by a lot of people. It's my idea of an IPA. I guess I always thought of it as just a unique hoppy brew ."
"Overall, very good, dark IPA. Excellent hop flavor and malt body. Very good representation of an american style IPA with the darker caramel malts. The balance of hops and malt is excellent."
"Very good beer, one of the best rye beers out there. I am partial to Founders offering but I believe Hop Rod Rye is every bit as good. Easy to drink, very enjoyable."
"overall - an excellent beer, i would recommend to any one who asked, also a friend who isnt a huge IPA fan loved it(i was a bit surprised) but just like reds rye iv seen it turn people to the hoppy side"
"Edit: The last five or six bombers I've had were filled with too many floaties. Not attractive and affected to taste."
"Nice recipe for a ""specialty"" ale, as it's called, especially for hop heads. Definitely worth a return trip."
"D: Fairly malty IPA with a nice twist with the rye. Good change of pace beer. Will pick this up again"
"I'm finding out that the more I drink beers labeled ""IPA"" or ""Double IPA"" that it will cause me to shift and jostle my top ten list of beers to try and make room for it. This ""HOP ROD RYE Specialty Ale"" was my first BEAR REPUBLIC experience and the CA location made me automatically knock off critical bias points. EVEN STILL, it fizzed and finessed its way into my top ten. The last Belgian style ale has now been knocked off my top ten list - now leaving only inhabitiants of porters, IPA's and stouts. HOT ROD RYE ALE has a very nice cap pop aroma of hops - though less than my other IPA's on the list. I felt the aroma predicted ""hop-slap"" was missing in the flavor but the aftertaste lingered appreciably. A nice beer - if I were to rate it - I would say this is a perfect introductory IPA for the novice beer style drinker."
"A darkish earthy flavor mixed with hops. Must be some malts in here balancing out the hops quite well. A balanced beer - there is no one characteristic that stands out. There is slight hop bitterness but also a little malty sweetness. I do think you get a rye flavor though, or at least it reminds me little of the flavor in rye whiskey. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. A very good session beer, especially for having 8% ABV."
"D: An exceptional beer with lots of great malt and hops going around and flavorful for any taste."
"O: Meh. I love IPA's. I love Rye beers. Despite it's high ratings....I find it a poor blend of the two. Average beer."
"Great beer, replaces Racer 5 as my favorite offering from Bear Republic. My only small gripe is I wish it wasn't so damn potent, so I could enjoy a few more of these."
"Future outlook: In honor of my trip to California in a few hours, I decided to honor this far-too-long overdue Cali brew....and am now kicking myself for waiting this long. Joins Founders Red's Rye as top ""Rye-PA"" that I have had. I will definitely purchase this again, and remind myself to quit neglecting to trial the rest of the Bear Republic offerings that I have available to me."
"Overall, this is going down too fast. I think I may like Founders Red's Rye just a bit more, but this is an excellent beer."
"Overall, this is a solid big hoppy beer, though one was enough."
"An idiosyncratic brew, but darned good."
"Very delicious and well balanced... probably one of the most balanced IPAs I've tried."
"Overall I am not a big IPA fan, but the rye and malt in this beer help balance out the bitter flavor. I would definitely get it again."
"Creamy and chewy mouthfeel with a medium full body. Well balanced with high hop bitterness just like it should be for a beer of this style. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely buy again."
"22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. Pours a deep reddish brown. Very uncharacteristic color. One finger of frothy foam and lots of carbonation. Nice lacing. Nose has a lot going on. Sweet and roasted malt with light and fresh hop and rye scents underlying. The darker than usual roasted malt brings out a lot more rich, robust smells. I can even detect a little cocoa. Mouthfeel is great. Good carbonation and supple without being heavy. Almost creamy texture. Interesting palate as well. The rye gives it more of a grassy taste but the bitterness from the hops rounds this out quite well. Finishes rather clean. The hops still provide some resiny bitterness but the rye makes it more crisp and the roasted malt keeps too much sweetness from creeping in. Definitely not your classic DIPA but a welcome interpretation and an impressive effort. I would almost call it a brown IPA."
"Overall- another tasty beer from bear republic."
"All the flavors work well together and complement each other. The hop flavor is the real star here, and there is just enough sweetness to prevent this from being an unbalanced palate wrecker. World class."
"If you like hops, you have to try this one."
"Overally, awesome beer with the kicked up abv that goes unnoticed.Very smooth to drink, oh so worth it. Will buy again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some citrus. Taste is the same, very hoppy, some citrus notes, the 8% alcohol is well hidden, as is the rye. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"D - I absolutely love rye beers. This is heavenly. Bear Republic knows how to make good beers, impressive."
"drinkability is high. this is a very enjoyable beer with good bitterness."
"EDIT - Had this side by side with Ruthless Rye at a tasting last night. Comparatively, it wasn't as dry as Ruthless, and there was a bit of sweetness that seemed out of place creeping into the taste."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy at times, crisp and slick at other points. It does what it has to do, and the cask carbonation is perfect on top of it all. Drinkability is amazing for such a strongly flavored beer; finish is spicy and bitter without being offensive, and really makes you want another sip. Stickiness is just enough to not get in the way while adding another element. Phenomenal."
"An enjoyable beer just verging on the cusp of real greatness I think. Glad I tried it."
"If you live in Colorado go to Averys to check out their new rye beer, amazing."
"O- I can see why a lot of people are high on this one. The rye is a nice touch that other brewers should consider trying once in awhile. It is extremely drinkable seeing as I forgot I had finished my glass off. A nice beer that I look forward to trying on tap."
"O: I like this beer. I am partial to IPAs in general but this is a winner for sure. Bear Republic continues to produce quality ales here on the west coast."
"Overall, this is a pleasant brew and getting better as it warms. Yum"
"Pours a a dark, ruby-amber color with a medium off-white/light tan head that diminishes slowly. Scent is very hoppy with some pleasant maltiness and citrus notes. Nice pine notes as well. Taste is DELICIOUS!...as usual. Very well balance blend of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine), rye, sweet malt, pine, and floral hops. Finishes with some nice bitterness. No sign of booziness or alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich, complex, and finishes smooth. Drinkability is very high...scary for how high the ABV is. Overall, this is one of my favorite go-to IPAs/DIPAs that I can get on the regular. Always tastes delicious, even when not extremely fresh."
"O - A great rye beer. Probably my second favorite to date after Cane and Ebel."
"Overall I must say I have always enjoyed this offering from Bear Republic. I am very fortunate to have this on the shelves of my local bottle shops for the taking, whenever I want. This is a must try and do what you can to do so!!"
"Glad I finally found this on tap as every single bottle I've ever seen of this has been coated in dust. IPA with dust? Cannot trust."
"O: Bear Republic has a number of beers on the top IPA list and I'm beginning to see why. An outstandingly solid beer all the way around from the appearance to the smell, taste, and feel. Definitely worth having."
"O - Solid brew for sure, just not sure I'm into rye beers, they spiciness always kills them for me. Well crafted with a big hop profile, but well balanced, some good complexity here."
"overall - i enjoyed this hoppy rye attack"
"a pretty good beer, an interesting take on the IPA style."
"I DO intend on buying this beer again. Bear Republic is 2 for 2 with me."
"O: The 8% is hardly detectable in this Rye IPA. Excellent beer."
"D - Great drinkability due to the good combination of flavors and appetizing smell."
"richer tasting than a straight IPA, especially nowaddays -- this is way more thick and sumptuous than what we are calling West Coast IPA. i think simply calling it a Hoppy Rye Ale is enough. good to the last drop!"
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with a thin head. Good amount of lacing. Nice hop aroma. Also some brown sugar and breadiness. Taste is a hoppy sweet, brown sugar flavor. Slightly bitter but more sweet than anything else. This beer gets a lot of hype and while I do think it is good, there are a bunch of better IPAs out there. Big amount of malt flavor to this one. Worth picking up again."
"The addition of rye is very interesting and different and I wish the hops would allow that side of the beer to shine a bit more. Overall it's not at all bad, but instead of being something truly special, in the end it's just another hop bomb."
"This is a bold, delicious beer. Love the spiciness of the rye alongside the hops. Only my second beer from Bear Republic, and I've loved both of them. I look forward to trying all of their offerings."
"Another solid offering from Bear Repiblic; one that I will seek out again."
"Overall, wonderful for any hop-head, and a unique taste (my first rye ale). Definitely piqued my interest in the style, and I would get it again. That, and $5 for a bomber is pretty good 'round here."
"Overall-Very easy to drink, I could drink these early and often. Very reasonable as well"
"D all day all day i could drink this infact after work im going to get a bunch more!"
"The taste is nice balenced with all the flavors. For a california ipa nice to see one this uses other flavor besides hops. I ambe to detect various crysta malt to start the taste of rye and bitter hops finishes the whole thing off...."
"D - Very good beer here. Had a rye beer the other night that wasn't to sure about. This one makes me want another rye beer like this. Very drinkable."
"D: This goes down quite easy; the complex and enjoyable flavor keep it interesting for the whole glass. Will definitely have this again."
"Overall a complex, great beer!"
"D: Great complex flavors makes it a joy to drink - high ABV makes it a slight challenge. I'll happily go down trying."
"M&D- Not bad, not my favorite brew from Bear Republic but honestly i have not been disappointed from their quality yet."
"Drinkability: A very good beer to savor and drink slowly- not necessarily because of the higher ABV, but because it is very tasty and enjoyable. Excellent and highly recommended- I wish I had tried this one sooner."
"A wonderful rye IPA."
"Drinkability. Drinks pretty darn nicely, especially considering the abv. I like this one and could blast through a few without any trouble."
"Like I mentioned in the beginning, mouthfeel is light for a beer of this strength. It smooth but not sticky and the carbonation is very right. Its nicely done and this aid drinkability. You'll have no trouble polishing off a few of these."
"Drinkability- I had 2 in the time it took me to type this... that says something."
"Medium body and carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. Smooth, easy drinking, pleasant flavor, undetectable alcohol. I usually avoid this in bottle form because of the lack of freshness dates, but this is an easy pick on tap."
"Overall, this beer is solid. A true enjoyment."
"I have not had many rye ales, just Lenny's Bittersweet RIPA, but I really liked that and this is good as well. Will get again. Thirst-quenching! Special."
"good beer, good hop/malt balance in the beer, not to complex, need a more prolific and versatile hop varietiy,,i was lookin for a hop bomb but great balance...last sip is a hop bomb with all the hops in the bottom of the glass...wow last sip was unreal"
"This is the best rye beer I've ever had. It may be tough to drink throughout the night, but the 12oz I just had was not enough."
"Drinkability is immeasurable. This beer is an all-occasions, anytime-type brew, and is just mild enough in ABVs to have a few. If it was a little more affordable, this would be a superb 12-pack purchase for company."
"Hop Rod Rye is a hopbomb, no doubt, but layered, complex and delicious. Candy-sweet notes became more prominent as the beer warmed and made the bitter tones extremely palatable. It was truly hard to stop drinking this."
"This is truly a world-class beer, Bravo BR!"
"Very drinkable, super flavorful smooth beer, to bad it only comes in 4 packs"
"One of my all time favorite brew's from Bear Republic. This is one IPA that I can have anytime, anyplace. A must-try IPA for every hop-head. Highly recommended."
"22 oz bottle with great value! Poured a wonderful pillowy white head, the smell of deep grapefruit tickled my nose. Color is dark brown with reddish at the edges. First sip was warming with hops flowing over my palate. Love the lacing on the glass along with exceptional taste and very drinkable I will definately be buying this again!!"
"This is one of my new favorites...!!..!"
"First off this is an exceptional beer, but this is not a repeat buy for me. Amazing look and smell but the taste was just a little off at the end for me. I credit this to the rye. World Class beer Bear Republic Brewing Co.!!"
"Finishes too dry and bitter in my opinion, and there's not enough going on in the way of hoppy flavours."
"D - I think this is incredibly good tasting and is very easy to drink. I would drink this every day."
"Pours a dark brown with reddish tints, thin off white foamy head. Thin lacing follows the brew down the glass. Nose is delicious auroma of fresh hops; pine, citrus and honey. Good presence of malt in there too. Taste has the distinct rye flavour, malt body with some bitterhops and a quick finish ending dry. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Pretty great tasting beer and unique IPA. No idea how fresh this bottle is but I imagine the Hop Rod Rye really fresh is amazing. Perhaps a revist on the next beer haul from Buffalo."
"With this being my first rye beer I didn't know what to expect but to my delight this worked out extremely well. Pours dark red color with high lacing. It's unfiltered so you can't see through to the other side since there is a cloud of sediment in your way. When I smell I get hops and another element, perhaps that's the rye since the bottle says it's brewed with 18% rye. Tastes like an IPA and even the after-taste tastes like an IPA but to me it's a mellow IPA. No hop bombs here. Nice job Bear Republic. Another winner."
"Not surprisingly I found Hop Rod Rye to be comparable to Founders Red's Rye PA. As Founders is distributed here I will probably not seek out Hop Rod again; but if you are in an area of the country that distributes one but not the other, I can fully recommend either of these fine hopped up rye ales."
"Update 11/08/11 Reality check just to make sure I didn't get caught up in the moment. Revisited since my initial review and it's everything I remembered. The gold standard for the style in my opinion. So, why is this classified an American IPA when clearly it's a Rye beer? It even says so on their website."
"12 oz bottle. Pours reddish-brown with a thick, off-white, foamy, long lasting head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, ripe fruit and piney hops. Medium, slightly crisp body. Herbal hops, spicy rye are balanced by caramel malt and ripe fruit on the palate. Long, spicy, dry finish. Simply the great brew."
"D: Drinkability at 8% is spot on."
"A very good and tasty rye-P-A. A must try for IPA fans."
"Wow, this is even better than I remember. Must be tried."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a ruby amber color, with a thin, thick layer of sparse head. A little bit of haze in the coloring, and lots of sediment throughout the beer, which they do a good job of warning you about on the label. Smells are heavy on the hops, with a little malty sweet balance. The beer is bitter-sweet, with hops and caramel sweetness. Also a smokey-toasted malt flavor throughout, which keeps the hop flavors nice and smooth. The beer is a bit dry and smooth in mouth. The sediment really issn't overly bothersome. Quick on the finish, with a lingering hoppy and sour aftertaste. The beer leaves alot of flavor on the back of the tongue, while puckering the front tongue and lips a bit. Makes it really easy for the follow-up gulp."
"Overall: Well its not an IPA, thats for sure. Its a rye beer, and if not that, a Double IPA, but its a great beer nonetheless. Affordabiity is the cherry on top!"
"Sweet bready malts that finish with a really great hop finish. A little bit of spiceness is present from the Rye, and it is blended in a perfect way with the malt for one of the best feelings an IPA has ever given my palate. Honestly, there isnt much to say about this beer other than it is fantastic. I could barely take my time with this beer because it was so good I wanted to keep drinking it."
"The nose is full of hop aroma and the flavors have serious balance. The rye is there but I probably wouldn't have picked it out if I didn't know."
"This here beverage is an exceptional beer!"
"Overall this is a wonderful imperial IPA. It kinda bridges a west coast DIPA with an East Coast imperial IPA. I like it, Im sure it would be even bigger on the aroma fresh on the west coast."
"Leaves a smooth dry aftertaste from the hops. Great beer."
"The beer pours a deep brownish-amber color with a nice foamy almost frothy head. The aroma is hop-filled with a sweet citrusy and floral smell with maybe a small hint of pine. The carbonation is smooth and has an incredible mouthfeel that makes you want to savor this beer on your tongue. The rye malts are a nice spicy touch giving this IPA a bit different flavor that's a welcome change from the norm. The finish is a bit bittersweet both literally and figuratively as you'll want to keep coming back to drink some more."
"There is absolutely nothing bad to say about this one at all, it drinks easy for such a high abv, and I think the rye kind of starts coming through in the aftertaste."
"D. Its maybe good for a couple but the law of diminishing returns does affect this one."
"Drinkability is tricky given this is really a DIPA at 8%. But the bomber really never stood a chance"
"One of my favorite American beers!"
"Great beer and a must try for all."
"D- Drinking it is fine, as long as you keep drinking it. It when you stop that it goes bad."
"Overall, another solid brew from BR. Really enjoy their line but wish the floating sediment wasn't there in most of them."
"A heavy, reddish-amber with a quick dissolving head. The smallest of bubbles are noticed and rise slowly. A citrus peel flavor coupled with a nice, smooth bitterness is a delight. Alcohol at 8% is not very noticeable. I'm on a huge IPA trip now and this one is a treat."
"Would love to try it on tap, as i feel like i missed out, but this is a great beer nonetheless."
"D: This was the first beer I had after a month long hiatus. I'm really glad I picked it."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The bold alcohol and toasted malt quality really made this brew stand out to me. I feel like an ass for seeing this beer on the shelf for more than 2 years now and always passed it by in favor or something new or different. This is a solid brew that I will be returning to again."
"Im a bit perplexed on this beer. I like it, its quite tasty, but not sure Id consider it an American IPA - I thought it looked and tasted more like an American Amber or Rye. Given the choice, Id take a Racer 5 over this as far as IPAs go, but I will certainly be trying this ale again in the future."
"Thanks to Kyle (Southern Lights), my Binny's beer guy in Buffalo Grove for suggesting it."
"Overall: Really solid beer. Awesome color, great flavor. Thanks to Weston."
"NOTES: An enjoyable medium carbonated 8.0% ABV beer that is a touch sweet, and very clean."
"D - amazing drinkability for 8% ABV. I will definitely put this on the list to buy again."
"The CPJ"
"If this was the only craft at the bar, I'd have another one. But... I wouldn't seek this out again and that's too bad because for the most part I really like Bear Republic. I won't hold it against the brewery, but there are much better IPA's out there. Meh."
" ~ The drinkability of ths brew ranks high among other IPAs. Mainly due to the character in the texture. You best bet here is to find one and DRINK IT."
"What really surprised me here was how this beer really performed like a DIPA. The flavors were bold and straight to the point. The body was very smooth and dessert like. Overall this was a nice beer and I'll have to check out the rest of the beers that Bear Republic has to offer."
"I think this brew is very good, but not great as the BA Top 50 would indicate (at this moment)."
"Drink- Ive had a couple of Bear Republic. I can see why everyone likes this one best."
"With the alc content, not a good idea to imbibe too many."
"Poured from bomber into tall glass. Comes from one of my favorite American breweries, Bear Republic. Pours a dark murky brown pour with a massive light-tan creamy head. Strong aroma of molasses like malt, dust and citrus hops. Big rye flavor, robust and slightly burnt. Lots of hoppy bitterness that is long lasting. Quite sugary upfront. A touch of pineapple and grapefruit with a good amount of piney resin. Great rye/hop aftertaste. Medium/full body that is a little bit creamy. Drinks down nicely with an interesting rye character that I can enjoy all day long."
"D - Great drinkability due to the good combination of flavors and appetizing smell."
"Chewy body that is much fuller than expected with a blast of bitter and sweet hop flavor up front that lingers throughout into a dry finish. Bitter earthy pine needle is countered by sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as the sweet rye and malt backbone. Hints of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus peel counter the dry bitter character and are complimented excellently by the sweet rye and malt profile. There's also a creamy presence mid-palate that adds to the complexity and mouthfeel. Excellently balanced with a well masked ABV resulting in an extremely quaffable hop bomb. Excellent!"
"Overall an extremely balanced ipa. I could drink and session this everyday."
"Great IPA, slightly differnt from alot. Definitely catch this beer fresh! Great use of rye! Recommended."
"I originally bought this beer mainly to keep the bottle on my shelf but when i popped it open and tasted it i was blown away by how good it was. I was told i should try this one out if i like beers that are hoppy. Since ive tried it ive have had it several times and buy it just about every time i walk into Bevmo."
"D - Very drinkable, went down so easy I barely knew I was at the bottom of the glass. So easy to drink I'd lose count and end up wondering why I can't stand."
"D: Enjoyable but is not my style of IPA. I'd choose Racer 5 between the two. Nothing wrong with this one, just doesn't fit my love for the crisp clean IPA or the juicy/citrusy IPA."
"This was a nice rye IPA. Would love to drink fresh on draught in the future."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are great and refreshing, but the bitterness is just a bit much. For me personally, if there were a way to keep the smell and flavor but turn down the bitter a few notches, this would be a regular in my fridge."
"Another brewery which is a first for me and it pours a nice rich mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and a rim of lacing,i do like the smell of this drop its a mixture of fresh cherries,rye,peaches and piney hops,it has a above medium bodied nicely carbonated mouthfeel to it which is semi sticky on the lips and has tastes of caramelized pears,cane sugar,sticky date pudding,piney hops which take alot of that sweetness first encountered down a couple of notches and i know ive said it before but this finish is a perfect example of 50% bitter and 50% sweet they really do work so well together to leave your palette lingering for the next sip and after tasting this drop for the first time i am impressed and looking forward to trying the rest of their lineup my only gripe is that i only bought one of these."
"D-well it goes down so quick and easily, i wouldn't ever guess this to be 8%. it drinks more like 4% to me. I found this glass to be empty really quickly. although i wasn't a great fan of the taste and mouthfeel, this beer is a good one that i wouldn't mind having large amounts of in one sitting"
"d - why did we share this bottle?"
"UPDATE: The 2nd time I had it, I was less impressed. Not bad by any means, but it came off as quite a bit maltier and less balanced. Not going to change any of my numerical ratings because it may have sat longer on the store shelf or my taster might have been off."
"D: Would buy this again and recommend for almost anyone to try. Very inviting beer, with a good abv that is not noticeable at all."
"I bought this one a whim, because it was cheap, because Bear Republic doesn't distribute in my home state of New Mexico, and because I tend to like rye beers. I was not expecting much, but I'm blown away. This definitely has me eager to sample more offerings from this brewer when I get the chance."
"The rye character definitely takes a backseat to the hops here. Didn't realize it was going to be such a balls-out DIPA when I ordered it, which might account for the comparatively low marks. Might try this again sometime, but my impression was that this is just way over-hopped."
"D - a classic, often underrated and skipped over beer. this will easily cure all levels of hop craving. big and bold, and a wonderfully executed addition of rye make this somewhat unique within its style. drinkability is only effected by a lack of subtlety, to hell with it."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a two finger head that looks nice and fluffy, that has some of the best retention I have ever seen. Excellent lacing as well, with countless bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass and a bit of sediment down at the bottom. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. Aroma is of mostly floral hops, with grapefruit and some bready malt. Good but not a departure from many other IPA's out there. Tastes of bitter hops, with the bitterness especially coming out in the end. Some bready malt balances very well with the hops, and the rye adds a wonderful spicy taste. Very well balanced. Great carbonation and a full body make the mouthfeel great, and the drinkability is awesome, with the ABV hidden and great, balanced taste making me want more and more"
"Honestly, I won't seek it out again. I'm not sure what the big deal was on this one. I'll rate it average because I'm sure IPA lovers will like it, but I'm not quite sure why, despite having developed a taste for many IPAs."
"Drinkability: I often overlook this beer, but it is a very good rye beer. Definitely need to drink more of it."
"D: I enjoyed this beer, and Rye beers are generally not in my wheelhouse. I don't think I could drink this beer all night but if someone poured me a glass I would gladly accept it."
"Drinks nicely. I like my IPAs somewhat out of whack, but this one keeps it perspective and really shines for it. A well made, respectable beer."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a thick, clingy off-white head. The aroma is highly hoppy -- very citrusy, orange and grapefruit with some pine as well as some spicyness. The flavor is highly hoppy, citrus and pine with a firm hop bitterness. In the middle a bittersweet, spicy malt flavor emerges, and finishes with a strong, pleasant hoppy flavor and perfect touch of dryness. The carbonation is moderate and body medium-full. The 8% ABV is completely hidden, dangerously so in fact. Overall this is an excellent beer, tremendous aroma and flavor, and despite the massive amounts of hops it remains smooth."
"D: Perhaps craft brewing's most famous rye beer, this is truly a delightful and robust DIPA that gets almost everything right. Even small details, like acidity, are executed in such a way as to make this beer more than the sum of its parts. While Bear Republic dabbles with other DIPA recipes (Racer X, for example) there is little point in trying to outshine this beer as it is when served from the bottle. In fact, this is one of those beers that seems to benefit from a little time spent in the bottle. Hop Rod was my draft selection during my sole visit to the company brewpub in Healdsburg and I found it to be be overly spicy--a sensory mix of capsaicin and volatile herbs--due either, or perhaps jointly, to the rye or the eye-watering freshness of the hops. Either way, the imbalance I experienced in the draft pour at the source does not typically carry through to the bottled brew reviewed here."
"Overall this beer is a great example of its style, and one that stands out as being well crafted with no flaws. Will it knock your socks off? Probably not, but it will go perfect with some hamburgers and good conversation."
"Drinkability? Yes, this is a category where drinkability is major. The Malt bill is busy mostly keeping the hops from going too bitter while letting them bring big flavors. Hop Rod is just a bit different from the mainstream IPA varints,which gives it a good niche."
"Great IPA with a great malty presence which I wouldn't mistake for balance. But this goes down really nice and is a great IPA."
"For the amount of hops and bitterness it leaves it goes down pretty quickly. I served it in the mid 40s and as I drank the hop definition became intense."
"Drinkability- fantastic finish leaves me longing for more!"
"D: Very drinkable and delicious super-hopped rye IPA. Amazing rye flavors balanced with strong hops."
"D- I am thrilled that this is a year-round release. I will have many, many more of these."
"D: A very drinkable IPA, but the heaviness of it gets to me after a couple. Not one I would post up on all night, but good for a couple no doubt."
"d- good, i'd be able to knock back a couple of these, very flavorful, this is a good beer to try if you're looking to see what rye can taste like in a beer."
"Very drinkable. Highly recommend."
"D - Drinkable. Oh man. Delicious. Definitely more of an IPA than a rye beer though. So fresh. I can't get over the freshness of the beers that Bear Republic puts out. They and Green Flash really have a rivalry going in that area and it's great for beer. Bear Republic's beers are as young a beer as you'll ever try. Everything put into it wasn't harvested too long ago."
"The alcohol was well-hidden in this beer and I could drink more than one in a sitting. Great beer!"
"D: Smooth but bitter ending. Fairly easy to drink, especially considering the ABV. A good one to pick up here and there. Curious how it tastes on tap. I think I was definitely getting some bottle type of tastes that may have not been true to its real taste."
"D: Uhhh... the bitterness stung, so for my tastes, I found this a bit overbearing. However, the brew as a whole was outstanding and definitely deserves its place among the big dog IPAs on the market. Bear Republic doesn't make a bad beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The mouthfeel is awesome, I love the rye malt addition which gives it a small amount of dryness in the rear. But it's also full bodied just like the flavor. Great brew all around I highly recommend snagging one if you're into IPA's and want something a bit new."
"22 oz chug into a large snifter. Color is almost like a barley wine, a deep dark amber. Head is not massive, but is fluffy and plenty. Aroma is fantastic, it has a big hoppy nose like an IPA but with that wonderful rye sharpness. Taste is bitter and sharp...if this wasn't such an incredible beer, I would be tempted to say the hops overbalance the malt, this beer is hoppier than most IPAs and as hoppy as many DIPAs. Alcohol hidden very well. Bear Republic has a big time winner here."
"D- MORE PLEASE!"
"Great drinkability. One of my stand-by favorites, always."
"Oh, and I have to wonder about the style classification here. This doesn't belong in Rye Beer? Really!?"
"D - The bomber is just right for an evening sipper, or to share with a friend. Will definitely pick this one up again."
"Deep mahogany color; hoppy haze and nice frothy head with good retention. Big hop aroma with all the typcial citric, wildflower and pine smells - very complex with the added rye. Awesome hoppy flavor and great creamy smoothness - it really does massage the tounge! A carmely maltness comes out as it warms up...I love it! No breakdown in the finish, just a fantastic brew!"
"Drink - This one is pretty far up there on my list of favorite beers; it is very tasty and highly drinkable. I'll seek this one out again and stock up on it for sure."
"Creamy, smooth, refreshing mouthfeel. So nice and mellow, it is ridiculous. This has to be my favorite in the style so far. As for the abv, it is high, so stick with oen bomber for the night. Alcohol is nonexistant in the mouth, nose, but not in your head."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is between light and medium bodied with pretty smooth carbonation. It makes for a nice feel. Pretty drinkable, I can taste a bit of the alcohol. Overall, definitely a nice IPA."
"pretty full mouthfeel. not to syrupy even thought its a high abv malty beer. I think rye beers are growing on me. Decent!"
"Very tasty and quite drinkable, especially for IPA fans who like a mix of malt and other ingredients like rye with their hops. This is no ordinary IPA and should be enjoyed for the specialty beer that it is. A definite recommendation."
"I purchased this since I have an upcoming homebrew that I'm going to incorporate rye into and was looking to see how the 18% rye level impacted the taste. Definitely has a more intense hop flavor than I hoped for (My fault for not seeing the Rye IPA part when I bought this on a whim). Pretty highly hopped beer so it was difficult to ascertain the impact of the 18% rye vs say 10%. I've had a very successful Irish Red Ale with rye at a much lower level that turned out very well balanced and am moving onto a Belgian specialty ale that I wanted to impart a rye spiciness to."
"Overall this may be a good beer but it is just slightly unbalanced for my liking. Defintely bitter, spicy and really hoppy. Not enough malt backbone to be a complete winner for me. I have had many ryes and prefer others."
"Great beer that went down easy- beautifully balanced and very tasty! Grab one if you haven't yet!"
"D- Very drinkable despite the alcohol, but a a little rich, so I probably wouldn't knock back more than a bomber, or drink without sharing. Still, a great beer all around, and a knockout value for the price."
"Pours a nice cloudy, tannish amber color with a thick head. Nice citrusy and floral hops. Very good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. I love this beer. Its not as bitter as Racer 5, but it has a good hoppy taste. I couple drink many of these in a night."
"D - Pretty good. I'm not sure of its the 8% but the bomber would be enough. Not that its bad!"
"D/O- The 8%abv is very hard to grasp, holy cow. What a delicious brew, my first from Bear Republic. The price point is ridic...just saw a bomber for $4.79 tonight. Highly recommended."
"Sexy beast. Didn't realise this is considered an IPA, interesting. I suppose in that sense if you bought this hoping for an IPA along the lines of Racer 5 you would maybe be disappointed. But not for long. Buckets of intense piney resinous hops gives a rough and ready aroma that leads to a tongue tearing mouth feel. Flavour and character in spades. Finish is loooong and sublime. One tasty mofo. Can only imagine how good this would have been if it was a couple of months fresher."
"Good drinkability, good beer."
"This was an interesting brew to me---let me preface by saying, I really love Bear Republic beers---Racer 5 is a staple. So, Hop Rod Rye---pours a nice reddish-copper color with off white head. Nose is typical IPA hoppiness with an additional nose of spice. Taste follows suit---rich and flavorful with a spicy rye bite. I didn't notice any alcohol on the finish---the abv is 8%, not exactly a lightweight. The brew is very well made, but I found myself not getting past the rye spice flavors. So, not my style and something I couldn't see having more than one of occasionally. I bet it's a nice beer with Asian food or maybe Indian. Its def one to try for yourself---you may love it. I'm glad I got to give it a spin."
"Alcohol content was hidden very well, and for the price, a good drinking beer for any occasion."
"D. Drink...may I have another and another...please."
"Pours a deep plum color with a one finger off white head which dissipated to leave a soapy ring of head and carbonation lining the rim. Lots of lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, rye(of course), dark fruits, and a hint of resinous, pine-y hops. Not very hop forward so this may be a touch aged. Tastes like a rye ale with a biting bitter back end. Bit of grapefruit and floral-ness lingers on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is great. Not super drinkable as I think the bitterness has ruined my palate after only one and I consider myself fond of hop forward brews."
"D: Hop Rod Rye strikes a lovely balance between sweetness and bitterness. It's very drinkable and interesting enough to keep you pondering while you do."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brownish color with a white soapy head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and caramel with hints of pine and rye. Sweet and malty, with a nice hop hit and more sweetness on the backend. Just delicious. I do not normally like rye pale ales, but this is perfectly balanced."
"D- hides its abv well. Another great rye beer with fantastic roast malt and hop flavors. Delicious and possibly my favorite rye ipa."
"Drinkability would be higher, i think, if this were a little fresher. Some of the pungency of the hops is missing. Its all still there but a really strong juicy hop flavour would help make this more enticing to sip on. Brewed in april."
"Overall a nice red ale surprise! Rye works well along with mild sweetness, malts and hops. well crafted and balanced. xtra hops and nice sweetness that longers made this work for me."
" It didn't pick up as great of a head as I'd like, but it was there. same with the lacing. The glass had been through the dishwasher once or twice, so it might not be the beers fault. It has a beautiful color, a deep coper with just a hint of mustyness. It kinda smelled like a typical IPA, but the rye in the taste makes it stand apart. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but I've already purchased another Rye IPA to try (Founders). The high ABV is hidden well, so I could drink this all night."
"EDIT: 12-28-10, drank another full bomber of this beer. Simply wonderful. Huge fluffy and creamy head that lasts, nice change of pace for a good IPA, the rye is awesome, the flavor gets better as you go through the glass and smooths nicely as it approaches 55+ degrees. I am going to make this a mainstay."
"Very simple yet completely engaging with a bit of different flavor in the rye. It has fantastic consistency to make it an easy and pleasureable beer experience."
"Medium body and very smooth feel. Light to moderate carbonation. At 8%, a very drinkable beer that I have enjoyed several times before and one that I am sure will cross my path again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Good drinkability even with a little higher abv."
"This was a great beer. I saw it at Bevmo, and the label drew my attention. I saw that it was a rye beer, and couldn't remember ever having a rye beer before. I decided to try something new. I was very pleased with my choice, the beer had a lot of hop flavor, but it didn't beat you over the head with the hops. And i couldn't place the aroma, but it was very nice. I would def get the beer again."
"D. Goes down pretty easily. Though I love most hop-forward beers, the lingering bitterness is a bit too much for me here. I prefer Racer 5 to this by a long shot and if I need a rye fix, I have Founders Red's Rye at the ready."
"Rye is more noticeable on the taste, rounding out the bitter hops and sweetness with its distinctive savor. The rye also adds a welcome bit of fullness to the Racer 5 profile, which was prone to the occasional metallic twang. This is a smoooth drinking beer, rich and creamy but not sticky. At $4 a bomber, this makes its way onto my top shelf. A helluva an IPA with as much to ponder as anything oaked, barreled, or double malted. Absolutely worthy of its place. Incredible."
"Highly drinkable, this and Racer 5 are two of my favorite IPA's out there."
"A very nice brew indeed. It is smooth and flavorful. I think I shall refer to it as a rye-p-a"
"D- Easily drinkable. The bomber was no problem to finish off. I still fail to see how this is an IPA. Why is it not considered a rye beer?"
"Note: This review may not be precise as I didn't write down any notes while drinking. This was, however, my first beer of the evening and I think I remember everything correctly."
"This beer has an excellent mouth feel and and is very drinkable. I loved it."
"Deep orange to amber red and hazy with a healthy off-white head that reduces to a steady white cap. Lots of sticky lacings. Big floral, piney hop aroma wiht a hint of orange citrus. Medium body, very smooth feel. A brief sweet malty flavor that is quickly overrun by hop flavor. However, the sett malt remains beneath the hop character throughout. Floral and piney hop flavors take over every available taste bud. Finishes with a nice combination of malty sweetness and hop bitterness and a bit of an alcoholic aftertaste."
"My first rye. Poured a big ol' head which took a while to die down to 1"". Brown but unlike so many typical browns I'd call this sort of a warm burnt umber. The smell struck me as among the likes of a strong Imperial IPA. Yet the taste was a lot less hoppy than IPAs, more typical average beer. And yes I'd say there are some flavors in common with Rye-based whiskey."
"Drinkablility: I just love these hoppy rye brews. This one is very tasty and easy to drink. I wish this was available to me locally because Hop Rod Rye and I would have a great relationship."
"Immense flavor without an equal measure of bitterness - not nearly as pine or hemp forward as a lot of NorCal IPAs, this has a superior balance. After many years, this has only been eclipsed by Alpine's Nelson in my opinion as far as rye-IPAs go."
"D- Great overall, to much bitter ryeness for my liking."
"Great beer for the hopheads seeking a change-up on the malt profile. Good beer."
"The body was medium and had a nice sticky feel. The carbonation was quite generous, giving a solid bite long into the lingering bitter dry/chalky finish. This is a fantastic beer, enough hop kick to be a real good IPA, and a hell of a good malt profile to make it a heavyweight of flavor."
"I can't say enough about this brew, it proved to me the style of IPA has some more wiggle room from it's typical hop bomb characteristics and at $4 a bomber there really is no excuse not to drink it."
"D-Drinkability is through the roof on this one.I'm ready to have another so that I can see what else I can pull out of it."
"Notes: This is absolutely crazy, deep and complexly concentrated beer. Be sure to take your time and sip this one slowly."
"This may be Bear Republic's best, and this ranks up there with russian river in top nor cal brews period."
"D:Probably one of the best rye beers I have ever had. Solid flavor with easy drinkability and a great hop profile, wish we could get Bear Republic in Indiana all the time"
"Moderate carbonation and a full, creamy mouthfeel. Hop presence up front followed by some mildly sweet caramel and a wonderful long finish of spicy rye and tart citrus. Refreshing and well-balanced rye IPA."
"D - Dangerously drinkable for it being 8% ABV. Nicely balanced beer and easy on the palate allowing for more than one to be consumed."
"The long awaited sample of this beer finally happened. it did not dissapoint. it poured a dark sopperish color. nice glows. Had a nice creamy head and huge lacing.Light on the nose but did have some citrus aromas, This is a balanced IPA and very hefty on the the body."
"D - Very smooth for a big beer and very drinkable. Will definitely be picking up more."
"D: easy drinker any time of the year. will drink often."
"Spicy rye upfront with a caramelized grapefruit and bread-like middle ending in a somewhat long, and somewhat drying finish. Earth hop flavors are noticeable throughout the taste. The carbonation is low enough that the body exhibits a certain pleasant weight and has a fair amount of smooth, creaminess on the tongue. A balanced and delicious rye based IPA/DIPA."
"D- o this is great perfect all the time"
"Poured into a pint glass the beer was a woody maybe oak color, a little copper, dark for an IPA; also a surprisingly small head, tan in color. The head held for a moment and then left behind a sticky lace. The smell is hoppy with a rye not of course. Some say they smell raisins, I don't really get that. I don't think this beer is as fruity as other do. The taste is a bold hoppy taste! Strong, bitter, with a smoother rye and slightly malty finish. The stickiness and some citrus notes stay with you long after the sip and the beer has been enjoyed. I personally like this a great deal. No alcohol notes whats soever. For a strong ~8%abv this beer is very drinkable, dangerous and delicious."
"Solid IPA, pour is a much darker than I expected, big caramel color, very warm. Decent head and lacing. Strong hop-foward aroma, but not a champ. I feel this is like meeting a retired boxer, king of his ring in his day but probably unable to hold a candle to what the world can produce now, even in his prime. Lots of caramel and some brown sugar as well as well. Taste is similar to what I just described. Medium-full body, good feel and carbonation. A bit big to be truly drinkable."
"A slow pour yields a dark amber/light brown with about a fingers worth of dark red head. Smells are caramel malts, some raisins, hops and rye. I taste rye right off the bat, hoppy, sweet but balanced, very good. The malt backbone remind me of a barleywine, but the spiciness of the rye and hoppiness make this a really unique version of an American IPA. Mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky. Drinkability is high with this, so glad I got a bomber and not a 12 ouncer, would defintely drink if they disributed to Indiana."
"D: The alcohol is masked rather well so this beer is easy to drink."
"D - This is an overall good hoppy beer, not one for the record books, however I do not think my palate has had enough training to get the full effects this beer has to offer. I had a hard time trying to figure out all the flavors that I was tasting and the aromas that I was smelling. I am going to wait a few more months and give this one another shot."
"D- this is a well done brew. I find the use of rye to be overbearing sometimes but with the hopping used here it works beautifully."
"drinkability - I think this 22oz bottle will be enough for tonight"
"drinkability is amazing, before I know it the glass is almost gone. the spicy hops work well with the inherent spicy quality of the rye to make some unique and tasty qualities that go down well. no hint of the alcohol content. well done."
"Drinkability: A very nice and bitter IPA. The rye is very much present and nicely done. I like this one. A sipper that I will have again, but only once per sitting."
"goes down good but will fill ya up! Good to switch up with a Pils when drinking a few of these.Recomended!"
"The taste is much better, more complex, balanced, and well-rounded. It has grapefruit, but also spicey candied citrus rind, rye bread element is light but very clearly noticeable, especially in the finish and aftertaste,, along with light winey fruitiness. The bitterness is spicy and just dominates the finish and aftertaste, lingering but with the other elements and character. It is fairly easy to drink but not extremely drinkable, reasonably light but a bit still too heavy and spicey to be truly easy to drink. The complexity and subtle notes really come through more from the cask, but the aroma from just smelling it is more subdued and not truly indicative of what is to come in actually drinking it."
"I really wanted to give this beer a better review, but the aroma and taste did not match the style for me. Hopefully this was just an old bottle with faded hops, and I'll make sure to give this beer another try with fresher hops."
"Bear Republic Brewing Company--Hop Rod Rye Specialty Ale--2009 12 oz. Bottle. 8.00% ABV. 100+IBU's? (4.5 / 5.0) IPA--Imperial Rye. No sediment. Thin lacy white head. Clear rich dark amber color. Floral hop rye spice malt ester front. Crisp dry sweet toasted caramel rye tangy spicy body. Rich clean dry hop spice end. Crisp clean rich Hoppy Rye IPA. Sampled 7/15/2009. 4-Pack $7.99."
"I really enjoyed the blend of sweet malts, rye spice and pine hops that this beer offers, the use of rye really does make this a unique and memorable IPA."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of light tan head. This beer is copper colored. The aroma is fresh citrus. The taste is citrus, primarily grapefruit, with a bitter aftertaste in which I can taste the rye. This is a very refreshing beer. This is only the second ""rye"" IPA that I have tried and they have both been excellent. I like this version better than the typical west coast IPA."
"The palate opens with a blend of caramel-like flavors - brown sugar, toffee and caramel - but not cloying on the palate. Along with it is a rather strong pine and candied grapefruit hop character with moderate bitterness and plenty of flavor. The rye comes in on the mid-palate with a pronounced spiciness that lingers into the finish. Moderately drying on the finish, this beer has a wonderful blend of toffee, rye and pine hops. The mouthfeel is quite sublime with a medium-light body and a soft carbonation, a level which really accentuates the good qualities of this beer. Excellent stuff, I'd drink a lot of this - if only I could find a bottled on date. Despite the moderately high ABV, this goes down very easily, and I will pick this up on a more regular basis."
"Drinkabilty - Wow, what a great beer, this is not only a top 5 ipa for me, its simply one of the best beers ive drank. I always keep a 4-pack on hand. I enjoy this beer weekly, as you should too The only thing possible to improve is on the smell. It could use some more pine/hop smell but honestly, it doesnt meen anything soon as you take a drink."
"A: The color of a weak coffee, the first beer of this 22 oz. bomber is crystal clear though I see some sediment on the bottom of the bottle, there's a thin layer of thick head - 3.75, S: Significant hop aromas, very dry and crisp, some spiciness as well - 4.00, T: Strong hop bite, lots of pine and a touch of grapefruit rind, extremely dry, a good deal of spice on the palate as well as a hint of sweetness - 4.25, M: 4.00, D: A very drinkable IPA, enjoyable all around and one I'd happily drink again - 4.00"
"Notes: Bottled 05/10/10. Pretty good and interesting IPA. Spicy flavors come out pretty well. Also the fruity hop flavors are more hidden and just come out in a more subtle way and act as undertones. Enjoyable beer to drink, but probably not one to start someone out with if they are new to IPAs."
"Drink - Well, this is a freakin intesne brew, so I wouldn't suggest trying to handle more than 2 or 3 of these in a night. I prefer to drink one at a time myself. This beer is highly recommended."
"Drinkability is great....thank God they only sell it in four packs; I'm glad I'm only limited to four.:-)"
"Poured into a St. Bernadus Goblet. Poured a deep amber color with an off white head and left a good lacing. Excellent aroma of piney hops with undercurrent of malt and rye. Sweet Malt flavor dominated by the hop presence, with a crisp Rye fade. Excellent mouthfeel. I loved this beer."
"Dark copper pour with nice caramel-colored head and great lacing. Big fruity nose with hints of caramel and pine. The rye is there in the nose, but somewhat subdued. It definitely emerges more in the taste. Great spicy, bitter, hoppy bite that's very complex with hints of orange, grapefruit, and of course rye. This is definitely the best interpretation of a rye PA that I've had. The alcohol is well hidden which makes it highly drinkable. Thick, chewy, bitter, but smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A classic beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"D: One bomber was plenty. I've always liked this beer, and I plan on drinking it again."
"This is a great bomber, very hoppy yet balanced by the rye malt."
"D - A great beer no doubt. Would be hard to have more than a couple due to the strong taste, but delicious!"
"D-Good drinkability especially for the 8% alcohol. Had some bombers and a few four packs. The four pack is perfect."
"D: A very smooth IPA. Perhaps more malt than I like, but at 80IBUs that makes sence. This drinks almost like a black IPA. Very good though. I will likey purchase this beer again down the road!"
"D-not quite sure of the bottle date on this beer so I might be missing out on more hop character; it's a great beer that is not overdone by the rye, but adds a subtle smoky character and a great deep color"
"Na Zdravje!"
"This is a tremendous beer. I wish Bear Republic distributed here."
"I love this beer. The rye really plays well agains the massive onslaught of hops."
"D - Good drinkability, Definitely a good beer that I will get again."
"D: Quite drinkable for a big beer."
"Like others have stated, incredibly smooth taste. But I think this is where the beer falls short. It has RYE right in the name, boasts of being made with ""18% Rye"" on the bottle.. yet the rye is overpowered by the hops. Overpowered is too strong of a word, I would say neutralized. To their credit, it is a balanced beer and quite drinkable, but I was hoping for more Rye. I live in california for christ' sake. West coast hop bombs are a dime a dozen."
"Served from bottle into Spaten mug. Pours a deep brown with a two finger off-white head that subsides slowly. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of wheat, malt, and hops. The flavor is of wheat, subtle malt, and nice refined hops. It is medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is quite nice and refreshing. The hop character isn't overwhelming and is almost spot on. I have passed by this MANY times in the stores and not looked twice at it. This bottle might have changed that forever..."
"Great atmosphere. The appearance is formidable and intimidating, and the nose is not complex but very full. Flavor, also not complex, but does it what it does well. Some different notes with a very slight sweetness to offset the hoppy character. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"**Edit: the rest of the 4-pack was a little more carbonated than the first bottle I had. The mouthfeel improved to what can only be described as perfect, but I do think the flavor actually suffered just a tad. I still love the beer and would be happy to drink it every day for the rest of my life."
"This is a beautiful beer that defies categorization. Hop Rod Rye has the great grapefruit and floral hop aromas of American IPA's, but is made with rye, is darker than the standard, with a fuller mouthfeel and slightly higher alcohol content. The aroma is a very enticing combination of orange flower and grapefruit zest. The beer is a very nice juxtaposition of piney citrusy west coast hops with spicy rye The beer is thick, luxuriously coating the tongue with each swallow. This is a very good beer, but with the sweetness and 8% abv, it might be a bit much to handle"
"Highly drinkable for lovers of big hoppy ales, quite imperial brown rye ale (IBRA) or (DRBA) doppelrye brown ale for me not that it matters overall better than i had thought at first sip this beer really gets better as you go, durn good..."
"D - This beer is excellent. I take a sip and taste slowly, but as soon as i savor the lingering aspects of the beer, I just want more. After the first time I had had it a while ago, I felt guilty drinking it, like I should be saving it for something special...but it's too damn good to do that."
"D - Well I may have it again but I really didn't love it. Guess I will let others drink it."
"I put this up there to go toe to toe with any IPA I've ever had...very solid. I will be getting this again."
"D - Ummm...where did my growler go?! Very drinkable, absolutely no hint of the 8% ABV. Amazing beer, definitely one of my favorites, and at around $5 a bomber its one of the best deals you can find. Great job, Bear republic!"
"Hop Rod Rye was tasty as far as hop bombs go, and it seems well crafted. Although the ABV is on the high side, I didn't find this to be a messy, thrown-together brew. If I was a hop head, I think I'd return to this one."
"Well balanced, quite drinkable."
"22 ounce bomber. Pours a rich copper that reminds me of a new penny. Color aside, the head on this beer is quite impressive, huge and billowing with tons of lace that absolutely sticks to the sides of the glass. Aroma is fantastic, though a bit light. I get lots of pine with some notes of bread, most likely from the rye. Really love the depth that the rye adds to the taste, lending incredible balance to the beer. Caramel and bread up front, followed by a very enjoyable finish of light grapefruit. Little to no alcohol character, which is surprising given the ABV. This beer is pretty incredible."
"d 4.5 bought these with the intention of cellaring some, but i have doubts that aging would do them any good. the flavors are already well integrated and don't need more restraint, and a reduction of the aroma would certainly not help. basically, too good now to justify waiting."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable. The alcohol in this beerl is hidden well, it's not overly sweet, and tastes great. I would love to have this more often...luckily it's easy to find."
"D - Not too good. Hop dominates but tastes off."
"Be careful with this one, because even as my beer warmed it didn't even taste close to 8% ABV!"
"Drinkability is high. Such a fresh punch of hops with a lowered bitterness level always makes any IPA quaff-able. Excellent beer!"
"D - Incredibly drinkable, this is a beer I always find myself happy to come back to!"
"D: I love the spiciness in this beer. I need to seek out more beers brewed with rye. Pretty heavy for an IPA, borders if not crosses into the DIPA range. Great brewery, great beer."
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty well despite the massive hopping and the 8% abv. Always a treat."
"Like I said at the beginning of my review, I bought a whole 4-pack of this stuff and am now trying to drink through it although its taking over a week. This is not on my ""must try list"" but I do recommend, if you do try it, to simply by a single to determine for yourself if you like it."
"I remember thinking of my last few sips as juicy. This beer is delicious. Gonna be my go-to alternative IPA from now on now that I've remembered about it. Glad I have 3 more!"
"Notes: A tasty offering from Bear Republic. For this review I raise my glass to a very wonderful friend it's her birthday June 22nd. Cheers to you Happy Birthday Tigger."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D - Solid IPA, well balanced all around with no one element overpowering the other. Watch the 8% abv, it caught up to me quick."
"this was good, but not something i would want many of. i far prefer this out of a bottle."
"D- I don't know about this. Its a good gateway beer for novice hopheads, but could be considered a little weak for someone more experienced. I'm somewhere in the middle, so I really like it. Did I enjoy it more than Racer 5? I'm gonna have to buy more of it to think about that one."
"Drinkable, but slightly too corrosive to drink more than one"
"This very may well be the best beer I have ever had. I love the Racer 5 from Bear Republic and this extends the impressive ability of the brewery. The beer has the perfect balance between hops and mellow fruit character. It pours a beautiful color with a nice 2 inch head that laces for the entirety of the consumption. This is exactly what American micro brewing is about."
"M/D: Medium bodied beer with good carbonation. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, there is no evidence of the 8% abv at all, and drinking this one could get dangerous fast. I look forward to getting it again."
"D - this is certainly a drinkable beer, limited only by the persistent bitterness of the hops upfront as well as in the finish. Even so, I would certainly enjoy this beer again for $4.99 a bomber, but it would be better if there was a bit more of a malt backbone."
"D: The 8% is hidden oh-so-well. Just about perfect, as the flavor makes me want to enjoy it slowly to take it all in. Not a session beer, but it doesn't need to be."
"Poured a 2 inch thick head, which was foamy and lingered for a while. Plenty of lacing on the side of the glass. Clear, amber-orange in color. Hop Rod has aromas of toffee, baking spices and roasted malts that blend nicely with the pungent, hoppy smell. There is a creamy mouthfeel, some sweetness (even a faint hint of black cherries), and then strong, malty flavors and mouth-drying hops and grapefruit. Overall a delicious and well-balanced beer."
"D: pretty damn good IPA from bear republic. The rye is pretty faint in the flavor but still does justice as an IPA. I'm glad I have access to it on a daily basis"
"d - A pretty good IPA. Lots of nice pine and citrus hops in the smell and taste, but defintely well balanced and not a hop bomb. Very easy to drink and would definitely try again."
"Darker reddish amber color and the head protiens are hanging on for quite a while, very nice retention, frothy consistancy and good lacing. Man, i wish i knew the age on this one, i may have succombed to an old bottle of Hop Rod, but unfortunantly i have no idea, and as such i can only review what is in front of me, which is a semi moderate hoppy pale ale that shows alot of balance and a creamy and syrupy mouthfeel, with the Rye giving it a differant feel then your average ipa. Nothing exciting going on, some interesting notes once again just with the rye, but an otherwise average beer. I really hope this is a faded bottle, i really hope companies start printing dates on bottles."
"D- This is very good and there is no hint of the 8% ABV. This is a great example of what an IPA is. If you have tried Racer 5 and enjoyed it you need to pick this up."
"Bear Republic produces some excellent beers but the consistency is not always there as this one was quite amazing as well as the first one that I had but they were a bit different. You know you will always get something very good but each batch will vary."
"Another great beer from one of the best value breweries around. Pours a dark, reddish-amber color, with burgundy highlights and some generous foam. The nose is overload with fresh, juicy, resinous hops, which is the point, I suppose. Great hoppiness on the palate as well, as well as just a hint of the spicy rye. Dangerously drinkable. A four pack goes down way to easily."
"I've never had a rye beer before, picked this up because I've really enjoyed Bear Republic offerings I've tried thus far. This was a great treat. Everything I'd expect from an American pale ale but also with delightful caramel/malty undertones. What a great combination. Beautiful orange/amber in color with lacing throughout."
"Pours a brownish-red colour with thick slight off-white head. This may be the darkest IPA I've seen, but looks really nice. Smells of citrus hops and caramel. Taste is first some bitterness with citrus and piney hops, with lots of sweetness of a caramel flavour. Not a huge hop monster, but incredibly well balanced. This is a great beer."
"Carbonation is spot on here, nothing less is expected from Bear Republic. Always top notch. Has that oily hop feel, very smooth and easy drinking. This one may sneak up and bite you in the ass if you don't watch it. Treading on the double IPA turf, this hop monster certainly satisfies those hop cravings. I'd say this is most likely the best American IPA out there. Just my humble opinion."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a hazy, reddish-copper with a dense, one inch off-white head that settles into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Broken sheets of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose starts off as sweet and malty with toffee notes, followed by a citrus hops presence that follows closely behind; a faint metallic quality also comes out towards the back. Taste follows nose - some piny hops in the mix and just a very light bitterness reveals itself at the back and the metallic quality disappers. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and just the slightest viscosity and a little residual alcohol heat. This is a very tasty brew that has a big malt profile and falls a little closer to an IIPA than a standard IPA. Very tasty and complex, but not something I would drink more than one or two of in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Oh Hop Rod Rye, you slay me. This is probably the best balanced IPA I have had. This will be a regular in my fridge, and I could drink it all night."
"Worth a try. Probably not for everyone."
"D: A meal in the glass. Bitter hops, chewy malts. The ale can't avoid its booziness though, so strength is an issue (albeit minor)."
"Hop Rod Rye pours fairly deep amber with a copper hue. If this beer was wood, I would make a nice desk out of it. The head is parchment and minimal, but it has staying power and leaves nice lace. The aroma is of rye, sweet malt and pine. It also has a very estery fruitiness to it that I find quit unique. The flavor is a mix of pine, grapefruit, caramel malt and a touch of rye. Together they combine to create some interesting flavors that are very berry like. This is definitely a take no prisoners sort of beer, and while I am defiantly picking up what it's laying down, I wish there was more rye. A paltry complaint, but what can I say, I'm a rye whore. Also, the alcohol really shows through in the flavor, though the more I sip the more I think this just enhances the overall experience. The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium and is well balanced with a nice spiky carbonation that works well in the overall package. Pretty drinkable for style (this is def a double IPA, not a single as indicated) and another fine offering from bear republic. If only they could calm down about the copyright lawsuits..."
"I think this is a sipper for me, a 12 oz bottle would be plenty, but I've got a bomber to finish. This definitely isn't the beer i'd go to when I wanted a good hoppy IPA, but if i wanted to something on the maltier side, it's a good choice."
"(D)- A superb IPA that is even better with the rye addition. It has everything that is great about the style with a lightly spicy rye bread/caramel sweetness. I could easily have 2-3 bombers of this if I wanted to. Great stuff."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown, Almost looks like it should be a quad. Head is one-finger but sticky and lasting, leaving attractice lacing throughout. Nose is floral and earthy with some citrus (lemon, grapefruit) notes. Taste starts with some bitterness from the hops but moves to sweetness from the bready malts. Good carbonation. The Finish is somewhat bitter and dry with some alcohol warming. I was looking for more effects from the rye which weren't there for me. A decent IPA but not among my favorites."
"This has very deep flavors and heavy hops of course. I prefer the lighter IPA's such as Blind Pig or Lagunitas IPA. This one has a particular strong flavor that reminds me of the Stone AB."
"Another the hops aren't really as pronounced as they should be, this is a very good beer and one that I could see being a staple in my fridge if it was distributed in Maine."
"Very drinkable. Went down smooth. I could keep drinking this all night."
"D: Big beer thats easy to drink."
"D-It's by no means a bad beer, but the bitterness makes it a little one-sided. Also, where's the rye??? I was expecting at least a hint of it, and I'm not picking up on it at all."
"Beyond that, it's not bad, but not really great either. There's some nice hop flavor in there, but none of the forwardness and bold flavors one usually expects from an American IPA, and no obvious subtlety to compensate for that lack. It just didn't seem very interesting."
"Poured a nice dark red with a tall off white head. The smell was really hoppy with some sweet notes mixed with a malty tone. The taste starts hoppy with a citrus kick, stays nice and smooth then finishes with a bitter kick that is both malty with the rye and hoppy. This one has a nice mouthfeel, a heavy medium, very substantial beer, but not overwhelming. It was hard to believe this was 8%, but the kick came later. Nice deep flavors, great balance, definitely a beer to try."
"D- Wouldn't mind having a bottle or two, but it is a filling brew due to the medium ABV, full body, and robust hop flavor."
"D- At 8%, this is approaching DIPA levels, and it shows. There is a bit of alcohol warmness in the mouth. Overall, this is a great bear that deserves it's reputation."
"Its definitely worth trying if you have never had it before, just to put it on your list of IPA's."
"Pours red/amber with a nice tan head. Smells like hoppy aromas, very yummy pine smell. Tastes like mad hops.Wow, really complex tatse.Nice mouthfeel. Awesome balance with good bitterness and a nice malty back ground. Yummy. Nice medium mouthfeel Highly drinkable, with a nice alcohol warming."
"overall: I am blown away! head retention was fantastic lace was fantastic taste fantastic the color looks great! I love the rye IPA mix extra points for originality. such a well crafted beer man, I loved it."
"Amazing beer - but best left to last as anything else will be completely tasteless as Hop Rod Rye will claim your palate for its own!"
"This is a respectable and assertive beer, but I think they went just a tad too far with it. I'd rather have a Founder's Red's Rye, which is basically a more controlled version of this."
"Overall this is a great DIPA - not too sickly sweet as with some I have had."
"It's bitter, it's sweet, it's dry and it's bold! This is the kind of IPA which proves noone in the world can do it like the West Coast. Well done, Bear Republic!"
"Poured into a thistle glass. Vigorous head, light tan, not very long-lasting, but ok. Slightly hazy, deep garnet color. Aroma of some pine and lemon, with faint rye notes. Slight lactic odor, but I don't think it really detracts from the enjoyment. This beer has a HUGE nose to it, even cold. Alcohol slightly noticeable in aroma and taste. Full body and moderately carbonated. Rye is strongly present in the taste (18% rye had better be) without dominating. Hops and rye blend very well in this beer. This bottle has been in my basement for a while, so the hoppiness has probably dropped. I like beers that age well, and this beer can age very nicely without losing its appeal. I'll certainly drink this again. If one of you can send me some... Beer trade, anyone?"
"D-Can't really go for more than one of these in a night. I actually prefer to split a bomber with a friend. It doesn't show off the 8% abv at all, seems so much less than that."
"Wow, what a combination of hops and alcohol. Definitely an ""in your face"" version of an IPA or APA. I really liked the piney hops aroma and bitterness in the back of my throat. But I thought there was a most interesting off-set with the the sweet caramel malt. A friend brought me a 4 pack of this beer because it is not available locally. Definitely, one I would look for on a trip out west."
"I didn't find the Hop Rod as drinkable as the Racer 5 due to the caramel malt presence. Too many of these and I tire of the sweetness. But it's very good. Better than most. It just doesn't compare to the Racer 5 for me and, given the choice, I'd almost always pick up the Racer 5."
"Served to me in a pint glass with a small head that laced extremely well. Deep, dark amber color with good clarity. Looks more like an red ale then a pale. Smell is large and lovely. Huge hop aromas, floral and piney. Complex palate with a strong malt base and a dry bitter finish. Spicy rye and citric grapefruit hops battle for flavor dominance. I hate to spoil it, but the hops win. Simply put, it's an amazing IPA. My current favorite IPA."
"Exceptional IPA grapefruit highly hopped with edge of rye, which made it quite interesting. Amber. Very drinkable to the point of drop off. Hop burps citrus aroma. Malts for balance.Roast tea, bitter aftertaste. Very bitter with some rye, very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a tasty Rye IPA. Everything about this beer is good, with the body probably being the best aspect. Racer 5 is still my fave Bear Republic beer, but the Hop Rod Rye is another good addition to their lineup. Worth checking out."
"D - Incredibly tasty and super enjoyable. Loving every sip. I could definitely drink a ton of this and at the alcohol level, it would be dangerous! Alcohol is well hidden. Awesome beer hands down"
"Suffice it to say that I was blown away by this beer. I've been a big fan of Racer 5 for awhile, so I'm not quite sure why I haven't tried Hop Rod until today. I haven't been this impressed by my first taste of an IPA since Two Hearted Ale - this is going to become a regular for me."
"I like this beer."
"Drinkability is still good..I'd have another. Easily one of the best IPA's I've ever had."
"Decent idea of what this may taste like when fresh."
"D - A very well-made brew from Bear Republic. Great combination of flavors, and the addition of rye added an interesting touch. Quite drinkable for 8%, and at a great price for a 22oz as well. I will definitely revisit this one again."
"The label also seems to have another marketing error. It states the sediment might be there in the bottle due to a ""truck-load of hops"". It has been my experience that hops settle out pretty well in brewing and it is just yeast sediment in a bottle. Kind of shook my faith in Bear Republic to see that statement."
"I love the racer 5, for the ibu's. This hop rod rye, is way better. This is a great hoppy beer, with the rye its awesome! i highly recommend it to anyone."
"D- a great ipa from bear republic. The west coast really exemplifies the bitter ipa scene. Great brew that uses some sweetness... A bunch of bitterness... And a ton of flavor."
"All and all a decent drink but I think this is a bit overrated."
"I guess I don't really have anything profound to say about this one. It's really good but not mindblowing rye IPA. That's about it."
"A bomber of this is the perfect serving size, well maybe two of them would be perfect... Very tasty. Grab one is you can...."
"One finger creamy white head, slow dissipation, big lacing. Dark amber body, clear, no visible carbonation from cask conditioned offering. The nose is sweet, piney, malt forward with noble hops, some citrus, pretty well balanced. Taste features a good dose of caramel malt up front balanced by the rye, not too sweet, with an even hoppy finish, noble bitterness. Good dose of rye and roast for balance. Mouthfeel is medium, given cask condition fairly smooth. Drinkability has the ABV well hidden, farily drinkable once you get used to the rye malt. A nice change of pace, something that I look forward to having again. Highly recommended."
"On tap at brewpub on 6/29/09. Pours a nice burnt orange with cream head. Rye definitely present in the aroma and hints at what's to come. Touch of malty sweetness, then a nice rye bread flavor with a long bitter finish. Wow, I wish I could describe it better, but seriously, just drink one."
"Overall this just isnt one of my favorite rye beers. The most off putting thing for me was the aroma. I have a suspicion that this might be a bad bottle or something, the taste seemed faded compared to other rye IPAs Ive had."
"D: A little to sweet to drink many of these. Overall probably the best rye beer I've had. The alcohol also brings down the drinkability."
"Overall, this is a very nice IPA. It's a mind-blowingly flavorful beer like some other West Coast IPA's, but it does everything very well. It's exceedingly drinkable and is one of the better rye beers I've had. All said, this is an excellent IPA and a tremendous value at only $4.49."
"This was the beer that I liked the most."
"I am in love. This beer is thing of exquisite wonder."
"D - This is a strong beer, and not one I'd want to session. that said, I have no problem enjoying a bomber to myself every now and again. This is sure to become one of my stronger, special-occasion staples."
"at my house, which doesn't happen with very many beers."
"If you like hops baby this brew is for you. The beer was poured into my tumbler at 45 degrees and looked caramel colored pouring a off white head. The lacing with this beer was good. Way to hoppy for me, in fact that is all you can taste. I will not buy again."
"Very dry, and resinous. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Not my favorite IPA."
"D: Would I have another? Yeeeaaash. If you couldn't tell, I really dig this beer. I'm not sure if it's the mood I'm in or what, but this is really striking the right chord with me right now. I read on the Great Lakes group that Bear Republic is moving into Michigan. If that is true, I would be one happy Beer Advocate."
"I like the edge that the rye brings, I just enjoy my IPAs a bit drier."
"One of my favorites. Accessible, yet tenacious flavor profile. Dewy hops tempered by stately rye and caramel malts. The wonderfully executed tension between these flavors has made Hop Rod Rye a perennial in my fridge."
"I really like this ale. Normally a IPA fan, but the addition of rye gives this ale an unmistakable crispness that is different than the normal hoppy bitterness."
"Overall, while I do enjoy this beer, I prefer the Racer 5 more. This doesn't have the refreshment that other IPAs have, and I cannot figure out why. I like the rye aspect, but when it comes to IPAs I much prefer ones that are less induced with it, and have less of a sour and heavy feel. I can see why it is as highly rated as it is, and I will return again, but it is not among my favorites."
"Deep reddish-amber, slight haze, with a dense, sticky tan head. Juicy ripe citrus hops in the nose, along with a bit of spicy malt. Similar in flavor: intensely citric hops overshadow a substantially spicy malt base. Hops quickly permeate the palate with strong grapefruit rind bitterness. Spicy, slightly grainy malt profile provides some ripe fruit undertones to the citrus flavors. Finishes fairly dry and bitter with hints of spicy malt/rye grain and citrus rind. An intense, delicious beer. One of the best easy-to-find beers."
"As my first rye beer, I thought this one was excellent. The hops and rye pair great together. Really puts the tired IPA style into a new light."
"D - So well balances, so smooth. This is a fantastic IPA. Bear needs to distribute to CT."
"Overall, certainly one of the better single IPAs I have ever had. The interplay of the rye spice and the hops is perfect and makes this a unique and incredible brew. Certainly recommended, especially to IPA lovers."
"I'll confess I'm not the biggest fan of rye, but the taste here is very bitter and way over the top. Too much for me, unfortunately."
"Verdict: Solid and thoroughly tasty throughout, Hop Rod Rye is a great ""medium-alcohol"" Double IPA with a nice rye twist. After such a strong start, I'm looking forward to seeing what else these guys brew up."
"Strong and pleasing aroma of sweet and spicy malt with citrus hops. Very American in both malt and hops. I'm guessing the pineapple and pine aroma comes from the same Columbus and Cascade hops that's featured in their Racer 5 IPA. The rye makes the beer slightly spicy and considerably darker than the IPA. It pours a deep reddish orange with a big fluffy off-white head that lasts long beyond the final drop. The taste is a fine balance between the sweet malt, spicy rye, and citrus hops. No component outshines the other. It's full bodied with a smooth texture and a lingering bittersweet finish. This beer is full and satisfying with a delicately balanced character that allows you to fully enjoy each drop which is remarkable for a style in which so many others punch you in the face with just one element. This is definitely my new favorite Double IPA. Highly recommended."
"12 oz bottle to a pint glass. Pours dark red, very dark for an IPA. Sediment floating about. Small creamy off-white head with brown spots, leaves nice walls of lacing. The smell is very malty, dark fruit/cherry, pine. Bitter hops and smooth malts are balanced here excellently. Pine, caramel, rye, and dark cherry all take turns dancing on the tongue. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. This drinks almost like a mini-strong ale. Alcohol is very-well hidden, a tiny bit shows through at the end. Long ago when I first tried this I didn't think much of it and thought it was one of the most overrated beers in the top 100. Now I can safely say it deserves its place. Well done Bear Republic."
"It's medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation tickling the tongue. The Hop Rod Rye is very drinkable."
"D - I love IPA's, both the single and the double. I've had a fair amount in my days, and wondered if I would ever give an IPA a bad rating. That day has come."
"Very drinkable. Alcohol is not noticeable in any respect with this beer. Goes down easily."
"Pours amber brown with a thick foamy head. Excellent retention and laceing. Aroma is of piney hops,fruits,and bready malts. Body is thick with some carbonation. Taste is all there. hoppy up front with underlying caramel malts. Bitter finish. Very complex taste. No doubt one of the best."
"D) Good! Attractive ale, nice smell, nice taste. Very well-balanced and tasty. I enjoyed the rye - it gave it another dimension than other IPAs which was different but good. It makes me curious to try more rye beers."
"Wow, hands down one of the best Rye/American IPA's I have ever had. This is a classic must drink brew. I could easily session this 8% alcohol brew."
"Overall Impression: Rye just ain't my thing. Luckily this is way more like an IPA than a Rye beer, and I love IPA's. At 8% ABV this one is close to being a Double IPA, which is one of my favorite styles. This one is just a little too astringent and bitter in the finish for my palate, but overall it was outstanding!"
"D i would endulge in more than one. its a complete package and a home run for any rye fans. i love rye bread, whiskey, and beer, and this is probably my favorite in the beer category so far."
"D - A very nice IPA with a unique flavour profile. Very enjoyable."
"D: Pretty drinkable, this one was pretty easy to put down and the flavors were expertly mixed. I liked it a lot."
"Overall this is a pretty darn good IPA, with the rye making it a bit more interesting. IPA/hop lovers with love this. This is the second beer I've tried from Bear Republic and will definitely be looking out for more from these guys."
"pours a light brown copper color with a huge slowly dissipating head it was too fluffy for an ipa..the smell was hops, citrus, rye , malts ,and some spice all were faint however..the bottle says dual hop injections with 18% rye.. im not getting an overabundance of hops on this one nor can i taste the rye infusion it is there no doubt but i was wanting more..more citrus/pine more hops malt more rye taste ..having said all this.. it is a rye/ipa to try to its credit the 8% abv is not detectable and it does get more complex/flavorful as it warms..thiis ipa is good but ill buy racer 5 b4 this one"
"D: It's a very aggressive beer so difficult to have a few on their own. Next time i have this, i'll be sure to have some equally aggressive cheese."
"Overall: If you like nice hearty hoppy beers, than this is a beer for you. What sells me has to be th nice red color of the beer."
"Overall this is a great beer that everyone should try. Get it in a trade if you have to. You won't be dissapointed."
"Drinkability - very pleasant and balanced IPA with a smooth finish that leaves room for another"
"D-ABV is barely noticeable and it goes down smooth."
" The drinkability is good. Once again I believe freshness play a big part in this. I have still enjoyed this bottle however fresh it may be. I will be looking forward to getting another bottle to try."
"M/D - Medium/heavy body that finishes quite dry from all the hops. There is a little apparent heat from the alcohol but nothing too distracting. Drinkability is high but you wouldn't want to put down too many of these at one time."
"I love the initial hop-hit when you dive into one of your favorite IPA's but Hop Rod is one the best at lingering around for awhile on the back of your tongue. There is definitely a strong malt note here. Not overpowering but significant. Coppery and murky. The rye is not overwhelming and it's incredibly easy to drink at 8 percent. In my opinion, there really isn't a bad brew from Bear Republic and this is a great example of the quality they produce year after year."
"This beer is good quality, and complex. The taste is not my favorite, at the moment, but that is personal preference. I'd drink it again although I don't plan on stocking my fridge with it."
"D- Overally excellent IPA. Not my favorite but pretty high up."
"D-Entirely drinkable...never would know that this is an 8% ABV brew. Bear does everything well, and this is another fantastic, enjoyable, and drinkable brew."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking."
"To be fair, I have nicer memories from a bomber I had of this a while back. Since it has no freshness date I wonder if this four-pack has been sitting for a bit too long in a beer boneyard, and it may have lost at least a good part of its aroma, and hop assertiveness."
"D - Hop Rod is one smooth ride. A great beer with great suspension, there are a lot of nice flavors going on here. The alcohol is nowhere to be found and the 22 can be polished off by one person I'd say. Wonderful."
"Drinkability- Well i drank both in one sitting and remained that way till the morning. Goes down easy, great to be paired with chocolate chip teddy grahams, but pacts a little bit of a punch."
"Overall, a unique brew with alot of muscle! This is my 2nd IPA/APA to review that was brewed with rye that I know of(other was Founder's Red's Rye P.A.). I love the unique characteristics that this extra ingredient adds to the finished product. It gives the beers a bready, crispy, and spicy quality that adds to the expression of the hops. This is a must-try for hopheads looking for an extra treat! Leave this one for the end of your session, as the bitterness will most likely destroy the pallate."
"Pours a deep copper red,with a solid light brown 1/2 inch head with good lacing,aroma is heavily hopped with excellent spicing.This beer is well balanced but has a spicey,peppery finish,a tad of rye lingers on the back of the tongue,very drinkable,Its both a great IPA and rye beer,highly recommended."
"All in all, this is a well put together, drinkable IPA. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit with the higher ABV, but I can't really put this one down. Is it a DIPA or a regular AIPA? Make up your mind. Either way, it's pretty and its tasty, and I won't have any problems finishing the 4 pack."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. A dark amber color, with a one inch off-white head. Good lacing and a nice collar atop the glass. On the nose, very hoppy but hidden underneath is a layer of caramel malts and just a bit of bready quality from the rye. Fresh hops, grapefruit, more caramel malts and brown sugar. Such a complex array of flavors, lead the way to a bitter finish. Crisp taste, medium body and carbonation. Just the right balance between rich and smoooth feel. Does a good job of hiding the alcohol @ 8% ABV. An incredibly drinkable beer, with a great balance. If you see this one the shelf, do yourself a favor a pick up a couple!"
"D- Real sessionable, I could drink a few of these despite a hefty abv."
"Like other reviews, I agree the 8% abv isn't noticed, but the caramel, hops and citrus, which may or may not be a product of the 18% rye, balance oh so well. As a huge fan of IPA's, I'd put it against any I've ever had."
"Drinkability: This is a seriously big beer, but the alcohol doesn't make itself known. Delicious stuff, but you can tell it's a heavy hitter."
"D: It took me almost an hour and a half to polish off this big beer. I couldn't really see having more than one or two."
"Can't say enough good things about this beer. Well done, Bear Republic."
"Deep ruby head with thin head and good lacing. Bready, earthy notes beneath a full hop aroma. Light fruit, rye. Hop bitterness and noticeable alcohol combine beautifully with rye to create a rich, full-bodied ale. Incredibly smooth, despite lingering bitterness. This is where the beer stands out. Drinks so smooth despite a huge flavor."
"Poured with a nice dark amber color and with a clear body. I loved the foamy head, it was nice and fluffy with a light beige color. Smell was lovely, nice and hoppy. Tasted just as it smelled, really liked this beer. As most IPAs it had a nice bite, although the bite keeps it from being a highly drinkable beer. I really liked this one, but I always like a good hoppy IPA."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and drinkable. The 8% ABV is barely noticeable."
"Drinkability- This is my first rye beer and I want more."
"D: Easily in the top 5 American IPAs. Just a fantastic brew that I could drink all day long. Price was $2.00 for a single - amazing."
"( My review is from notes on Friday night after having a couple and having a couple tonight.)"
"I would have to say that I highly recommend this beer, as it blows me away. Very unique, I wish I could keep more in my fridge."
"Very drinkable...pretty darn hoppy, but not overpowering. Complex and refreshing!"
"A great beer to enjoy frequently but not one after the other. Easy to drink but definitely a hoppy hitter"
"Overall this is certainly my favorite Rye American IPA to date and another solid effort from Bear Republic. Recommended."
"buy it, especially cause its a good price!"
"D: An awesome beer, for a massive hop bomb, it is very balanced. There is no hint of alcohol making this a potentially dangerous beer. I really like that there is obviously a lot of caramel malts here, but it is not ""caramelly"". Interesting, it seems to be a cross between an old/stock ale and an IPA, definitely not a standard DIPA. Highly recommended. Send this to KY."
"Like I said. Awesome."
"D - I'd definitely consider having another if it were in my fridge. Glad I finally picked one of these up. Next time I'm at a sandwich shop, I'll have to get rye bread."
"overall an exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery..."
"Absolutely fantastic IPA, especially when you let it warm enough to be able to taste the light counterbalance that the rye malt provides to the slam of hops. One of my new favorites."
"Hop Rod Rye is awesome out of the bottle, and from the aroma and look of my half pint pour, it looks like it willead that be the same on draft. The color is deep caramel, filtered clear with a tan ad. The aroma is sweet malt, caramel, below a grapefruit hop bitterness. The taste is sweet up front. Loads of caramel malt, rye spice, and a finish that is bitter but pleasingly so. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy but not full."
"another one of the beers i've seen at the beer shop and passed over mistakenly thinking that i've already tried it, and boy am i sad that i missed this one, for its exceptional. pours a beautiful deep amber color with a big foamy head that laces a decent amount. its smell is legendary, the hops smell as fresh as the ones i use to homebrew with in my fridge, the hops are piney and pungent, just awesome aroma. taste is just as good, a wonderful array of hops are complimented with a nice malty balance. overall its just an awesome beer, and with it being only 4-5 bucks for a bomber it is a very good deal too."
"D: This is my favorite beer by Bear Republic. Very drinkable and very palatable. For the hopheads."
"Beings that I am not a big fan of hops, this scored low on the drinkability factor for me. I would gladly try this beer again, but wouldn't have more than one at a time, probably."
"D- Goes down smooth, and the alcohol is exceptionally well hidden. Could sneak up on you though..."
"Really hoppy, nice kick to it. Such a good beer. A standout beer in an extreme and ever-evolving style full of beers trying to stand out. Well done."
"Pours dark orange with an off-white head. Strong citrus hops in the aroma, as well as some rye and malt. The flavor is packed with a lot of rye as well as some bitterness and hop flavor (citrus and pine). Very drinkable. Not much to say about the beer, but it was outstanding and I will seek it out again."
"D - So enjoyable to drink. A great beer."
"D/O - A well made AIPA that is well balanced when it comes to the hops, malt, and alcohol. The rye is there, but personally I would have liked it to have had a stronger showing. Nothing mind blowing, but I'd still recommend it if you haven't tried it before. Now if you will excuse me, the rest of this four pack isn't going to finish itself. Cheers."
"D - Not that great actually. Again I might have a bunk sample but this isn't the first time I've had the beer. Frankly its too sweet on the malts for me - vs other local ""strange IPA's"" beers with an emphasis on the hop profile. Comparing this to Nelson from Alpine (another rye ipa) isn't even a competition. This is a good beer to compare to others, but its not a regular in my cellar...."
"Honk if you love hops! If this beer were a car it would come fully loaded with plenty of legroom and a 350 horsepower V8 engine. And it's probably won my car of the year award every year since I've tried it. In fact, I remember the first time I took it for a test drive - I awoke the next day to find my hands still smelling like hops. No kidding! This is a smooth ride and for those of you who have yet to take a spin - buckle up!"
"Hop Rod Rye is one of those feel good type of beers. Sip after sip, it keeps inviting you back for more. Highly recommended and a must try! ~"
"Hides APV very well, so easy to drink."
"D- a very drinkable brew, one of the few ryes i've had but def. the best, wish i had another 1 or 12"
"Drinkability/Overall: I could drink this beer all day, everyday. Perfectly balanced, and absolutely delicious. It doesn't quite top Racer 5, but it'll become a regular in my fridge. Bear Republic strikes again!"
"Overall: Just the perfect amount of rye and hops to make this one perfectly drinkable and balanced. I say this unbiased as well because I'm not that big of a fan of this brewery overall."
"Mmm this is tasty stuff. Easily one of the best rye beers out there, and just a fantastic beer all around."
"Drinkability is good, but not better than all the others I've tried."
"D - Very drinkable, at least until the 8% knocks you out. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"D - Fantastic brew can't wait to get another. One can only hope this gets distibuted to Maine."
"D-damn good beer, it is slightly balanced but the hops do shine through which is something i prefer."
"D- The best Rye Ale I've ever had. It's 8% abv is unnoticeable in the flavor and it goes down like a 5% rye ale and keeps me wanting more. Definitely a must try."
"D - Good tasting beer...not sure I can call this an IPA, but whatever. At 8%, a little high to be sessionable. Bitterness is a touch harsh for me, which also limits drinkability for me, but not too much. I would welcome a second serving of this one. I prefer the Racer 5, but this is another good offering from Bear Republic."
"D: Quite drinkable; alcohol is a bit noticeable, but this is a good brew"
"D- Decent drinkability. Some alcohol warmth and bitter lingering taste bring it down just slightly."
"On a good bottle, you'll get plenty of hop brightness, accompanied by the rye. Bad bottles seem to have lost that lovin' hop feelin'. Of course, if they bottle dated, this might not be a problem, the inconsistency would just be age."
"Hop Rod Rye throws the gloves off and comes out swinging with flavor, certainly a snapshot of what American craft beer is about, and we love it."
"A challenging and complex IPA from start to finish. Pungent pine sap, tingly rye spiciness and plentiful caramel malt immediately demand attention, but there are loads of aromas and tastes to explore. Dark fruits, a hint of sorghum, citrus rind, and fresh baked bread join in as it warms up. It's fairly full-bodied and chewy, with moderate carbonation and loads of lingering bitterness and peppery spice. Very enjoyable beer."
"d-good , the balance of rye and hops helps out here,"
"Cheers!"
"D- For an 8% beer, wow, this goes down quick. I'm not sure how extremely fresh this bottle is, but I'm sure I'll be getting this again. Think two hearted, a hair more alcohol, and a bit of rye. YUM!"
"22oz bomber. Pours a dark ruby brown. Maybe I had a bottle past its prime, but I was pretty disappointed with this. With all that I heard about the Hop Rod Rye, I was looking for a lot more. Its a decent beer and very easy to drink, but nothing stood out to me. Again, maybe I need a fresher bottle, but pretty big disappointment with this one, considering how much I was looking forward to it."
"Deep, burgundy color with a thick, frothy head. The aroma is certainly hop-filled, with notes of pine and citrus, but it is also much sweeter than I would have expected with a big caramel sweetness. The flavor is bigger and bolder than the aroma suggested, with an earthy, grapefruit hop bitterness that is solidly balanced against an underlying caramel malt sweetness. In contrast to this balance, the bitter hops are dominant in the aftertaste, which effectively masks any hint of the 8% alcohol. This ""specialty ale"" is medium-bodied and nicely (but not overly) carbonated, but despite this solid mouthfeel and largely balanced flavor, it's the overwhelming bitterness in the aftertaste rather than the higher alcohol that makes this one almost more of a sipper than a session beer. That said, I still happily plowed through this bomber in no time."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorite beers. Goes down nice for a 8% beer."
"Grainy, citric, earthy, dark sweet big complex. I really enjoy this beer."
"Drinkability: Its a heavy beer but doesn't pack the taste punch I was hoping for."
"Very well put together beer here. I can see why everyone seems to love this stuff. I will keep my eyes open for this one in the future."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Both are superior. The beer dances accross my tongue. Each sip begs my to drink more."
"Poured into my New Belgium globe. Pours a dark brick color, great clarity. Has a nice off white head that sticks around and leaves nice lace, this beer looks like a Dubbel, but one whiff and you will not be mistaken, it is a beautifully smelling IPA. The nice pine and floral notes that Racer 5 has are a bit more subdued in this American IPA from Bear Republic, it has more of a malt presence. Once you taste it, wow it makes it's hop prescence known. The taste is the aroma times a hundred. At first the piney hops take over, but then blend beautifully with a malt character that creeps to the front of the palate as the hops bring their bitter to the sides. Some of the grapefruit I expected is on the backend as the brew leaves the palate with a crisp but lingering bitterness. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a bit of a slick oily mouthfeel. As I continue to drink it, that head still stays, making this a very nice beer to stare at up until the very last drop. The aesthetic enjoyment of this beer is right on pace with the taste. As the beer warms a bit the hops become toned down and the malt is more present, and as it unfolds, it remains a very complex beer. This beer is delicious enough to keep drinking, but I feel this is best suited as a single to be paired with a chicken or meat dinner, it will most certainly add to the sensory experience especially as it develops over the course of the meal. Perhaps grab the 22 oz. bomber and split it with someone over dinner, definitely a good choice for a BYOB spot."
"Mouthfeel is extremely creamy. Just about medium-bodied with fairly low carbonation. Very smooth drinking for an IPA. Not much of a crispness to the brew at all, but more like a porter. Admirable in mouthfeel for sure. Drinkability is deserving in that this is a classic template IPA with the pine, malt, citrus and subtle spice. Evenly balanced and each component shines very well in presentation with nothing being too overpowering. I'd recommend this to someone who is trying to get into IPA's. A great West Coast IPA."
"D- Really an awesome IPA. The spice that the rye adds really makes this one stand out from some other really good IPAs."
"D: This is excellent; an IPA that is at once very much a highly-hopped ale, but not overpowering in aroma and taste like other domestic IPAs. Glad I picked this one up."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a dark copper color with a nice creamy head. Laced nicely down the glass as I drank it. The sweet maltiness hits me at first then followed by the bitter dry hops. Awesome hoppiness flavor in this one. Very smooth for a 8% beer. Will be buying this one again when looking for a hoppy treat."
"D: This is an excellent beer, and very complex. I probably wouldn't drink more than one in one sitting, but I'd damn well enjoy that one that I had."
"High drinkability. The hop oil isn't too sticky or cumulative and a person could easily enjoy three or four of these in a sitting. Hats off to Bear Republic, this beer is a classic."
"Pours a nice dark reddish brown like a nice rye beer wth a good khaki colored 1 finger pancake head. Great lacing. Smell is very hoppy, with hints of rye and malt, as well. Taste is a nice hoppy assault up front with some malt (caramel?) in the back. And, of course, rye. A good citrusy flavor all around. Nice and unique with its use of rye malt. Really sets it apart from other IPAs. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, with not too much carbonation. The rye and hops leaves my tongue feeling tingly after a sip. Drinkability is quite good. Will have no problem finishing this bomber, despite the 8% abv."
"D- This beer is very drinkable. Even with this high alcohol content, its not as heavy in taste and feel as others with less potency. I will picking this up again."
"Bear Republic makes another great beer. Poured into a pint glass and noticed about a finger width of head. Pours a nice amber color and smells inviting. This beer nice with moderate bitterness. Strong lingering flavor that would go great with a steak. Recommended if you get the chance."
"12 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass. Pours a hazy copper color with a brownish-red hue, good billowy off-white head, lacing throughout and a good amount of floaties. Aroma is caramel malts, rye, spicy, pine and citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malts up front with a good kick of pine and citrus hops, a touch of spiciness as well. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied and very bitter at the end. Overall a great beer, I really like this one."
"Beer is interesting. There is not a strong forward flavor but there is a lot of hop bitterness that lingers in the back of the mouth as almost an aftertaste. It is not unpleasant. Body on this beer is medium, which is fine and somewhat expected. Drinkability extremely high. Overall, a very good IPA."
"D- I most definitely could drink this over and over. I am starting to understand why this is near the top of the ranks of the American IPA. Will be picking this up again."
"Notes: A great find. I hadn't tried this beer yet, but it is probably my favorite AIPA next to Bell's two hearted and Lagunitas hop stupid. A bit more hops and bitterness than Bell's."
"Drinkability...Overall, not my cup of tea, but a good example of the AIPA as I understand it. For my tastes, Bell's Two Hearted is a better choice."
"I'd rather pick up Hopstoopid, Gordon, or DFH 90 for about the same price. I probably won't get it again but I would recommend it if you're a fan of big bitter beers and the rye adds an interesting kick on the finish."
"i really liked this beer. especially the spicy bitter flavors of the hops balanced with the rye. Bear Republic is definately on the radar."
"D- Very drinkable and a great beer."
"Darkish brown/amber, although copper and mahogany when held up to light. Thick two finger head with alot of staying power. Lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Breadiness in the smell along with hops and a hint of alcohol. Nice piny bite of hops up front. Then sweet malty notes. The rye finish is the real treat for this one. Just a really pleasant finish and aftertaste. Noticed alcohol more in the smell than in the taste, so I'd consider the 8% to be hidden well."
"Other- I have mixed feelings about this beer. Dont get me wrong, Its a great beer, and I enjoyed it, I was just hoping for more rye I guess."
"This stuff is smooth and highly drinkable."
"I appreciated the uniqueness of the rye in this Imperial IPA. Pours dark like a Brown ale/IPA hybrid. Smells of rye, scotch, grapefruit, lemon, and grassy pine. Rye is very noticeable in the taste and brings a dark, spicey quality to a good Double IPA. The appearance and smell was very nice and it's unusual to get these kinds of aromas from a beer this dark. Mouthfeel was close to perfect. Silky, chewy, heavy and nectary with nice tiny-bubble carbonation to make it feel creamy. Even though I found this beer a real treat it was one to be savored."
"Overall, a great rye IPA. A style that I wish more breweries took a shot at. Highly enjoyable & recommended."
"Overall-once again, I couldn't really determine that it was rye based on the taste alone, but still, this is a great beer from a brewer that I've really come to respect."
"poured into my duvel glass. pours a dark copper color with a thick white head that lingers for some time (great lacing throughout). aroma is big hops here and some alcohol present. taste is hoppy (alcohol is bodly present) slightly malty and not to forget about the rye taste, not really heavy at all. great blend of hop and rye. aftertaste is bitter( but it is great0 somewhat dry. all around a great beer!"
"D. I don't want to find out how many bombers of this I could down in a night but the abv is nowhere to be found and the balance is pretty much perfect if you like a nice hoppy beer that has a few extra dimensions. Easily one of the best IPAs I've tried. Highly recommended."
"Color is brown and hues are mild and golden. Large flamboyant overflowing white head with high degrees of lace retention. Nose is full but not overpowering...lots of hoppiness but the Rye does a great job of taming it and keeping it in balance. Lots of grapefruit and spiciness in the nose. Toasty rye dominates the finish with a foreground of restrained hoppiness. The slightly sourness of the Rye comes in great play with the mountain of hops in here. The citrus and spicy herbalness is kept in healthy check. Its very drinkable."
" Drinkability is great, but I don't know that I could call a beer this complex a session beer. I will update this statement if I find it otherwise after a few sessions with it. =P"
"Mouthfeel is nice as you can still taste bitternes several seconds after you swallow. Very very drinkable."
"D=good beer, medium drinkability due to ABV."
"This is a fantastic beer that may be listed as an IPA, but definitely pushes into the double/Imperial IPA category. The extra malt presence gives it more balance and much more complexity than other IPAs/IIPAs."
"Drinkability: dangerously drinkable. Strong but balanced, this could get me into trouble."
"D - The alcohol is well hidden on this one...I love the addition of rye to IPAs...it just sets them off...this one had all the hops and a dash of rye and it made it delicious...I'm happy to see these in 12 oz. bottles now"
"Drinkability: Moderate - I enjoyed the solid bitter aspect, but I really wish there was a smell to compliment and enhance it a bit; other aspects of the beera are solid as well; 8% ABV is a bit high for many of these in a night."
"Very good beer."
"A well structured beer that balances sweet, spicy, and bitter very well and progresses nicely. I could possibly see this one aging for a year or two."
"D: I think I drank three 16oz pints in 30min. This is a tremendous beer."
"D - Medium-plus. An upper-second-tier IIPA overall with a nice twist to it."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Pours a clean golden/amber color with absolutely perfect clarity. It gives a huge frothy head with many different sized bubbles and incredible lacing that produces tons of different patters covering every part of the glass. By far the best looking IPA I've ever had and one of the best looking beers in general I've ever tried. The smell is good, floral hints and citrus and pine hops, smells good. The taste is very good as well. Not quite as strong as I expected but very, very good. It tastes clean and pure, if that makes sense. The mouthfeel is good, pretty well balanced, a bit lighter than I expected but incredibly clean refreshing. For a beer that is fairly high in ABV, this was incredibly drinkable, really just drinkable in general. This was a very enjoyable beer, I look forward to having many more in the future, especially on hot summer days."
"This has always been an old reliable standby and it worked great on cask. I would love to see this more often on cask at the T."
"I wish I bought a six pack of this, instead of a bomber. But then again, the high abv limits you to maybe one bomber or two 12 oz bottles. The expected alcohol burn is non-existant, the hop bitterness doesn't destroy your palate, and the mouthfeel has the perfect amount of carbonation. I think I found my favorite IPA."
"this ones sort like stone levitation and founders rye pale had a baby and matured into an 8% monster. super hoppy with a hint of sweet malts. one of the smoothest high gravs around and a super awesome value at 4.50 a bomber."
"Found this at House of Wines in Marietta, OH for $5.99 a bomber. Never been the biggest rye fan but this one may change my mind. I'm not sure I've ever smelled so much hops right after cracking the bottle open. Not a single flaw in appearance. Tons of rye and hops, but a great balance with some malts at the finish. Worth it anytime."
" A must try! Get Some!!!"
"This is not your everyday IPA, probably the most unique IPA I have ever had. Pours a very dark, almost opaque reddish brown with a creamy one finger head that retains quite well. Spotty lacing is left on most of my glass with some good blankets in some spots. Smells of hops, sweets, a bit of alcohol and more piney/woody hop characteristic. The taste is also of HUGE hops, tons of pine/wood, malts, some alcohol and some good sweetness but not too much. Mouthfeel is medium with a good hoppy aftertaste coating left on the tongue, alcohol brings in a good warming effect. Drinkability is good but not great, alcohol might become too much and the piney/woody hops will definitely overcome the palate after one or two of these, still a great IPA and a unique experience. I used to think this was the greatest but this time around it has become a solid, great tasting IPA instead."
"Drinkability: Really high. There's a lot of flavor in this beer, and it's really full and satisfying."
"Pours a crystal clear redish/amber with a tan/cream head that should moderate retention. Aroma was medium to large consisting of a large citrus hop presence with mild grassy notes and faint caramel malt. Taste begins with citrus sweetness balanced with a bready malt flavor, then transitioning into a strong grassy bitterness that continued into the finish. Mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body. Overall, I found this beer to be well balanced upfront, but too bitter on the finish for my taste and would not have more than one."
"Drinkability: Great. I could have one of these any time. Very well balanced, not overly bitter but definitely packs enough rye/hop punch to make you take your time with it. Sipping slowly, letting the flavor linger. I love ryes, and it seems challenging to make them well. I've had some watery ones and some that are just too powerful in terms of flavor. This one is incredibly well balanced, probably the best I've had."
"The feel is this beer is a light medium bodied beer. It is light on the pallet and goes down pretty well. Is a great pleaseant feel to this beer and it easy drinking."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with medium persistent head which leaves nice lacing on the surface. Smell is excellent with big piney citrusy hops with some toasted malt. Taste again has very nice piney and citrusy hop flavor. The rye tang is noticeable but really complements the rest of the flavors nicely. Significant sweet and slightly toasty malt backbone. Great full bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Overall an awesome and unique IPA."
"Tends to leave a slight alcohol resonance afterwards--but it is well in check. I want to take my time sipping on this brew."
"Notes: The first in a short series of 4 Bear Republic beers that I bought and will rate. This is a huge beer that does not disappoint."
"D- great on tap or by bottle. Worth picking up to have with friends or just mid-week. Reminds me of the type of good craft beer you could break someone in on!"
"Medium bodied with a bit of stickiness, contributing to a pleasantly lingering hop bitterness. A really good beer, and even better at its price point."
"Quite an impressive beer, pours a brownish-red, light tan head that quite bubbly. Excellent aroma, really comes through with the citrus of the hops, overpowers the malts. The rye really comes through in the flavor, some caramel flavors, overall the malt profile does an excellent job of balancing out the hops. Finishes dry, with a decent amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable, very enjoyable, not sure why I've waited so long when I see it so often..."
"D- Meh. Given the ratings, I was expecting much more. While I'm not the ultimate hop head, I do appreciate many super hoppy beers, this just isn't one of my favorites. I think it's adventurous and unique, but I doubt I'd drink more than one of these and would go after a Racer 8 or one of BR's other brews."
"D: Very good. Very complex. Not over the top hoppy (not that there's anything wrong with that.) A wonderfully balanced beer that I highly recommend!"
"D- Fairly high to outrageous... with myself falling in the latter of the two. Give me more! NOW! This reminds me of a bastardized dunkel of the Racer 5... and it blows Racer 5, an amazing beer, out of the water. Bravo!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable; though big, the ABV is incognito."
"Drinkability - For an eight percent rating, the alcohol is well hidden (thought there is just a nip of it in the aftertaste) and this is very drinkable. After coming from many Stone products as some of my first IPA's and IIPA's this is not as ""bitter"" and more easy to drink (does not destroy your mouth). A very nice beer and at around four dollars per 22oz at my store, this makes for a nice, cheap, powerful and tasty IPA!"
"Overall: A good beer...maybe not deserving of the Top 100, but I can also see the appeal as well. Cheers!"
"D: Well I could certainly drink more than one, but I don't think I would go out of my way to pick this up again. Very drinkable beer and glad I could pick it up in my area."
"Drinkability: very tasty brew, highly recommended."
"D - Too bitter to want more than one, but this is a well made beer to be sure, just not my type."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm a big fan of Founders Red's Rye, but this is just as good. I would love to taste them side by side. Highly Recommended!"
"D - I could probably have 33oz of this stuff before being overwhelmed by the flavors. The ABV isnt crazy but should be respected. Great beer. I loved it!"
"Final Thoughts: with the strong rye and hop character it's tough to drink but has a great taste, this is a great change from a typical DIPA"
"Deep copper color with a nice white head. Not huge aromas coming off this one but the first flavor I get is the rye then the hops take over. It is a little shocking at first but the more you drink the better it gets."
"Loved this one, will buy it again."
"Drinkability is high, craving another. Not a heavy beer despite all that is going on and 8% abv."
"D-Great beer. I would have this again. The alcohol may creep up on you (7.5). However, its very complex and tasty."
"Overall, I am liking this beer. It is drinkable and has a big hop flavor but isn't overdone. I shouldn't have a problem with my bomber. I didn't even realize the abv was 8%. This drinks incredible for that high of an abv. Bumping drinkability to a 4.5."
"Rye IPA's are really one of my favorite ""sub-styles."" The only thing that could me this brew better, in my opinion, is if they went with a more fruity hop in the flavor, to match the aroma, to get a more citrusy and less piney taste. I'm not sure if this should be considered one of the best brews in the world, but it definitely gets a strong A from me."
"D: Devilishly easy to drink this one, nice flavors, awesome dryness, but the booze presence keeps it in check. I would love to have this on tap. Excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours reddish mahogany color with a smooth creamy off white head that leaves a great lace. The smell is mostly a hops, mostly piney, grassy hops with a touch of malt coming through. The flavor is extremely well balanced for such a high abv. Taste starts out with big piney hops and the hops continue through the beer, mingling with a nice malt backbone and just a hint of breadiness. Medium to full body, lower carbonation, nice creamy silky feel to it with a slightly sticky finish. Despite the high ABV this is one of the best IPA's that I've had in a while and could sit with it all night."
"D: A very good beer. I'm afraid my bottle wasn't even the freshest bottle, yet this was still a very good beer. Would love to taste it fresh on tap as I can only imagine it would be all that much better. Easy to drink. Not overly hopped up, yet the rye doesn't allow the malt to overpower."
"There is no real citrus or acerbicness or fruity burst in the hop to balance out what seems to be just too much really piney, really bittering hop. There is a nice bready malt base underneath, with lots of caramel, lots of full palated malts. I keep coming back to the almost charred quality of the piney hop and how that imbalances this beer. There is almost an oaky or slight whisky quality to the beer as it settles in. The IBU's must be in the stratosphere with this ale. There is a slight ABV throatiness. This is a full bodied beer, decent carbonation, and very strong."
"Drinkability: Great beer. Will drink again"
"D - This beer is absolutely incredible, and is highly drinkable despite being 8% ABV. This will be a regular in my household."
"I'm a recent convert to the ways of the ""RyePA."" Founders Red's Rye on-tap was a revelation, and while I may like Red's Rye more than this beer the margin between the two is slim. Hop Rod Rye is an IPA that does pretty much everything right: its a hop bomb, has a good bittering finish, has quality malt, is playful, and leads to good ""hop burps."" Kudos to Bear Republic -- I've only had three of their beers so far, and they have all been fantastic (time to go deeper into their lineup, I think). This is going to be a beer that I purchase quite often in the future, and I'm confident that you will think the same once you've tried it."
"Edit: As this beer warms the peppery spiciness of the rye comes through more."
"This is very drinkable."
"A dark amber as it pours into a pint glass. Hardly any head the first time, so I poured the rest of the bomber aggressively and was rewarded with two fingers worth. The aroma was citrus, as expected in an IPA. The taste was a sweet grapefruit. Feel is good and drinkability is also good for an 8.0 ABV. The fly in the ointment was a very bitter aftertaste that clung to the back of the throat. If not for that, taste would rate 4.5. AleSmith still the flagship IPA for my money."
"This a really great beer that I am going to have to keep stocked in my fridge."
"Being from California, I am fortunate that Bear Republic Beers are so tasty and readily available in my area. The full line is always on stock at multiple locations."
"This is a dangerously good beer. The brews at Bear Republic disguised this beer very well, giving it a nice smooth feel and finish while hiding the high ABV. Cheers!"
"this is an incredibly drinkable beer.reminds me of alpha king but a bit more complex and intense.i'm glad they started to release this in four packs."
"Picked up a bomber. Pours a deep amber / chestnut with a nice beige head; excellent head retention and lacing. Aroma is of piney hops, faint touches of toasty malts - along with some spiciness and a hint of alcohol. Taste is pretty exceptional: piney hops up front give way to a blend of spicy / rye + sweetness - nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice - carbonation seems just about right, leaves a little stickiness on the palate. Pretty drinkable for 8% - really good stuff!"
"D: Exception beer. Best in its class. Would put this rye right up there with my favorite ESB's and Doppelbocks as my most flavorful daily drinkers."
"Overall, very solid beer that I could drink easily in a night and would go back for more. Strikes me as it would be great with some BBQ and a great introduction for those looking to familiarize with rye."
"Not sure this is properly classified as an American IPA. At 8% ABV, it approaches the DIPA style. Moreover, it is vaguely similar to Arrogant Bastard Ale, which is classified as an American Strong Ale. This is one of my favorite ""specialty beers."" Kudos to Bear Republic. All their beers are exceptional values. I bought this for $6.49 a four pack of 12oz bottles in Northern California."
"Taste is malty and sweet at first, with a very smoky and hoppy finish. This really isn't too hoppy, but there is a great hop presence. Really an enjoyable beer and not too much of a hurt on the wallet."
"D: Tasty & substantial beer, I savored this slowly. Not one I'd have several pints of at one go!"
"Great drinkability for a beer of 8% ABV. I could session this, but pay for it later. I absolutely love rye IPA's. It is such a great combination and this one is cerainly in the top three of the category. I will be seeking out a fresh bottle of this and rereview."
"Overall this is a strong beer that really hits the taste buds hard and while I could drink the four pack the hops would numb the tongue after the second."
"I have to admit, this one just doesn't hold up. It is still good, but when comparing it to the likes of Founders, Great Divide, or Hoppin Frog, this one kind of loses out. A bit overrated and just seems to lack a certain punch that most great IPAs have."
"Drinkability - I'm on my first one right now. I'll have to see how I progress through this 4-pack, but as I've usually found out the hard way, if it's sold in a 4-pack there's probably a good reason for that. Although right now this is going down pretty darn well!"
"I can't believe this is 8%. Very smooth and easy to drink. I could drink this all day. This has broken into my top 5. I can't believe this is only $7.50 a 4 pack for a beer this tasty."
"11oz sampling. Poured a reddish-brown color with a towering, frothy creme colored head with good retention and good lacing. Some large yeast chunks sink to the bottom of the glass, but do not affect the clarity of the ale. Aromas are bold rye malt with some citrus hints as well. Taste reveals loads of rye up-front which immediately tingles the tongue with a peppery effect. Caramel flavors are also present. Citrus notes are present as well with a large dose of pine on the finish. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with a nice oily resin towards the finish. Balance is tremendous here and really channels all the flavors across the palate. Although complex, it comes across simple, which aids its drinkability. Alcohol is well concealed. It's been awhile since I had this one and is definitely one I will go back to again and again. Great quality ale and great value as well!"
"Bear Republic strikes again! I feel awful to be so late to the wonderous wold of BR; they have created two of the best beers to cross my taste buds. The Hop Rod Rye smells delicious, tastes smooth, with a powerful, but not overbearing, mouthfeel. At the very reasonable price, there are few ""select"" beers at much higher prices that simply could not compete here. Bring me more Bear Republic, they create massive winners."
"Cheers!!!"
"Great drinkability for an 8%. Taking it slow though. I've let it warm up to room temp and the flavor is just awesome. Highly recommend."
"This one is a pleasure.. a world class beer."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is above average, could have a couple of these bombers. Overall, this is one fine IPA. I really enjoy a good Rye and wish other brewers would pursue this ingredient. Very good. Skal."
"D- Not sessionable, but I would do 2-3 12oz in a night if I focused on it. Now that these come in a smaller package, I will be bying more of it on a semi regular basis here and there. Im not blown away by HRR, but this is a damn fine bier."
"I have been looking forward to trying this beer for a while and it did not dissapoint! Poured a darker gold with a nice white lace. The smell wasn't as Rye as I thought it would've been. Sweet though. The taste was honey sweet, very delicious, and there was a touch of bitterness maybe from the rye instead of the hops. Extremely drinkable and the price can't be beat!"
"The Hop Rod Rye is a magnificent beer, but also characterizes both the strengths and weaknesses of the Bear Republic brewing company. These folks make make strong, distinctive beers that are highly individualistic and uncompromising. They also, often have a lack of polish to them that you've probably come to expect from a lot of other beers. The Hop Rod Rye is probably an 'acquired taste', but given time, this one has more to offer than just about any other beer in its price range ($4)."
" Drinkability is good. I guess it all comes down to how much you like the rye malt flavor. I probably won't seek this one out again, but i will enjoy the rest of the bomber, thoroughly."
"Poured 22oz. bottle into a pint glass. Ruby red color, thick creamy head. this beer is darker than I was expecting. Great lacing as well. Smells very fruity, artificial grape smell, floral. Taste fruity as well, big hop kick in there. Medium bodied, lots of carbonation. I had a tooth problem when I drank this and for some reason this beer killed my tooth, I never had any problems with other beers but this one was very painful but I couldn't stop drinking it."
"Drinkability isn't great, but it is good. This is filling me up quick, but there is almost no hint at the 8%. Solid offering."
"D: I could drink this one cold on a hot day or cellar temp on a cold night. Or anytime, really. It's a very interesting, complex beer that also happens to taste good and go down nice and smooth."
"Overall this is an amazing beer with all sorts of different notes. After having my first one the flavor has been haunting me for weeks."
"A hands down great beer. Enough said..."
"Great bottle of brew I picked up for $5.50...can't do much better than that. Wish I had 2 bottles!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a massive off-white head that has good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Surprised by the amount of malt in the aroma. Some citrus hops is also detected. I found it well balanced with a solid caramel malt base. Citrus and pine lets you know there is a healthy hop bill. The rye is detected in the finish with an exotic spiciness. No hint of the 8% ABV. Found it dry overall. Chewy texture, medium body, good carbonation, and all seemed well matched. This beer manages to balance three distinct qualities between malt, hops, and they rye. Bitterness as well as ABV is high so that limits drinkability."
"D - the amazing taste makes you want to take sip after sip(not chugging friendly) i had 22oz. and could do another one easily. respect the 8% though."
"M/D: So big, so full, so wonderful. It keeps going, and going, and going, and never overwhelms, but rather envelopes in warmth."
"Drinkability: An above average stand alone beer that's complex but balanced"
"D: Excellent. Well, it's not exactly an easy drinking beer, but it's really tasty, so you will want to drink more of it."
"Drinkability: I've had this one before from the bottle and will be going back to it again. In fact it was the bottled version that led to my fondness for beers made including rye malt. It would be easy to consume two or three of these in an evening and the flavor and aroma guarantee I'll be keeping this one on my shopping list."
"D - This beer is delicious, but it is slightly heavy and the 8% APV could definitely sneak up on you. Personally speaking, I think that this is the perfect beer to have with a meal."
"At one time this was my favorite beer. The hoppiness combined with the Rye was a flavor that was perfectly blended. Lately, something about the flavor is more subdued than at one time and I think the Racer 5 is ultimately a better choice but the hop rod rye is definitely a tryer if you find it at the store."
"To think that I paid $5.49 for this beer, and I got the worst deal on the entire page really says something about this beer. For the price, you'll have a really hard time finding an IPA that even comes close. This beer has the entire package. Delicious, balanced, and complex. A truly enjoyable drinking experience that I can't wait to recreate in the near future."
"Drinkability: Believe the hype. It's beers on the top 100 like this, which you can get for under $5 a bottle, that really make me excited about some beer you can get at your fingertips that's so above and beyond your average brew. The fact that the price is so low, in addition to the quality, not to mention the slightly high but not-too-high ABV, make it something that should probably be a huge staple in my future."
"D. I recommend anyone try this brew, truly amazing. Very high quality, drinkable and not too expensive!"
"cheers."
"Drinkability- I was really looking forward to this beer due to the high ratings on BA. But I am sad to say I will not be buying this one again. Maybe it is just west coast IPA's they seem overly bitter with no hop taste or good aroma."
"Overall, this is a classic in my book. A real treat if you're into hops and something that I could enjoy for a long time, although you'd have to be a little careful with that abv."
"Glad to see this one in 4-packs."
"This beer was a first for me so I am not accustom to a rye beer. Overall it is a great beer if rye is the desired drink. The darker reddish, orange hew of coloration produced a fair amount of head that trailed off to wisps to tantalize the palate. The Fresh hops smell of the beer wanted to make me take it camping where the woods smell of pine would fit in. Overall the taste was that of vanilla. Overall A great beer to enjoy more likely in the cooler parts of the year."
"Served: in an imperial pint glass."
"Notes: Let this one warm up. It's good cold, what with the hoppy bitterness pummeling the taste buds, but it becomes much more flavorful and complex as it sits in the glass. That hot and sweet rye is a little shy at first, so give it time to come out and play."
" a quality hoppy brew and the rye only adds further depth in the feel and flavor."
" pours rich amber, tan head with nice lacing. the aroma is of pine and toasted malt. medium body and rich with sweet malt feel on tongue. nice balanced hops. the rye blends into a wonderful grapefruit finish that just does not quit. cant say anything bad about this beer, a favorite."
"Dark amber color with a nice tan head. Nose has rye, caramel malts and citrus hops. Taste is again a blend of candy malts, bitter fruity hops with a hint of rye in the finish. Medium body i swell carbonated. Another good beer from Bear Republic. Nothing too special, but still good."
"D - This is one of my favorite beers. Well done Bear Republic!"
"Pours a deep murky orange with frothy off-white head that lasts and dissolves into a heavy ring around the glass. The aroma has sweet caramel and resinous piney hops. The flavor upfront is sweet caramel and big piney hops and ends with a lasting grapefruit bitterness. It almost has a tart flavor. Its a medium-bodied beer that is sticky. Its a pretty good beer although I think its variety of hops that makes it just a touch less drinkable."
"I guess I should expect this from Bear Republic, but this is a great beer."
"D: I don't really like the way the rye and the hops come together. If this is representative of what rye IPAs are like, I think I'll pass."
"4.5 D: This is a winner. The apperance and smell aren't anything special, but everything else is amazing."
"Drinkability: My first beer from Bear Republic, and it's a winner. A really nice mixture of malt and hops in this brew. Next up, Racer 5."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"Sorry, but for me the hop bitterness is extremely off-puting. This is just way too out-of-balance for me to find any enjoyment here."
"a darker amber IPA with a rye. decent head with very thick lace. citrus nose of grapefruit. as it get warmer expands... orange, rye malt, and lemon. very nice earthiness that holds a great backbone of woodiness resin. an oily palate of grapefruit and a bitter peppery resin like finish that sits. the beer has a grassiness in the bitter even. and a fruit that is complementary. there is a tangerine for an instant even. very very complex malt and hop relationship. i imagine a wonderful one to come back to a be a bit surprised at the caliber."
"After having the Racer 5 several times, I expected this to be an amped up version but it's really quite different. It's enjoyable but not as good as the Racer. Possibly a better cool weather beer but tonight is not the night to find out."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that I love. I am starting to be more into rye beers and this is a fantastic beer for the style. I will be looking to trade for this again very soon."
"D- A nice rye/IPA hopbomb that is interesting to say the least and definitely worth a try."
"Wow I'm surprised when a great brew shows up and doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Pours a very deep Amber, you can't see thru the glass. Great head that stays put, nice lacing. Citrus nose I didn't expect to be honest. Nicely bitter and I suspect the Rye supports this as well as the hops. tremendous hop intensity that feels good in the mouth and finishes like a champ. No way in hell you can't like this brew and be a BA."
"Drinkability: A very tasty brew...tastes great and easy to drink. Not overly hoppy, just the right bit of sweetness...a perfect to just sit back and enjoy slowly.. I will be looking for more of these."
"Drinkability - High. This is a great West Coast APA. Savor or the 8.0 ABV% will have you begging for mercy."
"This beer is a masterpiece. A+. The end."
"overall - i dont know if this is an ipa or a dipa or a rye beer ... but i dont care its as good as most of the beers in those styles"
"D: This beer changed my perception of what good beer was the first time I had it. I could drink it all the time."
"D- Pretty good, although high ABV kind of hampers it a little. Definitely a good sipper. Bitterness likens it to an IIPA."
"Drinkability: This is quite the American IPA. It definitely borders on and shares some of the traits of a Rye Beer. As I drink more, I learn a little more about the flavor and the character of this beer. An interesting beer, to be sure!"
"An excellent beer. Very different than any others."
"This is one of a handful (2) of rye IPAs that I've had, and I find that the subtle spiciness works extremely well with the citrus hop flavor and aroma. I'm also not a big cask IPA fan, but this was very good."
"This is my first Rye IPA to review. Wow, it is dark amber, the head was thick and left heavy lacing on the glass. This beer smells citrusy and malty. The color is definately amber with lots of sediment floating around. I don't know if this is common or not. Taste is hoppy with a strong malt backbone, somewhat similar to a DFH 90 minute yet not as malty or strong. The finish is bitter and malty. Makes me think of a hoppy amber ale, but somewhat flowery. Carbonation is medium, not over the top. Good beer, would recommend to others. Enjoy!"
"Rerate: The hops are good, but perspective has shown that while this is really good, its not really mindblowing stuff."
"22oz brown bomber served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear amber/gold with a finger of off white head. Big citrusy hop aroma with some spice from the rye. Pretty solid malt base, but this is very much about hops. Medium bodied with enough malt to keep this from being one dimensional. Aggressive hop bitterness with a drying finish from the hops. More citrus in the flavor as well. This one is a classic to me."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the big flavor and semi-strong alcohol content. Very good IPA and even better for the price"
"Poured this into my 471 glass and this thing has a head like a root beer float, about 3 fingers and hanging over the edge. I love the aroma with this. The hops are huge, there is a little citrus and you get some of the rye malt. The citrus flavor is pretty dominate on first sip. I get a little caramel in there. The rye is just right so you know it is there with the hops. I love the finish on this one. Somewhat creamy, very smooth with the dry finish that leaves just a taste of straw."
"Pours copper with a white frothy head into a nonic. Smells like an IPA should, lots of piney/citrus notes. Tastes refreshing, clean, crisp, with a good amount of citrus/hops. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Really like this one, will have again."
"Cheers..."
"Pours a translucent brown with swirls of orange. Forms a lovely head that sticks around in some form or another. Lacing left behind is very nice. Smell was a pleasing Piney aroma with floral hops pushing it along. Taste was abit to grapefruity for me. The bitterness was a particular type I dont care for, which eventually turned the beer a bit bland. Mouthfeel was ok the overly grapefruit flavor killed it a bit. Would recomend to people who are fans of the Stone Ruination style of bitterness."
"Overall, a winner."
"I like the IPAs with a soft, smooth mouthfeel, & this is one such IPA. I'm not a big fan of the bite that some impart, that attacks the tastebuds. This mouthfeel is like a creamy, smooth hello. I'm finishing the bomber without much problem, so I guess that scores drinkability points considering the ABV. This is a full beer, & I'm a fan."
"Very impressed with Bear Republic. Solid interpretation of the style, and very unique ta boot."
"this is shockingly easy to drink, even at 8%. good thing i only have one bomber here."
"Pours a deep golden brown, a little hazy, full white head that sticks around. Smells deliciously sticky, piny, citrusy, fruity, a little bready. Tastes incredibly bitter and balanced well by the garden of aromas. Mouthfeel is perfect. Drinkability is exceptional, such a splendidly hoppy concoction I could drink this every night."
"D: Huge flavors, and stellar drinkability. This is on par with West Coast DIPAs, like Pliny. A quick favorite!"
"Gorgeous burgundy color on this beer with a 2 cm head that fades quickly. Beer leaves some great lacing from the start to finish. Nose is citrus and some caramel malts and the rye. Taste is smooth and crisp, which was a bit unexpected after the color. Very easy to drink, 8% abv is well masked. Good carbonation and a medium body lend itself well to the style. Beer is very well balanced through most of the drink with a little hops/rye kicker in the finish. I really enjoyed this beer and would be curious to taste a cask version if one is ever created."
"Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I like, slightly wet as well. I like my IPAs to be crisp, this one was lacking a bit. As I sip, I can definitely pull the rye out of the flavor. It's mild though. I like what it adds to this beer. The definitive hop smack is there and it finishes slightly sweet. I like this. I received a big ol' bomber of this and had no problem drinking it down. Wonderful beer."
"Not very heavy on the carbonation. A nice lasting creaminess, but not to thick. I would be happy to see this beer on tap any day. Very interesting with the rye and hops."
"D: A quality IPA on tap, but if you hadn't told me it was supposed to have rye in it, I might have missed it entirely. I may stick to the bottle on this one..."
"D- A 22 oz. bomber went down very easily. Very drinkable for the girth of this beer, I could drink this one all night."
"this brew pours up a clear dark amber color with a beautifully perfect off white frothy head. Endless lacing. The appearance of this beer with it's never ending head gets a perfect score. the nose is straight hops, grapefruit, niceness. I taste super bitterness and grapefruit hops. medium bodied, medium carbo. Good good brew."
"Extremely smooth and delicious. I could easily drink a couple of these, and if it wasn't for the 8%, I'd be thrilled to drink more than just a couple."
"Bottle Pours a nice hazy amber with a good lasting off white head. The head laces fairly well. Aroma is of hops, Rye but has some hints of sweeter malts also. Has good carbination. A good mouthfeel and a watery texture. Has real good flavors. A nice hoppy kick but then balanced with some malts. A nice balance. Has a good finish and a nice aftertaste. Has a medium body. I like this one. Well done Bear."
"The beer was--darker and grittier? overall, than I expected. I think I was expecting something very different from what I got, something more like a traditional IPA, but I did really like it--I think I'm going to have to try again before I form a final opinion."
"Overall, I was not quite sure what to expect, but it is extremely good. The initial presentation leaved me underwhelmed and then it hit my mouth and wow. The flavors blend very well and it sits so well in your mouth. This beer is amazingly drinkable."
"I've been hoping to try this one on-tap since we've been getting Bear Republic beers in NC and finally found it at The Pit. Served a nice crisp dark red with a beautiful frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice amount of malts and rye with a nice hop presence. The taste is a wonderful balance of Rye malts and pine and citrus hops. The beer is quite light and refreshing with the alcohol well-hidden. This one is just as enjoyable as I'd expected."
"This has some exceptional flavor to it. Very nice spicy rye backbone, leaves a caramel like sweetness on the tongue. The strong citrus plays nicely with the spice. Feels very creamy and smooth on the tongue. I want to drink far more of these than I have. Overall, this is a heck of a beer."
"One of the best I've had"
"Bear Republic beers have a gritty hard-nosed feel (like Knob Creek, as opposed to Makers Mark) and this is not an exception; however it is more smooth than Racer 5."
"- Very drinkable... smooth, creamy... like a brown rye cream ale.... and balanced balanced balanced.. and not the hop bomb that one might think... a very good rye ale. and a must try!"
"Dark and tea colored. Foamy head, that was super sticky. Lacing all over the pint glass. This is going to sound obvious: Hops, Rye, Malt in the aroma and you know what, the flavor as well. A nice sweetness up front with a balanced hop and rye bitterness in the end. Tasty overall. Medium bodied, right on for the style. Easy to sip, easy to sort of ""pound."" An all around enjoyable beer I wish were on tap more around here."
"The aroma is very hoppy and spicy with a cedar like element. There is also caramel, yeast, and alcohol. The appearance is deep amber with a large foamy head. The flavor is bitter and like the aroma. The palate is is average for the style. Overall it's a nice beer but too astringent."
"Overall a great regular IPA and exceptionally great that it is so easy to get."
"A very unique beer. Extremely hoppy both in aroma in taste. The rye in the beer complements the hoppiness nicely, not sure why more people don't make rye ipas. My only beef would be it is intensly bitter and dry, dropping the drinkability a tad."
"Very drinkable. I should probably slow down."
"My sample poured crystal-clear, red-amber, with little signs of carbonation. The head is dense and plentiful with a latte color. It subsides into a thick ring of lace. The aroma is somewhat subdued. There is noticeable caramel, but I can't find the hops. The hops are definitely there in the first taste. A nice balance of caramelized malt and hoppy bitterness. The body tends toward the heavy side, thick and chewy. There is alcohol in the nose and a pleasant bitter finish."
"Notes: I recommend that if you see this beer to definitely pick it up and give it a try!"
"d) drys mouth out a but if i have water as well i can drink this all night...just watch out for the 8% abv. Great value beer as far as bommers go"
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep amber with a plesant frothy head. It has an aroma of deep evergreens. The flavor has heavy pine notes and the finish lingers with a nice bitterness, A medium bodied beer that feels lighter due to heavy carbonation, it went down very easily."
"Notes... I first had this beer (on tap) a couple months ago at the bartender's recommendation, and was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not at all familiar with ryes, but I know my IPAs, and this is top of the line. Easily one of the best (if not THE best) I've ever had."
"Super offering from Bear Republic. I bought this six hours away in Dallas and wish that I had purchased much more. Its outstanding."
"I can and would drink a lot of this stuff in one sitting. The chewiness might be a bit much after a while, but two bombers of this is not the least bit intimidating."
"D: A very interesting big IPA from Bear Republic. The rye really makes me happy. Rather than just adding more and more hops, they went for an interesting malt profile that adds a lot to what would have been an already very tasty beer."
"Here's a first for me... Yes a burpability factor of 10. HAHA I can't believe I'm writing this... but really a great taste of nothing but some spicy hops."
"Interesting beer, but not a super favorite. Good, but not really great. Was hoping for a cleaner hop flavor."
"A strong Rye IPA, definitely not an every day thing for me but a strong showing definitely worth checking out."
"Pours a deep amber/red with a thin off-white head. Smell is very herbal. Taste has abundance of hop flavor, you can really taste the raw, pungent, piney hops. There is maybe a hint of citrus, but this beer is all about the pine. There is a nice sweet malt backbone to match up with the hops. Dry IPA this is not. There is just a hint of spicy rye, rounds things out nicely. The finish is nice and bitter, hop oils coat your tongue. Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth, very nice low carbonation levels. Drinkability is fantastic, a 22oz bottle is great for an entire evening. I usually like the dryer IPA's but Hop Rod Rye is an excellent choice for a well rounded beer. I will definitely buy again."
"Flavor is very nice. Leans heavily toward a hoppy rye IPA, but has plenty of sweet malts to balance it out and even hold it's own. The hops definitely have a west coast feel, and the flavoring hops might outshine the bittering. A dangerously drinkable IPA that is bold, yet not palate fatiguing. Only issue I have is a bit too much carbonation. The spicy nature of the rye adds a nice element to the overall complexity of the beer. I have yet to be disappointed by a Bear Republic brew."
"Overall, an exceptional beer that deserves the ranking and hype. Highly recommend. This will be a player in the rotation. Since it does shred, it would need to be a one beer night or at the end of the night."
"Pours very dark amber with a very thick head. The head on this beer was like a rock, extremely dense and thick and the lacing was incredible. A floral hop and grapefruit aroma that was really nice. There was a smooth grapefruit hop flavor with a nice bitter kick in the finish. The malts flavors in this are also very good. The hops do get a little ""spicy"" with the higher carbonation. I couldn't tell if there was a rye flavor as I haven't had to many beers with rye in it. I love rye bread and it just seemed to me that there was a rye-like flavor underneath the hops."
"M - Velvety and smooth, lightly carbonated."
"On tap at Elmer Sudds in Wilkes-Barre, PA. Served in a shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a cloudy dark amber color with about a finger of dense, fluffy off white foam. A thick, sticky lacing is left on the inside of my glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of grapefruit, lemon, pine, caramelized malts, spicy rye malt, bread and more grapefruit. Very little alcohol presence for an 8% ABV beer. Just about the perfect balance of malt and hops for my tastes. Somewhere between medium and full bodied with medium carbonation. Every IPA / DIPA lover out there needs to try this beer. It's very high on my list of favorites."
"Had on tap at Local 44 in Philly. Beautiful amber color with fantastic creamy, off white head. Excellent retention and sticks to very inch of the glass. Smelled oily and citrusy. Incredibly smooth and citrusy, and fruity but sharp and bitter from the hops and mellows out with the rye. Very bitter with a balnaced and lingering finish and strong rye taste in the finish. Absolutely excellent."
"Final Thoughts - The more I try from Bear Republic the more I begin to enjoy. I want to compare this to their regular IPA and see how this Rye comes into play by comparison. Definitely try a bomber."
"D: An exceptional beer. Quite possibly one of my favorites. It is a solid IPA, but adds an element of uniqueness with the rye. I haven't had a whole lot of Rye-PAs, but this will definitely set the bar for any future beers from this style. I am aching to try this on tap or at least get a fresher specimen to truly experience the hops. This beer is a definite must have for any beer lover."
"Truly a wonderful IPA."
"very highly recommended"
"Wow. Seriously. I have died and quite possible found beer heaven. I love West Coast hops and yet crave some balance in the malt section. This is it. I could drink a few of these (though might regret it later at 8%) and it would meet all my needs. This moves to #1 on my IPA list."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a solid 1 finger, tan head. I am reviewing after sipping a while, and I am impressed by the lacing left by the head. A crisp, pine & grapefruit hop aroma is contrasted by the sweet rye. Nothing overpowering, but a tasty blended smell indeed. Lovin' this taste, I swear hops are not the first thing you taste, it the sweet carmel malt upfront, but very quickly the hops hit you, and hit you strong, providing that bitterness, and citrus character, that contrasts the sweetness very well. The alcohol warms in the aftertaste. I a little tart in your mouth, but incredibly drinkable. I definitely will be seeking this out again soon"
"D- Fairly low ABV, nice hop balance. I could drink a couple bombers of this. Will buy some more"
"D- easy to finish. i think id reach for another one if i had it. it would be nicer to see this one in 12oz bottles or cans."
"Pours out a reddish color, deep amber, almost brown. And it looks perfectly clear, with a massive off-white head. It looks very sticky and stays around, though it leaves minimal lacing. I don't mind, it's a beautiful beer, though not American IPA look (possibly a bad classification, but there isn't really a good one). The smell is crisp and hoppy. Pungent smell, possibly some C-hops and very resinous high AA% hops in this beer. There's also a noticable sweetness underneath, with the spicy rye. The taste is really nice. There is a definite IPA hop taste, a bit fruity, very resinous, a tiny bit of citrus, not a huge kick of bitterness, which is nice, balanced with nice malt backbone. The rye is noticable, but I'd be interested in just a little bit more there. The alcohol is noticable, lends a bit of a burn. The beer clings to the mouth, leaving a feeling of hops after you swallow, which I prefer, but the alcohol kind of lightens it up, but not too badly. This one is kind of a chore, not for the flavor, but because of the 8% ABV. A good beer, definitely worth trying."
"Bottle at The Local. Poured a clear copper color with large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex citrus hoppy aroma with a rye tone. Medium to full body with a slick texture. Heavy balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet rye finish of long duration. This is a standout beer and very good double IPA."
"D: Even though I've had this before, the alcohol snuck up on me pretty quickly. This would be a perfect beer for enjoying the last beautiful day of autumn, or any other time for that matter."
"A nice-sized bubbly tan head grows quickly above a big blast of carbonation bubbles, then slowly fades, leaving a chunky, spider-webbed lacing all around. Color is a clear amber with some slight reddish hues. Smells of bright, citrusy hops with a malty sweetness lurking behind. Tastes of more big citrusy hops with the sweet malts becoming more aparent on the palate than to the nose. In my opinion, complexity of aroma and taste is not as sought after as is perfection in the hops vs. malts profile when you're speaking of IPAs. This one is ideal, with the sweet malts backing up the hops, but not getting in the way. A sort of malts as Bonnie to hops as Clyde duo; all outlawish and sexy. Goes down nicely and doesn't put the weigh-down on too much, despite its medium body. Possibly the best IPA i've ever had, and I'm completely stoked that it's now readily available here in my neck of the woods."
"This was quite a unique brew that I thoroughly enjoyed. My style is typically a little more over the top with the hops, but I understand where they were going with this and Bear Republic created a very well balanced beer that I will definitely add to the fridge on a consistant basis."
"I could drink this often and in decent quantities. I am very impressed."
"D: I love the complexity of all the things going on with this brew. However, the rye and hops cause this one to be a little bit of a sipper since there is so much going on. That's OK with me. Its just that much longer that I get to enjoy this one."
"Overall: My first reaction upon pouring this beer is that I wasn't that in to it. The coppery component that I got right off the bat was a huge turnoff. However, the more I poured and the more the coppery taste dwindled, the more amazing this beer got. Half way down and the Hop Rod Rye became one of the better beers I've had in a couple months. And as I said before, you could look at this as an IPA/Stout hybrid because that's pretty much what it tastes like. And to that my beer-drinking friends...I say BRAVO!"
"(biased note, i love hoppy beers and try as many as i can and i genuinely feel this is the best one ive had)"
"Drinkability is a level of dangerous somewhere between Chuck Norris and Jack Bauer. Alcohol is imperceptible, and each sip begs for the next. It's like the beer swallows itself. This is such a pleasure to drink. A classic beer, and a landmark example of how to make quality affordable."
"Finally got this decently fresh (10 weeks out from 9.27 bottling) and what a difference. Rye is much more supporting role than feature: wouldn't swear that grassiness wasn't dry hopping. But easy-sipping DIPA that never hints at 8%. Fits right in to that BR signature simple quality. upping Taste + Overall."
"Pours a beautiful reddish-brown mahogany color with an off-white head that retains and laces far better than anything I've ever seen. Plenty of sediment floating around the bottle - mmm unfiltered goodness. Smells of citrus and freshly cut wood. Taste is hoppy and sweet - seductive as it warms up - just keeps getting better with every sip. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with plenty of foam. This is a truly excellent beer - a nice departure from the traditional light, overtly hop-ridden IPA's - like the cute hippie girl rather than the fake blonde."
"D: I could drink this all night long. Very balanced and drinkable. One of my favorite beers after one bomber"
"Find this beer and drink as much as you can!"
"D: Very easy to drink more than one. I'm sorry now I only bought one and wish I could get it in 6-packs."
"Fruity hoppiness in the taste - caramel apples, pears, hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Heavy caramel malt backbone really does the trick. Brown sugar here as well. Aroma closely reflects the taste here. Rye spiciness that is hard to describe if you have never experienced it. Not quite peppery but somewhat similar. Bitter finish. Very pleasant aftertaste. Goes down slick and smooth with a lingering bitterness. Scary how easy this is to drink."
"great drinkability. i want more bombers!"
"Overall: This is a typical strong American Amber. Lots of hops and sweet, caramel malt. Great to kick off a Sunday Evening."
"Drinkability: Right on for the style."
"A nice beer from the ""Bear"" though for my taste (imo), I feel they have better beers than this."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured a bright, clear reddish-mahogany color with about an inch of light khaki colored head that left a medium-heavy amount of lacing. A sharp hop nose that has an underlying earthiness. The expected hop flavors are present but with addition of rye they have a little something extra to hold onto, which in turn allows the hops to better express themselves. The blend of barley and rye gives this beer a distinctive, pleasant and satisfying flavor. The body is full and satisfying, something missing in most IPAs. As with most IPAs, this beer will burn your tastebuds, but unlike most IPAs, there is more flavor to be had. You will be feeling the effects if you have several, but this is as drinkable as an IPA can get. I highly recommend this beer, worth a lot of effort to get."
"I really like it. Solid and unique IPA."
"D - Great. Would love to have more except the bastard mooching off my beer finished the last 1/2 of the 22."
"i really enjoy this beer. alot. i probably should have reviewed this at the beginning of my night but whatever."
"Pours a dark brown clear color. Cake foamy head, good lacing, stiff, reddish white. Very hoppy acidic aroma. Just bitter smelling. Hoppy sweet taste, balanced. Very slight bitter aftertaste. The flavor of the rye is there. Pretty good taste. Almost as good as Stone IPA."
"D: Perfect mouthfeel and great taste. This one is exceedingly drinkable. Can hardly wait for more in between each sip."
"Overall this tasted even better than I remembered. Tons of hop flavors that aren't over the top, a solid malt backbone, and some light spiciness from the rye. Wow."
"Only drawback for me on this beer would be drinkability and the fact that it comes in bombers. Two of these would be a little much for me at this ABV but this is an absolutely outstanding brew."
"D- An excellent beer that is hoppy like a good IPA, but has a thicker body then I'm used to for most IPA's. I would drink this over Racer 5, but they are both very good."
"The mouth feel is enormous. It drinks good."
"D: A high ABV IPA/DIPA with uniqueness and robustness that is not matched by many brews out there. Bottle version has the distinct advantage of controlling temperature which enhances the earthy nature of the rough and tumble but sumptuously delicious beer."
"Wow, Creamy hops with a nice malt follow-up that balances out what could be a crushing IPA . Damn good beer, very drinkable. I usually have to limit my IPA intake but this is a good one to have a few of."
"Mouthfeel is superb, full and with a very restrained carbonation."
"D- Exceptional brew with well masked ABV and very well balanced."
"had a 22oz bomber of this and it was quite good. the appearance reminded me alot of a english strong ale, special ale. look and smell reminded me alot of gearys hsa. appearance was dark brownish red, reminded me of cedar wood or something of that color. nice frothy, white head that laced the glass very well and formed a nice layer on top of the beer. smell was super unique, very hoppy and malty; both very strong but thats to be expected with a beer like this. one thing i found, along with my other reviewers, was the creaminess on the tail end of this beer. it was unlike anything ive had before. its so sweet and creamy at the tail; such a great balance and juxtaposition from the super strong malts and powerful hops. the hop flavor is more than present, but with the creaminess and strength of malts; the beer is able to stay in great balance. wonderful beer, unique and powerful."
"Overall a solid beer."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle..Appearance: red, brown, lightly hazy Aroma: Delightfully complex and dynamic! Caramel, fruit, licorice. Great balance! Flavor: Rye flavor is beautifully balanced. Very high hop bitterness, but it is hidden well. Strong hop flavor throughout. Complexity remains impressive. Spice thrown in on top! Palate: One of the best textures I've ever tasted in a beer!"
"Poured a deep dark brown color, opaque, with a dense foamy head in my Sam Adams ale glass. Much lacing down the glass as I drank; lovely. Smelled first of hops, but also of bready malt. Taste was like the smell, hops up front and in the nose, but balanced by the rye maltiness, but not enough to take away from the beautiful hops in this IPA. Mouthfeel was decent, and drinkability is good due to the rich taste. One of the best IPA's I've ever had; one I'll always try to keep in my fridge."
"This beer makes pondering enjoyable and is a pleasure to consume. It is not available in my immediate vicinity, but if it were I would definitely have this on hand in my fridge. I procured this bottle at a Binny's in Chicago during a recent outing. The Bogmonster led the way."
"D-Interesting.Well balanced,loved the taste and the feel but seemed to be light in the smell.It did however pair well with Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side Of The Moon'"
"This one can stand up to almost any food pairing you can think of."
"The hop rod rye has a crystal clear amber to red color to it with a very impressive head that leaves immaculate lacing. The aroma is hoppy and malty. The taste is surprisingly hoppy, which is awesome. I wasn't expecting a fresh hop bite. It's awesome. It's easy in the palate and more than enjoyable to drink. Great beer. Love the rye."
"One of the best introductions to a rye IPA you could have. Very well done."
"Gave this brew a try last evening as it was a brew that I have been passing by for a long time. Based on the reviews I figured I just had to give it a try as it seems that I was missing something. I know why I have passed this brew up as I am not a big hophead though I do like hoppy brews, just not a steady diet of them. This brew poured to a somewhat cloudy dull amber color with a huge bubbly light tan head that had incredible retention leaving thick chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma's for this brew are really dominated with a huge hop presence, it hits you hard from the time you open the bottle and make the pour. The hop aroma i catch is more pine than citrus/grapefruit. Caramel like malt aroma is there as well but takes a clear back seat, besides that it is hard for me to pick up other scents. The flavor is nice, resin like hop flavors seem to hit right from the start and just linger at the back of the mouth for a good period of time. I have had brews that have seemed more hoppy before but this one is pretty heavy in the hop area, also not sure the age of this bottle so they could have even mellowed a bit. I think I am getting some malt (Rye?) base as well in the flavor but it does seem hard to find anything under the layer of hops. Quite drinkable (though I was getting hopped out, lead to a lower drinkability but that i just my take), finishes a little dry, nice carbonation. Not a brew I would continually look for but one I would clearly recommend!"
"A nice twist from the typical IPA's out there, recommended to all the hopheads looking for some change."
"D: Despite the ABV, I could drink these all day. This is an outstanding beer."
"D - With more powerful IPAs I am sometimes ready to put the bottle down before I finish. With Hop Rod Rye, I was more than ready to keep drinking more. I enjoyed this IPA very much and will be picking up more in the near future."
"Overall, hop rod rye is one of the more impressive and innovative beers I have had in a while. If you get the chance give it a try."
"This beer pours a hazy dark copper brown with an abundance of foamy, frothy white head, that takes its sweet time going away. The smell is grapefruit citrus hops, and sweet caramel malt, with a bit of grainy spiciness. The taste is a wallop of citrus and pine hops, balanced by a decent sweet malt backbone. The grainy spiciness of the rye is quite evident, and a nice addition to the usual suspects. The carbonation is on the moderate side, and there is only a mild warming from the alcohol. This finishes off-dry, with a nice tangy bitterness from some leafy green hoppiness. Once my palate reset itself to Hops, Straight Ahead!, this became very drinkable. Would that i could have this as the base for a session..."
"Bear Republic needs to 6 pack this stuff so I can have Hop Rod and Racer 5 in the same sitting without dropping two bombers and 10 bucks. But, at $5 for a bomber, I'm sure I will buy this again."
"Frothy head composed of lively tiny bubbles, very slow to dissolve, cloudy amber-brown color with a pleasing glow to it, mostly opaque. Aggressive nose of hops and bitters, mixes in pine resin, white grapefruit pith and field flowers, any fruit is like dried apricot pits, compactness in its punch may inhibit breadth of scents. Lots of foam in the mouth during attack, more full-bodied than medium as it sits very solidly on the palate. Hoppy as a hyper rabbit, less bitter than nose might suggest due to the sweeter grapefruit, tangerine citrus and more present apricot, peach fruit. The rye flavors there but not a huge aspect, blends into accents of hay, straw, fallen pine needles and spices. It expands in the mouth until you have to make a concerted effort to swallow. Stays relatively balanced in spite of its outsized desire to impress."
"I like this beer for when I want potent brew"
"This is a beer that I do not pick up enough. Pour reveals a dark ruby color, with one finger of tan head, and small chunks of sediment floating around. As I was pouring it, the words, ""damn, now that is a glass of beer"" popped in to my head. Rye, grapefruit, pine, brown bread, alcohol and something very herbal/spicy all come through beautifully in the smell. Rye and hops dominate the taste, but there is also a very juicy fruity aspect to it. Slight alcohol burn, with some bitterness as well. Malt and hops combine nicely to make this a bigger IPA than most. The body actually feels bigger than the amount of alcohol present. The slight alcohol burn and bitterness that this one only mildly difficult to drink; in other words I cleared the bomber off without a problem. Rye infused India Pale Ales are some of the best out there IMO, and this one is no exception. In fact this one ranks for me as one of the best IPAs available anywhere. Check this one out."
"D- A delicious RyePA. Nice hop flavor and bitterness balanced out with a spicy rye. Not a session beer, but definitely a good once and a while beer."
"Edit: I tried this again not too long ago. What a fantastic beer! It looked great, smelled great, tasted fantastic, and had great body. It was clean, balanced, unique, and delicious. Very bold flavor, but still fairly easy to drink. Just wonderful."
"Mouthfeel is super creamy. Full bodied. Leaves a thick, oily hop coating in the mouth. Buttery, as well. Just dances around. Very drinkable - the alcohol is masked very well and leaves a nice warmth. What a satisfying brew. So well put together. Without a doubt, one of the best American IPAs I've came across."
"D - Mmmmm good. Reminds me very much of a more malty Double Wide IPA. The bitterness may slow me down a bit but the alcohol doesn't show."
"Highly drinkable and enjoyable ale - nothing about the brew would keep me from having a second (or a third other than AVB.)"
"Conclusion: Not a bad rye IPA...it's big...it's bold...it's spicy...it's good."
"I have only had a couple of Rye beers this one is really good. Not quite Red's Rye by Founders but damn tasty and drinkable."
"D- Outstanding flavor complexities merit a second glass, but I think the alcohol would put a stop to the enjoyment after that."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is extremely good. I drank several pints from the growler in one sitting. I consider the combination of flavors delightful but the abv is the only thing that keeps it from a '5'"
"Pours a deep reddish brown, good head with nice lacing. In your face hop aroma with some spice. Piney hop taste hits the tongue from the initial sip. The rye is quite noticeable as opposed to the usual citrus notes in an IPA. Good bitterness, not nearly as hoppy as I expected, with a nice spicy dry finish. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Very unique and complex."
"*Normally we average these reviews, but sorry Pete, I like this beer too much. Plus, I bought it... and it's my birthday. My score wins."
"Aww this was a great beer. Amber red in color with little haze. Nice frothy head, sticky lace etc. Loved the smell, sweet, rye/honey wheat smells with some citrus tones. Tasted even better. Tasts like a brewery smells if that makes sense. You can really taste the grain/yeasty smells but its still got the traditional citrusy tastes. more blanced then most west coast IPA's fairly wet feeling hops. Great finish that lingers with some great refreshing hop love! :)"
"O - Very good, Very pleasing. Good take on an alternative IPA. Savory finish."
"Good looking auburn brew with a nice head. The smell is typical IPA, but that doesn't carry over to the taste. The rye really shows itself in the taste, especially the latter portions. I like that this has a ton of hoppiness but you remember the other notes as well. Been drinking a lot of hop bomb beers lately and this was a nice change of pace on the hoppy them. Really interesting twist on an IPA, I would definetly like to have this again. Wouldn't hesitate to pick it up if I saw it at a store."
"This pint was pulled during a Bear Republic Tasting in NYC. The first surprise was how different the draft felt, more bitter and more carbonated. The aroma starts with the malt and some low levels of hops. The appearance is a lovely auburn, where red turns to brown. There was no head but a great deal of good carbonation, which felt like a plus. The flavor starts with a malt with rye spiciness floating through. Next is a bitterness with some rye left over. It finishes bitter with a sweet aftertaste. The bitterness is not citrusy as the usual IPA style and borders on astringent. The mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation which cuts the overall body down a bit. Overall it is a good beer that I'm glad to have had on tap but enjoy more in the bottle at a warmer temperature."
"Had to see what the hype was all about. Pours into the glass a dark orangy red color with a beautiful 1"" fluffy head that laces the glass brilliantly. Smells hoppy and fresh witha a bit of malt. Taste let me down, ALOT. Something wasn't right at all. Maybe I got a bad one or something. The hops was right up front with the rye but there was a bit of a funkiness with it. Maybe I'll get another and see. Drinkability was low due to the taste. This doesn't compare to other IPA's at all. Sorry for the bad review, but it didn't do much for me."
"Huge flavor of hops and rye which pours red-brown and overpowers you (but in a good way) with both hops and the rye flavoring. A very interesting twist on one of my favorite styles, the rye is quite prominent and makes for an even more bitter finish than usual, but in this case at least that's a very good thing."
"taste is a tad on the watery side, caramel, loads of hops, some malt, and citrus, end is very bitter."
"22oz Bottle. Pours a deep amber,almost ruby,one finger of light tan foamy head,loads of sticky lacing left in the glass.Big hop aroma with floral, pine, citrus, and a little spice to round things out. As it warmed the rye became more noticeable.Medium body,smooth mouthfeel. Pine, lemon, orange, floral, and bitter hop flavor,with a dry grain,and toast backbone. Crisp dry slightly fruity finish.Very drinkable.Very Good"
"D - This a delightfully craft IPA... A wonderful interruption of the style... The rye is a great variation on the style... This is one fine brew..."
"D- such a flavorful brew deserves to be savored but this bomber is disappearing fast."
"Tastes sweet and sugary like sugar plum fairies. The fruity, sweet pear malt from the aroma is there as is some toasted caramel. Very malty but very hoppy also. Mainly fruit and floral hops. There's a faint granny smith apple drying aftertaste which seems to be the only indication of a 8% abv. Mouthfeel so good it makes you feel like you're floating."
"Only the Americans could brew a beer this adventurous and yet succeed so comprehensively."
"First taste of Bear Republic and was not disappointed. Full flavored IPA, dark red, gorgeous head that would not go away. The rye to me ""cuts"" the hop bitterness without reducing the great aroma and finish. Can't recommend this bear highly enough to hop heads looking for something that will satisfy!"
"I love it and will probably buy some more. My first from bear republic. The Lord bless the hop harvest!"
"The drink is full-bodied with perfect carbonation, and its hefty 8% ABV is invisible to me. Easily one of the most quaffable brews I've ever encountered."
"D: A bit heavy for continued drinking, but a nice finish to a series of lighter brews."
"Poured out of 22 oz bottle into pint glass, pours a deep, dark red color with 1 1/2 fingers of tan head. Thick lacing on sides of glass. Smells of hops with first smell, second smell mostly malt. Taste is awesome! So much hop flavor, possibly the hoppiest IPA I've had yet( and IPA's are my favorite). Mouthfeel is dry and light making me want another drink as soon as I set the glass down. Very drinkable beer but not as drinkable as other IPA's earning it a solid 4. Will probably drink this fairly often and might cellar a bottle or two to see how it ages. Overall a fantastic beer"
"D - Very good. Definitely a beer I'll buy again."
"Pours a nice translucent chestnut color with a thick pillowy head that receedes nice and slow like with long lasting, sticky lacing. Smells floral and hoppy with slight sweet tones. The taste is a big hoppy, pleasantly bitter and floral flavor and light spicy notes on the finish. Medium bodied with a mouthfeel that is bright and lively with crisp carbonation."
"Very solid, and the rye and bottle label make it stand out from what is otherwise a very crowded genre (American IPAs)."
"Don't know about style categorization but this has to be bordering on the DIPA. Higher ABV and a pretty deliberately aggressive hop."
"(rated Jun 17, 2007)"
"Drinkability A 22 oz bottle is plenty of this stuff. I am feeling it after a couple of swallows."
"D - This beer, to me, breaks the mold of IPAs with the addition of the rye, it still has all the qualities of a great IPA, but the rye really mixed well"
"Though the score does not reflect is, this may be possibly one of the best beers I've tried. Pour is dark brown, like iced tea. Aroma is similar to an IPA, with obvious rye odor. Flavor is like an Imperial IPA; very hoppy and bitter from the rye. Clean, crisp finish. Incredible beer"
"Overall, a very impressive and unique beer. I'd like to taste more rye beers to see if they have the same impact as it seems it does on this beer. Definitely in the DIPA class, in my estimation. Also, very affordable and relatively easy to find here in Portland, which definitely add to its drinkability in my book."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very astringent, making for a very dry finish. Drinkability is great. All the flavors are incredible. Everything works."
"Update 7/13/08: I had this again and realized I'd underrated it my first sample. I just love that rye! 8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Taste is amazing. This is a greatly balanced beer, regardless of what the predominant grain would have been. The rye adds an interesting spicy nuttiness to the hoppy citric bite. Once again,exceptionally well balanced. Easily my favorite rye beer to date"
"D- Goes down easy, alcohol not present. Delicious."
"On the second pour from the bomber, the head was nice and chunky and left some good lacing on the side of the glass. Probably a 4.5 for appearance on the second pour and a 3.5 on the first, so I will average it out with a 4."
"Drinkability: Great drink, but fatigues my taste buds with such a full-on attack on a select part of my palate."
"sweet"
"I was lucky enough to find a bottle of this at a local store. The beer pours a dark amber, almost brown color with an inch of robust foam over it. The head was sticky, it stuck to the glass and stuck around throughout. Big hoppy aroma with floral, pine, citrus, and a little spice to round things out. As it warmed the 18% rye became more noticeable in the nose. I could sniff this stuff all night. Medium body and smooth as it coats the palate with hops all over the place. Pine, lemon, orange, floral, and bitter hops assault the taste buds into submission. But there is balance. Solid toasted malt provides the rail for this hop-dump to ride in on. And ride it does, like the green flamed road racer on the bottle. Hop Rod exits dry, but leaves a tingly sensation reminding you of the pleasure you have just experienced. This is a great beer. I love the surfeit of hops, the balance provided by the malt and the way it all goes together. And as I drain the glass, the vestiges of foam cling to its sides, slowly succumbing to gravity, as if weeping that it is all gone."
"Notes from 11/30/04"
"Drinkability: This one is still very drinkable at 8% ABV. The taste really puts it over the top and I'm getting a really good alcohol warming sensation. Will definitely try this one again."
"D: High. The 8% is a little high octane. I hope they decide to 12oz this bad boy. If your into IPA's you gotta give this one a shot!"
"Notes: Hop Rod Rye is fantastic! I just can't figure out why it's not listed as a DIPA. A ""truckload of hops"" and an 8% ABV should justify this, but for some reason it's an IPA. Whatever the case is, this is one that every hop head should feel guilty about if they haven't had it yet. Do yourself a favor and go pick up some Hop Rod Rye from one of my favorite breweries, Bear Republic. You won't be disappointed!"
"Overall: a very good IPA and a beer that I have ignored for far too long. Really well done. The rye is great in the malt and is balanced with the Hops that American IPA's are known for. Definitely something I'll have again!"
"Drinkability is good but limited by the impact of the considerable hops on the palate. This beer isn't overbearing, however you will have some trouble tasting lesser flavors afterward. ABV is on the high side for a standard IPA."
"Drank the growler easily, but doubt you could drink too many of them."
"o:very drinkable for the abv. for me the house yeast profile of bear rep bears is too much. the same flavor dominates their beers(not black bear stout). the profile could also be related to their water/hop profile and interaction. this is a good beer that i would buy often."
"An interesting beer - not sure how this fits in the American IPA category. Hard to give this beer a quality rating based on its category, but in general not bad at all."
"Excellent Ipa, I will have this again soon."
"Very nice, very tasty (more standout sans the huge amount of sediment), but 22oz just about taps out my single-session interest in drinking it."
"D: Definitely a unique IPA. The only rye beers I've had before have been porters."
"Very drinkable for an 8% IPA. Kudos to Bear Republic for this beaut."
"D- Pretty solid beer...kinda hard to find anything bad to say about it...Try it!"
"Drinkability: At $3.99 a bomber my temptation is to fill the bathtub with this stuff! I could probably drink this brew all night, At 8% abv I know I will regret it in the morning. Well at least I am off from work tomorrow so lets pour some more and enjoy!"
"Very nice aroma, mainly of citrus hops, rye bread, and fruit. The appearance was a reddish brown, off-white head. the head persisted, and there was some lacing. Very attractive. The flavor was citrus hops, sweet malts, dark fruit, raisins, and some rye seeds (not as much as I might have thought). The finish is pure citrus hops, and lingers on the palate. Medium thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable, and enjoyable. Good beer for this season (fall)."
"I love rye grain in a beer but I expected a stronger hop profile. Would like to try this one on tap."
"A solid Rye AIPA. It's not the best I have ever had but it's up there. Certainly a good choice for anyone who likes hops. Recommended."
"D: This is the single most easy to drink beer above 5% that Ive ever had the pleasure of drinking. I could drink it all day and night. Best rye beer to date and best from BR."
"This was my first rye beer and noticed the rye lends and interesting spicy note. I wasn't let down though as it was a fantastic beer."
"Poured very hazy and orange. Aromas were amazing. Very hoppy with a lot of bready characteristics. Taste was excellent from start to finish. The hops are out of control with this brew. After taste was excellent and lacing along the glass throughout. With 8% I personally couldn't handle more than 1 of these in a session but could make this my go-to beer."
"Wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. I hadn't experience a red rye ale before. Boy, I had been missing a great deal of beer. It pours well into a creamy orange-like color head. This stuff is thick, you cannot see through it and the setiment on the bottom is something that I personally enjoy. It smells wonderful, it smells quite yeasty, like a loaf of sour-dough bread that had sat out....and I mean that in a good way. The taste is incredible and lasts in your mouth for quite awhile. It is big and bold and with only 8% in the bomber you cannot get into too much trouble. As always, Bear Rupublic hits a home run. I will be adding this to a regular stock in the fridge. I will additionally suggest it at my place of employment."
"D - I enjoy this one a lot. At only 8% I'm not going anywhere. Big on taste and very unique."
"D- Don't have much of any negative to say about this beer its nice and big in the taste and mouth feel. The rye malts lend it a slightly different character from your average IPA as well which is a nice change of pace."
"D-This just got to Springfield and you might be hard pressed to find me from this day on without one in my fridge."
"This one is a bit too bitter at first for my taste, but really ended up being a nice drink, I'm glad it was a large bottle and I was able to fully enjoy the beer."
"D - I could drink this daily, it is a good example of american ipa, delicious"
"Sits real heavy, even for an IPA. Consider this one of your courses in the dinner or enjoy without food."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Dig this beer. Very West Coast style, so if you don't like hops, you're probably not going to like too much. But it's very well-balanced, great flavor. Would gladly drink this anytime."
"Overall, the unique combination of hops and malt makes this a high quality IPA. As the beer gets warmer, the sweet malt becomes more prominent. If you have the chance to drink this beer, do it! highly recommended!"
"In my opinion, Bear Republic's Racer 5 is a much better offering to the IPAs. In fact, I really question the IPA label from beer advocate, since nowhere on this bottle is it labeled as an IPA, nor does it taste much like one. I'd classify as an amber or brown based on the mix of malts and hops."
"I was certainly not disappointed with this beer, after going in with pretty high expectations. Very nice balance and full tasting IPA. I could drink several. Certainly a satisfying beverage and one I'd recommend to anyone."
"D: Extremely impressed by yet another Bear Republic brew, these guys have got something special going on. The AWESOME BALANCE of these heavy hop brews are through the roof. Absolutely going to have to try the Red Rocket and the Stout next!"
"The power of the beer limits its drinkability a bit, but it is just a wonderful beer."
" Plenty of hops in this one! A nice use of rye gives it a unique character, arrogant bastard used to be my favorite kick ass beer, but i think this one just took its place"
"If Chappy's did not have a great selection of beers I would have had one of two more of this beer."
"D - Pretty good drinkability. I wouldn't want a ton of these. It's not insanely sessionable or anything but It isn't a sipper or anything."
"First had this one from a bomber that a friend brought over for a MNF tasting. From bomber to pint glass pured a red caramel cloudy color with a solid lasting layer of cream colored foamy head. Had a nice hop and malt balance in the smell. Heavy hop flavor up front with a nice malty balance. I taste a trace of copper which is the only downside to this one. The feel was smooth and quite drinkable for an 8% APV. I had this on tap a week later and the metalic taste was not evident in the draft version."
"A very dark amber brown in color with a nice two inches of head sitting atop. Smell is very malty. Lots of roasted caramel malts and just a hint of hops. More of the hopping profile comes across in the taste, but this is a malt bomb. Easy drinking and really smooth. Decent beer, but I prefer the Founders Reds Rye."
"My first words at tasting this beer was, ""Oh my God that's good."" Appearance is slightly cloudy, deep copper-brown with a frothy off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma has a sharp, fresh hop nose of pine, citrus, and woods. Flavor is absolutely amazing. Lots of fresh hops up front with a complex malt backbone of toasted grains and the spiciness of rye. Moderate hop bitterness but not harsh at all. Full mouthfeel but very smooth and velvety makes this brew extremely drinkable. Watch out for this smooth beer sneaks up at an impressive 8% ABV. A wonderfully complex, balanced and unbelievably smooth IPA. Don't miss it!"
"Overall, an interesting beer. The flavor is pretty good but I don't care much for the aftertaste. Worth a try."
"Pours a rich reddish amber slightly hazed by the yeast that escapes the bottle. The head is thick,soft and delicious looking,it holds for a good minute before dropping to a thin cap,leaving behind some luscious sheets of lace. The nose is super hoppy,packed full of citrus,and pine sap aromas. This has some of the freshest,heaviest,and smoothest hop bouquets I have yet to appreciate. Nice caramely,spicy malt balance truly makes this IPA a stand out,in the broad world of hop beasts. The body is thick and mouth coating,with a soft creaminess and impresses from start to finish with the taste bud assault that I crave."
"Get this beer!"
"Taste is solid. I didn't even know this was an IPA when ordered and was unaware of the ABV. The nose shows that this is a hop bomb as it warms and settles(yes, an IPA), and the taste hides the ABV almost too well. Is it the rye? Not sure about the rye component but I find this beer very enjoyable and it offers a certain coarseness of texture and pepper spice that makes it quite drinkable. A slight hint of cinnamon/allspice couple with the texture to yield a nice feel and an enjoyable brew."
"Thanks, as always, to Kingpin for the bottle. Poured from said bottle, this is a warm reddish brown(pale mahogany?)hue, with a small white head that fades, but leaves ample lacing on the glass. Tht smell is faintly hoppy. The taste is hoppy yet smooth. The hops are citrussy with grapefruit notes predominating, although I taste a hint of pine. There is a dry note(from the rye?), as well as a smooth malty backing. The mouthfeel is astonishingly great, with intense flavors, yet a silky velvety smoothness as well. Damn you, Kingpin, for sending me only one bottle! This is a great beer!"
"So far my favorite from Bear Republic Brewing. Beautiful beer with a large head and copious lacings. Aroma of floral, resinous hops. Taste is bitter citrus, resins, pine, and orange-pinapple fruits. Plenty of sweet malts for the style. The rye must have a smoothing or melding effect on the flavors as I enjoy this beer immensely. Nice smooth bitter finish. Wish I could get a growler fill somewhere near home or maybe not...I would probably drink too much beer!"
"Good carbonation, just the right amount of tongue-numbingness. Very smooth, even for 8%."
"Great complex brew. Very drinkable and distinctive."
"D - This is definitely one of my favorite beers of all time, and the one that got me into rye beers. The hops really build up as the liquid warmed up. This is simply an amazing beer!"
"Wonderful, wonderful beer - what a top notch drop. This will easily be one of the hardest things I have to leave behind here in the States when I return to Oz."
"Amber red with a frothy off-white head. Impressive lacing. Floral hop aroma with a touch of grapefruit. A spicy hop blast on the taste buds that rounds out nicely with help of mild malted rye and barley. Medium mouthfeel, very smooth. A heavy yet very impressive IPA that I will certainly return to. Another great brew from Bear Republic. This is even better than Racer."
"Pours a dark finished oak with a creamed head that rises to the occasion tremendously. As the head falls, curtains of lace wrap around the glass. Smell is beautiful. Tropical, notes of orange peel, piney resin, mint, and a bit of rye breadiness. Tastes wonderful. Begins with a wonderfully bitter hop presence full of pine, touches of lemon juice, floral citrus notes. Then a brilliantly balanced malt marches through full of bready, great rye notes give a hint of a whiskey finish, touches of red apple and caramel. Finishes bitter, dry and clean. Wonderfully crafted beer."
"Poured a hazy brown with a reddish hue to it. The head retains well and clings to the glass. Smell of bit of citrus hops and caramel and toffee in the malts. This is a very balanced brew with a creamy mouthful. Bear Republic has a gem in this one, a very nice beer to sap."
"D= An outstanding ale, to be enjoyed as a sipper by itself or could easily stand up to grilled meats and barbecue. Recommended!"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Deep Caramel with orange lights, half inch of creamy foam after medium pour. Great Citrus and fresh hops in the nose. Rye bread, orange rind and fresh hops on the palate. Seriously round with some decent alcohol heat. Surprisingly drinkable for it's high ABV. Hard to believe it's not really a DIPA."
"Half inch of tan colored foam sits on top of a dark amber/red body with little retention and some lacing. Nice citrus hop aroma, backed up by a strong alcohol presence and sweet malts. Lemony hops, hints of orange peel, certainly bitter, but a nice malt backbone to keep it somewhat balanced. Hop character is huge, and I don't understand how this can be considered a regular IPA, as it fits every standard of a DIPA. It delicious, strong, and a must try for all hop-heads."
"This gem pours a large dense head that never goes away,the lacing in great for such a malty beer. The nose reveals a woodsy quality with a lush rye grain scent. The taste starts off with a smoky dark brown sugar then the hops kick in with a spicy accent. Smooth mouthfeel for being so high in alcohol and hoppy. I wish I had a cigar to go with this tasty brew. Another great beer from Bear Republic they never let you down!"
"Overall: oh hell yeah"
"D- Highly recommended her. Very solid brew."
"D - Not for the weak of heart but spectacularly drinkable with any beer enthusiast. I would not really recommend this ale with many foods beyond dry-rubbed BBQ ribs or fish & chips."
"A deep amber to ruby color, with a two finger thick, cream colored head. The scent has the sharp, pepper aroma of rye, that is followed by citrus(grapefruit), grass, and pine, with a touch of malty sweetness at the end. The mild taste of malt at the start, that blends with the tasty pepperness of rye. The hop onslaught then takes over. A grapefruit, pine, and earthy flavors dominate till the end. A slightly foamy feel of carbonation at the start, outside of that it is a thin feel, that gains weight as it crosses the palate. This is a very drinkable IPA, with the an inviting aroma, intense flavor, a little bit of a faulter on the feel. Plus, the rye does not shy away from the hops in flavor and the aroma. This is an outstanding beer."
"Great beer, no matter what the style. I think of it as a double IPA, the bar called it an American strong ale, and BA lists it as an IPA. That's a hell of a lot of IPA!"
"The drinkability is very high. The alcohol content is just right. This is a beer that is just perfect for a quiet drink. Its flavor is a complex display of hops. All in all, Bear Republic has made a really good strong IPA, or really a DIPA."
"First experience with BR and definitely won't be the last, will be looking forward to trying the rest of what they have to offer. As far as this one goes, being a 1 pint 6 floz bottle at 8% probably makes for having one of these in a setting at a time. A very solid beer to say the least."
"T: taste hops up front with lingering hops. Really pretty nice. i would have liked to see more carbonation, but it was really a decent beer."
"Drinkability is almost too good, but I'm not complaining. It's a very solid Rye IPA, and one I will definately seek out again. As far as Rye beers go, I prefer Cane and Ebel, but this is tasty."
"The suck-down rating is good. Despite the higher ABV, there's no alcohol sting & the complexity keeps bringing the glass back to my face faster than it should. All the shit going on in this brew is nicely balanced. I approve this beer!"
"This brew pours dark amber and slightly cloudy. Smelly is of hops and malt and the taste matches, the head lingered forever it seemed. This is a hoppy brew that is backed with an excellent malt balance. An excellent ale that has me ready to drive back to SC to get another. :)"
"The beer poured a rich dark amber with a decent fine tan head. The aroma was of rye malt with a bit of hops in the background. The taste was of wonderfully strong rye with a good amount of bitter hops. The feel was medium and oily, but had a dry finish. A pretty decent rye, it was interesting as it was highly hopped, and the rye's I've had previously weren't."
"I tried this beer on a whim and could not have asked for a better result. The hop flavor is strong and somewhat complex with the rye adding to the mix. The amount of carbonation is perfect leading to an exceptional mouth feel with a good head that lingers afloat this dark amber brew. For my taste (Big fan of IPAs that include interesting flavors to complement additional hops) this is an excellent selection."
"Had a pint glass of this and received a leathery brown with rubish tints that gave off a rocky yet quickly receeding three-finger head with a lace ring. A mix of both intense tropical citrus notes such as banana and orange, coupled with some roasted, toffee and caramel malts - must've been the rye kicking in. A thick, almost full-bodied beer with a very dry backbite. A great hop bite with citric, earthy hops pounding the tongue and a stoutish, caramel aided roasted malt taste follows. Unfortunately, a slight alcohol burn derides some of the tastiness. I guess the rye can be thanked for both (the mix of tastes and the burn). While very affordable and I enjoyed me brew (not for the faint of palate), I don't see myself sessioning this one."
"Drinkability> I found it undrinkable personally, but since the guys I was drinking with found it drinkable, I have to say average."
"Served on tap in a pint glass. The beer appeared a very nice clear red with a thick white head that just lasted and lasted. Could see some light streaming of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The aroma was huge and hoppy with some hint of bread, pine and citrus. Very well put together. The taste tended to follow the aroma, very hoppy with hints of pine and some florals. The beer finished with a nice bitter aftertaste. It was rich, smooth and somewhat creamy. Very drinkable beer. Excellent example of the style."
"Overall this is a good brew and a great representation of the style. It is a beer of balance between hops and malt, Bear Republic has another great beer among their lineup. I'm a huge fan of big beers and this falls into my top ten for strong ales."
"pint at Whole Foods Fairfax"
"Drinkability gets marked down a bit because its 8%. I can only drink this at home, and only 1 bomber at that. I still have to sip it because at 8% it goes straight to my blood. If I had two of these in one sitting I'd probably be very intoxicated. I am a lightweight though. Cheers BR!! Still hoping to get out west and visit the brewery someday."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is fantastic. Perfect carbonation that leaves you drinking and wanting more"
"Pours to a creamy, frothy off-white head and hazy brown-amber color. Aroma is strong on hops with some bready malt and a touch of phenolic. Flavor is a well-balanced and tasty blend of US hops, pale and caramel and darker specialty malts and a nice hoppy/malty finish. I do detect some phenolic or chemical-like flavors in the taste that bug me a bit, but the dominant flavors linger and make it worthwhile. Mouthfeel is medium and this beer is definitely good on the quaffability scale for the 8% alcohol."
"More drinkable than I thought it would be. Quite good on all fronts."
"D: pretty good drinkability, a bit heavy to have more than a couple though."
"Pours a strange brownish red color with a very nice fluffy off white head and good lace. Nose is nice hops, but there is a sort of dryness mixed in with some good maltiness as well. Taste is thick hops, but there is kind of an akward dryness to this I am not a huge fan of. Maybe the rye? the malt presence is a bit much for me here, and it is a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is nice, but drinkability is a bit debilitated by the wierd dryness. Overall a very good DIPA, but I think it may be a bit overrated. good beer, recommended."
"Thanks State of Kansas for finally getting off your butts and allowing Bear Republic to come into the state. Poured a 22oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours an amber-brown with a big 2-inch beige head that sticks around for the entirety of the beer and also leaves a quite beautiful lacing. The aroma is citrusy hops, grapefruit mostly, grains, bread, and a bit of the rye spiciness. The taste isn't as big as I thought it was going to be. Its really just a mild citrus hop bite and a bit of rye spice. It's not bad by any stretch of the word but still slightly disappointing. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with little carbonation. It's a very drinkable brew, but just not what I had expected."
"D- Easy to drink."
"My only regret with this beer is that it evaporated way too fast! I will definately be back to get a few more soon."
"Taste-Dark malt, hoppy as hell slight coffee flavor, many flavors just roaming all around the pallet, well balanced beer. Warm and tingly on the tongue dry crisp bitter tart aftertaste."
"D - If you like hop bombs this beer is for you so its a good thing that I like hops this heavily hopped beer is good you gotta try one someday"
"Drinkability is good for an 8 percent beer, and I like the idea of using rye as an ingredient. All in all good, but definitely not my favorite beer from Bear Republic (go Racer 5!)."
"{Edit: bumped Taste from 4.0 to 4.5 on 12/2/2009--this stuff is just too damn good.}"
"At 8%, this could be a very dangerous beer. But that is only a compliment to the outstanding taste and drinkability that Hop Rod Rye brings to the table. Excellent job by Bear Republic."
"Overall, a very nice beer, and one that showcases very well the tasty elements that rye can contribute in a beer. Recommended."
"Whoa! This beer is incredibly dark, it looks like a brown ale and has a head that is pretty large, with a brown tint on it. The beer is pretty clear and has pretty good head retention. The beer has loads of aromatic hops with hints of citrusy hops with a nice fruity backbone from the malts. Not huge on hops on the palet, but a nice bitterness with caramel and toffee in the malts. Can you say balanced? Holy crap, every flavour is mixed evenly for a beautiful taste. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but incredibly drinkable. This is what you call a dangerous beer! Eight percent and tasty as fuck."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thick beige head. It smell strongly of citrusy hops. The flavor is strong of bitter hops with just a little malt & spice. Mouthfeel is acidic yet smooth, somewhat powdery. This is a drinkable brew but probably too flavorful to taste something else afterwards."
"Pours a deep copper color, tons of ruby highlights, mountainous tan head, dense and foamy, and staying put! Smells amazing...sticky piney hops dominate, slightly floral, and a hearty malt backbone. Taste is just killer, and one of those ""this is everything I could want in a beer"" moments for me every time I have this brew. Way heavy on the hops, piney, bitter, resinous, and a kiss of citrus. Creamy and lush, slightly oily, with intense lingering hoppy bitterness. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries. Fantastic!"
"Drinkability: A beauty I never would have tried had it not been for the best of BA list... tucked away at $5 at Wegmans in Princeton, NJ... I've find my joy when Nugget Nectar is not around..."
"wow, 851 reviews as of this writing. Wow, this is a very good brew! I've got to find more rye beers. I love how the rye compliments the hops so well and spices up the beer from good to you've got to try this one! I'd have another. There should be more beers incorporating rye!"
"D: I could drink this with lunch. I could drink this with dinner. I could drink this with (or for) dessert. I could drink this for a nightcap. I *might* even consider it for breakfast, it's just. that. good. The only problem is that the ABV would ruin me by afternoon tea-time."
"This beer has been staring @ me too long @ the distributor to not buy it. This beer pours a lovely cloudy brown with a large tan head! YUM! The smell is wonderful, the main smell is of the hops and then you can also catch a smell of the grains. The taste is incredible, this has to be one of the smoothest drinking IPA's I have ever tasted. A nice nutty flavor @ first followed a nice hops flavor ending with a bitter bite @ the end, a pleasant one not a rough one. The mouthfeel for this beer is nice and if not for the pricetag it would certainly be something I would always drink. WELL DONE"
"D: Yowsah! One rewarding session. Technically, shouldn't Hop Rod Rye be considered a DIPA? Come on, now."
"I can't believe this stuff is only $4.99 a bomber. Amazing stuff - better than some that are double the price. Next time I'm in Illinois I am definitely going to pick up some more."
"d - so drinkable and d-lish!"
"D: I love this one. Rye ales are becoming one of my favorite ales. I'm normally a stout/porter drinker. This gives me something with a lot of character and flavor to drink in the warmer months."
"D- Pretty good which kinda makes me wish I brought two of these bombers."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice light tan head. The aroma is sweet malt, caramel, hints of rye and a good dose of hops. The taste features a solid malt backbone with a really nice hop profile. Another delicious beer from Bear Republic. Rye beers have quickly become a favorite of mine, and this is one of the better ones. Highly recommended."
"Poured a beautiful chestnut red color with a huge head that overflowed all over the goddamn counter. No big deal though, as very little beer was lost. Aroma was very hoppy with a little bit of spice from the rye malt evident as well. Taste was quite sweet and caramelly with a swift kick of hops mixed in. The spicy rye flavor comes in toward the finish and complements the hop bitterness perfectly. Very nice balance and very drinkable as the 22oz bomber in front of me emptied rather quickly. I hope NC picks this up soon."
"Highly recommend this. I really enjoyed this one."
"Really good! I saw this in a local store where I am vacationing and figured it was a good one to try after coming home from the beach. I am happy to have another bomber at home in my fridge. Looking forward to enjoying that one and more that I will definitely pick up."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are only matched by how much alcohol you can handle. I can handle another thank you!"
"Snifter. deep rich mahogany with tons of red, so dark that its impenetrable by light. light tan head. great lacing and amazing head retention. Tons of citrus hop aromas, along with some hints of rye. Rich, sweet malts lead to a nice rich flavor. Wonderful orange citrus hop flavors, along with the flavor of an overly ripe ruby red grapefruit. very well-balanced. thick and hearty, with a nice carbonation level. solid brew. Best rye ale yet."
"M/D - Full bodied and very crisp. Good carbonation and very smooth. Very drinkable."
"Tasted on 5/18/08."
"Bomber, from trade with pantanap (Thanks!) Aroma is a good amount of hop aroma, a sticky caramel aroma as well, woodsy, somewhat of a citrus aroma, and a hard carndy-like scent to it as well. Pours a almost opeque dark brown, more brownish/black than anything with a rocky off white head that lingers at the top of the glass. Taste has a nice big hop note, the rye is prominant as well, lightly candy like, and a bit of caramel in there as well. Palate is sticky the rye lingers on for a while. Overall, This is really good stuff."
"D - Damn fine beer. Damn fine beer. It's crazy and huge, but I could drink this stuff all night. It's been a long time since I had a hop bomb this good."
"Great offering from Bear Republic. Rev-em up for this rip-roarin' RyePA."
"This is a good beer."
"The taste isn't quite as overpowering as the aroma was, but it still provides a decent hop-kick. The hops are definitelyprevalent, with the grapefruit and pine coming out stronger, while the floralness fades into the background. The rye is very notable, and gives the beer a distinct dry finish. It is fairly well balanced and is an excellent representation of the style. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller than most IPA's, while the carbonation is a bit thinner than you'd expect. It is a very good IPA, and definitely worth having every so often."
"Great looking and smelling beer- amber/reddish color, the rye really comes through in both aroma and taste. The hop profile is in great balance with the malt. A fabulous pale ale that I could drink every day."
"Very good example of a Rye Ale. Recommended witout hesitation."
"Verdict: Magnifico! This is one IPA I would love to try again and it gives me something to aim for in homebrewing."
"D: High, so very high in the drinkability category. Tastes nothing like an 8% beer"
"Finally in Vegas! Pours a hazy mahogany brown with thick off-white head with amazing retention and lacing. A very nice looking beer. The first whiff is so strong of piney hops you wouldnt believe it, the strongest ""pine"" scent I've yet to experience in a beer. Taste is a nice blend of bitter hops and slightly caramel-ish malt. A very nice balancew with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Slightly thicker mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Overall a great beer I think deserving of its high reviews."
"Pours copper amber with a thick tan head. Aroma is dominated by hops with a piney, earthy character. Flavor has some caramel malts, some spice from the rye, and some hoppy earthyness. Finish is fairly bitter. Medium carbonation and a relatively full mouthfeel."
"An excellent beer and one which is worth a try if you come across it. I'm not as big a hophead as most here but this was certainly a fine example and about as good as it gets for this style."
"Huge everlasing fluffy off white head on this one. Deep hazzey Orangish colored brew. Man this looks amazing. Smells super hopy, piney/floral/citrus and possibly rye not sure. Hard to pick up on the malts hint of bready/carmalized malt. Wow this is a full bodied IPA that hitts hard and non stop with hops. Superior bitterness after the citrus up front and a rye ending for sure. I wouldn't say that the malts ballance this baby but they are definitaly there. Mouth feel is very good it just coats the palet wonderfully leaving a lasting aftertaste stuck to it. Can't imagine getting another 22oz of this down but the drinkability is still good for what it is."
"D: Hop Rod Rye is an excellent IPA. The only thing hurting drinkability is the slightly heavier body and the 8% ABV."
"D - The dry, earthy aftertaste really sets up another sip. Great flavor. Unfortunately, I think the drinkability diminished a little bit as I continued drinking. Also, the last glass I had of it out of the bomber was not anywhere near as enjoyable as the first."
"M&D-Medium bodied with dry finish that really balances harmoniously with the slightly sweet palate. This is an excellent IPA...best I've had in a long time."
"Few beers can live up to the standard that Hop Rod Rye creates in terms of brutal hoppiness with balancing malt character. Highly recommended beer!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkabilty: Heavy in body. Moderate in carbonation. Has an overall nice feel, nothing special, nice long lasting finish leaving flavor in the mouth that is as alive as the beer itself. This is one that I will easily buy again, however, since there are many more to try it might be awhile. This is one killer IPA, no doubt about it."
"Overall -- I love this beer. Rye and tons of hops -- how can this be wrong?"
"Highly recommended. Among my top 2-3 IPAs currently."
"This beer is extremely drinkable, especially for the alcohol content and intensity of the flavor. This has become my go-to beer when I want a hop fix. Highly recommended."
"D - oh hell yes this is drinkable. This flavor is just completely awesome. Really enjoy this. Would buy it often if I could get it where I'm living now (DO YOU HEAR THAT BEAR REPUBLIC? JOIN US IN GA ALREADY!) Check it out!"
"D: This one is fairly drinkable but the bitterness is pretty strong and I'd be hard pressed to get through a whole bomber."
"Man, this is good.... Really good...loads of oily sticky hoppy goodness complements the rye in this beautifully... Scary drinkability with this one as well.. My first Bear Republic brew and its a jim dandy...I'd have to say that this is one of the top 3 IPAs I've ever had..."
"Fuller bodied than I expected, limiting its drinkability somewhat, it is a hop assault as expected; quite bitter and fruity, piney, but some sweet malts and a faint spiciness can be noticed from time to time. Quite interesting, if not my style."
"Cheers to Bear Republic, they are making kick ass beers, keep them coming!"
"D - Drinkability is quite good. The alcohol is hard to detect. It is easy on the palate but still has a nice bitter IPA finish to it. I would have no problem drinking a couple more of these. Worth a try."
"D: This is the best example of this style I have had to date. I buy time and time again, its a go to brew! I don't notice Rye but it is still the best American IPA, in my opinion. Defintely try it once, you will go back!"
"On tap at Moan and Dove. The drink had a dark amberish appearance with a generally thin head and decent lacing. Aromas were mixtures of malts, florals and some woody, almost raisin-like smells. Taste-wise, I sensed the malts more, leading to an overall sweet taste. Good, medium body also. I enjoyed this, but I think I was not as amazed as some people have with this drink. It was just above average for me."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a nicely balanced strong IPA. The rye is a great feature with this beer and the hoppiness this one provides will certainly not let down any hopheads."
"What a beautiful beer. Red/Brown with about 1/4 inch of light tan, frothy, creamy head that lasts to the bottom of the glass and leaves thick rings the whole way down. Smells of hoppy (amarillo?) sweetness, malty and toasty. Very well ballanced bitterness, creamy but not heavy. Slight bitter prick in the aftertaste but overall very clean and drinkable. I'll take 2... or 3."
"D - Easily went through a bomber. Can I have another?"
"The rye character is well represented here, and mixes nicely with the citrus/pine hop profile. I'm a fan of rye beers, and this one seems to be on target. It is bitter to be sure, but nothing overwhelming. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and well carbonated. An easy drinking Rye-PA."
"Wow this was not what I was expecting at all. IT has an intense hops smell that fills your nostrils when This beer is a deep brown with a thick sand/tan head. It has an intense bitter hoppy taste with a sweet finish. The feel is smooth and sudsy feel. Has a pleasant bitter taste very much like Sierra Nevada's ESB. All and all a very drinkable bitter ESB"
"D = Good drinkability. This is a great bitter IPA with a lot of balance in the tastes. Well worth drinking. A nice meaty beer."
"Pours a dark red with amber highlights and thick foamy cream colored head with long lasting retention and great sticky lacing. Smells of spicy hops, fruit, caramel, bread, grapefruit, and pine. Tastes of bitter pine right from the start with a great wave of sweet caramel and a bready backbone. Spices mesh it all together with a citrus and grassy dry finish. Medium in body with lots of carbonation, but perfect for this beer. Semi syrupy and sticky with a great balance of bitter and sweet. One fantasticly hoppy but balanced beer, very refreshing and easy to drink, not just for hopheads."
"I'm utterly amazed. This is basically everything I ever wanted in a beer, I honestly can't even think of anything to compare it to. It's the perfect balance of a full-bodied taste without being even slightly overpowering. It has a beautiful 1/4"" thick creamy head that doesn't go away, which adds to this amazing creamy, malty flavor with every sip. It finishes so smooth, going down nice & easy without any bite to it at all. There's an incredibly pleasant, mildly bitter aftertaste along with that creamyness that's still hanging in there. You'll definitely start feeling it about 2/3 the way through... if it weren't for the impact, I'd easily be putting back several of these in one sitting."
"Had this beer on tap at Father`s Office in Culver City. It pours a reddish gold color with a small white head which sticks around. The nose is very biscuity, spicy, and light hoppiness in the background. The taste is very well balaned with the unique biscuity spicy malt, that I am not use to with this style. This is a light to medium bodied brew and has perfect amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, and paired nicely with a burger."
"D - Goes down easy and extremely enjoyable."
"I am a malt head, but this is a great well balanced hoppy beer. Recommended."
"D: This is a pretty heavy and tasty brew, but one bomber would do it for me."
"This is a good beer that many will like or even love. However, I've had more complex, hoppy brews with a crazy taste or more radical mouthfeel that made the beer in question more drinkable. I'll have it again one day and see where my buds are then."
"Maybe I am getting used to big beers, after tasting many an imperial IPA over the past few years. However, this one stands out. To me it was very aggressive and at times overpowering. Very unique in smell and tatse, aromas of fresh hops and citrus are immediately present. Taste follows the same- very strong- bitter, makes your mouth tingle. I did like it- just I felt I could not drink another one of these- even though I shared this bottle. I was looking foward to the rye, and I think the tang that cane with each sip was different, and probably due to the rye. I would drink this again, and maybe if my expectations were as lofty, I might have rated this higher."
"D: Has a higher alcohol content, the board at the bar was saying 7.7% ABV. Enjoyed this beer a lot but could not have more than 2 at one sitting."
"Also I tend to cook when I drink and often when I cook I just start chopping up ingredients and then figure out what I'm going to make after half way through chopping things up, and I constantly adapt while I cook. I ended up cooking some of mushrooms and onions in this stuff and really enjoyed the hopiness and the sweetness of the malts integrated into the pasta sauce that I made. I will try this again, but without as much hot sauce (I tend to like things really spicy)"
"Pours a bottle brown color, with a very short lasting dark cream head. Smells like devils food donut! Yes, even with the marshmellow rolling with the chocolate. A very subdued grainy side on the back of the nose. Sweet licorice, nuanced oatmeal and the hops really only playing the background in this beer. I really do like it, and a very interesting way of doing this beer. The hops really only play a slight citric role, but completely overshadowed by the intensity of the malts (which are very approachable). The finish of this beer is where the hops shine, and show quite a bit of bitter after you sit for a second!"
"D - Overall, this is a nice and easy drinking beer but not one that really stands out. Has only a small hint of hops really and has the caramel malt, which is not overpowering, but makes the beer sweeter than I expected and wanted it to be. It is good but probably not one that I would reach for again for the reason that there are easier drinking beers and ones that stand out a bit more."
"D: This is an excellent brew. Vibrant, complex and tasty. Very well-made."
"D: The big flavor hid the alcohol just about completely, and at 8%, that's dangerous. I recommend a driver, because you're not going to want to stop at 1 ... or 2."
"Overall, very impressive brew here. I could drink this all day and night. As it warms more complex flavors arise. Cheers to Bear Republic"
"D- I'd like to try it again and see if perhaps a third time is the charm, but I cannot recommend this beer."
"This is currently the only Bear Republic brew my home store carries, and despite my love for Racer 5 and Big Bear, I couldn't be happier. What a great brew. A fairly dark IPA, nice deep amber with plenty of carbonation and a sudsy head. Smell gets your attention. Piney grapefruit hits hard, accompanied bya grainy alcohol edge. Taste is exceptional. The grapefruit and pine aspects overwhelm the palate. A spicy hot aspect is there too. A hint of caramel malt tries to balance this brew out, but fails, this is a hopheads dream. Mouthfeel is great, very enjoyable with the palate demolished by the hops and left refreshed. Each time I've enjoyed this brew it's been a single bomber, and it was justnot enough of this fine IPA."
"D- Even with the uber-intense flavors, its pretty darn drinkable"
"Nicely done."
"A nice Ale in my book. I'll buy this again."
"This is a hop-head's delight for sure!  Plenty of hops in this one!  A nice use of rye gives it a unique character.  One bottle was not enough!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Reasonably drinkable given the ABV. The flavors are well balanced and noting is over powering. I'n not sure about sessionablility, but tis is a very drinkable, yet robust ale."
"I tried this one on tap about a month ago and was blown away. I'm happy to see that the bottle version follows through just as strongly; a truly excellent beer. Nice looking deep brown color with amber highlights and a frothy, massive head that seems to never go away, and when it does leaves excellent lacing. Nose is nice and strong, lots of spicy malt and then piney hops. One very minor complaint is that the nose is not particularly complex. Taste is wonderful, all over the place. In no particular order: piney hops, caramel and then toffee malt, light roasted malt, a touch of citrus, very mild dried fruit. Excellent flavor. Feel is full bodied with perfect carbonation. And my second minor complaint: the ABV is too high to drink to many of these, although that might be good, cause I might be downing these 24/7 otherwise."
"This beer I have always seen on the shelves and never picked it up because to be honest I dont like there advertising departments pictures on the bottles. I am glad I did this beer was nice and hoppy and a little different tasting with the addition of rye, would buy again. Dont judge a beer by its cover!"
"Drinkability - Beautiful combo of hops and malt. Not too much of each, just a great balance. I'm gonna sip on this one as long as I can."
"Mouthfeel is superb for such a strong ale. The alcohol isn't exactly hidden, but it goes down smooth. Very little hop bitterness, but avoids cloying sweetness. Fairly low carbonation, but not at all dull on the tongue. Probably the best utilization of rye that I have tasted."
"What a fantastic beer. $3.99 is cheap for a bomber of pretty much anything decent, and for a beer of this caliber it's pretty much outstanding - I was genuinely surprised at how inexpensive it was. That being said, this beer, more than most others, is not for the faint of heart. Not because it's incredibly alcoholic, or even just incredibly hoppy. But it was really, truly bitter."
"D- I could go for this one again, if the smell was stronger I would appreciate it more, but overall quite enjoyable."
"D: Amazing drinking ipa that was well balanced with a refined dry citrusy/grapefruit and flowery hopping that provided an smooth and even bitterness with a great finish."
"Beware the massive head. Pours a ruby red/brown color with lots of carbonation and good lacing all the way down. Hops and rye dominate the nose. This was only mt second beer and I find that the rye seems to have a dusty/dirty grain smell. Not necessarily a turn off but something I'm not used to. Mouthfeel is slightly silky and light on the tongue. Hops dominate the aftertaste and diminish in less than a minute. The rye smell I described in the nose is not present in the taste. A pretty good beer."
"D - If this was around my area, I'd definitely buy a lot more of this. It's a great brew that I'll most likely trade for/buy again... I'd really love to try this in a fresh keg."
"(original date of review- 3/3/2008)"
"This looks promising...pours a beautiful, dark amber, with a nice head. Smells weaker than I expected, but then i have allergies so I won't hold that against it...all i can detect is that lovely, resiny hops aroma. Taste is incredible. A wonderfully balanced ipa. Pine resin, grapefruit, and a touch of spicey, rye bread. Wonderful! Yum. Perfect mouthfeel - thick, yet carbonated enough to make it exteremely enjoyable to drink. And very drinkable. This is a top shelf IPA. Too bad its just pricey enough to keep it from being a staple item on my refrigerator shelf..."
"Drinkability is moderate. Moderately highly alcohol and bitter notes slow the drinking, but is definitely easy to consume."
"Poured a deep ruby red with a firm creamy whipped tan head. Slight haze with some bubble raising in the middle. Lots of pungant citrusy hops win out over some sweet caramel and spicy rye aroma. Again, the hops are the major player, but the rye character is worthy of your attention. Both together create a wonderfully blend of citrus and spice that would please the most disearning hop head. Body may be a bit thin, but that my make this sort of a refreshing beer."
"D- I could definitely drink these, and a lot of them... quite tasty, and the 8% abv is really well hidden. However, if I was REALLY in the mood for a hop fix, I'd have to look to another brew."
"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass with a big cascading head from a heavy pour. Three finger of rocky off-white head slowly dissipates leaving a good amount of sticky lacing. Gorgeous ruby red color. Intense west coast lemony hop aroma, hint of caramel in the back of the nose. Taste is initially citrusy followed by a slick caramel finish. Well balanced. Medium bodied for great drinkability - I wouldn't guess that this was an 8% beer if I didn't know it - delicious!"
"Thick, complex mouthfeel, a big beer! 8% abv is well hidden, very drinkable, but not too quickly!"
"d - I really like this beer. I only had one pint of it and then moved on, but I look forward to ordering it again in the future."
"A good beer with decent hop character. Good but not great."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Smallish head. Red/brown color. Smells nice and hoppy with notes of pine and citrus, but with a decent malt backbone. Taste is malty, but not in a sweet caramel way, more grain-like. Some nice hop bitterness as well. I think the rye flavor mixes in with the malt and makes it taste pretty interesting. Medium mouthfeel. Not something I would go out of my way to drink, but still good."
"Recommended..."
"D - Very tasty brew. 1 bomber would probably be my limit though as the ABV and powerful flavor would probably be too much to have a few."
"HV"
"D: This one is up there amongst the best... had no problem going for a second serving..."
"Hop Rod is quite drinkable, despite the bitter factor, and is worlds better for the rye - it imbues the beer with life and character and saves it from being another ho-hum American DIPA. Hop Rod Rye has character to spare and is highly recommended. Now that it's landed, every craft beer geek in South Carolina should try this gem."
"it was a decent drink."
"This went well with our pasta and sauce. Then after with two stinky artesian goat cheeses form VT and English wheat biscuits, also paired nicely with an organic sharp cheddar from Nieghborly farm."
"Overall- This beer really impressed me. I would definitely seek it out again and hope I run across it again soon. Thanks to hurleymanvw for sharing this one with me."
"A great IPA, a true must try in my books. The last pour had a little sediment but it was still worth it"
"Absolutely amazing IPA that's verging on the imperial - I could drink it all night."
"all in all - this is one kick ass beer. Bear Republic does not dissapoint. I would have actually like a little bit more of a pronounced hop flavor and aroma."
"Hop Rod Rye poured a slightly cloudy (bonus points for yeast!) orange color with a nice white head with small bubbles. The brew left nice lacing down the glass and the head had serious staying power. The smell was dominated by the abundance of hops in this brew. There was a subtle rye aroma in the back of the nose if you took a deep whiff in the glass. The taste was excellent. There was a distinct hop hit up front but it faded nicely and left no poor aftertaste. The rye was mostly hidden by the hops, however, a bit of a letdown since it is difficult to find a good rye. I did not let this deter me long as this beer was exceptional. The mouthfeel was robust and well rounded but did not make me fool or cringe from the high IBUs. This beer drinks well and is a great accompaniment to a strong flavored dish or as a dessert on its own! Cheers!"
"While the 8% ABV was hardly detectable, the completely unbalanced nature of this beer made it somewhat difficult to drink.This is one brew that should be enjoyed by only the most devoted of hopheads."
"The aftertaste is piney and very strong but this only makes me want to drink more. Thankfully bear republic puts this into a bomber for me to take down. Really a great beer and sets the standard for rye beers."
"Notes-a truly world class brew, looking forward to trying it at home from the bottle if I can get it"
"Drinkability and mouthfeel are great!"
"Served from a bottle, presents a burnt amber color with a huge frothy head that lingers. Great hoppy aroma, quite powerful. Taste is powerful, strong domination by hops without being overkill. A little touch of pine with a dry, clean aftertaste. Quite easy drinking, although perhaps a little strong-willed to be a pure session beer."
"D - I can't figure all these flavors out, but I also can't stop sipping (or gulping). An interesting one of a kind brew."
"A great brew, though not a session brew. A definite must-try."
"Appearance dark amber large tan head excelent lacing. Smell a touch of malt then a heavy dose of pinny hops and a touch of spice. Taste malty sweetness followed by a huge pinny hop bit with plenty of bitterness and then a touch of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel mediem body mediem carbonation. Drinkability I have bought it before I will buy it again."
"Hazy, dark, slightly-ruddy brown, with a medium-sized, foamy, light tan head with excellent retention and lacing. Noticeable sediment in the bottle. First glass was a careful pour, second one let the sediment mix in... affecting the mouthfeel some but that was about it. The aroma is a great balance of roasted malted and piney and citrus hops. The taste is equally as impressive. Some lightly roasted, biscuity malts, and a big, fresh, fruity hops presence. Wonderful finish. Big and hoppy without becoming very cloying at all. It has a medium body, crisp, bitter texture, and soft carbonation. This was a real treat, one definitely worth seeking out."
"Dark brown pour with a good tan head in a trappist glass. Standard fruity belgian yeast smell, but more lightly than most of the style, and mixed with a dark roasty malt like smell and flavor as well. As it warms big notes of licorice come through and stay. Taste was similar to the smell and was perhaps my favorite belgian beer, and I'm not a huge fan of them. I could definitely see this growing on me, and could get this again."
"I must say that the balance between the rye and piney hops in this beer is almost damn near perfect and is what really makes this great. As for drinkability, I was hard pressed to remember that this thing was 8% at the rate that the 22oz bottle disappeared. This is definitely a top rate beer and one you should seek out."
"Pint enjoyed at Redbones in Somerville, MA - along with some good BBQ. Clear brown with outstanding lacing. Very nice, very hoppy aroma. The flavour is all hops. Rye isn't particularly noticeable to my tastes. The hops stay with you long after swallowing. Very enjoyable."
"Very drinkable, an excellent IPA. So glad to have gotten my hands on a couple of 22oz. bombers."
"D- I would love to have this one again and again. Great offering from Bear Republic."
"Nice work Bear Republic."
"Mouthfeel is very good. Full on the palate, with a slickness noted."
"Good mouthfeel, medium body and very fulfilling. Would I drink another...would I? Why not??"
"Drinkability: I would be lying if I didn't say I wouldn't touch this beer again! This is a great beer and I will be buying this one again in the near future. If you like being assaulted by malted rye, then you better pick this one up ASAP."
"Malty, roasty, hoppy aroma. Clear brown with a rocky tan head with a lot of lace. Head lasted for a few minutes before diminishing to a fine layer. Roasty, malty, hoppy bitter flavor with slight alcohol bite. A strongly flavored beer with a lot going on. Bitter, roasty aftertaste. Evervescent and medium bodied with a long, slightly oily finish. Excellent."
"D - Another great offering from Bear Republic."
"This is a slight letdown for me. While it is still a very good beer, I just had higher hopes."
"Overall: Tasty -- I like the stuff, a lot. It's consistently delicious, very drinkable, and is an excellent value for the price."
"D: Probably my favorite IPA, just slightly ahead of Two Hearted and Blind Pig. Big time hop presence but perfect balance from malt and rye and not overly bitter or sweet. Alcohol tends to catch up with me a little more quickly than expected but since it's not really present in the taste I won't hold that against this"
"Went fast, was even better as it sat for a while."
"a good drink, and quite a bit of character for ""just"" an IPA and not a double/imperial."
"not much wrong with this beer, as it is nicely balanced and fairly sessionable, just not my cup of tea when it comes to IPA's i guess... i prefer the Racer 5."
"Smooth, crisp, and creamy. Medium in body. Pretty good drinkability, takes the taste buds on a serious hop ride."
"This is a perfect pour of a 22 oz. into a nice, big mug. Thick (not too thick), uniform head with some stamina. Deep, dark cherry wood color. Mild carbonation. This looks like a perfect power beer. Light rye-bread tones on the nose. Wafting bitterness expected for the style isn't hindered by excess carbonation. Honestly, I expected a little more here but the aroma is pleasant. I really need to let my beers open and breathe and get a little warm prior to pour...almost like you do with wine when talking about something powerful like this. Nice, hearty, bready structure - the rye almost feigns the tingle of carbonation here. Hops take a back seat in the first few sips but come back after about 20 minutes in force. A little earthy taste in the end. Well blended stuff with tangy finish. At first, it feels slightly sour but this evolves over time into more prevalent hop goodness. While it doesn't quite measure up to the look of one of the most eye-catching pours I've seen in a while I could definitely enjoy a few of these. It's hoppy but mild and balanced - tough not to enjoy!"
"M/D: Smooth and creamy medium body. Carbonation is just drink. Pretty good drinkability as well, a very nice IPA."
"This beer is a fine beer to have on hand. Its not too pricey and has a nice taste but it is not on the level of great IPA's. The best part is that you can top of your beer with the little bit left in the bottle."
"Complex and flavorful in drinkability. Not so high in terms of mass consumption, but certainly for overall character and attraction."
"D: A bit more arrogance than with some, but I tend to use that word when describing the body and taste of some of the harder liquors. Perhaps I'm putting too much into the rye elements. Ultimately, though, a good flavour, and a moderately easy drink. Take it easy, and enjoy it."
"Another very fine beer from Bear Republic."
"Very dark amber color - almost brown. Thin off-white head is creamy and attractive, but heads for the door quickly. Aroma of whole leaf hops, juicy dark malts. Dry bitter hop flavor marries well with fruity/ caramel malt taste. Rye is present in vague fruity/ spiciness. Medium body, though fresher versions have been stickier and fuller. Hop bitters on the finish with a little cracker dryness."
"Bear Republic might be one of the most under-rated breweries with the widest range of good beers: Racer 5, Racer X, and Black Bear are all good to amazing beers. Now I can add Hop Rod Rye to the list of greats."
"D:Good. Seems insanely light to me. I expected a lot more. Once the beer gets warm I appreciate it 100 times more."
"D: Kind of intense on both ends of the spectrum so I could not see myself having more than one of these. Great beer though."
"Pours a beautiful dark copper with a fluffy head that never totally disappears. Aroma is Grapefruit, Pine and some sweet and caramel malt in the background. Taste hits with the citrus and pine and lingers long after each sip. There's a bit of bite from the rye somewhere in the middle. Medium body lots of lacing. Nice IPA."
"P.S. It's on tap at the Grey Lodge in Phila, PA"
"D-One of my favs. This is one hell of a beer. I could happily drink this one all night long. The hops and rye combo is spot on...great job BR!"
"D: Drinkable, but there are more drinkable extreme IPAs. I'll recommend this to some of my friends who are more into the overpowering bitterness than I am."
"Smell is subtle of hops and a little piney. Taste is surprisingly more robust than aroma with earthiness of pine and slight citrus notes. Smooth on palate with very few bubbles. Piney hops sort of linger for a few. I like this bitterness, has a really nice feel to it. It is sort of an enigma a little more than most American IPAs, but a little less than the Imperials."
"Its got a very tan, thick (three finger) fluffy/bubbly head that stays around and it has lots of thick lacing all of which covers a dark and slightly hazy reddish/brown body with some medium carbonation. It has the typical IPA aroma that smells spicy and mildly sweet; you can smell some malts and even a little alcohol. Its rolls on smooth and sweet and its very creamy and full bodied; the finish is slightly bitter but it mellows out as it gets warmer."
"Poured into a pint glass while I watched the Pats game. Pours a nice dark amber color with a real full head that leaves tons of lacing. Some piney hops in the aroma, but not too strong. I was expecting more clean, hop bitterness, but I did not get it. Rather smooth, sweet and malty. NOt like a imperial IPA which I was expecting. Great full flavor, though, a nice beer to relax with."
"Drinkability- This is an absolutely wonderful beer. The hop profile in this brew is unlike anything Ive ever tasted. Its perfectly to that point (for me anyway) of hoppiness where its not overpowering but assertive and tasty. This is the 2nd brew with rye in it Ive had in a week or so and something about the addition of it just takes a beer to a whole other level. Great beer that I wish I had access to."
"The aroma was a mix of pine and citrus. Relaxing smell. This one is crisp and clean. A slight bitterness balanced with a slight sweetness. A bit of a hoppy bite at the finish. This is the a refreshing beer and a nice break from the heavy sippers I usually enjoy."
"This beer pours with a big head and a nice amber color. It smells great with lots of hops coming through. It tastes malty first with sweet raisan and alcohal burn. Then the hops hit hard with fresh piney bitterness. Very pleasant. There is a bit of a bitter aftertaste with all that hoppy goodness."
" for an IPA"
"d: I'll certainly buy more of these. While not reflected in the score, it's worth noting that these are a relative bargain at 6 bucks a bomber."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and oily, but not so bad that it truly detracts much from an otherwise amazing beer. For such a strong hoppy beer this is very drinkable. Definately recommended."
"Poured into a Stone Flute with a nice tan head. Gorgeous clear cherry/mahogany with a fairly long lasting blanket of foam. Lacing stayed high on the glass throughout the tasting. Nose hits you long before you pour, and is all the pine and citrusy goodness you would expect. Now prepared for the taste that I have come to love. Immediate blast of Tomahawk/Columbus hops with a nicely balanced maltiness and the harsh reality of a rye finish. This beer is so damn good. It's my current favorite AIPA, and it's always available where I live. I like to take some time between pours of this beer, since it does get in your face a bit. A bomber once a week is good enough for me."
"Poured a beautiful dark copper color with attractive white pillowy head that it retained until the end. Nice hoppy aroma that is both piney and smells of grapefruit rind. This stuff just begs to be drank. Taste is very hoppy with a nice malty balance to it. Lacing on glass is excellent, as is the mouthfeel. This stuff is excellent. I will buy again at every opportunity."
"Pretty good beer. Although not so good that it clearly stands out. I would buy this again, but maybe only if there isn't something new to try."
"I am now searching for this beer on the East Coast. I highly recommend this beer."
"Pours a clear dark amber brown with a sizeable dark crème head. Nose is strong with hops of course. But it is not so much that it is overdone. I say it is well balanced and even. Flavor is rich and smooth. Heavy hop influence with a touch of sweet and basically no alcohol seems to be present. Smooth and even are the key words here. Feel is great. Good carbonation and a thick level of ingredients. Very drinkable. Worth trying and trying again."
"thanks again Vancer!"
"High abv for a single IPA makes this less drinkable than one would expect for the style. The huge bitterness also might turn some people away, but the sweet-to-bitter dynamic kept me coming back for another sip without fail."
"The hops linger so well throughout the finish and beyond that they dominate the texture of the brew. The fact that these huge, boisterous flavors can be balanced so well is a large testament to this beers craftsmanship. Lingering floral hops come through with a clean slick finish. One of the all time best beers I've ever had. An absolute treat to consume and to evaluate. A masterpiece of malty, hoppy deliciousness."
"The taste is very well balanced, lots of bitter grapefruity hops and sweet malt but I cant really find anything rye related oh well. Bear Republic sure know how to brew."
"Dark amber in color, this ale pours with a thin tan head, with lacing that remains throughout the glass. The hops shine through in the aroma and taste. While it's definitely a dry beer, it wasn't as astringent as I would have expected from the rye that was used. It is a beer that I would drink again."
"M/D: Ok so this beer is very enjoyable and not too overpowering, so its an easy drinker. I would imagine one not accustomed to ipa's might not agree. it has a dry bitter aftertaste, but i welcome and expect this"
"Poured a nice copper color with a nice big fluffy head that leaves a lot of lace. Strong aromas of citrus hops with a little bit of malt in the middle. The hops are the prominent flavor of this beer. There really is some malt there waaay in the background. Somewhere. As it warms it turns toasty and bready. Could be a little bit more balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and barely dries out. Nice and bitter and clean. Overall a nice beer. But man alive give me something more than hops, hops, hops."
"This beer poured a clear brown with a big creamy head that lasts throughout the beer. The aroma is malty with very noticeable hops  some fruit notes are present. The taste is BOLD! It is hoppy and bitter with a nice sweet balance. The taste lingers thoughtfully. The mouthfeel is quite full and seems very appropriate. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable brew that Ill be keeping in stock."
"Drinkability: Average. I usually am not a fan of rye beers, but this one does not have such a pronounced rye grainy bitterness."
"Pours Amber with a tawny head. Citrusy American aroma hops are noticeable, but not as tantalizing as I hoped. The hop bitterness is quite strong and dominates the flavor profile. Rye may also contribute to some of the sharpness. The alcohol is big. The high bitterness and the big alcohol are a little much for me - not so drinkable. Soft, silky mouth feel."
"What a crazy beer. 18% Rye? Anyways on to the review.. The beer poured into the glass a copper, golden color with huge fluffy off white head. Fantastic start to a beer! The aroma was hoppy! The hoppiness gave it a nice citrus notes and it also had a hint of sweet maltiness. Just like the aroma the taste was dominated by hops. Citrus notes up front with a nice bitter finish. It also had a slight spice to it which I assume comes from the rye. Overall a great beer but one really needs to be in the hoppy mood for it which thankfully I was!"
"Notes: Overall, quite enjoyable, but more understated than I was expecting"
"A very solid, delicious offering from Bear Republic. It seems like I can get any beer I want here in Pennsylvania, but these guys from California are one of the few that don't distribute here. Here's hoping that changes sooner than later."
"I usually only rate certain stouts this high but this hop/rye bomb is the BOMB!!"
"d: An enjoyable brew, the rye provides an excellent balance to the substantial hop presence. The result is a very tasty IPA. Many rye beers seem to be sort of a gimmick, but this is a very effective use of rye, it really works well as a foil to the hops. My first beer from Bear Republic, won't be my last."
"The aroma is very strong pine like and hop oils. The taste is surprisingly smooth for such a big hop flavor. There is a sweet fruit flavor that accompanies the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is fairly light too. This one is good but it is lopsided to the hopside. Nothing wrong with that though."
"The flavor was full bodied and well balanced. In the mouth is was chewy but is was thin. It had a lot of carbonation which worked for me. It was a great American IPA."
"The drinkability is good, one of the best of the style. Prosit MK"
"D: The rye gives it a somewhat unique flavor among IPAs, and it'd be a good beer without the rye too. It's good. For me, it's not great. I'm not really sure what else to say. Very solid offering."
"D: I LOVE this beer, always come back to it. Though it might not be the best IPA out there I will always reach for this one when I see it, YUM."
"A deep brown tea colored brew with a big off-white head and sturdy lacing. The aroma is of mellow pine hops with some sweet apple cider in a malt background. The flavor is a bit unique with a combination of bitter, earthy hops and sweet licorice malt. A bready base in a very full bodied and evenly carbonated ale. Not a typical IPA but quite good, not quite as much of that rye quality as I was hoping for, but an excellent ale just the same. Fairly drinkable for an 8% beauty, alcohol is not dominant here I don't think. Very much recommended."
"D - Another great product from Bear Republic. I got to get up there sometime."
" D- For 8% the abv is masked well although it is right there. Good drinkability , although not very sessionable."
"D: Goes down easy and invites for more. The bomber will be finished easily and I'll buy more in the future."
"Comments: I've never used rye in any of my homebrew recipes, but might have to reconsider after trying this beer. Well done, BR."
"I will certainly make a special trip for some more of these. Kudos to Bear Republic."
"I had this beer at Bukowski's Bar in Boston. This was a great quality sipping beer. I wouldn't want to make this my session beer. This is the type of beer you have one or two of them in a sitting. I wouldn't give this to someone who is a novice beer drinker."
"A fantastic IPA experience. Pours a deep clear mahogany color with a huge off white head. Sheets of lacing left on the glass. Good strong and pleasant hops smell but it can't do justice to the taste experience. The taste begins with crisp, sharp hops. Bitter but pleasant and rich tasting, more pine than citrus. As the beer warms up, the hops do not give way, but there is a strong caramel malt taste as an undercurrent. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, not as oily / resinous as Celebration Ale...more crisp. Drinkability is very good, too high an abv for a session beer, but I was left wanting more after draining a 22 oz'er. Will definitely seek this one out again!!!"
"A very good IPA for hopheads with a craving for something to go along with the hop."
"Pours a deep reddish-amber color with a thick and rocky light tan head that has good staying power. Patchy lacing. Big piney hops aroma that has a good citrus and malt presence as well. Rich body with a dry, hoppy character. Notes of citrusy grapefruit, pine and a solid caramel malt base. Alcohol is well-hidden but definitely there. The finish is dry and hoppy, and only here does the rye flavor show up with any force. Overall a good beer, although I would have liked to see the rye show up a bit more."
"update 05/2014 actually not a bad rye beer, feels more like a strong ale than an IPA though."
"Picked this 22oz'er up at the local liqour store. I am a big fan of BR's Racer 5 so thought I'd give this one a try. According to the bottle ""made with 18% rye"". Pours a beautiful burgandy brown with a considerable fluffy head. Pungent floral hops abound along with a good deal of pine and just a tad of citrus. A hop explosion in the taste. Floral and citrus-y hops mainly with lots of caramel sweetness. But make no mistake, this is a hop loaded brew. The alcohol doesn't make itself known in the taste even at 8%. Thick lacing as I make my way down. Thick creamy mouthfeel. A powerful beer though not overpowering in any way. Another gem from Bear Republic, well done!"
"Pours a deep copper color, thin off-white head settles very quickly. Smell is HUGE! Lots of citrusy hops, and the rye shows up well, smell is remeniscent of a fresh baked loaf of dark rye. Taste is less hoppy than i expected from the aroma. The rye shows up very nicely. and a bit of citrusy hop flavor comes thru shortly thereafter. Mouthfeel is very smooth, some resiny texture towards the finish, nice and moist. Drinkability is quite good. Would pair well with some corned beef, maybe even a reuben on rye bread. Well done."
"Overall, an interesting beer that is quite drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very nice IPA. Sweet and hoppy is a good combination for me. The ABV is reasonable, and this is not overpowering, so this is quite drinkable. I would have liked more spicyness, but good regardless."
"(Hopefully I can find this in San Diego)"
"Cheers!"
"D - highly drinkable, so watch out for the abv, it's in there."
"This is the one beer that left a lasting impression on me after leaving the Brew HaHa festival in Cincinnati. This brew will jump up and slap you like Ike Turner on a REALLY bad night. It has a deep color and great aroma. It is about like drinking rope. Hard to choke back but well worth the price of admission. Hop heads should give this one a thorough tasting. This will certainly put some pep in your step!"
"Pours a deep red with a lovely 2 fingers of almond-colored head. Simply gorgeous. Aroma of caramel & hops. Creamy mouthfeel, hops on the nose. Middle taste is very clean, ending with a dry hoppy taste. Excellent balance for a 8%er and alcohol very well hidden! I wish I had more of these."
"Drinkability: Heck yeah.... bring 'em on.... highly recommended."
"The taste was not as inviting as the aroma. A little weak on the flavor. All I could taste was hops and that was about it. Not what I expected from past ale's from this brewery! Not bad, just a little above average at best."
"Overall this is one impressive beer. The rye helps give this beer a defining edge over other DIPA's. Is it balanced? Screw balance. This beer is a hopheads dream come true. Yet another wonderful brew from the folks at Bear Republic."
"If I could get my hands on this beer regularly I would be such a happy man. Just got a Racer 5 in another trade can't wait to try that one."
"Great beer good times. If I were to get a tatoo and become a hipster, this logo would be the one to get, or anchor porter. Creamy head. Hoppy alcoholy taste, makes me want to worship at the house of the wild turkey. Big Taste, dry, sweet, bitter, ecumenical. The holy holy of rye beers. Drink this one day after day like you would want it to do unto others."
" The 8.0% ABV is just right, and I easily downed the whole bottle without feeling too rushed or too drunk from the alcohol. I haven't had a lot of beers with rye as a main taste factor, but I'm certainly glad that I got my hands on this one. It's full-flavored, full-tasting, and full of craft brewing enjoyment. Seeing an IPA that is just a bit more subdued is a welcome change for me, and will probably be for anyone else looking for a variation on this style. Well worth seeking out!"
"Drinkability: Audacious flavor, yet not overdone. Well-rounded brew with fine attributes for all the senses."
"Drinkability: Great Rye! A tremendous example of the this style. Can easily become a standard beer for some folks."
"This beer clings to the mouth well and I could drink it all day long. Definitely give this beer a try."
"D: Aside from the 8.0% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. Quite enjoyable and a nice take on the standard IPA."
"Felt a little thin on the palate, but the drinkability was pretty good. Not a session beer though."
"D - The rye adds a nice touch and along with the hops make this one pretty bold in the flavor."
"I like Rye beers and I love IPA's. But another bottle I will not buy"
"Pretty much one of my favoritous beers ever. It's rich and complex without being a trainwreck."
"dark dark amber. big big head with great retention and beautiful lace. piney to grapefruity smell with an unusual smell in the background that i believe is the rye. interesting and unusual. taste is perfectly balanced. hops dominate but share the spotlight with that rye wheat and healthy malt. great smooth creamy mouthfeel with minimal bitterness and dryness for such a big abv beer. i would drink this one everyday with almost anything that is on my normal diet. spicy food and cheese. and ice cream."
"I was stunned to see this had only 8% alcohol, as it drinks like a beer with half that ABV. Definitely worth picking up."
"This is one of those beers that makes it well known that America has a real handle on the craft beer trade."
"Would definitely have again in the future"
"Bear Republic is 2 for 2 in my book. I'll need to search for other offerings"
"A strong pour gets a 4 finger tan head withe crater like like bubbles that resemble the effect you get when you add coke to ice cream. Leaves similar lace as well. Brown body and hints of ruby red throughout. Another addition to the super fragrent hop monster beers. Sweet citrus fruity hops really shine on the aroma with a warning to the bitter. My mouth is watering already. Rye and bitter hoppy feel battle as they hit the tongue. Mineral bitter is long and persistant throughout the palate. This is a good beer but not as good as the nose and visual would have lead me to believe. Mouthfeel stays in line with this sharp bitter. Drinkable if you like true bitter bite."
"22oz bomber bottle states 8%abv. Medium brown color. Fluffy sticky head of foam. Little carbonation activity in a still glass, but swirling produces many tiny bubbles that ascend in streams from the side and bottom of the glass. Aromas of pungent rye spiciness and malt sweetness. The hop aroma is on a level with the rye spice and seems hidden but reveals itself with a mild raw cone smell. Taste is explosive. I love rye beer and this is a tasty one. There is a hazelnut nuttiness that's pretty subtle. The malt is not hidden and is the beer's source of sweetness. Bitter and dry-hopped flavors are of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is very smooth to creamy. With so many positive flavors and textures the result is a complex and delicious brew. Everything just comes together for a solid aroma/flavor profile. Bear Republic is above average and consistent with it's quality. Decant this beer to keep the yeast sediment in the bottle."
"Part of a nice haul my mother-in-law brought back from a recent visit home to San Francisco. Poured much darker than I expected for an IPA. A nice dark reddish bronze colour. Lovely craggy foamy head. Huge floral hops in the nose. While malt is present, this is definitely more hops than malt. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and the 8%abv is well concealed. This is a very nice, very drinkable IPA."
"This one is worth searching out. Sucks to be you if you havent had it. My life hasnt been the same since they started selling it here in Texas a few weeks ago. I know on this website HRR is rated higher than the Stone IPA, but I have some arguments with that. It is almost as good as the Stone IPAAlmost I guess the Stone just has a special place in my heart."
"This all leads to a long full, bittersweet finish, and although the 8% alcohol was well hidden in the nose and aroma, it made its presence known by the end of the beer. All and all, a very good ber, and I wish we could find Bear Republic in ATL."
"Drinkability: Very nice, although the alcohol will slow you down at some point. This is one worth seeking out, but is not as preferable to me as a Double Simcoe or Hop Slam. However, these bottles are a steal for what they are priced at, so buy a few whenever you see them."
"I can very easily see why this is a staple in most fridges!"
"IPA? If thats the case then this is one of a kind. Pours a dark brown with sediment everywhere, good head that dissapates slowly and when I finished the beer, there was still a coat of lacing covering the entire pint glass. Smells of hops, citrus, fig, rind, malt. Tastes as it smells and finishes with big bitter hops. Full in the mouth with great carbonation. Drinkability is good but more than a bomber or two could lead to choking down a delicious craft brew. A must try."
"After trying this with a friend at the Flying Saucer and really enjoying it, I decided to buy a bottle and review it. Poured into a pint glass from a bomber. The beer pours a deep amber/brown, forming a thick creamy 1 inch head that slowly fades. Medium spots of lace stick to the glass. The aroma is very strong hops, along with a light smell of sweet malt and caramel. The flavor is absolutely wonderful! A good balance of the hops and malts. Citrusy hops dominate the front, followed closely by the malt, and finishing with a sweet caramel flavor. Very complex and full. Medium mouthfeel. Extreme flavor and higher than usual abv. keep this from being an all-night drinker, but still exceptionally drinkable for an IPA. Overall, I was very impressed with this ale. This is among the better IPAs that I've tried. I would highly recommend this!"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a red/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. The aroma is citrusy and pine hops, along with some malt and spice. Taste is hoppy (pine and grapefruit), with peppery spice, caramel, and grain/bread. There's a good mix between the mild malty sweetness and the hoppy bitterness, it's well balanced. The rye is a nice addition to this brew. Mouthfeel is medium, slick, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good too, the alcohol is well hidden and it's good and tasty. I think this is a pretty good beer overall. I haven't tried too many of Bear Republic's beers, but the ones I've tried have all been quality."
"Mouthfeel is alive with rye and carbonation. It is a little stingy but this helps accentuate much of the flavor profile (specifically hops, rye, esters) and does much to add drinkability to what would be an otherwise oppressive full body. As beer warms and carbonation dissapates it actually gets nice and creamy. Man this beer is a journey."
"Good A IPA from Bear republic- nice color, light amber on the pour with some lacey head. Aromas were good as well, not too overpowering and the hops really come through the othe scents present. Taste was somewhat harsh- mouth puckering hops hid most of the malt counterbalance and an odd citric aftertaste dominated the finish. I was dissapointed that there was not more rye flavor present, the idea of a combination of the hops and rye was exciting to me, especially in an american IPA. I really dont understand the hype- its a decent beer but BR has made much bigger and better than this one."
"I should point out that I had this on tap recently and that would have received higher ratings than the bottled version."
"Great beer."
"Top-notch IPA."
"Thanks to Premier Group in Buffalo, NY for supplying the 22 oz. bomber."
"D- Awesome. At 8% this goes down like water. The hops are not harsh, its very smooth, and the alcohol is not noticeable at all. Dare I say a sessionable 8% IPA?"
"Overall, not what I was expecting at all. Given the title and the abv, I was looking for a balls-to-the-wall double IPA. What I got was one of the cleanest, most well balanced, and most easy to drink IPAs I've ever had. Highly, highly, recommended."
"Big yet relatively well-balanced IPA. The malt combined with a spicy undertone with the big citrus and slightly juicy hops that showed off a bit of orange rind at the end. While this had a big and tasty hops flavor, the aroma was a little weak and the taste wasn't that complex. It was a great beer, but nothing life changing."
"I wouldn't call it a refresher for a hot day, but a great one to sit down and sip during a long conversation. If this was on tap, I doubt I'd go for anything else."
"Taste is Piney bitter with a bit of citrus rind. Peppery with a hint of caraway and even a little plum fruitiness. Some alcohol and a hint of vanilla. very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth but dries nicely and gets sticky in the finish. Very full bodied. Drinkability was hampered a bit by all the alcohol, but it's lovely and bitter and I'm savoring every sip."
"Overall this beer masks the high ABV very well. A very unique beer that I'll try again."
"A wonderful drinker. Produce and Distribute widely as a gateway beverage' for the AB masses longing for a true experience. Attention: this Specialty Ale should be considered fully, though it represents a corner condition as an American IPA , it completely deserves its spot in the Best of BA chart."
" Overall I really do not know what elseI can say. I loved every second of this beer. Really just fantastic, and worthy of my 400th review, or my 1000th!!"
"Mouthfeel- Whoa! this is one aggressive brew. The hops are well layered and the malt body is not too sweet.The Rye really gives an excellent edge, almost a bite on the finish. Alcohol is noticeable and with the Rye gives the brew a kick that says: Hey I am dropping high octane and hops all over your palate jack! Almost a solid 4, and I like Rye grain, but being truly quaffable is slightly diminished by the hearty edge of this one. Everything I have tried from BR has been choice!"
"[ serving type: on-tap"
"p.s. i read somewhere that the 22 oz bottles are good cuz you can share with a friend. i dont have any friends and its a good thing too, cuz i aint sharin beer this good with anyone. get your own!"
"Overall, an incredible beer! Great balance with a great flavor. Quite a unique beer that is a nice mixture of a rye and i think a 2ipa."
"Pours a beautiful ruby red wit a huge three finger khaki colored head that takes forever to die down. Stickiness is all over the place, love the way this brew looks. Smell is a wonderful sweet pine aroma with a grassy/rye aroma that tingles the nose. Such a clean smelling brew. Wow, taste is unreal. Very mild pine/citrus hops, but definitely there balanced perfectly with rye and caramel malt flavors. So incredibly smooth going down. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with fair carbonation. Balance is amazing in this brew, I can't believe it took me this long to try this one. I'll definitely be going back for more of this. Pick this one up for sure the next time you see it."
"D- Very drinkable. The massive amount of hops and bitterness makes it one to sip of but I can drink this all night long."
"This is worth trying, a refreshing diversion from trying to find the perfect whatever (e.g., double IPA, double stout, Russian imperial stout). Bitter but not overhopped. Dark, beautiful color. Strong, but not too thick. I'll be getting more of this."
"D: A little lower due to the robustness and high alcohol, but very tasty and a very nice beer to drink that revels in its own complexities but does not go over the top; not to mention that it is virtually ubiquitous in my area, and is relatively cheap, hovering around $3.29-$3.49 for a bomber."
"d- its a really good beer, the rye threw me off from what i was expecting it was good, just different, havent had a beer with rye in it."
"This is a very drinkable beer, I got mine in a 22oz and I am thinking about going to the store to get a second!"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer, however I started to get a little worn out by it towards the end."
"Pours a really awesome dark ruby with a massive ivory head and great looking carbonation. Aroma is exceptionally pleasing citrus hops that makes your mouth water. Taste is very bitter rye with little sweetness or citric tones I had anticipated from the aroma. Very disappointed that the bitterness was so out of balance. Very little flavor could be picked up over the bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice. Drinkability hurt by bitterness."
"Note: have had this since many times including 12oz versions...there may be some freshness issues...have not been as impressed overall."
"Good body and carbonation. Well balanced. The rye addds a very unique character. Very nice."
"Poured a dark reddish-orange out of the 22oz bottle. great 2 finger, off white head that lasted a few minutes, with pretty good lacing. Good resiny, fruity hop aromas make you eager to taste this beer. For a strong IPA, it was really well-balanced. Sweet, caramelly malts fight to stave off a strong hop bite. Oily textured, but smooth and eas to drink for a beer this strong and this hopped up. Really nice."
"What a great IPA this is. Drink one if you can,"
"I could definitely knock back a few of these. I drank 1 pint 6 fluid oz. a lot faster than I thought I would and it's only eleven in the morning! Note: I have been eating pizza as well (which is somewhat of a common compliment to IPAs) so its slightly possible that it is throwing off my review, but I doubt it. I will definitely purchase this beer again when I am search of something with an extremely high hop and alcohol content."
"Pours a nice deep amber and a tan head. The aroma is HOPS. You can tell its comming. It has a fantastic taste. Grapefruity hops balanced out with the sweet malt and dryness of the rye. It leave a stickiness on the lips, but it is well worth it. One of the best beers by far."
"I was wondering what the difference between the two Bear Republic IPA's would be, and this I would label the ""different"" one with its rye shot. The other offering I will try soon to compare notes. (Update: Racer 5 is tastier, but Hop Rod Rye is more quaffable.)"
"Drinkability is great. The powerhouse of flavors matched with their awesome presentation make this easy to enjoy in large quantities."
"Pours out a rusty hazelnut with plenty of carbonation present in the body. Head is thick, creamy, and beige, and holds up extremely well. There are some dimples atop the foam and with each sip there is left some lacing that reminds me of the residue left by the steamed milk on a cappuccino. The aroma is of citrus, vanilla custard, toffee, caramel, cane syrup, and a little hint of rye. Alcohol merely peaks out from this, but is well subdued considering the strength. In the flavor, malts start off sweet, bready and with dried fruits and caramel. The hops start to push into the middle then come into the forefront by the finish. Flavor is mostly citric but there are undertones of pine, earth, and strong herbs such as rosemary. A very understated rye makes itself known amongst the hops, which I think works well, but I would rather the rye to be a little more present. The bitterness does not overstep the sweet malts in the end, rather they create a balance. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, moderate to full, and the carbonation is extremely mellow. It's rare to find a beer of this strength as being this drinkable, but you don't notice it while you drink. Amazing beer."
"The West Coast breweries are top notch at the moment and this may be the best offering I have had to date."
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable IPA. The alcohol is hidden very well. Definitely one of the best IPA's I have tasted in awhile."
"Kind of thick and creamy. Leaves a bitter coating. So so bitter. Substantial. Might as well be an Imperial. It's like a hoppy strong ale."
"Pours with massive mountains of head that has peaks and valleys. Copper red color, slightly translucent at the bottom, thicker in the middle. Extremely hoppy with a desirable bitterness. more on the floral side, as opposed to the pine flavor. Still has a nice mix of both. Very intense, perhaps too much if your not into IPAs, but perfect for those who are."
"D - Very good IPA with almost no alcohol detectable. Taste is very solid, not outstandingly complex but also not just a hop bomb. Also, this beer has an excellent value. There is nothing not to like."
"Amazingly drinkable brew. It packs a bunch with 8% ABV but it's pretty well hidden. This is surely a beer I'd want to drink throughout the summer."
"Really nice beer, easy to drink on a cool spring night. This would go well with many heavily spiced foods as it stands up on its own."
"Poured a ruby amberish color, quite dark for an IPA but still beautiful. Nice creamy head and excellent lacing and carbonation. Smell is great as well, juicy grapefruit hops and sweetness. This is definitely one of my favorite tasting IPAs hands down. I can't tell that rye has been used but for damn sure know that this is for the hopheads. Citrus, fruity hops and a malty balance that makes this one mouth watering. Not quite thirst quenching but for sure mouth watering on the tongue. Silky smooth and just utterly great. Very drinkable beer here, although I do like the more standard IPAs as well. Bear Republic has to be one of my favorite breweries. Yummy."
"This is very drinkable. The warmer it gets, the better, but who has the patience to let it sit around. Grab one and throw it back!"
"Drink - I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of this drink, and would have another one soon if I bought two ;("
"The alcohol is hidden very well and could relax with a couple of these bombers to kick off the night."
"On the palate is a medium to full bodied ale with generous malt, rye spice without any bad bite, and a nice tart citrusy hop note that rounds it out oh so well. This is a full flavored beer for sure, but they found a way to keep things in harmony. Amazing!"
"I don't really consider this beer to be an IPA of any kind. There are a lot of flavors going on here that would be better suited if it were placed in the American Strong Ale style. That said, this is an interesting beer that will surely appeal to IPA enthusiasts."
"Was in Columbus yesterday and my wife and I stop at Barley's. On tap was 8 brews and Hop Rod Rye. For some time now I've been craving this brew and their it was on tap. The appearance was a dark amber with a slight ruby shine, also held a beige two finger head. Left an excellent amount of sticky and salty lacing (lip smacking). Darkest AIPA I've seen to date. The smell was phemon. A blast of grapefruit citrus upfront with a some piney in the middle. Also experienced a hint of caramel, nutty malt and toffee. The taste began slightly sweet plum that was well balanced with the hoppy blast toward the end. Somewhere in the middle this southern biscuit shine through. This brew felt middle to full, bold, slightly oily and crisp with a dry ending. The only down fall was, with a long drive ahead of us, we could only have one drink. If not I drink this beauty all night. Great brew. Enjoy"
"Overall, a fine IIPA. At 8% a bomber is enough for one sitting."
"One of the strangest IPAs I've ever had. It's just ending slick and bitter. Seems like, based on the look, scent and reputation of this brew, there should be more here. Maybe I'm off tonight or maybe this is a bad bottle. Maybe I just don't like it. Not sure what else to tell ya."
"This beer pours a deep red color with flecks of what the bottle says are hops. It looks like dead yeast to me. The body is fairly cloudy. There was an exceptionally fluffy white head. There is a lot of rye and hops in the aroma. It has a good malt profile as a backbone though. The flavor is very complex. Initially there is a good sweet maltiness followed by a equal amount of hop bitterness over the sweetness. It finishes very balanced, maybe even a bit on the sweet side. This is a good IPA, although there is something about it I'm not crazy about. It might be a bit sweet for me. It is good though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Extremely smooth. Carbonation and abv are ideal. Very, very drinkable. Overall, this really is a fantastic beer. It's my first experience with Bear Republic and I walk away looking forward to the next. Definitely recommended."
"This beer is one of my favorites. The taste is different than your typical IPA (in a good way)."
"And then, taste. Utterly fantastic. And the wonderful thing is it changes slightly as it warms, giving it even more dynamics. The hops are definitely the star of the show, dominant but not overbearing, a biscutty, caramel malt doing it job balancing thing out and the mouth only magnifies the beauty, its velvety smoothness, well tempered carbonation, and coating, full body making this a fantastic beer to drink. In other words, I continue to be impressed with the beers Bear Republic puts out, and would dare to say they are massively underrated, or at least much under-hyped. I'll have to find some more of this one, and soon."
"D- Very drinkable, but I also felt this beer, so I don't know if I could take more than one in a sitting."
"D- At 8% ABV, I wouldn't have many of these, but they are nice."
"D: Incredible! Could drink this one all afternoon."
"Notes: Not sure if this is best described as an IPA or a DIPA as some have suggested. Whatever you call it, I like it. The addition of the rye tweaks it just enough to make it interesting and unique. A very good beer to have to ""mix things up"" a little bit. Definitely recommended."
"This beer poured a sparkling ruby red with billowy head formation. Aroma is a very light and pleasant sweet hop goodness. Mouthfeel is very effervescent, and that's the first thing I noticed when I took a sip. Flavor is bitter and sweet, but exceedingly pleasant."
"Drinkability is quite high for the ABV. I liked most everything about this beer, and even in the taste I generally liked all the parts...I just didn't particularly care for how they came together. Because taste is such a big part of the rating my score will be lower than I'd expect, but I'll drink this again. It probably deserves a shot for a higher score anyway."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a deep copper amber color that was slightly hazy. About an inch of tight, bubbly off-white head formed. Head dissapeared somewhat quickly into small gobs of lace in the glass. Smell: Not exactly what I expected from a west coast I.P.A, but smelled great. Aromas of hops, lots of resiny pine, notes of citrus fruits, and plenty of malt. Lots of flavor as well. Hops that are not overwhelming, on a smooth malty backbone. Also hints of citrus, pine, bready yeast, and a nice touch of rye. Somewhat dry but almost perfectly balanced. A very enjoyable drink. Nice medium bodied, crisp, clean feel in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation. Very drinkable. A great offering from bear republic."
"I absolutely love rye, but I can't detect it directly in this beer. Regardless, it's a uniquely great IPA."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink, not quite to the level of a prototypical IPA, more like a red/amber with a decent hoppy rye presence, very smooth and nicely balanced"
"Marks down for a non-traditional hue and a subdued hop aroma in the nose. Marks up for balance, mouthfeel, flavor, and drinkability. Great ale."
"T-Simply put this is a great beer that tastes smooth and goes down easy. Enjoy."
"Liked this beer alot and plan to have it in my rotation."
"Creamy, satisfying texture makes for a complex, pleasant experience throughout. Still, for a rye beer I still think I'd give the nod to 2 Bros. Cane and Ebel over this (by a hair)."
"D: One of the best beers that I've ever had. I love IPA's and this might be my favorite. I will come back to this beer again and again."
"Drinkability is good. A nice, pleasant, kind of different IPA."
"Drinkability is very good , very enjoyable more then an IPA, wishing I had a frig full of these. Thanks go to Enola for this fine sample."
"An excellent beer! I prefer more hops, but this is incredibly well balanced. Rye adds a nice little extra. Sessionable, but ABV would get you."
"D - I've had so many IPA's in the past few weeks, I was almost hesitant to drink this. This is exactly the opposite of what I expected because it seems different from an IPA. It seems like a really good amber with more of a hop presence. The malt is the best part, which makes the drinkability high and enjoyable. The hops come out in the finish to show you it really is an IPA. I love this stuff."
"Drinkability: A lot of sweetness for an IPA, but a lot of hops to balance it out. This beer is rather complex for the style, and very well done. Tasty IPA that offers more than most."
"D - Excellent IPA - definitely one of the most unique. Between this and the Racer 5, I'm definitely putting Bear Republic on the top of my list."
"I enjoyed this one, it was a lot more hoppy than I expected. The rye malt taste is subtle. I think I would enjoy a bit more of the malt kick in this beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy with no hint of the ABV, despite the description on the label (alcohol burnin monster ale), very good representation of style. I took out the bomber rather quickly. I was a little hesitant because Ive have both good and bad experiences with beer that have the word rye in their names. This beer was certainly a good experience."
"This beer is fairly drinkable, but not over the top enjoyable. Good but not great."
"Very rich, but very drinkable. Wish I had another bomber."
"this beer goes down in the books as a new favorite!"
"Drinkability: Extremely enjoyable, and one of the finest IPA's or rye-based beers in existence. An archetype for the style."
"drinkability is great. the alcohol is mostly balanced, but it's very smooth and drinkable."
"It's tough for such a bold brew to be drinkable, but the brewers did a creditable job. Aside from a slight acidity on the roof of my mouth, I had few complaints."
"Poured out a golden honey brown with a big thick, luscious tan head that ripples with sticky lacing. The nose is first fruity and alcohol, with good malt and yeast tones, supported by wafts of grapefruit, and a slightly medicinal, mineral, bloody, metallic aspect. The taste starts was bitter, hot with alcohol, lingering, oily hops, grapefruit, some candy notes, even a little melon. Good mouthfeel, a bit creamy but also crisp. The resiny oil and lingering bitterness make this a bit of a chore for me after the first few sips hurting its drinkability."
"D: Not your ordinary IPA. Still refreshing and clean like most IPA's but the rye malts add a completely different element. Refreshing and very drinkable."
"A good beer from Bear Republic that I picked up over in Wisconsin. Very balanced and not very bitter but still quite tasty. This or the Racer 5 are my favorite Bear Republic beers that I've had so far."
"This is a superb beer, well balanced between the hops, and malt. The balance of rye to barley malt is also fantastic, with nothing taking over the show. I'll certainly be drinking this one again."
"You know, Ive been drinking craft beer for a over three years now, and have been a beer advocate for almost that long, and yet I still end up passing over these beers time and time again. Even though Ive known about them for a long time and even though everyone raves about them, I still take my sweet time in getting around to trying them, at which point I truly regret not trying much, much sooner. Hop Rod Rye is one of those beers; its supremely flavorful with awesome hop flavor and a solid malt backbone, and all of this blends beautifully into one drinkable beer. Highly, highly recommended."
"A near perfect beer. Deep musky amber color, head absolutely will not go away. Not a brilliant nose, but very pleasant notes of citrus, and lush malt. The taste is beyond exceptional, and smooth almost beyond comprehension for an IPA. Delicious malt, perfectly balanced by the hops. The rye makes itself known at the end. The mouthfeel is luxurious, and it's an absolute pleasure to drink. I'll be sampling the rest of BR's offerings very soon, as this was incredible."
"A big beer that didn't let me down. I get consistent, excellent quality from every bottle from this brewery. Bear Republic really knows how to balance major malt bills with massive hopping. Delicious."
"Overall, a nice IPA. It's definitely a hop monster, and the rye adds a nice touch. The caramel and fruits lend an almost barley wine touch to it."
"Special props out to Zrrbrrt for being a great Secret Santa 2006."
"Damn, this stuff is good...but it's so intense that probably not as sessionable as the Racer 5."
"22 oz bottle. Pours are very rich amber with a nice big tan head that lasted a long time and left great lacking. About as beautiful as you can get. Hops smack you in nose. Hint of fruit. Rye subtle. What a nose! I love it. What sets this apart is great balance. I am an IPA fan, and this ranks with the very best. I would put it on a par with Arrogant Bastard amd Moylans Hopsicle. And it is close enough to me in Northern California that I can almost claim it as a ""local beer. This is a real winner."
"22oz. Bomber lets forth a fffft! and a pillowy head immediately acsends from the bottle as I quickly get it to the glass. The tan head continued to be thick and sticky throughout. The brew itself is in the middle ground where brown meets red meets gold meets mahogany. Just a beautiful looking beer. The aroma is spicy and piney/floral with a bit of malty sweetness and rye poking through. The initial flavour is of malt and rye, if only for about .05 seconds, before the hop onslaught displays the back of its hand and gives me a proper pimp-slap. That lasts for a good long while until the malt backbone of this beer regains its footing and melds with the hops for a nice complex finish. Green piney hops with floral notes, toffeeish and rye malt, bread-yeast, bitter orange rind, almond-hazelnut, and a smidge of bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel here is very creamy and slightly slick, I almost imagine hop oils rolling over my tongue. Fantastic really. Top notch drinking."
"D: Strong hoppy IPA. High hopiness and low bitterness/no astringency make this a very drinkable beer."
"drink this one slightly warmer than a typical IPA, the rye comes through better"
"Pours a bright orange topped by a huge, fluffy, creay off-white head that leaves marshmallow pillows of lace all over the glass, and peaks and valleys remaining afloat long after the pour. Aroma of piney hops reaches out and grabs the olfactory senses, leaving room for little else to be considered. Palate is more balanced - lots of piney hops up front, tempered by a blend of sweet caramel malt and rye after it sits on the tongue for a second. Finish is both sweet and dry - a product of the rye, I suppose. Body is rather creamy, a nice and rare character for an IPA. Very drinkable, and not much betrays the fact that this clocks in at 8%. Why don't I drink this more often?"
"This beer had a Brown/deep copper color with a thin off white head. The smell had some pine, a little earthy note and some woodiness. The taste is very good not overly bitter and the sweetness of the rye really comes through to support the bitterness. A very malty IPA, it could stand to take some more bitterness because of the strong malt. Nice medium mouthfeel, very drinkable and tasty."
"Hop Rod Rye pours a beautiful ruby red with a thick sticky off white head. Smell is sweet caramel malt and a nice bitter hops as well. It has nice aromas of grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a great balance of sweet raisiny malts and bitter citrusy hops. I think if this beer was a little big stronger, it would classify as an American Barleywine. It seems to me thats the closest style it comes to."
"Drinkability: This is endlessly savorable, easy to drink despite its mass of alcohol and hops."
"I find myself really loving this style. I really wish that rye was a more popular style. I tried this at the Oregon Beer Fest this summer, wrote a review in the forum, but forgot to post it on the beer. Great rye fragrance. Since trying this beer I have found myself buying more rye bread for sandwiches as I have discovered I really enjoy it. Nice head with what appears to be some quality lacing (the plastic tasting cups aren't the preferred test for this). Wonderful flavor, it was a welcome change from the DIPAs I was hitting hard that day."
"Mouthfeel- The palate is definetly bitter. A little thicka dn heavy on the tongue for an IPA, but thats just fine by me."
"D - A very different take on the IPA that deserves to be experienced at least once. The rye creates an intriguing flavor, but not one that I would desire everyday. 8%ABV takes its toll after an entire bomber."
"Rye beers with lots of hops are becoming more common, and it's a match made in heaven. This is a great IPA, and it's also a clever twist on the style. Recommended."
"Tastemmmm. This beer has it all. Loads of hoppy greatness, spiciness from the rye, malt backbone and alcohol to balance it all out. This is the beer that started me down the path of rye. Now I've had a collection of rye beers, homebrewed many rye beers, and even have a bottle of rye whiskey laying around. It will change how you look at beers. Bravo to Bear Republic. I love living in California."
"Enormous hoppiness, very intense. Yet so well-balanced that it's a great pleasure to drink. A splendid beer."
"D- great looking, great mouthfeel, great flavor, must try brew regardless of your prefrence. great balance. This beer has totally rocked my socks"
"Really drinkable, a wish I had more than this one bomber"
"Full bodied, a tad overcarbonated, but not bad. Relatively complex, a very flavorful and refreshing brew. Extremely drinkable."
"Pours a deep ruby red with a firm creamy whipped tan head. Slight haze with some bubble raising in the middle. Lots of pungant citrusy hops win out over some sweet caramel and spicy rye aroma. Again, the hops are the major player, but the rye character is worthy of your attention. Both together create a wonderfully blend of citrus and spice that would please the most disearning hop head. Body may be a bit thin, but that my make this sort of a refreshing beer. After drinking the whole bottle, I can feel the hop resin in my mustache. That has to count for something."
"Drinkability: Delicious but extremely potent. Not exactly a quaffable beer, but highly drinkable nonetheless."
"The flavor is a surprisingly melodic melding of diverse sensory elements. And the wonderfully lingering aftertaste is damned near ambrosial, leaving a vestigial grin in its wake. Sure, the ABV is a hoot, but it simply joins in the fun rather than do anything to dampen it. Caution be damned, this is one mighty drinkable creation. My eternal thanks to Wasatch for this bottle, as he delivered beery happiness to my doorstep."
"Drinkability/Notes: What a really nice beer. Very well balanced with big citrusy hops and a fruity, malty sweetness that isn't too obtrusive. A lingering taste of rye in the aftertaste is definitely present. Extremely drinkable for 8% abv. The alcohol is hidden very well with just a slight warmness on the face. One of my favorite IPA's that borders on a DIPA and one that I never pass up. The appearance is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommended. Seek and enjoy."
"This beer's an American classic. It's readily available in CA and makes for an easy go-to beer when the choices are limited."
"D: A very tasty IPA, different from the rest with its high grain bill. Bold flavors, a big ABV, and 22 oz. serving sizes make it the type of beer I'd only have one of in a night. Most flavors will pale in comparison to this. A recommended beer for certain..."
"I hadn't had this in a while and forgot how good this was. This will become a staple in the fridge from now on."
"got this in a trade awhile ago and cannot remember who sent it but thank you. poured a nice ruby with a light tan head that left some lacing. aroma, hops and brown sugar come out strong, with some malts and alcohol, chocolate, dark bread. flavor, malts and dry hops, molasses, alcohol, caramel, grapefruit. would like to get more of this"
"Pours a hazy amber color with reddish hues when held to light. Good head and great retention. Aroma of clean citrusy hops, grapefruit specifically. Taste is more hops followed by some malty sweetness adding a little balance. This is how a beer should feel in the mouth. I could drink this all day."
"I like this beer a lot. Too bad I have to order this and pay exorbatent(sp) shipping costs."
"Big thanks to IntriqKen for giving me a chance to try this, as I've been wanting to get my hands on some for quite a while."
"I would enjoy this with a meal. I have this idea in my head that it needs to be a meal involving corned beer, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese...am I getting through?"
"Pours a deep red mahogony with a giant tan frothy head. A real nice looking beer, even thu its much different looking from the other American IPA's. The smell is a strong citrus hop aroma, tangerine and grapefruit dominate. The taste is citrus hops along with the hop bitterness bite. Tangerine and grapefruit,like the smell, dominate the taste. Bear Republic does a great job of masking the high alcohol in this beer. The m/f is light and well balanced, almost a creamy feel to it. A damn good IPA from one of the premiere brewerys in the US."
"Great beer."
"Slainte!"
"An excellent IPA and a great seasonal offering. I'm really starting to like Bear Republic brewing. This beer has a great mouthfeel and very nice mixture of hops and malt/rye. Also, my first beer with a significant addition of rye as an ingredient. A must have!"
"Poured a dark red/amber color with a frothy beige head and sediment floating around. Lacing GALORE. Gorgeoud brew. Smells of maltiness, rye, HOPS. Hops seem to get bigger and bigger while drinking this beer. Like a compound effect in a way. Much rye to speak of as well, godamn delicious. This tastes more like a DIPA than just an IPA. Just guessing but seems to have a boatload of Cascade and Amarillo hops. It is a huge beer, to say the least. Considering the quality of this beer and the respectable price per bomber, Ill definitely be coming back to this one again. My first Bear Republic offering after always seeing them for years. No idea what took me so long. Anyways, now Im looking forward to the Black Bear Stout!"
"I have this tendency, i think, to want to rate every beer that is well-hopped and satisfying as the best IPA available....a trait that increases in strength as i move deeper into the bottle. This was one of those beers. Oh man, its a good one. Its dark red and smells just like raw hops right after you open the sealed bag. It's flavorful...bitter and hoppy with a nice creamy, bready taste underneath. The bitterness on this beer isn't super strong at first but it grows and then holds steady throughout the drinking period. I do like it very much indeed. This was my first Bear Republic beer and so now im much more excited about the Big Bear Black Stout i have in the cellar."
"Drinkability: I could kick back a couple of these... it's a tasty beer to be sure."
"D: Solid. I'd drink this again in a second."
"Surprisingly balanced, complex brew. High ABV is well hidden. Definitely recommended as a tasty treat."
"Medium bodied. Well presented. I'll enjoy this one again."
" Tastes incredibly balanced, huge hops countered nicely by the rye. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. Finally, a rye beer that I would actually buy, or trade for, again."
"Tastes great, but not quite as great as the smell. The hops are still huge, but not as juicy as I was hoping. Big grapefruit moving into a mixture of nearly perfect rye and dryer hops, finishing on a wonderful mixture of brown sugar and caramel. Great."
"The color is a dark brown amber, with red-ish high lights. The head is dissipating which I am beginning to think is more my glass than the beer, so I wont fault it there. How ever the head lingers around the edges leaving subtle lacing. It smells of hops, lots of hops bitter and sweet hops the ryes sweetness is also present. The taste is great very hoppy the sweet earthiness of the rye is present then some coffee and a nice bittersweet finish. Like most excellent IPAs the after taste and my burps are excellent and demand that I drink more. I have to thank Adam and Ashley for introducing me to Bear Republic. This is one of my new fav. IPAs."
"This beer pours an amber brown with a frothy off white head that laces beautifully with amazing retention. The smell is sweet and malty with plenty of hops swimming aound my nose. The taste hits you first with the hops, but then there is the rye malt taste that reminds you of some jewish bakery. There is also plently of malty sweetness in there to balance. The mouthfeel is thick and carbonated well. Overall, a great beer, too bad I had to get it via liquid solutions."
"This is the epitomy of bold IPA's. Perfect flavor, nice hopping, and a solid malt backbone. A divine nectar sent from the gods above! Much thanks go out to IntriqKen for giving me the opportunity to try this brew."
"Overall: Very tasty. The hop bitterness is high, but is balanced by an underlying maltiness that never seems too sweet."
"D: For me, the beer starts out mediocre...until the palate adjusts to all the various flavors. Lots of original tastes working together in harmony. Well done."
"Great IPA that lived up to all my expectations. The taste is more balanced than most other IPAs I've had with the rye adding an extra level to this brew. Just wish I could get this in NC."
"RedwoodGeorge: Thanks for the hook-up!"
"D-Definitely different than any beer I've tried. It's good though. Would want to try it again but wouldn't sit a drink more than one a night."
"Shiny new quarter. Seriously."
"22 oz bomber. A real treat for a FL beer-lover to get one of these. Pours a somewhat hazy dark brown/copper color with a generous rocky, long lasting creamy head. Thick lacing along the sides of the glass. Classic west coast hoppy aroma loaded with freshly cut grapefruit and pine needles. Mouthfeel is quite full and round with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. Immediate flavors of spicey rye, orange, grapefruit and some lightly roasted malts make their presence. Although of course the hops dominate there is a notable background malt sweetness which balances it all out nicely. Finish is long, crisp and moderately bitter. My bottles label (unsure of vintage year) notes 8% abv just as a side note. This was a super treat!"
"Hop Rod Rye pours a dark brown after the prodigious head off white finally settles down. This one poured all foam, even though I poured it carefully. The aroma is hoppy. The taste is also hoppy from start to finish. The rye definitely lends this beer a different character. Excellent beer, recommended."
"On-tap @ Horse Brass in Portland, OR. Color is a deep ruby-amber with a nice creamy head. The aroma is nice spicy hops. The taste is quite unique. There is a diffinite hop bitterness from beginning to end. There is what I precieve as the malted rye that has sort of a sweet and dry taste. The mouthfeel is brought down by the drying character, but the body is medium. I wouldn't want more than two of these is a sitting"
"Dense, retentive head that gave me more than a 1/4 inch head. The color is dark and red. Smell is aromatic, sweet, and hoppy. I smell grassy hops, dark fruit and caramel flavors. The taste is bitter with fruitiness with a bready aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, very enjoyable. This is extremely drinkable, I would almost chug this."
"D: Incredible for its strength, but certainly a hop-heads delight."
" Appearance is unremarkable, sort of coppery reddish brown with a thick stiff head that persissts. the smell is earthy/spicy over a robust maltiness good but not excessive citrus hops. The taste is well balanced, plenty of hops and noticeable alcohol but well counter-balanced with both malt sweetness and a certain earthy flair. It's medium bodied and smooth for an IPA and more drinkable than most."
"Mouthfeel is phenomenal. Smoothest IPA ever. This is perfection in a bottle!!! Hops are up front in your face citrusy, with a nice sweet malt background. Not sure if the rye accounts for smoothness, but this is dangerous. At 8% alcohol, this one packs a punch quickly, even though it tastes so good going down, you want to keep drinking. Wish this could be a session brew, but it's too strong!"
"Pours a murky amber to brown in color with some good size bottle conditioned chunks. The head is quite large and required a slow and controlled pour to keep it down, it hung around a little and laced nicely on the glass. Initial aroma is mainly a nice sweet orange smell, there is also a little grassiness that works in as it warms. There is also some sugary sprite like sweetness with a yeasty bread aroma. Taste is a nice balance between the sweet and bitter with a nice zip and a slight tanginess as well. There is a nice spice to the finish and a slight dryness. The alcohol is well balanced, I don't really notice it until the very end as it is pretty much at room temp. Easy to drink."
"Very drinkable if your a hop head, it doesn't drink like its 8%. Another winner from Bear Republic."
"I had this at the Map Room in Chicago. I'd been wanting to try the Hop Rod for a while, so I was excited to finally get my hands on some. A nice, dark amber/almost brownish body with a wafty tan head. Smell was of bittering hops and bready, toasty malt. A nice combination. I would have pegged it as an Irish Red Ale, or something along those lines, rather than an American IPA. Anyways, a nicely balanced beer with a medium mouthfeel and really easy going down. Definately worth trying!"
"This is a very special beer indeed! Pours a traditional brown-red color, with a very interesting wavy cascade effect and lacing that seems to last for the life of the beer. Smell is strong, and is a nice mixture of hops and malt together. There is also a big chewy smell that is very enticing. Boy, does the taste sure deliver! The first quarter is heavy on the malt with the sweetness hitting immidiatly and playing on our tongue. The next big taste has the malt and hops together, and they create a synergistic effect that leaves you craving more. There is also a taste that is foreign to me, but I will say its Rye, as its a main ingredient in the beer. As this beer goes down it lingers for a while with a pleasant sweetness of the malts, and even at 8% there is no appearance of alcohol. Truely a special beer!"
"Good drinkability. After the first pint, I was disappointed that there was somewhat less than a pint left in the bomber!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium body. The beer is well carbonated. The hops have a pleasant lingering oilyness. This beer is really something special. I enjoyed the beer from the instant I opened the beer. I would highly reccomend this beer to my other BA's."
"D - Very close to exceptional. Excellent flavorful beer. Dangerously easy to drink. I can't wait to trade / order some more. Very impressed."
"Very drinkable- especially for an 8% abv. Nice long flavor that keeps you wanting more. Really a very good beer."
"Rye grains in any other beer style doesn't work for me. But in an IPA, I think it adds character and an intense bittering. An otherwise, great IPA has been improved with some serious hopping and a rye grain flavor / astringency than any malt base cannot compete with. Sweet, of course, but quickly dominated with hop citrus, pine, grass, and dirty flavors. Rye contributes a deep molassas bitter-sweetness and a grain husk bittering. Perhaps too astringent to make it easy drinking. Otherwise malty sweet with a dark toasted grain flavor. Bitter til the end with a shadowing sweetness, muskiness, and earthiness. Very good beer."
"Note: I've had this on tap too... and it was even better then, I hope I find it that way again."
"Supremely well balanced maltiness and hoppiness. The alcohol is hidden well for 8%. Nice full mouth feel without being clingy. Very refreshing. If you like rye/rye beer this is the stuff! Thank you to whomever sent this to my husband!"
"Poured into a tulip glass from a bomber. Dark red, almost opaque color with a thick frothy head. Lots of thick lacing also. Aroma was of hops and something else I can't quite identify but is probably the rye. Taste was very hoppy like most IPA's but with a different background, again probably the rye, excellent flavor but not the regular sweet malt flavor you get in most IPA's. Went down very easily, would have gotten a 4.5 or 5 for drinkability but the high ABV means it's not a session beer, for me at least."
"Doesn't really fit the style(IPA) that I'm used to, but it is a beer that I highly recommend."
"The drinkability was superb. The higher ABV was so well hidden it may lead you to think this beer would session easy. A big beer that does not act big. This beer has fanfare and now I see why. This is unlike any other IPA I have had."
"D - Good. Another great beer from Bear Republic."
" Just the right amount of bitterness to keep this beer very drinkable. The alchol is very well hidden, but comes more to the forefront as it warms. Very nice take on the style. Recommended"
"Very nice, I enjoyed it. Bear Republic has impressed me with their beers so far, and this is no exception. They're turning into one of my favorite breweries. Not quite up to Stone, but they're getting there. Recommended as a nice change of pace IPA."
"Sharp and tangy, the Bear Republic makes some might fine beverages."
"I need to find a place that carries this in bottles."
"Extremely drinkable and enjoyable for an 8% brew. This one will certainly frequent my fridge in the future. Bear Republic continues to impress."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I will purchase it again along with Bear Republic's Red Rocket."
"This beer pours a blood red color. The head is massive, creamy and recedes slowly. The lacing consists of mountains of foam. If I could give this beer a 5.5 for appearance I would. The aroma is sharp, spicy, citrusy, grapefruit, with a nice malty undertone. The taste is sharp like the aroma, but more so from the hops than from the rye. The bitterness leads the way with the rye coming through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little on the ligher side of medium bodied. Overall, this is a very good brew that I will drink any chance I get."
"Drinkability: Pretty mild, easy to drink - seems like a good compromise between an IPA and a more standard ale, as the rye seems to make it a bit richer while the hops aren't as intense as they would be in the average IPA."
"Slàinte!"
"Deliciously hoppy with some fine citrusy taste with a slight hint of rye. Not as much as one would expect. Very dry bitter finish. Highly drinkable. I'd like to have a few cases of this one."
"I liked this a lot, and if I can remember where I got it, I'll buy more. Somewhere in NY, I think."
"Comment: This was a very good beer. I liked it all the way through the bomber. Nice example of the style...."
"Dark amber with a slightly off-white head. Lacing left along the glass all the way down. Smells of malt and caramel. Taste is a little surprising, since very little hops is detectable in aroma, but it is very much a hoppy beverage. Carbonation was a little choopy, making for an odd over-carbonated mouthfeel. But, overall, the bomber was gone in less than an hour...and I will be getting another next week."
"Bottle from Hogtownharry: Poured a dark amber color ale with huge foamy off-white heat with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with good malt backbone is very interesting. Taste is a mix between semi-sweet caramel malt with some c-hops that provide a bitter finish. Rye is quite hard to distinguish and doesnt seem to provide that much in the overall mix. Body is slightly above average and alcohol is well hidden. Very well done overall but definitely not a style (American strong ale) that really excite me."
"All in all a great beer and one of the most amazing beers to come out of a bottle. Bear Republic probably does bottling better than any one else. Try it if you get a chance."
"I have a fever...and the only prescription...is more hops. This one doesn't dissapoint. By far the darkest IPA I have ever encountered, this also makes the beer possibly one of the most attractive in the glass..that and it's glue like tan/mocha head that rises past two fingers and stays at one finger throgh the first 3/4 of the session....wow. The smell is robust and full piney floral hops, a definite rye tinge and even some woody notes, very herbal. The taste is nice, more roasted malt than I had expected...and almost perfectly balanced....wow again. The mouthfeel is ultra creamy with just enough carbonation to let you know what you are drinking. I could slam this one all day long...and then go to sleep. WOW a great beer!"
"drinkability: will cherish the 22oz, a great ipa"
"Nice beer. It came highly recommended, but I was a little concerned that it would have too much of a hop flavor for my tastes, but I was pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended."
"Bottom line: This is a world class IPA. See it? Buy it."
"D: Had this one in a bomber, could not drink much more after having one of these, it was pretty heavy, nevertheless a very tasty beer, thanks to GClarkage for this beer."
"D - this is a very, very tasty product and well crafted, but the full body, above average alcohol content, malty sweetness, and strong bitterness is so great, I couldn't drink more than one or two of these in a sitting."
"Overall, this beer surprise me more than any beer has recently. I went in to the experience with an open mind and man was I really blown away. From now on I will always pick this up when I find it."
"Mouth: This beer is so hoppy the bitterness actually burns, but in a yummy way. The hops carry an excellent herbal spiciness with them and the high alcohol content just heats those flavors up to an even more amazing degree. The only let down is the soft mouthfeel that really disappoints me because otherwise this would be one hell of a beer."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with a small off white head. Smells of pine, hops, sweet malts, and a very faint grapefruit scent. Extremely hoppy tasting beer, with the rye flavor definitely shining through with a pretty strong aftertaste. Pretty pleasant beer, very drinkable for how high the abv. Is. Not exactly my favorite IIPA its still a pretty nice seasonal treat."
"Drinkability is good."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Medium bodied in the mouth, with just enough to keep it alive. This beer is much bigger than its mouthfeel suggests, as it packs its punch enormously in the belly and body. Great beer, and well worth the money."
"D - Very drinkable. Glad to get a chance to check this brew out, it was never on my list, but now it is thanks to BA."
"I deducted a bit on the ""drinkability", because while it is quite drinkable, it's too hoppy for me. It's a goody but not something I'll be drinking a lot of."
"I needed some corn beef and gulden's mustard to go with this... just kidding. I don't think you can compare this to your everyday IPA.. it is very different. maybe a bit too heavy for an IPA ? regardless it is quite enjoyable, for the price it is very nice... another good one from Bear Republic... come to new jersey goddamnit !!"
"Overall a superb IPA. A nice ABV and an excellent body."
"I can't get over the creamy velvety texture of this beer while at the same time imparting a kick-ass bitterness. An excellent IPA."
"This is really good and I'll grab it again when I'm on the west coast. Too bad it's not distributed to OH."
"Da: High. Hey, I couldn't drink this stuff like water, but it is a fine ale to keep on the shelf for worthy occasions."
"Very drinkable considering the ABV and the strong flavors going on. I certainly would drink this again in a heartbeat and had no problem finishing it all."
"Drinkability: A top flight DIPA with a nice sour rye kick to it"
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but rather light. Flavor lingers for quite a while. Drinkability is good."
"This bomber poured an almost cola brown with an amazing tan head that lasts until the end. Leaves chunks of lacing. Don't be overly aggressive with the pour or you'll need a couple of towels. Strong pine and citrus hop scent with a light sour but sweet malt coming through in the end. The taste is somewhat more balanced than what the smell would have you believe. Citrusy hops from the start that are replaced with bready malts in the middle before the hops smack you again. Just a bit of bitterness on the finish. Slick, oily feel from the hops. Quite a tasty brew. My glass is empty but I still have remnants from the head left. Wow!"
"The large amount of hops leaves a somewhat grainy mouthfeel but not necessarily bad. Hop flavors are very tannic and somewhat cloying. Very piney floral flavors with a light rye backbone."
"I'm not sure how old this bottle was when I bought it, and age may have taken a slight toll on the aroma. Nevertheless, this is a big, flavorful, hop-tastic beer worth seeking out."
"Pretty bad ass bottle for a pretty bad ass beer. Pours a deep dark copper with magnificent rubaeous hues and a huge, fluffy, three finger beige head that never goes away. Seriously, when I finished the last sip in my glass there was still this little dollop of cream sitting in the bottom of the glass. Admittedly, I love rye beers and this is no exception. Nose is oat and bread malts with wonderful fruit esters, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is massages the tongue like the older girl who taught you how to kiss in high school. Through the wonderful physical sensation comes a hot rod load of hop bitterness, rye flavors, citrus fruit, and spice. Finishes thick and chewy. Good to the last drop like a cup of the old Maxwell House."
"p.s.: as of Nov. 2006, this is still my favorite beer, uh, ever!"
"but I changed it accordingly with my experience last night. Look for another review in the near future."
"This is a cool take on the American IPA, with that rye essence coming through not just in name but full-on in the flavor. Recommended."
"As I love rye beers, I was really had my hopes up, as did my wife. We' were a bit dissapointed. While this has plenty of hoppiness, which is great, I didn't detect much, if anything, in the way of rye. There's plenty of hops an dmalt in the taste. Good bitterness."
"Dark brown and reddish in color with a thick one inch carmel colored head. Slightly cloudy from this unfiliered brew. Wonderful hops smell. Rich and fulfilling taste. The alcohol is masked by the rich hops flavor. Layers of lacing on the pint glass. All I kept thinking is how good this beer was. My first offering from Bear Republic and clearly impressed. Side note: I like it when you can see yeast in the glass, ""That's good nutrients."""
"Medium bodied, with light carbonation. Definite alcohol kick which kind of sneaks up on you. Easier to drink than I expected, if it wasn't for the 8% ABV I could see drinking quite a few of these at a time."
"Darker mohogany color with copper twinge. Meduim creamy dense tan head rests atop. Lots of bubbles rising. A few hop flakes seem to have found their way in. A hop blast greets me as I smell the beer. Spicy, piney hops. Caramel, rye flakes. A bit of some roasted malts compliment the spicyness. Taste seems to follow suit. Begins with the huge hop hit. Spicy and bitter but not overdone. Caramel and bready flavors balance it out. Bitterness wins but the malts add another element of flavor. A slight alcohol burn lends a hand towards the finish. Rye seems to be there but really brings out a spicy, sweet finish with some hop flavor melded together. Slick body with the right amount of spicyness and pricklyness. Fresh tasting, I could drink many of these. Well done all around."
"very drinkable, it makes a good sessionable higher abv hop heads beer if that makes sense. bitter hoppy, fairly complex, but mellow and smooth. very nice."
"A very drinkable beer. Wonderful to kick back and enjoy on it's own. Bitter as all hell. A very very unique American IPA."
"Light brown two finger head poured from 22 oz.'er. Deeper than normal copper for an IPA, more copper than orange, and there was the expected haze. Very nice lacing. Aroma -citrus, and diacetyl malt. Taste - the citrus hops, of course and slight diacetyl, somewhat less than aroma had me expecting, which is good because I rather dislike the diacetyl taste, instead the malt had a small somewhat doughy taste upfront, which I suspect is due to the rye, but then diacetyl aftertaste made unusally bitter by the citrusy hops. The mouth was fairly smooth owing to the hops, and somewhat more carbonated than I expect or want for an IPA, leaving a slightly thick, and bitter coating. Diacetyl usaully ruins a brew for me and this is the case here- Hop Rod was an okay ride- but one I think will let pass me by when hitchhiking the HopHead Highway."
"i love this stuff, man. i wish they had the black rye when i was there; i'd love to try it"
"22 oz. bomber, seasonal but with no year marked, although it was new in the store. It pours an unfiltered deep garnet with a half-inch of tan head that leaves some lacing. The bouquet includes mango, some rye tang, pineapple, mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, pine, and some alcohol. Smells wonderful. It tastes similar to the aroma with the addition of caramel/buttery malts, biscuits, and a healthy bitterness on top of a big, creamy, chewy body. This is quite drinkable and a nice take on an IPA. I like the rye kick, as it blends well with the other flavors and doesn't overpower them. Delicious."
"H.R.R. pours dark amber with a rich mocha colored head with generous carbonation visible within, creating a well-aerated frothy head and a well-mannered nose of fresh hops, sweet malt and pine. The mouthfeel is moderately bitter, with a viscous coating within the mouth. Hints of sweet honeyed cashew and a nice citric element draw the taste buds to attention. This brew is nicely balanced in all of the senses, very much in proportion and quite an enjoyable west coast libation."
"It is different, however. But, I would like to see this a little less hoppy and step up the rye to really set it apart."
"While the mouthfeel is full and somewhat balanced, wonderful hop bitterness grabs you, and provides a great aftertaste. Rye doesn't jump out at you but is present. Very fitting for a hop head like me. Rye IPA is becoming one of my favorite styles. [Everything from Bear Republic is GREAT!]"
"Well at first appearance this doesn't look anything like any ipa I've had before. Appearance is a dark amber similar to what I would expect from a winter warmer, head is creamy similar to a Guiness. This beer explodes with aromas of pine and citrus,more than I've ever experienced in an IPA. Taste is similar to smell with pine and citrus as the predominant flavors with a strong bite at first taste. Mouthfeel is smooth after the initial carbonation bite, the 8% alcohol is hidden pretty well. After drinking for a while I notice quite the build up in my mouth of hops. Drinkability, I would put simply as I would have no problem downing a bomber but as with most strong IPA's I'd better be home if I wanted to have another. For price factor this is an incredible beer, I paid around $4 for a bomber."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability on this one are very high. Well balanced and smooth make is a nice session beer. Good carbonation and a smooth finish allow you to take advantage of the complex taste. High alcohol content isn't very noticeable--this may creap up on you depending on how many you drink."
"PS Why is this labeled a seasonal? Is it really? I have been able to get it regularly for a few years now."
"This beer pours a nice mohagony color. Lacing is outstanding just like the Ipa. If you didn't read the bottle you would never know this one had 8% alcohol. Great tasting beer, in which one can get in trouble with. Bear Republic, make some very good IPAs. These I would consider to session beers, because you can drink more than one because of the great taste. If anyone hasn't tried Bear Republic than they should, awesome double IPA. I want to state something about Bear Republics IPAs, they are dangerous, they are enjoyable to drink and one can drink one after the other. Awesome beer."
"Bear Republic has impressed me with every one of their beers Ive tried. They get it done consistantly, and at a high level. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. HIGHLY recommended for any hophead or IPA/IIPA fan."
"Quite an exceptional beer! Bear Republic has my undying respect."
"D - I highly recommend this one. It's very drinkable and if I wasn't such a lightweight I'd probably drink 3 or 4 of these things in one sitting. In my opinion, this is a robust 'session' beer - ok maybe not sessionable at 8% but tastes like you could. Time to search for a clone."
"A definate suggestion."
"Doesn't taste as strong as listed, but that's part of the fun and danger with this. Poured into a large flute, it was a dark red, almost brown with copper hues. Thin tan head on top that wasn't sticking around for the whole ride. The nose was of big, citrusy hops, very little pine in this one, lots of citrus, also a heavy nose of rye. The taste is sweet malt that is dominated by the rye flavor that doesn't overwhelm, but doesn't hide either. Thick citrus flavor sticks to your mouth while drinking this amazing beer. I made the comment that I almost wanted to drop some saurkraut and swiss cheese in it. I would definiately pair this with a lighter flavored cheese, or a reuben sandwich. I loved this beer and will be drinking it next time I can get my hands on it."
"In an era of big IPAs, this is a stand out."
"Clear copper colored, few streams of carbonation, some floaties (I dont mind), very finely bubbled, yet massive khaki head. Very sticky, and long lasting. The nose is a perfect balance of muted hops, rye and toasty caramel malts with a slight burnt aspect. Based on other reviewers, I really think there's quite a bit of bottle age on this one. I venture at least a year, perhaps more. Flavor upfront is wide and expansive toasty, rye, very slightly sweet. Muted by underlying bitterness, but that seems very muted as well like the hop flavor. There's some definite age to this. This could almost fit into the old ale category, not IPA. That said, the balance is spectacular. Very slow evolving flavor, and ponderous as slight hops ebb in and out between substantial malt and alcohol/rye spice. At this stage the rye is very evident. Very full in the mouth with light carbonation, perfectly creamy. Very drinkable, but due to the age, ponderous. I like it this way, though, i am sure, a completely different animal than when fresh. Shouldn't even be considered the same beer. That said, anyone with ready access to this should try aging it a bit."
"A beer I will definitely revisit on tap again!"
"A very drinkable brew that is balanced and tasty."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite excellent, interesting variation on the style."
"Delicious."
"I have to admit, all said and done, I think this is one I might love on the right time, on the right day. But here, now, it does not grab me like some of the other DIPAs I've had. Good, but I've enjoyed others I liked more."
"A Bear Republic barleywine... man... sign me up for some of that."
"One of the few double IPA that had enough hops bitterness to cover the sweetness. This is one I really enjoyed. Another winner from Bear Republic. Much thanks to the immortal maltygoodness."
"I have seen this on tap at Redbones, but passed on it since they had Stone IPA and I just wasn't sure about it. I will never make that mistake again.Great work, Bear Republic!"
"D - I really enjoyed this one. It has a fabulous taste and a great look. I see why everyone enjoys this so much. I could buy this again definitely (especially with Bear Republic's reasonable bomber prices). A bomber, maybe two for the hardy, would make for an excellent ""session", but this is definitely not a sessionable beer (too strong)."
"Dark amber in color, has a medium head with nice retention. There is a lot of carbonation going on in this one. The aroma is fairly one dimensional but it is a nice fresh hop smell, very strong. The strong hops are noticed immediately upon tasting, and it hides the malt flavor. Has a nice strong bitter finish. Actually the malt does seem to balance things out a bit after drinking more. This thing is silky smooth,with a rich full body, and excellent carbonation. I wouldn't consider myself a ""hophead"" but this was one of the best hoppy beers I've had."
"The texture is a littled watery but good flavor and decent body. A creamy taste but the spice limits the texture. Very easy to drink and a nice overall beer."
"in a few years, forgot how much I like...highly recommend to fellow hop-heads!"
"An excellent double IPA--hop-heads rejoice."
"Very tasty beer, one I'm sure I'll reach for again and again"
"Drinkability: though I tend to hit my hop limit after one IPA per session, I could come back for a few of these. A few... pints, that is. I dunno about these deuce-deuces. Phew."
"What a fantastic pairing of flavors and superb drinkability. Ill be keeping my eyes open for more rye based brews in the future."
"The alcohol content is hidden quite well."
"Different from other DIPA's, not as slick and oily. Head retention was amazing, great presentation by The Map Room. Just checked ABV, had no idea it was near 8%, could easily catch up with you because one isn't enough."
"This beer is absolutely perfect if ever there was a perfect beer. I'm changing my favorite style to American Double IPA based on this. Pours a rich amber to mahogany with a rich sea foam head that lasts and clings everywhere. Nose is full of delicious citrus hops, some subdued candy malts and a slight alcoholic pepper. Taste is divine, a solid perfectly executed wall of hops slams the palate with grapefruit, zest, pineapple, and candy sweetness in the background...no foul grassyness or over the top bitterness here. Bear Republic has reminded me with this beer of why I love beer, a true masterpiece....im gushing...I can't say enough."
"Drinkability was up there. Without a doubt I would be willing to have this one again,"
"Drinkability: great drinkability, a must have for those who haven't had one yet."
"I put some pizza in the oven, intending to drink this beer with them when they were done, but in the ten minutes it took the pizza to cook, I drank the first 12oz like a greedy bastard and had to pour the rest of the bottle to have with my food. This beer deserves all the praise it's received! God Bless California!"
"Hop Rod is my first brew by Bear Republic and Im sold already. Wonderful beer."
"An exceptional Double IPA, with a uniqueness that will keep you coming back for more.."
"Taste; the piney hops hit first followed by that rye spiciness that just really stands out. A nice grapefruit flavor mixes in with a nice caramel malty presence on the finish that's really pleasant. For a DIPA this beer is not overly bitter. This beer has a nice and chewy mouthfeel, but has a little more of a carbonation bite to it that I would have liked. This is a truely ""outstanding"" beer."
"another solid beer from bear republic (their IPA is one of my favorites)."
"Bear Republic makes some damned fine beers, this one being no exception."
"This beer has the most incredible head I have ever seen in a beer. It is almost stiff in intensity and the entire two fingers will last through then entire drink. You litterally can sculpt the head of bubbles you will get with a pour all the way to the bottom of the glass. While being the stiffest head I have ever seen from a brew, it is not a bad thing at all...I enjoy this extra touch of heavenly richness the head imparts."
"yeah, it hits you all right. abv, ibu, ... ok, i cant think of another one. my point is, it all adds up. this is not a mellow beer. brash and bold, it will take no prisoners."
"my first review, why not make it hop rod. i am officially in love with this beer. beautiful dark reddish color. the taste is hops galour. alcohol is there but hidden very well. i'm trying not to drink it so fast so i don't get hammered. don't know what else to say but..wow. bear republic has yet to dissapoint me."
"poured a slightly hazy, deep copper color with massive off-white head. Beautiful lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is loaded with hops, with much citrus and piney notes to be found. Some malt also present. Taste is strong on pine hops with a nice balance of to"
"Pours a dark brown color with a white colored head that remains thick for quite a long time. Aromas of hops, alcohol, honey, and grains seem to come out. The taste is full of hop-bitterness with a rye-derived bite that lingers in the aftertaste. A very smooth and tasty Double IPA. Suprisingly refreshing and enjoyable as a slow sipping beer or as a gulping beer. Excellent drinkability."
"Ok, let's be honest here, this beer pours so damn dark, if it were just a few shades darker, it'd be black. Dark brown with ruby edges and a nice velvety dense head that fires off aroma at you. Hitting you from every angle ... pine, followed by grapefruit and then smooth caramel malt. A sip treats the tongue to initial bitterness followed by a whallop of pine and grapefruit. The malt smoothes things out followed by fleeting grain and an citrusy orange taste. Mouthfeel is big, which is just what I want in a brew like this. Your tongue will say yes to more and more of this but beware, with an 8% ABV, respect is in order. The only Double IPA I've had that can even try to stand up to this is Hercules by Great Divide. Even then though, I wouldn't be shocked to see the mighty Hercules fall. This brew is that tough."
"This beer would make a good session beer if the alcohol content was a bit lower. It is at 8%, so it might be hard to dring this beer all night, but with the mild, non aggressive flavor, I might just have to have another one."
"Reddish brown with a very nice off white head that lasts. The smell is pure hops...very piney. The hop's smell does not let much else through. This beer smells wonderful. This is a great tasting beer. The first part is all piney hops and as it fads the rye comes in. The rye really gives this beer a good taste. The aftertaste is nicely bittered, but not a whole lot of malt to balance. The mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer this big, but the drinkability is stellar. Just like Racer 5 and X, this is a very good beer."
"Goes down smooth and easy. The ABV is slightly prohibitive in making a session out of this one, but what the heck. It's a fine brew!"
"Mouthfeel is very nice, however. Full, creamy, and smooth. Lovely. Drinkability is pretty good- easy to drink, with a sneaky alcohol content. A good brew."
"If Bear Republic was available to me locally, it would quickly become my favority brewery Hop Rod Rye strenthens this sentiment as everything about this wonderful beer smacks of it being extremely well made. This starts with its beautiful appearance, the color of which is very dark amber. A huge tan head forms that never really completely disappears. Instead, it just gets rockier and rockier unitl it looks like a snow covered mountain top. The lacing is so thick, you can't see through it. The aroma is very strong full of a gloriously resinous hoppiness, obviously from the Pacific Northwest. The taste picks this up and a beautiful, but never harsh, hoppiness asserts itself. This is supported by a very nice malt base that keeps it from becoming too harsh. The rye begins to come through towards the finish and gives this beer a unique character when compared to other IPAs. The mouthfeel is great, nice and thick and chewy. The drinkability is dangerous at 8%. As I've already said, this is a superb beer that packs a punch from start to finish. It reeks of class."
"Awesome. 22 ouncer bought at towne club beverage. Nice one and a half inch tan, creamy soft head. The body is a very dark rust-amber. Cool lacing. The aroma is strong pine hops but the dry smell is definately the rye. The rye isn't that strong but i like it. Same goes for the taste. Pine trees and rye. To me this tastes very similar to racer 5 when it comes to bitterness, maybe even less flavor. But it seems more well rounded and interesting. A coarse tasting beer that is still pleasant. Very drinkable."
"Overall Impression: Serious brew; a nice double IPA with a great dose of rye. I have even more respect for the great bear now. Tons of thanks to my HS buddy Eric for hand carrying it (and others) out from California to Texas."
"Drinkability: A very entertaining brew. Enough to keep me busy for a while with one. Damn tasty & goes down real smooth. This one's a winner."
"Pours a dark garnet/mahogany color with a few fingers of tan, rocky head with some good lacing and retention. On my second pour a film of rubbery-looking yeast plopped into my glass, kinda strange. Looks more like a scotch ale to me. Nose is strong, rich floral/piney hops with sweet tropical fruit notes. Taste starts off with a hearty pine-hop kick but as it warms transitions into caramel malt, sweet pineapple, apricot and citrus. A faint rye bitterness can be detected but I wouldn't have guessed there was rye in it without the name. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. This is a highly drinkable DIPA, the alcohol is well-hidden. Nice balance between sweet malty/fruity and bitter hops here. Another winner from Bear Republic."
"N.B. Not for the true hop-heads, this is only a moderately hoppy brew."
"Overall = I'm glad I got to try this. The head and lacing is absolutely gorgeous and it's one of the better looking IPAs I've ever seen. The taste while above average is not up with my favorites. I enjoyed this beer but not as much as a Dogfish Head 90 or Ruination. I still recommend it."
"I have never gotten hop burps off of beer that is not very, very fresh. Until now."
"I don't think I've ever finished a bomber as quickly as I have this one. Alcohol is virtually non-existent, yeah right. No really, it disguised wonderfully."
"D - A slower drinker, for me at least. A normal 8% ABV and nice hop whallop, keeps it on par with other better dIPA's."
"Taste: This is a really nice beer. You can pick out the rye, but there is a complete enough malt balance to make it taste really appropriate. The balance is tipped toward the hops, and it finishes bitter."
"Wow, what can I say about this one. This has an appealing amber hue coming out of the bottle with a good 2 inch head that lasts forever. Smell is of strong fresh hops and rye. Mmm, Mmm, Mmm is all I can say about the taste. A Hopheads dream come true! Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good. Drinkability is slightly higher than most beer of the same style due to the slightly lower alc/vol. Would have again and again and again."
"Bottle reads as follows, Hop Rod Rye is a high performance, turbo charged, alcohol burnin monster ale with dual overhead hop injection, made with 18% rye. Pours a deep murky and rusty copper color with a billowing tan head of foam that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a tall and rocky lace. Floral piney hops dominate the nose but there is also a strong presence of sweet malt in the background. The taste is right with the aroma as bitter and pungent hops with flavors of fresh pine and grapefruit rind are very nicely balanced by the sweet rye grain. A highly enjoyable beer in all respects."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very substantial full bodied ale (it is a DIPA afterall). Its very well hopped but with a good sweet malt base. Love it."
"Despite its strength I could drink this until sleepy! Only had 2 from bear republic ( black bear stout, being the other), but Iam ho(p)ping for more!"
"A very satisfying brew, a very different IIPA in a very good way. This is one to keep in constant supply. Be careful- this does weigh in at 8%ABV, but I would never know it from the taste and the smooth way it seems to fly down my throat. I never thought something this hoppy could be so easy to drink and leave you wanting more much more of that Hop Rod Rye. A must try."
"Thick, creamy head rushes up the sides of the glass on the pour... it's huge! I stick a finger into the densely honeycombed bubbles, and they actually ooze upwards along my finger... not the kind of behavior you expect from a beer operating under the normal constraints of physical law. Beer is very dark in color--almost mahogany--with highlights of glowing auburn, copiously streaked through by steady-rising lines of carbonation. From the bottle I smell fresh papaya, but out of the glass this just reeks of hops. Nosefeel is fragrant and arid, with a framework of dried-out hops; dry leaves and berries; and piney, aromatic, sage-like herbs. The flavors seem almost entirely free of sweetness. Pumpernickel bread and cedar blend with an array of dried spices, everything held together by spicy seed-oils. Hop bitterness penetrates deeply but melts away with perfect timing, dissolving into a finish of beeswax and clover that absolutely fills the mouth. The rye element has just made things so, soooo smooth. Drinkability is off the fucking hook. I've had three bombers of this in my life, and I'm pretty sure not one of them has lasted much longer than ten minutes. Yum."
"Drinkability: A very well balanced and enjoyable beer. I could drink this all day. Strongly recommended."
"Taste is sweet and hoppy, well balanced. Notes of citrusy hops along with a bready malt taste. One of the finer double IPAs I have tasted. Very delicious, and smooth, and quite a warming up beer."
"Wow. I'm very impressed. Beautiful brown with ruby tones; when held to light shows ruby red with fine suspended sediment. Head is thin but resilient; upon swirling it is huge and fluffy with beautiful small bubbles and boy, does the smell come out! Floral and bitter hops, caramel, heady alcohol. The hops clear my sinuses. I taste mellow bitter hops and rye spiciness. Full body, rich smooth and spicy mouthfeel. Finish is long, bitter and dry, and very tasty. I just can't get enough. So full and rich. An extremely drinkable beer. I just can't get enough. I've only ever had two rye beers but judging from these two, I like rye in my beer a great deal. Also I love my hops and this scratches my itch. Yum."
"Overall impression: Definitely one of a kind - this is a great DIPA with a nice added twist from the rye. Definitely worth a try - it may become a staple!"
"Pours a dark rubyish brown with a substantial and dense tan head (settles at about 3/4""). Sticky sticky lacing. Smells malty sweet with nascent hops, caramel apples... The first sip: wow! didn't expect malt like that. There's an incredible balance here with the hops bringing up the back end, but that malt sweetness is right there up front. And mind you, it's not an out-of-place sweetness. The hops are definitely there, but I'm a bit surprised that they're not beating my palate up and down the block as the name and label description led me to believe. This is not a bad thing, though. If I can't quite accept the characterization of this beer as a hoppy monster, that still doesn't prevent me from enjoying it immensely. In the mouth this one is nice and chewy, with a full, creamy body. Damn if that 8% abv is not hidden better than those magical Iraqi wmds. All in all, even though I am more of a hop-head than anything, this brew is definitely one of the best DIPAs I've yet to come across. Superb."
"Great DIPA, I'd like to give it more on the taste, but there are just others I like better, more hop complexity. Certainly find this, though, if you can."
"Poured into a ½ liter stein, the hop rod is a nearly opaque near-copper with a large, rocky creamy head. The bouquet is dominated by bitter citrus peel but also has very light notes of floral pollen. Starts big and waxy and finished dry and crisp, though slightly alcoholic. The Rye Hop Rod Rye achieves a delicate balance; it is dry enough to beg for another sip, yet quenching enough to make each swallow satisfying. I would recommend this beer with a rare steak, perhaps prime-rib."
"Pours deep amber in color, nice tan head with no apparent lacing. Smell of this is a bit funky at first but seems to improve as the beer breathes. The beer has aromas of malt, alcohol, citrus fruit and sugar. The taste is extremely dry with a really nice hop punch. Nice grapefruit character from this beer, as well as a nice caramel flavor from the rye malt. Nice long, dry, tart finish. Definately a tasty, unique brew from Bear Republic."
"Since this is a season I will be going back to the store to stock up now."
"A great DIPA and a very unique one at that. Get some MF!"
"Pours a dark translucent brown with noticable sediment on the bottom. Huge frothy off-white head with a light, lasting lacing. Smells of spicy hops and slight alcohol with sharp rye accents. Taste is not overly hoppy at first but gets pretty damn hoppy with time...not overpowering...but appropriately so for a double IPA. Dark malts are present as is light alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and sticky, dry. Good to the last drop...I was satisfied."
"Hazy reddish brown color with a large light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Nice and juicy citrus hop aroma, and a grainy aspect which adds complexity to the beer. Taste was nice and hoppy all around, but there was also a nice balance, between light toasty malt, and a dry, chewy, rye side to this beer. Full mouthfeel. A very nice IIPA, the rye gives this a different feeling to it, and really hides the 8%."
"Another great double IPA."
"This is one great beer. Juicy and thick malt mouthfeel with a spicy rye/hop attack on the palate. The rye flavors almost lend a peppery presence to the flavor. Very flavorful, complex and enjoyable. This is the second beer that I have tried from Bear Republic and I am impressed. Check this beer out."
"Hoppy, tasty, nice."
"Overall, a very very good beer. My first from Bear Republic, and I have to say I'm impressed. I love all the flavors in this one. Just great."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, nice white head forms, plenty of lace, looks excellent. Rye really gives it a nice colour. Smell is floral hops, tempered by a hefty sweet malty base. Taste is sweet rich malts, caramel, huge hoppy floral middle, very clean bitter finish. Finish is dry, smooth, perfect carbonation, insanely good beer. Thanks DrJay!"
"I wish I had tried this beer sooner. Overall an excellent beer. I will definitely try it again, and reccomend it to others. World Class."
"I love the color of this beer. Ruby and brown with a creamy tan head. Excellent retention. Lots of hop bitterness in the aroma but the rye gives it a terrific sweetness. The flavor is amazing. Tons of hops, yet there is definitely some balance there with the malts as well. And the rye just gives it a sensational sweet flavor. The body is medium to full with a thick, creamy texture. Awesome! As delicious as it was, it didn't leave me craving for another one, but it certainly satisfied, and I wouldn't argue with someone if they put another one down in front of me. Unique, satifying, and delicious, this beer just about has it all. A must try!"
"Really a sensational brew here. Pours a deep, dark brown with thick, lasting head. You can really smell the sweet rye, and caramel notes as well. Taste is oh so smooth, with a very nice dark malt finish. A bit bubbly, but steadies out 5-10 minutes out of my 22 oz bomber. Another clear winner from Bear Republic..."
"Pours amber bordering on brown, with a small but tight head that sits there and floats like an oil spot on water and leaves superb lacing cemented to the entire interior of the glass. Bigass pungent hop aroma that lets you know exactly what you are getting into. Hop character here is totally off the hook. ""Dual overhead hop injection"" indeed. Extremely floral, piney, citric, and bitter, with the rye significantly adding to the spicy kick and only minimal sweetness from the malts. Rye and hop aftertaste lasts seemingly forever. Definitely a punch-in-the-head IPA, yet ridiculously drinkable considering its bitterness and alcohol. I was all ready to be freaked out by this one, and freaked out I was, but in a good way."
"Mouthfeel is full, bordering on syrupy, and drinkability is uncommonly good for a beer of this strength. A unique classic."
"Head is perfect with thick lacing. Dark Cherry color. It's already on the christmas list. Like most IPA's its quite hoppy but the key is they control it a bit and the rye edge is outstanding. The rye adds a bit of depth but it was an afterthought at best. The true heart of this beer is like any other IPA and DIPA its in the hop flavor and bitterness. This is amazingly hopped up but yet still has enough malt character to keep it somewhat in check. Apricot comes to mind, citrusy and plenty of hop oils to slicken things up. Surprisingly it finishes fairly clean although it was a bit oily. Every drink was enjoyable. Highly reccomend this beer."
"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in July 2005. Pours a one-finger head that rises a bit after the pour. Tan in color over a crystal clear brown liquid with ruby and blood red notes. Smells mild and clean citrus hoppy. Grapefruit pith and tangerine. Toasted grains. Tastes, whoa...gentle to start. Sweet with strong apricot and malt over a rising hop flavor and bitter. Lupulin is stronger than co-humulone for the hops and it's really mouthfeel creamy smooth. Caramel is found deep beneath, but there is also a malty zing that fights the hoppy grapefruit pith. Mouthfeel is md-thick and carbonation is mild (but stingy). What a really enhoyable beer...the alcohol ting in the aftertaste give me pause to ponder the flavors is this beer."
"There is really no reason to give this beer anything lower marked. It is quite outstanding."
"A good inspiration, but I bet that more could be done here -- JL's Hop Rod Ripped, anyone?"
"not my fav but a good bet."
"Overall very enjoyable. Will certainly try again. The rye works well to give the brew a little different character."
"Poured this rusty orange brew into the corresponding BR glass, and let it sit for a bit while I admired it's clear shine and creamy-yet bubbly head. Plus I had to wait out a unintentionally rough pour. All my nose picks up is hops. But that's a wonderful thing. Taste is a citrusy hop paradise that cools off at the last moment into a easy drinking sweetness. I don't have experience with rye as an ingredient in anything but bread, so I can only say this COULD be attributed to the 18% rye. In any case, this is a great one. Purchased at Nuggets, Davis, CA."
"Boy, am I glad my nearest pub started carrying Bear Republic! Hop Rod Rye on tap is fantastic in all aspects. I certainly won't let nearly two years go by before having another pint (or two) of Hop Rod."
"Nice clear body, very dark brown, much darker than you standard DIPA, if my memory serves me correctly. Head is fluffy and full, off-white with very good staying power. Egads, there is a lot of hops in the nose, intense, piney, alcohol laced hops. Taste is bold with hops from start to finish, never relenting. The rye adds a different graininess. This is a brash and brazen DIPA, wich I enjoy very much. Well carbonated, and good for sippin'."
"Pours a deep coppered tea color with a finger of head that falls to a very nice coating over the top. The nose is thick caramel sweetness with sweet citrusy hop. I really like the intensity of the caramel malt. The flavor is very big. Sweet caramel hits first followed by sweet juicy hops, finishing with a spicey rye. The bitterness is not too intesne, but lingers very well into the finish. Very enjoyable. The feel is incredibly thick and chewy, almost a touch syrupy. I dig it. Like some body on my DIPA's. 8% alcohol is nowhere to be found in this one. Its really doing good for me on this humid and rainy summer day. Big flavor and nose that leaves a great aftertaste. Nice beer here."
"quirk from the rye. I prefer the Racer 5 from Bear Republic, but this is damn good, too."
"I would probably be able to drink quite a bit of this, but at 8% I'm wary of labeling it as a sessionable brew, much less because this beer is not available in my locale. Thanks again, axisjones."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Ruby red in color with two fingers of beige head. Extremely strong resinous piney hops scent over a delicious molasses and rye bread malt. Big grapefruit hops assault the tongue upfront, giving way to a grainy rye maltiness, and fading into a wonderful linger piney hop aftertaste. Very full bodied and chewey, it almost feels like your eating rye bread. This is an amazing brew---the rye might make this the tasties double IPA I've ever sampled."
"Lingering sweet/bitter mix in the mouth. Very drinkable even though it is chewy as all hell. From the smell and the flavor, this could be a rye infused barleywine."
"Simply an outstanding brew - if this is your local, consider yourself lucky."
"Highly recommended...Gonna be picking up a couple more of these on my next trip."
"The body is big, make that huge. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and absolutely chewy. If this were sweeter and maltier, it would be a barleywine. As it is, it stands out amongst the crowd. A joy to drink, I savor every sip."
"The creamy off-white to orange head atop its deep, dark and cloudy copper-red body releases huge pine aroma. The first sip is fantastically ferocious. The rye adds a tangy and spicy flavor that's reminiscent of bourbon. This brew is very hoppy, with rye and a wee bit of malt (sweet toffee/caramel flavors are in here they're just a little shy and intimidated by the hops) to make this so complex. This stuff is super drinkable; I feel like I could finish a keg of this by myself- I'd sure like to try."
"Hazy, toffee/red colour topped by a thick, fluffy, off-tan head. Excellent retention and stickage that leaves a very thick lace on the glass. I could smell hops as soon as I started pouring the beer. Plenty of citrus and floral hop aroma, to the point of being perfumy due to quantity. Malt is in there as well, a little bready, with an almost gingerbread quality that also shows up in the flavour. Complex hop flavours that are in balance with each other and are absolutely amazing. Grapefruit hop flavour is present all the way through, with a bit of pine resin, some hop spice, and orange. Maltiness is slightly grainy and quite drying. Assertive bitterness, just short of aggressive, that balances very well with the malt. Long, dry, bitter finish. Full bodied with medium carbonation and a rich, creamy texture. This is really, really good beer. The combination of rye with the high hopping rate works very well."
"A heck of a nice effort here...unique....and loaded with flavor....quality stuff"
"Glorious hoppiness on the tongue, but a well balanced malty sweetness is there as well. Bitter, but not too bitter. Hoppy, but not too hoppy. Sweet, but....well, you get the point. Very well balanced. Some pine and citrus thrown in to boot. Not for the beginning hop head. I wouldn't have liked this 3 years ago. But now is a different story."
"Nice medium/light body, very drinkable indeed. The ABV encourages drinking and discourages gorging! Nice work."
"This beer pours an almost grayish brown color with a nice small head. Lots of hops aroma, grassy and citrusy. The taste is unique in that the hops way out in front but it still has some balance. The rye really gives the beer that dry base that accentuates the hop flavor. It tastes light in your mouth with a slight hop bitterness on the way down. As intense as this beer is, it is well crafted all around."
"D- This is a big hop monster with a great creaminess and nice spiciness from the rye. It is well balanced malt and rye that gives a backbone to the great hops. I'm glad this comes in a bomber cause a 12 oz would be to small."
"Kind of a shrug beer for me. It is a beer of almost and could a been. I have had several well done Rye beers and this one lacks the Rye punch and the hops seem mis-matched for the spicyness as they were fruity and bitter but not spicy. The alcohol also comes through a little to much. I let the bottle warm up more and the rye come out a little more but mostly it is just an after taste. The malty body is nice and thick though but a little too high on the carbonation. A decent Rye beer, but it almost could been better."
"Overall: Excellent dIPA in its own right, the rye just makes it even better."
"Finger licking good!"
"As the immortal Kinky Friedman would say"" Killer B baby"". This is one of the best beers I've had in some time mainly because the complexity is stunning. The beer looks awesome with a dark brown body with a bi old head. A hoppy, woody smell with some interesting age notes. The taste is large and many facets. A unique bitterness due to the rye comes off the back end. All in all this is a stunner that demands your attention."
"An interesting beer. Pours an amber brown color (a bit darker than most ipa's) with not much of a head. Smell is of fresh pine and grapefruit with a hint of sweet malts. Taste is definitely hop predominant (chinook hops more than likely) with a dry, somewhat harsh, astringest aftertaste. I'm assuming this is what rye contributes to the beer. Don't notice much of a spiciness or sour like characteristics. Overall seems more like a 'darker' ipa than anything else but nevertheless a quality product."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer has a dark brown appearance, unusual for an IPA. Big foamy white head that leaves loads of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, but not just a hop bomb. There are nice malt and spicy aromas too. The flavor is fresh hops, but balanced with the malt and a noticable rye. Very interesting, complex flavors. Creamy mouthfeel. High alcohol, but not in an overwhelming way, just gives the beer a nice bite. This is a well made and delicious hoppy beer. I think this is the fastest I ever drank an 8% abv 22 ounce bottle."
"A slick and seductive ""you want me but you can't quite have me"" mouthfeel teases for subsequent sips. It's as if the full flavor of this beer is always just out of reach."
"Hop Rod Rye has more hops than LeBron James. Slam dunk for Bear Republic."
"i've sometimes been adverse to crazy hops but the complexity here helps me to appreciate it."
"Pours a nice rich copper color with a fluffy light beige head. Piny, sprucy and citrusy in its hop profile with a caramelized malt notion and, of course, a dry rye character. Hints of holly. Incredibly dry, hoppy and citrusy. The usage of rye really accompanies the dryness imparted by the high alpha hops. Very dry and bitter; with some caramelized malt, counterbalancing rye, and a dextrinous mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. A beefy beer for lovers of the hop."
"I took the cap off of this one and my mouth was watering to get a taste of the hop juices that filled this bottle. The appearance was gorgeous. A deep amber color with a sticky, cream head. The head alone, was delicious. The smell was a little different than many other IIPA. The rye aroma really stuck out and gave a different nose to the prominent hops. The taste was started out with a little sweetness followed by the crucial hop bitterness. The finish brought back almost and orange sweetness followed by a dry ending. The hops suck out every drop of saliva you have left in your mouth. It is great, but would be a little too much all night. Either way, this is an awesome beer that could become a staple in my fridge."
"First sip reveals a rather thin body with a creamy texture that coats my palate. Very fine rolling carbonation tingles across the back of my throat. Flavor is light malt up front with a hint of caramel and some rye flavor, like reuben bread. Finishes slightly twangy with a hint of the hops that were on the nose. Mostly the hop bitterness hits the back of my moutgh after I swallow. The beer is easy to drink and gives no hint of alcohol anywhere. Quite an interesting mix of grains. Good but not a WOW! beer."
"Very nice amber to deep orange color. Second helping out of the bottle had a killer head to it. Great big grassy,citrusy aroma-we are talking full frontal hop assault. Nice mild sweet malt flavor with a huge hop presence. Very tangy indeed. Somewhat dry in the finsh. Good body-has a tad of a ""soapiness"" feel to it. A killer beer indeed. Very crisp yet full of flavor. At 8% I dont know if I would call it a session beer but I could see it becoming a regular in my fridge."
"for a powerful beer full of hop madness, this one is quite drinkable... and balanced, even though it is extreme."
"Taste: I was expecting some kind of freaky concoction with off-centered flavors and just too much of everything, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very well balanced ale, with everything in it's proper place, leaving room for everyone make a statement on my tastebuds. Rye tartness, big malt roundness, slight alcohol sting and hop finish. Bravo."
"Carbonation was spot on for the style and a medium to full bodied beer."
"Merci Martin!"
"Major thanks to blitheringidiot for giving me this gem."
"What a hop bomb. This beer shows all the things I love most about hoppy brews. The citrusfruit notion, the pine sap, the i-give-in sweetness at the finish. Rye and hops really combine for a great bitterness in a beer. It is genious. This is a favorite of mine."
"Perfection."
"The taste showed some raspberries and blueberries at first, and a second after a citric feeling. Then a more chewy wooden character, with a syrupy caramel flavor combined with a round and dark maltiness (rye I guess) that gets close to chocolate. I particularly enjoyed this hoppy west coast beer since I found it so well balanced with a real and deep malty personality. Mouthfeel was enjoyably creamy for a hop monster, and the thick mouth-drying experience was interestingly combined with refreshing and sweet notes of grain, in a slightly sticky syrupy way. I also find in surprizingly drinkable for the style. So much more balanced and interesting than Stone ruination (imho)."
"Beautiful rich mahogony with deep ruby highlights. Foamy off-white head and intricate lacing. Huge aroma. Floral and citric hops, roasted malts, almonds and light grassiness. Hop bomb! Taste is very earthy, huge grapefruit and resinous hops, roasted malts and a lingering, stinging, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick and full. This is a huge beer in every aspect. Bitterness can be a bit overwhelming by the end of the bomber, but if that is all you are planning to have it's pretty darn drinkable. Outstanding beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige/light tan head above the dark copper brew. Head is airy like bread as the bubbles burst, and laces very nicely. Aroma is hops, citrus, pine, you name it, it's here. Seems like there may be some malt under all of it, but the nose can't find it. Taste is mostly about the hops (see Aroma, above), but there is a body and smoothness over the tongue that defies you to just pigeonhole it as another bottle of hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent for the style, must be that rye making everything work out so well. Stop walking by this one on the shelf, take one home, and enjoy."
"Drinkability- Nicely well balanced beer. Was actually happy I didn't notice any rye as I despise rye with a passion. Tasty and well rounded. Would suggest to anyone who likes a good IPA."
"After trying DFH 90 & 120, Hop Rod, and the Devil, Hop Rod is the one that is going to be parked in my Garage Frig. Its crisp taste and beautiful full body is touched off with a nice flame job of hops. A like a true hotrod when you get her warmed up the good stuff comes on strong."
"This beer was a little too bitter anjd without the subtlety that I generally look for in a rye, not horrible though. Poured out of a bomber into two pint glasses and shared with a friend. The brew actually tasted better as it warmed, I'd recommend not keeping it too cold."
"Easy to drink session type of beer with 8.0 and a good change up for this type."
"The smell brings hops on top of a base of rye. In the taste, the rye dies down a little bit but really compliments the bitterness. The malt content tastes much lighter than the beer looks. There's no shortage of flavor here, but it's still pretty easy to drink."
"Clearish amber color with a nice head of 1/2 an inch. Laces fully with intricate patterns all over the glass. Smell was more muted than anticipated, hops dominate but there's a touch of graininess and almost a nut tone. Feels light to the tongue but with plenty of flavor presence and solidity. Slightly minty flavors, closest to spearmint, acidic with scouring resiny hops. The malts are interesting, combine with the hops to give a wood sense, but aromatic and biting, almost like cedar. Different, but for me, not incredibly easy to drink. Still, a challenging beer to pick up when the mood strikes."
"Never had a brew by this brewery before and I was definately impressed. I'd heard good things about this one. An amber on the darker side pours a brownish tawny red color with the foamy off-white head retaing for quite a while. Smells bitter and hoppy, with a sweetness rarely found in a west coast IPA. That's a good sign. It's east enough to get excited about the overly hopped west coast IPA monsters but I think the real gems are the ones that are more complex and balanced. This is one of those beers. The hops are bitter, not too in your face, all though fully a main asset to this beer. At the same time, it's not all this beer has to offer. The bitterness comes in waves and is accented my sweet mellow malts and a light bready character. As the beer warms it tends to get more spicy, bready, and herbal. Definate complexity in this beer. Such a refreshing beer from the west coast. Disconfirms my previously growing opinions that every brewery from the west coast is going to hop the shit out of beers and that's it. Much more attention here paid to detail and a great dry yet somehow creamy texture. I'll definately go back to this one. Hella sweet or something. Wicked. Whatever...."
"This poured into the glass a hazy brown color with a thick tan head. Definitely some residual yeast in this beer (It appears this is bottle conditioned). The head clings to the side of the glass a thick sheet of lace. The nose has a piney/floral hop character along with malt sweetness. The rye lends a nutty tang to the backbone of the aroma. The flavor has the rye nuttiness up front followed quickly by the hop flower. Explosions of pine accented my the rye. I think this may be more interesting in this bottle form than it is on tap. Oily mouth feel and a good drinkability. I was a little afraid to try this beer at first, now Im strangely drawn to this style. This is still the best, although the Easy Ryder I just had from CBC is a great beer too."
"Cool color. Like mahogany, but someone spilled motoroil on it, and wiped it up quick. Rusted froth, my-my-my it looks so sexy with lace dripping off all the curves of my imperial pint. Ooh, it's randy too! This runs on hop fumes, and has a sweet and spicy body. I believe this would be sensational without the heavy hop swaddling, but it is a hop rod."
"D-Excellent. Now here is a session IPA (or tastes like it anyway)--oh maybe not its 8% ABV. They sure do a good job of not allowing that 8% to be real noticeable."
"A nice seasonal ale from Bear Republic."
"Pours a dark brown colour, with a fluffy tan head, tremendous lacing. The aroma rushed out of the bottle. Floral, piney, juicy fruits, and just tonnes of hop flavour. The only way to describe this beer is that it's a hop monster. Initially, it's got such a fruity, juicy gummy bear kind of taste, but ends with a tremendous amout of hop bitterness. Just so much flavour packed into a bottle. One of my favourites."
"If you're a hop-head and you need a fix, this is a great brew for that. It's a bold, strong double IPA that delivers a big dose of the hop juice. It's quite tasty and I'm sure I'll be going back for another nip of rye shortly..."
"Drinkable- if not for the 8%, i could drink it all night."
"I like the flavors of the hops as this ale warms and becomes less carbonated as the dryer malt flavors become more apparant and it gets smoother. If you could get a cask conditioned version of this it would be very good."
"I'm pairing this hop monster with some bakery fresh rye bread right now, and it is goood. It would be good anyway, but mmmm. Pours richer and darker than most of its brethren, a deep mahogany with a sticky quarter-inch head. Aroma is pungent and powerful - resinous, piney hops and a musty rye maltiness along with a candy sweetness too. The aroma reminds me of Double Bastard as well. The hops are rich and bitter with some minor rye undertones. Medium bodied and the alcohol is hidden quite well. A good drinker...I'll polish this bomber off in no time!"
"I can't say enough good things about Bear Republic. Each and every beer is top-notch and is a marvel of the brewer's art. Hop Rod Rye is an intense, fantastically delicious DIPA and instantly leaps to within sight of the summit on my 'most favored beers of all-time' list. Wow!"
"this beer went perfectly with the NY Steak Sandwich at the Library Ale House."
"Had on tap at Anam Cara on new years eve. Dark brown body, no head. Smells of roasted barley, not much else. Tastes of roasted malt, followed by a chocolate-coffee fusion, and coffee aftertaste. Mild hops if you look for them. Mouthfeel is good, meduim body. Drinkability is good due to overall balance of flavors."
"The body of this beer is quite a bit darker than I'd imagined, completely brown practically with some hints of amber and red. The head is off white and sticky, fat globs of lace are spread about sporadically. The nose is explosive with hop aromas, pine, citrus (grapefruit), pineapple. The underlying malt was broken up a bit by the aroma of rye. The first thing I notice upon tasting is that the typically thick, sweet malt backing was softened up by the rye, gaining it a bit of complexity. The bitterness levels were aggressive througout with the finish being dominated by sharp spikes of those lovely hop flavors, pine, apricot, pineapple, grapefruit... The mouthfeel is perfect, soft with light carbonation, neither too slick or clingy. What a great beer, next time I see it I will be sure to stock up."
"Drinkability - abv is well-hidden. A well made beer in every respect and one to enjoy again."
"Deep reddish copper brew, pretty hazy and a sticky off-white head of medium-fine composition. Gorgeous West coast hopping regiment more than obvious. Big and resiny. Yum! A little bit of sweet malt shines through. Brash hop flavor an bitterness are apparent on first sip. Slight rye flavors are present , too, along with residual sweetness. Wow, this beer has a brass set. Real nice medium body, pretty light carbonation. Excellent."
"This is a rather good IPA. It pours a moderately dark amber color. The head was nice and foamy. The smell is delightfully hoppy. The taste is a pleasant mixture of hops and malts, with the hops nicely winning out. A very enjoyable beer. Definitely worth giving a try. Enjoy."
"Reflection: Hop junkies should be happy with this one, it has a great kick to it and its still very drinkable!"
"Really a unique and special ale. A great example of the creativity and talent of American craft brewers. A new favorite."
"Fresh out of the tap this beer is even better than out of the bottle. Still has the same brick-red body and creamy tan head. But the spicy, piny, resiny hop aromas are even more pronounced and appetizing. The caramally maltiness still holds its own though. Hop and malt flavor are also enhanced. I just love the spicy character throughout--even in the malty sweet beginning. I just wish I could get this on-tap more often."
"The excessive bitterness of the finish mellows a little as it warms, plus the malt charater increased simultaneously, but neither is enough to make this exceptional. I never really picked up on the rye qualties."
"My first beer from this brewery and it is a winner! I will look for more from these artists."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a tall and creamy head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is ... hops - citrus mostly. The flavor has a caramel malt backbone, but is dominated by the hop flavor. The rye gives it somewhat of a chewy, grainy feel. Interesting."
"A very unique color. I have called beers muddy and murky before (and likely will again) but this beer's appearance really defines those words. It also poured with an ever so slight head that never quite went away. The aroma is of rye bread (remember, rye?) and makes me want a pastrami sandwich. The flavor is hoppy, but sweet and not bitter. The rye aroma also come through in the taste and it makes me think I am chewing on a piece of rye bread. Very unique and different. The overall flavor is very rich and fragrant--it permeates all the way through the finish."
"Beer is good. Happy overly hopped 2IPA beering."
"Mouthfeel is nice...medium body and smooth velvet creaminess. Drinkability is awesome here...the alcohol is well hidden and it tastes so damn good. Easy to gulp and a great treat for the hophead in all of us. My advice is to find it and try it!"
"This is the darkest IPA I've ever seen. Is that good or bad? Creamy head strays left of white. This smells like hops. Tastes good. Very odd, I'll lend that to the rye. Hop flavor devastates this brew. The high ABV hide nicely behind all that flavors. I've been drinking this for a while now and will continue to."
"Taste is very hoppy to start but as it warms a little bit of carmel malt begins to show. Not as much rye in the flavor as I expected but this is the first rye beer I've tried. It's certainly there though. Very tasty beer. Wish it was available here."
"Pours a deep amber with a almost creamy-like head that leaves sheets of lace down the glass,the rye really comes thru in the aroma along with a dose of grapefruit these aromas melded very well together I already knew this was gonna be a hoppy brew before even tasting.Like a few of the others who reviewed this one the first few sips hit pretty hard with some bigtime bitterness but mellowed after awhile with that late rye touch making this very refreshing.Glad to get a chance to try this a very nice beer would love to have on tap again sometime."
"Mouthfeel is a little slick, but it has a lot of body, which it needs to stand-up to all of the flavors. Overall, this is a good beer, with a lot of complexity. The name is quite fitting. t's also probably only for those who like strong hop bitterness."
"Bottle. This is great. All the hallmarks of an American strong are there, lychee, pine and gapefruit. loads of hops. Dryer than most in its style. Nicely bitter finish, some burnt tea leaves, great balance. A quality beverage. Lots a hops, but it seems more interesting than most hopped up beers."
"Recommended."
"pours a very nice dark and crisp amber colour wuth a giant sticky tan head that looks creamy and inviting. it looks more like a turbo charged red ale than what i'd expect from a double ipa, but certainly no complaints, as it looks great all-around. the smell is a solid bread and rye with hop throughout. this one's a bit dirty and sweet smelling at times as well too. the flavour hits you with a surprising aount of malt and bitterness before moving into hops, dirt and tree bark and then some full on rye flavour at the finish. the hop burps are quite yummy with the rye taste mixed in. this one remains tasty throughout whilst not being overpowering, which is nice. another winner from bear republic, which seems to produce (in my eyes) a consistent string of very good brews, but can't move into the 'blow me away' range...yet."
"A great beer for the style, especially if you're a hophead. This is one of the better Double IPA's out there and it's unique as well. This is something that should be sought after."
"Drinkability is only limited by the ABV. A nice beer. I have a bottle of this as well and am curious to see how that will taste as compared to on tap."
"Drinkability is good but begs to be drunk withsome spicy food but still great on a stand alone basis."
"What balance for such a strong beer. Kudos to the folks at Bear Republic. I will definitely recommend this beer to others!"
"The aroma was primed with piney and citric juicy hops, bready rye malt, and perfumey alcohol. The taste was like buttered rye toast with a touch of honey dunked into tea made of hop leaves. The mouthfeel felt a bit thinner than the alcohol in the aroma first suggested. The aftertaste was peppery and dry, and left me longing for the next sip. This is a very well crafted beer that will be missed due to its local unavailability. But for now Ill pour me another glass."
"Hop Rod is brewed with 18% flaked rye and is a 'must taste' for self acclaimed hopheads"
"A delicious IIPA, I didn't really notice the rye flavor, but it's still very good. I like how Bear Republic crafts these very well balanced IPA's, it's nice to be able to drink something afterwards and still taste it."
"Had this nearly three years later, it was in my basement for half a year or so, Very bitter with some rye, but did not like it as much. Still very drinkable."
"Deep coppery red with off-white crema. Strong sweet piney scent. Rich and full bodied malt, with lots of resiny pine hops and lingering sweetness. Reminds me of Arrogant Bastard. Oh yeah, this is delicious stuff, but where's the rye?"
"Pours a nice dark amber with a very spacious, foamy eggshell head. Tons of retention and nice lacing. Smells quite citrusy with a nice amount of biscuit and lemon grass coming through. Tastes like a premium IPA should. Not a huge hop kick in the nuts, but a very balanced, strongly hopped beggining. This is followed by a slight malty reprieve, then turns back to grapefruit, lemon, and rye. Mouhtfeel is rather large and the body is moderately chewy. The alcohol is hitting me hard on this. Grand IPA."
"This dark reddish brown brew poured a nice head leaving a nice lacing down my 22 oz glass. Smell is wonderful, of glorius floral hops, grapefruit, and rye. Taste is excellent. I have paired this off with tortilla chips, con queso cheese sauce, and hot salsa. The high alcohol content is masked extremely well by a wonderful blend of rye, sweet malts, and a ton of hops. My tounge feels totally alive as a result of a more than generous share of hops. This is an extremely drinkable beer but as my credo goes, ""Beer will always be my friend as long as you don't abuse it""!"
"ng"
"Drinkability: A few of these will put you in your place. But the taste leaves you wanting more."
"After all the good beers I have had from Bear Republic I was excited and had high hopes for this one when I found it on the shelves. This came in the usual 22ozer from BR with a hop rod car on the label. This poured out a nice dark amber color with a good sized rocky beige head. Nice rings of lacing were left around the glass as I drank this. Aroma is full of hops as the name would suggest as well as a bready malt presence. I could also smell the rye distinctly after a few sips as it warmed which added nicely to the aroma. The taste opens up with light malt sweetness and hints of rye before the hop rod drives through your palette and deliver a good does of earthy hops and a nice bitter rye aftertaste. This beer is perfectly balanced, not overpowering in any aspect but not weak in any either. This has a nice medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Drinkability is very high and no sign of the alcohol can be detected. Fantastic beer from Bear Republic as usual and I highly recommend it to all."
"Maybe, the great things I'd heard about this bear had unreasonably bolstered my expectations but I found this RyePA to be a bit of a let down. It was bitter, acrid, and overly hopped. While there was a hint of rye in the aroma, and an undeniable rye component to the beers flavor. Overbearing, and uninteresting hop flavors dominated. Yes,. the hazy brown-amber brew looked excellent beneath a white, and somewhat lacy head. Unfortunately, I found little else within this bitter brew to garner my interest."
"Not a bad beer, in fact, it is a fantastic beer for it's style. The only area that I ha to give it below a 4 is drinkability, just because I really don't enjoy the rye beers as much as I probobly should, but to each his own, I guess."
"Very balanced, becuase while the flavors don't mix, the do combine and finish out nicely. Medium mouthfeel contributes to it's drinability."
"Pours with a two-finger bubbly white head that fades slowly leaving a ton of lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Medium carbonation. Starts crisp and finishes hoppy, very little malt sweetness. $4.60 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Arrived at the table looking mighty appetizing with its deep red glow, and creamy perfect head. Was greeted to a wonderful citrusy hop aroma and a slight rye character. Hops weren't overpowering like with their Racer X, but were definitely in the forefront. The taste is predominantly west coast hops but finishes with a semi-sweet rye note. Extremely balanced and drinkable. I really wanted another, but another 20 oz. pint would've done me in. Until next time.,,"
"22 ounce bottle."
"Probably the best rye beer I've had. A rye pale ale, for lack of a better term, with a good dry backing to the citrusy West Coast hops. I just hope that I'll be able to see Bear Republic beers in Western PA soon!"
"Somewhat of a murky, off-brown in color, appears liquidy, with a thin bubbly white head. Hops and some ginger and pine spices on the nose, very strong and intense, and call it inviting. A huge tongue to throat blast of hops, and a mild sweetness to it. Piney offerings as well as sharp grapefruit and fresh citrus notes. Some rye tastings are just enough to offset the massive hops; becomes a bit acidic and bitter, yet in a good way; some caramel malt notes towards the bottom of the glass. The balance seems to be pretty decent, a definitive hops based body, but is quickly backed by the noted tastings. Could easily pass as an APA in style, yet the rye/barley offerings place it in it's own class, and at the lead; seek and destroy!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, medium-full body, with wonderful carbonation. Another beer to quench the hop cravings, one will definately do the trick."
"The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected. It's a little silky. It's tasty. I don't know if I'll rush out to buy another but sometimes memory gets my feet to flappin' and there I go out for more."
"For one so strong..very nice and drinkable..I shall buy many more tommorrow!"
"This is an enormously satisfying brew. Rich, flavorful, complex, well-balanced--I can see why this is a favorite."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades. The aroma is great! It has a nice malty scent with an intense aroma of floral hops. The taste is great also. It has a rich and creamy dark malt flavor with a smooth bitter hop taste. The rye helps to mellow the hop flavor. It has a dry finish, but has good mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome beer. I love the dark amber color and great hop characteristics. This is a good drinker."
"Dangerous drinkability with that alcohol volume. Simultaneously thirst quenching and inducing. This is why the bomber sized bottle exists. Kick ass label design, too. I really dig this beer, I could drink it any day."
"Appearance is a dull hazy brown, with a rich golden honey tint. Head is small, but thick and foamy. Lace is small and, well, lacy. Smell is fairly subtle. You can find the rye/grains and a kind of honey sweetness too. The yeast is also present. Theres a slight spiciness and fruitiness also. The taste is light and pleasant, and as this is my first rye beer, I do say that I like it. It's got a bit of eatrhy sweetness and grainy flavors too, with a bitterness definately from something other than hops. Mouthfeel is medium in body, but it is very low in carbonation. It would be great if it had just a tiny bit more carbonation. All in all, it's definately a good beer, that I would love to have again"
"In a blind tasting, this would consistently be called a Barleywine/Old Ale. In fact, this tastes very similar to Kzoo Old Ale, Kzoo Batch 6000, Stone Old Gaurdian, Hog Heaven etc. Good brew, but I would much rather drink their Black Bear Stout:)"
"This is one you simply have to try if you haven't allready.Had a 20 oz draft. When served just a perfect frothy head with excellant retention. A beautiful ruby brown color. Aroma is all hops with a light piney aroma.Lots of hop flavor but balanced well as a roasted rye flavor is not hidden. Smooth and creamlike on the tongue with a carbonation level that is right on. Could probably have several of these but the higher A.B.V. would be tough to handle unless just staying at home."
"Notes: I enjoyed this very much. If you love hops, this is a must. You could sum it up by saying this has a ""roasted hop"" flavor. And about the lacing; the rings are nice and even, but thats about it."
"A nice strong brew! Not for those who do not like a super hopped brew. A beer that will be added to my regular beer rotation."
"I hope I will be able to sell this soon."
"One more thing  I felt virtually no effect from the alcohol. Strange."
"Bomber bottle, no freshness dating. Pours very dark almond and cloudy. Hardy aroma of hops, rye, spice. Great creamy head, tiny bubbles. Major league lace. Hops, wonderful hops. Rye flavor present, but not over powering. This is the real deal , hop lovers rejoice! Great creamy mouthfeel. Hop burps and everything. Thanks Bear republic for this big, bold and lovely creation."
"cheers"
"a very drinkable offering."
"Bear Repuiblic does it again! A super creamy head..murky brown eye candy! A definite lemon hop presence wafts the nostrils...continuing into the taste which is initially very hop intensive, but mellows toward the finish....which leaves you wanting more. If you realize that this brew is hop intensive and a sipper, then drinkability is fine...high abv further suggests ""sipping"". The mouthfeel was great...with a soft dryness throughout."
"It is a caramel bronze color with a light tan head. The aroma is amazing. There is a lot of hops reminds me of noble hops though I doubt any are used and they is some pininess as well. The spicy rye and caramel is also in the nose. The smooth medium body goes down too easy. There is some caramel sweetness and some juicy hops. The pleasant bitter finish lingers. A very good rye ale that is spicy and grainy with a good resiny hoppiness."
"I like this beer. I like this beer a lot, but only hopheads need apply. I am left wondering though: what contribution does the rye bring? I will definitely try Bear Republic's other offerings even if Red Rocket makes me think of a male dog's naughty bits."
"I think this beer is awesome. It is the type of brew I would want to replicate if I home brewed. Very Hoppy makes me Very Happy."
"Amazing retention and lacing on top a deep amber body. Smells of fruity herbage and twang. Some chocolate. Taste has the malt body of arrogant bastard but with rye, as well as some fugglish and porterish notes. Light carbonation, dry finish, alcohol not perceptable. While no doubt well-made, it is overall a ""whatever"" beer for me. The boring yeast kills the chance at complexity, and nothing about it really makes me want to have another."
"Pours a deep, clear mahogany color with a medium colored creamy head. The head is considerably sticky, and eventually retreats to a thin film. Theres an intense, strong hop aroma. The assertive hoppiness gets in the way of the other aromas, but underneath theres a malty, grainy smell. Its resinous, pine-like, peppery, sticky, medium bodied, and very bitter. The bitterness runs throughout the entire taste, and creeps from the back of your tongue to fill your entire mouth. I have trouble discerning the ryetheres a bready, grain-like backbone, but its not as intense as a lot of rye beers. The finish is hoppy, peppery, and bitter. Alcohol can be sensed through warming, but is well hidden in the taste. This ones aggressive, no-nonsense beer. Its a lot of fun to drink, and Id look for it again."
"It's everything I remember. Fantastic lacing by the sticky white lace. Color is a vibrant copper. All sorts of hops wreck your nose, with an iced tea character at the end. Flavor is more of the same...all hops. I didn't note the toffee sweetness this time. Still very creamy smooth and very drinkable. ABV is again hidden on this bad boy. Excellent."
"As you can tell, I really do love it."
"This is a top notch brew from start to finnish. This is also my first Rye beer and hopefully not my last. It poured a great copper color with a frothy head that left quicky but it's lace stayed behind till till the last drop. The scent of grapefruit and hops were very up front and just made me want to drink this beer even more. The flavor was great with a generous dose of hops and a nice citrus-y sweetness. I also detected a peppery flavor once the beer warmed a bit, maybe due to the rye. This beer was a joy to drink and I will be picking up more soon."
"It had a red-amber body, with a lumpy tan head. No flames or pinstripes were seen. The aroma was grapefruit, malt, and rye. A 5-speed taste tranny, with grapefruit, chocolate, caramel, rye, and pepper smoothly shifting the gears. The mouthfeel was thin and smooth, with small, light carbonation. Nice lace sheeting, too. It finished up the 1/4 mile with grapefruit, lemon peel, cardboard, and leather (rich Corinthian?) Great mileage/drinkability from this well-balanced brew. 0% financing available from your local beer store..."
"I could drink a keg of this by myself. Don't believe me? Let's bet, come on, try me."
"All in all, this is a rock solid brew."
"the first time i had this i knew i had to go get another and the second was the same way. very tasty, drinkable and special brew."
"I have tried this beer right out of the fridge and have let it warm a bit and it is great either way. This is one of my favorites and I can't get enough of this brew."
"Start your engines! Hop Rod Rye was served from a 22 oz. bomber. In a pint glass, the beer was a wonderous and brilliant ruby-orange, with a creamy tan head that left sticky and thick lacing. The ""in your face"" nose had a firm and grainy malt profile, with a super-charged volatile hop bouquet I imagined distorting the air above the glass. The taste reflected the nose, starting with a robust dry nutty roasted malt backbone wrapped up in a superbly monstrous bitter finish that got the blood pumping. A touch a sweetness at the end rounded out this finely tuned package, and left me captivated and completely satisfied. The full and muscular body matched the full flavor spot on. Considering the mega-hopped up flavor, this beer drank suprisingly well. I am very happy to find Hop Rod Rye making a home in Portland. Put your bets on this one, its a winner!"
"I had this as a last brew because I knew I wouldn't be able to taste anything else afterwards. The pour was copper red, and, right away, from arms length, I could smell the hops. The taste is an intense slap of that trademark west-coast hoppiness, with a malt sweetness that gives way to a dry hop aftertaste that lingers, with a bone-dry finish that feels as though the rye had come to lay the hopped wasteland of my tastebuds out to dry. Mouthfeel is rich, intense. I really could drink this all night regardless of the ABV, just worshipping at the altar of the hop."
"22 oz bottle pours out a clear, copper/red color with a thick beige head that retains well before fading into patchy sheet lacing. Aroma is a complexity of rye bread and westcoast hop notes of pine and sour citrus. Pears are noted in the background. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, as hops pour all over the palate. Taste is very highly hopped, but the rye and roasted grain flavors blend exceptionally well. This is really an extraordinary beverage! The rye bread flavor is a very hardy backbone for the orangerind and pine hop flavors that weave in and out, and all around this flavorful brew. Very chewy, and tastes like liquid food at times. Floral and fruity notes jump around the flavor profile as well. This is one of the finest ales I've sampled in quite some time. Complex and full of flavor, this is one kickass beer. A beautiful work of art that satisfies in all respects. Highly recommended!"
"Another trip to Half Time Beverages in Poughkeepsie and a whole new slew of beers to review. First the Hop Rod Rye, which poured a luscious deep and clear mahogony from the 22 oz. bomber, bearing (pardon the pun) a quintessential Healdsburg hot rod on the label. To top it off there was a thick pearl-white head that receded slowly into a lovely and sticky lace. The folks in Sonoma are not prevaricating--the hops are front and center in the aroma, but still balanced with an overlay of malts (is this the rye?). Yes, I think so, and perhaps that's the reason for the slight smoky tinge in the taste. Oh, the hops are still most evident, but the Bear Republic brewers manage to get in a coal or two somewhere in the process (though not as prevalent here as in the Red Rocket). The mouthfeel is creamy and bubbly. I like this stuff."
"Bronze body with a sticky off-white head. Aroma is very hoppy, enough hops that I couldn't take notice of any rye at all. Sweat, wood, pencil fragments, floral. The taste initially consists of a medium caramel sweetness, fading malts. Hoppiness is huge, intense. Finish isheavily bitter, dry, very long, woody, piney. Creamy medium body. Powerful west-coast style to which you add peaks of originality and that's the result. Thanks John"
"A very nice spicy,hoppy beer from the West Coast. This one is a dark copper color with a nice tan foam. Very fresh hop aroma with a mix of both floral and citrus smells. Body is medium/full with a very spicy, complex flavor profile with toast,rye bread,smoke, and caramel malts rolling with the hop flavors. A very easy to drink hybrid IPA with lots of flavors to challenge the tastebuds."
"Poured for me from the tap and filled nearly to the top without much head, which is something I don't like, but this one has good head retention so it's not so bad. A reddish mahogany beer with a whitish head. Lots of lace is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma features generous ""west coast"" hopping of a pine cone character and also more than a hint of citrus. Rye is noticeable along with the malt in the backbone. Smooth in the mouth, even a bit creamy. Maltiness at the very front of a rye grain character, followed very soon by a big piney hop bite, and then filled out with a big backbone of rye character. Hints of citrus all around. Bitterness comes out on top at the end for a crisp, dry finish. Excellent beer, my favorite from this brewery, although I actually prefer the bottled version of this one. Makes sense though, it is bottle conditioned, unless my memory is playing tricks. Highly recommended."
"Very dark amber-brown apperance with a sweet smell. Smells sweet with the hops coming through. Feels amazing in your mouth with a malty smooth taste and unbelievable hops overpowering the tastebuds. Also taste spices and rye throughout the beer. Overall an amazing beer that I will likely have to try again soon."
"A little rough edged, I couldn't drink it too often, but it's an interesting brew."
"Pours out a deep mahogony color with a nice healthy off white head and tons of yeast floating around in there. A smell reveals a hefty caramel maltiness with a strong hop presence in the background. Taste is fairly sweet for a beer named ""Hop Rod."" There are no doubt some bittering floral hops in there, but a sweet maltiness rules this ale. Great malts & great hops. My friend just mentioned ""This is really good."" He's right. Nice slick mouthfeel and immensley drinkable. This borderlines on the perfect strong session ale."
"As with all the Bear Republic beer's I have had this one followed suit with an incredibly rocky, fluffy and thick head and rendered the appropriate full lacing on my glass from top to bottom. Nice deep mahogony color with plenty of particles of unfiltered hops and yeast. The nose was of firm and fresh hops and a hint of rye. Taste was great with the hop slam hitting you with all the usual suspects, pine, citrus and a grapefruit rind biting finish. Nice malt backbone to hold up to the hops . Awesome."
"Stunning soft creamy bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Bear Republic really, really nailed the mouthfeel on this one. Quite drinkable for an 8% brew. Highly recommended."
"Fresh ""spring morning like grassy nose"" with a little pine tree as well. Cherry/peach color with a huge lasting pale pink fluffy airy head... what retention.. stiff peaks. Big hoppy piney, chewy, grapefruit taste with a malty rye bread backbone. The finish really brings out the bready rye notes in the beer which helps to try and balence the brutal hop punishment on the tongue. Medium to fuller chewy coating mouthfeel. The next time I get to the west coast.... I will be seek these out with a vengance... my kind of beer. Makes a cornbeef special look like babyfood. A hop monster with unique craftmanship..."
"22oz bomber pours a beautiful dark ruby with a white head. Lots of fresh, fresh hops in the aroma. Thick mouthful with moderate carbonation is very pleasing. Taste is a balance of big hops and big malt. Hops, as in the aroma, are very fresh. While my first few sips were smooth, the hops began to take on a bit of a harsh quality. Not sure how much of this could be the rye, though. Only the drinkability suffers as a result. Finishes with long lasting hoppy goodness, but a little too dry. No indications taste-wise of the abv."
"This BR brew pours out a dark reddish/ruddy, rusty brown colour with a nice tan/beige head of foam. The aromas are of sweet and roasted malts, citrus-y, piney hops and alcohol spinged spiciness. The taste lives up to the hype with a big, bolshy, excellent malty backbone for truckloads of hops to play upon. This brew has a lovely fresh cut hop finish, and an after-taste that will not only give you hop burps, but excellent, malty hop burps. The mouthfeel is thick, but not cloying or over the top and the drinkabiity is excellent for an ale of this size. 8%ABV, wow you could have fooled me. An interesting and excellent brew from BR"
"Spicy maltiness that I imagine is attributable to the rye. An elegant light sweetness."
"I could drink gallons of this stuff even with the high abv."
"This is my first taste of a Bear Republic Ale. I will be trying more. The head was marvelously thick almost merienge. Looking thru the glass the ale is a dark amber not quite pristinely clear. The aroma has a great hop floral boquet. A good hop sweetness a the begining of the mouthful and a good hop bite on the swallow."
"This beer is moderately drinkable and full of flavor. Hopheads will find it tasty and Maltmen will appreciate the balanced flavor."
"A great bif IPA, with a sour rye twang that takes it someplace very tasty. Loads of sweetness, & a hoppy finish loaded with pine & grapefruit. Medium bodied, farily brisk carbonation. Highly unique, and quite delicious."
" You start off with a blend of citrus and floral flavors that is pretty intense, but not overpowering. It gets a touch of sweetness to balance. It then gets a little toasty, but it doesn't seem to have as much rye character as others. It is all about the hops here. The body is pretty full, and it is smooth all the way down. The 8% is hidden extremely well. It is easy to drink, and even though it is on the thicker side, it doesn't seem like it after a pint. This is a marvelous brew."
"Overall just another great beer from Bear Republic, even if it does taste an awful lot like Sierra Nevada Celebration."
"Update  Cvschaller brought an 04 vintage over to my place for a pizza party. I really do love this ADIPA. Its a unique and fully satisfying take on the style."
"Medium white head, mostly lasting. Clowdy orange-red hue. The aroma was mostly of the bittering hops with some sweetness coming through. Sweet beginning taste with the huge hop flavor coming through in the middle and at the end in a big way... Detect a small grapefruit flavor on the palate as it lingered in my mouth. Light to Medium bodied with a dry texture and lively carbonation. Wonderfully hoppy IPA style -- hopped to the extremes."
"Wow, this rocked in the bottle. I think I liked it even better than when I had it on tap. Pours a nice dark copper, with a very creamy head. Left sheets of lace throughout my glass. The aroma has to have been the piniest seeming beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. What I noticed is nice carbonation, actually a real tongue tingler (go ahead, just stick your tongue into the glass). It's almost all hops, but it's riding on a smooth malt base. Great palate cleanser. I liked this one! pat"
"Dark copper body topped by a thick tan head. A few ""floaties"" in the beer, but not too much. Sweet hoppy aroma, simialr to Stone Ipa or Two Hearted ale. The sweetness is more of a floral aroma. Overall very clean smell. The taste is very crisp. Nice malt backbone, strong bitterness, and sweetness from the malt, alcohol, and a little bit of resiny hop sweetness. Then that rye aftertaste blends very well with the residual hop bitterness. Hop burps start almost immediately. The mouthfeel is solid, very smooth yet not overpowering. Drinkability is very good for a 8% ABV brew. Goes down pretty easily. No need to share this bomber. Another very fine beer from bear Republic."
"I sampled my first bottle of Hop Rod Rye purchased on the East Coast (MA) this weekend, from a 22 oz bomber. Appearance is a nice deep amber with flashes of garnet. Aroma is robutly hoppy, but blended with waves of rye malt and a little grapefruity sweetness. Taste is sharply hoppy at first but is very mellowed immediately with very smooth malt and has a very nice dry finish. Leaves just little bit of lingering hop tang in you mouth at the finish...."
"Notes: This would be severly unbalanced without the rye, but I don't think balance is what BR was aiming for here. Great beer, possibly the most hopped I've ever had."
"It pours an old worn leather with a solid beige head and loads of lace. A strong floral hop aroma dominates while strong smells of rye crackers and whiff of alcohol creep up. This potent brew is just bursting with unrestrained flavors. Wild malt (6 row?) and edgy rye flavors are completely separate from sharp grapefruit, zesty orange peel, light lemon and a hint of metallic tanginess. A touch of toffee sweetness does little to counter sharp flavors, but that's ok. All of these sharp edged flavors are accompanied by a constantly noticeable alcohol kick. This beer is unrelenting in its wild character and never mellows or sweetens further, even when it warms. I love this stuff!"
"Pours a deep mahogany, with a huge tan head that lasts, lacing very nicely. Aroma is big fresh hoppiness, slight smokiness, and maybe a hint of rye in the back. Flavor has a tinge of smoke, an even smaller tinge of rye, and a huge wallopping hop attack, very bitter, a little spicey, and lingering on just about forever. Medium to full bodied, lightl hints of alcohol on the 2nd half of the bottle. A tasty and large brew (maybe a RyePA?)."
"This beer poured a hazy, red copper color with white foam that settled but left a thin head that coated the glass. The smell was very hoppy: grassy, fruity hops. There was also some malt aroma. The taste was very hoppy (grassy green hops and also floral hops) with a nice balance of sweet malt. There was a hint of oak in the finish. Not much rye flavor could be discerned. The mouthfeel was dry, smooth, and hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The hoppy flavors lingered in the aftertaste. This was a very nice and enjoyable beer -- pretty much an IPA."
"By far one of the best west coast beers I have had to date."
"Kind of reminded me of a tame Arrogant Bastard? (I think that might be an oxy-moron?) Much more smooth with a creamyier, smoother mouthfeel. I would have this again anytime. I would also love to try the bottle version."
"I thought the color was an amber, but folks seem to see this one in different ways."
"Appearance: This one pours a copper ruby tone with something floating inside could be yeast could be hop particles and forms a decent thicket of cream toned head with brilliant patches of lacing spread thick and evenly. Aroma: The combonation of piney and floral hops blended with the rye are such a great combonation here, this is one of those classic beers buttery hops in your face but not over done what a great scent I would buy soap that smells like this if it was available. Taste: So much hop flavor yet not too much bitterness it's like they added hop extract or something to make the perfect blend of pine, this isn't all hops the malts make an appearance here they act as sweetened butter coated on lucious steamed hop buds with the rye here to accent all of the flavors this is by far the best rye beer I have ever tasted b/c they didn't try to make the rye the dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body but the smoothness of this beer going down is impeccable perfect amount of carbonation so easy drinking this one deserves awarded across the board. There is no hype behind this beer and by the quality and great flavor of this beer I am sure that the rest of the Bear Republic lineup in my fridge is going to be just as prosperous. A 22oz. bottle of this goes down effortlessly if this ever made in a keg to the east coast it would be first in line for my newly converted kegerator, awesome brew a hop suspension is going on with specks of hops floating but oh the joy that comes from sampling this beer, thank you to whoever brewed this fine nectar for the beer gods of blessed thee."
"I am not as fond of hoppy beers as I used to be. I will try to be objective. I have decided that these strong hop beers overpower any other flavors that might be evident. This beer looks as good as any beer you will ever see. Pours beautiful 1"" head the nicest lace you will ever see. Clear dark bronze/copper color. This beer is hoppy. Either pale or India pale ale. I am ignoring the rye ingredient. Very strong hops some malt slips through. Leaves a velvetty mouth feel. Alcohol is not noticable until you drink this 22 oz bottle. Two Hearted Ale(Kalamazoo/Bell's) is the only one of this class I would rate higher. A fine beer."
"A deep amber color, with a cream-tan head. This beer is quite clear from the get go. It has a spicy hoppy aroma to it with notes of lychee and grapefruit. The first thought after taking a sip was that this beer is redolent of a hop syrup. This is all about the American hops. As for the rye, maybe there is a certain fullness/ silkiness fro the rye, but it is not all that evident, the hops overpower any taste that one might get from the rye character as well. This beer is big bodied though, and it is pretty good."
"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep brown color with 2 fingers of head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of rye, caramel, and hops. A nice full aroma. The taste starts with roasted malt and rye, fairly sweet and good, even though I'm not a huge rye fan. It's surely a lot better in beer than in bread. The finish is big and full of bitter hops, a very nice balance. The mouthfeel is very strong and heavy. The drinkability is also fairly nice for 8%. A very unique and nice brew."
"($5.39 / 22 oz.)"
"I knew this was gonna be a stellar brew as soon as I cracked it open. Familiar PNW hops citrus and pine wafted up in the air but there was also a spicy sweetness, like somebody just took fresh-baked gingerbread cookies from the oven. If you're expecting a wildly different brew you might be disappointed. At its heart, HRR is an IPA...albeit one with a twist. It pours a deep mahogany with a sticky beige head that lasts throughout consumption. I can't help but draw comparisons, and this brew is reminiscent of yet another outstanding beer...Great Divide's Hibernation Ale. Citric, piney hops are assertive in the taste yet there is a mountain of dark crystal malt providing balance. There is a slight spicy-sweet crackle in the finish...again, like sweet gingerbread. It's not too much to be cloying, but just enough to add some welcomed complexity to yet another IPA. This is easily my favorite brew of Bear Republic's respectable lineup."
"Thanks to the ""Big Dog"" xlperro for the bottle!"
"One sip fills the mouth with a very nicely stacked malt profile with a light grainy flavor from the rye. Malt body compliments the bitterness very well, and the beer drinks quite easily considering its somewhat aggressive build."
"It drinks well and is enjoyable for what this ale is. Just do not expect a real different flavor because the word ""Rye"" is in the name."
"Overall Impression: A bit disappointed. Good beer, but I'd like to actually be able to taste the rye. Sorry... the non-hophead strikes again."
"This was a great beer. Very hoppy and very refreshing. Even though the flavor was not too complex, there was a depth to it that a lot of bitter brews don't have. I only wish that I could get it locally so I could drink it regularly. Twenty-two ounces was not even close to being enough."
"Dark Red color, medium head. A full bodied BIG ale, made with a ""truckload&amp"" of hops and 18% rye malts. Very malty and spicy. Full flavored. Complex taste. Malts and rye and over hopping combine to form a complex flavored beer. Smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Alcohol content is 8% but is not that noticable."
"This is one of those great ales that I find extremely satisfying. Reminds me of Rogues Brutal Bitter with the addition of Rye. Beautiful looking ale, dark and cloudy with a huge frothy head which completely laces every inch of the glass. I found this to be the case with every ale I've had so far from this brewery. Nice aroma of hops and malt, very rich. Full bodied and smooth with some bitterness. All around fantastic ale and one I'll look forward to again."
"Another beer that fits firmly into the category of American IPA. Strong smell of citrus hops, quite hoppy, with a somewhat thin but oily body. I have had numerous beers now that fit this profile. Not much in common with English IPA's. This beer has a wonderful appearance, thick foamy head, dark amber color. Significant rings of lace, which stick firmly to glass. Great citrus aroma, the taste is there, but a little overpowered by the hop bitterness. This one ranks similar to the Rogue IPA in that regard. I still feel that Two Hearted acheives the best balance in this category. Still, this is an excellent beer, and certainly one all ""hop-heads"" will embrace."
"The one thing I find strange about the beers from Bear Republic is that I prefer them from the bottle. I have been to the brewery numerous time for lunch and brew and without fail the beers are always headless. Oh well, I might be making too much out of nothing. This bottled sample dusts the pint I had at the pub and it was right from a fresh batch. Deep amber, thick head, and rings of lacing. Sharp hoppy taste with the right amount of Rye. A very drinkable, exceptional, beer that is chock full of flavor and character. Bear Republic!!!!"
"Originally sampled on 8 May 2002. The rye makes this IPA unique. A light bodied medium brown color, w/ a great hoppy/rye taste. Bear Republic has done a very good job at taking an IPA and adding a slight twist to it w/ the rye & it works out quite well."
"Sweet, creamy, malty nose shows some raisin and promises hops. The front is dark, kind of bittersweet. Lots and lots of delicious hops in the middle, with a little tea, a little cream, a little grapiness. Some of the fruitiness survives in the hoptacular finish. Fantastic grapefruit rind burps. What a great, great beer. Hugely hoppy bitter, with some balancing sweetness."
"I have never had a rye ale with quite the punch of this one. Usually they resemble a more rounded mellow wheat brew. This one, however kicks the asses of all those others. Pours a heavy brick red with a thick foamy off-white head. Absolutely HUGE earthy hop aroma with just an edge of sweet malt. Initial spicy hops flood the senses paired with a malt that makes it best attempt to catch up but never quite makes it. The alcohol warmth sits in the back seat like the malt, but is there nonetheless. An earthy, grassy rye flush powers the flavors through a lingering finish"
"Another great one from the Bear!"
"Yet another fine ale from Bear Republic."
"536"
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It is also hard to believe that it kicks in a 8% alcohol. A nice beer for a change of pace, and I give it extra points for breaking the mold and using rye."
"22 oz bomber. Poured a dark garnet in color with a light tan head. The head levels to about a 1/4 inch, but remains throughout consumption. Aroma has a pleasant citrusy smell to it, akin to grapefruit. Hops dominate the nose. There's also a feint caramel sweetness that underlines the hop aroma. It's there if you search for it. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Hop Rod Rye goes down so easily. The taste is a complex and layered offering. Again, hops dominate the initial impression with flavors of pine and citrus combining for a pleasant bitterness. Typical Northwest hop flavor pulls through in the profile. The beer finishes with a superb rye flavor, that rounds things out nicely. I feel that the final rye statement really makes this beer that much more unique. Oh, and the 8.0% alcohol is masked so very well that you never notice it... until later."
"If you're a rye loving hop-head this beer could be the ultimate."
"This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed a foamy off white head that left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. It has an aroma of malt, caramel and hops. A flavor of malt and hops with a sweetness of caramel. Really can only detect the rye in the finish, which has a medium body to it."
"Poured a glowing amber-bronze. Big aroma of very sweet cascades hops. Since rye bread is strongly flavored, and this is my first beer with a substantial rye percentage, I expected it to be likewise strongly flavored and probably a little harsh. I was utterly delighted to find that the beer is exceptionally smooth. The flavor profile reminded me of SN Celebration Ale. I was impressed by the hopping - big and flavorful, yet, for all the hops horsepower, the finish was mild with no hops burn or bite. A top-notch brew."
"Ive only had 3 or 4 other rye beers, and none were brewed to this gravity, so its hard for me to comprehend if the harshness is being contributed by the rye, or if this beer is simply assertively hopped. Heres the bottom line: it tastes to me like Hop Rod Rye had a single addition of LOTS of American hops at the beginning of a 90 minute boil, and there they sat: losing most their flavor and aroma, while the whole time, more and more bitterness was extracted. At the same time, the liberal use of crystal malts created an interplay that I frequently find in big, American ales: harsh bitter. Im just guessing, so I dont know what really happened. I know Im wrong about the hopping schedule, because theres a good shot of citrus in the nose and I know I can taste some flowery hops underneath the other flavors. Plus, my burps reveal a wonderful hop character that I missed going down. This beer just exhibits a character that I taste too often in American, specifically west coast (Rogue and SN to be really specific) hyper-hopped beer: harsh bitterness. Having tasted 90 Minute IPA and Ruination, I know its possible to make a beer with over 100 IBUs taste extraordinarily hoppy and not be painfully bitter. In fact, those beers are two of my favorite all time brews. Oh well, they cant all get 4.5+ scores. Id rather have MANY other beers over this one. I guess Im kinda bored with tasting hyper-hopped beers that are extraordinarily bitter, but display very little hop flavor. Onward and upward"
"Hop Rod Rye is a must try and I'll highly recommend it to any BA."
"This is a phenomenal beer. Definitely in my top ten."
"This one turns on its radar detector and speeds down Highway Esophagus with reckless abandon."
"The color of an old penny, but brighter. The off-white head is easy and lingering, laces teh glass nicely. The flavor is hops first, slightly juniper-like. That is followed by a slightly sweet, slight chewy malt. The rye comes through most at the end. The malt is really earthy, dark and warm. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy. The other rye PA I've had is the Terrapin. Where Terrapin is bright and aggressive, this is warm, inviting and relaxed."
"Dark amber in color with a slight chill haze and a silky, diaphanous head. A bit of chunky yeast hop sediment is hard to keep out of the glass. The aroma is sinus-clearing -- very fresh hop aroma, undergirded by a bit of toffee/caramel malt. These mild malt notes start off the flavor as well, but it's not long before the palate is overwhelmed by a huge blast of hop oil. The rye lends a lightly bready flavor to the beer which helps smooth the flavor out on the way to what is acually a very balanced finish -- ever so slightly dry, with nice spicy and piney notes which linger into the aftertaste. A terrific beer for hopheads, with a body that is oily, moderately carbonated, and fairly full for the style."
"The beer as it sets in the glass is a beautiful deep translucent ruby red with a ponderous head and the resultant lace is diaphanous and clings longingly to the glass. Aroma of the hop flowers dominate the nose along with the sweet Rye grain, malts and some caramel tones underlie it all, clean and fresh and quite a sniffer for the old proboscis. Start is lightly sweet the top middling in mouth feel, then you hit the finish POW right in the taste buds, Hops, tons and tons, a Hop Heads dream, and is definitely not meant for the ""Weak of Palate""! I love it, and the moderate carbonation and hop bitter and dry aftertaste, seal off a great beer"
"[PS - If you're totally out of HRR. Anderson Valley's Hop 'Ottin or Belk's ESB might help with your withdrawl symptoms]"
"Dark orange-copper color, strong pine and citrus hop aroma, creamy full mouthfeel, piney reseiny on the tongue a great hop bite, nice malt balance alot like Schlafly ESB with more hops, I love it, a great one."
"Wow. I would be buying this alot if i could get it in ct. (beer trade anyone?). Clear amber color with a small but evenly carbonated head. Besides the hops a piney and burnt malt aroma is very noticeable. On second pour from the bomber the large chunky hop sediment sneaks into the glass quickly. A creamy toffee like flavor balances the ""truckload of hops"" very affectively. I wish rye beers were more widely available. Thanks murph for the sample."
"Bear republic, hop rod rye 8% abv. the first time i had this wasnt sooo good like it is now. wow, hop. like drinking a cup full of hop pellets. the appearance is bright clear amber with a thick slightly off white head that leaves perfect rings and a nice coating on top the entire time. the aroma is thick with hops, small citrus/orange-ish. with a little a nice sweet, slight, malt. the taste is slightly off balance, but great because of it. dry, piney hop, with beautiful sweet malt characteristics. the bitterness is there but not over the edge. the finish is very dry and full bodied that coats the entire mouth with hop. damn, i am still belching up hops. it is coming out my nose, i swear. a must have"
"Wow! This beer really knocked me out. Love at first sip! It pours a rich mahogany colored body topped by a densely creamy bone white head that holds quite well. The head eventually drops, but keeps a good collar and light surface covering - as well as leaving some excellent lace. There are some suspended particles of yeast & hop, but it's only slightly hazy beyond that. The aroma offers a light fruitiness, a gently sweet maltiness, and some sweetly citrusy/lightly piney hops. The body is full, oily, and quite creamy as it warms in the mouth, supported by a moderate and very fine carbonation from bottle conditioning. But the flavor is what really caught my attention! Richly malty with a toffee-ish sweetness, boldy fruity, lightly spicy, and well-infused with bold hop flavor and a firm, but balanced, bracing bitterness. It's quite unique. Although there's only a small percentage used, I guess it's the rye that really helps to give it its distinct character. There's certainly some caramel malt going on, but it also has a spicy edge to it. It finishes dry with a short burst of malt sweetness up-front, and then a long lasting mild piney hop flavor and bitterness. A really flavorful and complex beer that pulls no punches and has exceptional drinkability. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"Pours a dark amber with a thin white head,  Tastes great.  I love hops, and I love a new tasting beer with alot of hops.  This beer has a taste of its own.  Along with having a great hop aroma, mouthfeel, and aftertaste, it has a refreshing rye malt flavor to it.  I love it!  Thanks Xlperro!"
"  ..Im just a bit worried about the skid marks in the morning!!!!"
"Pours a great looking dark amber color with a creamy tan head that holds tight and rings the glass very nicely.  Wonderful fruity/piney hoppiness as well as some nice sweet malt.  The first thing to hit my tongue was the insane hoppiness of this brew.  As the hops begin to back off there are some great fruity esters that give this beer a very nice complexity that is perfect for a fall/winter seasonal.  The finish sees the return of the hops as they jump into the foreground again and stick around on the tongue for quite some time.  Very creamy and crisp with the awesome hoppiness providing a light and refreshing quality to this brew that makes it extremely drinkable.  This is just one awesome beer and I can't wait tot ry some more of Bear Republic's brews."
"Cheers!!!"
"Deep dark color nearly resembles the bottle in which it came out of. Nice looking head that seems to want to hug the sides of my glass. The taste reminds me of Stone's Arogant Bastard, but not as bastardly. The aroma is decent and warns you of what's about to pass your lips and invade the mouth. This is the second beer I've had from Bear Republic and, once again, I am not disappointed. These guys put out a great beer here."
"Good god.  Hop Rod Rye is royalty in peasants clothing.  Assertive and mature hop/rye characteristics.  A tricky trilateral balance between the three key ingrediants.  Somehow this brew is able to maintain an equilibrium.  The hops is undoubtedly seated top of the pyramid, but a keen sense can easily distinguish the awesome barley/rye essenses.  Silky and lubricating mouthfeel.  Notes of toasted barley, wood, resinous hop cones, and of course... rye.  A prost to Bear Republic, undesputed brewery of the west coast."
"Hazt, tawny, dark bronze hue, topped by an off - white head comprised of heterogenously sized bubbles.  Excellent Belgian lace is left down the glass.  Piney, grapefruity, resiny in your face Pacific Northwest hop 4 C hop nose (seemingly dominated by Chinook) hits the nose upfront, but dark caramel and toffee are discernible-- there's only a hint of rye spiciness towards the end of the aroma.  Hop bitterness dominates as expected, but although very assertive, is quite clean & manages to allow spicy rye and the rich, toffeeish malt profile to surface.  Meduim bodied, w/ a slick, proteinaceous, coating mouthfeel from the rye.  Pine hop flavor.  Finishes w/ a puckering bitterness that leaves me craving more, while seemingly out of nowhere biscuit malt eeks its way in.  Hop Rod Rye is tremendously flavorful and rich-- it's not unlike Red Rocket Ale minus the roasted barley notes.  Delicious."
"It's bourbon color with a nice lasting head.  The smell is the familiar northwest-style knock-out hops.  I've never had a rye beer before, but it definitely has a unique and satisfying taste.  This beer's a bit sweet with a distinctive flavor that balances out the sweetness.  For a beer of its abv, it's eminently drinkable.  It's good to see such nice beers coming out of the Golden State."
"An amber-/brown mix in the color.  A frothy head that clings on the glass.  A beautiful hop aroma.  Very bitter.  Nice bite. I like it.  The rye is ever so subtle, but nice.  A big beer.  I'm really catching the NW hop varieties in this one."
