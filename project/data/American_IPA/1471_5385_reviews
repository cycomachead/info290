"One of my all time favorites!"
"Maybe I got a bad bottle not entirely sure as the date was super hard to read. But to me this tasted like a unbalanced Carmel bready mess. Would like to try again at some point just based on reviews on here but for now one of the worse ipa I have had"
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid IPA.  Would rather have a two hearted though."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite IPA's"
""
"O: Big flavor packed into an American IPA."
""
""
""
"This personally isn't my style of choice for an ideal beer, but I will admit that as an IPA this is well made for the style"
""
"Really love the feel of this one and the super delayed hoppy aftertaste..."
""
""
""
""
"Not a pleasant beer too look at, very cloudy but a nice white head. Very citrus grapefruit aroma, starts off with a smooth taste and has a very bitter after taste. Great for anyone looking for that beautiful grapefruit bitter taste. My only wish was the taste was as delicious up front as it is with the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity aroma kind of like peach.Lots of settlement in bottle before pouring. Label says unfiltered and unpasterized. Initial taste bright slightly fruity but not sweet and a little earthy. Carbonation a little higher than average.Smooth hoppy flavor with slight bitter aftertaste."
""
""
"Substantial sediment; pungent grapefruit aroma; resinous, malty arrival, malty and tart; hefty mouthfeel. Not so refreshing, bottle maybe past it's prime (no date) bought 8/15, reviewed 9/1/14."
""
""
""
""
"Good Hoppy taste. Good drinking IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a good beer.  Super hoppy with great hop aroma.  The taste was also that of a hopped up IPA.  The fact it is unfiltered showed a lot of hop residue inside the floating around the glass.  It is stingy and has a big bite.  The bitter factor played a role for me.  The alcohol is definitely detectable.  It is a strong beer and has a strong taste.  Good beer for an IPA lover."
""
""
"Decent IPA but i would be better if the hops were more upfront. Very drinkable beer though!"
""
""
""
""
"Look feel smell and taste are excellent!"
""
""
""
""
""
"If I'm not drinking Two Hearted, I'm drinking Crooked Tree.  If I'm not drinking Hopslam, I'm drinking Double Crooked Tree."
"O: Great balance in everything."
""
"On tap at Ashley’s Ann Arbor. Poured into half pint, this beer is orange-brown with a white head and lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine hops. Flavor is similar with a little malt sweetness that is quickly overwhelmed by the hop bitterness. Dry hop bitter finish. Medium body, medium-high carbonation."
""
""
"Very nice unfiltered IPA... Goes down smooth."
""
"Great and drinkable ipa"
""
""
""
""
"drinking one right now.  very good , but i prefer a more hoppy finish. its kinda sweet, but still very good."

"Didn't do much for me."
""
"Amazingly tastes almost the same in a bottle as it does on tap. I enjoy IPAs. When tasting IPAs, I've found myself using Crooked Tree as the benchmark for comparison.  Cool brewery. Shares a parking lot with an independent bike shop.  Get your oil changed and you get a free beer!  I do my own oil changes, but got to admire the marketing."

"If you can get over the look of an unfiltered beer,  pick this one up.  Fantastic taste and finish"
""
""
""
"No real aroma. Bitter citrus."
""
""
""
"This is a finely balanced IPA. Pours a deep amber/caramel color with plenty of liveliness to the carbonation and the appearance too. Very drinkable, with a good depth of hop flavor and very slight citrus undertones."
"Had this beer served in a pint glass on draft; didn't impress me at all. Head was gone quick, appearance left to just an amber beer with a small collar. To malty for me."
""
""
""
""
"Smoothest not strongest darkhorse has to offer. Definately tilt em back regularly tho"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A generously hopped IPA, compensating on the lack of complexity, but that might also be on me (bottle could be old, can't find any dates on it). Nice."

"Very nice, well balanced IPA that I have been able to enjoy on draft and out of the bottle.  Very drinkable, full hop flavor with nice malt backbone.  Slightly sweet after taste...not at all offensive.  Dark Horse is great and this is a nice staple.  Salute."

"There's a vegetal must that's not jibing with what I want in an IPA.  Perhaps that's the malt bill, which, in Double Crooked Tree presents as a syrupy sweetness.  But here it comes off as a"
""
""
"The Dark Horse is very good.     It is a clean taste, but if there is any criticism it would be that the hops tend to be a bit metallic and cling to the front of your mouth and do not have a full bodied finish.  It does carry a lot of citrus and reminds me a bit of Sun King Osiris, but not quite as good.   This beer is hop forward, has a great nose,  good color and pour, but does not have the dynamite finish a beer that the ""bros"" rate as a 100 should have.     I wonder how they could rate this as perfect, because...while good....is not near perfect.    Better than Anderson Valley and Hop Devil, but behind Two Hearted, Sun King,Dogfish and  Lagunitas."

"O: Very excellent single ipa, I have tried more then should have in the past month or so. Very drinkable low abv at 6.5, perfect blend of hop character with floral notes and slight bitter kick, enjoyed very much, first I've had from Dark Horse, can't wait to try what else they have to offer."

"Crooked Tree pours a cloudy bronze color, with a small lacing head.  There is a nice floral aroma.  The taste is balanced, but still has a nice hoppy bite.  Very very drinkable, very smooth, yet still very flavorful.  Overall it's easy to drink and favorable."

"A simply beautiful IPA.  Pours a uniquely orange-copper color with a two finger head that fades to a nice frothy cap which lasts throughout.  Each sip renews the cap.  Slight carbonation that lasts for the duration.  Flavor matures as it sits in the glass.  Wonderful aroma that isn't overdone as some IPAs can be.  Not too floral.  I've had some IPAs that are killer as far as taste goes but are nearly ruined by the floral aroma.  Almost smells sugary without tasting as such.  A little malty with a hint of caramel.  Flavor stays on the back of the tongue but doesn't ruin the palate.  Few IPAs are better and/or more balanced than this one.  Very reminiscent of its sister beer, Double Crooked Tree, but not such a kick in the ass.  Definitely one to have two or three of without feeling guilty.  Can't find anything negative to say about this guy.  Highly recommend."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, copper coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation throughout, and a filmy, clingy, white head.  Aromas of citrus and tropical fruit forward, with pineapple, grapefruit, and melon, with a sugary sweet caramel backbone, and subtle resinous undertones.  The flavors are like a tropical fruit salad forward, with pineapple, apricot, mango, and melon, followed by a tart grapefruit character, and a solid undertone of cedar and pine pitch, pepper spice, a tangy caramel note, some hops resin, and roasted notes.  Smooth and mid-bodied, with the carbonation lightening things up a bit.  The aftertaste is a bit more of the bitter and resinous hops character shining through, with some of the fruit sweetness handing around still.  Slick, dry, bitter lingering finish.  Solid IPA."

"Just tapped at the local bar I work at here in Swannanoa, NC. Minus the insanely stupid tap handle we have (a double barrel shotgun), this beer is just amazing. Perfect orange hue, very bright finish and not overly bitter for an IPA. Easy to drink, and hard to quit. Kudos to Dark Horse for this gem of a beer."

"I am picky on IPA, but like a piney, and not overhopped, brew. This is as perfect a brew as I've seen at any price."
""
"Nice lacing with a dark amber orange hue. Unique smell in which an orange comes to forefront. Quite balanced lacking a big hop taste. Can taste fruit more than hop. Not overly bitter. Quite smooth for an IPA. As I drink more a malty taste comes out, and fruitiness disappears. Overall a well balanced IPA, but not as good as I was expecting."

"I know it's not kosher to rate a beer a perfect 5, but I have no other choice! This, to me, is the perfect beer! It has a great citrus/piney beginning with a perfectly malty backbone that slides down the back of your tongue until your stomach is in a euphoric state! This IPA is the ultimate IPA and if you haven't tried it, you are truly missing out! I don't know if there is a brewery with a more well rounded selection of beers!"

"Poured very dark and cloudy. A brick color orange against the light bulb but in the natural light like a hazy brown. Off white creamy head that fell slowly and left lace. Nose is faint and first thing I did was look for a date on the bottle. There wasn't one so they sold it me and I am going to review it. I got a flash of some citrus. Pink grapefruit and some lemon peel. I am smelling the very small and luscious beginings of caramel and just a bit of dry biscuit. Seems to me that the hops have faded off because i have to really dive in for the nose. Taste is malt forward. Biscuit and lovely biscuit with a bit of dryness a bit of sweetness. Not really any fruit on the palate but just some remnants of the hop character. Just enough to tease a bit and make you wish it was fresh. I thought I tasted some orange, very light orange. A small bitter and malt. Dry sweet biscuit with a hint at caramel. the malt was lovely. No pine, not really any grapefruit on the palate just a juiciness. Mouthfeel was light enough and soft. I want it again when it is fresh and reserve the right to revisit."

"O - A good choice for the hophead aiming to drink a couple down without getting trashed. There are big hop flavors, a nice malt counterpoint, and a reasonable, but not sessionable, ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose is decent with good but not strong hop aroma mixed with malt sweetness. Finishes with good amount of bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Good lace all the way down to bottom of glass.This is what I would think of a great representation of a traditional American IPA."

""

""
""
""
""
""

"All in all, simply, I wouldn't buy it again for what I paid for it. It's 'drinkable,' but once it's out of my fridge it will not be returning."
""
"O - I love IPA's but for whatever reason the high bitterness and the lack of great tasting hops is not doing it for me, it taste to lemon forward and astringent. I will not be picking anymore of these up, sorry Dark Horse I love most of your beers but not this one, Cheers."
"Overall, I'll buy this again. So juicy, I expected pulp. Very nice."

"Overall: Good but not great. Nice balance, but nothing wows me. This actually reminds me of Torpedo with the earthy hop character. I can think of many, many IPAs better than this one and will likely pass over this more times than not. However, it's a solid offering from a solid brewery, and recommended to try atleast once. Cheers!"

"O - more punishing than I remember, great for hopheads who enjoy a pungent grapefruit flavor. It seems out of balance to me, but I still like it."
"Really nice IPA. Huge dose of hops."
""
""
""
"O: A good IPA, nice hop flavor, needs less malt character, needs to be a bit drier, and that alcohol twang (fuselly maybe? I've had half and feel a headache coming on) needs to go. Borderline recommend."

"First IPA that I tried and actually enjoyed! A very smooth IPA. The citrus and hoppy flavors go well with a wide variety of food. Large amount of toffee/caramel flavors. Has a sweet taste with a little bitterness as an aftertaste. Nice light orange color with a white head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Citrus base with grapefruit and oranges. Flavor nice and balanced. Large amount of grain and toffee malts. Hops are a nice balance of citrus and floral. Hazy amber color with soapy head and lace. Dark. Best served in a shaker. More of a sweet malt finish than a hoppy one."

""
""
""
"This is a heavily hopped IPA with a rounding sweetness. Slight alcohol is noticeable, but well-integrated. This is an excellent example of a standard American IPA! Very enjoyable!"
"Poured a golden body with two finger head and lace ring down glass. Elegant aroma that balances a large chunk of citric hops and some fruit sweetness as well as some caramel malt. Beer is light, easy drinking fare, that has a large amount of hops that a hophead could like with a little bit of sweetness and bread malt to fill out the body. Pretty simple but good IPA."

""
""
""
""

"O: A rock solid IPA. I appreciate the fact that it is unfiltered, although I did not feel the lack of filtration added anything new to the flavor. In the end, I like this beer, but I am not certain I can really relate to the hype that seems to surround it."
""

"Has a hazy, translucent brown color, with a small bit of white head. Smells of spruce and a touch of citrus. I don’t get a dry finish so much as a surprisingly sweet finish. It’s a nice touch. Flavor is spruce and citrus, with some medium bitterness. An enjoyable IPA."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"This is great. First you're drawn into this thick caramel colored liquid that has so much sediment wandering around. Then, it's citrus all around. The grapefruit hits your nose like a hammer, and the tangerine sip just seals the deal. If you like IPAs, get this. The tangerine taste is so interesting. I would definitely get this again."

"Another awesome ipa from another awesome Michigan brewer. Pours a beautiful hazy Orange with a very small head of off white foam which dissipates to a very nice, lasting lacing. The aroma is all grapefruit and pine, almost reminiscent of fresh mangoes. It Sips smooth but with a body that coats the mouth very nicely. The flavor is what really takes this one to the next level. Super hoppy and bitter but well balanced. Lots of citrus and pine and very fresh tasting. This is definitely a go to ipa. Extra points for my favorite designed tap handle in the business."
""
""
"O- what a great drinkable ipa. Balanced and enjoyable. Really enjoyed this and will circle back"
"O - Crooked Tree is simply a stunning work of art. Maybe the greatest ipa I've ever had. West Coast my tail... This is a world class take on keeping an ipa complex and perfectly balanced. It's my new go to ipa. This is Michigan brewing at its absolute greatest. A grand gem and crown jewel no matter who you stack it up against in its range of abv."

"Pours cloudy burnt orange, with a 1 finger off white head. Lots of earthly bitterness in the nose, with a little bit of pine in there as well. Grapefruit is there too, but mostly hidden. The taste is rather surpising, the bitterness is there but so is a impressive malt backbone that fights back just as hard as the hops. The bitterness does win out in the end with a bitterness kick that just keeps hanging around. I've always seen this beer at the store, but for some reason I always pass it by. Not this time, thankfully. This is one of the better IPAs I've had in a long time."

"Imagine my surprise when I found this tasty little treat! I picked it up on a lark at Muggs Party Store in Grand Haven, and I was blown away! And I thought that Two Heart was the only IPA that I could ever score this high. Though not quite as smooth and balanced as a Bells Two Hearted Ale, this beer can hold its' own with any other IPA I've ever sampled. Now whenever I reach for an IPA six pack at my local beer store, I have 3 solid choices, Founders Centennial IPA, a Two Heart, or this little gem."

"While not a session beer, this tasted and felt a lot more potent than the 6.50% ABV would have led me to believe. This had just the right amount of body to feel like a Rye beer and a slightly dry-hopped nature that led me to sip more in an attempt to quench my thirst. This was wonderful and if you love beers that delight and surprise while delivering a healthy does of hops, you owe it to yourself to give this a go. I'm glad this was available in my neck of the woods!"

"There’s a big, piney-citrusy aroma followed by some light straw. On the flavor I get a lot of bittersweet citrus with a pleasing bitterness and a piney-resiny dry finish. There’s more heft to this than the West Coast IPAs I’ve grown accustomed to—but it’s consistent enough with the other Michigan IPAs that come to mind (Two Hearted anyone?) that I think it’s far to say there might be a regional influence to the style at this point."

"Oh how I wish this came in a can! Please effort that Dark Horse! This is my ""go to"" summer beer. It is THE ideal beer for cookouts and such. If ever a beer needed to come in cans ... it's this beer. Pours a little darker than your normal high end IPA, but don't let that fool you. You may even smell a little bit of the malt in your noes, but don't let that fool you either. This is the most well balanced beer you will find on the market, and I'm a total hop head. I judge a beer on it's hops, and I can drink this beer all day long and then some. There are some beers that are of supreme quality that can vary from six to six and this is one of those beers. Sometimes it's slightly darker than other times, but it doesn't matter. It always has that citrus and fruit hop dance on the tongue. What really makes this beer shine is the buzz, and I'm not lying. It has that over the top ""I'm king of the world and everything is good!"" feel to it. It's a total smiley face beach and summer time social beer that won't bring you down. I have had all the variations from double, to falconers, to cascade, but the best is the strait crooked tree ipa. If this came in cans it would be touching the 5 star mark!"

"Dark red caramel color. Looks very appealing. Did a vertical tastin with the other crooked trees. Very very malty smell. Overly malt flavor with a slight citrus finish. Easy drinking beer, but I don't see this as an IPA. Leaves a bitter finish in the end. Least favorite Crooked Tree beer of the 4."

"overall: The sleeper of great IPA's in the Great Lakes Region, this underrated brewery puts out some great beers, this one is no exception. Superbly balanced, the bitterness is easily pushed aside by the smooth drinkability. Perfect amount of floral and citrus notes to create a near perfect representation of the style."

"The only good crooked tree is a bonsai... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunset bronze topped by a finger of wan cream foam. The nose comprises lightly-tart grapefruit zest, toffee, pine resin, light earthy greens, and a mild pinch of mint. The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine is now the star of the show (though nowhere near the only one) and the grapefruit now favors the peel. he body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice, decently-balanced IPA, one of the better regularly-offered IPAs out there if you ask me."
"Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA ---4/5."

"O: This is a kickass IPA, a definite in-your-face bitterness without approaching the tongue-raping that some brewers seem to be aiming for with their IPAs. I really like that there is some malt character to go along with the hops. Highly recommended."

"O = I am accustomed to my IPA's having a lighter weight so this beer throws my expectations off. The flavor and aroma is dead on, so don't get me wrong! I am noting that seasoned (or inebriated) reviewers are giving this high marks because they like this twist. I could easily come to highly favor IPA heavy weights. I'd like to introduce this beer to my friends who favor BA's of IPA's and see what they think. And I'd like a Black IPA to carry this weight. I'll have it again."

""
""

"O: This is an above average beer, but to me, it's not ""great"". I like IPA's to have more attack and resiny hop flavors. If you like your IPA's to have a more rounded flavor than this might be the one for you."

"O: I visited this brewery on 4/6/13, was a very cool atmosphere and was very impressed with the beer selection, this was a good IPA."

"This is a really good IPA. I bought a 1/6 keg off of a recommendation and I was rather surprised. First pull revealed a nice creamy head, not to thick but a nice lacing on the glass. ( I use the Sam Adams tech glasses for first time hoppy beers) First whiff of the beer was very subtle but could catch hoppy and biscuity notes. Appearance is orange in color and a little cloudy at first but cleared up a few pulls. Taste leaves a nice hoppy presence and rounds out with just enough malt but still keeping it dry. No crystal malt here. Good dry finish with the hops shining through especially for an average ABV. IPA. Mouth feel is a little thin but that is okay because it is not a imperial or double IPA. Overall a great beer and will be looking forward to buying this beer again!"
""
""
""
"The taste is well balanced between malt and hops and it gives a more Pale Ale flavor. Very little citrus or floral hop flavor it felt more like a 60 Minute clone. That's not a bad thing as the feel is smooth and easy with little to no aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've always dug the Double Crooked Tree but I had never actually tried this one. Well done."
"O - Very solid IPA and I look forward to trying this fresh. I think it would also be interesting to try the versions of this beer that are made with different hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A decent IPA from Dark Horse but nothing special. The intensely bitter and earthy character is contrary to what I typically look for in an IPA or DIPA. Not to say this wasn't enjoyable or a task to drink, but it's a beer I don't really need to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK IPA. Flavor is pretty good, appearance and aroma are weak. Still glad to get a chance to try this out-of-market beer."
""
""
"A solid, albeit not stellar IPA. Needed to be a touch more dry to really shine. Solid hop profile, but just feels a little unfinished. Still worth drinking from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I consider myself a connoisseur of IPAs and while Crooked Tree is able to scratch the hophead itch in me, it doesn't elicit any of the real good hop flavor and balance that others of the style can deliver. That being said, I'd recommend it if you can find it. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
""
""
"O: I reckon this one would really work during the summertime - in some ways, this drinks like a saison. There are better IPAs to be found, but there are also many worse ones as well."
"D - I'm a little let down by this one, especially being my first Dark Horse beer. I'd like to try it again, though preferably on draught (and fresh)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was excited to try this beer given it's high BA score, but I was so disappointed. The appearance and mouthfeel were average. The smell was musky, earthy, with some hay and straw notes. The taste was similar, with a lot of bitter citrus as well. I consider myself quite a ""hophead," but this was far to bitter and unbalanced for me."

"Overall: This brew didn’t “wow” me, but it is good and very drinkable…the flavor is full, somewhat robust and is easily something I could drink a couple of in one sitting…a great beer to have around the house for after work, not overly complex but hardy and tough enough to smooth out the edges of the day…a simple review for a simply good brew…(3.75/5)"

"Overall: Glad I got to try this beer. Can't say it's my favorite IPA, but I'd drink it again."

""
"This is a decent IPA. It's a bit more malty than hoppy which is fine by me. I liked the malty sweetness throughout, but I wish there was a hop character that balanced better with the malts. The hops here are bitter and piney with some citrus, but they seem like they're trying to force the balance issue against the sweetness. Nonetheless, this is a good IPA that has good drinkability. I'm not sure I'd choose it over some of my favorites, but I'll certainly never turn it down."
"D: I would order a second. I'm glad I gave it a second chance, this bottle was much fresher than my first and it was excellent. Above average. I would buy again."

"Overall, I more than really like this beer. Has just enough of everything to be balanced. I don't love it, perhaps due to me preferring a higher gravity beer. However, whatever it may lack can be accounted for simply by the fact that it is billed as a standard IPA, not anything bigger. I'll respect that, and rate it accordingly. I think it's just a great representation of the single IPA style. With this being as good as it is, it makes me really want to get my hands on Double Crooked Tree. It's definitely worth grabbing a 6 pack of it."

"I'm not sure what to think. I don't find it to taste like an american IPA much at all, rather a pale ale. But then again, this is more bitter than an APA. To say this beer is interesting would be an understatement. I'm not too fond of the chunky appearance (makes me understand why many breweries like filtering their beers), but I can't deny the taste.I find the rating on this site to be a bit high, but to each their own. Still a good one."

"Overall, this is Pretty tasty IPA - a little off the beaten path for today's IPAs but very good."

"This beer pours hazy deep orange color with a white head. The nose on the beer is more subtle then the intense flavors. The beer hits first with an average bitter intensity. The first thing I notice is the feel, the feel is full bodied and has a crispness that almost reminds me of a rye beer. Speaking of rye, I get an ever so slight earthy spiciness out of the beer. However the highlight for me is the fresh hop characters. The beer has a moderate amount of citrus, ranging from lemon to pineapple. I think the most notable aspect is the pine flavor, and I mean evergreen tree type pine. This is a great IPA, Dont miss out on the Double Crooked Tree as that is one of my favorite IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, satisfying ipa but a little to bitter and drying from the hops."
""
""
""
"O – Overall disappointing after seeing the great reviews. Not a bad beer by any standard but I like an IPA with a great balance between different hops and malts. This beer is fairly streamlined from what I can gather."
""
"Overall looks nice smells good but little mellow in the taste department for an American IPA. But it could be a nice change from hop bombs of the day."

"On tap at 2012 Autumn Brew Review, from notes. Poured light orange amber with a light creamy foam head. Smells of orange citrus, grapefruit and pine resins. Taste replete with grapefruit pith, orange, pine and subtle pineapple. Moderately bitter. Medium bodied. Crisply carbonated. Finishes dry. Classic IPA across the board even if it doesn't stand out from the crowd it's quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good Midwest I.P.A. Well balanced between the juicy hop bitterness and bready caramel malt sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delightful IPA that doesn't do too much to stand out. It doesn't steer from the beaten path of ipas for uniqueness, experiment, or identity. It simply hits the tried-and-true recipe head on and builds it well. Its rewards are well deserved, both by Dark Horse, and by me!"
""
""
" Pours a cloudy, dirty brown color with a slight fluffy head. Has a mild scent of bitter hops but not very strong. Taste is slightly bitter, bold, and refreshing. Hints of citrus and sweet malts hint your taste buds as the beer finishes with a crisp, dry, after taste. Decent volume but could use a little work in the bitterness as this beer drinks a little too easy for an IPA but it is delicious in it’s own way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent IPA. Not to the level of Two Hearted or my other favorites, to me."
""
"Eh, tasted like 3 month old Hop Devil. Kinda disappointed, the best thing was it looked good, no nose at all, a malt bomb IPA. Won't buy again. So many better IPA's out there I'll give the 5 remaining bottles away. I was hoping for something kinda fruity and what I got was a mess."
""
""
""
"This is a good, tasty IPA. If you like lots of tropical fruit hop notes you will love this one."

"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is light. I like the balance of flavor and overall lack of booziness that this beer brings. I think it's a great beer for the style.

"Very dark amber pour, almost a light brown. Thin head, fine lacing. Scents of citrus, nice floral hops, and honey. So far so good. Taste is very similar with a surprisingly balanced malt profile to back up the floral hops. A touch of nuttiness thats really a nice addition, taste is very fresh. Mouthfeel is very balanced, carbonation is slightly less fine than I'm used to but its a nice change and not a huge difference in carbonation. I really like the balance on this brew, its not too biting and it has full flavor to back it up. Great IPA!"

"Had this a long time ago, thought it was okay. This time around, it was much to my liking. Goes to show you how the palate changes over time. A solid IPA with a nice ashy and earthy bitterness. Reasonably priced and local, too."
""
"O: A fantastically sweet, malty, but also finely hopped IPA that isn't a big hop bomb. A welcomed departure from the typical IPA."
"O: This is a solid offering in the IPA feild. It has strong flavors without going crazy. Also, it is very yeasty for an IPA, but it works here as a different way to provide some balance to the hops. The yeast, malt, and hops blend well for a bold flavor that is just a little different from most IPA's, and that helps make this beer interesting. And, you just gotta love the rough and tough look of this beer - it is cloudy with stuff floating around and that just makes it look like a manly beer."

"The definition of a solid AIPA - great hoppy flavor with good availability and a decent price. Highly recommended."

"A middle of the road IPA for me. Honestly, anyone can craft a bitter IPA but I think a true master of the style would have provided a slightly stronger malt bill to back things up and create a stronger balance."

"This unfiltered IPA pours a cloudy rusty orange, with low-ish head, and moderate lacing. Aroma is a hoppy floral nose with a top, bright estery note of pine and some sweeter citrus. Taste is balanced between sweet, bready and bitter; the over-bitter notes fade a bit, but linger, as an IPA should. Mouth-feel is substantial with moderate carbonation: a foamy, creamy, wet finish. Overall a solid, highly balanced IPA with little over-dominance by any elements and one I'll buy again. And again."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this held its own very well with both the Two-Hearted and Centennial we split right before this. The biggest difference here was the orange over other citrus. Very good."
""
""
"O - Good, but not great, IPA. Doesn't really do anything to separate itself from the vast sea of IPAs out there. It was certainly on the malty side, but I suspect it may be a bit past its prime. Dark Horse provides no dating info, so I will not give them the benefit of the doubt on the freshness and assume this is how they intended it. I much prefer DCT, and probably won't get this one again."
""
""
"Aroma is citrus with orange zest most prominent, A little bread in the smell as well. Taste is immediately biscuity and bitter, not just in the aftertaste. Not getting as much citrus in the taste, a bit one dimensional but a nice IPA."
""
""
"O- This was a great IPA, one of the better ones that I've had. It had all of the characteristics that I like in IPAs- lots of hops and a sweet grapefruit/piney taste. This beer definitely had a little bit more of a peach/grapefruit taste then most IPAs which made it a little bit different. It wasn't the sweetest IPA I've had, Heady Topper takes that by far, but it was good. The finish was a little bit too bitter and the overall taste could have been slightly sweeter, but other then that this beer was great. Definitely have to try some Double Crooked Tree next!"
""
""
""
"This beer is murky orange in color with an orange tinted white head. At the pour, head is an inch high, and in reasonable time it shrinks into a bubbly 1/4' topping. Lace is scattered around a little bit. Aroma is full of citrus and tropical fruits, earthy woody scents, and bread dough malts. Rather well balanced. Individual flavors are kinda hidden in the bitterness but I do perceive citrus rind, various tea-like things, maybe leaves, and some light maltiness. Mouthfeel starts smooth and then grittiness sets in alongside prickly carbonation. Overall a pretty decent brew. Worth picking up now and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The best part of this is that its drinkable. Its not overly anything. Theres a bitterness on the backend. Citrus fruits somewhere in the middle (im thinking lemon zest). the hops are a bit spicy as well and a slight sourness from the lemon zest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours out as a nice looking copper color. The head was white with a decent lacing to it. The smell of the beer was slightly sweet with big notes of pine like citrus. The taste of the beer was full of bitter hops along with some grapefruit flavors. The mouthfeel of the beer wasn't too heavy at all, it's got a bitter lingering feeling to it. Overall I thought this was a pretty good brew."
""
""
"O: It won't blow your mind, but it's a decent, easy-drinking IPA. A good beer for when you just want to knock a few back without having to think too much about it."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a nice thin cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, biscuit, orange, pine, toasted grain, and herbal spiciness. Some nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big pine, caramel, biscuit, grapefruit, orange, herbal, and toasted malt. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, biscuit, and toasted malt on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of malt and bitterness make this quite easy to drink. Medium carbonation and body.; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a very slight warming after the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is a damn nice IPA. Nice hoppiness and balance; and very smooth to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was recommended to me at the Cervezorama beer shop in Madrid It was a bit spendy but it was something new to try. Pours a hazy burnt orange into my wine glass. Mild head and minimal lacing. Aroma is piney and citrus. Taste is malt base with some sweetness and hoppy pine flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and hop oily slickness. Not much carbonation. Overall a very pleasant IPA and well worth another try."

"Hazy, obviously unfiltered, orange-amber with a small, creamy white head on top. Definitely a more balanced type aroma for an IPA, but a good one...dark, juicy citrus, lime, flowers, grapefruit, peach, and some sugary malt. Mellow spicy citrus hop flavor with some black tea and grain. Very nicely balanced...when it's done right like this, I can really dig it. Lots of grapefruit, tangerine, and an increasing amount of pine resin and perhaps a bit of wood. Drying, textured medium body. Really quite nice all around."

"M: Good amount of carbonation with good mouth coating."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the golden copper colored ale produced a modest head. Even so it gave a sweet malty aroma, which was only a shallow reflection of the flavor to come. A sweet malty hoppy flavor showed hints of pineapple and peach. The malt seemed to clear a path for the citrus in the hops. A slightly thickened texture allowed the flavor to stick to the roof of the mouth and sides of the tongue nicely. The vitality of the citrus allowed the flavor to stay nicely in the aftertaste with the malty backbone disappearing. This is a very complex and drinkable IPA."

"Pours hazy yellow with strong head. Smells of straight pine and hops, with a bit of pale malt sweetness (especially on tap). Slams you with bitterness up front, pine, lemons, pine, and finishes with more. Highlights hops very well, very little balance from the malts. However, when I had this fresh on tap it tasted much more balanced, with beautiful sweet light malts to accent the big bitter--plenty of citrus in that case that really lightened up the bruising palate. Must like bitterness for this one. On point for wrecking the palate."

"An average IPA. No need to seek this one out again."

"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this is one easy-drinking, thirst-quenching IPA. The body is light and easy to swallow. Some may find this a good thing on a hot day but others may feel that it leaves a watery mouthfeel. The carbonation seems just right as it fizzes just slightly but never interferes with the flavors or the experience."
""
""
"O-a solid IPA, easy drinking."
""
"O - Very solid IPA, West coast style from this midwest brewer. Complex aromas and taste for an IPA, could use more ""punch"" to be elite, but could be that this was an older bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had expected a lot from this beer and I can't help but feel a little bit let down. Still a good beer and one I wouldn't hesitate to drink again, but I'd pass this over for a number of other IPAs."
""
""
"O: I can almost feel my mouth drying with each sip. Something makes me want to pair this beer with seafood or a mushroom-cream dish. I think it deserves another try from an un-jostled bottle to escape the overt yeast sediment, as mine had just been unpacked from a bike ride home."
"O: My first IPA from Michigan, not bad. There are some nice citrus hop notes going in this beer, which is more West Coast than Midwest."
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one, great IPA."
""
""
""
"My only disappointment is that this is not in pints. Oh well open two bottles at a time."
""

"O: Amazing. For me this is an IPA. Hops are forward with but malts are hanging on in the back. Perfect bitterness. So enjoyable. Had to let it warm a bit to get the full effect but so glad I did. I could keep drinking."

"O- My first Michigan IPA other than Founders Centennial. I must say that I prefer this IPA over the Founder's as it has more of a west-coast hop profile. This beer is pretty well-balanced without allowing the malt to overpower the hops at all. It's a good example of the style but in my opinion it's not something I would particularly seek out if it's not local."
"Cloudy copper color, nicely laced, pours well out of the bottle. Smell is like grapefruit and a little earthy-- like fallen pine needles on a cold fall day. Dominant taste is bitterness of the hops, well balanced by the malt. Has a nice acidity and brightness to it, like a good medium roast coffee (though I dont mean to say it tastes like coffee). Great mouthfeel; smooth, drinkable, well-carbonated. I think I'll have another."

"very large 3.5 finger off white head with very nice lacing. Body is cloudy with amber and brown hues. aroma is a nice cirtus and hoppy aroma with hints of malt. A slightly musty hop flavoring in the opening with transition to mild citrus and woody hop flavor with more musty hops in the finish. medium body and moderate barbonation. A very good IPA. Not sure if I liked it as much as the Bros but still good."

"Excellent mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation, somewhat full-bodied and sticky. No bottle dating makes me suspect this a little on the old side; the hops seem oddly faded but still powerful in terms of the bitter oniony flavor. Only hints of what may have been a stronger juicy tropical fruit taste. Solid but not top tier."
""
"Overall it's a decent beer. IPA's have become a bit boring for me these days but it's still very enjoyable. It's definitely a well made beer, but I want it to be just a little bit more than it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not so good. This bottle must have been past its prime."
""

"Overall: This is a solid IPA, but I would have liked the balance to be a bit better. I might have another if I ever see it on-tap."

"Something is going on here because according to the website and the reviews here on the BA this is a west coast style IPA. But to me this is more of an English IPA. Lightly hopped sweet caramel malts and diacetyl contributing a butterscotch taste all scream English. In any event it's good no matter what."
""

""
""
""
""
"NOTE: Had this again on 3/18/2013 and the flavor was much hoppier than the first review indicates, so I raised the score fro 3.5 up to 3.75. It was still very herbal and floral to me, but the piney and citrus hop notes came through stronger and gave a better true IPA flavor."

"O - A wonderful, wonderful IPA. The flavors and aromas are spot on. This is what an American IPA should taste like."

"Mmmm Hops, I can smell em as soon as I pop the cap off the bottle. Slightly cloudy deep amber color with a smallish white head that displays marginal retention. Smells citrusy with grapefruit, lemon and pineapple aromas trying to cover up a bready caramel malt sweetness. Taste is a bit harsh with hop resin, but also has citrus and bready malt backing it up a bit. Again I question just how long this bottle has been sitting on the store shelf because this doesn't seem to be a fresh example of an IPA. Medium to light body and carbonation level with a slick resinous mouthfeel. Decent as is, but I think this is a better beer than what I am tasting tonight."
"It provides a finish and then a beer easy to drink and very nice, if not more."
"Easily my favorite michigan IPA. It tastes extremely hoppy despite only being 39 IBUS. Heavy on the grapefruit and slight floral notes. Aftertaste does not have any lingering bitterness that isn't balanced perfectly against malt and grapefruit taste."
"O: Whoa, nice IPA here. Would love some more intensity in the flavor, but still a lot of interest and the lace is unreal. Well, it's an hours drive to get more, but I'll find a way. Yum!"
"This is a pretty tasty IPA and for the price:flavor ratio I'd say it's worth trying, definitely at least worth getting a pint (approximately $6 in Buffalo)."
"O - Not a bad IPA, somewhat refreshing but way too bitter for my taste. I would not recommend it."
"O - Quite enjoyable. I'll seek it out again."
"Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation and light bitterness. Not too bitter, so it's pretty drinkable. Not too thin. A good IPA, but not exceptional. Recommended for a once in awhile staple."
"I'd say this is a very solid, nice IPA from the Dark Horse Brewery. I'd definitely have another if given the chance. Though it might be a while before I come back to it, simply because there are just so many IPAs out there to try."
"Overall - From the look of this beer and some of the previous reviews I thought this was going to be sweeter, it absolutely is not. The look and feel of this IPA reminds me strongly of Short's Huma Lupa Licious. It is a very tasty, puckering and bitter IPA, but a bit unbalanced without a stronger malt backbone. If you prefer little to no malt/carmel sweetness, then you will love this beer. I prefer a little more balance and sweetness personally, but still a fine IPA. *My mouth is numb after the session, definitely one of the most bitter and drying/puckering IPA's I've ever had."
"A customer recently dropped this off - kind of like a bolt from the blue. Did not know the guy from Adam, but he started chatting up one of my bartenders and was impressed with our beer offerings. I had high hopes for this beer when I saw other member reviews, but overall really did not like the somewhat soapy hop character. Stays in your mouth for a long time like a woman with too much perfume on her skin after nibbling on her neck. I did like the fact that the beer was quite dark for an IPA and that it was unfiltered. Looking to try other offerings from this brewery."
"O: I like this beer although I wouldn't go way out of my way to buy it. The buttery note doesn't belong, but the hoppiness and other malt characteristics are very solid."
"aroma is somewhat of chocolate and sweet, backed by light floral and grass hops. Appearance is pleasing. body is dark amber brown and cloudy. Taste is sweet grassy hops with a hint of unsweetened chocolate. Palate is somewhat fizzy carbonation with a pleasant dryness finish. Overall it is a great take on an IPA. It might be a little too dry to be perfect- but it is darn good."
"D - A straight-forward American IPA that doesn't pull any punches... More than respectable, but far from remarkable... The 6% ABV packs a surprising punch... Another solid offering from Dark Horse..."
"Pours deep bright orange in body with white head that clings. Aroma of citrus, wet grass, and slight floral notes. Tastes of citrus, refreshing hop bouquet, clean bitterness, slight mint. Medium carbonation and medium body. A refreshing palate cleanser of a beer."
"Overall. Nice ipa full of flavour and easy drinking."
"I've had this beer recommended to me and tried twice previously. I suspected they were old bottles and didn't review. I'm certain the new one reviewed here was fresh and what a difference!"
"not too bad overall. i went to a local store to buy a mix pack of ipa's i've never tried before and this is my first from that batch"
"O - nice refreshing enjoy the balanced bitter with other flavors"
"O: have yet to be disappointed by Dark Horse, this is excellent."
"This beer drinks bigger than the abv would suggest. Very bright citrus hopping is the focus of attention here, and the malt, while adequate, is simply a delivery vehicle. Pungent up front, but not overpowering, the beer actually gives an initial impression of being a hop-monster, but then pulls in the reigns and settles into well-but-not-over-hopped mode. I was surprised to see it is only 6%, as it has a bit of bite at the finish."
"This is a fine IPA....big flavor at a sensible abv level."
"Drinking a bottle of this after drinking all of the ""Dekoorc Eert"" single-hop variations, and all I can say is ""wow."" Nothing even comes close to the charm of the original! Scores unchanged."
"A generally ok IPA, just too restrained to keep one's attention."
"O: Nice but not earth shattering. Still not a rotation beer at this price point."
"O – This reminds me a lot of an English Style IPA, it was very good and maybe the sediment changed this a little but for my first Dark Horse beer I was really impressed."
"O: Aside from the appearance I am very impressed and pleased with this beer. It is quite drinkable and am happy I found 3 bottles of it at shop near me. I'll certainly be buying this again."
"eep amber, copper, w/ a one finger head wich settled nicely, fine lacing throughout. Smell and taste both lived up to the name! Smell came through strong piney, with citrus overtones, very fresh smelling. Tatsed AWESOME.. Grabbed you right away with the fesh pine taste and lingered for a good bit, almost begging you back for more. Very smooth and highly drinkable, if I had more access to this I could be in trouble! Overall highly recommended"
"O- A good standard IPA. Worth picking up."
"O: While the beer smells good, the flavor is a definite let-down. Not really a bad beer, but not one I'd buy again, either."
"On tap at prairie moon in evanston, il. Pours a beautiful dark orange with a half inch foamy white head that sticks to the glass throughout. Initial smell hits the nose with pine and grapefruit. Slightly earthy as well. Hop fanatics will flock to this beer, a lip puckering brew to say the least. Tastes of grapefruit hit you right off the bat with a dry sweetness finishing the sip, oh and dont forget about the beautiful hops pounding your taste buds! Overall an enjoyable brew that I find myself drinking whenever I see it."
"overall, this is a very drinkable IPA but a little on the lighter taste side. I wish the bottle was dated, as that would perhaps explain the muted hops (if it was a bit older that is). that being said, still a very tasty sessionable Ipa"
"Pours a very dark orange/copper color that was quite unexpected for an IPA. It borders on the appearance of a light amber. About a half inch of foamy beige head appears, lingers for some time, and slowly fades to patches. Sticky lacing is left behind. Smells of caramel malt, grapefruit, some orange, and floral hops. Tastes very similar, with the hops in the front, followed by the lemon, citrus, and pine, and a smooth caramel finish. Mouthfeel is very good; smooth with great carbonation. Overall, a great beer that I'd love to sit down with again sometime."
"O- It's a good beer. It's very balanced in the hop and malt dept. and that is something that I prefer with my IPA's"
"Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a fluffy two finger head with a slight brown tint. The aroma was of caramel malt and piney hops with a hint of citrus. The taste was a little thin up front. The middle was of biscuits and pine hops with an end of citrus. The mouthfeel was moderate carbonation. Overall it was an okay ipa but the taste left me wanting more."
"Overall - Pretty soild ipa. Slightly more malty then most ipa's. The balance is right on with hops mixed with malts. Tasty for sure and easy to drink."
"Many thanks to GordianKnot for the chance to try this beer. Poured from 12oz bottle into my DFH snifter. Ugliest IPA pour I have ever seen- pours a murky dark dishwater dirty brown color. A little bit of head, barely any retention. I can only assume that this is a really old bottle, or something has gone terribly wrong with this one. After it gets into the glass, it looks like dirty brown dishwater, pretty disgusting. Smell- applejuice, some spices from the hops. Faint breadiness from the malt. Taste- gross. this is like applesauce gone wrong. You get some sweet flavors from the malt, and some bitterness from the hops, but this does not even resemble an IPA. This is a drainpour. I can only assume this is some sort of quality control issue after reading the reviews."
"I don't see much Dark Horse around here, but have been pleased with all that I taste."
"Strong caramel malt backbone with a biscuit flavor. Perhaps some burnt sugar and toasted grains. The finish provides a moderate hop punch with hints of lemon zest and tart grapefruit."
"O- I actually found this beer very hard to transcribe into words. Incredibly different. A lot of complexity in the hops; mostly earthy, floral, spicy, but tiny bit of fruit too. Looking forward to Double Crooked Tree next to see where they take this."
"Crooked Tree IPA is a brown, caramel colored brew, with a small head that leaves a fair amount of lace in its wake. The nose has a lot of malts, with grapefruit and other citrus hop notes, a bit piney as well. The taste starts out with a rich caramel malt front, which is well-blended with the focus of this beer, which is the hop profile. The malt is very biscuity, and there is a bit of spiciness from the alcohol. The hops run the citrus end of the spectrum, with grapefruit tones getting the most attention, but also some lemony, piney, bitter and quite citrusy. The mouth is a bit thin and pretty wet."
"O - Great beer once you get past the sediment. For whatever reason, I had a bottle or two of this hanging around well after what i found was the freshness curve. Once tamed down, it has similar characteristics to Levitation."
"Poured a fairly cloudy, dark amber with a couple fingers of head but with little retention. Leaves some nice bubbly lacing around the glass that lasts. Good hop smell with citrus and some pine notes as well. Corresponding with the smell there is a solid hop presence in the taste, but not too bitter for those who might be opposed to such. Fairly well balanced with the malt. Drinks smooth throughout, but finishes a bit dry leaving me wanting more. Overall, a well crafted IPA that I can see myself drinking often."
"Murky dark orange pour with a quickly receding head. Citrus, pine and fruity aroma. Nice hoppy taste. More citrus than anything else, but there is also a very light toastiness from the malt, which is as light as advertised. Very pleasant to drink. Not so much a hop bomb, just an enjoyable hoppy experience."
"I really like what Dark Horse does, but I personally just don't like these kind of IPAs. I'd much rather have a Double Crooked Tree IPA."
"Overall I like this beer and would buy and drink more of it. Not my favorite IPA by any means, but definitely drinkable."
"A very nice IPA, tasty, without being crazy."
"Overall I wasn't expecting much just based on the appearance. But as the saying goes, ""you can't judge a book by the cover"". This brew overly exceeded my expectations."
"Overall, while the high IBUs will drive off anyone who's not serious about their hops, those who appreciate the finer points of the plant will find themselves in their own private heaven. Even better, the beer is decently balanced, providing a nice relief from those IPAs that are the equivalent of a hop nuke."
"I'm not impressed. Very malty, and not very flavorful. And doesn't taste at all like an IPA. It's quite possible that this bottle is past its prime. But without a date on it, who's to know? I suppose that's the risk the brewer and the buyer take."
"O - Not really my preferred style of IPA, this is way too malty and sticky for my taste. Hoping the Double is better."
"Nothing mind-blowing but quite good. If you live and MI and like IPA’s it’s a must try."
"This IPA is certainly hop-forward, but it's a hop characteristic that doesn't mesh with the rest of the beer. I'd be willing to try this again if I'm in the area, though, to make sure I somehow didn't get a bad example."
"Overall a good tasting beer. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Wouldn't mind drinking this again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: This is a great IPA. I regularly pick up a bottle or 6. It is one of the best in Michigan, hands down."
"A definite case of don't judge a beer by it's cover. There is a nice classic pine + citrus combo going on here. Would definitely order if on tap or something but perhaps not hunt down in a trade or anything."
"A good IPA, I'm not a big IPA fan but I would happily drink this anyday."
"Taste is a well-done mix of citrus hops and a sweeter malt profile that balances it out. Finishes with a grapefruit tanginess. Pretty well a tasty and balanced IPA. Enjoyed it!."
"6/25/2011"
"O: This is one of the Michigan IPAs that is in my regular rotation when I buy IPAs. Very drinkable and especially enjoyed on a summer day."
"This is a very nice beer. I would quite like to have this again and seeing as how I live 40 minutes from the brewery that will likely happen sooner than later."
"This pours cloudy orange/brown with some sediment. There is moderate head and lacing and the beer is pretty active. The nose is citrus and malt. Flavor is pretty fresh and mild, very minimal yeast detectable...but it does leave a little of that mucky aftertaste. Overall, its fairly sweet. The body is medium and drinkable."
"Pours a dark orange brown with a frothy white head. The smell is dominated by hops. The flavor is much more than what the smell would suggest. The flavor starts sweet with a big hop flavor but has a great balance with the malt. The flavors are big but not overwhelming. This is the biggest hop flavor without any real bitterness to follow. The hop lingers on the palette for quite awhile after each sip. The mouthfeel is medium, smooth, and nice. Overall an IPA that is one that I could keep stocked in my fridge."
"Pours orange-ish with a solid head. Nose and flavor both heavily citrusy and piney hop flavors with a slight caramel malt flavor mitigating and providing a bit of balance. Finishes with a nice lasting bitterness and solid hop flavors. Really good, if perhaps unexceptional IPA that is exceedingly drinkable."
"Fluffy head with great retention. Good clarity and carbonation. Im sure closer to the brewing company this beer would smell different. I can't imagine I have the super fresh example here. But it is pleasantly hoppy, (citrus-pine aroma) just very mellow. Flavor is a sweet malt character mixed up with some nice citrusy hops. The decent A.B.V. content is only slightly noticeable in the flavor profile. Complimented by a very balanced bitterness. Bitterness isn't scorching or lingering. The acidity of the beer is right on, really enhances the flavors well. Pretty Dank Beer."
"has a complex malt character that leaves a sweet feel over the tongue. would purchase again."
"A good beer that I really enjoyed. Doesn't stand out but sometimes that's just what I like in a beer."
"O - This is a great example of an American IPA. The hops take the stage but don't blow your taste buds out while the malt backbone takes on a supporting role"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong with citrus and hops. Taste is very hoppy, good but the citrus in the aroma is not profound, very little malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O - Pretty good beer. A little sweeter which i enjoy in an IPA. Very smooth and high in drinkability."
"O: Would like to drink on draught one day to compare. But, would definitely try again if given the opportunity."
"This is a great representation of an American IPA great hops flavor without being overpowering. Try it if you can find it."
"Overall, great American IPA, one of my favorites for sure. Highly recommend giving this one a shot and not bad for a first IPA for someone."
"pours into my glass lookng like a water sample taken from a river. dark murky with lots of floaters. the only thing i liked about the look was the two finger head. smells like pine, cut grass and citrus. taste is kinda sweet at first than turns slightly dry and bitter. mouthfeel is pretty nice. crisp, clean and smooth with a dry finish. overall it's alright. dont know if i'll buy it again."
"Sampled a 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This is a cloudy and opaque dark golden color with a couple inches of head on top. Smell is fresh and hoppy with hints of pine and sweet sap. Taste is crisp and light with only mild hoppiness and easy drinkability. This is very refreshing and extremely well balanced. It is definitely not an extreme IPA, but solid nonetheless."
"Overall, a delicious beer. I was disappointed in the floaties, but was thoroughly surprised at how fruity and hoppily delicious this was. Would definitely buy again, and cannot wait to try the DIPA!"
"The CPJ"
"Overall a good IPA. I could definitely knock back a few of these without a problem."
"7.6/10"
"O – An ambivalent brew with a great nose but a real let down for me on the actual flavor and mouthfeel. I’d be willing to try this again to see if it was just the bottle I had."
"A standard IPA. Not bad, not great. Don't really remember where I first had this. Poured hazy, orange-brown, with some sediment. Organic aroma, earthy, grassy, which followed into the taste, along with a background of citrusy hops. Medium mouthfeel with some bitterness in the aftertaste. Average IPA."
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"I thought Double Crooked tree was boozy and sweet, but Crooked Tree is pretty good. It is definitely skewed toward a nice hop profile, but the malt provides a nice backbone."
"O (D) - Good beer, bit out of balance for my tastes. Will not seek out, but will gladly enjoy again."
"O- This is good stuff. For the positive, it's beautiful, balanced, and easy to drink. For the negative, the smell is a bit weak, and there don't seem to be any hop characteristics that punch me in the face."
"Overall this is a good beer. It comes very close to being great on so many levels. It could use a little more citrus in the profile, slightly more malty sweetness, and could have a little more body and carbonation. It is still a pleasure to drink and I would have it again."
"Classic IPA aroma: piney, floral, citrus out the wazoo. Mouthfeel has that resiny stickiness to it that really let's you know it's an IPA."
"A pretty solid IPA. A good one to have as a flagship, which I might want to call this. Worth having, not worth freaking out about."
"o - Overall a pretty solid IPA. nothing very much in any direction...good malt presence with the hops and the bittering is so subtle that it is nice, but like i said, more of a pale ale than an IPA. this is a good IPA that I would happily pick up regularly if it was available. good one for when you aren't looking for an all out hops assault."
"This one is hard to get a good head to it while trying to not mix all the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. I got a one finger high off-white creamy head and tons of sediment in the glass. This looks like a shaken up lava lamp due to a good bit of carbonation that keeps everything moving. Color is copper amber and the lace drapes the glass with a good bit of coverage. The nose is mostly filled with hops of fruity, citrus nature, but also a light spicy note like hops sprinkled with nutmeg. Some underlying biscuity sweet malts. The grapefruit is definitely there also. As for the taste, the hops and malts wrestle around some, but the hops really dominate. Those biscuity semi-sweet malts don't give up though and come on more as the beer warms. Hops are earthy and zesty with a solid grapefruit and lime rind quality. It has a total creamy mouthfeel and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is so creamy and tightly carbonated that it really makes it hard to nail down those tastes, since the flavors really bounce around, but it keeps you wanting more. Might give a bloating feeling if sessioned, but the 6% would be good, so tough to score. Last thoughts are that it went down really well and I could easily start another so, I'm putting on the higer side."
"Overall: A super solid AIPA -- nice flavors and a fully complimentary nose. Moderate ABV isn't too bad, clocking in at only 6%, I could easily get through a couple of these in a night, and would never have a problem drinking it in the hotter months of the summer."
"Excellent IPA that I would gladly have again."
"Overall, I like the brew. The floaters were interesting and the freshness might be in question, but it still tasted good."
"O-I was excited to see this in the Southern Illinois market but it fell a little short on my expectations.Decent,not great."
"This poured out a very hazy burnt copper with a frothy thick head. It clings to the sides of the pint glass in clumps. The aroma is extremely fruity with a lot of grapefruit but a lot of sappy pine cuts through. Some citrus notes but what IPA doesn't have that. There is a solid malt body as well which is dominated by a lot of caramel most likely just Am. two-row. The flavor is a lot of the pine sap upfront with a strong bitterness that carries through a malty caramel and sour/sweet grapefruit middle but with a huge amount of bitter dryness at the finish. As I breathe through my nose I get some lemon scents but it is quickly subdued by the overwhelming dry bitterness. The body is creamy at first but the body doesn't back up the heavy hops which makes them overwhelming."
"Pours a hazy dark hazy orange colour with pillowy white head. Some mild lacing, amazing head retention. Smells of juicy citrus and pine hops with lots of caramel malt. Very well balanced flavour, the taste starts off with bitterness, but finishes with a lot of sweetness. Aftertaste has a great resiny pine. Smooth mouthfeel. I really like this IPA."
"O: I fear that this beer is old. But I can't tell. So, I have to assume it's average in freshness for the consumer. The result: this is a bland, plain IPA. More like an amber with extra early bittering hops."
"Second bottle was vey impressive. No metallic aftertaste this time. Bright citrus nose and an impressive pine resin hop bite in the taste. It must be the water in Michigan for the state to have so many awesome IPAs."
"Pours a hazy golden color with 2 fingers of off white foam. Smell is dominated with malt. Don't get a whole lot in the way of hops. Just alright. Mild hops blend with a decent amount of malts in the flavor. Reminds me almost more of a pale ale than an IPA. Light amount of lingering bitterness that is pretty generic. Medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. Overall, this goes down pretty easy. Decidedly mediocre. Interesting trying this after bring familiar with double crooked tree, which is deservedly much more noteworthy."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color with a lot of visible floaties that are very unappealing. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is of mandarin oranges, grapefruit, and pine resin. The the taste has more pine than the aroma, and a sharp bitterness on the sip. The aftertaste mellows into a faint hint of grapefruit, then disappears very quickly. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent IPA, but there are much better examples of the style out there."
"Overall this is a stellar IPA that I would fall back on whenever I needed a hop fix or to enjoy an IPA style brew."
"Overall, you want extreme IPA hops, you got it. I enjoyed it. Followed 2 of these with a levitation ale, and everything is good"
"Pours out to a golden yellowish-orange body with a thick white head that has very good lacing, retention and carbonization. The smell is a pleasant aroma of herbal and floral hops along with some grass and pine. The taste is a grassy taste followed by some herbal and floral hops with a hint of pine. The herbal and citrus tastes seem to be very balanced making this a pleasant IPA to drink and the soft creamy smooth mouthfeel makes this an excellent IPA to try."
"Grade B+ 12 oz bottle Purchased at Stony's 6-pk $9.99."
"I like it."
"This beer is fantastic and at 6%, very drinkable. Deliciously balanced and tastes like it should be around 9-10%, very well done."
"Quaffable. Were did that bottle go?"
"Solid IPA, with great hops taste with an even body of to balance. My go to brew when I need an IPA fix. This brew is earthy, robust, and has a nice hops kicker. Great example of what an IPA shoud be without trying to overwhelm a brew with hops, but not drowning in other flavors. Crooked tree has got this IPA dialed in for the IPA fix."
"d- it was easy to put this one down and i could do another two or three. but i don't want another."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin and watered down for my taste. This is a solid beer but not an amazing one."
"O: Dark Horse's Crooked Tree IPA had been one of my ""wants"" for some time, and I'm stoked to tick this one off my list. This may not be the floral hop bomb I was expecting, but it is supremely good quality drinking none the less. Thumbs up."
"D- I order it every time I see it on-tap and send it out to friends. It is a midwest attempt at a west coast IPA. It is different from midwest IPAs and thus a nice addition for IPA choices."
"Overall a very nice rustic looking and tasty ipa."
"OVERALL: This is a really nice brew with a small error. If they haven't used pilsner malt in this one, then they've certainly used a malt profile that's made it just too grainy for the style. The wonderful hop profile has to compete with this grainy backbone the whole time. Revamp the malt bill, and this would be a real winner. In its current form, especially with the foamy beginning, I'll pass."
"D - A ton of hops for the abv. I could definitely drink a six-pack of this. Doesn't measure up to the best of the best of IPAs, but it is good for sure."
"Dark Horse continues to shine with this brew, and it seems like the batches get refined year after year. I'm looking forward to seeing more from them in the future."
"D - I avoided this one since it's obvious unfiltered but the sediment was rather high and it may have been old. Still to have an old beer give such a hop attack with such a low ABV would make me want to search out this monster fresh. As always well done Dark horse!"
"Drinkability (4): A very enjoyable beer but the beer tastes larger than the ABV indicates. This one feels like it could be 7.5 or 8%."
"D- goes down good, tastes good, can't ask for much more than that"
"D - Not as one dimensional as many reviews indicate. Then again, I love hop-forward IPAs. Would buy this again."
"Body-wise this beer is fine but the hops flavors (and malt flavor for that matter) are lacking. Not really what I've come to expect from an IPA."
"A good IPA but not a standout."
"Might need to return to this in the future, if I find one that I know is particularly fresh."
"Pours a ruddy amber color with bunch of floaties. Nice, small head that retains very well. Smells of citrus hops, lemon zest, and sweet malts. Tastes a lot less hop forward than I expected. Strong bready malt backbone with earthy and citrus hop flavors balancing it out....even some spicy hops going on. Mouthfeel is very prickly, like a belgian not like a BMC. Semi dry finish. Nothing to go goo goo gaga over but a solid IPA. Good flavor profile."
"For me not my typical IPA experience but will put this one on the ""try again"" list."
"D: Although this is a good beer, I was kind of expecting a little more. There was not as much hop flavor as I was hoping, even though it is a well balanced beer, I feel it's missing something that would put it over the top to a great beer."
"Overall I enjoyed this IPA. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was damn good. I would for sure pick up a six pack of this, seems like a good summer IPA. I hope to try the double version of this beer, keep up the good work Dark Horse."
"At 6% ABV, it is not as heavy bodied and malty as many IPAs, in contrast the palate is more crisp and dry. Appearance had a cloudy amber hue. Taste gave off a light citrus taste. A smooth and balanced IPA. The Crooked Tree IPA is earthier than a typical IPA with the right balance of hops. If you consider yourself a ""hop-head"" you owe it to yourself to grab this beer."
"On tap at brewery. Rich unfiltered amber color with copper head. Slight floral on the nose. Strong but not over powering hop character. Have had this beer in bottle but on tap is of course fresher, but too much carbination. Easy drinking IPA with medium to strong hops. Drinkable year round, best in spring or fall."
"A shallow but wide IPA - simple, yet takes up space. Good mouthfeel and a soft touch all around. Pleasant."
"Pours about 1 finger of head, dissipates and leaves nice lacing and a ring of head. hazy orange color. nice hops aroma, hops flavors are even more prevalent and quite nice. has a dry mouthfeel that is easy going, very drinkable. I like this beer very much, it is true to style and a great example of an American IPA."
"drinkability: would drink another one"
"Drink is pretty good. A very nice beer which I'd happily drink again and again."
"It is a delightful bottle, both in aroma and taste - very well balanced, yet hoppy enough to be tasteful... caramel, malts, hops & spices (of the fermented variety), all in all a great MI beer."
"D: With so many great IPAs readily available today, I don't see myself having this one again."
"Big thanks to nyrangerfan for this as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a murky yellow-orange with a four finger off-white head that subsided to two fingers slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and citrus/bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt and massively bitter hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall I'm not really sure how I feel about this one. Had a nice pungent aroma, but the flavor is kind of lacking though with a huge bitterness with no sweetness at all to balance it out. It is good for the ones who like massively hop intense beers, but that is about it."
"The taste is mild starts with a mouth full of carbonation. The hops enter very earthy with a subtle sweetness, it finishes with a strong bitterness."
"D) Delicious. Pour me another barkeeper!"
"Served in my stolen cigar city snifter from a 12oz bottle. Right off the bat i saw the thick cake of yeast on the bottom of the bottle, better pour carefully i thought. Got about 8oz in the snifter successfully without yeast transfer. Wow nice golden orange coloration with ample head and decent head retention. No lacing to speak of tho. Smells wonderful! Very inviting citrus and hop smells, just like an ipa should. Taste is outstanding, ideal ipa imo. A definate sipper since it abuses the senses with its hop attack but not as abusive as some ipa ive had. A great example of a well done ipa from a great craft brewery."
"Reviewed on 1/13/2010. Bottle. Pours a murky orange-brown with a small white head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and grassy hops. Flavor is sweet citrus initially with some light caramel malts. Nice hop profile. I thought it was similar to Racer 5 in these regards. Great IPA!"
"D/O- Not exactly an ""in your face"" IPA and that's alright because it means you can have more without killing your palate. A very drinkable IPA but nothing exceptional overall."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper color, and the head was white and creamy like. The aroma is very strong with citrus hops. The taste starts out a little sweet, but has a lingering citrus hop bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is medium light, and is overall a drinkable IPA."
"Another disappointing IPA with no freshness label. Story of my life. Beware."
"Drinkability -- At the end of the day Crooked Tree is a solid IPA, though not exceptional. Having had Double Crooked Tree, this was a mild disappointment. I'll come back to this one again if I ever see it on tap. Perhaps freshness was a factor?"
"Dirty copper color with a murky, viscous appearance. Thin white head after the pour that leaves a decent white cap and wet lacings. Resiny, earthy hop and biscuit aromas. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. Well balanced malt and hop flavors in the beginning that give way to a hoppy pine finish. After hearing good things about this IPA, I was generally disappointed. Maybe I'm sampling an out of date bottle. I look forward to trying this again sometime and hopefully updating my review."
"Beer is bitter and sulfury on the mid to late palate, overall its a chewy beer at medium body. Weak lead off but a strong hop presence in the second half of the mouth. Its a decent tasting IPA, easy drinking, just not very interesting."
"The beer presentation in the case was not very impressive. It would not have had me buy it unless recommended. I tired the beer and I surpised to see nearly 5mm of yeast at the bottom of each glass. I tired the beer at all types of tempatures. The first one I had was about 50 degrees and it was tasty and the malty and hop flavor was more pronounced. I the last one I had.... I stuffed it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it was very good and crisp. That would be my recommend way of drinking it."
"overall, this is a good beer that ican see myself getting again"
"Overall impression: Easy recommendation here."
"Drinkability is good, this one, while not exceptional or a stand-out, is a good middle of the road IPA."
"Drink is solid."
"Overall: Not a bad effort. This one is a solid example of the style, but not one that is going to make me race out to pick it up over others in the future."
"For the style, this one is spot on in my opinion - amazing hop to malt balance and incredibly drinkable. I could drink way too many of these. It is probably a good thing that I only bottle a single bottle."
"Drinkability is high, this is a fantastic IPA. I'm really impressed, one of the best I've had outside of the west coast."
"Pours copper in color with a good sized head and some lacing. In the nose, herbal and floral hops. This pulls through in the flavor, with grapefruit, zest and herb all making their presence known. A solid drinking IPA with a good balance of bitterness and malt sweetness. A nice beer from Dark Horse."
"Medium to medium-full body. Some prickly carbonation helps keep this drinkable. Nothing cloying or out of place. A very worthy IPA."
"D- Average at best, a little sediment can be good, but this seems to be extreme and really brings the beer down."
"D: I found this to be quite a drinkable IPA and would definitely see myself drinking a few...a bit high in ABV for a session brew, but 2 or 3 would be a great way to wind down after a long day."
"D: Its drinkable but for an IPA its too much on the sweet side. Disappointing as it offered so much in look and smell. Maybe the hops had died down from the tap I got but that was my experience with it."
"D: A very interesting IPA. Sort of a cross between a west coast and east coast IPA. I only got the single bottle but it is a good IPA. One I would want to try on draft."
"Very light bodied for and IPA but that makes it very easy to drink."
"D- Great for an IPA. Goes down easy without lacking flavor. Leaves you with a great aftertaste. Not gonna give you a hop ""bite", but it will deliver tons of hops in a smooth fashion."
"D: This one had so much potential from the start, but just fell short in body for me. Easily drinkable and sessionable, but the body and feel just wasn't there."
"Pretty solid, well rounded beer in each aspect. Another one I wish we had in NJ."
"Overall I think the appearance and the mouthfeel of this beer are the highlights."
"Future outlook: I loved their huge barleywine and their potent DIPA....the George Harrison tune that runs through my head every time I have their products notwithstanding, I must add this to the list of Dark Horse products that demand my repeat business."
"Overall, too much bitterness and yeast not offset by legitimate hop mouthfeel."
"4.0 D: I'm not sure how old this is. I imagine it's relatively fresh, but I really have no idea. It sat in my cellar for a month after being given to me as an extra in a trade (thanks!). Still, this is a good overall IPA, but the bottle conditioning does tend to cover up some of the hop flavor."
"The beer is a murky yellowish brown color with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is heavy with a strong hops smell, along with some citrus and caramel notes. The taste is very well-balanced with a decent hops bitterness, citrus sweetness and caramelized malt. The hops flavor isn't as strong as the smell leads you to believe, but there's enough there to know you're drinking an American IPA, maintain the beer's balance and not over-power you with bitterness. The malt character is hearty. The after-taste is slightly hoppy with a little bit of sweetness. Very smooth with a little crispness, medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish. Tasty, goes down very easy, not very filling, very good representation of style, what the beer lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in drinkability. I could certainly drink a good number of these and stick with it for an evening."
"Yup, lots of toffee and caramel sweetness with a bit of toast up front and then a coating, lingering hop bittering comes on strong. Some hop flavors, but not as much as I would like. Most notable to me is the dichotomy of the earthy malt base and the vibrant hop character, they play interestingly well off each other...kinda like saltwater taffy wrapped around a fresh hop cone. The more I drink it the more I like it...a little swirling knocks some of the carbonation out and gives it a smoother, hoppier mouthfeel. Good IPA here, would like to give it a go on tap next time I find myself up north."
"Had this one on tap at Smokey Bones today. Just the slightest haziness to this amber/orange brew with a finger of off-white head...colors probably appeared darker than actual due to low lighting. Super aroma consisting of grapefruit and pine. Very hop forward scent, which I'm a big fan of. As far as taste, the hops come across mostly as grapefruit rather than the pine that your nose told you to expect. This is seriously easy drinking and the bittery sweet finish paired perfectly with my smoked wings. Without question, I will have this again."
"Poured to a two fingered thick bubbly head. Head was tan in color. Ale itsself was very hazy with lots of floaties, and light brown in color. Head hung around quite a while and had some good lacing. Smelled of caramel, also had a slight citrus pine smell. I thought the smell was kind of light. To me it tasted more of a Brown Ale. Had a bitter aftertaste. Also notes of pine, caramel, yeast and a slight citrus taste. I thought it also had a sweet flavor in there also. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good. Id buy again. I just think it was nothing out of the ordinary. I expected more of a hoppy citrus taste and it wasnt there."
"That the ABV and price are moderate is another plus."
"D) Delicious. Pour me another barkeeper!"
"Poured this one into a pint glass. The pour is darker than I expected from an IPA. Dark orange and cloudy. The pour gives a thin white head and spotty lacing. The aroma is bitter through and through with hints of grass,citrus and an undertone of sweet malts. I'm really into the way this smells, especially since I don't know how old it is. The taste is bitter from start to finish with just a hint of juiciness. Not bad, but not very complex at all. The mouthfeel is thin and watery. I thought this looked heavier than it is. I'm typing this as I'm drinking it and I'm not sure that I'm going to finish. It's not the worst beer I've had but I liked the Double Crooked Tree a lot more and I've got other stuff I'm itching to have."
"D - Pretty good, but it drinks a little bigger than it is at 6%. I'll definitely have it again, but probably would rather have their Double Crooked Tree in the end. All in all, this is an IPA that should be tried if you have access to it."
"Terrific IPA! Another great one from the state of Michigan!"
"D - Very very drinkable and reminds me quite a bit of the Double (supposedly just a doubling of this recipe). The balance of this beer is probably what leads the Double to be more of a barleywine than DIPA."
"D-Very, very drinkable. A bit pricey in my area but well worth the fee."
"goes down pretty easy, especially on a hot summer day. a solid beer all around and great example of the style."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of off white head. It is amber colored. The aroma fruity, peach, pear, orange, grapefruit. The taste starts out with the seet fruits and finishes with grapefruit. The taste is somewhat subdued compared to the smell. I was hoping for more of a flavor explosion. This is a solid IPA. I would definately drink again. I look forward to trying the double."
"Overall: A good IPA that relies more on the strength of the malt but the fresh fruit makes it quite enjoyable."
"Goes down easily, could drink it easily as an anytime beer. I'll be buying this beer again and again."
" Mouthfeel is great - lively carbonation with just enough body to hold the assertive flavors. At the same time, it's a great vehicle for the vibrant, fresh hoppy flavors that predominate in this beer. Overall, very enjoyable, probably the most drinkable hoppy beer I've encountered from the middle of the country."
"Pretty good drinkability with a moderate ABV for an IPA. Crooked Tree is not overpowering with hops or bitterness. It was my first brew from Dark Horse in Marshall and complimented grilling. Crooked Tree is a decent session beer."
"D - weird issue with the carb here, the beer starts off great then falls just vanishes in the mouth...not sure if more body would solve this. almost ruins an otherwise good IPA."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Notes: Definitely drinkable. The beer is very light and tastes/feels good"
"Meh. OK. Non-offensive, but nothing to recommend a 2nd turn..."
"Very good structure, much bitterness, I like that. Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp."
"The carbonation is medium strong; the short-lived bubbles are fresh. The liquid is a bit thin."
"Further thoughts: This does differ considerably from someof the other AmIPAs I've had, and it will make me consider really giving darkhorse another real chance. I enjoyed this thoroughly."
"I guess it's worth mentioning that part of the reason why I gave this brew such a favorable review is because a) it surprised me because I haven't heard the best things about this beer and b) it is much less syrupy, sweet, and boozy than it's big brother, Double Crooked Tree. Whereas I feel that Double Crooked Tree is more of a barley wine, Crooked Tree is a nice, light drinking, true IPA that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Very cloudy orange-copper pour with a nice caramel-white head and great lacing. Darker than the average IPA. Nice earthy, spicy, citrusy nose with hints of pine and a sweet malt. Fresh, bold taste with great balance between the slightly spicy, citrusy, bitter hop bite and sweet malt backbone. Lots of grapefruit, pine with a touch of bitter resin and perfect sweetness on the finish. Very smooth and slightly chewy make this extremely drinkable. Was wishing I had another by the time I finished. Wasn't familiar with Dark Horse prior to this, but will definitely seek out more from them. A great IPA."
"Overall a pretty average IPA, maybe a little above average. Pours very nice, has a fruity scent to it, bitter taste. Darker in color than many, has a fruity flavor to it as well. Decent hops, something seems to be missing for me, I feel like I am almost smelling/tasting yeast in it, which I have never tasted in the style. Not the best combo in the world, but all right, not sure I'd say go out and buy it over the other hundreds of good IPAs out there. A bit of a let down."
"With the somewhat dirty appearance, I am surprised more reviewers didn't slam it. I think may be because they are using their good taste that tells them that this is a worthy brew."
"A slightly above average ipa, nothing great, nothing bad, but if you're going to have a dark horse ipa drink the double crooked tree."
"The taste is really hoppy. There is largely an IPA with ample orange blossom estery hop flavors, a touch of pine but of the really bittering sort, some other assorted bitter florals from the juices of the hop. The beer has a fairly malt mid section but it probably needs to be a touch heavier and weightier to balance the really bittering flavors. There is a very drying, mouth puckering, and moisture evaporating quality to the mouthfeel. There is definitely a combination of hops in this beer given its complexity and the slightly different experiences you get with each sip. This is no single hop IPA. It's a good IPA, a bit too much IBUs for my taste, a touch thin in the middle, a bit too drying in the finish too."
"D: A very drinkable and delicious IPA"
"D: This brew performs great right out of the gate but the taste, mouthfeel and drinkability suffers considerably. I find the Crooked Tree to be too light, while the Double Crooked Tree is too strong. Dark Horse has been hit or miss for me, and lately missing more often than not. They need a few more wins under their belt to win me back over."
"D: Well-made."
"D - Easy drinking balanced IPA. Good grapefruit flavor in this one. An enjoyable IPA for sure but nothing mind blowing. I would pick this up again the next time I go to Michigan but would not go crazy trying to get it."
"The flavor is more balanced than the aroma. I couldn't detect the smell of malt but the flavor starts that way. The hop remains the strongest flavor and the alcohol warmth is also present. The body adds to the experience."
"Libation: I really like this beer and I'm quite impressed with Dark Horse's ability to deliver so much flavor atop a 6% ABV offering. So many IPAs try to do to much, but the flavor, balance, and drinkability are all sot on here."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much special, but decent. Don't hunt this one. I heard the double crooked tree was good, but this one is nothing special. Don't hunt this one. Try it if you have access when there's nothing else to try."
"D- A little on the filling side, but a damn satisfying drink anyway."
"D: High. this is a nice, solid, but easy brew."
"Cheers"
"Overall, a classic North Coast IPA. Snappy, tasty, with a well-balanced malty/citrus/hoppy/bitterness that ties together nicely. Well done!"
"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a hazy amber with some particulate matter floating in the solution. Head was 1.5 inches, cream-colored and more foamy than frothy. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap, with some thin strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Aromas reveal grapefruit and a hint of piny resin on a slightly malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose - very nice balance between sweet and bitter, with a little alcohol coming out at the back and some resinous bitterness that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a somewhat prickly carbonation that leaves some residual burn in the mouth. A solid IPA with a nice balance; however, a little too much carbonation affects the drinkability slightly. I would love to try this on cask if the opportunity ever presented."
"M/D: Medium bodied with some good carbonation. Overall, I like it, but don't love it. It is pretty easy drinking and would be happy to have it again, just not my favorite."
"D: Excellent flavor and very fresh tasting. Hoppy as hell! I have had Imperial IPA's less hoppy than this beer. It is delicious but in the end the bitter aftertaste is too much for my tongue and I would not easily go for another in succession."
"This is a nice, clean IPA that makes a good everyday IPA. This is an updated review (from 2/8/2012.) The first bottle I had was a little dated and had some off flavors. I am glad to have a chance to re-review."
"D: Ehhh, this beer has potential, but overall was a let down and has some major flaws. The double crooked tree is done much, much better and would be my go to beer from dark horse. It's amazing that simply ""doubling the ingredients"" can make such a drastically different and better beer."
"(mobile review)"
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and goes down pretty well. The carbonation was at just the right amount so it gave the beer a bit of a fizz but was not so much that it dried out each sip. A really good IPA that has a American flavor."
"D - Decent Abvs make the drinkability pretty high on this one.. i could easily put away a few of these... stinks we can't get in CT.. this warrants more visits up to table and vine or julios...."
"Drinkability: This is about as drinkable as they come. One sip follows the next easily as the dryness invites more liquid. As I look at the glass I wonder that it has gone down so smoothly and quickly. Having another will be easy and in fact my next one will be started just as soon as this one is finished. ☺ There is no question this beer has found a permanent place on my shopping list to be enjoyed again."
"D: The IPA feels much, MUCH stronger than 6%. An imposing IPA that goes down very easily."
"D: This is a good go to IPA, nothing special, but quality."
"D: Very drinkable. The hops are upfront, but not palate killing. This is a solid American IPA."
"Notes: This i.p.a is very well done glad I picked this one up. Cheers."
"D - I had been looking forward to trying this IPA for awhile and it didn't disappoint. Very nice IPA."
"Drinkability is also superb. I could drink this one all night. They should have just called this a pale ale. I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't think I was about to drink an IPA. I guess I'm just spoiled when it comes to IPA's since I'm from CA."
"pours a copper brown color, very cloudy/hazy. large white creamy head and good lacing. strong piney, citrus smell. taste is much the same with some floral hints. medium body, and thin texture. moderate bitter chalky finish, and average flavor duration. pretty good brew."
"D: Light and refreshing, not too heavy on the palate and a nicely balanced bitter /sweet balance make this brew highly drinkable. Pour me another!"
"D: drinks very well all the way through for an IPA. This stayed true to the style coming from a west coast hop head."
"This is a very drinkable beer...a top notch IPA that can compete with Two Hearted."
"Mouthfeel is good... Fairly light and well carbonated. Nothing too special here. The drinkability is fantastic, though again that could be due to my workday."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's a pretty tasty and easy to drink IPA. It didn't have any wild or outstanding characteristics, just more of a standard, very well made IPA."
"DB- Standard six pack price with good qualities all around. A balance of hop flavor and bitterness is achieved fairly well. I am glad to see Dark Horse in my area and will try more of their beer after having this one."
"d - excellent, a great ipa. incredibly well-balanced and drinkable."
"Pours hazy, fairly deep amber that is slightly copper in color. It has a very nice slightly off white head that has decent retention and nice lacing. The aroma is surprisingly tame. Grapefruit and citrus hops for sure, but it is not as in your face as many of this style that I have had. Also, I detect some bready malt. The flavor is more of the same. A bit too malty for an IPA in my opinion, but the hop profile is quite nice, and it possesses a definite firm bitterness. Very balanced, perhaps too balanced. The mouthfeel is medium with a finish that is a bit sweet. Fairly drinkable, but really not one I would seek out again."
"drinks ok. a good amount of bitterness and oily feel keep this from going down easy."
"Drinkability: An above average IPA that has an excellent blend of hops. Something to sip and relax with. I would not rush to get this, but would not pass it by either."
"D- high. could drink them all night."
"Dark orange IPA color, but was kinda taken back by the amount of sediment in the glass. Ive never seen this much sediment left in a glass even from bottle conditioned beer. Very good and strong citrus and hoppy flavor. Would buy again, definitely a nice IPA if you like the hops."
"Had this within the first hour that City Tap House in Philly was open, even before official opening. Possibly first customers? Poured a dark orange amber with frothy white head, good lacing and retention. Smell was bready and sweet malts with sweet and bitter citrus, very fruity. Taste was sweet and roasty malts up front, then very fruity and oily hops. Great IPA, very interesting, uniquely balanced yet still massively hoppy. Excellent."
""
"D: A really nice IPA and while it's no Two Hearted, it's one I would keep around."
"F: Bitterness hits harder on the finish. More musty fresh wet hops and hop oils with more chewy hop flavors. Some bitter orange peel with more citrus hops and touch of tangerine and hint of grapefruit. The bitterness lingers for a long time too. Overall a nice tasty west coast style IPA."
"Drinkability: Overall I think this is a pretty sessionable beer. Wasn't truly impressed by the flavor at the outset, but it's gotten a lot better as it warmed. Appearance-wise the lacing is pretty incredible - there's still some at the top of the glass! Whereas I would have given this a C initially, its stock has risen a whole lot since; B+."
"the drinkability is good, the bitterness is crisp and clean, with lots of hop flavor and enough malt to keep it from being one dimensional. a very good IPA, with some surprising balance."
"12 ouncer$3.50 per bottle from Capones out side of Philadelphia. No freshness info to be had. Pours murky darker almond amber. Rich and frothy darker tan head, stays around for a good long while, leaves slippery sheeting and ample trailers of fine lacing. I smell a ""west coast style"" IPA here with a rich grapefruit nose, shining through. More grapefruit, some smoky leathery notes and a healthy dose of grainy hop goodness. Tasty and enjoyable IPA. Glad I was able to try it, but kinda pricey to be an every day tipple."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great here, if I wasn't sharing this growler, I would have no problem finishing this off myself. Overall, this is one of the better IPA's I've had. I was lucky enough to get a growler of this directly from the brewery, and it was fantastic. This would be my go to IPA if I had regular access to it. Great job! Skal."
"Amazing IPA! Right up my citrus loving alley. Better when fresh, like all other IPAs."
"This beer is kick-ass. Dark Horse is just an amazing brew-pub. I wish I lived closer and could join the mug club!"
"Pours a muted oranage color with some haze, a nice white cap of foam, good retention and lacing. Smell is of citrus hops with a faint touch of sweetness one you dig below the hops. Taste is citrus and tropical fruits backed with a nice sweet biscuty malt background. Nothing too complex but fantastic none the less. Body is medium, perfect carbonation level. An excellent IPA, perfect hop blend with a great malt presence."
"M/D: It has a medium to high carbonation, mouth feel is a little thin. Overall this is a pretty good beer, I think it is great since I got a fresh batch. It's hard to say since I had DBL Crooked Tree first, which is simply amazing, but this is solid cousin."
"Overall, a tasty example of a style that can be all over the place in terms of quality. I think this one may have faded a bit, but even if it has, it's still a tasty beer that's more than drinkable. Kudos for tipping the scales at 6% too, every little bit of sessionability helps."
"Drinkability: Overall a good value for what I paid for it and would drink again."
"D= Very drinkable IPA here. Interesting flavor with an ABV and bitterness that makes this one an easy drinker."
"Drinkability is good. Overall a good American IPA but there are better. I love Dark Horse's dark beers - this is just a bit better than the average. Now, if you double the hops and malt, we've got a different story to talk about."
"D- Good session type IPA, nothing exceptional in the world of IPAs but still an enjoyable beer"
"D- Overall I would have to say this is a pretty standard offering for an IPA. Goes down nicely but seems to not be anything outstanding."
"D-This is just fine for an IPA but there are so many others better. I could drink this all night and be happy but it clearly lacks special qualities...kind of a workman like IPA...blue collar IPA maybe...."
"D- Overall I would have to say this is a pretty standard offering for an IPA. Goes down nicely but seems to not be anything outstanding."
"D: Goes down easy, pretty tasty. This isn't an IPA to knock your socks off but it's worth a pint or two."
"Pours pale burnt orange with a lot of floaters. Minimal head. Smells mildy sweet, malty and fresh. The taste is very balanced, understated like the middle of the IPA road. The malt lingers with just a hint of bitterness. All in all very good IPA that I could keep drinking. It isn't over the top in any way, just good."
"D- This beer like most from Dark Horse is very drinkable. This may have been a little bit of a off review as I tried this after the Double Crooked Tree. Good beer that I don't mind buying sixers of time and time again. Great job Dark Horse!"
"This bottle is probably 6 months out, hard to say, but it's still tasty beer and quite interesting to try the baby brother to Double Crooked Tree. Worth your while, just mind that sludge!"
"I will admit I am biased on the drinkability of this one. I happen to pick this one and the Lagunitas IPA quite regularly... I have tossed back enough in one jam session to call it a ""session," but the ABV is a tad high to really call this a session beer. Just a good beer to have before dinner (perhaps while firing up the grill!)"
"D - This is a decent IPA, nothing earth shaking but pretty solid nonetheless."
"D_Great session ipa."
"D-When fresh the dominating orange character of this brew is a true standout. Melded nearly perfect with the sweetness of the malt this is a tough one not to enjoy!"
"D-Fantastically drinkable IPA. I could really see it being a staple, go to beer for me. Really surprised by this one after a few misses I've had from Dark Horse."
"The beer pours a murky orangish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is citrus - mainly bitter oranges. The flavor is bitter oranges and the overall bitterness is medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: A solid IPA. Definitely holds it own among the many other competitors. Nothing makes it really stand out a ton though. Really drinkable. I'll definitely have it again."
"mouthfeel is quite thin, so hops are allowed to carry the day without being too extreme in their own right."
"D- extremely tasty. Will be visiting this one again soon."
"D: This is a very approachable IPA though I wish the alcohol wasn't so obvious though it does work to some degree because of the malt and the fairly toned down hops."
"Poured bottle into a tulip glass and was impressed with the coloring, a deep orange gold. Smelled really nice with pine hops the dominant tone. Taste was the best quality about this beer. A nice balance between the hops and malts with a grapefruit twang and a sharp, crisp bitterness that i really liked. Mouthfeel was not unlike others of it's kind and went down easily. Pleasant drinking experience that will have me no doubt picking up more on my next trip to the beer store!"
"D- Smooth drinking a special IPA!"
"""Intense Transfer Method," I like it."
"D. This is well balanced and quite drinkable. It slides down way too easily - a few in a session would be perfect. I am impressed with this offering and highly recommend it - especially if you like your IPA's on the balanced side."
"This was the first beer I had back in America after being away for over a year. It delivered! It satisfied my hop deprived palate and was a solid true to style IPA. My senses were a little obliterated after traveling for over 24 hours and being congested but this IPA was bold enough to slice through all that and show its colors."
"D - goes down smooth but controled."
"Pours from the bottle to a hazy, dull orange with thin white skim that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. True to its style, the nose is strong hoopy grapefruit citrus. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slightly tingly and pleasantly bitter. Taste picks up the strong grapefruit in the nose, and the finish is long and dry. Darn good beer."
"Overall- Nicely balanced. I see cases of this around, I'll have to pick some up."
"D - Solid beer, would drink again."
"Why do people always argue about East Coast vs. West Coast IPAs? Doesn't anyone ever think about the Midwest; the number of quality IPAs coming out of Michigan alone is amazing."
"It stated out great, but the lack of mouthfeel dropped the score for me. A great IPA, no doubt, and one I will gladly have again."
"I'm happy w/ the single of this brewery's IPA - brings all the quality attributes with just a solid amount of sessionability."
"The beer pours a golden-copper color with a clingy white head and just a bit of dry hop haze. The aroma is remarkably fresh hop--citrusy, lemony and slightly piney. There is also a bit of caramel sweetness behind all the hops. The flavor is moderate-high hops--pine with high hop bitterness. Beneath all the hops a sweet flavor is noticeable a bit different and I can't really put my finger on it. The carbonation and body are both medium. Overall a very tasty IPA with a bit of underlying malt."
"D: This isn't the best IPA I have had, nor the worst. I would consider it a better than average IPA that is easy to drink from a brewer I haven't had before."
"Had this on tap and in the bottle many times both ways. In the bottle this is a good IPA...on tap its a whole different story. All the citrus notes come out so much more on-tap. I've never had quite the experience with the difference of bottled vs on-tap as Crooked Tree"
"A good everyday ipa, though once the case is done it will be awhile before I look to revisit. Worth trying however."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: All together this was a nice IPA. Nothing too special, but a decently complex and well crafted example of the style. At 6% this is a nice 'standard'"
"D: I could have a case of these sitting in the fridge. Very good. G;eat offering from Dark Horse Brewing"
"(Yeah, overall it's just a bit too hop-forward. It's a good beer, worth your time, but just not my preferred interpretation of the style.)"
"D - Very drinkable! The whole thing hangs together very well and showcases its ingredients to their advantage. This IPA manages to be zealously hoppy without entirely losing the malt."
"Medium body with pretty high carbonation. Drt finish with lingering bitterness. The alcohol is not even noticeable and I could drink these all day. This is a really good beer."
"This is more like APAs I brew as opposed to an IPA."
"Overall: Pretty tasty. Different from any ipa I've had. Not sure if it's the yeast or unfiltered nature, or even a west coast ipa style w/midwest ingredients? It seems to work. Could imagine the Double version being epic."
"This is one I've enjoyed a few times but now that I'm reviewing it, I notice that's it's a bit over the hill age wise. Still, not bad overall. The hazy, cloudy beer is a murky apricot and gold hue. No head on this one, slight ring came and went. Sweet caramel honey aroma is inviting and yet still a bit hoppy as well. Taste offers pineapple, citrus rind, some toffee flashes lend another dimension to it with a malty finish. Mouthfeel is substantial, nice body, cleansing hoppiness yet with nice malt balance. Refreshing, very drinkable and sastisfying IPA, Dark Horse makes my day again."
"Very smooth creamy body on this. Slight buttery feel. This is one of those IPAs that doesn't smack you upside with grapefruit and nothing else. Plenty of bitter hops in this, leaving a slight piney resin leftover. But there's shadows of sweetness in the middle. Bitterness is moderate. Nothing harsh or scalding, just a well-made IPA. Get some."
"Good solid IPA with much better than average aroma."
"D-for only 6% alcohol this goes down very nice. I would say that it is relatively hoppy, but it is not a hop explosion. It is slightly balanced; but still favors the hops side."
"This hop leaning balance translates well in the taste. Very well . A bubbly start that is all melon and caramel. full and chewy. I get a hint of tobacco, oak and even gamey meat towards the top and back. This would pair well with bigger white and some dark meats. The finish fills with prickly hoppiness. Just enough viscosity to pool in my throat. a light bitterness lingers. I think this is a great example of an american IPA. again, mouthfeel is the underrated secret."
"Kindly special ordered by Festival in Fond du Lac. Pours light amber with beautiful head. Very frothy almost like whip cream and a lot of lacing. Unfiltered which is definately ok. Aroma is fruity and floral. Good bitterness (grapefruit/citrusy), but also some good malt character in the foreground (which I like in an IPA)."
"There was no date on the bottle and when I opened it, I simply began pouring, only to get some sludge from the bottom. Whoops! I got a finger of medium-tan head with low retention. The color was a hazy deep amber, thanks to my inattention. Nose was full of resinous piney hops. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium with a solid hops flavor. Very resinous, piney, everything that I enjoy in an American IPA. Yum. Finish retained that same flavor. This would be worth having again."
"D: This isn't my favorite IPA, but it's a solid beer and it goes down smooth."
"Bull's-eye when it comes to the style its aiming for. Drinkability is high and with only 6.0 percent ABV it's a borderline session ale; at least in our book it is. IPA freaks should seek this beer out."
"I really want to rate this beer by my past experiences but to be fair I am rating the bottle in front of me. This will definitely be one to review with a fresh bottle. Even with the less desirable traits which came along with the age we still have a solid beer."
"This beer got better as it warmed up to about 55-58 Fahrenheit, which is unusual because most IPAs that I try are at their peak aroma/taste around 50-52. Would go back and review it after letting it sit for 10 minutes if I had another one...."
"D - I was really impressed with this IPA...I'm glad it came to PA and it's here to stay...this is now one of my favorite IPA's and I'm sure it's just a tad better on tap"
"mid body beer. good carbonation. good beer. enough said."
"This might be the opposite of the ""I guess I got a bad bottle"" review -- this one was a lot more enjoyable than its siblings. Will need to seek out more to confirm, but this bottle lived up to the hype. Gives the other Michigan IPAs a run for their money, very good."
"A very nice, medium bodied beer, with ample carbonation and a nice clean, hop character. Feels very good in the mouth, not quite as ""juicy"" as the aroma led me to believe, but overall a great IPA!"
"Pours bright slightly hazy golden and orange with white fluffy head. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, apricot and flower. Flavor is round and apricotty with a citrus edge and a round bitterness that develops on the back end. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick."
"I've noticed over the years if a brewery makes a kick-ass IPA that it is generally safe to assume they make many a kick-ass beers; that is certainly the case with Dark Horse. This tiny, out of the way cottage shack of a brewery sure pounds out some beers with big, assured and often swaggering personalities - Crooked Tree is undoubtedly one of them."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I believe this is the best IPA I've tried thus far. (Although, I admit that I still have a lot more to try)"
"An extremely average IPA. Last weekend I had some of the best IPAs I have ever tasted, so there is a high bar set for me. This one was well under."
"Drinkability-I don't think i could drink alot of this, just wasn't too exciting. Became very flat very fast."
"Drinkability: easy to consume this IPA as the flavors are well balanced and it comes off as a bit refreshing. Worth a try."
"This is easily one of my personal favorite beers I have ever had. Have been a big fan for almost a year to it and am still pretty loyal to it and there are only a couple ipa's I have had that can hang or sit next to it. Its nice and bitter and has a lot of flavor. For the price I have yet to have one to be topped. This one is a MUST try, I guarantee you will at least enjoy it."
"Had this on tap at the Blind Pig in Champaign. Overall a good looking and smelling beer with a nice effervescence to it, but overall it doesn't stand out too much; not exceptionally memorable. Still very drinkable, but I'd take a 2 Hearted over this any day of the week."
"Overall- this is surely up there with michigan ipa's. don't know if it beats bell's two hearted ale but can definitely hang in the ring with it."
"There's nothing wrong or worth getting excited about this beer and sometimes that's what you want. Maybe this has been around too long and lost it's hop profile. Now that Dark Horse is in the Philly market I'll try it again to see if I might get a fresher bottle. I still think brewers are hurting themselves when they don't put ""bottled on"" dates."
"Pours an amazing orange color, copper, golden edges, with a dense 1cm off-white head. Leaves just a bit of lacing. A nice cloud of haze descends at the end of the pour, but the beer is nice and clear otherwise. The smell is nice and resinous, with a great cakey, biscuity malt sweetness. Though oddly, it seems like I can smell the alcohol, or maybe just something harsh, and a bit yeasty. It smells solid, but it seems like it could be cleaned up a little. The taste is very similar to the smell. Starts out with a lot of malt, with some sweet orange on top, like a toasty, or almost orange flavored coffee cake taste. The malt presence here is nice, but the hop presence is not overshadowed. Very interesting. I still feel like there is an alcohol presence I can detect, which seems strange, or maybe there's a bit too much of an estery presence. The body on this is very good. A bit fuller than medium, with a good rush of carbonation. It is a little grassy and vegetal I think, but otherwise, this one is really very nice. This one is an enjoyable drink, interesting, not exactly one-dimensional. The alcohol presence surprises me, but I enjoyed it. Could probably drink a few in a night."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a one finger head with poor retention and a thin lace. Smells of orange and grapefruit citrus hops. Ditto for the flavor. Also some pine needle flavor. Very little malt backbone. Medium bodied, and decent carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. A little too unbalanced for me. I wish more malt would come through. A good beer for hop heads, and worth trying again for me."
"Tree poured a hazy amber with a moderate head that quickly reduced to a skin. The aroma was citrus. The taste was also citrus with a pine needle aftertaste. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall, Crooked Tree was a solid entry into the IPAs, although not my favorite IPA."
"D - This one goes down pretty easily. Bitterness is subtle, not in your face. Lots of flavors mingling together in a well rounded fashion. Alcohol is on the low side, but surprisingly adds noticeable flavor to the beer. Interesting and well balanced IPA."
"D= super drinkable. Possibly one of my new favorite ""casual"" ipas. Great brew."
"All around a very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is normal for the style...this is a pretty solid IPA but I would have to know for sure that it was fresh before I bought it again"
"D - A fine IPA, very nice balance w/ lots of hop flavor and decent feel, for the abv it is very drinkable and has a decent amount of bitterness, a very sessionable beer"
"Cloudy orange with a nice off white head that lasts until the last sip. Incredible nose of bready sweet malt, a little yeast, and big citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety with the perfect amount of carbonation. The flavor starts with a very nice, balanced toffee and pink grapefruit flavor which is strangely delicious. The finish is incredibly long and builds in intensity after the swallow - first with a wash of citrus and then a lingering bitterness and a hint of alchohol warmth. In my opinion, the best offering from DH, and one of my ""go to"" IPA's. World class."
"M&D- The feel is medium bodied with a nice balanced taste although the malt seems to be winning. Either way this goes down smooth and the carb does not get in the way. Not very bitter at all. The ABV is low giving the drinkability a boost but I am indifferent on this particular IPA. Give it a whirl."
"D: this is a solid solid brew, an IPA to remember. Dark Horse IPA is truly a fizzy lifting drink"
"Thanks John!"
"Overall, the Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA is a tough act to follow when it comes to IPA's. As with all Dark Horse's brews, it's not meant to slam, but rather it's a VERY high quality craft brew with great characteristics. I'll have another..."
"D - As noted, definitely a sessionable IPA. I'd like to give this one another try without allowing it to mellow out."
"All I could ask for in an American IPA."
"D - this is a pretty decent IPA. I am very anxious to try the Double Tree IPA from this brewery. However, when it comes to purchasing from this brewery, I think I'll stick to their ridiculous line-up of stouts..."
"Beer pours a very deep hazy reddish gold color. Huge thick head and visible sediments floating in the beer. Smells of hops, floral mainly. Taste is bitter with a slight malt backbone and a hoppy finish. Full mouthfeel with a slight oily feel, good body for an IPA. This is a very drinkable IPA, almost like a combination of Two Hearted and Centennial, I like it."
"This is a drinkable IPA, I like the balance of the hop flavors as well as the smooth mouthfeel."
"From a couple of IPAs, this was the one I enjoyed the most. Although aroma was slightly dissapointing and taste seemed to be rather simple initially, it seemed to become better and better with each sip. Perfect."
"D - Besides the completely hazed appearance, it's a winning beer all around that is crisp and refreshing. Good IPA."
"Pours a dark golden-amber with miniature flocculent deposits that are evenly dispersed. As a consequence the ale is cloudy. I can see the outline of my fingers if I hold the glass towards a light source. Highly evident and attractive aroma hops. Large off-white head with bearded Belgian lace. Medium body and nice texture with noticeable bitterness on the palate and bitter citrus pith notes in the lingering. Malt comes forth to balance the hops. Hints of baked bread. Makes me think of caramelized bread crusts. Notes of pine and spruce. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate. Honey can be found if you seek it."
"D: Very solid beer, I really enjoyed it. Not the best in the world but highly sessionable."
"Had this a while back but took notes. Poured a cloudy dark orange color with frothy white head that left good lacing. Smelled very hoppy and citrusy. Tasted of piney hops and malt. Slighlty overcarbed but smooth. Finished this one pretty quickly too."
"This would be a good one to introduce to the non-converted. Loved their DIPA, but maybe I was expecting too much out of this one. It is a solid brew, very non-offensive."
"This is a good beer. I probably enjoy this more aged than fresh. There are much more subtle flavors and aromas going on. The hop presence is still there, but obviously muted a bit. Give it a try aged if you think all IPA's should be enjoyed fresh. It is interesting."
"A very smooth medium bodied brew. A nice balanced IPA. Glad I nabbed this guy in Michigan. They sure know how to brew 'em."
"This beer pours a hazy reddish brown color leaving about 3/8 inch of slightly off white head. Chill haze is appearant, however this leaves as the beer warms up. Typical citrus smell with pine. This may sound wierd but I get a certain scotch tape smell that detect in a lot of ipa's and I find it in this one too. Some may consider it a flaw but I like it. This is a tasty ipa. A very pleasing bitterness overcomes the sweet malt. Tastes of pine, liquid smoke, and lemon also come through. This has a bit more carbonation then most ipa's that I have had. A crispy bitterness greets the tounge with each sip. This ipa wasnt bad however for the price I can find something a lot better."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a murky amber/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. It smells like citrusy (pineapple and grapefruit) and piney hops, along with some caramel malt. Head retention is OK, lacing is good. However, the aroma seems to be a bit weak. The taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes similar to the aroma, but there's also a bit of peppery spice, lemon zest and honey noticable too. There's also a slight bitter hoppy aftertaste. Good balance between the hops and malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and dry and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink and it's quite enjoyable. I think this is a decent enough brew, I'd pick this up again."
"Medium body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. Very easy to drink. Perhaps a bit tame for an IPA, but very enjoyable."
"(D)- What a wonderfully balanced AIPA. Its would be so easy to have one after another. Bitter yet sweet and almost silky smooth to boot. A superb effort, and one of my new favorite IPAs."
"I would characterize this beer as being highly drinkable. I would reach for this beer if it were available again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability- I must say, this beer goes down nice and easy. I can easily see myself drinking six of these bad boys in an evening. One of my first, and one of my favorite IPAs."
"Once again a Michigan brewery hits the mark"
"Overall, a decent beer. It is definitely leaving something to be desired though...something in the middle...like a good, creamy malt character to balance out the bitterness of the hops...a drinkable IPA nonetheless."
"Taste follows nose closely. Lots of grapefruit, small bit of pine. Little malt sweetness. Feels slick on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink."
"This is a reasonably drinkable beer. It is not so intense that you can only have one but still provides a decent flavor."
"Jordan."
"Drinkability: Very high, and the beer adds really nice dimension to the flavor as it warms. Really recommend trying this on tap if you get the chance."
"One of the sites I remember finding out about this one from had it rated like an A- I believe. I just don't get it."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed apricot color with an inch of dense off white foam. The head lingers for about half the glass, leaving behind a thin lace in it's path. Aroma and taste is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit notes such as grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, mango as well as just about the right amount of sweetness from the caramelized malts to bring it all together. A notch better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Great stuff!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay goblet. This beer pours a murky melon with a rocky white head that leaves some serious lacing of the American variety. The nose is the typical American IPA. Big citrus notes with sweet oranges, lemons, a bit of pineapple, and some sweet caramel from the malt backbone. The flavor is a lot sweeter then I had anticipated from the nose. The malt really dominate the flavor profile. Pineapple, peach and just a hint of lemon zest pop their heads through the malt. Big toffee and caramel overtones. This really had me twisted. I completely expected a hop bomb from the nose and just didn't get it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and and finishes slightly dry. This is a good IPA but just not what I had expected."
"drinkability is great. this is an intensely hoppy brew with a wonderfully smooth character and a great semi-dry finish of residual hop resins. the freshness of the brew only accentuates the hops, producing one of the most well crafted IPA experiences of this BA's tenure. cheers!"
"I like the balance here, & am starting to value a well-balanced IPA more & more. This is in the middle-left on the mellow/harsh scale (Surly Furious on the left, Ruination or Green Flash West Coast IPA on the right). Very nice mouthfeel, feels satisfied without being beaten to death with palate-ravaging hop bitterness. This is a keeper, for sure."
"Crooked Tree isn't really a one in a while treat. I would have to say that it's more of a session IPA. It's not overly hopped, but hopped just right. Finally, I would like to thank Donny2120 for giving me the opportunity to finally try a Dark Horse beer."
"The one drawback is that it makes you really thirsty. Maybe that comes with the territory of hoppy beers, but I have had quite a few IPAs and DIPAs in my day and most aren't as bad as this. However, it's not a deal breaker, as its positive attributes greatly outweigh this one weak spot. There is plenty of carbonation and it is medium light. Very drinkable."
"If you are into IPA's, give this a try. I know I will again."
"HV"
"- edit - after my first one cracked open antoher and this second one is a little on the thin side (maybe the hops from the first took its toll on my palate) but i had to knock down flavor and mothfeel .5 but still i have had many of these in the last year plus and still this beer is an A in my book"
"Big light tan head sitting on top of a murky amber/brown body. The creamy head sticks around for awhile and leaves good lacing. The aroma is very fruity, grapefruit and tropical fruit. The taste is also loaded with grapefruit. Has a bit of a bitter citrus peel and pine flavor on the finish."
"If this beer was available in my area I have a feeling I'd have a 6-pack in my fridge at all times. In fact this one would replace Sierra Nevada for me I think. Really good, and highly recommended to IPA drinkers and people trying to get into hops alike."
"Give this one a shot - you won't be disappointed."
"D-Throughout the drinking experience few of the components seem to come together to produce a result greater than the sum of the parts. Still, a decent IPA that is easily quaffed. This is my second Dark Horse candidate this week after a long absence, and I am overall impressed by their offerings."
"D: Very good right here. Dark Horse puts out some really solid brews, and this is a fantastic one to get started with."
"Pretty decent brew. Poured with a nice head and some lace. Color is an amber on the dark side. Aroma is very hoppy with a little grapefruit and some muskiness, malty. Flavor is as described: on the dry side, hop bitter, very good carbonation. drinkable. Hoppy finish with almost no sweetness"
"My first dark horse beer and I have been looking forward to trying it. Pours a nice copper color with a 2 finger head. Some sediment floating around in there. Smelled predominantly like citrus, apple. Nice tasting beer, very carbonated. Very balanced IPA and quite an easy drinker. You get a nice bitterness from the hops but the malt backbone kicks in as well. Big lacing on the glass as the beers disappears into a memory. Nice offering from dark horse and recommended. I would like to try this again and I really want to try the double crooked tree. Cheers."
"D- Overall a nice brew that holds its own among the others."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a burnt orange color with a moderately creamy white head. There is a lot of noticeable floating sediments in the glass. The aroma of this brew is full of orange and wonderful bouquet of floral hops. There is a great taste of citrus and smooth balance of hops in the finish, which could actually be a little more bitter for my taste. It has been a while since I have had an IPA and man this is a good one. Need to make an effort to find some more of this caliber. Too bad I only have one from a variety pack because I could have a few of these!"
"Overall, a staple of an IPA and a solid representation of the style. I really enjoyed this, but I just had a Furious and that happens to be the hands-down winner."
"A very hazy orange IPA. Pours with plenty of carbonation that settles to thin layer leaving a good amount of lace behind. Great citrus (particularly tangerines) aroma. Fairy fat (full-bodied) and smooth with an orange marmalade hoppiness. The bitterness is very smooth and blends well with the caramel malts which lend this beer its color and some of its flavor. The finish is bitter, but also very fruity; almost Fruit Loops fruity. I must like fruity IPAs, because I like this one quite a bit."
"They started stocking this at my favorite retail joint. Disappointed they (Dark Horse) didn't have the ABV printed on the label or bottle, if it is, I missed it. Small tight bubbles capped this cloudy copper liquid in my Bell's pint glass. One of my favorite smells in the world, the fruity floral bouquet of an IPA. They definitely used one of the three C hops in this one, grapefruit and pine are representing. Nice smooth hop flavor not at all sharp like some, accompanied by a good malt backbone. Really looking forward to trying the Double crooked tree. At first, the carbonation tingles the back of the teeth and tip of the tongue. As it warms it's smooth as silk. Pleasantly drinkable, have to pick up a sixer of this one for cookouts and hot summer days"
"Cracked the bottle to a strong hoppy smell, very pleasant. Thick, frothy head and a slightly cloudy pour with floating sediment. Tan/orange in color. Decent taste, somewhat watery mouthfeel. Bitter taste towards the end, not overpowering or bad though. Could definitely sit around and drink a few of these no problem, but not one of my favorite IPA's."
"Not a bad IPA. I would like to have some more bitterness, but I would not pass this up."
" And for just more than $8 this beer is a good value."
"I've been putting off picking this one up but finally decided to give it a try. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a hazy orange very light copper color with a small one finger head. The head stays for a little while and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is hops, citrus, and pine. The taste is hoppy and piney. Somewhat bitter especially in the aftertaste but it's not a bad thing. Overall not a bad IPA at all."
"Easy to drink, I really enjoy this beer."
"D- I'm not exactly sure what it is about this IPA but I actually am quite fond of it. It lacks the balance of others that I really enjoy, but still manages to be very drinkable."
"Appears a heavily clouded copper hue with a nice off white light khaki head, dwindles slow and forms a nice collar of lacing with fine even streaks left behind after each sip. Aromatics offer up dominant citrus hop bursts blended with refined bready yeast characteristics with some earthy hop undertones. Flavor has a touch of alcohol upfront with a lingering herbal citrus peel harshness, quite abrasive yet remains balanced with enough malts to stand up to the hop bitterness. It stands alone as far as originality with the lack of caramel and although citrus hops are popping it really doesn't make me think of a straight up Bell's clone the way that Founders Centennial IPA does. I'm definitely a happy camper that this showed up for nine bucks a sixer right down the street from my house along side their amber. Medium bodied healthy dose of carbonation, brings on strong hop burps intermittently during the drinking experience. Drinkability is killer doesn't whack you with hops or anyone flavor beautiful aggressive yet tamed hop bitterness packed with flavor, I could drain a sixtel of this with a few friends in no time. Grab it by the keg if you can, if not a sixer will do if flying solo over the course of a good football game."
"D: This one goes down very easy due to the creamy smoothness, low ABV, and slightly bitter finish. This is about as close to a session version of a real IPA that you can get."
"Tonight, this beer vies with a New Glarus Hop Hearty and Bell's Two Hearted for the title of best IPA of my recent trade. Sadly, this beer comes in third. It's not a bad IPA, but it lacks body and is unbalanced, in my humble opinion. There just isn't enough malt sweetness and body to hold up to the bitter hops. The hop flavor is a tad boring, as well, or possibly that's a related problem. The hops are bitterly citric, mostly, but there are some other notes lingering beneath the bitterness. The feel is a tad thin and astringent, not bad really but it's being compared to some pretty good competition. At any rate, there just isn't quite enough rich malt to stand up to the hops."
"This beer was a good beer out of the bottle, but on tap it's excellent. Hope I get to try it again soon."
"A: Loads of thick frothy head on a hearty pour, lots of lacing around the edge of the glass, quite a bit of sediment, brown with a hint of orange visible - 4.50, S: Hops dominate, more of a bubblegum aroma than the citrus and pine I'm used to in American IPAs, very pleasant and earthy aromas - 4.50, T: Though hops take the front bill Crooked Tree has a solid malt base which nicely balances this beer, grapefruit on the palate, slight nuttiness - 4.00, M: Mildly creamy - 3.75, D: A very solid beer, if I had easier access to Crooked Tree I would definitely drink more of it. As a hophead it is always nice to find beers like this one - 4.25"
"D: It's a solid beer, but not the best IPA."
"thanks to beubie for the sample"
"On the pour, a slow one at that, the head rose thick and foamy to the brim requiring a stop in pouring to prevent overflowing. After waiting a while for the head to settle emptying the rest of the bottle, the beer in glass shone a cloudy orange-amber color when held to light. A great deal of particulate yeast sediment stirred up during the pouring contributed to the cloudiness and gave a less than appealing look- like cloudy hot cider. However, the scent was nice; a mildly sweet, generously hoppy floral aroma, which raised hopes for tasting. The first sip was, unfortunately for the taste buds, uneventful. Flavor was general, nothing outstanding, but decently drinkable. Ditto on the mouthfeel and finish. To the tongue it's an ok American IPA, after the gulp it's as if taking a drink from a pasteurized American light lager- you don't get too much afterward. Also, the yeast sediment at the bottom, for those who aren't particularly partial, is gratuitous and detracts significantly from the drinking experience after the first half of the glass is gone. Not bad, but there are better."
"Overall, I think this is a very drinkable brew and can easily see this being worthy of a session. The alcohol is practically undectable and goes down very easy. I admit, I was not expecting a whole lot out of this, especially after the pour, but I'd definitely try this one again."
"Will definitely be purchasing this one again."
"Pours a hazy copper orange with a large eggshell head. The foam dies to leave a nice half-finger cap and a lot of lacing. Some sediment floating about. Smells of piney, floral hops and sweet biscuity malt. Quite a bit of citrus and other fruit. The piney, floral hops and grapefruit are present in the taste as well, but well balanced by the malt sweetness. Slightly bitter, dry finish. More balanced than most takes on the style. Nicely done."
"Smell is wonderful and lightly hopped. This tastes good! Very well balanced and almost the perfect amount of hoppy bitterness. If I had a home draft setup, this could easily be put on without a fear of not enjoying all of it. A little thin on the mouthfeel, but oh so enjoyable. This brewery is absolutely wonderful. Must try more of their stuff."
"this is a tasty IPA! the appearance is an orange/amber color with nice lacing thru-out..the smell is floral ,grapefruit,citrus ,pine, and malt very nice.... it tastes as good as it smells... hops up front grapefruit and pine in the middle bittersweet hop/malts finish at the end.. its tasty. i like this IPA and will keep this in the fridge. this is very easy to drink and the abv is 6.00 . you got to try this one."
"Notes from: 6/16/05"
"D. This brew is very smooth, and very easy to drink. The appearance and aroma were a bit thin, but the flavors this beer has to offer were suprising. This is a solid IPA."
"Served in a pint glass - pours a hazy orange/yellow, very cloudy and opaque. There is a faint smell of hops, but nothing too impressive. The taste is very good though, with citrussy hops and solid malt backbone, leaving a lingering bitterness. Overall the ale has a rich and chewy feel, without being syruppy. These go down pretty easily. Overall, this reminds me a lot of Rush River's Bubblejack IPA, one of my faves. I like the double barrelled tap handle as well."
"This a good beer and I will have one more to make sure."
"This one will always hold a special place in my experience, as the brew that really turned me on to IPAs. Even as I try to expand into different styles, this will remain a mainstay in my fridge. Sure, it's not perfect, but it plays to its strengths beautifully. Pick one up, if you haven't already."
"Pours a golden orange, very little head and lacing. Smells fruity, malty. Average carbonation, very hoppy. What you expect when after seeing and feeling the aroma. Pretty easy to drink, but definitely feel the hoppyness. Pretty smooth though and a nice little compliment to the bacon cheeseburger I had at Stub and Herbs."
"Drinkability for Crooked Tree is high, given that it's an above average IPA. However, at $9.99 for a sixer, I would much rather just grab some Two Hearted."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a frosted pint glass...."
"Great Beer!!"
"Appearance is good with some decent head and not a lot of lacing. Nice copper color. Smell is a bit light but some fresh, and clean hops mixed with just a touch of dry malt. The taste brings more pungent piney taste as some sour fruit. Malt is sweeter than the nose led me to believe. Mouthfeel is just above medium, with a bit oily texture. Drinkability is very good."
"D - Smooth and easy to drink but not all that compelling."
"Too sticky on the finish for my liking although the body is pleasant and the carbonation is lively and cuts through the oiliness somewhat. A tasty if not slightly amateurish IPA. A good sign coming from Marshall, MI. Keep it up!"
"Otherwise a decent american IPA. As it warmed, it seemed particularly citrusy. Good, stout bitter backbone that should define the style."
"Drinkability- This is damn sessionable. Greatly balanced, nice fruit flavors and a nice sweet malt flavor. Well balanced and flavorful. Score another for Ethan."
"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove, MN. It's got a great IPA appearance, a slightly hazy amber with thick lacing and. The flavor has mix of juicy grapefruit and pine with a little balance from dry, biscuit malts. It finishes with with a woody, earthy bitterness that's quite pleasant. This is a fine example of a well-made, drinkable American IPA. Check this one out."
"This is a beer that is hard to find many complaints or knocks on."
"Thanks For Reading"
"Really solid ale, my first Dark Horse, and it won't be my last."
"D- This is a pretty decent IPA overall. The flavors are much less intense than other IPAs but the bitterness is just as strong. The mouthfeel makes this a nice, drinkable IPA."
"Easy enough to drink but doesn't stand out as special in any way. Pretty timid, but enjoyable enough. Still wondering if this was old or otherwise compromised based on lack of any head and very subdued hop profile with no bitterness."
"Pours a cloudy amber/yellow with an amazing 1/2 inch head. By far the best looking head yet: small bubbles, individual mounding, off-white color, great retention, and good lacing. Smell strongly of hops. Definitely fits the style. Tastes of hops throughout, but sadly not as strong in body as I would have thought/hoped. Almost has a watery taste. Started out amazing with the highest rating for appearance I've had, shucks. Crisp and smooth with decent carbonation, but lacking in body. I'm probably over-reacting, but I was so excited by the appearance and the taste just wasn't there. Still, overall not a bad IPA, but not necessarily worth going out of your way to pick up."
"Overall a solid beer, but not a true standout of an IPA. Glad I tried it."
"Cloudy orange in color with a medium white head,lots of sediment floating around. Aroma is dominated by citrus hops with some floral notes detectable. Flavor is heavily hopped - lots of citrus, flowers, and pine. Malt sweetness adds to it, but its overwhelmingly hop dominant. Nice IPA, Dark Horse is a class act for sure."
"Hops dominant in the flavor. Very nice, bitter citrus flavor here. A bit of bready malt lingers in the back along with some herbal notes. Medium mouthfeel. I would love to have more of this. I would make it a regular part of the rotation if it were available closer to home."
"over all one of my favorite IPA's out there"
"M/D: Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. Really balanced IPA, very nice. I expected a more hoppier brew, but was suprised by the malt presence."
"Overall a pretty solid beer."
"D - Crooked Tree is certainly one of the most unique IPAs I've had in my travels. This one would make a great breakfast brew. O.J. all the way!"
"Drinkability - a worthy IPA from Dark Horse, though probably better on tap."
"thanks to tadowdaddy for this"
"poured from a bottle. color is golden orange, little head. nothing special. smell is light floral hops. taste is semi smooth hops up front, then turns bitter with a perfect malt balance. the aftertaste is a grassing hop flavor, kind of like a fresh hop flavor. medium to light carbonation. this is my new favorite IPA."
"D- Very drinkable, just very nice. A great example of an American IPA."
"Overall a fantastic IPA from Marshall, MI. Full flavored and friendly all at the same time. The texture of this beer is fantastic, a true well-built ale. The unrefined and organic hop flavor is a nice change from the norm. Masterfully balanced and well suited for any spicy/zesty dishes. Great IPA and flagship brew from lower Mid-Michigan!"
"D- It's a really easy drinker. I could see drinking a couple of these in a sitting. I have a feeling it would be a good compliment to a spicy or greasier meal."
"Drinkability is high for me here, I really like this one from start to finish. I had this last year (or maybe 2 years ago), when I was just getting into craft beer, and I thought it was really one-dimensional. All I tasted was ""bitter."" And now here I am, a year (or possibly 2) later, and I am thinking of moving this up from the bench, and letting it start a few games. Either way, this one's a winner."
"This is the resident standby for me when it comes to the local (michigan) IPA scene. HOPS galore! Pours a cloudy brew, heavy lacing on the glass. Smells of hops, can't miss it. First taste the hops hit ya, and leaves ya wanting another quick sip. Citrusy taste, reminds me of orange peels and grapefruit after the hops let any other taste in. Very drinkable beer, nice job by Dark Horse Brewing. Dark Horse in my opinion doesn't get enough credit for their fine line of brews."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer for those that like the taste of hops. The lack of other elements leaves more to be desired. Would definitely drink again though because I do like the hoppy flavor. Heck, I have 5 more to drink!"
"Overall this is a decent IPA. As stated above it just fell flat of my expectations. I can't really point it out, but something was just missing."
"264 reviews as of this writing. A bit coudy / hazy orange looking brew. Nice citric aroma and taste buoyed with a nice caramel malt body. Nice AIPA, went well with dinner. I'd have this again with dinner or better on tap if I'm in the distribution area for work."
"With all do respect, I'm still developing an appreciation for hop forward beers & this style in particular. He told me "" You're not gonna like it...I know you"". He wasn't entirely wrong. I could take it or leave it but I'm glad I tried it."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and citrus/ grapefruity hops. In the taste, small citrus, grapefruity hops, and a nice lemon grass earthiness in the malt. A small bitterness and a medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry citrus hop aftertaste. Nice hops, and nice earthy malt backing it up. Easy to drink and nice."
"Completely hazed throughout dark honey amber body, no head and nice crystal-like lacing. Lots of floaties swimming around in the glass. A woody, floral, hoppy aroma, some pine needles and a bit of citrus. Toasty malt note in the nose as well. Taste of sappy pine tree oils, slightly citric, with a bready, biscuit malt backbone. Toasty malt character, just hints of some light caramel. Not overly bitter, carbonation is low, mouthfeel is creamy. Very drinkable, as it's not overly bitter and is fairly well balanced."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little on the chewy side. Resinous hop juices coat the mouth. An excellent IPA."
"Had this on tap last time, so its always a little different. Kinda like reading the book before seeing the movie. Still it is very enjoyable."
"Easy drinking IPA, nothing earth-shattering here, but very sessionable"
"Served on tap at Fantail Brewing Co in Sturgis, MI. Nice rich amber color, clear with fluffy white head. Of all the MI IPA's I've had on this trip this smells the hoppiest. Very crisp, clean hop smell. Taste is strong of hops, its pretty well balanced but as expected from an IPA the hops side is dominant. Very clean flavor. Mouthfeel was relatively light with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer and one of the better MI IPA's yet."
"D: Decent stuff, not mind blowing. Will try it again if im at the brewpub"
"Great session beer! Growler works very well."
"D - Solid hoppy brew, but those floaties... pour carefully."
"The body is moderate to light. Good carbonation. Overall there is just something funky going on here. The malt is muddle and lacks the base for the hops. And the hop finish is just off with some off yeast and floral notes. Crooked for sure."
"A nice drinking AIPA that is commplex and very tasty. I enjoyed the balance and the desert parching finish on the tounge."
"D - A damn fine IPA...this is a perfect example of the style since it highlights both pine and citrus and has the traditionally ""biscuity"" malt flavor commonly found in IPAs. Good stuff!"
"Pours an hazy orange/caramel color with no head. Carbonation is fairly weak. Not much of a nose but still enough to sniff up. Smells mostly of Big sticky resinous hops with a nice amount of caramel malts in there for balance. Hops throughout the tongue, orange citrusy hops with a smackling of pine. The sweetness form the malts does a good job. Finishes with a peek of toasted malts and then turns dry. Appearance is kind of weak but the taste brings it on home. Pretty dang good."
"This IPA shows a clear amber color with a big off-white head and good lacing. It gives an aroma of sweet, earthy malt and peat. The taste is a tart cherry malt with a solid body feel and medium drinkabiity. Piney hops is present but not huge. Plenty of alcohol presence. A likeable choice that has a little personality."
"good."
"A copper colour with a bunch of sediment and a centimeter head. Pretty good retention. The hops smell spicy and really strong. The beer is really bitter, and the hops don't taste that great either. There isn't many malts in the beer, just hoppy and bitter. Mouthfeel is creamy and okay, and it's decently drinkable."
"D- not my favorite IPA, but another solid offering from Dark Horse. id love to have this one on tap sometime"
"This beer pours a hazy amber color with a one finger head that disappears quickly but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The smell and taste is citrus with some grapefruit and piny taste. This beer has medium body and gets high points for drinkability. Overall a decent IPA that I consider to be above average."
"D- Easy to drink and recommended."
"Crooked Tree now available in western IL (next to STL). Another plus for us."
"Pours a quite hazy amber with tons of floaties swimming around. Less than a one finger head dissipates but lingers and leaves moderate lacing down the glass. Smell is of piney hops and pineapple. The pineapple and pineyness are also present in the taste, as well as a cantaloupe-like taste. Very good hop bitterness with a little balance from the malt. Mouthfeel is medium and makes this beer easy to drink and quite refreshing after a long day in the cornfields. I'm kicking myself because I decided to only buy one bottle of this instead of a sixer. An excellent, very sessionable IPA that I will definitely be picking up in the future."
"Pretty good ipa, although my stomach feels a bit against it. May just be my condition this evening though so I will try not to hold it against my scoring."
"Thanks to abankovich for the TIF extra!"
"D: Good beer for drinking all day. Not too much of anything; nice balance."
"Beer pours a cloudy orange-golden color, plenty of floaties swimming around, off-white head fades pretty quick and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smells hoptastic!! Pine, tons of grapefruit aroma, very little detectable maltiness, but it's there. Tastes great, very ""west coast"" tasting IPA, very hop-heavy, a ton of citrus, incredible bitterness, really nice IPA. Good mouthfeel, medium-bodied, and actually pretty quenching, with really great lingering hop bitterness. Glad I got to try this...a very solid IPA!!"
"Poured a cloudy dark orange/tan with lots of yeast/particles suspended. Very little head. Smells of citrus grapefruit and maybe a touch of caramel. MMMM tastes like it smells mostly of grapefruit. Very light carbonation. Refreshing floral hops. I could drink a few of these, great flavor. Reminds me of the classic sierra nevada only more toasty. Very good IPA."
"Pours a juicy looking orange with thick creamy light yellow head that leaves huge sheets as it drops and continues as I drink marking out each swallow as I drink this hoppy beast.The smells are sweet and full of citrus rind with a hint of fresh cut christmas tree.Holy shit,this is hoppier than I expected...I'm in love...this is jammed full of grapefruit,orange,and pine flavors.Somewhat hard to find much malt presence,but thats alright because this IPA is mad crazy hoppy,yet sooo smoothe and soft.WoW!!"
"I love the way this thing looks. Murky amber with a fast fading head and some particles floating around. Lots of pine and lemon in the smell. Bitter, with the lemon and pine becoming much stronger in the taste. This is a very unique IPA and now one of my favorites."
"Crooked Tree is a very good IPA. A few minor tweaks would really elevate to the next level. Beef up the nose a little, smooth it out, and dial in the carbonation. That's the ticket. In the big picture, that's nitpicking given its fine flavor. Definitely recommended. Thanks, Christian."
"Nice above average IPA. It just needs more of the juice in the middle and aromatics."
"D_My second Dark Horse brew. A decent but not great IPA. Thanks go out to rblwthacoz for letting me sample this."
"Overall a damn decent IPA and I am sad I passed this one up as many time as I have. Will definitely be keeping the fridge stocked this summer as one of my gotos."
"I had this beer last night at the crawfish boil and I was pleasantly suprised. They didn't have it on tap so I got it in bottle form. This beer certainly bottles well. It poured amber witha white head and smelled like hops :) It had a nice flavor and is definatley a well crafted IPA. Locals told me not to expect much from this brewery but damn they were wrong. Certainly a beer I could drink all night"
"Notes: Got this from Scoobydank as an extra. Thanks man!"
"This wasn't a bad IPA by any means from Dark Horse. It won't blow over the Hop Heads but will fit those looking for a IPA that offers a well balanced taste and refreshing drinkibility."
"Taste is on the malty side, toast, crackers, multi-grain bread; then there is the mix of tropical fruits like orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and lemon. Very little bitterness. Very easy to drink Not as syrupy as I the aroma led me to believe, it actually has a viscous consistency but the carbonation level is enough to make it smooth and creamy."
"Bottle that was hand carried from Michigan for our little tasting, poured into a taster glass. Murky copper and orange color, with a small head. Aromas of light herbal, earthy hops. Slight alcohol on the nose. Pine, biscuit malt, grassy flavors. Quite nice, light to medium body with good carbonation and extremely easy to drink. I would love some more of this beer."
"Full bodied and malty, with a big caramel base that gives a nice contrast to the bitter, citrusy hops. Bitterness is moderate, but pleasant. Easy drinking and sessionable. A solid midwest IPA."
"Drinkability on this one is great considering it is an approachable 6%, well-balanced IPA."
"Drinkability - Nice all around offering as an IPA. Grabbed some while I was in Chicago, and would love to have this available regularly. Just what the doctor ordered for that hop craving."
"Full bodied, rich flavour, dry finish... a good beer. Loads of hop flavours, a bit unbalanced as it's skimpy on the maltiness, but that's ok! It's bottle conditioned, so if you don't like the chunky stuff, don't pour the whole thing!"
"D: The light nature of this one makes it very drinkable, especially on a hot afternoon. I would love to dry the double and compare."
"This is a good introduction to the dark horse IPA's. The beer is medium bodied with a hazy golden color with a slightly amber tinge. The nose exploded out the bottle. On the palate the beer is more soft than expected. The are good layers of citrus and tight hop notes. The beer is lighter than i remember but, once again the dark horse rides forward. In addition this is a great session beer. Everything is well corordintated. The beer is saying drink all six!"
"Pours a hazy bright amber color with an inch of off-white/cream colored head with good retention and nice sticky lacing. Smells of pine, fresh cut grass, grapefruit, and caramel. Tastes of grapefruit and grass up front with a solid caramel and biscuit backbone, and a finish of lemon peel and dry pine notes. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth and sweet with a nice balance of flavors and a nice dry bitter finish. Easy to drink, flavorful, and very refreshing, a solid sessionable IPA."
"I'm not sure what to make of this. Is my experience an anomaly? I suppose if I keep my eyes closed, I really don't care."
"Bottle courtesy of tytoanderso. Pours a cloudy orange copper. Minimal head with some soapy lacing. Tons o' chunkies in this one. I should have decanted better- I haven't seen this many floaties in a beer in a long time. Should be tasty! Nose- earthy malts and hops. Taste-caramelmalts and bittering hops that smoothes out after a couple of sips. Lighter bodied than expected. Assertive alpha hops show up on the tail end for a dry bitter finish with a touch of sweetness. Carbonation is medium. Nice drinkin IPA"
"Another nice offering from Dark Horse."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"I wish this said that it was bottle conditioned or warned about the amount of sediment because I poured a lot in by accident. It has a nice amber color with a small beige head that fades fast. It first smells a little of citrus hops and then smells mostly of caramel malts. I think the sediment sort of ruined the taste of this or it might be too old. It's sort of muddy tasting and just doesn't seem right. The hops don't really show well for me and are mostly masked by the earthy malt taste that is probably at least partially from too much sediment poured into the glass. I would love to get another bottle to give it another try."
"Thanks to Tytoanderso for this extra! Cloudy orange in color. Good bit of sediment in bottle. Thin white head. Fairly abundant aromas of piney and grassy hops. Good IPA flavor with a nice bitter touch at first sip, but also mellows out well after intitial bite. Slightly slick mouthfeel, you get a nice hop taste. Very drinkable IPA. Could be a nice session beer."
"Nice, sweetness enhances the citrus, and hops are balanced well."
"For a hophead, this one is pretty nice. It suffers by comparison to the double crooked tree, but this is still a nice IPA."
"D: Easy drinking and inviting."
"One hoppin' good time. Not exactly sessionable, but enjoy a couple on-tap for optimal drinkability."
"Definately a hop bomb. Not the most balanced IPA out there but something to slaughter the taste buds with all the bitter goodness. Relatively low ABV is surprising and helps drinkability but still not much point in drinking more than two in an evening."
"Next to some Dogfish Head 90 min. this is one of the more drinkable IPAs. It has something for everybody (malty and hoppy). This is my kind of IPA."
"Drinkabilty: For fans of agressive IPA's, it is very good. It delivers the hop blast you want, and you will taste it for a while."
"Flavor is more restrained herbal and oily hops notes- the fruitiness is a distant memory. Pleasant and good, but not my favorite hop profile. I like it, but don't love it."
"Very cloudy and murky appearance, with a thin head that dissipates very quickly. There is a lot of pine in the aroma. Taste is similar with a lingering pine aftertaste. Although there are some floral and citrus hints up front. Very light in the mouth and easy to drink. Solid IPA."
"This is a quality, well-hopped example of the many available american IPAs on the market; not the best, but worth seeking out. The taste improves as the ale warms."
"this is quite unique for an ipa in appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel, probably for reasons that are beyond my expertise. this poured a very cloudy, murkish, dull/earthy amber with lots and lots of sediment particles and slurry at the bottom. quickly dissipating off-white head and thin, sporadic lacing. nose was a bit subdued for an ipa. i got a hint of sugar cookies and a piney earthiness. taste was also understated, with some sweet cookie-ish malts playing even with a very light (for an ipa) and smooth bitterness. not bad, just different for the style. mouthfeel was also different-very soft, which i liked. perhaps it's the water affecting the nose and mouthfeel? felt a bit thin for the style but i liked it nonetheless. very sessionable, i could put a few of these down, as this is quite a refreshing beer."
"Pours a foggy orange/amber with a thin creme head. Nose is not overly prevalent, but has some nice earthy character to it and a decent complexity. Flavor is very earthy as well with a bark-like profile reigning most noticed. A very constrained citrus edge is there, but earthy is basically what you're getting here. Carbonation and liquid feel good. This is a pretty nice IPA. Earthy tones make it more of a sipper, but it certainly has enough character to carry it."
"Nice in the mouth, too. Just a touch too sweet & weird for a session beer, but easy on the eyes, tongue, & throat. I'll be looking for more Dark Horse to sample."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer from Dark Horse. The first I've tried from this brewery. Even at 6% ABV, this is an easy drinking IPA that I can easy drink two or three of in a single sitting."
"Smell is pine hops. That's about it. Taste is a bit more complex, with pine, some ruby red grapefruit notes, and maybe a hint of sweeter malt underlying it. Could use a bit of tropical fruit, or maybe some sweeter citrus, but a very decent IPA."
"Drinkability- This is a awesome beer that tends to go down faster than you intended. It's very easy drinking and really tasty. I wish the body had a bit more oomph but that's about it. Great beer that I'm glad was recommended to me!"
"Crooked Tree is another good brew from Dark Horse. They have yet to let me down. Crooked Tree has been better than this on past occasions and about the same on others, but either way it's good!"
"D - a bit heavy to be a session beer but a few would be nice."
"Very interesting to try. I know I personally couldn't drink more than one or two."
"This is an interesting IPA and pretty drinkable...I like the bitterness here; it kind of reminds me of Bridgeport IPA, which I'm very fond of. Good stuff."
"Notes: Now I realize why this beer gets so much attention!"
"A hazy dark amber color with decent lacing. Huge hops in the nose, lemony, grapefruity, pine is subdued but there. Taste doesn't quite match my expectations from the nose. The malt seems to overpower the hops a little. It starts out heavy on the malt, as I wait for that big hop hit, it just doesn't come. There's definitely hops there but I was expecting more. The hops profile could use a little lightening as well IMO. Pine comes through but the lemoniness not so much. Goes down easy and feels right on the tongue. Overall a quite good IPA, but certainly not the best. I can't wait to try their DIPA though!"
"D- It was very drinkable for how heavy it was. Should definite give it a try."
"Overall, an average IPA that is drinkable but not memorable."
"Mouthfeel is great, perfectly carbonated and almost chewy for the style. This is right up there in the top 5 IPA's I have had."
"This is an IPA you could really drink in quantity."
"D: Really a wonderfully crafted and nice change from the cleaner, clearer IPAs, I've sampled lately. I nice change of pace and a pretty damn drinkable beer considering the bitterness and ABV."
"Drinkability/Overall: solid on all fronts yet lacks the complexity of other American IPAs. A very drinkable, well-made IPA nonetheless."
"Poured a very thick an unmixed looking orange color. This IPA was almost grainy to the taste...the hops were there but it just felt like there was sand in my beer and didn't settle well in the stomach. I couldn't drink more than one and don't think this is a good representation of the IPA style."
" ~ This hop filled beer is one to be reckoned with. I certainly recommend anyone that likes strong hop filled and tasty beer give the Crooked Tree a shot."
"D: Could have maybe one or two of these, but it would be worth it to include one any time you can!"
"D: Overall, quite nice and an easily drinkable IPA. Not outstnading, but worth buying again."
"Orange IPA with a fair amount of bottle condition yeast that stirs and suspends easily. Aroma is so-so for an IPA, strong citrus tones overall in the drink. Nice but leaves me wanting a stronger american ipa. Would really like to try this one on draught."
"Looking at other reviews, its possible I got a bad bottle, but no date on the label has me wondering if it is possibly old. In my book, no date = brewer takes the hit. Its sad, after all that, the basic flavor is pretty good, but everything else really brought down my score."
"Quite impressive, and one I'll be sure to try again and again. Dark Horse is officially on my radar. Excellent stuff."
"D. Nice session beer. No harsh flavors but nothing exceptional here either. I'd call it a low brow craft beer if there is such a thing."
"the flavor is up front malty with a firm bitterness, hint of citrus, herbal, and very easy drinking, there is a lingering spice on my tongue."
"This is a really nice American IPA. Full of personality in the same way as a Bell's Two Hearted. This is a beer to enjoy for sure."
"A medium amber color with a quater inch, off white head colored head forming on top. It shows tremendous retention. A strong citrus scent dominates the fragrance, folowed by the aroma of grass and pine, folowed by the faint scent of malt at the end. The malt comes out in the flavor at the start, it then gradually blends itself to some intense hop flavors. Those flavors start with grapefruit which is the most dominate, with touches of grass and pine, and it finshes with tobbaco taste. A slightly watery feel at the front, as it rolls across the palate it gains some weight, to become more medium to maybe full bodied. There is the ever so slight tingle of carbonation at the end. This is a very good IPA, an easy sipping beer. A strong aroma and intense flavor not only makes this an excellent choice for an IPA. It would make an excellent session beer, with only 6% ABV."
"mouthfeel and drinkability ar egood too"
"Pours a ruddy tangerine with visible sediment and a frothy tan head that dies slow. Lacing occurs in full sheets all around the glass. Smells nice and citrusy with mean hops and a little yeast and malt. This is mean at the start with a rindy hop bite followed by a pure balance of yeasty sweet malt. Best of both worlds. Medium in the mouth and drinkable but DIPA like."
"drinkability is good. well balanced, with great interplay between the alcohol, bitterness, and malt."
"Mouthfeel is barely medium bodied and dry in the finish. A pretty good beer overall."
"D: A credible IPA that I'd like to have again. Without a date on the bottle, my assumption is that this is still good (while maybe not at its freshness peak), despite hiding at the bottom of a box for a couple months. Nice balance; good, but far from dominating, hoppiness; nice aroma. Recommended."
"Cloudy and orangey with a nice lasting thick head. Heavy aroma of hops, pine, and a little bit of citrus and sour dish rag. I'm not a huge fan of I.P.A.s but I have to consider how this beer tastes for the style. And for the style it's an excellent example. It's what an I.P.A. is supposed to be. Heavy on the hops, some pine tree, and a bitter aftertaste. Not too thick and not too thin. Good feel. Good beer."
"This is one murky looking IPA. I like it. Thick and dirty looking. Muddled butternut squash tone. Thin ivory white head leaves little lace. Nice mix on the nose of piney hop tones and sugary maltiness. Could use more on the hop side of the equation with regards to the nose. Nice balance of flavors, but not much with regards to the bright hoppy tones I like. Sugary caramel malt tones with a spattering of piney, reinous hoppiness. Bitterness lingers, as it should, but is a little rough around the edges. Medium-full body. Light prick of carbonation. Decent beer."
"Very Drinkable and tasty, a very solid IPA."
"However, I do like this. I could possibly learn to really like it."
"D- I'm loving the hops profile on this one. I really enjoying the taste on this one. The mouthfeel is great. Delicious- initially the bitterness was harsh for me, but as the beer warms up (along with the hightened carbonation) it becomes a delicious silky mess."
"Most of my Dark Horse experience prior to today had to do with their excellent Holiday Stout Series. Crooked Tree IPA shows that they know what the hell they're doing when it comes to hoppy beer as well. I continue to maintain that the Midwest does hops as well as California and the Pacific Northwest. Let's see... Surly Furious, Three Floyds Dreadnaught (and Alpha King and Alpha Klaus), Bell's Two Hearted and HopSlam, Town Hall Masala Mama and Fresh Hop, Tyranena Bitter Woman... and on and on and on."
"Pours in my pint glass to a very cloudy amber haze.Small lacing ring left after the pour and stays throughout.Some bubbles creep up from the bottom durring the drinking.Smells of fresh cut grass and slightly rotted fruit.I got the maltness and the hops but...I think the cloudiess of the beer takes away from the taste and flavour it could have.In the mouth it is great,but unfortunatly it only lastes awhile as the aftertaste is a bit too dry and chalky.Overall not a bad beer,as i'm a hophead and will get this again."
"Overall: this was an alright IPA, kind of middle of the road to me, which was kind of a let down considering a six-pack is $10 here in Minnesota. Very much an American IPA with all of the citrusy hops, but it was a bit maltier and biscuitier than most. I felt it was more like an ambers malt profile."
"D-Easy drinking with enough hop impact to satisfy any hophead. For not being a Double IPA, this one has tons of flavor and body. Very nice IPA!"
"With the high ratings this site gives this beer I am planning to give it another shot... I will update if I have a different experience..."
"Murky orange-amber color with a thin bone white head. Spotty lacing throughout the glass. Citrusy hops aroma balanced well with malt. Medium-bodied and nicely bitter with hops and citrus flavors, along with floral touches here and there. There is a decent amount of malt balancing the flavor out as well. The finish is moderately bitter and lasting. Very solid all around."
"Pours a super murky burnt orange with a nice two finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a nice thin layer that lasts. Stickiness is all over the glass, lovin' it. Smell is of huge earthy/dirty hops all over with a little bit of pine mixed in there. Taste is a smooth and mild grassy hop flavor through and through. Some detectable caramel malt and a little bit of citrus as well. Creamy full bodied mouthfeel with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability suffers a bit because of how thick this one is, but I really enjoy it. Dark Horse has quite the unique offerings, and this one definitely falls into that category. Give this one a try for sure."
"Nice dark orange color, the smell of a sweeter citrus & pine. And the taste? The first thing that stands outs is the hops as it should but they're a bit fruiter than most yet still keeping the bitterness one expects. It's got a bit of that sting that the hops should have but not over the top. An interesting balance complimented by a nice malt bottom end. Great body, very crisp and a mellow yet still noticeable hop aftertaste that doesn't linger too long and wear out it's welcome."
"D- It is pretty tasty but I wouldn't say it is one of my favorite IPAs. It will stand out from the rest of them though and if I am vacation somewhere and find it I will have a pint."
"This IPA is somewhat refresshing, and overall okay. Maybe this bottle was actually too fresh as the overall flavor seemed a bit harsh. I think it could definitely use more balance, it seems to be very one-dimensional."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth, creamy malt scent along with a mild hop aroma. The malt bill boasts of pale, crystal, and carapils malts. It's sweet in the malts and bitter with the hops; nicely balanced. The taste is decent. It has quite a bitter hop bite. The malt base is solid, but seems a bit watery. The piney hops really shine through. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking IPA. I like the hop character, but I wish the malt taste was a bit more pronounced. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I'd buy it again."
"D- This beer has a good pine hop flavor with some nice amounts of bitterness and a soft hop flavor that supports the hops. This beer is well built and has a decent complexity."
"D: Quite. Yes, quite drinkable. Plenty of flavor, but doesn't hit you over the head with it. Good show!"
"Drinkabiltity: Not my favorite IPA. I would put this down toward the end of my list of IPAs."
"Pours a cloudy tea tinted amber with a wispy light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Suspended morsels and surface pools evidence of visible carbonation. The smell has an enjoyable intensity and the floral fragrance is unique. Full bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a bitter tingle from the hops. Full flavored, the taste is as unique as the nose. Not your typical pine variety (realize that's not much help, but...). It finishes with an extra burst of flavor and bitterness in the breath that tends to linger for quite a while (which in this case is enjoyable). A really nice drinker. Thank'n WesWes for the opportunity to try this one!"
"Drinkability: Good IPA. I am a big fan of IPA's that use a sweetness to balance the bitterness of the hops. The citrusy sweetness here makes this a cut above a lot of IPAs by focusing on a balanced flavor instead of going for over the top bitter flavor. I would recommend searching this beer out, very enjoyable."
"Pretty drinkable, but the big hops would make this one bitter session brew. Not recommended for newbies to the style unless one wants to blow their mind. Glad i got to try this one, its big hop blast might be just what i go looking for next time i get a craving for hops. More good stuff from the Dark Horse."
"Overall, I liked it a lot more than my score/review probably indicates, and I will certainly drink it again. I've got a couple Double Crookeds at home, and I want to try these two back to back."
"Overall, this is a wonderful American IPA - very tasty."
"Pours a solid copper color with a finger of white head on top that leaves a touch of lacing as the beer drains. Nose is strong on floral hops, along with some toffee malt. Taste is likewise; almost a prototype for a good strong IPA. Lots of fruity hops, citrus, and then solid caramel malt shows up. Ends with a seemingly unending aftertaste of more floral hops. Body is medium with good carbonation. This one's a solid effort from DH and a very tasty local IPA."
"There was nothing special about this IPA, sadly. It is pretty average and just one of many. I think I'll step it up next time and stick with the Double Crooked Tree..."
"Light and well carbonated with a nice dense texture on the palate that tends to lighten a bit at the end. Awesome with food, especially in the summer time."
"Overall impression: Not the hop bomb I anticipated. More English if not for the typical ""C" hops. Nicely balanced but minimal ""wow"" factor."
"Pours a hazy orange, with a nice 2 fingers of creamy head. Smell of grapefruit and pungent hops. Strong burst of hops with a nice delicious finish. Head stayed around for a while...tastes similar to Two Hearted? Excellent, very drinkable hoppy IPA."
"Overall: Nice beer by the guys at Dark Horse. I had never tried any of their brews before this one, but they have it down when it comes to IPA's. The bitterness of the hops is what puts this one over the top. It is a great drinking beer that tastes great. My new goal is to acquire the double crooked tree. I Reallly liked this beer, so I am sure to love that one. By all means seek this one out."
"D - Very tasty, highly enjoyable IPA. Definitely competes with those in the top 10."
"D - A very well done IPA that is different enough to warrant trying and tasty enough to make you return."
"Overall, almost un-balanced. Yet the hops and malts seem to dance equally well. A bit sharp as far as the hops go, but bring this brew on any day of the week."
"Mouthfeel was medium in the carbonation and body."
"Very quenching...but not one of the best."
"Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable. The alcohol in the aroma never shows itself."
"Pours a murky apricot body with a one finger almond head. Good retention with patchy lacing. Aroma is citrusy grapefruit with hints of orange, lemon, and green apple. Medium body and carbonation contribute to a satiny mouthfeel. Taste is prominently weighted with grapefruit bitterness. Notes of sour apple and sweet maltiness add some balance. Finishes clean and bitter. A solid American IPA with some hop leafiness and a pronounced grapefruit presence."
"Taste is quite hoppy with a citrusy presenence. The yeast is tasty as well, and it really smoothes out this IPA, giving it a velvety mouthfeel. Where's the bite I've come to know and love from nearly every IPA? There it comes, it sneaks up after about 10-15 seconds and makes itself known. Very, very sneaky, dark horse, but I like. Definately an easily drinkable beer and one I will pursue in the future, along with the Crooked Tree DIPA."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easy, not very filling, very good representation of style, what the beer lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in drinkability. I could certainly drink a good number of these and stick with it for an evening."
"D - The hop character in this brew may be a bit fatiguing as it is definitely not subtle, nonetheless easy to drink."
"Bottle courtesy of Sammy: Poured a cloudy dark beige color ale with a nice big foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of piney and citrus hops is quite overpowering but also very enjoyable. Taste is a mix between some nice caramel and toffee malt with some huge bitter piney hops. Body is quite full with what appears to be low filtration. I am actually surprised at the rating since I thought this was actually a lot better then the norm."
"Thanks for the bottle IndyBeer!"
"A nicely done, take-no-prisoners kind of IPA that's sure to please the hop head, but probably won't serve the average beer afficianado too well."
"Pours a very cloudy dark copper color with a one-finger head that took a few minutes to dissipate. Sticky lacing down the glass. Aroma was rather mild, but primarily earthy hops of the pine/floral variety. Taste is fantastic. Perfect blend of pine, floral and citrus hops with excellent matly sweetness. One of my top two IPAs. Very drinkable. If I had bought a six pack, I probably would have drank 3 or 4 at the minimum on a nice warm early spring evening at the grill."
"Probably the most obvious difference between the two is the appearance. While the cooked tree looks completely unfiltered (a very musty/cloudly tan body), the double has a dark-brown, slightly clearer body. The head on the double was light and quickly vanished. The crooked tree had a lasting, fluffy white head of foam with lots of lacing. The aroma's differed greatly as well. Citrus (yet earthy) hops were the dominating aroma in the crooked tree, with sweet malts were drowning out the hops in the double. This also carried over in the flavor. It's hard to believe these have the same hop profile. The crooked tree has a grapefruit hop bite, with a slightly sweet finish. The double has a rich malty sweetness complimented with a rough, bitter, earthy hop punch. I do think the double has crossed over to a very complex barelywine -- certainly with age this is what it will become. The mouthfeel in the double is full-bodied, chewy and dry. The crooked tree is lighter, smoother and finishes with less aggressiveness. Overall, I enjoy both. I will say, however, that the crooked tree is definitely more of an IPA (a damn good one), whereas, the double...is just too malty for the category, in my opinion. The double is very good, but the alcohol is felt and the drinkability is pretty low. Its more of an after dinner treat. Very good stuff."
"Pours a nice cloudy dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice one finger plus foamy off-white head which lasts awhile, lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, slight malty, citrusy, nice touch of caramel. The taste is hoppy, citrusy, with a nice bitter finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice IPA true to style, and easily drinkable, highly recommended."
"A fine IPA. Very hazy orange, with a white head that fades. Looks a bit wheatey. Nose is wonderful floral hops, tart grapefruit, and a strong herbed spiciness. Taste is hops, more hops, and citrusy goodness. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Drinkability is great too."
"D - A highly drinkable well balanced IPA. Another nice offering from Dark Horse."
"i like the toasted malts here -- very toasted, like burnt toast. hops are bittering more so than citric, leafy greens come to mind as much as grapefruit. slight caramel flavor keeps things from veering into overly-bitter territory. a fantastic IPA that flies in the face of current convention."
"D: Beautifully natural beer. If beer grew on a tree it might taste something like this. Couldn't handle a six of this but pretty close. Overall, up there with Stone and Titan for me."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice copper, slightly hazy with a nifty swirl in the middle, good head and retention, and ok lacing too, quite nice, off to a good start. Aroma a little weak, but pretty good citrus and pine hop notes, perhaps some room for malts that I don't find, but oh well whatev. Taste is a little better, a lot more assertive, a bit leafier hop profile, pines and citrus backing away a bit, malts still relatively not noticed. Mouth has decent body, good carbonation, but the finish is a bit too dry and even a little metallic. Overall, a pretty easy quaffer, tasty, a good find I suppose, perhaps I'll pick up other selections from Dark Horse, but one and done is it for this one."
"D- A little different, which was nice. I could see myself getting this again. I am curious as to how this would be on tap."
"Amber brown pour and a bit hazy. Very sweet palate with a bit citrus and malt. Goes down easy with little carbonation as hoppy as I would expect from a double and enjoyable. This is another fine beer from Dark Horse and is readily available in Wisconsin at a moderate price point as well."
"D: Very enjoyable. Bitter, dry, malty, and sweet. Many bases are covered. Low abv ensures the sessionability of this IPA."
"A fun beer for certain, too bad they don't distribute beyond 3 north-midwestern states."
"Overall, an excellent example of what an IPA should be: not overwhelmingly bitter but with a good blend of hops right up front. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a egg white head with semi sporadic lacing mixed with a burnished copper. The haze is so thick that you can't see any bubbles. The aroma is thick with dry, toasted malts and floral hops. Great bouqet. The taste is mildy hoppy for such an aroma. More hops than malt though. There is some toasty flowers with a little hint of citrus. The palate is a little too syrupy for my liking. Doesn't fit well with the toned down hops palate."
"All-in-all, I thought this was a very good."
"D: Pretty good. This one isn't too heavy, and is right about ""on"" in regards to the amount of hops. Nice interpretation of the style, I like the creativity. Recommended."
"Thanks, boolshot"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip - a very nice bronze hue. A good amount of head is visible at first and retention is decent. Smells like pine and citrus - powerful & engrossing. Taste is very citrusy with a hop punch to back it up. This is a really great IPA, but the carbonation is a bit much. I also feel a slight burning in the aftertaste. Regardless, this is a recommendable brew."
"Originally reviewed on August 1, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Rich floral aroma of ruby red, replete with Cascade and a tinge of lemon peel. A hazed pour of light hazel, with an gentle orange fringe. Flavor is a loose flowing sweet cream and candied peaches, bolstered with a heavenly rich sinuous curve of candied resin hops. The malt is in nice balance, I feel. The alcohol plays sweet and helps carry the hop flavors. It all mingles together in general harmony. If I have much bad to say, its that the malt body is a touch thin and the hop character a little one dimensional, lacking diversity and a bit too vegetal. Otherwise, a rich quenching IPA with nice flavor."
"D: Wonderful example of the style. Easy drinking with a nice bitterness Wish I could snag a few more of these--on tap must be amazing. Seek this out if you can."
"Good stuff. Refreshing. Hoppy, but not at all overboard."
"Hazy, dark orange with coppertone body. Small, but persistent, off-white head. Nose is mostly yummy hops; very citrusy with pineapple and some background sugar wafer malt. Nice. Toasted bitterness up front quickly turns to citrus and resin hops. Mid-palate finds sugary, fruity malt. Finishes bitter and dry and appetizing. Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy feel. Pretty good."
"This is quite drinkable for a strong IPA. The aftertaste isn't as cloying and long lasting as others of its kind. The sediment floating around was a turn off though."
"D: Nice drinking IPA. Good balance with nice flavor."
"taken from the fridge of dirtylou and smuggled back"
"I found this to be flavorful and highly drinkable. I may have to track down some more of this one."
"Pours a very hazy caramel color with an OK head. The aroma was very floral (naturally), with some sweeter notes too. Good. had some citrus notes upon tasting, with a fine hoppy finish, just like a good IPA should. Pretty decent mouthfeel, somewhat smooth and creamy for an IPA. Relatively easy to consume. Overall, this is a good IPA, although there are great IPAs out there that I'd choose before this one."
"Served from a bottle with no freshness date. Poured a hazy honeycomb color with a nice head. Great retention. Smells of hops and citrus. Taste begins with the hops, finishes light and buttery. Mouthfeel is a tad creamy, which I like for IPAs. Overall, good drinkability. The hops could be more complex, but this beer is still a good example of an IPA."
"Crooked Tree isn't the prettiest IPA I've seen, but all the other elements are terrific. I will drink this again."
"Drikability is very nice. As a matter of fact, I think I'm gonna go crack another one."
"Highly recommended"
"The hops were much more pronounced in the flavor. The malts were sweet and a bit fruity. Also, got quite a bit of woodiness flavors. Medium body but a bit too much acidic clinginess for me. The hops really linger but not as bad as some other beers. But just enough for me to feel like I chomped into a Christmas tree."
"Pours a dark peach in colr and hazy, small off white head fades quickly. Smell is sweet, citrus and sweet white grape juice, a little grapefruit, and some piney hops. Piney-ness is more prevalent in the taste with just a little citrusy hoppiness and malt sweetness underlying the pine flavor. Light to medium body. Raw bitter hop bite in the finish, nice and dry, also some alcohol evident in the rough finish. Pretty good ipa, the finish is pretty harsh but may please some hopheads."
"The odd mouthfell hurts the drinkability also."
"Mouthfeel is somewhere between fizzy and flat....I guess Id say its medium. Very smooth going down. Excellent drinkability. I could hammer these back with no problem. A nice hop bomb with just enough malt for balance. Dark Horse has my attention with this brew, and makes me want to try more of their offerings. Thumbs up."
"Not a bad IPA, just not something I'd go out of my way to obtain. If I can get Dark Horse, I'm going for the Black Bier hands down."
"I bought this for a trade I was going to do but I found out I havemt had it so I drank it. from the bottle. poured a nice honey with a big fluffy off white head that left some good lacing. aroma metallic hops, orange, flavor dry hops, pine, grapefruit with hints of lemon. dont think this is going to be one of my IPAs I come back to"
"Bright apple juice color with plenty of haze on the pour. Piney, oily hop aroma with a touch of citrus backing -- it's an unbalanced nose, but a good one for what it is. Biting citrus acidity on the initial taste followed up by a touch of alcoholic sweetness and a touch of metal. The finish is long and quite bitter, with little in the way of malt to attentuate the hops. Mouthfeel is full of fine carbonation. Overall, this one is a good IPA if you're looking for a hop fix."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange color. Minimal head and zero lacing. Smell is very citrusy (grapefruit, lemon) with a noticable grassy scent too. Strong grapefruit taste up front. Bitterness follows and really grabs your attention. Strong presence of resin hop oils in the tail end. Finish is bitter but in a nice way. This is a good ipa that leaves you wanting another."
"D - Good without being great. Easy to drink, but not engaging. A decent IPA in a sea of many other lesser IPAs."
"Pours a hazy peach with not much head or lacing to speak of. Smell is flowery with hops, along with alcohol fumes, and juicy citrus aspect. Pretty typical average IPA smell. The taste is more of the same. The floral hops are dominant here along with a very strong bitterness in the finish, and a pininess also shows up in force, along with a strong dryness. There is also some detectable alcohol. It's tasty, but I would pick several other regional IPAs above this one to drink on a daily basis. The mouthfeel is also nothing special and comes off as a little too thin. The bitterness and lack of malt balance hinders the drinkability."
"drinkability: nice, could drink a few"
"thanks to hoppymeal for this one..."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable. This would be one of my session beers of choice if it were around Iowa."
"Orange. Strange smelling, hoppy with a large emphasis on fruits, apricots and peaches in particular. Not much in the nose besides hops. Flavor is more of the same. Straight hop juice and not much else. Hoppiness brings forth various fruit notes (apricot, peach and lemon). Dry. Severely lacking malt flavor and body. Fizzy."
"Notes: Very drinkable IPA. If I could get this more often, I definitely would keep some in the fridge."
"Has a perky little smell. Citrusy and spritzy, but somewhat dry. Cloudy orange with tinges of light brown. Humongous fluffy white head. Bitter hops are the dominate flavor. Little malt backbone, but it is wetter than i expected and actually very refreshing. The hops really travel around your mouth well leaving a nice tingly fresh sensation."
"Tasty, very agreeable damn drinkable too. Will I remember this IPA a year from now? No. Did it kick ass right now? Yes. Live in the movement, Brent. IPAs, when done right, are fun to drink. This IPA was like a bad episode of The Simpsons, funny but I know funnier exists. Thank you RedHaze for the bottle; I enjoyed it."
"Beer is good! Happy IPA beering."
"Light amber with golden highlights under a medium sized creamy, dimpled head that leaves a clumpy, uneven, thick film, leaving a small amount of lace. Smells are light, just a bit of pale malt, and crisp spicy herbal hops. Flavors include hints of biscuit and cereal malts (unless you're eating hot wings, in which case the malts come out and this beer tastes even better than normal) somewhere under there. The hops are AMAZINGLY yummy, strong, herbal, floral, crisp, and in your face. Not burning your tongue resinously bitter, no way, not from this amazing MI IPA! Strong and assertive, very flavorful, but not overly bitter. Pale ale body with soft frothy carbonation. My dream beer, I must clone!"
"Music: ""Mishaps Happening"" by Quanitc"
"I loved this beer on tap. The bottle version was not nearly as complex as the fresh tapped version. If you are ever able to make it to Marshall, do yourself a favor and try this beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" light beige head above the honey amber brew. Pillowy head fades slowly, with heavy foam lacing. Aroma is prickly piney hops with some citrus interest as well. Taste is substantial malt sweetness upfront, but the hops kick right in and take over the joint. Hops burps are early and often, not that's anything wrong with that. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, and this brew was quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability...great stuff. I wish I could get this all the time. Great hop burp from this one."
"Not an overly complex IPA, but refreshing and true to style. Something i will be having again."
"Pours a hazy orange/brown, big off white head forms, some lace. Smell is very piney, caramel, bread and citrus. Taste is very grainy, pine, citrus, caramel and chocolate notes, but mostly grain. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and low carbonation. Not bad, but I'd say more close to a hoppy amber ale than an IPA. Thanks DrJay for the pickup."
"Taste; lots of citrus and floral hops up front, foloowed by a solid malt backbone, and has just a little bit of a grainy feel to it in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and a litlle slick from the hop oils. I think Dark Horse did a really nice job with this IPA, and now I'm going to have to look for the Double Crooked Tree the next time I'm in MI."
"Slight haze to this amber beer. Thin, off-white head that produced some nice lace. Bold, leafy and grapefruit aroma with a hint of pine. Bitterness was a little on the strong side for the weak malt character. Hops are finished by the end, and the thin malt leaves a hole in the flavour. Good texture with refined carbonation. Overall, it starts out with bold hops, but the flavour dies off too much by the finish for it to be highly recommended. Still good though and worth a try."
"Good grapefruit aroma, pine. Good appearance, darker yellow with lace. Pronounced leafy bitterness, too much I think. More aimed at the Maerican Hophead type as opposed to balance. Still good effort, serviceable IPA. Complements to Dr. Jay for sharing."
"Just my second offering from Dark Horse...look forward to trying a few more in the near future."
"Update 8/20/06: Thanks to a bottle I recieved in a trade from grynder33 (if I recall correctly) I was able to try this beer again and it was leagues ahead on the bottle I had before. I wasn't able to take notes but I am going to update my ratings."
"Mouthfeel is big and chewy with a hefty malt body to hold up the hoppiness. Good carbonation helps this go down smoothly. I could easily enjoy a few of these...a well made IPA that leans to the bitter side. I hope to see more Dark Horse stuff around here in the future."
"Crooked Tree is a nice dark amber color with a good half-inch, tannish head. It is a bit murky, but really the way an I.P.A. should look. Smells pretty basic for the style. Hops and floral notes distinguish the aroma. There is also a hint of citrus. While pleasant, nothing really stands out here. Tastes very strong, and somewhat bitter. Hops are very noticeable. Sharp, crisp and flavorful. Citrus hints remain on the back of the tongue. Again, very pleasant. In the mouth, this beer is full, biting and low in carbonation. The hops play on the tongue very memorably. Overall, I would say this is a very drinkable beer for hop-lovers. Not quite up to the level of Two-Hearted, and for the same price I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. However, it is a fine session brew for those who appreciate I.P.A.'s."
"Overall I would definitely have this again and my only regret is that its not available here. Again, much thanks to JRM for allowing me the opportunity to enjoy this."
"Pours a dirty hazy orange color with a finger of head that falls to a quarter inch over top. I'd like a little more copper and clarity. The nose is nice and balanced with a citrusy orangey hop, probably cascade, with a more subtle caramel malt backbone. Very nice. The flavor is slightly more earthy in the hop, though still sweet. A nice caramel flavor ties it all together. The feel is moderate to thick with a light carbonation. Incredibly drinkable beer. The nose and flavor are very nice. I would make this a session if I could get it more often."
"Pours and amber color with a medium head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of citrus hops - I'm thinking cascades. Little bit of caramel malt, but the aroma is mostly hops. The flavor has a certain spice from the hops as well as a lot of citrus, but the caramel malt backbone is there and it really smoothes things out. Very tasty. Medium mouthfeel and drinkability is good."
"[This was part of the ""Midwest Beer Barge"" trade with TikkiGodxxx - many thanks for giving me the opportunity to taste some fine Michigan Ales!]"
"Delicious orange glow with streaming carbonation bubbles. Traces of lace. Nose screams tangerine and papaya  unmistakable calling card of Cascade hops. Starts with a citrus-grove bitterness that gets slightly grainy and pith-filled in its middle. The hops work themselves down to the final finish of the beer, pulling the whole package away from the slightly overdone bitterness that seems like it would win out. Seems like a fully formed version of Mad Anthonys IPA  with a few rough edges. Still, a good and very drinkable IPA."
"Pours a hazy amber,golden color. Big hop aroma-grassy and very citrusy. Almost serious lemons!!! Big hop flavor-while bitter overall its very smooth tasting with a slight bitterness in the finish. Nice malty body-very well rounded and balanced for the most part. A very drinkable beer-Id like to try more from this brewery. Thanks to eyedrinkale for the ""upgraded"" trade sample."
"Mild piney hop aroma with a pinch of grapefruit. Moderately thick, creamy, light tan colored head. Hazy, dark apricot colored beer with some small floaties in the bottom ( pour carefully). Solid, mildly sweet malt backbone that mingles with some floral tea, light fleshy fruit, and bubblegum flavors. The finish is fairly bitter, and just a bit chewy. Mouthfeel is incredibly soft. A nice, tasty IPA. Thanks malty!"
"The mouthfeel seems a bit lighter than many other ipa's. Not as fullfilling as Two Hearted or Hop Devil. The one dimensional character of this beer hurts the drinkability."
"Good mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. I think this is a good beer and I would recommend. Very Drinkable."
"Pours a very hazy dark copper color with a large frothy off-white head. Good head retention, and some attractive sticky lacing. Some sediment has collected at the bottom of the glass, while some of it is still suspended in the beer. Good aroma of citrousy, slightly piney hops, with some nice floral esters. Decent toasty malt presence sets the stage for some very bitter hops. Grapefruit and orange peel are present, sharp on the palate, and a little prickly. Smooth mouthfeel broken up by resinous hops. A good rendition of an IPA, but it was better when I had it on tap."
"Heavily sedimented orange body topped by a thin off-white head. Strong bubble-gum and cotton candy aromas. Very strong orange flavors, nice and sweet up front followed by a very strong bitterness of tangerines. Amarillo hops, maybe? Really a nice orange flavor in there. Nice lingering bitterness with hints of orange on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly astringent. Drinkability is very good, partly due to the somewhat unique flavor profile. I must say that Dark Horse has impressed me during my visit to MI."
"The flavour feels mostly malt driven. Tiny bits of lemon or orange come in from the hops, but there is not a huge fruitiness. More of a grainy aspect. The hop presence reveals itself in full force in the bitterness however. Finishes dry too. This is an interesting beer. It has a some raw appeal."
"This Dark Horse offering comes with a murky orange color and a nice lofty off white head. Obviously unfiltered. Tons of lacing. Big aromas in here with lots of fruitiness and citrus flavors then hop resins laying on top. More grapefruit comes out in the taste but there's a good amount of spicy and floral hop flavors in there as well. High alpha acidic flavor. Toasted biscuit provides a small balance as well as a sweeter fruit element but its the rough, acidic resiny hops that take the show here, and I'm not complaining. Finish is dry and spicy. Mouthfeel is the only area where this beer really suffers because it is a bit rough (not clean) in the hop department and the body is slightly thin which seems to hurt the malts. Still, drinkability is quite good as I've really enjoyed these tongue burning high alpha acid IPAs as of late."
"I have never had a Dark Horse, but this first one is incredible, nice job."
"Michigan Beer Fest again. Golden amber in color, white head. Nice aroma, but not hop dominated as I expected. Flavor is well balanced, I detect some toasted malts behind the caramel. The hop flavor rises in the flavor, but the malt holds strong. This is nice and drinkable. Good stuff."
"This beer pours a lightly hazy copper color with a tan colored head. As I pour I get a solid aroma of hoppy grapefruit. As I go in for a deeper whiff I get notes of citrus, pine, tangerines, and a hint of toasted maltiness at the end. Lightly sweet up front with a dry maltiness, if that is not a contradiction. Quite a nice floral hoppiness up front as well. The combination of the hops and malt give this a nice citrus based fruitiness. The finish has a nice bitterness that gives this beer a certain zing to it. The finish is also quite dry, with a malty-biscuits type note to it. As I finish this beer the malt presence becomes stronger and more interesting, reminiscent of lightly toasted bread crust. This is quite a nice IPA, and is emminently quaffable."
"I'll definately have this again."
"Maybe I'm jaded or maybe there are a lot of breweries and homebrewers making eerily similar IPAs."
"Wyll-"
"trbeer gets the credit for getting me this one, thanks my man!"
"Smooth drinking, sufficiently carbonated. Very drinkable, highly recommended."
"Pretty, cloudy copper color with bare hint of head. Smells like grapefruit extreme, hops, and a slight whiff of plant roots? Tastes superb: for a change, ruby red grapefruit, hops all the way but begins with a wake-up call of astringeny; surprising smooth, long, hoppy finish: is it. . . light caramel? sweet cream? A winner."
"Murky ligh brown, like pale Dunkel Weizen, with a thin bubbly head. Grassy, slightly citrucy hops, grapefruit beneith a strong pine scent. Light malt lead followed by a pleasant hop bitterness with a slightly astringant finish. Good hop flavor and well done bitterness."
"Bready, crusty and loaded with flavors of caramel, grapefruit, hop crumbs, sour, seasoned oak, black iron and herb. A seductive, glycerin-rich texture supports the dynamic exchange of fine bubbles and tannic grip."
" Solid bitterness comes right in at the opening sip, punctuated with a muddled mix of hoppy fruit flavors, starting a bit peachy then erupting into bright grapefruit. There's a nice malty sweetness here as well, but the grapefruit hoppiness shines through. Bitterness lingers through to the finish with the hops becoming more apparent as the beer warms a bit more. Body is decidedly medium and mouthfeel is perfect for a nice hoppy IPA. I was very impressed, quite drinkable and extraordinarily tasty. Thanks to trbeer for this one!"
"Thank you to trbeer for the bottle. A solid IPA, with a nice drinkability, and certainly something that I'd have again."
"This is a damn good IPA. Pours a murky dark copper with all kinds of stuff floating around. Long lasting thick tan head. The aroma and flavor are all about citric, piney, resinous hops. Nice solid malty backdrop makes for a good mouthfeel. Seemed like a cruder Celebration to me, which isin't an insult in my book."
"Drinkability is slightly above average."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy deep orange color with two fingers of head. There is lots and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of floral hops, grapefruit, and orange. A fairly powerful aroma. The taste is also fairly hoppy, with way more citrus coming through. It's not as hoppy as a double IPA, but fairly close. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but still smooth. The drinkability is fantastic, and I could savor many of this great IPA."
"671"
"The body is a nice amber and leather glow. It's cloudy from the yeast I couldn't keep in the bottle (I like yeast in my beer anyway, plus the barely settled yeast is another sign of freshness.) The head is a nice off-white foam that hangs around nicely despite a sluggish start. The mouthfeel is the only thing that doesn't impress me. But maybe I'm just too distracted by the rest of it. Excellent, Excellent IPA."
"Another solid offering from Dark Horse; I wish their stuff was more readily available in my area. I had the IPA with a few friends after work yesterday, and grapefruit was the word of the day. That bitter ""grapefruit"" flavor is often subtle or somewhat understated in a lot of IPAs, but it's truly the dominant flavor in this beer. It's a very well-hopped ale and quite tasty. It's a little pink-ish looking and cloudy in appearance -- maybe more so than I'd like my IPAs to be. And it's a little too bitter to drink a lot of -- for me, anyhow -- but it's a good beer."
"Had this awhile back when I found it in Mount Pleasant,nice bronze color with really nice head that left some lace.Very fresh and zesty smelling,tasted of grapefruit and was a little grassy.If ur a hophead I think u would really like this one,Iam not but I still really liked it."
"A very, very solid IPA. Pours out to an slightly, cloudy, amber color in the glass. Aroma is that of grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy as one might expect with an IPA with traces of a light fruit taste present. A fine beer. I am looking forward to trying Dark Horse's other offerings."
"A nose teeming with fruity hops. A flavor reminiscent of grapefruit juice, but with a big malt ass. An excellent IPA that would cure even the most viscious hop withdrawals. Hazy orange. Fat, sticky head. Perhaps a bit rough in the gullet, but who cares when the hops are rushing in like a dam break. Tasty!"
"This is a kick ass beer.  The buttery grassy aroma gives no hint of the bitter beast that lies within.  The malt balance is good for a strong muscled brew like this one."
