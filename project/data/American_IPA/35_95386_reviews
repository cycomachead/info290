"The only reason I rated this beer a little low is because I don't typically enjoy IPA's. I tried this one randomly, my friend didn't like it and poured it out. I proceeded to drink the rest of the 12 pack by myself because beer is beer and beer is good! Now I know that this is just what IPA's taste like so I can't say it was horrible, it was actually one of the better tasting IPA's I've had, but I wouldn't buy it again. I drank the whole 12 pack so that says something."

"DATE TASTED: April 5, 2015... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: second beer rating of Easter--another IPA... APPEARANCE: fresh, thick and foamy white head sits top a rather translucent body; head settles uniformly, leaving an attractive, even lacing... AROMA: grapefruit, yes--and the Simcoe provides unique flexing of hop muscle; the five hops work in unison to create an alluring swirl of pine and citrus smells... PALATE: a palpable, reasonable IPA with appropriate medium body and resinous aftertaste; thick and lively... TASTE: a smooth, mellow mix of hops mesh well with bready malts that suggest a metallic presence; still maintains the East Coast malt base that makes Sam Adams a bit different in the pale ale space...OVERALL: the floral/citric intensity makes this beer a treat; each sip provides a crunch, a bouquet, a blast of competing hops unlike any previous Sam Adams offering..."

"The flavor profile is reasonably intense, non-complex and balanced.  It's tasty and begins with a blend of hops (citrus, pine) over a light biscuit.  The middle brings a mild bitterness and a hint of caramel.  The finish is almost dry and leaves a mild rind like bitterness.  A good starter IPA, but hardly what I would classify as West Coast Style."
""
"Not a fan of Sam Adams so not much expectations here.  The smell was good when first opened but faded quick.  Not much smell at all. The taste is mild but not bad.  Good feel and finish.  Overall not bad.  Kind of plain and for the amount of hops they advertise it didn't come through.  But would drink again."

"O: This could be the Boston Lager of IPAs: it's highly drinkable, a great intro to IPAs, and still pretty good if you are a steady IPA drinker. Recommend to the experienced IPA drinker, and highly recommend to someone who's looking to get into IPAs. It's a good time!"
""
""
"Enjoy"
"Bottle: Poured a light orangey color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of citrusy and bitter hops is dominant. Taste is also dominated by citrusy hops with subtle notes of grapefruit and quite a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not sure I would say this is a west coast type IPA."
""
""
"O:  This is a good beer.  Sam Adams usually does their work and this beer is no exception.  I'd recommend this IPA!"
""
"Deep gold with thick, tight white foam. Smells like centennial hops with lemon notes. Green grass and grapefruit plus lemon zest. Medium lite mouthfeel. Resinous hoppy tongue coating. West coast, but not hop overpowering. Nice."

"Cheers."

"Not impressed. Was hoping for better from a great Brewery. Not really a West Coast IPA... Not enough hop taste and too much malt. Ok if you're looking for a mediocre IPA. I guess. You taste buds have been spoiled by Knee Deep Brewery and El Segundo"
""
""
""
" Medium-light bodied, light carbonation,  crisp finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good big brewery ipa"
"Nice light IPA. Great for a hot day when you are not looking for something with a lot of power and bite. A tiny bit pedestrian, but I would drink it again."
"Poor effort from a good brewery"
""
"Solid all around IPA. A nice offering from Boston Brewing Co."
""
"That said, it is still enjoyable. Grapefruit and pine hoppiness, with balanced malts. Strong fruitiness overall that is not consistent with American hops. Dry and spicy on the finish, but only low to moderate bitterness."
""
""
"Pretty good IPA, different. Readily available around me so its one of my go-to choices at bars"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass a basically clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonatino, with a nice one-finger fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly hoppy with some malt notes, very slight citrus. The taste is mostly malty, but with a very close maltyness, very slight citrus. Medium body. dry/bitter finish. Overall a tasty brew, but probably will not buy again."
""
""
""
"3.25 D:  It's not a bad beer, but it's not what I was expecting.  If I went in thinking this was a pale ale instead of a ""west coast IPA"" I probably would have been more satisfied.  Either way, it drinks easy."
""
"pleasant surprise if i do say so"
""
""
"Great tasting ipa for any occasion"
"O- Thankfully Samuel Adam's Rebel IPA finally became available in New Brunswick and I have to say that this is easily to best Samuel Adam's beer I've had to date. It simply has all of the characteristics you would want in an IPA. Nice malt and citrus flavours with an adequate hop bite. To Whomever is responsible for bringing this beer to New Brunswick: Thank you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very approachable IPA that if I tried blindfolded I would think it was Fat Tire. This is because I am a master of hops and I drink 85 IBU DIPAs like they were cream soda. However, everything about this beer is pleasant other than the cloudy appearance, but from the tap this wouldn't be an issue. If you are in the mood for Fat Tire but would like a buzz then I would highly recommend giving this one a try."
""
""
"It's legit.  Wasn't sure what I would think of Sam Adams' attempt at an IPA, but they did a very nice job.  Nothing surprising or bold, just solid.  I'll look for this on the menu next time I'm somewhere without an extensive beverage list."
""
"I had two large drafts of it at Buffalo Wild Wings. The first draft came in a more traditional Samuel Adams glass. The hops were very forward. Similar to other strong IPA's like Dogfish Head 60 Minute or Victory Hop Devil. I wasn't sure about ordering the large at first, but went after it and it remained sharp, but drinkable throughout. I did not have it with food. The lacing on the glass was very nice. The 2nd one was a more traditional double pilsner glass. So I think the first one held together a bit better. Overall, very nice hoppy ale."
""
""
"Scent of tangerine. Medium body. Pretty smooth. Reminded me of blue moon with strong hop finish."
""
"Overall- A good IPA that gives good definition of the style. Malty and hoppy. Not over the top but that is representative of SA brews. Really this is a well done IPA. Solid B for sure."
""
""
""
"Favorite tasting ipa of mine"
"It seems Sam Adams has gotten a bad rap among craft beer drinkers lately. I think if one was to get this beer not knowing who made it, their taste buds would be free of prejudice. Admittedly I was skeptical when picked this IPA up today, but was pleasantly surprised. It has nice aroma, the taste is fruity but could use a little more bite and the feel is ok. This is not in the same league as say Lunch by Maine Beer Company, but it's not bad and quite drinkable."
"Taste: Kind of falls flat for me. More bitter than I was expecting from the smell."
"Great taste and great value."
"One of my favorite IPA's, give it a try!"
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like carbonated grapefruit juice.  Not good."
""
"A good beer, but well below average for an IPA. 6.5% Alcohol. Get this beer only if it's the only IPA  on draft (besides Davidson's or Schmaltz- which should find another line of work, since they really don't know how to brew beer)."
""
""
""
""
"Decent IPA, doesn't blow you away at all but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not too bad, can taste the malt, seems to get better with every sip.  Not sure I would by again, just not impressed"
"My first foray back into IPA's and it got better with every sip, by the end I was sad it was gone.  Really solid and pretty affordable, I would buy again for sure."
""
"Well at least hey tried. I expect more from Samuel Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this is a great beer but it could be more hoppy. I love the malts though and the timed release of the various flavors is excellent. Save this one for a lazy Sunday when you don’t want to drink too much but are in the mood for a calm IPA."
"Not an IPA fan but"
"Not as robust and complex as its tougher sibling, Rebel Rouser, but it isn't bad..."
"I think this is a well crafted beer, surprisingly drinkable, reasonably priced and easy to find on tap."
""
""
"Looks like a lager. Not a bad go to IPA since it is available in a can. However, there are many, many better options.....but the price..."
""
""
"IPAs are usually hits or misses with me. I can confidently say that this one is a hit. Pours a nice orangey somewhat coppery color with a white head that last until the last sip. The aroma did not have as strong of a citrus aroma I like in IPAs but it was present. The taste is better than most IPAs I have tried in my opinion, full of nice hoppy goodness. Overall it's a really solid brew."
"I always think I'm going to like it, and every time I'm disappointed. Very sub-par beer. I'm not sure why, but every time I have had it, whether out of the bottle or on tap it tastes like soap to me. Giving up on this one"
"Would purchase and drink again."
""
"Quality west coast style IPA. Ideal temperatures: 37-41 degrees. Would be well-paired with a burger or steak"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can be better a little sweet"
"Quite honestly this is not a bad IPA. It's not daring, yet not generic. The aroma is nice, not overpowering, the look is not what I would expect from a typical IPA, but it drinks fair."
""
""
"Overall: None its feature are overly pronounced, but, still, it's a decent, if a bit basic IPA."
"Overall, this is drinkable. It's not unpleasant. Sierra Nevada Torpedo it's not. I probably won't buy this again, though I will finish the cans I did purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good in a pinch.  Great price."
""
"Wonderful, smooth grapefruit forward IPA with a very pale, amber pour with thin soapy head.  Excellent & very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Clear, deep golden color. Thick, frothy head with lots of lacing.  Citrusy flavor gives way to floral hops and a good bitterness from the hops which lingers for a bit. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but not bad."
"Had long neck bottle poured into frosted mug at a restaurant.  I'm new to drinking beers and the only other IPA I have ever had was Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale.  This IPA was very good."
"O:  Good beer.  Better than expected."
""
""
""
""
"Write"
""
""
""
"One of S.A. best shows of a ""Craft"" beer and one I feel I will be purchasing again."
"Hoppy and bitter and not much else.  Doesn't seem to have the right mouthfeel"
""
""
""
"Another mediocre IPA from Sam Adams.  Would not go out of your way to try this.  If there is nothing else, it is okay."
""
""
"Love it, but I have had better so not my favorite. I will buy it again!!"
""
""
""
"Very little flavor - barely noticeable hops.  Definitely not what I was expecting from an IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall, this review has been a long time coming.  We've routinely sipped this guy at trivia night when the mood struck, and it easily satiated that ravenous IPA craving.  When fresh it keeps a nice lightness to it, and makes it easy to return to again and again.  Put a little age on it, however, and things drop off rather quickly.  The grain bill starts to seep adjuncts, which can effectively box out some of that resinous, oily hoppiness that you're looking for.  Again, this is a nice, standard, base IPA, but it won't change much for you if you've had more than a few from the style, or from Sam Adams."
""
"Overall- A really good IPA that stands out among many of its competitors."
"Good taste. Hoppy flavor with a kick."
"O - This is a pretty good AIPA, strong hop but no nasty lingering bitter, easy drinking, light and crisp, not gonna hunt this one down, but would certainly drink again if available"
""
"Overall: Not what i was expecting at all. I would say the Boston lager is closer to an IPA than this is. Always loved Sam Adams but they let me down on this one by calling it a west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a ok IPA, I think they should remove the ""west coast style"" on the side of the bottle. This is nothing like a west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"If im at a bar with the standard run of the mill selections, ill pick this over magic hat or goose anytime. Its a solid beer, not exciting, over the top, or amazing. But a good drink non the less."
"Very nice west coast style."
""
"For the amount of hop varieties they used to create their interpretation of a West Coast IPA, nothing stood out. Sam Adams does one thing consistent - no matter what style of beer they produce - it all shares a similar taste profile. Maybe I'm crazy. I've yet to drink any of their offerings and be blown away. If you're an IPA enthusiast who's been around the block more than once, don't expect to get anything remotely close out of this that compares to some of your favorites. Beyond mediocre and, quite comical, given Koch's cavalier attitude towards aggressively hopped beers. Anyone can do it? I disagree. I'd drink this over BMC, but that's not really saying anything, is it?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: To a certain extent I guess you can't take the east coast out of the east coast brewer; it's just not the 'wild' west and a certain amount of balance needs to be maintained! (On the other hand, west coast brewers used to be less heavy-handed). In this case, at least, the balance is pristine. It might not be the strongest IPA, and it's certainly not the hoppiest, but it delivers everything that's asked of it in one beautifully wrapped up bundle. Quite enjoyable and remarkably drinkable."
""
""
"Sam Adams has always been able to create Top of The Line Specialties. Great Well balanced hoppy taste. Stay on the porch if it's to much for you."
"Great taste, really enjoyable on tap. Smooth and flavorful!"
""
"Captures the essence of west coast hops with its citrus flavor. full flavored and satisfying. Pours a clear amber, head that dissipates quickly while lacing the glass as you sip. Very glad to see Sams go for a signature IPA. This will help them compete with other local boston brewery Harpoon and their solid and very popular IPA."
""
""
"Light straw, pillowy white foam. Crisp star fruit, bright grapefruit and tangerine, lite grass. Crisp and clean, more bitter than fruit finish."
"12 oz. bottle at Nick's Country Bar in Alexandria, VA; unknown brewing/packaging dates but best by April 2015; drank out of the bottle over 30 minutes"
""
"Just felt like it lacked a real IPA flavor.  Maybe watered down or something.  Less than average to me."
"Unusual product.  I really liked it when it first hit the market. It's as if my taste buds have gotten bored with it. Great beginning taste; seems to lose something toward the middle of the bottle/glass. I seldom drink a second. Some IPA tastes stay in my memory and I crave their taste. I started that way with this; but now it's a second or third choice when I go through my beer pantry."
"Tastes more like a lager. barely any hoppy taste. It would be disrespectful to call this an ipa"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good flavor but not enough of a finish. Took me a few 12 pks to get bored of it. Overall worth a try especially for the price range."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not too shabby. Widely available and will do just fine in a pinch."
""
"Good effort on Sam's part.  Not sure if the nailed the ""West Coast"" taste but have to be honest first Sam I have liked in while.  Everyone has their own taste, I love super hoppy IPA's, this would be a great beginners IPA I think.  But my opinion doesn't count.   Cheers!! Passion for the Craft."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. Not going to blow you away but very solid. When you find yourself in a strange town gas station with limited options in need of a six pack its a great go to.  don't be ashamed. No one is watching"

"A respectable mainstream IPA.  Not at the level of other notable IPAs but certainly a welcome addition to the SA lineup and widely available at your local c-store."
"O: NOt a bad beer but pretty much mid-pack for American IPAs."
"I have nothing against this Sam Adams IPA.  Sure, it's not the best IPA in the world.  Personally I prefer Ballantine IPA or Founders, but generally the taste meets my specifications, and it's not watery as some other critics attest (but mine was on tap, perhaps making all the difference).  Overall, Sam Adams is a bit more tepid than other IPAs I have had, but still a solid beer."
"Just another watered down very light brew from sam. It's to attract mainstream snobs and nothing else. It lacks in all areas. I'm not impressed at all. Tsk tsk..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Disappointing lack of any aroma before the first sip."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is pine and very light grassy/dank notes. The flavor is light grapefruit, biscuit malts, very light sugar notes, a hint of tropical fruit and a dry finish."
""
"Not bad. Had right after drinking an amber ale. It had a distinct peach or apricot flavor after the amber ale. Not amazing but for being a someone mainstream beer, defiantly something I'd pick  up again for a night with friends"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I give this a 4 because I wish it was lower in alcohol. That is really the only thing that I can detract. As a homebrewer, I'm going to make one like this but with more body and a bit  more sessionable, somwhere around ±3%."
""
"Pours clear golden yellow with a tiny head, smells almost pickle-like with many hops as well, tastes malty and piney up front with a dry hop finish, mouthfeel is average slightly creamy."
"O: Doesn't really fit the bill of a West-coast IPA imho. Interesting smells and tastes from this, but not enough of the hop taste I have grown fond of in IPA's."
"Nice but a smidge too bitter for me."
""
""
"Pours a golden-yellow in color with a white head. Lots of lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is of hops and pine for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste and the typical bitter finish from the hops. Overall, I drank the 3 ounce sample and glad it wasn't a 12 ounce bottle because it wouldn't of been finished. Well...by me anyway since I don't like IPA's. MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
"Best Sam Adams beer For sure"
""
"Lightly hopped ipa, not much really standing out. For this many varieties of hops I would expect much more hop flavor. Overall just another well balanced ipa with some subtle spicy and floral hop notes behind a nice malt base."
"Nice and balanced with hints of citrus notes"
"Just stop!!!! Samuel Adams every beer you attempt to make a single flavorful selection is over powered by a single note. Its obvious this beer is too!!! Much Grapefruit. The smell and the horrible after taste is too strong of the fruit that you would make penicillin from. I wanted a hoppie beer as you advertised on the label not a overpowering grapefruit smirnoff ice."
""
""
"A bit of an underwhelming beer. Medium golden color and smells of light grassy, piney notes. Taste was similar with a slight bitterness that lingers a bit before fading. It feels a bit light for an ipa. Overall not a bad IPA by any means but not one that stands out of the crowd.I would  prefer more of a hop presence in this beer, but  with the price and availability for me it actually is a decent beer to bring to tailgates or parties, and share with IPA newbies."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not great. I'll drink it occasionally when on tap but not my first choice. Great beer to get people away from bud lite and the likes. Consider it a ""beginners IPA"" nothing too complex or too hoppy"

"A workingman's IPA. On draft in a pint glass at a local sports bar. Slight citrus whiff in the nose. Yellow gold color with moderate lacing, and a middling hoppiness for the style. An IPA I could session with -- in moderation. This is a decent, middle of the road IPA. I doubt I would buy it for consumption at home, but there are certainly far worse to be had for drinking when out and about."
"An approachable IPA that's moderately hopped and not too complex.  Worth a try, especially if you don't like the hop bombs."
""
"O: Overall I like the direction they were going in, but it falls a little flat, and comes across a little watery.  Not bad, but not outstanding."

"Overall impression:  A solid West Coast offering.  I wish Sam Adams would make more stuff like this.  They are a solid brewer that can make popular solid offerings.  Worth a try."
"Hop-on-training wheels. Maybe the bridge beer to more (better) hoppy offerings."

"Single 355 ml bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. A deep golden color with two fingers of creamy, frothy head, off-white in color. Aroma is low key yet fresh hops, citrus (grapefruit and orange) with a whiff of tropical fruit layered over a dry biscuit and light caramel base. Maybe some orchard fruit as well, apples and peach. Palate features distinct Cascade notes, grapefruit and perhaps something slightly catty or currant-like, under-ripe papaya, lemon rind, tobacco ... There is the usual Sam Adams toasted nutty malt vibe that is perhaps a deviation from strict interpretations of this style but is not out of place here. Almost a gingerbread spiciness. West coast hopping but Old World malting. Mouthfeel on the light side, not particularly chewy with moderate to high carbonation. Nice oils from the hops. I must say, its a solid IPA from a large craft brewer better known for lagers (yes, craft can be large!) ... Amped down in flavor from a hops perspective compared to many but this does not have to be a derogatory statement. The key elements are all there and the brewery still managed to feature its signature strengths."

"Pours with a very small, white head. Is light amber in color with no murkiness present. Has aromas of grapefruit and hops.  Initial taste is of grapefruit and hops. Citrus flavors from the cascade hops finish off the taste. Bitterness is low for being an IPA thanks to the sweetness of the grapefruit. It somewhat ruins the expectation from this IPA."

""
""
""
""
"So much better than I expected. I would drink a lot of this."

"A delicious beer ordered from tap. Had a half inch of head and had a savory after taste that went well with my food. A hoppy Sam Adams with a golden yellow color."

"Enjoyed a pint draft at the local...I've had the Sierra Nevada and the Dogfish Head 60 minute, which I loved, but was pleasantly surprised by the Rebel. Refreshing, easy to drink, nice hops but without the overwhelming citrus and bitterness.  I really liked this beer...might have found a new go-to."

"IPA made for the masses. No citrus, no grapfruit, light hops, pretty much PBR with a slight hoppy flavor added in to satisfy the lame name. Should be called Whitebread IPA."

"The best thing Sam has come out with in a long time, this is great sessionable IPA and I hear its going to be in 12 pack cans soon, that will be beyond great! Perfect Ipa for easy drinking hop goodness"
"Not a bad rendition of a west coast ideal from that totally opposite coast, as it were.  It picks up on the trendy dank and floral notes to a tee, and keeps everything else quiet and on the down-low.  Yup, Sam Adams all the way."
""
"A very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Deep golden colored and crystal clear.  An inch thick of off white head and Brussels lacing are present.  The nose is a blend of tropical and piney hops with the former in the lead.  The mouth initially provides a crisp coppery bitterness.  The back of the palate is more of a tropical bitterness with notes of pineapple.  The mouth provides a light stickiness."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is an okay IPA.  There is a nice finish and drinkability aspect to it and I find it relatively refreshing.  Otherwise it lacks complexity and full flavor."

"This beer is good.  Too good for a mass produced IPA.  So smooth.  Nice IPA finish.  The balance is superb.  You only know you have drank an IPA from the aftertaste.  Killer finish.  Like walking in the woods and biting a pine tree.  The alcohol is hidden.  Some science behind this one as  your usual IPA ain't this smooth."

"Marketed as west coast style and i don't know what that means but i tried it anyway because i like beer.  The smell of this beer was really sweet.  It was so sweet i thought it was a fruit beer which i really do no like.  Fruit should be hard as rock in a cake around Christmas time, but that is a story for another time.  Anyway, this IPA from Sam Adams has a bit of hoppiness that dissipates rapidly.  It feels OK and it looks OK but there is nothing daring about this - in my mind the brewmaster was trying to please everybody."

"Overall a really good, very reasonably priced IPA.  Availability is really good as well so this beer could turn into a go to very quickly in my opinion."

"This is a very drinkable IPA with a refreshing taste; clean, light body; and an enjoyable flavor.  I love the fruitiness of the beer - particularly the element of citrus on the nose and pallet - and how they blended it with the dry hoppiness of it's character."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a medium white head, slowly fading with moderate lacing. Aroma is biscuit malt, floral hops, some citrus and grapefruit notes. Taste has some mild caramel malt, citrus, tangy grapefruit and mild orange flavor, mild bitterness. A medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. Finishes with a well balanced malt and hops bitterness, has a nice citrus, grapefruit tanginess with mild orange flavor. Overall well made enjoyable brew."

"I am on a run of IPA's and this was a solid 3, but not eventful enough to move up.  Decent hops and pretty solid which I can say about almost all of Sam Adams beer.  I would drink it again and if it was the only IPA at some places, I would get it over some other nationals.  The smell and taste were good and it works its way up from the start which is not startling but takes a minute to get used to."

"A good looking beer. Pale amber with a billowing white head and lots lace. A sweet malty nose it's quickly followed by pine and a welcome light yeast ester fruitiness. Tongue dances with malt. Caramel and toasted grains. Then the hops combination swoops in like a tropical wind. Pine, citrus, hop oil. Lots. Still a smooth holy hoppy ale. Tropical fruit and firm bitterness. Crisp, long, oily finish. Clean hop oil linger. Velvety feel. Microfine carbonation. Quenching swallow. While the label proclaims this a west coast IPA think of it as a smooth big, hop oily rest cost style nod Rio the west. Highly drinkable and refreshing. I like this one a lot."

"Very light yellow color. Similar to a general lager. Love the aroma. Nice earthy hop smell. Some pine in the smell too. Taste pretty darn good too. I like the earthy resin flavor from the hops in this one. I also think it’s plenty bitter. I like those super hop bombs, so I’m happy I found one I like with less IBUs."
""

"Very good"
""

"Pours a golden/copper color with a white head that trails the glass a bit. The smell was full of hops and gave a fruity lemon and floral scent. Although it was a lot of hops, the caramel notes from the malt were able to be picked up as well. The taste was crisp and bitter from the hops with some grapefruit notes in the beginning. A very well done and refreshing IPA."

Taste again having a good balance of the hops offsetting the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation.  Overall nothing fancy, just a good IPA."

"Samuel Adams really knows how to make a really good west coast IPA. This was a good example."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a patch foam; light slippery lacing. Aroma of mild bready malt, citrus and grassy hops, hints of tropical and stone fruit. Flavor is neutral malt with an immediate burst of hop alpha oils, resinous, but without much herbal flavor. Finish is grassy, citrus hop bitterness and a slight buttery flavor. Medium bodied. Not quite my idea of a West Coast IPA, but maybe I'm spoiled. It's almost unfair to compare an East Coast hopped beer of unknown age or storage to the readily available fresh West Coast ales made nearby, but here and well within its drink by date (October). A nice IPA, but does not have lively, herbal hop flavors that would make it great. I feel like Boston Beer sometimes pulls their punches in order to a make pleasant ales that won't offend anyone, and this may be the case here. I hope that fresh from the brewer this is a good representation of a West Coast style IPA, but this bottle does not make that cut. Has the right hop profile and tastes OK, but I won't revisit it."
""
""
"Hands down my favorite Sam Adams offering. They nailed a WC IPA"
""
"poured a nice golden color with a big white head that laced quite well. Aroma is floral, hoppy and citrus. Flavor is pretty balanced with hops and citrus. Nice hoppy, crisp finish that leaves just the right amount of lingering taste, A very good IPA and one that I will drink again"

While it might be fun, exciting and adventurous, this rebellion is nothing to worry about unless the populi prefer the secret punch of aftertaste weight from a mildly hoppy, light flavor but heavy taste... Aftertaste."

"Yeah... This beer is not rebelling against anything. The overload on cascade hops is somewhat... no, it's exactly like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The main difference between the Sierra Nevada pale ale and this beer is that the Sierra Nevada is original and has a better finish than the chinook doped contraption conceived by sam adams. Since the price is virtually the same for a 6 pack. Go with the original. Go with Sierra Nevada"

"Seems like Sam Adams is trying too hard to rip off the heat that Brew Dog has created... especially with the label... it's a below average American IPA.

"The beer is clear and light golden with ample effervescence and an inch of white head. Aromas of that distinctive Sam Adams malt, followed by light pine and some biscuit / grain character. Decent flavor, albeit not particularly hop forward. Definitely a ""balanced"" ale moreso than what is generally considered great IPAs these days. A bit harsh and dry on the palate, finishing bitter. Eh..."

"At first I thought my bottles were old but the best by date still has 2 months left. Then I thought it was just a bad bottle but I had another from that same 6 pack and it was just as bad. What a bummer. I've had this a couple times on draft and was really impressed that Sam Adams had stepped outside themselves to brew a quality west coast IPA but that doesn't seem to translate to the bottle at all."

"So while I think Rebel IPA is a really good beer; an introductory IPA, contradictory to what their marketing suggests, I'm against the weak 45 IBUs but more so against what I might consider as false marketing. Either go big to hang with what you're tying to emulate or bill the beer as what it is; a really solid, drinkable IPA."

""
"Poured a clear golden orange body with two finger head that is foamy and slowly dies and leaves patches on glass. Typical IPA smell as I am hit with citric notes aplenty along with touches of caramel and dry malt. Smooth, easy to drink, crisp finisher, not a bad IPA at all, just an IPA that has a good chunk of hoppy citric flavors that are dry and there just isn't too much going on in this beer."

"16 oz can bought from a Circle K convenience store in S.Salem OR. $1.99 Pours a clear golden colour with a large thick almost pure white head. OK hop aromas lemon zest, pink grapefruit, slightly floral but not over the top. Flavour is less distinctive..mainly citrus hops but is balanced by the bready malts. Mouthfeel is fine..carbonation medium. Pretty lack luster ""West Coast Style"" IPA..but its drinkable enough"

"Poured a nice clear amber color with a three finger white head that receded to a one finger white head leaving little lacing. A nice looking IPA, true to form. Scents of tropical fruit, mostly pineapple, with very faint orange and citrus aromas and malt sweetness. Extremely sweet and fruity for a West Coast style IPA, with none of the pine or even grapefruit that the style usually has in abundance. The aroma notes that do hit the style are nice though. Taste begins with a moderate level of hop bitterness, with notes of bitter citrus pith and a strong, fruity, semi-sweet citrus character, moving into some piney and slightly earthy hop flavors alongside a nice malt backbone. The finish is earthy, floral and slight piney hops. Aftertaste is earthy, floral and faintly pine hops with moderate levels of bitterness. Not the most bitter IPA, but it has a decent character that is fairly on point for a West Coast style IPA, though not the best example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a juicy feel and slight smoothness and a low level of carbonation. Easy to drink and smooth, a good mouthfeel that fits the style and keeps it refreshing. Overall this is a fairly good attempt at a West Coast style IPA from a brewery that usually just does East Coast stlye. However it lacks the full character of examples of the style from the West Coast. Not a bad IPA by any means, but it falls just a bit short."

"Pours with an explosive tan head with a flourishing of bubbles through the middle of this clear, yellow-red brew. A little grainy and sweet aromatically. Some hops find their way in alongside some tea leaves. Also has some hops and light fruit on the tongue. Built like a good APA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: It has plenty of hop flavor and bitterness thought out. Its hop character is mostly citrusy and floral. The malt is light and somewhat bready and cracker like. It really just sets up the hops to shine. I would say that it has a firm medium body and the finish has a nice slow hop bitter fade."

"My aggro pour produced a solid finger of dense, tawny, rocky head with great retention that began to form great lacing as it fell. Color was a deep-gold (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity and lo and behold! my pals, Croesus, Mammon and Midas were lined up for a taste. Nose was subtle like a sledgehammer to the back of the head! It was a riot of grapefruit and pine and made me wonder who they thought they were zoomin' with that verbiage. All beers should smell like this. It was like an icebreaker cutting through my sinus cavity. Mouthfeel was medium, even kind of soft, with flavors of orange, tangerine, grapefruit and pine. This was a hophead's dream! Finish was dry, sure, but not gaspingly so. I really liked the way that they had shown restraint in getting these flavors without imparting a saturated-like mouthfeel. Would I drink this again? Is Sochi, Russia located on the Black Sea? Is it too much to ask them to put it in a CAN?"

"The Rest: Not a bad beer. Body is just on the thin side of medium, carbonation is good and its quite drinkable. The weak nose and lack of complexity keep this one from competing with the best from the west coast."

"It's a solid enjoyable IPA."
"D: a good beer for sure, but might fall a little middle of the road all things considered when you say ""west coast style IPA"". just missing that uber bright citrus explosion I expect when a beer is advertised as such. regardless, a good brew non-the-less."
""
"I wanted to try something new on tap while visiting Chasers for the first time, and this was the only one I hadn't yet had before. Done. It pours a clear sunrise brass topped by a half-finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises flowers, mild grass, very mild pine, and a soft breeze of caramel in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, the flowers and grass a touch brighter, but not very much at all. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay IPA at best, overtly mild and approaching boring."

"Possibly the best IPA I have had to date. For the longest time I wasn't much of an IPA fan - way too bitter for me. But, I do try to stay open minded and so I try, and I have discovered the magic of acquiring the taste for IPAs. I am no expert, but I know what I like and don't and this IPA hits the spot with me. Not so bitter, a distinct smell and slight taste of oranges, and what I experience is a crisp IPA that leaves me, surprisingly, wanting more."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops oils, citrus hops, sweet malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight floral hops, sweet malt, hint of hop oils, hint of grass, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, simple aroma, good body, and complex body."
"O: a decent take on the style neither pushing the boundaries nor taking the style to new heights, this is a reliable ale for the style."

"Best looking beer on tap at a local golf course in fact maybe the only craft. Gotta love that frosted pint in an actual Samuel Adams Rebel IPA glassware. Classis grapefruit aroma. Quite satiating and nothing out of place to twist the noggin. Malt sweetness and hoppy enough. Creamier mouthfeel. My brother (who is not into the craft scene) tasted it and replied it was pretty tasty and 'it sure is hoppy but not offensive'. Interested now to see how the bottle fares, but this is a definite go to on tap wherever I may be."

"I can't stand Sam Adams as a whole. However, being an IPA fan I decided to try this, as much as I really didnt want to. As I expected, it fell well short. They bill it as a ""West Coast IPA"" with 5 varieties of hops. I had modest at best expectations, as maybe this beer would be slightly better than their normal offerings. It's not a bad drinking beer - in fact it's probably just about the best they offer in terms of drinkability. However this is a sham of an IPA. Its an extremely weak version, and reminds me that Sam Adams is so much in the same league as the major brewers than they are with the craft brew industry. Koch is trying to offer this beer to the craft brew segment, and it just falls so much short as expected. Keep spending millions on advertising Jimmy, portraying yourself as this eclectic, against the grain, craft brewery. You guys lay in the same bed as the majors."
"O- It's drinkable but nothing stands out to make want to have this again."

"o. Overall this is not the best offering from Sam Adams. Kudos to them for going a bit out of their element."

"16 ounce can, best before date of August 2014 printed on the bottom of the can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a light golden/orange color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like light citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, and some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and floral hops noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick, and it's smooth and easy to drink. It's not a bad brew, but for a beer billed as a ""West Coast Style"" IPA I think it's a weaker version of one. Still, I think it's worth a try at least once. $1.99 a can."

"I was hoping for a wallop of hops, but just got a meh IPA. Poured semi aggressively into a pint glass and ended up with an inch and half foamy white head which dissipated to nothing within a few minutes. A little lacing as it's being drunk. Straw to gold in appearance, smell of malt mainly without any hops. Taste of bitter citrus as if you licked the rind of an orange and lime, pine in the aftertaste. Sticky mouthfeel after half a glass. Finished at 7 brix which leads me to believe that the wort started at an original gravity of 1.059 and finished at 1.008 which is pretty dry for an IPA. As the beer warms pine is overtaking the the citrus. Alcohol is not apparent until the very end of the glass so it's a sneaky one. I've had better. Sam Adams should just stick to their lager which is awesome only in the northeast region of the US. Once it leaves that area, it's nowhere near as good."

The taste was excellent, I enjoyed this very much. Samuel Adams has a pretty good one here, been surprising me lately, and one I will certainly pick up again at that cost, excellent value which gives it bonus points overall."

"O - Easy to drink, but it is hardly a revolutionary beer. If you want a true west coast IPA, forget about this one and look elsewhere."

"Overall: A lighter but decent take on a IPA. Kind of tastes like a session IPA with some laid back but solid hop notes."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a ipa glass. The body has golden color body with a small sticky head. The aroma is of citrus. The taste is of citrus and hops, I also get a little bitterness left on the tongue. Mouthfeel is good and overall a drinkable beer.

"A decent IPA. Not much remarkable, but nothing too unpleasant either. Feels a little carbonated, and the bitter is rather strong against the fruitiness of the hops. An OK effort from Sam Adams, and worth a try. For the price, not a bad beer to throw in the cooler for a day at the beach, but not a top notch beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of hops. Taste is light, bitter, some hops, refreshing but kind of mild for the style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Overall: Picked up a 6er since it was on discount at the store. Pretty good hop flavor, surprisingly light body for a 6.5% beer. A decent choice if you want an inexpensive hoppy beer."

"A respectable IPA if rather mundane nowadays. There is plenty of hop bitterness that kind of overshadows the mild, rather bland grain flavor. The bitterness does linger for a good, long time. Again, not a show stopper, but probably will appeal to beer drinkers looking a for a strong hop presence in the taste."
"This is above Okay as its subtle and easy but it never asserts itself to set it apart."

"Well, they tried and I will give them credit for that. This is most assuredly NOT a West Coast IPA. We can argue all day long what distinguishes a West Coast from an East Coast from a traditional IPA. When I think of a West Coast IPA, I think big hop taste. I think complexity. I think piney smells up front with a citrus finish. I think high IBU. This beer is none of these things. What it is, and I'm sorry to say should have been expected from the Boston Beer Company, is a compromise between a traditional IPA and a true West Coast IPA. In other words, The Boston Beer Company, in all likelihood, succeeded in brewing a beer that could, and will, been a compromise beer. True West Coast IPA fans will give this an average rating while those who are not accustomed to the big hoppy taste of true West Coast IPAs will find this a good introduction to the style. Overall, this is not a bad beer. Very drinkable without a doubt. Appearance is great. Rebellious...I think not."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is nice and easy drinking. A pleasant step off the beaten path for the Boston Beer company but not something that I think can really compete with the other offerings out there."

"I'm a bit shocked by the low ratings average that this received. This has everything I want in an IPA (a bitter combination of grapefruit, pine, and other citrus goodies). To me (and of course, like any review, it's totally and subjectively my opinion), this is the best IPA style offering that Sam Adams has; at least with regard to regular six-pack, non-seasonal or small batch releases...and I hope it's here to stay. Although I wouldn't trade my Torpedo for it, I won't hesitate to get it if the price isn't the oft' Sam inflated one."
""
"Overall - Not a bad ipa, but I find myself wanting a little more boldness and fullness in the flavors. The higher carb keeps the flavors (which are already on the lighter side) from asserting, and ushers in a bitterness that detracts from the flavors at the beginning of the quaff. Good price point and available anywhere."

"pours a copper color with decent head retention. Citrus smell. tastes of grapefruit and pine. mouth fill medium. overall I find this beer to be pretty enjoyable. Being one of the lower priced IPA's around, I'll be drinking more of this."

""
"O: Overall an alright level of bittering hops, flavor seems a bit safe, the nose was a bit fresh and wet. A decent everyday ipa that holds little surprise and will struggle to hold its own against more hop dominant ones. Decent, hardly a recommend, though will make for a good gate way beer for those new to style."

"Poured from a bottle with a golden yellow clear color and a white head that disappears quickly. Has a nice citrus and pine aroma. Flavor is grapefruit, pine, and medium bitterness. Has a medium body and a lightly carbonated mouthfeel. This is a pretty solid ipa that I would drink again."
""
""
"this is not a bad ipa- as far as it being a ""west coast"" ipa- i want to draw comparisons to the likes of stone, ballast point and green flash. it does have a nice grapefruit flavor and solid pine notes- i dont think that it plows its way through your mouth like some of the others- that however may make it more drinkable. overall its a good beer."

"Would like to try it on draft instead of the bottle, will go looking for it. Not much else to say, it is just a mild IPA that has nothing wrong with it, but it is just not outstanding compared to others I have had recently. As others mentioned, there is a sweet malt presence in it and the hops do not tamp it all down with bitterness. It would not surprise me to find ""noob"" beer drinkers might say it is the first IPA that they enjoyed,.... and ain't nothing wrong with that as long as it makes beer distributors notice that the letters IPA are a thing now and they should feel free to liberally stock other IPA's that have moved a little slow in the past for them."
""
"Eh. More bitter than I prefer, and lacking in hop flavoring, overall."

"O: This one lacks complexity and the overall wow-factor that the bigger IPAs possess, but Rebel IPA is nowhere near a bad brew. I found it to be easy-drinking, highly enjoyable, and the perfect beverage for dinner out with good company. Might be grabbing a pint of this again in the future."
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy white head that disappears fast. Almost no lacing. Smells of hops and a bit if citrus. Lemony orange with piney hops for decent bitterness. Medium light mouth that does coat the tongue well. It's an OK unremarkable IPA."

"underwhelmed by this, deceivingly named, as this isnt revolutionary at all, not distinct or memorable in any way, and certainly not likely to elicit social change. i hate to say that i bought this based on the tag line ""brewed for the revolution", but i did, mistake. not a bad ipa, but very generic, far from the best possible use of these hop varietals. super light in color and immaculately clear with a short lived inch or so of white bubbly head. it smells like diluted west coast ipa, hoppy but without any characteristic juice or fruity or sticky resinous anything. the hops are so plain, which surprises me for these heavy hitting varieties. it tastes like a beer ive had a million times before, not bad at all, its actually quite good, with a sturdy abv but a light drinking mouthfeel, but there is nothing revolutionary about it, and i am frustrated by its blandness, especially knowing sam adams can make such wonderful beer, hoppy beer too, but this just underwhelms. refreshing enough, super light in malt profile and in hops too really, clean finishing. decent spring ipa all the way, i dont dislike it, but i expected so much more out of this."
"Overall a tasty and interesting IPA. I think the pine resin aspect wins in the end but just barely. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is kind of a disappointment when compared to other ""west coast"" IPA's. I wasn't expecting a competitor to Pliny from Sam Adams, but this beer has a flavor more like a session IPA than a west coast hop bomb."
""
""
"Pours a VERY clear, straw color with modest, bubbly head. Smell is mostly yeast, with a very subtle hint of citrus hops. The taste is very crisp and not overly bitter, but the hops just aren't there. I would imagine that many people who aren't into IPA's could drink this and enjoy it, especially on a hot day. It's not bad, but it has no business being called a ""west coast style ipa."" That implies a strong, hop forward smell and taste that this does not have. At all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So overall this is a very passable if not exactly memorable IPA from the Sam Adams guys. I prefer the Latitude 48 IPA myself, but the Rebel is perfectly serviceable. Hopefully they'll be able to bring in a few converts, because the beer is quite good; it just doesn't do enough to distinguish itself."
"HAIL TO THE REDSKINS!!!"
""
"overall i was actually impressed this Boston beer brew. i do feel it is overpriced by about a dollar, there are better IPA's for cheaper. commodore Perry to name just one. i wasn't disappointed with this brew however, i don't think i will be picking up anymore anytime soon. not at that price point, when better is available."
"O-not bad. I'm not a huge Sam Adams guy so I didn't have high expectations like some others have. It doesn't stand up to some of the better IPAs like Lagunitas, but It would be fine putting a few back while enjoying pizza and wings."

"Understand I'm a big Boston Beer (aka Sam Adams) fan--although there are a few of their brews I can do without--as well as an IPA drinker. So when I saw this item on sale I had to give a six-pack a try. I liked it well enough to go back for 2 twelve-packs.

"Totally not a West Coast IPA in my opinion. They should've just marketed it as a regular IPA with some other type of ""rebel"" catch/marketing ploy. With that being said, it does make for a fantastic session beer. I'm very excited to offer this to my beer drinking friends with terrible test ( e.g. Budweiser guys) to try and get them to branch out and broaden their horizons. Although Sam Adams failed in their style attempt for the most part, they did nail a solid IPA (almost American Pale Ale with kick). It'll be interesting to see if this brew is able to stick around. Hopefully it does because it is totally drinkable (hate that phrase) and at 6.5%, several will help put a smile on your face."
""
""
""
"O: Decent, but dumbed down, version of the style. IPA's are known for aggression, and this one falls flat in that regard. I'm going to presume that Sam is once again trying to reach the widest possible audience with this beer instead of focusing on a stylistically accurate representation. This, combined with the ""Revolution"" marketing, comes off as obnoxious and ungenuine. The west coast revolution happened in the mid 90's, Sam. Catch up."

"Overall - This is a damn tasty beer, it really is, but it misses the mark both in marketing and style. This may have cut it as a West Coast 'Rebel' IPA 20 years ago, but half the W.C. APA's have bigger hop bite than this in today's market. Terrible marketing campaign; it's just a failure as a W.C. IPA. Look past the the intention, however, and you'll find a well balanced, delicious caramel-centered pale with complimentary notes of citrus. So, what to do? How to grade it? Middle of the road? B+ for the brew, and F for the failed marketing ploy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm trying to think about who this beer is marketed to. Maybe it will a stepping stone for some into more hop forward beers but for those who already like hops I think this will be a disappointment. Too much malt and not enough hops really but I did enjoy it's drinkability and it has a pretty decent aftertaste. I've had Sam Adams' Hallertau Imperial Pilsner, so I know the can do big hops if they want to in outstanding fashion, so I was expecting a bit more out of this one. If this beer is my only choice at a chain restaurant I would get it again. Or it's on sale for 7 bucks a 6er like Sam Adams sometimes it I would pick it up. But not when I can get 2 Hearted or Centennial for only a dollar more."
""
"so SA gets in on the craze and creates an approachable, yet pedestrian IPA. they did a better job on their hopped up pilsners. this offering is OK. priced nice, and quite average."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - good version of a West Coast IPA, but there are some I like more than this one. I would get it if I was in a pinch and had a craving for hops"
""
""
""
"A- I poured this beer from a bottle into a tulip glass. Nice head on the pour but poor retention. With slight lacing on the glass. This beer us crystal clear. S- all pine resin and grapefruit here, very typical of the style. T- just like the nose suggests, it's a mouthful of pine and grapefruit, but extremely balanced. The hop bitterness is gone almost as soon as it got there. A run of the mill IPA flavor. Not quite as in your face as a west coast IPA should be. M- the carbonation is just right, prickles the tongue then subsides quickly. O- overall this is a wonderful session IPA, would I put it above other IPA's? Probably not, but it is definitely going to be a new go to beer for me."
""
""
""
" The taste has a light peppery quality with more herbal notes from the hop up front followed by a light citrus tanginess and more sweetness from the malt as it warms. The tase seems more dry than sweet as it finishes with hardly any alcohol in the taste. This IPA is mild almost lager like in its smooth body , not bad reallly drinkable but not bold in any sense. Pretty tame for a west coast IPA considering hop taste and Aroma."
""
"aggressive for the regular crowd, but damn as a grab n' go IPA to have in the spring and share at a party... I will definitely scout this as an option and being able to pick it up at the local supermarket (well, not here in jersey...) is a bonus."

"A good effort for Sam Adams, but doesn't dethrone any of the big IPA kings on the West Coast."

"Pours a one-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose, flavor is grapefruit hops, some caramel, lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett NH. Best by 6/2014."

This very drinkable beer is Sam's best IPA yet, and the wife even put it in the fridge for me!!! Sam missed a few points on this one. For claiming to be a west coast style beer, I would expect a little more of that hoppy, citrus, IPA taste and smell. Well balanced and well priced, this one will likely be a staple in my fridge for now on."

"Overall a bit of a let down from the hype I heard, this is not very bitter, more malt forward than i expected, hops are not really what I thought they would be for a so called West Coast style IPA. Just not really doing it for me, maybe this varies bottle to bottle, but that's not a typical Sam Adams thing."
""
"O/D-It not as aggressive as the name and marketing want you to believe. I frankly this the whole 'Rebel' moniker is pretty lame. Aside from that, it's not a bad beer."

""
"For me, this is a beer that is greater than the sum of its parts. The sweet bitterness balance is perfect for an AIPA, IMO. There is enough hop aroma and flavor to identify the style; while there are plenty of hoppier beers, those come across to me as one dimensional. I get a slight stone fruit aroma. I'm not a hunter of the white whale, always looking for overt, in your face character to distinguish a beer from the rest. I'm looking for beers that I would love for the rest of my life even if it were the only beer I could drink in that style. This beer fits that description at least as well as any IPA I've had."

"A nice but not overly aggressive IPA. But it is Boston Beer's most recent and most serious venture into the IPA world. Not bad for a lager brewer, and its an ale that may again win over the non craft drinker. It doesn't replicate my favorite IPAs but may get some non craft drinkers to drink better beer."
"Overall: This brew is a little late to the party. For this being a ""West Coast"" style ale is a bit tamed. The flavors are only hints not aggressive. Still this is an OK beer not drain pour material. Yet isn't earthshattering good. I will not seek this one out again, unless I'm at the bowling alley and they have this on tap vs. Boston Lager. This brew is worth a try."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 6/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of citrus/tropical hop notes with moderate malt balance; and solid strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop and moderate malt flavors; with almost balanced malt/bitterness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good IPA. Good complexity of hop flavors with moderately balanced malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"D/O: This IPA seems to be assembled for mass appeal; a gateway to the style. It threatens to offend the senses and sensibilities of this student of hops by edging up to the Columbus ""do not cross"" line--but stops just short. There will likely be a showdown looming when it hits sports bar draft lines next to New Belgium's Ranger IPA."
"Will get this again. Great, especially for the price."
"Overall: a very tasty IPA that is not over bearing and is well balanced. Easy to drink and is very satisfying."

"I rather like Rebel IPA a lot, but it does little to stand out among the ranks of bolder and more complex beers of its style. But pairing well with great company, pizza, cheeseburgers and savory appetizers gives this ale a welcome home."
"West Coast IPA (or California Hop Bomb if you will) happens to be one of my most favorite style of beer in the world, so I was immediately intrigued when I saw this Samuel Adams beer in the shop today. They certainly nailed the look, as this was clear as they come, golden amber in color, and exhibited a steady stream of bubbles feeding a two finger thick head. The smell was a little disappointing, as I was expecting a pine and grapefruit explosion. Instead I got a subdued citrus and a hint of spruce. The taste was even less authentic than the smell, as there was none of the expected bracing hop bitterness. Instead it tasted like a bland extract of hops, with a sweetness like toffee, and a peppery finish. This was certainly nowhere like a West Coast style beer. The mouthfeel was decent, with a sticky coating on the tongue. This just came into the store today, and has a best by date of June 2014, so why does it taste so bland? If you really want a West Coast style IPA brewed on the East Coast, get a Jai Alai. That is some seriously hoppy stuff."

"Overall: Very tasty. But it tastes too spicy, like a lot of Samuel Adams brews."
""
""
""
""
"I really appreciate this entry into the style. It's balanced but it's not so deliberate about saying so like all day ipa. I would have had one or two more had I not been suffering from a stomachache. Great session IPA, and good for those of us who are addicted to hops but might want everyone to calm down once in awhile."
""
""
"The beer pours a darker golden body with a nice white head. The smell is of bitter hops and sweet malt. The taste is of bitter piney hops with a touch of malt sweetness. There is a tiny bit of a tingle on the back of the throat. Though this isn't the greatest IPA ever, it can't be beat for the price. I can find this at a local shop for $6.50 a six pack and I buy this as my cheap beer replacement."
""
""
"The body is medium. Carbonation keeps up nicely. Crispness and smoothness vie for position with both coming out about even."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the worst IPA's I've had in some time. The aroma hints at the off-putting taste you are in for. You know how some poorly-executed IPA's have a foul garbage aftertaste? This one. Its a drain pour, especially at the price point they are asking. As another reviewer noted...almost any other IPA near it would be a better choice."
""
""
""
""
"On-target for the style and an enjoyable brew that showcases American hops with a firm malt backing. Nice blend of hops and malts. A very nice American IPA!"

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a crisp feel to this beer that is unlike most IPAs. It has a hoppy flavor but does not carry the same bitterness that digs into the palette and does not wear away. This beer has a light feel and a very drinkable feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I hope you enjoy this beer as much as I have."
""
"Overall pretty average IPA but its drinkable and not bad. But with so many better ones out there don't really see repeat buying this one. But keep trying Sam one day you might actually make a IPA good enough to make it into my regular rotation."
""
"I'm not gonna sit here and tell you how it's not a REAL IPA or just not hoppy enough. I'd call it a pretty good session IPA. More hop flavored than bitter. A pretty nice bouquet that fades. Overall a good pale ale if not a great example of an IPA."
""
"O - Goes down fast. Not sure how this differs from their Latitude IPA (I'll venture to guess that different hops are used that make it more hop forward), but it worthy of a sampling."
""
"Pours a clear amber. Flavor is somewhat spicy from hops with an earthy overall tone. Kind of a caramel edge on it too. Just a touch of grass as well. Kind of a soil taste left in the back of my mouth. Nothing overly interesting going on here. I wouldn't mind more punch and less soil and earth tones."
""
"I recommend you bypass this beer, pick out almost any other IPA nearby and it has an excellent chance of being much better than this one."
""
"3.75/5"

""

"A decent IPA from Sam. Probably the best I have had. That said it needs a bit more hop flavor to be a west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad brew overall. More pale ale than IPA. Has that good pale bitterness but quickly diminishes to leave an empty taste overall. Nothing mind-blowing, only the hops stick out. Overall a great beer for summer drinking."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium, slightly dry. Overall, it's better than OK, but it's not special."
""
""
"O: This is the closest thing to a good IPA Sam Adams has made. Sadly, it isn't quite a good IPA - much less a good 'west coast' IPA - as the hops are too mild and the malts are too strong yet undefined. Come to think about it, it isn't much better than Latitude 48 was. I don't need to have it again, as there are far better ways to get my IPA fix."
""
""
""
"O: It's like two guys were responsible for the hop additions of this beer. The aromatic late/dry hop guy showed up and did his job well. The bittering/flavor hop guy yanked off and didn't bother to come to work that day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very sessionable, but wouldn't want to. Would be bored. I have a case from Costco now. <sigh>"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A well done American IPA with a nice blend of different hop flavors. It won't be replacing my default West Coast IPA anytime soon, but still a decent brew."
""
""
"The flavor echoes the aroma with a bit more zing. A good toasted bread quality with a lingering grapefruit and citrus finish. Sessionable and drinkable for sure. Nothing that blows other IPA's out of the water."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, goldenrod coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation through the body and a slim, clingy, white head. Aromas of resinous and pungent hops forward, with roasted and piney notes blending in as well. Very green nose. Flavors are roast forward, with a blast of pepper spice, pine tassel, pitch, and hints of tropical fruits in the backbone. Very light bodied, giving it a slightly sharp end feel on the tongue. The resinous and slightly buttered toast aftertaste is cleaned up fairly quickly thanks to the rapid transition in the end feel. There are some grassy and oregano notes in the aftertaste, too. Good, strong, robust flavors forward that get wiped out very quickly. It's like being shot out of a cannon."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. My first Samuel Adams other than regular old Boston Lager. Fitting for a large brand, this is a great intro IPA, but it fails to overly impress me. Love the hop blend, just wish theyd really amp it up. I would definitely drink these at parties or out skateboarding or something, when I want something ""cheap."""
""
""
"Fairly dry and good but not too much carbonation. Overall impression is that it's a tasty beer and I'm happy to have a few more left in the fridge./"
""
"*(the bottle was a slight improvement, but this is not something I will buy again)"
"Overall a worthwhile IPA and at this price, it could be a regular staple in someone's rotation."
""
""
""
"Not as bitter as other IPA's and they do make it a point to say that but it still has the dry bitter that we all love in IPA's just not overbearingly so. This is a more citrus hop flavored IPA over their Latitude 48. It also has more of a juicy quality to it which I prefer. Obviously the Latitude 48 is hoppier and more bitter but this one seems a bit more complex."
""
""
"Would return to this one but would like to see a price drop."
""
""
""
""
"Happy about this end result. West Coast stylings, for sure."
"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel and pale malt and oranges. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Citrusy hops, pale malt and caramel combine on the palate. Finish is long and grapefruity. Ok IPA."

"Samuel Adams Rebel IPA ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light orange color, almost golden with a pillowy white head and great lacing. Aroma is hoppy, primarily citrus, herb and pine with a small tropical fruit thing going on. In the taste, pine, herb and citrus with a little papaya/mango flavor on the back end but restrained. Refreshing, almost has a mint/menthol kick in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth, well carbonated feel. Manages to be smooth and crisp. Overall, this was a good beer worth having for sure."
""
""
""
"Wont be revisiting this one"
""
""
""
""
"This ale pours a deep amber color with a thick white lasting head. The nose is one note...all hops. The flavor is very fresh and refreshing with citrus and pine hoppy notes. Unfortunately this beer is one note. Its very enjoyable and sippable. But There's no depth or complexity. Worth trying but don't stock up on it."

"Final Thoughts: A good beer for hop heads from Samuel Adams. Would I drink it again? Yes, might actually consider buying a sixer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid offering from Sam Adams that is worth a try."
" Secondly. Just in terms of taking the beer on its own merit. It's light and easy drinking. Too light for me, but I can see where people who are just starting out with IPAs would love this. And as I said, it's totally sessionable as far as IPAs go. But I do feel it's a little watery on the finish and the malt is a little sweet. I am not sure what they should add, but I have a feeling something is missing in this brew. It's a fantastic attempt, especially from Sam Adams. But it's just kind of ordinary and basic when all is said and done. Jim Koch did a great job with living out his vision in an IPA, but I think I'm still going to keep Lagunitas as my basic go to IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall.... I will not be buying this one again. Severely lacking. ""Brewed for the revolution"" What does that mean? If youre gonna get an IPA by Sam, get the Latitude 48, its way better IMO. Better yet, get an IPA by a brewery who doesnt dislike hops. Put Scotch Ale back in 6 packs and Ill buy that one alll day long, but I really just dont dig anything theyve been putting out lately. I hate to sound like a hater, but stop making IPAs, malt is your thing, do that. Cheers"

"Apperance is a nice clear gold with thin white head. Nose is grassy with light herbaceous notes and dry bread character. Hops seem a bit restained but definitely present. Taste starts with light bitterness. Grapefruit and pine are present along with dry cracker. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Overall, good flavor here but nothing earth shattering in a style category which is chock full of stellar beers. Doesn't hold a candle to Lagunitas IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom line: Worthy of a 6'er to try, but the overall hop impression to me was muddled. I would have preferred a more forward hop presence that showcased a couple of hops, not the 4 they indicate on the bottle. If you find inconsistencies in your bottles, you're not alone."
""
"O - Given it's hop content, this beer should have been super citrus, dank, sticky, this falls extremely short of an IPA. This is more like a pale ale, this does not taste like a West Coast IPA. This is light, drinkable, but for $10 a 6 pack, I'll pass."
""
"Overall, I didn't hate my time with Rebel IPA, but I'm not the biggest fan of the more English influenced IPA's. I like my IPA's popping with flavor, I don't care as much about a balance of all the ingredients (which Rebel still doesn't accomplish that well). In the end, if your entire campaign and purpose of a beer is to compete specifically with the west coast style of IPA, MAKE SURE YOUR BEER TASTES LIKE A DAMN WEST COAST IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Rebel IPA strikes a good balance between the (perceived) East and West Coast IPA characteristics. A true West Coast IPA would have a stronger hop bite and would be slightly higher in ABV. Definitely worth a try otherwise."
""
"Great IPA and an even better price, hope they can this one! A little puzzled by the 82 overall score, perhaps due to the fact it says Sam Adams on it??? Very clean, refreshing, balanced but with a hop heavy balance for sure. I am glad to have this and Summit Saga available for high quality but with a great cost for go to IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
"Balanced? No, not really. But a good drink...borderline sessionable. Good job by BBC."
"O- sessionable, drinkable and pretty well balanced. But middle of the road, overall"
""
""
"Taste is bitter hop punch of pine, resin, earth, citrus up front. A slightly biscuity malt backbone is barely detected. A very solid great tasting IPA. It may be over shadowed by brews like Flower Power, Sculpin, and Sucks, but solid none-the-less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer, but to me it was certainly more like an English IPA rather than a West Coast IPA. This is like the training version of an IPA to graduate to a Stone IPA, and then the progression could be to a Firestone Walker Union Jack or a Ballast Point Sculpin or a Green Flash West Coast IPA. Good beer, but not worthy of West Coast IPA style. The Pliney's are West Coast IPA style."

" Overall i love this beer,its a good ipa to have when you dont want to break the bank or your taste buds.drinks easy but has enough bite and substance to keep you honest.I think sam adams hit the west coast ipa theme pretty close and just missed on the taste and appearance.a good beer and worth a try,i will be putting this one in my go to status."

"Poured on tap into a ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice clear orange with a small head. Smells of citrus and piney hops and nice fruity bouquet. Tastes of piney and floral hops nice balance with the mellow grain. Beer is light bodied good finish, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty impressed with this. I am certainly not a Sam Adams hater, but this IPA exceeded my expectations. Really stellar job here, and fully lives up to the ""West Coast Style"" promised on label."
"Poured into my Brasserie D' Achoufff tulip, best by 6/2014. Pours a nice orange, with a half inch white head that leaves some lace behind. Smell is tangerine, pine, mango, grapefruit, and some marijuana. Taste is all of that not crazy pungent, but nice assertive hops and balance well. Body is less than medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is solid, would be very happy to see this on tap some place for a change. I paid under $10 for a 12 at Walmart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid citrus forward hop presence all around."
"Overall: Super malt-forward IPA.. If it can be called an IPA given its utter lack of hop character… MAYBE a British IPA, but certainly NOT the West Coast IPA the label claims"
""
"Thanks Dave, I appreciate it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - They missed what they were going for: the west coast IPA. There isn't much, if any tropical fruit and big citrus going on here, and I feel like the malt bill is overshadowing the simple, piney/grassy hop profile. That being said, this is not a bad beer but an uncomplicated, average brew that I wouldn't turn down if offered, but wouldn't buy a sixer with so many similar priced, superior choices available."

""

"O: I know that the Samuel Adams line does not get the highest reviews on this site, but I am currently under the impression that people here seem to be trying to find a reason to dislike this ale. No, it is not a one-dimensional hop bomb (I know those are en vogue right now), but it is an incredibly balanced, flavorful, complex, and authentic representation of one of the United States' premier styles. I recommended this highly regardless of what the hipsters think!"

"4.25/3.5/3.5/3.75/3.5"
"O: Good for what it is but not much more than that. A good price point but there are so many other better IPAs out there."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Lots of effervescence initially, thick persistent head, and fair amounts of persistent lacing. Nose is lightly grainy with plenty of citrus. Very little in the grain department, but plenty of bitter citrus pith. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
"Everyone seems to be finding a reason to not like this, I was absolutely on that train but shit, it's kind-o' good. I think the term ""West-Coast IPA"" is misused on the label. When I think West-Coast I think Green Flash or Lagunitas, this isn't that. It's too smooth and lacking in bitterness for that. It's a Maine or Vermont knock-off and it's pretty good for being that."
""
""
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this. This is one of the best IPAs I've had in a long time."
"Overall- I ordered on a whim with my dinner. I normally don't go for IPAs but I thought I would give this one a try. A good beer but I probably wouldn't order it again but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."

"Update: Originally I suggested this could be a session beer, even though I consider myself a seasoned beer drinker, after drinking my third Rebel, have decided it might be a mistake to take this 6.5 lightly...a wonderful IPA...drink responsibly."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of an IPA, it had enough West Coast IPA aspects for me to know that's what they were going for without even reading the label, it's not the best West Coast style IPA I have had, but for a widely distributed IPA from Samuel Adams I think it's pretty solid. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I'm sure I could drink a couple of these but any more than that and it might start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the how solid it was, it didn't really seem to have a weak point. What I liked the least about this beer was that the citrus hops didn't stick out just a little more, It's not that big of a deal but I think that would make this beer just a little better. I might buy this beer again, I don't know if I'll get a six pack anytime soon, but I wouldn't rule out ordering a pint at the bar. I would recommend this as a nice easy drinking IPA, but hardcore West Coast IPA fans might be disappointed. All in I thought this was a pretty solid beer, it didn't blow my mind by any means, but I still enjoyed it for what it is and I'm glad Samuel Adams decided to brew this beer. Nice work guys, thanks for another solid IPA."

"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost $8.99 poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. I had to grab this to see what the fuss was about. I also knew beforehand that this wasn't going to be a true West Coast. I don't know why brewers insist on using this term for their IPA's when they taste nothing like a true West coast. It's really gimmicky and they need to just fucking stop already. Bright orange color, good head. Aroma clearly told me this was no West Coast and to be honest it was quite boring. Maybe there were hops there but they were so subtle. Now the flavor was nice and hoppy but it wasn't piney or dank, mostly citrus and grapefruit but it was good. This was super easy to drink and I was glad I bought a sixer but this will never approach Alpine or Green Flash or Pizza Port or Ballast Point or Stone or Russian River or Lagunitas. Never."
"OVERALL: a good traditional IPA but nothing out of the ordinary."
""
""
"O- Not exactly what I expected from this ""west coast style"" IPA. The A list cast of hops included in this brew got me excited but unfortunately I was duped. I like this addition to Samuel Adams ever growing list of IPA's, but there are much better choices out there for this style. Good not great."
""
""
""
""
"I'm personally not too crazy about this one. It doesn't really have that west-coast vibe that I was expecting. It's fine, but it's nothing that going to get people excited."

"Pours into a nonic a clear medium golden with a sticky one finger white that settles very slowly leaving two broken rings of lace behind as it settles .Mild leafy and citric hops along with some sugary sweetness,both are light.A decent shot of citric hops upfront on the palate along with a caramel biscuit base underneath,the hops are much more fruity than bitter wich surprised me a little.Not bad,it's not something to go spend alot of money on but would be good as a ""starter"" IPA for somebody."

"Overall – Other than the mouthfeel, this beer was rather nice as it tastes and smells of very fresh hops. This is one I could see hop heads liking, even with it not being a double (or triple) IPA."

""
""
"This is a very fine example of the style, but nothing superb."
""
""
"O-it's a decent beer but nothing to write home about"
"Rocky head from the off white head forming thick, large bodied copper hue going on. Aroma has citric notes, big fruity hop notes, lemon, lime, and alpha acids come through each sniff. Flavor includes big fruitiness, caramelized malts, bitterness rolling through with hints of tropical fruits, dank resinous hops make their presence known but the actual beer doesn't do the style justice. Mouthfeel has a resinous hop oil slickness even carbonation not much going on other than the breadiness that finishes with most Sam Adams beers. Overall I can't wait to try more Sam Adams IPAs this happens to be their first shot at a West Coast style IPA it's getting closer."

"On-tap at Buffalo Wild Wings. This pours a golden amber color with foamy white head. There is a mild scent of bitter hops and some citrus. The taste is a simple IPA with a smooth texture and decent bite. A tad too thin to be a great IPA but still rather drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty solid effort. I wouldn't hesitate to order it again if I were dealing with limited selection."
"Comes to the table a deep golden color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of caramel and toffee with floral and citrus hops to balance. The flavor follows the aroma and kind of reminds me of a Boston Lager with a couple of more hops pellets added. Toasty brown sugary maltiness with bits of earth and citrus. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent beer, but as IPA's go these days this one is a bit pedestrian."

"Just doesn't taste right. Everything else is ok."
"Poured in a 16 oz glass. Lightly golden...slight head, quickly fell. Stacked lacing..lingers no glass appeal. Taste is fresh, good carbonation. Citrus lingers quite refreshingly. Not much hint this is an IPA. Good to the throat going down, could be a good Summer refresher. If more complex would certainly recommend. Cheers"

"Not bad. A far more drinkable IPA than the extreme versions you find elsewhere. But it leaves you wanting a bit more punch to it. I will say this was excellent with food."

""
"this is pretty much the worst IPA i've ever had. tons of off flavors, and overall completely bland and characterless. Overly malty, with flavors of squash, peanut butter, balsamic reduction, and sponge. Little to no head retention, and no lacing. I would not waste any more money or time on this Samuel Adams product."

"Overall: A slightly above average but solid IPA. A nice and piney taste. This is one that I would not rush out to get, but not one I would turn down if offered to me either."
"Tap handle in festive Christmas colors in the shape of a spray can! Like the can you would buy to spray flock a Christmas tree."

"Mild pale malt start. This is punched out by a spicy black pepper hop kick. Stronger in the swallow but without much complexity. Long aftertaste. The body and carbonation is as one expects from the style."

"Stumbled across this at Buffalo Wild Wings. On tap. Pours a clear light amber color with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing.The aroma is piney with grapefruit and some dankness. The taste is much like the aroma. Grapefruit upfront followed by some piney hops. Toasted malts as well as some bread. Orange peel and pine at the finish. Light mouthfeel, but I think that's the point. An easy drinker with a good amount of flavor and hop bitterness. It's on the lighter side of an IPA, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. Overall, worth having again."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not to filling, decent kick, excellent West Coast representation of style, this is definitely one of my favorite Sam Adams beers."

"Overall a tasty IPA. Likely the most hop forward beer SA has ever produced."

"*Aerosol spray can tap handle is a nice touch as well."
"On tap at Asgard in Cambridge. Hops are definitely weak for a ""west coast"" IPA. Not a bad beer, but not a west coast IPA. Maybe an APA at best. Mouthfeel is very light. Not a lot of hop aroma. More spicy than floral. No noticable citrus at all. A good balance of sweet and bitter. Not bad overall, but not great either."

"YEAH BABY!!!! Finally a true West Coaster IPA from Sammy A!!! The beer poured a nice clear golden color with 1/4 finger thick white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent is fresh hops that include pine and citrus notes. The taste is a nicely balanced beer between hops and malt...pine probably is more prevalent than citrus....there is a Sammy twang to it thou. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a nice addition to the Sammy A repertoire."

"Overall: very drinkable with nothing off putting but it seems overly simple and plain. Not a bad beer by any means I just wanted more from a hyped beer such as this. The hops are weak for a west coast ipa for sure."
