"O: This is an excellent IPA. Sculpin is the darling at the Ballast Point ball, but Big Eye is the underrated hot girl that doesn't get enough press. This beer would be the flagship at 90% of the breweries out there. Well done Ballast Point!"
"As others have said, it's earthier than the Sculpin. It's also slightly drier with a heavier emphasis on the piney hops rather than the citrusy ones. Malts are present but I'd say the hood balance out nicely. Great springtime brew for when you aren't ready for the citrusy, fresh IPA's but still want some of those same crisp qualities. Overall: very nice."

"Inhabits the rung on the IPA ladder just beneath the Sculpin. Real nice balance of hops and malt with a clean pale-ale finish. Perfect companion to fresh poke."
"A very nice IPA.  I am more of a fan of east coast ipa's so take this rating with a grain of salt."

"An excellent brew! It seems like a near perfected IPA, in my humble opinion. I'm starting to see what some of the hype is about, and the reason Ballast Point is priced the way it is. I've noticed many people mention India Pale Ale was an acquired taste for them, but for me, It was love at first taste. Haha, But really, I enjoyed IPA from the start, my first IPA being the ""Hopsecutioner"" by Terrapin. If I had to sum this particular beer up with just one word, it would be, 'Amazing'!"

"Coppery apricot amber, offwhite head, wreaths of lacing. . Aroma of eucalyptus and guavas in syrup. Taste of menthol, pine resin and a touch of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is slightly spritzy. Overall a fine West Coast IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another good beer from ballast point.. Hoppy drink, bitterness is up there, leaves a nice lace, definitely drink it again."
"O:  Solid beer.  Prefer Sculpin, but would have again."
""

""
""
"Overall - A stellar American IPA. Spot on on all fronts. Worth a go if you stumble across a bottle of this."
"Nice looking head, lacing and carbonation. Smell and taste complex, early and lingering bitterness that doesn't suit my taste buds. Great feel but overall not one of my favorite IPAs."
"Pours amber with a white lacy, lacy head.  Has a nice citrus smell.  Tastes are citrus with a nice orange finish.  Mouthfeel is clean with a nice hop aftertaste.  Nice IPA, not overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"A great earthy IPA...a lot different from Sculpin!"
"A very good IPA... Check it out"

"Nice amber color. Mild malt and hop nose. Hoppy, sweet and malty. Very well balanced. I prefer this to Sculpin."
""
""
"It's a little malty for my taste but overall it's a pretty good American style IPA. The color is amazing, it's almost blood red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good - just a clean, crisp , easy to drink California IPA. This could be your everyday beer."
""
"There is nothing standard about this beer, but it is what an American IPA should taste like. Feel, taste, smell. All around excellent beer and one of the best of this style. Just when I was starting to think that an IPA was just an IPA I stumbled into Ballast Point. They are a breath of fresh air when it comes to the style."
""
"This tastes just like the Mexican spicy dried fruit candies. If you haven't had one before, think spicy apricot. Not a very sessionable beer in my opinion, but I enjoy the unique taste very much. It has a resiny, spicy and fruity aftertaste, with the malt holding its own as well."
"I loved everything about this beer - was 2.5 months old but still was very fresh & hoppy with a great mouth feel - another excellent IPA from BP."

"The color and head,  Amazing.    Wasnt expecting much out of this beer seeing how it was 3 months old.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!"
"Just didn't care for this one."
"Smells like a sweaty clam. Tastes a lot less sweet. Pirates would dig this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This IPA has a combination of citrus and pine hop notes to go along with bready malts. The grapefruit and orange hit up front, with some sweater bread like malt in the middle and a nice pine finish."
""
""
"Very good ipa! Very balanced! A winner in my eyes!"
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle poured into std pint glass.  Thick head with medium retention and light lacing. Crystal clear light coppery Amber color.  For some reason, I can almost pick up a hint of the ocean in the aroma.  Flavor profile and mouthfeel are about as expected for a nice west coast IPA.  Oddly, since I am on the East coast, I usually get these in cans or bottles and I do prefer the Sculpin in comparative tastes.  I have once tasted them at the Ballast Point pub in Little Italy in SD, and the gap was much closer so freshness probably counts for a lot.  In any event, give it a try if you can find it."
""
"Overall: It was a really good IPA. I live on the East Coast and this is a beer brewed in CA, and it tastes very fresh. I am impressed by that. I would buy it again."
"Nice clean hop taste and aroma...an excellent example of the style"

"Pretty much a light IPA not too hoppy"
""
""
""
"For some reason never had this brew. Picked up a single at craft bottle shop by Oxford valley mall. Overall, very familiar taste though I can't place it. Good not great. Enjoyed it."
""
""
"Another good ale from Ballast Point, though rather strange and unique."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really find it amazing that this beer gets no love or recognition. It's always stuck playing second fiddle to Sculpin. Most breweries would kill to have an IPA like this. Superb stuff."
""
"Hazy deep gold appearance. Big hoppy aromas which dominate and not surprisingly this comes through in the taste strongly. As it warmed in the glass I got a little of the alcohol coming through. Nice enough IPA but feels a little unbalanced to me with the hops overdone and the alcohol mouthfeel. I'm probably not used to the more gutsy west coast IPAs but would have it again but wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"No bottle dating, so I am unsure of whether this is actually a fresh IPA or has been sitting on the shelf for some time. Aroma is not strong at all or very pleasant, The taste is primarily bitter with hardly any fruity notes."
""
""
"Nice IPA. Poured into a pint glass. Clear copper color with white head. A little lacing. Smells earthy and spicy. A little caramel and citrus and definite spice that sticks to your palate and lingers almost making you hungry. Very west coast hoppyness. Finishes with a flurry of flavor, hops, spices, lemon pith. A good one, a tad boozy though."
""
"A great brew. One of my favorite. Juicy, nice hop flavor. Fruity pebbles and citrus. Bitter finish."
"Just not that great. Sculpin in far superior."
""
""
"Good for session IPA but no sculpin"
""
"somewhat dark hoppy taste with a hint of citrus"

"A really great IPA with a long finish and big tropical notes. Had high hopes for these Ballast Point brews, started off on a really great foot."
""
""
""
""

"What an IPA should be.  Even balance of bitterness, malt sweetness and hop aroma. Absolutely perfect. Not too dry, not too sweet. A no brainer."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice but average IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Very good, but not as good as Sculpin."
"Food match: This piney/earthy brew would be just at home with a Pad Thai as it would with a Recette de Côte de boeuf sauce bordelaise et cèpes en persillade (Prime rib with porcini mushroom and parsley)."
"Another fantastic IPA from Ballast Point.  I favor the Sculpin but a solid malt toward IPA."

"BOD 241/14.  Pours a very slightly hazy medium amber with a light dark ruby cast.  As it warms, the chill haze disappears.  Above average head volume and retention, world class lacing.  Outstanding nose of sweet tropicals (pineapple, mango and tangerine) over caramel with a peppery note.  Light medium body with a nice smooth texture that approaches slick.  Well carbonated with a effervescent rush from the middle to the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, very well balanced and complex in terms of hop flavor. It begins with a burst of blended hop flavor that separates into the tropical components as it fades into a caramel sweetness.  Interestingly, a grapefruit rind flavor is also noted as it flows into the mild bitterness of the middle coupled with a pepper note.  The finish is a slow fade from residual caramel sweetness into a rind like mild lingering bitterness."
""
""

""

"This west coast IPA offers a lot for the hop head beer fiend. The bitterness and aroma are the epicenter of this tasty brute. The malt sweetness and stickiness nicely complement the hop character. An excellent and highly recommended IPA."

"Overall (4.0) - This is an excellent take on the IPA style, and I'm actually impressed that Ballast Point has managed to make two IPAs that differentiate from one another without sacrificing quality. Any other brewer would be happy to have a citrus-forward IPA like Sculipin or pine-forward IPA like Big Eye in their portfolio. I'll definitely have to try this one out of cans sometime."

"22 oz Bomber.Nice pour with a 1 finger head.Smell is Grapefruit.The taste is grapefruit and a slight lemon taste with a little bitterness but not to much.This is a solid IPA with a good 7.0ABV.Not quite as good as Sculpin but pretty good.Give it a try.Thanks to Mr Renteria for giving this one to me."

"Pours a deep amber color with a big, light brown foamy head that stays for a bit and results in some similarly foamy lacing. Pretty good retention. Lots of citrus in this one. Grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. A bit of pine resin. Some very light caramel and bready/grain malts as well. The first thing noticed with the taste is the bitterness, which pairs excellently with the grapefruit aroma an taste. Some lemon zest and sour orange give this one a very unique taste. The pine isn't as present now; it's still there but the flavors allow the citrus to dominate. Not as hop heavy as I expected. Overall the taste isn't overpowering but it is very well done. The only negative thing I have to say about this beer is that, in my opinion, it is a bit overcarbonated. It could've benefitted from a bit less. Sticks to the tongue a bit and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Overall a very good, easy drinking IPA suitable for any occasion. A good alternative if you're not in the mood to get knocked over by Sculpin!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –   This was a tasty brew.  Ballast Point knows there IPA’s well, at least from what I can gather from the Big eye and Sculpin.  While the Sculpin may beat this one out by a bit, this one is very nice none the less, and depending on my mood, may give Sculpin a run for its money."

"Lost my notes on this one so I'm winging it from memory. On tap in a pint glass at Cooper's Seafood House in Scranton, PA.  Nice clear almost Amber color with a good two-finger head. Took a long time to settle and laced nicely. Aroma was very nice, grapefruit up front, pine tropical fruit and bready malt in the background. The flavor of this beer was excellent, with that grapefruit dominant, also some mango, resin and slight biscuit flavors. The mouthfeel was great, the hops coating the palate nicely and the carbonation set it off nicely. Very nice beer, wish we could get BP beers all the time in CO."

"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass. Great balance of hops and smoothness. Very drinkable ipa. I'd order this one any time."

"Medium body and carbonation, crisp, dry, refreshing and smooth."
""
""
"Overall - This is a big, bad, bold IPA that punches your mouth with massive citrus hop flavor and pronounced bitterness. Drink this, and you will know damn sure you're having a modern west coast IPA. While the bitterness is pronounced, it never gets overwhelming - which may be this beers most impressive quality. A damn fine IPA, and sure to please any hop-head."

"O =  I lIked the first taste better than the third.  What started off as a nice hoppy IPA that I was digging turns into a too bitter beer for my tastes."
"Overall, really incredible flavors, and an amazing bang for your buck!  I wasn't expecting it to be this wonderful what with the lack of any hip new hops in the hop bill, but it really eceeded my expectations!"
""
""
""
""

"I've had Big Eye a few months old, and loved it as it mellowed a bit too.  Still very hoppy with a strong black pepper that came to the forefront.  Same is in Dorado."

"A very good IPA.  Having tried my first Ballast Point brew last week (Sculpin) decided to try the Big Eye as well.  Almost as good, but thought Sculpin was a little better (IMHO)  However,  Big Eye is a finely crafted beer and very good in its own right."

"What a wonderful beer. Its everything that I seek out in an IPA! Just like Sculpin, it is floral and juicy with wonderful hints of tropical fruit and citrus. Not as brightly scented and flavored as Sculpin in my opinion, but where it is not quite as potent with tropical elements, it has a wonderfully fresh flavor with crisp citrus notes to ripen it up. Truly a masterfully done beer!"

"Big Eye IPA pours a golden color with a nice white lacing head. There is a mellow hoppy aroma. There is a big yet easy to drink, floral flavors, with a mellow bitter aftertaste. Very easy to drink, great flavors, and good body. Overall its a very nice IPA, easier to drink, smoother flavors, and a mellow bitterness."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden/amber, pretty clear. Surprising how dark in color this is, but it makes it noticeable agaist the rest. Good one inch plus head that last a minute or two and leave nice lacing. Aroma is very noticeable: some fruit hints. Mouthfeel is very good, carbonation is spot on. No bitter hop bite or aftertaste. Taste is a good balance, the hops and grains are well balanced with the malt. Malt is present and gives a nice yin to the yang of the hops. This is a good one, the alc content is a little strong, but can't be tasted. They did well, and I would have this one again and recommend it."

"Taste / Palate: On the tongue hop bitterness is king. The flavor is darker and more bitter than the nose suggested. The malt lays down a nice sweet bready base but the hops quickly take over with orange pith and deep resinous bitterness which hangs on long into the finish. The palate feels right on and balanced with good lively carbonation."

"O-A nice IPA that is not quite as complex or powerful as those I like a little more. However, it's a nice drinker and I will buy it from time to time."
"12 oz single bottle from Roths Sunnyslope Market in S.Salem. $2.00 Clear burnished orange colour with a nice half inch thick creamy off white head. Nice spicy, fruity hop aromas.Slighly toffee like malts. Taste is better than the aroma, thick caramel/toffee malt flavours vie with nice spicy/piney hops..nice. Nice mouth feel also its quite heavy for style but its very inviting on the tongue and the long lasting hop after taste is welcome. Very nice IPA. This might sound crazy, but I am beginning to see a slight split in IPAs from S.Cali and those from N.Cali,Oregon and WA."

"Poured a gorgeous clear amber with a one finger fluffy white head that stuck around. Quite the nice looking IPA. Scents of grapefruit, citrus zest, especially orange, tropical fruit, with notes of pineapple and mango and heavy hits of orange juice. An excellent, fruity, citrusy, West Coast IPA aroma. Flavor begins like a classic West Coast IPA, with big notes of citrus pith, grapefruit peel and hints of pine resin. In the middle the flavor picks up further notes of bitter citrus pith and pine resin, with slight floral notes appearing. The finish has a nice flavor of orange pith, grapefruit peel and pith, floral hop character and pine resin. A slight hint of alcohol is discernible throughout the sip. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, grapefruit pith and peel and orange pith and peel. A good West Coast IPA flavor, with all the flavors expected from the style. Very nice, though maybe not as flavorful as Sculpin. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a resinous, semi-drying feel. Good, easily drinkable and quite true to style. Overall this is another excellent IPA from Ballast Point that is a bit lighter, yet still aromatic and flavorful, alternative to Sculpin. Highly recommended."

"The beer pours a beautiful copper color matched by few beers. The aroma is something I had difficulties with; it smells like a standard American IPA, if that makes sense. No overt fruit aromas. The taste is pretty solid. The hop flavor is not terribly complex, consisting mostly of pine bitterness, with a hint of grapefruit. Of course, the lack of complexity is far from a bad thing. It has a nice malt balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this is a solid brew. I still think Ballast Point's Sculpin is a better IPA, but at about 4 bucks less a 6-pack than Sculpin, I think I'd prefer to pick this brew up instead."
""
""
""
"I picked this up on a buying trip to Ohio. This Aipa pours a rather orange copper hue. Darker than I had expected. There is a small off white head that leaves nice film and substantial lacing. The aroma pleasantly hoppy with lots of pine, grapefruit, and grass aromas. Slight malt backbone balances the beer out well. The mouthfeel is sticky but almost a bit too light in my opinion. The flavor is quite hoppy and bitter for the style. Almost seemed more dipa. This is good though, if it was in my market it could easily become my go to ipa."

"This pours a caramel amber gold in color a cap of bright white foam. There’s a fresh citrusy aroma on this, akin to just picked lemon and orange. Sharply bitter, with a lemony orange flavor that comes across in layers and a drying finish. I liked it."
"This pours a bright amber gold with a tall and frothy head. The aroma is fundamentally grassy hops, with some citrus notes. Taste is a nice mix of sweet malt with bitterness that's not nearly as high as many IPAs these days, but there's a load of citrus hop flavor, making it quite tasty. Yeast gives a little bit of fruitiness. Soft bodied, and not too carbonated. A good quaffing IPA."
"The normal defining terms dont do this one justice. Great carbonation that matches the hop crispness really nicely. This ones pretty bitter and will satisfy any hop needs. What a great beer and brewery perfect score."
""
""
"This IPA pours a clear golden light brown with a good cream coloured head that recedes to a thin film that lasts. The smell is very fruity with grapefruit and berry prominent and hints of the malty underpinnings. The flavours are nicely complex with lots of mineral, vanilla, toast, & tart citrus rind. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Aftertaste is dry and tart. Very enjoyable!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and caramel malt. Body is medium and crisp. Citrusy, herbal hops, caramel and bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, dry, and grapefruity. I liked Sculpin much better."

"good ipa, poured into pint glass with orange golden color. aromas are very herbal and musky. taste has some grapefruit bitterness, and tropical fruits, mango etc. really clean drinking and solid. a good standard IPA, not quite sculpin, actaually very different"
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall this is good but not great.  It certainly tastes well made but I am not a fan of the sweetness in this IPA."

"O: Enjoyable and a nice example of the style though with a touch too much lingering bitterness for this one to be an easy drinker in my opinion. Definitely worth grabbing if you come across but perhaps not one that I would actively go out of my way to find."
""
""
"Overall: As others have mentioned, this reminds me of Torpedo, but even more on the bold, resiny pine, floral side. This may not be as highly respected as Sculpin, but it's a great AIPA in its own right, focusing on different aspects. I will be picking this up the next time I see it. Recommended"

"This an extremely hoppy brew. It's certainly for hop heads, but those who prefer some sweet bready malt and lots of pine. A very piney beer in general."
"Poured from can into pint glass. 1” head that gradually recedes to a foamy 1/4” layer with clouds of sticky lacing. Deep, clear orange/copper color. Smells of sharp piney resin, brown sugar and floral notes. Taste follows the nose, with bitter hops, sugary malt and a bit more floral presence. The hops stick around on the palate after each sip. Medium-to-full-bodied, creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a solid West Coast IPA with starring roles for Centennial and Columbus hops."
"The taste was powerfully hoppy and did not disappoint since I was looking for a beer that was heavy in the hops department. This was my first beer from Ballast Point. I doubt that it will be my last."
""
"Very good IPA, but I still preferred their Sculpin with a more tropical hoppy profile. Though I did like its bold hoppy punch and good complexity. Recommendable, especially for the hoppy nation."
""
"A go-to quality IPA, with the big bonus being that it isn't too hard to find in Australia."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an awesome West Coast IPA. I actually thought I was getting a Sculpin when I saw Ballast Point IPA on the beer menu and I will say this is definitely in the same league as Sculpin."
"O: Solid IPA, might prefer Sculpin a bit more though. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada Torpedo a bit."
""
""
"O: Balanced good IPA that is not as memorable as Sculpin from Ballast Point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I give this beer a 4.75...I would love to try a few more to get a better handle on it. This is a great example of an IPA."
"5 months to the BB date I thought this one would be a little fresher, I'm guessing its 7 months old at this point not the one I was hoping for. It's far from bad beer and I do like it but my one other offering from this brewery was a memorable hop bomb."

"Pours a copper color with a finger of head that took some time to completely dissipate and left some lace behind when it finally faded away. The nose has both hop notes and malt notes. The malt backbone is not as prominent in the flavor profile as the nose might suggest. The finish is semi-dry and pleasantly hoppy. This is a solid IPA, but it simply can’t come close to its cousin – Sculpin."
""
"Finish: The hop resin holds to my mouth and helps to keep the orange flavor to my tongue. I'm also getting a load of carbonation just sitting there also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O- Definitely expecting more out of this beer, maybe a poor or outdated batch? (couldn't find a bottling/canning date). Maybe will give it a chance of redemption in the future with a new batch but wouldn't buy this again."
"So I was on a Ballast Point quest this weekend. I had Bigeye first, then tried the over-hyped Sculpin. But lets touch on the Bigeye. I don't really care what my beer looks like, it's all about the taste. And this ale is VERY average, kind of bland, and forgettable. Much like Sculpin, the bitter aftertaste is extremely off-putting. In fact, the bitterness of this offering over-powers any other taste. If somebody offered me this beer, I'd drink it, but would never go out of my way to buy it again. I've been completely disapointed with Ballast Point - there's so much hype - but so little to take from the ales. Other than bitter and hard to drink. A craft brew should be exceptional - to be honest a larger brewery like Sierra Nevada has offerings that blow this away. (think Torpedo). Not to mention a top end crafter. Do't go out of your way to try this one."

"overall; an overall positive experience, but for me, along with stone IPA, it falls under the category of IPA's that dont distinguish themselves, i wouldnt buy it again in the foreseeable future."
"O: For an IPA, this is very good. Like I said: I am not a huge fan of IPAs. This was a refreshing beer and it was very well put together."

"Overall: I'm giving this one a 93.Its a very sharp bitter brew that has little nonsense of excess character. I does what hop lovers want it to do and it does it well. It fits the mid-sized range for beer drinkers very well, and clocks in at an affordable price and is usually not too hard to find. Its best lumped into the category I place ""go too"" beers. X2IPA, Maxamus, GI harvest ale, etc. All are good hoppy brews of different calibers that you can enjoy anything...and yea. You can enjoy this anytime. I highly recommend it. 4.25"

"Every time a try a new Ballast Point beer I am amazed at the craft the brewers must have there. This IPA pours to a mellow amber glow. The head small, thin, lacing tracing the glass like cirrus clouds viewed from a California shore. The aroma floral ,more on the citrus side. Mouth banged by a ballanced hop bomb, mellowed in a herbal oil spill. Great carbonation keep the flavors pumping. Orange and lemon, lime, grape fruit. The finish a huge chorus of MORE!!! Craft beer at its finest. A Big Eye that never winks. Cheers!"

"Ballast Point Big Eye IPA ---3.5/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: I realize this is probably a distance from what it was like fresh, but I was impressed by the strength of the hops and also the citrus and floral notes, which I enjoy. This is an IPA with character, and I can uderstand why some like Big Eye even better than Sculpin. I'll definitely be looking for a 2014 version soon."
""
""
""
"This is a very clean, very likeable IPA that reminds me of several other west coast versions of the style. It has a very juicy, very tasty hop flavor profile that will thrill hopheads and I find myself enjoying my second bottle even more than my first. Great to find Ballast Point beers in my local stores now and I can’t wait to try more."
"O: Solid offering from BP, especially good value too. Definitely preview Sculpin but this is definitely a good beer."

"Overall, I'm glad to have tried this good-reputation creation. I can't say I'm enthralled, but it's a solid representative of a region that does this style consistently well."
""
""
""
"Solid IPA and definitely showcases the west coast nuances."
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent IPA. I cannot imagine sitting down and trying all my top IPAs back to back. It might make it impossible to differentiate. However, this baby would stand out for its emphasis on bitterness and on different levels of hops. It's almost as if they decided to just go hop crazy and make an IPA and then dry-hop the heck out of it as well. Highly recommended for fans of the style. You will be hard-pressed to find an IPA so distinctive."
"Moving the hops towards later addition would better match the style, or perhaps a bit more malt sweetness of of a DIPA for the hops, but this bitter representation of a west coast IPA is quite satisfying, as long as you live at the far end of Vinnie's ""Lupluin shift"". Overall, given my own penchant for hoppy beer, I enjoyed this one; it provides an honorable analog to a peaty Islay scotch, which similarly delivers enjoyment to a few, dedicated aficionados."
""
""
"Minus the fecal note, a great example of the style. Good balance of flavoring and bittering hops, though the bittering is a little more than I prefer."
"O: not quite on the level of sculpin, but still a delicious IPA."

"This IPA pours out a beautiful burnt orange color with copper tones, its topped off with a thin white head that quickly forms a ring around the beer. Great lacing marks every sip you take. The aroma is mildly hoppy and citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon and orange zest come through. Light and crisp when it first hits your tongue, this IPA is slightly bitter at first and then warms up your mouth as the hops become more present. The hops are very well handled and are the main point through this beer, the alcohol is barely detected even in its aftertaste. This is a well-balanced IPA and goes down quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean, crisp, and smooth. Like my baby mama after a hot wax, Big Eye is just clean, crisp and smooth."
""
"Overall - Really an excellent ipa, nice complexity and extremely well balanced. Very drinkable, with a tendency to want to sip quickly to continue the wonderful citrus flavors. Sculpin is a great ipa, but this is a very close second - save yourself 5 bucks and pick up a sixer of Big Eye - no regrets, and a must try."
""
""
""
""
"O- I bought this because of my high regard for Sculpin. To me, it didn't come close to the same quality. It was pretty good, just not something I can picture myself drinking again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: first BP I've seen in GA, nice WCIPA from a solid brewery"
"This is a good IPA that I'd love to re-visit fresh on tap, and in all honesty, it seems that us folk up north get the better experience of this brewery's offerings straight out of the keg rather than the bottles (or cans, for that matter). Still, this is definitely one of my new favorites, and I'll gladly have another when the time comes. It seems to fall off quicker than others that are readily available, however, so time is quite the factor in rating its enjoyability."
""
"Overall: Another decent offering from Ballast Point. Great flavors in the beginning but I prefer the malts to either balance it out or intervene very subtle rather than overtaking the taste."
""
""
"Can bought in NY and roughly 40 days since canning. Poured a clear copper with a bit of offwhite/copper undertone soapy head. Smells of citrus with some grapefruit rind. Taste is solid with upfront orange/grapefruit and a lingering semi-bitterness. Good solid mouth feel. Tasty overall"
""
""
""
"O - Great IPA from BP, people rant and rave about Sculpin, which is still good, but this is an excellent IPA from them as well."
"O- This is a good beer. I liked it quite a bit, but would have liked just a bit more citrus in taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has bold flavor. The first punch is like being punched in the face. It almost tastes like cocaine (not that I would know what that tastes like, wink wink). I really enjoy the smell and texture of this beer. This brewery just started shipping to Georgia and I cant wait to try everything else they offer."
""
"Glad to finally see Ballast Point in Atlanta. To me this is a great example of what a san diego style IPA should be--super drinkable, hoppy, citrusy, some pine and malt and just the right amount of stickiness on the tongue. Great appearance and aroma as well. This is like A Stone IPA thats kinda bursting at the seams. Delicious and interesting enough to the palate to have more than one."
""
"O: Much more piney and perfumey than Sculpin, so it's certainly more west coast styled. Easy to sit down and drink a couple, but the abv and IBUs will definitely take their toll after a few. Definitely recommended if you're into west coast IPAs"
""
""
"Clear, golden amber colored body was filled with fine carbonation bubbles. The head formation was one finger thick and foamy. The aroma was full of pine straw and grapefruit peels, and was very inviting. The taste was full of grapefruit, with a massive dose bitterness. The finish was spicy and herbal, as the hops never let up. The body was a hair on the lighter side of medium dense, and the aftertaste was a little boozy. Ballast Point beer just started showing up locally, and this was fine first taste."
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Tightly formed, thick, foamy head; and Persistent beer ring lacing. Nose is resiny with citrus and honey. Thick and syrupy pine resin, accentuated with citrus and a bit of sweetness, and earthy character. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Wow! Was not expecting this. Thinking this is the Jan to Sculpin's Marsha. Not the case. So good and balanced. Two sides - the malty sweet fruity to the enormous hop explosion. Super IPA!"

"O: It doesn't taste much like your typical IPA. Less hop forward and more malt oriented. I am sure this one is fresh, so that's not the issue. Not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - I didn't really know what to expect with this beer. The aroma is misleading in regards to the taste. I prefer tropical fruity IPAs like Sculpin and Dorado, though this was still good. I just wish the taste followed the nose."
""
"It's OK but it didn't blow me away."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid IPA from Ballast Point. Starts balanced but then gets drier as it warms up. Pretty good malt base flavor too."
""
""
"Body is medium and finishes bitter. It's a fine IPA, as is the sculpin."
"Overall: Another great American IPA from Ballast Point. Very similar to Sculpin with its citrus forward West Coast taste. Maybe a little more laid back and more malty? Will need to do a side by side. Both are great."
"Pours clear copper with one finger head. Aroma is a nice grapefruit pine. Very nice. More malt flavor than expected. A sweet soapy flavor taste along with some dried apricots, something a bit muddled going on here in the taste. Dry finish with medium light yet slick mouthfeel. Clean apricot finish. Somewhat unique flavor profile. Not bad but not really what I was expecting after loving Sculpin."
"A thick and oily AIPA with some disturbing garlic flavours."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Not my first choice when it comes to hop profile, but a decent one at that. Would I drink it again? Sure."

"O: Very solid IPA that has the hops bite and dry feel. It also seemed to improve a little as it warmed from a cold fridge state. Although it has about everything I like, I think it could be a bit more complex. And even then it's not to say it's monotonous, just the layers aren't as distinct as in some other offerings I have had."
""
"Light amber in color, clear, bubbly with little head. Strong hop presence, grassy, earthy, piney. Great hop flavor. Medium bodied, slightly dry, refreshing. Overall a solid ipa, very flavorful and drinkable. A solid ipa that is what you'd expect from the style."
""

"Pours dark amber, slightly hazy with 3 finger width foamy head.  Head retention is good.  Lacing is excellent.  Deep citrus aroma with slight piney hoppiness.  Nice malty taste, quickly followed by a piney hop burst, ending in a smooth citrus taste with a nice bitter aftertaste.  Slightly soapy.  This is a great IPA!!"

"Overall- Good beer. Solid IPA. Definitely worth giving a try. I'm a little burnt out on your basic West Coast IPA so it's hard to be enthusiastic about this beer. I almost wish there was more caramel or some sort of malt bill- what heresy!"

"O- great IPA with loads of hops i like sculpin better but this is also very good"
""
""
"This is a very nice example of a West Coast IPA and its not shy about high octane bitterness. Bonus points on 'Overall' since I'm really enjoying this beer."
""
""
"Taste has plenty of both bittering and flavoring hops. The finish is biting and loooong lasting. The malt is well played...not so light it is all hops; there is a deft touch of toasty caramel that stays out of the way or the most part but compliments the hops. Its still firmly in the West Coast IPA category, but a bit of malt compensation is nice to see. Mouthfeel is airy and carbonation perfect. This is a great IPA when fresh, I could drink this just about anytime."
"O - An above average IPA, that is very easy to drink. Probably much better fresher (need to start checking the dates at the store). Bought a 6pk and I'm not regretting it."
"Overall: Very solid West Coast IPA with some light English IPA flourishes. Bitter yet quite approachable. The chalky mouthfeel prevents this from being as strong of a West Coast IPA as some offerings by Sierra Nevada, Green Flash and Stone. Also, Ballast Point's own Sculpin IPA, while a very different beer that isn't really a typical West Coast IPA, is also a better choice."

"If you are a fan of West Coast IPAs, this is as good as many. I am probably limited to one or two before my palate is crying for mercy."
""
""
""
""
"a really good ipa, but after sculpin, ballast point cant really top it. this is by all means a great beer, and uniquely hopped with shades of pine and a great punchy bitterness, but it pales in comparison to sculpin, which is one of the finest crafted anywhere. red malts balance this out a little better, and its got a beautiful red glow to it beneath a white foamy head with excellent retention. pine is the hops family, but not as aggressive as some, this is more of a session beer to me, although it does pack a bit of an alcohol punch after a few. I had this at blue tuck in Syracuse amongst several other great india pales, and it stood up well to all of them. carbonation is excellent and this is a well made brew overall, but its nothing compared to a sculpin."
"Overall: this is a nice, dry, earthy IPA. There is definitely a bit of West Coast citrus bomb in its DNA, but it has evolved into a drinkable and balanced (for an IPA) brew."

"This will likely find a place in my rotation."

"Growler fills of Calico Amber and Big Eye IPA from Ballast Point Brewery in San Diego. Big Eye features an amazing nose of herbal, piney, slightly earthy hops; slight currant and blackberry at the end. Light copper color with a fluffy white head that dissapates into an intricate web of lacing around the glass. Nice carbonic bite with a medium body. Flavor is ALL herbal/piney/earthy hop taste. No sweetness, very little citrus to be found. Malt body is very much in the background; lightly biscuity and bready. Hard to take any real notes in flavor other than the pungent hop overload. This is definitely for hop heads. Sculpin IPA seems to be a little less dank in terms of pungency, I prefer it to Big Eye."

"O: A really decent IPA, a good drinker and a good value to boot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): I'm not sure which IPA by Ballast Point I prefer–Big Eye or Sculpin. Ballast Point has created in Big Eye a slightly less balanced India Pale Ale, and I mean that in a good way. This is a dry, grapefruity, piney beast that keeps the alcohol level low enough to make this a good beer to drink multiples of. This is one hell of an IPA, and you'll love it with some blue cheese, steak, or fajitas."
""
"Pours a deep orange amber with a medium off white lasting head, some lacing. Aroma and Taste is of sweet caramel malt, yeast, floral citrus hops, some orange peel and fruity esters and flavor come thru. Palate is a medium body, mild carbonation with a nice combination of sweet malt and floral hops balance. Finishes with a good caramel malt background, fruity, yeasty, some orange peel and good floral hops balance. A very good, flavorful and enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
"Poured into McDonald's collector's glass (I'm...away from my glassware at the moment). Clear golden orange with a huge fluffy white head that stays around and leaves nice lacing. Smell is fruity tropical hops, getting pineapple and citrus, with some herbal notes as well, and some crackery malt. Taste is crackery/buttery malt, bitter and slightly fruity hops. An unassuming but solid IPA, well-balanced and flavorful. This one shows that not everything needs to be a super-complex hop bomb to be delicious."
""
""
"The body was a bit fuller than average, and had a bit of light stickiness. The citrus lingered a few moments at the end. Drinkability was good for a 7% IPA, not a quick, smooth drinker, but one that's a nice companion during a couple innings of a ball game. Overall, a pretty nice brew. One that's not particularly different or outstanding from so many others, but a beer that's certainly worth your time."
""
""
"O - Very nice ipa. I was really excited when I saw my corner liquor store stocking some Ballast Point. Definitely will be a regular in my fridge."
""
""
""

"Warmer - It gets better and better - Let this one warm. Almost a GRAND MARNIER or Cointreau feel to it. After dinner IPA."

"Overall I think this would be a good ipa for people who aren't into an over balance of hops and are looking for something more rounded and balanced. I prefer sculpin greatly over this, but that's not to say this isn't good also"

"O - Great beer. Love this, more malty than the Sculpin, but great difference."
"I feel like I'm in the aquatic section of a pet store when perusing the labels of these Ballast Point beers. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset brass topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, pine needle, and very light menthol. The taste brings in more of the same, without the menthol character and with a hint of lightly-spicy greens. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice enough IPA, nothing to exclaim about, but nothing offensive, either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another home run by Ballast Point, this one is a bit maltier than the Sculpin. Just enough uniqueness to differentiate. I do prefer the Sculpin but I would not hesitate to purchase this in a pinch."

"O- The hops had a nice aroma but a bit mellow especially for the big caramel malt flavor. I drank this beer on 1/3/13 but it is the freshest Ballast Point I have found even though it was at the end of its date."

""

"This beer is totally different from Wipe Out IPA. Although this beer is also 7%, there are NO alcohol flavors. it's also not as spicy as Wipe Out - doesn't have that Amarillo hop spice in it. It's more typical ""West Coast"" but it's very good - very solid. I like it and will drink it again...and again."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the massive aroma. This was inclusive of the hearty grain bill, phenols, and booze, but left plenty of room for the hops to come in and balance in full force. This gave a high level of complexity, but with refreshing crispness and cleanliness in the end. The flavoring followed nicely, giving an equally as complex flavoring that fought between juiciness and dryness as it rode down the gullet. Sometimes the bitterness muddles the cleanliness of flavoring, as it sticks true to the west coast style, but the ultimate blend makes for a tasty, reliable, reproducible experience of intrigue."

"O - Very good IPA, better than average, but one can't help but compare it to Sculpin which is one of the best IPA's going, so it takes a hit on that account--but it's a pretty good IPA on its on merits."
""
""
"Nice IPA, holding up OK, but can tell the aroma has fallen off some and the caramel has moved forward in the flavor. Got this via mail order which can be a crapshoot as far as freshness goes, but at least I’m happy that it was within the Best By range."
"O: This is a very solid offering for the more restrained hophead, I prefer this brew to their Sculpin."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours orange/amber with a small head and mild retention. It smells like malts, sweet fruit, and piney hops. It tastes like sweet grapefruit and finishes with a slight hop taste that is pleasing. Decent body and good carbonation. A good beer but I prefer the sculpin. I would drink again."
""
""
"Pours lightly yellow with a small amount of head. A classic west coast IPA. Great hop forward taste that finishes with more hops without being too powerful. Mostly bitter/piny hop character with almost no fruitiness. Very clean and crisp, doesn't leave a super bitter hop flavor on your tongue like some powerfully hoppy IPAs. A stand by."
"O- classic west coast ipa, huge citrus hops, great malt backbone, amazing balance. Sculpin may get most of the allcolaydes, but Big Eye in IMO is a bit more balanced, and just as tasty"
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer by Ballast Point. Pours a hazey golden amber with a decent one finger head. The nose is lots of grapefruit/citrus and hops. Lots of hop flavor and good bitterness. Very flavorful and drinkable. I can easily drink alot of these. Ballast Point is easily becoming a favorite brewery of mine. Would give any of their beers a try."

"O- This was my 1st time experiencing Ballast Point and i'm satisfied. Truly a solid representation of a West Coast IPA."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy beige head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and grapefruit juice. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall: if you want a big American IPA, this is a good one to choose. Reasonably priced and with a good combination of different hops, it's a good choice."
"O: This is a decent malt forward ipa, I hate malt forward IPAs that being said I did not hate this beer but it definitely was not my favorite. If malty ipas are your thing then give it a try but if you have some dick throw in two big eye's in your scalapen six pack without you noticing before you got home you have the right to be pissed off."

"12 ounce bottle, label says enjoy before 2/12/13 so I know it has some age on it. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit), along with some bready malt. It tastes mostly like citrusy and pine hops, and a bit of bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little coating with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good IPA, it's definitely worth trying!"

"The appealing coopery color poured with a thin creamy head at first with nice lacing. The head diminished. The aroma hit me with a sweet estery (more sweet than spicey) aroma, slightly bready. Overall appealing nose. The taste was piney..earthy bitter on the back of the tongue that seemed to sustain itself between swigs. Light-medium body with light and crisp carbonation."
""
""
""
"o: Aside from the excessive diacetyl in this sample, the beer is very tasty and within style for an American IPA. This sample was poured from hotel tap system in San Diego, and I have no idea how their lines or kegs are treated. Usually, diacetyl is a fermentation byproduct (not enough yeast pitched, or the beer removed from the yeast too soon). In any case, I will give this another shot and would recommend trying this if you're into big citrus hops and a not-so-dry finish."

"Update 2014- After several more kegs of this IPA I am still in love. IMO the best IPA in San Diego."

"This was one of the first IPA's to break me through into loving IPA's and every time I revisit it, I still love it. I remember there being more aroma in the past, so I might have faulted it too much in that dept, but I have to review the one I'm reviewing right now. Will have to try again, maybe on tap if possible, to see if the fresher version has more aroma. For a maltier, more ""balanced"" version of an IPA, this one definitely stands out to me."

""
"Overall, quite a good IPA."
""
"Not an in your face IPA but rather a simple and damn tasty one. Medium mouthfeel with smooth carbonation. Goes down real easy and is super refreshing. Some sweet malt gives life to the dried fruit flavors of the hops. Ends semi-flowery with a nice underlying yet balancing bitterness. Really really good. This IPA takes the classic west coast flavors of an American IPA while presenting them in a subtle and super drinkable english-style. Unique, amazingly balance, super flavorful, and dangerously chuggable. That's what makes a damn good beer."
""
""
"This is a great IPA, very well balanced. By San Diego standards it's restrained, but still very quaffable and delicious."

"0 - Definitely on my list for getting more of these. Also makes me want to check out the Sculpin. I liked the balance of the citrus fruit taste. Not too fruity. A very solid west coast IPA. Pretty much everything I love about IPAs in a glass! Probably a great beer for someone who is making their way into the IPA world and is not yet a fan of the extreme hoppiness that some IPAs have."
"O - Very great IPA! More hops please! I am always impressed with Ballast Point. I prefer Sculpin over Big Eye but really enjoyed each."
"O: Centrist in style but at the same time, unique due to the particular mix of malts and hops. I appreciate the quality here but prefer IPAs that are at least a little more fruity."
""
"O - This is a big strong IPA. Definately west coast style. I'm guessing a lot of high alpha acid hops and likely some simcoe. I really enjoy this."

"A complex, orange-based IPA that's very well-done, as is their Sculpin."

"D/O For me drinkability is reduced by its size. Overall this is a tasty beer though. 3.5"
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating(got it recently from Ohio though, so we should be ok). Pours a lightly cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, herbal, floral, pine, grass, orange, mango, pineapple, honey, caramel, citrus rind, and bread. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; slightly more herbal and piney than I am used to as well. Taste of big grapefruit, herbal, pine, floral, grass, mango, citrus rind, pineapple, caramel, honey, and bread. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, herbal, pine, tropical, honey, caramel, and bread on the finish for a good bit. Very nice malt/bitterness balance in this; with a nice balance and complexity of hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming at all noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPA. A bit more malty than your typical West coast IPA, but I am not complaining. Great hop flavor balance, and very smooth to drink. Great stuff."

"originally reviewed: 03-29-2011"
""
""
""
"O/D - A pretty decent IPA that fell short with the roughness of the bitterness and cutting hop profile. I can see the potential for this one but the example I had wasn't exemplary."
""
"Overall impression: A nice interpretation of a Midwest IPA. Ha! There, I said it. Reminds me of something that Bell's would make. Probably because of the Centennial flavor/aroma additions and the slight caramel notes. Regardless of ""chicken-egg"" mentality it's a darn good beer and I'm glad it's now available in Central OH."
"Pours a very nice copper hazy color, and leaves great looking spotty lacing. Smells of citrus and grapefruit, can get some maltiness as well. Taste like the nose, very hoppy, grapefruit and citrus and some spicy hop notes. Love the Columbus and Centennial hops together. Mouthfeel is smooth, a little oily from the hop resin. Overall a great IPA. Glad I brought this one home from my Southern California trip, as I cannot get this one in Louisiana."
"Overall, I suspect past it's best. Not a bad thing but more malt would help lift. 0.5 added overall due ot low price point."
"HOLY CRAP! This has to be one of my favorite IPAs, has down. This is just awesome. This juicy quality mixed with the light mouthfeel and drying finish makes this a homerun of an IPA. I'd drink the Big Eye IPA anytime of the year!"
""
"This is a very pleasant brew. Warm and inviting flavors in a body that isn't heavy."

"O-- It's old. Say that up front. Perfectly serviceable though. Shows flashes of what it was and that is more than enough. hides the alcohol well and something that would work in a big way in this climate. if Australia got fresh Big Eye watch out. Shows its age in the feel so the downgrade. Otherwise a world class IPA"

"Picked this up at Whole Foods in Santa Rosa. 22oz bomber pours a clear, dark copper/amber colour. Tastes nicely bitter with some pine and a strong malt backbone in the finish. Drinks down very smooth and would be very sessionable with the 6.8% alcohol. Not sure of the freshness of the bottle, but its not a bad ipa overall."

"Ballast Point call this their flagship IPA, and I can see why. Tasty, full-flavored, and with enough hops for the most intense hop-heas out there, this is an AIPA to seek out and try. The flavor is intense enough, though, that served as from a 22 oz bottle, you will really want to find someone to share this with."
"Great IPA in the shadow of neighbor Stone. Of course you have to have an IPA. Why wouldn't you. It ois a standard that is set for brewing prowess. T does not disapoint. I Believe every brewer needs to brew a good IPA before they die. Think they can say done that and move on. Excellent mouthfeel and baiance. At first it seems pedestrian but the alance strts to take over the impression in a positive way and finishes wanting more. Cheersb"

"A solid IPA with plenty of flavour. Stands up well against most others."
""
""
""
"A moderate carbonation in a medium body allows for good smoothness after a crisp bite in the front after it settles down a little from biting to somewhat more mellow, letting the feel come together and work."
"This was an excellent IPA, one of the better that I've had. Nice full flavor and refreshing."
"O: An awesome contrast to Sculpin. A fruity, unique IPA that won't disappoint. Well done Ballast Point."
"Overall: Although it lacks the 'wow factor' of it's IPA counterpart in Ballast Point's year round portfolio (Sculpin IPA), Big Eye IPA is a wonderful example of a big, juicy, hop forward west coast styled IPA. This beer really showcases the pine-y and citrus-y Centennial hops quite well. I'd recommend this IPA to both the hoppy beer enthusiast and novice."

"DOA"
"Nothing to complain about here. This is a sort of quintessential IPA."

"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a copper body with a 1"" white head. The smell is extremely hoppy and citrus. The taste is awesome, very piney and some citrus with a nice bitter hop bite. The mouth feel is great and overall this is really good tasting IPA,"
""
""
"I would seek Big Eye out and drink it again."
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt rolled in brown sugar infused with apricot and piney citrussy hops. Very tasty and well-balanced. A bit more malt-forward than Sculpin. Very nice. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O: If you have the opportunity to try this definitely do. Personally, I think that this is the best IPA that Ballast Point produces, better than Sculpin IPA."
"Appearance is cloudy amber tone with one finger of head. This IPA from Ballast Point has a nose with orange, caramel, grapefruit and some light herbs. It has a taste of hops right away, more of those citrus fruits and a fair amount of malts. The mouthfeel is medium, some appropriate bitterness in the finish, but not overdone. With everything being considered, a good IPA, but nothing worth making a special trip to pick up."
""
""
""
""
"West coast IPA with a great deal of sweetness from the malts and a balanced mix of citrus and pine hops. My one gripe is that the alcohol isn't kept hidden despite the malt being capable enough to do so. Very good IPA overall, worth a try."
"Overall - If Sculpin IPA is a squeaky clean, high class, white collared IPA, this is it's rough and tumble, blue collared cousin. Flavors are big, bold and hold no punches."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great lingering juicy fruit character and light hop resin on the tongue. The malt character really blends beautifully with the hops to make a wonderful IPA"

"This is more of a standard IPA. Really good, better than alot, but not mind blowing. Maybe it's just because I had Sculpin for the first time yesterday. They're completely different. Either way, it's pretty nice and is one to try."
""
""
"Overall - I found this to be a superb IPA. For hopheads, it's a must."
""
"O: Reminds me a bit of the Steelhead Double IPA, but not with the enhanced citrus flavor that beer had. This is a good beer overall, but there's nothing too special, IMO. A bit on the malty side, which distracts from the flavor, but a better than average brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty nice IPA, but it's certainly no Sculpin. The nose is nice with a lot of hops and citrus/orange, but the taste is much less hoppy and has a lot of malts. Still a nice beer and easy to drink, just not a hop bomb. Worth having and would certainly have it again, but would pass on this if it was on the shelf next to Sculpin."

"Great stuff! A solid IPA, would love to get some more, and would definitely have again!!"

"O - For a centennial hops lover, a dream. Drinkability is a 10. Very well balanced and tasty. Can Ballast Point please distribute to GA? I bought a 6 pack in Laguna and had to have some more back home..."
""
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer exemplifies how IPAs should be. The body is neither coating nor sticky, but definitely impacts the mouth just right. The carbonation is just a little fizzy, which really helps to keep the body under control. Combined, this gives the body a smooth and creamy mouthfeel while still keeping the typical IPA drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Perfectly victorious bitter hops over caramel maltiness. Amazingly imbalanced."

"A good ipa, but not well balanced enough in my opinion. Needs more malt to balance out the bitterness of the hops. Other than that, its a very solid beer. Prefer sculpin."

"O: I'm usually into the more tropical IPAs, but this one is damn, damn, damn good. I found this 3 hours away from the only distributor in the state, so I was quite happy about that. We don't get ANY Ballast Point up here, so this was a great surprise. I'd definitely buy this again as a go-to IPA if it were more readily available. I like the hop and malt profile very much."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent, but the soapy hop profile mars its drinkability some. Well worth a try, but there are better IPAs on the market (perhaps including BP's very own Sculpin? Damnit, another beer to put on the wants list...)"
""
"The one part I was disappointed in was the after taste. Basically there was none. And I always want a strong finish."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"I poured a 22 ounce bottle into a pint glass. No freshness date listed, I am guessing this one is about two months old. A dark shade of amber with a pencil thin head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass as it is being drunk. The smell is nothing too special, but I am sure age played a part in that. Very little citrus, a fair amount of pine, some herbal notes and carmel on the nose. The taste follows the nose but finishes quite a bit more bitter and dry than I expected. Drinks very well. Sculpin takes the cake as far as a citrus forward IPA, but this is a very well balanced IPA and has a great finish. Another solid offering from Ballast Point."
""
"The hops jump right at you snarling but then the malt tether kicks in and pulls it back with some respectable, sweet balance in the finish and aftertaste. Sharp pine and floral hops have joined the citrus but again, the balance keeps this from being a hopsickle. Maybe a touch of honey along with the bread and grainy malt flavors. At 7% this isn't something you would pound it large quantities but it is tasty and different enough from your garden variety pale ale. I would definitely have this again, and would love to try it on tap as well."
""
"I don't know what the IBUs are but the abv is plenty. As a light weight two 7% IPAs made for a headachey night. Wish I'd gone with something more sessionable."
""
"Overall, a very good IPA. Well balanced, good hop flavor, very drinkable. If only this was available in MN!"

"O- A well balanced ipa, with no big faults, but not too memorable. Worth trying but prefer the more tropical presence of sculpin than this."

"O - I really like this one and it could easily become a go to IPA for me in the future."
""
"Cost: $5.99 for a 22 oz bottle."
"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a deep amber with great head and lacing. Spicy hop aroma with biscuity malt. Taste dominated by bitter peppery hops, although citrusy hops also make a respectable showing. Somewhat harsh mouthfeel with all the bitterness, but nice dry finish. As a San Diego style hop bomb, I like this but I wouldn't classify it as a favorite."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is drinkable and a solid example of the style. Not a hop bomb. A touch too heavy to drink in quantities, though. I usually pass this over for Sculpin, but Big Eye is a solid offering from Ballast Point."

""
"I tried this beer for the first time last night, and was surprised I'd never come across it before: I'm a big fan of IPAs, and for a standard IPA it featured just the right amount of hoppiness and easy drinkability that I enjoy. Definitely worth checking out!"
" The taste of this IPA is very citrus yet there are other elements that come off as herbal/floral without much in the way of vegetal, just a mild amount of hop spiciness. The citrus starts grapefruity but seems to hit the lemony side and verges toward orange rind zest in the middle when the malt sweetness is a little more noticeable. The flavor lasts well after the swallow with a mild peppery quality which blends well with the mild alcohol which seems to add a dry quality to the overall flavor, very juicy throughout and the flavor really rocks, I find the bitterness to be very smooth. Overall you can't find many better IPA's in the west coast style. This is a solid beer through and through. I don't think there can be much in the way of improving this I put it pretty close to the top."
""
""
"Taste is hop forward with just hints of flavor that was in the nose. A solid malt backbone follows. Feels thin on the palette and is intensely bitter at the cost of flavor unforunately. This beer looks and smells fantastic but taste is weak and thin. Just plain ol' bitter."

"Color is a nice orange-amber capped by a thick white head. The head fades pretty quickly though. Nice lacing. Loads of citrus (orange and grapefruit) hit the nose upon opening. The taste isn't quite a citrusy as the smell might suggest. Piney and herbal hops are in the forefront, and a bit harsh to the tongue, but sweet caramel malt flavors are noticeable. A pretty good IPA, but not among the best."

"I really like this one a lot. I've heard all the hype about the Sculpin and it deserves all the hype it gets, but this one is a very worthy beer itself. Ballast Point produces winners and this is no exception. Another fine West Coast IPA that I have had the pleasure of enjoying."
"Well crafted and flavorful - meets definition of San Diego IPA, but has a sense of balance that provides a pleasing sipper."
"O- Great IPA. Second beer I've tried from Ballast Point and I've enjoyed both mightily."
"poures a bright golden copper body with a two finger off white head that slowly fades down to a frothy cap while leaving a good amount of lacing. smell is sweet malts, big citrus hops. taste is citrus hops with a very well balanced malt backbone to carry thru start to finish. mouthfeel starts out sticky but fades to a dry ever so slightly bitter finish. has good carbonation also. overall i'm very pleased with this beer. my only complaint is that i wish the head didnt fade so fast."
"Poured out as a light hazy yellow color with a creamy white colored head on top. The lacing wasn't too bad but could have been a little better I thought. The smell of the hops came through pretty well but were a bit muted I think. The taste wasn't too bad. The hops were softer than expected but I feel that this happens to most IPA's from a cask. The mouthfeel was soft and had a light creaminess to it. Overall this beer was pretty good, I have a feeling that it would be better on regular draft."
"O: a decent ipa but to be honest there are off putting notes in the taste and a slight off scent in the nose, not sure if this bottle has turned or if this is typical of this brew, overall drinkable and id call it nice enough"
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is quicklky fizzy, modestly foamy, and overall smooth across the palate. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness from the malt heaviness lingering across the palate."
"Overall a very good American IPA. Super bitter, tons of hops. Very drinkable but not extremely complex, could see putting several of these down in a row."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is big on hops, some citrus notes. Taste is also very hop heavy, a touch of citrus, considerable bitterness throughout. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"California brewers seem to have a knack for the American IPA, and this is no exception. Amber-gold color with a bright whiff of hops right away. Nice balance of bittering and aroma hops, with perhaps a bit less than average malt sweetness. Easy to drink despite the 7% abv. A nicely crafted beer."
"Overall, this is excellent IPA fare, having good balance between hops and nutty grain flavors, and having just enough bitterness to gnaw softly at the tongue while still leaving the flesh intact. Recommended."
"O - Pretty good overall, though the balance leans towards more hops than I would like. I prefer the sculpin IPA over this one."
"Overall a good American IPA."
"The bite is quenching. A hint of pine squeezes out. A very nice IPA"
"I must say I'm not sure how fresh this is. I live in PA, and this may have been sitting on the shelf for a while. I'd love to try one that I know is fresh to see if my impression changes. I definitely like this beer a lot, but I prefer their Sculpin over this. I would definitely buy this again, though."
"O - Great beer, the citronella candle thing is kinda confusing. It comes into play in the aroma and also in the taste. Not unpleasant. Definitely work seeking out."
"I picked this up in the tickers BIF, it pours a clear gold, nice sized head, good lacing. The aroma is nice, mostly citrus, hints of pine. The flavors are similar to the aroma, the finish lingers with sweet oranges. The body is medium, good carbonation. An enjoyable IPA."
"D - Oh so drinkable. Now on tap at Petco Park. Yeah!"
"Drinkability is super high. I've had this a few times, and always enjoyed it, a true west-coast style IPA exactly as I like them, I'm always happy to be somewhere (besides my home state) where I can get my hands on it."
"O: a decent IPA, some good hops and malt usage, not completely balanced yet, needs some work."
"Overall a good IPA that does not a lot wrong, bar the suspended particles. Otherwise, life in SoCal must be pretty good if you can find this easily and cheaply."
"Note: leaves quite the spicy/bitter taste on the tongue. Lasts a long long time."
"Cheers!"
"O: This is a really nice IPA. Tons of citrus flavor. If there was a little malt in the back, this would be one of my favorites, but it is still a fantastic brew."
"Pours clear amber with a white head. Nose is sweet juicy tropical fruits, caramel malt, citrus rind, hops. Mouth is bright, very hoppy, fruit sugars, orange candy. Bitter throughout the palate. Quite good, maybe better than Sculpin though I'd want them side by side."
"Overall: There's a ton of beer in this beer. So much flavor packed into an IPA I'd almost think it was a Double."
"O - Overall, this was interesting, a very different Big Eye then I am use to. I usually drink this stuff like water at Old Grove BP here in San Diego and rarely get this in bottle form... Especially from a off liqueur store off the wall in the middle of San Diego. I swear this was bottle conditioned for a few months at least??"
"Excellent - hoppy and delicious! Plenty of hop flavour, but well balanced by the malt. Dry and spicy on the palate. A must-try if you have the opportunity."
"This was in my sights for a while. Pours a deep gold, amber, head is thick but dissipates quickly. The scent is underwhelming, not strong. Some citrus and hop notes. Taste is pure grapefruit and pineapple punch. Hoppy and bitter, nice pucker factor. Has the requisite piney resins as well. Bitter mouthfeel, not sticky, tacky maybe. Great IPA!"
"I will try again, but it would be nice if they gave best by dates so I know if this bottle is old or they need to do a better job of late hop additions and dry hopping."
"Quite a good IPA here. Pours a deep orange-amber into the glass, with a small cap that diminishes to a thin ring, leaving nice soapy lace. A large amount of citrus and pine comes through in the floral bouquet. The flavors, impeccably balanced, weave a blend of soft caramel malt, citrus and rind zest, some grapefruit and moderately peppering bitters. The finish lasts nicely, bringing back grapefruit and zest, closing with lingering pine resin. Everything about this brew is refreshing and clean. The mouthfeel is crisp and quaffable, with well-integrated carbonation levels. Very fine example of the style, and I’m so glad I picked up a case to enjoy for some time to come. Superb."
"A decent beer overall. It really grew on me on as it went on. I’d give it another shot."
"The flavor is sweet and carmally, don't know if it is an old bottle or what, I was expecting a west-coast ipa. This one lacks bitterness. It has alot of orange flavor. It is like a more pedestrian version of a Two-Hearted."
"O- Pretty malty but well balanced with the citrus hops. A good ipa for sure though."
"Has a lot of similarities with bitters (like Campari or tonic). Really fucking good. Need to grab a couple sixers if I ever see this!"
"Edit: Just had a bottle, and while great, it is definately not like freshly tapped!"
"Really good regular IPA from the west coast, exactly what you would expect."
"Enjoy!"
"Overall: I have been pleased with most of Ballast Pointe's offerings. I have had 5 or 6 of their brews now though this is the first I am reviewing."
"O: A very good IPA with lots of flavor and a good balance of hops, malt, and bitterness."
"Pours a dark gold/amber color without much head but with delicately clinging brussels lace. Aroma is hoppy with all those subtle notes you expect from a west coast IPA. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more noticeable in the nose as well as in the mouth. Taste-wise this is another very balanced beer from BP, one that's quite hoppy but not overblown into bitter nothingness..the malt is in there and you can taste it. Medium-thin mouthfeel and low to moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Not exactly a lightweight summer brew but a classic american IPA that's perhaps a step down from Sculpin...particularly in the aromatics department..not as much of that delightful citrus flavor here. Still, excellent."
"Overall, this is a fine brew but it might taste better on a cold winter night."
"O: This is a solid I.P.A. with good drinkability and a fair amount of complexity. I didn't find it as balanced or flavorful as the Sculpin I.P.A., which I was really blown away by. I also found this to be a bit heavier, more astringent and harder on the stomach than the Sculpin. That said, this is definitely a quality brew and you really can't go wrong here; I just prefer the less bitter more balanced and more flavorful Sculpin. Ballast Point continues to impress, though. Cheers!"
"-this is an all around ""good"" beer. i had a hard time giving it any other grade. there is nothing exemplary about it, but tasty nonetheless"
"Brewing an IPA is not splitting the atom. All you need is a boatload of hops and, should you chose, some malt to balance it out a bit. The ""IPA for Dummies"" book only need be a page long. That said, Ballast Point makes a masterpiece of it; between the flagship Big Eye and award-winning Sculpin IPA, these guys really set their hoppy offerings apart from the pack."
"Overall: A nice IPA if you are not a hop head, preferring a balance of malts and hops. If you want a tongue-thrashing of citrus hops pick up a Sculpin instead."
"O - Overall, this is a good IPA. I enjoyed it for sure but it's definitely Sculpin's little brother."
"An easy drinking IPA that's somewhat sweet for the style. Could use a touch more more bitterness and hop flavor."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden amber, moderate cap of frothy white head, decent lacing. Scent is straightforward piney and grapefruity hops with a lightly sweet malt backbone. taste is again basic but solid and follows scent. Medium bodied, decent carbonation, lightly dry. A nice, straightforward IPA that is not overly aggressive."
"Overall I like it but inwould go sculpin over this every day."
"Overall (3.5): A solid IPA, but it feels more like an East Coast IPA. A lot of sweetness balances out the bitterness, but I'd prefer it dryer and more aromatic. The beer is very well crafted however, even though it's not my favorite take on the style."
"O-the bitterness seems to tame down as the drink goes on. this is definitely an interesting IPA that I'd recommend. its definitely a good drinker as well. i'd say the sculpin is still beyond this though."
"D - Well constructed, lives up to the hype. Looking forward to not only revisiting this one, but also trying out some of their other brews. Reco."
"O=Outstanding. Ballast point is quickly becoming a favorite of mine."
"Pours Dark gold, with a nice white head. This one has a nice huge hoppy aroma (some light citrus, pine). On the palate, I get some nice, big earthy hop flavors. Good malt presence tempers the bitterness a little, but it is still quite prevelant. A nice hoppy/bitter IPA."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I wish it was available in Wisconsin. Luckily I can trade for it from the great BAs on this site."
"This is my first from Ballast Point and I am a fan for sure. This is case worthy drink anything stuff here. Excellent."
"Decent beer just not sure if it's an A for me. Has some difficulty acheiving a novel original taste. I'd nearly call it a basic or ""typical"" IPA which is why I didn't give it an A. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't go to great lengths to get it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Umm, yeah. This is very good. Hoppy, balanced, this has some characters of bigger beers and its really tasty. This really sometimes could be mistaken for a dipa. Im thinkin I really like centennial hops. A lot."
"D: A very enjoyable, extremely well-brewed IPA. Centennial and Columbus work extremely well here to provide a big citric presence with a nice herbal/floral secondary note. I'd been reluctant to pick one up here on the East Coast because I wasn't sure how fresh it would be, but this is excellent beer."
"Overall this could be one of my favorite IPAs. Very nice balance. It's not over complicated. Very nice floral and piney notes with an amazing truffle finish that makes me want to take another quick sip just to get to the finish. Aftertaste is very pleasant. This is a well made IPA that I look forward to sharing with others."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This brew pours a pale copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is very nice with aromas of sweet brown sugar,resiny piney hops,boiled candy and sticky toffee,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of sweet caramel,pineapple,piney hops and finished with a stone fruit bitterness and overall a very pleasant AIPA and very enjoyable definately recommend."
"Mouthfeel was creamy and chewy, with high, crisp carbonation, a medium body and a smooth, easy feel as it flows over the tongue and leaves a buttery residue. This is a great session beer, especially for an IPA, and a solid overall IPA which I recommend trying."
"O-solid brew. Wish it was in my area"
"Overall, this beer was highly drinkable despite its flaws but it doesn’t stand up to Sculpin or other West-coast IPAs I’ve tried."
"Had on tap at the Good Life in Massapequa Park with some good food and great friends. Beer arrived in a scotch ale tulip. Beer had a nice deep amber color with good visual carbonation and a nice head. Flavor and nose lead with bittery hops. The hops lead the way, but are not too intense. Hops are a bit sweaty and a bit piny, but nicely balanced out with malts giving an even rounded sweetness. There was a good malt balance and nice sweetness. Medium to light bodied a bit on the watery side, but it works well for this beer. This is a pretty solid and cooling IPA that I could drink many of."
"A good IPA, and one with an unusual amount of body to it. It's not a hop bomb, nor is it the best IPA for its price."
"This was a nice IPA. Tasty and drinkable and a different character than Sculpin. I'm glad I picked it up - I've passed over it so many times because I'm so in love with Sculpin. This is not necessarily an inferior, B-grade IPA - it's just a different take on the style. Very enjoyable."
"-overally - an excellent IPA!!!"
"O- Overall I can not complain. Towards the top, but there are better IPAs out there."
"O - Was interested to see how it stacked up with Sculpin after someone said they were quite similar. I disagree. Big Eye holds its own and then some - another great beer from BP. Hope I can find more."
"Overall: A great IPA that I will make my standard until a better comes along. And at a nice strong 7% a well-rounded beer."
"A great IPA. Very drinkable and all around really nice. I would love to have this again at any time it was available to me."
"Overall: This is a good West Coast IPA. Not the best one I have had, but would still get it at a bar or buy another bomber."
"excellent IPA."
"D: great nose. classic big california AIPA. just slightly disappointed in the palate. im finding the oak-like flavor to be a turn-off."
"A fair amount of sweet pale malt in the nose. Hoppy aromas seem equal parts floral and citrus zest. Bitterness is more aggressive than the nose suggests, a touch piney at times, but the citrus and floral qualities are more prominent. Finishes nice and dry, a bit toasty. A minor complaint is that it's rather boozy for only 7%. Not bad, but forgettable in the grand scheme of things, particularly as a west-coast IPA. Gimme a bottle date, Ballast Point, and I'll be glad to revisit. Hard to believe this comes from the same brewery that produces the incredible Sculpin."
"Overall - An excellent IPA that is a must try for fans of the style. I'm looking forward to trying their DIPA."
"Overall, the Big Eye IPA is a lovely beer - easy drinking with fantastic flavor. At 7% ABV this IPA drinks much lower. I'm glad to try this San Diego brew and hope to have it again."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery, the beer was served in a pint glass. It pours a hazy, copper-gold coloring with no discernable head. The nose was hoppy and sweet, with green characteristics like fresh-cut grass. The flavors are peppery-hops initially, with flowery sweet follow-up to balance. The beer is crisp and light-bodied, with an increased carbonation to help carry the flavors. The aftertaste is once again spicy-hopped and slightly bitter. The finish is a little rough, as the downside to increased carbonation rears its ugly head. The beer is good, but the finish makes it a tougher drink than some other IPAs I've had. Very tasty beer, though!"
"an older bottle. in my head there are two types of qualities an ipa can have... A heavy wood pine resin almost walnut... And a brisk fruity floral. This is an attempt at the first varital. Malt driven... Autumn apple nose and nougat. Apple with a woody bitter. Some oils. Great for cheese but not too pungent a cheese."
"Just an o.k. beer for me from a really good brewery."
"Overall a solid IPA. Decent price for a 6er"
"D - Very drinkable west coast IPA. Not overly bitter, great hop tastes and aromas, and satisfying. I could definitely have another. Picked this one up on a whim and I'm glad I did."
"Having tried Sculpin, I have to say I was more in favor of Big Eye's overall balance. Highly recommended!"
"Drink- Like Ruination it has been a long time. Very well done and will continue to re-visit from time to time. When something is so close to your own backyard you take it for granted."
"Drank from a tulip glass."
"This is a solid IPA. Whenever my mind goes to Ballast Point, I think ""Sculpin," but this beer is still memorable because it does its own thing. It's actually pretty balanced. I need to have this again."
"Wow an IPA with some balance. Not just a simple basic malt bill with an overhopped listing of ridiculous amounts."
"Next time I'm looking to satisfy my hop madness with something from Ballast Point, it's possible I'll ignore the Sculpin and grab one of these."
"overall this is a damn fine beer. in a sibling rivalry showdown it's clearly no sculpin, but then few IPAs are. my biggest complaint is with ballast point not dating its bottles. when you have a beer (an IPA no less) traveling across the country before sitting around a bottle shop, that info is nice to know. that said, no question these guys know how to brew an IPA."
"O - I loved this beer, great flavors and balance."
"O - I enjoyed this, but it was a bit of a palate wrecker (in a good way) that made it difficult to pick up any other tastes."
"Enjoyable IPA that I would be happy to have again and again."
"I am lucky to have had this many times in the past and can get this West Coast bomb whenever I want. I do believe that our pallets change over the years (or maybe get used to what we drink a lot of), but this one used to be much less balanced towards the malts and all hops, but it is not the same animal as it used to be (or maybe I am not the same animal?) So I am rambling.. This is well balanced west coast IPA. Highly recommended!!"
"Pours a yellow and orange mix with a one-finger bright white head. Nice lacing throughout for a quickly dissipating head. Mostly caramel aroma, hints of grapefruit and orange deep in the nose. Sweet caramel and toffee malt starts off the flavor profile. Some cracker sweetness as well. A bit of pineapple, mango and orange hops in the middle, hard to reach for. Semi-bitter crisp pine resin and more toffee and caramel malt linger on the finish. A nice brew."
"The CPJ"
"D - There is really good drinkability here. I would have no problem drinking quite a few of these in a sitting. It has a very nice flavor, it looks great, and it is an easy drinker. I like this beer, and i recommend giving it a try."
"D: Too easy to take down. The bitterness is big, but the smooth feel and solid body make this a pleasure to drink. Glad I had a chance to have a fresh on-tap shot at this one."
"D-Have loved this IPA for awhile, one of my favorites. Its got the perfect bite I look for in an IPA"
"This beer is excellent."
"D-> Very drinkable. Great balance, bitter and yet subtly sweet at the same time. Great carbonation also. Borderline session-able even @ 7%.."
"D - Very nice, plenty of hops without killing you, sweet fruitiness makes it unique."
"Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a thick long lasting head. The aroma of hops is quite strong. Has a smooth mellow taste with hops very evident but not too overpowering and finishes with lemon hints. I can definetly see why this beer is rated what it is. A must try!"
"I served this a bit high (15c) which maybe let the fruitiness in the taste dominate a bit too much."
"Ballast Point is a local favorite of mine and you always know what you are gonna get with a Big Eye. A massive brew loaded with hops and great malt flavors. Get to the point!"
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, citrus, mango, pineapple, and orange. In the taste, starts pine like hops to a orange citrus end, with a nice balanced malt all the way through. A hop bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry citrus hop in the aftertaste. Nice hops and it could be a daily drinker."
"Drinkability: While I enjoyed this beer I also found myself wishing once in a while that the malt sweetness would assert itself just a bit more and pop in once in a while to break up the grapefruit/pine resin bitterness. That said I'll be happy to have this one again next time I find it since it is a good, well made beer with few things to fault."
"D - Very good and got better as it warmed up."
"D: Drinkability is high ... alcohol is hidden fairly well, mouthfeel is great, and the flavors are a little mild. Less to appreciate here so it goes down very quickly. Still recommended."
"Enjoy."
"Pours translucent amber orange with a good 2-3 fingers of head and leaves a trail of sticky lacing behind. Big sweet floral aroma and citrus hops with a nice complement of malt make for a great scent. Was expecting more hops (don't see a bottled on date), though there is a nice crisp hop presence, again with citrus and florals dominating the hop profile. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for an IPA, but some slightly oily feeling is there. Carbonation level is good, and the finish is dry with a lingering bitterness that is very pleasant. Very enjoyable, this is going down pretty fast. Alcohol is well hidden."
"D - Goes down easy. Again I find myself wishing I could get more. The strengths of this beer complement the weaknesses of Sculpin, I'd love to try a beer that combined Sculpin's nose and taste with the appearance and feel of this beer, and hell while we're at it let's bump it up to a double IPA. You do that and you've got a real challenger for PtE."
"Very drinkable, not as good as Sculpin to me, but at 7% it is an easy drink that hits the spot."
"D- For 6%, the Big Eye packs a punch. Hits hard and doesn't back down. I can feel it starting to weigh me down, but that won't stop me from drinking this great California beer."
"D: I can't rate it very high as far as drinkability as the sweetness and tartness makes it hard for me to stomach and this keg doesn't seem too fresh. I hope to try this under fresher circumstances sometime."
"D - Very drinkable. Sweet, but not too sweet. I definitely want to keep going back for more. I almost feel that if you combine this beer with sculpin, you would have one of the best IPAs. All of the strengths in this beer are the faults in Sculpin."
"Initially a two finger white head, slowly dissipates. Burnt orange, light amber hue. Very clear. Fruity-sweet bouquet. Some distinct floral and hop flavors. Not malty sweet. Pretty thick texture, juicy and chewy, very nice. I'm sensing a dominance of finishing hops in this beer. I'm getting a mix of peaches and oranges. It's not so much bitter as it is flavorful. The malt backs up those flavors but doesn't distract. This reminds me of the Marin IPA, which I like a lot for the same reasons. Big on flavor, not on bombarding your taste buds."
"Overall a very good beer, I would definitely recommend trying this one if your an IPA fan."
"D: Probably better known as ""Not Sculpin"" by IPA seekers, this beer fulfills a necessary position in the Ballast Point pantheon and sends a clear message that the brewery is so dedicated to the IPA style that they will successfully produce and market two versions of the style. Maltier than Sculpin or Green Flash's West Coast IPA, this beer reminds of some of the better IPAs commonly encountered in Oregon--Deschutes Inversion IPA comes to mind. (The most similar IPA from the San Diego area is Port's Wipeout IPA.) A very solid brew, but a little more sweetness early and less astringency in the finish could improve appeal even further."
"Overall, a solid beer. The Ballast Point Sculpin is MUCH better, but this is found more easily in our parts. Good by-product if you can't get the Sculpin."
"Body is thinner than average, but enough that it isn't watery. Drinkability is pretty high, as the finish may not be perfect, but the rest of the drink is very pleasant and easy, although the abv may be too high to call this a session beer. Really nice sweet/bitter combination, and a welcome change of pace."
"A solid real great tasting IPA out of the bottle."
"big eye is a great brew."
"D - Very balanced IPA, not to heavy handed, good bit of bitterness but lots of aroma also. Nice body really makes this is great IPA to enjoy a few of."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a not a bad brew at all. Definitely had a big hoppy profile going on here in both the aroma and flavor aspect of it. The followthrough on this one was very crisp with a good flavor and aroma. This one is a must try if you have not already."
"D: This is what I consider an all night drinker as far as IPA's go. I could and have posted up on these all night."
"I have no idea how fresh this is, since there is no dating. This is the 2nd time trying this beer (once with the old label, and this with the new labeling). I think I heard that Ballast Point will be dating their offerings sometime this year, so maybe I'll give it another try then with a re-review...until then, please date your beers (especially hoppy styles) brewers!"
"D: Very nice! All around a great beer. Good amount of hops and a subtle malt finish."
"6.6% ABV. Poured into a dimple glass from a 12oz bottle. Appearance gave off a dark amber color. Smelled sweet floral hops. Tasted very smooth, citrusy, some caramel, and hoppy. Mouthability gave off a big foamy head, and was medium-bodied. Drinkability was a nice smooth malty character. I really liked this over the more popular Ballast Point Sculpin' IPA."
"Overall Ive just never been very impressed with this beer. To me it is a run of the mill IPA. Not bad not great just eh."
"Wow this is beautiful. Impeccably clear deep coppery amber. Topped by a huge, well retaining, frothy, heavily lacing white head. Large bands on the glass are left behind and big, rocky islands all over the place. The aroma burst from the bottle as soon as I opened it and waves of pine-forward resin flushed my olfactory organ. Closer inspection yielded a fainter grapefruit. Once the pour was complete, the aroma was much less pronounced. This is not to say, however, that the flavor is in any way compromised. There's a lot going on here. The sip starts with caramel and biscuits, which provide a nice, sweet background for the well-balanced pine and citrus. This is almost like chewing a grapefruit rind, then switching it out to suck on a pine cone! Resiny with an herbal and bitter finish complemented by a slightest hint of spice from the alcohol, but not harsh at all. Texture is quite smooth and a fairly big body. The carbonation could stand to be a touch more pronounced, but works in a ""sipper"" setting. I tip the balance over to being more dry than sweet, but still towards the middle. Quite a delightful beer in which to imbibe. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack of this."
"Overall a good IPA with nice citric notes a sweet/bitter balance."
"Overall this is a pretty average IPA. I've had worse but I've had much better. That said, I think IPAs are pretty standard for the most part, only a few really stick out, but those that do make the style one of my favorites. Big Eye is not one of those IPAs."
"Pours a extremely clear amber hue with perfect head formation. The look of this beer is amazing and should be the rule of thumb. The aroma is not very strong but carries the usual hoppy citrus, and flower/fruit aroma. mouth feel is great as the brew does not rip your mouth apart with extremly bitter hops and no flavor...quit the opposite. The brew has a perfect carbonation level that helps push the great hops citrus and fruity flavors threw. It is not an intense flavor out of control, but restrained. This makes this beer very drinkable at 7%. Would keep this beer in my fridge for company to try."
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Nice bright orange hue, slightly hazy. Large foaming head. The aroma of centential hops permiates the air. There is no shortage of bitterness and floral hops throughout this session. The body is medium with medium carbonation. Very similar in taste as Stone IPA, probably to do with the water and hop content."
"Nice hoppy, fruity IPA. Will buy again."
"D - I'd definitely get this again. I feel it gets overlooked by Sculpin, but this is a fine IPA in itself."
"Drink: Not bad but I'd grab a Sculpin over this in a heartbeat (unless I was short on cash, then I'd grab this.). Very nice beer Ballast Point. Keep on keepin' on."
"D - Not a bad beer, but doesn't compare to Sculpin for me, although I'm sure it's not supposed to. Solid, but I wouldn't drink this regularly."
"D: A good, refreshing west coast IPA"
"D: Excellent. Highly quaffable, especially if you like hops."
"What a joy! Introduced on a rainy Saturday and I make sure never to run out of it. Has a very nice body and just enough hop feel to the pallet. This is one of the most consistent IPAs I have tried on the market and a personal favorite of mine. Pours fairly light in color with a slight head. Aroma is decent at pour. Balance of malt and hops ids perfect as body and hop linger on the pallet is what makes this beer truly exceptional."
"The mouthfeel on this beer is fairly thick, but it still goes down smoothly. The drinkability is about average of the style (which I usually find quite drinkable to begin with). A solid IPA, but not a standout like Sculpin is. Still worth drinking though."
"Cheers!"
"East coast IPA? APA? It definitely has the malt profile to be an APA... I'll go with APA, definitely have to be. It is a really good one. I love it. This twelve ounces could easily be a bomber with no complaints from me. Low alcohol, of course... maybe even a high sixer, I'm feeling a bit fuzzier than normal after my normal review period, but that could be all the candy from earlier."
"D/O- The alcohol is apparent in this beer. My second delicious IPA from Ballast Point. I prefer the first, Sculpin, but then again I'd take that over any IPA. Recommended."
"D: High."
"Verdict: World class IPA and one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D: Baby-Sculpin's got game!... that's for certain. If I were at the Ballast Point brewery and it was the end of the night and was ready for my last round... I think this would be my finale!"
"Overall, a good beer but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
"D. It's very interesting how the flavors play with each other, but by the end of the bottle it's almost like a wrestling match on your tongue, which is to say not terribly pleasant. That said I did enjoy this beer - I just wish I'd consumed it a bit quicker and slightly colder."
"It arrived with a finger of soapy light-tan head that was already working to create some nice lacing. Nose was like standing in a pine forest and taking a deep whiff. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Mouthfeel was silky smooth with a great pine-hops bite that really got my attention. It was like having the dentist grab my tongue with pliers and then get at it with a scrub brush. One new palate later, the finish left me gasping for breath. Zounds!"
"D: Good, easy drinking IPA. A little malt-forward for my preferences."
"Pours a yellow orange color with a thick white head and tons of lacing left over. Smells of strong hops aroma with a ton of citrus in there. Tastes of orange zest with tons of hops to overpower a small amount of malt. Mouthfeel is nice and bubbly. Drinkability is pretty good."
"It really is a refreshing beer, with such a sweet and juicy flavor. Being a 7% IPA, it could have definitely taken me longer to finish, so Big Eye has got that on it's side. A good beer for sure, just not an awesome IPA."
"Pours a clear dark amber with creamy two finger white head, fades to quarter inch leaving splotches of chunky lace. Smell: slightly minty, pineapple, leafy and herbal, background caramel. A little mellow and off mainstream but nice enough. Taste: caramel and a little sweet melon beneath lemon, pineapple, and herbal hops. Nice carbonation, fairly creamy. Pretty damn good for ones standard IPA. Unreadable bottling code."
"D: If you see this on draft, it's worth it."
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with an average sixe foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of bitter and lightly citrus notes are dominant thought not as powerful as expected. Taste is also dominated by bitter and citrusy notes with a lightly sweet malt base. Body is about average with OK carbonation. Well brewed thought I was expecting a more powerful hops profile."
"Drinkability is a-ok. I could have a few of these just fine without wearing down my palate."
"This is an overall excellent IPA and, at 7ABV, it's close to a double. The color gives it away: this sucker is nearly orange, with a nice white lace noted elsewhere, although it's not uber-hopped -- for a high-end of the AIPA abv, my tongue was not in pain but great pleasure drinking this one."
"D - I enjoyed this one quite a bit but I think even with all the additions they made it is still only on par with the regular version of sculpin."
"Bottle. Pours a darker golden color with a big fluffy slightly off white head. Aroma is more malty than hoppy but the hops presence is more of a citrus variety then pine. The taste is more malty than I thought it would be but it does have a nice hops character to it. Nice lace left on the glass. Lingering bitterness with a touch of sweetness. Very easy drinking."
"Truly a world class IPA."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice off-white head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some citrusy and grassy hops upfront with a piney background, along with some caramel and orange marmalade, fruity esters, biscuit and some alcohol. The flavor also has bright piney and citrusy hop notes with some grassy flavors as well, along with biscuit and caramel, fruity esters, a chalkiness and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thick side and drinkable is decent. A very tasty IPA, not super complex or drinkable but hits all the right notes."
"D - Yes and please more! I have not had many IPA's this smooth and hopefully had this fresh but I am loving the flavor and bite. I will probably make this a regular."
"12oz bottle with No Freshness Date on it. Pours a translucent orange with a thin head. Lots of lacing. Strong aroma of hops, grapefruit and orange. Flavors of hops and grapefruit. Not all that bitter. Not overly abusive on the pallet and somewhat light for the style. A very drinkable, citrusy IPA."
"Linger: 2"
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these with no problem. One of my favorite American IPA's."
"M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall a very solid IPA. Would love to get this bad boy in 12oz bottles. A great go to beer."
"Pours deep orange with an off-white head that has great retention. Fairly sweet aroma with malt and sugar, along with a good dose of citrus hops. Taste is more hoppy than the smell would indicate, but it maintains good balance with the malt. Citrus, pine, and tropical fruit flavors along with the malt backbone. Finishes bitter; this is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Nicely drinkable, this is a great IPA."
"D/O- I enjoyed it, but I'm not running to the store for another. It's just another IPA that gets lost in the every expanding IPA shelf at my local beer store. Worth a try, but don't go out of your way to acquire this one. Cheers."
"The body is pretty mild, with medium carbonation. Big Eye is really a very easy drinking IPA, with a very nice hop character and clean finish. That said, there are plenty of readily available mid-west IPAs that are as good, if not better, than Big Eye IPA, so, for me, it really isn't worth seeking out more than once."
"Cheers..."
"DB- This beer is strange to me. A citrus bomb that somehow reminds me of apple cider. A drinkable, refreshing IPA."
"Overall this is an excellent IPA. Seek it out."
"Great drinker."
"Deep copper in color with a deep haze. Poured with a thin off-white head that reduced to a very thin cap. Sticky lacings let you know how full your glass was at one time. Big floral hop aroma that includes pine, orange and a bit of grapefruit. Some malty sweetness sneaks through as well. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and buttery smoothness. Piney hop flavor dominates in the front with hints of citrus sneaking through and maltiness in the background that never gives up. The pine flavor tapers at the end to allow a citrus and malty sweet finish with a tapering bitter hop aftertaste. Not as good as Sculpin, but damn good."
"Light tan head the body is an orange amber color, light lacing around the glass. The beer has a citrus hopy smell. Mild carbonation, bitter after taste. Tastes like the average IPA nothing really stands out. Its an easier drinker and I would have it again. But it is nothing specail."
"I'm glad I got to try this! Ballast Point seems to be a great brewery and I'll consider doing a locals4locals brewery specific with them sometime. I still want to try the Dorado Double, and get a few more bottles of Sculpin!"
"Nose if floral and citrus, with a little pine. Similar hop flavors give way to a strong and persistent bitterness that dominates the aftertaste. At first the bitterness seems to balance the malt sweetness, but it really builds and tends to dominate the experience."
"Drinks well. Nothing stands out to much to curl your nose at. Still, nothing stood out enough in my mind to make this a more interesting complex mix. I'd prefer more hops and citrus, but that's a personnal like. Those who do not like the bolder hop brews would probably like this."
"I've always been hesitant to buy Big Eye IPA in the stores in KS because it never seems to ever move. I was happy to find this in my recent package from Overlord. Poured a 12oz long neck into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a aged pumpkin orange with a bright creamy 3 inch cap that threatens to over pour at any minute. The nose is very orangey. Orange pith with a bit of grapefruit. More like fresh oranges then sweet orange juice. Fairly one dimensional. The flavor is very similar. Very orangey, a bit of tangerine and pith. A mild sweetness hits the back of the palate for a fleeting second. Almost a candy sugar sweetness. The mouthfeel is disappointing. Its light and airy, slightly full and fades rather quickly. Not very dry. Overall, this would really fall under the average craft section. Its a shame, cause I love me some Sculpin."
"D: Tastes great, but it's pretty heavy for a plain-jane IPA. A great beer, though. I'm going to need some Sculpin soon...."
"In the middle of west coast IPA taste test bonanza. Poured into a goblet, pours a nice amber color. As you would expect it has anice hoppy aroma, but with more a malt backbone than I would have expected after mostly enjoying Sculpin from BP. Overall this is an enjoyable IPA with a more balanced floral aroma and almost sweet taste. I liked it, but for the east coast price it wouldn't be my first pick."
"MF- Just a little thick but with good carbonation levels."
"D - Oh so refreshing and clean. Easy drinking and great tasting makes this an excellent IPA. Definitely a great example of the style."
"Very nice IPA, much more well-balanced than its brother Sculpin, though probably not quite as good. Still very nice beer."
"Overall- A solid IPA."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Alcohol is hidden and wish this one was easier to get here."
"D: Hot day, give me one or five."
"D - Very good balance that keeps you coming back for another sip."
"D- this is an interesting ipa coming for ballast point. More of an east coast feel going on here but still distinctly their work. I could totally have a few of these."
"D-Drinkable enough. As stated, it's certainly not a spectacular beer, but it's still solid and enjoyable."
"D- this is really good...tastes a lot like Sculpin with a little more bitterness. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd drink it a lot more"
"Big Eye is a pretty darn good IPA. It doesn't get into my upper tier, but it's still heartily recommended. Especially if you're of the hophead persuasion."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a light amber with a two-finger white head which dissipated into a lasting coating. Lacing was not heavy but present 'til the last sip. Nose was pine and citrus (lemon, grapefruit, orange). Taste was apricots, citrus (grapefruit, lemons, oranges), and caramel. You can notice the alcohol, but it is not unpleasant. This is a nicely balanced IPA for sure. Mouthfeel was medium, a bit oily but with a clean, dry, and mildly bitter hop bite in the finish. Carbonation is healthy, by observation and by feel. I was pleasantly surprised by this and will definitely have more - now and later."
"Drinkability- really enjoy the balance and great taste on t his one, even way better the second time i had this beer alot warmer so keep that in mind, very flavorful, great balance, and super drinkable very good ipa"
"Mouthfeel is clean and sharp with a good level of carbonation, and a nice medium-low body."
"D: Intense bitterness but great for a hop lover. It is a bit off balance for me but still very tasty. Would stop after 2 of these though."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, malty aroma that boasts of pale, crystal and bisquit malts along with a pretty damn fine hop scent. The taste is good. It has a well balanced flavor that's equally bitter and malty. The malt bill offers up as complex array of flavors including caramel, bisquit, and pale malt tastes. The hop character is good. It has a massively bitter, citrus hop taste that hits you up front and carries on through to the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine IPA. It's more complex than your typical citrus hop bomb. The malt bill adds good balance."
"D- This drinks about right for the style. It's a shame there is nothing memorable about this."
"Cheers!"
"Exceptional IPA. On draft this was fantastic. Great orange-amber color with some haziness. Head was thick and stayed until the bottom of the glass. This brew has a killer nose and mouthfeel. Hops on the nose and in the mouth. Taste is intense IPA, but smooth and lingering on the pallet. A big brew, but easily accessable. If available near you---I highly recommend!"
"Drinkability - pretty high actually very high. not a session-able beer by any means but it is an IPA that you can easily put down and pick up another with out even thinking about it."
"A decent IPA which is still memorable although not quite amazing. Nice balance and drinkability - this would be perfect with pizza."
"Drinkability: When I smelled this brew I was like not again--same indistinguishable American IPA. However, this beer opens up just about as much as any beer I have had when tasted. There are a lot of layers here. A nice and complex beer, I could have two or three."
"Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown color with a creamy head and nice soapy lacing. Aroma is off the wall with sweet piney hops, pineapple and lots pinecone woodiness. Flavor is nice too. Has a deep bitter hop bite. Loads of grapefruit and orange peel. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. The drinkability lacks because it's too strong both flavor wise and alcohol content to enjoy too many of these. Still a good beer, but for an ipa, it's too much for me."
"D: Very, Very drinkable. Yes, I did like the taste better than the Sculpin. Incredibly good. I think of this type of IPA as the standard/straight vs the Sculpin as the more blended/contemporary IPA. As a straight or original IPA taste, reaches my list of favorite IPAs. Definitely a beer I share with people wanting a good IPA to venture in deeper to beer tasting/enjoyment."
"D - Very refreshing but definitely an IPA to respect for flavor intensity and alcohol."
"Great beer from balast pt....not suprised!"
"Not a bad IPA"
"An agressive pour from a 22ozer produced a three finger head that lingered around for sometime. The nose is very clean and hoppy.Taste is a little deeper then the nose with a bitter end. The mouth is full and coats the tongue well. If you like IPA, you'll love this baby!"
"D - This is an enjoyable IPA plenty of hops to satisfy hop heads but it still has some balance this is worth getting sometime"
"Overall, in a world of big-time hop bombs, this is very well made and a nice change."
"Beer is medium bodied and mildly sweet. Its mildly dry at the back end but overall highly drinkable. The bitterness in the back is mildly grainy but its quite a pleasing overall IPA. The pine wins in the hop race here. I'd have it again."
"Edit: Had it again on-tap, presumably fresh...not as offensive as the bottle taste, but to me still a very dull IPA. Just not getting much hop flavor here."
"Disappointing."
"Pours a hazy golden color with decent white head. Smells very hoppy with citrus notes. The taste is initially bitter-hoppy, followed by lots of citrus tastes. Very well-ballanced though. The mouthfeel is perfect for an IPA (almost perfect). The drinkability is VERY high."
"Not overly complex, and really not an ipa I want to drink a ton of but pretty damn tasty overall."
"Pours a beautiful rusty-amber color. Light head with limited lacing. Approach brings heavy hop flavor- wow. Good, rich mouthfeel that finishes very dry. Impressive bitter taste for a traditional IPA. Would purchase this again. Pros: Hop-head's dream Cons: Low flavor complexiity."
"Easy drinking. All elements are there. Terrific beer from these guys. One drawback. $14/6."
"Cheers."
"O: i like the hop character a lot, great floral/citrus resin, tastes fresh, rather vegetative, rougher with wamrth"
"Drinkability - Quite enjoyable and easy drinking for a beer with this flavor profile."
"D: This a very good ipa. Perfect amount of carbonation and a great taste all the way through."
"Always nice to see west coast IPAs available north of the border - especially from the San Diego environs, as Stone and Green Flash have whet my appetite for IPAs from that region. Ballast Point's effort doesn't disappoint - a good balance of the basics - and the hop tendencies allow the exclusive use of Centennial to shine through. Good stuff - I get the point!"
"A tad pricey, but not outlandish."
"I know if I were to find this on the shelves of an Oklahoma beer store it would probably rate an ""A". But being surrounded by the best IPAs and DIPAs in the world here in Southern Cal for last few weeks this one merely rates as really good."
"Overall, it's an enjoyable beer. The aroma seems a little sketchy to me & the taste a little too medicinal. Other than that, it's a solid IPA. Depending on the price of admission, I'd likely be inclined to go with Sculpin over Big Eye. I'm glad I got to try it."
"Pours an amberish color with a white foam head. The aroma of citrus and pine are very apparent. The taste just confirms the smell. Citrus notes and pine come throught the forefront. There is a slight bitternes at the end that might put off some people, but not me. Overall, a pretty good IPA!"
"Poured a hazy golden color with a small off white head. Aroma is super fucking floral. Flavor is the same. Super florally hoppy. This is fairly close to a standard ipa but there is a certain flavor i can't peg down. This is super fresh and refreshing though. Feel is tingly as fuck from the carbonation."
"It leaves the mouth with a creamy, malty butter. It's full of spice with a kind of musky earth to it and a hint of minty grass. Meanwhile, the bite and citrus from the hop lingers. All in all a very enjoyable brew. It's subtle, bright and balanced, with a weight and feel in the mouth that's bold enough to take it seriously without being too heavy to quaff down."
"D: One of the first IPAs I had back when I got into beer, and to be honest, it's a little better than I had remembered. Not my favorite by any means, but it's still a good beer."
"Nothing extraordinairy here. Just a good, solid west coast IPA (light sweet malt is well balanced by the hoppy bitterness, making for a very dry IPA). Carbonation was surprisingly lively I thought for a beer from a firkin. Cask conditioning didn't hurt this IPA at all."
"The palate opens big and hoppy with a moderate bitterness and LOTS of hop flavor. Plenty of tropical fruit with the Simcoe overpowering the strong floral and citrus hop character.The palate is medium--light and while the carbonation is low, it also feels a little too smooth and slick. Drying and hoppy on the finish, this is very nice."
"D: Very enjoyable IPA however i fear this one would drop off if any less than fresh which is why i feel lucky to have drank it from a growler"
"Drinkability- very nice, I like it. I was impressed. I will end up drinking it again and recommending it at work."
"For a company that produces two IPA's, this may be the lesser of the two, but that doesn't take anything away from it. While it doesn't have the various fruit flavors Sculpin does, it is still a great representative of the style and with year round availability, it is a great find."
"Pours a cloudy orange with thick white head and lacing. Smells very lemony, which is a bit odd for an IPA, yet not a bad smell. Taste is almost as sour as it is bitter, with the lemon being very up front. Still tasty though. Not sure that I'd want many in a row. I had this at a good beer bar, so I don't think that the lines weren't cleaned or the keg was old."
"Had on tap at the Ballast Point taproom in San Diego. Pours a clear golden yellow with a small head that remains for the pour. Nose is milder pine and grapefruit, and the taste is more of the same but cranked up a bit in intensity. Some hop bitterness on the sides and a pretty dry finish."
"Pours a clear copper color with a huge dense cream colored head that slowly settles into a solid cap leaving some webby lacing on the glass. Big citrus hop aroma, strong on the grapefruit, it also has a fresh buddy hop aroma as well. Not much malt big up due to the strong hop presence. Grapefruit flavors start things off, followed by tropical fruit notes, mainly pineapple. A bit of pine in the end. There is a sweet candied honey undercurrent that goes along with a bready malt. Overall big beer for the style. The feel is quite thick with soft carbonation so it feels heavier than it actually is. It is quite sweet but is overcome with the hoppy bitterness. Definitely on the heavier end of the AIPA spectrum, body almost feels like a DIPA."
"D - very refreshing. Goes down easy. Great for a hot summer day."
"overall - nice IPA that isn't too bitter. Sculpin' is way better though."
"I'm a pretty big fan of this. Ballast Point pales have yet to disappoint. You should surely try this if you're into hops and haven't yet. And if you have, you should buy more."
"Luckily I like grapefruit juice too, and as grapefruit juices go, this was quite excellent -- lots of bitter, not too sweet. It was quite a refreshing glass. But as a beer, even as an american IPA, it's downright weird, and could do with at least a little more subtlety and balance."
"overall: very tasty solid IPA I have enjoyed this for many years it was my 2nd IPA I ever tasted and still a good one!"
"D- Lighter bodied IPA that is crisp and offers that nice bite but doesn't kill the palate and allows for multiple beers to be drank."
"D: The beer is very drinkable if you like hops; it almost seems like it is a Double IPA."
"A very nice IPA, with a lot of character. I feel the nose is its best feature, and it ends up slightly too astringent on the palate, leaving it feeling slightly unbalanced. But these are minor nits - it's a fine beer, and one I would be very happy to drink regularly."
"It's no sculpin, but another great IPA."
"A bit high on the carbonation as it pours, but letting it sit for a little while and it smooths out nicely. A great example of a PNW IPA."
"D: Tops, I love this beer."
"Drinkability: A really beautifully balanced IPA that takes citrus hop flavours to a whole new level. This is an absolute delight."
"Excellent IPA. Fresher is always better, but the bottle was very good also. This growler is definitely smoother. Taste is a bit better due to the balance of hops and malts. Great quality and I almost prefer the taste of the Big Eye to the Sculpin. I'll need to try them side by side to determine my preference. This might be a while since both may never be on tap at the same time :( At least in this area!"
"D - Strong bitterness, great malt profile, yep this is exactly what I like in an IPA. This is great, I could easily have a few pints of this delicious brew. I'll probably be buying this one again, recommended. Cheers!"
"Overall, this IPA is great. I love IPAs that don't leave malt behind for the sake of the style."
"Feel/Drink: Nice medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability is right on!"
"One of the fruitier and maltier IPAs I can remember having, but a success IMHO. Finished just as good as it started and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Due to the lack of the hoppiness in this brew, it paves the way for you to carry a six pack into a party and want to keep it all to yourself. Crisp and refreshing with a clean feeling left in the mouth."
"Easy to drink with a good hop presence. Nice mix of pine and grapefruit citrus flavor. The toffee flavored malts help balance the bitterness without dominating the taste."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is an excellent IPA, but as the IPA competition continues to ramp up so do expectations. This beer while very good did not particularly stand out to me. Not a slam.. just an observation."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy and smooth."
"Bright but mellow on the palate with soft, fluffy carbonation that helps to accentuate the sweetness and indirectly provide balance. The carbonation level also helps the drinkability in my opinion despite the ABV; if it was a bit more crisp it would most likely create a more 'tongue splitting' and aggressive bitterness that would most likely decrease the drinkability."
"Another quality brew from the empire beer exchange!"
"The contrast between smell & taste is a little bit of a letdown: starts crisp & turns sweet & on the heavy side. Not my favorite balance in an IPA. Not bad, just not my fave."
"D: A great drinker."
"a delicate light orange beautiful pour and immediately i am assaulted by the fruit trees of california: tangerines and grapefruits and a little bit of floweriness. its a bit sweet to the touch but quickly the hops roll forth, firing off rounds of grapefruit, orange and a bit of pineapple, eventually revealing some floral hint off the backside. amazingly well held up under the stress of travel - a delightful treat from some great brewers down in san diego."
"4/4.5/4/4/4"
"I would never turn one of these down, and I'm glad to have tried it, but I won't be trading for this again. It isn't bad, by any means, and I could understand what they were going fir and why poeple might like it... But thus just isn't my favorite take on the style."
"D: at 6% this is a drinkable ipa, bomber won't be an issue."
"Hopheads delight, not exactly my M.O., but appreciated nonetheless. Pretty one dimensional and unbalanced, but this beer still finds a way to taste pretty good. Definitely reflects the west coast-styled IPA"
"D - very solid IPA, excellent display of fruity hop flavors but somewhat one dimensional at the same time. i can see non-hop heads liking this one and big time hop addicts getting bored due to lack of much bitterness. easily drinkable and overall solid beer."
"Overall this was a little disappointing and I am not sure if perhaps this is just an old bottle, no dust was found on it, nor was there any dating (that I could find at least) Not a bad, Sculpin is a completely different beast entirely. Worth a look."
"D - A highly enjoyable IPA sip after sip... Ballast Point continues to impress... I would gladly welcome in the future and recommend to others... Excellent balance and subtle complexity are the highlights of this offering..."
"Drinkability: I would like to try this one again when it's a bit fresher, I have a feeling the hops will be a bit more pronounced. Still, this is a tasty IPA and if you haven't had the chance to try it I recommend that you do."
"Overall I wasn't really impressed with this. While I really like Ballast Point, this just didn't hit the mark for me."
"Pours a nice golden color with a decent-sized head. Some lacing as it goes down. The nose is mostly citrus hops with some orange coming through the strongest. A bit of sweet caramel malt. Taste is similar, with the hops being the dominant portion, as the malt brings only a little bit behind. Medium bodied with good carbonation ad a nice hop dryness. Good drinkability all around."
"My hesitancy is dispelled by the aroma - this has an effervescent candy-malted smell with sharp hop highlights. It's not a slug in the face, but a very refined aroma that hints at the complexity to come. The taste is satisfyingly rich. It isn't the hoppiest IPA, despite the ""intense"" claims on the (beautifully designed) label. The perfectly judged carbonation lets solid, buttery malt rest on your tongue, while the hops claw their way through the roof of your mouth and into your brain. This pint reminds me of a well produced electronica track - each element is isolated in the mix and presented with clarity - you can literally decide which taste to focus on explore it apart from the others. Behind the main flavours, a salty tang drones. The finish is just right, malts and hops subside at an equal rate so that the beer just fades away, Keyser Soze style ""and like that...he's gone"""
"This is a pretty great IPA, balance and drinkability matched only by a few that I've had; Sierra Nevada Celebration comes to mind. This is a bit less assertive than Celebration, but very easy to put down. Will definitely pick this up again."
"D - I just have 12 oz. to work with, but I definitely wish it were 24. The citrus notes and finishing bitterness keep me coming back. The incredible orange-ness that the beer has is unique and delicious, though at the same time does keep drinkability from being a little higher."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Smooth. Great hop flavor and a nice lasting bitterness."
"d- very drinkable, great ipa, drink this all night"
"A bigger, richer IPA, which has a more amber to caramel malt. The hops are very piney and hit you in the mid palette and carry on through for a long finish. The nose is not very big, the beer is a bit sweeter than many other West Coast IPA's and I find there to be a bit of a soapy character. This could also be attributed as a higher carbonation level. The earthy, pine cone like hop profile is interesting, and quite different from the usually citrus driven hop profiles."
"D. This is a highly drinkable beer for the evolved beer drinker. One who has a well developed palate can easily consume a six pack. Alcohol was very well hidden"
"Tried other beers from this company and they haven't disappointed yet!."
"D: A highly drinkable beer and I'm really impressed by the control of the hoppiness in this IPA. Not a terribly balanced beer likes its big brother Sculpin, but this one holds its own."
"i would buy it again but first impressions arent everything with this beer"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, not as easy as some IPA's but this one seems to be approaching the borderline of a DIPA which might make it slightly less drinkable then other less alcohol IPA's. Still a very good beer though."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep burnt orange color with tight formed but rather quick to fade one finger white head.Good complexity in the nose,citric hop aromas along with some alcohol dipped apricot, mixed with some hard water and caramel/biscuit.Pretty well balanced with the healthy hop dose winning the day,big citrus and resin mixed with a big hefty sweetish caramle base.Its good but not out of the main stream American IPA realm,thats not a bad thing by any means,just sayin."
"Very good beer. Anyone who likes hops, will like this."
"Poured a brownish red body with good head and lace patches around the glass. A great citric/piney hop smell along with hints of caramel and sweet malt. Smooth, creamy, medium body with a citric hoppiness that is a little spicy and bitter that goes down easy. Balances with some toffee/roasted and sweet malt for an enjoyable IPA that finishes smooth and at 7% ABV is a little deceptive. I could have this any time."
"D: Great. I could session this guy real easy."
"Very good ipa with a little more alcohol than a typical ipa but less than a double. Great golden/amber color, excellent carbonation and light colored head. very memorable and enhance aroma. Had this at a bar on the east coast (Amsterdam Ale House on the upper west side) and will continue to have this as long as it's available."
"12oz bottle. Clear golden amber with a smallish head. Really nice floral, nectar, mango and tangarine like aroma. About as good as hops can smell. The mango becomes more prominent as it breathes, and it's uncannily awesome. The flavor carries over many of the floral hoppy qualities and sits them over a simple, yet very clean malt sweetness. On the sweeter, maltier side, but not sugary and sticky like some sweeter IPAs can get. Finishes with a firm but integrated bitterness that is well rounded with the other flavors, leaving a lingering mango-grapefruit taste on the tongue. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Definitely at the top of the heap for more balanced beers of the style. One of the best examples of hop aroma that I've encountered."
"Taste is very hoppy and sweet lots of nice citrus and floral notes. It's really a good ipa it's not too sweet but there is a nice sweet and rich finish."
"d- really great, i've been wanting to try this for awhile and got a bottle in my secret santa, it was worth the wait, definately an above average ipa that i would seek more of for sure, if this is any hint as to what sculpin is gonna be i'm in for a treat, i've got a bottle cooling in the fridge!"
"Pours from the bottle to a hazy golden-orange color with thick white head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing. From the start, the nose is a pleasant hoppy citrus (mostlyu grapefruit and lemons), and the mouthfeel full and tangy. Taste accentuates the citrusy hops of the nose, and the finish is slightly dry and bitter, as I would expect. A darn good beer from a brewer we can't get much from in Atlanta."
"Overall a competitve offering here. Mouthfeel was a bit of a head scratcher, but regardless was a smooth drink"
"D: Mixed feelings. I love the malt profile shown here; I feel it accentuates the hop profile without undercutting it. But the finish is a tad too astringent for me. I don't think this is a bad IPA by any means, but these guys can do better. For the price, though, this will probably replace El Toro IPA as my go-to beer, if they start dating bottles."
"D - A little heavy and definitely a little intense. I doubt I could handle more than one at a time. Big Eye IPA definitely walks an interesting line between IPA and DIPA with much focus on the hops. A great beer to be sure, probably a must-have in a market saturated with medicore IPAs."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is officially my new staple beer that I will have in the fridge at all times. Highly recommended!"
"D - Average drinkability but decent enough for IPA."
"I could drink these all day. For the price, I could afford to. Nice solid offering from Ballast Point!"
"The mouthfeel is great. Very creamy and has just the right amount of carbonation. I could drink a bunch of these beers. Quite tasty."
"D - Fairly drinkable, though not as much balance as I prefer."
"D: Delicious but on the heavier side of a medium-bodied IPA. Very bitter, a very well made IPA. Lots of flavor as it slowly warms, but sometimes the bitter bite takes away from it at tad. Need to find it's perfect serving temperature. Recommend, a must for all HopHeads!!"
"D-its pretty well balanced for an IPA, which I actually don't like. I want a full on hop assault with an IPA, save the balancing act for other styles."
"Pours a peach amber color with an off-white head. Decent lacing. Aroma seems muted, but juicy fruit gum comes to mind. Hops and malts seem balanced, so we'll see what happens when I taste it...ah, the hops come forward, sending a wave of bitterness over the tongue. I'd expect no less from a west coast ipa. The malts don't really stand up, and citrusy flavors from the hops don't really pop. This medium bodied beer has an oily mouthfeel, and is easy to drink. Fine for an IPA fix, but I'd probably skip over this one next time in hopes for a more well-rounded flavor."
"Drinkability - Pretty quaffable. The more you drink the less of the bitterness you notice and the more flavorful it becomes. I wish I could have done a side by side when I had Sculpin a few weeks ago but overall this does not disappoint in the least."
"D - Couldn't have too many of these."
"D - keep em coming. I could drink a lot of these in one sitting."
"D - Price and smoothness make this one well getting again for future drinking."
"D: Unexpected flavors for an IPA, but its overall profiles are very strong. It was a little too sugary for my tastes, but the hops were in great balance. I think this one was a bit old, so I'm looking forward to trying it again sometime, hopefully on tap."
"As I settle into this beer the malt re-enters with a toffeeish flavor...all in all a nice IPA..as I finish it, it feels more english ipa than west coast"
"Pours a dark orange with a large, white head. The first smell is pine and citrus from the Centennial hops, but you can also smell some malt. The taste follows the smell, but is considerably more balanced. While this is certainly a hoppy beer, the malt is right there neck and neck with the hops. This is much less hoppy than some other West Coast IPAs, but I think that makes it more drinkable. This is easily a beer I could see myself having several of."
"M/D: i really enjoy this ipa and in a cluttered category it does a good job of being different while not being too different"
"Nice dark gold colour with monster head ( almost too much head). Hops on the nose but this not a hop monster ( ie. this is less hoppy than Green Flash's IPA) but rather a balanced West Coast IPA that has a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel is on the thick side but suits the beer. I could drink a few of these and not find it overly bitter. Nice drinking IPA with enough hops to keep it interesting"
"I do enjoy this beer, a nice break from Sculpin and Dorado which are much more hop forward."
"D: Goes quite fast, a few sips and the whole glass is nearly gone. Glad that I have more than one of these."
"Paired with a spicy, meaty stew, this beer cut through all the strong flavors of the stew and then some. Might be a bit too aggressive whenst consumed all by itself? Still worth a look."
"Drinkability is excellent. Too excellent. This is a strong beer and is dangerously delicious. Wnjoy with this in mind!"
"Drinkability is off the charts. Given enough of a supply, I could enjoy this without pause until global warming makes my ridgetop home into beachfront property."
"pours a golden/orangish color with a fluffy almost orange tint 1 inch head. aroma is grapefruit, hoppy, pine as well. taste is a real nice bite, very good. has also citrus/piney floral notes. the bitterness stays around for a while. than i get another taste that doen't really go away. it is somewhat of a metallic taste and i do not like it. maybe i got a bad bottle, but will try again."
"D: One of the more drinkable DIPA's I've had, but still pretty heavy duty stuff"
"Final thoughts: This is a great IPA IMO. It starts with a great malt character thats not too malty or light, then hop flavor starts off as the malt fades and then finishes with a nice bitterness. It is a little too sweet if anything, but being 7% alc and hiding it well also helps. Not being overly bitter or hopped and not too high on the alcohol makes this a more likely candidate for drinking regularly than most big time IPAs. I like to reach for this when I just want a nice bitter and slightly malty IPA without breaking the bank, my tongue/taste buds, or my liver."
"The beer opens up with big Centennial grapefruit notes, as well as some orange and pine. Strong caramel notes are evident, and while the malt doesn't balance out the high moderate bitterness, it does provide a welcome sugary sweetness, a temporary respite from the hops. The 7% is well hidden. The finish is bitter, crisp, and dry, with a touch of sweetness. This is wrecking my palate for a single IPA. Great stuff."
"Drinkability: Pretty dang high - a great beer that I could enjoy year round but I'm sure I would prefer moreso in the warmer summer months. I really love the juicy flavors and the smell is great and compliments and adds to it all the more. Easily one of the more solid IPAs out there in a world that's very full of them."
"I picked up this 650ml bottle from Friar Tucks in Peoria a few weeks ago. The opening act for this beer (Boulevard Double Wide) was miserable and left me hoping for the best. Thankfully Ballast steps up when needed. The beer is chill hazed, light copper colored, with a thin foam that laces in thin rings. The aroma is well balanced between malts and hops, more than I'd like as a hophead. Kind of a light citrus style of hops, lemon and orange more than grapefruit, very nice. The taste is sweet to begin with, it seems to me that the sweetness comes from malts but still is appreciated. Delicious hops citrus flavors in the middle and a mild bitterness in the aftertaste. I'd say that the aftertaste leaves a lot of flavors, a little pine resin and toffee, again a strong balance of malts and hops. I found the body to be mildly carbonated, giving a soft mouthfeel that matches IPA's well. Overall well done, maybe a little too balanced but it could be that the hops faded with time or something. Very nice IPA."
"This is a very tasty and drinkable IPA. It would be great out of a cask, possibly with more hops added to the barrel."
"notes taken from my IPod, 9/14/09"
"D - Good. Bittering hops in mouthfeel was a bit much."
"nice, representative IPA: mega-hopster with a decent malt backbone (a tough on the light side, but this perhaps is a function of beers with a hop schedule like this typically being a little more robust)"
"D: A rock solid West Coast IPA, really well put together (you can taste the San Diego influence). A very impressive first offering from Ballast Point, I can see we're gonna be good friends and I'm excited for some more offerings. The hops were just a pinch too much for the malt or else the balance would've been superb. If you're looking for a prototypical West Coast IPA, this is for you."
"Pours a rusty amber color. Slightly hazy, but mostly clear---looks like a West Coast IPA, though darker than some (like Stone IPA for example). Small but long-lasting head, great lacing remaining on the side. Perfect ""West Coast"" citrusy aroma like you'd expect, but not extreme like some. Full of hop flavor without high bitterness, moderate malt backbone; the hops seem to dominate the taste buds here. Medium mouthfeel due to the very moderate malt character and 6.0% ABV. Extremely high drinkability; it would be easy to session the Big Eye IPA because it's so delicious, but at the same time isn't too bitter on the palate and has an alcohol level which is lower than most in its IPA class."
"Poured into an American pint glass. Nice orange/amber hue, with a good head. The nose was very citrusy but also had malty sweetness which hinted at good balance. This was certainly the case with the flavor; not an overpoweringly flavorful beer, but very very balanced from start to finish, between citrus/malt/hoppiness. The feel was moderately carbonated, but a little thin for an IPA. Very good session beer."
"The balance and the smooth mouthfeel make this beer very easy to drink."
"No date on the bottle so there's no way to tell how fresh it is. If I go by the taste alone, I would say it was bottled in the past 3 months. So much for satisfying my jones for sculpin - this beer just made me want it more."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, yet somewhat dry. Very drinkable. The abv is relatively low for the style, making it nice to enjoy a few."
"12oz. Poured bright copper-amber with a slight haze and was topped with a fairly thin, foamy, off-white head that left some sticky lacing on the glass. Aromas were of floral and citric hop with a hearty malt bill. Tastes were similar to other Ballast Point offerings - especially the biscuity malt character. Sweet up-front followed by juicy citric hop, mainly grapefruit, with plenty of piny bitterness and spiciness on the finish. Mouth-feel was medium bodied and the hop oils coat the palate well along with ample carbonation. Another well-rounded, well-balanced ale from Ballast Point!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not good enough to be in my top 5 hoppy beers, but darn good none the less. Reminds me a bit of Loose Canon."
"Hard to beat this one for the price, I will definitely be keeping this one as a steady holder in my rotation of IPA's"
"Overall a very solid hoppy IPA."
"drinkability is good. very fresh and wonderfully hopped with a great finish and piney profile. solid on the palate. cheers!"
"This poured a slightly hazy dark gold with a little off-white head. It smelled like fresh oranges and grapefruit, with honey and light caramel malt. It tasted like grapefruit, with oranges and some pineapple and copper, balanced with sweet caramel malt. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice IPA with great flavors. It wasn't quite as succulent or clean enough to be top tier (e.g. Sculpin), but it wasn't far off either. It had a nice body and was plenty easy to drink. This could make for a solid staple IPA."
"Drinkability: Really pretty high. Very solid, fully-flavorful IPA with pleasantly low ABV."
"A good beer, definitely hop forward with just enough malt backbone to counter the hops. That said, i kind of got tired of the centennial hops in this beer, really hits you over the head with the fruitiness. I appreciate the effort, just not my type of IPA."
"Picked this one up at Friar Tuck Beverage in Springfield, IL. Pours a hazy orange color with an off white 2 finger foamy head which leaves a nice sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is of citrus hops, orange and grapefruit. The flavor matches the aroma. The taste is bitter, but there is more sweetness than I expected. There is a nice malt backbone. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and good drinkability. I would buy this again if it were available in Minnesota."
"I drink different kinds of IPAs all the time, to the point that they all run together. But the Big Eye stands out. Bronze or copper with great foam and awesome sticky lacing. The aromas consists of juicy citrus hops. The taste is better though with an awesome balance that still allows the hop bitterness to be the headliner. Sweet, but hoppy. Smooth, but sticky. Great beer, I wish it was more readily available in my area."
"Pours a clear copper color with very little head. There are immediate grassy and fruity hops aromas. Tasted a very fruity and sweet hops flavor which I associate with heavy dry-hopping. Hop character even borders on tart, without much bitterness either in the sip or the aftertaste. Despite the intesnity of the aroma, the flavor is much lighter. Body is medium. Taste fades quickly toa bright and light aftertaste. Head dissipates, leaving little lace. Nice IPA."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for around $2. Poured into my nonic pint glass. Big Eye appears a hazed medium amber color with about an inch of fluffy bone white head. Aromas and flavors consist of tons of citrus fruits such as orange and grapefruit, just about the right amount of caramelized malt, floral hops, some resinous pine as well. The IPA is a notch or two better than medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Damn my glass was empty rather quickly! Perfect drinkability and yes, it's better than Sculpin."
"Dry finish, medium-body. I don't like the tartness, whether it's an 'off' flavor or intentional. Otherwise, this beer'd be an 'A.'"
"The carbonation is a bit low but any more would enhance the bitterness already as is. Some astringency from the hops. Overall a good west coast ipa but just slightly off balanced. Would like more finishing and less of the bittering."
"- Not too bad... love the Dorado much better now as I write this review...."
"I don't think I appreciate the separation of flavors that some IPA's such as this have. I am all for complexity, however this beer smells and tastes like sweet caramel, mixed with dried biscuits- and then almost immeadiately kills this flavor with an attempt at creating an IPA with only Centennial Hops. Not all that impressed for the most part. However, I did raise my scores a bit as I realize this is partially a preferance within a style."
"Pours medium amber into my tulip with a fingers worth of white head that disappears after about a minute and leaves fine lacing. Smells of bright citrusy hops with a nice sweetness in the rear. The first sip reveals a very well-hopped brew, with more pine notes shining through than citrus. A pleasant hint of alcohol comes towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with adequate carbonation that lends to the drinkablitlity of this nice offering."
"Drinkability: Slows a bit on the finish due to the thick and resiny nature but still very drinkable. I really liked this beer, more than I was expecting I would. I have the Sculpin from BP in my fridge too and if that's much better than this (which all indications are that it is supposed to be) I'm really in for a treat. Solid beer, tasty from start to finish, and a great example of a San Diego IPA."
"For such a hoppy beer, not as much bitterness as other big IPAs, lots of late additions of centennial hops without a lot(an excessive ammount) of early boiling hops. Malts are tasty and balanced for its purpose: to showcase the centennial hops. Which it does to great effect. This is one Big Orange hoppy IPA. Very drinkable and delicious. I could drink this one for breakfast..."
"D: The over the top bitterness that was around in the beginning seems to calm down as the session progresses. Once that diminishes the beer starts to disappear quickly."
"D - It's not the best IPA I have had but eminently drinkable"
"D: What a fantastic and refreshing IPA. HeatherAnn and I stumbled upon some Ballast Point stuff at a liquor store on the IL side of the Mississippi River by Dubuque, IA and we're very impressed by what we tried. Too bad we have to go so far to get it!"
"Great mouthfeel ... medium carbonation. A fantastic ale all-around. I would not have identified this as an IPA, and I think that speaks positively to this brew."
"I think that the drinkability is good for an IPA. This is probably a better beer fresh from the tap but an average bottled IPA to me, not my favorite Ballast Point"
"Drinkability: Not hard to kick back because of the thin mouthfeel but the flavor isn't that enjoyable."
"The taste mirrors the aroma nicely, with a slightly more aggressive palate of raw hop cones drizzled with pine resin. Loads of citrus fruits, too, as well as some yeasty esters of mango and pineapple. A crisp, caramel malt backbone balances perfectly with the hoppiness. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, with a spot-on carbonation level that gives the semi-chewy, medium body some pep to the finish. Big Eye is the epitome of a West Coast IPA--heavy on the hops, but with enough malt balance, and ever so drinkable. A superb beer!"
"D - Until I took a sip of this one I thought it was going to be average...this is a great IPA...big on the pine...I'm looking forward to trying Sculpin or Dorado Double"
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to RodBurg for the opportunity!"
"Overall a tasty and quaffable IPA."
"Drain pour."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye=Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min=AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"D- Not a traditional 'hopbomb' but well balanced with a nice flavor. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability is ok. The bit of astringency in there is a drawback for me, but overall a nice IPA."
"This is one great beer. I can drink this beer all throughout the summer. Great find and recommended. Reminds me kind of Alpha King from Three Floyds."
"All I have to say is tang. Hoppy sour apple tang. Does make the work day go by though. Head, smell, color is all normal. I'm almost wondering if I left some 3-day old coffee in the bottom of my mug."
"Overall Impression - First, I love centennial hops so I was very excited to try this beer. The aroma is great! In my opinion one of the best in its style. The beer visualy presented itself well. I would say the only thing that hurts this beer for me is that I would like to have seen it slightly more dry. It's just a bit on the sweet side for what I like in an IPA. I will say that it is better than a number of other IPA's that I can think of, and if it was distributed around where I live I would buy it again."
"A very decent IPA. Pours nice, great color, nice initial head and it stays pretty well. Citrus kick but not grapefruit, more like orange/ tangerine which is also very nice, very similar to Two Hearted, but not quite as full flavored. It;s also a little pricey. Over all a very nice IPA that I would love to drink if someone else is buying, for my money I'll stick to 2H."
"Tastes like grapefruit juice cut with some piney hop bitterness. A ton of citrus and no real noticeable malt notes to be found. The mouth feel is great, not at all syrupy and a very balanced amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty huge on this one, low ABV and tasty to boot. Crisp and hugely refreshing."
"On guest tap at Willimantic Brewing. Pours a clear amber/brown with a small white head. Aroma of resiny hops, grassy hops, and citrus. Flavor is fairly malty with lots of bitter resiny hops in the finish and some iced tea notes. Decent, but not great."
"Color me disappointed. Too much malt, too much bitterness, not enough balance for me. Just not a great beer. Seems to be lacking a lot of complexity. I'll have to wait and see if Ballast Point has something better to offer."
"A good beer all in all. Wish i could try it fresh afraid the hops are a little faded."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a medium tan foamy head.The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing.The smell is pungent with citrus hops and a very strong ""bisquity"" aroma. The taste, like the smell,has citrus hops,bread yeast,carmel,and hop bitterness.The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. Like all the other Ballast Point beers I've tried, this IPA should not be passed up."
"I'll be back.."
"Drinkability - I was pleasantly surprised at that depth of this ipa. Even though it was bursting with flavor it seemed just a touch off in some places. Still a great ipa for sure."
"D- This is a great session beer. Ballast Point makes some killer IPA's and this one doesnt disappoint."
"To be honest I didn't know what to think when I got this bottle. I am glad I cracked it open though. I should have realized that you can't really go wrong when you are drinking a west coast IPA."
"Got as an extra from a real sporty San Diego BA. 7% ABV listed on label. Clearish orange in appearance with a solid two fingers of cream colored froth. Aroma of sweet, tangy grapefruit. Floral and lemony at first, with a nice bitter middle. Mouthfeel chalky hopped, nice peppery bitterness. Feel this one in the teeth. Wheat-thin maltiness. Great webbed lacing in the glass. Very drinkable...would love a keg of this."
"Overall this is a solid IPA from Ballast Point. It's not terribly unlike SN's Torpedo. Worth a shot."
"D: A bit too intense. The hop bitterness annihilates whatever other flavors might be in this one."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent amber with a half inch frothy, off-white head - good retention and cascading strands of lacing. Nose reveals some malt and piny hops. Taste was bitter and resinous with a medicinal finish; however, there's also a hint of citrus and a malty/biscuity quality that seems to form the backbone. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied; carbonation is really prickly throughout, with a slight, residual oiliness that coats the tongue. I'm sure this brew has the makings of what a very good American IPA should taste like; however, it's a bit too bitter for my liking."
"a good IPA overall, easy to drink, slightly more bitter so probably after a few i would want something else. a decent IPA and that has a flavor of its own."
"Poured into snifter lightly chilled produced a decent head over dark gold color. The nose of this beer is fantastic with full floral and hop sweetness which certainly hightens the flavor which again is hop and floral though with a lemon/citrus middle and only slightly bitter dryness on the finish. Mouthfeel was good and certainly this is a very drinkable beer."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip a hazy orange with a nice off-white head. Aroma is some slight sweet malts and citrus hops. The taste is a decent amount of bitter citrus hops with sweet malts backing it up. The beer is light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable IPA to say the least, but there's really nothing all that special about it."
"This is one of the more tastier IPA's i've had in a while. Being my first example from Ballast Point i'm impressed and am looking forward to trying more from said brewery."
"D- I wish I picked up a few bottles as this one tasted fresh. While some american IPA's could tire after a few, I could drink a bunch of this as the alcohol is not too high. I've had Sculpin and then having this I can see where Ballast Point get's it's inspiration from and that is citrus."
"Ballast Point's got a pretty solid IPA with Big Eye. One thing's for sure, those guys at BP know how to brew extremely citrusy IPAs. Big Eye and Sculpin are easily two of the most citrus intense IPAs that have ever crossed this palate. Big Eye is good, but Sculpin is far superior. This one's way overcarbonated and isn't quite as appealing in the hop department. At least that's my take. But, it's more than a solid release and is well worth a purchase."
"D: This is the third or fourth time I've brought this home. Definitely add this to my rotation when I can get it. Overall, a delightful IPA."
"Flavor comes across fine. Some acidity on the finish. Nice flavor from the hops. Very light toasty, toffee-like flavors of the malted barley (per the label description)."
"I'd prefer a little drier and crisper in the finish, and with a more subtle alcohol impact. Otherwise the beer hit the marks on good IPA's."
"Drinkability is affected a little by the sheer strength of this delicious ale. Can't drink a lot of these in a session. 3-4 is an enjoyable number for me at home."
"Despite the mellow pour, the body is nicely carbonated and the experience is enjoyable. Almost a sessionable IPA. I recommend it."
"The bottle does not lie, this is an intensely hopped brew, certainly one for the hop head, but the balance is just enough for all to enjoy."
"Tasty, would definitely get this again."
"D: A very good tasty beer, I would gladly have this again."
"Drinkability is excellent, almost too good for 7% ABV as shown on my bottle (although I have had 6% ABV bottles previously). Highly recommended, especially for hopheads."
"D-A well balanced but still hop forward ipa. This one is well done and easy to drink. One that I would have at hand all the time as a go to beer."
"D - A touch resiny compared to my favorites in the style but it still makes for a tasty bold, nicely balanced ipa."
"This is a damn good IPA and a satisfying introduction to Ballast Point. Now I just need to find the Sculpin..."
"Nonetheless, I can say this is a very unique beer and may impress some. It's really not my style, though, and I love American IPAs. I've heard good things about their Sculpin and can't wait to try it. This one is really out there, though."
"If you're an IPA fan then you really need to check this one out. One of the better bang for the bucks."
"Nice IPA that could use more balance to raise the drinkability."
"The good news about this beer is that there is a very bready middle to the beer that balances well with the very acerbic and biting hop. That's the high point. On the other hand, the hops are extremely bittering, acerbic and tart, slighly grapefruity, but they linger way too far in to the aftertaste. The beer does look good with a lightish clear coppery color with a decent white head, some lacing and retention. The nose on the beer is nice pungent estery and oily hop, with some florals hidden underneath. The taste of the beer doesn't bring out the hoppy florals nearly enough, but more like the bittering ends of the fruit. The beer is medium bodied, decently carbonated, and the plus, the big plus is the nice balance with the bready malts in the mid section. Not my favorite IPA by a long shot. The 7% ABV is well hidden. The hops will clear out the palate but will linger longer than is warranted."
"A nice, average example American IPA. Easy to drink example with no frills."
"I really enjoy this IPA, nice amber color with about 2 fingers of head, smell is nice; hops with citrus/pine. Taste is very grapefuity, but not too bitter, some malt to balance out the citrus. Not too watery or too oily, nice mouthfeel and great drinkability!"
"This brew pours our a clear copper color with a huge 2 finger head of rocky white foam. Nice head retention throughout with thick lacing. The nose is of citrus and floral hops followed with some bready malts. The taste has a healthy well mixed balance of hops, though not bitter. The finish is where you find the malts. I found this to be a very well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, on the lighter side of a medium body but not watery. This is certainly a beer worthy of sitting down with for an evening."
"very good."
"D - Bold and flavorful, Big Eye is a fantastic IPA that actually is meandering into DIPA territory, in my opinion. Ballast Point makes incredible hoppy beers, and this one is no exception."
"Enjoyed at the Irish Pol in Philadelphia. Excellent offering from the West Coast and consistent with big hop beers. If you are sampling beers, make this last. I sampled a Hopdevil and Double Bastard after a few of these and could not taste either one of those."
"I had this beer a while ago and thought that it tasted funny. With this tasting, I can proudly say that my previous assessment has stayed exactly the same. For what it's worth, this is a very well constructed beer. However, something about the taste did not agree with me. Others might feel differently though. I like IPAs as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I'd pick this up again."
"Fine froth of micro bubbles, so tiny that it's hard put to become strong lacing. Red amber color, more yellow around the rims, very aggressive bubbles beneath the surface, more a storm than beads. Hoppy nose with sour lemon and orange citrus zest, wheat, straw, tea leaf, some biscuit or barley, minimal caramel or toffee, pinch of cherry fruit, the nose actually shows a good deal of restraint and tactful length. Full-bodied, not overly dense but together the high level of carbonation plus its overall dryness increase its mouth presence a lot. Lemon, white grapefruit citrus adds more tartness. Here, though, the tea and tobacco leaf aspects sweeter. Touch of molasses helps add balance. Biscuity, bready ending, especially as it warms. Not bad but comes off as a bit one-dimensional."
"Not my first big eye...not my last for sure. Pours clean with wheatever head you want (depending on pour strength). Has that very clear burnt orange look to it, and smells like a nice citrus bomb. The taste reminds me of a lighter, more well done union jack. This beer is a classic session beer, and at under 4 bucks a bomb should not be passed up."
"Very crisp and light. Grainy texture and feel all through out. Nice aggressive citrus and pine hops. Still there though hop fading was present in the smell. Above average in here."
"This was enjoyable and perhaps I'll pick it up again some another day."
"Overall, a fine IPA. I got excited by the all Centennial, but this wasn't nearly as good as Two-Hearted. It is still solid."
"Poured dark gold-orangle color with great carbonationa nd a huge white head. LOOKED GREAT!aNose is floral bitter hops(hence Centennial). Taste is floral, hop bite and little citrus all the way through. I like single hop IPAs and this is a good one. Another really good one is Lengthwise Centennial Ale."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. First time trying. Pours a very nice copper with an inch head. Lacing begins early, head remains about half way through and forms a ring thereafter. Very floral and hoppy nose. I pick up citrus aromas very strongly. Taste is strikingly similar to a Stone IPA, which is a very good thing. Very well balanced IPA. This is the second offering I've tried from Ballast Point and so far I have not been disappointed. Hopheads should give this one a whirl. Very nice beer."
"This could be a ""go to"" American IPA if it were widely available. Very well done."
"Pours a clear golden amber color body with a huge foamy whitish head, big bubbles and good lacing. Piney citrusy aroma, lemon. Some bitter dryness. Hoppy bitter maltiness. Watery palate, a little bitter. Some biter maltiness. Goes okay with buffalo chicken."
"Not as big as other San Diego IPA's, but certainly the most sessionable. Amazingly, I can find this for as little as $6.99 a six-pack in my area. Next up, the search for Double Dorado."
"D= high. I wanna say thanks to kadonny for this one. Its great for someone who likes hops. The smell tricked me but the taste is amazing"
"Drinkability: I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice for an IPA. If I'm looking for a good hop blast then I might consider it."
"D-Makes me wish I could get this where I live it qould be in my fridge all the time"
"Drinkability: This beer had potential but ended up being very one dimensional. I felt like I was eating the hop pellets. More complexity would make it a charmer."
"Refreshing and creamy, together, is a good combo."
"This is a really fine example of a west coast IPA, one of the two or three best I've tasted."
"A very good beer full of big hop flavor, great aroma, high alcohol percentage. When I drink an IPA this is what want in a beer. It is very hooping has a nice bit to, and just enough sweetness but not too sweet to where it gets like syrupy. I also like that it has a abv of 7%, when I drink a beer I don't want to have to drink a whole 12 pack to get buzzed. So far I've had two and I've got a nice buzzed feeling. All in all if you're a fan of IPA's from CA and OR you'll probably like this one. For anyone who is a fan of Stone IPA or Lagunitas IPA then you'll like this too."
"Slightly hazed orange with a small, tightly creamy head. Smells like a couple handfulls of Centennial hops...Two-Hearted-esque. Fresh, juicy oranges, flowers, sugary malt, and some grassy dry-hop notes. Tons of juicy citrus flavor, peaches, pineapple, and toasty caramel malt. Rock solid body, hefty bitterness. Very nice IPA...I'll be back for more."
"Cheers"
"D: Drinkability is good. This one goes down very smooth and is very balanced. A very tasty IPA for sure."
"This beer pours a clear amber with no head and mild lacing. The smell is of citrusy and grassy hops. The taste has a very nice hop profile, but too much for the amount of malt in it, a little unbalanced in my opinion. The mouthfeel is ok, carbonation is a little low and there is a pretty distinct dry feeling after swallow. Ok on the drinkablility, but I would prefer something a little better balanced to session with."
"The drink is medium-bodied with nice carbonation and is highly drinkable. I hate to say it, but I think Wolfie *might* know what he's talking about!(well, this one time, anyway)"
"So drinkable. I wish I had more. A top notch IPA from the folks at Ballast Point."
"Pours cloudy orange with a very thin, soapy head. Strong, grassy hops pours from the bottle on opening and the glass on the pour. Super big hop bitterness punch. The Ratebeer profile says 55 IBUs but it tastes waaayyyy stronger which leads me to doubt that measurement. Strong, unbalanced hop flavor, fabulous for hop heads. A must try for IPA fans."
"mouth is oily and smooth, goes down easy and is very easy to drink. definitely one of the best standard IPAs."
"Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells. Still pretty good, though. The hops are huge and dominate the malt, soapy and citrusy. The end is big bread and biscuit malts, with a pleasantly soapy hop aftertaste."
"Much better than the Yellowtail. Pours clear orange with a white, fluffy head. Aroma is all hops and grapefruit, with the advertised malt. Taste is very hoppy, more citrus than pine, but with a sweeter bitterness. Mellower than expected for a San Diego product. It tastes like someone added malt to the Stone IPA."
"drinkability: high"
"Very glad that I got to try this west coast IPA."
"pours a very clear amber color with a thick white head. has a citrus type smell and grass. leaves a nice lacing on the glass. very light in the mouth and easy drinking. first time i bought this brew i was not a big fan but that has changed. i find it to be very good and I will certainly be buying again. wonder how the double ipa is?? hopefully i can find it locally."
"wow, 271 reviews as of this writing. A great looking crystal clear golden amber colored beer with a huge billowy white heat. aroma and taste are an ode to the centennial hop. Yup, I can see this as a hop head's go to beer. A refreshingly crisp IPA and nicely only 6% ABV."
"Notes from 2/23/05"
"Perfect amount of bitterness and sweetness in the finish. Medium bodied and quite sticky. Lingers about the palate and tongue for quite a while. A thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable beer. Glad I found this one."
"Feel is great for a AIPA, dense and intense but heavy carbonation makes it very refreshing and drinkable."
"I'll be the first to admit I'm a little biased here. This was the first IPA I ever had and it's the brew that got me hooked on hops. I don't even think I knew what hops were supposed to taste or smell like before I tried this. Great hoppy brew and one of my favorites."
"the bomber moved pretty quickly, although the bitter finish slows the drinkability down. a very good, but not great, IPA."
"Pours a dark copper color from the bottle leaving 1 inch of foam that left lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was a nice citrus smell. The taste was the same citrus with a slightly bitter finish. Overall I think this one is nicely balanced and I will definitely seek this out again."
"D - A good beer but not as smooth and balanced as I like in a west coast IPA."
"Another great West Coast IPA."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was cloudy with a bit of an orange hue to it. The beer was hoppy smelling and hoppy tasting ike it ought to be I guess. The beer also had great lacing up and down the glass. I guess this must be a great IPA according to the ratings, however I did not care for it and will not buy again."
"D: This beer is slightly odd for an IPA, but oddly drinkable. It's not classic in style, but has a tasty and complex quality to it."
"Recommended for any IPA lover."
"Boy was I glad I tried this one. One of the better IPA's I've had and starting to like these left coast beers. Just a very smooth, balanced beer overall that you could just drink all day. I'm surprised my go to beer store has such a random beer from a well established Cali brewery and I wish they could get some more... this was a damn good IPA."
"A: Paper thin layer of foam, copper color - 3.75, S: Very earthy, what I believe are Columbus hops, a hearty dose of caramely malt, a touch of toastiness - 4.25, Big grapefruit, some nuttiness, mildly pungent on the end, some crisp pine is also noticeable - 4.50, M: Some staying power on the tongue, a touch sticky - 4.25, D: A very solid IPA, not an extreme big but a well crafted beer - 4.25"
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Nearly clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor is sweet grapefruit that fades to bitter grapefruit at finish. No surprises here. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"A very drinkable ipa with a nice hop-profile. More please!"
"A well made IPA. Pleasant and unified flavor lets this one go down easily. A good session brew."
"Ballast Point is definitely a name I'll have to keep in mind, if only for this IPA alone. Gives DFH a real run for its money in my mind, which is no small feat, as I'm a diehard fan of both 60 and 90 Minute IPAs. This is a must-try IPA."
"Drinkability is moderate. Drinks fairly easily, but flavors are sub par IMO."
"D: Very nice beer. Reminds me of a poor man's masala mama. I mean that as a compliment. Double taste without the booze hammer."
"Drinkability: An above average IPA in all departments, without being mindblowing. Just a very good, very drinkable, very tasty IPA. Easily manageable alcohol and a lot of tasty notes, decently complex, and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Heavy on the hops, but backed up by a strong malt presence. Nowhere close to a session beer, but a really good example of a West Coast IPA. We'll probably try this one again."
"D- This is a very nice west coast IPA. The bottle states a big floral hop presence but what I got from it was more of a spicy than floral presence (big plus for me). I'll remember that I like this one for future trades and when I travel."
"Pours a cloudy amberish copper with a yellowish two fingers of lucious foam that retains nicley and leaves behind some sticky globs of lacing. The nose smells like pineapple Starburst fruit chews,with other citrusy hops as well. Citrus and grapefruit notes are first to greet the tounge followed by a light malty balance,leaning heavily toward the hops. Nice medium body with tingling hoppy bitterness and soft carbonation. This is a quality AIPA,give it a try."
"Drinkability: Wonderful. This beer is incredibly packed with flavor. There's quite a bit going on with this one. I really wish I had more around so I could keep experiencing it."
"HV"
"Drinkability - This is a pretty damn good beer. Ballast Point has never disappointed me. It is easy to drink, smells great, and tastes pretty good. Its too bad that they don't distribute out here in Texas."
"Body is medium, creamy, smooth, oily, and has superb drinkability. A seriously delicious session IPA."
"D: OK drinkability but would be better if it wasn't so acidic at the end."
"wow, my friend said this was real good, but this is real good. definitely this is exceeding my already high expectations. poured into a nonic, this is a glowing orangey light amber with just a teeny slight haze and no sediment. creamy white head persists to a collar and the lacing clings down the glass. as the label suggests, the aroma is floral and citrusy with resined, honeyed characteristics to boot. the toffee flavors noted on the label are, thankfully for me, not noted. there is, however, a nice honeyed/bread dough malt sweetness washed out by a prominent and lingering, but not harsh or astringent, hop bitterness. really nice. nicely carbonated, creamy and prickly mouthfeel. medium to full in body, this one almost smells/tastes/feels like a DIPA-but it's only 6%! to sum up, this was/is some really good fucking shit."
"Bronze colored beer with a wispy head of foam that lasts well. Very nice hop aroma that gives notions of spruce, pine, lemon, hop oil....It's pure and quite nice. Flavor is super hoppy. Big on flavor hops, but light on bitterness, not in a bad way. Woody hoppiness, with well structured notes of lemon, grapefruit, spruce and pine. Really nice beer. Beautifully hoppy and impressive. Up there with some of the best SoCal IPA's."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and slightly too much carbonation. A decent IPA but a little bit of a let down after all the hype and the great smells."
"Big Eye pours a nice rustic amber color with a good sized and slightly off-white head on it. It left spotty lacing on my pint glass. The smell is packed full citrus fruits with notes of oranges, tangerines, and lemon peel. There is some slight caramel notes coming out of the malt as well, but not well pronounced. I don't think I am giving the nose justice there, but this is complex and wonderful nose on this IPA. The scents leads right into the flavor profile with the bitter hops upfront flooding with flavors of grapefruit, pine needles, lemon zest, and finally the caramel soaked bready malt comes out in the finish. The flavors meld very well together and create a unique and balanced IPA for a hop-lover. I would think a non IPA drinker would find this offering quite harsh though, but not me. The mouthfeel has plenty of carbonation for this medium bodied beer that leaves no detectable alcohol in the finish. The drinkability for a hop lover is excellent and would also be quite session able at only six percent."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/gold/copper color with a decent, off white head that retains very well. Smells juicy, citrusy, tropical, malty caramel, ...smells delicious. Taste is also very impressive. Tropical notes, grapefruit, caramel up front and is quickly taken over by a HUGE bite of bitterness that maintains control. Very dry, astringent finish. Medium bodied, good carbonation. This beer is crazy bitter. Wow. Very enjoyable and pretty drinkable if you dont mind your taste buds being fried."
"Quite a peachy-amber color, hazy too. A modest off-white pillow-like head tops it off. A most peculiar aroma of fruity seafood. The hops I mean. They have some citrus, some orchard fruit, and this slight whiff of fresh seafood. Maybe it's the fish on the label. These smells continue on the flavor with the addition of sweet malts. Soft medium body. Hoppy marmalade on the finish. The finish leads back to the start. I like it."
"Suprizingly drinkable very creamy and leaving a nice sticky hop coating of the roof of the mouth. Very intense ipa,could easily pass for a double. stronger than a lot the the doubles i've tried."
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Aroma is immediate hops hops hops. Pine and citrus complete the intense aroma. Pours very rich copper with a substancial orange head that leaves lacing to the bottem of the glass. Head holds up fairly well. Flavor is strong bitter hops up front balanced out by citrus and some malt in the middle and leaving a definate pine resin in the end with just a touch of alcohol to warm the throat. Bitterness lingers. In the mouth the tongue is coated with the pine resin which takes away slightly from drinkability for me but for west coast IPA lovers this would be plus. The flavors do blend nicely in the mouth. At 6% alcohol a bit lower than some IPA's which would make this a good choice to enjoy more than one."
"Pretty good drinkability, but I wish the ABV was just a tad lower to make this one a little bit more sessionable. I could easily see myself trying to knock back a sixer of these."
"D: A fitting West Coast IPA full of grapefruit flavored hop character. Due to its bitterness I did not find it particularly drinkable."
"Great ipa and beer in general.I will check this stuff out again soon."
"Overall, this beer is a disappointment. It isn't bad, but judged against its competitors, particularly its fellow San Diego brew, Green Flash's West Coast IPA, Big Eye clearly shows its flaws. This is not a beer I will be coming back to."
" a very nice IPA."
"D: The moderate alcohol and full hoppy flavor are big winners. I was underwhelmed by the bottle but on-tap it really works."
"D: The pronounced malt presence makes for a very balance and dirinkable IPA. Not quite in the same class as the Sculpin, but I really enjoyed this one."
"I enjoyed this one!!"
"Another tasty IPA from down San Diego way (RIP Phantom)."
"D - Great IPA a bit earthy for an everday beer but a great beer."
"A good, balanced West Coast IPA. I'm glad to see West Coast breweries starting to care about their malt profiles as a compliment to the hops."
"A nice drinkable, after dinner beer."
"Drinkability: I had to slow myself down while drinking this one."
"D - This is a very good IPA. The balance of flavors is outstanding."
"Overall another beer that tastes significantly different than from the tap. The tap has a much more citrus fresh hops presence with the bottle showing much more earth tones. Still, both are delicous but no doubt I prefer the tap version."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA, and I'm glad I bought a 6-pack. I'd never had anything by nor heard of this brewery before I bought this, but I'm looking forward to hopefully trying some more of their beers in the future."
"Tasted on 5/1/08."
"I sense a recipe change here. I've heard this is no longer an all centennial hopped brew. Is something else afoot. A revisit shows a lighter color yet with richer lacing. A bit of a lighter malt sense though of similar ilk. Overall I sense this beer got a little 'San Diegoafied'. I've adjusted the nose down 1.0 and the taste 0.5 as a result. Not impressed with this move but will check back once more to seek some validation. 3/31/10 confirms with a decreased feel as well, bit too watery. Nose is more malt than hops. Light and pleasant but hardly IPA worthy. Flavor is thinner in body as well. Pleasant but just missing the passion. Label still notes 100% American grown Centennial in this beer.."
"Enjoyable, if unspectacular IPA. This is one of those beers that tastes good and is well-made, but there's really nothing about it that makes it stand out. I wouldn't seek it out, but I could see myself buying some more if the mood struck me. Recommended."
"Notes: Always exciting to see another reknowned brewery hit NJ. This one is definitely for the hopheads, but is still nice and drinkable. Could be a nice quenching IPA for the summer months."
"M + D: Big and full, this is one you almost take a bite out of. In terms of alcohol, it's not a monster, but in terms of flavour, there's a punch. Nice to nurse this one for a while."
"This is one of the good ones - a little heavy on malt and alcohol but borderline sessionable."
"D: solid brew."
"Full and round mouthfeel, finishes a bit dry, maybe a little tannic. Pretty drinkable, nice to have a hoppy beer that doesn't knock me down."
"Bottle at Mondiale 2008. Some citrus aroma and citrus taste. A good representative American IPA, but also another and similar American IPA. Lacey, after well drinking through its orangey coloured body.Some astringencey yet satisfying.Yet a beer I did not and would not seek out again."
"Smell was a nice mix of pine and citrus. Mouthfeel was very nice with an amazing blast of fresh fruity hop goodness. I could drink a lot of these. One of the better IPAs I have had in a long time."
"Pours a clear amber with a creme head. Flavor is almost like a malty rye. Extremely smooth with a nice bite. Much different than some of those other San Diego Ales that blast your mouth with hop oil and flavors. Fairly full carbonation and a nice liquid feel. Very easy to drink. You could easily make this a regular in your lineup."
"Dark for an IPA and almost orange in color. Big foamy head and lots of bubbles rising to the top upon pouring. The aroma is slightly citrusy and not particularly big. This leads to a surprise because this is a powerful IPA that fills the mouth big time. I like hoppiness but would prefer a little more complexity over the fairly one-dimensional flavor of this stuff. If you don't like big Left Coast IPA's this isn't for you. Overall I liked it but will probably pick something else off the shelf next time I go for an IPA."
"Body is chewy and sugary, with modest carbonation. Tastes and feels almost like a weak west coast barleywine overall."
"A flavorful IPA with a few flaws regarding balance, but enjoyable and quite tasty. Flavorful enough that I would order another pint."
"This is Ballast Point's best offering I've tried thus far. The beer is fresh, flavorful and easy to drink."
"D - A great IPA, simply impressive really. I'm not a big fan of sessioning IPAs, but I do love a nice hop fix to sip on, and this is delivering pleasure in truckloads."
"It seems like Double and Imperial IPAs are the big thing these days, but if you are looking for a solid traditional American IPA with loads of hops give Big Eye a try."
"Pours a nice amber color with a thin white head in my sam perfect pint. Aromas are good, not great for a west coast IPA. (I am addicted to the Green Flash IPA, as we have just got these two beers in MA- YEAH!) Decent aromas of piney hops. Beer is very drinkable- a nicely balanced IPA- you get the rush of hops but then the beer smoots out with some caramel or toffee malts. Then I get the bitter finish and aftertaste. A very good beer, not a hop bomb by any means."
"This is a wonderful beer. My first from Ballast but not my last. So full of layers of flavor yet retains is drinkability. Reminds me a lot of SN Celebration. Bravo Ballast Point!"
"Either my tastes have changed or last year's batch was better. Regardless this is a solid IPA and certainly fair priced."
"This beer is thicker than most IPAs and not quite as easy drinking as I'd prefer. It's still very tasty and worth trying several times."
"EDIT: I had this a couple more times and enjoyed the hell out of it. I think the first bottle was a little old. Updated my scores accordingly."
"Pours a bright, pretty reddish amber color with no head to speak of. The nose is that of a big-time West Coast IPA -- lots of piney hops, with some grapefruit and some heat. On the palate, brisk bitterness from the get-go, which grows in intensity through the middle and into the finish, which has significant length. Aside from hop bitterness, you get some herbal notes that are hop derived and more than a little sweetness from the malts and alcohol. Mouthfeel is definitely rough around the edges, but it's also got some nice malt smoothness and, in a nice change for the style, not too much carbonation. Overall, this is a good IPA in the West Coast mold, with plenty of hops that take center stage. Well done."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark gold with a thin fine bubbled white head. Fruity/piney hop aroma with some berry. Aggressive hop bitterness balanced with plenty of malt. Some caramel. Long dry hoppy finish. A really solid IPA."
"If you love hops, this will be more than drinkable for you. I finished the bomber, but i dont want another now, or for awhile. The bottle says it is made exclusively with american centennial hops, which i think, after having this bottle, may just be the type of hops that give me the worst heartburn LOL"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Goes down smooth and is a pretty easy drinking IPA. Mellow carbonation throughout. Overall, this one seemed a little malt forward to me and the caramel/toffee was quite intense. Not something I would actively seek out but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks to Overlord for tossing this one my way."
"drinkability: Wow... this says 6.00%, but I think that might be a bit of an understatement. Still nice and jolly after the beer, makes me want another."
"My first experience with a Ballast Point offering. Pours a clear copper color, with a huge frothy white head that lingers nicely, giving a little bit of a mustache on the first sip. Clean hoppy aroma. Taste is a nice piney hop offering, without being overpowering. Good hints of citrus, and a touch of malt. Very clean drinking beer; great example of the style."
"This is just a solid all around beer. It's big but not over the top in any way and hits the mark just right for a standard American IPA. I'm certainly curious to try their other offerings, and Ballast Point seems to be a nice addition to the New Jersey market. Definitely try this one."
"Thanks to seaoflament for the extra!"
"If I could drink this all day I'd be a happy man!"
"Cheers"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a beautiful orange-red color with a two finger, frothy off-white head. The smell is a wonderful perfume of American hops. Lots of citrus present; lemons, oranges, grapefruit and pineapple all come to mind, also some grassy pine. The taste is a floral bouquet of hops, balanced nicely with a biscuity, slightly toasted malts. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky smooth carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent IPA, not overboard on hops but satisfying and drinkable."
"This is an instance when balance and easy blending outweigh in-your-face hops blasts. Sure, the hops assert, but they do so tastefully and with due respect for the able malt. The crisp, clean persona makes it enjoyable and drinkable. It's easy to like, and not all beers can make such a claim. Now that Ballast Point is here, I'm looking forward to whatever I might sample next."
"tasty. a good AIPA with better marks in certain categories, not worth pawning off grandma's dentures but worth checking it out if available locally"
"Drinkability: Awesome drinkability. Very refreshing. A great IPA overall. I can't wait to try more Ballast Point brews."
"22 ounce bomber, no freshness dating offered. Great to see this fine S.D. beer available on the east coast. Pours almond/orangy amber, clear under an off white tiny bubble head, that leaves great looking fine sheeting/lacing. The unmistakable freshness of the hopped laden nose, brings back those lazy days on the left coast, yum. Way Citric, piney, resiny, hop lovers will love this one. Not over poweringly crunching (Ruinationlike) but 'SD"" style all the way. Smooth, flavorful, high quality. Welcome to the neighborhood."
"D: Very drinkable, very nice and an great example per style and one you could easily enjoy all night with no complaints."
"I'm personally not to keen on this beer. I don't like the extremely astringent grapefruit taste in this American IPA."
"I'm glad I had the opportunity to try another IPA from the San Diego, CA region. Having said that, I don't find Ballast Point's Big Eye IPA in the same league as some of the other premier IPAs from that area. This statement doesn't detract from its overall quality because overall, it was a good IPA. I would drink this again, but I don't see it becoming a member of my greatest hits collection."
"This is highly drinkable, and a great example of an IPA (it could even pass for a DIPA as far as the hops are concerned!)."
"Wow, this is just a great West Coast IPA from Ballast Point! Just tons of fresh pine and citrus notes with an awesome slickness, that coupled with the undetectable ABV, helps this one go down as easy as anything. I'll definitely be seeking out a six-pack of this next time."
"Recommended..."
"Just an excellent IPA--complex, balanced, and very satisfying. A must-try."
"Overall- A solid IPA worthy of the $5 bomber. Another good Ballast Point beer."
"Nice bronze color with a short white head. Sticky lacing. Nice piney hops smell that is balanced with a nice caramel malt backbone. Taste gives a little more of a citrus note than the smell. Nice balance. Some puckering pine on the finish. In a market flooded with IPA's this is one that can hold it's own. My first Ballast Point brew and I'll gladly come back for some more."
"An exceptionally well balanced representation of the style."
"Another quality IPA from the Left Coast. I'm a fan of both Big Eye and Dorado from Ballast Point."
"Slight hazed amber pour but mostly transluscent still, with a big long lasting white head. Nicely fresh hopped smell with good sweetness coming through in the way of sweet fruity pine. Taste is piney bitterness, some sweetness behind that, with a somewhat astringent soap finish. Above average hoppiness I'd say, and a good overall IPA."
"Finishes cleaner than expected, making this a very drinkable beer. I'd recommend it."
"Very solid IPA, it could become a mainstay in my fridge if it wasn't for the 22oz only format."
"Drinkability is good, a nice and sweet IPA that hold up well in the cask version, low alcohol presence in the session range, the hops shine through but there is great balance here"
"Overall this IPA is a bit of a blundering mess-- too sweet and slightly cloying. It is neither clean nor crisp, and there seems to be an overabundance of finishing hops and not enough bittering hops. Least favorite in the blind tasting."
"Glad I got to give this California regional a go. Decent IPA but certainly not elite. Thanks for the bottle, Overlord!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good IPA to drink for an entire evening."
"D- i wouldn't session but i would drink this again, wonderful mouthfeel, very west coast, top notch IPA"
"Regardless, it's well put together, and it's very drinkable anytime."
"Somewhat abrasive in the mouthfeel. This is the only knock that I have on this beer as it's an excellent example of a West Coast IPA. I've tried both of the Ballast Point brews that sirhc sent me and I'm very impressed. I wonder why I haven't heard more about this brewery."
"This beer was a nice orange with a good sized head. There was plenty of lacing. The smell was piney hops. The taste was bitter, with a nice aftertaste of hops. A nice smooth beer. The mouthfeel was sticky. I could drink this beer again anytime. A mighty fine ipa. Thanks to wcudwight for sharing."
"Overall this was a really great IPA. This is the style I love and I was very impressed with the example presented here. This was a classic west coast IPA from the moment I popped the cap on it, and I would gladly accept another one of these any day!"
"Pours to a hazy prange amber body with a fuzzy off white head with full bubbles that last a couple of minutes. Leaves nice lace as it fades. Nose has a lot going on with notes of pine, dill, citrus, and peppery spice. Enters the mouth and really wakes up the taste buds with a shrill sour bitter that is initial but calms down quickly to a mild long bitter richness. The mouthfeel is a nice fullness comprissed of dry malt and nippy earthy bitter feel. Solid drinkable IPA with a consistant hop presence throughout."
"D: This is a good example of a classic west coast IPA with the pine needle grapfruit flavor."
"I love centennials and citrusy IPAs, hence this beer was like candy to me. Highly drinkable. I want some more, fast."
"Drinks good, but there's the wrong mix of hops to make me happy. I could probably have 2 or 3 before moving on. Solid, but not my cup of tea"
"Dark yellow color, plenty of foam which sticks to the glass. Smells of citrus, tastes of citrus, more orange than anything, with some grapefruit in there too, bitter aftertaste. Good amount of carbonation. Tastes great, and could drink lots of it. First rate IPA."
"Oh man, are those centennial hops? In short, this beer reminds me of Two Hearted Ale, but with a more balanced malt backbone. It's a good, standard American IPA with big, bitter citrus hops and a slight balance from semi-dry roasted caramel malt. Start to finish, a tasty and well-made beer"
"Drink pretty good, it is almost a session beer, and the alcohol is well hidden but it is 7% (as stated on the bottle) and does feel a bit filling."
"Nice light amber. Good head retention and decent lace is left. Strong inviting piney hop aroma. Piney hop note is strongest on the taste buds, malt backbone is a bit thin. Hop is not overpowering but could use a bit more balance. Thick mouth feel works and is a nice drinkable IPA. pretty good beer from San Diego area."
"Feels a little thin but is super easy to drink. At 6% this would make a great session beer. Damn tasty."
"D - good tasting, drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: if you are in the mood for a very flavorful IPA this is one for you. Hopheads will love this offering. The bomber went down quick and I was looking for another bottle to open right away."
"Overall a slightly different IPA experience. It's fairly hoppy for a beer that doesn't call itself a double. I like it and will get it again. If you are an IPA fan this is a good shot."
"Pours a clear orange color with a medium rocky off-white head that has fair retention. Large spots of lacing on the glass. Buttery hops aroma with hints of grass and cedar. Medium body with flavors of hops, sweet caramel malt and fruit. Dry, hoppy finish with a lingering buttery aftertaste. Unique and interesting overall."
"D: One of the better West Coast IPAs that I have had, it can stand its ground with the best of the group, Green Flash. A easy drinking beer for its size, great price too, at $3.29 a bottle, will definitely need to try more Ballast Point beers in the future, and pick this one up again."
"The beer seemed a little two one sided for me. Just my personal taste. The pine/oil hops were just a little to much for me..but i still know this is a good beer."
"I walked into a 7-11 in San Diego and was amazed to see something of this caliber (I'm from Colorado). Nice orange color with citrus aromas. Taste was weaker than I expected, because I always assume San Diego IPA's have to be stellar. Still, nice flavors of citrus hops with a good malty body.This one was good but not spectacular."
"I'll comment on the scent first, cause its quite nice. That sticky, sappy, hop-dripping scent most of us love. Fairly hazy copper-toned body, topped with a nice, cream colored head that lasts a while and leaves a nice trail of lace. And the taste is what I was hoping it would be: thick sappy hops all over your tounge. Not as intense as some on the market, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (although the more the merrier in my book). Bottle says the hops are exclusively American Centennial, and thats alright. Strictly the bitter hops. I could forget my name drinking these."
"My first Ballast Point, and it's a good one. Recommended for W. Coast IPA fans."
"Drinkability: Just a superb IPA; hits all my buttons for the style"
"Pretty darn good IPA, but that bitter finish keeps it from being overly drinkable for me."
"Ballast Point continues to rise in my estimation with every offering I consume."
"Beer poured a copper color with a decent white head that dissapated pretty quickly. Nose is heavy on those wonderful citrus hops. Taste is pretty much like the nose, a nice healthy blast of those citrus hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is very good. There is a health dose of hops that actually does not overwhelm the palate llike others in the class. This is a very nice representation of the west coast ipa style."
"This is one fantastic IPA! It pours rich reddish amber with a billowing, cream colored, rocky head. Good, sticky lacing helps this IPA The smell leaps out of the glass with spicy, tart, fruity hops, some notes of tomato, peaches, cream, chocolate (?!?!) and smooth, caramel, rich malt. The taste is fantastic, with rich, spicy, hops; caramel flavored malt, acidic tomato flavors, herbs, peaches, chocolate, cherries and strawberries. The mouthfeel is medium and velvety, but not the beer's strongest point. The drinkabilty makes this easily sessionable. Highly recommended."
"This beer is a sun kissed copper with not much a smell but packs a great taste and is less filling. Not a big west coast IPA, but still gives you a bang for your buck with a nice balance. Sweet taste, hoppy sting like a bee but light like a butterfly. I think their porter is the best beer they make but this is a great balanced IPA to enjoy without being overwhelmed."
"Pours a clear copper orange with large pearl head that retains and laces sheets on the glass. Smells of fresh hops, citrus and rind with a malty backend. Tastes of juicy fruit, crisp hops, tangerine and pineapple. Feels medium and refreshing in the mouth with nice carbonation. A bitteness and earthy feel lingers on the tongue. Very good drinkability, crisp, clean and refreshing. A wonderful, sessionable IPA."
"""you know what I like"" IPA from Ballast Point."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little tannish head, nice thick sticky lacing follows. The nose is a big hop bomb, citrus, pines, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is very hoppy for a 6% ABV IPA, nice citrus feel, piney, and some caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, an awesome IPA from Ballast Point, highly recommended."
"D: Highly drinkable due to the great flavors and relatively low ABV. Yet another excellent west coast IPA from a San Diego brewer. Highly recommended."
"I did find that by the end of the glass the flavors had settled down somewhat and the thought of having another seemed more reasoable than after the first few sips."
"22oz bomber: Thanks to Vac for this one. It pours a slightly orangish-amber color. There was a small off white head that didnt hang around too long. It didnt leave too much lacing wither. The aroma is mainly pine hops, but not overly done. Some caramel malts and floral notes also. The hop bite is somewhat subdued in the taste. There is a dryness to the flavor also, as well as a somewhat biscuity taste. An interesting mouthfeel. It isnt silky, and Im not quite sure that I can put my finger on it. Someone else said soapy in their review. It isnt quite that, but along those lines. It doesnt make it bad, just a little different."
"Thanks John."
"Have had many times since my initial tasting and I must say that the hop character is much more pronounced. I believe I had an older bottle. Tons of grapefruit and pine. The weird tropical fruitiness has not been present in any of the following bottles. Increased smell and taste to 4.0 from 3.0. Very good IPA that I would recommend."
"Pours a clear copper hue with a two finger fluffy off-white colored head that takes forever to die down. Stickiness is crazy good, all over the glass, love how this one looks. Smell...damn I love it. Such a fresh pine odor mixed perfectly with a crisp grapefruit. I could smell this one all night, but I'm getting thirsty. Taste is actually maltier than I had anticipated. Starts off very smooth on the tongue with a pale malt then quickly the hops take over and leave the mouth feeling very dry from the bitter citrus hop flavors. Probably one of the most balanced IPA's I've had. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. I really want the DIPA now from Ballast, who wants to trade? Please."
"This is a great looking beer. I poured it into a Chimay goblet and it is a very clear dark amber reddish color. The only downside is that it had very little head. The aroma is filled with grapefruit. The flavor is a good strong blast of grapefruit with slightly more bitterness than the big hop flavor. Behind the grapefruit there is some grassy flavor too. There is a good bit of sweetness as well. This is a good IPA but the bitterness adds up so I can't drink too much of it."
"Oily and juicy with the strong hop presense, this would certainly rate as a DIPA for me  except the alcohol may be a tad weak. No hint what-so-ever of a 7%. The oil subsides quickly, leaving a dry finish. Pretty nice drinking IPA, glad I had the chance to savor this tasty treat."
"I'll be back for more!"
"An exceptional American IPA. (Send more please.)"
"One of my favorite and more unique IPA's. Worth seeking out!"
"Notes: Special thanks to KingG for the sample."
"Very good IPA...not on the top tier, but not far behind. Well worth seeking this one out."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Somewhat oily, medium carbonation. Very well done. I wish I had regular access to this one."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very clear, rich amber color with a nice white head that is quite sturdy and leaves some nice lacing all over the sides of the glass. Smell is predominantly pine and floral notes with a touch of citrus rind. Taste is heavy on grapefruit juice/rind, pine, & hops - very nice. Mouthfeel is both crisp & thick - good carbonation and a slight oily character make this very good. This is a hop punch to the face, but it's really well done - an easy drinkin' hopbomb. Highly Recommended."
"Super easy to put down, a nicely balanced beer in my opinion with a nice bitter edge to it, realitively full bodied, but still crisp. All of this really help with the drinkability here."
"Cheers."
"from nvsblman in Get Bombed"
"[Review from notes] Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a tumbler in January 2007. Received from flexabull - thank you, Paul."
"Superb beer, and one I'll be happy to encounter again. Ballast Point hasn't misfired yet..."
"Glowing golden amber. Puffy soft tan head of mixed size bubbles that eventually falls to a meringue-like cap which deposits splotchy chunks of lace on the glass. Big aromas of grapefruit peel and orange rind are sharp and crisp, and indicative of fresh picked fruit. There is some blossomy fragrant sweetness as well as a faint whiff of alcohol. Lots of bitey citrus hop juice up front riding along a nice medium body. The finish is long and sticky and filled with plenty of grapefruit as well as having a bit of pine sliding in at the end. The carbonation is low, lending a softness to the feel. This is nice and an easy drinker."
"The taste is sweet with citrus hops coming through at the finish. Mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is up there for any IPA I have had. Nice beer from So-Cal"
"Pours copper colored with a short head but very good lacing. Smells lightly hoppy and a little grainy. There is also a slight soapiness. The taste has piney hops up front followed by stone fruit and bubblegum. Fairly balanced with bitter hops and grainy malt. The mouthfeel is a little grainy for my taste but with good weight and carbonation. Quite drinkable"
"While the aromatics or flavors of the hopping aren't blastingly pungent, Big eye gets high marks for drinkability."
"I'd add this to regular rotation, but it's not available locally, and that's OK too."
"D: A very excellent easy drinking IPA. Nice and smooth with a decent abv that's not too high. Well balanced with a good body."
"A great beer. One of the top 5 IPAs I've had. Give it a try if you get a chance."
"This beer lived up to the San Diego standard. What an excellent IPA. This one seems to border a bit on DIPA side... but it's still drinkable, enjoyable, and well worth a try. I'll be sure to grab another one of these the next time I am shopping."
"Great definative American IPA. Slam dunk from Ballast Point. This is my favorite flavor of beer right now at the local store. Don't be put off if their Dorado 2xIPA is too sticky and sweet-this may be right up your alley. Cheers!"
"The beer seems over carbonated on the palate, making it difficult to distinguish the consistency of the body. On top of that, the over caramelized malt tends to clash with the hops. There is a bit of piney bitterness that lingers forever, leaving a very dry and ashy feeling in my throat. I will struggle to drink the whole bomber. I took a chance buying this beer after not liking the Dorado IIPA, but I don't think I will ever bother with the rest of the Ballast Point line-up."
"Great, balanced IPA, with a tropical character. Cascade hops are great, but so is variety."
"Cheers"
"Pours a hazy deep burnt orange color with a tall light tan head that slowly recedes into a very thick and rocky lace that coats the walls of the glass as it fades. Nose is strong floral hops with notes of fresh pine. Taste is bitter citrus rind and oily hop resins but there is enough of a malt backbone to support the hop profile. Very nicely done."
"Pours a deep amber gold with a decent head floating on top. Nose is piney and citric along with some caramel notes. Flavor is bold and hoppy, malts making a valient effort to survive before the hops get their man in the bitter finish. Mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy which carries out the sweet background. A nice IPA, closer to a 2IPA on the continuum than the paler, more exclusively hop-driven IPA's. Thanks to Solomon420 for this bomber."
"Thanks to intriqken for shipping this one my way."
"D-Kind of blah. Almost tastes off but I don't think it is. Don't like it much at all."
"Solid medium body with a healthy dose of alcohol all lead to a highly drinkable, very tasty IPA of the West-coast style, that's worth it's weight in hops...don't miss it."
"Mouthfeel is ok, thinner than ideal. My drinkability notes says ""pretty darn good", and the awesome scent of this beer outwieghs my slight demerits for mouthfeel. This is an IPA that I could really quaff a serious amount of."
"Mouthfeel is medium and slightly slick with a little bit of dryness in the finish. Overall a tasty and very hoppy IPA."
"Creamy, medium body with a slick feel left behind in the mouth. I could drink one of these everyday. Only wish they would ship to Delaware. Looks like I am going to have to work out a trade for this one....soon."
"Taste & Body: Light and refreshing, clean and simple. A textbook American IPA, or should I say benchmark? It's no surprise at all, but it's enjoyable and very well made. I'll buy it from time to time."
"Last swigs: Touch of lemon dry and delicate pine.All Centennial. Wow!"
"Today is a hot sunny summer Sunday afternoon. I was looking for a brutal IPA to lead me into a nap. This was just the thing. I even tipped the bottle on edge so I could get the last dribble out of the bottom."
"D: Still an easily drinkable IPA, alcohol is low, and light body goes down easy. Flavor starts out well but could use more in the finish and mouthfeel. Definitely try it..."
"The beer is lightly chilled and has a light sweetness up front. The hops in this beer immediately take hold and are dominant from beginning to end. Notes of candied orange peel are dominant up front, but a gripping, solid bitterness soon takes hole and lingers on in the finish. Towards the end of a sip a herbal note similar to mint, or perhaps menthol would be a better descriptor, starts to become noticeable. A certain resinous, almost pine-like note also is found lingering on in the finish. There is a touch of malt here as well, perhaps some caramel, and something like toffee; these notes though only serve to accentuate the citrus components of the hop character. This is a nice beer, easy drinking, though it perhaps has a bit too much astringent, herbal bitterness to be truly quaffable. It is certainly enjoyable though and is worth trying if you like hops."
"D: I hate ""standard"" IPA's. You know those ones that just don't stand out, just another assembly line IPA? This one has something different and worth drinking."
"Quite pale, amber color. Grassy and citrusy aroma-not as big as some other IPAs for sure. Very hoppy and intense bitter flavor-very upfront but not overpowering. Some malt flavor. Good body overall-not as ""oily and ""slick"" as some others can be. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Well worth a try."
"I recommend this IPA as a change from all the IIIPA we have so much of anymore."
"Not a favorite of mine for an IPA, but mainly because of the discrepency between aromas and taste taking away from an otherwise balanced brew."
"This beer would be a great session beer. It is not overly high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is not aggressive. Also it tastes great. This is a very fine beer from the Balast Point guys. I am surprized it took me so long to review it."
"Had on tap Big IPA great different hop notes from pepper to pine could be columbus and chinook. Nice big head and copper clear look with tight little bubbles. Excellent malt backbone of munich taste and perfect bitterness. Great finish for a great brew."
"If you want to know what Centennial hops smell and taste like than get this beer. The aroma was full, resiny slightly citrus with a tinge of caramel. It had a wonderful head that would not give up with great lacing. The bubbles were medium sized. The color is gold/copper and it was very clear. The flavor is very bitter and resiny but there is some malt seetness for the hops to hold on to. I did not get much yeast flavor contribution. I was slightly surprised by the finish b/c I expected a crazy hoppy dry mouth but it was pleasant. Don't get me wrong, when I burped later I could still taste it and was happy for that. To me a sign of a good American IPA is that the belch later reminds you of the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium CO2, a little CO2 bite, med body and a slight alcohol warmth. I found this beer very drinkable and a great way to showcase Centennial hops. (one of my favorite hops!) As a critique I would suggest using some other hops to give a more complex flavor. However since this IPA comes from San Diego, where IPAs seem to rule it cool that they decided to keep it simple and even put it on the label that it's all one type of hops."
"Sadly, even though Im only a few hours from Ballast Point, the only place around LA that I ever see their fine products is BevMo. Next BevMo trip, Imma load up on this."
"Overall impression: Well balanced IPA - definitely not what you expect coming out of the San Diego area. This definitely doesn't mean it isn't a quality beer though - it is well made and tasty."
"Either way, a solid offering and a great first impression from the folks at Ballast Point...must find some of their others."
"Drinkability: When you make an IPA in SD, best make it hoppy. This is certainly and enjoyable and well made beer, but I can see why ecb thinks this brewery/beer gets overlooked when you consider what else is available in the immediate area. I'd probably pick it up occasionally if I lived in the region."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a very clear light copper/orange color. Thick pillow of white fluffy head. Lots of tiny streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Good head retention. Nice patches of lace stuck on the sides of the glass. Floral slightly spicy aroma of Centennial hops. Caramel malt backed up solidly by floral and citrusy hop flavor. Good amount of bitterness. Finishes sort of dry. Medium body. Very enjoyable. Big thanks to EyeChartBrew for bringing this one to me from the West Coast!"
"Drinkability- Another good IPA that has a bigger malt background than expected. Quite drinkable at it's 6% abv level."
"The pour is a brilliant honey color. The big white head has great retention. Piney, citrusy- grapefruit and orange hops fill the nose, accented by sweet malts. This beer manages to not be overly pale while having a sharp hoppy bite that's nice and bitter. I like me some Centennial hops."
"A firm standing IPA. A pretty decent showing thats drinkable to the extent of getting use to its overall parching dryness that tends to fade in and out as it warms."
"Appearance draws you in. Nice frothy head and copper body with sticky lacing. Massive carbonation never lets the head waver at all. Very drinkable as nothing is too pungent or strong. Light hoppy flavor lends this beer to other flavors. A bit of light citrus based fruit..pineapple? a lingering aftertaste. Not much warming/alcohol taste which is nice refreshing for an IPA. I will buy this beer many times and hope to have it on tap soon."
"Notes: Superb IPA! This is one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had!"
"Mmmm, I dont know why I dont drink more of this... damn good. I poured from a 22oz bomber into my pint glass. the color was a nice warm orange-golden color. The smell was great... I dont know if it was a mix between an earthy citrus crossed with pine but i really liked it... It reminded me of Hitachino Nest Anniversary Ale. The taste was incredible. i could really taste the hops, yet it wasnt rough... hoppy and flavorful. I had a what seemed to be a rather carbonated bottle which gave me a nice sensation in my mouth. I certainly didnt mind it because everything was just tasting damn good. As for the drinkability, well, I'm going to buy more for the weekend and i really am wondering why i havent been drinking more of this."
"Bright, golden copper-orange with a large, cottony light sandy head. Great lacing. As the thunderous head recedes a little, I'm picking up big hop aromas--juicy, citrusy, and even piney. Not a big malt presence though; just a light sugary biscuit. Taste starts off with big hops as well. Juicy pineapple and grapefruit right out of the gate. Acidic and bitter pin pricks all over my tongue. Nice hop flavor. Near the finish, the toffee/sugary biscuit malt body show up, but can't stand up to the hop onslaught. Finish is bitter with traces of sugary malt. Big, lively feel to this one. A very nice IPA."
"Drinkability: A superb IPA which I highly recommend."
"22oz bomber. Bubbly copper with a solid inch of puffy white head. Surprisingly this is an extremely heady beer. The 2nd pour from the bomber yielded an enormous cloud atop! Aroma is beautiful, a rich, resinous, citrus pine juicy hop thing going on. Flavor is not nearly as hoppy as the aroma, but its extremely well balanced. Has a very earthy, woody flavor with a nice caramel malt flavor. The Centennials come in very nicely in the finish as well. Crisp mouthfeel, and an extremely drinkable IPA."
"I thank the Gentleman from Long Beach for such a nice gift from a brewery I had yet to sample."
"one of my new favorite ipa's. the centenials really are the strong point of this, and i like it."
"Big Eye is a pretty darn good IPA. It doesn't get into my upper tier, but it's still heartily recommended. Especially if you're of the hophead persuasion."
"Pours a medium copper-gold color with a large (2 inch) head of small bubbles. As the white to off-white head settles, the head is left with odd-looking large bubbles supporting much smaller bubbles on top. Aroma is intensely hoppy, herbal ""in the woods after a rainstorm", somewhat musty, and oh, yeah, hops. Pretty nice! Flavor is grass, some citrus (lime & grapefruit?). The hop profile is pretty nice, not as overwhelming a some I have tasted. Mothfeel moderate, with a nice creaminess. Overall a very nice IPA that I look forward to trying again."
"Outstanding Drinkability for an American IPA. Tasty balanced and not so hoppy that is shocks your tastebuds."
"A hazy golden-orange rests beneath a creamy white head that holds quite well and leaves lots of thin, splashy lace at the outset. Limited amounts of tiny bubbles can be seen streaming to the surface through a thick, proteinaceous haze, helping to maintain its creamy white lid. The malty/fruity/piney/floral/citrusy nose is rather interesting with a combination of sweet, lightly caramel-drizzled dough; apricots; citrus rind; wild flowers; dull pine; wet earth; and dried leaves. It's quite unique, and is even reminiscent of bourbon in a way. It's gently crisp on the tongue before warming to become just slightly creamy with a medium-full body and very fine, natural carbonation (it's bottle conditioned). In the flavor, fruit appears and vanishes quickly, followed by piney hops atop a toasty, caramel-drizzled malt base. It's well-balanced by a solid bitterness, and it finishes drying with some more of its floral and citrus-rind flavors amidst a lightly sticky malt."
"Another winner from a San Diego brewery. This one poured a sunset orange color with a dense white head that left some nice lace. The smell was big on citrusy hops with a slight scent of malt way in the background. As for the taste, this has to be one of the more balanced IPA's I've ever had and would be a good session IPA for sure. The flavor is hoppy for sure, but it is balanced out very nicely by a thick malt backbone and a nice hearty mouthfeel. A great beer that I will revisit soon."
"This beer is very drinkable at (only) 6.0% alcohol. Will try to get more somehow."
"The beer as it immigrates from the Brown Bomber to my special mug a transpicuous deep amber color and no slight is intended to that master of pugilism, Joe Louis who was the real Brown Bomber! The head is modest in its stature, the texture spumous and the color a beauteous light tan with the resultant lace a silky sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a mild hop floral spiciness at the front with a sweet malt middles, the back is fresh and crisp, and start is ambrosial with a nice malt presence, which leads us to the middling top. Finish is benevolent in its acidity; the hops survigrous in their spicy bite, droughty aftertaste continues the spicy floral bite from the hops, a quaffable brew, and a palate pleaser. Im always quite impressed with their labels and think them an excellent brewery."
"The King recommends drinking this beer with a Bar-b-que chicken pizza."
"Appearance: Orange amber body with a monsterous cream colored head very creamy texture to it, awesome retention that forms into specks of lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma: Aggressive dose of hops is the main act here with big grapefruit notes and woody herbal flowery hop bursts some caramel malts are here to contrast the hops. Taste: Great mixture the hops are there doing their thing, but the balance of a bready yeast and specialty malts blended is a nice break from the amount of Centennials they used here. Hops are floral with a piney grapefruit edge to them very nice stuff, nice cohesion here like a well oiled machine. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale creamy smooth texture even carbonation. Drinkability: Very solid all around IPA glad I got ahold of this sample through a beer trade, thanks Chap."
"This is a good beer, one to train up those people leery of a stong IPA."
"This brew pours our a clear copper colour with a huge head of rocky white foam. The aromas are of bready/biscuity malts and nice citric and floral hops. The taste is wonderfully hoppy, yet not bitter at all. The nice light biscuity malt backbone of this brew works really well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and this stuff is damn easy to quaff. The drinkability is great!"
"Comments  Another wonderful offering from Ballast Point. Mickeymac was kind enough to send me this one. Sadly, this was the last of the awesome care package that he sent. Ironically, I think this also puts me over 500 karma points and gives me another dash of ale. How fitting."
"A bold medium bodied IPA. Carbonation is a poppy presence. There is a smoothness to the finish. This could be a session IPA."
"P.S. While drinking this, it more than once reminded me of Two-Hearted Ale from Bell's."
"Big Eye IPA is a solid West Coast style IPA. Long on hops, it has a nice balance of malt that sometimes is lost with other American IPA's. A nice offering from Ballast Point Brewing."
"One of the five best IPA's in California. A great beer from a great San Diego brewery. I sampled this beer while touring the brewery. If Big Eye has any weakness at all, it may be too smooth. I like an IPA that has a bite to it, but Big Eye delivers a constant and refreshing balance of hops and malt with no surprise finish."
"Deep golden and clear with a thick foamy head. Aroma is piney hops but with a nice sweet malt presence. I can really smell the grains in this one. This is one of the maltiest IPA's I've had. Otherwise similar to many California IPA's I've had recently. Body is full and smooth and finishes with only a slight bitter aftertaste. Bites back a little bit at the end. This is another nice IPA from Cali. I'm impressed."
"A very refreshing beer. Medium body, lightly carbonated and very drinkable. I'd like to try some of their other offerings someday. Very solid-not mindblowing-but solid."
"Orange amber color. Medium head. Aroma is grapefruity, piney and malty. A medium bodied IPA. A big, bold, hoppy west coat IPA. Hops are very prevalent, bitter, grapefruity and piney. Balanced by nutty and sweet malts. For a west coast IPA, its only slightly overbalanced towards the hops. Perhaps a touch too bitter, but a nice drinkable IPA. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is bitter."
"Originally sampled on 26 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This brew has lots of lemon & grapefruit in the nose. It pours a clear golden color w/ a quickly diminishing head. Lots of hops up front that taper off to a smooth finish."
"Copper in color with a thick, long-lasting off-white head. Great spiderweb of lac down the glass. Citric hops dominate the aroma, undergirded by a light malt sweetness and with a hint of floral hops detectable on the margins. Flavor is peppy, lots of citric hops all the way through, though the Centennial hops lend it a milder, more grapefruit-like character than some of the Cascade-based IPAs. Interesting choice in malt, too. Much more toasty than caramel, and sweetness in the beer is accordingly low. Still damn drinkable! A nice, and subtley different IPA."
"It's a good-looking copper with a decent sized off white head. The smell of Centennial hops is a very pleasant departure from the usual Cascades. It also has a slightly sweet bready smell. The taste is quite nice and complex. In addition to a bit of dough-like flavor, notes of flowery hops are present. This is a very nice IPA, and I'm looking forward to trying other Ballast Point beers."
"Keep your Big Eye out for this one  it is well worth it."
"This is a dark golden brew with a huge spicy hop aroma.  The large bitter spicy character balances the malts very well.  This IPA has a flavor characteristic I have never tasted in this style before, lemon.  This brew is very tasty and really is a plus for a quality brewery."
"Notes: Hopped with a single variety of hop called Centennial, well structured to make for a great American IPA with an outstanding balance and drinkability."
