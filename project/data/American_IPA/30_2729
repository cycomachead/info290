3.9,1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/16/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 29, 2015"

Poorly balanced and thin. Avery can make a delicious IPA (See Avery 20th Aniversary IPA). In fairness, this IPA seems to be widely variable from one 6-pack to another. It is not a big seller and I suspect that it is sometimes quite old. Not the best IPA.","fcbrew","Jun 12, 2014"

The malt offers some sweetness for balance before a big citrus rind/pith like bitterness slowly sneaks in on the sides and lingers on palate. The palate feels fairly full and there is just enough carbonation to give it some lift.","generallee","Jun 12, 2014"

Taste is smooth, bready malts with a citrusy pungency, coating resiny hop notes but also a brightness to it. Good balance, and a firm mouthfeel with an assertive carbonation. Big chewy mouthfeel.  Lots of bright C-hops in this with some earthiness as well and I think this makes quite a pleasant IPA with some forward flavour and a nice balance, a touch resiny perhaps but I enjoyed it. Bumped rating a little higher.","mick303","Jun 02, 2014"

Medium body with a a light creaminess. A quite nicely balanced and smooth IPA. Nice hop bill with more pine influence but good citrus too. Great tasting malt support body.

For an IPA it is more sweet than I had expected. The finish is very sharp, more so than I am used to, but not in a good way. I doubt I will be purchasing this one again.

Actually quite malty in the taste up front, but pleasant and not overly sweet, mid-palate quickly brought in a rush of crisp hops, orange rind and pine, for a lasting bitterness that took the edge off the obvious malt base. Medium body, crisp, fresh mouthfeel. Quite a solid IPA overall.","Rifugium","Jun 05, 2013"

Based off of that there is almost no way that there can be a letdown with the taste. As expected there is not. I am really digging the hops blend here and the result is an explosion of flavor. Citrus notes, especially grapefruit are apparent. The chinook hops are more passive here which is fine with me. This one is not offensive at all in terms of mouthfeel and the aftertaste is clean. It leaves you wanting another sip immediately. I'd have to say that this is one of the better IPAs that I have encountered in awhile.","mindlucent2007","Apr 02, 2013"

Nose doesn't give much hops, IMO, but I'm getting more defined sweetness from the malt. I expect this to be hoppy but, but not prominently either, and that's exactly what I get. Malt masking the hops, the hops coming in later, and there, but not loud. I would think in this form, this would be a brew that would please malt forward lovers of beer who want a moderate touch of hops. Freshness too might be clouding my observations.","Bitter_Echo","Jan 07, 2013"

To get a beer as clear as they have, you really have to be careful and know what you're doing to not lose all the important hop aroma and flavor that really make a contemporary American IPA. I'm guessing this is why it's so crystal clear but underwhelming in terms of hoppy flavor and aroma. There's quite a few breweries doing amazing stuff in this category and I don't think this one stands out in todays crowded IPA scene. It's a bit above average, but I've had lots of better ones.","taulpepper","Dec 07, 2012"

The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit, complete with peel, stealing the limelight. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"From the can: pours a hazy light golden body with a bright white head with excellent retention that leaves one of the most thorough lacing patterns I've ever seen. Aromas lean toward the centric spectrum, with a bit of pine resin and caramelly malts swimming in the mix as well. Tastewise, orange and lemon peel come through loud and clear on the front palate, with sweeter malt flavors like caramel apple hold the middle before piny flavors define the finish. For me personally, this beer manages to be simultaneously assertive yet easy and pleasurable to drink all on its own, no pub grub required.","droomyster","Oct 31, 2011"
4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"In conclusion This is one heck of India Pale Ale. A wonderfully balanced brew with a dry finish. I don’t really know if cozy is the right word but I’ll refer to anyway. The balance is flawless. Not too bitter, not too sweet. Just a dryness that’s very appealing. Part of the commercial description reads “Brewed by hop heads, for hop heads.” Avery to that!","TobiasGoth","Oct 31, 2011"

3.87,0.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Golden/bronze hue, not much murkiness at all. About a half-finger head. Lots of hops and a hint of citrus (I'm getting grapefruit) on the nose. The hops dominate most of the taste of the beer; high alpha acid American hop bitterness shines through, and some nice spiciness on the back end finishes it off. The mouthfeel is my favorite part; medium, but the bitterness and spiciness tingles the sides of the mouth and it still finishes really clean. A good session IPA. Definitely will be coming back to this one.","jacksonattack","Oct 20, 2011"
4.36,13.2,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Fruity and citrusy hops dominates the smell of the head. A grapfefuit aroma eminates from the head. Golden amber with sheer white head that disappears. Super floral hops with an amazing sweet sour combination with a grassy finish. Palate is slightly resenous with light traces of carbonation and a long, tasteful finish. Overall, one of Colorados top IPAs, especially fresh.","stabzmcgee","Oct 17, 2011"
3.89,1,3,4,4,3.5,4,"O- this is one of my favorite ipa's to style. I liken it to sierra nevada torpedo with a little less sweetness and a little more varied hop flavor. Bitter with a lot of pungent hop flavor and little to no malt present, just like an american ipa should be. This capped off my night of avery brews (white rascal, out of bounds stout, ipa) and is my favorite of the three.","znichols","Oct 16, 2011"
3.83,-0.5,3.5,3,4,5,4,"Overall - I would dub this a "summer" IPA. Unusually light, crisp, and yet enjoyable all at the same time. Perfect for drinking inside a screened in porch.","beerismysavior","Oct 11, 2011"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear light apple juice color with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus/tropical fruits, and some citrus zest hop aromas. Taste is of toasty malt, citrus juice, and some floral and herbal hop flavors. A very mild bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a dry finish just like the can says. Overall, this is a good IPA with a nice balance between the malt and hops.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 11, 2011"

3.08,-20,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Color is a burnt yellowish-orange with a one-finger head. The smell is subtle and doesn't really take over your nose like it should. The hops carry the flavor throughout the sip. It's stronger on the pine and resin profile rather than the fruit and citrus. I prefer a little more balance in that area. If finishes with a flat bitterness and not as clean as I prefer either. Not a bad beer but not a good beer either. I wouldn't buy them again when there are so many others that are better for the same price.","Jesse14","Oct 05, 2011"

This is a good one for hop heads as the taste isn't trul;y balanced out, it is a hoppy one. Again a very solid offering from Avery.","IrishTed122","Sep 02, 2011"
3.87,0.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured rich bright clear amber into glass. Aroma is of a light caramel and almost sweet and light hoppiness.

Very good for a nice session.","elginirishpunk","Aug 31, 2011"

3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: An enjoyable American IPA and true to the style, this brew is nicely hopped but remains balanced enough that it isn't overwhelmingly bitter. This is a solid summer and early fall brew that is decidedly simple but brewed with a quality and precision that you can't help but appreciate.

Not much of a nose on it, a bit of citrus and piney spice but not too much. The body is light, the flavor is good, a nice amount of bitter with a sip. This is an OK not great, IPA.

I think that Adam may have had to change the hop schedule since the last time I tried this beer (~3 years ago), so the aroma is a bit odd at first, but it still is well blended and drinkable.

CAN't they just CAN hops extract for people like me? Why do I gotta go through this torture? It had a beautiful taste, grassy, minty, slightly piney and I felt like a hops virgin again. Finish was when when I sat back and started licking the lacing out of the glass. My sponsor is on his way over, but I think that it is too late. I'm filling a cooler with this, tooling over to Hops (not Skid) Row, picking up my buddies and we're going surfing on hops down at the beach.

Should be a little darker to hint at the taste in my opinion. Smells like hop fruit and molasses very inviting but a little muted due to a soapy influence. Taste is slamming though, a little soap some citrus hops and big burnt sugar the exhale is very enjoyable. Carbonation is perfect but could use a bit more weight. Overall a def recommendation.

3.88,0.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured golden yellow with perfect clarity and a strong, rich, foamy white head. Good head retention as the foam slowly settled to a thick white head that left thick sticky lacings on the glass. Combination of citrus and floral hop aromas with a bready, malty undertone. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Floral and citrus hop flavors are pretty evenly matched in the front with a malty middle and relatively dry finish. A touch of pine hop bitterness at the end that tends to linger for a while which detracts a bit from the drinkability for me. The malty and hoppy flavors combine nicely to give this IPA some nice character.","IronLover","Feb 02, 2011"

Some slight citrus notes but not overpowering like many other IPA's out there. The brewery boast that it's a beer brewed for hop heads by hop heads. While it is a very hop centered beer it's very well balanced as I said before. Not too overpowering.

3.85,0,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"picked up a six pack of this stuff cause I knew it was fresh, not necessarily because it was my fist pick. It is only fair to review a beer when it is fresh, I would bet that many beers here fail to hit the mark because of this, so beermakers, label your sh*t, and buy back old beer? (I end up buying more SA than I'd care to admit, cause I KNOW it will be fresh) So, may not always be possible, but would be a step in the right direction... I know, easier said than done, it is hard enough to just survive as a micro or craft brewer. Anyways, yes, pours a pale golden color, smells very citric, some floral hops and some faint malts. This is a very solid, yet middle ground IPA. It delivers that citric punch, not much pine, and a good baseline maltiness, reminiscent of the style. Faint alcohol in the nose....and somewhat heavy, for an IPA. Could even be an double IPA, and 6.5% abv, so drinkability, is wee bit heavy. What can I say, a solid entry, very true to the style of a west coast IPA, but not breaking too much ground in originality IMO. Pick this one up if you want a solid American hop fix, but take a chance on freshness, cause these are not bottle dated from what i can read.","Star80","Sep 07, 2010"

A light nectar citrus character fills the nose for the most part before this opens up to a sharp, tingly sweet mouthfeel that makes way toward a big and juicy bitter center.

Aromas of lemon and other citrus, as well as hops, which had a certain funkiness to it (not unpleasant) that may be the earthiness that other reviewers noted. It drinks clean and dry, with relatively mild citrus hop flavors and some sweet maltiness in the background. Good carbonation and mouthfeel.

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - This is a very nice IPA. Looks great and smells even better, but it really shows its quality in the flavor. Pine hops dominate the first impression of the beer, but fade to a very nice, pithy grapefruit by the finish. There is a great deal of malt sweetness here, and this is really my only complaint. While the malt helps to balance out the strong hops, it is just a bit excessive and makes the hop character seems a little medicinal by the end of the bottle. I think a slightly dryer finish would probably allow the hops to shine even more and also make for a more drinkable beer.","nickfl","Mar 19, 2010"

This was my first beer from a cask, at the bar I got the explanation of what exactly that entails. I couldn't pinpoint exactly what differences there were. My guess is that the hoppiness of the beer was affected because the yeast was still fermentating, which is why it was so smooth.","fjordhook","Jan 31, 2010"

Dogfish 60 surprisingly was too bitter--that was the dominant and only flavor. Racer 5 didn't have enough citrus to balance the bitter as well, but it was not as one-dimensional as Dogfish 60.

The hops a flowery without being overbearing about it, but until it warms, I guess that's all I'm going to get. I will say that the balance on this is nice, with just the right amount of hops and a solid sweet malt base. The mouth feel is good and a bit sticky, trailing behind on the tongue a little bit.

Thin head that fades fast, leaving a thinner layer of bubbly on top. A few areas of lace. The first thing I smell is lemons, which is good because I like lemons. Nice hop presence in the nose as well. The taste...wow...very bitter...almost like chewing on a lemon rind. The lemony bitterness dominates the hops that are trying to come though. It almost makes me want to grind my teeth. The taste needs more hops and better balance. It's a medium mouthfeel that goes down easy, aside from the bitter aftertaste. I'll finish the six pack but can't see myself buying this again, though I'd drink it if it were there.","mtbbaboon","Sep 18, 2009"

The carbonation is not over the top or overly flat; it has perfect carbonation for an American style IPA. The taste remained loyal to the smell; it was crisp and refreshing. This I.P.A had very mild malty bite, which allowed the flavors of the hops to be showcased. There was a slight citrus sourness followed by a moderate bite of hops. This belongs like Stone IPA in the ranks of America's best I.P.A's. I cannot find anything really to complain about, concerning the beer.

The feel is relatively light with a nice effervescent, seltzery carbonation that makes it a real treat to drink. A really good IPA doesn't need to be over the top on the hop end of the spectrum to be really good, and that is what we have here, a well made beer that hits the spot with a nearly perfect balance of flavors.

There are some other earlthy/grassy flavors going on also. Nose could be a bit more aromatic, but then again, I've been off calibration from all the hopped up imperial IPA I've consumed.

This is a well balanced beer with substance and texture. The medium bodiedness, the creamy biscuity malts, and the dry hop leaf really complement each other.

Pours a golden straw color with a half finger of white head. Lacing sticks all over the sides of the glass. Smell is floral and citrus hops, like oranges and grapefruit. Taste is citrus hops up front but die down quickly to light dry biscuit malts. Taste leaves the tongue quickly and makes me want another drink. Light dry mouthfeel that lightly parches the tongue. Good drinkabilty, I could drink this beer all day long. Not my first choice for an IPA but a solid offering from Avery that I will likely drink again.","dakid618","Feb 26, 2009"

I poured it into my tulip glass and a sturdy, thick light tan head formed above the dark orange brew. I have a weak nose, but not picking up much in the aroma catagory. Maybe a little of the hops goodness. How to describe the taste? The malt seems to have a slight caramel sweetness to it. The hops has this almost tobacco-like, leafy, herbal grassy quality. Maybe a little grapefruit peel in there as well. Liked the balance between the malt and the hops, with more malt than you'll find in most IPA's. Decent amount of malt gives it a slightly creamy mouth feel and it's a very smooth brew for all that's going on here. Look foreward to my next one.","RunDWP","Feb 24, 2009"

The flavor consisted of grapefruit juice, spicy hops, and a trace of caramel malt. Quite bitter on the tongue, but still very drinkable.

To expand a bit more on the flavour, the beer has a unique hop character that is pretty strong, but behind it is the malts, which almost give a nice toasty flavour to the beer. Extremely tasty IPA.

Definitely one of my favorite IPAs.; very refreshing and highly drinkable. Definitely a great choice for any hophead.","mrsoul12","Jul 30, 2008"

A hint of caramel sweetness to balance and then a nice biscuity malt flavor rides in for the finish. Mouthfeel isn't as lively or bitter as you'd expect.

Nose was too mild, a touch of citrusy hops but not much else. Taste was a little better, although still a fairly subdued flavor. Citrus and fruity hops working fairly well with the very subtle caramel hops. Body was solid with good carbonation.

That being said, they work well in this beer. There's some orange peel mixed in that has some subtle fruity sweetness to it.

Mouthfeel is ok, not watery but not full bodied either. Very crisp, the sweetness is not cloying or annoying in any way. Very pleasant and drinkable and nicely balanced but not a typical American IPA. As good a session beer as the 6.3 abv allows. Just not a hop-heads IPA.","JayQue","Dec 23, 2007"

3.71,-3.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Smells of subtle sweetness with a floral bouquet of bitter hops. Nose is more hops than anything. The taste surprised me. Seems nothing like the nose in this beer. Starts off sweet and malty and gets fruity & citrusy hop flavors coming through afterwards, finishing pretty dry. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, and dry finish. I would rank this beer pretty drinkable. There are a good amount of IPA's that I would grab first but this one is definitely no slouch.","Doomcifer","Dec 17, 2007"

Citrus hops rise to the fore, with a good deal of bitter smooth taste. Impossible to miss the hops in this, a plus. The texture was overall smooth, but with a somewhat bitter and, dare I say, chalky mouthfeel that somewhat diminished my excitement. Still, a fine IPA well worth having, and again, a fine product from the wonderland of Avery.","Gehrig","Nov 17, 2007"

It smelled very strongly of hops. Quite citrusy and a little malty. The taste was real nice and malty sweet, just a bit more bitter than what I was expecting. It left a sweet aftertaste. Over all it was a really good beer and would have it again.","t0rin0","Nov 15, 2007"

There is a bit of pine in the mix as well as a hint of soil or something earthy like that... The taste, is much more floral than the smell, but still citrusy. A medium body, moderately carbonated, kind of sticks in the mouth though. It's a good, refreshing beer, but there are much better IPAs out there, much better session beers too...

Smell is grapefruit and a slight whiff of pine in the background. Mouthfeel is mostly grapefruit in the hops aroma and some malt balance. More balanced than a lot of other IPAs but the hop heads should rejoice at the wonderfully hoppy taste here for an IPA. Very smooth carbonation makes this a delicious IPA.","genog","Sep 09, 2007"

One of the best tasting American IPA's, rich rich floral hop flavor as you first taste the brew, then the toasty malt, and finally the perfectly bitter finish. An exceptionally well rounded beer, however it is pretty strong, perhaps not the best choice for someone new to the style.

Pours a bright copper / orange color with a decent chill haze that never went away and superb, frothy head retention that was just off from white, but stood firm to the bottom of the glass. The aromas are a mouth watering blend of toasted barley malt and citrus hops. Flavors are full and juicy, comprised of light caramel, bready, orange peel, lemon grass, and ruby red grapefruit. A touch of pine, yeast, and tartness rounded out the brew. The trick here is balance -- of course the hops shine, but not without keeping in check with the strong malt backbone, and creamy texture.

Taste is more powerful on the floral side than the citrus/pine side. I see a similarity in taste to the Harpoon IPA. But once again that smokey-ness comes through on the taste as well. This could be coming from the malt which helps the balance quite well. Carbonation is constant but minimal. Mouthfeel is dry but enjoyable. Drinkability is there, I really enjoy this brew.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, very enjoyable. Overall I must say that this is an excellent IPA, not the most extreme mind you, but very well done and drinkable.

This Avery beer was a clear almost pale gold color with a nice 1 finger soft white pillowy head of foam that had excellent retention. It left behind some foamy rings, a small skim of foam, and tons and tons of white sticky lace around the glass. I thought the aroma was way too soft. It need to be more pungent. All it had was just a trace of grapefruit and a hint of citrus hops. And those only came out when it was warmed up. There was nothing when it was cold. It improved a great deal in the taste. It started off with a small hint of toasted malts and then went directly to a bare knuckle grapefruit punch to the tastebuds. After that I detected only a trace of citrus hops and a few citrus fruits and that's all folks. That grapefruit punch was just so strong that no other flavors could come out to shine by themselves. It had a slight aftertaste of grapefruit to it, but at that time, I could tell that the grapefruit gave everything it could give in the initial taste. Overall, a very nice slightly above average grapefruity IPA and it's something I would to like have again on-tap or in a bottle.","AltBock","Apr 06, 2007"

Decent-looking one-finger head that settled down nicely and left a bit of lace on the glass as I drank it. Wow, the aroma is not at all what I was expecting (and who knows what that was). Very malty and sweet, I almost get a strawberry sensation from this smell. I really like it, but it's unlike most IPAs I've had. The flavor is also not like most IPAs. Heavy malt content here, and the hops don't really make a presence until the end (and even then they're a bit subdued). Slight citrus hints here as well, but mostly a very pleasant sweet maltiness is in charge. Sturdy mouthfeel for sure. A clever IPA from Avery, in my opinion. It's not phenomenal, and it's not a hop-head's dream come true, but it is a mighty fine beer on the whole. I could easily see making this part of my weekly repertoire if I lived in the Boulder area.

Medium to medium high carbonation. Aromas of light floral hops and earthy spices. Some sweet cherry liquorice as well. Taste was medium bodied, what I would call a budding hop-heads intro to IPA's. A touch of sweet bready malt quickly gives way to bitter hops and clove like spices. Mildly lingering bitterness is noted. Mouthfeel was eagerly bubbly. Drinkability is good. A solid IPA for sessioning, although it doesn't offer much in originality or creativity. Worth trying.","Frozensoul327","Aug 14, 2006"
3.47,-9.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"This IPA pours a dark yellow/copper body with a 11/2 finger white head. Carbonation was present in the body of this beer. The beer gave off a strong hoppy aroma that was close a pine tree smell. I could only pick up very little hints of malts in the smell. The taste was mainly of the pine tree-esque hops but like the smell there was a slight sweet spot in the middle of the taste. The beer was a thin beer that finished semi-dry. It had a little to much of the residual sugars for my liking of this style of beer. It wasn't bad but nothing that I would write home about.","cproioi","Aug 14, 2006"

3.83,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"In my opinion, when a really bitter, hoppy brew is a success, it is so not by virtue of the hops alone, but the other balancing aspects as well. Avery's regular IPA seemed a bit out of balance. Looked great, a nice golden hue with frothy, clinging head and good retention. Smelled decent, though the characteristic IPA aroma seemed just a bit subdued. Taste was good and by comparison to many other weak, puny IPA's, this guy is great, but like I said before, the bitter hops seemed a bit out of balance (don't get me wrong, Stone's Ruination is one of my favorite beers). Interestingly enough, I seem to remember the Maharaja as being out of balance in terms of it's alcoholic traits. Here, there wasn't enough interest from the other characteristics. It surprised me and did not go that well with my Indian dinner. This one's right up there, but a few tiers beneath the top.","BabaJohn","Aug 11, 2006"

Aromas are heavy on American hops with lots of resinous pine and grapefruit. Flavor comes just shy of meeting the promise of the aroma. Hop flavor is aplenty with a decent malty sweet backbone, but the bitterness doesn't meet my demands. This is certainly above your run of the mill IPA's but it doesn't quite compete with the upper tiered ones. It's nice to open a single that can't be got in town, drinkability is excellent.","dreadnatty08","Aug 07, 2006"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Light copper in color this IPA poured out with a one-finger cap that disappated rather quickly; light lacing clings to the glass. Lots of citrus on the nose most predominately grapefruit. Flavors feature a touch of biscuity malt up front but the grapefruit bitterness of the hops soon take over for a bitter middle and end. Nothing over the top though. Nice graininess in the mouthfeel, with a medium, slightly resinous body. This is a straight up sessionable IPA, probably Avery's finest mainline beer.","unclederby","Aug 06, 2006"

There were a lot of hops in this don't get me wrong, but they were much more "balanced" with pine resin and floral hop flavors as well as some citrus characters, but nothing over the top.

The duration of this dryness in the finish was alarming, but not entirely unpleasant. Hop burps revealed a fruitiness that I didnt detect elsewhere. The mouth feel was medium bodied with a light unobtrusive carbonation, but it left a bit of a film in my mouth on the finish.

A sip starts with twangy citris hop that carries on strongly throughout leaving a wonderful, long-lasting finish. Midway through Avery IPA becomes sweeter as the tasty underlying malts make their presence felt. Bitterness seems to increase towards the finish along side a new dry hop flavor.

But like a young red wine, it definitely mellowed and opened up a minute or two after poured Its hop and alchol content make it as stirdy beer and excelent example of an IPA. Pours a deep yellow, with a decent white head that remained almost as long a the beer. Its aroma is slightly piney, feels effervescent in the mouth and finises with a bitter but floral hop flavor.","Bcant","Aug 26, 2005"

4.63,20.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Tastes divine. Hoppy flavors nicely balanced with, perhaps dominating, the hop bitter and supported by an underlying sweet. Wonderful burp, iron and grapefruit pith. Second taste starts grapefruit pith with oranges. The swallow is all oranges with hop bitter and some co-humulone roughness. The oranges settle leaving a rough aftertaste in the back of the throat with a malt sweet persisting on the flat of my tongue, as well as a hint of grapefruit pith. Ha, and I thought this beer would be a quickie 3.8 session beer review. Okay, so the hops are oranges, grapefruit pith, a bit of iron, and some tangerine. Searching for esters I get very little, maybe some apricot. BTW, it's been at least 15 minutes (the beer is warmed) and there is still a half finger of head. What else to look for...malts. Malts are much beneath the hops but provide a sweetness that fill the beer. A hint of honey. Alcohol flavor and burn is absent. Md body, but really lusious and velvety in the mouth. Carbonation is md-heavy, a bit too much, IMO. Lacing on the inside of my glass is astounding. It's a sheet of white bubble plastered on the far side of my glass. Drinkable?...yes. I'm a beer explorer and just don't see the purpose of trying a beer a second time. Honestly, I suspect I'll stop into the brewery to pick up this beer on my way home from work enough to make it a semi-regular in my life. Thank goodness the brewery is on the road between work and home.","mentor","Aug 13, 2005"
4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"A good solid IPA for sure. The beer looked great with a great fluffy white head on top of a nice light amber colored brew. The smell was quite hoppy and fruity as well, with nice pinnapple notes and a healthy dose of Cascade in there as well. The flavor reminded me alot of the local AleSmith IPA which I know very well. The beer had a great bite to it and it was balanced well with the malts, but it had a little too much bread-y flavor in the finnish for me. All in all I think it is a very strong IPA, but not that unique in the scheme of things.","Dmann","Aug 12, 2005"

Head is nice and large, though, about 3/4", which fades slowly. Nice fruity/piney hop smell, which really ndominates the nose, spot on. Taste also has a considerable amount of hop presence, but does have just a tinge of the mleted plastic flavor that is in some IPAs, but not enough to take away from the pleasant flavor.

It delivers in a staccato fashion, which is manageable when the components have more character, but here it's just muddled. That said, it's not totally without its merits. In spite of the stop-and-go delivery, it is nonetheless crisp, drying the palate nicely, as it should.

This one poured a light orange/golden with a very nice frothy white head although a large percentage of the bubbles were soapy looking. Aroma is obviously hop-centric. I get a mix of citrus and pine. Taste is very crisp and clean with that nice edginess of hops. Some caramel tasting malt lies in the background. Good drinkability. This is not a blow the doors off type IPA but a session type IPA that matches up great with the BBQ chicken pizza that I'm having for dinner (yeah for college diets).

After that look, the rest of the beer was something of a comedown. The aroma was lightly hopped with lots of biscuity malts. The flavor itself is kind of weak for the style. All of the hallmarks are in there: grapefruity hops, solid malt backbone, and a little bite, but they're all pretty subdued and nothing really catches your imagination. Overall, a decent enough brew that won't destroy your palate, but there's easily dozens of American IPAs out there that are much more creative and interesting than this one.","whartontallboy","Feb 20, 2005"

Its got a little of the dirty old sock smell to it. I'm not so impressed here. The flavor is better than the nose would say, but I would put this as an APA over an IPA.

Taste is has a bit of a malt start, but that quickly is overpowered by the hops character, which seems to be more bitterness, and less the pine and citrus notes portended in the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit too to clunky with its hops character, in my mind, and drinkabilty suffers the same. But if you're in the MORE HOPS party, this will probably be more appreciated by you. Enjoyable, yes, but could be more so.","ppoitras","Jan 11, 2005"

I poured the 12oz single into my trusty Sierra Nevada tumbler pint. The brew is perfectly clear, the body amber with a hint of straw color. The pour resulted in an aggressive, sticky, white head, nice strands of lace and great retention. The nose is great. The hops are green, juicy, leafy, citrussy, piney and sticky, the full compliment of a great IPA, these aromas are of course backed up with a respectable sweet malt backbone which combined with the hops is reminiscent of a ripe juicy cherry. Up front its lightly sweet and slick, quickly though the bitterness of the large dose of hops takes hold, not bitter enough to hurt you but assertive. In the finish the bitterness fully unfurls and is accompanied mainly by citrus flavors, but a nice dollop of pine sap as well which retains a lovely after-taste. Very well balanced, in that IPA kind of way. Is there alcohol in this? I sure cant taste it. Mouthfeel is good, but maybe a tad on the light side.

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Lighter in color than many IPAs nowadays, it is a coppery gold hue with a hint of tawny influences. Really tiny bubbles raced towards the off-white head, this added a little life to the beer. The foam reached two fingers in height; it slowly faded to a rocky, soapy cap, a half finger in height. Lacing started before any liquid was removed, I always love to see that! Once I started drinking the beer subsequent lacing really flourished. Attractive. The nose is hoppy. Fairly raw with citrus acid infused with pine combs and spruce. Grapefruit rinds are secondary and these play with a sugary sweetness. Minimal malt influences, only hints of caramel, very weak throughout. Potency is solid, plenty of juice, suggestions of alcohol, kind of hot, raw too. I like the nose; it is no more extraordinary than many really good IPAs. Inviting. The palate is very enjoyable; upfront is a soft, sprucey influence with pine needles and some malt sweetness. The middle is hoppy, assertive but not out of whack, grapefruit rinds, lemon zest, leafy, kind of dry. Then the finish flashes quickly, a juicy burst of malt and acidic hops, some alcohol, some hints of mint leaves. Pleasant. The aftertaste is dry and bitter. This would really play nice with some sharp cheddar cheese or burgers. It is an IPA and the hops are the focal point, as well they should be, but its not some crazy, raw, hop bomb. It is a really well brewed American IPA. Once warm, a very lovely, sweetness develops but the hops, in turn, fade. Oh, well. Medium/medium-full in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is solid, while its nothing special it is very pleasant. Incredibly drinkable. A well crafted hoppy beer from Avery? Who knew they had it in them? Id gladly buy a six-pack, sit back, and quaff! I purchased a 12-ounce bottle in Brookfield, WI. Recommended. I want more.","bditty187","Nov 14, 2004"

Thin cream colored head and just a light lace are left on the glass. Brewers from the Denver area seem to get the nose right on an IPA. This has a bright floral hop character with just a hint of citrus, maybe some pine. The taste has a delicate bitterness in the front accented by the floral characters that were on the nose. No real malt to speak of, nor is this beer accented by alcohol. It is truly defined by the hops used in the brew. It has a great silky smooth mouth feel, and I can drink may of these fine beers.

Definitely characterized by the hops though. Mouthfeel is pretty good, but not the strongest characterization of this offering.

2.77,-28.1,3.5,1.5,3,4,3,"Dark and cloudy, looks kind of like unfiltered heavy apple cider. Strong hop taste but not overpowering, not too complex as you can't really taste much except the hops (maybe a wee bit of malt), smooth and drinkable however it hits you with a bit of a delayed aftertaste, heavily bitter. A good beer, except for...the smell. I'm sure it's just me, and I tried to stay objective on this, but the smell of these hops reminded me of a cat-piss stain we used to have in the corner of our living room in San Diego. Smells like ammonia, or as CheeseWheel put it "an old man's couch after too many accidents." Mouthfeel was great, more noticeable probably since I was holding my nose. I tried to shake this but just couldn't, it really detracted from my drinking experience but hopefully not yours, if you are a hop-head that picks this up and thinks it smells great you'll probably like it.","PopeJonPaul","Aug 15, 2004"

However, what was surprsing was that for its rather pale color, it was quite hoppy. Very bitter and biting. Also hints of citrus were hanging around the beer. My only complaint was that it was very cold when served and the flavors only improved as the beer warmed up. Not so much a fault of the brewer as the bar manager.","MuddyFeet","Jul 29, 2004"

Picked up a couple bottles in LA last week, now I'm wishing I'd picked up many more. Pours out a bronzey color, just a bit of orange tint, and capped with a very long lasting pure white head. Aroma is dripping with pine sap and grapefruit. Taste is bitter, bitter, and oh did I mention bitter? This IPA is a hophead's dream, with loads of fresh brutal piney hop flavor assaulting you from all directions. A few grapefruits bouncing around in there too. A decent amount of malt sweetness through the middle helps balance this one a bit, but my taste buds are already more than subdued by the hops. Very impressive, very drinkable IPA in my opinion, but very bold in the hop bitterness department.","mikeys01","Jun 21, 2004"

The beer appears to be very clear, with very minimal haze, and a light amber color. What it lacks in head, however, it more than makes up for in aroma. Wonderful hoppy aroma, very floral/citrus. The taste is very nice as well, extremely hoppy, with crisp snappy bites of hops, and a minimal understated note of malts laying a nice base.

What strikes me about it is the bitterness. Not overwhelmingly bitter, but it does take a while for the malt to smooth it out. It does have a fairly complex taste, one that I'm unaccustomed to. Hmmm. Not too sure about this one.","ChappyCubsFan","Apr 06, 2004"

The hops left a nice grassy aroma which was noticable but not so strong that it burns out the nostrils. The maltiness was present in the nose but at a low level. The grapefruit taste of the hops comes through loud and clear but does not completely overpower the malts. The malt sweetness acts as a counterpoint to the hop bitterness so that this beer is properly balanced IPA. This beer's body was a little light for style. The hops and sweetness do play on the roof of my mouth and the carbonation tingles my tongue. Overall, I would say this in one of the better IPAs I have drank. None of the ingredients kill the others. A fine beer.","LarryKemp","Apr 04, 2004"
3.66,-4.9,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Poured with a golden amber body that displayed a slight chill haze. The head was initially about an inch thick and creamy, and settled down to a carpet of bubbles and left a good amount of lace going down. Lively carbonation was quite nice. The aroma was pretty mild for an IPA, with a floral, delicate hop smell that reminded me more of a Pilsner. Taste was very balanced with caramel malts, sweet and tart citric tones, and spicy to floral hop bitterness. It lacked the quintessential bite of an IPA, but was a very pleasant experience. Medium creamy mouthfeel with a dry aftertaste. An easy drinking IPA that has enough complexity to keep things interesting.","rajendra82","Apr 01, 2004"

Finish is pesky in its acidity; the hops steal the show with their spiciness, droughty aftertaste that lingers on the palate, WOW!

Taste however throws a curveball at me, much more pronounced grapefruit like characteristics with the finish containing almost no malt sweetness but the rind of a citrus fruit overly bitter in the finish lacking the balance I search for and adore.

Great malt flavor that accompanies the hoppy flavor and bitterness. A malty sweet flavor with hints of biscuits and caramel malts. Quite a lingering bitterness in the finish. A good solid IPA, not quite over the top, which is good because you don't always want that. There is a ton of balanced flavors in this beer.

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a very good IPA. I will always be pleased to see this in my glass. It is reassuring to see a great IPA brewed in a standard 12 ounce bottle. Well done.","Darkale","Jun 12, 2003"
4.02,4.4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Well, not really. But that may as well have been the case. It pours light, and it's got a nice, lingering white head (the lacing clung to the side of the glass through the whole beer). But the hallmark here is the huge citrus aroma and taste. An obviously hop-derived fruit/floral aroma makes way for a bitter grapefruit taste that really exemplifies the analogy that's used so often with IPAs. Very strong with hints of other hop characters -- scotch pine, herbal tea, flowers. A little grating to the senses though and a bit hard for non-hopheads to drink many in a row. Nonetheless, it's a solid and very drinkable brew.","marburg","Jun 10, 2003"
4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A dull orange with little head and no lacing, has a large based cascade hops aroma, some citrus on the nose as well. Taste dominated by hops, but not overpowered, blend of sweet grapefruit, some orange peel, and some malt undertones. Well rounded for an IPA, not overly hopped, but presence felt nicely. Creamy and tasty, above average IPA.","GeoffRizzo","Jun 07, 2003"

4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a copper gold color and formed a foamy white head that left some lace as it subsided. There was a small amount of carbonation present. The aroma was of hops and citrus. The flavor was of hops and of what I would call citrus rind, which is a interesting characteristic of the hops that leads to slightly burnt/bitter finish.","Wildman","May 21, 2003"
4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Just a slight penalty in my book for the persistent bitterness in the aftertaste. It really hung around and puckered me up. Overall, an very good beer, though not my favorite, and one that I would still drink frequently.","OldFrothingSlosh","Apr 28, 2003"
4.27,10.9,4.5,5,4,4,4,"This one pours a clear dark gold tinged orange with a pillowy head that has a moderate life span and settle to thin lacing on top. The nose is a piney spicy hops that are very strong. This heavily hopped IPA is just damn good. The mouthfeel is pillowy and soft which helps to balance the extreme hops. Very enjoyable and very complex flavors here. The hops are so strong you almost miss the sweet malt underneath.","AtrumAnimus","Apr 19, 2003"
3.13,-18.7,3.5,3,3,4,3,"Pours a clear pale yellow/orange color with a small white head that lingers for quite a while. It has a strong powder-dry hop citrusy/lemony smell. Im not certain it is, but it smells like it. After first taste, I would nearly go out on a limb and say it is definitely dry-hopped IMO. The taste consists of hops, hops, and then tapers into hops. Then you can taste a little bit of a dry grapefruit flavor after the hops die down. But this is waaayyyy after! It is light bodied and finishes ultra-dry. You almost need a thirst quencher after each swallow because it leaves your palate so dry. Is there powder in here? Hop powder no less ;-) It is a serious IPA in the hop category, but it lacks in complexity. I love hops, but I like to taste other things too. Different! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Apr 07, 2003"

Nose is strong floral hops with some citrus notes. Light to medium in body with the hop oils creating a bit of a slick (yet also a bit sticky) mouthfeel. Taste is bitter, bitter, bitter! Loads of raw hop leaf flavors, hop resins and tannins, and notes of grapefruit rind. Bone dry finish. This stuff is very addicting and would make a great session IPA.","Morris729","Feb 20, 2003"

3.55,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Golden orange in color with a touch of haze, modest but quite dense cloudtop head develops slowly but retains well. Carbonation is slight; lace is thick and broken. The aroma exhibits the expected strong grapefruit hop characteristic, with hints of malt beneath, although these are forcefully subdued by the hops. Taste begins with a momentary fruit sweetness, which is quickly vanquished by the intensely bitter grapefruit hop and pinesap flavors. Towards the finish the malt manages to assert itself for a moment, but is completely overwhelmed by a wave of intense bitterness, which lingers long beyond the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy. Although it is not to my taste, this is a well-crafted IPA which will doubtless appeal to hopheads.","Pegasus","Feb 05, 2003"

4.21,9.4,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Orange amber in color, it pours slightly hazy with a very nice head that displays excellent retention. No noticable carbonation trails in the beer give it a very rich appearance. As the head fades, it leaves a layer of foam typically found in malty brews. The aroma is very hoppy, with distinct citrus characteristics mixed with a hint of rose florals and a touch of sweetness that almost conjures up the image of bright pink bubble gum. On the tongue, the malt character of this beer is strong, with noticable sweetness evident through the balanced hoppiness. The finish is noticably bitter and very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very creamy, with minimal carbonation. The only astringency is from the liberal dose of hops. The drinakbility is excellent due to the balance of the flavor. This is no hop-heads IPA. It is one for the masses of ale lovers everywhere. A solid, everyday IPA that should become a staple in my liquid diet.","aaronh","Jan 24, 2003"
4.17,8.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A very enjoyable IPA. Pours out to a dark gold, almost amber color in the glass. Aroma is that of grapefruit. Mostly hops in the taste, as per the style, but remarkably balanced. Nice hoppy finish. This would be a good session IPA and a decent choice for someone looking to try the India Pale Ale style.","proc","Jan 11, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Hmmm - an English or American style IPA? This one seemed to fall in the middle. More malty and a little less hoppy than the American version, but the hops were a little more pungent and busy than the English. Verdict - a mid-Atlantic IPA, and a tasty beer to boot. Good body and solid grapefruity, slightly floral hops. Very drinkable, and at 6% abv you can line a few of these up and still navigate afterward.","Brent","Jan 05, 2003"
4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another nice big hoppy I.P.A., just the way I like 'em. Golden in color, a little hazy and slightly evervescent. Aggressive hop flavor and a little sour in the finish.

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A new offering from the beer gods at the local liquor warehouse, and a pretty darn good IPA.  Clear golden color, better head than many and a fair amount of lace down the side of the glass.  Decidedly hoppy, but I didn't get the strong citrusy flavor that some reviewers have mentioned and which tends to turn me off.  The citrus that I sensed was well balanced with floral notes.  Good carbonation on top of all this yielded a very, very drinkable IPA.  Oh yeah, and I really liked the label, too.","BKotch","Aug 30, 2002"

I like it well enough luckily it isn't totally over the top on the hop bitterness (although it is on the flavor) not being a total hop head I still prefer the Lagunitas Maximus but this one rate very well in my book.","mattmaples","Jun 08, 2002"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden with a nice creamy white head.  Smell is all hops, insane floral and citrus (grapefruit) aromas.  The first sip is like taking a big bite out of a grapefruit.  Insane hoppiness.  Very slight malt balance, but no actual malt flavors.  Super clean and dry finish and very drinkable.  Nice IPA.  A must for hop heads.  Insanely hopped.  Definitely very drinkable though and a great session brew as most of the beers in this style are.","Murph","May 26, 2002"
3.84,-0.3,3,4,4,3,4,"I really enjoy this IPA.  It's got a light amber hue and a classic Cascade hop profile all around.  The nose is all citrus, the flavor is citrusy and the bitterness is right on for an American IPA.  Although Cascades shine in this brew, the sometimes overbearing grapefruity nature of many AIPAs isn't present in this brew.  Avery hopped this one well. It could use a tad bit more malt and body, but that's just me.  I like malty IPAs.  Still-- I could drink this all day and be quite satisfied.","marc77","Feb 27, 2002"
