4.34,3.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear deep golden color with about a inch of foam. Foam dissipates to leave very nice lacing of the glass. Smell is faint, but very nice...featuring tropical fruits, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is of citrus and tropical fruits, leaving a very pleasant hoppy after taste. Mouth feel is lightly carbonated and extremely smooth. Overall an outstanding IPA.","TBCE","Apr 05, 2015"

4.56,8.8,5,4,4.75,5,4.5,"The smell is tropical and piney - it has a wonderful aroma, I just wish it was more pungent. It doesn't jump out of the glass like some other IPAs do. I actually think the taste was better than the smell. It has a very tropical fruity aftertaste, with some subtle grapefruit and pine. Not very bitter and I enjoy this beer more and more as it warms up. I will definitely buy it again, as a bomber was only $4.99 here.","ElJacobian","Apr 03, 2015"

Any critique would be maybe a tad bit more carbonation, but this is me nitpicking (plus I like over-carbonated beers). Also it is just a tad bit thick, nothing crazy, again just nitpicking. I would pair this with a grilled chicken breast with a nice salad with a citrus vinaigrette. It gets a 94/100.","DaverCS","Mar 05, 2015"

That being said, I had heard some pretty high praise of this beer and I don’t know that I completely vibe with that. Good drinkability, good full flavor, but I was looking for a juicier palate. Overall, I like this beer, and I like it better warmer.","ZagZagg","Jul 27, 2014"

Orange/citrus hop aroma with pine, somewhat subdued, with Chico yeast twang. Little malt character. More pine as it opens up. Tastes similar to its aroma, then almost pine-sol like hops burst through after initial balance. Aggressive bitterness, long hoppy finish. Medium-full mouthfeel. I would love a little more hop aroma and slightly less bitterness, and less of the yeast character.","natron002","Jul 24, 2014"

4.12,-1.7,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a cloudy orange-gold with a thin white head that left slight lacing. A good looking IPA. Scents of pine resin, cedar, slight citrus, tropical fruit and sweet malt, a bit of an onion-like off-aroma as well, possibly an old or otherwise improperly kept bottle. Otherwise not bad. Taste begins with grapefruit, orange and nectarine, along with citrus peel, moves into a bit of nice pine resin and finishe swith bitter pine resin and citrus peel. A nice malt sweetness, caramel mostly, is also present throughout. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly grainy, with hints of caramel. The flavor is quite nice, not the most hop forward, nor the most malt heavy IPA, but it strikes a good balance and has a nice flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, an oily feel upfront and a sticky feel later. Quite good, very easy to drink and pleasant feeling. Overall this is an excellent IPA with a good flavor profile, mouthfeel and scent. I just wish the store had kept the bottle in a cooler so it didn't get that onion off-note in the aroma. Otherwise a solid IPA.","Auraan","Mar 02, 2014"

The flavor is surprisingly deep and complex. Lots of hop bitterness up front but quickly followed by a rich malty sweetness. If this was the intention of the brewers than I say bravo. I think this beer may have sat on the shelf a little longer than normal but it seems to have turned it into an even better, more balanced ale than was originally intended. Its just unfortunate that Bear Republic has pulled out of Michigan. I'll miss this and Hop Head Rye.","lochef81","Feb 25, 2014"

Much like the Toronto Mayor, this one will knock you down if you are not careful! The look and the smell are just as intoxicating as the brew itself. I would like to proclaim that it possesses the perfect I.P.A. aroma! I love the racer theme bottle and pretty much everything about this beer...except for the price unfortunately. It is definitely worth ten dollars for a six pack, but just as much as steak dinner is worth the price, it is not practical to have all of time. This is worthy of being called the steak dinner of beers, and I would highly X 5 recommend it.","Isrealite","Dec 24, 2013"

Nice aromas of pine and citrus, but also biscuit, caramel and herbal tones. Upfront flavors of butterscotch, herbs, leather and grapefruit. Finishes with a hint dried apricot, citrus and some resiny notes that are less than pleasing. Noticeably higher alcohol content. There are some significant herbal flavors in this beer that don't seem to work too well. I was expecting a traditional IPA, but this is maltier and not as strongly hopped. Creamy mouthfeel that leaves a syrupy coating on the tongue. Not your typical IPA, and not the best IPA I've had. Not a bad beer, but it's almost as if this beer can't decide what it's supposed to be.","Maltenbach","Nov 23, 2013"

Pine is also the first thing I tasted followed by malty caramel. Then the bitterness took over. It totally dried out my mouth and tongue. A little too much for my liking. But overall this is a pretty solid IPA.","WheelsPSU","Sep 11, 2013"

Hoppy aroma that tickles the nose and smells delicious. Citrusy, mostly grapefruit. A little resiny and has a slight malt sweetness to the smell as well. Smells nice, no doubt. On to taste, this is a real hop bomb IPA. A strong malt backbone fueling the 7% abv but the hops really dominate this brew. Bitter, but once the palate adjusts there is a bouquet of hoppy flavor packed into this beer. Fruity, grapefruity and some pine. A delicious IPA! but a definite hop head's brew. Light carbonation, bitter but very smooth, some resin in the aftertaste. Bottom line, I love this beer. As far as I'm concerned, It's a damn masterpiece!","CA_brewster","Aug 15, 2013"

A solid AIPA, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be. Very balanced though, with distinct hop flavors. I found this beer to be more of a slow sipper rather than something very drinkable that I wanted to reach for another when I was done. One was enough, but glad I tried it.","damndirtyape","Aug 11, 2013"

It has the hoppiness and bitterness to allow yourself to take in a real world class American ipa while letting you take big, flavorable drinks. I'd recommend this to anyone and this lets me automatically love Bear Republic. What a California gem this thing is. The highest of marks from me","BradtheGreat7","Jul 16, 2013"

Drank it out of the bottle and would explain it as bitterness that hits on the front and back but not too intensely. Can definitely smell and taste some piny hops with less citrus than some other ipas. I viewed it as a good session IPA and would buy again","alaimoa","Jul 08, 2013"

Smell is resiny hops with floral/citrus notes in the background, and lots of malt as well. Taste is delicious; hops hit first with bitter and fruity flavors, then smooth creamy clean malts come in and smooth everything over leaving just a bitter aftertaste. The bottle-conditioning really smooths this one out, the 7% is well-hidden and this is delicious.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 24, 2013"

It has a strong bitterness, though it's well balanced with a pretty heavy malt. It's at hoppier end of IPAs, though it isn't going to blow your head off.

Each IPA is often different in its own way, just like this one is different. This is worth trying BUT if it's not distributed to your state, there are plenty of other IPA's just as good if not better.

This is a nice, more balance IPA that probably appeals to a larger audience (though I admit the hops in any IPA are going to turn some people off.) That said, those of us on the west coast like to turn the hops up to 11, and in that regard this beer may seem as lacking. I'm sure it's a matter of preference, but I think I may have developed a Pavlovian response to my hops.","rringler","Feb 21, 2013"

Aroma is solid and enjoyable but not great and can get lost in the forest of great aromatic IPA aromas; juicy orange, its rind, doughy bread, and some grass. Flavor offers some nice sweet and juicy orange and its rind, some doughy bread, and a touch of some florals....so similar to aroma but a bit more filled out. A medium bodied, somewhat creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice IPA. I dig it.","denver10","Feb 12, 2013"

The lacing was like a steam of clinger-ons without rings. But whoa, the fragrance is my kind of IPA whereas the blast is complex and delightful grapefruit and piney resins. The taste is equally good. I love this beer. The price is right and the lack of alcohol presence is just mt style. Try this one soon.","Brian14608","Feb 04, 2013"

I could literally smell the hops radiating out of the bottle before I even popped the cap. Poured a nice goldenrod, somewhat cloudy, with a very small white head. Citrus, floral, and piney aromas really come through the nose, and are reflected in the taste, along with some subtle lemon and passionfruit. A nice west-coast style IPA that delivers complex bitterness, but is also nicely balanced by a nutty malt character that lends a fairly sweet caramel finish.","Fusion7777","Feb 01, 2013"

Beer stays covered all the way down. Fluid is a hazy stained oak color. Microfine carbonation continuously streaming up give a portent of the lovely feel. Smell is lightly bready with a mild caramel sweetness. Firm yeasty component is blanketed in hops. A citrus tinged light tropical fruit aroma as well. A dry graininess with a touch of sourness. Taste follows the nose. Light pale ale flavors are wrapped in a dry hoppiness. Pale malt and yeasty light bread. Dry grains and a faint orange flavor. Bit of biscuit. Dry hoppiness is tinged with both earth and citrus. Lovely dry finish leaves a trace of hop oil. Feel is crisp and light while not actually being a light beer. Dry and quenching with a perfect carbonation that lens itself to sessioning and refreshment. Wonderful drinkability that has you gulping the deliciousness. A superior American IPA.

Certainly has a lot of hop character, good bitterness, but without the citrus and malt, there is not much in the way of balance. Very drinkable for the 7% ABV, I dont usually go much beyond 7%, as I dont care for the alcohol to take over, I like it hidden in the beer.","eporter66","Nov 24, 2012"

Pours a golden color with fine sediment in suspension, two finger thick white head which settles to a quarter inch, leaving a few blobs of lace down the glass. Smell: biscuit, grapefruit, honey-ish + white grape sweetness, alcohol and dried tropical fruit notes. It's nice, but it's not Big. Taste: grapefruit with some herbal and vinous stuff going on, backed by pale malt sweetness. Lingering citrus peel oiliness, as well as a splash of booze. The feel is almost-creamy cut by booze, which is odd for only 7%. Drying finish.

Not ugly, just doesn't hold your attention that long. There is a grapefruit rind taste that lingers on the back and sides of the tongue...because it's an IPA. There is a very slight alcoholic zing with every third sip or so. Mouthfeel is meh. That bitterness lingers a bit too long. Overall - good for a 6-pack.

4.57,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Racer 5 pours a crystal-clear golden color with a light head that retains well. The aroma is a citrus bomb, this beer's got a heavy citrus nose, primarily grapefruit and tropical fruits. The taste is yet another burst of hop flavor, it's got the strong citrus from the nose hitting first along with a massive bitter presence that strikes after a few seconds. The malt hangs to the back, anchoring everything well while letting the hops shine. The aftertaste is a great, lingering bitter resinous hop. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, it drinks like an APA. The drinkability is amazing. Overall, Racer 5 is a top-tier IPA. It's just very satisfying and has a unique flavor profile that stands out from the pack.","shand","Oct 20, 2012"

More of a floral hops for me. This time the citrus and pineapple reveal themselves. I didn't notice this with bottles, but this keg was freshly tapped and obviously had never seen sunlight. Hops are also more prevalent. Malts seemed to ride in the backseat where they belong. I get some grapefruit on the back end along with an odd hint of vanilla. Felt nice in the mouth. Although this has let me down out of the bottle, the fresh draft was very good. I'd have to give this a Rachel Ray Yum-O.","alkemy","Oct 13, 2012"

The smell is sweet with strong tropical fruit hop smell. The taste is a spot-on balance of sweet maltiness and piney/tropical hop bitterness that sits just right, not too bitter and minimal bitter finish. It feels thick and chewy but not overbearing. It is truly an easy, smooth drinker with a slight resinous and oily feel to chew on. I gotta say I really like this one and will be the only IPA other than Pliny that I would actually purchase.","SnowFlowMfg","Oct 04, 2012"

Not an awfully strong nose, but this may be because I'm drinking it from a wine glass--I smell pale green tea, maybe a citrus note or two. Thank god we do not have an overblown hop-hammer here: this is an expert, discreet tasting, though full-bodied and strong, IPA, with citrus, pine (and not pine resin, which is what the ostentatious, begging to be Bad Ass think passes for IPA) vegetal flavors. A long semi-dry finish -- no, actually smoother at start and then fairly dry from mid to finish. No lingering estery chemically taste at all. Tastes like a totally natural beverage, not overhopped like some of its chemical panel kin. I'm a fan after just one. Thanks to the BevMo dude that recommended this as I was on my way to a sixer of Deschutes Inversion (another great IPA).","marcellaproust","Jul 06, 2012"

Bitterness does not sustain long but is there, somewhat muted, and appears modulated by the grain bill a bit. Not a 'nose forward' IPA.

Smell is all about the hops: grassy, herbal, earthy, and some slight citrus zest. Taste is mainly of grassy and herbal hops with a malt backbone to support everything. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good IPA but it features a hop profile that I am not all that crazy about.","WoodBrew","Apr 06, 2012"

Aromas of big pine, grapefruit, herbal, lemon, caramel, and toasted bread. Very nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, herbal, pine, light caramel, honey, spiciness, and toasted biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, herbal, citrus, and honey on the finish for a bit. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 7%, with only a slight alcohol warming after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPA offering.

4.45,6.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Orangey-amber colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, dense and lots of lace. Smell is loaded with hops, grapefruit, mange, tangerine, lots of citrus, some malt backbone, subtle notes of pine as well here. Taste is all citrus and fruit, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, tons of bitter hop, light sweet malts keep this from crossing the line of being over the top hoppy, light pine in the finish but gets overtaken by clean smooth citrus. Light-med carbonation, incredibly oily, medium body, slick all over the palate. This might be the best IPA I have ever had, if its not the best it has to be like top 2 anyway, no doubt about it I will drink this again and frequently.","peensteen","Feb 15, 2012"

Smell is all about the hops: grassy, herbal, earthy, and some slight citrus zest. Taste is mainly of grassy and herbal hops with a malt backbone to support everything. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good IPA but it features a hop profile that I am not all that crazy about.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 05, 2012"

Faced with literally hundreds of beers I hadn't sampled before, I was forced to only bring 12 home with me. Glad I chose Racer 5. Hands down this is the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Though not a hop-heads delight, this beer is incredibly smooth and balanced despite being very complex and having a rather high ABV of 7%. Hopefully I can find this beer in New Mexico as I would love to make it a staple in my fridge.

Smells of mixed tropical fruit, sweet pale malts, and a pungent bittering hop aroma. Taste follows the nose but definitely not as heavy on the palate as on the nose. Lighter body makes this brew seem quite sessionable, but I would recheck the abv on the bottle before doing so. Could use a bit thicker body but overall pretty solid IPA, but nothing to trade for imo - unlike some other Cali (D)IPAs.","hoptualBrew","Nov 09, 2011"

Happily surprised that it was at my local five napkin burger, I am ready to enjoy it with some tasty wings. The color is an opulent brass and although the head was thin(mainly from how the uneducated bartender poured it) it looks highly drinkable.

3.83,-8.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"O: Overall, this is a good IPA but nothing special. A nice appearance and aroma aren’t really backed up in the taste which to me comes off as generic and middle of the road. I will say though that you can’t beat the price (around $5 for a bomber) and I do plan on trying the Hop Rod Rye which most seem to agree is the best Bear Republic offering.","zac16125","Sep 28, 2011"

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Plenty of hops at Bliss today. This case-in-point pours a mostly clear sunrise golden-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet flowers, light grass, greens, grapefruit zest, orange zest, lemon peel, and a few drops of honey in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, withe the citrus and greens really complimenting each other quite nicely. The malt is almost completely drowned-out, but the hops somehow don't o'erpower the tongue, even though they easily could. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice, hop-forward IPA that doesn't strangle the 'buds with lupulin. Pretty damn enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Aug 28, 2011"

Loads of aromas of citrusy hops with just a tiny hint of roasted malts. It has a good sharp bite all the way through followed up with just enough sweet malts to smooth it out for a nice, crisp, clean finish with no harsh aftertaste; almost like a mixture of flavors of cotton candy and caramel lingering on the finish.

The hops are there in abundance and are pretty assertive and combine citrus, pine, and floral hops together to make for a great hop profile that is balanced well and doesn't completely overshadow the malt base like it did in the aroma. Everything was pretty spot on in this IPA and I liked the drinkability and mouthfeel the most with the rest being almost as good, if I had another one I would drink it, it hits the spot on this warm summer night. I would buy this beer again, I like how it combined the different aspects of hops together rather then just focusing one aspect. I recommend this beer to any hop head or IPA lover, it will calm your hop cravings. This was another home run for Bear Republic, now I feel like I have to try the rest of their lineup since everything I have had from them so far has been very well done.","StoutHunter","Jun 27, 2011"

The taste is balanced by a sweet malt backbone with hints of citrus. In the tail end of the beginning the rest of the way through there is an earthy hop bite, not a huge bitter bite, but a nice and smooth hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

The smell was a very mellow citrus smell, like OJ from concentrate at room temperature. I wasn't beaten over the head with the hops, and I liked it. When I drank it, the whole beer seemed balanced. It was one of the few times that I wasn't focused on one specific aspect of the beer, and that made it extremely drinkable.","Fillpott","May 27, 2011"

4.17,-0.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish color with some visible carbonation. Head is about 1 finger tall, retention is moderate, but it leaves some lacing. Smell is of sweet citrus with a bit of a floral smell. I am impressed with the taste of this beer, citrus is highlighted well while still retaining a malt balance. The floral and citrus hops come out at the beginning, but the citrus isn't sweet like the smell. Towards the end of the drinkni get some of that malt balance that helps regulate this beer so well. Mouthfeel is just below medium, and carbon is appropriate. Overall this is a good IPA, if I lived in Cali I'd definitely drink it regularly, but I've already got Portland beers.","gkunkle","May 22, 2011"

4.12,-1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this IPA is yummy. There is a considerable deviance fron the blossoming nose to a more two-dimensional flavor experience. The flavors aren't bad, just a bit narrow and restrictive. It reminds me of a terrific homebrew that I'd definitely scrounge a growler of. Very rustic and unrefined, but I believe this is the simple allure of this ale. I absolutely enjoyed it.","malty","May 01, 2011"

Not much malt smell getting through as expected. Surprised by a bit of nice floral hop in the taste. Warms the throat slightly but not boozy at all. Hop bitterness is dry but last for a long long time. A little astringent but in a good way. Pretty solid IPA and a good example of what this style should be.

4.24,1.2,4,5,4,4,4,"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the aroma. It was nectary sweet amongst a bouquet of flowers, with some oddities, like that spicy mustard seed. Unlike many others in the style, here the hops took a delicate back seat, making this more than the typical IPA. One criticism is that it was a bit on the sour end, but this ultimately didn’t take much away, but rather gave it another unique aspect for the style.","TheBrewo","Apr 27, 2011"
4.38,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall-Just an outstanding beer. It usually takes a higher ABV brew to get this much flavor. Probably the most flavorful and drinkable 7% IPA I've had.","SWMeyer4141","Apr 26, 2011"
4.65,11,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. The American IPA poured a hazy orange color. It produced a thick creamy head and had excellent head retention. (Most impressive head I have ever seen on a beer.) There was a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by hops and citrus. When I say dominated by hops, I meant this aroma is HOPTASTIC! The taste of the IPA was like a slap in the face with a hop club. BAM! The front, middle and finish of the taste was all about hops. This is a hopheads dream come true. Somehow despite all of the hop bitterness, the smoothness of the beer was off the charts. Awesome beer, one of my new all time favorites!","GossageBrewery","Apr 26, 2011"
4.13,-1.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - Very nice, this is clearly an IPA with generous hop character and an emphasis on pine character. The malt, however, is by no means lost in the shuffle. There is plenty of rich bready grain character and just enough caramel to add complexity without drowning out or dulling the hops. Well worth trying, I only with it was available closer to home.","nickfl","Apr 24, 2011"

3.87,-7.6,3.5,4,3.5,5,4,"D: Certainly deserving of top-tier status amongst West Coast IPAs, Racer 5 may be one of the worthiest and most appropriate benchmarks by which to measure others of the style. Not only are flavors bright and clean in a way that is not at all self-conscious, they are nicely balanced. It bears similarities to Port Wipeout IPA and Ballast Point Big Eye IPA (especially to the former).","beagle75","Apr 19, 2011"

4.2,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is another great west coast ipa. The golden colour and lightness of the body as well as the fresh and dancing hoppiness exemplify this variation. Brews at this point in the spectrum allow enthusiasts to experience some dynamics within a style that can take on some interesting variances in characteristics, but often gets pegged as mundane. From the golden end, where this delicious treat marks its territory, to deep copper and all points in between, the ipa style can still raise an eyebrow. This is a very enjoyable brew.

Well rounded aromas of sweet malt and light hops, with citrus and slight spicy highlights. The flavors are bitter and sour initially, with a bit of green and peppery taste at the end.

While I am not a huge IPA fan, this one tasted excellent. It had hops, sure, but it didn't blow your palate off. Just a nice dose of hops that tasted great.

4.6,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5," This IPA is delicous, just so tangy and citrus flavored with some herbal elements giving a well round flavor of bitter orange/grapefruit notes that aren't hampered by the malt. The taste of the malt is very dry, only enough sweetness there to compliment the slight pineapple quality. The bitterness level is optimal with a low level of astringency and the hop goodness lasts for a while after the swallow. I could enjoy a quart of this IPA it is so drinkable on cask, I have enjoyed it equally in each delivery method -tap, bottle and now cask, just delicious in every way.

On the nose there is a bright pine presence, not overwhelming, probably due to a sweeter mixture of figs and such below the hops. On the tongue it's predominantly grapefruit. In the mouth it's a little thin, but with a pleasing carbonation that keeps the hops around after the swallow.

Boy was I wrong...Basically a tropical citrus wonderland resting on a crystal caramel malt crust. The herbal and evergreen balances out the huge hop profile wonderfully. This a flavor assault...period. The great thing about the hops is the flavor and not necessarily the bitterness. The malt is perfect and is in perfect unison with the hops. This beer is a flavor giant and you should not let this pass you up. Don't judge a book by it's cover....lesson learned.","StaveHooks","Feb 04, 2011"

I also get a light malt backbone (very light---this is the west coast afterall). The pine flavors dominate throughout, making this one tasty IPA. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very complex. Drinkability is very high. This beer is AMAZING fresh! It can turn for the worst rather quickly though. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs when fresh.","DovaliHops","Feb 04, 2011"
4.15,-1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Final Thoughts - This beer used to get much more praise from hopheads 3 years ago and before.

If it had not been for the overwhelming malt character, this beer may have been 5's all across the board.

Flavor is incredible- hits harsh and bitter but subsides into an incredibly smooth aftertaste. Nice citrus (grapefruit) and pine elements. Palate is great- despite its "pale ale" status, it is actually quite rich and by no means watery or thin.

Mango, pineapple, bright lively hops and a slight hint of malty sweetness underlying it all. Medium to full body. Low carbonation. Palate doesn't lean as hard towards the hoppy side as my favorite IPAs but still quite resiny and piny. The hops are balanced relatively equally for the style with a roasted malt flavor but fresh hop taste wins out to dominate the finish.

Hmm, no freshness date to be found and I took a chance on this one at $10 a six pack, and was in a cooler which perhaps has contributed to the freshness and hoppiness. Nothing worse than opening an IPA or APA and getting that stale smell, you know what I mean. Brewers, PLEASE, date code your beers, from a consumers standpoint it just isn't right not to. Anyway, fortunately smell greeted me with a big citrus hop twang, nice grapefruit and pine in there and some alcohol in the nose. Taste has nice malt backbone to help balance out some of the hops, overall a nice interplay between the two flavors and I can see how this is an APA as opposed to an IPA. A good residual blast of resinous piney hop aftertaste reminds me I'm drinking a west coast ale. Mouthfeel is rich and quite smooth and this beer is very drinkable for such a high ABV, big pale ale.

The hop profile and intensity was very nice and the malt counterbalanced it almost perfectly.

The aroma is lovely, and the fact that I could smell it right after popping the cap is always a good sign. It is quite perfume like with plenty of citrus, both lemon and ruby red grapefruit, a hint of pine and some nice flowery aromas. I also detect a hint of earthiness and pale malt sweetness. The flavor is bursting with hops. Lemon, grapefruit, pine and floral flavors mix with the sweet slightly caramel malt character and a bit of earthiness. This beer is quite bitter, but seems to have just enough sweetness to keep it from getting out of control. Not as balanced as a east coast or Midwest IPA mind you, but I am not one to be overly concerned about that, especially with a hop flavor and aroma as great as that possessed by racer 5. The body is medium with a good amount of carbonation, yet a fairly smooth texture. The finish is very dry with a lingering hoppy flavor on my tongue. A very drinkable IPA, and one of my go-to favorites. I am surprised it took me this long to get around to reviewing it.","zoso1967","Jul 21, 2010"

The aromas given off from the beer were quite enjoyable with the hops dominating the nose but had a good sweet malt presence and hints of citrus grapefruit and slight caramel notes. As far as the taste the piney hop were a little bit more punchier but still maintained a decent balance between the sweet malts. The citrus grapefruit also helped out some to enhance the bitter flavors on the palate and I could also detect a caramel undertone. The beer was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation for an IPA and had a slight sweet but sticky bitter finish.

Great Divide, Stone and Avery are very close to each other, and from now on, I will buy whichever is the cheapest out of the 3. Racer 5 lacks the complexity and mouthfeel it used to have.

Citrusy, flowery and bitter with a lingering bitter bit on the tongue. Crisp clean ipa taste. For a 7% by volume the alcohol is well masked and tastes like a lower abv ipa.

Overall a prototypical West Coast IPA with bitterness and hops that are pronounced but not excessive; this is one of the beers that drew me to liking this style.

I like my hoppy brews, but those brews that are in excess of 100 IBU's (Stone's Ruination, pretty much any heady DIPA) are beers to drink maybe one or two of, and the palate is decimated. This one could be that rare moderately sessionable IPA. Seek it out, moderate hopheads.","irishking1977","May 08, 2010"

The nose makes up for it though nothing but unabashed citrus hop goodness. The taste follows the nose pretty much exactly, No real malt presence to speak of. Racer 5 is a little bit undercarbonated, which I should have anticipated given the lack of head. Despite that, it's eminently drinkable, and the ABV is hidden well.

The hops are not overpowering in this brew, my opinion is that it is wonderfully balanced for an IPA. No overkill in the hop department. Really no maltiness to be detected here. Has a slight oily, slick feel about it. This brew does feel light in the mouth for the slightly high alcohol content. Though I am not complaining here.

Not far off in the nose - bold with an easy blend of pine, grapefruit and an echo of sugary sweet grains. The epitome of IPA, if not totally memorable. This classic nose is taken much further in the mouth, and especially the mouthfeel. The drink starts off with a small kick of light bready malts, just enough to stand at attention, then blossoms smoothly into a pungent blend of flowers, fruit and mothers milk. An experience of wilderness brought to life by the brewer. mountain grasses, pineapple, mango and mealy apple are brightened by some high sugary notes and a lightly crisp carbonation. steady as she goes, full as the beer has spread, floral hops and supple yeast combine in the back of the mouth to provide a soothing sense of satisfaction. Velvety. Long. soft. finish, but not a lurking presence... fades with a slow dial. No bitter resins pooling, instead the fade is lightly sweet and milky. truly gorgeous.

4.02,-4.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Beer poured to a cloudy dull golden color with a good sized white head that has nice retention and left thick lacing. I see a lot of floaties suspended in the beer, I am not sure if they are pieces of hops or yeast but I would think it could be due to the bottle conditioning? I will say this the smell of this brew is great, a nice mix of hops as pine is clearly there but also a nice juicy citrus aroma. The malt is faintly there but it is hard to pick up. The taste is great, the hops are in the forefront and give a nice flavor, more on the citrus side of things with a slight tea like finish. Has a somewhat sweet feel to it as well as a slight toasted character and does feel slick on the mouth. Adequate carbonation and the 7% ABV seems to be completely hidden. Overall this is a excellent brew, now for my taste the bomber is the perfect size for me as this hoppy style is usually a one and done for the evening. Very impressed with the Bear Republic beers I have been able to try.","Stimack","Jan 21, 2010"

I take my time to scope the varieties and countries of origin. If I see Racer 5 up there I at least know that I have a beer that I will enjoy and will keep me planted on a bar stool for a few minutes. Racer 5 is easy to drink and it's murky volume allows for a great texture. Although 7%, the alcohol is not incredibly present which generally leads to multiple pints. Hops are significantly present with a touch of citrus. I love that this brew can serve as an everyday choice or become a great session beer depending on how I'm feeling. I would always suggest Racer 5 as a great starter I.P.A. and Bear Republic has been consistent with this beer for many years.","SDHoffers","Jan 20, 2010"

Beery is a crystal clear honey-amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is of hops, with some citrusy grapefruit and woodsy notes. The flavor is very hoppy, with the woodsy hop flavor dominating but other less identifiable notes present as well. There is a hint of malt at the end, but little to no sweetness - this is a dry beer. The ABV is high, but this brew doesn't taste strongly of alcohol - just a hint of heat indicates the strength. The carbonation really carries the hop flavor through my mouth, and the hop bitterness lingers long after I've swallowed due to the way it coats your mouth. This beer feels good in the mouth, with an appropriate amount of body, and plenty of carbonation. This is truly a great IPA, very drinkable.","Ladybugger","Jan 02, 2010"

It leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops, both citrusy and woodsy. As you would expect, the flavor is also dominated by the hop character. It starts out dry, then builds to sharp bitterness that lingers on after you swallow. You can detect some alcohol, especially in the finish and aftertaste. There are flavors that remind me of fruit and forests. This is as good as an IPA can get. It has a medium body and a higher-than-average amount of carbonation. It leaves a coating to your mouth that evaporates while you let the bitter flavors linger. This is an impressively drinkable IPA. There are hops everywhere, but I never grow tired of them.

If you're looking for a great example of a west coast IPA...look no further. In terms of flavor, everything that you get on the nose, you get on the palate.

The taste was consistent with the smell, but a bit more perfumey. Very hoppy. Apparently my palate is not sophisticated enough to comment on the malt character, as I really detected none.

Malts lend a a bit of substance mid-palate, along with the esters. The finish is softly bitter with a hint of raw grain.

Strong citrus flavors come through first dominated by a semi-sweet orange with a trace of grapefruit held in check by a malty backbone. A nice fresh, cleansing hoppy quality on the finish that's dry and snappy. Everything is blended to near perfection. For a relatively high ABV beer this one goes down easily and is delicious to boot. I could probably drink a handful of these before I knew what hit me, and I mean that as a nod to the beer and not my stupidity. At any rate, I highly recommend this one.","apbarwood","Oct 09, 2009"

Pours dark golden with a fine white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some great lacing. Smells nicely of bitter citrus and pine with just enough malt to keep things balanced. Tastes great when fresh, like this is. Wonderful sappy pine and zingy, bitter citrus, along with some dill herbal notes, and a bracing bitterness throughout.

Smells like citrus hops - primarily grapefruit and orange, maybe some pinapple. Citrusy hops dominate the taste too. Bitterness is about optimal - not palate-assaulting, but you know it's an ipa. The sweet, biscuity malt that pairs with the hops really makes for a wonderful balance. or at least as much balance as you would want in an ipa. medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Tastes great, very drinkable, yet the bitterness keeps you from guzzling it down. Awesome beer.","redmagik99","Jun 05, 2009"

Nice solid dense head, leaving a thick chunk of lace at the top, but not really much more as it works its way down the glass. Nice color. Aroma has some fruit candy-like sweetness. Complex hop aroma, but not potent - citrus with a little grassy earthiness that comes out more when you swirl it. A little biscuity malt, but sweet-smelling. Nice balance, not a puckering bitterness, but not syrupy sweet, but the hops still get to shine. A touch of white pepper spiciness, with grassy, citrus hops that lean toward sugar dusted grapefruit flavors. I'm pretty sure there are definitely some Amarillo in there. Malt is sweet caramel that never gets in the way of the hop show. Finishes with some bitterness, but right in the middle of the dry-sweet spectrum. Perfect amount of carbonation and not too syrupy or bitter to enjoy on a summer day.","NCBeernut","May 27, 2009"

Delicate waves of lacing were revealed during the course of the tasting. Nose consists predominantly of grapefruit notes with some light, floral aromas. Taste follows nose, but a nice malt/hops balance comes out in the mouth - some sweetness up front, with a light kiss of hops bittering at the finish.

Mouthfeel is also pleasant, and this drinks very smoothly.

The head rests for a while then slips out the back door, leaving a thick ring of residual sucre lacing. The aroma is so inviting, fresh damp greens and cinnamon bread pudding.

As the tender bubbles of carbonation play across your palate you are again reminded of fresh citrus fruits. Then a warmth passes across your tongue, like being curled up in a velvet blanket.

Initial flavor on the tongue was ample sweetness of grapefruit and honey, giving way to a strong piney/earthy bitterness, which lingered a bit. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this IPA.

I don't know what hop accomplished this feat but it tasted of tangerines. I hear there is an experimental hop that is supposed to do this and I doubt that is in this beer but something combined to make a distinctive tangerine flavor.

The color is on the golden side, as opposed to amber or otherwise. The smeill is grapefruit with some solid bitterness at the back. It tastes like it smells except the sweetness of the malt prevents that bittier aftertaste. This is one of the best IPA's I have tasted that has that malt on the back. A lot of IPA's (Harpoon, Decadent) over do that sweetness for my palette. I would buy this again, but this a once and a while beer.

Medium-bodied, noticeably foamy as you start to sip, grapefruit, orange citrus upfront, less floral but perhaps more piney and waxy.

Hops dominate the taste, but it is lacking on something to counterbalance the hops. This beer is more bitter than some of the double IPAs that I have had (not that it's a bad thing, just that there could be more for the style). The thickness of the beer is just about perfect, but it is overcarbonated. Less carbonation would allow me to enjoy the flavor more.

For example, I could just about session some Chimay Blue or some Kwak even though they are relatively large beers.

The Columbus aromatic hops come through nicely, but a bit restrained, resulting in a fragrant pine needle and spice nose with just a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a subdued carbonation level. Initial flavor was a well balanced presentation of orange, grapefruit, sweet caramel and faint background of Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Late palate to finish is moderately bittersweet, but a bit short and syrupy. Overall a fairly solid IPA and worth a visit, but not all that outstanding","macster","Jan 08, 2009"

A very large citric burst in the aroma along with hints of dry malts. While it has a huge hop burn for the taste and finishes dry, it is mostly a smooth and citric flavored beer that does dry the tongue a little as it leaves its mark (not that this is a bad thing). Didn't really taste any malts but there must be some in there because this beer's body had a subdued creaminess to it.

The smell is big grapefruit citrus hops, with a little bit of pine in there too. I'm not getting much in the way of specific malt, other than a general sweetness mixed in with the hop essence. The flavour is a large smack of citrus and pine hops at the front, which are quite astringent. They carry through right to the finish, dancing the watusi on my tastebuds. The malt body is there, but I only detect it in the mouthfeel, which is actually quite full, with a moderate carbonation. Any warming from the elevated alcohol is hard to discern: I'm all warm and fuzzy from a hop coma. This is indeed tasty, and obviously unbalanced at first due to all its bitter goodness. But as it warmed and I became accustomed to the bitterness, the sweet malt finish became much more evident. This slow to arrive balance would make for a decent drinkability, once suitably primed.","biboergosum","Nov 28, 2008"

The nose on the beer is sweet and hoppy, and pretty balance. Mostly a fruity aroma from the malts and yeast though. It was different than I expected. When taking a drink the beer hits you with a large amount of hop flavour and bitterness. A bit of alcohol comes through with the hops as well, which is okay. Behind the huge amount of hops comes a slightly fruity flavour, but it's hidden by the slight watery mouthfeel. The beer is pretty god damn drinkable!","swizzlenuts","Nov 28, 2008"

Not so dry or bitter as, say, a Pliny. And, golly, it’s a good thing. This is an IPA. Hello! Anyway, I’m not thrilled with the after taste (makes my mouth water – and that’s not a good thing in this case). As an IPA, I’d say it would be better with more rounded hops to it – a little less of the citrus and a little less bitter at the end. Of course, I’d probably not change this recipe and make it more of my perfect IPA – I’d change it to make it a better beer. So I’d up the body and take the alcohol up about a degree. Not changing the current hops, the alcohol and body would probably make this into an excellent old ale…","charlesw","Nov 09, 2008"

It isn't overwhelmingly hoppy like a lot of IPAs but it's a nice floral smell.

Pretty. The nose is citrus hoppy with a touch of honey. Fresh and leafy citrus hop flavors dominate. Crisp fresh malt is detected up front, but it is quickly followed by an assault of spicy, citrusy hops push the malt into the background and merely support the hops all the way to the dry, spicy, slightly hot (alcoholic) finish. A very drinkable IPA despite the 7 percent alcohol. It goes down very easy no doubt in large part due to its dryness. Body is surprisingly light. Methinks I have a fresh bottle of this stuff.

The taste starts like the smell, all citrusy hops, slightly sweet and finishes very bitter leaving the mouth dry and puckered. The alcohol is pretty well covered by the bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Drinkability suffers slightly due to the unbalanced finish. If they could maintain the excellent initial flavor throughout, they'd really have something.

The head could stick around a bit longer, but that's really quibbling over details. The beer smells good. It's not as overtly hoppy in taste or smell as Hop Rod Rye, Racer 5's cousin, but it has some nice citrus notes, which Hop Rod doesn't. I feel a bit silly talking about each category for this beer, so I'll sum up my feelings quickly. The taste is well-balanced and dry. The mouthfeel is very nice with great carbonation that plays an excellent supporting role. Finally, it's just exceptionally drinkable. The beer is sweet, hoppy and dry. The flavors don't linger and the bitter aftertaste is just right. For me, Racer 5 is a perfect storm of drinkability.","popery","Aug 31, 2008"

The strong scent of grapefruit and pine strike the nose at first sniff, that is followed by the mellow fragrance of malt at the end. The malt comes out at the start of the taste, then it blends to an intense grapefruit, grassy, earthy bitterness takes over and dominates till the end. A thin watery feel at bthe front, it then gradually becomes more of a medium bodied feel. This a really good IPA, bringing a strong aroma and excellent flavor, which are the backbone of a great beer, makes this one outstanding.","cameraman","Aug 21, 2008"
4.82,15,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep orangish copper color. Hazy in clarity. Nice white head forms right away. Very good head retention for the first few minutes, it then settles down to a nice lacing on top of the beer. A good floral smell, hops are right up front. Maybe a little fruity note, apricot, maybe hint of orange? Mouth feel, slightly sweet start but the hops kick in almost right away. Oily feel going through the mouth. Good bitter hops note but not too much, alcohol (7%) is well hidden but does help balance out the hops, you do feel the hops on your teeth between sips. All in all I had forgotten how much I love this beer. May need to stack it up against the 90 min when I get home in a battle royal for my top IPA. If you are a hop and IPA fanatic then go get one of some Racer 5, a supreme example of a West Coast IPA. I have got to figure out a way to get this stuff in GA.","ClavinCliff","Aug 21, 2008"

I see that as a detractor, but many others trying to develop a palate for hops, or who just aren't hop heads would probably love this IPA. The hop aroma, and flavor are very nice. For a 7% abv beer the alcohol is a little to noticeable. This is probably the biggest problem that I have with this beer.

Some small spice in here, but not much is noticed over the standard west coast hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is just on thick side here for a standard IPA as is the abv. drinkability is quite good.

The taste is much the same with citrusy hops dominating every other flavor, even living a biting bitterness coating your mouth.

A rather pale golden colour with a good head that subsides and leaves moderate lacing. Plenty of aroma on raising the glass to the nose and a powerful hit of flavour on the tongue, but it retains a degree of sublety. Slightly oily mouthfeel, but not bad for that.

4.47,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I am very impressed with this brewery so far. Not distributed to my area, I have to pick these up when I travel to Ohio. So far, every beer from this brewery has been finely attenuated, but rich in proteins and all have supurb head retention / formation. Racer X is no exception. The onset brings a rich, but clean looking copper / amber color, thick foamstand, and lively co2. The beer takes on a rich, biscuity malt character in the aromas and flavors. I was really impressed with the clean attenuation, with no harshness-- a perfect balance. Great hop balance for IPA-- I would prefer a stronger sharper hop influence, but I think I got an aged bottle where the hops have settled out a bit. At any rate, this is a truely expressive, hop-oriented IPA. Citrus notes hinge more on oranges than grapefruits due to the sturdy malt base and ester profile. Very full to the palate, again close to a Double IPA. The finish is very clean, crisp, and cracker-like, but with a long dry hop flavor and a touch of caramel. An extremely nice beer.

I thought I was trying something less popular. The beer pours a golden amber with lots of carbonation, a foamy head, some retention and lacing. The aroma is all hop, juicy, estery, oily hop. There are grapefruit notes and florals too. You can whiff a bit of biscuity malt if you try. The taste is a blast of pungent, citrusy hop, with plenty of estery and oily resinous hop as well. There is a nice creamy backbone to the beer that balances out the hop bite. The grapefruit like tartness and the malty breadiness in the rear make this a fine offering. The beer is quite well carbonated, very refreshing, lots of effervescence, and just nice all around. The aftertaste is about right, not too mild, not too lingering. L'Chaim.","albern","Jun 08, 2008"

Lots of sweetness, richness and theres always a bitter side hanging on the background but really only stays there on the back of the palate. Only a slight bit of spice to the "piney" side to this balanced IPA. This beer is 100% a school girl that is smart as hell and down for doing work, and always good to bring to your parents house.

This is followed by sweet malt aromas. The taste is of big grapefruit hops, some tropical fruit, pepper. Some malt sweetness to help try and balance. The feel is moderate with soft to fizzy carbonation, finishes with a big bitter bite. Also has a bit of a slick feel to it. Really reminds me of a DIPA without the bigger ABV.

The first thing that grabs me about this beer is the drinkability of it, it is odd to notice so soon on the palate. A balance of dandilion like hops mixed with a nutty mineral zest that stays on the mouthfeel. This is a dry woodsy IPA with almost no sweetness, which is must how the style should be.

Very spicey and fruity in the nose. when I took the first sip, the spiciness was almost overwhelming. The spiciness evolved into a simple bitter and finished nice and sweet.

Bear Republc's hit another homer with this beer, even though I still wish it was classified as a style more appropriate to it's taste.

The smell of this beer hit me as I was pouring it. Big scents of citrus fruit and an earthy grassy scent that both equally vie for your attention. A slight bit of sweet malt is also trying to make itself known on the nose as well. The flavor profile is a duel battle between the sweet caramel malt and the citrus and pine flavor of the hops. Neither flavor dominates each other and this flavor profile is well crafted and well made. The mothfeel is a bit thin, but overall it is medium bodied with lower than average carbonation.

This looks like good stuff - slightly cloudy, not overly carbonated. Beautiful flowery hop aroma - so much it's slightly soapy but not offensive. Unfortunately, the soapiness emerges more in taste, tempering the bountiful almost sweet, deep hop taste & texture. The soapiness fortunately dissipates quickly on the longer-than-average but slightly shallow finish. A little puckery in the mouth, consistent with a wonderfully deeply-hopped beer such as this. Drinks well; evolves positively through the length of the bomber. Well-done.","IBUnit63","Feb 09, 2008"

It first touches the tongue with good carbonation and then the earthy hops are right there on the tongue. The beer finishes nice with the spicy hops leaving a pleasant aftertaste.

Pure American hop nose of grapefruit, pine sap and perhaps some chili oil. Malt influence on the nose is subdued -- just a hint of sweet nuts to provide a bit of a base for the hops. On the palate, bracing, fruity bitterness first off, then some big carbonation makes itself known. The mid-palate smooths out a bit to showcase the malts, although things remain wayyy off balance toward the hop side.

Both are excellent; however, I prefer this beer slightly warmer than the standard bar-serving temperature (about 44*F, instead of 40*F). I think it brings out a slightly maltier taste and also helps emphasize the hop flavor. Pours a nice copper color with a nice compact head. Aroma and flavor is mainly citrus, with pine notes in the background. Mouthfeel is regular - nothing notable or otherwise.

That, along with the beautiful head and slight cloudyness of the beer made me real excited about the first sip. The taste is very complex. Very good. The bitterness lingers nicely. One thing I look for when tasting an IPA is the ballance between the Bitterness and Sweetness. The bitterness of this IPA does overpower the malt. The sweetness of the malt is subtle.

A caramel malty backbone is there, but the hops are running this. Flavor starts off sweetish with toffee and fruity esters, accompanied by a Bear Republic house flavor. Hops come in with loads of pine resin, grapefruit, and aspirin. Finishes really bitter with that lingering aspirin flavor.

Midway there is a good biscuity malt balance. This one finishes somewhat dry and a bit creamy too. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation.

Malt flavor is big to match. A toasted marshmallow(golden not black) caramelization. Fruitiness sneaks through with canned peach and apricot. Is there rye in this beer because it has a very spicey flavor? Slight bourbon comes and goes late in the fading finish. Overall it's big, bIG, BIG.

It smells like sweet grapefruit, chlorophyll, and apples. The taste is pleasant. The hops aren't as explosive as the smell hinted at leaving a very smooth, yet dry mouthfeel. Dry and bitter up front with sweeter, more forgiving citrus in the middle followed by a very sharp bitter grassy taste at the very end.

This is a great beer; beautifully balanced piney and citric hops and huge malting make for an IPA with all the right elements to make this a very refreshing and very impressive brew. Careful metering of the ingredients result in an IPA that is properly and proportionally put together. Everlasting, never ending, and lip smacking sticky hop sensations last for minutes in the mouth and tongue.

4.2,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from the bomber into one of my DFH tulip pint glasses. The Racer 5 delivers a brightly colored orange/amber body with a full-bodied, off-white head. Sticky lace remnants cling to the sides of the glass as the beer recedes, and the foamy head soon dies down, leaving thick, clumpy foam globules in the middle of the beer. I like what I see so far. The nose on this beer is bold and hoppy, with strong grapefruit and pine scents being the most recognizable. Also apparent are some malty cut-grass scents, and other resiny citrus smells. The taste is tart and tangy up front, with a nice malt balance in the middle, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for a while. More pine than citrus in the overall taste, with some light fruity esters permeating throughout. Mouthfeel is sturdy. A nice, strong IPA here. Even modest fans of hops might find a few things to enjoy here, and devout hopheads should definitely seek this out as yet another addition to the repertoire. Bold and refreshing, but unoffensive. An all-season beer, in my opinion.","Atlas1","Jun 26, 2007"

A very good all aroung IPA, just not quite with the truly great ones.","clingman71","May 07, 2007"

Amber in color with a reddish hue that tells me this one means business. Somewhat hazy after the second pour leaving a mammoth creamy head and superb lacing. Carbonation is on point as well. Hops burst through, mostly piney and a small hint of citrus in the background. More hop attack on the first sip which is well balanced by malts. It's a bigger hoppy flavor for an IPA which is rather refreshing to me. Tingly, yet smooth mouthfeel. I almost started to gargle but swallowed instead. This beer is great in all categories and I could probably have a couple bombers. For what it is, this is one hell of a beer and one that I would love to get my hands on more often.","ncvbc","Apr 18, 2007"

Nice feel in the mouth and a very fresh taste that makes this a pleasure to drink. Finish is hoppy, with just the correct bitterness. The alcohol is present but is again well balanced with the malts and hops. An excellent IPA, and for me is about as good as a beer can get. We have a lot of great IPAs around here.

The feel is slightly watery at first and is followed by a bit of a dry bitterness that makes me want another sip.

The mouthfeel was medium-light, the finish was clean and bitter and flavorful, the beer was not just drinkable, it was gulpable, inhalable, guzzlable.

So anyway, this one pours a sort of plain amber color. What made it really pleasing is that the head sticks to the glass like crazy, along with the just barely visible sediment floating here and there. Smell at first seemed slightly metallic, then with another whiff, gave way to some citrusy aromas, really juicy smell. The citrus is accompanied in the taste by a literal attack of hops on the palate. These are some really aggressive hops, that never quite seem to end. The initial citrusy presence seems to end with a more earth based ending. The mouthfeel is medium in body.

4.67,11.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Upon opening a strong fruity, floral aroma emerges. Noticeable across the room. Intense alpha acid sting follows the fruitiness. It's like an intense hop garden. I'm sure there's malt and yeast there but the hoppy smell is amazing. Pours a hazy orangish color with a large off white sticky head. Head maintains well. Good lacing. Taste is strong bitter at first but soon subsides into a complexity which is quite nice. Lots of herbal character and piney grapefruit hops in the middle. A touch of sweet fruit rides the entire wave. Almost apple like, maybe grapes too. A touch of toffee, some banana. It's complex but straighforward at the same time. Hops control. Bitterness never relents its hold at the top. Depth though is outstanding. Finish is long and dry and bitter. Just all around enjoyable. This is how an IPA should taste like.","granger10","Sep 16, 2006"

Smell is floral, mild bitter hops presence, some citrus, maybe even hints of pine apple and mango. Taste is well balanced, bitter hops and mild spices shine through the fruit favors nicely finishes with a hint of bitterness right before the fruit. A little sticky, but just the right amount. This is a swell beer, I was a little thrown buy the packaging's unappetizing colors scheme, but once I tasted the beer I could careless.

Aroma is lightly lemony hops with an undercurrent of controlled sweetness.

The color is a light amber/honey with some reds...very nice. The smell is very pronounced, citrus outwieghs the piney hop notes with a background of toasty malts and an almost varnishy, sweet cedar smell, if that makes any sense I do find it quite nice. The hops and toasted malts come together to form the cedar aroma. The taste is pure and clean smooth toasty malts in the beginning, citrus in the middle and both mixed with a subdued hop finish. Nice and well rounded. Somewhat unimpressive compared to the Hop Rod Rye from this brewer. But still a darn fine entry. The mouthfeel is quite nice if not a bit watery, overall it is quite good. Immensly drinkable and easily quaffable. The quasi-high levels of alcohol are masked very well and do not effect the taste but do sneak into the aroma.

A very nice even keel bitterness is present throughout and lasts long on the palate. A bit of alcoholic spice bite near the end too.

Hazy golden orange amber. Aroma of pine and more pine, slight malt sweetness. Taste was exactly like aroma- pine, and citrus, with slightly underrepresented malt backbone, but good nonetheless, finished with more pine.

To me, it gives off the smell of 2 different kinds of finishing hops. Its like drinking liquid copper. The supper hop flavor is complimented by smooth malt and grains. Goes down smooth with not to much of a citrus bite. The boiling hops are a little more calm. It doesnt leave your mouth dry. Sharp finishing/aroma hops matched with mellow boiling hop makes the best combination. This is the IPA that drinks like a golden ale with a kick ass hop combination.","RoBotGod","Mar 27, 2006"

4.52,7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"What an outstanding California beer! This seems to be a ubiquitous favorite around the bay area from what many at the phenomenal Toronado bar had to say. This pint was barely amber, almost orangey, and had a stable two finger, dense off-white head that had superb retention  surprising for a 7% brew. Maybe the water in California has different properties than Pacific Northwest waters when it comes to head retention. The smell is phenomenally hoppy. The taste is surprising and original. Its only 69 IBUs, but I would have guessed in the high 80s. They are using Cascade and Columbus hybrid hops. The later are usually employed early in brewing for bittering, but these in the Racer 5 are utilized more in a finishing role and other breweries could really take a hint from this. They are superb in that capacity. The mouthfeel is bold and sharp and the finish is long and wonderful. It should be noted that there is actually some discernable malt taste lurking behind all the hops and it has a subtle caramel malt body. This is a real drink-em-all-night IPA and one of the most enjoyable of the style Ive ever had.","xoqx","Jan 19, 2006"

Nice lacing is left behind on my pint glass. Aromas of pine, oranges, carrots, and hops seem to come out nicely. The taste is quite hoppy with a bitterness that is present in every sip. A fair amount of malty sweetness is also present, adding texture and variety to each sip. I felt this beer was too carbonated and hence it was too slick and creamy in my mouth. The drinkability is high as the flavors are enticing and enjoyable.","jaluria","Jan 04, 2006"

Massive billowing head that sticks to every glass surface it can find. Pure hops in the nose, oily and citrus-like. Hops are upclose and personal in the taste, but a perfect level of malt sweetness manages to rein in the bitterness. Mouthfeel could have benefitted from the brewers using water with a higher mineral content, I think. It might have complimented the hops just a little more, but that's a minor hit on an awesome West Coast IPA.","germaniac","Dec 08, 2005"

It is balances by a modest caramel backbone. Flavor is dominated bot the hops initially. More sharpness in the pine flavor than sweetness from the citrusyness. The sweet caramel backbone comes through more after the swallow, followed by a moderate hoppy bitter that grabs and hangs on, drawing me back for more. Tasty beer. Feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Nice and chewy. Just looked at the ABV. 7% is nowhere to be found. Burps are much stronger in the caramel than hoppyness.

Pours a golden amber from the bomber, very sweet floral citrusy aroma, hops are noticeable but not overpowering. Flavor is initially sweet, with vanilla and pineapple flowing. Hoppiness is present throughout, though not with a lot of bitterness and actually a butterscotch, malty caramel presence seems to take over in the finish. Very thick and coating and a bit heavy for an IPA. Carbonation is light and reminiscent of a hand-pulled cask pour. The big malt profile balances this quite nicely. As a hophead I still prefer the more hoppy, bitter X. However, as a west coast IPA, this is quite tame in terms of hops, and could be a great crossover IPA.","IrishRedRock","Sep 30, 2005"

Mostly tropical and sweet in the nose - pineapples, grapefruit, oranges, a strong sweetness, and a bit of nostril-burning alcohol in the back. The flavor is about the same with a hefty sweetness and grapefruit, pineapple, leafy/oily hops, and some nutty/biscuity malts. It is both quite sweet and bitter at the same time with both lingering for awhile. At the beginning it has a medium body but it becomes thicker and creamier as the beer warms up.

Excellent balance with plenty of bitterness balanced by bready, biscuity malts. Hop flavour is strong pine, citrus, and spice, without being over the top. Sweetness backs off towards the end, which lets the resinous bitterness come forward, along with more orange hop flavour, and a bit of alcohol warming appear. Finishes off-dry. Body is a little on the heavy side, moderate carbonation. Bottle conditioning seems to contribute to the creamy smooth texture, which improves even more as it warms. Very nice...","DrJay","Jun 22, 2005"

Appears a cloudy yellow amber color with a dense head that lasts until the very end, leaving nice rings of white lacing on the glass. Smells quite hoppy, a mix of grapefruity pine and citrus. The taste is actually perfectly balanced, a must for a truly great IPA, though the hops come get you first. As the smell suggested, piney and citrusy, which sounds pretty typical and we've all seen those words in just about every review of an IPA, but there's a bit more to this one. Nice lemmon and orange peel zest, and a bit of dry dustiness. The deliverance of this beer is key as well; perfectly smooth mouthfeel, nice and dry yet thirst-quenchingly refreshing. I wish this beer came in sixers or growlers, because I could easily pound a half gallon of this delicious nectar.

The semi-high ABV in this is well hidden but makes a presence letting you know that it is there very sublte in the finish. The smoothness of this beer is incredible for having so much hop flavor. The intense hops in an IPA that are normally too much for malt-lovers, is so well balanced, that this is a perfect beer for those who want to explore the world of the hop-heads. I personally can not get enough hops, and this one (not being a IIPA) is just phenomenal.

Nicely balanced, this one is smooth and subdued, at least compared to some other IPAs. The finish is mild, almost fruity, but the race isn't over yet.

Hops is what this is all about.A lttle to cloudy for my taste. Initially just a wonderful wake up call to your taste buds and then settles down to a maltly feel but not for long. Get ready for a hop explosion that just continues and finishes with a dry hop flavor that just begs you to have another to quench your thirst.This is just a great example of an American IPA that has raised the bar of what can be done. A definite keeper. Bittering is a little heavy but i love that. Not for the uninitiated.","david23","May 02, 2004"

There is a brief hint of syrupy sweet hops right before the peanut kicks in. The flavor melts into a blend of all these tastes, with a slightly astringent bitter taste. The beer feels both dry and lightly syrupy on the tongue. An interesting beer to be certain.","FranklinPCombs","Mar 12, 2004"

The aroma of hops wafts potently up from the bubbles, and the grapefruit esters are prevelant as I bring the pint glass to the nose. The taste is tart and hoppy--very hoppy. The bitter grapefruit aroma dominates too in the taste, but there is a strong nutty current--this is nicely intricate, well-balanced, and with a substantial mouthfeel. Much like the Dogfish Head 60. I like. A lot.","longpondbeerman","Mar 12, 2004"

It pours with a tall head of soapy white suds that leaves thready lace garlands as it recedes. The crisp hop nose is a genuine standout feature owing to a hearty infusion of Northwestern grown Columbus hops. Racer 5 is golden and clear but yeast particles will not stay in the bottle. They pour out in thick chunks and gobs that might appear unappetizing to some. The body is smooth with a bitterness that is striking but not excessive. Hearty, drinkable and clean.

Interestingly enough I also get some notes of just over-ripe plum as I go in for another sniff. The first sip, ahhh, this was the hop fix that I have been looking for. This beer is ripe with hop notes from beginning to end. There is a medium level of sweetness, and a toasted maltiness in the finish. The sweetness helps to pick up and accentuate the fruity hop notes that are in this beer. The hops taste of apricot, lychee, and ripe citrus fruit. It finishes with a solid bitterness that ties the whole beer together and demands that you take another sip. This is the beer I was looking for tonight, it just hits the spot.","Gueuzedude","Mar 02, 2004"

Being a homebrewer, I appreciated this touch, even though it was probably unintentional, and would have settled to the bottom had I kept the bottle in the fridge longer. The smell is slightly sweet with a clean and crisp hop aroma. The taste- yum yum yum- a sweet malt flavor that coats the mouth with a great balance of hops. More hops than in normal beers, but deliciously balanced by the malt. While drinking it, the phrase smooth bitterness popped into my head. This feels full, rich, delicious with light carbonation and a dry hop aftertaste. I love this beer. Can't wait to try more. Am particularly lucky to have found this in NYC. Let's hope my supply doesn't dry up.","twilight","Jan 31, 2004"

Smell was super citrusy coupled with an orange sweetness and other fresh citrus fruits. The taste was brutal in the hop department which smoothed into a very malty profile for the color. As the beer warmed the 7% ABV really takes hold. However, with the adition of the sediment the taste mellows considerably to a grassier flavor with a honey-baked sweetness and the hops took a more subdued floral approach. Quality IPA and glad to have it in the Rochester area.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 18, 2004"

Fullish soft mouth upfront this then turns dry on on the back of the tongue in the finish. The finish could be slightly better balenced (malt wise).. but that is just me being picky.

A big blast of fresh sharp-edged hops jumps out with grapefruit, lemon zest and a faint metallic tang.

Lace is sticky in large webby sheets. Aroma is oh so nice with lovely hops of piney deepness and citrusy oils with a soft, round caramel maltyness. Straight up IPA nose from the West coast eh, quite nice, could smell it at arms length. Taste has a nice piney sense with a mellowness thats welcoming; increasing citrus of dull orange oil and grapefruit mixed with a touch of woody dryness and a nice even bittering hop bite thats resin filled and quite nice the whole way through. Caramel malts keep a sweeter notion overall on the under side. Feel is solid medium bodied with a nice little creamy smoothness and fluffyness that slides right down. This beer clinched it for me. I love hops!! I've held back on wanting a hop fix, but no longer, I'm going to start hoarding hop heavy beers dammit! This was a very nice IPA! The bomber was gone in no time!

Also smells fairly fruity, more than expected. Good flavor of citric hops, lightly malted, and pinish bitterness. Very smooth and not too heavy considering it's on the bigger edge of IPA's.

Instead of smacking you with hops, it's got a bit of balance and some complexity in the aroma. The taste is hop laden, to say the least. Very bitter up front, then a puckering hop quality truly sucks your cheeks together. A nice floral sweetness comes in at the finish, along with a bit of malt. Initial bitter either subsides as the beer warms or numbs the taste buds to leave a smoother, softer flavor experience in its wake. Aftertaste is multiple types of hop notes, with pine, florals, and just down right bitterness mixed with a touch of sweetness. Hop burps start after two drinks, with a nice herbal note to them. Combination of alcohol and hops create a burning warmth in the throat and stomach. Mouthfeel is full and somewhat silky.

4.48,6.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a nice amber cold color and formed a huge foamy white head that left circular lace coating the glass as is slowly, very slowy subsided. Some steady carbonation is also present to account for this. An aroma of malt, hops and some burnt caramel present. A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. A slight burnt aspect and bitterness to the finish. Slightly sweeter than most IPAs I drink, but a good beer.","Wildman","Apr 11, 2003"
4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Golden caramel color. Aroma shouts "hop-city" right up front. Flavor is a soid dose of hops, immediately followed by sweet malt. A touch sharp up front, then the subtle floral hops flavors emerge. The finish is moderately sour and astringently bitter. Well balanced - highly hoppy but not overwhelming. Drinkability is quite good. This is my first Bear Republic beer and already I'm a fan.","Brent","Apr 02, 2003"
4.63,10.5,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"This is a highly interesting beer, reminiscent of HopDevil in its mix of hops and creaminess, but with that added odd twist of bitter. Another winner -- another unique and tempting beer -- from Bear Republic.","Darkale","Mar 31, 2003"
3.62,-13.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,2.5,"This is a tasty IPA, but fell below my expectations. Drinkability suffers due to the lack of real hop flavor and hearty, lingering bitterness.","wofat","Mar 31, 2003"
4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A well-stored bottle pours a surprisingly crystal-clear deep amber body (I can see my fingerprints through the glass on the first pour - the second becomes more hazy). The aroma of fresh piney/citric hops greets you immediately. The full and creamy vanilla head needs a few moments to settle just so you can fill the glass; and once calmed holds fairly well. It drops but keeps a solid 1/4" of foam across the surface and leaves excellent layers of lace until the very end. The nose expresses piney/citrusy hops over a gently caramelish malt. It's very nice, and not overdone as some IPAs can be! A moderate carbonation combines with a firmly malty body to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor re-itereates what the nose indicated with a rich, caramel-soaked malt that's infused with piney/citrusy hops. A firm bitterness balances this big beer without going over the line; and leaves it quite drinkable (still, it is a bit filling). Really well-balanced! It finishes dry with a swiftly disintegrating maltiness followed by a flash of bitterness and then some residual piney hop flavor. An exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Mar 18, 2003"
4.63,10.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The usual IPA orangish amber in color, and nice and clear. Great white head that stays extremely well! It's well presented. Big points for that. Pine hits you first when you take a whiff of this. A big malt backbone comes through underneath it. As for the taste, it's rather smooth for an IPA. No overwhelming bitterness, but it maintains the big character flavor profile that I like. Hops do play a big role though. In the front, some rind-like and leafy hop character makes its presence known. Malt stays in the background, but it's like a cloud over the sun in Phoenix, you don't pay it much heed but you know it's there making everything more comfortable for you. In the middle and back, malt is ready to come out more, and it's got a very nice "buttery" sweetness to it. A bit bready. The bitterness shows up in the finish, nice and crisp. Well, I think this is a very enjoyable IPA, I'll definitely have it again, hopefully more than a few times. It seems a bit underrated to me. But it's all in one's own taste, right? I'd say definitely give it a try and see for yourself!","hyuga","Mar 07, 2003"
4.37,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer came in a 22oz with a cool label. The beer poored a beautiful copper color, which was a surprise for an IPA. The smell and taste are all IPA though. Great Citrus smell and flavor. Also, the maltiness isn't sublte, which I like. This is a big beer, though most of the bitterness is actually in the aroma. There isn't a strong bitter body to it, though i'm not sure what the IBU level is. I'll definately have this again.","freed","Feb 28, 2003"

3.95,-5.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice shiny copper body with a good head. The aroma is sweet and citricly hoppy. The flavor is nicely malty with a lightly sweet breadiness that makes me want more of this. The problem comes in the hops that, while nicely bitter, lack a certain zing and has a slightly medicinal quality. Man, I hope I can manage to figure out this malt profile and the one in Anchor Liberty for my own homebrew when I start next week.","aracauna","Jan 29, 2003"
3.95,-5.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: A well-balanced pale ale. Not as assertively-hopped as some of my favorite IPA's, but not bad. Personally, I just like my IPA's a little hoppier.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jan 28, 2003"
3.47,-17.2,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Clear orangeish/gold in color, with a thin but persistant head. Big, tart citric hop aroma -- very crisp and lemony, with an underlying caramel sweetness. Flavor too is big on hops, citric in flavor with a very bitter finish and an aftertaste combining biscuity malt and fruity hop flavors. A bit of a solvent-like flavor mid-palate, which is a bit distracting, and unexpected for a beer whose alcohol level is quite moderate. Crisp and drinkable, but not one of my favorite IPAs.","mzwolinski","Jan 01, 2003"

4.73,12.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Amber gold in color with a chunky pure white head that left exceptional lace patterns. Fresh hop scent, taste was very nice, not overpowering like some domestic IPA's. I thought just right. Carbonation was on the low side, much like English ale. A great IPA, easily the best domestic one I have had. While I will buy it again and enjoyed it totally, drinkability rating was lowered due it's fairly high alcohol content and it only coming in those damm 22oz bomber bottles. Enjoyed it with a deli sandwich. This beer gets better and better, I have just upped it's rating due to realizing how great this beer is. Tremendous appearance, aroma, and taste. yes it's my favorite IPA, and my favorite domestic brew! A total winner.","Mark","Nov 17, 2002"
4.57,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow, is there anything this beer cannot go with. This clean looking amber beer seems to accent nicely with whatever you're eating. Full hop flavored, yet not too over powerful with hops. Nice citusy aroma that tickles the nose. Thin head and not much lace in the glass. Another great product from Bear Republic. This is one beer that you cannot go wrong with if you love IPA's.","sinistersteve","Sep 05, 2002"
4.7,12.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is a wonderful beer.  Sitting in Healdsburg, pondering the bicycles and pondering this beer.  So rich, great balance of malt and hops, but the finish - bordering on one of the best IPA's.  One of life's pleasures.","gwfrankpsu","Jul 28, 2002"
4.7,12.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow,I really love this beer. The balance if just great. There is a little bitterness in the finish, with a hint of lemon. I would put this beer as one of my favorites. One sip and I couldn't imagine anyone not loving the taste and balance hops and yeast of this beer!","BeerManDan","Jul 28, 2002"

4.32,3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Another damn fine west coast IPA.  A nice gold/orange color with that familiar Cascade smell and piney undertones.  Head retention is good, but it leaves minimal lace on the glass.  I'd enjoy it more with a bit more malty sweetness, but I'm not complaining.","mickeymac","May 05, 2002"
4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy golden with fine particles of matter in suspension. Nice bubbly and rocky white head. Piney/citrus aroma. I can taste a little sting of alcohol in this one. But it also has a really good bitterness. Nice malt backbone and good hop tones. Slight pine and citrus on the palate. Easy drinking brew. Good IPA.","Bighuge","Mar 27, 2002"
