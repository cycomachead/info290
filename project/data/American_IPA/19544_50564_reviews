"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is bursting with grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruits, bitter and dry. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer."
"Resin, tropical fruit, citrusy finish, not too bitter, good job!"
""
"O - Not available locally, wished I picked up a few more to take back from Ohio.  Recommended IPA."

"Great west coast style beer.  Can taste the chinook.  centennial and cascade hops.  Not sure of the exact variety but they did a good job balancing with the hops."

"Lots of citrus and grapefruit flavours in this tasty ipa. Surprisingly refreshing considering the 86 ibu. On tap at Fat Heads Sah Side."

"First Fat Head's brew in my portfolio. Hop explosion for sure. Beautiful golden color. Lots a of different tastes going on here. Every sip brings out something new. Pine, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, floral notes,  lemongrass and other subtle tropical flavors. Dry hop finish and nice carbonation. Definitely a party in your mouth. Great IPA. Looking forward to trying some other Fat Head's offerings."

"Spotted this at Whole Foods. Bottled on 1/7/15, tried on 2/23/15. Well, this one suprised me. Hop bomb for sure. Very light malt presence. Hops more pine, floral then anything else. Glad i was able to try this."
"A nice IPA.  Was fortunate enough to get this is a  trade.  Nice pickup if it's locally in stores around you but if not you can find something just as good.  Daisy Cutter would be comparable."

"Pours a clear golden color with white head. Pine, citrus, grass, and resinous notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes bitter, with a nice hop bite"

"Great every day IPA. Very dry, hop forward beer with bitter after taste. Grapefruit, pineapple, and pine come through on the aroma and taste. Its balanced with pleasant mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle was a few months old (12/24/14).  Still tasted great.  Probably would have been rated higher if it was fresh.  Had it on tap a few weeks ago and it was amazing."

"You'll be hard pressed to find a better American IPA, even though this baby is from Ohio and not the west coast."
""
""
"Top 3 ipa's in my list"
""
""
"Bright, clear golden color. Pleasant citrus aromas gave way to a palate impression that was dominated by a bitter hop essence, yet did not seem to be out of balance despite a relative lack of accompanying malt qualities. An excellent IPA that would be a fine choice for everyday drinking."
""
"O - solid everyday IPA"

"This is a great ale. Nice and complex. Hard to find a better IPA."

"As far as IPAs goes, this is it. It just doesn't get any better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks are deceiving as this has the appearance of a common IPA, but as you quaff the aromas from the hops your expectations increase. If you like a huge hop mouthfeel and body in your IPA you can't go wrong with the Headhunter, especially on draft."

"Awesome taste.  Poured from the growler. Definitely going to look for more!"
""
"Tried on tap in Dayton as well as from bottles at a later date.  Poured a dull copper orange and gave off a nice fragrant west-coast hop nose.  Typical grapefruit/pine aroma.  Mouthfeel could have been a bit fuller, but overall very good flavor.  Not as bitter as I expected, but a tasty brew indeed.  Might be just average if it was in San Diego, but it seems to shine brighter in Ohio."
""
""
""
"It doesn't get much better than this. Extremely drinkable at 7.5%ABV. Top 5 IPA IMHO."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, outstanding citrusy hoppy aroma, a great beer!"
""
""
"Overall a very good IPA and probably one of the best I've had from Ohio. Go Buckeyes!"
""
"this is a great everyday IPA... right behind sculpin in my book"
""
""
""
""

"o: A lot of flavor and hop bitterness here, not as good as expected given the high BA rating, but age may have adversely affected this bottle.  As is, a strong-tasting but impressive brew nonetheless."

"Piney, earthy, citrus, and juicy. Leaves the mouth pleasantly dry."
""

"This is an IPA for the true IPA lover. The taste is incredible!  Awesome beer!  Treat yourself to one of you want to get hooked!"
""
"Pretty good. Had a couple month old bottle. Had a lot of caramel/malt flavor and smell for an ipa. But afterwards a good hop/resin bitterness and bite"

"Now they are distributing kegs, and I had a pint at saraveza last night. The great aroma seemed to be more profound and tropical fruity, it's even more amazing. And they have seemed to completely fixed the flavor issues. Before the malt was more forward. Now the hops shine through with just enough malt to back them up. While I was skeptical about this beer at first, it has now exceeded expectations.  (4.5/5)"
""
"Don't get me wrong; it delivered everything it promised. And the aroma IS amazing. But I really doubt that I'll be going back to this any time soon. Not never; just not soon. (YMMV)"

"While I love 'Fat Heads' and think they make world class brews, I had this up against a few Columbus Brews (Bodhi, Creeper) I have to say this is a tad overrated... I love their Hop Juju, Trail head and Hop Stalker, plus everything this brewery (Saloon too) does. Just not sure if this is the 'King of Cleveland IPA's (That's White Rajah IMO) That said its still very enjoaybe!"

"O: this beer is quite good I have a love hate relationship with it because I drink it soo much I find it common. But sitting here reviewing it it is quite good"
""

"Pours a clear golden amber color. Has a strong resinous piney aroma. This beer smells of dank dank hops. This taste is a tad weaker than the smell which threw me off a bit. Lots of pine and grapefruit and it lingers the perfect amount. Overall this is a great IPA, and at 7.5% it's pretty high for a non-imperial IPA, and the alcohol is masked very well. I'm glad Ohio has more great beers than I can count, including this one."

"Had on draft at Champps in Columbus, OH and also scooped up a sixer from Whole Foods in Columbus.  I was super excited to try this one and it did not let me down! big tropical fruit taste, same with the small along with some slight dankness.  Just excellent. Wish i had regular access to this one.  Another Big Time beer for the Midwest arsenal."

"Thanks to HopFace for the opportunity to try.  Served in a shaker pint.  Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, half-inch, cream-colored head.  Great nose - grapefruit, tropical fruit and hints of Simcoe and citrus rind towards the back.  Taste expresses less fruitiness and more Simcoe and rind in the forefront with grapefruit (not as sweet) towards the back.  Finishes with a light and pleasant herbal bittering between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant carbonation that falls just shy of crisp and biting.  There's a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and also a little maltiness to the body.  Overall, a solid IPA.  If I had regular access to this, it would be part of my standard line-up."

"Believe the hype - Head Hunter is the real deal. It is the living, breathing antithesis of the theory that all the best IPAs hail from the West Coast. People in Cleveland must be saying: ""Pliney, who?"" With Fat Head's you pretty much can't go wrong - there's not a bad beer on the list - but make one-hundred percent certain you try Head Hunter. As if you needed me to tell you that!"

"Overall, this was a beer enjoyed after a day of riding ten of the world’s best roller coasters at Cedar Point.  We were most certainly thrashed from it, and ready for some swill and delicious grub.  We found this little establishment on the interweb and loved it.  The food was great and so was the beer, but we’ll leave a full review for it in the proper place.  This beer was recommended to us by the knowledgeable bartender, although it has been on our “Ohio list” for a little while now.  What we found was a nice local offering, but really were hard pressed to find much more.  The flavoring was there, showcasing a deeper malt profile, but we were a bit let down in the department of feel.  It was just a little light for the depth they’re going for.  This, unfortunately, slows down the drinker, tricking them into thinking the flavors are lighter than they actually are.  This is not the case in the nose, as we felt this to be its strongest aspect.  This is a great Ohio beer, and one we would certainly seek out again, but we can’t help but feel that we prefer something more substantial to quench this thirst."

"This brew has a classic IPA profile, with just enough fruitiness to keep it interesting, but an old-school, knock-in-the-teeth bitterness that should make hop heads smile in reminiscence."

"Pours a relatively clear, orange color with a thick, compact, doughy, white head. Lines and bands of lacing. Aroma is filled with pungent, musty oranges and onion notes. Spicy hops. Soft, sweet, sugary malt. Flavor just smacks you with upfront citrus. Grapefruit uprising. Piney and grassy and hempy. Tropical fruitiness (mango, specifically) is detectable but starts to burn off by the aggressive bitterness. A submissive maltiness is a bit toasty. Percussive bitterness. Moderate carbonation. Resinous. It always feels good to finally nab a beer you've been eyeing and it also isn't a letdown. This beer is mightily hoppy. Bottled offering."

"O: A nice IPA.  Could use some work to clean up bottling practices at this small local Ohio brewery. Needs to be crystal clear, with only a hint of yeast haze if it is bottle conditioned.  Great deep golden color, phenomenal aroma and clean flavors.  A cleaner aftertaste would be preferable.  I'd drink another though. 7/10 or 3.75 stars."

"pours  a clear golden color, bright white head.  good head retention, and it leaves rings of lacing. nice strong hoppy aroma - floral, citrus.   just a touch of malt in the taste before the same hoppy flavors take over.  neither sweet nor dry.  medium body and carbonation, appropriate for the style.   overall - nice flavors and balance."
""
"This is awesome. This is an IPA. The smell is massively grapefruit. The taste is a mix of lots of pine, grapefruit, citrus, and a citrus rind. It's delightfully bitter. If you like hops, IPAs, or a nice bitter aftertaste, this is hard to match. I would definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a rolling, huge, off-white head.  Color is a clear amber.  Smells of resin, pine and subtle peach.  Tastes earthy with a wave of citrus, a slight chalkiness, orange peel and subdued spice.  Medium-bodied with a touch of alcohol heat.  Straight up IPA awesomeness."

"This is my second bottle of this beer and I am glad I reviewed this one. The aggressive citrus hops are dominant but layers of other hop notes mix in nicely. This shows that modern IPAs dont jusy have to be a hop fruit juice. Packs a nice punch but delivers waves of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Head Hunter is a world class brew no doubt. It has me blown away with its aroma and yet even after turning into a completely different take through the flavor profile it still produces some fine results all the way around. Fat Heads brew some very good stuff and Head Hunter is up there with the best of them. A great year round offering but must be enjoyed fresh. It took me awhile to find it fresh, but drinking a few of these less than 2 weeks old really made the wait worthwhile. A must try! And one ill enjoy again."

"I poured it into a glass, it has a gold color body with a small head to it. The aroma has a piney smell to it. The taste is in your face hop explosion. Pine notes and slight bitterness follows. The mouthfeel is good, well balanced and leaves a hop aftertaste on your tongue."

"Overall: This was really talked up. In terms of aroma, it met and exceeded my expectations. But the malt profile is a little lacking for me. I like balance, and this is not balanced. For those who really like the West-coast IPA style, I can see this being off the charts."

"Overall (4.0): This is, on its face, a technically excellent IPA, I think. It doesn’t really blow me away, though, in any regard. That said, every part of it is enjoyable (thought the lacing was unexpectedly lackluster), and it’s a beer that I would recommend to any IPA lover—especially those that like spicier ones. I'd be willing to bet that this is stupidly good on cask."
"If you like unrelenting IPAs and are a self-proclaimed hophead who wants a beer that tastes like sucking on a hopcone, here ya go. I really enjoy this beer (ESPECIALLY the aroma), and I like it more as it warms for about ten to fifteen minutes. Buy it if you find it."

"You can definitely smell the cascade and taste the simcoe. It's light to medium with quarter inch head. It's a beautiful light copper color (probably crystal 20 or 30 in the malt). Overall great IPA. Will definitely be added to my regular rotation (if it ever gets any cheaper)!"

"A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really liked this IPA"
""
""
"The taste of the beer is surprisingly balanced considering the hop-heavy aroma. Although the beer is very much hop forward. A sticky hop flavor that lingers on your tongue for quite a while."

"Big ups, no wait, big big ups, to kgncfl for gracing me with a bottle of this longtime want. Well worth the wait. A fruity, juicy bomb that goes down aggressively and easily at the same time. Extra shot of hops on the finish. Highly recommended. Possibly a permawant for me."

"Nothing out of the ordinary in regards to the appearance and smell, but what sets it apart is the darkness and hop punch in the taste. Lots of bitter citrus grapefruit and piney dryness. And as much of a hop bomb as it is, it finishes smoothly so you're quick to come back for more."
""
"Poured from the tap, nice golden color, good carbonation, nice thick head and lacing all the way down. The aroma has great floral hop and citrus scent. Flavor is perfectly balanced. Good malt base, with great and well balanced hop flavor and bitterness. This is really one of the best IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
"O - very nice and refreshing IPA. Not to take away from this too much, but it reminds me of a couple others with similar flavor profiles that I prefer a little more than this one. Still really solid IPA either way."

"The Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA is an outstanding beer. I first tried this off the tap on only rated it. But my wife recently visited Ohio and stopped by a beer store to kindly pick me up a bottle. The beer poured a clear golden color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent was fresh hops bordering on bitterness and pine. The taste was crisp and bordered more on bitter with touches of sweet malt and pine like hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer and would recommend it to any one who like the Z'Dust."
""
"O- this is my favorite IPA to date. Any true hop heads will love this one. Introduced my friend to it and this got him into the style. I wish I had regular access to these"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas.This is probably one of the best IPA's I've had. Great display of hops, very well balanced and a highly drinkable."

"This would be rated a little higher if it weren't for the bitter end. This was bottled 02/24/14, I am sure a fresh bottle would score higher."

""
""
"o: Really nice IPA that just isn't quite top tier to me."
"Poured into a snifter a rich yellow body with a small head. Down to tiny ring with a bit of lacing. Smell wasn't big but what was there was tropical fruit and sweet malt. Taste was a very good balance of hop and malt. Here you get the grapefruit with very little bitterness and sweet caramel malt. Very pleasing to the palate with slight carbonation and very little bitterness. Solid brew that could be an everyday for me."

"O- being from the cleveland area.. this is very easy to get.. ive had it before really liked it.. it belongs in my top 10 but there are 4 or 5 beers i like better than this one.. if you come to cleveland visit fatheads.. they do a great job"
""

"O: Amazing. My all-time favorite beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A nice, delicious IPA with big, tasty hops. Very drinkable. If this were available in my area it would definitely be a go-to."

"A great IPA, been looking to try this one for a while now."
""
""
"O- This is a stand by in this area and you can see why. Very underrated beer that should be getting a lot more attention from national beer drinkers. Classic west coast style IPA but it does fall short of the upper echelon IPA's. Do yourself a favor and get this beer if you haven't."
"Food pairing- very sweet desserts like carrot cake, caramel cheesecake or crime brûlée. Also for a more robust plate try smoked beef brisket with this ale"
""
"This bottle is about 4 weeks old, poured into the Spiegelau glass. Looks clear, carbonated, and a beautiful deep hue. Aromas are off the hook. Big citrus, a hint of pine, orange juice, fresh smelling as can be. Love everything about these aromas. Huge hit of citrus on the front end, major bitterness (and so clean), and strong backbone. To me, this drinks like a big DIPA. Clean mouthfeel with a bitter note that reminds you of the freshness. This is a awesome IPA. One of my very tip top. Get it!"
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color with a hint of amber. Off white head that holds fairly well before fading into a medium collar and wisps of head across the surface. Fair lacing. Aroma is bold citrus (grapefruit and lemon) with some resiny pine and a bit of pineapple. Medium body and high carbonation with a good hop bite. Taste is complex. Grapefruit, pineapple, pine and floral hops all intermingle and compete for attention. The aftertaste is piney, grapefruit in the front. I had this with two weeks from bottling and the flavors were much more pronounced and played better. This was written from a 3.5 week old bottle."

"This is a great IPA with an amazing taste and a smell that's even better! Golden tint with light amber in color, with great head and nice even lacing around the glass. The spicy, citrus, and pine nose really started thing off great and the beer tastes almost as good as it smells. A bit of bitterness, but the sting leaves the tongue after a few sips... I taste hints of heavy citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, roasted carmel, and even a little bit of spiciness which is my favorite thing about this brew. This is one of my favorite IPAs I've tried as of recently, I would for sure recommend it to any IPA lover!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA is a heavily malted and aggressively hopped palate wrecker of an IPA. I personally would have preferred less caramel malt sweetness on the front end and less hop bitterness on the finish, but the same amount of overall flavor. This reminded me a lot of some old-school West Coast IPAs that were deemed ""extreme"" before the age of extreme beers."
""
""
""
""
"One of the better IPA's I have had here in Pittsburgh! This was a delicious beer, poured a nice golden/orange color and smelled of grapefruit, citrus, hops, pine, and a bit of lemon. Once I tasted it I was hooked! Crisp clean IPA taste! If you find this beer I highly recommend drinking this one! Two Thumbs Up!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had fresh on tap. Looks decent. Smell is probably one of the best IPAs I have ever smelled. Floral fruity hoppy goodness. Tastes great. Just enough sweetness. Blossoms in your mouth. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Up there with 90 minute IPA and Jai Alai. If you find it, drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: no doubt its a well brewed and well received beer. but the lemony hops just make for a mixture I don't dig in an IPA"
"A very bright and clean IPA, punches you in the mouth, bitterness is turned up a few notches similar to Southern Tier 2XIPA. Hop fix is well satisfied and I took this one down way too quickly."

"Pours golden copper with a big soapy head. The nose is full of pine, lemon, and hop resin, with perfumy hops and clean malty sweetness. Bitter grapefruit hop flavors abound, but are kept in check with caramel malt, toasted oat notes, and sweeter fruits like pineapple. The end result is a tasty, balanced brew that is straightforward without being one-note. Mouthfeel is medium and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Headhunter is a beautifully done, grapefruit-forward IPA that hits all the right notes. The flavors are simple but bold and delicious. At 7.5% it's bordering on DIPA status but maintains the lighter, smoother body of a great IPA. A classic that makes me glad I live where it's always on the shelf."

"* If Fat Head increases their market area, this beer will become huge... Calling it now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice golden amber on the pour. Nose is pretty standard, but nice pine and floral hop scents -- a little less tropical fruit than some. Flavor makes it squarely a ""Midcoast"" IPA (I.e. Midwest take on a West Coast style). Pungent hops are warmed over with a heavy pour of sweet, gooey malt. The proceedings are well balanced and clean. Good beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the holy grail. Beautiful copper pour into snifter with nice head and awesome citrus and smash mouth hop aroma. This beer is what others aspire to be. Great malt balance and hop head kick you in the mouth. Matt and Fat Heads hit a grand slam with this classic."
""
""
"O: extremely pleased to have this available on draft throughout Ohio/Columbus. And there are some stores around (Meijer, Trader Joes, Weilands) that always seem to have the freshest batch available in bottles."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful, clear golden orange with a half inch fluffy, off-white head. Simmers down to a slim film, leaving spider web lacing on the glass. Citrus fruits shine through the first whiff, followed by a malt, caramel sweetness. All of which play nicely off each other. Citrus fruits, grassy notes flow across the tongue first. The malt flavors finish it off. Another medium body IPA, that's smooth and finishes with a nice bitterness. Overall, another fantastic IPA from the Midwest."
""
""
""
"Could pass as a DIPA with how it hits with bitterness and hop character."

"O- This is one of my favorite IPAs. It has much of the things I look for in a great IPA. It has a big hop presence and a nice medium sweetness and is very easy to drink. I try to go to Indiana or Ohio and grab some whenever I can. Wish it came in 6 packs though, I mean if Bell's can do 2Hearted in 6ers and this seems to be just as equally hopped, just with 3 hops instead of 1, then surely this can be put in 6ers."
"Overall: It's hard to pull off an IPA of this caliber, and Fat Head's has done it! An AIPA done to near perfection and one of my favorites in the style. I feel lucky to have a regular (fresh) supply of this. If you're a hop head, this would be a great go to locally, and certainly worth a trade. Highly recommended!"
"O: A punch you in the mouth brew for those who truly love their hops !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's really well made, but it is not quite making it up there with the big boys just yet. However, it is a great beer and one easily worth having again."

"Good smell and feel to it but the taste was disappointing to where it made we wonder how old it was or if it was a bad batch I got. There was a distinctive bad bitterness to the finish, hopefully not standard for this brew."
""
""
"O: A real solid IPA; which is becoming and has been the norm for most established breweries."
""
""
""
"Overall: Exactly what a great west coast IPA should be. Lots of different levels to this brew. Love this brighter tones which get balanced well by the malt and pine."
""
"Has a great golden look with good everything and a great citrus smell.  Only reason I downgrade the taste is because it's to bitter but has a good citrus taste as well.  Creamy but crisp feel with a full body.  Pretty good but like I said, to bitter for all the other taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A lot of hype for this IPA, and this brewery, so I was pretty psyched to get one as an extra. No bottle date, but I'm near-certain it was very fresh (certainly tasted fresh). Superb brew, serious hop bite, yet extremely well-balanced and each sip leaves you wanting more. Would love this one again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with some yeast sediment, two fingers of white foam that settles to a thin ring with big splotches of lace on the glass. Smell: grapefruit rind, apricot, big simcoe dank blast. Taste: tangerine, tropical note, rindy, soft biscuit in the back. Sweet, drying finish. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Tastes kind of like a Sculpin mixed with a Red Racer. Very good stuff that I would love to have access to locally."

""
"A fruity and very West Coast bitter IPA. Next to Columbus IPA and White Rajah, White Rajah won out slightly over this."
""
""
""
"This was one of my goal beers on my Ohio buying trip and I was not disappointed. This ale pours a very cloudy copper color with a ton of sediment (god I love unfiltered beers). The head is off white and short lasting but the lacing is quite substantial. The nose is a delicious blend of bitter hops; both citrus and pine. This offering smells very fresh and lively. The taste totally follows suit; all hops. It is a sparkling delicious and fresh ipa. Not complex but awesomely is what it is. Think hopslam but smoother and a little less in your face. This is a great beer and will pick up every time I'm in Ohio."

"This is my go to IPA. Living in Pittsburgh this is readily available all the time. This is an aggressive IPA, not an IPA starter. A nice grapefruit, tropical fruit flavors, with heavy floral notes. Hoppy in the front and in the finish. If you love an aggressive IPA this is the beer for you."
""
""

"O: Not bad. A bit malty, which isn't my style. Just not that memorable for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- So, I'm gonna say something I'm sure most will label as ""blasphemous""... If my memory serves me well, this beer is just as good as Heady Topper. And I love Heady. But there's really not much about this beer that could be done any better. It certainly looks nicer than that ugly Heady. On all fronts, this beer is just as good as, or better than, Heady. Come to think of it... I think I'll trade for some more Heady so I can do a side-by-side comparison. The point is... This is a phenomenal beer."
""
""
""
"O: Seriously good IPA. Big west coast in-your-face hoppiness. Good variety of hops, all equally balanced. Bitter and dry but not over the top. Crisp and refreshing. Just plain delicious, a treat to imbibe."

"O - 4.75 - This is an amazing beer. Most similar to La Cumbre Elevated or Ballast Point Sculpin. Just another example of why the overhyped IPAs aren't really as good as people say they are."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a well done DIPA. The balance here is excellent and the hop profile is quite tasty."
"O: Can't do much better. I was remiss to not rate this beer when I had it bottled literally 16 hours before. It was amazing them, it remains amazing even when it's *JUST* 4 days old. Freshness matters people."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is transparent orange, but hazy. Nose is citrusy and great. Taste is citrus, orange peel, grapefruit, pine. This is sweet, but not overly sweet, just right. The mouth is slightly creamy, which tames the citrus astringency just enough to make it perfect. This beer is more like an Imperial than an IPA so I enjoy it in a snifter, and sip on it. Could be the perfect beer. Hoppy, but the hop bite is a soft bite. Awesome. Bottle."

"O- I saw someone refer to this as their ""Pliny killer"" in a thread a while ago. Though my bottle isn't the freshest, neither was my bottle of Pliny I had and I wouldn't say this is even in the same league. Good but not mind-blowing."
"O: This is an American IPA done right. Big aroma, flavorfull, bitterness firm but not overpowering with a malt backbone to support the whole thing. Fat Head is doing some killer stuff."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is a very good IPA definitely will be getting some more soon."
""
""
""
"Fuller bodied than expected with stronger hop bitterness than the aroma suggests.  There's a blast of dank, earthy hop resins up front with sticky grass, pine needle and spruce tip flavors.  Nice amount of dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt into a bone dry finish.  Floral and perfume like at first followed by tropical and citrus fruit sweetness.  This isn't as strong as in the nose but nicely balances things out with some pineapple, grapefruit and orange zest.  Pale malt backbone adds balance without hindering the hop flavor.  Some bread and a decent amount of biscuit-like flavor.  Clean, crisp and pretty easy to drink but the bitterness could be balanced a little more by the sweeter fruit notes.  Still, this is a very good beer that I could session for long periods of time."

"Fairly good regional IPA, it gets a lot of love on here and I kind of get it.. but its certainly not among the best I've had. It's not mindblowingly good, while its a very well constructed, balanced IPA with good flavours. But well, maybe I just need to get into that proper Cleveland mindset."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm impressed. The flavors are great, the mouthfeel is great, the appearance is great, and the smell is great. I'd put this up there with 90 minute as one of the best IPAs available, and I'm especially impressed given that this is a small brewery. Bravo."

"The body was pretty typical for the style, crisp, clean, and dry. The bitterness lingered a bit too long on the finish for my tastes. Drinkability was pretty good, I could see having a few of these if I were in a hoppy mood. Overall, a very good example of the style. Is it an elite level beer? I don't know. But, I do know if this were available regularly to me, it would be on my rotation. Certainly worth trying if you see it."

"The pride of Pittsburgh- for beer-Even if brewed in Ohio. Had it on tap 2 years ago at Fatheads southside. Now thanks to my iron city in-laws gave procured multiple bottles. Let me first say there is no other IIPA that can hold a candle to this beer'S aroma- pungent pine, spruce, freshly cut grass. I would buy for the aroma itself. Great bitterness and mouthfeel and the flavor lingers of summer evergreen nights and bitter grapefruit mornings. Great balance and finish. Have had it on tap and most recently in bottle. This review orompted by cellar temp drinking. So so good and satisfying. A hidden gem, kinda like the iron city. Find it in pittsburgh and not much farther but so worth the physical and beer drinking trip. Cheers"
""
""
"I wish I could get this everyday here in eastern PA. If I could, it would be a staple in my fridge. Excellent beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an awesome citrus hop presence that makes this one super easy to drink."

"O- So many flavors coming from this beer yet nothing overshadows anything. Love the tropical pineapple notes, it is very packed with flavor but still has the superior drinkability of an IPA. Very well done."

"The taste is great ! I love the fresh squeezed citrus juice flavors from the hops with a blend of grapefruit and valencia orange-tangy juicy taste that spreads out and reveals some vegetative flavor from the more than ample dry hopping with a light spice and very gentle malt sweetness. Overall this deserves the accolades as it is a well crafted American IPA, better than some of my previous favorites -I recommend picking some up if you possibly can!"

"Flavorful, pretty heavily-hopped like current west-coast style quad-hopping (I am currently judging all IPAs by the standard of having experienced Heady Topper). Carbonation is a bit on the aggressive side. Overall a pretty well balanced IPA. Not an Imperial but very drinkable. I liked the beer, and the friendliness of the brewery."

"Damn near one of the best IPAs on the market. Love the aroma, really punches you in the nose with citrus and piney notes. Great pour, perfect head with nice lacing. Great hoppy taste, but you still recognize that their is malt in their, not all bitterness. Easily worth getting an entire case of cause it is so easy to drink. Solid all around."
""
"Initial impression was good. Good carbonation. Maybe too good. Bubble size on my tongue reminded me of soda. Lacing lingered for the entire glass. Hop aroma was a little cat pissy for my taste, but this is a west coast style ipa after all. Grapefruit notes are pleasant but the aftertaste grabs the back of the tongue and is a bit harsh to my taste. As the beer warmed, i picked up hints of pineapple in both smell and taste. The beer drinks easily enough though, and I found myself at the bottom of the glass fairly quickly. I would recommend this beer to a friend."
""

"Really great and unexpected IPA, one of the best I have ever had."

"Medium body with a good amount of carbonation to keep the tongue dry and thirsty. Big bitterness on this IPA, and it lingers quite a while."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really delicious IPA from Fat Heads, a definite Ohio gem. The balance is very nice, the bitterness is kept in check and it's got a great dry finish. It does strike me as a fairly simple IPA, not too complex but that isn't really a bad thing. Definitely worthy of the accolades!"

"Pours a clear orange with a white, three-fingered head. Retention is very good with good lacing. This is what an American IPA should look like! Aroma dominated by grapefruit and pineapple, followed by resinous pine. Little malt sweetness to speak of, the nose is all about hops! Classic west coast IPA. Bitterness dominates the palate, pine resin up front, grapefruit rind right behind. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, Head Hunter finishes dry, with strong astringency. Overall, a supremely crafted IPA in the West Coast style!"

"Dark honey yellow in color with a heavy chill haze. Poured with a big frothy foam that reduced to a thick cap that never faltered. Huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aromas, ripe orange and pineapple, with faint pine hop notes in the distance. Hop aromas are delicate enough to allow sweet caramel to show through beneath the hoppiness. Medium bodied with a slight oily feel and aggressive, but not fizzy carbonation. Pungent citrus hop flavors down the middle with pine hops on the edges. Nice sweet caramel malt backbone keeps the bitterness in check. Citrus flavors taper through the middle as the pine hops take over to the end. Finishes with a strong, lingering pine hop bitterness. A nice variety of hop aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, what a a great beer. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Delicious and full of flavor. I am never disappointed with Fat Heads Brewery & Saloon. Very pleased with this brew and I have since recommended it to many. Very excited to get this again."
""
""
""
""
"Lightly toasted malt up front. Citrus rind and herbal hop bitterness quickly follows. Bitterness swells, with notes of lots of citrus, pine, and resinous danky hops. Toffeish malt with fruit notes provide a little malty sweetness. Lots of grapefruit and dank resinous hop flavor and bitterness dry out the palate into the finish. Lingering citrus and pine. Medium bodied, with a slightly creamy feel. Very nice."
"Says bottled July 30, 2013, enjoyed August 2, 2013. That is fresh, and I am impressed that it got to Florida within a day from Ohio (arrived at shop on July 31!). Pours a yellowish orange, hazy, with a very small white head. Aroma is big mango and pine hops, grapefruit, pineapple, lots of citrus. Flavor is a nice big bitter with beautiful mango flavor with hints of lime zest. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Good beer."

"O: This is my 3rd bottle of this, and I have liked it less and less each time. Might be palate change, or being spoiled by VT IPAs, but I used to think this was world class. To me, it's just middle of the road now."
""
"Small white head on a hazy, copper body. The foam settles moderately and leaves nice lace. A very nice citrus and dank pine aroma. Sweet malt in the flavor with a bit of pine and sweaty hops. Medium thick body, average carbonation, and a balanced finish. Very nice, the aroma really shines with a great combination of citrus and tropical fruit."

"Bottle: Poured a bright clear orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some a good lacing. Aroma consists of fruity ester with some citrus hoppy notes and light sweet malt notes. Taste is also dominated by citrusy hops with fresh sweet fruity notes and some lightly sweet malt notes with limited level of bitterness. Body is about average with good carbonation. Definitely above standard IPA from those guys."

"O: Meh. Solid Meh. I have had worse, and have had a whole lot better. I know some of my ohio brethren love this beer, but I really don't see anything special about it. Aroma was pleasant, but everything else was quite sub par. Might just be spoiled living double lives in SoCal and the Vt/NH border, but I can get far better in both states easy. This was an extra on a trade though, so it could be past freshness. Who can say though because THERE WAS NO DATE ON THE BOTTLE..."

"Proper west coast IPA from Ohio. Wouldn't mind having this one again."
"Mouthfeel: Head hunter is a medium bodied beer that has great taste and keeps me wanting more. Darn good IPA out of Ohio that I would put up against any IPA out there."

"If you are a hop head you will love this beer. If super hoppy, super bitter beers that ravage your taste buds and leave you unable to taste anything else the rest of the night aren't your thing, you might want to avoid this beer."

"This must be one of the most festive IPAs I've ever had. All these flavors come together beautifully, and the texture is easy to down as any viscous, fruit forward wine. My favorite part other than the fruitiness is the undeniable wetness that this holds - in fact, its lack of dryness makes it scarily quaffable. This beer has been romanticized to death, recently, and I can see why. It reminds me of many different IPAs across the country, but holds on its own as pretty unique. Great stuff - can't wait to get more!"

"Overall: I had this on draft a few years ago at the Fat Heads Saloon in Pittsburgh. Still an awesome beer."
"Poured a two week old bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice orangish gold with a two finger head . Smell is pine upfront with some great citrus in the background. Taste is fantastic. Similar to aroma an initial bitter rush of pine finished with a grapefruit kick that stays with you. A nice dry finish makes it an easy drinker that hides the abv well. One of the best ipas out there to me. Happy to live within walking distance and get this on a regular basis."

"Pours a rich, coppery color with a thick foam. The nose is not very strong, so you're not really sure what you're in for. However, the flavors in this one are so good, I almost put the whole bottle down before I had time to type up the review. It has just a touch of malt to it, but the piney notes assure you that the hops are in control. The overall mix of bitter flavors are excellent, and while they are aggressive, they're not too, well, ""too."" It lingers in your mouth long after the liquid is gone, but not in a way that makes you need to clean it out. It's a great beer that I wish I had unlimited access to in my area."

"As I pour this one into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass I first seem to get very little, but quickly find out I was wrong. My head gets to the top of my glass and trickles over at around 3 fingers. Head is a soft doughy beige in tone. Tones of lace is left behind with nice retention. Body is a bold copper amber in tone. The whole look itself is very enticing. Nose is of fresh cut grass and grapefruit rind. There is a hint of lemon zest and pepper also. All in all the nose is a bit soft. With first sip you get a creamy bitter dance on the tongue. The rind tones really build up the bite as you drink. Piny and rustic with layers of deep dry hops. Really develops well as you enjoy this on. It did start a bit on the soft side but finishes wonderfully. Mouthfeel is one that really hangs on and is monstrously bitter(in a good way)."
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, sticky and lingering on the tongue. Easily a top tier IPA worthy of the accolades and bouquets people continually throw its way."

"Been wanting to try this for a while, and it is solid, but not all the way good. I think that it may be just a little past its prime."

"O - I would love to drink this beer again. Although sadly I don't see myself drinking it. I was travelling to Pittsburgh and was given it at a party in exchange for a heady topper. I would recommend this beer to anyone and everyone. Definitely one of my favorites."
""
"Very glad to finally get to try this one!"
""
""
""
"Overall-very surprised by this one. I was not expecting this much bitterness. To me this seems like a DIPA in everyway but the feel. I actually got this a big box grocery store that didn't have much of a selection, expect for this two day old IPA. Go figure. At $9.99 a four pack I can't complain at the price point either. All in all this is a truly great Ohio beer, okay, one of the best Ohio beers. 4.75"

"Overall - This one might take a little time to get the most out of, let it warm up a little and take your time to notice the different parts of the taste wave. Sounds weird but this one is both hearty and smooth at the same time. It might not be best-in-class but I would recommend it for sure, quite unique in regards to what I have had so far."

"Pours a clear deep golden color with a decent white head that slowly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of citrus, pine, resin, dankness, and a hint of green onion with a solid bread and light caramel to back it up. The flavor sweet enough to remind you that this is beer with hints of brown bread and light sugar and a boatload of dank hoppy goodness. Resinous pine with hints of garlic and green onion and a light bit of citrus with a moderate level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. This is a really nice IPA, I'm glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Good balance of bittering and flavoring hops with a light, biscuity malt backdrop. Pretty west-coasty, and I could imagine it would be even better straight from the bright tank. It really does have a smoothness to it that is rare for a bitter IPA, it flows flawlessly from floral/citric hop flavor to a crackery malt then finishes nicely bitter. When the beer is gone before the review is finished...thats when you know it is good!"
""
""
""

"Delicious but everyone knows this. Finishes very dry and it would be easy to put away a few of these."

"best ipa ive ever had - better then the elder, zombiedust, etc... i love it. ive had it on tap and in bottle. i live in pittsburgh, where we have a fatheads, but i say definitely worth the pain to get it. it is 100% over the top and aggressive. not for fair weather ipa fans."

"O: 4.5 - I was really looking forward to drinking this beer after hearing and reading all the hype surrounding it, and, albeit I enjoyed it, it didn't live up to expectations; however, I think that this is really personal taste more than anything; as I drink more IPAs and imperial IPAs, I realize that my favorite aspect is probably the big hop aroma and flavors with minimal bitterness; this is definitely a bitter IPA really tasting those 87 IBUs, and there was a more tropical DIPA on tap (IBUsive) that I preferred (see that review too if you'd like); suffice it to say, if you like Bell's Hopslam, you'll like this one too and don't let my bitterness hold you back"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Absolutely wonderful. World-class is a correct designation, though I may be biased since this is from my home state. But for the style of the American IPA, this is about as good as it gets before getting into DIPA territory. Totally worth seeking out. Excellent stuff, refreshing, and powerful all at the same time."

"Clear amber pour with a full finger of frothy white head that retained well and laced the glass nicely. Nice aroma of fresh hops, pine and grapefruit, distant pale malt base. Crisp and juicy. The taste reflected the aroma, with a nice blast of fresh hops, oily citrus, resinous pine, light biscuity pale malts somewhere off in the distance, bringing in a sense of balance, but ensuring that the hop profile is still the dominant factor. Perhaps nothing you wouldn't expect, but nevertheless, this is pretty much exemplary of the style. Medium body, crisp mouthfeel, super drinkable."

"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Off white head, low to moderate retention. Clear lacing on a clear, light copper body. Aroma is dominated by intense, resinous, piney, grassy, hoppy goodness. Taste is biting and bitter, intensely hopped, I'm sure the malt backbone is in there somewhere. Totally out of balance and totally delicious. Delivers on the promises made on the label. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great IPA, would drink it any day."
""
""
""
""
"I'd heard rave reviews about this beer and it didn't disappoint. While potent, it's enjoyable for the style and dare I say, easy to drink. Sure, you won't feel your tongue after a while, but it's so worth it."
"Slightly oily body that is a mix of gold and orange full of citrus taste. The carb is on point and helps guide the hop profile across the palate. This IPA is west coast all the way. Distinctly bitter that is delicious cold and becomes a bit overpowering as it warms."
""
""
"Exquisite and a sure winner for serious hop-heads."
"O-A great IPA, one of the best out there. Balance and the range of hop flavors was great."
""
""
"O- Despite its huge bitterness this is still a very drinkable beer, the hop profile is killer, a great beer overall. The fruitiness also is just awesome, overall this is one of the better Midwestern IPAs I've had in a very, very long time."
"O: This is an good IPA. Not worth actively seeking out, but if you can get it thrown in as extras then go for it."

"Pours a classic sunset orange color with a finger length white head that goes down slowly and leaves a thick lacing. Pretty good carbonation comign off the glass. Smells like an ipa should. Lots of resinous pine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, maybe some papaya. Tiny bit of a bready malt presence. Pretty dry. Taste starts with the resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange. Then there is a decent malt presence that brings some carmel and breadiness to balance it a little. Very resinous, dry finish with more pine, grapefruit, some pineapple, papaya, along with some sweetness to cut the hops. Almost like a bubblegum flavor. The hops get more abrasive as it goes down. Pretty hefty body for a single ipa. Creamy and surprisingly clean mouthfeel for such a hoppy beer due to the lively carbonation. Extremely well done ipa that lives up to the hype in my opinion.."
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. Now I know what all of the hype is about. Thanks Fathead's for making such a great beer."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable American IPA (possibly just on the edge of being a DIPA in my opinion) with very pleasant and strong grapefruit/citrus hops, which is a hop aroma/flavor profile that I like. I found the alcohol to be well hidden and this to be a pretty easy beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Damn, how did this fly under the radar for so long? This beer is fantastic. Any IPA fan will go nuts for this - very tropical and fruity aromas coupled with bitter and hoppy flavor profiles make for some of the best IPAs out there. Hopheads rejoice!"
""
""
""
"The beer was poured into a snifter and was a light copper color with a fluffy white head. Retention and lacing at the top of the class was appropriate. A huge aroma left an immediate impression with notes of grass and fruit. In terms of the initial taste, this might be the best single IPA I have ever heard. On the forefront, one detects pineapple, apple, orange, and a little grass. I can not get over hop big the grapefruit is in the initial taste. Though the taste does not seem as intense on later tastes, it is still wonderful. The mouthfeel proves to be quite bubbly which brushes away the taste all too soon. In the aftertaste, one detects orange rind and grass with a mild warming sensation. This is a really good example of the style."
"Overall I really like this beer. Drinks almost like zombie dust except slightly more bitter/less sweet, and just a little stronger. It's something I'd revisit maybe 2 or 3 times a year. Definitely worth picking up."

"Pours clear dark orange with big fizzy white head. Big aroma of citrus fruit, mango and spice. Flavor much more predominate. Notes of citrus and yeast. Medium body with excellent carbonation. Extremely bitter finish. Very nicely balanced though lacking in complexity."
"O: Yesterday I’d never heard of them, but today I’m singing their praises: this is one of the best IPAs I’ve had in a long time. It has an organic quality to it that reminds me that beer is just that: organic, a mixture of natural material. And what a product Fat Head’s has created with a little help from nature…"
""
""
""
"Absolutely one of the best IPAs out there. At first pour a nice amber color with nice head. Not overly carbonated. Smells of citrus and pine. At first taste a bitter yet delicious grapefruit hits the palette. The seconds taste and you are sucked in and nothing else matters. This stuff is great. Second only to Zombie Dust. For me this is easy to get. zombie Dust is harder than hell to find so this is my first choice. A must try for true IPA lovers."

"My favorite IPA. This beer smells wonderful, pours with a firm head and the finish is a hopheads dream. Living outside the Burgh, I've been to Fatheads a couple times and they never had this on tap! Always out. Now that they are bottling it, I love the availabilty of it. Alittle high priced, But LIFE'S TO SHORT TO DRINK CHEAP BEER! Tried to order a sixtel and was told they quit filling sixtels. BUMMER!! Maybe splurge on a 1/4 sometime."
"O: very very solid but not my favorite. Heady > Head Hunter."
""
"O- Like I said, this is a super bitter IPA, so if you like the bitterness you'll like it, and if not, you won't. The earthy, almost woody flavor is interesting and not something you see in the style every day. I'd say it's not as complex as the best of the best, but it's a very nice IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Also take note that this beer is year round, and for most PA and Ohio residents, this beer isnt too hard to grab. People get excessively excited about seasonal IPA brews, and overpay and over-hype it because its so darn hard to get. This IPA is as every bit as good as those, and much more obtainable. If you can get it, do it, I doubt you'll regret it."

"Poured 12oz bottle into tulip. Poured pretty clear orange with a nice two finger head. Smell is citrusy, pine, bready, tropical fruits. Taste is bitter hops up front with great cutrus flavors, great west coast style hops, piney, subtle malts, nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is right on. Overall this is a great IPA that hits you hard with bitter hops. The malty flavor takes a backseat to the piney, floral hops that dominate the flavor of this one. I had this at the brewery before they finally started bottling it, hope the distro keeps expanding so more people can experience superior Ohio brews."

"Big thanks to CruisaC for sending me this one. Orange-yellow color with the slightest haze, good thick foam of a head. Smells like resiny hops, a little . Flavor is super hoppy, very bitter finish, slight bit of malt holding it all together. Whew, this is very bitter. Overall a good IPA and it is what the label says but this can't touch the west coast.

"Well, I had a bottle of this on the same day I had both Columbus Bodhi and Columbus IPA on tap. Granted, the Bodhi is classified as a double, but that is both arbitrary and meaningless as I believe these beers are the same abv. In my know nothing but know what I like opinion, this beers gets smoked by both Columbus versions. The abrasive bitterness and shocking booziness give no quarter. Not nearly as good as its reviews for my tastes."
""
""
""
"a very very good ipa. clear and quite pale in color, a little darker than golden, call it bronze, with an inch or so of white suds. the nose is very fruity hops, citra maybe, pineapple and lemon attack the nostrils. flavor is more grapefruit than lemon, with equal parts tropical fruit. the hops taste just picked to me, full of resins and oils that i just love in an ipa. alcohol is strong, and can be tasted a bit in the finish, my only real critique of an otherwise near flawless brew. nice lighter medium body keeps it sessionable, and the carbonation is very bright, aiding in a clean crisp finish that gets more and more bitter as the beer warms up. perfect with a chilli chese burger stacked hugh with frito chips. god i want another. one of the more fruity and citrusy india pales in recent memory. this should make its way out to colorado, id be a regular on it."

""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is definitely one grassy, hoppy and bitter beer that smacks you with bitterness and does not relent throughout. A great example of the west coast IPA style, especially for being from Ohio. If you like big hoppy beers, definitely seek this one out."
""
"M - Medium body, creamy. Sticky and full of resinous hop oils. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
"A classic IPA that I've only really consumed at festivals in the midwest - aromas of fresh cut grass and dank citrus. Crisp and light but full on flavor - tangerine, tropical fruit, summer grass clippings, crackery malt. Really nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't want to slam this beer; people looking for the mouth-scraping-est IPA out there will probably like this. But, personally, I find it lacking in flavor and aroma hops that would make it a more interesting beer. Also, the diacetyl suggests the brewery may be rushing the beer out prematurely."
""
""
"I'm glad the midwest if offering some competition to the West Coast as IPAs are concerned. This beer brings it."
"O: A very nice beer and a fine example of the style. I've got to admit I come across my fair share of average IPAs - it's a crowded field - but it's always nice to still be able to find new and well made examples of the style."
""
""
""
""

"Pours an orange, gold color with about an inch of fluffy, yet sticky white head. Good retention and lacing. The aroma is loaded with grapefruit and spicy hops, with some grass, herbs, and pine resin in there as well. It tastes of spicy, earthen hops, with lots of pine and grass/herb notes. Loads of citrus come through as well - predominantly grapefruit, but some orange as well. Mouthfeel is bitter, slightly acidic, and dry on the finish. A piney resin seems to linger, accentuating the raw hop character. Overall, this is an awesome “west coast” IPA that really showcases a number of aspects of the hops: citrusy, earthen, and of course, bitter. Well done."
"I've heard a lot about this beer and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Nothing outrageous but incredible balance in the flavor and feel with a perfectly executed look and nose. Definitely wish this was a local for me."
"M: Medium bodied. Very easy drinking at 7%"
""
"Overall impression: A new favorite for sure. I still think Columbus IPA is #1 but this is in the ballpark. I'll be back for more of this."
"Medium body, with ample carbonation. Not much heat from alcohol. This is a very solid IPA."

"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."

"Well, might as well take advantage of the chance to try this on-tap. I think the nose on this might actually be more interesting than the bottled version. Very salty flavor profile though. A bit too much in that it masks a lot of the other citric and piney characteristics that are trying to show. Still a very nice IPA. Loud and brash, but still bringing enough to keep it respectable."

"O: A great IPA. Awesome nose, good drinkability. If the taste lived up to the nose, this would be on Pliny and Heady level."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really great IPA. With so at good IPAs out there, it's harder and harder to pick a ""best."" This one certainly belongs in the discussion. Hit a lot of notes and hit them very well."
"O: Wow. This deserved the hype it gets. A very tasty hop bomb to be sure. Very recommended if you can get your hands on some."
"The smell is by far the most impressive aspect of this beer: grapefruit, lemon, guava, fruit loops, pine. The first sip is monstrously pine forward with a oily resin. Playful carbonation in an amber body with nice carbonation. Very well done, albeit slightly unbalanced. This is the definition of hops."
""
""
"Pours orange with a little burntness to it and a nice thick, foamy white head. A nice juicy orange aroma on top of a sweet, bready malt base. Flavor starts off with the citrus out the game, the middle is more the bready malt, and it closes with the marriage of piney hops and malt with a decently bitter finish. A nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, Ohio with another solid IPA."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark gold with good sized head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides. This is a fantastic smelling beer. Just great hop character. Huge citrus aroma- lemons and grapefruit. Floral and slightly piney as well. Upfront bitterness and fairly bitter throughout. A little background sweetness but hops dominate the flavor. Big herbal and citrus hop flavor. Finishes with a nice lingering bitterness. Medium bodied. This IPA pulls no punches. Close to a DIPA. Pretty awesome."

"It started showing up in the local beer distributor. I (of course) picked up a case. It is good, but it definitely didn't stand out as much as it does on tap."
""
""
"O: Man this beer has hype. Rates great and is very solid. The roasted malts just dominate a bit too much for me. I'd prefer the citrus hops on the nose to follow through til at least the middle. For me, solid, too many other IPA's that I prefer."
""
"355mL second mega fresh bottle from Dan. Let’s try this again. Pours with a better, rockier, sheen, buttermilk head. Big retention and better, complete lacing. Nose has no off flavors, more peaches and cream, pineapple, vanilla. Taste is very West Coast in profile reminding me of Sculpin and Alesmith IPA up front, but finishing much more aggressively bitter with mega spruce tip and pine sap. Delicious. Palate is a bit too sharply bitter moving to slight sawdust. The aroma is quite inviting. Very nice stuff. Easy to love. Glad I got some extra bottles. 10/3/2012 8/4/8/3/16=3.9"
"Overall, this was an amazing IPA! I wish that I had more of these. My only complaint is the body on it but it didn't ruin or slow this beer down for a minute."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice example of the style. As noted, this is dry and bitter. I just wish it had a touch more body and malt flavors. Still, a very solid offering."
"O: Very good, deserving of praise for sure."
""
""
""
"Pours a strawberry copper color with a nice white head. Great lacing down the glass and very sticky. Smells outstanding on the nose. Apricots, resiny hops, strong grapefruit, and more hops. Very nice mouthfeel but very bitter. Maybe because I haven't had anything this hoppy in months, it caught me by surprise, but bitter and much lingering bitterness, but still a very good beer that is local, and I will jump at again."
""
"O: Very nice beer. The flavors are bright and refreshing. I'd drink this beer again. Solid."

"Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth feel, right on out of the bottle. So fresh and so clean, indeed, this one is a winner."
"Overall - It's really nice. Yes, it's too bitter, but it's a small fraction of the total experience, which is excellent."
""
"O - This is one awesome IPA. I could drink a few of these no problem. When fresh this is definitely one of the better IPA's on the market today."

"O: I had heard such great things about this beer and I was really excited to find the bottle in Pittsburgh. I didn't even really know they bottled it. Buy it if you see it, because I might just drink all of it."
"O: I wish there was as much fruit in the taste as the nose but this is still great stuff."
"Overall; pretty solid stuff, now that I think of it, it's actually quite similar to Jai Alai...lucky inhabitants of Ohio ;-)"
""
"This is a top notch IPA and and enjoyed every last bit of it. I'd recommend seeking it out. Thanks to JM03 for including it as a generous extra."
""
"O: Phenominal west coast IPA! Wish I could get it here on the western side of the state."
""
"Big thanks goes out to JM03 for sending this one my way as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, and subtle apple juice. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, bitter hop, and subtle pine resin. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really liked what is going on in this one. There was tons of pine notes going on, but it had a nice touch of fruit to help balance it out and leave your palate feeling refreshed for a moment. After that moment the hops come flooding in to carry what is left of your palate away. A really well done brew that should be enjoyed by anyone who calls themselves a hop-head."
"This blurs the line between IPA and DIPA with a remarkable amount of aggressiveness. Personally, I think it's a bit too oily and pithy. It's great, but not something I would want all the time... It could be a bit more drinkable."
"O - Excellent, just how I like my IPAs. Bitter, with just a touch of sweetness mid palate. Depths of hop flavor in this one. They only need bottle dating on it now."
""
""
"In my top 5 IPAs of all time."
""
"O - a fine example of the style."

"Fat Head's Head Hunter is a fantastic IPA that doesn't simply deliver ""proper"" IPA flavor or become complacent on making an ""error free"" beer. It pushes further into the smooth bitterness, ultimate dryness, and intangible fruity hop flavors and aromas that begin to separate it from the rest."
""
""
""
"I will definitely seek this one out again. And again."
""
"Aggressively unbalanced with enough going on with the hop profile to make it interesting and tasty. The best kind of aggressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"""Uncivilized & Aggressive. No other ingredient stirs the passion of a master brewer like the hop. Inspired by this legendary flower we challenged ourselves to create a world class IPA. Head Hunter is an aggressively dry-hopped uncivilized, West Coast-style IPA with a huge hop display of pine, grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. A punch-you-in-the-mouth brew for those who truly love their hop! Love the lupulin. Dig the dank. Respect the resin. Do not age, Hoppy beers are best consumed fresh."""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is just downright aggressive. Hopheads seek it out. I am thrilled to have gotten the oppurtunity to sip on this wonder from Ohio, but it really pushed my palate to the max. I think that I have gotten all the hop flavors that I need for the whole week from this beer alone!"
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a slightly hazy copper color, there was a white foamy head on top. The lacing was sticky and hung on the glass nicely. The smell of the beer was loaded with hops. Very nice aromas ranging from floral to fruity. The taste of the beer is piney, and has a nice balanced malt sweetness to it in there. The mouthfeel is smooth with a subtle carbonation to it. Overall I believe that it's pretty damn good, I'd still put a few others before it but still worth having."
""
""
"O- Good IPA with big floral, pine and grass hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some thick soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, orange zest, pine, pineapple, floral, mango, grass, and herbal spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and hop complexity. Taste of huge grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, floral, caramel, grass, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, pineapple, floral, caramel, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop flavors; with just enough malt balance to not make the bitterness overpowering. Almost no cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbontion and body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an amazing IPA as expected. Awesome hop complexity and balance; very crisp and smooth to sip on. Outstanding."
""
""
"O: I like this beer a lot. I've had several big name IPA's. Pliny, Hop Slam, Ruination, Devil Dancer, Sculpin, Dreadnaught etc....This beer hangs in there with all of them. Quickly becoming one of my favorites. Another great beer from the Midwest."
"Top 5 IPA for me easy. Well balanced...a lot of everything, hah. Just want to drink this all night and wreck my palate. Thanks MaxSpang! I need more!"

"Great full mouthfull without being too heavy."
"Sample at the brewery. Pour is golden color with off white head. Aroma is strong pine with some citrus mixed in. Has a medium mouthfeel. Flavor is strong pine and citrus hops upfront. Leads to a nice caramel touch with more pine hops to the finish. A real hop blast. My favorite on their list. This one is for hopheads only."
""

"edit: I've had this on draft and in bottle. Like any beer, batches can vary from time to time, hop batches vary from year to year, etc. However, for the most part, this beer is consistently solid. 5/5"

"A nice IPA but not sure I would consider this world class. Easy drinking, refreshing, and good. I really don't have many bad things to say about this beer but I'm not blown away. Good, not great."
"Medium bodied, it's actually creamier than I anticipated. Refreshing, and very smooth."
"Head Hunter is a really impressive release from Fat Heads Brewery & Saloon. It’s not perfect, but it is an excellent American IPA. Personally, I’d prefer just a little less toasted malt flavor. It’s a small complaint, but less would be more there. Very good stuff in any event. Definitely worth seeking out."
""
" Very satisfying, the light carbonation and taste make this a pleasure to drink."
"O: An aggressively hopped ipa that should probably fall into dipa category. This one is a keeper. Thanks again Stormking47."
"This is one beer that is better in the bottle. I've always enjoyed Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA on tap, but I have to say it was never one I craved or sought out. But, Fat Head's bottling is different ... in a very good way. Whatever, they did to capture the piney, citrusy, oily esters and resins in the bottle please keep doing it. The mildly high ABV hides beautifully behind zesty grapefruit, spicy hops, fresh cut grass, and biscuity maltiness. A very well-balanced and well-done IPA bottling that I crave and will seek out. Thankfully, I can find it, for now, right in my local grocery store. Bonus!"
""
"Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA is a remarkable example of what an American IPA should taste like. The aroma is pleasnat and the taste is really oustanding! I am so glad that it is being bottled now. It would be great if Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon bottled more of their products in the future. Head Hunter IPA is certainly worth tracking down at your neighborhood bottle shop if possible."

"EDIT: I have now had this beer numerous times and had to upgrade the appearance rating after experiencing floaties on several occasions. As if this beer wasn't good enough already, now its appearance is starting to remind me of Heady Topper. Bravo!"

"o - overall i understand all the accolades and medals boasted about on the label, this beer is a winner. if anything, i'd ask for a bit more sweetness to balance things out a bit more, but this one is unapologetic. deliciousness."

"O- This was a very well done IPA. Right up there with all the top-notch IPAs I've had- Hill Farmstead, Heady Topper, Gandhi-Bot, etc.. Probably not my top favorite, but definitely in my favorites. I loved how the mouthfeel and the awesome lingering aftertaste. I highly recommend seeking this out. A+"
""
""
"Wow simply an amazing IPA. Had on draft at Melt in Independence. Strong smell of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Taste is very strong citrus with some pine notes. If you like Heavy Seas Loose Cannon, you will love this beer. It's a much better version of this style of brew."
"S: Lots of citrus hops with just tons of pineapple, along with some mango and tangerine.  A noticeable sweet malt backbone.  Subtle hints of juniper/pine.  Really quite wonderful.  "
"O: There are a lot of great IPAs out there, and although this one is very good, for me it falls short of the top tier.  The aroma is excellent, but the taste is rather run of the mill (in terms of good IPAs that is) with a rather simple, albeit strong, piney bitterness without a whole lot else going on.  Don't get me wrong, I would never turn down this beer if it were offered to me, however, I wouldn't seek it out as there are a number of IPAs distributed to the Southeast that I think are superior to this one.  "
""
"There are so many great AIPAs, but this one is way up at the top. I must buy this again and again!"
"The beer pours a clear amber with a thin white head. The nose is pure citrus hops that evolves into a balanced sweet citrus. The taste is incredibly citrusy and bitter with a crisp hop cone finish. Although this beer is immensely hoppy it's very drinkable and tasty. I can't wait to see it on tap in buffalo."

"Seek this beer out. A fresh bottle will bring a flavor-gasm to your tastebuds. Get Some!!"

"Mouthfeel is clean as a whistle, and slightly carbonated without being harsh at all. 7.5% abv is accurately tasted and felt. Leaves mouth feeling fresh and only slightly sticky. Overall this is one of the easiest drinking IPAs I've had the pleasure of having. My favorite beers are arguably grapefruity IPAs, so this one will be remembered and sought after for a while."
"(O) I really am enjoying this offering and I consider it one of the better dry hopped IPA's that I have had the opportunity to enjoy. Highly Recommended."

"O I was completely floored by this extra, everything was solid. Thanks Brian."

"Overall quite nice. Great hop additions with just enough malt balance and sweetness."
"Last two bottles from blue dust. Poured kinda flat little head with some lacing. Amberish copper color, pretty transparent.(3.5)Then came the first sniff. Amazing hops and fruit mixtures that great Ipas are made of. A hint of malt on light side but some kind dry hoppedness all over place, really good nose. Taste has me thrown back to when I thought df 60 min was best ipa . This is world class! Resonates great hop taste for some time after. Delicious hop and Med carbonation that will have you nursing it if its your last! My second was more heady and even better tasting so changing to my favorite ipa out!!"
"O - An excellent American IPA. Very drinkable, refreshing, and full of robust hop flavors. Worth checking out."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of caramel malt. I think the taste follows the aroma, it tastes mostly like pine and citrusy hops, with a teeny bit of caramel malt noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and oily with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's nice to see this brew in bottles, I've heard about it for a while now but finally was able to try it today and it didn't disappoint! It's certainly one of the best Ohio IPA's (and IPA's in general) along with White Rajah and Columbus IPA. Definitely worth trying if you have a chance to get it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The only modest drawbacks I see have to do with a mouthfeel that seems thinner than the flavor/aroma would dictate and a fighter color which belies the complexity and intensity of flavor found in this ale. Well done Fat Head! The closest think to my version of a perfect IPA!"
""
"Overall - Top 5 ipa ive ever had. I loved going to fatheads to drink this but i like having a bottle of it even more. Excellent world class ipa, smooth, tasty and hoppy as hell, a must try."
"O: A serious candidate for best beer that I've had to date. It looks beautiful, smells awesome, tastes perfect, and mouthfeel adds a lot to the overall enjoyment. While I'm incredibly happy that this is being bottled now, I'm kicking myself for never making it to Fat Heads to try this on tap before. A must-drink if you can get your hands on it."
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Easy-going down the throat. A nice bitterness due to a complex combination of hops. Fresh. Gets a bit more bitter towards the end. Very unique and worthy of a try."
""
"Hops are screaming in this sample, beautiful cohesive force of big hops and malts I can't believe this is available this fresh in my area bought at Valley Wine Cellar in Steubenville, Ohio. It made it down here from the production brewery in 3 days I bought it on 5/17/13...that's effective distribution. Good job to the Premium beverage folks I can't believe it. Pairing an Erik Espinosa Habano from the La Zona Factory in Esteli, Nicaragua beautiful Habano wrapper spicy Nica tobacco, fills the nares with black pepper, the palate with leather and spice beautiful cigar to pair with a badass West coast style IPA. If you never had the pleasure of drinking this on tap please find it fresh in bottles amazing experience, every hophead around this area should have I'm about to pick up the rest of the bottles."
""
""
""
"O. I really like this beer. It gets better and better at is warms, and at 7.5% ABV (as advertised in this here bar), it's a good way to start the day. I'll have this again when I see it."
"Poured on-tap and served in a small tasting glass. the beer is a slightly hazed, orange coloring and inch high head with great retention, too. Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing. orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. A very Hop forward punch with a grapefruit that keeps you coming back for more. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing. The finish is clean, smooth, and very satisfying. Another great Midwest IPA."

"Simply awesome; it is easy to see why this IPA has won so many awards. I wonder how well it has done once bottled; on tap (or from a fresh growler), however, this IPA is world-class."
""
"Overall: Did you expect anything less than essential perfection? This IPA is a medal winner at GABF with great reason. The color is spot on, the nose is entrancing, the taste is to die for and you can keep sipping on it for quite some time. Doesn't get better than that! If only it were truly sessionable, but at 7.5% you're going to have to show some restraint and keep to a few of these. This is THE benchmark beer for me! 5/5"

"Overall: A really nice grapefruity IPA; though it has a hint of residual sweetness, it never comes close to becoming cloying"
"Overall: without a doubt the best single IPA I've ever had. Incredible taste. I will be disappointed when the growler is empty."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I thought it was a great beer overall. It was a very flavorful and easy drinking beer of the style with some excellent bright, fruity, fresh hoppy flavors to it."
""
""
"I now understand why it won all the medals the bottle brags about. While I prefer a bit more of a citrus lean to the flavor this was one of the best smelling beers I've ever had and the taste only disappoints compared to it. Not sure of distribution on this, but if it's available in Western Ohio I'm all over it every time I'm there."
""
"*I dislike Simcoe very much, try to avoid Chinook, and have a tenuos relationship with Columbus and Cascade. If you love any one of those hops... seek this beer out!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall the best example of a west coast IPA! Right up there with the big guys, firestone walker, pizza port, coronado, and stone!!"
"O: Standing O. Worth every bit of the hype and praise that is has received all these years. Between this and White Rajah, Cleveland may have the best two 1-2 IPA combo in the country...that includes you, San Fran (Blind Pig and Pliny are awesome, but don't have anything on this duo). Very different from White Rajah, a little bit more body on this one and subtle complexity. More pine resin and herbal notes on this as well. A hop head's delight from start to finish. Worth the wait."
""
"O: An IPA to be recokoned with. The west coast better watch out as Head Hunter can stand up with the best of them. Every true hop head should give this a try. Easily competes with PtE as my favorite hoppy beer and at 7.5% you could call this a DIPA."

"Poured into a DFH glass a very nice dark golden hazy orange color, very nice carbonation, very nice three-finger thick/creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is nice and hoppy, with some malt notes, very nice citrus and pine notes. The taste is especially nice, hoppy, sweet, with a nice malt blend thrown in, lots of citrus/pine notes. Medium Body, with a slight dry/bitter finish. This is an AWESOME IPA, definitely one of the best I've had to date, Highly Recommended! Thanks Ben! Much appreciated!"

"Overall a really really nice IPA. I see why people like this one. I know I've typed it repeatedly but there is a real nice dank, green hop aroma and flavor that really makes this one stick out. I wouldn't mind drinking this one at all, in fact I'll leave it on my wants in hopes of getting this again. It doesn't hurt tha this beer is insanely drinkable, a growler of this could get put down no problem."
"Overall: Excellent. Can hang with any west coast IPA. Glad I could finally score some bottles!"
"Additional Note: This batch took the bronze at the 2011 GABF."
"O- Is this the best IPA I have ever had? I think it may be. This is an amazing IPA, so aromatic and flavorful. This beer brings the sweetness, bitterness, and funk; what a perfect combo. This is as West Coast as it gets and it is from Cleveland. I have got to make it up to Fat Heads more."
"Overall a solid IPA and I will defiantly be stopping into Fat Head's more often when I am on the West side of Cleveland."
"O: Worth the long lines. After 4 glasses I went home a happy camper."
"In summation: frickin' awesome. My new favorite IPA."
"And when the hell will Pittsburgh get the 4 bottles for 9.95? Man it's been like a 2 month wait!"
"Honestly, I don't understand all the hype behind this beer. The flavor is great and the aroma is pleasing, but this beer fails pretty hard in all other categories."
"Overall I highly recommend this beer for any hop lover"
"I can't rave about this, or in fact call it bad. Very average ipa but it's weed flavored. You take it from there."
"O- I thought this beer overall was good. Actually, I thought it was great. The ABV is in the mid-range where it won't kill you to drink a couple in a row but it might impair you to not drink anything else. A hop crusher on the palate. Can see why this one won the IPA challange. Good job Fat Heads!"
"O: A good IPA w/ a funky aftertaste/finish. Would definitely enjoy again but with the explosion of IPAs would pick others first."
"This definitely is a top-notch IPA. It's something I'm glad I can get in the area. All hopheads should appreciate this one! DANK! I hope everyone gets to try this one day."
"Overall this beer is simply and only one dimensional: Delicious!"
"Although I'm more of a dark beer kind of girl, I enjoy a good IPA when I find one, and boy this is definitely one of them. There are so many aromas and flavors in this brew. The smell is very much citrus. Definite grapefruit notes. The actual taste however is a much more distinct hoppy pine flavor. Slightly peppery. Overall a must try if you ever get the chance."
"Headhunter pours a light light amber almost apple juice colored and has a standard good amount of head with a decent amount of lacing. It has a fresh clean look which is ok. The first whiffs from my Chimay bell are pine and subtle citrus. I found the smell complex and very appealing begging me to drink some. Hop bitter stings the end of my tongue delightfully. This beer is all hops. I taste pine, and grapefruit bitter citrus, intermingling with resin and earthy hop flavors. My god this is a great tasting straight up IPA!!! The mouthfeel is also awesome not to thick and very approachable. Overall I am happy with this beer and would advocate anybody living in Western Pa or Ohio if only to find Head Hunter."
"Without a doubt this is an upper-tier American IPA from the Midwest; nay, an upper-tier American IPA, period. This is a really enjoyable beer and very well-done. I could drink this regularly and be perfectly ok with it."
"O (D) - Very drinkable, very tasty. Would be a good daily beer."
"This is by far my favorite IPA and if you get the chance I highly encourage you to try it. Im even prouder that its brewed right here in NE Ohio."
"Wow, super drinkable, a very nice AIPA for sure, medium bodied, chewy hops, lots of esters in the midpalate, great hop flavor, great hop bitterness to finish, not too dry on the back palate, overall a wonderful beer."
"Drink ability is pretty good. Booze os noticeable, and its pretty intense so one out two does the trick."
"This is a kick ass IPA for sure. The Pliny of Ohio? It certainly follows that style of IPA, more that Columbus IPA or Two Hearted. I think I do prefer this over Elder too. It's by leaps and bounds better than what Cleveland beer drinkers used to have as their standard, go to, local IPA."
"D: I like this one its only a half hour from where I grew up so I like the fact that I feel as if it can stand up to some of the best Ipa's i have had"
"Very tasty stuff. Really easy to drink, Fresh hop presence throughout, with various flavors melding together nicely. The beer finishes with a tangy bitterness and lingers on the palate. Alcohol presence is muted, but this beer will sneak up on you if you're not careful. I would happily drink this again."
"d - A pretty nice IPA. Lots of oranges in the smell and taste. Would have again."
"D- Wasn't expecting that much flavor coming out of this IPA. Great balance of flavors all the way through. One of the better regular IPA's I've had. Thanks for this treat!"
"Easy to down a few and an nice representation of the West Coast style IPA."
"Reviewed: March 3, 2011"
"Nice IPA, certainly glad to have had the opportunity to enjoy. While the aroma certainly put me off slightly the only other complaints I have are simply personal preference. Rather easy drinking, would no be opposed to having this available to me as an everyday option. Good IPA that falls just short of the next level."
"Yellow, golden pour with a bright white head that clings to the glass. Minor grapefruit smell with malt in the background. I'm also getting an old sock type smell. Hmmm. Unusual bitter taste which doesn't improve much at all. Metallic tasting. Not too pleasant. Very thin mouthfeel. This wasn't the greatest beer but it was unusual for an IPA. If you're looking for a different experience in an IPA...this is your huckleberry."
"D - My buddy gave me a 12 pack when I visited him. Let's just say that it didn't last long. This and Columbus IPA are the two best Ohio IPA's that I have had."
"Pours a nice gold to light copper color with a nice white head and a good amount of lacing. Nice retention as well. The nose brought forward a large amount of hops ranging from citrus to floral to tropical. Altogether a really nice package from a mixed back of hops. I can't recall them at the moment, but there was a sign on the wall that seemed to indicate the hops used in this one. The flavor hit the spot as well with a nice hop character coming through as the dominant character and a good, brisk finish. A bit of alcohol in the finish, though not too much. Terribly drinkable. I wish this were available locally and weren't quite as high in ABV."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A very good IPA for sure. Reminds me a bit of Two Hearted with the big citrus flavor and aroma. If Fathead's bottled this bad boy, I'd pick some up for sure."
"D: I really want to give this beer a better score, but the flavor just let me down after what was a very nice nose."
"interesting copper-pink color, sulfur smell in the nose, clear color, little to no lace, short finish, metallic taste, stinky, short medium-length finish, little less than average overall finish. wouldn't seek out this beer, there are much better examples to choose from."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. The lively feel really helps here. Alcohol wore on me a bit as I got through this one."
"Thanks again Eric. I owe you."
"D: Goes down easy, and leaves you wanting for more."
"D-nicely drinkable. Very smooth and nixe"
"Pours a crisp yellowish orange. Sme nice solid head tht dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Smells great. Lots of piney hops on the nose. Taste is a bit overly bitter. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking due to the bitterness but the drinkability is decent for how hoppy it is. Overall, worth trying but i wouldn't drink it regularly"
"D: Despite the 7.5%, this is very, very drinkable. Well balanced, flavorful, delicious. This is up there on my all time favorite IPA's, and I really hope I have a chance to try this again. If you have the opportunity to pick up a bottle or two, definitely do ... this can certainly compete with the more hyped DIPAs. Very highly recommended!"
"Drinkability -- I had heard good things about Head Hunter, but this really exceeded my hopes. Bright juicy notes and caramel malting paired with resounding pine bitterness. I'd put this up against any of the top-rated IPA's. Good show, Fat Heads!"
"I am psyched to have tried this beer - didn't realize they had this in bottles. GREAT first beer to start round 4."
"D: One or two glasses with spicy food or sharp cheese would be really nice."
"D - Just a great beer and a near perfect example of the American IPA. Really hope this one gets out to more people so they get to experience it."
"Pours a beautiful golden orange into my Bell's tulip. A lot of nice lacing and head on this beauty. A true pine smell to his West Coast style IPA. I also get a light citrus smell after the pine has dissipated. A crisp and mildly bitter hop bomb with a great finish. Not too malty and and not too sweet. A highly drinkable IPA and now I know why it has been receiving the numerous awards and recognitions."
"dinkability is out fuc%in standing, not real heavy and the aftertaste leaves you NEEDING another brew,Totally AWESOME!"
"This beer is worth every accolade it has ever received and more. Easily one of the best, if not the best, IPA I have ever had. This beer was so dank and delicious that drinking this beer was actually an experience in itself. If you have a bottle...drink it NOW!!!"
"D - great beer all around. the latest batches (these bottles, growler, and some recent tap pours) seem a bit more Simcoe heavy than what I was used to. again, straight from the West Coast via Ohio. wonderful to see this in bottles and at a decent price (~$2.50 apiece)."
"D: This beer is delightfully hoppy. By far and away the best IPA I've come across East of Michigan. This is a great beer. Highly drinkable."
"Pours on the lighter side of the spectrum for IPAs, bright and golden orange, healthy sticky head and lacing galore. Sharp piney aromas and loads of tropical fruit, citrus, uber fresh. I was expecting decent or even tasty at best, but I was really blown away by this beer. Super bitter, nearly astringent (in a good way), light malt profile allowing the citrus hops to shine. Really amazing pineapple-y minty sappy resinous danky hops. So bitter. My special lady friend was drinking other top tier IPAs such as Sculpin and Green Flash, and swapping sips I think this was a notch ahead, which is saying a lot. Nice smooth mouthfeel, not overly heavy, thick, syrupy, or sweet like some IPAs pushing the imperial tend to be. Crisp, fresh, quenching and highly quaffable. Definitely in the top tier of IPAs in my book. Wish it was more widely available but now I have another excuse to go visit the folks in Pittsburgh."
"At the Pittsburgh location (even though I live in Cleveland). This is a really great IPA, on par with Two Hearted and a few others in that class. Super fresh and refreshing. Really clean hoppy flavors with some nice underlying malt. The real all-stars in this beer are the citrus and piney hops. Great aroma, great flavor. Very easy-drinking, a bit lighter in body, but that ups the drinkability for sure. I wouldn't say a ""must-have"" in terms of ""you must drive 500 miles to get this beer," but if you head to Fat Head's, you better order one."
"One of the best west-coast style IPAs brewed in the east. A necessity for any hophead to try."
"A real piney, citric hop nose that even hits grape-like aroma on top of a golden body w/ large head that dies quick and leaves lace ring. Very dry - first thing that hits me - as the citric hops are prevelant throughout entire drink yet it flows smooth, not haggard, and has a nice touch of sweetness to it as well. A well-balanced, solid IPA that a hop lover will love and so will fans of less hoppy, more malty beers as well...must say did not realize 7% until I saw this website b/c they hid it well."
"Addictive and delicious...this beer deserves some hype!"
"D - Goes down pretty fast, with the only thing getting in the way being the bruising bitterness. It's a shame no one is free to help me with this one. Where's d0b when you need him?"
"Drinkability: Definitely will have again when I'm visiting back to my old home of Cleveland....why did this place have to open AFTER I moved. Great flagship beer for these guys."
"Considering this is brewed in the Midwest, this is as close to a bold, West Coast style I've had...hands down. Absolutely worth checking out."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer. Had it side by side with Ballast Point's Sculpin and held its own."
"Draft at The Bistro IPA festival. Golden amber, bright and clear, with a solid white cap that slowly settles to a collar. Very floral aroma, centennial hops are prominent but there's also a citrusy, herbal character, a little weed and cut grass. Little perceptible malt in the aroma, but it has a touch of bready sweetness on the palate beneath the huge hop flavors. Floral with orange and grapefruit, bitter herbs, a little toasted biscuit. Nice bitter grapefruit finish that lingers for a long time. Pretty damn good."
"Pours a clean, pale orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, big citrus, grapefruity hops. In the taste, big hops, citrus and grapefruity, yet very well balanced with a nice malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a grapefruity hop aftertaste. Fantastic, big hops, but not too big."
"D: A very tasty IPA growler indeed that i am happy to have tried, not as citrusy as i expected but still quite good."
"Pours a nice golden color with a slight head. The aroma is of floral and earthy hops with hints of citrus fruits. The taste is of a slight caramel malt backbone with touches of citrus fruits. The main taste is of earthy hops and touches of floral hops. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall its a nice beer, good flavor and nice aroma, not the best IPA you will ever have, but it is very solid."
"D-this is a huge hop lovers IPA, which I am. very tasty, nice balance of flavors that work really well together. by far fathead's best offering!"
"It seems like every time I stop at fat head's the Headhunter has just kicked. Not this time, and I'm really happy about that. Anytime I see this is still on tap, I will definitely be ordering it."
"As a side note, bartender informed me that they had recently acquired a bottling machine, done some test runs, and have a label made up. Excited to see this one on the shelves!"
"There is a reason why this beer has already won awards! If you love IPAs you have to try this beer it is the best IPA I have ever had!!!"
"Overall, this is a great non-West Coast IPA that offers intense flavors (though a little excessive on the maltiness) and a nice complexity to it that is probably well worth the Gold award it recently won."
"D- I like this one quite a bit. A great hop bit but nothing thats undrinkable by any means."
"Headhunter is a truly fantastic IPA. It is similar to Green Flash (one of my favorites), but slightly less bitter and with a lighter body. Apparently this beer won first prize at a San Diego IPA competition - no mean feat for a beer from Cleveland. Bravo, Fat Head's."
"D - A very impressive IPA...outsanding aroma and flavor. At 7%, not too strong. Flavors are intense, but oh so good. A great beer and a pretty cool bar to get it at too."
"Should I ever find myself in the area this will be my first stop. I am not surprised this went on to win NIPAC this year."
"More of that in the taste, Plinyesque, so much dry hopping flavor, without a super heavy handed amount of bitterness. Totally resonates throughout the entire sample (tried at Bistro IPA festival, where it won gold). Extremely drinkable, would be difficult to stop drinking this if there weren't 61 other kegs of IPA that day."
"Drinkability - Excellent beer. Great West Coast IPA brewed in the east. Want more!"
"Not too bad, not so good. But, for a local IPA, I'll take it. I'd love to see an imperial version (Double headhunter anyone?)!"
"On-tap at Pizza Plant.Cloudy grapefruit with a foaming white head. Lots of lace. Grapefruit aroma. Initially there is a strong hop bite, nay burn, then the mouth gets more used to the acidity. The flavour is pretty good grapefuit. 77IBU and you feel that. Hours later, acidic is still in my mouth."
"D: The ABV is not over the top, so enjoying more than one of these IPA's is easy to do."
"I love IPAs but this one wasnt for me. The overpowering pine flavor killed this beer. Smell, Taste and after taste. Drank it all to get my money worth and then moved on. Their Weizenbock is wonderful though."
"This is an outstanding IPA when you factor in the low ABV (6.2%), just very good. I hope to see this bottled and distributed."
"Seems all west coast on the surface but underneath it's pedestrian at best. Get one of the other 41 beers on tap is my advice. And, as an unabashed Fat Heads fanboy, it hurts to say this. Honestly. Bottom line: get something else."
"D - Solid IPA with plenty of hop character. This one features a nice hop profile ncluding Simcoe, Cascade and Columbus varieties. Nice, although I liked the Pack-a-Wallop S.P.A. better."
"D Only fair. I cannot have more than one of these."
"Tis a shame, as I really liked this everywhere but the taste. I know that the board described this as ""aggressive"" and uncivilized"" but it was just way too uneven towards the hops for my taste. If you don't mind out-of-control bitterness, then by all means go for it, as the aroma is quite nice and the body and drinkibility are right on for a higher ABV IPA."
"Good?!?!?! This was great and I highly recomend it."
"HV"
