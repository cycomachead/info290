The fact it is unfiltered showed a lot of hop residue inside the floating around the glass.  It is stingy and has a big bite.  The bitter factor played a role for me.  The alcohol is definitely detectable.  It is a strong beer and has a strong taste.  Good beer for an IPA lover.","JPowell712","Mar 10, 2015"

It is a clean taste, but if there is any criticism it would be that the hops tend to be a bit metallic and cling to the front of your mouth and do not have a full bodied finish.  It does carry a lot of citrus and reminds me a bit of Sun King Osiris, but not quite as good.   This beer is hop forward, has a great nose,  good color and pour, but does not have the dynamite finish a beer that the ""bros"" rate as a 100 should have.     I wonder how they could rate this as perfect, because...while good....is not near perfect.    Better than Anderson Valley and Hop Devil, but behind Two Hearted, Sun King,Dogfish and  Lagunitas.","Smr7626","Nov 06, 2014"

Slight carbonation that lasts for the duration.  Flavor matures as it sits in the glass.  Wonderful aroma that isn't overdone as some IPAs can be.  Not too floral.  I've had some IPAs that are killer as far as taste goes but are nearly ruined by the floral aroma.  Almost smells sugary without tasting as such.  A little malty with a hint of caramel.  Flavor stays on the back of the tongue but doesn't ruin the palate.  Few IPAs are better and/or more balanced than this one.  Very reminiscent of its sister beer, Double Crooked Tree, but not such a kick in the ass.  Definitely one to have two or three of without feeling guilty.  Can't find anything negative to say about this guy.  Highly recommend.","BeerSnobRobinson","Sep 27, 2014"

Aromas of citrus and tropical fruit forward, with pineapple, grapefruit, and melon, with a sugary sweet caramel backbone, and subtle resinous undertones.  The flavors are like a tropical fruit salad forward, with pineapple, apricot, mango, and melon, followed by a tart grapefruit character, and a solid undertone of cedar and pine pitch, pepper spice, a tangy caramel note, some hops resin, and roasted notes.  Smooth and mid-bodied, with the carbonation lightening things up a bit.  The aftertaste is a bit more of the bitter and resinous hops character shining through, with some of the fruit sweetness handing around still.  Slick, dry, bitter lingering finish.  Solid IPA.","GarthDanielson","Sep 02, 2014"

Not overly bitter. Quite smooth for an IPA. As I drink more a malty taste comes out, and fruitiness disappears.

Off white creamy head that fell slowly and left lace. Nose is faint and first thing I did was look for a date on the bottle. There wasn't one so they sold it me and I am going to review it. I got a flash of some citrus. Pink grapefruit and some lemon peel. I am smelling the very small and luscious beginings of caramel and just a bit of dry biscuit. Seems to me that the hops have faded off because i have to really dive in for the nose. Taste is malt forward. Biscuit and lovely biscuit with a bit of dryness a bit of sweetness. Not really any fruit on the palate but just some remnants of the hop character. Just enough to tease a bit and make you wish it was fresh. I thought I tasted some orange, very light orange. A small bitter and malt. Dry sweet biscuit with a hint at caramel. the malt was lovely. No pine, not really any grapefruit on the palate just a juiciness. Mouthfeel was light enough and soft. I want it again when it is fresh and reserve the right to revisit.","utopiajane","Jul 15, 2014"

Pours a beautiful hazy Orange with a very small head of off white foam which dissipates to a very nice, lasting lacing. The aroma is all grapefruit and pine, almost reminiscent of fresh mangoes. It Sips smooth but with a body that coats the mouth very nicely. The flavor is what really takes this one to the next level. Super hoppy and bitter but well balanced. Lots of citrus and pine and very fresh tasting. This is definitely a go to ipa. Extra points for my favorite designed tap handle in the business.","lochef81","Jan 07, 2014"

Grapefruit is there too, but mostly hidden. The taste is rather surpising, the bitterness is there but so is a impressive malt backbone that fights back just as hard as the hops. The bitterness does win out in the end with a bitterness kick that just keeps hanging around. I've always seen this beer at the store, but for some reason I always pass it by. Not this time, thankfully. This is one of the better IPAs I've had in a long time.","screamking","Nov 16, 2013"

Though not quite as smooth and balanced as a Bells Two Hearted Ale, this beer can hold its' own with any other IPA I've ever sampled.

This had just the right amount of body to feel like a Rye beer and a slightly dry-hopped nature that led me to sip more in an attempt to quench my thirst. This was wonderful and if you love beers that delight and surprise while delivering a healthy does of hops, you owe it to yourself to give this a go.

There’s more heft to this than the West Coast IPAs I’ve grown accustomed to—but it’s consistent enough with the other Michigan IPAs that come to mind (Two Hearted anyone?) that I think it’s far to say there might be a regional influence to the style at this point.","elNopalero","Sep 09, 2013"

If ever a beer needed to come in cans ... it's this beer. Pours a little darker than your normal high end IPA, but don't let that fool you. You may even smell a little bit of the malt in your noes, but don't let that fool you either. This is the most well balanced beer you will find on the market, and I'm a total hop head. I judge a beer on it's hops, and I can drink this beer all day long and then some. There are some beers that are of supreme quality that can vary from six to six and this is one of those beers. Sometimes it's slightly darker than other times, but it doesn't matter. It always has that citrus and fruit hop dance on the tongue. What really makes this beer shine is the buzz, and I'm not lying. It has that over the top ""I'm king of the world and everything is good!"" feel to it. It's a total smiley face beach and summer time social beer that won't bring you down. I have had all the variations from double, to falconers, to cascade, but the best is the strait crooked tree ipa. If this came in cans it would be touching the 5 star mark!","Nanners","Aug 18, 2013"

The nose comprises lightly-tart grapefruit zest, toffee, pine resin, light earthy greens, and a mild pinch of mint. The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine is now the star of the show (though nowhere near the only one) and the grapefruit now favors the peel. he body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice, decently-balanced IPA, one of the better regularly-offered IPAs out there if you ask me.","TMoney2591","May 15, 2013"

First pull revealed a nice creamy head, not to thick but a nice lacing on the glass. ( I use the Sam Adams tech glasses for first time hoppy beers) First whiff of the beer was very subtle but could catch hoppy and biscuity notes. Appearance is orange in color and a little cloudy at first but cleared up a few pulls. Taste leaves a nice hoppy presence and rounds out with just enough malt but still keeping it dry. No crystal malt here. Good dry finish with the hops shining through especially for an average ABV. IPA. Mouth feel is a little thin but that is okay because it is not a imperial or double IPA. Overall a great beer and will be looking forward to buying this beer again!","JAlvy","Apr 14, 2013"

However, whatever it may lack can be accounted for simply by the fact that it is billed as a standard IPA, not anything bigger. I'll respect that, and rate it accordingly. I think it's just a great representation of the single IPA style. With this being as good as it is, it makes me really want to get my hands on Double Crooked Tree. It's definitely worth grabbing a 6 pack of it.","--Dom--","Jan 15, 2013"

The first thing I notice is the feel, the feel is full bodied and has a crispness that almost reminds me of a rye beer. Speaking of rye, I get an ever so slight earthy spiciness out of the beer. However the highlight for me is the fresh hop characters. The beer has a moderate amount of citrus, ranging from lemon to pineapple. I think the most notable aspect is the pine flavor, and I mean evergreen tree type pine. This is a great IPA, Dont miss out on the Double Crooked Tree as that is one of my favorite IPA's.","TwelveOunces","Oct 06, 2012"

Taste is very similar with a surprisingly balanced malt profile to back up the floral hops. A touch of nuttiness thats really a nice addition, taste is very fresh. Mouthfeel is very balanced, carbonation is slightly less fine than I'm used to but its a nice change and not a huge difference in carbonation. I really like the balance on this brew, its not too biting and it has full flavor to back it up. Great IPA!","srv33","Jul 17, 2012"

Also, it is very yeasty for an IPA, but it works here as a different way to provide some balance to the hops. The yeast, malt, and hops blend well for a bold flavor that is just a little different from most IPA's, and that helps make this beer interesting. And, you just gotta love the rough and tough look of this beer - it is cloudy with stuff floating around and that just makes it look like a manly beer.","Beer_Runner","Jun 29, 2012"

Taste is balanced between sweet, bready and bitter; the over-bitter notes fade a bit, but linger, as an IPA should. Mouth-feel is substantial with moderate carbonation: a foamy, creamy, wet finish.

This beer definitely had a little bit more of a peach/grapefruit taste then most IPAs which made it a little bit different. It wasn't the sweetest IPA I've had, Heady Topper takes that by far, but it was good.

Lace is scattered around a little bit. Aroma is full of citrus and tropical fruits, earthy woody scents, and bread dough malts. Rather well balanced. Individual flavors are kinda hidden in the bitterness but I do perceive citrus rind, various tea-like things, maybe leaves, and some light maltiness. Mouthfeel starts smooth and then grittiness sets in alongside prickly carbonation. Overall a pretty decent brew. Worth picking up now and again.","tastybeer","Apr 14, 2012"

3.97,-0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the golden copper colored ale produced a modest head. Even so it gave a sweet malty aroma, which was only a shallow reflection of the flavor to come. A sweet malty hoppy flavor showed hints of pineapple and peach. The malt seemed to clear a path for the citrus in the hops. A slightly thickened texture allowed the flavor to stick to the roof of the mouth and sides of the tongue nicely. The vitality of the citrus allowed the flavor to stay nicely in the aftertaste with the malty backbone disappearing. This is a very complex and drinkable IPA.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 03, 2012"

Slams you with bitterness up front, pine, lemons, pine, and finishes with more. Highlights hops very well, very little balance from the malts. However, when I had this fresh on tap it tasted much more balanced, with beautiful sweet light malts to accent the big bitter--plenty of citrus in that case that really lightened up the bruising palate. Must like bitterness for this one. On point for wrecking the palate.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

This beer is pretty well-balanced without allowing the malt to overpower the hops at all. It's a good example of the style but in my opinion it's not something I would particularly seek out if it's not local.","tyamhydrogen","Dec 31, 2011"
3.85,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Cloudy copper color, nicely laced, pours well out of the bottle. Smell is like grapefruit and a little earthy-- like fallen pine needles on a cold fall day. Dominant taste is bitterness of the hops, well balanced by the malt. Has a nice acidity and brightness to it, like a good medium roast coffee (though I dont mean to say it tastes like coffee). Great mouthfeel; smooth, drinkable, well-carbonated. I think I'll have another.","pariii","Dec 31, 2011"

3.33,-16.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Mmmm Hops, I can smell em as soon as I pop the cap off the bottle. Slightly cloudy deep amber color with a smallish white head that displays marginal retention. Smells citrusy with grapefruit, lemon and pineapple aromas trying to cover up a bready caramel malt sweetness. Taste is a bit harsh with hop resin, but also has citrus and bready malt backing it up a bit. Again I question just how long this bottle has been sitting on the store shelf because this doesn't seem to be a fresh example of an IPA. Medium to light body and carbonation level with a slick resinous mouthfeel. Decent as is, but I think this is a better beer than what I am tasting tonight.","johnnnniee","Nov 12, 2011"

4.85,21.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Easily my favorite michigan IPA. It tastes extremely hoppy despite only being 39 IBUS. Heavy on the grapefruit and slight floral notes.

3.65,-8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - From the look of this beer and some of the previous reviews I thought this was going to be sweeter, it absolutely is not. The look and feel of this IPA reminds me strongly of Short's Huma Lupa Licious. It is a very tasty, puckering and bitter IPA, but a bit unbalanced without a stronger malt backbone. If you prefer little to no malt/carmel sweetness, then you will love this beer. I prefer a little more balance and sweetness personally, but still a fine IPA. *My mouth is numb after the session, definitely one of the most bitter and drying/puckering IPA's I've ever had.","blackcompg","Oct 23, 2011"
2.81,-29.4,4,3,2.5,2.5,3,"A customer recently dropped this off - kind of like a bolt from the blue. Did not know the guy from Adam, but he started chatting up one of my bartenders and was impressed with our beer offerings. I had high hopes for this beer when I saw other member reviews, but overall really did not like the somewhat soapy hop character. Stays in your mouth for a long time like a woman with too much perfume on her skin after nibbling on her neck. I did like the fact that the beer was quite dark for an IPA and that it was unfiltered.

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer drinks bigger than the abv would suggest. Very bright citrus hopping is the focus of attention here, and the malt, while adequate, is simply a delivery vehicle. Pungent up front, but not overpowering, the beer actually gives an initial impression of being a hop-monster, but then pulls in the reigns and settles into well-but-not-over-hopped mode.

3.13,-21.4,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"overall, this is a very drinkable IPA but a little on the lighter taste side. I wish the bottle was dated, as that would perhaps explain the muted hops (if it was a bit older that is). that being said, still a very tasty sessionable Ipa","crewfan16","Aug 31, 2011"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark orange/copper color that was quite unexpected for an IPA. It borders on the appearance of a light amber. About a half inch of foamy beige head appears, lingers for some time, and slowly fades to patches. Sticky lacing is left behind. Smells of caramel malt, grapefruit, some orange, and floral hops. Tastes very similar, with the hops in the front, followed by the lemon, citrus, and pine, and a smooth caramel finish. Mouthfeel is very good; smooth with great carbonation. Overall, a great beer that I'd love to sit down with again sometime.","eclipse54","Aug 28, 2011"

2.36,-40.7,2,3.5,2,2,2,"Many thanks to GordianKnot for the chance to try this beer. Poured from 12oz bottle into my DFH snifter. Ugliest IPA pour I have ever seen- pours a murky dark dishwater dirty brown color. A little bit of head, barely any retention. I can only assume that this is a really old bottle, or something has gone terribly wrong with this one. After it gets into the glass, it looks like dirty brown dishwater, pretty disgusting. Smell- applejuice, some spices from the hops. Faint breadiness from the malt. Taste- gross. this is like applesauce gone wrong. You get some sweet flavors from the malt, and some bitterness from the hops, but this does not even resemble an IPA. This is a drainpour. I can only assume this is some sort of quality control issue after reading the reviews.","lnashsig","Aug 21, 2011"

3.5,-12.1,3,3,4,3,3.5,"O- I actually found this beer very hard to transcribe into words. Incredibly different.

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Crooked Tree IPA is a brown, caramel colored brew, with a small head that leaves a fair amount of lace in its wake. The nose has a lot of malts, with grapefruit and other citrus hop notes, a bit piney as well. The taste starts out with a rich caramel malt front, which is well-blended with the focus of this beer, which is the hop profile. The malt is very biscuity, and there is a bit of spiciness from the alcohol. The hops run the citrus end of the spectrum, with grapefruit tones getting the most attention, but also some lemony, piney, bitter and quite citrusy. The mouth is a bit thin and pretty wet.","Tballz420","Aug 17, 2011"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O - Great beer once you get past the sediment. For whatever reason, I had a bottle or two of this hanging around well after what i found was the freshness curve. Once tamed down, it has similar characteristics to Levitation.","gopens44","Aug 15, 2011"
4.11,3.3,3,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured a fairly cloudy, dark amber with a couple fingers of head but with little retention. Leaves some nice bubbly lacing around the glass that lasts. Good hop smell with citrus and some pine notes as well. Corresponding with the smell there is a solid hop presence in the taste, but not too bitter for those who might be opposed to such. Fairly well balanced with the malt. Drinks smooth throughout, but finishes a bit dry leaving me wanting more. Overall, a well crafted IPA that I can see myself drinking often.","mjvos","Aug 14, 2011"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Murky dark orange pour with a quickly receding head. Citrus, pine and fruity aroma. Nice hoppy taste.

The decent A.B.V. content is only slightly noticeable in the flavor profile. Complimented by a very balanced bitterness. Bitterness isn't scorching or lingering.

3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one is hard to get a good head to it while trying to not mix all the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. I got a one finger high off-white creamy head and tons of sediment in the glass. This looks like a shaken up lava lamp due to a good bit of carbonation that keeps everything moving. Color is copper amber and the lace drapes the glass with a good bit of coverage. The nose is mostly filled with hops of fruity, citrus nature, but also a light spicy note like hops sprinkled with nutmeg. Some underlying biscuity sweet malts. The grapefruit is definitely there also. As for the taste, the hops and malts wrestle around some, but the hops really dominate. Those biscuity semi-sweet malts don't give up though and come on more as the beer warms. Hops are earthy and zesty with a solid grapefruit and lime rind quality. It has a total creamy mouthfeel and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is so creamy and tightly carbonated that it really makes it hard to nail down those tastes, since the flavors really bounce around, but it keeps you wanting more. Might give a bloating feeling if sessioned, but the 6% would be good, so tough to score. Last thoughts are that it went down really well and I could easily start another so, I'm putting on the higer side.","Schwarzbart","Apr 14, 2011"

The aroma is extremely fruity with a lot of grapefruit but a lot of sappy pine cuts through. Some citrus notes but what IPA doesn't have that. There is a solid malt body as well which is dominated by a lot of caramel most likely just Am. two-row. The flavor is a lot of the pine sap upfront with a strong bitterness that carries through a malty caramel and sour/sweet grapefruit middle but with a huge amount of bitter dryness at the finish. As I breathe through my nose I get some lemon scents but it is quickly subdued by the overwhelming dry bitterness. The body is creamy at first but the body doesn't back up the heavy hops which makes them overwhelming.","DrinkingDrake","Apr 04, 2011"

The hops flavor isn't as strong as the smell leads you to believe, but there's enough there to know you're drinking an American IPA, maintain the beer's balance and not over-power you with bitterness. The malt character is hearty. The after-taste is slightly hoppy with a little bit of sweetness. Very smooth with a little crispness, medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.

3.87,-2.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Yup, lots of toffee and caramel sweetness with a bit of toast up front and then a coating, lingering hop bittering comes on strong. Some hop flavors, but not as much as I would like. Most notable to me is the dichotomy of the earthy malt base and the vibrant hop character, they play interestingly well off each other...kinda like saltwater taffy wrapped around a fresh hop cone. The more I drink it the more I like it...a little swirling knocks some of the carbonation out and gives it a smoother, hoppier mouthfeel. Good IPA here, would like to give it a go on tap next time I find myself up north.","twiggamortis420","Sep 25, 2010"

Just the slightest haziness to this amber/orange brew with a finger of off-white head...colors probably appeared darker than actual due to low lighting. Super aroma consisting of grapefruit and pine. Very hop forward scent, which I'm a big fan of. As far as taste, the hops come across mostly as grapefruit rather than the pine that your nose told you to expect. This is seriously easy drinking and the bittery sweet finish paired perfectly with my smoked wings. Without question, I will have this again.","alkemy","Sep 24, 2010"
3.11,-21.9,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Poured to a two fingered thick bubbly head. Head was tan in color. Ale itsself was very hazy with lots of floaties, and light brown in color. Head hung around quite a while and had some good lacing. Smelled of caramel, also had a slight citrus pine smell. I thought the smell was kind of light. To me it tasted more of a Brown Ale. Had a bitter aftertaste. Also notes of pine, caramel, yeast and a slight citrus taste. I thought it also had a sweet flavor in there also. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good. Id buy again. I just think it was nothing out of the ordinary. I expected more of a hoppy citrus taste and it wasnt there.","youngleo","Sep 18, 2010"

The aroma is bitter through and through with hints of grass,citrus and an undertone of sweet malts. I'm really into the way this smells, especially since I don't know how old it is. The taste is bitter from start to finish with just a hint of juiciness. Not bad, but not very complex at all. The mouthfeel is thin and watery. I thought this looked heavier than it is. I'm typing this as I'm drinking it and I'm not sure that I'm going to finish.

Nice earthy, spicy, citrusy nose with hints of pine and a sweet malt. Fresh, bold taste with great balance between the slightly spicy, citrusy, bitter hop bite and sweet malt backbone. Lots of grapefruit, pine with a touch of bitter resin and perfect sweetness on the finish. Very smooth and slightly chewy make this extremely drinkable. Was wishing I had another by the time I finished. Wasn't familiar with Dark Horse prior to this, but will definitely seek out more from them. A great IPA.","beerdrifter","Jul 28, 2010"

3.85,-3.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is really hoppy. There is largely an IPA with ample orange blossom estery hop flavors, a touch of pine but of the really bittering sort, some other assorted bitter florals from the juices of the hop. The beer has a fairly malt mid section but it probably needs to be a touch heavier and weightier to balance the really bittering flavors. There is a very drying, mouth puckering, and moisture evaporating quality to the mouthfeel. There is definitely a combination of hops in this beer given its complexity and the slightly different experiences you get with each sip. This is no single hop IPA. It's a good IPA, a bit too much IBUs for my taste, a touch thin in the middle, a bit too drying in the finish too.","albern","Jul 24, 2010"

3.95,-0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a hazy amber with some particulate matter floating in the solution. Head was 1.5 inches, cream-colored and more foamy than frothy. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap, with some thin strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Aromas reveal grapefruit and a hint of piny resin on a slightly malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose - very nice balance between sweet and bitter, with a little alcohol coming out at the back and some resinous bitterness that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a somewhat prickly carbonation that leaves some residual burn in the mouth. A solid IPA with a nice balance; however, a little too much carbonation affects the drinkability slightly.

There is also a bit of caramel sweetness behind all the hops. The flavor is moderate-high hops--pine with high hop bitterness.

A nice cloud of haze descends at the end of the pour, but the beer is nice and clear otherwise. The smell is nice and resinous, with a great cakey, biscuity malt sweetness. Though oddly, it seems like I can smell the alcohol, or maybe just something harsh, and a bit yeasty. It smells solid, but it seems like it could be cleaned up a little. The taste is very similar to the smell. Starts out with a lot of malt, with some sweet orange on top, like a toasty, or almost orange flavored coffee cake taste. The malt presence here is nice, but the hop presence is not overshadowed. Very interesting. I still feel like there is an alcohol presence I can detect, which seems strange, or maybe there's a bit too much of an estery presence. The body on this is very good. A bit fuller than medium, with a good rush of carbonation. It is a little grassy and vegetal I think, but otherwise, this one is really very nice. This one is an enjoyable drink, interesting, not exactly one-dimensional. The alcohol presence surprises me, but I enjoyed it. Could probably drink a few in a night.","taylorhamrick","Sep 05, 2009"

Makes me think of caramelized bread crusts. Notes of pine and spruce. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate. Honey can be found if you seek it.","carlborch","Jul 21, 2009"

Typical citrus smell with pine. This may sound wierd but I get a certain scotch tape smell that detect in a lot of ipa's and I find it in this one too. Some may consider it a flaw but I like it. This is a tasty ipa. A very pleasing bitterness overcomes the sweet malt. Tastes of pine, liquid smoke, and lemon also come through. This has a bit more carbonation then most ipa's that I have had.

The taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes similar to the aroma, but there's also a bit of peppery spice, lemon zest and honey noticable too. There's also a slight bitter hoppy aftertaste. Good balance between the hops and malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and dry and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink and it's quite enjoyable.

The flavor is a lot sweeter then I had anticipated from the nose. The malt really dominate the flavor profile. Pineapple, peach and just a hint of lemon zest pop their heads through the malt. Big toffee and caramel overtones. This really had me twisted. I completely expected a hop bomb from the nose and just didn't get it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and and finishes slightly dry.

They definitely used one of the three C hops in this one, grapefruit and pine are representing. Nice smooth hop flavor not at all sharp like some, accompanied by a good malt backbone.

4.4,10.6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Appears a heavily clouded copper hue with a nice off white light khaki head, dwindles slow and forms a nice collar of lacing with fine even streaks left behind after each sip. Aromatics offer up dominant citrus hop bursts blended with refined bready yeast characteristics with some earthy hop undertones. Flavor has a touch of alcohol upfront with a lingering herbal citrus peel harshness, quite abrasive yet remains balanced with enough malts to stand up to the hop bitterness. It stands alone as far as originality with the lack of caramel and although citrus hops are popping it really doesn't make me think of a straight up Bell's clone the way that Founders Centennial IPA does. I'm definitely a happy camper that this showed up for nine bucks a sixer right down the street from my house along side their amber. Medium bodied healthy dose of carbonation, brings on strong hop burps intermittently during the drinking experience. Drinkability is killer doesn't whack you with hops or anyone flavor beautiful aggressive yet tamed hop bitterness packed with flavor, I could drain a sixtel of this with a few friends in no time.

It's not a bad IPA, but it lacks body and is unbalanced, in my humble opinion. There just isn't enough malt sweetness and body to hold up to the bitter hops. The hop flavor is a tad boring, as well, or possibly that's a related problem. The hops are bitterly citric, mostly, but there are some other notes lingering beneath the bitterness. The feel is a tad thin and astringent, not bad really but it's being compared to some pretty good competition.

After waiting a while for the head to settle emptying the rest of the bottle, the beer in glass shone a cloudy orange-amber color when held to light. A great deal of particulate yeast sediment stirred up during the pouring contributed to the cloudiness and gave a less than appealing look- like cloudy hot cider. However, the scent was nice; a mildly sweet, generously hoppy floral aroma, which raised hopes for tasting. The first sip was, unfortunately for the taste buds, uneventful. Flavor was general, nothing outstanding, but decently drinkable. Ditto on the mouthfeel and finish. To the tongue it's an ok American IPA, after the gulp it's as if taking a drink from a pasteurized American light lager- you don't get too much afterward. Also, the yeast sediment at the bottom, for those who aren't particularly partial, is gratuitous and detracts significantly from the drinking experience after the first half of the glass is gone.

By far the best looking head yet: small bubbles, individual mounding, off-white color, great retention, and good lacing. Smell strongly of hops. Definitely fits the style. Tastes of hops throughout, but sadly not as strong in body as I would have thought/hoped. Almost has a watery taste. Started out amazing with the highest rating for appearance I've had, shucks. Crisp and smooth with decent carbonation, but lacking in body. I'm probably over-reacting, but I was so excited by the appearance and the taste just wasn't there.

A strong citrus scent dominates the fragrance, folowed by the aroma of grass and pine, folowed by the faint scent of malt at the end. The malt comes out in the flavor at the start, it then gradually blends itself to some intense hop flavors. Those flavors start with grapefruit which is the most dominate, with touches of grass and pine, and it finshes with tobbaco taste. A slightly watery feel at the front, as it rolls across the palate it gains some weight, to become more medium to maybe full bodied. There is the ever so slight tingle of carbonation at the end. This is a very good IPA, an easy sipping beer. A strong aroma and intense flavor not only makes this an excellent choice for an IPA.

4.39,10.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Probably the most obvious difference between the two is the appearance. While the cooked tree looks completely unfiltered (a very musty/cloudly tan body), the double has a dark-brown, slightly clearer body. The head on the double was light and quickly vanished. The crooked tree had a lasting, fluffy white head of foam with lots of lacing. The aroma's differed greatly as well. Citrus (yet earthy) hops were the dominating aroma in the crooked tree, with sweet malts were drowning out the hops in the double. This also carried over in the flavor. It's hard to believe these have the same hop profile. The crooked tree has a grapefruit hop bite, with a slightly sweet finish. The double has a rich malty sweetness complimented with a rough, bitter, earthy hop punch. I do think the double has crossed over to a very complex barelywine -- certainly with age this is what it will become. The mouthfeel in the double is full-bodied, chewy and dry. The crooked tree is lighter, smoother and finishes with less aggressiveness. Overall, I enjoy both. I will say, however, that the crooked tree is definitely more of an IPA (a damn good one), whereas, the double...is just too malty for the category, in my opinion. The double is very good, but the alcohol is felt and the drinkability is pretty low. Its more of an after dinner treat. Very good stuff.","bwyker","Mar 23, 2007"

Aroma a little weak, but pretty good citrus and pine hop notes, perhaps some room for malts that I don't find, but oh well whatev. Taste is a little better, a lot more assertive, a bit leafier hop profile, pines and citrus backing away a bit, malts still relatively not noticed. Mouth has decent body, good carbonation, but the finish is a bit too dry and even a little metallic.

3.84,-3.5,3,4,4,3,4,"Originally reviewed on August 1, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Rich floral aroma of ruby red, replete with Cascade and a tinge of lemon peel. A hazed pour of light hazel, with an gentle orange fringe. Flavor is a loose flowing sweet cream and candied peaches, bolstered with a heavenly rich sinuous curve of candied resin hops. The malt is in nice balance, I feel. The alcohol plays sweet and helps carry the hop flavors. It all mingles together in general harmony. If I have much bad to say, its that the malt body is a touch thin and the hop character a little one dimensional, lacking diversity and a bit too vegetal. Otherwise, a rich quenching IPA with nice flavor.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 11, 2006"

Biting citrus acidity on the initial taste followed up by a touch of alcoholic sweetness and a touch of metal. The finish is long and quite bitter, with little in the way of malt to attentuate the hops. Mouthfeel is full of fine carbonation.

Pretty typical average IPA smell. The taste is more of the same. The floral hops are dominant here along with a very strong bitterness in the finish, and a pininess also shows up in force, along with a strong dryness. There is also some detectable alcohol. It's tasty, but I would pick several other regional IPAs above this one to drink on a daily basis. The mouthfeel is also nothing special and comes off as a little too thin.

Flavors include hints of biscuit and cereal malts (unless you're eating hot wings, in which case the malts come out and this beer tastes even better than normal) somewhere under there. The hops are AMAZINGLY yummy, strong, herbal, floral, crisp, and in your face. Not burning your tongue resinously bitter, no way, not from this amazing MI IPA!

Hops and floral notes distinguish the aroma. There is also a hint of citrus. While pleasant, nothing really stands out here. Tastes very strong, and somewhat bitter. Hops are very noticeable. Sharp, crisp and flavorful. Citrus hints remain on the back of the tongue. Again, very pleasant. In the mouth, this beer is full, biting and low in carbonation. The hops play on the tongue very memorably. Overall, I would say this is a very drinkable beer for hop-lovers.

More grapefruit comes out in the taste but there's a good amount of spicy and floral hop flavors in there as well. High alpha acidic flavor. Toasted biscuit provides a small balance as well as a sweeter fruit element but its the rough, acidic resiny hops that take the show here, and I'm not complaining. Finish is dry and spicy. Mouthfeel is the only area where this beer really suffers because it is a bit rough (not clean) in the hop department and the body is slightly thin which seems to hurt the malts.

Quite a nice floral hoppiness up front as well. The combination of the hops and malt give this a nice citrus based fruitiness. The finish has a nice bitterness that gives this beer a certain zing to it. The finish is also quite dry, with a malty-biscuits type note to it. As I finish this beer the malt presence becomes stronger and more interesting, reminiscent of lightly toasted bread crust. This is quite a nice IPA, and is emminently quaffable.","Gueuzedude","Aug 31, 2004"

4.07,2.3,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Pretty, cloudy copper color with bare hint of head. Smells like grapefruit extreme, hops, and a slight whiff of plant roots? Tastes superb: for a change, ruby red grapefruit, hops all the way but begins with a wake-up call of astringeny; surprising smooth, long, hoppy finish: is it. . . light caramel? sweet cream? A winner.","marcellaproust","May 21, 2004"
3.67,-7.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Murky ligh brown, like pale Dunkel Weizen, with a thin bubbly head. Grassy, slightly citrucy hops, grapefruit beneith a strong pine scent. Light malt lead followed by a pleasant hop bitterness with a slightly astringant finish. Good hop flavor and well done bitterness.","Sixpack595","May 13, 2004"
4.52,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Bready, crusty and loaded with flavors of caramel, grapefruit, hop crumbs, sour, seasoned oak, black iron and herb. A seductive, glycerin-rich texture supports the dynamic exchange of fine bubbles and tannic grip.","putnam","May 02, 2004"
4.35,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5," Solid bitterness comes right in at the opening sip, punctuated with a muddled mix of hoppy fruit flavors, starting a bit peachy then erupting into bright grapefruit. There's a nice malty sweetness here as well, but the grapefruit hoppiness shines through. Bitterness lingers through to the finish with the hops becoming more apparent as the beer warms a bit more. Body is decidedly medium and mouthfeel is perfect for a nice hoppy IPA. I was very impressed, quite drinkable and extraordinarily tasty. Thanks to trbeer for this one!","mikeys01","Apr 27, 2004"

4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a damn good IPA. Pours a murky dark copper with all kinds of stuff floating around. Long lasting thick tan head. The aroma and flavor are all about citric, piney, resinous hops. Nice solid malty backdrop makes for a good mouthfeel. Seemed like a cruder Celebration to me, which isin't an insult in my book.","pbrian","Feb 08, 2004"

4.13,3.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy deep orange color with two fingers of head. There is lots and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of floral hops, grapefruit, and orange. A fairly powerful aroma. The taste is also fairly hoppy, with way more citrus coming through. It's not as hoppy as a double IPA, but fairly close. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but still smooth. The drinkability is fantastic, and I could savor many of this great IPA.","SheepNutz","Jan 25, 2004"

4.42,11.1,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,4,"The body is a nice amber and leather glow. It's cloudy from the yeast I couldn't keep in the bottle (I like yeast in my beer anyway, plus the barely settled yeast is another sign of freshness.) The head is a nice off-white foam that hangs around nicely despite a sluggish start. The mouthfeel is the only thing that doesn't impress me. But maybe I'm just too distracted by the rest of it. Excellent, Excellent IPA.","aracauna","Sep 11, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Another solid offering from Dark Horse; I wish their stuff was more readily available in my area. I had the IPA with a few friends after work yesterday, and grapefruit was the word of the day. That bitter ""grapefruit"" flavor is often subtle or somewhat understated in a lot of IPAs, but it's truly the dominant flavor in this beer. It's a very well-hopped ale and quite tasty. It's a little pink-ish looking and cloudy in appearance -- maybe more so than I'd like my IPAs to be. And it's a little too bitter to drink a lot of -- for me, anyhow -- but it's a good beer.","marburg","Apr 11, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this awhile back when I found it in Mount Pleasant,nice bronze color with really nice head that left some lace.Very fresh and zesty smelling,tasted of grapefruit and was a little grassy.If ur a hophead I think u would really like this one,Iam not but I still really liked it.","oberon","Apr 01, 2003"
4.12,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A very, very solid IPA. Pours out to an slightly, cloudy, amber color in the glass. Aroma is that of grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy as one might expect with an IPA with traces of a light fruit taste present. A fine beer. I am looking forward to trying Dark Horse's other offerings.","proc","Jan 17, 2003"
4.42,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A nose teeming with fruity hops. A flavor reminiscent of grapefruit juice, but with a big malt ass. An excellent IPA that would cure even the most viscious hop withdrawals. Hazy orange. Fat, sticky head. Perhaps a bit rough in the gullet, but who cares when the hops are rushing in like a dam break. Tasty!","inebrius","Dec 30, 2002"
4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a kick ass beer.  The buttery grassy aroma gives no hint of the bitter beast that lies within.  The malt balance is good for a strong muscled brew like this one.","beernut7","Aug 10, 2002"
