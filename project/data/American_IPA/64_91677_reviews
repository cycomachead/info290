"One of my favorite beers!"

"Overall really enjoy this, perhaps more than 60 minute itself."
"Cool beer idea.. well executed"
""
"Overall, this beer is a very unique offering and would offer a great drinking experience to a wine drinker. Luckily, I have picked up a taste for red wine lately, and this beer does a good job of being both IPA-like and wine-like."

"As a huge fan of Syrah, this one piqued my interest.  When colder, at a ""proper"" IPA temperature, the dryness supplied by the Syrah grapes is a bit overpowering. Allow to warm to near room temperature and this one becomes quite nice.  Pours a beautiful light ruby with light, white head that retains a ring around the glass even while warming and sitting for quite a long time.  Overall a nice, crisp - finishing surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Only had this beer once since it's hard to find but its amazing"
""
"An interesting brew by DFH, but not one of their better ones. Worth a try, but not worth revisiting."

"Reddish pour with little head. Some citrus and vino in the nose. Mild bitterness, with wine notes in the front. Not very notable finish - could be a little crisper/cleaner. It's okay."
""
"This is a wonderful beer that doesn't fit into a particular standardized category... Dogfish Head did an excellent job pioneering something enjoyable, different, and unique when their competitors haven't"
""
""
"O – Crazy and unexpected, wine notes are not overly dominant but are very apparent. Nicely balanced and very good overall."
"The color, the smell, the taste, its all perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tasted like it would give me bad breath."
""
"On tap at DFH Fairfax. Clear copper with purplish thin head. Definitely get the grapes on the nose with some malt and earthy hop character. Some sour grape skin flavor with the typical 60 minute malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Soft carbonation, medium bodied, dry finish."
""
""
"Great tasty beer. Lots of fruity flavors."
"O:  OK beer.  Would not purchase again, however."
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is expensive, and not really worth the price.  I'm sure the brewing and ingredients are ""worth it"" but the taste is a little poor.  It has a weird color of  half amber ale and half pink lemonade.  It smells a little  medicine-y and sour.   Decent mouth feel and body, but the taste is basically an unremarkable IPA with a couple of drops of Robitussin in it.  Sorry, not a winner from Dogfish Head.  Not undrinkable, and if you put forth some effort it is sort of interesting, but it never rises to being very good."

"Surprised how nice the taste   Would buy again"
""
""
"Great beer. Takes a truly fantastic beer -- 60 minute IPA and elevates it to a whole new level. A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a perfect mix"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well if you ever wondered what would happen if you topped off your 60 min with some wine here ya go. Its wonderful, perfect with some food or after as dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly this beer stays on the lips and towards the front part of your mouth.  The carbonation is refreshing and matches the flavor pretty well."
""
""
"Did not care for this one.  The grape smell is a bit offputting and felt like this was just a subpar IPA.  Dont mind the attempt but was not my favorite."
""
""
"Loved the Syrah grape must with an IPA"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a great, no, fantastic beer!  I don’t like IPAs, as I find them too hoppy, too bitter for my taste.  However, this IPA I really, really like.  No, I love it!  The addition of the Syrah grape must, which adds some very nice, fruity, sweet/lightly sour flavors really balances out the piney, bitter hops.  Delicious!"
""
"Good beer. Average beer for DogFish."
"better than I thought. Especially for a syrah wine + IPA combo.right buy again."
"O - 3.5"

"O: This has a overall complex, slightly sour profile that goes well with food. Tastes more wine like characteristics. I wouldn't call this an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex and different. Really enjoyable."
"Really awesome flavor. For whatever reason it reminded me of a pouch of those snack gummies, grape flavor of course."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this beer could stand up to a lot of different food pairings. I think it would go extremely well with salmon. It's not a beer that is absolutely amazing, nor one I would keep readily stashed. However, it's just so unique, that it's fun to try once in awhile. The beer is also a tad bit watery for my taste... Especially for an IPA.I give it an 83/100"
"Hands down one of the best beers. Complex yet drinkable."
"Not an everyday beer for me  but  really like the way it stands apart from other beers."
"Refreshing and fruity - an overall excellent IPA."
"This was not to my taste at all.  The wine musk seemed to give a flavor that destroyed the nice hops that are there."
""
""
"Refreshing IPA with a slight wine kick"
""
"The feel of this beer is light with a smooth finish. This goes down easy and really seems to disappear from glass faster than expected. Thumbs up."
"This unfortunately didn't do it for me"
""
"Extremely smooth - lacking some hop bite.  Very, very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall good drinkability and enjoyable flavors!"
"Overall: An interesting take on a pale ale and quite unique for my palate.  The grape adds complexity, but I feel that it draws some attention away from the hops in this style beer.  This was fun to try, but like a lot of Dogfish Head beers, it isn't one I'd drink much of."

"Overall- A very fresh beer packed with fruit and hop flavors that highlights grapes. What else would one expect from DFH? This is original and well done. One of these of draft would be exceptional. Thumbs up."

"this is a great way to introduce people to IPAs. the grape must does a great job cutting the harsh jumps in bitterness that usually turn people away. probably not for the well seasoned IPA fan, but a good beer nonetheless"

"Quite a good effort from Dogfish Head & on its own a really nice beer but when it follows on from the previous two from the brewery that I've tried it has to be said that this one definitely wasn't their best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very unique IPA. I'd be careful with this one if you've never had an IPA before. It's much different than the 60 or 90 Minute IPA."

"I:  good ""beer"".  Strange,  but good.  Hard to describe.  Tasty.  The only beer in 155 ratings I can't describe. But, I like it."
"Enjoy"
""
"Pours a clear, copper/purple color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Slight retention and slight lacing.  Smells of strong hops, citrus, sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of wheat, and a hint of pine.  Fits the style of an American IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of pine, hint of citrus, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, hint of yeast, and hint of alcohol.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, decent feel, and good body."

"O - Drank this for 20 minutes. I don't think this smacks of a beer/wine combo like others have posted. However. The longer it sat, the more the grapes shone through. An exceptional beer experience."
""
""
""

"Top of the my list of beers,  from the Tap, in a glass is best.  Never drink it out of the bottle."
""
"Pours a red pinkish color. not cloudy at all. Has a nice hoppy fruity aroma. Hop smell like the 90 minute. Haven’t tried 60 so can’t compare that. Kind of a sour aroma to it. Very bitter flavor. Can tell there was grape added. Has a white wine sourness to it. Interesting, but not really my thing. Overall, I would probably not buy again."

"Overall this beer was light and drinkable. %6.5 is masked well. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. However, what I would want in a beer with this description is more flavor from both the hops and the wine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was a nice beer. Flavorful with a slight hop bite. Refreshing on a summer day. I would recommend this beer to folks that like flavored IPA's."
"One of the more odd-sounding mixtures I have encountered. The grape must pairs pretty nicely with the hops to create a brew that tastes quite a bit like sparkling grape juice, although certainly not as sweet. I certainly wouldn't say that it tastes like wine, although a rose might be a good approximation to the color of the beer. Nose is sweet grape (duh) with citrus notes from the hops. Not my favorite DFH by any means, but still worth a try."

"Another concept beer from DFH, love what they do. This one might have started off as an IPA, but it certainly no longer tastes like one. The smell is almost entirely grapes, definitely a wine like character. Musty, not wine must. The first thing I taste is grape - definitely like a sparkling red wine when it opens. There is some hops through the middle and malt on the back, the usual progression I get with IPAs. More hoppy as it warms up. Hops are piney and a bit citrusy, it goes well with the grape. It leaves a sort of candy sweetness in the mouth that is excellent. Mouthfeel is medium - oily. The hops and especially the malt remain in the background, this one absorbed the grapes through and through. Good and a fun experience, but it won't become part of my regular rotation."

"Once again, Dogfish Head has created one of the most unique beers on earth, and one that ""works"". Noble Rot may still stand as the single-most integrated combination of wine and beer in the world, or does it? ... Does this hoppier version of a wine-beer knock it out and take its place?"

"Good stuff."
""

"Another great beer from dogfish head to write home about! Maybe I'm just biased towards the company because I love their approach to brewing and the taste of their unique suds. All that aside, this is an incredibly refreshing beer despite it's potentially deceiving look. I would highly recommend it for an evening with friends or as a night cap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aw, that's cute. It's pink! Minimal head. The smell is some piney hops and a definite hit of grapes. Not wine-like, but actually grapey. The taste starts with some sweet grapey malt that it cut fairly quickly by some nicely balanced grassy hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty good idea that translates into a tasty beer."
""
""
"I really appreciate the concept Dogfish Head went for with this one. Syrah grapes add a wonderful aroma and body to this IPA and give it a slight fruity tone. It all combines together wonderfully giving crisp notes of pine and citrus with a mellow finish of booze soaked raisons. I would buy this again for sure! In my opinion its a perfect autumn IPA. Quite the skillful blend!"

"O - The hops aspects of this IPA seem to be blunted and toned down by the unusual wine ingredients. Hopheads will be disappointed, maybe even irate, but I enjoy this beer on its own quirky merits."

"O: While I'm not blown away, this is a solid and interesting offer from Dogfish Head. It doesn't trump 60-minute and perhaps it should be called ""fifty-nine"" because it's definitely a notch below, but I enjoyed the medley of red wine flavors and the juicy, citrusy hop profile. Worth a try if you're into IPAs and are looking for an interesting spin-off."

"In the days of everything remotely hoppy being misclassified as an “IPA,” perhaps we should consider this a “GIPA – Gose IPA.”"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Intersting brew. The color is the coolest part of this beer. The fact that it ends up tasting like a sweet white wine is ok, but not amazing."
"This beer is great on the presentation but a bit shallow on substance. The grape addition doesn't work well with the tropical hop presence and it all ends up being a bit confused. Unique for sure though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I find this beer to be very good for an IPA that has a good amount of hops but also some sweet from the fruit beer in it. Really excellent balance of grape and hops. Not a session beer, but something that I would enjoy on summer day. Great aroma of hops and citrus/grape fruits that really carry all the way through to the taste."
""
"Poured into my trusty pint glass. Nice color and some head. Not bad Looks and tastes like a red seedless grape. And red seedless grapes are a great seller so this beer is your cross between a beer and a nice fine red wine. Love this beer to death and the price isnt bad for its quality. Cheers to Dogfish Head"

"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 2014. Purchased at Whole Foods in North Austin."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of mild hops, a bit of grapes. Taste is a bit different, the hops are kind of muted a bit, some grape flavor, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while a bit different for this style, is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Delicious! I would definitely drink another one."

"A very interesting beer. The appearance was dark pink with a blush colored head that left a bit of a trail as it fizzed out. The smell was a lot of grapes, but you could get the floral hops coming through as well. The taste was converse for me. The start was a great blend of hops and malt that I loved from sixty minute and then a slow sweet build from the wine grapes. It was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be and would definitely recommend trying it out."

"A different, but pleasant, twist on an American IPA. Something to have when wanting ""something different"". Well-done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't as interesting as I was hoping it would be, but there is no reason not to try this if you like the original. Even more reason to try it if you thought the original was too hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O; a nice innovation; the flavor from the grapes makes this seem like a fruit beer; interesting, but I missed the bitter finish I expect from an IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pink/purple color that is obviously coming from the grapes used. Smell is of some hops along with a faint wine nose. Taste leaves you with a slight sourness from the syrah which are a somewhat spicy peppery grape and a little hop bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp goes down easy. Have bought this a few times and always a pleasure."
""
""
"O: while the grape must brings a different take to the situation, its not necessarily a warranted one that many will find inviting. Im pretty sure this is a good waste of a 60 minute platform which tries to be fancy smancy, but fails to impress for the most part. Okay, but not up to usual dfh standards, not that intriguing or interesting and rather have an 60 min. ipa."
""
"Overall: I love the 90 and 60 Minute IPA's from Dogfish Head and seek them out regularly. This was a nice little change of pace for the 60, without losing any of it's great characteristics...but adding a little tart and funky grape to the mix. I liked it."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours light red with a small white head. Smells of citrus hops, not much else. Tastes of a little red wine with some citrus. Beer is light bodied and finishes clean. Overall a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is like a sparkling wine with the body and sweetness profile of a malty beer. The color is what you'd get if you poured a couple ounces of dark red wine into a light amber beer. The aroma is more red wine than beer. It's not hoppy like the 'IPA' on the label would suggest and neither is the taste. It has some of the taste characteristics common among DFH beers and has a similar mouthfeel. It's an interesting beer for the sake of being different, but I'm not sure that crossing beer and wine works for me."
"O-not sure what this beer was trying to be, red wine must too overpowering and just light beer character, interesting, but would probably not drink again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sixty One pours a purplish reddish color, with a nice tan lacing head. There is a bold sweet grape aroma, with hints of hops. The taste has a nice decent hop backbone, with lots of sweet grape flavors. Good flavors, not overpowering, easy to drink. Overall a very nice well built beer."
""
"As a whole this beer is interesting but has a muddled flavor as the syrah and IPA meld into something hard to identify."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As an IPA its unique."
""
""
""
""
""
"very nice stuff, pours an amber red with not too much head, finger or so. aromas are pungent, a little musk and citrus. taste; subtle bitterness, some candy sweetness. hints of lemon lime and spice notes in the finish. goes down extremely clean, refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure I could drink more than a couple without this getting sort of old but... still a nice brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! I was not ready for the color of this one. It pours; what I can only describe as, a purple amber hue with one of the stark whitest heads I've seen. It leaves a very decent amount of foamy lacing. The aroma is a fruity, sweet and bitter blend of semi dry red wine, citrus hops, caramel malts, bready yeast, and a faint hint of wine alcohol. It is quite a delicious blend and the best thing about this beer. The mouth is light to medium bodied; a little thinner than I would have expected. The flavor follows the nose but slightly subtler. It really tastes like a bottle of sixty minute and semi dry red wine. I don't think that this should work but somehow it does. Nice work Dogfish Head. Keep pushing the limits."

"O- DFH pushes the boudaries again."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty unique and solid take on a IPA. Has the citrus notes you expect with a very big grape presence that blends well with the hops."
"O- This is a hard to review beer for me. I like where they were going for it, but if I hadn't known ahead of time, I would have had no idea this was a modification of 60 minute. Good flavors, and interesting idea, but I think there needs to be some tweaks to it. Worth trying once, but I think I can check this one and move on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it's the 60 minute without the full intensity of the IPA's hops. the added grapes are visible but don't seem to confer much of anything to the taste. a decent beer, but not a necessary one."

""
""
""

"Dark caramel in color with a white head. The aroma was really subtle and hard to pick up on but it was all hop and no wine or grape notes. The aroma was more on the citrus side. This beer was not very bitter and it was very well balanced. I was a little nervous I would be drinking a beer with a strong grape/wine flavor but it was very subdued. The body was lite and the beer seemed a little drier than your normal 60 min. Maybe this is from the simple sugars from the grapes. The subtle grape flavors really pop the citrus hop flavors in this beer. This is a great beer very easy drinking for an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very well done one of my favorite DFH beers I have had this beer in the bottle and its good but having it one tap is the better way to go...Just a great beer for beer and wine lovers...CHEERS"
""

"Bought this bottle in MI on a proverbial lark but will pick up more (for sharing) if another opportunity presents itself..."

"O: The Syrah grape must completely changes the nose, taste and feel of this brew. It is an interesting hybrid."
"I most likely would not buy at the price again, but would pour for a friend to see their reaction, I would have just one if a friend offered."
""
"This pours a semi-clear red amber color with a slight head. The aroma is mild with malts and a touch of hops. The taste is smooth, easy drinking with a decent amount of flavor. The taste is unique with the combination of wine. This finishes with a crisp, bitter finish with a touch of grape. Like everything dogfish head makes, this is delicious."

"looks like a light fruity tea, or a watered down cranberry juice. light foamy on top that disappears quickly. smells like a chardonnay, kind of.... cool and refreshing with a wine kind of feel to it. not getting that ipa feel to it and it does feel a bit like a novelty. but right now, 85 degrees outside, hungover still at 3pm, first beer of the day.... it hits me good. it is refreshing and light, especially for packing a 6.8%. i'm not much for novelties usually, but this is borderline serious beer and it is done decently. just don't push a Zima on me... I wonder if there is a review on BA for Zima???"

"Overall - Was this supposed to be hoppy? Way too much balance and funky weirdness for this to be considered an IPA, me thinks. Maybe more appropriately labeled as a Fruit/Vegetable beer? Regardless, pretty tasty. Worth the high asking price? Probably not. I'll finish the 4-pack, then probably never buy it again."
""
""
""
"O - As usual, a very unique brew from Dogfish. Might be able to please wine and beer drinkers with this one. Not something I would daily drink but a really nice change from the normal IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Difficult to categorize, this beer represents one of Dogfish Head's more interesting--if not successful--experiments. While the base beer may be IPA, the finished product has undergone profound transformation. Wine-like qualities invade almost every aspect of it, yet never to the point of excluding the native beer qualities. Despite its freshness on the palate, it has an unfortunate fatiguing effect. The brewer should take what they have learned here and apply it to a stronger, more decadent base recipe. It will truly be ready for sharing, because a little of this wine must treatment goes a long way."

"Overall, I'm not mad at it… I'm even enjoying it despite what I would consider some rather negative attributes. I won't seek this out again… to many fish in the sea. But if someone brought some by I would not consider them to have bad taste."
"Had the 60 minute IPA taste with a layer of syrah over the top. I could distinguish both very well and it was a pleasant blend. Good sipping beer. Had a light mouthfeel and was very carbonated, maybe a little too much. May pick up some more to give it a proper review."

"Had this on tap at Blackthorn Pub in Holly, Michigan as a guest tap. Has a nice, sweet aroma. The beer has an attractive appearance: a red hue and a nice foam cap on top. The taste is a slight mix of the bitter IPA and the fruity taste of the wine. Very nice overall."

"O: It's an off-centered ale...like everything from DFH. Sam and the gang have mixed up the venerable 60 Minute to give us a really interesting variation that includes Syrah grape must. The only let down was the finish, it seemed a little off for the rest of the flavor, but that's science... I really enjoyed this, will definitely have this again."
"Had this before but wanted to do a full review to see where it landed. Outstanding IPA that I enjoyed very much, not sure why it is getting dinged so much although not as much bitter on the finish for hop heads. A good beer and an IPA that those who are not looking for bitter can enjoy."

"Drinkability – Goes down easy. I like that it’s not bitter, but the beer/grape combo on this one doesn’t really work for me."
"Dogfish makes some good beers... that is to say when they make actual beer, not one of these um, hybrids. It has a weird color, but thats my favorite thing about it. Smells good, hops and just a hint of wine. Then you taste it, and its very light bodied, good hop flavor, but its just not beer... its acidity and grape character make me think of carbonated water with flavor added. Shoulda got Torpedo."

"The beer pours some very light off white and creamy head that dissipates very quickly and levaes nothing behind. The beer itself is a very red clear copper. The beer smell has hints of Syrah grapes, citrus hops, and a sweet malt backbone. The malt and the grapes reinforce the sweet smell with the Syrah providing more of a fruit sweet smell while the malts are merely sweet. The hops mix well with the slight alcohol flavor provided by the grapes. The taste is a bit similar to the smell but different in the syrah grapes provide a fruiter taste and complement the citrus hop bitterness. A little bit of alcohol also appears on the tongue. Also, there is a slight bready taste. The beer has a slight thicker feel than a normal IPA but still goes down smooth bordering on velvety. Very little carbonation exists but can still be felt. Overall, a pretty good IPA and interesting combination."
"O - 3.5 - It's okay. It's a different idea, but not the best for a beer IMO. Too much like a wine cooler or malt beverage for me."

"This was one odd beer. It's brewed with syrah wine grapes which is what makes it so damn weird. The color was the first thing I noticed while I was pouring it out, it was like a clear pinkish purple rose color. The smell was very grape and wine heavy with hints of hops coming through. The odd combination of the ipa and grape coming together was a real treat and each distinct flavor went together so well. Overall I definitely enjoyed this beer although I can easily see how some people wouldn't. Would I get it again? I'd have to say yes."

"O - Pretty awesome beer. Very drinkable. Doesn't taste anything like 60 minute, has a much lighter taste, almost like a white IPA. Probably the most unique beer I have had in quite a while."

"Not a very good beer in my opinion. It is crystal brown in color with a purple tint to it. Not too much of a head, but that could have been the pour. My initial reaction was that it's very similar to a champagne. Actually more so than an IPA. It din't taste much like 60 minute at all. If I blind tasted this, I wouldn't guess it had anything to do with it. Even at only 6.5 % it resembled a normal abv champagne because of the bitterness that followed the initial bubbly palate."

"You would think with a rating of 81 (at the time--12 Dec 2013) that this would be a marginal beer. This is actually not the case at all. This pours a nice purpulish-red hue...and the taste is smooth and really good. It is a good to-to regular drinking beer....not overly powerful on the abv where you drink a couple and you are smashed and wasted, but it is a good beer...really nice and really drinkable. In my opinion, this beer is better than a lot of the 90+ rated beers out there...."

"Smells like 60 minute, piney earthy and citric hops, bright white head, looks like 60 minute but with a slightly pink hue. A good beer again very much like 60 minute but with less bitterness masked slightly by a rich and savory Syrah taste along mid palate that follows it into the finish taking away from the hops a bit. While 60 minute leaves hops on your breath, 61 leaves red wine. I like it, it's definitely different then 60 minute but not in a better way I think, the wine detracts from the hops a bit and even takes over some of the delicate malt favors, it's all still there you just got to look for it. The wine presence isn't even overpowering, but red wines a powerful flavor and makes itself known."
"O- I'm not sure I'd want to drink this regularly, but I enjoyed trying it. It's interesting to see what the folks at DFH come up with."
"The flavor profile is almost the complete opposite of the aroma. The nose was dominated by vinous fruit with subtle hops but the flavor is very hop forward with dry, earthy bitterness that lingers over the malt backbone and vinous fruit flavors into a dry finish. Floral and earthy with grassy, piney hops that provides bitter resinous flavor which is countered by caramel malt, toasted bread and dark fruit. The grape must stands out with jammy sweetness along with hints of currant, raisin and plum. The grape must provides a nice counterpoint to the bitterness but the hops are a bit one dimensional and the malt backbone is stronger than I prefer. Easy to drink and an interesting take on the continuously hopped minute series but it's not a beer that I would seek out again."
""
"Pours a four finger faint pink head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear copper/red color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Light hop nose and flavor is tart grapes and some hops. $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"Overall - Very interesting beer, if I can call it that - a blindfold might find the taster thinking sparkling wine vs. beer.

"O: I quite enjoyed this off-center IPA both times I've had it. Be forewarned that the hop level is more that of an Amer. Pale Ale, and the bitterness is low even for that style."
""
""
"Interesting taste combo. The hops are more citrus in the taste, and an earthy yet juicy grape flavor is here, slightly medicinal. There is also a bready malt presence that balances out this unorthodox brew in a well-done way I'd only expect from DFH. The grape must makes certain it is the defining aspect of this beer. Medium body and ample carbonation; a little sticky, and a little dry finishing due to some astringency. I didnt focus on this being an IPA whatsoever while reviewing this, the main reason being the brewery selected this as a year-round affair. Works for me. Aged cheddar with cracker going great with it too (as it would with grape wine). For what this creation is, it certainly lives up to its name. Other reviewers' impressions of this beer seem to express a loss to ""categorize"" it, but for me, I feel DFH succeeded once again in pushing the boundaries."

"O: I've loved some of the other DFH must-wort combos, so I was surprised at how disappointing I found this one. Rather than rounding out a great beer, as was the case on some of the other cases, the must here seems to give rise to some very unpleasant off-flavors."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/8/2013. Pours lightly hazy copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of mango, red grape must, peach, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/musty earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and grape must notes with balanced malt; and good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, red grape must, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, light pine, and floral/musty earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness/bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, grape must, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, light pine, and musty earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of hop and grape must flavors; with a good malt balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good flavored IPA style. Good balance and complexity of flavors and very smooth to drink. Flavors were a bit like grape soda at times; but this is a unique and nicely enjoyable offering otherwise."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty mediocre beer from Dogfish Head. I love the hop aroma and taste but that is about it. Not my favorite."
""
"O - Yeah just not for me. There's nothing to sink my teeth into aside from the overpowering grape flavor. If this was a hop forward IPA with the slight taste of grapes I would really enjoy it. Or at the very least if they had cranked the ABV and made this strong you'd get the heat from the alcohol which would give it some bite. Anyways, I won't be picking this up again. But I understand this is for people with different preferences so disregard my opinion if you prefer fruitier and lighter beers."

"Date on bottle says it is 2 months from bottle date. Pours deep red with a one finger white head that has an ever so slight pinkish hue to it. Aroma is big floral and pine hops up front, but this quickly fades into a musty grape red wine smell. Very interesting! Flavor is close to an APA to start with some definite pine. I suspect I missed out on some of the hop profile due to it being 2 months old. After the first sip and up front pine, things are mellowed into a subdued hop flavor that mends surprisingly well with the grape. Syrah does not overpower this but does supplement it in an interesting way. Not sure if this is an IPA or a fruit beer. A bit of tartness to go with the bitter. Light to medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. I actually think this is decently done. But I suspect it won't be a year round brew for long."
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: This a very interesting and unique concept by DFH that is very well done as well as being refreshing and tasty. Once again DFH gives us the opportunity to try a beer that is unique in style and that we wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to try. Classified as an American IPA @ 6.5%. Consumed 9/7/2013."

"Doesn't make 60 Minute any better or worse; just different. As someone who doesn't particularly like 60 Minute, 90 Minute or 75 Minute 61 doesn't butter my bread either. From my the perspective of a left in the fridge beer I liked the variation on a familiar theme."

"While this was a bit strong, the alcohol felt just right and gave a subtle warming sensation to this beer. The hops were hard to find and only full emerged after I polished this off, leading me to faintly associate this with an IPA. There's nothing out there quite like this and it's worth a go for someone looking for something a bit out of the ordinary. Like the 61 in baseball, it needs an asterisk after the number to further elaborate on the significance of the number. It's an IPA by nature but on a level that warrants a taste to see what the fuss is all about. Worth a go once for anyone who loves Dogfish head or beers of this style with some substance behind them."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - way better than any fruit beer, and as good as the best of pumpkin beers, but the grape must is much more interesting and inviting. Lighter and a nice change of pace. Must try. Suited more to summer, fall, and warm weather. Bravo!"
""
"Overall, a very weird but tasty little beer. Would love to get my hands on a fresher bottle since there are hints of what may have at one point been a truly great beer. As it is, a slighly different take on a fruit beer is the best I can offer up. On the bright side, probably better than most fruit beers."

"Bottle: Poured a light purple color ale with a small foamy head with light retention and almost no lacing. Aroma of bitter hops notes with some grape notes.

Interesting mix between the IPA and the grapes."

"Wow, I tried this tonight and was a bit underwhelmed when I first tasted it but it then certainly grew on me as I finished the beer. THe grape is there but not too strong. It is a very good blend of bitter and sweet. I only had one but certainly would have liked more tonight! I am looking forward to getting this again."

""
""
"Poured a clearish red, almost purple body, with minor head and lace on top of an aroma that is a tad malty and citric hopped but more grape and winelike, including the oakiness. I enjoyed this beer but it's not something I would get again. It's on par with the regular 60 IPA but the grape must seems to either distract or minimize the hop and taste profile of the beer rather than enhance it. The hops do shine through and there is balance with dry malt adding an edge and touch of sweetness, and the grape must at times adds a slight sour edge to the beer but sometimes it's just flat and unappealing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad at all--especially for the novelty. I liked their Noble Rot more because I think the overpowering wine taste works better with an already kind of tart beer like a saison. The story behind this (if you watch Sam Calagione's quick sips on youtube) is really nice and I think I can appreciate it more in light of the history."
"Ruby red hue pink tinged white head, fine even lacing, so that's what Syrah grape must does to continually hopped IPA. 61 IPA from our friends at DFH. It's nose is earthy fruity with grape must, slightly sour with bready grains filling the dominant aspects of the aromatics. Flavor is tart up front with the grapes kicking, tartness is nice very drinkable earthy hops slide along the palate as well it's actually a good combo. Mouthfeel finishes nice and dry ample even natural carbonation through each sip this is an enjoyable experience, overall I didn't know what to think when I saw 61 on the shelves."
""
""
""
"O: I usually love DFH, but this is not a beer I would seek out again. I appreciate it's interesting flavor, but I would have liked more malt for balanced sweetness."
"Overall - Not bad, not great. The grape really overpowers the beer. Its a tad more sour then I expected, and it doesn't resemble 60 minute flavor wise at all since the grape takes over. Still its ok to drink but not something id seek out again. Not so over the top flavor like a lot of dfh beers tent to be."
""
""
"O-I think hit or miss beer. I remember first time trying I liked it a lot. Second time, with palate more experienced, I am more critical of it for valid reasons. 61 is not chuggable. Weird flavors make it medicinal, like a kid sipping cough syrup from a spoon. But you won't regret trying it. It is Dogfish after all, and a part of the quality ""Minute Series"". This is the weakest of the minute offerings though. Would drink if offered, not buy again. End effect: 61 is 60 minute with cheap boxed white zinfandel thrown in."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, not great, but I finished the four-pack. It was a nice twist without entirely sacrificing the original's hop character."
""
"Certainly an interesting beer. The grape must blends well with the IPA base."
""
""
""
""
"This is a non-IPA drinker's IPA. Nowhere near as hoppy as 60 or 90 minute, but no matter. It's a very interesting an complex beer, especially using the grape must. The grapes really come through in the flavor. I've had a lot of beer-wine hybrids and I think this is the best out there. A really well-done and complex beer. I can see how it would be disappointing to IPA fans, but I think its another great experimental Dogfishhead beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a copper color with some purple highlights and a head that isn't massive but that leaves some nice lacing. The smell is grape, pine, citrus, and alcohol. The taste is more of the same, and the hops of the 60 minute IPA are muted considerably by the grape and resembles nothing of the former style. Instead, this is a new creation, something that could use tweaked but that still manages to be interesting and tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and while it is thicker than I would normally prefer, it seems to hold the flavors well. Overall, this is an experimental beer, and it doesn't succeed remarkably, but it's still worth trying once."

"(3.75) D: This is an interesting IPA that is light and refreshing. The grape must provides a lightly acidic and fruity quality that I found favourable."
""
"It looks like grape juice, or wine. You can smell the grape, and some berry notes. The finish tastes just like a wine, it's dry. Taste- Starts off with a mixture of Syrah, some light cherry and strawberry. You can taste some hops like you normally do from an IPA, but the marriage between wine and beer is great with this beer. There isn't much of a piney taste with this beer, and that's great with this style of IPA, and wine."

"The palate is a blend of grapefruit hop flavor and fermentable base. There's plenty of vinous character here, alright - grapes, berries, earth, leather - but it simply doesn't work with either the chalky bitterness of the hops or the high level of carbonation present. Furthermore, the palate is watery, resulting in the beer having a seltzer-like/carbonic acid bitterness. Hop bitterness is low, and the limited flavor is disappointing as well. Medium-light in body, this beer finishes with a blend of sweetness and grapefruit bitterness. Ultimately, an intriguing but failed experiment."

"An aggro pour to start netted me two-plus fingers of dense, pinkish head, like raspberry cotton candy, with good retention. Color was a pinkish-amber and SRM did not apply. Nose was very vinous, quite like grape juice or grape jelly. Mouthfeel was quite effervescent and I have to admit, it was more vinous than beer-like. It had a tart taste, like table wine when I was a kid. That may be why I never caught onto wine the way I did with beer. It just never tasted right. Same way here. It seemed to me like a waste of perfectly good hops. I guess that if I were more of an oenophile, I might enjoy it more, but this was not my cuppa tea. Finish was semi-dry, but I was thinking of it more as wine than as beer."

"O – This is a decently tasty beer but it’s not an IPA at all. I don’t really have any idea what it is. If I was rating strictly by style, this beer would be way down in the cellar. But the reality is that, no matter what style it is, it’s pretty tasty and decently drinkable. An interesting idea, and nice to try, but I won’t be getting it again."

"O: A very interesting and well done beer. Would love to see this available in 6 packs. Very refreshing, perfect for a nice summer day."
"Served on tap at the Emporium Bar Arcade. Logged from notes. Appearance is light and pale with no collar and some sticky lacing. The nose is white grape forward with grassy light hops. Weird combo here that I can't quite get behind. The taste is sweet and grainy with the grape must taking on the primary notes here. Notes of caramel sit beneath the grape, minimal hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little thicker than I'd want. Overall, just not a fan of this wine/IPA hybrid."

"Odd pinkish white head, mostly loose larger bubbles which crest around one finger and rapidly decline from there, the lacing is smooth sheets with close to zero stickiness. The liquid looks like cranberry juice diluted with water, bright but lacking in intensity, very active bubbles, rising rapidly to the surface. The nose is sour, cranberry, cherry, red grape fruit, pulped oranges, minerals, cracked pepper, comes across more as wine than beer. Light-bodied, the carbonation tries very hard to create presence and does add crispness. However, it still seems dilute and lacking in heft. Here you do get more leafy qualities and grain to well baked country bread. The quinine to mineral persists. Hard to discern any clear malty flavors, more of a textural contribution. Citrus peel, same array of cherry, raspberry, strawberry type fruits. Some dried pine sap and pressed flowers as an aftertaste. Monochrome and not really all that interesting. You easily get tired of sipping it, albeit it is not flawed in the strong sense."

"Overall, unusual and fairly good. As noted above, I can't imagine myself wanting this very often, but it is fairly tasty."

"Well, my expectations for this beer were low. The look and aroma kind of redeemed things a bit for me. But then tasting it pretty much just killed everything. I don't know where things went wrong, but this was a disaster. And I don't understand how it can be labeled an IPA. It's more like a wine cooler gone wrong. A half & half mix of 60-Minute and Boone's Farm would probably taste better than this stuff."
""
"O: I found the mixture of an IPA and syrah grape must to be rather interesting and unique as it neither tastes like a beer nor a wine but is quite easy to drink and has some interesting flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting approach on the standard IPA. Leave it to DFH to be continuously pushing the boundaries. May not be one I go back for again but was worth the experience."
""
""
""

"Overall an interesting IPA. Tasty to boot."
""
""
"A pretty cool experiment overall. The flavors don't meld amazingly but I actually like this a lot more than some of the other edgy DFH beers."
"O: An interesting experiment, but not something amazing. Always interesting to see what DFH is coming up with, the beer is an interesting mix of wine and beer, but fails to meet expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is going to be very divisive. I actually like it okay. It's not great, but it's pretty good. DFH likes to experiment a lot of with wine grapes in their beer, some of those experiments are misses, some are pretty good. This is somewhere in between, but towards the good side. The hoppiness of the the 60 minute IPA keeps it from being to sweet, but the wine character comes through. All in all, worth a try and one of the better experiments from DFH."
""
""
""
""
"It was about what I expected. It's another interesting concept by DFH that is fun to try but nothing I'd want again."
"O - This is remarkably different than the regular sixty minute IPA, and it's good. The tart grape must really takes the forefront and blends well with the hops and sweet malt. Overall it was very drinkable and flavorful and is really enjoyable if slowly sipped."
"This is a brew that I have spent a considerable amount of time sipping in an attempt to pull all the pieces together, and so far the result has been pretty good. There's a lot to pick out here, and so this brew would be both an excellent slow sipper or a fine summer afternoon quaffer. Take your pick. I'd really need to sit this one next to the 60 Minute to see what has been changed or improved between the two, but as it stands I count myself as a fan of the Sixty One."
"Poor excuse for an IPA, while not a horrible beer. Definitely not worth the price"
"O: I must say I don't quite know what to make out of this beer. It still has some nice hoppiness but it also has things going on from the grapes. It's an interesting combination and the flavors play well together. it's interesting, intriguing, not off putting, and flavorful though. It's definitely something different."
" drink this again from time to time."
""
"Pours a clean reddish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops with a red wine like presence. In the taste, orange citrus hops, and dry red wine like oakiness, however quite thin and watery. A small hop bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and watery red wine presence in the aftertaste. Decent flavor if it was not watered down so bad."

"O - I was so excited to try this beer when it came out . This is probly the best year round offering dogfish head has come out with awhile. This beer comes through with a punch of grape flavor then leads you to a musky wine like taste then lets you have just a bit the hops before it slips away smoothly. There is a .5 increase in alcohol strength but you would never no it . Very drinkable light and full of flavor . Loved this beer"
"Overall: A different summer treat. What I would expect as a mix of an ipa and a dry red wine. I would not rush out to get this, but I can see this as a great substitute for wine."
""
"Overall - Can't say I've ever had a beer quite like this one.. While I find it interesting, this is definitely not something I'd seek out in the future. It's like a wine cooler meets a IPA. Found myself wishing this was either a 60min or a 90min instead. Still worth trying to see how different/original beer can taste."

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Bottled on 2/26/13 indicated on the neck. Pours a coppery brown hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a two-inch, bright white head that slowly collapses into a consistent 1/8th inch cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Thick swaths of lacing coat the glass just above the line of the liquid. Nose expresses grape juice, buttery notes and an herbal/piney character at the back. Taste is a bit strange - a little buttery, a little acidic and some earthiness. Not much of a hops presence. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation and a slightly watery/oily texture. Overall, not my cup of tea. I was hoping for an interesting hybrid like Noble Rot, but this beer falls short. Maybe it is too far past its prime, but it doesn't even really resemble an IPA."

""
""
"O: A really nicely executed experimental brew. In all honesty, I'm kind of surprised that the average review on this site sits around 3.50 because this ale is flavorful, but also incredibly well balanced. My only complaint is that the aroma could be a little stronger and a little more complex. If you, like me, are an odd bird and think the idea of Syrah and IPA together sounds both natural and incredible, then give this one a go. It's worth it."
""
"O: glad I have tried it, but also glad I don't have a ton more of it waiting for me."
"Overall -Leave it to dogfish to do something like this and I think it works but not really something I'd go out of my way to get."
""

"All in all this is unique, vivacious and tasteful. It holds some qualities of the IPA but the grape must steers it in its own direction."

""
"Sixty-One is another DFH special that comes across as more of a novelty beer than a worthwhile experiment. The Syrah must is an interesting addition, but the end product is decidedly inferior to the rest of the Dogfish Head IPA lineup. Aprihop is a much better fruit IPA."
""
""
"Overall: A real IPA with a light fruit tone to it. Not bad at all. It feels more like something meant for summer and just apparently that is when I reviewed this beer. It is something new and little different to DFH's great IPA selection...either you will hate it or love it. Salud!"
"Reddish amber hue. Pink white bubbly foam about a quarter inch thick on top. Aroma is a complex blend of hearty red wine grapes and hops. The taste mirrors the aroma. The Syrah grape flavor is on the forefront,but quickly fades into bold,sticky Northwest hops."
"0 - Overall its a decent beer but nothing special anyone should go out of the way to have. Its a good beer to bring to a tasting or pair with some cheese/charcuterie but to me its anti-climactic in its overall appeal. That being said I think its worth a try for the true heads."
""
""
"Overall: Dogfish tried to do something experimental but the result was more like something that many will denigrate as a chick beer"
""
"O: Personally I was not a fan of this beer. There was nothing of positive value that the Syrah grape must added to this beer, from the experience that I had. It seemed like an empty and pointless gesture."
""
"Definite hop impact in the beer but the aroma and flavor both feel a little muddled. Things are not working in harmony with this beer."
"Overall, an interesting idea, but I prefer their Aprihop."
"Not really for me, but an interesting beer to try. I would've liked a bit more body and a bit more hop to come through."
""
"Drinkability: This is a beer that I'm glad I've tried, but really its nothing to write home about. Nothing I would seek out, or really; quite honestly, would even tell someone ""Oh you have to try this beer."" Nothing real special. Nothing real different."

"O- Kudos to Dogfish for continuously trying to push the envelope. This is a beer that has to be spotted or complemented well for it to work."
""
""
"Comes out of the bottle a peachy looking color, but ends up a pretty standard amber in the glass with a tall, creamy, pinkish head and drippy rings of lace. Interesting aroma...vaguely hoppy, slightly buttery, red grapes, pine, and flowers. Flavor comes across unfortunately thin. Fruity wine, watery sweetness, light resin, caramel, and orange. Medium bodied, creamy, and a little tart. I'm not real sure what to think about this. It's not awful for most of the glass, but it's sure not an IPA either. By the last sip though, the weird wine-y tartness becomes a struggle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an interesting beer that I would drink again. I'm not sure it should be compared with other IPAs because its completely different from the typical IPA experience. However, its a solid beer."
""
""
"O - man what a weird brew. This really is something that never should have been bottled. DFH's 60 minute ipa is a gem and to think someone would actually mix anything with it is a bit disheartening. Ill just turn my head if this is ever brought into a 60 minute ipa conversation. However, it does have some highlights with the fruitiness and tart like characters. It'd been am excellent brew without that odd and ridiculously weird musty flavor that never really seems to leave. Other than that the beer is a 4 across the board. But for a brewery that produce some good ales and some unique offerings this is a miss. To think the owner of this brewery would mix a wine with his 60 minute creation is ridiculous to me. Give it a try I suppose but its nothing more to me than just a try."
""
""
""
"O- this was an interesting beer, there were IPA qualities but the grape must almost pushed this into a herbed/spiced beer for me, i wouldn't make a point to go buy this again but i'd drink it if it was around"

"Pours a garnet hue with a bubbly head which is as white as sugar. Not much head retention or lacing. There's a slight haze and light can definitely pass through the glass. No sediment. The n nose on this one is very herbal with citrus fruit esters as well. There's a light hop taste similar to that of their 60-minute IPA. The mouth feel is initially soft, however for the finish a hard bitterness comes in with a huge punch of wine grapes. Overall, this is a very interesting experiment as usual for DFH, and I would call it a success. I would order this again, and also if you like this, try their 'Noble Rot.'"

"61- is an interesting idea. the color is a really cool looking rose-brown with a thick white head. smell is really hoppy. the taste is pretty hoppy with a slight dry red finish, which i think works pretty well. i have enjoyed these wine, beer hybrids that dogfish head has been putting out. i look forward to trying others."

"a ruby pour with a finger of bright white head.. no lacing left behind. smells of wine barrels and cascade hops, caramel and barley grain bill. the flavor is a little weird, slightly fruity, sweet, but hoppy bitter and then the bitterness from the grapes comes in as well. not as bad as i thought it would be, but i'm probably never going to buy this again (and glad i only picked up one bottle.. it's a little hard to drink to be honest). basically is way more on the wine side than it is ipa.. including its dry finish. as a hop head, i can honestly say nothing about this is like an ipa. it doesn't help that i very seldom find a wine i enjoy drinking. i'm just not that thrilled about this one, sorry dfh.. i'm usually backing up most of your one-offs, but i feel like it's a dick move to make something like this one a year round beer while there were other excellent way more ""for everyone who likes beer"" that could've filled its shoes."

"An experiment, seemingly gone wrong. Not horribly, like cut off the wrong leg, but maybe cut off the wrong toe kind of wrong. Glad I only have 1 to drink."
"O- interesting beer. I was hoping for more ipa sliding into Syrah but not bad"
"O: To start this off i am also a wine drinker so this is something that appeals to me. My fiance is more of a wine drinker and she greatly enjoyed this. Its unique. Enough of an IPA that you know its there but the syrah shines. Very balanced between the two styles. Delicate and floral! /90"

"M - Medium body. Somewhat creamy. Light carbonation."
"I have had beers brewed with wine grapes before and it is an interesting hybrid....neat to try, but more than one, for me would be tough. This beer poured a brown with violet hue. The head was slightly purplish and did not lace. The smell had bitter hops and slight essence of wine. The taste was very bitter from start to finish. Toward the end you could taste a dry wine like flare. The mouthfeel was medium in body with ok carbonation. Overall it was neat to try, but so many other awesome offerings from DFH....I would choose them over this."
"o - i am still enjoying this beer as i type. i think it's gotten better as it's warmed up a little bit. all in all, a neat experiment and something i would buy again, especially for drinking on warm evenings."
""
"O - Balanced but overall a toned down version of what I love in an IPA. This is solid and a nice one off of the normal IPA line. A refreshing brew."

"M&D&O - well crafted, layered, blended. A nice brew for the summertime. Not sure if I would pick this over 60, 90, or 120 minute at the store."
""
""
"I will add this to my list of go-to interesting brews. I like Midas better, but it is a completely different animal."
"brew poured a semi transparent ruby with a pinkish head. interesting look for an ipa, but attractive, none-the-less. the smell is also quite interesting, but this is DFH so lets say off centered. the grape must comes through in a fairly big way. taste is more of the same. very syrah with almost a pale ale underneath. this gives the beer an almost fruit beer kind of vibe. the feel is fairly malty and almost a bit lagery or even marzen with the aftervibe. i like it, don't love it. i'll enjoy my 4 pack but probably won't seek this one out again...but also wouldn't shy away from it. decent beer, but not if you are looking for an ipa."
"D: certainly unlike any brew I have had before and while I appreciate this, I think this could use some tweaking. what that is, im not even sure. maybe dial up the IPA and dial back the must? yeah, that would probably be my best idea. thanks for trying DFH!"

"T: Kind of a strange blend of lemon, hops and wine. Hops come off a bit citrusy, but the sweetness of the wine keeps holding them down. Hints of bready malt as well. A lingering kind of off sourness throughout. An interesting experiment, but I don't know if this one really works."
""
""
"Overall this is more like a dry saison, a beer for Lenten repentance. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego."
"OV: Honestly, I was expecting more from this beer. As I said above, it's like the grape flavour just throws a blanket over the other flavours, muting them. It's decent if you like wine grape taste, but it needs the other flavours to stand out more and blend with balance."
""

"O: Definitely unique and interesting. Not a good way to get a hop fix but a refreshing beer that I'd enjoy now and again. Gotta be in the mood for grapes though. Cheers"

"O: I was pleasantly surprised here - not a beer I'd drink as a go-to, but for the experience and creativity? Hell, yeah. Very appealing, successful rendition from the masters of the experimental beer, Dogfish Head."

"O: A good IPA with fruit inclinations. Did someone use Ringwood Ale yeast, I've thought this yeast need more a a diacetyl coma than a rest but it totally works here. A bit overpowering at first but it sort of works together after a few sips. If you haven't had it's worth picking up."
"Overall – Not really my thing. Too much red wine like, not quite enough hop for an IPA and a little confusing tasting. Worth a try, but not one I would go back to on any real occasion."
""

""
""
"Now, if only Sam and his folks will brew an IPA for every minute between 0 and 120... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly-glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, grass, pine resin, and a very light twinge of menthol in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with no menthol character, but with a balance that would inspire envy in any brewer. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice IPA, one showcasing the beauty of balance without sacrificing a strong hop character."
"First thing I can say is that 61 minute is a really interesting beer. Initially, the pour made me think of a Belgian Tripel or Quad in appearance: it's got this dark fruit red color, with a bright white head that starts out less than a finger but sticks around for the entirety of the experience. EXCEPT, it's pretty transparent and holds light really well. Nothing too special about the smell, considering this is an IPA. It's definitely ""musty"" but subdued; sour and tart aromas are so present. Taste is really interesting as well. It has that fruity musty character to it, a little sour and sweet. It doesn't really taste like an IPA. Mouthfeel is a little biting at first, but mellows and smooths as it warms up. Super drinkable. Overall this is really unique beer, so glad I have three left to enjoy. Not what I was expecting."

"The beer pours an impressive looking, clear crimson/rusty brown with 1/2 an inch of a bleach white head that laces. The nose is interesting, a pungent interplay between grapes and hops, predominantly a slightly tart, grape seed, vinous sweetness and tropical fruits put off by the continually-hopped base beer. The taste presents the same interesting grape-IPA harmony, subtle yet distinct, but more of the yeast cuts through adding complexity and depth. Sweetness upfront, a solidly medium body, slightly tart, vinous, and semi-dry finish, no booze, very drinkable. I do enjoy the combination, more so using the IPA-base compared to the saison base because of the interesting character the hops add. I'd say it's worth a try for most IPA/hybrid-beer lovers and I'd definitely try this beer again."

"if this is the regular 60 with grape must added, I think its a great failure, as the hops don't come through this really at all. if it is a new beer wine hybrid with a misleading name, I think its pretty good when compared to the field. it pours a pink tinted copper color, clear as day, with a half inch of bone white airy fizz. the nose is more wine than grapes, with some tannic properties that don't totally jive with the hops. the hops seem scaled way back, or less fresh or something. 60 minute is one of the great American india pales, and this makes it seem so average somehow. the flavors really do work pretty well though, with the fruity grape must sticking to the sweeter malt and developing nicely. I just wish I got more hop bitterness and flavor out of this towards the finish, but it just isn't there. I don't know how, but they killed that part of it with the grape must. lighter in body than expected, with enough carbonation and a sweet dry finish, which is an interesting twist to al already out there brew. not my favorite, but like all dogfish head beers, it is well made and worth a try."

"Overall, this is certainly interesting beer, the grape must adding a noticeable, and mainly complementary mustiness to the bitter hops. There is a bit of clashing, however, especially in the aftertaste, which is overly bitter, but even the main mouthful tends to be quite astringent. It’s certainly worth a try for the novelty, but I’m not quite certain the combination works."

"It starts with a subtle white head that does not hold for long but rather lingers in the background all the way down the glass. The nose is pleasant enough with a wisp of the grape that is named on the label. The taste is first that of wine with a distinguished sweetness that follow into a quick dryness that lingers on the tongue. Is it the grape or the hops that create the dryness (it's for the brewer to know and for us to find out). Let me not forget the playful color of light ruby red. Does Marnie Old know about this beer or was the debate of beer vs wine the inspiration. Whichever this is a beer to seek out."
""
""
""
""
""

"Once tasting the flavor from the grape must is more apparent and the hops very much subdued. The must imparts a vinous tartness that's is enjoyable and unique. The hops act as a finishing act rather than the main show. There is also some bready and nearly caramel like malt the provides a good backbone and mouthfeel giving the beer some needed heft. Overall it's a unique and enjoyable beer, but does not impress or overwhelm in any way. Enjoyable beer that I would have again if offered, but I'm unlikely to seek it out."

Return of the cranberry lambic, okay not that bad but this is too weird, DFH really getting creative here but it just isn't a pleasant experience aroma or taste wise. That cheesy pungent aroma is really off putting and impacts the flavor. I don't think that this does the wine in beer idea justice, better off pouring some decent merlot into a 60 minute. The beer is easy enough to drink but why would you."

"The beer pours a deep purple color with a 1/2"" white head that has a slight pinkish hue. The aroma is good. It's a perfect marriage between a light, refreshing IPA and fruity grape juice. The hops and grape characteristics play off each other while the malt aroma provides a stable balance. The taste is decent. It has a nice mix of pale malts, hops, and grapes. It goes down quick, almost too quick. The grape flavor numbs the hop character a bit, while adding a quaffable fruitiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It's unique and interesting, while still being a very tasty and enjoyable beer."

"Pours clear light red/dark pink in body with a white melted marshmallow head. Smells of grape must, honey, wine-like fruit notes but of a lighter variety, wild cherries. Tastes of wild cherries (guessing the Syrah grape must is the cause), sour honey, sharp acidic fruitiness, tart, citrus hop character, medicinial notes, some booze and bitterness in the background. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty good, if this was offered in a six pack it might be more of a go-to. The four pack is a lame choice for a year round IPA."

"Mouthfeel is a little soapy, slightly filmy. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but I won't buy it again."
"O: I'm bummed out by this beer. It's just too off the wall to be truly good. I love wackiness and experimentation, but this beer misses the mark. It's too much gym sock, not enough grape, and way over malted for an IPA."

"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 2/26/13. Served in a Dogfish Head pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white/light pink head that sticks around for a long time. There's a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, the brew smells like red grapes/wine, floral and citrusy hops, caramel malt and some berries. It tastes like red grapes/wine, grainy/bready malt, and light citrusy hops. I'd say it's more grapes than IPA, but that's alright. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, a bit slick and easy enough to drink. I think this is a solid brew, definitely worth a try. I know I won't have any problems finishing my other 3 bottles. $9.99 a 4-pack."

"O: Kind of a mess. Clashing flavours on this one."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of a fruit infused IPA, I don't think there's any other grape must infused IPA's to compare it to, but I thought it was an interesting and unusual take on a traditional American IPA. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these on a warmer summer day, it was more drinkable then I was expecting. What I liked the most about this beer the drinkability, I never thought this beer would be as drinkable as it is. What I like the least is how light the hops are, I think more hops would make this beer more IPA like, maybe they need to make 91 or a 121, I might buy this beer again, I think this would be a nice beer to share with someone who usually doesn't like beer, I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind fruity IPA's. All in all I thought this beer was pretty solid, but I do wish it was little more IPA like and little less sparkling wine like, but for a beer that I didn't have high expectations for, this one turned out pretty nice and I'm glad I took a chance on it. Nice work Dogfish head, This a good example of an odd beer that tastes better than it sounds."
"Had a four-pack of these, poured into teku/flute/tulip just for fun. Pours a pretty pink-purple with a lovely contrasting white fizzy head. Smells of both beer and wine...similar to the Noble Rot. Taste starts with the grape flavor of a white or pink wine, then hops take over, then a dry wine-like finish. Incredibly drinkable and refreshing, I wish I had another 4-pack to enjoy. It's not quite beer, not quite wine...certainly not a fruit beer as some have said. This is a delicious hybrid by a brewery that isn't afraid to break the rules."

"Interesting take on the IPA, but I think the grape must turned it into a fruit beer. All traces of the backing IPA are killed by the grape. Doesn't taste bad though."
"Overall: I never would have thought to make a hopped wine spritzer, but overall it was pretty nice. Not sure I’d drink a whole keg of it, but I’ll finish what I bought."
""
"Well, at least the beer looks nice. Amber with a touch of ruby-red, the brew is unlike any IPA I've seen. But that's about the only compliment I can offer. The hop-forward bouquet starts with floral, vinous tones, but there's a sour, musty backdrop, presumably from the added grapes. The palate follows the nose, which a punchy, hop astringency quickly suffocated by an acidic, sour-grape sweetness. Notes of caramelly malts try to balance things out, but the grape-hop combination is completely disjointed and off-putting. The finish reminds of wine that's been left out for a couple of days.

"O- I really liked this experimental IPA from Dogfish Head. It combines two of my favorite things in the world and does it well. I was expecting the IPA to overpower any grape characteristics but it was the other way around and the syrah fruit won out! I wasn't going to try this until I saw the dissonance in the Bros between the BAs reviews and I am glad I did. Cheers."

"O - DFH has been a favorite brewery of mine as far as I can remember. I was expecting another high quality release with this beer, but I was really disappointed. My expectations for DFH are pretty high, and they rarely disappoint, but this beer doesn't live up to quality and taste of some of their better known brews like 90 Minute and Burton Baton. Still a DFH brew nonetheless, so it still a good beer, just one I'd expect from a less prestigious brewery."

"O: This offering is proof positive that gimmicky and innovative are two entirely different beasts altogether - and this is most certainly the former. It's basically 60 Minute crossed with a crappy wine. C'mon, Dogfish Head, less gimmicky nonsense and more quality offerings!"

"Pours a sparkling, decent head that quickly fizzles. Appears like a dark rosé in the glass. Definitely a good grape nose, with some pine and slight hops in the background. Taste is prominently from the Syrrah grapes, though again, a bit of pine and citrus even it out. Overall an interesting beer...don't know if I'd buy a whole 4-pack of it, but if I saw it again, especially in the warmer months, I'd give it another go."
"Overall: Average beer overall. I was excited to try this one, but it didn't really work for me. It's worth a shot, but I wouldn't really seek this one out again."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a half finger odd-tinted off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of grape juice and sweet light biscuit malt, slightly musty. Flavor starts with biscuit malt and grassy hops, then slightly oaky, dry red wine becomes dominant; finishes dry and tannic. Medium bodied. An interesting experimental hybrid, but the fresh hops that make 60 minute great are muted by the vinous flavors and the finish is too dry and earthy for a ale for my taste. When I drink wine, I prefer dry, oaky reds, but this combination just doesn't work for me. I'd rather have the individual components. Kudos to Dogfish for an intriguing try, but didn't work for me."
"Overall, I don't like this. I don't find any of the flavors to be offensive, but it really comes off as a wine cooler with hops to me."
"O - Need to go back to the drawing board. Very disappointed that this wasn't better. I will still support DFH through and through!"

"(O)- An interesting take on their classic 60 minute. I appreciate the effort, but if I want an IPA, I would much rather have the regular over this. There is just not a ton going on and the wine masks everything I like about an IPA. This would be much better suited to be put under the Fruit/Vegetable beer section than IPA."
""

"OVERALL: For a fruit beer, this is pretty good. By no means is this an IPA. It's more like a bittered wine cooler."

"A very reddish, amber beer with a medium-sized head. The aroma is very wine-like...grape skins, wine tannins, backed by herbal, earthy hops. Not much malt in the smell. The taste is semi-dry, with some grain character....notable fruit...grape and apple....yeast and some tartness. The finish is lingering and more bitter than I anticipated. Nice and here sting beer."
""
"O: Not very good, which I suppose was to be expected as I am not a huge fan of noble rot."
""
"Pours a red/ purple color with a thin white head. Smells bad, musty, no hops. Taste is just awful. I get no hop tastes, just cheap wine then bitterness. Tastes like some sort of sparkling wine than went terribly bad. If you poured this into my glass and didn't tell me what it was, I would think it's the worst glass of wine I have ever had. In reality, it's the worst glass of beer I have ever had."
""
""
"This could have been an awful mess, but it came out very drinkable and light. Nice IPA attributes with a kick of experiment. It's definitely an experimental brew, but it was fun to try once. Recommended as a single @ $2.50/12oz"
""
""
""
"Eh. Could have been much better. After all, Midas Touch uses grape doesn't it and that beer is a lot more drinkable than this. I see an attempt to cross beer and wine here and it doesn't work for me."
"O: i enjoyed this beer, i was fairly surprised because im more of a stout porter guy so for an ipa i was pretty impressed, i kno its not a ""true"" ipa but earlier in the day i tried a tordepo and i think after drinking this brew i could ease my way into the ipa field."
""
"O: Not a bad offering by Sam and the crew down at Dogfish, but I'm a little surprised that this beer is coming into Dogfish Head's core offerings. As out of the ordinary as this beer is, I would expect it to be a seasonal. With the right pairing, I could see this being very nice for the summer."
"Overall this is terrible. I have three more of these and I don't really want to drink it."
""
"O: Not too sure about this one. Would not recommend to an IPA drinker or one that prefers fruity ales. Tastes like a grape flavored wine cooler (never actually had one but if had to guess). Would much rather have an 90 minute aged in a red wine barrell."
"This fits in the long line of ""I applaud DFH for what they try, but I don't want to drink more than one of them."" I hope they keep this up, but I won't be buying this again."

"Overall - Good fusion. Strange brew to concoct but DFH makes it work. Appreciated this brew more the second time around."

"O: This, in no way, resembles an IPA. I quite enjoy other beers that some would say don't taste like beer (New Glarus fruited beers, some lambics), but this is not those. Not an entirely objectionable liquid to drink, but not anything I'll be drinking again."
""
""
"Taste-Dry, tangy, watery grape juice with a dose of hops thrown in. What is ""grape must"" anyway? This brew is refreshing in a Berliner-weisse sort-of-way, but the ABV is too high for that style. ""American IPA""? I dunno.. Another crazy concoction from Sam. I give the man all due respect for his fearless brewing style."
""

"O: Interesting twist on the 60 minute IPA - I like the wine-like addition."

"The mouthfeel was medium in body with zesty carbonation."
"I had to have 3 of these to really get the hang of it. Initial feelings were negative on the first two, but I decided to wait a couple weeks and have this beer solo to really kind of see how I felt about it. It isn't bad but it isn't something I would really seek out. It is interesting and unique."

"Pours a clear cranberry juice red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some subdued grape and wine aromas. Taste is much the same with hop and slightly funky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with an interesting concept but the interaction between the beer and grape must in this one is a bit odd in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mildly cloudy red/purple hue with a short white head. Smooth hop character, zinfandel, pale malts and a slight sour mash in the aroma. Much like the aroma itself, the first sip is a delicious combination of soft red sparkling wine and balanced hops. Grapes, cherries, vanilla, and malted barley are all easily recognized components that follow the first taste. Dry, floral, crisp overall mouthfeel and finish."
""
"Overall, this was one unique beer, from the appearance to the taste. It's worth a try, but maybe just one try."
""
"I was pleasently surprised with this beer. I read some of the reviews and was expected not to enjoy this one especially since I'm not much of a wine guy. The aroma is a bit too musty for me and the hops that you would normally enjoy from a 60 min. are masked with a crisp wine flavor. The result is very refreshing. I really enjoyed the beer and would really welcome these on hot summer evenings."
"Pours a clear purple amber color with a good sized white head that persists for a bit. Smells of bready caramel malt with a solid shot of earthy pine and citrus hops. Grape vinous aromas round out the nose. Tastes like a vinous ipa. Grape and bread with caramel fight each other to be the dominant flavor while earthy spicy pine muddies up the flavor profile. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet vinous resiny mouthfeel. Certainly different and a bit interesting, but it my feeling that the flavors don't mesh very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks exactly like you'd think - tan/brown with just a hint of pink to it. The smell is almost sweet, like a wine cooler. But then you take a sip, and the hops are right there, but mellowed out by a clear taste of wine. Very interesting beer and I would definitely purchase again. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another interesting one from DFH. It's almost like the hops and grape must are battling each other, rather than working together to enhance the overall flavor. Not a homerun by any means, but still a tasty brew."
""
""
""
"D- Tough to judge without a frame of reference, as this was my first beer/wine hybrid, but I hope it's not my last. Very refreshing, and somehow lighter than the sum of its parts. Highly enjoyable, and far more efficient than drinking beer and wine separately. If Sam Calagione can somehow work Scotch into this thing, I can quit wasting my time drinking anything else."

"Pours a nicely pink hued copper with a slim sheet of light pink foam. Smells juicy out the gate with grapes, and I have to admit that the grapes carry that dirty, inky depth of Syrah grapes. Also some bits of resin, but mostly dominated by the grape character. Standard sweet english malt dominance in the DFH beers, some bitterness, a bit of blueberry and musty earth. Medium bodied with light carb and a semi dry finish. Interesting beer, I'm really left unmoved, but wouldn't shy somebody away from the beer."
""
"Overall I am starting to think that not only do I hate wine but grape based beers seem to not work for me either. Not a bad beer/wine hybrid certainly the most drinkable one I ever had."
"The beer pours a pale pinkish red, much like a rosé wine, and it pours with a very fizzy, eggshell white head, much like a frizzante wine. The head quickly peels away to leave a light scrim, but that scrim is constantly punctured by a rapid torrent of carbonated bubbles working their way to the top of the glass. In body, the beer is nicely clean and clear, appearing much like a rosé wine. On the nose, the beer smells spicy and bready with sweet, jam-like fruit notes also coming through. Oddly enough, the nose actually reminds me of a softer smelling Soft Parade by Shorts Brewing Company. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet, then lightly acidic, and then nicely bitter at the end. The flavors begin as sweet, and almost sour, generic berry flavor with a touch of earthy spice, which slowly moves into a tongue tingling bitter that mellows over the tongue and gives some nice grassy notes of flavoring. The finish is nearly pure IPA with just light touches of fruity berries, and the aftertaste is just bitter medicinal hops in the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a tongue tingling carbonation that helps to scrub back some of the Syrah’s sweeter notes, and which helps to pave the way for the hops bitter back end of the flavor. The mouth is left surprisingly dry, though there is a slight syrupy feel at the middle of the tongue. Overall, this beer is an interesting step in the ongoing experimentation with beer-wine hybrids. It sweet up front, and bitter in the back, but it doesn’t quite give the Syrah flavors that I was hoping for, and honestly, I was kind of hoping for some tannic bitter on the back of the tongue. I think a tempranillo grape, with its big earthy and spicy notes would be a better match for an IPA, which has me hoping that DFH will maybe do a series of this beer with different grapes. In the end, this is an interesting beer, but not Dogfish Heads best."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is an amber-tinted copper coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy white surface coating. Literally looks like 60 Minute with a drop of red coloring in it. Aromas of subtle grape sweetness and tang, with a solid biscuit backbone and hints of hops at the end. Flavors of tangy sweet, wine-like characters initially. Almost like a muscato or even wine spritzer, where it has hints of dryness and terroir, but the sweetness is amplified. Solid, balanced backbone of hops bitterness and biscuit, both toasty and bready. Very balanced and dynamic brew. The beer has a dry sweetness in the aftertaste, with a slick, dry finish. Light, smooth bodied in mouth. If you didn't know from the packaging, you wouldn't relate this to the 60 Minute IPA at all. It is a stand alone brew, and deservingly so. Very unique, tasty brew."
""
"O: I feel like it was a good idea but could've been executed way better. The hop flavor, whether it be lacking the correct hops, or getting outshined by grapes was not what I was looking for. A nice citrus and fruity hop profile would've made this one much better."

"Intrigued by the label and pitch from a coworker made this my Friday after work beer of choice (which on principal should be stellar on principle alone.) Poured in a plum like color which initially caught me off guard but the aroma was bright and floral my initial comparison was that of my girls White Zin. That proved to be very much the case, crisp and flavorful with a very subtle hop. Honestly, not what I was looking for but a nice summer ale nonetheless. If your into White Zin than definitely try this beer."

"Pours a clear orange tinted pink with one finger thick white head... spotty lacing though a decent layer of foam sticks around. Smell: caramel, diactyl, berry, vinous of course..no discernible hop aromas, whee! Taste: the base beer at least makes some appearance here, but it's muddled and... it could be anything buried beneath the buttered toast and watery, sweet, fruity wine...what a mess. Should have been a drainpour. Bottled late Feb."
""
""
"Seemed like a cool concept, but of course not. DFH being abstract with seemingly no attention to creating a fine product. Seems like a real stark contrast to what i remember from 8-9 years ago. The syrah must imparts a pinkish hue to this IPA - the hop profile is weird, the wine isn't showcased the weigh it should be. It was fine, but just not what i was hoping for."
""
""
"Once poured, has a dark plum color to it. The head was rather strange, white about 1 finger in thickness. Almost looked like an effervescent. Not too strong of a hoppy aroma, but you can definitely smell the hops from the ""60"" and the Syrah wine. Had a light refreshing mouthfeel. Tastes the hops at the very end, Syrah hits you a little after. Not bad, been wanting to try it."
""
""
"O: A white Zinfandel mimic with a dash of hops. This is probably my favorite fruit beer so far and I would recommend it for sure. I love how DFH changes stuff up and gets creative. As far as I'm concerned this is a success. Cheers!"
""
"The medium body offers good support combined with a steady carbonation. It's surprisingly creamy off a big, well-sustained crispness, and it flows very nicely. It's definitely smooth drinking all around."
""
""
"O: Like a lot of DFH's beers, this one is an experiment. This one doesn't quite work. It has its good points, but it's not something I'd readily come back to."

"Overall - Off flavor ruins it and the grapes really add nothing interesting to Dogfish's base IPA."

"Pours into a standard pint glass a deep reddish pink with a light pink colored head atop,I was really suprised at the pour it looked almost like som framboise beers,pretty cool for an IPA.Aromas are fruity and musty,lightly citric hops with a bit of lightly toasted bread to go along with the grape must,very interesting but not something I loved.Flavors are on the dryer side up front with some resiny but not in your face hops,some mild sweetness follows with a more rich tasting wine grape flavor in the finish.Hmm interesting and not bad but after half a bottle it started to get to me a little."
"Wow... what a suprise. I was doubting even buying it. Pink beer with wine. What a horrible idea. First off this is more on the IPA side. lots of citrus smell and big hop flavor presence. It pours red like I heard which can throw you off but its drinks like an IPA with a little berry background flavor. no sweetness added with the wine juice. pleasantly suprised and this would be a great pairing beer. I happen to have a gourmet hamburger and it was nice."
"Taste is a brilliant blend of sour fruit (the Syrah grape must) and some crisp citrus hoppiness. Very tasty, refreshing, and certainly not a taste I've experienced before in my 1200+ beer-ticking career! Another fruit beer that does not suck!"
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate retention on a copper body with some hues of purple. Some sticky lacing. Aroma includes some pungent hop bitterness married with some grapey sweetish tartness. Interesting. Taste is sort of as expected. The hop bitterness is slightly muted by the addition of the grape and the tart/sweet flavor isn't overbearing. Nicely carbonated and cleansing on the tongue. Very approachable beer for IPA drinkers and non ipa drinkers alike. Unique, interesting and tasty."
"O: Interesting. It's versatile, and plenty of possibilities exist as far as cooking/pairing applications. As far as the wine/beer hybrids go I enjoyed Noble Rot more, but this isn't bad stuff either. In the end I think it leans a little harder to the wine side than Noble Rot did, and would do more to ""convert"" wine drinkers but have limited appeal to hardcore beer buffs."
"This is a very interesting, and typically ambitious, beer by DFH. I like it a lot, but it could do without the buttery element and some more hop aroma, perhaps a touch less grape. Overall, worth trying."
""
"Not bad at all. It's way better than I thought it was going to be. It's actually pretty good. This has DFH written all over it. This is an attempt I can appreciate and they might actually be on to something with this. I just wish the hops were more vibrant. I would drink again."

"Very winelike in some aspects, but retains the hop character if a beer. Reminiscent of a dry champagne, really. Interesting, but not really my cup of tea."
"Overall not bad, a really unique beer, nothing like 60 min IPA, hops get a bit strange with the green earthy and herbal flavors, and the grape skin and vinous must are interesting touches, and the acid bite was unexpected but not really a turn off. Still it doesn't knock it out of the park, but something unique to try."
"This is a very unusual beer, where the wine masks the 60 Minute notes quite a bit. An interesting beer, but not for everyone and not a favorite of mine. Cool to see crazy combos still coming out of Dogfish Head though."

"Pours cranberry red, very clear, two finger head with thin white bubbles. Smells of faint hops, some grape, bready,earthy. Taste is also slightly hoppy, almost bitter grape, very dry, bready as well. Overall this is very unique, not very hoppy, pretty easy drinking, and a nice new take on their IPA. I can only imagine how amazing this beer would be if it aged to a sour"

" the flavor is not heavily grape influenced, yet it does have a slightly spicy vinous element with more tangy and bitter contrast and dry herbal notes with a citrus flavor from the hops with light tangelo and mild grape skin recurring the flavor with light orange hop taste. There is a residual bitter pine hop flavor which seems to accentuate the mild red grape aspect. Overall I like it -it doesn't have a lot in common with 60 minute, but I think that is the point a new twist which works well adds a bit of fruitiness the yeast and hops might not give otherwise with mix of grape must adding dry texture and makes for a very drinkable ale."
""
""
""
""
"O - I probably wouldn't have recognized this as a take on an IPA had I not already known. I think the grape works very well with the hoppy base beer, adding a fruity and tart character. My fear was that this beer would be cloying, but I found the grape flavors to be held in check by the hops. It is actually quite drinkable and refreshing. It was more expensive than my go-to beers of similar ABV, despite only coming in a 4-pack. It was definitely worth trying, but I won't be rushing out to grab a case of the stuff."
""
"Overall this is a beer that has some good qualities but it doesn't seem like they compliment each other and they are fighting for the palate, with the hops winning, and the tannic sour grape distracting. It's not horrible but it wont be a beer I'll be having again I think. Ironically the thing that makes the beer a bit of a problem is it's too hoppy (which must beer dorks I am sure would be happy about), that doesn't compliment the other ingredients. Maybe a touch of crazy odd sweetness in here would really make it impressive."

"Poured from tap into pint at lokal Miami. Pours a grapey purple color with a finger of white foam. Nice hop aromas...lots of hops. So far it smells like an ipa. Taste is very hop fw. Nice malt backbone and finishes with a bit of wine grape. It deff works well... a bit acidic finish but i can deal with that. I wish I had a 60 min to compare but its very similar. The grape addition works very well. Nice brew and hopefully it will be in their regular lineup."

"In closure, the beer is a highly refreshing beer that quenches the thirst of any summertime drinker, but as an IPA, the fruit additions interfere with hop crispness and clarity and muddle the taste that is otherwise beloved in the classic IPA taste. Sorry Dogfish Head, but this beer does not expound upon the 60 MInute recipe, but detracts from in slightly. The Aprihop version is much better!"
""
""
"O-as an IPA, this sucks. a strict hop head will hate this and get upset that this is classified as an IPA (it's not one). i'd say this drinks more as a fruity pale ale. it's not a terrible beer, but i'm not sure what the target audience is? most craft drinkers won't like this, but has a certain bitter edge to it that might keep girls and macro drinkers away also. i'm glad i tried it, but the worst IPA from DFH yet."

"D - Another very unique offering from Dogfish Head... At first sip, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it... Still a bit confused by the end, but the subtle nuance in every facet makes this one fun to drink... The wine like qualities are undeniable... It will be fun to share with wine lovers to get their take... Undeniably interesting... Not something that I would drink with regularity, but some I may want to revisit from time to time... Likely would pair well with a wide range of foods... I can recommend to the curious beer drinker..."
"overall: another fine and unusual beer from Dogfish."
"O: This is definitely an interesting beer and as always props to DFH for using unique and non-traditional ingredients as a brewery that has a fairly large distribution for a craft brewery. That begin said some are hits some are misses and although this one is more towards the middle of the spectrum it is more of a miss then a hit for me. The look is really good and the taste and feel are solid, but the smell is one of the worst I have experienced (just unpleasant) and the wine beer mixture that sometimes works for DFH just doesn't work this time as it is just weird."
""
""
""
""
"Thought I'd give this a try. I'm done with it. I have to give DFH credit for being daring and inventive and always looking for new ways to make beer. However, sometimes I think they should spend a little less time brewing new oddball beers and a little more time making their oddball beers taste as good as they possibly can. This might be a really great beverage, but in drinking it I can't help but think it was rushed to market."

"Overall, this beer answers the unasked question -- what happens when you brew grape must with a Pale Ale. You get a watered down red wine. I'm quite confident that a more flavorful IPA would have had different results. Sculpin. Double Jack. Sucks. Any IPA with a lot of flavor would probably fair better being brewed with grape must. If you're looking for a unique, tasty IPA with some unique ingredients added during the brewing then I'd urge folks to look elsewhere. If you have the opportunity to purchase this as a single, then I'd say go for it. Personally, I won't be buying this again, and I'd be a bit surprised if this hits bottles after this initial round."

"This poured out as an impressive looking reddish pink color. The head was a pale pink color as well . There is a pretty good retention on this beer with a light lacing on the glass also. The smell is more like wine than an IPA. The aroma is fruity, plenty of grape but no hops that I can pick up. The taste of the beer is also grape, kind of screams wine cooler to me. There is a bubblegum flavor in the finish with a faint hop bitterness in the far distance. The mouthfeel was drinkable, light bodied and a bit refreshing. Dry finish and decent carbonation. Overall I am glad I tried it, but I never have to drink it again. I really wasn't into the flavors it had. It's an interesting idea, much like all of DfH beers but this one is a miss in my book."
"O/D-60 Minute IPA is probably my favorite DFH brew. I won't lump this one into the rather large category of DFH busts but its close. I copped a single and a 4-pack at about $11 is far too pricey. Worth a try but once will be enough."

"O - Totally different than what I had expected, minimal similarities with the 60 minute. Still, very different, sweet, smooth and incredibly drinkable."
"This is another fun beer beer from DFH."
"O - I can see a lot of people either loving or hating this beer, which is evident by the current 84 rating. I for one am a huge fan of this beer. When its not fresh I can see this being a total mess, but in its month old state it is really nice. Its a fruity take on the standard 60 minute that winds up not being a total gimmick or novelty."
"Another DFH beer/wine hybrid of sorts, I found this one much more enjoyable than the likes of Noble Rot and Red & White. Clear, reddish-amber pour, with a medium-sized white head; moderate retention and lacing. Aroma was a bit muted, toasted grains, light hops and grape skins. Taste of biscuity malts, crisp citrus and herbal hops, and a musty grape presence that was well-balanced with the other flavors, giving a general sweetness to the beer overall. It wasn't mind-blowing, it wasn't necessarily unique, but it was still tasty and well-crafted. Medium body, and decently drinkable."

"O- When I first opened this and was getting a chalky smell I was thinking that I made a bad decision picking up a whole four pack, but I am really enjoying this beer. I could not see me drinking this often, but it will make a nice treat when I am looking for something different."
"O - Overall, this was a pretty fun beer. I'd like to have this on a hot summer day, and a bit colder than I cracked this one at. Very fun IPA."

"O - I love what Dogfish does and how they approach brewing. I love that you never truly know what you are going to get from them with whatever beer they release. Some hit, some miss and this one definitely misses for me. I didn't pick up any flavor from it, tasted very bland with very little hoppiness to it. Sam Adams Boston Lager was the first thing to come to mind after drinking which was very disappointing. I can't see myself buying this again."

"The bitterness isn't that much so you can drink a lot!"

"O: This is a worthy play on your everyday 60 minute. My expectations were something too sweet, too fruity or just too weird to be taken seriously but this beer delivered. They took a great beer, added a small twist and came out with something fresh and enjoyable. I'll be looking for this one again!"

"This won't evict the 90min IPA from its reserved section of of the beer fridge, but I can definitely see having this on hand most of the time."
"Beer is medium in body, pretty sweet, interesting, mildly bitter, not my favorite but drinkable and nice. Probably not a repeat though."

"Went down right away to taste this new offering, but was highly disappointed. I was expecting a sweeter 60 minute IPA but was greeted with a pinkish reddish beer that smelled way too sweet. The taste was that of a sparkling rose wine. I could barley finish my mug. It is not Noble Rot or Red and White. It is a bitter sparkling red wine at best. Not something I would want year round or as a limited release."
