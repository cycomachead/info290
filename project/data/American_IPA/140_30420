Initially sweet & malt forward with a little bitterness at the end. If there were any criticism it would be that this could be a little too sweet. But overall solid and a go to IPA. Easy to drink. I give Sierra Nevada credit for having their own style and not just following the trend of overly bitter and unbalanced IPA's.","oregonduck","Apr 04, 2015"

It pours a deep amber with soapy head and resilient lacing. The aroma is that familiar hallmark of American West Coast IPAs: fresh Magnum bittering hops with their pungent citrus, juniper, and grassy notes and typical floral charm. Take a sip and the smokey-sweet malt coats your mouth while the Citra hops - the sour diesel of hops - settle on your breath for the long haul. The balance is perfect. To me this is one of the best strong IPAs by one of the best - one of the pioneers - of the American pale ale genre.","mdexter","Mar 03, 2015"

Excellent head retention, and a smaller film will remain until the beer is finished. Floral aromas of citrus, pine and hops right off the bat. Some semblance of grapefruit and lemon, among other citrus fruits. Tastes much more bitter than nose suggests, with more emphasis on the pine. Grapefruit notes become stronger throughout aftertaste. Somewhat drying feel. Mouthfeel indicates strong carbonation and a slick, viscous sliding over tongue. A sip seems to expand in my mouth, leaving a smooth residue that lingers for several minutes. Overall, this is a beautifully made IPA that will satisfy any hophead. This is a very sessionable hop explosion and goes down a little too easy; try to not let these get you in trouble. I am surprised how often I find these available for about a dollar per beer, even in Western Montana. When I do, I buy them in bulk and fill my closet. I know with their high hop and alcohol content, they won't lose much fidelity after their supposed expiration date.","sporklift87","Feb 28, 2015"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pineapple, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"

4.53,8.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Holy carbonation batman!! This one had me slurping the top of the IPA glass to prevent a waterfall of suds. What a pretty looking beer though. The chilled auburn appearance is graced with a massive cream colored crown of epic proportions. So fluffy and rich, like a giant dollop of whipped cream. Incredible lacing remains as the head recedes. As if it were perfectly etched in to the glass itself. This is easily one of the most picturesque beers I've ever seen. The aroma is a big, bold bouquet of hops. Complex and aromatic. Perfume-like. Elements of grapefruit citrus, lemon zest and spicy floral scents dominate.  Malty bread notes punch through a little too. So fresh and vibrant! The taste brings a delicious blend of caramel sweetness and puckering hop bitterness. Amazingly, the malts hold their own here, striking a very improbable balance. Wow, simply delectable. It's quite a feat to pack in so much complex hop character and still have the backbone to bring it full circle. The mouthfeel is smooth, robust and full. Juicy, yet creamy and soft. An incredibly rich texture. To me, this beer stands tall on the sheer impact of the whole cone hop potency and remarkably sturdy malt base. The feat of balance is commendable, given the mega-hopped nature of the brew. It is certainly worthy of the name ""Torpedo"" because it is an unmistakable West Coast hop bomb. However, the stealth and sturdiness of the malts are equally fitting for this explosive namesake. World class all the way.","JohnnyI","Feb 10, 2015"

Overall it's a nice beer, but far from the massive hop ratings it has noted below.  I think it's a nice common IPA, not ""Extra IPA"".  The defining characteristic for me is a grape-like presence in the taste.  I don't get a lot of citrus/piney-ness that I like in big IPAs.  Lacks much malt.  It's more enjoyable in the 16 oz can.  I do enjoy the bitterness and spicy-ness.","aderousseau","Jan 03, 2015"

Stands to reason that it is their baby after all. This beer is rounded , boisterous and punchy with great hops flavour it is refreshing and confident. This is a great example of the style. Be sure to serve in a Tulip/Thistle to trap and enjoy those aromas and flavour.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Nov 15, 2014"

The taste is reminiscent to the pale ale but much more complex. It has a almost sweet quality close to that of a pineapple but not quite, a lot of other flavors that I can't quite pinpoint.The after taste is almost too bitter and seems almost unbalanced because of the almost nonexistent malt. But it keeps you coming back for more. Oh yeah P.S. This is not a casual drinkers beer.","CTIMAI","Oct 23, 2014"

Maybe this one works a lot better than British imitations because the hops are balanced out by robust use of malt (which boosts the alcohol content).

The taste begins with caramel malts, turning piney in the middle and finishing dry and bitter with a resiny and slightly citrusy aftertaste that lasts long in the back of the mouth. Very balanced taste. The taste becomes sweeter as the beer warms up in the glass. Medium body and carbonation, oily mouthfeel. I was expecting a fresher taste, but I think that it's a bit past its prime. Still a fine beer, flavorful and balanced.","JTuomi","Aug 06, 2014"

I normally don't mind aggressive IPAs, but this one just takes that direction using a taste that doesn't please my palette as much as it's imperial version does, for example. Too much sharp citric acid bite overtaking even the pine, and the sweet malts seem to remain far apart from that. Curious. I will revisit this down the road nonetheless. I certainly love Hoptimum. I would expect to feel similar toward this. Different acetaldehyde factor between the two, for certain. Interesting.","TBoneJones","Jul 20, 2014"

I wouldn't recommend this beer on a hot day or during a bbq on the porch or poolside, but if you're looking to relax in front of the tube or while pouring over whatever texts you prefer, then you may be in for a nice little treat!","ASirahSyrah","Jul 13, 2014"

It is an exceptional single IPA that's only knock for me is that it is a bit too piney form my tastes, but that is in keeping with West Coast IPAs. I like how this beer comes in a variety of packaging and is found in most bottle shops at a very reasonable price for what you're getting.","PaulyB83","Jun 30, 2014"

There's also a definite citrus presence that makes it's presence known in the back of the palate and the fade with a slight burning sensation on the tongue due to the bitterness.

The nose is a light blend of citrus and pine hops over a caramel background. Medium bodied with an average carbonation level resulting in a light effervescence on the finish. Fairly well balanced and complex, it begins with mostly pine hop flavor. A significant pine and grapefruit rind bitterness appears next then slowly flows into a light caramel sweetness. The finish is mostly just a lingering rind flavored bitterness.","tillmac62","May 09, 2014"

I can't explain how the entire experience of ordering a Torpedo and drinking it is so complete. Adjectives disappear. I become one with the total experience. If it's not the perfect beer for me, it's as near perfect as I have ever found. I have tried to describe the experience to friends and family, but lately, I don't even care if no one else likes it. I'm totally selfish about it. I'm hoping Torpedo is served in the afterlife. Otherwise I may never check out. Well done Sierra Nevada!!

Nice, rich, hoppy taste. Rich citrus notes. Definitely hop forward but a nice biscuity malt on the backend to balance it all out. Mouthfeel was slightly carbonated but at the same time was rich and coated the mouth with the beer's essence. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Sierra Nevada was my first intro into IPA's way back when, and this beer is definitely one of their best.","tbraun1","Apr 27, 2014"

This bottle is 8 months old and still drinking nicely, so I hope to procure a fresher sample at some point - I have a feeling this stuff would be stellar without the age.

Beautiful amber color, floral hoppy aroma, a mild front taste, but a very full citrusy spicy hoppy backside. It lingers to inform you as to when the best time to take the next sip is. West Coast, it is unmatched. But, journeying to the far reaches of the piney woods marsh, Dogfish Head, I must admit, does even better. For the price, for the abc, for the ipa essence, this is the best beer you can buy at the convenience or grocery store.","greentam2","Mar 28, 2014"

Initial taste is mildly acidic, quickly becomes smoother and the malt opens up on your palette, blending with the citrus. Has an average thickness for an IPA and leaves a pleasantly hoppy aftertaste. A good blend of traditional English IPA while having enough of a unique taste to set it apart from the others and avoid being boring. Did not expect this much quality from this beer, I've been missing out.","Gozillasnack","Mar 28, 2014"

Poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. Packaged 8/1. Nice and fresh. @ fingers of white head on top of a nice, hazy copper brew. Orange and lemon on the nose, a bit of the resiny, piny note, and the nice characteristic SN fresh smell. Nice pine on the tastebuds, good balanced bitterness overall. Medium body, nice carbonation throughout enjoying the glass, and a nice clean aftertaste. Overall, this is a truly solid IPA. It will definitely find its way back to my fridge.","Mikus","Mar 23, 2014"

Hops are around, but in the leading rolls I was expecting, but still imparting their fruity zest. Honestly this reminds me of Nugget Nectar a lot. Just because it wasn’t what I anticipated doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy. I would scoop this if you like an IPA with solid malt structure.","ZagZagg","Feb 24, 2014"

Very earthy hops flavor with the perfect carbonation. This one was a gem in my book. Very comparable to their Celabration ale for 2013, but more hoppy. This beer will find its way to me again since I only got to enjoy half of a bottle. My 2 year old son felt the need to dip his stuffed crocodile's snout into my spiderman glass until it saturated like a sponge. After which the crocodile thanked my son repeatedly for allowing him to soak up such delicious nectar. I was not as happy as the croc since I did not know where the croc's mouth has been.","tallerich","Feb 07, 2014"

Lots of pine and citrus even a little grass. From the smell this almost seems like a double more than just a standard ipa. The flavor follows suit with a ton of pine upfront (almost gin like) followed by a lasting citrus flavor. Not alot of malt in this one but still very well balanced and enjoyable. This is definitely and ipa that you could sit and drink a number of and not get tired of. Excellent work sierra nevada.","lochef81","Feb 03, 2014"

4.75,14.2,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"This is the best beer for the buck. Beautiful amber color, great head retention. Nice sticky lacing. Smell is outstanding. Almost instantaneously I get a kick in the face of hop aroma ask I crack the bottle open. I get pine, citrus, flowers,- a field of hops in my nose. I can also smell malt, I dont know how they accomplished that, but its there and its great. Mouthfeel is great, not too thin, not too thick, although for the ABV I would almost expect it to be thicker. Everything about this beer is awesome, its easy drinking, alcohol is non existent in the taste. Its well balanced for an ""extra"" IPA, the malt really shines and I love that about it. Sierra Nevada out did themselves with this one. My go-to brew for sure. I love this beer.","Jay_Ulreich","Jan 16, 2014"

In search of Celebration, I came up empty initially, but found this fine entry. Torpedo, for being so solid, is surprisingly affordable, making it a great option for the every day quaff. But just because this beer is relatively cheap doesn't make it any less impressive. It is a very well crafted beer.","Tsar_Riga","Jan 06, 2014"

Lots of hops on the nose, with some caramel and biscuit malt buried in the mix. This particular bottle isn't as fresh as I'd like; it's wasted away in my fridge for some weeks now, and spent God knows how long on the retail shelves before then. So perhaps the hops aren't quite as bright and alive as I recall from this brew in the past. Pine and citrus hops open the sip, followed by balancing malts and a resiny, bitter aftertaste. Drinks smooth. A tasty, reliable beer and a standard of the style, but nothing out of this world.","xabyss","Dec 31, 2013"

4.72,13.5,4.75,4,5,4.75,5,"I had this poured from a bottle into a Tulip. Appearance is without flaw. Just a sexy looking brew that might remind you of a Canadian whiskey, if not for the wonderfully full head which sticks around and heavily laces throughout the experience. To the nose there is an enormous bouquet of floral hops. I definitely picked up some pine, biscuits and yes...I even got some Violet. As for the mouthfeel....well I've rarely experienced an IPA with THIS pleasant of a mouth-feel. In the mouth it is very very crisp but not unpleasant, actually it's as if your palate is being cleansed for the ""fireworks"". The taste is in fact the fireworks. My God! I can't say enough about how this beer has exceeded my expectations. Up front there is an amazing flow of hops, pine, biscuits and yes some violet. The beer finishes with something you'd think might keep the bitterness on you but in-fact it just teases you with more of a rustic pine...but a different ""pine"" than you'd think. This is the epitome of a FINE BOLD IPA. Yes, this is a very bold brew but one the ""newbie"" should be interested in and one where the ""seasoned"" enthusiast should be ecstatic about. AMAZING!","Khad","Nov 28, 2013"

This is an IPA that is focused on maybe one or two hops and the folks at Sierra Nevada have done an excellent job of melding everything together into one delicious brew. Kudos to them.","BeerDocT","Nov 27, 2013"

This beer is a daily drinker and easy to down more than just a couple. I hope I can find it on tap here in clearwater fla given that I prefer my beers out of kegs.

Excellent carbonation out of the bottle - just right on the palate. Unlike some of the other reviews, I did not detect any lingering stickiness. But enough about that - drink this because of the explosive bold strong taste, complex hoppiness, lingering citrus bitterness and piney notes in the back.

This one is no exception, but it does have extremely lingering astringent hop bitterness. This property paired very well with my spicy chili, and I imagine it would also go well with fatty foods such as some pork belly or cheese, etc. Now that I'm drinking it on it's own, though, it's a bit much. I'm going to go see if I have any cheese in the fridge...","redearth329","Oct 16, 2013"

I think some who will try this ""extra IPA"" will be disappointed because of the balance--they are looking for a very dry and bitter beer with a lot of bite, and this won't deliver. But this is a great IPA because of the complexity of the hops, which leave a somewhat sweet floral and pine taste. No, the ABV isn't very high and the bitterness isn't either, but it's a nice, powerful beer that isn't lopsided. This beer showcases the hops without burning the palate with unchecked hops. The pour is great--a good sized head with very nice retention. I liked the nose for its floral and citrus aromas, which were also present in the taste. And the mouthfeel is spot on--not too bitter, and a thickness and carbonation that are good. Overall, I feel fortunate to find such a high quality beer at a reasonable price. It won't please the IPA fans looking for the boldest, hoppiest brew, but it is likely to satisfy those who recognize that an IPA isn't just about how many hops you can throw in there--it's about complexity, balance, and nuance.","DeFaz","Oct 01, 2013"

It's not what I would consider an ""Extra IPA"" as listed on the label. Sierra Nevada's website goes into detail describing the ""hop torpedo"" they developed to infuse hop flavor into this beer. Back to the drawing board SN, the hop flavor and aroma in this beer are pretty subdued. It doesn't have any of the bite, or the citrus/pine elements that are found in other IPA's. That said, it's very drinkable and for $13 per 12 pack at TWM, it's a good deal for a craft beer, but if you are looking for an IPA to knock your socks off, you are going to have to spend a bit more.","joeworrall","Sep 20, 2013"

They come to the fire and stay through the finish. Abv is relatively high but doesn't influence the taste. May be a bit hoppy for some, but you wanted an IPA so what do you expect?

I'd describe it as very nicely balanced, although yes, there is a hop-forward quality to it. But the hints of pineapple, orange, and apricot tend to moderate what would otherwise be a somewhat aggressive hoppiness. The overall experience is very pleasant, making Torpedo a delightful kaleidoscope of flavors. The first time I had it, I was wowed - and still am.","Isoruku","Aug 21, 2013"

Not sure how long this is going to stay here, but SN 12-packs cost less per bottle, right now, than full cases of Sam Adams, Harpoon and Smuttynose, which are all local (and this one is clearly better than Harpoon IPA, but not in the same league as DIPAs). The high ABV and high bitterness make it an easy one-and-done selection (no session beer this is). But that is really all I can say about it. In a way, it mirrors my reflections on the basic SNPA which I've always found competent but boring. Torpedo is definitely not boring, but it's not a top contender either.","VictorWisc","Jul 13, 2013"

It is very smooth, mildly bitter and a sweet undertones, citrus fruit zest are present, earthy flavors due come through, this is all I can detect, this is a nice IPA overall.

The malt is bread, caramel and honey. Little soap on the nose. Very floral with a touch of yeast . Malt is pretty sweet. On the palate it greets with malt first, then a quick piney bitter then lots of perfumey floral hops. The alcohol is just a bit on the palate. A small bite from carbonation to finish it off dry and a little toasted, sticky and some resin too. I wanted to like this more than I did. It became heavy after a while and hard to drink from the oily bitter on the back palate. The hop perfume translated into the drink astringent and I didn’t care for it. Felt out of balance and like it could have used a touch more malt depth, the sweetness wasn’t full it was kind of sugary. The bitterness was sharp. Decent but I liked the SNPA better.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Just damn perfect. All other ipa should bow to this beast. Pairs well with uhhm...breathing. Mouthfeel is full and creamy like it should be. Nose is like walking through a Christmas tree forest.

This stuff would be a lot better fresh, which is hard to do because it's a staple beer at every gas station and grocery store. When it's always on the shelves and so little people drink it, it's hard to find fresh.

4.18,0.5,4.25,3,5,3,4.5,"O: Nice dark amber color is very attractive but an average scent is a bit disappointing. Smell of pine and citrus with a bit of pear is nice but not nearly hoppy enough for an IPA. Redeems itself greatly in the taste department. Wow! Piney and citrusy with the pear underlay is amazing. More hops than you would expect based on the scent, but very hop forward with a nice smooth toasty malt finish and a bite. This amazing taste outweighs the disappointing scent and average body. Great IPA! Would recommend to anyone.","jschwanke84","Apr 26, 2013"

4.55,9.4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle to a tulip glass on 4/14/13. The color of this beer is a deep orange to amber, like thick pine sap. It is quite lively in the glass with lots of carbonation evident. The light penetration is pretty good; no haze or sediment evident. There is a thick 2cm of sandy white colored head to the top of the glass, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is pretty thick throughout the glass. The smell is almost exclusively hops. The malt is muted and maybe lends a caramel sweetness. The hops, like in most good IPAs, takes the front row in this show. The most dominant note at first if the piney and resinous prototypical smell of a good northwestern IPA. Then there is the sweet tropical fruit that is muted at first, but blossoms throughout the glass as it warms a little. There is lots of juicy oranges and nectarines especially as you continue to smell it. The taste is definitely showcasing the hops for sure. The pine is there up front, but then the citrus takes the bulk of the flavor. The juicy oranges and nectarines are there still and are the star of this show. There is a good, strong bittering backbone that plays balance to the muted caramel malts. The caramel malts are sweet, but I would like a little more to handle the hops. The mouthfeel is very dry, very bitter, and has a good body. Overall, this is an excellent beer and an excellent example of the style of an American IPA.","estlinska","Apr 14, 2013"

The aftertaste is pleasant but not overly long lasting, somewhat sticky and resinous with decent carbonation going on. Overall there a solid drinkability factor going for Torpedo that eludes the $3 price tag and tops a number of $4-$6 bombers I have tried. Put this one on your list, as Sierra Nevada proves that a quality IPA doesn't have to empty your wallet to be enjoyable.

3.94,-5.3,3.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smell is mostly of pine and citrus, your usual West Coast IPA flavors. Taste is mostly of pine as well with a good amount of bitterness that lingers for a while. A bit underwhelming when it comes to flavor though. I wish there were more citrus and floral notes in there, but the flavor seems to pass pretty quickly. Mouth is smooth, maybe a bit too heavy, but with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good IPA, but nowhere near the best I've had. I've always been slightly disappointed with Sierra Nevada's offerings, and this isn't an exception. I always find myself comparing different IPAs to Stone's and this is one that just doesn't come close. The balance seems slightly off compared to other IPAs I've tried, most notably Green Flash Imperial IPA, Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, and of course Stone IPA.","MisSigsFan","Mar 22, 2013"

The torpedo is well balanced, brewed with delicious hops, and is available at an affordable price. Citra Hops are the best. The balance between the bittering hops and tasty subtle citra flavors make this IPA almost perfect. Against any other mass produced IPA the Torpedo towers over all.

While this description does not sound like a delicious IPA, it is in fact very tasty, slightly challenging, and one of my regular house brews. It's not wimpy, overly off with melon or chalk bitterness, but also not as piney or grapefruit as many (flavors I like). Still, for the price and regular availability, this is a solid and satisfying brew.","DenverLogan","Feb 10, 2013"

Resin and citrus hoppiness is nicely offset by malty sweetness.  Finishes without undue bitterness.  Mouthfeel is a little on the sticky side for an IPA, but actually fits well with everything else going on.  Alcohol is well hidden.  All in all, a very drinkable beer.","dbl_delta","Feb 10, 2013"

Looks like an IPA, a bit on the darker side, white head pours a beautiful bed of bubbles that sit around for the entire duration, lacing is as expected from Sierra. Some sedimentation, but who cares. Smells pitchy, rich. Tastes even, balanced, with a firm spine of hearty ole' fashioned cake doughnuts, washed away quickly by damp, piney notes of hop bitterness. The bitterness will linger only until the next drink, and it starts all over again. Feels plenty big, bigger than the gravity it boasts. If it's high quality IPA you desire, and a price that wont send you to the poor house, Torpedo might be a mainstay in your fridge. It is in mine. I cant find a better IPA for even close to the price. I wish my homebrew tasted this good!","khensley","Jan 23, 2013"

Poured a clear copper color, produced a thick off white head, excellent retention and it left a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this ale contained large amounts of citrus. Medium bodied , this AIPA had a foundation of malted grain that was overpowered by bitter piney hops, and citrus )mostly grapefruit.)- there is also a slight hint of spice (white pepper) Excellent mouthfeel, very smooth- Semi dry finish. Excellent example of an American craft brewed AIPA, use of only American Hops and a special technique of dry hopping make this a great session beer.","GossageBrewery","Jan 23, 2013"

Taste was wonderful citrus flavors, not overly pungent, herbal and slightly minty undertones, biscuity malts, dark sweet sugars. Nice mouthfeel and carbonation that doesn't bite and coats the mouth nicely. Overall a tasty IPA that leans toward the citrusy and sweet side of the spectrum.

4.41,6,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have always respected Sierra Nevada Brewing beers but I must say even I was rather SHOCKED at THIS offering. That is because Sierra Nevada has always been recognised more as more of a mainline brewer than a micro-brewer and one just comes to expect potent ""craft beer""perfections from short-run micros. NaDa! I have had several impressive offerings from this company BUT the Torpedo absolutely EXCELS as a season-round, readily available IPA. It has all the markings of a top shelf, microbrewery craft IPA: Strident sniff, malty mouthfeel and the longlasting romp through the meadows of a hop aftertaste! True to the IPA profile in all categories and style expectations. But what I found most amazing was the LONGLASTING hop kick aftertaste - it is POSITIVELY EQUATING to an amorous afterglow! I've found very expensive IPA and 2xIPA microbrews coming up quite short and soundly failing in this style profile. If you fail anything else in this style, you must AT LEAST have the AFTERGLOW...and this mass produced IPA has it in spades. Granted - I've found several microbrewed IPA's and 2x IPA's that defeat this offering - but NOT at this price and at this nationwide, season round supply! The Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra-IPA pours a hazy gold, sniffs herbal and leaves you stretched out over a bed evergreen boughs...with an amorus smile.","GoldHorde","Dec 13, 2012"

Not too much hops to overwhelm you (i.e. Ruination), but enough to let you know this is certainly a big IPA.","TheCondor","Nov 26, 2012"

Smells of grassy and fruity hops yet still has an indescribable smell that is unique to Sierra Nevada. Great look for an IPA...a beautiful reddish/amber with a nice off white head. As it's predecessor before this, SNPA...another great beer to convert BMC drinkers into true beer enthusiasts as well as to satiate the much more experienced palate. And for the price point there are few better. A beer worth trying as well as seeking out.","Melikeydahop","Nov 26, 2012"

It sports and off white head with decent lacing. The nose is dominated by pine, citrus, alcohol, and a hint of yeast if you look for it. It is moderately heavy on the palate, and it starts with pure grapefruit and then finishes bitter with a wonderful yeast/bread taste that lingers for quite a while. This is an exceptional beer.","silverking","Nov 17, 2012"

The smell itself is wonderful, but if it only came through a little stronger I'd have given it an easy 5.

4.57,9.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"I am normally not open to IPAs but I heard a lot about Sierra Nevada that i had to try it. I started with a strong IPA as this beer to me has a strong malty and hop flavor. My personal favorites are regular ales or dark porters so i just simply am not used to the strong flavor of IPAs. This beer has a very piney/citrus flavor and i think is comes from the hops used in this brew because i know most IPAs have extra hops or malts but i did try another IPA before and it simply did not compare the the flavor of Torpedo. This is just a flavorful beer and the mouth feel and taste lingers for a while but in a good way. Just a reminder, it is a strong beer with 7.2% abv so it creeps up on you but goes down smooth.","JasonL","Oct 06, 2012"

I finally ended up with just over a finger of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was minty, like an evergreen forest in the dead of winter. Man, if that doesn't set your mouth to watering, turn in your hophead status soonest! Mouthfeel was medium and the mintiness of the hops was counterbalanced beautifully by the caramel of the malt. I have heard of hops candy, although I have yet to try some, but this is what I imagine it would taste like! The dense stcky lacing that began to appear was riotous. I swear that I even started to taste coconut at one point. Finish was dry, but not overpowering. Damn, but this was one tasty beer.

There is grapefruit and something else I'll describe as floral, although its not overbearing. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with light bitterness on the end. Carbonation is present but balanced.

4.6,10.6,4,4,5,4,5,"The appearance is a straight up red body below a large white head. It has a musky malt smell that betrays the intense hop taste! Even though this beer is loaded on hops, it is never overbearing, just hugely present. No small task considering hops are present in every stage of the taste, from when it first hits your lips to the aftertaste. It's light bodied which lets it go down easy besides the strong taste. The mouthfeel is understated, which is fine. Overall I really like what Sierra Nevada has done here. They've made a double IPA that delivers on the hops, but presents that in a package that's suited and interesting.","dontpanic5","Jul 15, 2012"

Smells of piney hops, with underlying citrus notes, along with that classic scent that can only be described as ""beer"". The hops hit the tounge instantly, with just enough malt to keep the bitterness from becoming unpleasant. As with the aroma, the pineyness of the hops is more immediate, with the citrus coming into play in the finish. Good mouthfeel. Not too heavy, but you know you're drinking a real beer, not beer-flavored water. Very nice buzz, but the alcohol is well hidden by this beer's amazing flavor.","MrJohnnyDRocker","Jul 11, 2012"

With the lack of strong bitterness, one would expect the hop aromas and flavors to be subdued. That is not true at all. All of the hoppy goodness is still there and is really more enjoyable due to the pleasant bitterness as opposed to in-your-face bitterness. Great DIPA. I can see why everyone loves this so much. The fact that it’s not only delicious and drinkable but also widely available, cheap, and available in cans makes this a 5 overall.","BlackBelt5112203","Jun 11, 2012"

Flavor is light and pleasant--there is nothing ""extra"" about it really. Good balance of citrusy and earthy hops with a sturdy malt backbone with a lot of sugary goodness. You can tell there's a ton of hops in there by the flavor, but the malt sweetness really obscures the bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and easy to quaff. This is a good IPA and worthy of having again. Just don't confuse it with extra or double anything. That's just marketing hype.","EagleTalon","Jun 10, 2012"
2.48,-40.4,4,3.5,2,2,2,"A big thanks to woodychandler for this can. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange/brownish color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of piney hops. Taste is a hop bomb, extreme bitterness, wow, I like hops but this is the most bitter beer I have ever had. Feels medium bodied and very bitter in the mouth and overall is way to unbalanced for my liking.","tone77","Jun 10, 2012"

4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I poured from a bottle and was greeted with a three finger tan-colored head of foam. This faded to some lacing. The color was a clear sweet tea amber color. The nose is interesting as I get a sweet character as much as I do the pine, orange, and ginger notes from the hops. It's a nice hoppy aroma with a sweet malt finish... A combined arms blitzkrieg on the nose. The flavor was of the citrus hops first, fading to the pine and ginger note in the aroma... The sweet malt makes a short closing appearance. The mouth feel was tingly from the carbonation and stays on the palate awhile after the last gulp of beer. Overall this isn't the super bitter hoppy ipa's I usually like, but this is a dang fine drinkable one. It's better balanced and is a great one for maybe a beginner to appreciate.","Rantingfury","Jun 02, 2012"
4.3,3.4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours near clear, with some flocs, showing a deep orange tannic glow. Nose is hoppy but not distinctive in any one note, but more conifer/pine, less citrus overall. Taste is hop-sweet initially, with notable malt notes taking away the hop edge. Hop bitterness emerges after the sweetish notes, grow and then fades with nice sustain of hops minutes afterward, although bitterness is one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is thicker, almost a bit heavy and syrup-like carbonation is week to moderate, fine in feel, but not scrubbing. Alcohol is notable, warm, but not excessive. A solid offering.","Bitter_Echo","Jun 02, 2012"

Honestly, I've only rather recently been introduced to the world of craft beers. Kind of embarrassing, but I've spent most of my beer drinking life (I'm 32) drinking mass produced schwag. To me, beer served one purpose and one purpose only - to get drunk... and to do so cheaply. About a year and a half ago I started to get into wine, which is when I actually began paying attention to what I was drinking. So naturally I started to become more discriminating in my selection of beer. As a recent transplant to central Texas, I discovered several nice local craft brews like Real Ale, Ranger Creek, Freetail, St. Arnold, 512, Live Oak, etc. From there I've discovered other great craft beers like Stone, Sierra Nevada, Boulevard, and New Belgium, and I can't wait to try the thousands of other craft brews out there.","TheBeerDog","Apr 07, 2012"

Taste is very one dimensional with pine flavor from the hops on top of light bready malts. The bitter is subdued and this is pretty easy drinking. High carbonation and just a bit of resin on the palate. On the dry side for the style.

4.75,14.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours deep golden with an abundant eggshell colored head that retains well. The retreating head leaves plenty of sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Toasted malt and citrus and piney hops dominate the smell. It's a very pleasing aroma. The slightly sweet malt flavor hits the tastebuds up front as does the creamy head. Coming in on the back end are the citrus and piney hop bitterness that help balance this beer's flavor. The ABV is at 7.2%, but the alcohol does not come out at all in the taste. This is very well balanced and very delicious. The sweet and bitter balance only improves as it warms up. This is a medium bodied beer. The hops remain in the aftertaste and the carbonation is abundant enough to prepare the mouth for the next sip. Despite all the big flavors in this IPA, the mouthfeel is excellent and this is an easy drinking IPA. Overall, this is an excellent beer. With Sierra Nevada's nationwide distribution, there's no excuse not to try this one if you are interested in the IPA style.","acevenom","Apr 01, 2012"

I've been drinking this beer for a few years now so I have a handle on it. What I love is that it manages to remain unique among the onslaught of American IPAs. Crystal and Citra drive the hop profile, but it's not a citrus/tropical bomb like the other high-profile west coast IPAs (not saying I don't love those too). Torpedo features a strong spicy, black pepper note along with mint, herbs, and a background mango quality, pine sneaks into the mix as it warms. Plenty of malt too, caramel and a general graininess form the backbone. Beautiful copper hue with some malt heft and body that strikes the perfect balance between quaffability and complexity.","bump8628","Mar 09, 2012"

Smell is of bitter hop, citrus and pine, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pretty much an all out hop bomb though there is a nice biscuity malt backbone. Taste is hoppy, citrus and grapefruit up front, nice dose of pine rolls in, semi sweet biscuity malt, perfect bitterness throughout, pine in the finish with a long hoppy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, incredibly slick and oily, full body and nice feel. Nice IPA here, incredibly flavourful, even though this is a hop bomb it doesn't feel that way and actually has a decent balance for something so hop driven, really good stuff.","peensteen","Feb 11, 2012"

Weeds and bittersweet pine sap formulate the main aroma, a little sickly sweet over ripe pear accents puncture in the foreground as well. First sip starts out mellow then quickly turns to bitter one sided hops. Pine, pine and more pine on the palate. If you wanted to show a friend what piney hops tasted like here's your go to. I wish it had some depth though. Medium light bodied with medium carbonation and a smidgen of heat out back. Overall I have to say this beer is nice and bold but far to one sided for my opinion.

Nice citrus smell from the hops and a hint of pine with a good amount of sweetness from the malt. The taste is very solid, good citrus taste mostly a grapefruit taste, then a very slight pine flavor this all balances well with the sweetness from the malt. The malt gives this beer great body for the style also the amount of carbonation is on point. Overall at the price point of $9-10 this is one of my go to beers to keep always on hand. In my mind there is not a better, cheaper, and ease to obtain IPA out in the market today.","phisigben","Jan 30, 2012"

3.95,-5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall: This APA will appeal to all ""hop-heads"" out there. More hoppy than their pale ale with an added kick from the 7.2% ABV, which is very well hidden. The sharp bitterness is what will keep IPA fans coming back for more. A little too bitter for me to have more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. I prefer when the malt is able to pull back the reigns of bitterness somewhat. All in all, Sierra Nevada did a really good job with this one...","cmq103","Dec 12, 2011"

3.95,-5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A solid IPA that you can find available anywhere, and it offers a bit of a different flavor profile than many other West Coast IPA's in my opinion. It's classic Sierra Nevada style, and it's good.","bennetj17","Nov 12, 2011"
3.91,-6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall- A very solid IPA. It uses the sweet malt well alongside the hop profiles.

The taste was a little bit cloyingly sweet at time when I first sipped; i honestly even thought about drain pouring. As I drink more though the unique flavor has come to grow on me with its mysterious spicyness and still major hop character. Sweetness is hard to understand and describe, a very unique IPA.

I see very little carbonation. I don't see an obvious sell by date on the bottle. The smell is like fresh green herbal buds. The hops smell warm(forgive the synesthesia) and inviting. The taste is of citrus ,pine, and pepper. The hops aftertast is a momentary blast of hops then fades to light but lingers. The mouthfeel is slightly sticky and coats the roof of my mouth in a way I like . This is a very good beer and i wanted another and so had one. Goes down well.

Very tasty brew, but this will not knock your socks off. Very drinkable and tasty. Overall, a solid IPA and more robust than their pale ale, but not very memorable.","hmf05","Sep 19, 2011"
4.4,5.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall (4.5): This is a damn good IPA, by any standards. If you’re looking at the bottling date of the beer I drank and asking why I waited so long, I had some from this sixer a couple weeks ago and it was suitably more bitter / fresher than it is now, so I’m neither detracting points unfairly, nor delusional in giving it a good score. Just, y’know. For the record. And I want to see “conifer forest,” or even better, “secondary succession coniferous forest,” on more reviews.","fmccormi","Sep 18, 2011"
3.92,-5.8,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"The beer pours a clear reddish copper color, with an thick, creamy off white head that dissipates slowly. Smells of the typical citrus and hops of IPAs, but the citrus is peculiarly grapefruit like. The first sip had very pleasant floral and herbaceous quality, grapefruit again, but no bitterness. Second sip, I noticed pine resins, still very pleasant. Subsequently, hops bitterness becomes more evident, with a dryness and tannic feel on the tongue that is less pleasant.

4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Here goes my introduction to the world of cask-conditioned beer. I've been looking forward to trying something on cask for a while now. This pours a gorgeous honey/amber color with a very bubbly half-inch head which dissipates quickly, leaving minimal traces of lacing behind. First thing I noticed was the overpowering aroma of dank, resinous hops. There was also a nice floral and citrus scent in there as well. This thing is a hop bomb. Pungent hop taste, leaving a peach aftertaste in my mouth. Definitely much better than the bottled version. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but a little under-carbonated, which I expected from the cask. The only thing that could have made this better, is if it was just a little bit colder(another thing I expected from a cask, warmer temps.) Overall, I would say this is one of the best brews I have had. Feels like a totally different beer. Cheers.","BrewtifulMind","Sep 15, 2011"

This is the 2nd Sierra Nevada Beer I have had and I must say I am very impressed that this brewery puts together well constructed, tasty beers.

3.46,-16.8,4,3,3.5,3,4,"O - A rare outing of what seems to be a session double IPA. Relatively low ABV and a weaker flavor make this a big beer to enjoy in a sixer or the bar.

The nose is loaded with hops and the taste starts out with some pine followed by citrus and finishes off with floral hops. Has a spiciness and some sweet malt in the back. The hops flavors, sweet malts and spices balance each other out very nicely. This beer is very smooth and creamy at first, but than finishes off quite dry with some chalkiness in the mouth. A very great beer that ranks high in my list of favorite IPA's.

Get a stronger nose on it this and would be almost perfect. As the standard Pale Ale from Sierra Nevada has become a popular choice for the masses to show their sophisticated taste and drink as a ""classy beer"" (and for good reason), I believe the true pale ale afficondos will reach for this beer instead.","Bockrules","Jul 13, 2011"

Now that I have worked on it I quite enjoy the bitter piney flavor. The sierra navada torpedo is one of the best I've come across. The color is fantastic. A rich electric copper with a white gold head. The smell is a complex bitter like the rind of a piney orange. The flavor is a rush of citrus and bitter swirled into an explosion.","mattkoon","Jun 18, 2011"

If you like piney hops with little else mixed in, you will like this. Some reviewers said it was complex. I think there were some complex things going on, but they were buried deep beneath the hops.

A little stick and thar carbonation is pretty good. Pretty good drink here. I like the crisp body and relatively low ABV.","Bendurgin","Mar 01, 2011"

Light, chewy, fruity finish. The malt kind of lingers and creates a lemonade flavor. Nothing in the pint jumps out a you. While there's some hop flavor, the clean aspect of this beer kind of kills any ability to enjoy the true nature of a beer like this. I'm pretty sure I'm drinking a bad batch.

Hmm, more hop bite than I thought there would be, not as smooth either. The taste isn't bad, just much harsher than I was hoping for, but hey, it's an IPA.

Lightly toasted malts strolled across my taste buds with grapefruit pith on one arm, herbal piney notes on the other, and a light lemon zest trailing closely behind. It's still a little hard for me to believe that the malts were so prevalent and the hops hardly held a bitter knife to my mouth. Carrying a medium body with nice, rounded carbonation made it creamier and heavier than it appeared, but I would much rather have a beer that holds some weight than have one that's watery and thin. There was a short lingering hoppy bitterness and light caramel sweetness right at the end, but the bitter throughout the beer was actually relatively mellow, making it really easy to drink. I would probably recommend this IPA to someone who's not sure if they like IPAs or not and needs something to ease them into it.

Still hops most prominent in the mix, but also pine and maybe a little citrusy sweetness at the end. I feel the bitterness is overwhelming in this beer.

Can't beat it at 7.99 a six pack. I love SN price points. Quality beer at reasonable prices.

The malt undertones complement the hops nicely, and the aftertaste sits perfectly in the mouth, but isn't too powerful. The ABV is completely hidden by the hop masterpiece. The beer is full bodied and thick, a tad chewey, and the carbonation level is good, giving it a bit of a pop as it slides around. Drinkability is surprisingly high, especially with how good this one tastes. I have put back a sixer in one sitting on a few occasions, not out of a desire to become inebriated, but because I really enjoyed the taste just that much.

No, I'm not into aromatherapy, but if I was, this must be what they mean. The flavor is pretty intense, even for an IPA, Very bold. I doubt many here have ever tried Swedish bitters, but there is a strong similarity here, although tamed down quite a bit. There is a high concentration of hops here which are very sharp and distinctly herbal. Which herbs exactly is kind of hard for me to say. Lemon, orange, pine sap (which I have never tried, but this has to be close), and a dry, herbal tonic, slight quinine finish. Overall, this stuff has a really raw, fresh kick to it.

You get booming amounts of pine with some grassy citrus notes. The first sip lets you know you're in for a hop treat, but the bitterness doesn't kill the tongue. Some IPAs are so assertive that they basically strip the enamel from your teeth, but this beer never approaches those levels. Instead it goes the opposite direction. The mouthfeel from this beer is almost oily from all the hops, but it works. There has to be malt there to keep it balanced but I can't find it. There's a terrific lingering bitterness in the finish.

The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except I confess I was completely unprepared for the amount of hoppy bitterness in this one. Wow. The beer starts off with some malty sweetness, but the sweetness is quickly buried in an avalanche of hoppy, dry, spicey bitterness. There is a huge hoppy presence in this beer, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the abv. is very well disguised.","Anthony1","Aug 09, 2010"

I tend to prefer the really bright, outrageously hopped California IPAs, and this one is a little more refined. You don't get as much of that dominant grapefruit citrus. But it's still very enjoyable and fruity. Citrus, sour green apple, and a sugary malt play with the piney hop bite. That buttery malt follows through.

Pours a slightly cloudy orange/golden colr with a beautiful head that slowly minimizes. The smell on this batch of Torpedo is AMAZING. Definitely one of the strongest floral scents I have ever gotten out of an IPA. Along with strong hop and citrus smell. Upon touching my tongue I get immediate sweetness...a bit of candy sugars along with honey. Then followed by a strong bitter citrusy backbone. Then the sweetness comes back and lingers on the back of the tongue for a bit. The mouthfeel is close to perfect with a nice chewiness to it, but crisp at the same time.

4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly copper, medium amber with wonderful rocky head that has decent retention and good lacing. Aroma is citrusy but also very tropical with pineapple, mango and some floral spice. Also, has a decent amount of caramel malt sweetness. The flavor consists of what I would call a ""progressive"" hop character that is quite enjoyable. Like the aroma it is quite tropical. Mango, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and pine. Well balanced with significant bitterness, but plenty of malt sweetness to match. This IPA reminds me an awful lot of a good double IPA in that it has plenty of sweetness along with the big hop character. Kinda like taking an EQ and pumping the treble and bass. I think this might accentuate the tropical fruit hop aromas. Medium bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel that is possibly this beers week point. Still, quite drinkable and not only is this a great IPA, but a budget friendly one at that.","zoso1967","Mar 27, 2010"
3.86,-7.2,4,3,4,5,4,"Amber and clear, it pours with a copious dense slightly off-white head and a medium amount of carbonation. There is a very small amount of very fine particulates floating around. Very muted aroma, faint amounts of pine, but not your typical West Coast IPA. Judging by previous reviews, I wonder if there haven't been any changes. Well balanced front end with mild sweetness playing off of the bitterness. Lots of bitterness in the back end. Very big and chewy mouthfeel","LittleDon","Mar 27, 2010"

Taste is more of the same only that the hops are stronger as you can taste the bitterness as it goes down. Maybe some citrus hints in there as well. Overall well carbonated and dry. Now this is just my personal bias, but I'm not a huge fan of IPAs, especially really dry ones like this, so I don't find this that drinkable.","Evocatus","Mar 20, 2010"

Now, this particular experience, I admit, may be slightly biased by the Maytag Blue that I'm eating with it, but the Torpedo Extra IPA is truly a fantastic beer, especially for West Coast IPA fans. The only thing that would make it better is a slightly greater hop presence, but that's what I ask for in every beer, so you can take that with a grain of salt. By the way, I picked this beer up at a Whole Foods in Chicago and if you do the same you can also probably find some Maytag Blue Cheese there, at least in the Midwest (Maytag is from Newton, Iowa).

The taste of this beer was wonderfully full and bitter. The only thing that took it down a notch was after the initial pore, the aroma left.

This beer features a very deep and complex flavor profile that you could probably linger over for quite a while. A decent mouthfeel, with a pleasing level of carbonation and smoothness.

When you hold it up to the light it almost has a glowing halo effect. The beer gives a yellow creamy looking crazy big foamy head with huge amounts of lacing. I was a little disappointed with the smell. It wasn't bad, actually still better than the average IPA, but this is a pretty hyped beer and I just expected it to be a little stronger. Hops are the dominant feature in the smell, pine if I'm not mistaken, probably some citrus as well. Taste is a slight step up, same characteristics, but it's stronger. Sweetness in the beginning from the roasted malts, followed by the hops. I find the taste to have more citrus than pine as opposed to the smell, in my opinion anyway. Mouthfeel is very good, medium bodied. Clean, bitter finish, medium bodied, pretty refreshing. Good drinkability to this. Overall it's a good American IPA.","AndyAvalanche","Dec 06, 2009"

There a some floral notes as well but the pine hop presence dominates completely. Overall another good offering from Sierra Nevada.

Hop bitterness is the overwhelming characteristic of course, but this was a lot more balanced than I expected. There is plenty of sweet toasty malt backbone to start. The spicy grapefruit citrus takes over quickly folowed by a perfectly brutal bitter hop kick. There is a nice little burning hop presance on the back of my throat that I really enjoyed. I thought that this was going to be one of those IPA's that went overboard beyond the point of being enjoyable. Just the opposite. This is close to a perfect tasting beer.

Starts with a fruity hoppiness off the bat, going into some sweeter malts then finishes with a more bitter, not sharp or dull, but steady and grapefruit-like. I must say this is a sessioner because I have already sessioned it on a previous day. The AC is surprising at 7.2 which is not at all detectable. This is an incredible selection by SNBC.

The taste follows up the aroma and is pretty satisfying: heavy on the grapefruit peel with some bold pine resin touches towards the finish; yet there is a nice, low-key malt balance - its there, yet not too heavy, letting the hops shine.

If I had my eyes closed, I probably could've told you that this was a Sierra offering, as generous amounts of Cascade-inspired pine and citrus filled my nostrils, with bitter/floral character as well. The flavor hits you with grapefruit and pine, then dissolves mid-palate to bitterness mixed with biscuit and maltiness, and then finishes mildly dry and bitter. Very nicely balanced. The deceiving medium body and decent carbonation hides the alcohol content, and hence makes this a very sessionable ipa...probably TOO sessionable. Well done.","donniecuffs","Oct 06, 2009"

From here, the review may be a bit of an amalgamation because the last sixer I drank seemed to lack the hops punch of the previous few. Really piney hops scent with some citrus and maltiness in the background. Has the pine taste/feel, but not terribly sticky. This may be to rope in a crowd more diverse than a bunch of hopheads. Nice citrus that blends right into the slight malty sweetness. This is my fave from SN. Obviously doesn't have the gusto of DIPA's...But as an American IPA, it doesn't need to.

Smell was good, mainly the citrusy hops but a slight dry malt smell as well. Taste is great as well. A very citrusy, almost grapefruit taste with some dry malt, then you get a nice bitter hop kick on the back of the tounge. Not too malty, but a good balance though heavier on the hop side as you would expect. A creamy but light mouthfeel, slighly oily feeling leftover on your tounge and a nice bitter aftertaste.

Deep bronze hue, as red as it is orange, remains more clear than translucent, credible glow to it. The nose leads with pink grapefruit and pine oil while not overloading on it either, has sufficient malts to smooth things out, cookie dough, peach, apricot, pear fruit, caramel and moist forest floor matter, lingers for some time. Medium-bodied with a sort of soupy carbonation that whips things up more than desired, lifts the flavors up off the palate before they can adequately settle in. The pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus has more bite here than the nose would suggest, brings out more pine and floral shades. Overall, too dry to let the peach, nectarine, pineapple fruit really shine. Granola and unsweetened cereal present. Any maltiness present mostly as fumes, plays on the bitter card without ever risking offense.","farrago","Sep 09, 2009"

I think it just got poured off as I've seen this one with a better head before. Smell is very good, very hoppy. Smells citrusy and piney and just smells very good overall. Taste is just as the smell would lead it to be, citrus and pine hops. Kind of bitter all the way though and has a pretty piney after taste. Really great taste, especially when it warms up just a bit. A little high ABV but it's no problem at all. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada, just one of those breweries you can't go wrong with. This one quickly became a favorite from them and one I'll try and pick up whenever possible.","dismal","Jul 09, 2009"

Caramelly and toffee-sweet with spicy pine notes, as well - this one is enticing! Juicy and thick on the palate - very malty and not really bitter enough, I'm afraid. In fact, except for its distinctly American hops, this one is almost like an English barleywine, saturated with brown sugar, brown bread, port, and honey. Too sweet, really, so even though it's got some complexity to it, it's just not that drinkable. I like my IPAs dry and hop-forward, dammit!

The intense herbal notes in the smell & tastes make it seem very fresh, that's about it, wasn't to great to me, or exciting. It tastes more like an amped up Pale Ale, or strong Ale, rather than an IPA, which was really something that through me off.

4.23,1.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"12oz. 2nd time having this 'Extra IPA' - first time was blindly tasted. Pours a bright orange with a nice foamy, creamy off-white head that leaves great lacing that sticks to the glass. Aromas are floral hops, citrus rind - mainly grapefruit, and pine. Initial taste is a sweet malty, biscuity backbone that is quickly taken over by the hops - grapefruit rind, and the bitterness is mild to start. Hop characteristics build though - more bitter, piny, dry, and acidic with each sip. Mouthfeel is juicy and oily - especially toward the bottom of the glass as the hop oils have coated the palate completely by now. Alcohol is well concealed throughout - not even the least bit noticeable. This is a solid American IPA, but as far as representing the style it's almost in a style of its own with its complexity and brewing techniques - close to an Imperial IPA. Price is outstanding - $6.99 for 6 - you can't beat it for a high quality brew like this!","barnzy78","May 19, 2009"

I can't put my finger on the taste, but it is different but in a good way. Maybe a bit over hyped, but it's still a very good beer. I might chill the other one a bit longer before enjoying it.

Lovely lacing and clarity, but what else do you expect from SN. The nose is not as strong as I would expect with an IPA, but I get notes of pine and citrus mixed with a bit of crystally malt. Good carbonation leads into a lite malt moment before the hops slam you. This beer is named Torpedo for a reason. The crisp bitterness doesn't sneak up, it announces itself with a ping and swoops in on you. This is a clean crisp brew with a nice bitter finish. Strong all the way through.

4.15,-0.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"From all of the hype of this beer, I was expecting something absurdly hopped. but was pleasantly surprised with this well balanced ipa. The beer pours to a golden amber, shimmering ever so slightly in the light. The head on this beer billows strongly but still manages to invite my nose forward. Balance, balance, balance is what comes to my mind when sniffing the beauty. Of course there is some lovely pine popping me right in the sinuses, but the rushing behind it is that lovely slightly roasted malt to sweeten it all up. Taste follows the nose closely, wonderfully bitter/piney flavor up front followed by a slight caramel from the malt. Leaves you with fresh pine breath (but not like pinesol). This feels a bit carbonated on my tongue, not unpleasant, but not the best thing to ever touch my tongue either. The ABV is hidden quite well on this. I could and will drink this often. Thank God for year round IPA's.","youngblood","Mar 31, 2009"

Head fades slowly and leaves ring of sticky lacing on the glass with each sip. Aroma is fairly subtle (though I am getting over a cold). Hints of pine and citrus hops. I was shocked at how balanced this beer is. I was expecting an in-your-face hop bomb but was pleasantly surprised with a bready, slightly malty flavor up front followed by hints of apricot and grapefruit and a slightly dry finish. Minimal lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is fantastically creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable, the 7.2% ABV is very well hidden.

Decently balanced IF with good malt base and big hoppy flavor, transitions to a long lived, very bitter, gently decreasing aftertaste. The flavor is a little bit one-dimensional but tasty nonetheless. Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation and a dry, almost alcoholic finish. This is a great offering from SN.

Taste is maltier than the average IPA, with a caramel toasted flavor throughout. The flavor from the hops is very herbal in character, earthy, with a hint of citrus in the finish. Nice high bitterness levels balance the malt sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, quite nice. Carbonation levels slightly high, but with a vigorous pour, they can be brought to nice levels. Quite drinkable, but not as much compared to some IPA's, due to the higher ABV. Overall a very good beer, though it does seem to taste a lot like Sierra Nevada's other beers. All of their IPA's/Pale Ales seem to have a common flavor. Not that this is a bad thing, because the tastes are very good, it just seems a little more variety would be nice sometimes.","tronester","Mar 25, 2009"
3.92,-5.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours clear amber from 12 oz stubby bottle. Small head recedes quickly. Smell is of fresh cut citrus - stronger and more fresh than anticipated. The taste is similarly fresh and citrusy, but too much like SNPA for me. The hops may be mitigated a bit too much by the malt presence. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit slick. Drinkable and well-priced session IPA. I will drink this again, but it isn't a go-to.","btuthill","Mar 25, 2009"
4.35,4.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is sharp and delicious. An immediate rush of citrus and herbs. Hints of sweetness, not at all bready or caramely, hard to pin down, but which seem to be buried by, yet somehow in balance with, the stronger surrounding flavors, as contradictory as that sounds. Long wonderful finish. Like a symphony which pleases through multiple and differing fugues, and ends with a return to its original theme now revealed with clarity. Pine and citrus, give way to an incredibly and deliciously bitter ""herbosity", that after seven sips has left me craving number eight. In all ways a fantastic brew, and despite its 7.2 abv could easily become a favorite session beer for me.","cavedave","Mar 25, 2009"
4.25,2.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a bright orange hue, topped by a finger's worth of creamy white head that leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Beautiful floral aroma of sharp, tangy, citrusy hops, offset just enough by a mild biscuit malt character. Palate is assertively hoppy without being excessively bitter. Notes of pine and grapefruit are present, with an underlying mild sweetness from the biscuity malt. Nice, full body is very creamy for an IPA, but still works well with the flavors in play here. A very drinkable IPA, even if it is a bit strong. A welcome addition to the SN lineup.","ElGordo","Mar 24, 2009"

Smells fruity and citrussy with a fair bit of toffee and caramel to balance the hops. Orange and pith are imediately apparent in the flavor, with just enough caramel to help balance the hops. Medium to fill in mouthfeel with ample carbonation, which helps make this one very drinkable considering the ABV and complexity.

It has a tremendous hop bitterness that resinates in the finish. The malt character is good, although it's surprisingly thin. The mouthfeel is fine.

The aroma is a good balance of the three biggies, IMO: citrus/pine hops, earthy hops and sweet malt. Of course the malt is the least of the powers, but it balances well. Most of the beer is non-aggressive. That is, it doesn't overpower with loads of hops. It has just enough to throw the kilter towards bitter. Nice bite, but it won't distract you. Clean, crisp.

I was expecting a big bitter Extra IPA, and was kind of let down. By all means, this beer is extremely good, but... I wanted more.

Definitely awesome, check it out.","BirdFlu","Mar 16, 2009"
4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a beautiful deep amber color, a bit darker than what I associate IPA's with but has gorgeous color. About an inch of creamy off white foat, sheets of lacing and head retention were really fantastic. Nose is of citrusy hops, a bit piney. There is actually a good deal of malt in the nose as well. Taste is the citrus hopes (grapefruit and orange, maybe a touch of lemon) and pine bursts at first. There is a strong malt backbone that gives a good deal of girth to this beer. Medium bodied, low carbonation, goes down smooth, abv is not detectable. I could sit with this beer for a while.","Jayli","Mar 16, 2009"

Aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops with some sweet malt present as well. The taste is a wonderful plethora of citrus and pine hops with a great malt backbone holding it up. The beer is crisp and smooth with mild alcohol presence and enough puckering hop bitterness to leave you craving the next sip. Considering how easy it is to find, it's $8.99 a sixer price-tag and just how tasty it is, this makes for a very drinkable beer!","atsprings","Mar 15, 2009"

Young and freshly agitated the aroma is damp, sweet pine needle; citrusy fruit punch balanced with spice. Several minutes later...the head is sill on steroids, needed to be roughed up though. Medium body, sharp with several notes interchanging, finishing long with a refreshing bitter. The hops are zesty, prickling a humbly balanced malt background. This one sits as a session for the palate abusers. All them RIS' and DIPA's have slapped around (and stimulated) our tastebuds, requiring a 7.2% ball game beer.

As with anything, the taste becomes less intense as you consume more of it in a short session. I don't know that I would session the stuff but I think it would be a reasonable option for pitchers shared with hop-loving friends. It warms nicely too - no big alcohol hits develop on the nose and the good mouthfeel works at warmed temps.

The flavor of course is big hops mirroring the aroma, with a nice bite of bitterness. I personally found the mouthfeel a little on the dry/bitter side, but not in a terrible way.

Fresh squeezed lemon juice, handfuls of fresh pine needles, a bit of grapefruit and some lemon zest thrown in, to add a bit of bitterness. The flavor isn't as hoppy as the aroma. The pine is more prevalent, with the lemony citrus playing second fiddle. There is also just a bit of biscuits. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but it really doesn't affect the quality of the beer.

It has a lively medium body that's pretty dry all the way to the finish. It tastes like it smells, pretty much. It's quite bitter and well balanced.

The spicy bite of pine resin is balanced beautifully by burnt caramel and grapefruit sweetness of the malt with a suggestion of bready yeast. Surprisingly thick on the tongue and a finish that trends towards sweet rather than sharp.

The hops, however, just aren't as huge as I'd like them to be. It's plenty bitter, but the presence and flavor is really lacking; nowhere near as good as Celebration.

Sure I would love to call thier wet-hop harvest the go-to beer, but let's face it, wet-hop beers are meant to be drunk when fresh.

Taste consistent with nose - some sweetness up front and a light hops bite at the back; however, it doesn't stick around for long - great balance.

Aggressive, but restrained and not at all harsh, the alpha acids cling to the tastebuds while a chewy, creamy caramel malt note balances the flavor profile nicely. Good mouthfeel, too, with a medium consistency and a fantastic, bitter bite of lingering hop resin. Not a lot of complexity to this IPA, but for hop lovers like myself, it's a dream.

It's got floral hop notes and points of pine and citrus. Just not as bold as I'd like. However, hops are a lot more prevalent on the buds. They make their presence known in both the bitterness and the flavor. Bright citric characteristics and some piney flavors as well backed by a biting bitterness not seen in many regular IPAs today. I guess this is where the ""extra"" comes into play. The malts provide a good enough amount of caramel sweetness for such a beer.

It just is what it is, a smooth, soft, gentle, flavorful IPA, well-balanced and drinkable. It's very sessionable, as well, and though the abv% isn't listed, I can't assume it's 6%, 6.5%.

A very good pine/citrus hop aroma. The flavor follows the lead set by the aroma, with SNs typical lack of malt, this beer is all hop flavors. The body is good, but could use a more solid foundation to build upon. A very drinkable beer, palate fatigue will become an issue due to the lack of balance. I'll admit that I liked this beer more than I expected, due to all the hype surrounding it. I generally find SN to be a one-trick pony. While I like their beers, the focus on hops only is boring.

The body is clear, and clean with a pure copper color. The smell of this beer is grapefruit/citrus hops and sweet malts does not come off over hoped. Taste is sweet malt flavor right away, followed by citric flavor with a bitter feel in the back of the mouth. Full mouthfeel, nice and clean, goes down smooth with a bitter back end. Overall this beer has good malt and hop flavors with an astringent and bitter aftertaste. There is a lot of talk about this being the same or close to Celebration Ale but it is not. I prefer Celebration Ale due to the hop profile. Torpedo does sport a 7.2 ABV and is a good addition to S.N. line. I enjoyed this beer and will be drinking it again.","TEXTONE","Feb 10, 2009"
4,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Glowing hue of deep honey. Mostly transparent. On top of this sits the 1/2 finger cap of cream colored head, that leaves only hints of head throughout, complete with a wall of lace with each sip. Smells heavily of biscuits and a biting, almost 'skunky' style of hop aroma, that softens just a bit into some citric notes. Taste starts with a soft floral hop, a superior opening, and then opens up to a pronounced hop bite of the citric variety, followed quickly by a well backed and complex malt middle. Roasted notes, caramel and just a whisper of dryer pale malts slides into a very soft finish, with a milky honey type sweetness that soothes the tongue. This combines with the ample carbonation to provide an extremely pleasant finish. Pockets of hop oils adsorp to the corners of my mouth, and this is the best part of this beer. Raw, wild and especially 'floral' in this aftertaste. Overall it is a bit too far on the sweet side. Well put together, but could use more bitter notes and some lighter malt presence.","Philabeerphia","Feb 10, 2009"

A welcomed hop aroma filled my nose the second after putting down the bottle cap, the fresh hop scent that booms off of this thing is excellent, pine resin, i dont get too many citrus notes going on here but oh god, this thing screams hops! Good balance is achieved throughout, the sweet malts lay beneath the immense usage of the humulus lupulus for the most part but its slight hint of caramel sweetness in the nose and mid palate, makes the cone attack so much more effective. Lightly herbal, mostly grassy though, its not so much bitter as it is hoppy, if that makes any kind of sense to you, the hop character is like none ive experienced before, it really kicks itself into overdrive a few seconds after the quaff is swallowed, the finish is long and ultra hoppy. Medium in body, bigger than i had initially expected, very bright with carbonation. I expected a different beer when i first heard of (and was tortured by) Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA, honestly i expected a Celebration clone, i was wrong, in a good way, well done Sierra Nevada, i look forward to seeing this one around permanently.","ATPete","Feb 10, 2009"

This is not a big California hop bomb, but rather a restrained, well thought out melding of flavors. The mouthfeel is super smooth and even slightly creamy, but the astringency of the hops on the finish still leaves the palate invigorated and ready for the next sip. This is a super drinkable beer, even if the abv is around 7ish.

Smell of sticky, pungent, sweet piney hops, really rich and full. Great aroma. Light silkiness on the tongue that gives way to flavors of lightly toasted grains mingling well with a fair but not overpowering amount of hops.

This one was definitely all American, as the pour looked clear copper in color and the smell was that of grapefruit, orange peal, and squeezed lime. The citric aspects continued into the taste with bitter peals of these fruits making a prominent appearance. The malt backbone was solid and caramelized, but the hops were large and in charge. Sticky mouthfeel and long drawn out aftertaste made me wonder if this was straddling the line between an IPA and a DIPA, but with the well hidden alcohol and unpublished ABV, I am not certain.

Somewhere in the middle of the drink you get a sweetness coming from the malts and hops; it's a fruity, citrus type flavour that creates a nice backbone to the up front piny hops.

Poured a crystal clear amber orange color with large off white head with plenty of sticky lacing. Taste is WOW, all about hops, hops, and more hops.

The taste is just awesome. I am getting more hop flavor out of this than most DIPAs! For a second I thought it WAS a DIPA. The blend of pine, herbs and citrus really all stand out on their own, while complimenting each other at the same time. Perfect.

Upon the first taste, there is not as much bitterness as I expected. It has some nice citrus flavors, mostly grapefruit and orange peel, maybe some light piny flavor, and it's extremely dry on the finish, with a decent pale malt, cracker-like backbone. Mouthfeel isn't as solid as I hoped it would be, lower end of medium bodied to be sure. This is a highly drinkable IPA. The bitterness is not very harsh on the tongue while still retaining plenty of hop flavor.

Nice hoppy/citrus aroma. Was served with zero head, unfortunately. A bit of a malt aroma and taste. Nice crisp mouthfeel was a good bit of carbonation.","doubleipa","Aug 05, 2008"
3.55,-14.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Hazy orange-amber with a large, frothy, slightly off-white, slowly diminishing head. Good lacing. The smell is of huge juicy citrus fruit. Big-time hops here, with a light biscuity malt barely detectable. Taste-wise, more of the same. BIG hops up front. Grapefruit and lemon. Very noticeable alcohol, especially on the finish. And on the finish there's a lingering bitterness and keeps growing long after and stay around for quite some time. It has a medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation and stinging alcohol. At first I thought I was going to love this beer because of its great hops aroma and flavors. But I don't know if the problem here is that the hops are too arrogant or that the malt base is too weak, but it just lacked balanced. Good hop bomb, but a bit of a disappointment from Sierra Nevada.","ski271","Jul 15, 2008"

Citrus and pine with an undercurrent of cut grass. This stuff has one hell of an aroma, and I'd probably have given it a 5 had I not followed this up with a pint of Blind Pig. The flavor mirrors the aroma; tons of fresh resiny hops and a hint of dry biscuity malt behind it. The dry finish is spot-on for the style, and the restrained bitterness greatly enhances the drinkability.","largadeer","Jul 06, 2008"

With the tradition for fantastic IPAs coming off the West Coast, this beer holds its own. It pours a light golden color with a lightly filitered look and the characteristic, craftsmanship head retention of all Sierra Nevada beers. The aroma is strongly hoppy (as it should be!) with notes of pine. The flavor is . . . how to describe?. . . a deeper, darker hop flavor then I have ever had. More blunt than bitey!

3.88,-6.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a light amber color with a thick white head, moderate lacing. You know this is a Sierra Nevada from the aroma and first sip. Big hop aromas of pine & citrus with subtle caramel. Lots of hop flavor, again pine and citrus up front, then you taste the alcohol with a sweet, slightly chocolately finish and hoppy aftertaste. A little watery with medium carbonation leaves a nice mouthfeel. Good example of an American IPA.","scottg","May 12, 2008"

Notes of citrus up-front with a clean toasted malt base. Notes of peat with peppery floral hops; a nice earthen flavor. Medium in body; slightly more active than usual, but it works well with the peppery flavors. A decent IPA. Nothing flashy, but a change of pace from the more common, highly hopped west coast IPAs of today.","NEhophead","May 09, 2008"

For me, when i drink any type of sierra nevada brew you can tell a sierra nevada beer apart because of the hops they use...i did not get this from this beer. The hops just stay on your tongue even after you drank it so nicely. Awesome brew, wish they bottled this stuff, def a hop-head must.

3.85,-7.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Light brown, almost amber in colour out of the tap. Modest head with somewhat lingering lacing. A little more malty that I prefer right off the bat, but the aromas from the hops came through clearly, in classic Sierra Nevada style. The doughy malts offer up a solid if not unspectacular balance to the hoppy goodness on the palate. This really is a great sessionable offering from Sierra Nevada and a must try for those who have just gotten into craft beers and have been stuck on Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for some time. A solid offering.","goindownsouth","Feb 16, 2008"

The nose was found to be pleasantly hoppy. This a grainy, oily, hoppy AIPA, notes of maple, and pine sappy hops. A wonderful addition to the SN line, fine, hoppy, tasty and sessionable.

While it did give a lot of play to the hops, the malt was sweet and toasty, giving at least the illusion of balance, and no matter what the ABV actually is, it was a simple pleasure to drink. It's basic, blended, and hopefully bound for bottles, because this one I could enjoy anytime, anywhere. A good session IPA...and there are never enough of those.","Foxman","May 31, 2006"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I got a growler of this from the Drafting Room in Exton and had it with family at a cousins wedding. The beer poured a redish amber color into a tulip glass. The beer had a nice white head, considering it was from a growler, and had some good lacing down the glass. The nose was a punch of piney hops and citrus tones, a bit of grapefruit. Although the taste is led by the strong piney hops flavor, there is a good bit of lemon/grapefruit and a mild but subtantial malty backbone. Overall this is a solid beer of undetermined ABV but it is drinkable none the less.","ggaughan","May 21, 2006"
4.08,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Clear reddish orange colour topped by a full, dense, creamy, cream coloured head. Excellent retention and it produced thick rings of lace at each sip. Intense pine and grapefruit aromas with a bit of thin malt to back the hops up. Strong bitterness with a light malt component. Pine was more pronounced than grapefruit to start, but this switched in the finish with a little orange as well. Bitterness really lingered. Creamy texture with a medium body and slight chalky dryness. I enjoyed this quite a bit, especially the hop combination used for finishing. There was also just enough malt to keep things from getting out of hand, but not enough to mute the hop profile.","DrJay","May 20, 2006"
