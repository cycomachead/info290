"Solid ipa. Not overly hoppy or malty.  Bottled from TJs."
""
"The hops in this beer are so delicately balanced with the inherent sweetness, they result in a silky, savory experience that we quite enjoyed. Very well done, Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent, extremelly perfect beer A+"
""
""
"Nice golden hue. Delicious citrusy scent with a light hoppy smell, definitely taste the citrus notes, also has a decent about of bitterness and slight hoppiness. Smooth taste going down not syrupy or off. Good beer."
""
"my go to beer is goose island ipa, this is a notch or two above, wish it was cheap enough for my new go to."

"Oh my god, this is wonderful. It's right there with Cigar City Jai Alai as a new favorite!"

"In my humble opinion, Smuttynose's Finest Kind IPA is one of the best IPA's I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I work very hard, 40+ hours a week, and I'm up at 5am to be at work on time. That being said, if I have the money, I'm buying a six-pack of Finest Kind after work every day and drinking the entire thing over the course of a few hours. Now, I'm not an alcoholic in any way, but I sure as hell am addicted to Finest Kind. It is the epitome of what an IPA should be like. Not to mention that when I wake up in the morning, I'm not hungover at all. Now that's what good beer is all about: enjoyment, satisfaction, and the feeling of being rewarded. Absolutely love it."

"Something about this beer is distinctively Finest Kind, to me. That vetiver-ish aroma and slight flavor is something I've not experienced in any other beer. I'm not sure I love that, but it makes it something definitely unique and something I could definitely pick out of a line. Couple that ""one of a kind"" flavor with its incredible drinkability, and I can see why this beer is loved by so many."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptionally aromatic on the nose. Drink is a bit less hoppy than was expected. Great beer!"
""
"Prominent bitterness but a fairly balanced IPA at this point concerning the flavors of hop and malt."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good brew, would gladly drink again. Worthy of the name"
""
""
"My Wife and I took a tour of the new state-of-the-art Smuttynose Brewery on Towle Farm Road in Hampton, New Hampshire on Labor Day this year.  I highly recommend you take a tour of their new brewery and sample their fine beers."
""
""
"just damn good, thirst quenching fortitude!"
""
"To me it's the best IPA in the US. Every time I drink this beer (often) it stuns me with its robust flavor. Recommended to any hop lovers who appreciate a quality beer. Thank you Smuttynose, top notch indeed."
""
""
""
"Outstanding .. Hops galore.. Great taste for those that love that sort of thing.. Glorious."
""
""
""

"Better than Big A IPA"
""
""
""
"So good, Best IPA period."
"Exceptionally well balanced and subtly complex in the best of ways ( to me meaning eminently drinkable. I literally take sip and admire the bottle or glass for its superiority of beermeanor and am often carried off for a second-or many-to places I've been and other great beers I have consumed. State of mind recall is a quality ascribed to the best of beers. It's not often a Busch brings back great memories, well besides being ripped out of a drunken slumber as a minor on a friend's parents' commode...I digress... ). It is simply and eminently drinkable, time and time again...Like the the dudes on the bottle as welll...wow, this is not how one reviews a beer..."
"Awesome beer I love it !"
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was an above average example of the style, it's a nice IPA, but I don't really see what sets it apart from the rest and while it is enjoyable I don't find it to be all that memorable.  This beer had a nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, fairly clean, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, but the taste doesn't really give me the urge to come back for more.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel it was good and just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the green hop aspect, I think this bee would be better if it didn't have that.  I would buy this beer again, but I don't think it's something I'll keep in the fridge at all time.  I would recommend giving this beer a try, but I can't say it's a stand out in the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, it's a pretty solid IPA, don't get me wrong, but when it comes down to it, I don't think it has anything that really sets it apart or makes it memorable.  This beer made for a nice first impression for Smuttynose and I think it falls at above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this is a solid IPA, keep it up."

"Love the citrusy hoppy flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid IPA, nice citrus flavor and solid hops, can't beat for the price, I can get in 12 pack, I get it regularly."
"Overall. Nice strong, medium robust, hoppy  IPA?"
""
""
""
""
"This is my first review (bear with me here), so I'm not even going to attempt the whole look, smell, taste etc bit. Overall, it doesn't seem to have that 'bite' that other IPAs have. It's very smooth, balanced, smells good, a bit lighter in color than I had expected. I admit I cheated and looked up the beer on BA before purchasing. I wouldn't rate this 100 like the bros, but it's still an A quality beer in my book no doubt."
"My favorite IPA. I will always buy this because its smooth and delcious"
"WOW! Awesome tasting IPA with a ""KICK"" I would DEFINETLY recommend this one...and I will be buying more A.S.A.P! Nice Job Smuttynose...this GEM currently has a spot in my TOP10!"

"Top notch ipa.  Perfect amount of hops shining thru."
""
"This is one of my favorite beers and it doesn't get enough recognition. FinestKind is one of the best IPAs available. The smell is citrus with a malty sweetness that couldn't complement better. Perfectly balanced across the board. Taste is as hoppy as a standerd IPA should be with just the right amount of malt. Great unfiltered feel, crisp but not thin and the right amount of carbonation. Overall excellent, drink one you will want another drink two and you know it's really good drink a few cases and you will see its just about perfect."

"another great ipa. smuttynose has it"

"Poured in to an IPA glass, the citron orange liquid displays a slight chilled haze. There's a nice pillowy head that rises above the rim. Decent head retention, with beautiful white snowflake-like lacing in its wake. An aromatic bouquet of minty pine and grapefruit greets the nose. Pleasant and enticing scents. The flavor is malty sweet with a pronounced hop bitterness. Pungent and pithy. The pale toasted malts wrestle with grapefruit zest, and go down for the count. More balanced than some other American IPA's, but certainly still a hop-centric ale.  There's a light lingering mint with a relatively clean, refreshing finish. Excellent mouthfeel with a perfect marriage of a smooth, rich body, and zesty carbonation. This is a quality IPA. It's easy to drink and provides a nice hoppy experience. With the glut of IPA's on the market, this doesn't really stand out too much from the pack though. It's just a tad overrated in my humble opinion."

"Not the best ipa one had.. Not the worse.. I think I gave it a fair score. For 6.9 Abv you could taste the alcohol.. And for 75 ibu's it was not very bitter at all."

"It's a great beer to have any time of the year. Wether you're tired and want something cold to chill, when your thirsty for something refreshing, and/or want it to sip while enjoying some great american food."
"A nice golden color with a nice hoppy aroma. Taste: has a hint of citrus flavor. Overall a good refreshing IPA. I need to try  some more!"
"O- Well rounded and good drinking IPA."

"What a fine fine IPA! Pours a nice copper color and decent head with good retention. I love the aroma! Citrus hops and fruity esters, particularly a bannana tone. Great hoppy taste; citrus grapefruit hops with a bitter finish. A touch of malt backbone is subtle but there. Great feel in that it is so drinkable, one could have more. Medium bodied and pine like. I will be getting this one more often."
"Fresh hoppy nice finish And aroma"
""
""
""
""
"Overall 3.5: A good IPA.  I honestly became bored with the dryness present in this beer.  All throughout the flavor profile...dry, dry, dry.  I think it speaks volumes that the brewers at Smuttynose previously released several versions flavored with lemon.  There is just not that much going on with this beer, IMHO."
""
"This is a solid IPA. The flavors are very well integrated; I'm mainly picking up citrusy lemon, pine, and grass with some fruit (maybe pineapple and grapefruit). This is all over a very nice malt back bone. What sets this beer apart from other IPAs is the finish. The finish is so clean and crisp. It's a very nice change up from the usual overly bitter IPAs that linger and leave your mouth really dry. It's actually drinkable; I think I'm gonna have another..This is a classic example of what an IPA should be."

"O- A nice IPA that is fairly easy to drink and nicely balanced.  I really enjoy this beer, worth picking up."

"Excellent IPA; straightforward which seems like a backhanded compliment, but I appreciate that they didn't play with the style and simply realized it.  The bitterness of the finish wasn't quite right for my palate."

"One has to respect the older IPA recipes that inspired the newer ones,and Finestkind fits squarely in that category. Not over-hopped,not over-hyped, just a solid easy drinking IPA that is priced fairly and is readily available, very much recommended."

"IPAs are not my thing, but this is a darn good one - hoppy bite yet somehow smooth on the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Yum! This falls into ""East Coast IPA"" category for me. More traditional hop varieties, lower hop levels, more towards an English IPA range, not the MOAR HOPS West Coast IPAs that I prefer. Still, this is worthy of high marks and a well made beer. I think they blend in just enough citric flavors to makes this a great beer."
""
""
""
"Very hoppy, strong flavor, and a bottle of it snuck into the back of my fridge, was good even after a couple months."
"It poured a slightly hazy golden amber with a billowy white head that left excellent lacing.  The bitter hop aroma hits you right out of the gate with heavy citrus, tropical fruits, lemon zest and some floral tones to round it out.  The taste starts with the same citrus and tropical fruit hop tones that end with a nice resinous and slight pine bitterness coating your palate.  There are some floral hop notes mixed in as well and begin to reveal themselves as the beer warms. The hops float over a slight malt body that doesn't get in the way of this very clean and sharp hop presentation.  The bitter dry hop finish keeps your thirst quenched and really allows this beer to shine as a hop tribute."

""
""

"Very well balanced IPA all around. Lived up to the 'hype' for me. Would buy more, which I don't feel about even a lot of good IPAs."

"Overall, if I wasn't expecting more based on the hype I would have enjoyed it more.  It was a fine kind of IPA, but not ""finest"".  Still, it was very drinkable ale and I would definitely try it again to see if other batches have more of the citrus that I've read about."
""
"Overall: A refreshing and drinkable IPA. Just enough malt for balance with clean, crisp hops shining throughout."

"Mouthfeel is light and dry. Overall, very good beer."

"Pours clear golden color with finger width foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Lacing is mild.  Citric aroma with slight grassy hops.  Bready malty taste followed by moderate grassy bitterness with slight citric flavor at the end.  Aftertaste may be slightly soapy, but still nice and moderately bitter.  Excellent transition from malts to hops."
"O: Liked the beer, but doesn't beat a lot of the others for me."
"Either way, I'm glad this brewery is now distributed to the Lone Star state."

"The head on ""finest kind"" was two fingers full of frothy amazingness, with great lacing. Appearance...well even with a super slow pour I couldn't keep sediment out of the pour, and alot of it (even after setting for two days??), I'm fine with it but I'm sure it could put off some. Amber in color and hazy in appearance. The taste took me a while to get a grip on. On first taste it seemed to be way overpowered by piney hops with no forgiveness. After the first half it really smoothed over and the malts came to life and it came to life. The second one I poured and let mellow in the glass for a bit longer and that made this beer the Finest Kind of IPA."
""
""
""
"Finestkind IPA delivers great taste, and a great IPA experience. Highly recommended for IPA lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty - a classic American IPA. Looks alright, though a more persistent head would have been nice. The aroma and flavour are seriously hoppy, with plenty of pine and citrus in evidence. The malt takes a back seat and there is a hint of alcohol muddying the character. Good body. A hophead's delight - goes down a treat. Worth sampling if you come across it."
"The aftertaste is very satisfying. I think I won't want another beer after this."
""
""
""
"Candy caramel malt flavor and a bright floral hop profile with medium bitterness that lingers.  Zesty fruit notes and pine.  Well balanced attack."

"O:  This is a great IPA for those being introduced to the style: inoffensive, but flavorful enough to get the picture. It's well-balanced and is clearly well-crafted."
""
""
""
""
"O: while I prefer IPAs with tropical fruit notes, this is really well done;"
""
""
""
""
"Just had this last night, and was surprised how much I liked it.  This is an extremely well balance beer with exceptional hoppyness - hoppiness - hopyiness.  Whatever...this is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the label !!. Pours a yellowish-orange cloudy color with a decent head. Lots of flowery, citrusy flavors and most of the bitter hops comes at the end and lingers. Decently balanced and the first taste does not have the bitterness I expected up front. Overall a good beer and great carbonation, real fizzy !!!"

"O- I was expecting more after reading the reviews on the website. Not the worst I've had but definitely not the best, which is rather disappointing considering that Smuttynose puts out some very good beers. The finish is what turned me off the most about this, it was quite acerbic and piney and it just did not do it for me. I would recommend it though, but it's just not my taste."
""
""
""

"Overall this a solid but not quite outstanding APA."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beer that I keep coming back to over and over again. Appearance is a hazy orange with a cream colored head that laces the glass. The smell had a lot of citrus and hop flavors in it. The taste was similar with orange peel, lemon, and grapefruit flavors through out the beer. The mouthfeel compliments the taste with a light crisp finish that makes it one of my go to beers all year round. A great beer for hop lovers and casual drinkers alike."

"I'm pretty impressed with this beer considering I grabbed it randomly as part of a Smuttynose sampler pack."
""
"Way too bitter for me. Like grapefruit straight up. Piney, with some notes of fruit, but the grapefruit dominates all. Literally like eating raw grapefruit. The malts try to carry the load, but buckle under the weight here. A personal preference. A great example of the super high IBU American IPA genre, so fans of the style who dig and crave this know and of thing will find all they could ever want here. Not me. I am not adverse to hops, but the bitters are over the top for my palate and not enough of that floral character I love in IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit juice flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with solid citrus zest and citrus juice characteristics that are slightly better in the taste to me."

"This ipa pours a hazy orange copper color with an abundance of sediment in the pour. The head is short lived and the lacing decent. The nose is a boozy, floral blend that does not indicate the bitterness normal to an american ipa. There are notes of floral hops, bready yeast, caramel malts, and; dare I say, coconut. The mouth is adequately sticky and smooth. Flavor is far more bitter than the nose with a lot of grapefruit pith, floaral bouquet, and oakish earthy notes. This is good but not as good as its reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting IPA. Lots of floral and citrusy characteristics. Floral element can't be overstated, at points it's like eating bitter lavender soap. Big west-coast style in-your-face hop character with minimal hop presence. Tasty and quite decent."
""
"Medium to light mouthfeel, very lightly carbed. The finish highlights the light malt and citrus sweetness before reaching the balance of slightly bitter, earthy resin."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There are many other IPAs I would prefer over this one."
""
""
""
"Will not try another draft, and cannot see using valuable fridge space on this one. Overrated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm all for a good IPA but this one just doesn't do it for me. Its got a really strange taste and the hops have a really strong profile. Seems to its a little out of balance. Might have been the bottle I got. Will revisit"

"Overall, sigh, this beer was a whole lot better years ago... I know my palate has changed a lot, and the whole IPA concept has been completely revolutionize, but I really don't think this is the same great IPA that it used to be. I remember more citrus and floral hop components, less malt and sweetness, more spicy bright hop bite and even more bitterness, really just feel like this beer has been bastardized."

"Poured into pint glass. Nice blonde/orange color with a nice foamy head. Which sticks around after the pour. Very nice hop aroma. Also I get a hint of citrus. Great hop taste. Has a good bitter aftertaste. Smooth feeling. Nice carbonation. Very good IPA."
"O- This beer will always be in my top 10 list.. very consistent beer and very widely available around my area.. Great beer Smutty.."

"Best before 5/14/14. Smells quite nice—sweet and clean. Taste is a little hard to place, but I think it's white grape juice; also a little dry white wine, along with a very grassy flavor. Some sweetness, but strong bitterness. Nice aftertaste, maybe some wood notes (cherry or cedar?) after the bitterness fades a bit. Mouthfeel is a little over-carbonated. Seems like a well-made IPA, just not my favorite flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"Went and checked the date and it is not old. Bummer, just did not like this one. May not buy again after all."
""
""
"O) A well crafted IPA. Drinkable. Not too ridiculous on the hops. Well balanced. I'd definitely drink another one."
""
"Really good IPA. Not overly hopped, but there is still a lot of happiness there. The hops add more bitterness than flavor but not an unpleasant or overwhelming bitterness. There is definitely still flavor there as well. It leaves a very pleasant and subtle after taste. Definitely an enjoyable IPA that is not harsh at all."
"VERY SOLID IPA. A fridge staple."

"Best by 7/14 on bottle. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a big creamy white head. Nice lacing left on the glass but only moderate retention. Aroma is more an undefined sweet, but there are some nice citrus hops notes initially that sort of faded away. The taste isn't bad, but it seems to be lacking from what it claims to be. Again with the nondescript sweetness and some earthy hops. There's a decent weight to the body. I was expecting more"

"An enjoyable IPA that blends American and British influences, more earthy and malt character than typical, meshed with lots of bitterness. Complexity on the palate is really inspiring, quite tasty and exceeded my expectations going in. Definitely worth a try, really solid IPA from Smutty, good heft and flavour, balance is on point. Amarillo hops worked well. Bitterness is strong, but different hop profile make this quite exciting. Worth checking out."

"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. Well, certainly the freshest IPA I've ever had out of a bottle. Drink by date is July 2014. Having said that, I think this is a rather pedestrian attempt at a bigger, bolder IPA. I know, I'm finally unlocking my inner pretentiousness! Not a bad beer, not at all, but not as world classy as portrayed. A good session IPA, for sure."

"Heard tons of good things about this beer, so when I finally saw it, I had to get it. Looks like your standard IPA, clear and golden, I was actually expecting sediment, due to reviews and what it says on the box, but its clear as day. Smell is a bit lacking, hops are there but not what Id call the ""finest kind"". Mouthfeel is great, just what I look for and expect in a beer. Taste... hmm I have to taste it over and over again. Something is lacking here. It is crazy bitter, like the white part of a grapefruit. I think they must have done all their hopping at the beginning of the boil, its like they forgot the other additions. Its solid, and I like it. Will I buy it again? probably not."
""
""
""
"O: Its an alright IPA nothing I would jump through hoops for."
""

"Overall, this one is a welcome addition to the reviewer here in Michigan. Following a self imposed hiatus from the imbibing craft brews, sheer delight rose up within him when he found it was at long last available upon the shelf at his favorite bottle peddler. Alas, this is an exciting prospect upon his return and shall find a place in the cooling unit with regularity. Make MINE a Smutty! Cheerios to Smuttynose!"

"Hazy orange pour into a chilled pint glass. Nice thick head which slowly dissipates. Good lacing throughout. Lots of cloudiness from floaters. On the nose, pineapple/orange/apricot scents, coupled with dank earthy herbal tone. On the palate, lots of fruit up front, as well as a hint of caramel/toffee, but then a bitter herbal piney/grapefruit finish. Mouthfeel was average, with strong carbonation. Overall, good but not great. Frankly, I was a little disappointed. Will give it another try soon, as palate fatigue may have compromised my senses. Will reach for it again."

"O: A great deal at its price; a super solid IPA all around. Not particularly original but is a solid fridge rotation for an IPA lover."
""

"O- A decent IPA, but the ""floaties"" are a bit of a turn off for me. I hope to find this one on-tap somewhere as I can avoid the ""floaties"". I understand that it is unfiltered but I guess I'm not used to seeing this in an IPA. Maybe if I can get my hands on some Heady Topper I'll change my mind."

"First time to try this brewery. Quit happy with the brew. Orange yellow color with a nice full white head. Nice lacing on the glass. First smell is of citrus hops and some malt. Smells of a summer day. Mouth is fresh and sharp. Nice carbonation also. The flavors are hops on the citrus side. Some pine needle spice which adds to the light biter flavors.Did I mention the hops, they seem to explode in your mouth. Very enjoyable with my fish dinner."
""
"UPDATE 10/31/14: Acquired three more bottles in a variety pack three weeks ago.  Best by 3/17/15, so probably a month and a half old.  Hops are more pleasant and overall the brew is tastier than suggested by my earlier review.  So I'm raising my rating for taste and overall  from 3.75 to 4.0 and smell from 3.5 to 3.75 based on a combination of bready malt and piney hops.."

"In the last 10 years I have been pleasantly surprised with bitter flavors that IPAs have provided. Smuttynose IPA ""Finest Kind"" is one of my favorites. I would rate this alongside Samuel Adams Lattitude 48 IPA and Mojo India Pale Ale (Boulder Beer Company). Very crisp, fresh and delicious."

""

""

"I am not sure how this is rated 100. It has a very unbalanced bitterness. It's possible ai got a bad batch? It did improve slightly once poured into a glass versus directly from the bottle. As a lover of big IPA's this one was mildly disappointing."

""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a one-finger white foamy head that quickly dissipates. Nice lacing. Faint floral aroma. Taste can best be described as bitter - at the front and finish. Little malt to speak of. Light bodied with moderate carbonation and dry finish make this IPA very drinkable. Overall, a supremely well crafted IPA."

"Pours a cloudy golden color with visible yeast sediment in suspension. Full, well-structured ivory colored foam. Nose is stubborn, a bit bready with citrus tones. Presents a strong malt backbone that transitions to a powerful pine hoppiness, drying to a pleasantly bitter finish. Feel is maybe a little thin but still crisp. A nice choice for an American-brewed IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good ipa. Good sweet hop flavor up front that finishes with a good bitter hop punch. Well balanced with subtle honey and plum sweetness from the malt. Very hop forward ipa and very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll chalk this one up to a difference in tastes. It scores highly and I know it's generally well regarded. Not bad but this seems to focus much more on hop bitterness than the juicy hop flavors I prefer. While there is technically nothing wrong with it, this is a one time purchase for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a damn good IPA, not my favorite, but worth adding to your sampled catalog."
""
"This beer has everything that you would want in regards to its hop character. For many that is why they drink an IPA. I personally prefer to have a rich malty body to complement the hops. I don't think that this beer pulls that off. To me is was a bit off balanced. They should have either toned down the hops of added more rich flavored malts. But if hops are your thing and that's all you need than try this one out. The spicy hops will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid IPA, but there are many many more that I would choose ahead of this one. I can't help wonder if mine has a couple months on it, because I don't get the juicy fruit explosion that I read about in other reviews. The fact that it's still good, even if different, is the sign of a well-crafted IPA."

"O: Feeling IPA fatigue? Think hoppy beers are getting a little too one-dimensional? Then get your hands on (at least) a bottle of Finestkind. It’s not a barrage of hop flavors – though that can be nice sometimes – but rather a beer for which hops are a tool, a means to a drinkable, balanced end. Because of that, this is the perfect six-pack IPA; I could never see myself growing tired of this brew."

"O - I really dont see why this IPA is ranked so high, this has a really odd taste and spell that really turns me off. Wont be having Round 2 on this."
""
"Pours a cloudy gold with adequate head and leaves impressive lacing! The best part of this beer is the unfiltered goodness! This is the most noticeably unfiltered IPA I've ever had! Smells complex; some floral, piney, grapefruit; well done! Taste is a cross between an East Coast and West Coast IPA; can't quite pinpoint what other beer this reminds me of. The feel is superb; outstanding carbonation, brilliant residual hop presence on the palate! Not a bad value at $10 a sixer for this beer!"

"Poured into McDonald's collector's glass (I'm...away from my glassware at the moment). Clear golden yellow/orange with some suspended sediment and a thick fluffy white head that stays around and leaves tons of awesome lacing. Smell is dank hops with some crackery buttery malts in the background. Taste is likewise; buttery cracker malts with bitter herbal hops. An excellent IPA with a great creamy but medium bodied mouthfeel."
""
""
"I had this beer on tap at the West Reading Tavern in West Reading, PA. Great summer beer! Don't let the light appearance fool you! This beer packs a lot of flavor dispite it's light beer color. Nice citrus bitterness on the front with a spicy longlasting lingering finish! Great mouth feel. Not a real hoppy beer but you hopheads won't be disappointed! Smuttynose has another winner!"

"Very interesting that this starts more like a British IPA that keeps climbing its bittering hops till American standards. A plane from UK to US. Great for the comrades that like bitter aftertastes and floral hops on a malty beer. At a later stage, made me sneeze a few times, this is my thermometer for bitterness."
""
""
""

"This stands out for me being a really strongly bitter IPA. There’s some balance with the caramel sweetness, but the bitterness is one of the biggest I’ve had for an IPA. I prefer a more West Coast style, but interesting enough. I recommend it."

"Pours a hazy sunshine yellow with fantastic retention and lacing. It couldn’t be more attractive in the glass. Nice yeast floating there suspended. Nose is more understated than I expected. Subtle, floral, grapefruit & pine. A confident malt presence as well. Taste is grand with malt character that offers up some honey sweetness, biscuit and grain to contend forcefully with an expansive hop profile. They rise up to the malt with earthly,floral and grapefruit finish that’s tremendously dry and bitter and leaves you with a good pucker. A rambunctious IPA whose flavors all play off one another so well. Would definitely buy this again and again."

"O - Edited: From disappointment to a staple in my IPA rotation. This beer has been growing on me throughout the year as the more tropical IPAs have been losing their appeal.

""
""

""
"I know it is one of the finer IPA's...I am not a 'hoppy' guy but I can drink this if served to me...impressive for an IPA....Smuttynose rarely disappoints me. It was refreshing and had a citrus after-taste. Probably more bitter than I like but that is the nature of IPA's. I will probably buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great ipa that's stands out from the crowd. The color, smell, mouthfeel blend excellently."
""
""
""
"O: Full disclosure I had a couple of these after moving furniture for several hours so I was quite thirsty. It was not what I wanted at the time (not thirst quenching). Nonetheless, this is a different IPA and not quite like any other I have had before. I suppose this is an East coast IPA, which is not a bad thing."

"Simply put, the Smuttynose Finest Kind IPA is a standout East Coast IPA for those who love the West Coast style. It's pale golden, unfiltered, and the flavors are beautifully integrated, as indicated by the unique aroma and taste. It combines fruity and vegetal qualities nicely. Perhaps the best thing about it is its long-lasting, gloriously bitter and hoppy finish. Unusually pungent for an East Coast brew, Smuttynose is one of the few East Coast breweries to really get an IPA right. A must try for all true hopheads."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is bitter on the acidic citrus/grapefruit hops, with a nice dose of sweet and sticky malts to balance it out a bit. Finestkind isn't a hop-bomb by any means, but it is a solid American IPA."
""
""
"SOUNDS LIKE... you gotta get this one fresh. Check the date as the reviews are great when fresh."
""
""
"Well I have purchased this for the last few years... It seems to have changed a lot in the last couple, I guess it is time to stop buying it. I know they changes something, it used to have floaties fresh and now it does not at 3 months..."
"Overall this is a good IPA but just not the flavor profile I look for in my IPAs nowadays. These intense grapefruit and pine flavors were fine when they were novel, but now I would much rather prefer a more aroma forward or balanced offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad IPA, easy to drink, hints of diversity and a telling smoothness."

"Gorgeous hazy burnt orange in color with a frothy head. Very citrusy lots of grapefruit delicious IPA very refreshing! Mouthfeel is gritty and highly carbonated - you can tell how fresh this beer is. Highly recommend with some smoked chipotle salsa"
"O: a really good IPA - a good go-to kinda beer - definitely has an American workingman-beer feel, and I guess that was the idea... Thought the appearance was a little off-putting for an IPA, but that's just my opinion (I infer that they were going for that from the description provided)."

"O- I gotta admit I used to hate on Smuttynose IPA, but now I'm thinking it's because had older bottles. The bottle I'm drinking now is extremely fresh and I think it really makes a difference; this is definitely an IPA that must be drank fresh. It's damn good folks. If you love the grapefruit forward IPAs look no further. When I say I can drink this all day I really mean it. An IPA worth rambling over!"
""
""
""

"The balance in the taste is wonderful: slight bitterness, grapefruit-citrus, malt, and a floral character combine for an excellent finish. The nose and taste continue and become more pronounced with warming. Highly recommended."

"What a let down."
""
""

"12pt bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on sep´12. Pale gold in color. Crystal clear appearance. Close & dense crown, white in color. Citric, floral & resiny aromas. Balanced mixture of hop & malt flavor lingers from the upfront into the middle. Flavorful body, moderate to soft carbonation. Oily texture. Resiny finish. Undoubtedly refreshing beer!"
""
""
"Overall, a great IPA; one I would return to regularly, though I can't imagine finishing half a case in one night (as occurred on the ski trip!)."
""
"O: I don't know what is going on with this beer. In times past this has been super hop forward, strongly bitter with big pine and medium citrus. This bottle is subdued and mild. It actually feels like a hopped up pilsner over an IPA. I am really disappointed with this bottle. I'll have to revisit this beer in a few months."

"This beer pours up a medium gold with a one finger white head, not much retention, and bits of lacing. The smell is a fresh citrus, pine, oak, and resin. Taste is very sweet with notes of pineapple followed by grapefruit and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is nice, about the right amount of carbonation and neither too thin nor two thin. This is a solid offering."

"Certainly a good IPA, but nothing overly special (at least with my sample bottle). Hop aroma wasn't there like many other people report, but the bittering effect is and mixes nicely with the relatively rich, malt character of the beer. Sure, I'll have another..."

"What a damn good IPA. It's not the MOST bitter thing I've had, but the bitterness is unique and it remains strong for the entire duration of the brew. Nice light citrus to back it up, too. Pale malts? Yeah, maybe. But who needs 'em? This is a nice IPA for the bitter loving freaks out there."
"O: this is a very well made well balanced IPA, scents and flavors are subtle and complex, this is a truly amazing beer"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/26/2013. Pours cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, pineapple, grapefruit, citrus rind, floral, pine, grass, bread, light caramel, and earthy hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pine, citrus rind, pineapple, bread, floral, grass, light caramel, and piney spiciness. Nice amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice hop flavor balance and complexity; with just enough malt balance to not be overpowering; and minimal cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. Great balance and complexity of hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected."

"One thing I will point out about this IPA compared to other popular and delicious IPAs, this beer saturated the palate. I mean, complete flavor saturation. It felt like every portion of my mouth was completely covered by flavor, and it was consistent. Comparable to Stone'e Ruination in that department."
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a very drinkable, very bitter American IPA that is really an absurd value, when fresh. (Finestkind usually goes for $8-9/ sixer in my area, so that’s pretty damn good.) Sometimes when people talk about East Coast IPAs being too sweet and malt-forward, I think they’re just talking about some old bottle of 90 Minute they had. If those same folks had a fresh bottle of Finestkind, I’m pretty sure they’d be singing a different tune."

"Definitely up there with the Bell's Two-Hearted & Stone IPA for me, & I've become a big fan of the style in the last year. This one's definitely a keeper!"

"found this to be more of an american pale ale than an ipa, but its real good nonetheless. pours a really clear light golden color, surprising for an unfiltered ale, smallish white head on top but excellen lacing is left behind. the nose is a little bland, no czech pils malts mixed in among the high test hops, which smell better and pretty fresh. the flavor is bitter tall the way through, nice hop varietals here, some citrus and some grassy hayfield type stuff, but all with bitter leanings. indeed there is a czech or german pilsner malt in here, providing a light crackery profile, which is unique in an ipa these days. good carbonation and a really light body for the style, plenty drinkable, would never guess the abv is pushing 7%. it feels good, it drinks good, its a litle strange, its a nice beer all up."
""
"Overall - A great example of an American IPA. Starts with nice balance, but ends strong and bitter. It doesn't kill me that this isn't readily available on the West Coast, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't want it to be."
""
"O: A fine, standard IPA, nothing mind-blowing but a really drinkable and tasty brew. Too bad the aroma doesn't match the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a totally balanced and tasty IPA. I would buy this again for sure."
""
""
"O: An extremely consistent, well-crafted IPA. Can't beat it. Certainly an ""east coast"" IPA that has more malt and balance with a very different hop profile. Not a hop heads ideal choice but an easy and well drinking beer nonetheless. Great for when you want hops but not a hop smack. Key to this beer...drink fresh!"

"O- I feel this bottle might be a little past its date.. I would like to get my hands on a freshy to try her out again."

"Flavor covers the whole mouth and lingers long past the swallow. I'm very much enjoying this beer, and hadn't realize what a gem I'd open for a nightcap. My next trip East will demand as much extra room in the luggage as possible; thoughts of this will haunt me until I get this one fresh!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this before plenty of times on draft. I find that draft is a lot better than bottle. Beer is best before 3/18/13, so I am not sure where the flavor profile went. Will drink it on draft from now on."

"O. A solid East Coast IPA. Very well balanced and a good example of the style. A good go-to IPA."

"Overall this is a solid IPA. I drink so many citrus bombs that I really enjoy having an IPA that also throws in some different hop qualities as well as a bit of malt to appreciate. Balanced yet plenty bitter. Happy to have tried it."
"Amazing and easy drinking IPA. Exactly what an IPA should be. One of my favorites for sure."
"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. This is becoming my go to beer in place of Sierra Nevada (still a big favorite of mine). It is readily available in the Boston area and has that nice lingering bitterness that you get from the hoppy beers. A little lighter in color than a Dogfish 60 or Sierra Nevada, but has that same great aftertaste. Looking forward to the next one in a few minutes."

"The finest kind is an East Coast treasure, prompting lucid dreams of resinous pine hops, instilling such desire for this particular brew that one will use it as a measuring stick for any IPA. While not my number one IPA, it may be my number two. So consistent. So bitter. And I love that damn label!"
""
"Poured this into a pint glass, it has a nice traditional IPA colored body which is a nice orange color body with a nice 2"" white foamy head that just hangs out. The smell is, you guessed it piney of hops with some citrus and pale malt coming through also. The taste just hits your tonuge like a blast of nice bitter hops with a nice grapefruit flavor closer to the back of the tongue. The mouthfee is great, nice and smooth, coats the tongue real nice and overall a damm good IPA, one of the better ones i have had."

"O-Smutty shows that the North East is no slouch when it comes to hop-head brews. Very very nice I will certainly have again"
"OVERALL: A good beer, but the bitterness is just a little too forward and seems to wash out some of the other flavors. A little more malty sweet flavor after the swallow would help this one a bit. That said, this is a good beer and many hopheads will be glad to drink it in mass quantities."

"O: There's almost no point in reviewing this beer--it's different every time. Oddly, it's much tastier when I really focus on it than when I just drink it."
""
""
""
"Taste has a nice, bitter hop bite, followed up by a great malt backbone. Feel is very good, has a good, slick and oily feel about it. This, in my opinion, is one of the best east coast IPAs that I've had the pleasure to sample. Great stuff."
""
"Hazy deep blonde colour, one finger of white head with some lace. Smell is quite hoppy, heavy n the citrus fruit, grapefruit, orange, pineapple all present, a light malt note follows and is present throughout. Taste again has lots of citrus as well as pine flavours, orange and grapefruit, very bitter throughout and finishes quite dry. Light-med carbonation, quite oily, medium body. This is a great east coast IPA, very enjoyable and something I could drink a whole bunch of."
"O: Definitely an IPA for those who enjoy bitter beers. This is about as easy to drink as you're going to get with the abv approaching 7% and having 75 IBU's. Definitely worthy of a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is as good as it gets with a great domestic IPA. Unless you are going for a robust DIPA, this is a great example of how the east coast can make balanced IPA's."

"Overall I am surprised at how good this IPA is. I feel like it holds true to the IPA roots without trying to overwhelm your taste buds."
"I've had this beer on many occasions, and every time the flavor seriously reminds me of biting into a grapefruit. This is not particularly hoppy, with exception of the massive grapefruit flavor. It's overly one dimensional. Good, but not my favorite."
"Pours a cloudy light copper with a finger of head that enjoyed some decent retention time and left nice lacing in its wake. The nose is surprisingly more malt forward than hop forward, but the hops are there. The flavor profile is very well balanced with a delectably bitter hop punch on the finish. This is a solid offering for a single IPA. At or very near the top of the style for me."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the brews along with Hop Stoopid that got me hooked on IPAs. A good gateway beer into the style."

"D- Not drinkable. It’s not too heavy, it just tastes like failure. While I wouldn't necessarily call myself a ""hop head," I've had and enjoyed hoppier beers than this. This is my review after trying two of these. I realize my review differs greatly from others. Hoping I just got bad six pack."
"O-I've had this one quite a few times and have yet to get tired of it. Unfiltered and tasty. One of the best IPAs out there. Coats the tongue in malts and finishes with a nice maltiness."
""
""
""
"I still stand by my statement that this is the most bitter IPA ive had."
""
"Verdict: This is solid stuff from Smuttynose, nothing pretentious here, just a good, easy to drink IPA. It’s a bit malt heavy for my liking, but this makes for a great beer for someone easily put off by very hoppy beers, and a great beer to crack open after a day’s work."
""
""
"Medium bodied with solid carbonation and a dry finish. Crisp and clean with a small dose of lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. A solid IPA but nothing to get too excited about in my book. Not particularly distinguished in a crowded field but will appeal to those looking for a more balanced, less bitter IPA. No hop bomb, this."
"Overall: Its on the edge of being an IPA palate wrecker. Smells way better than it tastes; the nose was the high point of this beer. It was enjoyable and a nice price point on this beer as well. Great offering from the east coast!"

"Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip, pours a nice darker orange color- good head, nice retention. Pretty cloudy. Sweet bready malts, orange peel, but really not much more here. Taste- deep bitterness on the tip of the tongue and back of my mouth, Balanced somewhat by a nice sweet orange/citrus malt backbone. This is pretty hoppy/bitter, and the hops win in the balance here bigtime. Pretty tight carbonation, this stays pretty airy and drinkable. I like the mouthfeel- pretty medium bodied. This is a nice IPA, but not sure I would give it an A+ as others (incl the bros) did. I like it, but don't see that its hype worthy. Solid B+ IPA."
""
""
"Overall – A nice IPA that is quite easy to drink. It has a good flavor with the only thing taking away from the taste being a lack of good transition and variety. Overall however it is very nice."

"-A-Bomb"
"Fans of the style should have no reservations about trying this beer. It would make a great go-to IPA and I may like it a little better than SN Torpedo. It has a nice kick of hops, yet is still very drinkable and refreshing and doesn't wreck your palate. Well done!"
""
"originally reviewed: 03-08-2011"
"Finest kind indeed. I'd never had thought that a bottle with two old men in folding chairs on it could be damn near world class. Smuttynose IPA really makes a solid case for a simply American IPA and is definitely worth the drink."
""
""
"O: Probably the freshest bottle of this particular beer that I’ve managed to get and it made a noticeable difference. It’s signature is the intense hop flavor but, to be honest, this beer does little to set itself apart from other top-notch IPAs. A beer that I’d be happy to be handed at a party, but wouldn’t go out of my way to obtain."

"O: Solid IPA – great hoppy brew."
""
""
""

"Ov: This is an exquisite and romantic IPA. It makes love to your tongue, excites your palate and reminds you that if you were stuck on an island, you'd want a knife, a fishing rod, a gorgeous woman and beer like this. Maybe some rum too but that is debatable. Cheers!"

"Not my favorite IPA. It's decent, with good hop aromas, but the flavor is simple and doesn't do it for me. Not well balanced, and the bitterness has a sharpness to it that I don't like. It definitely improves some as it warms up, gaining some fullness and losing some of that sharpness. But I'm still not overly impressed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This a great example of an IPA, good amount of bitters, and nice malt at the beginning which is not always found in an IPA."
"O - I ended up being a lot more impressed than I thought I would be (as I purchased this on a discounted New England craft night). It's a very nice IPA which I plan on drinking again in the near future."

"Overall this is a pretty nice IPA. Would drink it again for sure."

"O - Finestkind is definitely one of the finest of its kind. A great East Coast IPA that is one to keep on the regular rotation of IPAs. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Oh yeah, I really enjoy this one - in the right time and place, I could enjoy 3-4 of these in a sitting. Who says there are no good east coast IPAs on the market?!"
""
""
""
"O: Really good with a nice amount of complexity and balance in the flavors. The hops flavors are slightly too intense for this to be a sessionable beer but it is definitely one that I will be having again. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic and unique IPA that has a bready/cracker sweet malt body with a huge pine, grapefruit, stone fruit hop character."
""
""
"I've waited to do this. It's been a long drive down the road to hop heaven. I've tasted IPA's, DIPA's, IIPA's by the dozens, and become time-honored intimate with twenty to thirty specific varieties, from all over the country. What makes this IPA sooo good is the slightly different profile that separates it from the over copied (albeit tasty) northwestern IPA's. The beauty of the unfiltered murk and the super sudsy, Victorian-lace producing head, all adds to the occasion, making this a quite attractive beer. Odors are pungent and floral. White grapefruit resides in a sap-like chewiness. And best of all??? This ale is dynamite when served both room temp and ice-cold. This beer is not only for hop lovers, but for artisans who really appreciate what goes into a perfect session. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - After a pretty underwhelming aroma, both the taste and feel save this beer. I have no idea where the almost 7% ABV went; I can’t pick it up anywhere. If you’re looking for a very drinkable and bitter beer, this is it."

""
""
""
""
""

" Enjoyable will continue to purchase"
"O: this is a decent selection for an IPA. I would have this again."
""
""
"O: A great beginner IPA for anyone. Has much more bite than an apa bit still very manageable."
"O - I've never been blown away bu this beer, even when its super fresh. It is a great beer to turn to. A very bitter and grapefruit heavy IPA that can be found in every grocery store in New England."
""
""
""
""
""

"this has a similar balance to stone ipa, and a slightly more floral nose, dulled just a bit by a maltiness that again can come off skunky. still very drinkable."

" Overall (4.5) This really is an IPA of the finestkind, standing out from its pine & citrus hop monster contemporaries. Smuttynose IPA sets the standard in paying homage to the British origins of the style, while still adding a distinctly American spin. As far as the appearance, taste, and mouthfeel go, I honestly can't imagine how they could be improved upon at all. My only complaints are the understated aroma and the fact they don't distribute to California. Overall, it is the definitive example of its class: British IPA by way of American IPA."
"Pours a hazy orange with plenty of thick white head and floating chunks of sediment. Lacing sticks all the way down the glass. Smells of grapefruit, citrus rind, pine, and a touch of grain. Taste of sharp bitterness, intense hop flavor and grapefruit rind. Dry crisp mouthfeel with lingering grapefruit and hop bitterness. No question this is my favorite Smuttynose brew and one of my favorite IPAs."
""
"Pours a golden copper with a foamy head. Aroma has that bright grapefruit aspect that is very promising. Resinous hop aroma detected as well. The flavor and mouthfeel had me a little disappointed, being very dry and more on the 'piney' side. Different kind of bitterness than I expected. It was by no means 'bad,' but I think perhaps that this bottle was not as fresh as it could be."

"Cask pour served in a true pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed honey-gold coloring with a frothy, bubbly, off-white head of about a half an inch. Aromas are flying off this brew, with a hoppy, citrus, and pepper blend that has a strong resiny overtone. Flavors are more subtle with the cask serving, with a roasty undertone giving rise to the wet, resiny, cedar hops profile that fuels the tastebuds. Light toffee backbone boosts the grapefruit highlights amongst the bitter and rich hops. This tastes great on cask. Bitter and resiny aftertaste, it's like chewing on a cedar and pine air freshener. The body is light and extremely smooth from the cask pour. The finish starts creamy smooth, then shifts quickly to a drying bitter end. Delicious!"
"O: an impressive effort start to finish. A very good representation of the style. Happy with the purchase and looking forward to the rest of the six pack."

"This was an ok IPA. The only other beer I could compare this to is the Harpoon IPA. I don’t know if that's a compliment or an insult. Regardless - It’s a very light IPA that may appeal to the Belgian Pale lovers out there."
"overall this is just ok for me, had it super fresh last year, got more of the grapefruit blast. if you love grapefruit, get this super fresh. ill pass next time."
""
""
""

"O: Overall, this is a good IPA that I find myself coming back to fairly often.  Lacks the complexities and citrus punch of my favorite IPAs, but certainly a well above average offering of one of my favorite styles.  "
""
""
""
"O: Tasty and easy going IPA, not too heavy or bitter, great straightforward representation of the style"
""
""
"O: This is a great IPA. The hoppy bitterness and citrusy flavors come together to create a wonderful tasting beer."
""
"This is a decent IPA. All the right elements are in place. The malt character is big, bready and forward. The hop presence is balanced, bitter, and delicious. This is a nice beer that I will definitely have again."
""
""
""
"Flavor has a slight pale malt sweetness at first, quickly segueing in dominant bitter hops, enamel stripping alpha acids and bitter herbaceousness. A light biscuity breadiness flashes by in the middle, with a deeply resiny and bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied with medium carb levels, easy to drink. Definitely an amped up bitterness to this, one for the hopheads out there."

"A very nice IPA."

"Overall, pretty good IPA. The floral and earthy element gives it some British aspects, though it is certainly an American IPA."
""
""
"Received in a trade from Colby, thanks man. Poured from bottle with clear dates on the edge of the label but no detectable notch so I cannot confirm how fresh this beer is. The beer pouts a mostly clear copper orange color with a nice 1.5 finger head with good retention an solid lacing. There is a notable amount of suspended clutter in the beer, perhaps an old bottle? The aroma is a blend of toasted malt and earthy hops, the hops actually take a back seat to the malty character which is almost burnt in aroma, interesting. The flavor follows suit with a malty forward prescense and residual sweetness. Medium bitterness. The hops are dominated by malt throughout, makes me wonder how old this bottle is after reading other reviews. The beer is medium bodies with good carbonation. Overall I think this is an old bottle as it doesn't correlate with other reviews."
""
""
"O: I found this to be an easy drinking IPA that is packed with hops but isn’t overly bitter. The floral hops are an interesting change of pace compared to all of the grapefruit hops currently available on the market. The alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
"Orange with a small white head that does not stick around. Taste is of hops with elements of flowers, celery, grass, citurs and grapefruit. Slight malty undertones are present. Medium mouthfeel with a nice lingering bitterness. Great full-bodied IPA."

"O: Very good beer, great IPA."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice dark golden color with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly but has nice lacing. Has a nice piney wood smell. Tastes of hops and more hops with a light sense of malt, but definitely hop dominated. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation is right, and goes down great with no bad aftertastes. Overall, a very nice beer."
""
"O - Pretty, pretty good. A great American IPA with a boatload of hops. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable. Smuttynose hasn't disappointed me yet."

"Very nice IPA. Somewhere between an American IPA and an English IPA. It has more malt sweetness and sharper hops than most English IPAs, but it's not quite as sweet as many American IPAs. It is a perfect pairing for spicy foods and for the price there are few IPAs this good."

"Overall - The bitterness gets pretty intense long into the finish on this one. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a very hop-forward ale, with lots of floral, grassy and piney hop profiles. Citrus is there too, along with some dry bready malt characters. I personally would like a little more sweetness, but for those who don't like sweetness but do like strong hop flavors will love this."
"The flavor is kind of raw. You get a ton of hop flavor, but there is a pretty decent dose of bitterness as well. It doesn't quite work out for balance. Still, it was a very good IPA. I enjoyed this glass, and I plan to pick up a six pack in the future."
"O: Generic for an IPA, but holds its ground. Nothing out of the ordinary and I think I prefer 60min, but this is good. B+"

"I loved this when I lived in SC. Then I had it closer in proximity to it's brewery (brewery is in NH, I was in D.C. a lot closer than where I reside) and wow! Finest Kind fresh is amazing."
""
""
""
""
"I can't believe it took me so many years to try this one. Lives up to the hype. Almost certainly among the top three american IPAs I've ever had the pleasure to try. Outstanding."
""
""
"Medium texture to the mouthfeel and very drinkable. Glad this is distributed in our area now. Will be a regular in my rotation for sure."

"Overall: I think I may be missing some of the hop nuances, but this is a well made and tasty IPA. Would seek out again, especially if fresh."

"O: 4"
""

""
"Tastes like a citrusy hop dipped in malt. You really get that nice citrusy hop flavor right off the bat, but it uncovers the bit of malty center. Nice balance and very drinkable. This is a really great east coast IPA and worthy of its world class ranking."

"I've had this beer over the years since the original release, and even though it has been drastically inconsistent in both bottle and draft format, I think its time to write this one off as inconsistency has seemed to just become consistent mediocrity in recent years. Light non-descript hop aroma mixes with sulfur. Somewhat astringent bitterness offset by a sweetish malt background that bored. No juicy, citrusy, grapefruit, or pine hop aroma or flavor it once had that made this beer interesting. Bet buy date notched May 2012, so this can't be that old. At $9.50 a six pack not worth the chance that it might actually be good to bother anymore."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a super solid IPA. Cy and Paul on the label, for me this is America in a bottle."
""
""
"O - Solid IPA."
""
""
"Poured into mug, frothy offwhite two finger head, foggy orange body with carb and sediment. Flowery and sweet citrus juice aromas, and a ghost of bitterness. Taste is a mouthful of grapefruit. Lingering aftertaste of dry hops and alcohol but not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best IPA's you can get your hands on. Enough hops and malt to balance each other out. When you're done with the first, you're kind of upset you finished it so fast -- that's what six packs are for."

""
""
""
"I would recommend a fresh Smutty to IPA drinkers everywhere."

"12 ounce bottle, bottle is stamped best before 04/18/12, bought as a single bottle in a pick a 6 pack at my local Kroger. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head and some sediment floaties noticeable. The head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. The brew smells like floral and light citrusy (orange peel, grapefruit) hops, along with some sweet malt. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel malt. There's also a nice long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has good carbonation. Overall this is a good, solid IPA. I'd buy this again in the future, it's definitely worth a try."
""
"Pours a hazy amber gold with a generous two inch head that dissipates slowly. This is a very balanced IPA. While the hop presence is there it is not overwhelming. It keeps it carbonation well. Due to its balance this is a very easy drinking IPA. When I'm buying an out of state IPA, I will definitely repeat this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Surprisingly stellar taste from an IPA that lacks much aroma. Very similar tasting to Dogfish Head 60 Minute to me and well worth trying. You can't help but smile looking at the label."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh, I dont have anything against the brewery itself I just honestly haven't found a beer from them that I've liked yet."
""
"Overall- Much more flavor from the hops would serve this beer well. They have obviously used the bittering hops to great effect. The feel is all right for an IPA; it just really misses with the flavor hops."

"Smuttynose looks great, with ample head sitting atop a clear, golden straw coloured body. I made the mistake of tasting this beer before smelling it, so I'm having a hard time detecting much of anything. All I can say is that it doesn't smell bad. The taste, however, is ridiculous. As in good. Huge citrus/pine flavour present due to some amazing hops. My guess would be cascade or something similar. Super bitter, and yet you can still detect a balancing malt presence. Almost perfect. Nice mouthfeel, dry, good carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent IPA. One of the best I have had. I will definitely be buying more of this."

"Highly drinkable, I like the fact that the ABV isn't too high. I'm so glad my local grocer has decided to carry this, I will buy it as long as they carry it."

"Poured into a standard nonic pint glass with about two fingers of foam atop a clear golden beverage. Not a big hoppy aroma but oh, the taste! There’s a bit of a grapefruit citrus sting with a biscuity malt backbone that holds up to the hop assertiveness. Piney, chewy, resiny, oily, sharp, flavorful."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Great IPA overall. Really think the grapefruit flavors set it apart from other IPAs. Pretty good balance of malt and hops. Thought it would be hop heavy from the aroma, but the taste proved to be a nice balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - This is a nice beer. Nice showcase of pine and grassy hop bitterness. Excellent look and feel. To me, the nose and the flavor left a bit to be desired, but I wouldn't pass on it had I the chance to try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This is a great American IPA. It is heavily one sided on hops, but that's what I expect from an American IPA. I love Humulus Lupulus and this beer makes good use of them. The lacing on this beer is just wonderful as well and a small head lingered the entire time. This is a great IPA."
""
""
""
"Unimpressed although perfectly drinkable with no off flavors. Not a terribly complex brew. Not sure how they do bottle dating, but this one is still in its window by a couple months so definitely not old. Maybe it's better ultra-fresh."

"2/4/2015: Had this again on tap at Rattle-N-Hum in NYC and it was just as good in every way; fresh citrus and a fine malt backbone made it extremely easy to drink and session worthy."
"VERY solid IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What an awesome IPA. This brew has some very complex taste components. I found this to be very refreshing with citrus, pine and malt melded together in just an outstanding fashion. I did find the scent to be faint and not at all representative of how the beer tastes in the glass. If you like IPA's you can't go wrong with this beauty."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall its just a pretty decent beer...but the taste is very interesting and impressive!"
""
""
"A wonderful IPA. So much interesting hop character. The aroma screams of citrus. The beginning sip has a cascade of hop flavor hit the palate. The malts are around, but not too prominent. So the focus stays on hops. Because its not ""an imperial"" beer, you can have a few of these and enjoy the amazing hops over and over."

"pours a yellowish orange with two fingers of off white head that clings to the glass. smells of citrus hops and orange peel with a sweet malty balance. taste is near perfect. just a nice well balanced sweet citrus and malt blend with a long dry bitter finish. leaves you thirsting for more. mouthfeel is a little oily from the hops but other than that has a good feel with good carbonation. outstanding beer. make mine a smutty!"
"O- One of the best cask experiences I've had. Dry-hopping a beer like FinestKind really pushes it over the edge and makes for a fantastic beer. I'd seek this out again and again."
"O - I know this is a good beer, I know it, but this bottle was just not fresh enough. Unhappy."
"Overall: Probably my favorite East Coast IPA after Flower Power. It won't satisfy maniacal hopheads, but it provides for a fruity, juicy, more balanced IPA than the norm."
"Like It? How Could I Not?"
"o - overall a classic ipa and old standby. always enjoyable and something that is readily available and fresh. love having this one in the fridge."
"This is an excellent ipa. The flavors and aromas are both very big and bold, one that I will continue to purchase."
"O- Good IPA, not great. I would like to try it on tap but with so many IPAs out there to try I won't be seeking it out."
"The carbonation in this porter was very nice leading to light creaminess. The body was thin, but as the beer warmed, the carbonation weakened allowing the body to become fuller. At 6.5% ABV and composed with 45 IBUs, Founders Porter is an excellent interpretation of a hoppy porter."
"Enjoy."
"Overall, definitely one of the best IPA's I have ever had. So many of those well-known and well-respected IPAs fall into the ""mediocre"" or just ""good"" category for me. This one is definitely ""great"" and has a unique taste that I think they did an awesome job with."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this. As long as you can get this one fresh, it's a pretty solid IPA."
"Over all everything you would want and expect and want from an American IPA is present! No complaints!! Pick some up and enjoy!!"
"0-the best east coast ipa i have tried. really loving this stuff going to be picking this more often when i need a good ipa to settle me kicks."
"One of the best IPAs I have ever had."
"O – Nice beer here and one fine IPA. Has a great strong hope and grapefruit bite that really is an assault. That fades away with just a bit of residual sweetness. Damn easy drinker and wonderfully refreshing. Wish I would have tried this one sooner."
"This is a great IPA. Very nice taste and mouthfeel, really easy to drink."
"Overall, this is a good IPA. The citrus and sweetness of the malts balance the hop bitterness well. However, the bitterness of the finish is quite substantial."
"I really liked this more from cask than from what I've had in the past. The aromas were really good and the feel was very good. This was a real quality IPA"
"O: Probably New englands best standard IPA (along with ipswich and mayflower btw) a true gem, and the best bang for your buck. More of a West Coast IPA, but great execution of hop flavor."
"O - Hop bomb. I would say the bitterness overwhelms almost everything else, possibly even the flavor additions. It would pair up great with something rich or fatty like a prime rib dinner. MMMmmm, prime rib dinner...."
"O: If im drinking an IPA I usually just stick with the DFH 60min, however this is now going to be added to my new arsenal, this is very good and I would reccomend it to all!"
"Pours hazy copper with thinnish white head and lots of floaties. Good lacing though. The aroma is a good yet subdued mix of hops and malt. Citrus hops with some resinous notes. Caramel malt. Strong hops flavor though, quite bitter for an IPA with lots of resinous pine notes. Full body with a chewy mouthfeel. A nice, strong IPA, even if it is a bit unbalanced for its style."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is amazing. Just about medium bodied with quite a bit of fine carbonation. Extremely easy drinking and smooth. Overall, I liked this beer quite a bit. One of the better East coast style IPAs I've had."
"Six pack from Thorpe's in East Greenwich, RI."
"O- Full disclosure: I've been drinking around 3 half racks of this stuff a month for the past year. So, needless to say, I love it. I think it is a near perfect example of an American IPA (or is it perfect?). To top it off, around my side of town it's only $9. Off to have another before bed."
"Overall, this is a really fine IPA, in your face."
"O-A wonderful East Coast IPA. One of the best readily available ones, behind Flower Power."
"O: great ipa, nice and crisp and easily a quick addition to my IPA line up."
"96."
"Pours a beautiful honey gold with a white head that drops to a solid film that laces all the way down the glass. Smell is pungent pine and citrus. The smell carries over well into the taste with a tongue peeling bitterness, grapefruit and tobacco. This is not a subtle IPA. Alcohol presents itself at the very end but is mostly masked by the brutally bitter hop flavors. I will definitely enjoy this one again and again."
"O: overall this is a really solid IPA, for a year round one it's among the best that I have access to."
"O: Very tasty IPA with abundance of flavor and hops bitterness. Would definitely enjoy another. Label is quirky and adds to the gestalt of the beer."
"Overall: Still one of my favorite IPAs. Balanced yet pungent and still drinkable. A staple of mine when I visit the New England area."
"Had one bottle and then it's time for mixing!! Mixed Three F Loyd's Gumball Head and The Finest Kind together!! WOW!! Beer mixing is the next stage in beer!!"
"Thanks Charlie! Definitely glad to have tried this one. Coming from a SoCal guy who is spoiled with the likes of many hoppier offerings...Finest Kind is a decent IPA"
"Taste:"
" Notes: I have to dock it for its appearance, because this truthfully is one of the uglier beers I've seen. The floaties are probably going to turn a lot of people off right away. Thankfully, the look of this beer has absolutely no bearing on the taste. Very, very bitter. Hopheads will be pleased. One of the best widely available IPAs in America."
"O: I love IPAs! Sadly this did not live up to the hype. Tasted zero grapefruit/citrus and the aftertaste/mouthfeel was borderline unappetizing. The only real positive I can say is the definite presence of yeast floaties as well as the beer did get better as it warmed up ; it was nice to see that in an IPA. Should've trusted my gut and stayed away from anything Smuttynose."
"Overall: I'm from the West Coast, but the more that I try hoppy East Coast beers like these, the more that I will commence a civil war in deciding which region I prefer! This is one of the finest IPAs I've had yet, and really wish we got it over in SF."
"Overall - Good, i enjoyed this more from bottle then anytime i had on tap. Plenty of hop kick, and easy to drink. Wish the malts had a little more presence, but none the less, solid. One of the better ipa's out there, but not the best."
"A good IPA, but by no means a standout. Fairly typical IPA appearance (not going to bore you here) with a slight haziness. Flavor is sweet malt and a typical East coast hop profile (lots of Simcoe) as well as some Amarillo, which is more typical of West coasters from what I have seen. Drinkable and satisfying but wont knock your socks off."
"Overall, I killed this thing QUICK. Had to get another. Had to"
"A very pleasant, smooth, and drinkable IPA. I would have appreciated a slight nod to the malt body in the taste, but this is still a very nice IPA."
"A really well made IPA I’m glad to have enjoyed. It does get a bit more hype than needed."
"Pours a hazy yellow straw color with some odd floaties swirling around in the body. After seeing it, I suspected yeast, but I certainly was not expecting it to come out of this bottle otherwise I would have decanted off the top 11 ounces. A finger's-width of foamy white head develops, but subsides relatively quickly. Smells of lemon, grapefruit, hops, pine, and a touch of sugar and clove. Tastes of hops, alcohol, straw, lemon, orange, and some caramelly malt in the rear. Mouth begins with a bitter hop presence, but mellows out in the middle and finishes smooth. An almost soapy aftertaste is left, but it's not entirely unpleasant. Moderate carbonation bubbles off the tongue. Overall, a decent IPA, but I feel there are much better offerings out there that are equally as accessible."
"O: Meh, it's very average in my book."
"Notes: The yeasty particles swirling around are a bit of a turn off, otherwise a good IPA."
"Single bottle purchased at the Cheese Shop in Williamsburg VA. I've wanted to try this for a long time. Forgot to write down the freshness date. Oops. Poured from the bottle into my Geordie Schooner. Golden cloudy color, creamy head and sticky lacing. I didn't get any floaties the others speak of. Aroma was of mild grapefruit and citrusy hops. Taste echoed the aroma. Medium/easy drinking. Overall a delicious IPA but not as powerful as other reviewers led me to expect. Would love to try this on tap."
"O; A good, classic beer. I probably would stay away from this in a bottle as without the aroma being great on tap, I can see how it would be rough out of the bottle for an IPA."
"Overall: This has to be one of the finest IPA's I've had in recent memory."
"Poured into a 13oz tulip glass. This is my most consumed beer since joining BA. Can always find it fresh & $10.99-12.99 a 12, best value going. Pours a very hazey yellow orange, with a fairly sticky, one inch white head with a gentle pour. Smell is of pungent grapefruit, pine, and pineapple. The beer is only 3 weeks old, such a great use of IBU's. The taste is even bolder then the smell. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. I sometimes take this beer for granted, I am so lucky to have fresh Finestkind when ever I want."
"O - overall this is a fine pale ale. I am not sure if there is something with freshness going on here to produce those large floating masses, but thankfully they settle and don't bother you. The bit of oxidation at the end was the other clue that something is up with this bottle despite it being sooner than it's freshness date. Despite all of that, it is a nice hoppy beer with enough fruityness to added a dimension. Would be very easy to drink . . . minus the floating chunks."
"D: very quality AIPA from smutty. aroma on this thing sets you up for a really great drink. super complex and all over the place aroma and flavor."
"Pours a very, very cloudy copper with loads of yeast just swimming all over the place. The nose is very floral and rich. Grapefruit, pine, honey, green tea, a very broad spectrum of bright, citrus notes. My palate is left reeling, aching with drying acidity, a little hint of bark, and not much sweetness to balance. This is a serious cure for a hop withdrawal. Oh, after finishing the bottle, I had to have a glass of water."
"Very disappointed. Tried a sixer and then a very fresh 12-pack because I thought there must be something wrong with the sixer given an IPA rated this highly. The second batch was the same. So, what's the problem? The hop smell is very subdued, as is the taste. It's a good bitter IPA but without much in the way of aroma or flavor. Maybe I've been converted from this type of IPA by the likes of Flower Power, Sculpin, Racer 5, Hopdevil and a bunch of others."
"This is firmly a medium-bodied beer, but that works here. The malt flavors are mostly pale so the level of viscosity in this beer -- which is greater than I typically like in an IPA -- doesn't get all syrupy like it would in an IPA with more caramel malts. Overall, this is clearly a very solid IPA. I was looking for more, though. Maybe I need to try it fresher, maybe on-tap."
"D - well recommended for hop fans, and anyone trying to make the step up from tamer beers. Few beers this hoppy are also this nicely balanced."
"Mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium with a good amount of carbonation. Leaves a slight, drying bitterness that quickly goes away. This IPA is definitely one needed to come across and try. A gateway into the IPA-world, for sure. Probably as good as the Big A IPA, if not better. #hophead!"
"O - I like this a lot and will definitely enjoy it again"
"Again, Happy IPA Day, while not an amazing IPA definitely one I would buy again."
"O - A solid IPA"
"not horrible.. just not close to the hype"
"Overall a very solid American IPA, with a nearly perfect flavor profile Definitely one to seek out and try."
"Overall - Less aroma and smell and more bitterness,"
"Old heads on the label. 1 1/2 inch solid, not going anywhere for awhile, off-white head. A weird twister of suspended sediment barely drifting down in the hazy amber-orange body. Strong lacing owns the glass. There are grapefruit and piney aromas as well as a malty scent. A pretty pungent IPA with the citrus then sour elements dominating. More bitter this year around. Almost an apricot type sweet note comes through in the mix. A very flavorful brew with a bitter aftertaste lingering. This is a drinkable IPA at 6.9%. Never a dull moment with the Finestkind, another one of my reliable and quick grabs."
"Final Thoughts:Not for me. I can see how some hopheads like this one, but it's not even a good simplistic to me. It's like I'm drinking watered down hop juice, the hop bitter really ruins the IPA. Had it been something that I would have expected such from, I would have enjoyed it more. I enjoyed the many other common offerings of Smuttynose, and this one is my least favorite. I like IPA's, but this one is little malt backbone, not very flavorful, and just hop bite. Tried it July 13th and the freshness is marked for Nov '11. Just not for me I suppose."
"For all the praise this beer gets I was very excited to try it, and it was one of the only 6-packs I purchased, but I was very disappointed. Thought it may be a Northeastern bias but the reviews are pretty consistent, maybe there’s something wrong with me but I thought this was an average IPA at best."
"This is a good thing – last thing you want is an IPA that cloys"
"O: Eh. I'll admit I'm not much of an IPA guy, and this doesn't do anything to change my mind."
"O: Quality stuff. Good all around beer. No complaints anywhere."
"This is one fine IPA."
"M. Smooth, medium bodied, this beer is slightly creamy, and definitely very good. Dries at the end, this only makes you want it more."
"Overall, this is a lush, juicy and very bitter IPA. I appreciate how the malts play a distant second fiddle here, but the star of show could chill a bit on her bitter visage."
"Highly sessionable brew that is really easy going down."
"This is a top notch IPA that is one of the best out there. Great stuff here and sessionable as well."
"Overall, I'd have to say this is one of my favorite IPAs. And it's an East Coast IPA and it could destroy most IPA's on BOTH coasts. I'm lucky as hell to be able to get this at my local craft beer store down here in Florida City. If (God forbid) Smuttynose decided to limit production and I wasn't able to find residence on the nose of a smutty nosed sea monster on the Isle of Shoals, I would definitely look to take up residence somewhere close to brewery so I could enjoy this beer on the regular."
"O-an excellent IPA for drinking with food or enjoying on its own. Well-made beer."
"Overall, I didn't really like this. I didn't hate it either. I think I have reached a point where I have tried so many IPA's (mostly West coast stuff) that it is going to be hard to impress me. I also don't understand why most of the East Coast stuff has to use the Belgian yeast strains they do. In an IPA is does nothing but hurt the flavor profile. With all that being said, I must thank McNuts for this bottle. Liked or disliked it's another notch on my beers tried belt."
"While many other good IPAs have far too much citrusy sweetness for my palate, this one has just the right amount. Just enough to balance while the hoppy bite takes centerstage. If I'm in the mood for a balanced IPA, this is my go-to brew."
"Overall this is a pretty smooth, well-crafted IPA."
"O - Very solid IPA here and I could see drinking a few of these in a sitting. Nice flavor, very smooth, and doesn't go overboard in any regard. A subtle drinker in every way. Well done!"
"The 1st time that I had a sixer of this, I thought it was decent, but nowhere near how good the reviews were giving it...especially the A+ marks given by the 2 bros. So, I thought maybe I had an inferior batch or just not as fresh as it could be. So, I thought I'd buy another six & give it a 2nd chance before I reviewed it. I was hoping to have my mind changed, but it was not to be. Burnt orange in color w/ plenty of unfiltered sediment. Smell was good w/ a citrusy, piny fragrance. The taste, while plenty hoppy, left me w/ a bitterness aftertaste which I'm not a big fan of. I guess I've just been brainwashed by the Left Coast IPA. I wanna be able to have a few beers at a sitting, but the bitterness of this leaves me no choice but to call it quits or switch beers. Overall, not a bad beer, just not my favorite style of IPA."
"Overall, a ridiculously tasty IPA. Fruity, funky and resinous. Delicious."
"O - Its a very refreshing IPA, one which I dont mind drinking out of the bottle if I am in the yard"
"O--This is a high quality IPA. One of my favorites."
"Overall: This beer is pretty good. It isnt as hoppy as I like, but I grew up on beer from San Diego. Thanks to inlimbo77 for this beer."
"O- This is such a great beer, really hoppy but still balanced. Probably my favorite IPA ever."
"Drinkability - Bitter, but lots of carbonation."
"Nice deep orange pour with a foamy, small head. The aroma was intense with citrus, mainly grapefruit. Smooth mouth feel with grapefruit, citrus, and a touch of sweet malt. The finish is a good lingering bite of hops. It’s everything I like in an IPA."
"This IPA pours out as a golden color with a decent head on it. The smell has a good amount of hops on the nose. The taste of hops and some hearty malts on the tongue. The mouthfeel was pretty good too. Overall this IPA isn't my favorite but worth trying."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber with a nice white lasting head, with good lacing. Aroma of piney citrusy hops fills the nose with some sweet malt. Taste is citrusy piney hops with some caramel maltiness. Palate is nice medium body, good carbonation, nice crisp moouthfeel. Finish is earthy piney hops bitterness with some good caramel malt for balance, ending with a nice sweet nutty bitter aftertaste. Overall a very nice all around brew"
"Not my type of IPA, but perhaps more true to the original IPAs of the past, using alot of hops to preserve the beer. I wish I could taste more out of the character of this ale, but its all hops and not much else sneaks through. Its not a very complex sense of hops either, it tastes like one variety of hops put in and that dominates anything else you might get a hint of."
"D – Good brew overall, more bitter then anything. Finishes with a smooth taste that I can enjoy more than one of and hope to have again."
"The taste has a nice blend of flavors: fruity, citrus and gentle pine hints with accents of berry and grapefruit with a mild caramel malt element. The sweet malt is in the background with some dry toasted notes and subtle tropical sweetness from the hops in the middle. There is a gentle herbal quality but I can tell this bottle is fresh since it doesn't stand out, the citrus rind leads to a sharp finish which is dry and satisfying. I think finest kind IPA is an east coast Ipa that sets itself apart w/ bitterness level that is high, but not over the top. It is dry and quenching relatively speaking with high amounts of hop flavor -no shortage in that department. I consider it a good example of the style."
"O- My favorite Smuttynose brew and one of my favorite IPA’s. It’s bitter, yet very drinkable and a staple in my fridge. If you are a hophead, seek this one out."
"Overall- A very flavorful and decently complex IPA, has about the perfect amount of bitterness as well, though the aroma is somewhat of an anomaly. I will definitely be drinking this again."
"Taste strikes a nice balance with some toasted toffee and hefty hop bitterness. Hop flavor is clean and not as notable as the bitterness. Nicest part about this beer might be the mouthfeel - very smooth and creamy. Delicious and pretty much flies under the radar when great IPAs are mentioned. Underrated in my opinion."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I was a bit hesitant to pick this up because I could see the sediment in the bottles at the store. Man am I glad that I did. It certainly taste fresh....the hops are large and in charge here. A tongue bruiser to be sure!"
"O: Super drinkable and light, a very solid IPA. I love how unfiltered this is."
"O: My first Smuttynose beer. I was excited to see it carried in stock at the local Joe Canal's. This would rate in my top 5 available IPA's. I do believe this just edged out Stone IPA in my book. I'm just about finished with my beer and the lacing and head are still there at the bottom of the glass. Very good first impression. IPA lovers have to try this one!!"
"Overall-Was looking forward to this beer, and will definitely drink the rest, just not too thrilled by it."
"Really enjoyed this one. If you like really hoppy IPAs, you'll love this beer. I will definitely go for it again."
"Big fluffy head over bubbly orange and golden. Hazy, with plenty of web lacing on the glass. Aromas are citrus, and I'm happy knowing the deliciously bitter hops follow. Citrus and herbal goodness. This is a great beer to have in the fridge at all times, especially if you just want to grab something juicy to fulfill that hop craving."
"Overall - I was actually surprised by just how hoppy this beer was. For those of us that like hops, like myself, it packs a lot in this IPA, but there did seem to be just a little bit of imbalance. It seemed like it was missing some sweetness."
"O: A very good IPA, that will not disappoint."
"Surprised to see the sludge in the bottom of the bottle. I expect that from a home made brew, but not from a ""store bought"" variety. Other than that, the beer is fairly formidable. Bitter, but not overly hoppy. I miss the overdone hoppiness of some of the new IPA's. I'd drink this again, but it won't be my first choice."
"Nice huge frothy cotton head. Body is orange peel in color but cloudy with a ton of floaties. Good thing is that seems to happen with the freshest beers. Smell is very juicy, spicy citrus hops. Tons of sweet pineapple laced with sweet caramel. Very nice clean hop bitterness on the first sip. The tangy mango and grapefruit lay out in the middle and backed by a subtle sweetness. Bitterness is nice and lingering. Very soapy mouthfeel with not too harsh and not too soft carbonation. Been looking forward to this one for a long time and it has lived up to my personal hype."
"Poured from a bottle (Best By Jul 2011) into a Smuttynose tulip glass. Pours a nice golden yellow with about a 1/2 inch head. This IPA really is a perfect example of the style, although it comes from an eastcoast brewery you can tell there are some westcoast influence (the nice hoppy bite) but there's this nice malty undertone that I don't usually get from some American IPAs which makes this unique. Smuttynose is one of my favorite breweries and this ties with the Star Island Single as my favorite beer from them."
"Pours a hazy, golden color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of floral hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, and hint of grass. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, floral hops, slight sweet malt, and hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"A well-made IPA though not my favorite take on the style. This is more along the lines of Stone's aggressive, unappologetic approach to bitterness of which I'm not the biggest fan (so if you enjoy Stone brews you'd probably like this as well). Wouldn't buy this again but glad I tried it."
"O -- A very impressive American IPA of the ""finestkind."" If it's what you're craving at the moment, this beer will not disappoint."
"Wonderful refresher and hop delivery system. Awesome brew! Favourite IPA so far."
"O - A solid east coast IPA that I would love to try on tap some day. I'm hoping the tap would make it smell better..."
"Some grapefruit rind is notable in the taste, but a piney flavor comes through in the finish and aftertaste. It's not overpowering though, and not as mouth-puckering bitter as some other IPAs. Personally, I'd like to taste the citrus a little more and the pine a little less. A slight breadiness from the malts is barely noticeable in the background. Nice mouthfeel. Overall, a very good IPA."
"The taste is filled with layers of bitterness ranging from smooth to sharp, but always pleasant. The citrus hops take over the taste of the apricot, but the latter is detectable in the complexity of flavors. The balance between the fruitiness and the bitterness are on point, if bitter hops on the back of your tongue are pleasant to you. The mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink, leaving a lingering bitterness. Delicious beer and one that I must try again."
"overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. I had it recommended to me from a friend, and I thought it was an interesting change from my favorite (stone IPA). I would seek this out again. Definitely worth a try!"
"This has a nice light body with soft carbonation. Almost the picture of what I would expect an IPA to feel like. In my opinion this is one of the best readily available beers on the market. Simply a well crafted IPA."
"Poured out a hazy burnt golden/orange with about a finger of bubbly head that dissipated quickly. Nose is a lot of floral grapefruit with a backing of citrus. The malt in the nose is extremely light with only hints of some caramel. The flavor mirrors the nose with a lot of the floral/grapefruit upfront but it quickly transitions to the sweet bread caramel body. A solid dry finish that reaffirms the hops you taste right up front. I think the drinkability of this beer help smutty establish a name."
"V: I add an extra half-point for good value because this is one of the better IPAs I've tried at price that's well below average for it's quality."
"O: The smell threw me off a little bit, but the flavor won me over. This is something I would buy again and definitely session on. Good job."
"Overall: Given the quality and the price, this beer is amazing! If I can keep finding it fresh, it will certainly be a staple in my fridge! Honestly, I feel that this is a beer that wont fall off any time soon either, however I have not tried it older."
"Overall - This is a solid IPA. I can't say that it will be a go to beer for me, but it's definitely something that I'd buy again."
"Hazy golden amber, not a lot of head, but what is there is sappy and sticky. Not a huge amount of hops in the nose, spicy and foral. Some sweetness. Lots of hoppy bitterness. Piney hop resin & grapefruit. Deliciously drinkable, great carbonation. Thought I loved this in the bottle, but on tap, with a local cheeseburger at PB was heaven! Have to get there more often."
"O: One hell of an IPA. The alcohol isn't noticeable and the long, dry finish is spectacular."
"Best by date of june 11 so not sure how fresh it is. Pours a slight muddy golden amber with a finger of head which leaves pretty spider webs on my duvel tulip. Nose has mandarins, rye bread spiciness and a floral piney character. The taste is almost a muddled mess - i really think i am reviewing a beer a bit past its prime. Finishes a bit chalky and has some generic hop qualities along with slight citrus taste. I am stoked to try this beer and would love to again fresh but i can only rate what i tasted and it was not that great."
"O: One of the best regular IPA around. Right in the league of Two Hearted Ale. It will not rip your mouth apart, but this is so well made (IMO) it's almost perfect."
"O: Finest Kind is an incredibly solid representation of the style. Clean, crisp, and refreshingly simple. However, it doesn't have a certain freshness that I usually look forward to. A solid brew nonetheless and should serve as what an IPA stands for."
"A very aromatic beer, though I was a little disappointed to find that the many scents present in the bouquet didn't translate very well into the taste of the beer itself. Even after the beer warmed a bit, I still had some trouble discerning its more subtle flavors. Still, I found it to be a very pleasing and easy to drink IPA, despite its relative lack of balance. I can see how hop heads would go crazy for this."
"Overall a good IPA but certainly not one of the best. Worth a try though, if you're in New England."
"Overall a nice IPA. Love the mix 12 packs from Smuttynose and this is probably my favorite beer in the pack. They're all good though."
"Drink- This was a very good single IPA. It's tasty, spicy and piney. It's not super over the top and I think thats why I like this more than other with similar profiles. I would like more of this and that would be right now. I am very upset at SN for not transporting beer all the way across the country."
"D- Very high this is almost my favorite IPA, seeing as I am a stickler for Harpoon. But this is a suitable substitute."
"Overall I love this beer definately in my top fiveIPA's list I reccomend this to any Hop bomb lover."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is excellent, with strong hop flavor and a nice mix of pine and citrus flavors throughout. The finish is powerful with the bitterness but still crisp and refreshing."
"D: Can't taste the alcohol whatsoever, and it's extremely refreshing. This is a great choice for a summer beer."
"This is one of my go-to beers, and one I'm sure to keep in rotation. While it falls short of exceptional, this is a great, well-made IPA. Highly recommended."
"I like this beer upfront, but the finish and the astringent, lasting, abrasive bitterness is just too much for me. I'd almost say this should be put in the DIPA (sans gobs of malt) for just how bitter it is."
"GET THIS BEER, A MUST TRY!"
"Overall a good example of an IPA."
"Overall a well made, East Coast American IPA. Not mouth numbingly hoppy, like the greats out of the west coast, but decidedly not an English-style IPA. One of my personal favorites, a go to beer if there ever was one."
"O - Suddenly I have a new IPA on my short list of favorites! Just wonderful. Easy to drink, refreshing, complex, hugely flavorful, and delicious. One of the best of the East Coast."
"o: Very drinkable. Solid, solid IPA. Smuttynose has an excellent offering here."
"D-Overall this was a good IPA. Not a hop bomb but still very hoppy which was good. had other flavors that balanced nicely. Overall a nice IPA"
"High carbonation, light body. A very well executed IPA that I would buy again and again."
"A great and superbly drinkable IPA from Smuttynose. This beer is always in season and I would recommend it to anyone."
"There's nothing wrong with an A-, but I firmly believe Smuttynose IPA is an A+ of an IPA. It can go toe to toe with the best!"
"O: With a start to finish barrage of hops and grapefruit this IPA is a real winner. I'll be looking for a case of this for sure."
"A solid and good IPA."
" all you want is a little hoppiness in your life."
"D/O: Killer brew here! Wow, I’m really surprised; so crisp, smooth and tasty! And it has a superb mouthfeel for such a crisp and refreshingly drinkable beer... think I may have found the perfect summer IPA."
"D: Flavorful smooth and balanced enough so that moderate ABV makes it very drinkable."
"Bought my first bottles of the season the other day, and I neglected to look at the best by markings. The six-pack was to have been sold/used by February. Not being one to waste a good ale, I opened a bottle and was greeted by a somewhat skunky smell. Drank it anyway and was pleasantly surprised by the crispness of it. Know it isn't very scientific, but this is a superior brew to be eminently potable even when supposedly expired. My preferred poison in the warmer months."
"It's a good change-up, especially after having a bunch of west coast IPA's lately (Stone, Sierra Celebration, Racer 5, Green Flash)"
"Cheers."
"This beer poured a light bodied fluorescent orange in color with a light white head that laced the glass. It smelled of attic must and Tang. It smelled dusty and was overly muted. The hops only gave off a slight citrusy aroma and there was no sweetness. The taste is overly bland too. All I got was light citrusy hops and dust. Booo! This was disappointing because of this beer's reputation. There just wasn't much to it. I ended up pouring out the last half because it wasn't worth drinking."
"Overall this is good. Good IPA night so far with this and leatherlips."
"A great IPA. I can't believe I have not had this until now. The earthy, dirty hop flavor alongside the sweet malt and citrus hop is wonderful and they all are balanced and blend into the flavor really well. Nothing is overwhelming or underwhelming and although it is solidly hoppy and bitter, I think would be a great intro IPA. flavorful and not overbearing. Unlike a lot of other ipas this beer doesn't keep the lingering hop flavor on the tongue, so it is super drinkable. great stuff !!!!"
"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! The Finest Kind IPA from Smuttynose is good. This beer has was golden clear in color with thin white head and great lace. The smell has a pine and citrus. This beer was well balanced with pine and malt in taste! The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The light ABV leads to this beer being a Session...certainly worth a taste."
"O- The smell disappoints, but it might be due to the beer almost being past its prime. However, I would gladly drink this beer time and time again, it if was available to me. The taste really does a number for me."
"After this, the 90 minute just tasted sweet and boozy with a little bit of citrus. If you want a palate-wrecker, this is it. One bad ass IPA."
"(D)- Started out well, but there is just too much piney bitterness and very little other flavors. Still decent, but a bit disappointing for me considering the accolades this receives."
"When it comes to IPA's, this is definitely one of my top picks. It's HOP-PY! Which is great, just what I love and just what you would expect for an at least decent IPA (And this is by far, above decent). Although, I must say, I'm not too sure that I would drink more than a couple of these in one night. The hoppy flavor isn't really balanced by the fruit notes of the beer - this is really the only thing I wish were different. If the fruit came out just a slight hair stronger to give some more drinkability, this would hands down be a 4.5 all the way through. then again, it always seems to be that the more sips I take the better I feel about it and the more I'm convinced that this is one of the absolute best IPA's. HAha! That usually seems to be the case. Still, its up there on the charts for me. When I recommend IPA's, I always mention this one!"
"O- Very solid IPA ! Will return to this one on warmer days for sure. Thoroughly enjoyed this IPA !"
"Very disappointed. I'm still scratching my head to see why this was rated so high. I've gotten more hop flavor and aroma out of SNPA (not to put SNPA down by any stretch)."
"This is an extremely drinkable and enjoyable IPA. Amazing that a beer can be this pleasantly bitter without being overwhelming. They only reason it gets points taken off is because the bitter hops probably necessitate a break after a few."
"O/D- no alc. A very solid IPA. I'm quite impressed."
"Overall I'm really happy I could buy a case of this at my favorite spot so fresh because this beer is certainly worth the $30 a case and thansome."
"O: I wouldnt recommend this beer nor would I drink another. I dont find it to be an IPA because there is no hop profile or character. Perhaps its abstract APA trying to be extra earthy? It seems to lack a direction and the hops are missing, hallow or not in the correct proportion."
"O (D) - This was one of the beers that got me started on craft beer, and I am pleased to say it's still great. An everyday sort of beer, for sure."
"In a word, love. I want more!"
"Overall: Cross between an American and an English IPA. Not quite enough flavor to support the extreme bitterness."
"O: Outside of the smell, and I'm a little confused about that, this is a good offering. I really enjoyed it and the intense bitterness has left my mouth almost numb. Cool!"
"Not sure if I'd rush out to get this one again but if it was available I wouldn't turn it down."
"Wow, this is interesting. If somebody described this beer to me, I would guess that I wouldn't like it. But I do. Need to schedule a road trip to pick up more. Great stuff."
"O: Wow, I'd heard a lot of good things about this beer on BA. I can't say I agree, I choked down half a bottle and that's all I could stomach."
"looks great clean and clear with a nice head. smell isnt too impesive but still smells clean and crisp. taste is malty up front with the hops close behind spicy at first then a little piney. a nice ipa definatly not my favorite but a good session beer i think."
"I've had this several timeas and misfiled it under too much malt. I stand corrected as I'm enjoying the start of a second case in 2 months. Great hop dryness with nice floaties and a latent bitter, creamy and very enjoyable finish at a price that is great in this area. I'll buy it again. Wondering if you get the floaties on draft?"
"O: It's great from the bottle, but phenomenal on tap. If you see it, you cannot pass it up. It's the closest substitute to eating an actual grapefruit I have come across. One of the best IPAs out there."
"Loved this beer. One of the best things was how well the smell portrayed just how hoppy and fruity it was. Not as fruity as you'd imagine though; well balanced. Unfiltered; I'm not a huge fan of the hops particles floating around but skillful dry hopping is likely what distinguishes this beer. After having just one of these it's honestly up there as one of my favorite AIPAs but I'm not hard to please. Masala Mama, Two Hearted, Founders. God I'm cliche."
"O: Nice aroma and flavor, the bitterness gets me a little bit. Pretty good IPA, definitely deserving of its finest kind name."
"I personally prefer the West Coast AIPA's. Though I can appreciate this one, I don't reach for it too often, though when I do I enjoy it."
"Good drinkability, quite impressed."
"D - Great IPA, I enjoyed this one very much!"
"D - This is a very tasty IPA and I can see myself blissfully spending a summer afternoon throwing these down while I wait for the ribs to finish on the BBQ. Would be great session beer and would be part of my regular rotation if it were distributed in my market."
"D: Pretty straight forward (albeit really good) IPA. If this were available regularly I might through it into my standard IPA rotation. Solid all around. Thanks again Chris for hooking it up!"
"Pours a hazy golden amber. As one reviewer said, it looks like honey! The smell is good, but didn't seem overly strong to me. Piney, hoppy, IPA bitterness. The taste is outstanding! It is a full-bodied IPA taste, without being harsh. Some IPA's I've tried have had that overly harsh ""bite"". This beer has all the full-bodied hoppy bitterness without making your mouth pucker in a bad way. It's not just bitter for the sake of being bitter...it has depth. Creamy (for an IPA) and balanced. Floral and a little piney. Not too much grapefruit notes (which, for me, is preferred). Mouthfeel...it is almost ""chewy""...in a good way. Very drinkable, despite a high ABV. I would definitely buy again!"
"Overall - great IPA - I would buy it again"
"Drinkability: The hop heaviness causes the drinkability to suffer. It was hardly something I could imagine quaffing down, but rather taking in small sips. A shame, because as I've said, I can tell it's a good beer, but just a bit too hoppy for my tastes."
"drinkability - loved this beer, wish we had it in Canada! What a great tasting beer, would stock for sure."
"D--Malt or not, I like drinking this beer. It goes down nicely and has the hop profile I like."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: I only give this a middle of the road vote, I'll finish what I have but likely not buy more."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, minerally, slick, and gently bitter."
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Bottle has a best before date on the side, this one has a while till the best before date so it should be pretty fresh. Pours pale dark orange with a nice big white head. The head is nearly gone within a minute or so but already leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The smell upon pouring is hoppy. Citrus, some pine, I don't get much after that. The taste impresses me more and more with everyone of these I drink. Pretty hoppy, citrus and pine. Some caramel in the background. Nice and hoppy though, leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste which is great. Pretty good mouthfeel, nothing much else to say about that. I could easily do all six of the six pack in one night. Low ABV and great taste. Overall it's a solid IPA that's easy to obtain and I will be getting more soon."
"D- Good IPA and you should expect a certain flavor. Its very good but i couldnt drink too many of them. But still a pretty mellow IPA that keeps me coming back for another sip. After sipping on the 12 oz bottle i have to say, its a tasty, enjoyable IPA."
"A great easy to drink IPA... really a classic and more West-coast style than East coast."
"D - Very drinkable beer, would recommend it to all lovers of the IPA style. Due to its strength, its probably 2-3 beer max for a session."
"Not a fan of this at all, big time pass in my book, could barely finish this."
"Drinkability, at least for me, is hampered by the astringently bitter finish. I think if that wasn't present I could drink this in gulps."
"A really solid session beer."
"O: Imagine your mouth after eating an whole grapefruit: pretty tart uh? That's how my mouth feels. Hop galore. I liked it but prefer something not as dry."
"Goes down fine. An excellent AIPA. Very flavourful, but never overboard. Seek out."
"D - Good drinkability. This IPA seemed ""different"" to me, but in a good way. It's not overly bitter and it has different tastes and aromas than I'm used to in IPA's."
"The beer is transparent and light orange in color. The white head is approximately a half inch thick and leaves ample lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma is a little less aggressive than I was hoping. Scents include hops with a splash of grapefruit. The beer is tasty and hop forward, but not bold. The finish is very dry, with a lasting hop bitterness. This is an enjoyable beer that I'd like to try again."
"Drinkability: I was really excited to drink this beer because it is highly regarded on this site. I just don't think it delivered at all. I drank this well within the bottles freshness window."
"For the extra bitter hopheads though, this is absolutely one to try and enjoy."
"D: Pleasant east coast balanced IPA. Wonderfully done and one that will be in my regular rotation for some time."
"Color is a murky orange w/ one finger snow white head. The head is short lived, but very nice lacing throughout. My senses may be off, but overall, the aromas on this beer are faint. I get a bit of pine, but that's about it. Taste is similar to the smell, with a bit more hop coming through. Mouthfeel is good though, nice carbonation. Drinkability is solid. I feel like a I could throw back a few of those on a hot summer day."
"This is a fun beer, and one that sort of stands out to me amongst all the citrus-y fruity IPAs that you could have. She's kind of unique. There's nothing like Smuttynose finest kind I think."
"D - fairly drinkable. I'll admit that IPAs are not my favorite style but this is good. this is the quintessential IPA."
"Nice carbonation and mouthfeel. I feel like I could kill a few of these no problem. not mindblowing, but still nice."
"Gold colour with foamy small bubble collar. Aroma smacks of fruity hops with a subtle malty sweetness. Tastes sweet with an immediate hop bitterness attack. Piney with that feline urine finish. This beer has a somewhat oily body that is full but hides behind it's bitterness despite a lively carbonation."
"Overall this is a superb IPA in my eyes. Was turned on to it by a friend years ago (an IPA enthusiast) and it has been in the fridge rotation consistently ever since. Would recommend trying even if you are not a big fan of IPAs."
"D - this is a beer that I could drink all day and not get sick of it. Not quite session able, but as close as you can get for an IPA on the strong side."
"DB- A solid IPA with a smooth, nice flavor. Drinks easily."
"Drinkability: Tons of hop flavor yet still incredibly drinkable. A six pack of this could just vanish."
"East Coast (i.e, less hoppy) IPA with significant malt base. Satisfying and good tasting, but not bold or especially interesting."
"This is my standby affordable IPA staple beer. I love it!"
"A very delicious IPA. Excellent appearance and aroma. The hops are very citrus followed by a hint of pine. Taste transitions from sweet to sour throughout the sip. One of my favorite IPAs."
"Edit: I've tried to go back and edit this review as it almost doesn't seem fair to give it an F but I can't change a thing. This beer is awful."
"D - It is drinkable, it would be moreso if I were having a few of these back to back with the geezers on the bottle. These guys look like they can party. Nice flavors, bitter isn't overwhelming and overall enjoyable."
"D- High drinkability, one of the finest beers of its style that I've had."
"Medium body with just enough carbonation to lighten things up. A tasty enough beer. Definitely worth trying, especially if you can find it fresh. But in its home state of New Hampshire, this is a difficult thing to do. Maybe the distribution network is in need of a major overhaul?"
"D: I didn't find this spectacular (the bitterness seemed highly restrained or faded), but still a highly drinkable IPA. I'll have to keep an eye out for a fresher bottle next time I'm down south and give this another go."
"D- very drinkble. theres 4 foot snowbanks outside but can imagine this is a perfect summertime IPA."
"Medium to light body."
"Drinkability: A great IPA. Easy to smell the dry hops and it delivers in taste. Well balanced IPA with plenty of bitterness. I would buy this one again and drink it with any food or by itself."
"Smuttynose usually pumps out fine representations of beer styles. let's see how their IPA stands out in an extremely crowded IPA market. Bottle has a humourous picture of two old dudes kicking back in front of a trailer with beer bottles scattered all over the yard. Me in 50 years? Finest kind indeed. Anyway, pours a bright golden color with a 2 finger head, tremendous lacing down the glass. Aroma is comprised of primarily of strong citrus hops, a bit of pine, slight biscuity malt, and a bit of grapefruit. Hop bitterness hits the tongue upfront, with smooth citrus fruit rolling nicely around the mouth. A faint trace of malt is present, this is a very hoppy beer. Good bitterness. A prototypical IPA. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, a good amount of bitterness. Drinkability is outstanding,dangerously slow, especially considering the good finish. A great example of an IPA. While I wouldn't put this into the ""elite"" category reserved for four or five near perfect IPAs, I would consider Finest Kind a great interpretation of the style."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A lovely pale orange pour with a nice creamy head, just the sort of look one wants from an IPA. Very strong nose of floral hops, sweet but not syrupy, and promising depth. Nice full mouthfeel, very drinkable but substantial nonetheless. Tasty citrus flavors complement the flowery sweetness of the hop, without making it too dry but balancing it all the same. Extremely well-balanced, complex but accessible. Among my favorite IPA beers - a cheap go-to beer that is widely available."
"D: The astringent finish on this beer is a challenge for me. I am a black coffee, neat whiskey, and big tannin red wine kind of guy, so I am not afraid of a certain level of astringency. Honestly, I feel like I have chewed an aspirin after drinking this beer! I would love to try this beer fresh and on-tap, as I'm sure the citrus and tropical fruit shine through the aspirin!"
"D - I can swig these down pretty fast, a with a manageble ABV, this would make one of the best session IPAs out there."
"If you're a first timer to the Smuttynose IPA, while I definitely enjoyed it, I would recommend their Shoals Pale Ale over this one."
"D- Very drinkable almost dangerously to drinkable This is without a doubt an ipa lovers ipa."
"The palate is bitter, dry, astringent, and really sets a nice standard for all AIPAs to follow or strive for. Bitterness, palate cleansing and full of refreshing flavor."
"Mouthfeel seems like it could be smooth enough but pine and bitter hold onto my mouth and astringency grips at my throat. Definitely not a beer that I would want more than one of... Ever... I sure hope this isn't the way the brewer intendedl"
"D: Wonderful I got it in a build your own 6er. I want to go out and get a 12 pack for the weekend. It is a nice Spring or early Summer brew."
"D/M: smooth on the pallet with a nice lingering depth on the pallet, slight carbonation tingle"
"M/D - Smooth mouthfeel with a medium to light body. Excellent drinkability, would gladly have a few of these."
"NOTE: I didn't want to completely review, but I recently had a 3-week fresh bottle and it was again a different experience: more grapefruit, no soapiness, and the best taste yet. I guess this is one that can fall off quite quickly. Luckily I can always get it very fresh."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice IPA."
"D- Overall this is a very nice IPA to drink. It initially is tasty and well balanced. That being said the lingering grapefruit bitterness was unreal. It was as if I slugged down a whole gallon of grapefruit juice, it just wouldn't stop. After a while the lingering bitterness took on the role of an aftertaste. If the lingering bitterness were a bit more subdued I would have given it about as high a rating as possible."
"Great drinkability, flavors are just right. One of a few ipas you could drink all night."
"The mouthfeel is just thick enough to hit the seriously drinkable edge, and the fact that the malts hit first make it extremely drinkable, this didn't last very long in front of me. 7% ABV? Could have fooled me, this is very drinkable. A great IPA from Smuttynose, I'm excited to try more beers from this brewery."
"I will have to remember to review the next fresh bottle I get. One of my favorite locals with one of my favorite labels. Who doesn't love Cy and Paul whooping it up?"
"D- just plain good, wonderful example of the style, I'd get it again"
"Drinkability: This beer is a fine example of how an American IPA should be brewed. Nice solid hop bite that assaults the palate with a nice malt backbone. This beer is almost like drinking liquefied hops. A top-notch brew!"
"Well, it's about time I reviewed one of these. It poured with a large head and had a nice, hazy, light amber color. There were some rings laced around the glass as I drank this. The taste follows the smell, with some nice, but not overpowering, citrus. This is probably my favorite IPA for the price. You can't go wrong with this one!"
"I expected a lot from this IPA and it delivered on all fronts, wish they could extend dist into Indiana."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation plays out well. Flavors of the beer are long lasting. Very good balance between hops and malt. This is a classic IPA. Glad to see this one in the Cincinnati market."
"This is a very drinkable and solid brew. I would gladly have this again."
"Overall, a flavorful APA. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall an excellent beer, of which I wish I'd purchased more than 6!"
"Very drinkable solid IPA."
"Definitely one of my favorite IPAs and beers for that matter. Will be looking for a case of this next time I get beer."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. Don't let the heavy amount of hops fool you, this is crisp and refreshing and an IPA that could go very well with another--and another."
"D: The approach of this beer is like a kick in the teeth, but all the while I was thinking how refreshing it was. A hop head's delight, this beer, with no booziness or off-flavor to speak of. This beer has all the things I enjoy in an IPA."
"D: It goes down real easy. I'd be able to take a few of these out in no time."
"Drinkability: The bile smell is a tad overwhelming for me, and I can stand some absurd aromas/flavors. Otherwise, this is a solid brew that deserves high marks and recognition. I will revisit again!"
"Such a great IPA, really fortunate to be able to get this easily and fresh around here."
"Poured golden orange in color with yellow highlights on the edges with a half finger of head and left some good lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was piney hoppy upfront with citrus, slight malty biscuit, caramel, and mild grassy notes. The taste was more piney and hoppy on the palate with citrus grapefruit that helped out on the hop bit but was not too hoppy. It also had caramel and sweet malt accents to help balance out the beer. The beer was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a hoppy, piney, citrusy, bready, and mild bitter finish. It drank good but was lacking the hop punch that I usually lok for in my IPA's. I guess I guess I'm just spoiled with all these great hop bombs on the west coast."
"Drinkability - Very. A great IPA. Very balanced and a great IPA. No alcohol presence. Would definitely pick this up."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing. Not as fruity/acidic as many IPA's that are out there."
"D/O- Pretty hard hitting IPA here as far as the bitterness. No worries though because it's delicious. A ('Merican) session with this would be wonderful sans the wrecked palate after a few. Definitely recommended."
"Drink - An above average IPA that I'd really like to try on tap. Worth seeking out."
"D: Good, an interesting diversion but don't think it holds a candle to Two Hearted which stands as my favorite IPA at the moment."
"This beer is perhaps my favorite unfiltered IPA."
"Smuttynose has truly impressed me with the first two beers I have tried. These are two which I will seek out and procure whenever possible. Great, great stuff."
"drinkability is so so - the flavor is not one i will revisit often - maybe only pick this one up in the smuttynose mix 12"
"D - Very high. I could drink several and will be buying it again."
"Thanks to BK for getting this to me in time for the holidays. Couldn't wait so I had to sample on tonight before the Big Guy could deliver it to me. Nice head in my champagne flute taster. About 1 inch of lacing and a nice dark golden hue. Smell is heavenly, citrusy, piney and what I was dreaming about. Taste is also great, Nice and hoppy, not too bitter, some fruity jazz going on, maybe pears or green apple, and a little peppery. A tad earthy. Mouthfeel is splendid, medium bodied, no bitter aftertaste, and still bubbly after a few minutes in the glass. Drinakability is great; I could sit back and have a few on this breezy 60 degree late fall evening."
"Light amber appearance, with a thick and fluffy head that maintains its presence on top of the brew and leaves a lasting impact on the side of the glass after each sip. A bit of cloudyness as well, along with some sediment particles floating around in the glass. Nose is full of strong, bold hops that linger with characteristics of dense pine, citrus, some sweetness and a touch of alcohol. The taste blasts you with a nicely balanced concoction of piney, bitter, citrus hops that mingle with an oily, biscuity texture. Almost no alcohol noticeable in the taste, while a sweet and heavy malt presence shows up at the end of each sip. A medium body with low carbonation leads this brew to a high drinkability, smooth and easy to knock back more than one of these."
"Poured into a Sam adams perfect pint glass from the bottle. There was a large puffy head of foam that lasted 3/4 of the way down. The appearance was cloudy with an orange/copper color. There is a sharp hop character that lingers in the mouth, mostly on the back of the tongue. Overall, great brew."
"D: A pretty big IPA, but I think I could do a sixer at a party."
"This was a very good IPA the flavor was strong and it was very refreshing. This is definitely something I would buy again."
"Slainté!"
"I'll admit, this brew has me confused. Ill state that I do like it and buy it occasionally---but there is one dominate feature that prevents me from raiting it higher. Lets begin this way---pour. The pour yields a good looking, clear amber-orange colored liquid capped with a nice fluffy head. Lacing remains to the bottom of glass. Smell is of hops and some pine. Taste---well, here goes---BITTER. I find the dominant feature of this IPA is its overriding bitterness. There is little malt to speak of and a crisp dry finish. Now, this bitterness makes the brew a occasional drink for me---I tend to like a better balanced IPA. But, I do like the beer and crave it occasionally. To me, drinkability suffers due to the bitterness. I know its the style of this beer, but be warned---you want bitter, you got it. BTW, bottle reviewed was very fresh."
"This is the first time I've had this beer but I wouldn't hesitate to put it up there with some of my other favorite IPAs. Apparently this one is stocked at the shop around the corner from me now and this is certain to have a permanent spot in my IPA rotation. Good stuff."
"M/D- Quite a bit of oilyness on the initial sips, gave way to a much easier drinking characteristic than anticipated. So glad Smutty products are now available in IL."
"D- it's possible I'm just not a fan of unfiltered IPAs, but this really didn't do it for me, it was too 1 dimensional with all the focus on the hops and no balance. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that on a hot summer day with a good barbeque this could be a nice beer to have."
"D-As drinkable as a beer can get. Loving that Smuttynose has finally arrived in Chicago!"
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I would have no problem drinking a 6-pack of these. I really like this IPA. I can't wait to try some more styles from Smuttynose."
"D: I could probably drink a 6 of these. ABV is not too high and the price is good."
"I really wish that Smuttynose was a local brewery here. I have always enjoyed their beers. This one is no exception."
"1/2 finger white head quick dissipation with average lacing over semi-cloudy deep gold body, some visible carbonation rising. Nose and taste pretty complex, good hop aroma, tropical hit re mango and some citrusy grapefruit notes but a resiny finish, bready malts in the nose but more caramel in the taste, interesting interplay. Medium full mouthfeel, good effervescence, a bit sticky. Good drinkability. IMHO this is the NE IPA that best emulates the west coast style. Recommended."
"D - alcohol is under control, and the balance makes this one an easy sipper. As soon as I finished, I had to have another."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of hops. Taste is very hoppy, some citrus, no malt balance to speak of, very bitter. Feels bitter in the mouth and is not very drinkable. Overall this is a mediocre effort."
"drinkability- really one of the easiest drinking ipas on the market, love this on a hot summer day"
"The Finestkind IPA is just that--this is by far my favorite IPA available in six-packs, and one of my favorites of any kind. It would be selling it short to call this is a West Coast IPA, though it's quite a departure from the equally nice, more typical New England varieties; like most Smuttynose offerings, this is a uniquely New England take on an old style rooted in its place and done exceptionally. At $9-10/six-pack, it's a steal, too."
"Will have to revisit this when I catch it fresh again. Nice $10 6er. Worth it."
"This is a fairly drinkable IPA, but I feel like it is not quite up to snuff with a lot of my other favorites. It is a very good brew, but I just found that hop character was a bit too pithy and medicinal for my personal taste. Still one to seek out if you are a hop enthusiast."
"D - The dry finish my halt you after a couple...but then again, the abv might do the same once it hits you."
"Pours out an orangey-yellow with an opaque translucence, and a frothy, sticky head. Bottle is date coded and fresh, thanks for doing that Smuttynose. Smell is a bit faint, no big floral smacks in the face like you'd want from an IPA, but what you can smell is citrus, resinous grapefruit. You really have to try hard to get a smell, and I think for a bold IPA you should be able to smell it sitting next to you, aka, Two Hearted or even Alpha King. Anyway, taste is of citrusy grapefruit, with a resinous hop oily aftertaste. Some lemon zest in there too. Nice lacing on my glass. Some good carbonation and medium/rich mouthfeel. Some sweet malt body gives a nice backbone. Anyway, these are quite smooth and drinkable for such a high abv. Overall a nice beer, but not quite all that I look for in an IPA, especially in the nose. Hops are a bit one-noted too, lots of grapefruit and not much else. I will see how this beer does as it warms a little more and edit accordingly, if necessary, I hope."
"At first the bitter grapefruit dominated and seemed too much, but the subtle, sweet notes lift the bitterness just enough so one more enjoy a myriad of flavors - very nice. One of the best IPAs I've had - very intense, but very good."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours hazy golden with a large, long lasting, white head and much lacing. Aroma of bready malt and citrus hops. Medium - full, tangy body. Citrus hops, sweet biscuit malt and ripe fruit are balanced on the palate. Long, dry, grapefruit finish. This beer is more balanced (more malt and less hops) than their Pale ale."
"Love the pic on the label."
"At the moment I'm not at all a fan of Double IPAs. Dogfish Head 90's are just a bad time in my eyes. But having this great Smuttynose IPA gives me hope that I may, one day, become a fan of the Doubles. If I do, I'll give thanks to my new go-to IPA."
"D- this is the first smuttynose beer ive tried, and its good enough to make me go check the other ones out. a really solid IPA that has a price point a little lower than the others. this might be enough to break into my regular rotation. a little too strong to pound all afternoon, but not too strong to have a couple of."
"D: I like my IPA with a dry finish and this has it. Overall good and enjoyable but nothing that puts it at the top of my IPA list."
"I see this being an IPA for hopheads and not just for the casual beer enthusiasts. But hey, give it a shot. It's delicious."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these with no problems. One of the most delicious IPA's i've had."
"at the same time, really reminds me of a EastCoast Two Hearted ale. Would suggest checking this one out if you get a chance."
"D - Well built NE-style IPA. I'd have no problem having this again."
"Not bad, but I'm not a big fan of these English type IPAs. I don't like this much toffee in my brews. A matter of personal preference. Also hops are a little too soapy for my taste, like dry hopping with centennial opposed to amarillo which is fruitier and a little cleaner."
"d- pretty good ipa, well worth a shot if youre looking for a new ipa to try"
"Linger: 4"
"D. Not a bad IPA by any means, but lacks the complexity I desire in a really good IPA. I tend to favor a more malt forward profile with a wider variety of hop bitterness."
"Pours a dark-ish golden color with a single-finger white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some grassy, floral, and citrus hops. The flavor is unfortunately short a bit on these flavors, but does bring a good amount of bitterness without letting too much malt get in the way. Good body with nice carbonation. This is one of the better Smuttynose beers that I've had."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date of January 2011. Pours a murky orange color with a thin head. Some sediment floating around in there. Aroma of hops and citrus fruits, predominantly orange. Taste has a nice bitterness to it. Nice hoppy, citrus flavor. Bitter aftertaste. Relatively smooth and crisp IPA. Nicely drinkable and tasty."
"Excellent IPA especially for it only being 7.99. This IPA I think definitely gives the West Coast IPA's some good competition and I'm glad an East Coast IPA tastes like this. Definitely recommended."
"D - Very refreshing and well balanced beer with great crafted flavors. Good ABV as well. Many could be had."
"d: Very easy to drink and finishes cleanly. A great overall drink, a new personal favorite."
"I must admit, I am a little disappointed with this brew. I was expecting an out of this world IPA, but I have definitely had much better ones. I probably won't be getting this one too often."
"A top notch IPA there is no doubt. I wish I had more than the one bomber. There is nothing to dislike about the beer. I could easily drink a few of these in a session. While not my favorite IPA, it is very close."
"D: This is hard to beat when fresh."
"A yellow-orange beer that is cloudy with a nice white head that descends and laces. A fruity hop nose comes first with a bit of bready malt underneath it. A thick, sweet body that has a bit of bread within it finishes cleanly with a subtlety balanced bitterness. A bit of piney hop comes through along with an alcoholic warmth. Coats well, and eminently drinkable. A well made IPA, likely one of my top 5 by rating..."
"This beer has everything I like in an IPA and nothing I don't. It's the best IPA on the East Coast I can think of and, maybe, my favorite anywhere."
"D: This is a great IPA, dry, bitter and hop hop hoppy!. I will be going back for more of this."
"The mouthfeel is medium and it never, ever tastes the slightest bit watery or weak. You feel like you've had something substantial to drink but leaves you craving another. Repeat as necessary. Finest Kind is the standard to which I compare all IPAs."
"Their use of hops is spot on, the aroma and taste full and exciting."
"D - Absolutely great. This is one of my favorite IPAs and one of the few beers I'll buy again and again. You'd be hard pressed to find a better single IPA for the price, too. If you haven't yet tried it, get off your ass!"
"Notes: One of the best balanced and best tasting IPA's I've had to date. IPA fans you have to try this one."
"D- good, solid east coast IPA. Really easy drinking despite the bitterness I get from it"
"Value: This is pricey at around 11 bucks a sixer, but this is one that's worth it."
"Drinkability: Very good IPA"
"(28th)"
"Very hazy, bright copper in color. Thin head after the pour that leaves a very thin cap. Nice balance of bready malt and light floral hoppy aroma with hints of lemon and citrus orange. Light to medium bodied with very lively, almost tangy carbonation. Pine hop flavors overwhelm this IPA from beginning to end. As it warmed a bit of citrus flavor seemed to peek through. Finishes with a bitter hoppy pine finish."
"D -Enjoyed this very much! I'd be hard pressed to not have this in the future."
"Excellent IPA, a hop lovers dream!"
"an orange IPA. With about three fingers of head. Mild murky. Well rounded all year palate. Quite hoppy bitter but with aging a nice note of malt on the palate. Nose of tangerine and citrus pine. Palate of well back malt sweet with a green orange peel bitter. Crisp, and hoppy but wouldn't say any more so than the other. the end fulls off completely making it rather savory. Great balance but thin and without accent."
"D: I love this semi-local IPA. Nice, crisp drinking beer with a bitterness that lets you know there are some serious hops in it. Grab it if you see it"
"It's creamy on the palate with bright carbonation. A light and refreshing bitter hop blast."
"A really well-executed IPA here. This is really tasty stuff."
"A solid, classic IPA. It met my expectations."
"Would definitely have more than one given the opportunity."
"12oz bottle $2. Nice orange color, hazy and a foamy head with some lacing. Smell was a little dull but the hops were there. The flavor was quite bitter with some interesting hop flavors but not that west coast juiciness I love. Still this was not bad and I'd love to get a super fresh bottle or drink it on tap."
"Slightly hazy, peachy orange in color with a fine, sticky white froth. Spicy citrus hops in the aroma. Lean, crackery malt is overpowered by snappy citrus rind bitterness up front, which washes over the palate with a spicy, orange zest. Bitterness is pungent and green, and pervades the nasal cavity with delicious lemony hop flavor/aroma. Long, citrus rind finish. This is what I call old-skool microbrew IPA, with a ton of bittering hops, a light malt profile, and perfectly attenuated. A New England classic."
"Notes: Outstanding!!! This is a great example of a West Coast IPA."
"Overall: My favorite everyday IPA. I can always get this at Total Wine & More, and it has become my favorite single ipa."
"For starters, it's quite a pretty beer. Opaque, orange, nearly golden hue with more of a hefeweizen quality than I expect from a typical IPA. I don't get much from the nose, but then again, I'm pretty hit or miss with smells given my unusually small nostrils (seriously). The taste, however, is spectacular. A case study in hops. Little sweetness to counter, but the brassy bitters don't overwhelm and the finish is long and welcomed. I'm not at all surprised at the 6.9% but I feel like I could enjoy at least another 2 without a challenge. Way to go smuttynose! I gotta figure out what's the deal with this name before my next 6-pack."
"Drank On: 09-12-10"
"FYI i had this out of the bottle, wasnt too impressed, poured into a glass its excellant, realeases lots of great hoppy aromas."
"A good IPA that provide a strong whiff of hops that remains through a dry finish. The beer pours a surprising orange hue, but packs the full hoppy flavor of a much darker beer. The beer has a full body and feels smooth before finishing with a pleasant earthy dry hop finish. Not overbearing, but jut enough to produce an above average but fairly easy drinking IPA."
"The finish lasts long after. Beautiful and balanced. Mouthful is light and carbonated. Very sessionable. A fine, fine IPA."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, and it finishes dry. Meh, not a big fan of this one."
"D- This beer is really good. Very drinkable. I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability -- This matches my expectation of an NE IPA to a tee: dry, quenching, with deep hop bitterness. Hope this stuff gets around to my neck of the woods soon!"
"Love this brew. That's all there is to it."
"A giant leap up from mass produced beers, just not the ""finest kind"" of IPA in my opinion."
"This is a phenomenal beer seek it out. you don't have to be a hop head to enjoy it. There is a mellowness to it."
"Very high."
"Notes: An amazing example of an American IPA. Big hops, with a solid backing. Great job."
"Pours a golden orange, with a finger and a half of bright white head, quickly diminishing to a soapy collar and leaving sheets of chunky lacing. Hazy body and I can see some sediment floating around in here, carbonation just streaming off the bottom of this one. Aroma is exceptionally pronounced here (might be a function of the bottling date), but I can dig out some peach and grapefruit amongst other fruits, and a bit of lemon in here? Taste ascertains my lemon rind inclinations, with some upfront bitterness and a thinner malt base than I would've liked. The other fruits play more minor roles here (grapefruit and some pineapple), but are still present. Taste greatly improves as it warms, really starting to like this. Good and fairly smooth mouthfeel, with medium-high carbonation and good drinkability, especially given that it's my day off and it's a beautiful day outside."
"D- smooth, easy, and refreshing would be nice around a campfire or on a summerday"
"D: The touch of skunk became a bit wearing; but I liked the balance of a graininess and maltiness; good beer all in all"
"Mouthfeel was nice. Came across as malty but light-bodied simultaneously -- just what I like in an IPA. Overall, this is a hard beer to judge because of the aroma weakness. But the flavor is certainly more important to the drinkability & I enjoyed this beer pretty well."
"I also feel that it is necessary for me to mention that American IPA's are undoubtedly my least favorite style of beer and I'd go as far as to say that I DETEST them. So to say that I think this one is exceptional and that I really like it means that it stands out as an exceptional beer among a style that I have no other interest in. Truly an excellent beer."
"Forget whatever $13 six pack you're about to buy and pick this up instead. Smuttynose IPA is a huge bang for your buck beer that's easily a fridge staple."
"I also have to add that this IPA is 31.99 on avg here in central pa which is on the cheaper side. I love this dirty IPA and I love that Smuttynose keeps the price points affordable for people like me!!"
"A very solid above average IPA pick one up if you see one although i wouldnt go out of my way to find it."
"Served chilled from 12oz bottle, about 40 degrees. Nice honey color with thin lacing. Starts off with strong taste and smell of hops but has a very drinkable appeal and not overpowering. I'm not a big fan of IPA's but I definitely recommend this to first time tryers."
"Taste is really well balanced, quite hoppy bit ts got a great malty backbone. The bitterness becomes a bit abrasive. Mouthfeel is sharp and crisp."
"Drinkability is a 3,0 for me. It's too bitter and the aftertaset too overridingly bad to have more than 1 or 2. That said, there are a lot of nice things about this beer and I can't give it a bad score here, so a 3.0 it is."
"""Finest kind"" has grown on me over the six pack. It's a very solid effort & I'm glad Smuttynose has come to Ohio. I'll likely enjoy this again from time to time."
"Drinkability - very drinkable will definitely buy again, this is the second best IPA I've had thus far"
"What a fantastic beer! It's been a couple of years since I've purchased this, and I waited far too long. The best east-of-Michigan IPA which I've had."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with an average amount of carbonation. This is fairly drinkable, but not something I would sit down a drink more than two in a night. The bitterness can really overtake your palate, and wear it down after a while."
"Had a pleasant golden opaque color and prevalent floaters. This beer is unpasturized. Minimal head and lace. The smell is somewhat faint. Hints of yeast and grapefruit tingle the nose. Has a very plesant mellow taste. Well ballanced describes this beer well. Traces of grapefruit and bittersweetess. The finest kind has a refreshing cool crisp mouthfeel. The bitterness stays on the roof of your mouth. I find this to be a very well ballanced and flavorful beer. They claim the its the ""finest kind"" and i wouldnt hold it against smuttynose."
"The two old guys living the dream on the label justifies the name ""Finest Kind"". This beer needs to be fresh in order to be fully appreciated. Always a dependable brew in my book. Quite cheap too. May be my number one beer to buy a 12 pack of."
"D - A solid IPA all the way around... Much more assertive than I expected... Hop forward, but lacking in complexity... Not enough malt for my liking..."
"D - over all it is a easy drinking ipa. that i'm not to crazy about"
"Pours an almost clear amber orange color with a full cap of foamy white head. Scent is of citrus and tropical fruits balanced nicely with piney and floral notes. Taste brings the above mentioned hop notes without too much bitterness, a grahmn crackery malt background is also present. Medium bodied, coating and slightly oily, slightly dry finnish, maybe a touch over carbonated. A good solid IPA, would love one a touch fresher since this case seems to be from the early spring."
"D - Pretty nice to sample. Will have to check the dates more frequently since this one was best before April 2010. Way past it's prime but still drinking great. Can get a sixer for 9.99 so affordable as well. Nice!"
"D- Believed if some of the citrus flavors were increased to compete with the bitterness this could be a more drinkable beer, still easy to put a couple of these down though."
"Drinkability: super refreshing despite its ABV, this is a highly tasty IPA. I would go out of my way to get this again."
"D: Highly drinkable, I only mark it down a touch because the bittering is a touch high for a 5 (see Two-Hearted Ale or Stone IPA for a ""how the hell do they cram this much hoppiness in without bitterness?"" beer)."
"Hoppy, bitter, oily, citric- the flavor is mainly grapefruit, grass, pine, hop resin-aggressive bitterness- not too complex, a little bready malt backbone. I would give it a B/B+"
"Cheers!!!"
"D: Really good. Much better than your average IPA."
"This is a bitter hop heads dream right here. Probably the most potent regular IPA I've had to date. A punishment for the tongue, which will only allow me to do one or two a night max with this. Still a damn fine IPA."
"A tip of the glass to fellow RIer Shogokawada for bringing this Finest IPA to my attention."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head over the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Head fades slowly, with full coating of lacing. Aroma is a juicy tangerine hops combined with malty sweetness. Taste starts with the malts and fruitiness, but takes on a stronger, more out-of-control bitterness near the end, which continues through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, once the mouth gets used to the bitterness, like most IPAs, and drinkability is good as well."
"Overall- this american ipa is somethat different then alot of other americans with the whole centennial or cascade (citrusy) hops coming at you more. whenever i pass this brew again on vacation i will definitely pick up more."
"D- One of the most refreshing beers I've had! If you can make it past the particulate hops (which is definitely not a barrier for me) I could easily take a sixer out in a day! If you like this is suggest BrewDog Hardcore IPA!"
"This is one any beer lover may want to drink several of in a sitting, but the ABV is just creeping up to fairly high."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it was a very nice IPA overall. Personally I prefer a bit more of a citrusy hoppiness in IPA's but this was still a well made and good version of an IPA."
"Prost!!"
"The flavor continues the hop-centric focus, at least as far as northeast IPAs are concerned. Similar notes of grapefruit and orange rind bring a load of juiciness to the table which is sweetened to even by the herbaceous tobacco and pine. Malts are low on the totem pole, with pale malt sweet-and-dry character that makes little impression. For a West Coast IPA enthusiast, this is an outstanding Eastern version."
"D: This is a very tastey IPA and has become one of my favorites. The drinkability is medium I would say. I could make a session of these easily, but it may cath up with me."
"Drinkability - awesome brew, the alcohol is disguised very well, leaving a bitter but very refreshing IPA. Very drinkable and easily worth another purchase."
"Smuttynose is the brewery that opened my eyes to the world of craft-brewing. I owe it to them for saving me from the world of mostly indifferent college drinkers."
"D: Very bitter for the style, reminds me of Stone IPA."
"Crisp, hazy, golden in color. Eggshell colored head on top, sticky lacing adorns. Smells of citrus fruits, with some pine and resin hops. A slight malt base for balance, but still very hop forward. Ditto for the tast: Citus,, woody, piney, and delicious. The feel is crisp, yet mediumish in body. Drinkability is perfect, just an amazing single IPA."
"Overall: Very good IPA. I will be buying more of these and I recommend that you do the same."
"The aroma is a preasent mix of citrus and light tropical notes, nothing really strong in the aroma dept, not the most heavily dry hopped it seems but good non the less. The taste follows, and man can i saw this all around with the flavors, Feel, and overall is just a refreshing and drinkable IPA that you can go for over and over and not get tired of. There is no bad flavors in here, and the bitterness is such a perfect level so as to be refreshing and not get cloying. just a orange zest, grapefruit, pear and light mango bliss."
"Very drinkable, but not as good as the average would state if you want an IPA that WOWS you."
"This is one I should have revisited much sooner. It's so simple and easy to drink that it's easy to forget how complex and different it is."
"Welcome to my beer fridge! If you're an IPA lover, this beer is a must! Get some!!"
"This beer has a nice orange brown color with a one inch head that lasts forever. The carbonation holds up a nice 1cm head throughout the tasting experience. The head produces outstanding lacing. I'm mainly picking up grapefruit aroma with just a hint of pine and malt. Each sip starts off with the slightest touch of pine, but is quickly engulfed by the grapefruit. Bitterness starts off at low-medium, but finishes high. A little malt rears its head in the finish as well. ""Finest Kind"" isn't my favorite American IPA, but I do enjoy a pint or two every once in a while. Give it a try. Cheers!"
"I am upgrading my review, because I do think this is a solid beer, very drinkable, and appealing, and I think as an unfiltered IPA it makes it stand on its own compared to many of the other IPAs out there right now. I also thin the 1st one I had was a bit toned down to what I am tasting now, or that is my perception, this is much more aggressive than I remember."
"Great on a sunny summer day."
"Notes: One of the most understated and best offerings from Smuttynose? This could be a nice go-to-beer if it were more commonly available, in particular in tap form, around here."
"Overall this beer was a little one sided with straight up pine bitterness. If that is what you like then I recommend it but if you like more citrus side IPA's then I would not pick this up."
"The sediment seen in the bottles is normal!"
"Taste follows the citrus aroma. Creamy mouth-feel. Citrus hops, predominately orange, and a bit of grapefruit. A lot of hops in this beer. Finishes strong and bitter with hints of a malt follow through. Still well balanced for a very big tasting IPA."
"There is kind of a weird, unpleasant aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on. I had to knock off a couple drinkability points for that, unfortunately."
"Not much else to say, as I rarely write such a detailed review, but this one had quite a bit going on while maintaining a balanced identity. This is great stuff, and I'm excited we're finally getting this brewery in Ohio."
"As for the ABV%, I was surprised to see that it was almost 7%. This certainly didn't taste or feel like that strong a beer, but that's probably proof at how well this is crafted. While it's not a ""hop bomb"" like its west coast counterparts, this may be the strongest beer in Smuttynose's lineup outside of any Porter. For this time of the year, this is a good choice for a solid, hoppy beer that doesn't call for a chaser of water!"
"Mouthfeel is nice and full-bodied, no booze taste. Carbonation is a bit high for my liking. Hops may be a little much for a session, great price for a 6-pack though."
"All in all, the IPA lover will definitely enjoy this brew. As I am not, I think this is just ok. Not worth hunting. Only try if you have access or are in the area, otherwise, it's just not worth it."
"Usually long intervals of time (and many beers) between drinking this, and I'm scratching my head as to why I don't pick this up more often when I'm craving the hops. Solid."
"O A quality IPA, one I've had before and would have again."
"Get this beer if you see it on tap."
"Although IPA's aren't my cup of tea, I can see hop heads loving this beer, its extremely disorganized and unbalanced between hops and malts, which makes it tough for me, though. I stopped at one but I can definitely tell its quality. Extreme bitterness brings this one closer to a sipper."
"D - This is a very good, but not exceptional beer. A solid second-tier offering"
"The Finest Kind IPA pours a golden yellow color with lots of frothy head and carbonation. Smell is sweet with citrus fruits and caramel. Not much malts but some bitter hops that are faint. Taste is much stronger than the nose, with lots of hops and a very enjoyable sweetness. This brew goes down very easily and has lots of carbonation. Drinkability is solid. I really wish this beer was available to me, I will definitely look to trade for some more in the future."
"D - Drinkability is good. Tremendously crafted, which has come to be expected from one of the best and most consistent breweries in the country. As sessionable as can be. A beer I'd love to drink as much of and as frequently as is reasonable. Just awesome. A pure, and spectacular IPA, and I'm a person that generally finds IPAs pretty dull and boring."
"Drinkability- overall if you are a hop head this beer will not disappoint you at all, its just got boatloads and round after round of strong hop flavor, for my part I think its a little off balance for me to call it extremely drinkable for me the hops are just so overwhelming I feel it lacks some balance that other ipas still maintain something I think I would struggle to really go through to many of or too fast, But this would pleasantly surprise many ipa fans out there, certainly a very well crafted beer Id recommend people be trying"
"Unfiltered, so pours a hazy gold. Head is excellent - very fine bubbles and sticky icky. Smell is surprisingly malty, and a bit leafy. Some spice and alcohol too.. Taste is clean and grapefruity as hell, then goes straight to the point with a ton of hops. Feel is all hops, but smooth. Finishes with hops, and lasts as so, but drinkability is high. Very good brew, and the alcohol % is right at this beer's max, I'd say."
" cheers."
"This one stands out among the plethora of IPAs brewed today. It is dangerously drinkable for 6.9% ABV."
"cheers"
"D- Finest Kind is a wicked IPA. It really gives that 1A/1B east coast AM IPA (60). The bitterness is an additional treat with the brew. I gotta be honest... on a holiday weekend like this... with some lax on the tube and family around... I could drop 10 of these. Smutty makes a great IPA"
"D - This is a solid IPA. It became more and more delicious as I drank it. Too bad I only picked up a single as I had a bunch of other stuff to pick up. If this came to St. Louis, I would definitely purchase this again."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. Smutty IPA pours a stunning bright orange, with a nice creamy white cap that hangs around for a minute before coating my glass with lace. Absolutely gorgeous. The nose is largely made up of tropical citrus notes, with some bready malts barely perceptible as well. The taste is similar, but after a brief flash of bitterness I'm not getting too much else besides straight grapefruit from the hops. Pale malt sweetness is again present, but an afterthought. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing, as the beer is overcarbonated and just a little on the thin side. This keeps the beer from being too drinkable, which may be a good thing as I'm not tasting any evidence of the nearly 7% ABV. A very good IPA from Smuttynose."
"I could drink several of these. It's a true pleasure! Great beer from Smuttynose!"
"Drinkability is good. I could knock back a few."
"Delicious IPA, probably one of my favorites I've ever had. I guess it really is 'Finest Kind.'"
"Overall impression: Decent but forgettable. I'll give Big A a shot, but I'm done with Finest Kind."
"Nothing really blows me away with this beer, but there is also no flaw with it. Overall, this is a solid drinking beer, reminds me a little of crooked tree by Dark Horse."
"D-A pretty good IPA, but the bitterness and astringency/alcohol character hurt the drinkability for me."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with lots of carbonation. Smell just a little hops, not too much. Taste is malts up front, pine hops and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Drinkability, not so much. This is a very bitter beer, I am glad I shared this bomber. Decent beer, but bitter."
"What a great beer. If I hadn't drank the phenomenal Green Flash IIPA the same night, this would've easily been the highlight of the evening. As it is, I'd definitely like to get my mitts on this again."
"Jeez this is a bitter taste, all bittering hops no dry hopping perhaps? Just tastes like hops in a very long boil, with little to no dry hopping. Alcohol up on ya. Unbalanced. Imbalance? Bitterness just kills picking up the type of hop quality. Not much to speak of mouthfeel wise, just bitter."
"D - The lingering bitterness makes this one kind of touch to drink. I love bitter IPA's but this one seems to have taken it a step too far. I think this one could use a little bit more of a backbone. I probably won't seek this one out again but if you are a fan of piney bitterness then this is the perfect beer for you!"
"D - Nice crisp IPA. Intense bitterness might limit the number of these brews you can consume at one go."
"As mentioned above this is not a floral IPA but a piney, bitter IPA. I've really grown to love this beer. A gem from the other SN brewery!"
"D - Very drinkable. This beer is a treat for any hop-heads out there!"
"This is one of the best east coast ipas out there."
"Pretty good IPA, very hop heavy."
"pours a orangish yellow hazy color with a half inch of white fluffy head, fair lacing and lively carbonation. floral piney hop smell and flavor which finished very bitter. i pleasantly surprised with this beer. first smuttynose i have tried. i had heard their beers were decent but nothing special. i thought this beer was well above average and one of the better IPA's i've tried. pretty inexpensive for such a delicious beer. if you ever see one around i suggest picking it up."
"Drinkability - This has been my go-to IPA since I turned 21 and I'm always in the mood for one. Bold hops, slight sweetness to add some semblance of balance, and a lengthy bitter finish. Boom!"
"D - If you can put up with the bitter aftertaste, I could see this being very drinkable. I don't see what all the hype is about this beer, but then again, mine's been in the fridge for more than a month."
"D- not my preferred ipa formula- I jones for a certain balance that I call marshmallow... But I am definitely down for a good hop ass kickin and the finest kind left me concussed. And I'm only half-way through the pint. Seems milder from a bottle but on tap it generated a more thought provoking review. Perhaps the keg is fresher because the hops seem so much more intense. A good drinker at nearly 7% abv, but get ready for some shivering, and have some hot wings handy."
"D - A very drinkable IPA. Could sit back and enjoy a couple of these back to back."
"Since this is sub-7% abv and a solid IPA, I would love to have it around. Unfortunately it isn't. So far I think Smuttynose is an excellent brewery."
"MF/D: Medium in body, clean refreshing feel on the palate. The finish is a lingering citrus explosion or grapefruit and orange peel. Carbonation is a tiny bit fizzly, but I'm splitting hairs."
"The bitterness definitely coats the mouth, but the body is quite appropriate. Carbonation is also medium. Overall, not something I'd want to drink every night of my life, but a pretty solid beer."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium, with a medium finish. This is an okay IPA, I feel the flavors are muddled and don't have definition. Good overall."
"Poured a pint of this on a glorious spring afternoon. Love the label..two goofy old bastards drunk in lawnchairs. Look is very nice...a robust orange with a fluffy dank head, extensive sediment, decent lacing. Smell is so fresh and so clean, and hints at some choice hops. First sip...wooooh! Went down like sandpaper. Very dry feel, very heavy aftertaste. Wasn't expecting this level of dry hoppiness. The second sip was a different story. This one went down smooth as silk! By the way, it looks like a snow globe inside of it with all the sediment. Anyway, yeah, this is an IPA I can get into. Just keeps getting better and better after each sip. This stuff is no joke! It's dry as hell, it's hoppy as hell and it's got more sediment floating around than the East River, but it's a winner. The faint of heart will back away after the initial blast, but true connoisseurs (like the drunk old men on the bottle) will find this to be a tremendous beer."
"The flavor followed the nose but with a grapefruit juice presence not apparent in the head. A fine hop bitterness with a light malt presence to hold the thing together. All in all a fine example of an American IPA. Well done."
"D - A great example of the American IPA style. Big and boldly aggressive."
"I can't wait to get more of this into my fridge."
"overall not quite as good as the west coast IPA's it just does not have that taste of grape fruit or whatever acidic fruit u wanna say. Still a very enjoyable beer to be sure."
"Drinkability: my new go to american IPA. solid in both flavor and drinkability. Seek out."
"Very pretty orange color with a really nice creamy dense head that lasted until the very last sip and left some lacing that is still on my glass. The smell was all hops to me, some pine and very little citrus and malt not a horrible thing I just usually love the IPAs with a bit more citrus, and same goes for the taste. This was really hoppy and that aspect was fine, I just usually like more than just straight up bitter hops. I got some pine but that was it for me. The beer was so smooth though and I love that. Towards the end I just wanted more and I could have easily drank more. I guess in the end i prefer more of a well balanced IPA and this one was a bit too astringent to be one of my favorites."
"This beer looked amazing/perfect/the way a beer should look. It was alive, it had a solid long lasting head and it laced the glass. It was slightly cloudy and had a very appealing smell. The taste was good, strong hop flavor but not overdone or forced. If they had added any more hops to this beer the balance would have been off. Right at my limit of how hoppy I think a good IPA should be. It went down smooth, and wasnt overly carbonated. The drinkability was good, but not a beer that I am going to want many of. All around a very good beer that should keep both the hop heads and the average beer drinkers happy."
"Snuttynose IPA finestkind poured a golden color with a small head, and there was much sediment present. It had a hoppy strong smell, a good smell for beer lovers. The taste was very hoppy, bitter, and dry, a great pale ale. Its a bit bitter but not the hardest to drink. Overall very good beer and very enjoyable, but not for the light weights."
"Very highly recommended. Try it fresh and you will not be disappointed."
"Three bottles of this come as part of the variety pack. Poured into a pint glass. Golden yellow color with a clear body. Large, fluffy white head. Smell and taste were both dominated by hops, with a very pine-like and resin flavor. Good look and decent flavor. What I did not enjoy about this beer was the slightly watery mouthfeel and soapy aftertaste. Liked the start on the first sip, but did not end up well for me. Also, 6.9% for an IPA gave this beer a bit of a kick. A nice beer to have one at a time, but not one where I'd buy a six pack for a night."
"d - A nice cheap IPA. Great mix of hops and malts in the taste and a nice bitter IPA aftertaste. Could drink a bunch of these and would try it again."
"I could drink these all day. The hops would lose its personality after a few but the malt would still taste just fine. Too bad I have to trade to get it or it would be a regular in my rotation."
"being unfiltered adds to this beer's best asset, but is probably its biggest detractor, as well. the mouthfeel is perfect, but the appearance and drinkability would be higher without the amount of solid floaties. I tried not to let it affect the score too much, since I should have been more careful handling/pouring the beer."
"D: I can nurse a Smuttynose IPA for a long time, but there is no guarantee that is what I will do. A strong beer and excellent IPA -- if only it were a little hoppier, it might be my favourite of the style."
"So - the long and short is that powerful IPAs are not my thing. I like the taste being offered here, but its just too too much. The hops have taken over my mouth and are holding certain taste buds hostage. I couldn't drink another one of these - but do see how 'hopheads' would clamor for it."
"D - Exceptional. This is a beer I would keep around my beer cellar as a staple brew and a favorite go to IPA. It doesn't set the world on fire with anything extreme, but what it is, is one very solid IPA."
"D: A very drinkable, well put together beer."
"D-this is a great IPA. i've always seen it at the store but never got around to picking up a six pack. i'm glad I did; very balanced with a nice clean hop flavor and aroma"
"D- Good summertime IPA. Im glad I can find this so easily."
"The body was perhaps a little fuller than average. Drinkability was very good, just as I remembered. I first encountered this beer on a visit to New Hampshire Speedway for an IRL race, and drank considerable numbers of various Smuttynose beers and this was as good as I remember."
"A: Lots of sea froth foam on a hard pour, spotty lacing down the sides of the glass, pale to medium gold in color, some signs of sediment floating in the beer - 3.25, S: The aroma is quite earthy and herbal along with some citrus, mild caramel - 3.50, T: Solid hop bite, lots of lingering bitterness, pine sap, mildly medicinal and pungent - 3.75, M: Medium bodied and faintly creamy - 4.00, D: A solid IPA all around, well representative of the style - 4.00"
"d: Certainly a very good IPA, but I have to admit I was hoping for a bit more."
"Served with one finger of head with decent lacing. Deep floral nose along with a light citrus smell. Strong grapefruit and pine hop flavor hit hard up front with a dry and bitter finish that lingers for a while. Solid mouthfeel with proper carbonation. Put two down in short order. Very classic example of the AIPA style."
"Overall, a great beer, and it seems everything I've had from Smutty has been good. This and Racer 5 are probably my current favorites as IPA's go."
"the taste has a great bitterness and excellent mouthfeel."
"It has a bronze/gold color with a slight haze. Poured with very little head that dissipated quickly. The smell is a little funky at first, but ends with a very nice piney hop smell. There is a very nice pine hop flavor as soon as the beer hits the mouth and stays throughout the drink and for a while once the drink is finished. It goes down pretty smooth, but leaves a bitter hoppy taste in the mouth a while after the drink. I did drink this right after Pliny the Elder, and I hope I didn't knock this beer undeservedly."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rough in a hard bitter way, but not bad for this type of IPA. This is a beer that will hit an exact spot when you're in the mood for it."
"D: This is a fantastic IPA! Personally, one that I could have a lot of. Very crisp and refreshing. Definitely not an IPA to use if you're just trying to get into the style, thought."
"Although there isn't much head at all, what head there is creates a ton of lacing around the outside of my glass. The smell is hoppy, but not as much as I would have expected based on descriptions of the beer's taste. After my first sip, I understand the hype. I'm so glad that smuttynose is now available in Ohio. This beer has incredible amounts of hop bitterness. Almost a steely type of flavor with a lot of bite. This might be my new goto IPA."
"This was a great revisit. Smuttynose knows how to please a beer geek and is very underrated, IMO."
"D - Even though the ABV is not that high... this one was a sipper for me. I was trying to keep some of my taste buds in tact for the next beer. Very bold ipa... very enjoyable."
"Although the appearance is disconcerting, and the aroma is lacking in character the flavor definately makes up for it."
"D: Crisp and refreshing. Could session alot of these."
"This was a strange one for me. The aroma was off-putting and yet it tasted pretty good. But it wasn't at its freshest. Knowing this in some ways I feel it might not be fair to review this beer, but they came up with the best before date of April 2010, not me. For me the experience was a strong argument for putting bottled-on dates on IPAs rather than best-before dates."
"Pours a hazy golden hue with yeast particle suspended throughout and a slightly off white head. Lots of citrus fruit on the nose and a little bit of sweetness. An almost perfect blend of flavoring and bitter hops with a sweet malt backbone, bright citrus upfront and a mouth puckering bitter finish. Dry mouthfeel and a medium body, flavors stick to the roof of your mouth like peanut butter. This is a tremendous brew that nails it, a great beer all around."
"*This brew was significantly different on tap than in a bottle, neither better nor worse. I would say that I remember the bottled version being more ""standard"" IPA and the draft version standing out a bit more."
"Cheers!"
"This is undoubtedly an IPA. The hops offer a great floral bitterness with a smoother pine/orange finish. Carbonation is relatively mild and the beer has a medium-thin body. The aftertaste is an unmistakable bouquet of apricot-like hops. This is a satisfying execution, and it does the IPA style justice. I could easily go through three or four of these; although I do wish the hops had a *little* more bite (my brother and I prefer in-your-face liquid agression). But overall, the flavor profile is very, very well-balanced."
"respectable balance. i appreciate this beer."
"D: I could drink this stuff all night. A fine brew."
"Skål!"
"How have I not ever reviewed this beer? I think this beer began my true odyssey into IPAs back about 5 years ago. Once you taste a fabulous beer, your next adventure becomes finding out what is even better, sometimes forgetting the old friend that is your first. My road has come full circle. I've found many delicious IPAs, but I'll be damned if I can find one better than Smuttynose Finestkind IPA. Citrusy, chewy, and hoppy as all get out. Yet, that honeylike malt flavor is just amazing. And floaties? I love 'em. So consistent, and so easy to find fresh and cheap in central MA. I'm back in love...."
"Very Hoppy. Great drinkability. Quite refreshing."
"F.T.- One of the best beers that Ive ever had, the best IPA. The yeast really took this to another level."
"On tap at Alibis in Carlisle, PA. Golden color, light carbonation. Some sticky lace left behind with each sip. This beer is hard to sip, though. Aroma is pungent, with grapefruit, pine, peaches and marihuana. Flavor is luscious sweetness spiked with bitterness and suffused with the same elements that are found in the aroma. Very drinkable. Tangy, lip-smacking finish. Like smoking marihuana while chewing peach-flavored bubblegum. A highly entertaining beer to drink. A veritable circus of flavor."
"I just love this brew. Fridge must always have it. If it were less expensive and brewed closer to home, I'd drink more of it more often."
"Hops is biting, almost harsh. It arrives with plenty of attitude. Fairly dry with a somewhat mellowing hop finish and a hint of grape late. Medium-light body, good effervescence. Altogether, pretty good though I think I would have preferred it with some complimentary food rather than by itself."
"2. The potent potable of claim 1, wherein said IPA is drinkable, satisfying, and a solid representative of the style."
"Taste: Just like the smell but a lot more hop foward. This beer defines what an American IPA should be."
"Finest Kind is a quintessential IPA with a complex hop mix, crisp and understated hops, and noticeable esters and alcohols. Consistent and through from nose to finish."
"Feel is nicely full and textured, a bit fuzzy with nice bubbles and a nice, interesting roughness to complement the bitter flavours. Very pleasant."
"Drinkability- If you like IPAs, this is a fine example and plenty easy to drink. If you don't like the style, be warned, the bitterness is up there."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"I've had by far more IPAs than any other style and this is my favorite."
"Always interesting to get to sample regional takes on ""American"" styles."
"It's a clear, robust, no-holds-barred beer this one. It's unapologetic in its flavour profile, and that creates a beer worth of respect. A very good IPA - one I'll drink again."
"Nice sturdy IPA. Very solid drink and I envy those within its distro."
"This is a huge let down. I want flavor with an IPA, and this just doesn't deliver. Is it bitter? Hell yeah. But a great IPA balances out the bitter with hop flavoring and malt. Maybe this is an English interpretation of the style? Either way, I was not impressed by this one."
"D: Although it's a bitter palate-buster, it's about as drinkable as an IPA can be. Just a very well-made IPA. I had this after a work-out, and it was quite refreshing!"
"D: The ""Finest Kind"" drinks more like a pilsner on steroids to me. While there is nothing terribly wrong with this beer (despite somewhat missing the advertised style in my opinion) there is nothing special about it either. Drinks ok. If someone wants to buy me one, fine, but I would not spend my own money on it."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated May 2010. Sampled on January 14, 2010. It pours a hazy amber-copper and there is a substantial amount of sediment floating around in the glass. For some reason that surprised me. The aroma is well hopped and yeasty but it also carries some kind of bread or biscuit background. The flavor is incredibly smooth for the atypically tart IPA. I enjoy it."
"D: Quite good, but not my favorite example of the style.. Something that I would love to try again, especially on tap, but not amazing."
"I was initially excited buying this beer due to all the enjoyment reviewed by fellow members, however, after I poured the ipa into my tulip and took a wiff and taste i was hihgly disapointed. It smelled similar to a german lager and tasted similar as well, except hoppier and fruitier. I can't explain why--- being the ""drink by"" date was 04/10. Maybe I just had one of those rare good beers that turned out bad who knows...wouldn't recommend from this tasting, yuck."
"Hazy golden orange color with lots of floaties in suspension. White head dissipates quickly, but lots of lace makes its mark down the glass. Pine and grapefruit dominate the scent. There's also some tropical fruit notes like pineapple, papaya, and guava. This is very good. Tastes like grabbing a fresh grapefruit and just biting into it, rind first. It's very clean. Very faint (to the point of hardly being there) malt notes, which I prefer. Slightly slick feel going down. I think this is one of the best AIPA I've had yet. Drinkability is off the charts."
"I was very impressed with this beer."
"Drinkability:Definitely a tasty brew which sits in the gut more than the typical IPA. Fairly unbalanced yet enjoyable due to its character, not much break from the bitterness in this one."
"This beer is very well balanced, and they go down very easily. However, Smutty IPA is 6.9% so I do find that it's wise to drink 1 or 2 bottles of water when consuming the entire six pack in one night (by oneself)."
"An excellent IPA, but get 'em really fresh though as this one seems to fall apart quicker than others."
"Amber appearance with lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. Big, fluffy two finger off white head with loads of lacing. The head never disappears. Smells of piney hops and bread malts. Similar on the palate with pine, grapefruit and biscuit with a nice lingering bitter, lemony hoppy finish with some malt thrown in. This is well balance stuff. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Very drinkable - I can see myself putting back a few of these in a night without batting an eye. I am glad this is available locally - it will be part of my normal IPA rotation. Good stuff."
"D - I love this beer, an excellent crisp IPA that can easily be a session beer. Thanks to the recomendations here - this is now a new favorite and will have a spot in my fridge as a regular! Awesome"
"Pours thick orange topped by creamy white head. Sweet scents of hops, hop resin, tangerines and cream. Flavors of hop resin, oranges, evergreens, orange rind in the finish. A great thick, full bodied brew that hangs lazily on the tongue. Highly drinkable for any season."
"Bright hazy dark orange anber with a sticky clingy head and sheets of lacing all the way down. Massive grapefruit smell smacks your nose. Lots of pine, some more citrusy notes and molases is noticable. Great smelling IPA. Harshly bitter up front, but it mellows beautifully with rich toasted sweet malty molases and toffee flavors and some herbal spiciness. This stuff is fantastic. Brutal bitter hoppiness, but so much more. The flavors play off each other perfectly. Very thick substantial bready mouthfeel, but it still goes down very easy for a full grown IPA. One of the best. It strives for perfection and achieves greatness along the way. Magnificent. And two old dudes in lawn chairs with long necks in there hands is hands down the best label in the world. I love everything about this beer."
"Church Key/$5/16 oz"
"D- I COULD have a few of these, but I probably would go to another beer. So maybe not."
"pour some out for your hop lovin four legged friend."
"Other than the light color, Smuttynose IPA is as good an everyday IPA as I've had. Smuttynose nailed the style."
"Smooth, medium body, not detecting a lot of hops here unfortunately, again I'm not sure what's going on, this is not how I remember this beer being. Finishes with an odd bitterness, dark bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is fine."
"Overall, this is probably my favorite American IPA. I think its high rating on BA is well deserved and the brewers should be proud of this one. Cheers!"
"This beer is very drinkable. As hoppy and bitter as it is, I can drink a few of these with no problem. Above average alcohol but lower than some IPAs make it easy to put down 3-4 of these. Definately one of my favorites at 6 and save. Hope they keep it around for a while!"
"D - no problems working on this. delicious and a bit different than most IPA's available here. will go back to this for more."
"Got four 12oz bottles, and just poured the third. Looks very nice with all those floaties fishing around in a amber orange colour. But I am starting to suspect I have an older batch. This really lacks the flavour I was looking forward to. Its decent, but nothing is standing out with it. Easy to drink and the abv% is well hidden. But theres no personality to this for me. Tastes more like a pilsner or pale ale. Disappointed for the most part."
"M/D: A medium textured beer that is maybe a touch on the heavier side for an IPA. The tingly bitterness is crisp and smooth, and despite the lack of head or streams of carbonation, this beer had plenty of carbonation, which added nicely to the body. The bitterness does not overwhelm the flavor and character of the hops. I wish I had more to drink right now."
"D- I don't mind this beer but I guess I would have liked a little more of a hop profile but then again it's and EC IPA. Again not too bad but there are others I would reach for before this one. Glad I tried it though."
"Will drink again."
"Drinkability: A strong IPA, perfect for hopheads (of which I, admittedly, am not). Drinkable, but not in large quantities. Still, I like it and recommend it."
"Drinkability: I'm really impressed with this one. Probably the best IPA I've had so far. As hoppy as you could ask for with nice fruit and pine characteristics as well. Hunt this beer out and try it!"
"Two thumbs up to Smuttynose for creating this masterpiece."
"D- Easy to drink, but not necessarily the most desirable to drink because the flavor is on the weak side. Bitterness sort of lingers for no reason, not too bitter, just pointless."
"Taste lingers on the back of your tounge for a few. Highly enjoyable very well balanced. Really wish I had bought more."
"Poured out of a bottle into my Cally's pint glass, appearance is a cloudy orange amber color with a half inch head. The smell is piney and very citrusy with strong hints of grapefruit. The dominant flavors here are a strong dose of hops with some citrusy flavors, but it's not too extreme, and is well balanced with a little bit of malt. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a moderate amount of carbonation, and a nice creamy texture. I've had some good IPAs but this is definitely one of the best because there's plenty of hoppiness here (which I love) but it's very well balanced."
"D - decently drinkable"
"Poured into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy dark golden color with about a finger and a half of head. It has some nice lacing. There is a strong grapefruit and pine aroma. On first sip you get hit with a strong citrus hop attack. For some reason I am not a big fan. From the aroma to the taste, there is just something that doesn't sit well with me. It leaves an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. I tried this several months back and wasn't impressed and decided to give it another try and the results are the same. I love IPAs and hops galore. My only guess is that the bitter citrus flavor is what threw this beer off for me."
"Overall I find this to be one of the best east coast examples of the American IPA that I have tried. Highly recommended."
"D: This was a great IPA 10 years ago not it is almost a session beer and there is nothing wrong with that. Well balanced and drinkable IPA. Great buy for the price as well."
"D: A well balanced and very complex IPA. Anyone that loves IPAs would probably have no problem drinking this all day. It does have the typical pallet ruining hops aftertaste, however, so I would probably stick to just one of these at a sitting. Overall a very strong example of the style."
"This is my second experience with Smuttynose IPA. Pours an orange-ish honey-esque color with an average size white head with some good retention. The carbonation and condensation help to increase the deliciousity of this beers appearance. The nose is filled with citrus and piney scents with a nice bready fullness. The taste follows suit with a hint of malty resolve and a nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and appeasing while remaining light enough to keep you thirsty. The carbonation is well balanced just like the flavors. That is not to say that this isn't one of the more bitter IPA's readily available. If you've got a hop grudge then this may not be for you. But if you enjoy hops, or are looking to broaden your horizons this beer will help guide you."
"Fresh 12oz bottle. Pours cloudy gold with a medium white head that disappears rather quickly. Fairly hoppy smell, with a good amount of grapefruit. Definite amber malt. Hops initially in the taste, again with a lot of bitter fruitiness. Full, sweet malt in the background. Dry finish. Medium body. Very pleasant IPA overall--surprisingly well-balanced."
"This is a pretty tasty beer, definitely one of the hoppier IPAs I've had, but it's still pretty easy to drink. Although not terribly complex, it's an easy drinker for me."
"Drinkability is amazing for a hop head. Some may find this to be heaven some hell. I love the taste of this beer but it destroys my stomach."
"A very drinkable IPA, great for pairing with spicier foods or just as a solid standby IPA. Definitely worth returning to."
"This is an easy drinking IPA that is far from over the top. Almost a pale ale in fact, the downplayed hop character came as a surprise. Still good though I may prefer the Shoals Pale Ale."
"Vigorous pour out of a 22oz. brown bomber (best before 1/10) into an imperial pint glass. This thing started out with a nice thick, creamy head, quickly settled down to a thin but solid head. Beautiful light copper color. Left a nice ring of sticky lacing after every sip (or gulp ;-)). The first whiff of this was just straight up grapefruit (I love a grapefruity IPA!), some grassy undertones upon more thorough examination, as well as some malt sweetness just trying to break through the citrus. The taste was more of the same - grapefruit right up front, as it warmed a little bit the malt really came through and balanced this beer nicely. The bitterness is in your face, but not overpowering, very pleasant. Clean, crisp finish. This had a nice full mouthfeel with just a little bit of slickness on the tongue. Maybe the best IPA I have had that was crafted in my neck of the woods (New England), this will now be in my regular rotation for sure!! Get some!"
"This is a drinkable IPA but the bitterness is a little strong."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a one and a half finger of white frothy head. Head retains nicely and leaves behind a good deal amount of thick sticky lacing. Nose is all hops - citrusy grapefruit jump out first, with some grassy/piney notes and floral hops. Taste starts with just a hint of malts and then move in to an attack of hops. Fantastic bitter citrus hops hit you first, then some grassy hops even out the middle, some pines and floral finish the taste on this one. Light to medium body, higher carbonation - you can really see the bubbles dance in this one, crisp body with a dry finish. This is a nice IPA to sit with for a bit."
"Cheers!"
"Ok so I was right about the floral scent of this one, but it's slightly more complex than and not as bitter as the nose would have it. The malt is there only for balance and doesn't add much sweetness. Yep, this is hop heavy and only a somewhat complex. The mouth feel is fine and delivers the flavor in addition to leaving the bitter taste at the bottom of my tongue because of how thick it is. Overall...this beers not bad, but it's very standard IMO; a good basic IPA with a kick and a traditional east coast taste, but without the apricot and grapefruit I love."
"D: I was a little disappointed with the aroma of this beer, but it scored very well with everything else, and it's a great IPA that packs a pretty good punch."
"Overall: As I continue to drink it, it gets increasingly extroverted-bitter. But not in a bad way. At all. This is an impressive offering that I'd gladly have again, many times over. Try with homemade pizza, or a big, thick, loaded burger."
"Notes: My first Smuttynose beer, appropriate to the style but not a style that I enjoy."
"D: Very drinkable for the style."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a lot of visible yeast floaties. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is grapefruit, pine resin, and citrus. This aroma is like that of numerous other American IPA, and there is nothing really special about it. Still, it is very pleasing. The taste is a mass of bitterness. A lot more that the aroma leads to believe. Other than that the taste is muc like the aroma. Again, it is something I've had over and over before in different beers, but it is done well enough that doesn't bother me. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would certainly drink again."
"SWEET. Bro approved."
"D: It is very drinkable. Goes down very smooth, but does have the alcohol kick to it. A great IPA and will definitly try again."
"D: Goes down well. I can't think of any IPAs I would consider as a session beer due to their high ABV, but this is about as close as one can get."
"Overall, an easy drinking IPA for something with that much hop punch. Could be a hard one to review after drinking so many extreme versions of the style (you just expect over the top flavors) -- but you get honest fast with how good this one is. Clean balanced flavors combined with a hop dominance. Great balance and good for any time of year, and with or without food."
"i'd like to try this on tap,overall still very good."
"Overall this is a fine IPA and I can see why it's highly rated."
"D - Nice feeling really drinkable a really nice beer from smuttynose !!"
"Pours a murky slightly orangish gold with a medium to large persistent head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Aroma is big piney hops. Taste is dominated by hops from start to finish. Resinous, piney, earthy, and herbal hops. A big grapefruit note as well. Bitterness throughout just somewhat balanced by a light malt backbone. Very good. Full bodied. And excellent IPA overall."
"I'm sort of conflicted as far as a final assessment of this beer. It's not really as clean-tasting as the West Coast IPAs I tend to favor, and the hop profile is not particularly to my liking: Simcoe, for instance, is similar to Cascade (which I love) but the fact that it is so concentrated and manipulated paradoxically makes it seem astringent. On the other hand, there are enough positive attributes to this beer that, in spite of my hopelessly esoteric tastes, I'm bound to reach for another before too long."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head; lots of lacing. The smell is grain, citrus peel, grass, flowers. The taste is sweet up front, lots of grainy malt in the middle, with big tangelo bite in the finish. It's viscous and highly carbonated, good cold (but not too cold). A powerful quaff but a very enjoyable one."
"Good mouthfeel and this IPA went well with food. Quite drinkable and a nice effort by the brewmaster."
"Overall, a very solid IPA which comes with my high recommendation. Perhaps not my favorite that I've had, but quite good."
"Drinkability- Great! Very well done."
"Overall this is a great beer, one that has made me re-think their other offerings. I also think this can compete with a lot of West Coast offerings and for the price it almost can't be beat."
"12oz bottle"
"Mouthfeel - medium body and creamy texture until the courser dry finish. A good medium level of carbonation."
"Good mouthfeel. Nice bite of carbonation. Not thin, but not at all syrupy or chewy. The dryness of it really leaves the hops to be appreciated, and the balance makes it easy to put away a few of these."
"This is simply an exception IPA which delivers on every front. Highly, highly recommended."
"This is a powerful hop bomb. It is somewhat balanced by subtly rich, fruity malt, but overwhelmingly the beer tends towards the bitter, grapefruity end of the spectrum. For a hop fan, this is exquisite; for someone with an aversion to bitter this would be real challenge to finish even one. This is one of my favorite beers and certainly one of my favorite American IPA's but I must say I prefer it with food, as a lifeline for my inevitably brutalized palate."
"This IPA is dry-hopped and unfiltered. The lees (sediment) that form on the bottom of the bottle are a natural part of this fine ale. You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. I think you'll be quite pleased. ABV 6.9%"
"Purchased in NYC while visiting my sister, transported back to MN in my girlfriend's suitcase."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow with a single-finger head. The smell is a mix of different hops with orangey citrus and piney hops being the most prominent. The taste starts off with a solid malt backbone that gives way to some floral, orange zest, and then piney hops in roughly that order. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some slickness from the hops and a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, definitely more for sipping than chugging though."
"D - Well, normally I'll have written out my full review within the first six-or-so ounces of my beer but as I finish this sentence, this beer is being finished. Full of complexity and flavor, it's certainly a good beer I could keep drinking all night long."
"Probably one of my top 5 IPA/DIPAs."
"All time favorite IPA."
"Drinkability: I'm quite disappointed. With the number of reviews, and the rating of those reviews on BA I expected this beer to be packing quite a bit more punch. While I wouldn't classify this as an APA, as the bitterness is definitely there for an IPA, I feel like the hops weren't added at the end of the boil or once the fermentation died down."
"d - very good IPA; it's Pliny the Elder's more bitter east coast cousin"
"Drinkability: Quite high. I love the flavors, and it's very refreshing and balanced just enough. I think the only thing I really don't like about this beer is the label -- what's up with the old dudes in the lawn chairs?"
"D- This is a very well put together IPA. This is my first time with this and well...I'll be looking for some more here soon."
"Taste is citrus like grapefruit(oils or rind) and hops. Malt is present. The taste is very balanced and fresh. The aftertaste is very long lasting and strong. Very easy to drink. A very fine IPA"
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with spicy snacks or meals."
"Drinkability: Really, really high. This is a really nice IPA that offers solid bitterness without much sweetness. I will definitely make this a regular in my rotation."
"D - overall I think this was a decent beer as I am not a fan of IPA's but want to be fair with my review. I've had better, like Victory Hop Devil but this isn't the worst. Glad I bought the mixed 12 pack so I can try their other offerings!"
"Taste is nice. you get a nice hoppy sting with this one. The body is perfectly balanced to it though. big time piney hop aftertaste kicking in. This beer is a great IPA. I have 3 favorite IPA's: Sierra Nevada Torpedo is prolly my number one choice...Great Divide Titan IPA is Fantastic too. And last but surely not least: Sierra Nevada Celebration ale! I would definitely rank Smuttynose up there with those 3. A very nice IPA. I will surely buy this one again and I'm glad I bought a 6 pack :)"
"This impressed me. Having had 60 min ipa this stuck me as more drinkable. I had this with some cheese witch the saltyness in the cheese went well with it. I think this is a well balaced aproach to an ipa and many would find this easier to try than some other ipas if you aren't used to hoppy beers."
"Smutty hits all the marks with this no-nonsense IPA. One of the best IMO."
"D: This is great IPA from an East Coast brewer, but I can't drink more than a few of these. The bitterness is overpowering. It lingers in your mouth and on your lips long after you've finished. I prefer my IPA to be a bit more balanced, but for someone who loves that mouth-puckering bitterness, this is your beer."
"Brown 12oz, best by Nov. 2009. Pours a darker amber, lots of sediment, one finger white head remains. Smell: grassy, toasty, citrus rind, orangey, earthy, yeasty. The nose doesn't exactly scream hop bomb, but it's still nice. Taste: puckering bitterness overlaid on a sweet toasty malt background. Lemon and orange rind, white grapefruit, earthy and grassy, medicinal touch in the finish. Quite tasty, but a little odd... nearly a palate obliterater in a smaller (abv, ibu) package."
"Overall, decent IPA. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again, but it would satisfy a hop craving in a pinch."
"Mouthfeel is good and the dry finish leaves it very easy drinking."
"D- This is an all-around great beer, and it is made better by its drinkability. A 6 pack will be no problem here. Very enjoyable, very sessionable."
"D- Today, this one hit the spot. But, other days... not so much. It's a good round and full IPA, but some days it seems a bit too metallic and mineral tasting. All Smutty's seem to have this earthy harshness to them... maybe just the water used. Sometimes I like that, other times not."
"D. I will definately drink this beer again. A robust IPA plenty of flavor and character."
"D -- Incredible. I think I may found a new favorite Northeast IPA. Great job, Smuttynose."
"Recommended"
"I love the east coast. I absolutely love the east coast."
"Received from Ralphus for CanBIF5. Thanks Ralphus!"
"Overall, a great IPA I really enjoyed. Certainly worth the try. Just a terrific hopbomb."
"given the bitterness and flavor, i doubt i could go much further than 2-3 of these but overall i love this. one of the better IPA's i have had."
"The beer was bought to you by the album Billy Breathes, circa 1996."
"I notice, though I have several different kinds of beer in my fridge at the moment, the Smuttynose is what I reach for first. To me, that's the ultimate yardstick to measure a brew's true worth!"
"D: Has and will always be a great IPA and is best enjoyed outside relaxing like the guys on the label."
"Drinkability is ok, easy enough to suck down, but I don't like IPAs that are almost all bittering hops. Ultimately I'm a little disappointed, but whether or not the problem is the recipe or the age of the beer I don't know..."
"Good, but there are many better."
"D- Decent brew with lots of hoppy bitterness in the taste."
"This is a lighter bodied beer with a lot of hop character. Hops dominate this brew. 65 IBUs and you feel every single one bite you tongue on the way down. Neither extreme or traditional, this is a definitive American IPA."
"It would be very easy to put down several of these, wish I could get it here."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a lovely light copper color with a foamy one finger slightly off white head that evaporates into a thick collar. Active carbonation, but not overly fizzy. Aroma is a nice balace of sweet malt & grapefruity hops. Taste is neutral at first, with a firm wallop of grapefruity, slightly metallic hops on the aftertaste, which lingers for a good while after the swallow! Mouthfeel is light & smooth, whith a hint of carbonation fizziness on the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good, fairly light body and relatively low ABV for an IPA. Good stuff!! I'm not much of a hophead, but i'm pretty impressed by this. I could definetly enjoy a few of these while watching a ball game or at a backyard BBQ!!"
"Poured a bright, but rusty orange color with some particulate matter. Head was thick & frothy; off-white in color. Sticky lace easily cakes the side of the glass. Sweet floral hop aroma with some sour grapefruit. Taste was initially a sweet caramely malt that was very quickly taken over by a bitter hop profile - lots of grapefruit rind, pine, and herbal hops with hints of bitter orange rind. Mouth-feel is juicy at times and medium bodied. Oliy hop resins coat the palate well. The oils push the lingering bitterness almost to the point of no return at times, but is just held in check by the sweet malt backbone. Finishes very dry. At first I wasn't that impressed with this tongue bruiser, but it is a quality American IPA for the hop lover. Definitely has its unique characteristics, which helps it out when compared to other American IPAs."
"D- Pretty drinkable sometimes anything that differs from a west coast IPA seems odd to me but this is a nice change of pace."
"Edit on April 3, 2010: reviewed another bottle and had exactly the same impressions as above (no changes). I will drink this on occasion because it is local and cheap, but still not that impressed by it. Other Smutty beers are much better but not as inexpensive or widely available."
"D= Not my favorite IPA but a worthy one."
"Easily one of my favorite IPAs and definitely something that I try to keep nearby at all times."
"Served in my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' First Anniversary Party. Reviewed from my notes. This Smutty IPA was aged in a Lagavulin Oak cask. It has a golden orange color and a pure white head of soapy bubbles. It had a grassy aroma that makes one think of being outside in a field. There is a full-bodied malt taste at first followed by a very sharp hop taste; it's bitter and strong. I imagine these flavors are enhanced by the oak cask cask and a higher serving temperature, so the bottled Smutty IPA may not be as forceful with it's hops, but this cask was certainly nice. It had a medium body and left a bit of a coating in my mouth. I couldn't really taste the oak or any hints of Scotch whisky, but they were probably there, my palate just isn't refined enough to find them."
"one of the better ipas out there imo"
"Overall, a very respectable ipa that I'm sure I'll enjoy again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a snifter - head is large (a finger and a half or so) and long-lived, settling pretty slow; the beer itself is a nice, deep, hazy sort of amber you can't quite see through. Add a real nice lacing that comes as you drink and this is a pretty IPA. The smell's just as nice - pine and grapefruit and a little bit of malt. Others have chronicled how lovely this is far more eloquently than I can but the taste is nice and hoppy without being overwhelming with a good crisp feel to it. I could definitely drink this all day if I had the chance (and I suppose the two fellows on the label don't do much to hurt that sense) - this is far and away my go-to IPA and recommend it as highly as I can."
"Drinkability: For me this is a very drinkable IPA. Each sip leaves me wanting more and the balance between sweet malt and hops is such I could drink several in an evening and definitely want this one on my ""buy more"" list."
"d 4 a good solid brew that i would appreciate returning to now and then."
"Turbid color between orange and brown. The beer has a heavy yeasty/floral smell, you feel it when you open the bottle, when you pour the beer and before every sip, its there and cannot be ignored... Just from here I can say somebody put a lot of effort into this beer. The taste carries some heavy bitterness, but I would say is the right amount for a good IPA. Its the kind of beer that forces you to take another sip."
"D: For such a flavorful beer, this one is surprisingly light, which lends well to it's easy drinkability. While a little high in the ABV's to be a true session beer, this is certainly a beer that you could have multiple of in a single sitting."
"hazah, smutty. hazah."
"Drinkability is excellent. Refreshing and delicious, it is a beer to enjoy through a session for sure."
" The drinkability of this brew makes it one hell of a sessionable beer. An easy drinking, wonderfully hopped brew. Smuttynose in Florida, hooray!!!"
"D- Really excellent representation of an American IPA."
"Moderately high bitterness upfront, then disappears for a moment before coming back in the aftertaste. The wet grass hop flavor is pleasant. Not many of the malt properties come through. Slick mouth feel and dry aftertaste. A decent IPA, though I wished it were more complex."
"d - this is a big hoppy IPA if you're into that sort of thing (which I am)."
"Drinkability - Good. Smutty has gotten a real hophead favorite here. If you're looking for balance, look elsewhere."
"On tap at River Street Alehouse and served in a standard shaker glass. Had to let this one warm up a bit as the drafts here are always too cold for my tastes. Appears a hazy light apricot color with about a finger of creamy eggshell colored foam. The head leaves a nice lacing on the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. The nose is dominated by floral, citrus fruits such as lemon and orange, as well as piney hops, and sweet malts. The tongue is greeted with huge citrus flavors, mainly grapefruit juice, tangerines, as well as tropical mango, sweet caramel. Pleasantly bitter and clean tasting. This IPA falls somewhere between medium and full in body and is amply carbonated for the style. I'm fortunate to be able to enjoy this fantastic ale on a regular basis where I live. All lovers of the style need to seek this one out."
"This may be one of my favorite IPAs right now. I put this up there with Stone IPA. This is everything an IPA should be. A nice golden brew with a fluffy white head that leaves an even lace across the glass. Strong pine and citrus notes control both the flavor and the aroma. Very bitter hop flavor lingering in the after taste. Very smooth and refreshing; a great session IPA and a great summer beer. Very happy with this beer, especially the photograph on the bottle depicting two geezers getting loose in their front yard. AWESOME, buy this beer."
"i just want to re-emphasize how much I love this beer. I have tried so many IPAs over the past year and it has only reinforced my love for this one! It is definitely world class. If you like IPAs you must try this! This is the Pliny the Elder of the East Coast!"
"Carbonation follows through. Very drinkable."
"D: This is a great IPA, very easy to drink and a reasonable alcohol level (the website says 5.6% not 6.6%). Doesn't seem unbalanced like some IPAs, very hoppy but there is more going on than a truckload of hops. I want another one. Highly recommended. I wish I could get this in KY."
"Taste is like a pine forest, with citrus/lime hops. Very nice. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. A ""go to"" IPA."
"Finally got to try this one on draft thanks to the Raleigh Flying Saucer, The beer is served in a standard pint glass a very murky light orange with a decent off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves beautiful lacing. Aroma is a bit of citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a nice blend of citrus hops and sweet malts that give way to a great bitter finish that is in no hurry to leave the tongue. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent carbonation and is quite refreshing, I have long considered this to be one of my favorite IPAs, I must say, it is now may favorite draft IPA."
"Quite drinkable for sure...give it a shot if given the opportunity. Thanks to mullenite for throwing this in as an extra, cheers Josh!"
"Sampled through the efforts of Bentkentk56 and Secret Bunny 09 BIF."
"Very good IPA. If your looking for hops you will not be disappointed from a lack of hops. Lacks some balance that some other quality IPAs have, but still a very good IPA"
"D - This is a dangerously drinkable IPA...well balanced for a second...then it gets to the point...the hops!"
"This is an above average IPA. Smutty did a great job with it."
"Pours orange in color with a white fluffy head with a good amount of retention and lacing left behind. Smells of cirtus, hops, pine. Tastes smacks you in the back of the head...the smell is faint but the taste is huge. Lots of pine/hops/citrus up front and a nice slightly bitter finish. Would drink again, no doubt, but would rather have a few other IPAs if I had the choice. Just not my kinda IPA, I guess."
"This is one of the few beers I can see myself buying a whole case of, and then needing another case once I was done with that."
"D: The only thing keeping this beer from getting a 5.0 for drinkability is the same thing that gave it a 5 in taste. The intense hopping of this beer would make me worry about palette fatigue. Other than that, I think this is an exceptionally drinkable IPA."
"However nice this is, and much like a ruby red, I'd find it hard to drink more than a couple. I still have to hop- train my palate to stand these bitter rushes. Brilliant beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability - Make mine a smutty! Sounds like the best idea since sliced bread. If they all taste like this, why the hell not? Make mine a Smutty indeed. The best and boldest ipa that i've ever drowned my taste buds in. This one cuts through all the bullshit and says ""Eat hops, don't worry about any of that complexity crap. Choke on my hops!"" Oh you dirty little whore!"
"Drinkability - Damn is this great. I could pound six of these watching a ball game or BBQ'n on a spring day. It's just so refreshing in a damn this beer makes me wanna do nothing all day kinda way. In fact I would look just like the two old geezers on the bottle. I'd sit in my yard and get shit faced!"
"Moderate carbonation, mouthfeel is spot on."
"Always leaves you wanting more and at 5.8% you can have it."
"Poured a seethru light gold/yellowish body with a two-finer white head that died slowly and left some lace. A sharp citric hop aroma with some floral notes and a hint of malt sweetness. Very sharp fruit flavors come through in this light-to-medium bodied beer, along with dry/sweet malts. Sort of a mix of caramel and bread malts dance on the tongue along with fruit flavors like orange, pear, grape, lemon (a little). Hops lead to a dry backbite but aren't overly bitter. Liked the sharp contrasts of the hops and malts. A quality IPA."
"This is beer is crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is firm, carbonation level medium. Nice hop bite with each sip, but nothing that blew me away. Malts balance nicely with this one. A very easy drinker. Not a bad IPA. I'm glad I'm back..."
"overall a very nice beer...not my favorite ipa but glad its available....i will have this again as the temp warms up and we get closer to summer"
"D - This is a great beer well balanced and not overwhelming. Perfect for a saturday afternoon. This is going to become one of my go to beers."
"D: If any American IPA, particularly one that employs West Coast hops, strives to attain balance, this is the benchmark. A Fantastic IPA for anywhere, anytime, anyway."
"A great beer from a great brewery at a great price. I think the value outweighs any technical or even style preference flaws."
"D: I must say this is one of the finest IPAs I've ever had. A perfect example of how you can have hops and malts together in an IPA. I'm growing tired of one-dimensional ""beat you over the head"" IPAs with nothing but hops. This beer has balance. This is something that I miss in my American IPAs. I wish I could get this in Minnesota. I will travel to Wisconsin often for this treat."
"Thanks to Viggo for the bottle!"
"D: VERY"
"Final Thoughts - This is a great entry into the IPA genre from Smuttynose. I will definitely pick this brew up again. Recommended."
"""Finest Kind", indeed. I hope to find a fresher one to do an update sometime."
"One of the better regular IPAs I have had. Very balanced with great hop character. Available year round and at a decent price. I could definitely drink a number of these on any occasion."
"D - Great for year 'round enjoyment, especially during the warmer months. Cheers!"
"D - I was a bit leery based on the suspended yeast chunks but this beer was very good. I'd love to try this stuff on tap."
"Delicious flavor, even better mouthfeel. A very hoppy and bitter IPA for the medium-light body, which is fantastically creamy, buttery, and smooth. It fills the mouth beautifully with near perfect carbonation. Flavor is very piney, woody and bitter. Some malt sweetness, but the focus is big hop flavor. Very drinkable and totally satisfying. This is going to be a go-to for me. I can only imagine what it's like really fresh!"
"edit addendum: i never like to read previous reviews when i am reviewing...interesting the previous reviewer mentions juniper...but i don't get the 'sweetness'...so, good to know (no criticism here!) that there is very close common ground on one count and extreme difference on another. a highly recommended brew worth staying in touch with. it will challenge your expectations."
"M&D--Excellent on both fronts. There are not many IPAs I could stick with in a night. This is one of them. Restrained enough for palate stamina, flavorful enough to make you remember it--pretty much my ideal IPA. East coast represent!"
"Tasty and well balanced."
"Comes out of the tap a hazy amber with a fluffy, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong, evergreenish, and seriously hoppy, promising an excellent IPA. Flavor is ferociously hoppy so it is like drinking a pine tree - what I like in this kind of beer! Texture is edge and jazzy, yet smooth and pleasant, leaving a hoppy bitter aftertaste. Strongly recommended for IPA nuts!"
"taste is what i associate with for a great ipa. its not a west coast hop bomb, which i respect. its got a nice full, silky flavor. tons of grapefruit and hops on the palate. as it leaves the tongue it gets increasingly bitter."
"D - Not bad, it has nice hop aroma qualities, but the bitterness is a bit rough. The finish is kind of harsh, and I can't help but think that some of the bittering hops could have been better used to increase the aroma and or flavor. Overall it drinks like a rougher, less pungent version of Stone IPA; which, all things considered, is still pretty good."
"This is a huge IPA. Monstrous grapefruitiness makes this one of the more powerful IPAs out there. There is balrely any malt character to speak of which can be good or bad depending what you like. If you are a hophead, this is an absolute must-have."
"this ipa pours a classic copper orange color with a small head a good lacing.. the smell is crisp hops grassy smells some herb and malt.. the taste is ok above average.. but to bitter tasting not because of the hops its just acidic tasting its ok with a malt finish.. i can drink this one i guess but there are dozens of other IPAS that are better.. smuttynose is worth a try and one i will buy as a single again but i dont need a sixer of this on hand"
"D: Not impressed at all. I've had much better IPAs. The taste was imbalanced and unimpressive. The ""Best by"" date is July 2009, so I doubt it's bad, and it doesn't smell skunked. It just tasted like a botched wheat beer, and I have very little interest in the flavor. This was my only bottle and I right now I don't plan to trade for more. But I'll give it another shot in the future, since my experience doesn't match anyone else's. I feel I must have just gotten a bad one."
"Pours a very light copper color, but with some nice head and decent lacing. Nice scent, very balanced leaning towards citrus hops. Overpowered hoppy taste, very little malt, a lot of hops that comes off a bit strong and rough. Nice scent, a rough taste, but I would drink more of it, although there are better out there."
"The beer had a medium body, it was smooth, but the drinkability took a huge hit with that bitter metallic aftertaste. I did not enjoy this one as much as expected given the rating. Also, the beer did not taste well with spicy food. Overall, given the rating I may try this beer again, but not for awhile."
"D- Overall, Smuttynose IPA is a really solid IPA that I really enjoyed. Highly Recommended."
"D: Fresh tasting and satisfying a thirst on a warm day. A must try for hop heads. Too bitter for my tastebuds because I can not taste other flavors in beer after this one, but to have more of these is ok."
"D - This is certainly a testament to IPA balance. As opposed to cracking you over the head with hops and nothing to fall back on, this beer has a great malt backbone offering up a hint of cracker and a firm, clean foundation for the grassy/herbal hops. Excellent. I could easily consume a few pints."
"Overall this is a wonderful ipa. I absolutely love it, I consider it my favorite ipa. One of the most amazing qualities of this beer is its lacing. Everyone one I have drank has left a beautiful lacing covering the entire glass, simply remarkable. I highly recommend this beer."
"Poured a hazy golden color with a nice big head that faded to lacing. Smelled grapefruit and other citrus smells. Taste was well balanced with bitter hops but a smoothing malt finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability is good although there are others in this style that I would choose before this one."
"Re-review. I think the first bottle I had was bad. Small layer of frothy head on top. Nice orange color. The hop character is prevalent. Not a whole lot of complexity to this one. Just some bitter hops up front. Overall, a decent IPA, but not my favorite."
"D - Maybe this is just me, but I can't drink too many IPA's on account of my mouth hurting."
"Overall this beer didn't disappoint. I may throw this into the rotation of everyday beers - definitely give this a shot."
"Poured a great hazy golden orange. Frothy white head and great lacing. Lots of floaters, but thats what you get in an unfiltered brew. Not a real stong smell like some IPA's. A little grapefruit and hoppy pine. Good bitter hoppy taste, nice and dry. Very easy to drink. A little metalic feel lingers in the mouth. Will be even better on a nice warm summer day."
"(sort of makes me wonder about an experiment. I'll bet that if you take a Brown Dog and do a half and half with this and it would be an interesting mix)"
"D - Smuttynose has made a decent, solid example of an IPA but there's not much here to keep me coming back. The flavor is somewhat lacking but everything else is pretty much in order. However this brew gets lost in a sea of much worse and much better IPAs."
"Best Before - yesterday."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a one-finger, frothy head. The smell is all hops; citrusy like lemon and pineapple, resinous and piney - a nice hop bouquet. The flavor, while being hop dominate, is pretty well balanced with the initial piney, citrusy hops coming out first followed by the bitter hop bite and finishes with a slightly malty grain finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy, viscous carbonation - chewy is a good descriptor. Overall, a drinkable IPA, very good indeed. The only criticism that I can offer is that the hop bitterness lingers a little, but what can you expect from an IPA?"
"D: I think there are a couple better candidates for American IPA session-ish beers (Mayflower, Greenflash, sometimes even Ipswich), but don't get me wrong--I'm a hophead and this beer rocks."
"One of my favorite ipa's out there. Highly recommend it to anyone that loves bitterness and sweetness in an ipa."
"The ""Finest Kind"" is quite fine indeed: easily drinkable, with a dryness that keeps it coming, and that wonderful American hop aroma that makes for a great American IPA. Highly recommended."
"Definitely a great american IPA, I really enjoyed this one."
"This beer reminds me of Sierra Nevada celebration ale. It's a very well crafted beer, but the grapefruit is too overpowering for my tastes."
"I really want to give this one another try soon from the bottle."
"Very solid offering from Smuttynose!"
"Not bad, but a bit out of balance on the bitter side. Plenty of other IPA's I prefer, but I'd give it another chance."
"Dr: I could easily do more than one. This could be my new hammock and a book beer."
"D - A nice beer. Easily sessionable."
"D - If you like IPA's, this is a very sessionable brew. I have yet to be dissappointed in any of Smuttynoses offerings...they have proven that they know how to brew a beer!"
"Overall: Great IPA. I'd recommend picking up one of their mixpacks if possible, just so you can get at some of their other brews. I'm quite a fan of Smuttynose on the whole."
"Finest Kind yes indeed"
"Pours a cloudy dark orange, very nice colour, tangerine like, medium sized off white head forms and quickly drops down to a thick ring around the glass, some decent lacing is dropped on the way, good retention. Smell is nice, quite hoppy, grapefruit, floral, orange peel, very citrusy, fair amount of sweetness behind the hops, caramel and toast, some biscuity malt, bread, more hops, light fruitiness and a really nice citric acidity, smells good. Taste is nice too, quite hoppy, grapefruit and floral, orange peel, tangerine, some fruitiness, lemons, nice sweet middle with some honey and caramel, biscuity malt, toasty drying in the finish with a big grapefruit bitterness, light spicy. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, nice balance, but still a real strong bitterness to it. Really nice and drinkable IPA, not a total hop bomb but enough going on to be pretty enjoyable."
"Bitter, crisp, and dry. A very pungent IPA that is refreshing and drinkable."
"Pours a golden, amber, copper color that you can see right through. One or two finger foamy, tight bubbled head. Lacing begins immediately. This beer smells strongly of grapefruit and passion fruit with a bit of a spice note (peppery?) Taste is very smooth, hoppy and fruity. Strong citrus notes as an aftertaste. Very light mouthfeel, but not too thin. Glad I saved this beer for about a half of a year. I got used to drinking standard IPA's (Hop Wallop and Hop Devil, Stone IPA..the list goes on). Served nice and cold and this beer is phenomenal. Hop fans hop on this beer!"
"I am extremly pleased at the change found in this brew. Whereas many IPA's simply become a little too sweet after a few, I could see a 6pack quickly dissapering in my near future. Well done."
"Pours a glowing, hazy orange with a small white head that settles to a sudzy rim. Citrusy, zesty hop aromas singing loud and proud, with a bit of sweet malts in there as well. Taste is absolutely sublime. A crashing wave of grapefruity goodness from start to finish, lingering for what seems like days. Honeyish malts that don't ""balance"" the massive amount of hops so much as blunt the sting. I'm not a major IPA lover but still recognize a work of art when I taste it."
"Overall, this is a great everyday IPA. I just wish I could get it everyday."
"I've had a handful of Smuttynose beers before and have enjoyed them, this one might be the exception. If I come across another bottle I'll give it another shot and see if I just happened to get a bad bottle."
"D - This beer just begs you to take another sip after sip after sip. I could easily see putting away a few if I'm in the mood for a hop blast."
"Draught: This one pours an orange tinged golden color. There was a bit of a white head on it, and it leaves some lacing down the glass. Decent enough aroma. Hints of citrus and piney hops, with some faint malts coming through. The taste is quite good. A well balanced IPA with a fair amount of bitterness. Flavors of both grapefruit and pine give it its bitterness. A Very Good IPA."
"D- very good! me like!"
"Hazy orange with a nice, sticky lace. A real kick in the face hops-wise. Extremely piny flavor with a bit of citrus and a balancing sweetness, but the bitterness does linger for quite a long time. A strong pine smell. Very fizzy but the bitterness and stickiness don't make for a good session beer. A good example of a hop-heavy American 2IPA, though I prefer the more citrusy West Coast versions."
"D: Wow, this is really good. Surprisingly refreshing for the style. I like how yeasty and spicy this is into the finish. An impressive take on an American IPA. Will definitely seek out in the future."
"Had this again last night with dinner and it was even better. Very floral, citrusy scents."
"New to the Total Wine in GSO. Have to say I'm surprised by how good tis brew was. With all the IPA's flooding the market most get caught up in the wash of being just good, few standout above the rest. This one does. Nice crisp orange color, slightly hazy because it's unfiltered. decent head, but not overwhelmingly frothy The nose isn't heavy on the florals like Two Hearted, but the first sip gets your attention very quickly. This one is a pure hop bomb, and drinking one behind a Ruination IPA, the bitterness level seemed to be about equal. Nice finish, easy to drink if your into IPA'S, and easily surpasses most common IPA'S Won't disappoint."
"While the orange color is light and closer to yellow than amber, it has a gauzy translucency which deepens it, good one to two finger head of white whipped froth and strong lacing. Unassumedly penetrating nose of white grapefruit, lemon citrus, wheat and rye, pine tar, flower blossom, dry and hoppy without forgetting to allow the tight package to soak in enough to be enjoyed. Medium-bodied, there's a fun interplay between the sneaky carbonation and the general inclination towards woven balance, sometimes dancing nimbly across the palate, sometimes wanting to grip it firmly and make it listen to the message. Playfully bitter hops and yeasts contribute to an erect posture in the mouth, The white grapefruit, mandarin orange, lemon citrus alternately sweet and sour. The pine and wet tea leaf notes persist, the floral dimension needs more 'tude to get heard. Can't say it ever tastes ""malty"" but this element doesn't cushion things here and there. As close to a ""sessionable"" IPA as one might ask for."
"A very nice IPA with a great flavor. Very nice hop presense, never had a beer with such a solid grapefruit presense. The only thing i didn't like was the hop debris that was quite prominant, doesn't exactly make me wanna drink it. To be fair, i've had this before and never noticed that before. Still tastes great!"
"D: Pretty fair overall, I could drink quite a few of these if I wanted to, it wouldn't be my first choice though. A good IPA, but not great."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Was surprised that this IPA was as good as it was. I have heard many times that West Coast IPA were the best, this one can be put in the top five."
"Bottled label visuals are something else, that should be some extra points for creativity. Humility? Honor? Justice?..."
"Excellent beer from start to finish. A great aspect of IPA's that never gets mentioned is that they are the only beverage that tastes just as good when burping."
"Taste is very hoppy of course, pine and pineapples flavors with a hint of citrus come in play. Very unbalanced, very into the bitterness and the hoppy bitter than everyelse. A hit in the face bitter that leave a shy aftertaste with a watery mouthfeel."
"Pours a bronzish orange with a fine white head. Tiny rising bubbles and yeast particles are visible. Produces a hoppy, citrusy smell. Initial sip is very smooth and light, followed by some quickly-dissipating harsh bitterness. It's hard to believe a beer with that kind of bitterness (although it is very brief) could be so smooth and drinkable. There's a nice malty backbone that balances it out. Citrus notes like grapefruit and possibly some lemon present in the taste, though they give way more to the herbal notes, slightly grassy and some pine notes, although not as much pine as was in Great Divide's Titan IPA, which preceded this beer on my list for the evening."
"D- Excellent! Sort of a novelty these days, a nice well balanced IPA."
"Slightly slippery, resin-y feel. Good carbonation. Very good drinkability. In fact, I think I'll crack another right now."
"(*Note: I didn't take notes and won't factor it into this review, but I once had this beer from cask, dry hopped in the pin with Nugget hops. THAT sample was nothing but outstanding!*)"
"this is an amazingly drinkable beer. When you see this IPA GET IT!"
"A very solid IPA overall - worth checking out!"
"m/d - Not sure if it's the bite of the hops but it seems to be a little on the high side of carbonation. Light and crisp. Could put a few down, but I'm not sure about an all night session beer."
"Drinkability is superb. You just open your mouth and the next thing you know it's gone"
"Thick, lumbering and earthen it's like the anti California IPA. My usual at the after work watering hole."
"When a beer says ""finest kind"" on the bottle, how can you pass it up? Picked up a single bottle of this in Onalaska, WI. Best by date of May, '09. Orange with yellow edges, small off-white head, some nice lacing. Aroma of bitter grapefruit rind, pine and sugar cookies. Not much aroma in the way of anything particularly ""kind."" Flavor has a nice bitter grapefruit flavor backed up by some pine sap, lightly sweet pale malts, but mostly pine needle. Flavor could be a little more balanced, but the nice oily hop flavor is always welcome. Aftertaste is virtually non-existent. Medium bodied, slick, decent carbonation. This beer is pretty darn tasty, but not quite as balanced as I like my IPAs. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? Not quite."
"D: An excellent presentation for an American IPA. The mixture of hops and the zing produced can put the boys from New Hampshire against any of the California Hop heavies I say. A wonderful drink and I highly recommend to all."
"A pretty good IPA overall, but not my favorite. I'm not too big on the piney hops and this one is dominating in them."
"Very good IPA. More citic than some but with the same high quality hop flavor. A tad of piney hops, but mostly just well rounded floral hops and a good bitter bite. Quality hop texture, flavor. Not too bitter either, well balanced hoppy beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep orange/golden color with a two finger off white head that leaves great lace on the way down. Smells of grapefruit, caramel, pine, yum. Tastes of caramel, pine and resin. Lingering pine bitterness in the finish. Medium body, crisp carbonation, oily mouthfeel. Great refreshing brew for sure. Another great brew from Smuttynose."
"d- Drinkable, although for me the finish aftertaste turned me off slightly towards the end. Despite that, a great IPA and a very refreshing brew."
"Reviewed on 4/23/08. Bottle. Pours orange with a small white head, some sediment. Leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma and flavor of flowery hops and wheat. A little more bitterness than other IPAs. Quite drinkable and refreshing. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Dark golden with orange highlights; small sediment chunks drifting around. Not much for a head. lacing is there but not quite as much as I expected from a hoppy American IPA like this one. A little funky smell with plenty of piney, leafy hop aroma. Malt and yeast comes together to give off yeasty bread aromas. Bready malt profile doesn't quite hold up against heavy leafy sharp hoppy bitterness. A little bitter grapfruit juice in the mix. Definitely West Coast style IPA here. Finish is bone dry with plenty of bitterness - not in a good way. Mouthfeel is very tannic and sticky with a good level of carbonation. I think I need a glass of water to soothe my mouth after this one."
"Overall, I was quite disappointed. I would not buy this again, as there are so many other IPAs on the market that I liked a lot better than this."
"D: Taste is mostly grapefruit with some yeast and a great hops flavor."
"overall, another quality beer from Smuttynose, my favorite east coast IPA to date. definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: Becomes more drinkable as the glass drains, the bitterness becomes easier to handle."
"A bit thin in mouthfeel, but the carbonation is just right. A surprisingly drinkable IPA, highly recommended!"
"This is an unusual IPA. Very light in front, followed by a hop bomb bitterness. Weird, but I do like it... Somewhat."
"Overall this is a decent IPA, a bit sweet, but i think this one is a bit aged, so fresh I think this one could be a bit better. A palateable brew."
"D: I have had many, many of these. Many."
"Overall - Very nice IPA. It's easy drinking as the tartness makes your mouth water and beckons you to drink more ; ) This would be a good choice with buffalo wings!"
"D - I could drink a couple of these. Call me crazy but it kind of reminds me of a super bitter aprihop or #9 though the actual taste is more grapefruit. Overall a good beer but I was expecting to like it a little more after such positive reviews."
"Light to medium bodied. Mouthfeel is a bit oily. Drinkability is great. This is one bitter, delicious beer."
"D- A very solid brew, that's easy to drink and enjoyable. I think this could be a nice session brew as well."
"Tastes of citrus hops and a balanced malt finish. A tasty brew with a good carbonation level. A slight dry bitterness in the finish is a bit limiting for me, yet the reasonable ABV and solid flavor make this a highly drinkable IPA."
"D: A good taste for an IPA and an amazing mouthfeel. Definitely a very drinkable beer overall."
"Drinkability? you bet. If you don't LOVE hops though, you'll completely hate this beer. I think it's astounding. Highly recommended."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel, medium bodied, carbonation is just right. Good drinkability. Aside from the slight vegetable twang, this is a very well balanced IPA."
"Quite an enjoyable beer."
"D- I could drink this all night"
"I poured a 12 ounce glass into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a hazy orange with an impressive white, sticky head. The smell is quite potent for an IPA. The pine scent is strong in this brew. The taste follows the scent. This is heavy on pine with a hint of citrus. This beer has a wonderful aftertaste that sticks with you. The beer has medium body and is quite drinkable for the abundant amount of hops. A very fine drink!"
"D- Decent carbonation, could enjoy a six pack but not many more than that."
"Wow, like to know the IBu's on this one? Pours an oft straw colour, with a nice craggy head. Lacey, lacey, all the way down the glass. Not that an ipa should be, but this one is not balanced for the ""hopheads", very much splatering of bitterness on the back end, however has a good malty backbone. Beautiful looking and pretty easy to drink. Clean, crisp mouthfeel with plenty of hoppy grapefruit on the palate. Nice brew, we need to get this in Ohio."
"Thanks to seanpachedeffdda or however the hell I spell his name."
"GC"
"D - Not overly bitter, not too sweet, not too dry and no astringency. This beer sits right in the middle and im more then ok with that. 6 pack definitely, if this makes it past the night, it surely wont live past the weekend. Drink up and get more."
"The beer pours a dark burnt orange color. Hazy with a number of yeast nuggets diffusing around the liquid like pulp in orange juice. The aroma is strong and citrus--mainly grapefruit--all the way. A little pine wisps through as well. The hops charge the palate, never to be repulsed. A ghost of malt does hover above it all but never but is not haunting enough to scare the bitterness away. Loads of grapefruit citrus again with a twist of pine in the flavor. Surprisingly clean on the palate and dry at the end but still thirst-quenching. If you are into citrus hops you'll be as happy as the two old farts on the bottle when you try this stuff."
"D: I'd kill a 6-pack of these on the beach anyday. I wish it were more of a summer climate as I'd enjoy this beer a little more."
"Reviewed again here in 2009 and right there again with the best IPAs on the market. This beer is nothing short of phenomenal and does not get enough love, myself included."
"Smuttynose represents the IPA well! I'd never be disappointed to find this beer in my glass."
"Heavy-medium in body with fine carbonation. Superb drinkability."
"D - I had this via a growler a few months ago, and I definitely enjoyed it better then. I remember this being somewhat ""West Coast"" like. This is definitely on the bitter side as far as American IPAs go, but overall it seems a bit unbalanced and unrefined. I had higher hopes for this one. Perhaps I will revisit this one with an ""on tap"" review."
"We had a friend tote 2 cases of this down from up north. As soon as it was uncapped...the smell it me...WOW! This is hoppy and it's going to be great. And it is. A perfect example of a west coast IPA. It's unfiltered and pure. To date, probably on my top 10 IPA list. Wish I could get it locally. It's a treat."
"Drinkability: Shit, I'll have another right now! Great balance, great taste, great feel. Stay thirsty my friends ;)"
"A very good IPA from a local brewery. Only iffy thing for me is the appearance, a little too cloudy and some floaties visible.. this could possibly be due to how it was stored though. Taste wise it's magnificent and close to my favorite, Abijah Rowe from Cambridge House. A hoppy delight!"
"Pours a mundane peach-amber - not as impressive looking as other high quality ipas. No real head to speak of. However, it smells great - grapefruit jumps out. That is especially evident on the tongue. It is fresh and refreshing - bitter citrus notes dominate with a slight sweetness in the background. A hop head's delight without being ridiculous. A great ipa. Good mouthfeel, and great drinkability."
"D: This is another good example of an IPA. It's pretty well-balanced and has a solid taste to it. Nicely done."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and light, leading to a good level of drinkability."
"4/3.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"Mouthfeel is bitter and good, a very drinkable IPA for me."
"This has been in my backyard for years and I'm just getting to it thanks to the ""Stone vs. Smutty"" thread. OK, it's not Stone IPA but it's very very very good. Awesome."
"Pours a slightly amber golden hue. Fairly cloudy with easily-noticed sediment throughout, this seems uncommon. Hops have a very crisp piney scent to them. While lacking the intensity of double ipas and other hoppier beers the hops here have that same focused strong scent. A bit of tangy citrus aroma and floral notes besides the hops as well. Tastes wonderful. The hops become more medicinal and sharply floral. The citrus is present but more subdued than in some ipas. A sweet nutty flavor too, unsalted peanuts I think, that becomes stronger as the beer finishes. Mouthfeel is superb for an ipa. Chewy and broader than most ipas it has a highly rounded medium+ body, especially for an ipa. Finish is long, nutty and has a remarkable hold on the pallet and mouth. An exceptional underrated ipa."
"Drinkability This is a great ipa and i will enjoy this one again and again and again."
"With that said, the beer is an available, easy-access IPA most can enjoy."
"Just a really good beer. I try to catch it on tap every time it is fresh. Recently tasted at Union Brewhouse in a shaker pint. Pours a nice dark orange color with a compact white head. Decent amout of aroma, consisting of orangey hops and some fresh cut grass. Taste is sharp and full. Lots of hop presence- mostly citrus. Rally good bitter finish. A real solid beer- glad it is almost always available!"
"D- I think I could session this one nicely. Hopefully they are coming to GA soon, as expected."
"Bought a six pack. Pours dark golden blonde into my pint glass. A whole lot of stuff floating around in the beer. I normally don't see that much floating sediment in an IPA. Moderate head with nice lacing. Smells of citrus and hops with a touch of pine. Definitely not a real powerful aroma. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Taste is hoppy with a little bite, but not too hoppy. The hops are well balanced with the citrus and pine. Some bitterness lingers after the swallow. A very good and drinkable IPA."
"This is certainly a good example of an IPA and I really like the intense bitter-hop profile."
"D-Aside from the cloying bitterness this is a great beer. Thanks to thaichile for the trade. Smuttynose is here but is pretty hard to find. I'd like to try Big A next."
"Overall a very enjoyable American IPA. Nicely balanced between malt and hops."
"D: This is an excellent and palatable IPA."
"IPAs are not really my thing, but I'm trying to diversify my palate and will try to rate this to style rather than preference. 12oz. bottle served in a tumbler. Poured a translucent copper with a half inch, tight white head with a fair amount of residual lacing during the tasting. Bold aromas of grapefruit and piney hops. Taste follows nose; losts of citrus astringency and hops bite. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and very lively without feeling overcarbonated; lots of residual bitterness lingers between quaffs. Goes great with a salty snack, but really pushes my hop envelope; not a go to brew for me but I can appreciate its qualities, relative to the style."
"Had this on tap at the Harrisburg Brewfest. Fully diminished white head. Aroma was bitter with spruce and pine resin with some citrus/grapefruit. Didn't taste much of the Siimcoe of which I'm a hug fan. Color was deep gold. Bitterness lasts through the entirety."
"Really well done, distinctive from other IPA's while anything but bland and uninteresting. Sweet, bitter but not loaded with bitterness, a slight fruitiness, well balanced delicious brew. Bravo."
"If I want an IPA this is one very solid beer."
"This is indeed one of the finest IPAs I've had and a great example of what the style should be. No watered down or half-assed hop essence, just a pure hop whallop."
"D: The best IPA I have had thus far from the East Coast. Very true to the Midwest and West Coast ideal of bitterness in an IPA. Very well done."
"I've sampled it in the bottle and on draft and it is always very tasty. Pours a foggy golden color with good amounts of head and lacing on the glass. Grapefruit hoppy aroma. A strong grapefruit hoppy taste to it, slightly sweet, with a bitter, slightly sour finish. The more I drink this the more I like it. I recently drank this, then followed it up with another IPA I thought was as good (Harpoon). No way... this is much better."
"Bright orange color in my glass (how vibrant!). Clearly thick chunks of sediment floating in it (?). Weak retention of the pearl-colored head that quickly fades to a thin ring. Appealing aromas of ripe apricot, citrus and floral hops in the nose. Flavors are dominated by the punch of citrus hops, most notably grapefruit. So much so that I feel its one dimensional. Bitter all the way through but as it warms the biscuity malts begin to emerge. Medium bodied, good carbonation but feels a little misbalanced to me."
"Very happy I got to try this. Thanks again Jason."
"D: Drinks nicely if you can handle the bitterness. Not as refreshing as some other IPAs, but not bad at all. Goes down easy."
"Picked up one of these in Wiscoland. A tasty IPA that I'd have plenty of if it was a local beer."
"D: Pretty damned good. I feel that I may get a bit of heartburn if I had too many of these, but still very good. I could definitely drink at least one of these a night if they were in my area. Really nice IPA."
"Appearance is slightly hazy orange with a tight off-white head and decent lacing throughout. Aroma has that familiar American IPA nose of moderate piney and citrusy hops along with a restrained grainy and graham cracker-like maltiness in the background. Flavor is bursting with moderate American hops right up front with a decent malt backbone to carry the hops. Flavors of peach, apricot, and fresh grains support moderate to moderately high hop bitternes. Mouthfeel is medium but this beer has a fairly harsh aftertaste from all the hops as I near the bottom of my glass. I prefer a more balanced IPA but this beer will be liked if not loved by all you hopheads out there."
"D-Very good, gets to the point quickly, great all by itself or with a robust meal, always seems fresh even out of the bottle, hey it is an ipa after all. Drinkabilty is off the charts when sampled off the tap. Smuttynose IPA takes most of the west coast IPA's and bitch beats them into submission. Really gives many double/imp IPA's a run for their money!"
"Reviewed this a couple of years ago in the bottle, but had it earlier this summer at Deep Ellum and thought it better on tap, or perhaps just the recent version is that much better, or it was fresher. In any case, I thought it was worth reviewing again. Pours amber with a white head that sticks around a bit and very decent lacing. The smell has very nice piney hops, and this same pine is found in the taste in a long piney bitterness. The malt is there, but it very much plays second fiddle. The mouthfeel is downright spicy from the hops and medium bodied. Really enjoyed this beer this time around."
"D - I liked this beer quite a bit it has an enjoyable taste to it I think that it could be a sessionable beer thats worth trying sometime"
"This is a great IPA that I would definitely recommend. If you can't get it you should get in touch of some of us east coasters to hook you up!"
"Nicely crafted IPA with good hop flavor and low residual sweetness."
"It's refreshing and bitter, with a great consistency and strong hop presence. Overall a nicely drinkable IPA."
"This beer pours a very nice yellow orange color. The smell and taste is very citrusy, I LOVE the grapefruit flavor here. The mouthfeel is near perfect and nicely carbonated. This beer is very well balanced and one of my new favorite IPA. The abv is a little too high for this to be a session beer for me personally but I could easily drink a few of these. Probably the most drinkable IPA I have come across."
" ~ This is a nice IPA. The all in all quality is good and I'd certainly recommend it for a sampling."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a touch heavy on the carbonation. The hop juices coat the mouth leaving a wonderful taste. Incredibky drinkable IPA."
"Nice session IPA IMO, but the hop combination would grow old after a a pint or three"
"Tastes much better than the smell, nicely hoppy with a lingering bitterness in the finish. There's enough malt to give it a good balance and this makes it very easy to drink. Smooth with a mild carbonation level."
"Notes: I've wanted to try this one for a while and glad I finally had the chance to ingest it. An IPA I'd gladly drink if it were available to me."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Very refreshing with great tastes and a very complex, rounded hop profile. One of my favorite IPAs, very easily found, highly recommended."
"Near perfect drinkability. One of my favorite IPAs and a staple in my fridge."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a golden color with slight haze with a wonderful 1 1/2 inch head that lasts and lasts with great lacing. The nose is as hopy as can be. The flavor is brisk and bitter and just grabs all the senses. There isn't much more to it. The malt holds the brew together, but the clean citrus hop flavor is fantastic. Not much in and IPA can compare. Nice work, definitely the finestkind!"
"Wonderful."
"Growler from Consumer Beverages. Hazy gold when first poured but clears up after a while. Great aroma of pine, grapefruit and lemon peel. Bitter, piney and very dry. A refreshing beer. This is my favorite East Coast IPA. A wonderful beer from a great brewery."
"A joy to drink and a fine example of how good beer should be."
"I'm revisiting this after way the fuck too long. Best by June 2012. The nose has plenty of lemon and grapefruit, dry, quite bitter and a touch herbal too. There isn't much malt to speak of, though a dry, caramel note is present. The palate takes it up a notch, with a creamy, bitter blend of juicy lemon, grapefruit and orange peel. Mild sweetness is present on the back end, but this is so wonderfully resiny and bitter, it's hard to fault. Not as aromatic as some of the best West Coast IPAs, but hot damn, this gives a lot of them a run for their money . Exceptionally good, especially at the price point."
"Dark gold color with light wispy head and small active prickle. There are chunks of sediment floating in the beer and I first started to panic thinking it had ""turned"" unitl I referred to the label and found the very comforting word ""unfiltered"" and then read on to find the words ""sediment is natural."" Some hops in the nose and light grainy hints reminiscent of some wheat beers. Fresh attack and some sour notes in the flavor. Some notes similar to juniper or the flavor of gin towards the finish. It doesn't quite feel like an IPA to me. Standard mouthfeel however, but just ""different"" taste wise. I gave it a C on my drinkability scale myself."
"I will say drink this beer fresh, it is the only way the hops explode."
"A good IPA and worth a try."
"It pours a hazy copper, with a lively head that collapses quickly to excellent lacing. The smell is slight, but with clear, slightly grassy hops. The flavor is strong, malty with grassy hops and a pleasant but not overwhelming bitterness on the back end. The mouthfeel is robust with a light bite of carbonation. This is a delicious, flavorful, pleasing IPA."
"D: Still a very enjoyable IPA, but the draft version is not quite as excellent as the bottle version."
"Not a bad IPA at all. I'm not sure it's one of my favorites, but for a sheer hop blast that still has a little balance and isn't too boozy, it's great."
"Pours a gorgeous golden-orange color, with a pretty substantial foamy tan head, crazy lacing, and untold amounts of tiny little floaties in the glass. Smell is just a citrus bomb, tons of juicy grapefruit, some resinous pine, really nice malty background. This one's hoppy!! Grapefruit and pine hop flavors just slam into your taste buds, but there's almost a mellowness to the malt character of this beer, really keeps things balanced. Huge and lasting bitterness on the back and sides of the tongue, creamy, medium-bodied, not-too-lively carbonation, perfect for the style. This is an IPA I could never tire of, one of my absolute favorite beers!!"
"D: I have to say that this is not a sessionable beer. Certainly drinkable, but more than two would be difficult for me. I need to try this on tap to compare. EDIT: Certainly a sessionable beer when this is fresh. I should have known that my first experience was off, because I have never had a bad experience with this brewery until then. This and Leatherlips are about as close to a West Coast IPA as it gets in New England. Well done. Points off for Julios for mishandling this brew a few months ago."
"M/D- good body to this IPA, being that its unfiltered it has a bit more weight to it but that is not a bad thing. This makes for one hell of a session beer."
"12oz bottle in a pint glass. What a wonderful IPA! Most IPAs are bitter, but lack the hop aroma/flavor. Not this one. Incredible hoppy aroma and nice thick white head that stuck around. I can't wait to get some more. Maybe I'm just not that familiar w/ Simcoe hops, but this beer made my day with the lovely hop aroma and not overly bitter for the style. I absolutely loved this beer. I'm going to try and brew a clone of this wonderful IPA."
"Had this a bit back and then I noticed more of a grassy wet hop character. Not experiencing it this time though. But overall pretty good IPA."
"Notes: Got this one from dyan. Thanks!"
"HV"
"This is an IPA that someone can find refreshing on a hot day. It's not to chewy but still gives a good amount of hops for those who want them. Recommended."
"D - a good drinking brew anytime."
"D-Could put a few down, but alittle too drying on the end to keep drinking these"
"Very nice product."
"D: At 6.6% ABV this is a session beer IMO. Very good example of the style, not my favorite, but very good. Skal."
"Throughout the entire beer, I was thinking to myself that I couldn't believe how much a difference the dry-hopping made in the cask Smuttynose IPA. In March I had a cask of the IPA that wasn't dry-hopped, and I wasn't at all impressed. But this dry-hopped version was great."
"Pours a clear gold to orange color with a two finger white cloudy head with great retention that leaves solid lacing all the way up the glass. You can see the yeast floating around in the beer. Hop aromas of grapefruit and tea, yeast and some peach. The up front taste is of grapefruit leading to a floral, lemon hop flavor with a dry, bitter lemon rind finish. There is a toffee malt flavor coming in and out throughout the beer. Medium body, medium carbonation, starts with a creamy mouthfeel but leaves it gritty. Easy drinking IPA, the hop flavors are there but not overly aggressive."
"it is very hoppy and seems overwhelming at first. each sip gets a little more focused in taste, and every aftertaste seems stronger than the last. full of flavor, but you have to be ready for it."
"drinkability: I only have this single bottle but man I wish I had more. Good shit."
"Very good beer, glad to know its readily available near by."
"A superb drinker, for sure. My pint dissapeared mighty-fast."
"Best by September and poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice orange color with a small head that leaves lacing on the side of the glass and quite a bit of sediment floating in the beer. The aroma is a little weak with some citrus and a mild malt smell. This is a nice one it has a great taste of grapefruit, citrus and some nice pine notes to it with a slight malt backbone to it. The beer has a good amount of carbonation and leaves a dry bitterness to it. This is a nice IPA with a lot of hop but lacks a nice balance with the malt. Probably one of the smoothest IPA's that I have had."
"Notes: There is a nice medium carbonation which is fine,but and there is a but. This brew was really god, first review was not so good,but I really appreciated this beer a lot more the second time around. I believe this is a fine example of an IPA."
"The body is moderate but difficult to pick up with the hops. Nice carbonation to support the malt and hops equally. A nice resinous texture that emphasizes the finish. Could use a bit more smoother but really being technical here. Overall a very nice IPA."
"This is by far one of the best IPA's I have ever had. Lots of bold hops taste with a strong hops aroma. Very hazy when poured with a nice off-white head. Great overall beer for an warm sunny afternoon. I took a tour of the plant last year and was very pleased not only with cleanliness but the laid back workers who seemed like they were there to have a good time not to bring home a paycheck."
"D- Definitely drinkable but needs more balance for my taste"
"D: A nice take on the American IPA. Very clean and crisp and especially nice on a hot afternoon."
"This has always been a good go to ipa for me, but has fallen off my radar recently given the other choices around. It does everything well."
"Light bodied, smooth feel, good and drinkable but you might get the bitter beer face."
"D-Nice. Not too malty, not ""too"" hoppy (if there is such a thing!) This is a well balanced eastern IPA."
"D: Make mine a Smutty and I'm good with two."
"A medium golden color, with a bit of amber hue. a quater inch head forms and it dissolves away, leaving a film on top. A mild malty fragrance at the start, followed by a grassy, grapefruit, spicy scent. The malt is dtrong at the front of the flavor and is soon overwhelmed by the hops. The hops bring a grapefruit bitternessmidway, followed by grassy and earthy flavors; finishing with a bit of a tobacco flavor. The slight tingle of carbonation at the front, having a thin feel blending to amore of a medium feel. It finishes with a medium dryness at the backend of the palate. This is a very good IPA, solid in every category. Throwing some spicy mexican food at this beer is excellent."
"D: For me it seemed heavy for an IPA and while I would have another, this one filled me up really well."
"O: Overall a long overdue friend that I was more then happy to see. Highly hopped, great malt body with a punch of dry citrus and wow factor that hits the spot as one of the bigger and more easily attainable ipas (in my area at least). Finest kind is aptly named and I promise we will meet more frequently in the future."
"Smutty really puts out great beer and having this for the first time on-tap was so good. I highly recommend trying this beer!"
"D: This is a damn good very sessionable AIPA. Goes to show that you can have ""extreme"" levels of smell, taste, and mouthfeel without ""extreme"" levels of alcohol."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied with excellent carbonation. Mouthfeel is a great example of the style. It's got just the right amount of thickness. It's smooth and doesn't have a light, slippery feel to it. Drinkabilty is very high especially in light of its relatively modest abv. This is an impressive and excellent IPA. I walk away wishing it was available in Ohio. Unfortunately it's not distributed here. Dammit...."
"This beer is a good, solid ""go to"" beer."
"Agressive our into a pint glass yeilds a two finger head of low density foam. This quickly fades to one finger pillowy head with small bubbles. By the end of this beer the head is still hanging around but fades to a thin skim of protective foam, with some lacing. Color is a coppery daker than average honey like color. There is a slight cloudyness to this beer. there is not too much of a smell to this some light hop aromas and somevery light flowery notes. There is a litlle bit of malt aromas if you really search for it. I feel like there shoud be more to the nose. I put it down for a while drink a little water then try again, I think I am picking up some white bread scents but very faint. Taste is hops up front but not overwhelming there is a nice bit of malt there to back it up. As it warms a little and given a good shake I feel like there is a bit more malt character coming through, this beer has a nice clean hop finish that lasts. Mouthfeel is light and nice IPA refreshing. this one is quite easy drinking and very refreshing. Definitly could get in trouble on the beach with this one this summer."
"an earlybird in my IPA tasting ; pours a cloudy light copper-gold w/ a fluffy whit head which lasts a good bit leaving a pinhole lacing completely covering my snifter ; a piney, cattish hop aroma with some cereal grains underneath ; a decent hop bite initially, grapefruitish citrus and some caramel malt at midway, a bit on the thin side for the hops, not quite enough malt to balance it out ; a med. body, dry and well-carbonated, makes it feel rich ; a decent brew for sure, i'd put it on my top Am. IPA list..."
"The label is awesome too. Please, if you like IPAs get a hold of this, this is best, like the best. Seriously, no seriously, like the best IPA. I'm not one to ever say something is the best, I've just had so many IPAs over my beer drinking career and I just can't not think this is not the best. Please, send me a message if you know an IPA (it'd have to be a much lesser known IPA because I've tried lots) that's better because I want it."
"Very rustic, rough, flavorful & drinkable. This would, at the very least be a competitor for ""Desert Island Beer"" in my book."
"Hazy amber/orange appearance wih an average size white head and very good lacing. Aroma evolved from fruity sweet to fruity citrus along with some resin. Similiar hops dominate the taste and are off set by earthy, lightly toasted malts. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel; dry, bitter, durable finish. Well constructed and consistently good."
"This was very pale colored, looking more like a Bud Lite than anything else. It smelled of nothing but hops, and the texture was fairly watery. It had a much stronger than average hops flavor up front and all the way through. Overall it was a typical one-dimensional IPA that wasn't very easy to drink, but not bad either."
"D: Decent IPA... nothing stellar... but solid all around."
"Note to Smuttynose Brewing: Revisiting the marketing strategy with Cy and Paul would not be a bad idea. In my humble opinion, its quiet genius would only be reinforced, and possibly raise the awareness level to an already standout brew."
"D - Highly drinkable, I look forward to more of these as the weather gets a little warmer! Highly recommended."
"I'm generally not an IPA fan but this is one I'd consider putting this on tap at home"
"A strong hop IPA, but not over done and remains balanced."
"Very tasty IPA"
"hazy dark golden with a great white head that holds well and leaves beautiful lace. nose and taste are well, well, well balanced. caramelly malt with citrusy, piney, fruity hops. i've had this beer many times, and i always think it tastes like true true english style meets east coast meets west coast. i'll have another and another and another. thanks smuttynose!!!"
"D: Very drinkable and keeps me interested. This feels like a summer yard work beer for some reason. I'll have to get a 6er in a few months to see if it fits :)"
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber with moderate lacing. The aroma is big on grapefruit with pine and biscuit malts. The flavor adds touches of apricot and grass/herbs with the grapefruit, which is borderline too strong. Really, the citrus here really fills your mouth and lingers. It reminds me in a way of the Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner for over the top hops with an earthy edge. If you're looking for a big, hoppy beer, this is a great candidate."
"Poured from the bottle to a bright reddish-orange with medium thick off-white head that lingered well and left okay lacing. Surprisingly, the nose was pretty muted, but the mounthfeel was the sharp, tangy citrus I expected. Taste was a very good, very pronounced hoppy grapefruit, all leading to a long, tangy and dry finish. A most enjoyable beer."
"Easy to drink. Easy to enjoy. Nice job, Smuttynose!"
"D: It is a solid IPA that is hop heavy without being oppressive. The light ABV and medium body make this a nice summer brew that can be consumed in multiples with little effort."
"A slightly murky, golden appearance was what I saw, and it also had a little head with lacing. Strong hops and citrus aromas were apparent with the drink. The tastes were great: tangy, bitter and citrus flavors, which were pretty strong. The carbonation allowed it to be refreshing crisp and dry. Overall, a strong IPA in its flavor and attributes."
"This is tasty and very drinkable - went down almost too easily!"
"Recommended..."
"D - I could definitely do a few. Good rendition of an American IPA. Recommended."
"I regularly pick up this beer as a standard that is a gives satisfaction."
"I prepare my tastebuds for crunching down on this one... two-finger thick white head that leaves a rather even tracing...golden orange body with heavy sediment and slow effervescence--without meaning insult, like duck sauce? Bright hops and a citrus explosion in aroma... works at the front and bottom of the tongue; malts send little signal late; little effervescence in the mouthfeel... a standard American IPA, rather medium-to-full bodied with aggressive hops and a lingering taste... alcohol is disguised well; the sharpness, combined with its almost chunky sediments, makes for an experience that could be called robust... a bigger and enjoyable experience indeed...and yet, I seek forgiveness for not beign able to see this beer for more than this: another quality American hopped-up IPA"
"Smutty rarely disappoints."
"This beer has crazy carbonation, a matter of fact when I opened it the foam jumped out of the bottle. When I pour it into my Duvel glass I get four inches of head and 2 inches of body. Head is of white with huge crackling bubbles that leave scattered lace. Body is a hazy amber straw colored. Nose has the zest of foamy hops and a slight mineral, spice character. Enters the mouth very silky but quickly yields to a dry spicey hop feel that is even and long on the mouth. Mouth feel is very crisp and nicely enjoyable. This beer drinks well and makes a decent summer refresher, but would stand up well to a meal also. Hops on the finish turn almost citrus rind like. Solid."
" This is my staple session brew. It is an IPA with hair on it's chest. More hair that many doubles but without the pesky malt, just whats needed and nothing more. This, my friend, is the shit."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. One of my ""Go To"" beers. Definitely an above average IPA from Smuttynose."
"Pours a nice hazy yellow-orange color with a thick and tall white head that laces the glass very well. It has a nice piney, citrusy aroma from the hops that is really nice for an IPA. The taste is excellent as it delivers on just that taste. The piney and cirtusy hops layered over the toasted malts make for a very good taste. The mouthfeel is good. Very crisp like most of their ales. The drinkability is high for an IPA, higher than most. I like this beer alot and it is definately worth it for the hopheads out there."
"Sampled at City Beer Store in S.F. Wasn't the biggest IPA fan at the time of this tasting, but this was nice, and not smack you in the face hoppy. Had a really great floral fruity hop smell. Nice bitterness that rides the line between too bitter, creamy, and slight sweetness. Light to medium strength medium lasting bitter hoppy finish."
"If I could get this here, it would be a steady session beer for me. I loved it! Thanks, zutmin!!!"
"I knocked this beer down slightly on drinkability because of the intense bite and acrid character throughout. It is just too intense and one sided for me to have too many of. The beer pours a golden amber with cloudy bits in the glass, some head and retention. The beer is light to medium bodied and plenty carbonated. The smell is very nice hop esters, oily hoppy notes, pine, some lemon, biscuity aromas too. The taste is hop, hop, and more hop. There is a very pungent grapefruit tang to this beer that you'll experience from the nose to the finish and all the way through. The beer has some slight complexity in addition to the hoppy bite, perhaps some florals and some interesting yeasts. The mouthfeel is very dry, mouth puckering, and quite interesting. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Wow, this brew certainly lives up to the hype broadcasted from BA's. Alcohol is well hidden and it is an absolute joy to drink. My only wish is that Smuttynose makes its way to the Buckeye State."
"D = An extremely good American IPA, I can see this becoming one of my standard go to IPAs."
"If you're a hop head, then you'll love this beer. Although I feel that this beer is way over hopped with not much complexity."
"D: This would be good with some spicy food but would be tough to have more than one on its own. Overall though a good IPA that I enjoyed."
"D- very drinkable, the 6.6% is well hidden and does not show in the flavor or smell."
"A pretty good IPA, I prefer Dogfishhead IPAs, but that's just me."
"D- The hops are big and bold here, this is a very bitter single IPA, wish there was a little more malt balance, but overall solid and easy drinking"
"Notes: Excellent IPA, however i am a prejudice hophead. It is in my top three favorite IPA's with Brooklyns IPA and Blue Points Hoptical Illusions. Bitterness is comparable to the bitterness in Blue Points Hoptical Illusion but Hoptical has more robust malt backbone and perhaps less attenuation. Damn good beer."
"Final Statement: One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Very good beer."
"D:This is a good every day drinking style IPA."
"A very ""hoppy"" brew that I could drink a lot of, man I wish this were available locally! Nicely bitter but balanced, I believe I like it better than the Bells Two Hearted which is the only beer I can think to compare it to. I hope I get to sample more from this brewery!"
"The appearance is a slightly hazy orange-amber with a small white head. The smell is very hoppy along with some citrus. The taste is exceptional. Juicy citrus up front along with a piney hops flavor. The strong but tasty bitterness lasts throughout and lingers into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium-bodied. The drinkability is very good but the 6.6% ABV will catch up to you quickly. Overall, this is a top-notch IPA that I'll surely return to."
"Had an opportunity to try this on draft from a location in the city. I don't believe I'm going to make any changes to my initial scores, but there were a couple differences I noticed. The piney tastes were not so apparent on this serving. Like another fellow mentioned there ""it tastes like eating a joint," and it seemed fitting, really. Very herbal, and citrus - along the lines of the orange-peel notes mentioned previously."
"Drinkability: This is one top notch or should I say Finestkind IPA out there? Either way, I will be sure to enjoy this one again in the near future. I know it's a heavy hoppy IPA, but I could easily see this as a session IPA. It's just too good to pass up!"
"A very good IPA. The appearance is an orangey-amber color with a good sized head. Abundant citrus and piney hop flavor is the big story. It's an IPA that lets the hops shine through but is not overly bitter or hit-you-over-the head hoppy ( a minus for many but fine with me). This results in a satisfying and drinkable IPA from Smuttynose."
"Deep gold with a white frumpy head. Aromas of grapefruit and toasty grain. I liked this IPA because it had some east-meets-west hop character, but built on a solid malt frame. The toasted malt profile was prominent despite the decent hop presence. Medium bodied with both a hoppy and malty finish. Another example of the finer arts of east coast ""balance."""
"I've had this on-tap and I remember it being slightly smoother. Regardless, an outstanding IPA."
"D- A wonderful session beer- The low price point is a striking contrast to the high quality, making this a beer that can be easily sipped on or chugged as the mood strikes you. The mid ranged alcohol by volume makes this work as more than a single serving beer when the occasion calls for it, and the delicious hop taste makes it a beer that I don't mind drinking all night long."
"Nice copper/orange color. First things I noticed were little things floating in the beer, a little offputting, but I had been warned. More of a floral than a citrus taste with a very hoppy bite at the end. Not as good as a 60 Min or a Two Hearted, but not far behind. I'd pick it up again."
"D - Tasty and drinkable. Better than most."
"A medium body and creamy mouthfeel aid this one nicely, but I just can't help wishing some more of the fruits from the nose made it into my mouth."
"Poured cloudy amber with fast head. Some light citrus smells, definitely smell the hoppiness. Nice finish with a slight bite."
"Pours a fairly clouded amber. Hoppy nose with pine attributes. Flavor profile carries the same with a strong citrus and pine character that is strong, but not a complete hop bomb. Overall very drinkable and smooth. Even as well. You can't really ask for much else than what you get."
"A STRONG IPA!!!!"
"Very smooth brew, but almost a bit too plain-jane for an IPA. Slides down easy, just needs more hops."
" As time goes on, and he brew warms up a bit you get another level of flavors that is even more interesting....the fruitiness! Orange peel, cumkwat (spelling??) and pineapple. The range is restricted for acidic fruits and not sweet-based red or dark berries. The acidic level seems really high...and that's what most hop-heads look for....hop bite. And this brew delivers that. no problem. The smooth and now...semi-sweet malt pops out even more as time goes by, often I find if a brew is a little on the frigid side, the hops will dominate totally, leaving you with an odd bitter-beer face, until it warms up and other flavors come out. Be patient. Beer drinking is fucking zen-tastical!!"
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy golden color with a medium white head. Strong lacing. Aroma of amarillo hops and citrus. Nice mouthfeel. Flavor is very bitter with a strong grapefruit flavor to it. Has a lot of pine in the aftertaste. Not one of my favorite IPAs."
"If I had everyday access to this beer it would stay in my fridge by the six pack."
"Pours a bright golden orange color with a nice white head that left some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is of nice grapefruit hops, not extremely strong but nice and juicy. The taste is of grapefruit hops, and in a big way. Quite a bitter grapefruit rind blast. A sweet pale malt presence tries to mellow out the bitterness but is of no match. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture and of course it finishes bitter. This is a very good AIPA. The harsh grapefruit rind hop presence is not my cup of tea but I still recommend this brew."
"Drinkability - This review might feel like I was being hard on this brew, but I really did enjoy it. It's just that I really expected a lot more after hearing such good things and for some reason the lack of balance (can you say HOPS!!!) really didn't wow me as expected. Still it's a good brew and you should definetly give it a shot."
"D: Would absolutely order again. Great tasting, good bar beer."
"D: I had heard a lot about this one so expectations had to be met. It was very refreshing and very good. Lets remember how much of this I drank over the summer...Police concert at Giants Stadium, backyard BBQs, etc."
"I would drink this a lot, I feel if I could get it. I love trading beer!"
"D: Falls quickly - a real hop-head's delight. I'm almost sorry I shared the rest of the 6-pack with the guys at McGuire."
"(D) Very drinkable except for the lingering aftertaste. It wasn't a huge issue though. I had 3 20oz imperial pints."
" Excellent session IPA for the Hop Head - fresh tasting with a wonderful soft mouth feel from the subdued, natural carbonation."
"Along with Dales Pale Ale, this has become a requirement for my refrigerator. I have grown to love the silty orange appearance (because I know what to associate it with), and the smell jumps at you with floral simcoe and amarillo. The taste is a balance of strong hops and solid malt backbone. The two together somehow leave me with impressions of grapefruit, pine, and even passionfruit. The mouthfeel has a nice bite to it and a lingering bitterness that begs for another, but you have to be careful with the 6.6%."
"Although not a standout this is a pretty solid east coast IPA. It would probably be a good introduction to the style for someone just starting out in the IPA world."
"this was a cloudy orange with big floaties. white head and lacing was decent. nice bouquet of resiny citrus and sweet doughy malt with a hint of alcohol. taste was a nice interplay of malt sweetness and sharp hop bitterness. the latter dominated, leading to a long, bitter, astringent finish. medium-bodied with a nice level of carbonation. not bad but not great. still better than any english ipa, though."
"D: Smooth, settles nice, and full of flavor."
"Overall, a very refreshing and well made brew. Very drinkable. Good for the style."
"I'm a huge hophead, so I naturally give this beer high marks. It's big and hoppy and will catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it. The ABV holds up nicely, and at 6.60% it won't knock you out, but it will catch up to you in time. Try this beer if you like hops. If you're new to the style and aren't yet sure that you're a hop fan, try to buy a single, or a pint at the bar, and let your taste buds awaken. This is a damn fine brew."
"One of my favorite IPAs you can buy, another triumph for Smuttynose."
"This IPA I never get tired of drinking. I go all the way to Capone's to buy six packs, at least one a month. It pours an orangey strawberry blond color, and smells citrusy. It has a medium mouthfeel, not too sticky, sharp kick of hops, grapefruity yes, but also bitter leafy plant-like, juniper or maybe pine or grass. There is an awesomely ""deep," dry, bitterness which melts down into my tongue and its there long after a sip. the sweet caramel butterscotchy wonderfully subtle malts both mellow, yet linger with the hops, although you don't notice them for a loooong time after the bitterness fades. then the bitterness comes back!! This flavor activity makes my mouth water and thus this beer is highly drinkable to me."
"My first sampling from the brewers at Smuttynose. Too bad their offerings aren't available in my area. I would like to try them all."
"Flavor boasts bold hops up front and throughout. Citrus elements and a touch of sweetness round out the dominating hops."
"Soft and almost creamy, not too heavy, not too light mouthfeel that makes this beer extra sessionable. Unbelievable how very drinkable this IPA is! The 5's are fully deserved."
"Tastes of piney hops, a touch of alcohol and the malts make sure they get their dues. Has a great bitter finish."
"This beer isn't too filling, it has a medium, slightly syrupy body. I can totally see myself having several of these. It may become one of my regular ""hop-craving"" six packs. It pairs very well with seafood."
"D: tasty, but something is just not right."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a small white head. Aroma was a grapefruity hop. In the taste, malty with a small taste of a grapefruity hop. A sticky hop mouthfeel, with a hop aftertaste. This IPA was mellow enough, but also hoppy enough. Big but easy going. A nice east coast IPA."
"recommended"
"A decent IPA, hop character is a little boring (but definitely not bad) and the finish isn't too satisfying, other than that pretty good beer."
"A light amber colored brew with a nice thick, off-white head and very nice lacing. The aroma suggests peachy hops, a little sour, but overall pretty delicate. I wondered if the bartender had mistakenly not sent me an ipa when I got that first sour mouthful, there was a hops presence along with some apple but the hops were struggling. But after a few tastes the hops begins to overtake the sour apple side, it mellows and really grows on you. It has a wonderful body and substantial feel with nice carbonation. It is very easy to drink though it does remain on the tart side (not too bitter really). Overall an excellent effort by Smutty again. Will drink this one any time."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a two finger head. Good retention and sticky lacing. Aroma is definite citrus hops with some sweet malts. Taste is very well balanced grapefruit/orange hops with enough sugar to keep the bitterness from overpowering. Exceptional flavor and balance. Not too resiny. Mouthfeel is smooth and not sticky. Highly drinkable -- if it were available locally I would snatch it up regularly. Would love to try this on draft or out of a very fresh bottle. Exceptional IPA!"
" Overall, a fantastic IPA. I am really diggin the smuttynose brews now that I have had two in one night, pretty damn good I must say. I will definatly be on the lookout for some more. This was definatly an IPA of the finest kind!"
"Overall- Pretty solid IPA. I was a little turned off by the initial taste, but pleasantly suprised with the nice clean finish. Unfortunately i got this on a trip out of state, so once my 6pack is gone, thats it."
"poured a slightly hazy light golden brown, topping off with a bubbly white head that seemed to dissipate quite rapidly with time. the condensation rose up from the depths of the glass to add to the size of the head, though its retention was a little less than satisfactory. the initial smell was tangy citrus followed by a bitterness that i could taste in my nostrils. the taste was all that was promised by the smell---only there was more citrus and a mind crunching palate bending amount of bitterness that continued through the dry finish. the drinkability was supreme, and the sticky oily mouthfeel was right there alongside the bitter explosion in my mouth. it's a good thing people like more ibu's in their beer. the smuttynose has certainly found a niche for its target audience."
"This beer is simply one of the best IPA's around. Not many brewer's have the balls to put a beer straight into the bottle as it is and that is what you get with the smutty IPA. Raw unfiltered hop flavored beer. I have tried about 60 different IPA's (single and double combined) and this is by the best single american IPA out there. Although i believe it can only be found in the northeast, if you can find it buy and enjoy it. It makes me not envy the west coast so much."
"Pour a nice golden color with lively carbonation and a curious sediment throughout. Very nice. Smells of strongs hops, always look for those in my IPA. Also citrus, orange peel and floral scents are very present. Had a nice bitterness and the strong hops that the smell promises. Citrus with a slightly dry finish. VERY drinkable. Love this and will add to the rotation."
"Not a bad IPA but there are many that I prefer. Honestly I can't remember experiencing such a dominant hop bitterness since I knocked off the last of my case of Victory Hop Wallop. Could use some more balance and less reliance on bittering hops and more on flavor hops."
"As to drinkability, I thought it was pretty dull, bitter, and boring for an IPA. Still of course, it beats a BMC by a mile any day."
"Drinkability - Definitely a beer i plan to have around! Wonderful balance and great lasting flavor."
"Pours an orange-brown with a nice quarter-inch white head. Some sediment floating around, which i always take to be a good thing in an IPA. Wet hop odor, musty and piney. Nice malty tones on the nose as well. Flavor is laced throughout with a grapefruit taste and sourness. Malt carries the hops well and adds a biscuity quality, which moves in later and melds well with the bitterness on the finish. A nice full-bodied IPA. very tasty."
" This is a reliable beer that doesn't let you down. If you want an IPA with great flavor, that you can have just one or a six pack, this is your beer. I will defintely get this again!"
"Poured from a bottle showing ""Cy and Paul whooping it up."" The beer is a very hazy light colored amber with all sorts of particles floating about. I assume this is yeast and maybe hops, but who knows. The head dissipates to a thin off white that leaves beautiful sticky lacing all down my pint glass. The aroma is hoppy grapefruit. While this IPA can be a hop head's delight it isn't overpowering in the sense that your pallate is worn out after. It's a drinkable IPA. There's very little carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel that's absolutely delightful. Pairs well with salmon."
"Nice job."
"Overall, this is one of the best American IPAs, Ive had, besides the well balanced Sea Hag. Very drinkable, this is one fine beer, one could have several in a sitting."
"Nice, light beer with a lot of character. Very drinkable and crisp."
"The beer pours a ripe apricot color with a small amount of head. The aroma is of citrus fruits and some piney notes from the hops, great combo. The first sip encountered some malt sweetness, continues with some lemony flavors and ends with a nice bitter and dry finish. Then its a nice hoppy journey throughout. This is a very enjoyable and extremely refreshing IPA"
"Poors slightly hazy with a finger or head. Smells of allot of bitter hops, hard to pick up much else. Taste starts bitter with some nice piny hops working in and finishes with an almost lemon bitterness, with some malt flavor also coming in at the end as well. A good mouthfeel, quite drinkable, a solid example of an AIPA"
"Very easy to drink at 6.6%, works as a summer refresher. Good beer."
"Overall any exceptional AIPA - one of the best."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Provided you're a hophead, this is a session beer. Grade-A IPA from Smuttynose."
"Poor mouthfeel and drinkability."
"D- It was a good IPA. It was too straight forward to call complex. While it was decent, there are so many great IPAs coming from U.S. breweries that I don't feel the need to seek this one out again."
"Thanks goes to zutmin for this and the Robust Porter as part of a trade."
"Impressive IPA. Hits the spot. Will put it on the buy a 6-pack list."
"12oz fresh sample with dec. 07 notched on the label. Golden, orange color looks great in the glass. This beer gives great head and drops lace all the way down the glass. Aromas of pine, mint, and citrus. The citrus notes are mostly of straight up yellow grapefruit(no ruby red here) and orange-mint. Taste is huge with all the same flavors as aromas. The maltiness is quite sticky as evident in the sticky lace, and some stickiness must be attributed to oily hop resins. A hop bomb. Hop juice that you dream about. Nationally underated. Passed over by many BA's. Give a fresh sample a try and review it again Skeezy. Cheap by the 12-pack and easy to find in most grocery stores in New England. Seek out and quaff mister."
"Overall, I like it a lot. I will be getting some more of this soon. It would pair well with spicy foods."
"Overall, I'd like to see more balance, and a darker hue. I do enjoy the unique hops. It's good to see a brewer branch out from the standard American ""c" hops with regard to an IPA."
"pours golden orange with a large off white head that holds very well and lots of sticky lace. grapefruit pine and citrus come though fairy strong in the nose. strong grapefruit rind, very bitter, lots of hops, ending with a lingering after taste. medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. you will definitely like this one if your a fan of ipa. this ones a little to strong for my taste."
"A pale gold beer with a thin white head and a ton of floating junk, yeast and some chill haze and maybe some other stuff, not very appealing. Ok the smell is a bit better floral and citrus hops out front with a surprisingly strong sweet malt backing I don't know maybe a bit weak all together leaves me wanting a bit more. The taste is intense grapefruit hop flavor with fair bitterness yet amazingly well balanced with solid maltiness underneath. General bitterness ranks pretty high also. Mouthfeel is pretty solid subdued carbonation does enough to move the beer across the tongue without making it too light. The finish is very dry with a long lasting bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is ok I've had better IPA's this is different with the high level of very acidic citrusy hops, but the floating particles are a bit of a turn off."
"Scott"
"Overall, this was a rather hoppy IPA. The bitterness and dryness were a bit overwhelming. Nevertheless, the beer was crisp, flavorful and refreshing and would be a perfect accompaniment to summertime barbecue foods."
"Notes: This went well with blackened chicken and cajun fries -- the dry, lemony bitterness cut through the spice nicely and cleansed the palate. I would definitely recommend it. . . ."
"This is heavily hopped beer even for an IPA. Great freshness."
"I got a recommendation from a friend to try this beer, and it was great advice. This is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. The taste is complex, extremely hoppy, and slightly bitter. It has a very rich texture and will not disappoint. If you want an IPA, buy this one next time!"
"12 oz bottle (with one of my favorite labels) poured into a pint glass. Poured a beautiful hazy orange/gold blend with decent head. Lacing on my pint glass was quite noticable even quarter way through the beer. The aroma was of hops, mostly in the grapefruit spectrum- when you smell this one you know you will be drinking an IPA for sure. This one left my mouth very dry tingly with hops. This one tip toes a long the lines of a sessionable beer because of the great flavor/drinkability but the ABV is too high to truly session. This is a phenomenal IPA, something I could drink over and over again. Constantly in my fridge. Cheers!"
"In the end there is something missing here. This would be a great beer if it was not an IPA. Maybe I spent too long on the west coast though i do love Victory hop Devil."
"Clingy mouthfeel with a slight alcohol flavor in the finish. Overall, it's obvious to see why this IPA is so well-regarded."
"Had on draft at the Chapter House. A good IPA, very demonstrative of the style. Lots of hops in terms of grapefruit and evergreen in both the nose and the taste. Malt comes through, but in a light and nutty way. Just the right amount of bitterness which gives a nice fruity finish."
"One of my favorite IPA's"
"To justify the high scores I've given this beer, I'd like to add that it has a good balance between all the various factors of judging a beer."
"Poured a golden-orange color into a goblet. Very hazy with some suspended sediment visible. Slow-rising bubbles and a short-lived cap on top of ale. Fruity hop and a biscuity malt smell. Smells kind of earthy as well like an English style of hop possibly Goldings? First taste was definitely a huge bittering hop blast with a very long finish that made me thirsty. Kind of an earthy taste as well. Bitterness felt throughout mouth, not just on rear sides of tongue. Medium bodied with a sharp carbonation. Drinkability was decent and would be even better for me if the finish wasn't so long and bitter. This made me thirst for water or another drink, just not another Smutty."
"Straw colored body with a white frothy head. This must be an unfiltered beer, there are a lot of floating chunks in it (or did I pick a dirty glass?). Citrusy aroma - some pineapple and grapefruit. The taste is sweet at first and then is followed by a bitter grapefruit-like taste in the end, which hangs on the tongue awhile. Maybe too long afterwards. Not a bad beer, pretty drinkable, but the lingering bitterness is kind of a negative for me."
"D - This beer seems to be overrated. Taste is okay, a nice balance of hops and malts but there is also an unnatural sugary flavor there as well."
"Pours a cloudy light golden. Fluffy white head, with excellent retention,and lacing. Smell is of citrus,and pine. Body is medium with some carbionation. Taste has some sweetness up front, but then all hops. Piney throughout with a nice grapefruit finish."
"Must try IPA, go get some!"
"Thanks to drseamus for the bottle."
"D: Awesome session brew. Highly drinkable and extremely satisfying. Finest Kind ""BUD"" in a bottle. Recommended."
"This beer had the unfortunate circumstance of precluding my first tasting of DFH 90 minute, so, naturally it is difficult to judge without bias. That being said, this was a wonderfully hoppy brew that I could definitely see myself drinking in the future. The hops dominate the senses, so in that respect we don't have a lot of balance here, however this is certainly one of the better IPA's I've had. Cheers!"
"This is my favorite IPA. I would have to agree that this is by far one of the finest IPAs to come out of New England. If you haven't tried this beer, grab as much as you can for your next barbeque ... you will absolutely NOT be disappointed. I could drink this all day, every day"
"My first Smuttynose brew. Pours a cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, some small islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, slightly malty, nice grapefruit, and caramel. The taste is hoppy/malty nice balance, nice little grapefruit flavor through in, nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty IPA, would definitely like to try again. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: NIce balanced IPA that drinks superbly on cask"
"Typical smuttynose, this beer is expertly crafted, eminently drinkable and makes me glad to be from NH. Think I'll have another..."
"Cheers"
"Poured into a pint glass. Cloudy orange with a nice head that leaves intense lacing and is sticking all over the sides of the glass. The nose is dominated by grapefruit with a little pine and slight floral character. The taste is extremely bitter - the hops hit you upside the head. This is relentless. Excellent stuff here. Very well carbonated, which lends itself well to the overall crispness of this beer. I could drink this like water - very tasty. Reminds me more of a double IPA die to the insane hoppiness - regardless, this is great stuff. Highly recommended."
"D: If this weren't severly lacking in taste, it might be a decent beer. However, this one doesn't do it for me."
"D: If you're a hophead (like me), this is a delicious beer that seems to get better with each sip, and then each bottle. Probably too much alcohol to session with, but I'd put this back every chance I got. Excellent."
"Drinkability - Yeah, I think I'll be making sure that I keep some of this around so that I have it whenever I get the craving for a good, balanced IPA. Nothing crazy, just a solid, drinkable beer."
"I'm not going to lie. I've been lead to believe this is a fantastic beer. I'm thinking its an average IPA. The appearance would be good if not for a large amount of junk in it, particulate matter floating about, making it kind of hazy, but mostly dirty looking. The head was nice though, and lots of lacing and good color are the saving grace. Aroma is a little wimpy, good, but wimpy. Hop oils about, a little pine and some citrus, some mixed fruits. Taste is pretty much the same, could be fantastic but I'm just not that impressed. The mouth is a bit thin, carbonation maybe a little high.... I don't know, I can't quite put into words here what i'm thinking beyond ""eh, this is a decent beer"" and ""man, for the money, I can get better."""
"Thanks a lot MuenchenerKindl for the bottle!"
"D- its a real good IPA, however its not as crisp as i would like, having the heavy hoppyness stick around long enough."
"The taste is very hoppy, but not bitter for the sake of being bitter. Nice citrus undertones to go with the smell. Great body and easy to drink. I'm glad I picked this up!"
"Took a bottle from the fridge and immediately poured it into a glass. Appearance was almost identical to the Bells Hopslam I had right before it! This one was also cloudy orange/amber in color with a pillowy whitish/light yellow head. The head was big on this one, and retention was excellent. Not really much of an aroma, though what I did detect was pleasant and somewhat sweet, almost a little like vanilla. Nice medium/light body with perfect carbonation. Taste was very well balanced with a nice strong IPA hop finish. Didn't taste a lot of malt due to the hoppiness of this beer."
"The beer pours a dark straw to light amber color with a three-finger head to start, which took a good amount of time to die down to a bumpy covering. Label states the beer is unfiltered, and it has a very cloudy appearance through the glass with some particles floating around, which I see no fault in with an IPA. Smell is dominated by citrusy hops, with a faint trace of malt trying to get through. Flavor starts out with a huge bang of citrus hops and also some pine. Hops remain as dominantly constant through to the finish with the malt trying to sneak through without much success toward the end. The intensity of the hop bitterness is so high that it almost lends an astringent feel in the finish that lingers for a while. This is probably due to large use of some very high alpha acids and not off flavors. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is at a nice level. This is a nice drinking beer with a bang of hops. The astringent feel in the finish drops it a few points for me, but this is a nice big, hoppy IPA."
"D- I would certinely sit down and have a few glasses, possibly one of my favorite IPA's that I have tried."
"D: There's nothing more boring than an IPA that just tries to outbitter the rest. Thankfully, this doesn't do that. It showcases everything about hops: the aroma, the flavor, the bitterness. Ultimately, this is a dry beer, and it makes me want to eat something. A great pub beer. I'm so in love with this brewery."
"It was drinkable."
"Drinakbility - 3.5"
"A wonderful mouthfeel on this one, but the hops are very bitey and strong to enjoy a lot of, for me at least. Too hoppy to be really drinkable for me."
"The drinkability is good. One to try when you want a good sessionable IPA. Prosit MK"
"This pours a little bit lighter color than most IPAs I've had. More of a deep golden with a touch of orange. Big fluffy white head that takes forever to settle and some little chunks of crap floating around. As the head settles it leaves a big chunky ring of lacing. The smell is primarily piny. Quite sharp and dry. The flavor is really bold. The pine taste hits the back of your tongue with a huge bang of bitterness. Typical ABV for an American IPA, this is very drinkable and very dry. Well done Smuttynose."
"D: I would not hesitate to have 3 or 4 of these in an evening/event."
"This beer was pleasant, but not very bold (and a bit pedestrian) compared to others in the American-style IPA category."
"M/D-Moderate carbonation....sessionable and affordable."
"Drinkability: See above. I think most hopheads will like this. And drink a lot of it."
"Cloudy golden with lots of yeast sediment floating around. The head retension is awesome. Thick blankets of lace all the way down.Lots of pine and grapefruit scents. Floral.Lots of hops are evident in the flavor. Bitterness is big with flavors of grapefruit citrus and some grassiness. Not super drinkable due to the heavy bitterness, but certainly a solid ipa."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a huge longlasting tan fomay head. A very impressive beer. The smell is a very citrus hop aroma, tangerune and a mild grapefruit? The taste is a juicy grapefruit hop explosion. Crisp and clear with no aftertaste,this has a medium m/f with all flavors mixing well. This may be the best IPA in New England. Cheers."
"D: As good as this is, I don't know that I'd have a second. Though I could drink this again and again (it's a fine IPA), it's richness and overall citrus bitterness make it the type of IPA I'd be OK having just one of. However, it's highly recommended and one I'm very glad to have tried..."
"Be warned, this one is not for the faint of heart. Don't give this to your more timid friends."
"I had this beer a few times. The last time i tried this beer i poured it into the glass it had some serious chill haze, which is ok. But the glass had a lot of debris in it which is unapealing. It had a really hoppy realy citrusy (GRAPEFRUIT) taste. Good thick head and really good IPA."
"This is, to date, the ultimate expression of a Chinook-hopped IPA on my list. And, as my favourite hop is Chinook, I guess that makes it my favourite IPA, period."
"One of my all-time favorites for its sheer reliability, versatility and drinkability. The best everyday brew from one of the best American brewers."
"I am looking forward to train more Smuttynose beers. Next!"
"D- Pretty good, this could be a regular IPA for me. It will have to compete for fridge space with Celebration and Two-hearted though."
"For me, so far, this is just about the perfect expression of American IPA. The hops are bold, aromatic, complex, citrus, fantastic; but this brew is balanced by soft yet crisp malt that serves as the perfect counterpoint and vehicle for the full hop flavor. The finish is long with pleasing bitterness but there is no puckering quality or astringency, this is masterfully crafted and balanced IPA: bold yet restrained, shows finesse. Hard to stop drinking this brew."
"Murky yellow body with chunks of yeast in it (completely unintentionally), with a quarter of an inch of head. Smells very very hoppy, both piney and citrusy. Citrusy hops and bitter hops dominate the flavor, though I think they may be subdued somewhat by the yeast. Medium to full in body. Very tasty and enjoyable. Surprisingly drinkable."
"I am an IPA type of guy, and this one has to contend with the top of my list of them. This beer was recomended by a fellow BA, and I am glad I listened. Though I will always have a special spot in my heart for Two Hearted Ale, Smuttynose IPA gives it a run for its money."
"Pours a wonderfull peach colored ale with a thick head that quickly disapears to a tight laced lightly carbonated ale. Scent of hopps, cascades and citrus are very present. A nice floral bouquet is also in the nose. This is a superior IPA and one that is frequent in my fridge and bar. The smoothness and crisp aftertaste is bar none and one to be wrecond with.Great job guys keep it up!"
"It may be the finest IPA ever."
"Hazy, orange color, with a big frothy white head that laces nicely. Pleasant fresh aroma. Taste is outstanding; hoppy without being overpowering, with a nice piney character. Highly drinkable IPA; great hop character without the overwhelming ""superhop"" flavor of the west coast IPA's."
"D: Overall, it was a decent enough IPA, with nice matching flavors, but not overly impressive. I would order another, but might make other initial selections if I'm in the mood for an IPA."
"A good beer. I was expecting more given its reputation. Maybe it was an old bottle. I will try again."
"This was a very decent IPA. Nothing too clobbering on the tongue. Didn't seem to have too many ingredients to make it very complex, though."
"Thanks to wcudwight for the bottle."
"Didn't care for the beer at all though. I was so excited to get it, but I couldn't even finish one. I enjoy the DFH 60 and 90 min (and thought I would like this one as it is ranked even higher) but it was too bitter. Not enough flavor either.. I couldn't detect and herbs or spices. The carbonation was good, but that was about it. I'd recommend DFH over this any day."
"Bottle courtesy of Mr_Kimchee: Poured a hazy light amber color ale with a medium slightly off-white foamy head. Aroma of citrus hops is well balance with caramel malt. Taste of caramel malt is well mixed with some citrus hops. Body is above average and low filtration level makes this even more enjoyable. Another solid beer in this fine brewery line-up."
"D: Pretty darn good IPA, would for sure have this one again."
"Refreshingly drinkable IPA. Sessionable, and a good example of the style. Wouldnt recommend to someone who hasnt yet acquired a taste for hoppy beers. Ill be looking for this one again. Yum yum."
"Drinkable but not as expected."
"In any case, this is one of the richest, boldest IPAs I've ever tasted. Please do Smuttynose a favor and show some appreciation by checking this one out. THIS...is how it's done. Happy drinking! Especially if you're drinking this one!"
"Thanks to swedejay53 for this fine example of an IPA."
"Because of the strong hops, I might have to alternate between this and another beer throughout the night, but this one is a winner. Smutty knows how to do it right, kids. Solid IPA, and reasonably priced, to boot."
"I cant get past the metallic astrincgency present in this one. That taste is very chalky and not pleasant. Otherwise, a nice beer."
"12oz bottle purchased from Wine Emporium in Boston. Very slight indentations on the Best Before markings imply it to be December 06. Pours a light golden with not much head but quite a bit of carbonation. Small amounts of lacing. Medium hoppy aroma. First taste is full, but not overly complex. Heavy hoppy aftertaste, which is nice, but not as round and fruity and fresh as I prefer. Was hoping for a little bit more from this given the repeated suggestions from salespeople in the shops."
"Drinkable? Hell yeah. Maybe not for a hophead, but what am I? Hophead for life."
"This IPA and the IPA from Franconia Notch to me are very similar. I love them both. Live free or die! Well done NH."
"Poured a nice copper color with a white head and good lacing. Smells strongly of floral/citrsuy hops. Tastes similar to how it smells, very hoppy and citrusy. Mouthfeel is good. Nice body with a moderate amount of carbonation. As for drinkability this is a great, flavorful IPA. Very drinkable. Thank you Smuttynose."
"Overall: My previous Review of this beer was of a bottle that had been kindly gifted by Carmen but had to be left in my Car during a particular hot-day whilst down in San Diego attending the Real Ale Festival at Pizza Port back in 2004. I was not sure if that sample had suffered or not, it certainly did not seem like it, but it was hard to tell  yet on reflection perhaps judging by this fresher sample it wasnt at its best, still great though. So I kept my promise to Re-Review and upped the overall marks accordingly (4 to 4.35). Good stuff, and definitely one of my favorite American IPAs from the East Coast. Thanks to Erica for the fresh sample!"
"Thanks to cooperrip for a chance to try this one."
"Overall, it's a very, very nice take on the style. It delivers the malt, hops and bitterness while remaining very drinkable. I could go for a few of these.... but watch out, the 6.6% will hit you!"
"Oh, Smuttynose. Pours a beautiful cloudy golden orange with sediment unfiltered floaties the way I like it. Nice white creamy head that leaves behind gorgeous lacing, like an artform, along the glass as it is poured down the gullet. Smells of citrusy grapefruit and hops hops hops. Tastes of extreme grapefruity hops all the way, citrusy, grassy, and pungent. Pucker up! Finish is semi-dry. The grapefruit character takes on a kung-fu grip on the palate and hangs on for dear life until the next explosive sip is taken. Mouthfeel is like liquid velvet and rolls around in the mouth. Perfect carbonation balance tingling on the tongue and never invasive. I could drink these all day long, tolerance permitted. One of the best straight-up IPA's on the market today. This brew very much lives up to the handle of ""Finest Kind."" Bravo."
"Pours a bright, active yellow amber with a thick, substantial head that leaves lots of lacing. Big hop (pine pitch) aroma on the nose, with yeast as its only counterpoint. This is one helluva bitter beer on the palate -- way out of balance, but not unpleasantly so. Citrus flavors come in first, followed by grapefruit, with a finish that displays just a touch of crackery malts -- the only note in this brew that sounds of malt. Mouthfeel is quite astringent, nearly puckering, with an active, buzzy finish. If you like IPAs, this one will probably be drinkable for you; if you aren't as enthusiastic (like me) it might be hard to put away a bunch of these."
"Single bottle purchased at Woodman's in Madison and smuggled back to NC. Notched as best by August '06."
"A solid IPA. Golden color, nice medium head. Floral aroma, a little citrus in there also. Tasted initially sweet, then the nice hop sharpness kicked in. Pretty assertive beer. A beer to drink a few of, as long as you're sticking to IPAs. I liked this almost as much as Smutty's Big A IPA."
"Great example of my favorite style. Not on the level of The Mama or Two-Hearted, but a very solid brew all-around."
"Bottom line: A very good example of an American IPA. Thanks go out to jwc215 for including this one in our trade!"
"D - overall a good beer. I would drink it regularly if I could get it regularly."
"Orangey yellow one finger bubbly head. This is unfiltered? there is yeast floating around. I missed the warning, though it seems like it wasn't settled anyhow and would be in the mid even with a good pour. That makes it a bit unattractive in appearance though otherwise it was pleasing. Aroma is citrus rinds and flowers. Not over the top but getting there, good resinous aroma, but all hops. Taste is intense bittering hops. It's definite a hop kick from the start in that plain old bitter sense. Tastes like a few and not just one hop variety but not a million either. Surprisingly, a malty flavor peaks in at the end, of all things. Very grapefruity in flavor. A hop-heads delight. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with full on carbonation; leaves a zippy lively feel on the tounge. For all of that, I admit this was nothing special. I'm finding I like the multi-hop kind of flavor over the single hop kind of thing, but also with this beer I realize the distinction in ""where do you put the hops?"" so to speak. Abundant bittering hops, vs abundant flavoring hops, vs abundant aroma hops, and all of the above. This one focused on bittering to my palate, so while the hop choices weren't overwhelming, the puckering bitterness made this not enjoyable. I learned something here. Smutty shows their ability to craft well here, though it's not to my palate. A fine beer for the hop lover, but not the IPA I'd return to."
"A bright beer with a light body and a fruity nose. It started out thin, but grew into an astringent, bitter, hoppy aftertaste. I wouldn't say it stood out in the world of craft IPA's but it knocked commercial brands (like Keith's) and I'd happily buy it again."
"Despite the astringent qualities--or perhaps because of them for a h.h. like me--this is an eminently drinkable brew. To my mind, it is complex, well-balanced and potent enough to make it an American heavyweight. Right up there with Two Hearted and Hop Devil as the the most drinkable and sessionable American I.P.A.s"
"Did I mention that I love this beer? Oh yeh. Thank the beer gods for Smuttynose!"
"After trying their Big A i was looking for something with a little less bang, and the Smuttynose IPA is absolutly perfect. Was a little worried about the mouthfeel being that it was unfilitered but did not taste it at all. Beautiful fruitful aroma with a lovely color. Definitely a great drinker."
"D - difficult to to drink, but not entirely off putting, this qualifies as a finisher."
"""Finest Kind"" as it's formally known, has only been around for only a couple years. I love the label with the 2 fellas on the lawnchairs, enjoying some beer. The guy on the right kind of looks like Drew Carey (If you can make that out). It has a cloudy peach-orange color with a brilliant head that leaves lace rings on the pint glass as I enjoy the nectar. The aroma has a great citrus hop nose: grapefruit and lemon, yum. The taste is much of the same with a caramel malt hint that doesn't balance the bitter hop attack, but I don't think it was meant to. The creamy texture is something that I've found some of my favorite IPAs make complete. This is no exception. Probably the best IPA, I've had from New England. Delicious."
"Not worth the effort to get."
"Murky orange color with some kind of chunks in it. Yeast or hops? Looks kind of nasty but I kind of like it. Aroma is interesting. A touch sweet but hops. Like sweet pine smell and then grapefruit. Complex, really, but I can't pin it down. Taste is hopped the crap out. But there's not the intensity I was expecting, making this quite drinkable but not quite the palate destroying experience I thought it might be. Good and bad. Lower carbonation and smooth really with a fruitiness that seems to dominate. Drier on the palate than nostrils however. Balanced but hoppy. Finish has more bitterness and alcohol replaces the fruity malts. I drank this one fairly easily and quickly, but its not my favorite."
"12oz. bottle. Crystal clear gold with orange tones. Large, rocky off-white head. Aroma was grapefruit hops, very little malt, what was there came through as honey. Flavor was reflective of aroma, with hops as grapefruit, a nice balance of malt (honey was very faint), and almost no aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light, with medium to high carbonation, and moderate drying. A very nice beer, the younger brother to Big-A IPA. I prefer the Big-A version, but this is incredibly drinkable."
"It's great to see the east coast really step it up with this one; too many east coast IPA's have a huge malt body, which slows me way down. It's got plenty of punch and it's nice and light for easy sessioning. A++"
"This is an IPA I could drink after mowing the lawn without a problem and yet it is still a nicely flavored and enjoyable brew."
"Starts off very bitter, with a touch of orange. By midsip the bitterness has quelled a little, to allow some mild malt presence to arise, but the bitterness rears its ugly head at the end.	 I've gotta say that I'm not overly impressed with this one. It could by my illness, but there are much better IPA's out there."
"D: It’s tasty, not-too-filing, and it’s the kind if beer that you can just keep on drinking. Smuttynose Brewing Co. continues to impress me. I think this is an excellent beer and a great representation of the style."
"A really good IPA, close to Celebration Ale and as good as Hop 'Otten. Pours a cloudy light orange/dull gold color with a medium size white head. The head fades quickly to 1/4 inch but then hangs in there throughout. Good heavy lacing. Fairly good hops aroma. Taste is great. Bitter hops with some grapefruit. The flavors are nicely balanced and the grapefruit is not overpowering. The taste/mouthfeel are rich and smooth (for a hop head). THe ABV is a bit high for a session beer, but if I was going to be sitting on my butt with friends for a long while I would consider slowly putting down 3 of these beauties. An outstanding beer, looks like it is available all year long. A greeat find for a guy down to his last 3 2006 Celebration Ales."
"Pours lighter than I expected, more of a dark gold than an amber/orange. Good head and lace. Aroma is all hops, specifically very grapefruity. The flavor is very much along the same lines. I wouldn't be too surprised if someone told me grapefruit juice actually went into this beer. Bitter, citrus hop notes dominate throughout. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is high. Worth coming back to again and again."
"Drinkability: Pretty potent and invigoratingly hoppy, a good beer to have towards the end of a session."
"Cheers!"
"Like everything else Smuttynose makes...quality stuff."
"Pale, sunny, orange color with light cloudiness and few chunks of sediment. The head is creamy and light with amazing retention. Loads of streaming carbonation visible. The aroma is tangy with strong piney and floral hop presence. Very grapefruit like in character, and also very ""fresh"" to the nose. The taste is also dominated by grapefruit hops, the malt flavor is a bit subdued but has a nice toastiness that holds up well to balance it out. Bitterness is solid and makes it very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is fairly light in thickness and the carbonation is not overpowering. This brew has excellent drinkability due to its nice balance and crisp hoppiness. Nothing over-complex, but made just right... Thanks to ghostwalker for this brew..."
"Smuttynose takes a beer that feel has been far overdone and does it right. Pours dark with a bite of hops that does not quit from beginning to end. One of the few examples of this beer that I would rate superior. Chewy is the only way I can explain it. Not overly hopped, but with a hop character that stays with you well after your last sip. Reminds me of the Pale Ale that the High Point BC makes. The real McCoy."
"This is probably the most aggresively hopped beer I have had, hands down. Awesome beer, but not for the timid! Bottoms up!!!"
"Drinkability: The beer is limited a bit by the hops, they could easily overpower the tastebuds. Despite that, the ale is solid."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a fingers worth of off-white head. Leaves thin, streaky lacing. Aroma is of spicy citrus with some pine fighting for attention. The taste is of grapefruit and lemon peel. Medium body with active carbonation. A nice IPA but not my favorite IPA or Smuttynose brew."
"nicely bitter but balanced. malty sweet presence comes on surprisingly strong and overwhelms some of the hop complexity. hops come off with some citrus rinds but overall is rather one-noted. still, a very drinkable, flavorful ipa."
"a not uncommon feature in my fridge."
"Good stuff. Have always liked the bottle version, but this was like Jimmy Walker, dy-no-mite."
"Overall one of my favorites from the Smuttynose line up. The price is great and the quality is amazing."
"Quite easy to drink."
"Pours orange-peach in color with a cream head that slowly recedes to a faint ring, slight haziness. Aroma is predominantly grassy hops, but also a fainter sweet citrus hop aroma. Taste shows some lemony flavors up front with a grassy bitterness in the finish. Bitterness is fairly big and is quite drying. Very enjoyable. Although I am not as impressed with the smell on this one as I usually am with my favorite ipas, the taste and drying bitterness make it highly enjoyable and very drinkable for me."
"Pours an appealing medium amber color with about an inch of head . I smelled the hops immediatly . grapefruity and just a hint of malt . The hop flavor is out front , but it does""nt beat you up with every sip . very low key bitterness . I liked this beer . Its a tasty , drinkable I P A balanced more to the hoppy side of the tracks ."
"A real winner from Smuttynose! Very drinkable!"
"Mouthfeel is pretty standard for an IPA. Very crisp and refreshing. It leaves a solid hop after taste. I really want to get more of these. This is a very good beer."
"This beer came right off the tap from the Moan and Dove in Massachusetts. I have heard good things about it so I had high expectations. I have to say I was very disappointed by this brew. It was a golden/orange color with a slight white head. It had a very earthy/bitter aroma and an overly hoppy/bitter taste. No malt character, It was like grass in a blender if that makes sense. The aftertaste was much the same, and left more to be desired. Its light body and carbonation allow it to go down very easy but this taste was too off for my palate, I would stay away from this one."
"D- This beer has a nice big bitterness to the hops which balanced the flavor of the hops nicely. Many IPAs have just the flavor and aroma of hops and it is nice to see the bitterness in there also."
"D: Very good."
"This is a straight forward, well crafted beer...something that any brewer would be proud of. Lacks a little bit of depth that I would prefer. I could certainly drink another one of these right now. The still going grapefruit aftertaste doesn't let you forget this beer easilly."
"An almost perfect example, in my mind, of the IPA style."
"I feel that this ber has potential, but lacks a bit of finess. There is simply too much bittering hops, and not enough flavor hops. In addition, I feel that the hops themselves do not blend well. The different varietals seem to clash in this beer. It's quite drinkable and refreshing, just not one of the better IPA's that I've had."
"Thanks again Px2!"
"Smutty IPA is the quintessential American IPA. It has a strong hop bitterness that hits the front, middle, and back of the toungue equally. While it is not for the faint-of-heart, it is slightly balanced by a clean sweetness. Overall, it is a great pleasure to drink, and should be sought out on tap, as opposed to the bottle."
"this is a damn fine brew, does the ipa style right to the point of benchmark status, and representative of a heady brewery."
"Not my favourite, despite the high rating it has here but, again, my second sample may be 'tainted' so I should review this again the next time I come across it."
"Pours an orange/amber with yeasty haze and a few fingers of khaki head leaving a nice coating of soapy lace. Nose is dominated by intense bitter hops with a hint of caramel/apricot fruitiness. Taste is genuinely bitter, not just piney or herbal, with a sweet malty and fruity backbone that brings some balance. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. A nice, assertive American IPA, wish I had more than a bottle"
"Footnote: Drinking with a side of mild cheddar helps cut the bitterness a bit."
"Maybe I should have aged this or maybe they should re-label it as some sort of IPA-pilsener hybrid because that's what it tasted like. A good beer that I'd love to drink again, but considering the style, not quite right."
"Well, obviously the taste is very hoppy... if it's an IPA and it's getting a good review, it sure better be hoppy. A bit of a pine flavor, and definitely a refreshingly acidic, VERY prominent yellow grapefruit kind of a flavor (you know what I mean right? not the red or purple grapefruits, the other ones). As bitter as it should be, but still pretty crisp. This is really really drinkable/sessionable... I'm not the biggest guy in the world, so I usually only have one or two beers at a time, but I could see myself downing three or four of these guys fairly easily."
"Let's put it this way. I'd like to have another. Good beer."
"If you are into hoppy beers, definately give this one a try."
"Very drinkable. Hops upon hops, but clean, and lovely. I paired this with my Easter meal, and it was fantastic. I think this just took the spot for my favorite IPA."
"Oh this is good, makes up for the unusual winter ale. Pours hazy orange, slight head to it. Smells quite citrusy. Taste? Wow!! Hops galore, bitter but citrusy at the same time and oh sooo good. Extremly drinkable. Best part is you can taste the hops again when your burp. That is what beer is supposed to be about!!"
"12 ounce bottle with born on month on side served into a pint glass. Color deep amber with a healthy head. Great tasting with an explosion of hops that is not overwhelming but just right. Awesome lacing down the sides of the glass. A very easy drinking IPA with the alcohol not killing the taste. It is going to be hard not to pound back a lot of these bad boys. Another great beer from the folks at Smutty!"
"This one has such strong character, very bold, and while I'm tempted to drink it daily, it's uniqueness in a sea of hundreds of other IPAs makes me want to savor it and only bust it out rarely, so that it always remains something special."
"A great easy drinking IPA, with a great big hops bite. Enjoyed from a bottle into a small 6ish ounce glass at The Brickskeller in Washington DC. Great label with a couple old guys hanging out in front of an RV. Smell and taste are loaded with fruity and pungent hops, very citrusy. Taste was a little raw and unexpected, but still very enjoyable and different. Good for a hops fixed that hasn't been filled enough lately, this should sate about anyones cravings."
"Smutty IPA is all an IPA should be and more... A big fat frothy-chunky head that lasts and lasts with massive lacing. Beautiful and massive nose of fresh apricot and pine as well as generous carbonation; something that is missing from many fine IPA's. The taste is full bodied with big-time hopping, moderately to generously bitter with a very dry finish. Interestingly, you are led to believe you are about to taste a sweet beer based on the fruity nose; this is not so whatsoever as this brew throws a curveball at your sensory system! Always one of my favorites any time & any place. On a point, a phone call to Smuttynose today reveals that they will be changing their labeling on all their products shortly to indicate a ""Best by"" consumtion date rather than notching the month of bottling date out...Hummm.... I think I prefer the old system, as I would rather judge ""should I or shouldn't I""... She suggested the drink by date will be 6 months beyond the bottling date..Being this IPA is unfiltered; it should be fine based on proper storage.."
"I must implore you not to drink this beer too cold -- it is quite harsh before it warms up, and it really comes together if you wait for it. I remember drinking this beer a few summers ago right from the fridge right from the bottle and finding it undrinkably lemony-bitter. That was then and this is now. Now I find it a bold and tasty IPA, sessionable, but its dryness overwhelms after a few, and the alcohol is definitely apparent, and I don't mean in the flavor. I'm liking Smuttynose more and more!"
"Exceptionally drinkable and I will have a hard time sharing this Feb. '06 sixer with all by my best brewbuddies. I am thinking a private 1 man session as I write this review."
"That's how I'll put it. Give it a try if you're fortunate enough to be within Smuttynose's distributional reach."
"Overall: I found this to be a very good IPA, but a bit more bitter than I was anticipating for a single IPA. I think I would like it more paired with the right food, i.e. something spicy perhaps? to balance the flavor a bit. I would definitely recommend to those who enjoy IPA's."
"drinkability: solid"
"On tap-Poured out a dark yellow or amber with a small quickly dissappearing head.The aromas of this IPA are of pine,citrus and of course hops.The flavor is also mega hopped influenced as well as some citrus,perhaps even lemon.This is not my favorite style,so it is hard to be fair,buts I guess it is ok."
"Very nice beer here, one I would love to have available on a regular basis. Now I want to try the rest of Smuttynose's line, to see how they compare."
"I will try this again in the near future and maybe I'll adjust this rating."
"The appearance had a slight haziness to it, but thats expected since its bottle conditioned. The smell was almost like a grapefruit candy. I could smell the hop spicyness with a lot of citrus notes. The taste didnt quite taste like the smell indicated. There was some citrus notes in it, but also had a slight grassy taste to it. I was hoping for a stronger taste to it, but didnt quite get it. Still not bad though. I would definetly try again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style. Good drinkability. Not as sweet as many other IPAs so this one goes down a bit slower. A good drinker. Another good east coast IPA that has many similar flavor characteristics to Hop Wallop and Nugget Nectar."
"Pours a light colored amber with a nice full bright white headskie. Hops are right on the nose, some citrus in there. Great hop load for an east coast IPA. I'm licking my lips. Malts are mellow, but balanced with a bit of a bite of their own. Goes down smooth and easy, worth drinking."
"poured a slightly cloudy, medium peach color with moderate white puffy head. Some particulate matter in the glass. Head left nice lacing as it falls to a thin coating. Smell is loaded with hops, with the feeling of being in a pine forest with freshly cut grass at my feet smelling a freshly cut lemon. Tastes gives a strong bitterness that is very pleasurable on the tongue. Finish is more dryness that begs for another taste. Very enjoyable beer."
"Notes: My second product from Smuttynose, and I am once again pleased. A great brewery, a great beer, certainly is of the ""finest kind."""
"Taste; lots of pine and citric grapefruit hops hit you and first but are somewhat beat back by a nice malt presence. Not a big hop monster of an IPA due to the malts, which is kind of nice for a change. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly oily, with just enough carbonation for me. This is a very good IPA, that I hope to be able to get more of someday."
"D: I hate to do it, but as good as this beer is, I can't give it too high scores for drinkability, the flavor just lingers too long. Though I would have one of these a night, I would not be able to drink more than one in a night. Oh well, nothings perfect."
"Drinkability: My taste buds are begging for mercy. The hops totally did a number on my palate. A fine, hoppy flavor, but bitterness exceeding my preference. Light and not filling, and probably worth having another."
"Extremely drinkable. Easy drinker that isnt TOO much of a slap to the palate... wish it was a bit more complex... but oh well."
"Plenty damn drinkable. This IPA gets ample love in the BA community, I see why. In some ways this is as good as any IPA I have had and yet in certain aspects it falters a bit but the positives do way out weigh the negatives. In the end, my tastebuds are the winner. I a very happy I finally got to try this IPA. I really liked it and I hope to get more. Go Huskers! Thank you michiganmiked!"
"Bottle shared by higravity as part of SS'05. Thanks for the opportunity. Been a while since I tried this one, let's see how my taste preferences have changed. Pours a one-finger light dirty tan head over a cloudy peach liquid. A couple particulates swirl about. Smells lupulin piney. Potently of oranges and some tangerine. Tastes piney, oranges, and pith. Dry. Hint of lupulin but low on the co-ho grassy. Orange rind soured. Dry hint of cherry sour. Dry rough oil finish. Similar to Hop Wallop, but this has a grassy coho dry edgerather than the aromatic light hop oily charater of HW. Md body that's slightly chewy. Mod/light carbonation and slightly piercing on the tongue. The mouthfeel is like gauze...dry and thick fiberous on the tongue."
"This is an IPA I almost always have in my fridge as it's one of the better IPAs readily available in grocery stores in NYC. The hops can be a bit much after a couple as they really stick with you. But this is a terrific IPA all around."
"This is a drinkable brew from the word go. Dogfish Head 60 minute has a new competitor in my book. I will definitely plan to keep this puppy around."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It seems a superb example of an American IPA with an interesting appearance and highly drinkable for those who can make it past the first onslaught of hops."
"Orangey, light copper color, about a finger of head. Some light lacing. The aroma screams of fresh citrus. Lots of orange and grapefruit. Maybe there's a little honey in there too? There's a very nice bitterness to this one. Very flavorful, but not overpowering. Nicely balanced, the grapefruity hops stand out just slightly. Crisp and dry with some nice carbonation. I just wish this was available to me all the time!"
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a hazy light orange with nice lingering head. Surprisingly the pale ale Smuttynose makes is much darker then this beer. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass all the down. The smell is beautiful floral hop aroma and bitterness. The taste is bitter hoppiness with a nice citrus and floral hop flavor underneath. The malts are mostly hidden, what I would expect for an IPA. Another great beer from Smuttynose."
"My kind of beer."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is good, smooth and refreshing. Lip smacking bitter end, but very well balanced. Definately a drinkable beer and one of my favorites. Perhaps my go to IPA. I love having a bunch of these if in one sitting. The ""finest kind!"""
"D  A decent IPA a little heavier on bittering than all out hop flavor. The dry bitterness aftertaste would make it difficult to put more than 1 or 2 down. Overall an average IPA."
"Bitter and grassy, that is the short review. Well it pours a nice yellowish body with a white head and some lacing. Smells of heavy bitter hops and a grassy lemon with some malt in the back end. Taste is really just bitter hops with some grassy tanic tang. Not enjoyable in the sense I would want to session this beer. No thanks and never again."
"Drinkability -- Average drinkability. I won't seek this one out again."
"This beer forms an small off white head which hangs around for a few minutes before leaving a little lace with a beautiful orange/amber liquid. I also noticed a few floaties but they don't bother me as the incredible hoppy ipa somehows bests the wonderful pine and fruity aroma."
"Pours a golden color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bit of caramel sweetness and some citrus hops in the forground. Nothing too special in my opinion. The flavor was much the same. Something in the flavor just doesn't do it for me. The finish is bitter and the mouthfeel is moderate. Drinkability is good."
"Golden amber with an incredible amount of floating bits of hops, and a small rocky white head. Sticky lacing with lots of rings. Smells overwhelmingly of pine and citrus...and like someone soaked a bud of cannabis in it. There's a noticeable peachy undertone as well. Taste is piney hops, a mandarin orange peel twinge, a sweetness not unlike peach juice, and finishes with a toasty biscuit flavor. Medium body and juicy mouthfeel. This has a certain astringency that keeps the drinkability down a bit, but this is absolutely a fine and solid IPA. Glad it's available in my neck of the woods."
"Drinkability: Very nice balance to this beer. Well hopped but not overdone. That malt gives a good showing and is paired nicely with the hop varieties."
"Overall, one of my favorite IPAs. One of the best from the east coast."
"Edit: I don't want to do a full re-review, but I am finding the flavor a bit better than I did before. Bumping from 3.5-4.0"
"Pours a bright copper color with a thin head. Smells a fantastic hoppy pineapple and pine. Tastes about the same. Big hopps with a sour fruitiness. Unfortunately, the flavor is a bit subdued dull; and not as bright as it could be, but well done not the less. Smooth in body with a slight carbonation. I could definitely knock back a few of these. At 6.6, what we have here is a fine session beer."
"This brew was a nice orangish color that left nice spidery lacing with OK head retention. Nose was of piney simcoe hops with a a hint of grapefruit. Taste was a blast of the simcoe hops with a nice integration of malt sweetness to balance it out. Mouthfeel was creamy and full bodied with a a nice amount of carbonation at the end. Overall drinkability was very good. I thought it rated up there with the best western IPA's that I have enjoyed in the past!"
"Pours a cloudy orange, with a creamy three finger head. Good retention leaves patchy lacing. Herbal and citrus american hop aromas, and some extra light malt in the background. Sweet citrus and pale malt flavors upfront, then fresh whole hops and yeast notes dominate. Hop bitterness becomes grassy in the aftertaste, finishes dry and pleasently abrasive. Tiny, slow carbonation keeps the mouthfeel smooth and the drinkability high. Well hopped, but balanced and palatable, this is an excellent example of a true american IPA."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head over the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Head fades slowly, with full coating of lacing. Aroma is a juicy tangerine hops combined with malty sweetness. Taste starts with the malts and fruitiness, but takes on a stronger, more out-of-control bitterness near the end, which continues through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, once the mouth gets used to the bitterness, like most IPAs, and drinkability is good as well. A nice brew, but I had hoped for a bit better here. Maybe I ask too much."
"Pours a very hazy peach color, fluffy sudsy head that retains well. Bitter tangerine aroma with some herbal tomato-vine hop notes. This is herbacious, whoa! Thin and citric sweet, carbonation is gentle. Lacks a real wallop of hop bitterness and has an herbal, soapy thing goin on in its place. Not a lot of malt to balance either. I'm a little let down by this one, as it lacks the balance and flavor that I've come to expect from this brewery."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite IPAs. It's relatively cheap for how well it's made, and it's insanely drinkable. At around 6.6% ABV too, it's not crazy to think of it as a session beer. Certainly try it if you haven't already, especially if you're an IPA fan."
"This is a quality beer. Much consumed in the FirstMan household."
"Pours a slightly cloudy blonde hue with a creamy stark white head. Yeast from this bottle-conditioned ale is suspended throughout. Nose is full of spicy hops, ale yeast, and a touch of mellow malt. Palate is again full of assertive hops, very floral and fresh, well-balanced by light malt. Body is rich and creamy, yet not syrupy like some stronger IPAs tend to get. God, I wish I had bought more than one bottle on my trip up north."
"Notes: I did enjoy this beer but I was expecting a little more since I loved the Big A IPA from smuttynose. Oh well, no shame in being my second favorite IPA from such a great brewer.A great IPA overall."
"*Its worth it to purchase a bottle just for the picture of the two awesome old dudes on the front, I hope to live to that age so i can be that awesomly senile."
"For me the bite is too strong in this one, not as balanced as I would like although a worthwhile stop on the IPA route."
"Pours a straw color with white foam that has a distinct texture and great lacing. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, and sweet tropical fruits. Interesting, but a bit overpowering, as far as I'm concerned. The taste is incredible with a dry, hoppy flavor upfront leading to a blast of bitterness that melts effortlessly into a sweet citrus flavor. The aftertaste is typical for this style, but not too powerful. I very enjoyable beer that can be had numerous times."
"I can find myself deffinately drinking these all night long. They sneak up on u quick, watch out!"
"This was a pleasant surprise -- on tap at Toad in Cambridge. I had no idea they were making such a flavorful, west-coast style IPA up there in New Hampshire. Very strong citrusy hop flavor and aroma, but with enough malt backbone to support it. Tasted exceptionally fresh."
"This is one of those easy quaffing beers that you wish came in a 22oz bottle, 12oz just does not seem like enough. There is nothing out of this world about this beer, but it seems like a solid go to beer that I would happy to drink a lot of if I did not live in AZ."
"Definately an IPA for hop-lovers. Nearly perfect...""finest kind"" indeed."
"Craving some hops, been on more of a malty beer kick lately. Poured a hazy gold in color with a spongey head. Stringy lace that slides back into the glass. Aroma is floral bouquet of hoppiness. Which is immediately confirmed with the first sip. This beer is hops; small explosions of oily bitterness all over the tongue. But then those hop bites recede into a slightly sweet malty finish. Oiliness kind of sticks around a bit. Felt like I was squeezing lemon rinds right onto mouth tongue. Served quite cold and was very crisp and refreshing, Way too easy to drink."
"Nice IPA. Well rounded + good grapefruit hops a lot."
"All in all, a fantastic beer. Really quite excellent. One of the only IPAs that I'd consider buying a whole case of (because I brew so much IPA myself). Another winner from Smutty's ""little"" beers, and worlds better than the Big A. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a bit of a thick body. A small and pleasant lingering bitterness tempts the drinker for another sip. Too bad my bottle is almost empty. I would love to have this beer available in my neck of the woods. Quite possibly the best and most balanced IPA I've had to date, though I sure would love to try Stone's again."
"Grapefruity, with a hint of rind-like bitter. There's a pretty flowery aroma. On each taste, the grapefruit sour is backed by a light malty sweetness before the hoppy bitterness kicks in. This is definitely a beer that smacks the palate around a bit. A beer that wants to be boss, but doesn't run the show as much as a true winning IPA in my book."
"Drinkability and Notes  What an IPA should be, but what few IPAs are, drinkable, really hoppy and refreshing. As good with food as it is by itself, a true New England classic. Something I always come back too, and what I measure all other IPAs against."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. This beer is almost peach in color with a nice head, and good lacing. Alot of sediment. The smell is grapefruit and fine but not overwhelming. Taste is awesome. Buttered bread malts and grapefruit. Lots and lots of grapefruit and not very much pine in this one. This is a more fruity/buttery version of the style than most. That I believe is a good thing. Definitely tasty as hell. Hops are awesome, not too strong, but leave you wanting more. Drinkability is off the charts; alcohol taste is nowhere to be found. My new favorite IPA."
"Brown and orange in color, with a tall frothy white head. The smell is of grapefruit and is supper hopy. The flavor is of grapefruit, pine and a bit grassy. The finish is a wonderful hop bitterness. Its mildly carbonated and is a bit oily, though not thick by any means. This one goes down quick and easy, and leaves you wanting more."
"I have to admit that this is probably my favorite IPA. Served from a 12 oz bottle, it pours a slightly hazy light amber. The initial aroma is of grapefruit rind, hops fill the nose. Wow, the initial taste is of citrus fruit rind and pine, that finishes with a very nice hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth, not too thin or thick, carbonation is fairly light. This is one drinkable IPA. Very smooth beginning that finishes with a great hop bitterness that leaves me wanting more. Its hard for me to just sip this beer its so good. Definitely a beer to seek and enjoy if you haven't had the chance. A beer that is always in my beer fridge."
"I first tried this brew when it was introduced and fell immediately in love. This is a great example of the category. Fresh, clean with plenty of hops and malty undertones to carry you through. Light enough for summery drinking, but put together for year round enjoyment. It pours golden, with a decent head. Smells of fresh hops and flowers. The finish goes on and on with this serious beer with a rich, easy malt finish. Enjoy!"
"Solid stuff."
"Biker PA"
"Taste is, as you would expect, hoppy. Sweet but tangy, a bit bitter near the end of the sip, a good bite. Alcohol is very well hidden here. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation, maybe slightly watery, but overall nice. This beer is quite drinkable- tasty, not too overpowering, and sneakily six and a half percent."
"Drinkability - Definitely an exceptional IPA. It's going down easy on this 90 degree+ day in upstate NY."
"But we are not joking about it anymore. It pours a good head, has good lacing and an excellent hop aroma. It has everything that us West Coast hopheads enjoy in a beer. In even smelling the empty bottle, we longed for more of the fine citrus flavor from the blend of hops and malt. The aroma and taste were great. This beer had everything."
"Taste is bitingly bitter/lightly sweet citrus hops. Hops explode on the tongue. Some crisp pale malt. Orange rind and grapefruit. Mouth is crisp with a long lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Orange rind is prevalent. Well-crafted, it all works nicely together. i could drink these all night long. A very good IPA. If avaialable here in ATL it would be in my regular rotation..."
"Goes down smooth. Wonderful, wonderful beer right here."
"In the winter I may buy a six pack in six months. In the summer? Where's the IV..."
"a nice beer, too bad this is my last one and i waited too long to review it. an east coast IPA with some definite west coast ambition. wish we could get it out here. i would likely rate this even higher if i had a fresher bottle."
"Slight haze, orange gold colour with an off-white head. Dense foam shows good lacing and retention. Clean citrusy hop aroma, orange and grapefruit, slightly floral, but definitely intense. Light malty character appears as it warms up a bit. Bready malt flavour is in there providing some balance, but this one's all about hops. Bitterness is quite assertive and lingers in the resinous finish. Citrus hoppiness throughout, and there's a bit of alcohol towards the end. Very creamy texture with low carbonation and medium body. Really smooth and drinkable. Quite an excellent IPA and one that I'll look for again."
"I was told that this was better than the big A IPA which I really liked. It poured with a yellow orange cloudy haze with pleasant grapefruit hoppy scents. I can see why people like this IPA. It has a great body and bitterness much like the british bitters which is so often missing in the style. Long dry finish with a silkiness unlike so many IPAs. It is worth a try but not excellent."
"Overall: This is an excellent IPA, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it."
"I liked Smuttynose's Old Brown Dog Ale so much that I decided to try their IPA. Good carbonation, light copper color, head lingered. It was a little too bitter for my liking--primarily grapefruit! Although it would be a refreshing summer beer, it didn't seem to mix too well with food. Not the best nor worst IPA I've tasted. Don't think I'll buy another bottle."
"Overall, I just didn't quaff this one the way I do other IPAs. I'll try it again in a few weeks. I still think it's a pretty good beer."
"Very drinkable. Goes well on the boat, on the porch, and with food. A great drinkin summer brew."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange. Dont worry. The sediment at the bottom IMO make the beer look chunky and strange, but taste just great. Nice white head, that lasts and lasts. The smell is in your face pine and grapefruit. The taste is unmistakably grapefruit. This beer has over taken DFH 60 for me in terms of my house stock IPA. Crisp, clean, light body, and most importantly- delicious. The best of the Smuttynose offerings and one of the best IPAs I have ever laid taste buds on. They set the bar high for others that wish to follow"
"All and all a very tasty brew. I'm often looking for beers that are well balanced. While it's quite easy to build a 'hop monster' that could tear the enamel right off your teeth, it takes a real artisan to create a balanced, nuanced brew composed of strong notes. The brewers at Smuttynose have succeeded at finding that harmony."
"hazy amber with a good not quite white head. grapefruit and pine aromas dominates the nose. resinous big grapefruity bitterness, minimally balanced with caramel and a very light bread-like flavor. leaves bitterness in the back of the throat, and has me burping hops (the sign of a truely good IPA). i find a little pear hidden under some of the stornger flavors. crisp and dry with fairly delicate carbonation. I don't find beers to be very thirst quenching, but this one delivers in that department. very good drinkability due to this thirst quenching quality and it being a very good IPA."
"The aroma is noticably grapefruit like and piney. The taste is very dry and citrusy with a over the top hop flavor. This is a good thing. There seems to be a decent amount of carbonation that leaves a fizzy taste. There is a good amount of pine flavor in the aftertaste. This is a very good IPA, one of the best I have had lately."
"Pours a hazy orange-yellow with a finger of off-white head and good retention. Big hops aroma---both citrus and resinous piney scents. A bready malt aroma also lurks in the background. Taste is very bitter upfront, a bit of doughy malt in the middle, and huge resinous hoppy aftertaste. Medium bodied with a slick oily feel of hops. This is an excellent IPA, unbalanced towards the hops, but in this case in an excellently tasty way."
"This is a poundable beer, although I fear the alcohol could wind up giving you a few problems the next morning. I would definitely get this again!"
"Drinkability is damn near off the scale, especially if you're in need of a serious hops fix. Smuttynose's ""Finest Kind"" IPA is one of the best IPA's I've had to date, rivalling many of my West Coast favorites such as Stone and Alesmith. A certain ""must try"" example of an American IPA."
"a fine looking, pale IPA that left some lacing strata in my glass at the brickskeller. i'm nmot sure what C hop it is that is so astoundingly grapefruity, but damn, it's grapefruity. good body with some sweetness to keep the hop flavor in check"
"Drinkability was excellent. This was one truly great IPA. I still like DFH's 90 minute more, but this one makes a great runner-up."
"Heres a favorite IPA. ""Finestkind"" is ready for the big time."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This will satisfy the most discerning hop lover, myself included. The alcohol is not at the levels associated with double-IPAs, but the flavor is. Recommended."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy orange-honey color with a 1/2"" off-white head. The aroma of pine and grapefruit is dominant, signaling the hops to come. The taste starts with a sweet citrus, like pink grapefruit, that hits right away. It finishes with a slightly sour bitterness, much like a grapefruit would. Not a bad start, but as I drink, the overall flavor gets more and more bitter. A decent IPA overall, but nothing special, and the increasing bitterness makes it less drinkable to me than others."
"Well it poured nicely from the tap to leave a 1/2 inch head which stuck around for a bit, and eventualy laced down the glass as I drank it. The Aroma was strong with hops but they smelled like fresh cut lawn as opposed to good, half spicy grass, half citrus. The mouth feel was a nice smooth feeling which exploded with hop bitterness. So much in fact that it completely covered any maltiness. I'm a hop head myself, but this beer was not a balance of easy going malt and hops and a pleasant aroma. It was more of a hop attack on all counts. The aftertaste really intrigued me. I sat there for a while and literally yelled it to a friend two seats over. ITALIAN BREAD!!! It was by far the oddest after-taste Ive ever tasted. (hence the large type) I liked it, but it was not fair (balanced) beer."
"Overall = Intersting flavor. I like it although the bitterness hurts it slightly as it hurts the drinkability. Even though it's a refreshing taste, after drinking a full beer, I am not desiring another one. I think the bitterness overwhelms any other flavor and doesn't really allow this beer to compliment anything else. I still recommend it for IPA fans though."
"Pours with a white, five-finger head, fades soon and leaves a good lace. Light-medium carbonation. Clear amber color. Nose is hoppy, starts hoppy with some sweetness, finishes hoppy with some bitterness. Lingering hoppy aftertaste. $6.29 for a 6-pak from Rite-Aid Pharmacy Concord, NH."
"The beer is aggressively bitter on the palate, balanced with a good dose of caramel and some fruityness. The malt is sufficient to support the bitterness and the finish is dry. A hop 'coating' lingers in the mouth long after swallowing and, quite frankly, I'm not so crazy about that sensation hence my drinkability score."
"By far my favorite beer....period. I crave the hops. They hit you like a ton of bricks when you pop the bottle open. Pours nice amber color with a off-white head, lotsa lacing. Nose is hops, hops, hops. Bring it to your lips and it's again...hops, hops, and more hops. Malt comes in to try to balance it in the middle but the hops bitch-slaps them back into submission. Grapefruity finish that you too will crave. Love this stuff!!!"
"Drinkability is great a very nice IPA. mdavis31481 said it was his regular IPA of choice, I can see why now this beer rocks thanks for the sample."
"I am impressed with this beer - from the whimsical label, to the clean finish of the very last drop."
"Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation with a medium body"
"Drinkability-- One of the best IPA's I've had."
"A hop lover's wet dream, without tasting like your mouth got washed out with soap. A pair of thumbs up to Smuttynose."
"."
"Not a bad beer, but not one for my tastes."
"Thanks to PPoitras for the bottle."
"I have the feeling that if you keep drinking this all night, you'd do a number on your tastebuds. The bitterness is so tenacious that it might get tiring after a while. But this one is overall a great IPA and one that I will have to make a place for in my fridge."
"This is the first time I have had this beer, and I am very impressed. This is the way an IPA should taste. Strong hops, lots of citrus and pine flavors. Pours with a great head that lightly laces the glass. The color is a translucent amber. Has a great mouthfeel, and it quite drinkable. Good thing it is very drinkable, because the hops will destroy your taste for anything else (and your ability to taste it). This is an outstanding beer, and an almost perfect IPA."
"This beer is definitely a departure from other IPA's I've had. Heavy pine and citrus, so much so I really cannot detect anything else. This is defiantly a craft beer and it shows, but this is not my style at all. I am trying to be constructive in this analysis, but quite frankly, this beer is annoying me."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a fair amount of unfiltered heft. Might be an old bottle, would make me feel better without the sea monkeys in it. Thanks to ppoitras for this one."
"Drinkability- One of the best balanced IPA's I have ever had. I would have liked a bit more of a hop punch, but otherwise a pretty top notch IPA. Thanks to BA Spinlock for the bottles of Smutty!"
"This beer blows all other IPAs out of the water. The Amarillo hops are the shit for this beer. Two Hearted can only aspire to be what Finest Kind is."
"Tip: I drank some of this beer at room temp and it was fantastic. Great juicy flavors really came out. It was as good as a Hoptical Illusion I had on cask. The temp really mimicked that cask feel. Anyway, I suggest trying it!"
"This is a tremendous and unique American IPA. Highly recommended, as we all seem to agree."
"Poured a golden amber with a tint of orange, with a 2 finger white foam head atop. The aroma is truly one of the best I've smelled for an IPA, like a grapefruit and pine vortex. Taste, again I'm hit by the grapefruit citric acids from the alphas. This one is balanced, a medium bodied, overall an excellent IPA, that is more in the vein of a west coast style. Defintely in the top tier IPAs I've experienced."
"Really good beer in my opinion. I could drink alot of these but I think the abv would get me. I've had the Robust Porter by Smuttynose and that's what inspired me to pick this up, very glad I did. Gonna check out the rest of thier offerings."
"Highly recommended."
"Ayuh."
"Drinkability: This beer reminds me a lot of Liberty Ale, which is one of my favorites."
"Overall: could this super juicy East Coast IPA be my favorite single IPA? It knocked my socks off! Beermail me if you know what hops they used, please!"
"Smooth as glass with nothing left after but a small enticing sting to remember this by. This is going to be a heartbreaker since I only have 2 left. I hope she heads up that way again becuase I'd love to have more."
"It is the finest kind. I surely enjoyed this brew. Poured hazy and orange with a a nice cm head that stayed around for a bit. Smells of tangy citrus, hops and even cloves- very enticing. This beer tastes like an IPA should with a great bitterness and a bit of a bite, and the citrus flavors complement that well in this concoction. Stays nice on the tounge after a sip, and I could do just that, sip this all day. This is my first brew by smuttynose and I am very pleased, an excellent choice."
"Sharp carbonation. Did I mention how sharp this beer is? Maybe it's *too* fresh. Good stuff, but I might wait a little while before opening the next one."
"Evidently this is a seasonal, got a few in a sampler 12 pack from Smutty. It poured with a hazy golden amber body with a thin white head. The nose is very hoppy with evidence of spruce. The mouthfeel can best be described as full but also adds an overflowing characteristic. I enjoy the fact that the hops don't bully you right away, its more of a slow mount. Overall, its very sprucey with a woody character and clearly has a heavy dosage of hops (cascade?). A few sips in, you find the brew settles bitterly at the back of the throat. The finish is a little more sharp with the bitterness as the spruce is accompanied by just a splash of lemon. It really sticks on the palate and leaves a dry coating. Really, its solidly built."
"A whirling blizzard of very small yeast flakes populate the hazy, darkish golden orange body. Capped by a finger of sticky flourescent white head. Yeasty perfume of doughy sweet malt, candied anonymous fruit and resinous, sappy, cannabis-y hops. Very kind. Sharp hop acids bombard the tongue up front. Bitter, yet tasty...hmmmm...I like that. Hop taste is slightly citrusy, but mostly pitchy white fir sap. Light biscuit and fruit malt flavors are there, but can't quite keep pace with the aggressive hop attack. Finish stays hoppy and resinously bitter, with yeast, and hints of candied malt. Delicious. Very lively mouthfeel in a medium body. Almost too lively. Still, an IPA I could drink everyday."
"Slightly greenish hazy orange appearance. Crystalline head rises high and leaves tight and nicely complicated lace. Very good aroma, hops are almost like the freshest ground black pepper. Flavor is hoppy to be sure, again, pepper with a balsamic vinegar tone that suggests the richness of malts as much as anything else in the brew. Hops tend toward resiny (waxy) with a touch of orange cream soda, and if the malts don't keep up in obvious separate flavors, there is enough there to balance and give a good impression. Anyways, because of the flavorful hoppiness, I'm rating this as one of the best IPAs I've come across out of a bottle"
"12 oz. with September notched on the side. Pours a golden orange with lots of goodies floating around (unfiltered) and a 1 finger off-white head that leaves decent lacing. Scents are pine, citrus, and perfume and are very pungent. Flavors are sweet ruby red grapefruit, a sharp hop bitterness that lingers, and lots of malts which are stronger in the aftertaste. Also a little bit of bitter chocolate and coffee flavors which I don't usually find in IPAs. Lots of hops with a good malt backbone. Very smooth - nice carbonation and it coats the mouth well. Very drinkable and at 6.6% it can sneak up on you if you're not careful."
"for an IPA, this rates high. i prefer smutty's big beer series, but this is a fridge staple and perfect for a long-day refresher."
"($1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"Pours an amber, slightly orange colored brew, topped with a brilliant white, foamy head. The aroma is filled with piney, resiny, flirtingly floral hops. Theres a lot of funky citrus and flower smells thrown into the mix with an undertone of malt. Its a full, rich, and very satisfying beer. The hops are dominant in every aspect of the beer, but remain nicely balanced by the beers sweetness. The finish is seriously bitter, with a no-nonsense lingering flavor. I could still taste the hops for several minutes after a sip. Solid, exciting, and extraordinarily delicious."
"A nice smooth mouthfeel, drinkability is a little off...pepper doesn't go well with grapefruit. I'm guessing the yeast strain is to blame.. otherwise very nice."
"Smooth on the sip w/ hops that hits your sinuses pretty hard. A slightly bitter finish sums this one up and a huge aftertaste of flowery hops for hours!!! Good luck with this one!!!"
"Overall: One of the few beers that really lives up to its hype; undoubtedly the best American IPA I've tried. Well-balanced flavors coupled with an exceptional mouthfeel make this beer a true can't-miss standout of the style."
"Solid quaffing-styled IPA. Thanks Bighuge."
"Beer has a slightly opaque amber/orange body. A nice big, white foamy head tops it off. Great head retention, tons of lacing. All I could really smell were the hops, quite hoppy. It's an IPA, so it was bitter, one of the more bitter beers I've tasted. I generally like more hoppy/bitter beers, but this was a little much for me. It wasn't very complex, just a big uppercut of hops. It's good for what it is, though. Light mouthfeel, dry finish. I'm not sure I could drink more than two of these at a time, but could go for more than one."
"A nice beer, one to seek out, for sure. Not much head on it, but a pretty color, sort of sunset gold, with plenty of bubbles. Nice piney hops greet the nose. Whew, it is good stuff. Piney piney piney. Not over the top, just right. Good, and easy drinking, with enough kick to make you feel it a little. Clean, easy to drink, without a lot of the hop slickness you get from many IPAs."
"Pours a cloudy orange peach color with lots of noticeable chunks of sediment floating throughout the beer. Nose is pine and fresh grapefruit up front with a nice biscuity malt aroma in the background. Medium in body with a slightly sticky texture in the mouth. Taste begins with notes of grapefruit juice and a touch of grain followed by notes of pungent tobacco and bitter raw green hops that remain in a lasting aftertaste. A very fine IPA to be had here."
"One hell of an IPA. Maybe the best on the east coast. Brutally bitter, with a wonderful, full hop flavor throughout and just enough malt to keep a modicum of balance. One of the only beers I like enough to keep me entertained through an entire six pack. I usually get sick of a beer after two or three. Great, great stuff."
"Pours an orangish-yellow and is extremely cloudy and hazy. Never seen an IPA this cloudy before! The aroma is all hops: Citrus and flowers. What a great taste. Very citrusy with a light to moderate bitterness. Not too rough on the palate, just the right amount of carbonation. Very smooth and very drinkable. An outstanding and unique IPA!"
"Worth the wait; worth the search! A bright golden hue, a 1/8th inch head that maintains very well. The nose is nice  hops (duh), freshly peeled grapefruit and some grassiness. Slightly carbonated, full bodied; a huge blast of hops combined with some decent maltiness, which is what makes this special. Creamy, oily and juicy  what other IPA does this? This is like-totally drinkable; a sneaky 6.6 ABV  you bet! An awesome IPA!"
"An excellent American-style IPA. Extremely drinkable. In fact, I think I'll have another."
"12 ounce bottle received in trade from Dave. Thanks for the opportunity to try this delightful beer. Poured from a 12 oz bottle notched August. The bottle had some obvious sediment- poured clear orange-copper until the sediment hit, then turned hazy. Two finger foamy oyster white head that left tight lacing. The nose? wow, it hits before you pick up the glass, while you're still admiring the pour. Grapefruit and hops, a touch of peach. The taste is grapefruit through and through- I could drink this for breakfast! There is a subtle sweet malt underbelly too, but this beer is about hops. Mouthfeel is velvety carbonation up front, dry and tart on the palate long after the beer is gone. If you don't like hoppiness, you won't find the pleasure I did in this fine IPA."
"First of all, Smuttynose has some great labels on their beers, and this one of the two old dudes in their lawnchairs enjoying a Smutty is my favorite. Funny. This beer is a slightly orangy color with a big frothy head. Aroma is intensly hoppy and full of citrus. Taste is crazy hoppy, even for an IPA. Very tangy and citrussy up front. Not a lot of malt present to back it up though, but this beer is meant (I would assume) to be hoppy all the way. Letting this beer warm up a bit is a good idea because the crazy hops can mask the more subtle tastes of apircots and other fruits. Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability? Um, yeah. I'm definately going to finish the whole sixer now. Cheers."
"All in all, reminds me of why I love IPAs, and quite possibly my favorite IPA thus far. A truly excellent brew, and my thanks again to afatty for sharing this one with me, as well. You've got great taste, man."
"The tap version of this beer is nearly identical to the bottled version, but the cask version is quite different. I was quite dissapointed with this beer on tap, but than again maybe the keg was old or the lines were a bit messed up at McGradys."
"A very addictive beer. Nice hazy orange color looks very inviting. Wonderful flavors, strong, yet not overwhelming. The hop presence is obviously the most significant taste, citrus and pine needles. But a sweet blend of the two. Paired with the wonderful malt flavor similar to that found in their outstanding Shoal's Pale Ale. An exceptional beer, much like every Smuttynose product."
"A delightfully easy IPA to drink, and packs with it tons of flavor. It's one of the best I've had and would be welcome in my fridge any time."
"Poured a moderately hazy peach, with small amount of white sediment flakes drifting about. Pungent grapefruity aroma, a bit flatter in the flavor profile than the aroma. Firm, slightly acidic bittering than lingers at the back of the tongue. Some notable biscuit flavors in the malt, but well integrated. Thanks to far333 for another winner."
"All the talk in IPAs recently has been about Imperial this, Imperial that, and not unfairly as I love them. Still, there's room for the regular IPAs in the world, and this beer is up with HopDevil as the best!! I love the sort of grapefruity hops that this beer provides, and I'll gladly have this one in the future!!"
"Deep hazy apricot hue. Bottle-conditioned. Small white head doesnt keep up. Grassy nose with a faint honeyish malt touch. Tangy citrus fruit, very coniferous. Piney finish, very bitter, coating dryness. Mostly simple. Nice mouthfeel, lively carbonation, medium body. Good development all-around, very tasty, but what makes it better than a bièropholie, arbor sacred cow or anchor liberty, I cant tell. Youll like it better than me I guess, its good, but its the first time I have it and I feel like I had it 10 times+ already. Were I a hophead, I'd shoot for something just a tad bigger in hops (not that this is any weak). Now I'm not and I'd hope for more malt or yeast originality. A beer for a market I don't understand."
"Nothing really surprising from this one. Needs some serious malt backing though, even if its just a simple pale malt."
"The mouthfeel is good....smooth and not too bubbly. The body is just right. Drinkability on this one is good...totally a session brew here. I would drink it more often if I could get my hands on it. A damn fine IPA I'd suggest to anyone. Thanks to blitheringidiot for hooking me up with this one."
"Drinkability  This is a solid example of the wonderful diversity that we can find in East Coast IPAs. This hop bomb is definitely worth a look."
"An unexpected sweet ruby-red grapefruit taste, but still tingly, hoppy, acidic the on tongue. Definitely a dry aftertaste, puckering mouuthfeel, Mister Savory would probably give this two thumbs-up. Should be served with a grapefruit spoon, just for kicks. Despite the heavy-handed hops, I think the light bit of sweetness mellows this one out just enough to make it pretty darn drinkable."
"Drinkability: A very drinkakable IPA due to it's complex character and reasonable ABV."
"Decent but too bitter for my taste, as I prefer an IPA with a stronger malt balance. It did grow on me though."
"Extreme bitterness throughout the palate. This is a big, bad boy India Pale Ale and I am simply amazed at its complete transformation from about 45 to 55 degrees. I was about to slam it, until it warmed up. Sticky, fruity, dominating hop flavor. Notes of grapefruit, peels, pine, pineapple, lemon and orange. Full, bodacious mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness. My only complaint: The finish is a little to dry."
"had it on tap 5 years later and it held up. Hi IBU still. Revised rating."
"Body is hardly medium and could use some beefing up. Texture is crisply slick with a soft mouthfeel and sparse carbonation."
"Poured a big, three-finger head atop a hazy, golden-orange beer. The head diminished a bit and left nice lacing and remained the entire time I drank. The aroma was all citrus (orange and grapefruit) with a slight skunkiness. Its taste was much like its aroma - big hoppy flavors... citrus up front, a little spice in the middle and a strong bitter finish that remained in my mouth for far too long for my tastes. Some malty sweetness appeared as the beer warmed but for the most part, this IPA was all about bitterness. Its mouthfeel was medium and slightly oily. It's not my favorite IPA to date and pales in comparison to Smuttynose's Big A IPA, which is much more balanced. I wouldn't turn another down but I also wouldn't seek one out."
"This is a big Westcoast IPA made DownEast. The colour is a nice pale gold with some sediment( sorry, bad pour) and a huge citrus hoppy nose that lets you know that Stone and Bridgeport are being challenged from the other coast. Like all great IPA's this one has that intrinsic balance that backs up the hops. A complex IPA that sadly it not available on the West Coast."
"Drinkability: A phenomenal, good ol' fashioned American IPA. Dazamn. Stone IPA, move over: I'm making mine a Smutty."
"Pours out golden with a slight haze and a large frothy head. Nice citrousy apricot aroma that stands out from the pack. I can smell a peach in here. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma, but more subtle. Flavors are less pronouced, but the combination of citrous and floral type hops makes for a good taste, almost masking the bitterness in the finish, which this beer needs more of. I like my IPA's with bite, and this falls a bit short in that department. Nonetheless this is not your average IPA and is very flavorful, even though there is not a whole lot of malt character - the hops provide ample flavor here. Mouthfeel is dull, kind of subdued, but I could drink plenty of this stuff. A good IPA, and surely some would consider it great. I just need a little more backlash from my IPAs"
"12 ounce bottle depicts two old gents laughing while sitting in lawn chairs in front of their trailer. The beer pours a golden orange with a moderate head and fine lacing. Citrusy hops and grassy aromas dominate the nose. Taste is crisp hop bitterness backed up by fruity overtones, grapefruit above all. Finish is dry and creamy. Overall an excellent new england IPA with amazing drinkability, and a beer I will be returning to quite often."
"Dirty orange peel/rind smell. Persistant airy thick pale white head with great lacing. Hazy orange and gold look in the pint glass. buttery malt upfront on the tip of the tongue is the initial taste then a wave of citrus and pine bitterness moves and explodes fron the back of the tongue forward. Very crisp bitter finish. Quite balenced for such a hop monster. Medium coating mouth with a slightly dry finish that yearns for more. A solid very good quality quality IPA.."
"Pours a hazy amber with a nice sticky frothy inch sized head. Smell hits you with the citrus hops, and then gives you a little nose of malt, but the hops dominate the aroma. The first sips tells you this is gonna be a winner. Nice malt backbone gives way to a grapefruit-citrus hop sensation which drys the beer out nicely and gives it enough bitterness. Carbonation is fine and the beer is silky smooth. This is far more balanced than the Big A ipa. Drinkability is high. A great session beer ( although watch it is 6.6) this is a beer made for sitting on the deck with friends and sipping the evening away."
"A gift from a friend and fellow BA who was traveling through upstate NY. Wish I had more."
"I was fortunate to taste the Big A IPA at the Hop Head Throw Down. So I thought I would follow up with a review of this beer. It pours an orange/copper color, slightly hazy. It had a nice head that retained, and a delicate lace on the top of the glass. It has a very light aroma of grass, maybe a little citrus. The first taste brings a sharpness of the hops to the front of your tongue. The middle maintains the hops (maybe a little of the citrus), a nice bitterness on the back end. It has a nice, medium body mouth feel, and a very high drinkability. Its a great warm weather session beer."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. The beer is a lightly cloudy golden orange color. Compact off-white head and very thin lacing. Floral hops, citrus and pine in the nose. Medium-bodied with a fairly bitter character. Hops, grapefruit and a light malt undertone. The finish has a long-lasting bitterness to it with a sharp citrus tartness. All in all this is a solid IPA, my one complaint is the bitterness is not as flavorful as in top-tier IPAs. It is just...bitter."
"Backwash: Im glad this this put Smutty back on track for me. I was a bit worried after the Big A IPA, which disappointed me; but this restored my faith. I also had a chance to try some on draught this weekend and was pleasantly surprised to find that the bottles were pretty much as good. Find some anyway you can get it!"
"Interesting bottle art on this with 2 old guys on the front in lawn chairs with bottle around the yard. This pours a hazy golden orange color with a tall rocky eggshell white head standing out of the glass. It leaves nice clingy sheets of lacing around the glass as it is consumed. Very nice and strong aroma here, with the scent of various hops filling the immediate area after this is poured. There are citric and floral aromas in abundance as well as pine and spice notes. The taste is similar to the nose as the citric and floral hops dominate the taste from front to back. The slight malt sweetness pulls together the flavor very nicely and a bit of spice adds to the kick. The taste ends with a nice dry bitter finish as this goes down. Medium to full mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is very drinkable despite the biting hops that are present through out. Definitely my new session beer of choice."
"I will buy this one again for sure."
"Cloudy dull salmon-tinged gold in color. Sticky, long-lasting white head slathers the glass and leaves a delicate weaved pattern of lace. Aromas are big-time IPA: loads of grapefruit juice, supported by pine sap, freshly-cut flowers, and some honey. Flavors are very tasty. The grapefruit really pulls through in the taste. However, the flavor is more balanced than the nose. A honey-toffee-caramel base supports this avalanche of hops. Very nicely balanced. Full mouthfeel and quite creamy. Low levels of carbonation beef this one up. Honey-infused bitterness lingers on the palate. Very drinkable and one that I am *very* glad I can easily get in Richmond."
"This one seems like it wants to venture into west coast IPA territory but falls a little short.."
"Slightly cloudy amber with a sizable cloud-like and long-lasting white head. I lean in for a sniff and jerk back in shock. This smells a LOT like Sweetwater IPA. Its got the same hop complexity being a little bit herbal, a little bit grapefruit and a bit of peach/apricot. The flavor even has that bit of biscuit-like malt. The main difference is that the finish in this one is much more bitter."
"I like it, though, I'd drink it by the bucket-ful. Very tasty, though it lacks in any kind of hoppy sting, as well as malty blanket that I feel are necessary for a top-rank IPA...one guy's opinion!"
"Overall: I would combine it with spicy foods, such as Thai, Indian, and Cajun. This beer is the perfect IPA and I think its great addition to Smuttynoses lineup."
"Pours a nice just off white head, slightly hazy light amber/golden liquid. Skunk bud and Amarillo hop nose...very fresh and sharp. The taste is quite bitter, with little maltiness to balance the hoppiness out sufficiently, could use a little more backbone here. Finishes pungently hoppy with a long hop fadeout. A hophead's delight, this one is!"
"Drinkability: This is just a top quality IPA.. Who wouldn't want to have more than a few."
"Murky looking, but luminescent peach tone. Thin dirty white head. Lacing provides nicely spaced sagging rings on the walls of my glass. Sticky cannabis, orange rind, pine resin and light smoke on the nose. Really nice aroma. Pungent hop taste hits the buds first. After that subsides a little, a nice bitterness comes in and gives me something to think about. Quite clean. The smoky, MaryJane-like tones come into play on the palate as well. Kind of sticky. Juicy hops take over from time to time. Underneath all the hop play, there's a substantial enough malt base of biscuit and toffee. Body is medium at best. And the level of carbonation seems fiiting and has a bit of scrubbing power. All in all, this is very nice. Reminds me of the Bitter Woman, in a bit of a diluted sense."
"This bottle was brought back from Cinaminson, NJ by my buddy and fellow BA Geoff (SurlyDuff). Appearance: Hazed with hop particles suspended in an orange amber body matched with a big doughy looking slightly gelatinous healthy sized off white orange tinted head leaves heavy thick lacing beautiful appearance. Aroma: Is quite floral with a touch of pine and citrus, really quite grassy with the malt sweetness relatively unnoticeable. Taste: Big rush of hops hits the palate the high bitterness and low sweetness may seem a bit unbalanced at times, but I for one am thouroughly enjoying this blatant use of hops. Pine cones and grassy citrus bursts flow along my palate along with a touch of the pale malt sweetness bringing a bready quality about it, in short this is one big hoppy American IPA. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly resinous mouthfeel I like the raw hop flavor a bit unrefined but downright ideal for most hop heads easy even carbonation well done. Drinkability: Easily forms the cream of the crop when referring to American IPAs, I have been on the fence with some of Smuttynose products but I assure you this is a winner, an aggressive flavorful IPA just what the doctor ordered for us hop heads."
"This is a real nice version of style. Good complexity in both hop qualities and nice malt flavor. Just not at the level of a few others."
"Had on tap at Redbones. Pour was rich light->medium amber. I found the aroma to be a bit muted, ie, nothing jumped out at me. Medium mouthfeel is very pleasant, most of the taste lies in the smooth malt backbone, which gets followed by a burst of fresh citrus hops. Pleasant, easy to drink, would get again."
"Nice deep orange color.Creamy head that leaves some nice lace down the glass.Huge hop aroma.Huge big malty flavor with a great big hop flavor.Not overpowering but huge and upfront.Great full mouthfeel-nice citrusy,puckering aftertaste.A very drinkable beer.While a ""good size"" IPA its certainly not over the top.Enjoyable as hell."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy apricot color with three fingers of head. There is lots and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell consists of floral hops and some citrus fruit. A great classic IPA nose. The taste consists of hops layered upon hops layered upon hops. Fresh hop bitterness comes out of the glass to bite the tongue. Some malt barely makes it past the piney hops. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong, and the drinkability is good as well. A great summertime IPA!"
"Where is the 6.6% abv? I could spend a night drinking these with how well the hops mask the abv. An absolute treat to drink if you're a hophead."
"Pours a nice medium, slightly cloudy gold with a nice, frothy off-white head. Good hoppy tones; mildly skunky. Smells like the people I sat next to at the KISS concert earlier this week; Very Herbaceous! Hoppy, slightly hempy palate. Dry and tart finish, with little or no malt showing up. Mild mouthfeel, and quite dry and light. A nice IPA from the East Coast. Really glad to get to try this one. Thanks to UncleJimbo."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a hazy orange/gold. Lots of nice lacing on the glass. Smell is faint and piney. Taste is of intense grapefruit, bitter hops (extremely bittler) and somewhat salty. This beer has a real nice mouthfeel; lots of carbonation. Taste lingers in the back of the tongue for a nice, long, bitter finish. A very intersting and powerful IPA! Very nice."
"I bought a six pack of the Smuttynose IPA and was incredibly impressed. This is an amazing American IPA. The beer is full of tasty and complex hops. There is a very evident citrus flavor bursting through with every sip that beautifully balances the bitterness of the hops. This has become one of my favorite IPA's. Great beer."
"addendum: after a couple slices of pizza, the grapefruit flavor in this IPA really came out strong. Too bad I don't like grapefruit! ;)"
"A nice showcase of hop flavors with a balancing front and prominent edge of hops in the finish. Reminds me alot of Bell's Two-Hearted with just a bit more hop finish, therefore, just a tad less on the drinkability. But very good non-the-less. Big thanks to Jason for the supply of this stuff!"
"Hands down my favorite NE IPA, next time I am buying a case or two."
"Overall- a very good IPA, not as good as the Big IPA from what I recall. Worth trying but the bitterness can be a bit too much!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has nice malty scent covered with an intense citrous hop aroma. It smells just like a fresh grapefruit. The taste is great. It has a solid malt base; mostly pale and light crystal malts. It also has an enormous hop flavor that is quite citrousy and bitter on the aftertaste. It goes down easy and refreshes on the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good IPA. It has tremendous flavor and awesome aroma; a good sessions beer."
"drinkability: for me low, as I am not a fan of this genre, but a hop nut, would probably love it!"
"Whoa..dry..dry...dry. I love it. Unbelievably, there is a smooth quality in the mouthfeel that lasts until the finishing hops slam you...great! Appearance is fine with a nice head and lacing, but the chunky yeast is still not my favorite. Smell, like the mouthfeel is a rounded bouquet of citrus and fruits. Taste is very citrus, having a drying effect on the overall experience...nice. Very drinkable for the style...next time, I'll get a sixer. Up there with Hop Devil IMHO."
"Murky and tantalizing. Small groups of soldiers sink to the bottom of their creation. Clinging to everything it touches, trying to escape its captor, the froth is alive. Floral bouquets with cornicopias of citrus fruit provide temptation. Sticky honey provides a dirty sweetness to trap you in. Then the bitter launches its assault."
"Hazy golden orange appearance with a two finger tall creamy rich head is dead on for an IPA. The head is constantly replenished by lively carbonation in the beer, and leaves a ton of lace around the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly hops, and is brimming with a citric and piney bouquet. There is also an undertone of maltyness on the nose. The taste is very crisp with the grapefruit like and peppery hops complimented very well by toasty pale and caramel malt. The mouthfeel is medium thick and juicy with a dry finish. A great representation of the IPA style, and a welcome surprise as a part of the BIF 7.0 shipment from Foxman."
"Damn - thats a fine IPA! Some caramel & biscuity malt followed by an onslaught of fruit, orange, pine, & slight floral notes. Medium bodied, relaxed carbonation. Reminds me a lot of Shoals Pale Ale, except on steroids."
"This poured a nice hazy orange-amber color with a lovely head that lasts a while. The aroma is citrusy, fruity, very pleasant and enticing. This is a finely balanced IPA with none of the over-the-top hopping that characterizes so many American IPA's. Though the hops are the predominating attraction, there's enough of a malt backbone to balance the whole affair very nicely. Left a nice laciness down the side of the glass due to it's medium body. Thoroughly enjoyable and a nice session brew."
"12 ounce bottle. Bottled in March."
"This is a very fine India Pale Ale. Pours a nice amber color. A descent head forms and stays. The smell is pleasant, with hints of hops and slightly fruity. The taste is refreshingly delightful. Nice bittering blended with malty sweetness. Almost a hint of peach at some points. Go out and buy this fine beer. Don't get a six pack, get a case, as this is a highly drinkable beer and you won't want to run short."
"Pours a hazy dark golden color with a finger width white head on top that didn't sustain itself for too long. Turned into a ring around the glass and lace sticking to the side. Smell was strongly scented with syrupy hops juices and just a little malty sweetness. The taste was supremely hoppy with the more juiciness up front with the hops changing to a more bitter piney resin flavor in the finish. There was a bit of charred malt flavor but it was much more focused on the hops. The mouthfeel was crisp and just slightly syrupy. All in all this could be THE summer IPA. Definitely takes the cake over the 60 minute merely for cost sake. Seek this out!"
"hazy golden orange with hints of brown. Smells like concentrated pine needles and raw hop leaf. the head is slightly orange with sticky with hop oi making a wonderful lace as you sip. taste is heavenly pine like a wonderful maine (or NH for that matter) fall day. It is like chewing on pine needles and full hop bubble gum, leaving a thick sticky raw hop feel in your mouth. Easily drinkable, specially on a warm day after a hard days work of serving clam chowder, really clears the the grease and seafood taste out of my nostrils and mouth after working in a seafood resteraunt all day. Good stuff filled with those wonderful hop burps that burn enough to let you know you drank a hop headed beer."
"My goodness, look what New Hampshire has wrought! It's about the hops, but the grain has just enough muscle to balance and accent the hoppy highlights. Simply, there's a lot here to like a lot. The biting refreshing character goes a long way toward making it very, very drinkable, and in my eyes, that's true craftsmanship at work. After reading about it, I was excitied to see it on the shelves. After drinking it, I'm even more excited about taking the next one out of my fridge."
"Medium, crisp body, fruity bitterness builds towards the bottom of the drink. Cuts right through spicy food and makes a good pairing. I also liked it poured harder than normal."
"A cloudy golden ale, Smuttynose IPA pours with a thick creamy head that remains through the entire glass. A beautiful beer. The nose is full of piney, spicy, grapefruity hops - and lots of them! Taste is hoppy, with a firm malt backbone and a bitter, sharp aftertaste. This beer is all about hops - it's how I remember my first IPA tasting - but it has the body to back it up. An excellent, very drinkable IPA - perfect for hopheads who want something that is a little less strong than some of the more trendy imperial IPAs."
"Simply superb. It's as if the brewers at Smuttynose took a reading directly from my brain regarding 'BuckeyeNation's IPA wish list' and then proceeded to brew a perfect match. I've had a lot of amazing beer in a very short period of time and this IPA is one of the best of the best. Highly recommended (in case you hadn't already figured that out)."
"Drinkability: Good, only I think that after a few of these your tastebuds would be shot for the evening. Numbing in its extremity, this is still an awesome IPA that could be enjoyed in mass quantity. Very happy to have found it on tap in PA."
"A very enjoyable IPA that disguises the 6.6% abv very well. Complex and well balanced, and with some very nice hops."
"Pours a hazy orange colour with a thick white head that quickly dissapates. The aroma was fruity with citrus undertones. The taste was a strong floral taste. Roses mixed well with lemon. Very hoppy. Very nice. Lots of great hop bitterness. A great beer by Smuttynose once again."
"The mouthfeel is mildly crisp with a biting finish where the bitterness seems to be glued to your tongue. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Nicely drinkable if you are a hophead, but beware if you are not..."
"a semi-vigerous pour produced a decent sized, fluffy but chunky tan head on top of a cloudy copper colour with floating bits everywhere. the head leaves a nice sticky residue on the glass. the smell here is quite nice, with hops coming at you off the bat, with some earth, bark, biscuit, fruit and pinecone notes apparent. the flavour is nice and balanced like the nose, but earth notes overshadow the sweetness a bit here. this one starts out sweet and remains so in the middle and then the hops hit you full on at the finish (mixed in still with a dirty earth flavour), but even then it's not a hop blast, a la many west coast ipa's, but it's a nice kick in the taste buds, nonetheless. the mouthfeel is wickedly smooth and thus makes for a nice quenching year round brew. a nice new offering from the folks at smutty."
"About a month ago I was able to have this brew on tap while at Mahars, on a return trip yesterday I was able to experience bottled. I think I actually like it more from the bottle and I really loved in on tap! This brew poured to a cloudy/hazy orange color with a nice fluffy white head the left chunky rings down the whole brew. The aroma is hops and a lot of it very floral with a very strong citrus smell. Man, this beer smells incredible. The taste is great, slicing citrus (grapefruit) hop right from the start with a nice bitterness throughout. I can sense other flavors in the background but it is hard to pinpoint them, but they all seem to balance out as well as you can with a hoppy monster like this! I know I had it on tap and was impressed but wow, not sure if it is because the weather has gotten hotter or what but this brew blew me away! This is probably the best IPA that I have had to date with Berkshires Lost Sailor a close second! This made my evening!"
"i'll take this one fresh out of the bottle over the tap any day. bright, sweet, and exploding with flavor. i think i've found a new favorite session ipa. awesome stuff."
"Excellent and long-lasting head, good lace retention, and a marvelous aroma of hops. Juicy, juicy hops taste with a slightly chewy mouthfeel. And then more hops. And all balanced with a lingering malty sweetness. One of my new favorite IPAs, very much in a league with 60 Minute and other hops blasters -- but, again, nicely balanced with malt."
"This beer pours a hazy apricot color into the pint glass with a decent finger and a half head, which leaves some nice patchy foam at the rim of the glass. Recedes into a thin layer slowly. Smell: Theres a distinct wheat aroma to this beer, which is equaled by a fruity hop aroma, with the underlying pine, alcohol and yeast hues. Taste is grapefruit, grapefruit, and citruis, with a subtle hint of grapefruit. This huge hoppiness is really in your face at first, but as the pint progresses, and you get used to it, it reveals its more subtle flavors. There is a small burnt flavor to this, with a very hidden syrupy sweetness. Aftertaste is the same bitter citruis as before. Mouthfeel is wonderful, with a medium (yet somewhat dry tasting body), just the right amount of carbonation and the perfect sense of how much alcohol you are in fact drinking to it. A great IPA to say the least"
"This is my first straight 5's review and given the fact that I have drank little else in the past month I'm confident with that. I think a good analogy could be made by comparing this brew to a CD; Smuttynose IPA is that new album that you just can't take out of the CD player and when you do try to listen to something else you're just waiting to pop the Smutty back in. This will definately be in heavy rotation for the rest of the summer, at least."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this hazy golden brew formed and retained pleasant head. The grapefruit and generic citrus aromas were inviting. It's a very transparent brew, with some interesting flavors. The hops are crisp and clear, with grapefruit and citrus notes as dominant - but not obnoxious flavors. There's an understated, but noticeable malt background to balance the flavors. I was impressed by the body of the beer, and will enjoy it again."
"Perhaps the best Smuttynose offering to date? Will be a staple in my fridge for summer."
"If you like hoppy beers Smuttynose IPA should be on your list. It's packed full of flavor and you can't have just one."
"Clear apricot colored with a foamy beige head that settles quickly, but leaves a fine cap of bubbles across the top. Aroma is bright floral hoppy with hints of sweet citrus, and some pine. Flavor is a burst of hops, big and bitter, sweet and citrusy. Finishes with a bitter orange peel flourish, and lingers with a piney bite. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation. Nice oily webbing around the inside of the glass."
"The two old guys in their lawn chairs on the label beckoned me to try this IPA, even though it is 45 degrees out (and raining). The smuttynose pours of slightly cloudy apricot color with a medium-thick fluffy off-white head. The aroma is of hops and citrus, predominantly grapefruit, with some underlying pine and floral smells. Not much malt residuals. The taste is wonderful; it is a delightfully intricate balance of the citrus (less pervasive here than in the Dogfish Head 60), some fresh breadiness, and finely textured hops. I savored every moment. The finish is appropriately bitter, and the mouthfeel is right on--medium bodied with just the perfect touch of carbonation. A real winner!"
"Finally, an IPA that isn't hopped to hell. Smutty has done it again with this little number. good gold color, great carbonation and awesome hops. They don't overwhelm you like some of today's over hopped beers, but they don't let you forget they are there. Yum."
"Zum wohl!"
"Pours a solid gold color, with hints of orange. Head is good and lacy, but not especially long lasting or carbonated. You can really smell the hops when you take a whiff of this sucker! Taste is bitter and delicious, not much subtle in the flavor but much that is bold and hoppy. Quite enjoyable and refreshing."
"Seek it. Buy it. Enjoy it."
"This beer promises much and delivers almost as much. A scent of pine and vanilla bean. A definite prescence of hop flavor mellowed by malt; an amber/orange hue and good glass lacing make this an exceptional session beer. Reminded me very much of Wild Goose IPA though separated by distance maybe kindred in spirit. A definite above average IPA though a long way to go from the ""hop-devil"" in me or my friends floyd A.; Floyd P; and Floyd R. Prost!"
"This came in my Easter gift basket from my mother-in-law today and it was a definant treat,pours a nice golden color with some orange tint with light but pretty sticky head.Nice balanced aroma I picked up a big hoppy grassy aroma right off the bat but a real nice lingering biscuity aroma came thru as the beer settled.An IPA with a malt backbone what a concept!A big zesty herbal flavor hit right away but settles nicely with a slightly sweet malt attack in the finish.One of the better IPA's I have had in quite some time."
"Exceeded my expectations.This will be a prime contender for ""Beer of the Summer of '04"" in my house."
"Overall I was really impressed with this beer. Much more complex than I expected when I ordered it. A great beer Ill be trying again."
"Quite a bit of lupulin in this one but not as abundantly fresh tasting as some of its competition. A more than fair IPA that I'm glad to have snagged. Great price at $7 a sixer, I use it to wake my palate before dinner. Very funny label design, too."
"696"
"12 oz bottle, dating system just shows a notch in the label for March. Not much help. Pours light golden, cloudy. Off white puffy head, which stayed around for a long time. Nice lace observed after a few swigs. Nose is of hops. Taste is of MEGA dry hops. Pine, citrus, grapefruit, resin etc. Were talking alot of hop flavor. Nice American style IPA, nothing shy about this one. All Hop heads will enjoy Smutty's IPA."
"At $7 a 6, I can't think of a nicer IPA. Not for the malt lover, but if you crave hops, dive right in."
