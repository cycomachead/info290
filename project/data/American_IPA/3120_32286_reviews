"Love me some Nelson! And it's cool to see it with rye, in this instance mellow, but an often rather harsh malt. So much hype, rad to finally have one at back country in boulder. Pour is a really light pale golden color with an opaque orange lowlight and a lasting inch of airy white bubbles. Smells like Nelson alright, although somewhat less pungent and fresh than anticipated, and especially mellow for a top 250 IPA. The flavor is more dynamic than the nose, but also underwhelming. As good as it is, and it is real good, I wanted more from the hops. The rye is a real nice twist and can be both tasted and felt, but this lends credence to my theory that it's near impossible to make a bad beer with this hop. It just doesn't pip pineapple like others, and with such a no bull name, I thought this would be the loudest Nelson statement of all time, and it's not. It's freakishly dry though, so hops and rye do stand out, and there isn't much of a yeast profile happening at all. Carbonation is really lively, and I don't mean to belittle this because it is amazing, and a real nice use of one of my favorite hops, but it just doesn't stand out far enough from the heard to be labeled one if the best IPAs ever, at least in my opinion."

"I'm having a Nicholas Cage moment in Leaving Las Vegas. While I'm not on a bender destined to succumb myself in alcohol poisoning, each sip of this magnificent beer has me calling out for a nurse. I'm worried my neighbors may think I've gone mad. I don't even know where to begin, it's so unbelievable. First off, the pour on Nelson is beyond reproach; only rivaled by Heady Topper. Brilliant orange, super cloudy, spotty lacing. Very excellent head retention. The nose has hints of white wine from the use of Nelson Sauvin hops, and is backed by tons of citrus. Taste follows with grapefruit and pineapple. So freaking balanced I can barely stand it, as if that isn't an oxymoron in itself. The mouthfeel is creamy as ever, and I can't stop smacking my lips. I never thought I would enjoy a rye IPA so much. This is a world-class, must try beer, especially for people like me, who primarily drink IPAs. Those who have access to this on a regular basis should consider themselves extremely lucky. Hard to find a flaw. JUST WOW!"

"O: A touch lighter in color than I expected. I finally got to try this sober, by myself, and not during a bottle share. I feel like my expectations of this were higher because every time I've had it, it has been in 2-4oz increments, after already wrecking my palate. I can't wait to get out to California and visit the brewery."
"Spicy, sweet and citrusy. Interesting combo and and a nice light sweet(ish) malt base. Nice medium bitterness in the finish."

"Higgggh five Beer is good"

"Ahhh the hazy color I love (just say no to clear beers!).... crisp hoppy goodness, a little pine and citrus, just enough malt to balance, mild bitter finish... love it... toss up between double citra and this for my left coast favorite!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed Nelson's drinkibility and smooth balanced character. The hops don't blow you away with flavor such as other juicy hop-bombs, but work well with the malt backbone and aren't cloying at all. Would drink again."

"O m f g so good"
"Overall: I was skeptical of the hype. I was convinced it was just hype. But the beer is actually stellar. Good job alpine."
""
""

"the look is a hazy yellow unfiltered look. initial smell is very fruity and citrusy. Initial taste is very sweet and a hint of spicy. the taste is kind f like second fiddle but with a more sweeter mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Had it for the first time on draft at my buddies place (Strangers in El Centro) did indeed taste different from the Nelson 's  of Alpine.  Still an easy citrusy drink to have very good.  Hopefully green flash can close the gap and make it a world class beer."

"Poured a cloudy orange body with one finger head and lace patches on top of an aroma that is both citric and grapefruit hop infused along with some spices and possible touch of citric acidity and sourness (I assume the Nelson).  Medium bodied, rather a more grape/tropical fruit like sweetness but balanced with  both dry hoppiness and dry, bold malts (I assume this is the rye).  A really enjoyable IPA that doesn't fit the norm and has a little bit of everything."

"Overall, what makes this beer special is how well everything comes together.  That’s the thing with a lot of these high-profile brews; it isn’t necessarily one thing that stands out about it, but rather it is just how incredibly well the thing stands as a whole and from a distance.  The balance is amazing, with the fruitiness of the Nelsons bonding with the extended, lingering bitterness of the rye grain inclusions.  Again, nothing really stands out here, except for everything all at once…if that makes sense.  If we had to point out something surprising or particularly exciting about Nelson, it would have to be his feel.  It is soft, full, creamy, froth, and slurpy, pulling the mouth in every conceivable direction you would want it to.  What a happy experience this has been, making us desperately hope that the rumors about Alpine expanding to our local market are indeed true."

"Had on draft. Corroborating those who have complained about the kegs brewed at Green Flash not being spectacular. The nose was weak, was not overwhelmed by the taste (muted citrus IPA). This was one of the weaker showings of Nelson hops I've ever had. 3.5 - above average, not special."

"Overall: Very well made beer I am glad I got to try this one. It reminds me a lot in taste and aroma of several others but the clean lighter mouthfeel is what kicks it off for me!"

"On tap at Simzy’s LB poured into footed stange. Hazy golden body with a thin white head that settles to a thin ring. Lace rings. Aroma is piney, with grape skin, herbs, rye spice, citrus, and grass. Taste is initially dank and musty with moderate bitterness featuring the same flavors as the nose. Some malt and tropical fruit sweetness comes through. Rye spiciness hits on the swallow. Medium body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, and a dry bitter finish."
"Outlier detected. Justify rating with a review."

"My favorite TG IPA is Zeelander, and was really looking forward to this.  Nose was awesome, but taste and finish were an abrupt Malty/Rye insult, and not as I had hoped.  Still a decent beer."

""
"This beer deserves the hype it gets- it's really tasty."

"Another great Alpine offering!!  Pales only in comparison to EXP Hoppiness and Duet!"

"Fantastically original IPA. Don't hesitate if you see it anywhere."

"Sampled on tap at Craft and Commerce in SD.  Pours a bright, yet hazy, straw color with 1/2 inch of fine bubbled head that stood up well into the beer.  Nose is dominated by slightly tart citrus notes and pine with biscuity malt backing.  The taste is more malt than the nose would lead one to believe but the balance was beautiful as the tart citrus flavor was wonderful. Creamy mouth feel.  Love this beer - the hype is well deserved."
""
""
"Hazy amber. Cantalope, grapefruit, star fruit, sticky hop. Surprisingly resiny, not a long finish. Decent"
""
""
""
""
"Amazing Pine notes and amazingly drinkable although I prefer generally more bitter ipas this is Amazing"
"This beer is amazing! Depending upon your location this is  probably more difficult to get your hands on than Pliny or Heady. Drank fresh at Alpine on draft and brought back a couple of bottles. Don't be fooled by the cloudy pour or hoppy smell,  this is one easy to drink beer!"

"O: Great showcase of Nelson Sauvin hops, bright and full of flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer reminded me, a little, of Deschutes Fresh Squeezed (similar citrus hop flavor). The Deschutes beer is superior, however, because it possesses more of a toasty malt flavor to balance out the hops. Also, I assumed that this beer would have a sweet malty English taste due to the name (Lord Nelson?). The beer has neither the color nor the malt foundation of an English bitter/pale ale. For these reasons, this is a good beer but not a great beer."

"What an odd looking beer.  Not sure if this is typical, but the beer appears to have a slight green hue.  Fortunately it smells great, lots of citrus.  Taste is a notch below the small, but still a high quality IPA, wasn't wowed by it based on Alpine hype.  Would happily drink this again, but don't plan to seek it out."

"Pours a great hazy orange even my non drinking wife was blown away. Just a great looking beer. Like all Alpine beer I've ever had the nose is beautiful and fruity. Beautiful balance, long smooth finish. I love Nelson hops and this is my favorite example. A top 5 beer of all time for me for sure."

"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a creamy white head. Smells like sweet tropical fruit, some earthiness, and citrus. Taste follows the smell. Super well balanced with huge hop flavor. Earthy, fruity, citrusy, and dank. Some grape in there as well, which is to be expected from Nelson Sauvin. Bitterness is right where it should be. Mouthfeel is unbelievable. The addition of rye makes this beer drink like milk. Really creamy and definitely a unique experience. Overall a fantastic IPA worthy of a 100 score on BA. I can't think of a better single IPA than this."

"Hazing yellow, odd for an IPA. Tropical/grapefruit, white wine, herbal & floral on the nose.  Beautiful aroma.  Massive tropical fruit and white wine on the taste, the spice of the rye pulls the finish dry and leaves you wanting another sip.  Soft carbonation and minimal lacing on the glass. Remarkable beer, unique and simply the best. Nelson transcends the IPA style."

" Overall: Outstanding brew. Too many times breweries don't let nelson hops roam on their own but alpine boldly goes where most are afraid and came back with one shining example how to make a nelson IPA ! Alpine is the pinnacle of IPAs in SD right now and this one delivers in spades! If your love nelson hops or want to try them out the right way get this beer"

"My favorite IPA from Alpine"
""
"So often these over hyped beers end up being a let down...not this one. This may very well be the best single IPA I've ever had. Nelson is at the forefront of this brew. It is incredibly smooth and balanced. Very easy drinking with its light body. Smell is fantastic. Color is a nice golden hue. Fantastic beer."

"Love the rye in this.  Pours a golden hue, hazy, dissipating head. Get a very grainy, malty, rye nose with the predominant hop profile of nelson.  Flavor follows suit.  Malty, rye with great hop flavor.  Not lingering, not overly bitter.  Quintessential drinking ipa.  Wish I could get this every day."

"Possibly the best single IPA I've had. Delicious, tropical flavors with a tiny bit of spice from the rye. The pale malt really allows the hops to shine. So smooth and drinkable."

"O: After having this a few times, this is more than likely my favorite ""single"" IPA in the world. A wonderful exercise in balance flavor-wise when compared to most of its ""West Coast"" counterparts. Massive hop flavor and aroma without the hyper aggressive bitterness that characterizes the style. This is my ""Desert Island"" beer. Cheers Alpine!"

"Alpine has just started distributing their kegs and I have been lucky enough to be in LA and a frequent customer to the bars where they get Alpine's stuff. This Rye IPA has a very unique hazy and golden color, not typical of other Rye IPAs I've had (Hop Rod, Ruthless). The smell is on point, I can't think of a better nose to a beer that I've ever had (Pliny is up there though). This sets you up for an unbelievable palate pleaser. Very very drinkable (got me into some fun last night) and not something you can burn out on. If you can get your hands on this, it's an unforgettable beer. A top 5 IPA for sure."

"Paired with deviled eggs and microgreens this beer blew us all away. Did I say well balanced? Amazing nose full of nelson grapefruit and nice carbonated bite with a very unique slightly diesely oily overtaste. Hops are the star of the show here with just enough malt to smooth it out. One of my new favorites. We hope to go to the brewery soon and try it off the tap. *** Highly recommended"

"Purchased very fresh from alpine beer co. Pours a hazy orange color with some faint sediment. Looks like watered down orange juice. The smell is incredible. Beautiful representation of nelson and it's earthy, fruity, dank hop character. The taste is where the rye comes in subtly but enough and provides an incredible companion for the so iciness of nelson hops. Such a balanced easy drinking but full flavored brew. One of my favorites. Top 3"

"Hops redux. Tart, yet perfumed and delicate. So grapefruity it’s almost a sour. Maybe loses some of the more delicate NS notes, but also probably the fullest expression of the hop."
"A delicious and easy drinking showcase for the Nelson Sauvin hop. Fruity and hop forward with just enough malt to add a touch of sweetness and a little body. An excellent single hop IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. My favorite IPA to date. Beats HT all day long."
""
""
"Lacking an Alpine glass, I poured this one into a Deschutes teku. A slightly hazy liquid, orange-copper in color, topped with a finger of foamy white head; nice retention and lacing. In the nose, floral notes, some dank citrus, slightly composted rind, wet grass, some hints of toasted rye malt. The flavor was similar, oily citrus, with a zesty bitterness, grassy and floral, somewhat herbal, sweaty, some toasted rye bread, with a residual malt sweetness. Medium body, maybe even medium-full, but still retained a nice IPA crispness, which made it an easy drinker. Almost came off more like a DIPA than a regular IPA. Nice brew overall."
""
""
""
"Boldly spicy and hopped, just as it should be. It's a simple recipe w/ a fresh and small batch mentality, just as it should be. The rye is more of a perfect compliment but the Nelson is the star of the show, just as it should be. Stop by the small but mighty brewery when in SoCal, Scott is your man. I recommend tasting ALL the IPA's and and grabbing your favorite...OR ALL OF THEM! Great BBQ and music too."

"I had this new Alpine Nelson that was contract brewed at Greenflash on tap. Nelson was probably my favorite beer and I've written beergasm reviews of it but this new collaboration needs to be tweaked. The beer was exceptionally cloudy with a chewy mouthfeel. It lost it 'brightness' and extraordinary deliciousness. While the Nelson hops were there, if I had this beer for the first time, I wouldn't order it again :( I hope they fix it."

"O: After having the pleasure of trying so many delicious, wonderful IPA's in the past few weeks (Gandhi-Bot, PtE, PH, Jai Alai, Schlafly Tasmanian IPA, Sea Hag, Hopslam, etc, etc, etc.), Nelson definitely got my attention. Wonderful beer by Alpine. Glad to have acquired this since I failed at making it to the brewery when I was out in SD. Thanks again to Sebowski."

"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Surprisingly light yellow/orange color (thought it might be more cloudy & orange, based on smell). Relatively thin fluffy white head, which dissipated somewhat quickly. Lots of tiny bubbles, and good/sticky/even lacing throughout the quaff. On the nose, strong pine dominates over grapefruit/orange citrus notes. There is a distinct dankiness to the nose, which becomes all the more prominent upon first sip. As the beer settles and warms, the beer becomes more hoppy/piney/dank and less floral/citrusy on the palette, which is fine by me (that's how I like them, although a little more balance would be preferred here). Mouthfeel is full and coating. Alcohol burn is subdued until final points of the finish. All in all, I liked this very much. A very good example of West Coast style (reminds me a little of Sucks in that regard). Duet is better, but Nelson is a close second. Nice work, Alpine!"

"This beer looks stunning, like liquid sunshine in the glass. The nose is sumptuous with Sticky citrus notes of tangerine and grapefruit. The rye adds a dry backbone that is perfect complement to the juicy, tropical sweetness of the hops. This beer is perfectly integrated and balanced. As good as IPAs get. This is a treat."

"Edit: I have had this beer another two times since my review and all it did was prove how damn good this brew was and that my review is spot on. I've shared this beer with a few buddies and they agree that its a world class brew and in the top hoppy beers they have ever had. The general consensus was that it was too smooth and easy drinking (in a good way) and one could polish off 2 bottles before they knew it was done."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The beer has a light body with moderate carbonation, which is about right. Overall, the Nelson hops really shine in this beer. I love tropical fruit notes and limited bitterness in my IPAs, so I was a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The general theme of this beer is a hoppy grapefruit bomb with a gentle bready malt, light body, and fresh flavors throughout. Certainly one of the best IPAs I've had."
""
""
""
""
"This beer lived up to the hype. Just fantastic."
""
""
"i love this beer! A fantastic IPA, and probably the best rye beer I've had. Darn near perfect"
""
""
"Really enjoyed this one, as I did all the Alpine hop bombs we had that afternoon. Perhaps my favorite all-around IPA brewer in the USA. Compared to Duet, this one was lighter in color and had more pine and grapefruit as opposed to apricot. Both are world class, however. Thanks again Doopie. Recommended."

"Overall- Really good to great beer that owes a lot to its mix of subtlety and complexity. Lovely use of rye to create a malt bill which not only contrasts the fruitness of the hops but interacts with it. Pretty much a great beer. Definitely worth a try. Very accessible IPA."

"Happy to have tried this beer. Pour was nice and clean with a golden orange color. Smell was hop forward with some citrus orange and grapefruit. Taste was like the smell but lacking a little on the citrus flavors, nice and bitter with good carbonation. Mouthfeel was smooth but not something that left me craving more with each swig. After drinking this side by side with Duet, I felt like this was a bit lacking. All in all, great beer from Alpine and will likely try it again if I get the chance."

"Bottle in trade from a generous dude. Thanks! Pours a beautifully clear light golden color with big fluffy white two finger head. Massive aromatics coming from this, with grapefruits, sweet honey, flowers, more citrus, some creamy sweet wine like aroma as well. Not like anything I have smelled. Flavor begins with a light sweetness on the tongue, and explodes into raw hops, grassy, grapefruit, honey, melons. A nice bitter pine on the way down. The flavor has a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, with sweet honey and big juicy hops. So light on the palate, with medium high carbonation. Up there with the best of them, especially in the single IPA category."
""
"O: Again, huge thanks to drbenzo. He also sent me Duet and Pure Hoppiness. Of the 3, this is hands down my favorite. One of the best IPA's I've had. Since getting this bottle I have actively pursued more bottles. Outstanding. Seek this one out - you will not be let down."
"Overall: More or less a toss-up between this and Hill Farmstead Susan as my favorite American IPA. The aroma almost keeps me from drinking this beer so I can just keep smelling it. Almost."
""
""
""
"O: Nelson's not always my favorite hop, but this is really quite enjoyable. Wonderfully crafted IPA. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
"This beer is a very good example of a beer with Nelson S. hops. I generally am not a big fan of that hop but I fully enjoyed this brew."
""
""
"Pours pale straw colored gold, foamy head settles to a comfortable pillow of fluff on the surface, tight lacing. Nose is cantaloupe, grapefruit, passion fruit, and pineapple hoppy aromatics, more pine as this warms, with spicy caramel malt in the finish. Taste is light melon, grapefruit and heavy pine, strong bitterness with a softer finish, light caramel malts and rye spice. Bright palate, mouthfeel remains light, very drinkable."

"O: Man, Alpine can really make them, can't they? Had Duet last night which was amazing. This isn't QUITE as good. Very good, very different, just not quite as amazeballs. Not super bitter like duet but still has that big strength and complexity of hop flavors. Rye malt adds a further layer and stands out a bit. Great beer."

"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was traded fresh. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion-fruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of bright tropical/citrus hop notes with light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA! Fantastic balance and complexity of tropical and bright citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Very unique IPA. Bright yellow/gold body with a fizzy white head. Tropical fruit and freshly mown grass on the nose really pop. The taste is balanced with bitterness and sweetness with a little bitter bite and a light spice from the rye. The carb is great for the flavors and the mouthfeel is just slick enough without being oily. Really well made and a great highlight of Nelson Sauvin hops."

"Pours a hazy golden orange. Not much of a head for an IPA, settles into a light lacy cap. Aroma of tropical fruit; smells like a stick of juicy fruit gum with a hint of grassiness. Big fruit flavor up front on the palate. Finishes dry with a slight rye aftertaste. Medium bodied and slightly carbonated. Overall, an extremely well crafted IPA and one that ranks right up there with the best of them! Well done, Alpine!"
""
""
""
"Wow, this stuff went down like nothing. It was like drinking juice with some hops mixed in. Beautiful display of the Nelson hop and what it's capable of. Huge tropical fruit aromas and flavors make this sucker incredibly easy to drink. This is something you could crush just drinking outside on a hot day. Another staple in the already larger-than-life portfolio of West Coast IPAs."

"Relatively light bodied - great aromas of citrus, sugared grapefruit, lemon zest, tropical fruit. Not overly bitter, not heavy, and extremely fresh. One could conceivably drink this elixir in mass quantities in the hot sun. Peach, guava, papaya, lemon, tangerine - mucho tasty"
""
""
"Overall: Delicious Golden Rye IPA, I don't recall having many beers in this particular style but I am really enjoying the rye contribution to the high hoppiness quotient. Alpine makes some awesome IPAs and I'm glad to have had the chance to drink this beer! (4.5)"

"This was a fantastic beer. Perfect shimmering orange appearance with a nice couple of fingers of head. The smell erupted from the glass with tons of tropical fruit deliciousness. Mango, pineapple, citrus. Truly fantastic aroma. The taste followed the nose almost perfectly, perhaps I've found my new favorite hop. The balance was near perfect with just the right amount of lingering bitterness. Part of me wants to say that I'd have liked a bit less sweetness, but another part of me thinks this beer needs it! Overall the aroma was the winner for me with this one--will definitely seek it out again."
""
""

"O: Fantastic rye IPA with some nice complexity from the Sauvin hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh bottle, only 5 days old. At least that's what Alpine said when I bought it. Pours a cloudy pale gold with one finger white head. Aroma is super grassy, slightly piney with notes of citrus fruit. Flavors of citrus with just a hint of spicy rye. Medium body with ample carbonation. Crisp, clean finish. A smooth IPA, not too bitter."

"I wasn't floored at first look (depth of color underwhelming), but this beer had a great nose and nice silky texture. I marked it down for having a bitterness that lingered slightly too long on my tongue, but otherwise this was my favorite IPA tasted at Alpine (Nelson, Duet, Pure Hoppiness, 1910)."

"O - This is a top 5 IPA for me and one of my all-time favorites. Rye and Sauvin hops are two of my favorite ingredients and this beer uses them to create an amazing and dangerously sessionable IPA. Like all Alpine IPA's, this one is crisp and clean. I wish more breweries featured rye like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Not sure how to compare this with Keane Idea. I think Nelson has less noticeable alcohol, though the abv isn't all that different between the two. Can't really go wrong with either, and Nelson is a beer I would love to have available year-round."
""
"O: Overall, an excellent beer. Dont let the somewhat nasty look of it scare you off cause its delicious. Not one of my favorite IPAs, and not as good at Duet (which I had yesterday so my memory is fresh), but certainly unique and very good in its own right. I would drink this again in a heartbeat, and if it was local Id definitely buy it on a consistent basis, but its not something I will aggressively seek out via trade."

"Anyway, get dis thang. It dat good."
"22oz bomber. Pours a clear yellow with a dense bright white head. Excellent lacing. Unreal aroma of fresh nectarines, raw mango flesh, Thai mango and sticky rice. Taste is rich, earthy mango flesh, dank Columbus hops, earthy/chewy hops. Very earthy, squashy, rich mango throughout. Un-f*cken real. So good. 9/4/8/4/15=4.0"
""
"Overall: This beer has a wonderful scent of grapefruit and white wine. It has the trademark dank maltiness of an Alpine brew as well. The smoothness of this beer is wonderful. Easy drinking, rich flavors, wonderful aromas and hops to satisfy. This one is a winner."
"Thanks Alex! (LSUPT)"
""
""
""
""
"A very unique IPA. Those Nelson Sauvin hops are something else. Very good, but to be honest not as mind-blowing as I was expecting coming in. The aroma is definitely the strong suit, excellent."
""
""
""
"Pours a gorgeous orange-golden color that is impenetrable to light. Showcases an antique whit head that dissipates quickly. The nose is glorious. Juicy grapefruit to the hilt! Mouthfeel is wet and a little cottony toward the finish. A lot of grapefruit up front. The rye expresses itself in the middle, followed by distinct pine flavor. This is a magnificent beer. I can't believe how good this is. I'm not a rye fan, but this is phenomenal."
""

"I really wanted to guess Alpine on a hunch but never had, and both were wants in my book. Hell of a good start thanks to quirkzoo for a great start to this bif for me."

"This is a fantastic beer that does a great job showcasing the hops."
""
""

"This is a majorly hoppy and complex IPA. Nelson Sauvin hops taste amazing at this hopping rate. A must try if you get a chance."

""
""
""
"Light golden with a 3/4 moon of white foam atop and nice clarity. Smells like pineapple, sweet mangos, pine and a gobs of sweet malts. I like the nose, as I do with most Sauvin beers. Flavor is sweet and bitter with good bits of the character from the olfactory. I like the slight oxidation I get in Alpine's beers - nice woodiness. If this was in any other kind of beer, I'd be upset, but it is well played here. Medium bodied with sharp, tight carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer."
"Overall: IPAs aren't really my thing but this is a good beer."
"After have expo hoppy yesterday this guy is a more subdued second."
""
"O: I love this IPA. Complex, interesting, well put together, and balanced. One of the best I've ever had."

"o: awesome! i grew up stealing sips of rye whiskey from granddad and have had a love for rye ever since. this beer fills that need very well. so smooth and drinkable! can't get over how awesome this beer is. if you havent had it, you need to."
""
""
"O: I can see why this beer is coveted. Also, rye is a love/hate and I seem to find it a difficult task to find one I routinely enjoy so I think mixing rye and Nelson hops together takes balls. Alpine has big balls. Well done but a tad but overrated and hyped. Yeah, i said it."
""
""
"O- This was a very nice IPA, that is typical to the other Alpine's that I've had. Alpine definitely nails the balance between hops and malts in their IPAs and I love the malts that they use. I liked Duet a little bit more, but Nelson is very good too. I would definitely drink this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue for a bit. I've had this a few times, but I'm pretty sure this is my favorite Alpine beer so far."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoy this beer and I wish Alpine wouldn't be so fucking stingy with their disto of this."
"On tap poured into a long glass, unknown freshness. This was poured a hazy golden amber color with a smaller laced leading off white head. The smells are of oranges, citrus fruit, grapefruit and sweet malts. The feel is medium with a nice creamy carbonation. The taste is very balanced and good, lots of bitter hops, citrus fruit, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely glad to have made the trip out to this gem of a brewery. It's worth the trip."
""
""
""
"O- A pretty awesome IPA, great work with the hops from Alpine once again, it doesn't quite stand up there with Bad Boy or Pure Hoppiness, but it still rocks."
"O: Nelson is a more contemplative beer than Duet (I was lucky enough to get to try the back to back on separate nights), but I think it has a bit more to offer as well with a more complex hop aroma and flavor. I liked them both a lot, but I would pick Nelson if I could have just a beer or two."
"Overall: My first Alpine beer! Mellow bitterness with big flavor is the best way to summarize this beer. Really unique IPA that is both memorable and unique!"
"Clear golden orange with minimal head and almost no lacing. Nose has a really bright citrus quality, Nelson Sauvin is obviously prominent, tangerine, mango and perhaps a bit of white wine character I've always heard to be characteristic of the hop. A kiss of rye spice. Taste has more vibrant citrus qualities, mango, white wine, and again only a wee bit of rye, but just enough to be identifiable. Light body, lower medium carbonation and dries out super quick once the hops have made their appearance. An awesome Rye IPA - had this next to a FFF Rye'd the Lightning - two completely different rye beers, but each awesome in their own regard."
"O- Intriguing. Daring.... Not your typical IPA."
""
"Just a tinge different from most IPAs to set it apart. The rye aspect had me craving another sip repeatedly. Thanks kawilliams82!"
""
""
""
"Drinkability – I find this very drinkable, as the hops doesn’t overpower. Maybe a bit too much grapefruit for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although the beer has a lot of classic and intelligent characteristics that set it apart, the mild buttery taste gives the hoppy ale a rounded and rich taste while the winy hops give extra acidity with a somewhat twiggy taste. Likely considered flaws to some, the moderate tones of these properties give the beer more intrigue and seduction than they do deterrents."
"O: I love this beer. My favorite Alpine IPA to date. I really like the hops used in this beer. Highly recommended. Perfect for summer!"
""
""

"Poured from a bomber into a Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a very pale shade of gold with a solid two finger head. Smell on this is citrusy with a tad bit of onion. Otherwise it's a pretty crisp scent. The taste is similar. Citrus foreground with a fade into onion. I typically don't like that quality even a little, but the citrus helps out tremendously. The finish is clean and crisp. Minimal bitterness or aftertaste of any variety. Overall, another solid Alpine IPA."
"O - This is definitely a must try because this beer will not disappoint the IPA enthusiasts. It will definitely be a plus if you do like grapefruits."

"Before I even comment on the appearance of this beer, the aroma after opening the bottle was outstanding. Big tropical lush citrus with another note which jumped right to peppermint in my brain, but I can't really place aside from that association. Maybe some spicy and crisp. An IPA second only to masala mama in aroma. Appearance is average. Mildly cloudy orange color with a short white head that dissipates to a thin film. Very sparse lacing, almost none. Flavor is very tropical fruity as well. Lush and full, but does not quite live up to the world class aroma of this beer. There is a similar unique characteristic in the flavor which I cannot pinpoint, perhaps earthy, or maybe herbal, but not in an english way. Very balanced with a nice, but definitely not overwhelming, caramel quality. Mouthfeel is medium light and is lacking a bit of carbonation, but it is not so bad at all."
""
""
"Amazing IPA, aroma is only matched by the likes of Sculpin and Double Sunshine while the flavor is integrated well, a balance of hops and malt that's ideally drinkable. Alpine knocked it out of the park with this beer. A must try."

""

"(D)- Its been awhile since the IPA style has surprised or impressed me since the market is just flooded with them, but this one is quite excellent. A refreshing beer for a style that I have been bored with for awhile."

"O: This is a really great beer and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. I would like to have more than one of these at a sitting though I am not sure this is really sessionable. Definitely one I would like to have another time."

"If I had enough of these I would drink them non stop until the polarity of our planet switches, and the most foolish among us are hurled into space."

"Incredible aroma of fresh, juicy oranges emanates from my glass. Hops not far behind, but this is orange central. The citrus fruits carry over strongly into the taste and really help balance out the hoppiness. By far the best Single IPA I've tasted to date, and arguably the first one I've ever enjoyed enough to want more."
""
""
""
"Overall it's a solid easy to drink beer."

"This one is very interesting, and different than what I expect out of california IPAs. The addition of rye seems to make this a completely different beast. Not sure how I feel about the metallic flavor in the beginning."

"Crazy props to aekoops for the gift!!!"

"Stunningly brewed IPA that demonstrates how making an outstanding beer is not about more, nor about less, but about zeroing in on that elusive 'just-rightness'."
"another good hoppy offering from Alpine. good, but it doesn't redefine the style for me."

"This is a quality brew, for sure, but for the effort, I will take the more hop forward offerings from Alpine."

"O- Good IPA but not getting that vibrant citrus notes that I saw from a few other reviews. Never read reviews before I do my own, but was told that this beer could be off so wanted to see what I should expect."
"Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very flavorful and clean finishing ipa. It has a wonderful array of flavors and the hop bitterness is definitely there but not overpowering. I would recommend you try this if you can get your hands on a bottle!"
""
"Overall: Another fantastic IPA coming from Alpine. Definitely in my category of go to beers. The rye adds a nice spicyness and the Nelson hops add a citrus/lemony bite. Very crisp and refreshing and recommended to all."
"D - Wonderfully creative. The balance the rye imparts with the distinct New Zealand hops makes this an easy standout for me. Reflecting on this brew a bit further, I realize that this is a pinnacle of differentiation in a style chock-full of generalized aromas and flavors. I've been drinking a ton of APA/IPA/DIPA's lately, and nothing has stood out as much as this one."

"My first from Alpine. Duet is in the fridge and Exponential Hoppiness is on the way! Thanks to nogidrew63 for the trade on this one."
"this is really one hell of an IPA. very unique and an absolute must try for any hop head. insanely strong hop flavors with a very approachable bitterness. i hate to say this, but i think id even take this over pliny. i really cant wait to get into the rest of these alpine IPAs. the beer is gone, but my burps still taste like awesome nelson hops!"

"O - This is the most unique IPA I've ever had. Really like the white wine characteristics from the Nelson Sauvin hops. Another solid IPA from ABC."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly phenomenal beer. Preferred it slightly on tap, with its lower carbonation and fuller mouthfeel, but you can’t lose with this one. As good as anything made in this style without a doubt. Had a hard time not guzzling this one down like a racehorse."
""
"Cost: $7.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."

"Picked up a couple cases of various IPA 's at Alpine on Friday including a bunch of Nelson. This beer is a golden with a beautiful dense one inch cap that has amazing retention and leaves behind serious lacing as I sip down. The nose, like all Alpine brews is a work of art. Sweet tropical fruit, Nelson Sauvign hops and malty biscuit round out the package. The flavor profile follows the nose down the road, gorgeous rye, pine, sweet dank hoppiness all balanced by a minimal malt backbone. I cannot say enough about the uniqueness of this work of art, it is simply one of the best IPA's I have ever had, and Alpine may be the little giant that continues to craft ultra uber cult status beers according to their own rules."
""
""
""
"I've been waiting for months to try an Alpine Brewing IPA, and I am not disappointed. I was worried when I saw that the only one left on the shelf was a Rye IPA, but Alpine really balanced the rye flavors well. A bit tangy due to the rye and hop oil, it was surprisingly smooth. I drank the bomber by myself and only noticed the acidity halfway through. It was never a problem though, more of an enduring characteristic. I would love to try this on tap!"
""
"Overall this is easily one of the top 5 IPAs I've ever had (and I've had many), and now one of my personal favorite beers in general. If I had to choose only one beer to drink for the rest of my life, Alpine Nelson would be seriously considered. There is just simply not much negative to say about this beer (except I can't easily get it). I love the delicate, yet complex hop profile, that plays so beautifully with the Rye addition. Recommended to all, every BA should try this beer. Cheers!"

"(O) Solid golden IPA. Has a good amount of flavor that is well balanced in sweetness and bitterness. Has a cooling crispness about it that is quite refreshing. It's not like a lot of IPAs that I've had in the past few months."

"Verdict: Superb IPA from Alpine, I feel like I've said that a few times, but they make some seriously hoppy goodness down there in Alpine. This is one to stock up on."
""
""
"deep amber, almost bronze/brass, with a slight haze. white head that leaves a bit of lace. nose is nelson for sure... fruits like grape, pear and melon mix with grapefruit, citrus and grass while playing with sweet, spicy rye and blending with a slight caramelly undertone. taste follows suit while evoking memory of ""dank"". not cellar dank... cali dank. hate to be cliche, but the juicy goodness in here is really reminding me of mj. the taste is well-balanced, and flavors pop out and shine for a second, then go back and blend while something else pops up. not muddy, just full of nelson. at times i'm also definitely reminded of why this hop is called nelson sauvin. lovely. medium body with no bad aftertastes. gripping bitterness that opens up the palate to the rye and other sharp flavors that are toying with the juicy, fatty flavors of fruit. overall, another very fine beer from alpine with a very, very fine name!"

"Overall it's impressive but I don't think I am a big fan of this one. It's very good but I would probably choose something else, this seems a little excessive and all over."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I really really like this beer. Tons of super fresh hops and great smell. Alpine hit a home run with this beer. Really glad I got to try this one and will be looking for more at any chance. 4.5"

"O: A very good IPA, will definitely be having again, hopefully on tap during my visit."

"O-This is an utterly fantastic beer, and as stoked as I was to have found it, I was still blown away. My only real complaint is that I know I won't find it next time I look for it, and the drive down south will surely become more and more tempting as time goes by. If I was able to drink it on a more regular basis it would be fast favorite."
"Would and could drink this all day!"
""

"O- Good beer here. Nice juicy, hop flavors with a nice rye mix to it. Smooth drink, something you could drink a few of these pretty easily. Would love to have another one. Thanks Scott!"

"O. I really enjoy this, I feel as if this bottle is slightly off from normal though and missing some of its ""pop"" will re-review shortly."
""
""

""
""
"Any way you look at it, this beer has an outstandingly good hop profile that just perfectly fits my palate. I'm confident I could identify this beer correctly out of a line up of 10 top IPAs everytime. Alpine makes some damn fine IPAs and this one's my favorite."

"Great use of late hop additions to get a West Coast profile to be reckoned with. Not over the top, smooth tropical citrus IPA."
"Oustanding zesty citrus flavor with pale malt, some bold rye, and tropical fruit flavors. This is probably my favorite IPA of all time. If it were available here, I'd drink it nonstop."
"Pours a beautiful light, clear, gold color w/ a one finger white head. Very clean and clear in appearance. Some of the best lacing I've seen on any beer.. period... I got grapefruit, citrus, pine, hops and pineapple on this one. Very balanced all around, and one of the nicest IPA's I've had the pleasure of trying. Taste is out of this world, w/ rye, floral tastes, and malt being added to the nose profile. Super smooth and balanced. Feel is super smooth and satisfying- w/ a hops/rye aftertaste. Overall, this is one of the best IPA's I've ever tried. I'd drive hours to get this if I could- Highly recommended! Cheers."
"All I drink is IPA's, and it's been a long time since I had a mind blowing one, and I've tried a lot of the great name CA brews. This one is beyond sensational, the nose is fruity, not quite as sharp as grapefruit, and the taste follows. Fruity, kinds peachy, a little sharp like sucking on the peach pit, is the best I can relate to. You think this would be a typical CA IPA, but it's not... it's so much better. Definitely not sweet, well balanced, but still very bold, a little xtra malt, drinks like a DIPA. . Must be the different hops is all I can add. As good an IPA as I've ever had, and I have tried most of the higher rated ones. You have to give this one a try, i can't believe it hasn't had it's own thread yet."
"Great stuff, definitely my favorite from Alpine so far."
"O - Overall a very well done beer. One I would definitely drink regularly if I had access to it!"
"All I can say is I highly recommend this. Next time I travel to Alpine I hope all the stores won't be sold out again, but now I understand why..."
"This is probably the best IPA I've sampled so far from Alpine. I really enjoyed the citrus aspects of the beer coupled with some pine elements. The rye was a unique addition that didn't overwhelm the flavor profile but gave a nice balance in the malts. Nicely done."
"O: Wish I could find this one all the time. This would be my go-to staple beer. Don't think I could ever tire of this one."
"Overall: I do like this beer, while it might not be an every day beer for me, If I had access I'd return to it for sure."
"Pours a bright yellowish, orange, with an amazing thick, bright white 2 finger head. As the head pulls back into the beer a thick ring of lace is left all over the sides of the glass. Smell notes of piney hops, tropical fruits, and a slight hint of malt. A mellow bitterness from the hops jumps out with each drink and is well balanced with a crisp malt flavor profile. A great piney linger is left on the pallet with each drink that makes you want to hurry back for more. This beer is an easy drinker with a great finish. Carbonation is spot on. This is a great example of how an IPA should be brewed. Every Alpine offering I have had the pleasure of drinking has left me disappointed because I don't know when I'll be able to drink my next. Great brew Alpine!"
"An elite IPA that needs to be smelled to be believed. Duet and Pure Hoppiness are solid IPAs from Alpine; Nelson is a step above."
"Excellent beer, can’t wait to get a hold of another."
"O:This is a great beer. Has all the characteristics of a great IPA and incredible smell and taste. This one moves into my top 5/10."
"O: Interesting, tasty... Glad I had one!"
"Overall: Super complex and very good. I would drink this all night long if I had more."
"Overall a very nice rye that's very different than any other I've had. All around a very nice beer and extremely easy to drink. A must find."
"D: When first cracked open, it smelled amazing. While it didn't live up to my lofty initial expectations, it was definitely a solid IPA. I would drink this beer often if it was available in my area. [Grapefruit reminded me at first of fresh Finestkind, but then I got more of the juicy fruit character you get from Nelson Sauvin . Rye also added a little something extra to set it apart from most other IPA's.]"
"A nice beer. Good to see the Nelson and rye together; interesting"
"O: This is a great beer and far better than I remember it being (and I love Alpines products for the most part). It's one of the more complex IPA's ever produced however it needs love and care in order to be fully appreciated. The subtle, yet highly complex flavors of Nelson take time to develop, and do work together harmoniously. Props. Nelson is rad. Grab it Fresh as hell and drink the mother warm."
"It pours a light tinged gold in color, light in body, with a one finger frothy white head. It smells of clean grapefruit, pineapple, light soap, with a light citrus finish. It's really nice. The flavors are a combination of clean piny hops, soap, light citrus, and it has a light yet bitter finish. Still very solid. It drinks very light and smooth and has nice flavors that're both appealing and easy to come back to. This is a very approachable IPA. I'd put this in the Blind Pig ballpark. It's a nice IPA and I'm glad I could try it."
"Cheers!"
"Pour from a bottle gave a golden color with a nice white head. Earthy, fresh hops in the nose. Medium bodied with upfront clean natural bitter NZ hops.Refreshing beer with the alcohol pretty well hidden. Long finish really accentuates the unique flavor profile. Awesome."
"Thanks again to a buddy for sharing this with me. Pours a golden orange colour into a snifter glass. I could really pick up grapefruit in the smell. The taste followed suit as a intense grapefruit like flavour followed with each sip. Good bitterness and a nice malty backbone. Very nice beer."
"Overall this one isn't quite living up to its top 100 status, in my opinion. I'd take a Union Jack, Torpedo, or Stone IPA over this, no-brainer. Hop flavor/bitterness lacks variety and pungency. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just not as good as it could be."
"D: When first cracked open, it smelled amazing. While it didn't live up to my lofty initial expectations, it was definitely a solid IPA. I would drink this beer often if it was available in my area"
"Pours a yellowish-golden color with a nice whitish head. The nose is intoxicating. A light pine is lifted by a delightful citrus array of grapefruit and orange. Wow. Delicious (I rarely give 5's for any category). The taste is really good as well. A light spicy bitterness, grassy with just a touch of pine and citrus. It brings the wood like the nose. Yum. The mouthfeel is medium with a medium light carbonation. I always have felt that I like Duet better, but this fresh batch of Nelson is fantastic. [EDIT: Had this beer like a million times since and this is one of my favorite all time beers]"
"Overall I must say how much I enjoyed this. Another Alpine brew that is hit out of the ball park. Thanks to Jeff for picking this one up for me on his last trip to San Diego."
"Overall it's very delightful. I would definitely buy it again."
"O- Amazing beer, one of the best IPA's out there."
"Has great potential for a desert island beer."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Hazy orange with a good white head. Aroma is floral hops with a lot of citrus fruits especially orange and grape fruit. The flavor is an explosion of hops but in great balance, not as sweet as the aroma seemed. Orange and grape fruit, maybe apple, peach. So nicely balanced, this is a stellar IPA and I always seek this out when they put out a new batch."
"O- Just wow. Much better than Pure Hoppiness. I want more nelson sauvin hops in my beers..."
"Overall, this is a most excellent example of a double IPA done right. Unfortunately for me, its not readily available in my area, so feel blessed if it sits on your beer station's shelves."
"O- Excellent beer."
"Really a beautiful beer. Sometimes I feel I've reached a point where even the best Double IPAs taste repetitious. This one was refreshing - in more ways than one."
"O: What can I say. Some of my favorite IPAs come from Alpine. I could drink this all day."
"-Cheers"
"Overall, this is a great second or third beer that will cleanse your palate for what's next."
"Find it, trade for it, try it, you won't be sorry. Excellence in a bottle. Thanks Alpine!"
"O - Overall, this is another great one from Alpine. Consistently making some of the best IPAs around."
"O- Alpine is one of my favorite breweries and Nelson is probably my favorite offering from them. This is a superb IPA and if you can find it, buy it. You will not be disappointed."
"Taste follows nose: grapefruit, pineapple. This is a citrus bomb if I've ever had one. Simply delicious. And deliciously simple. Great, succulent mouthfeel too with a nice crisp finish."
"Overall - It's just such a perfectly executed beer without the flavors I'm looking for. It's tough to rate, because it manages to make me enjoy flavors I don't normally enjoy. Well done, Alpine."
"O - Great beer. Pretty easy to get in a trade, so it ranks very highly. Love the taste, look and smell of this beer."
"Cheers..."
"More than fine, just not exceptional. Ultimately, I'd call it a little dull."
"O: Another amazing brew from Alpine. Thinks this beats the Duet out as my personal favorite currently. Can't wait for the Expo."
"Well I am happy to finally have some Alpine, I really want some more!"
"Nice light body with good carbonation. A little bit sticky somehow. Overall pretty tasty here. Pretty malty for an IPA but ths is darn good."
"This is a great exam­ple of what a bal­anced rye beer should be. The brew­ers cer­tainly choose the best hops to com­pli­ment the rye used in the grain bill. The com­plex­ity of the beer would make this a dif­fi­cult beer for a new comer to the beer scene. If you are ever in the San Diego area, do your­self a favor and look these guys up! Prost!"
"Yet another great one from Alpine. No question in my mind that they make the world's best IPAs overall (nevermind that I haven't had all the IPAs in the world.)"
"I was definitely expecting more. I'm starting to wonder if this is an old bottle, which I would be very upset with the store I bought this from yesterday. I will most definitely revisit this beer and hopefully be able to come back in and change the scores a little bit. I have an insane amount of respect for Alpine and the things they do."
"Great little IPA, taste is very fruit forward. My first beer from Alpine, I can see why they're so highly regarded."
"O- Solid IPA, out of all the IPAs and DIPAs from Alpine that I’ve tasted I would have to say this is my least favorite, still enjoyable though and a quality beer."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is excellent from start to end and is quite unique. The beer is quite hoppy, but does not go too overboard."
"O - This is a pretty enjoyable beer I'm not all that into rye but this was still a pretty good tasting beer that's going down easily if your into rye IPAs this is a beer that's worth checking out"
"O- A very interesting IPA. Not to familiar with Nelson Sauvin hops, but added some nice white wine qualities as well as the rye adding some peppery spice. I much prefer Duet and Pure Hoppiness over Nelson, that onion/garlic taste really got to me."
"By far the best of the (albeit limited) beers I've had with this hop. Everything from Alpine is solid."
"O: There's just no excuse for not trying this beer if you like IPAs. I've been somewhat spoiled and had the chance to try quite a few at this point, and some of the hailed greats, but Nelson easily takes its position among the best of the best. Every time I try to criticize this beer I feel the heaviness of contriving faults. Get it, try it, and then get some more."
"O: I have had this beer before out of a bottle, but this time it really just seemed so fantastic. I think the last time I had it might have been dampened by the fact that I had just been amazed by a first tasting of Duet. This beer is a stand alone juggernaut; a sensational rye IPA flavor experience. I dare you to name a better Rye IPA; as I can't. The freshness exemplified by all the different elements of this beer are just sensational. This is a theme park for the mouth; I am born anew."
"O (D) - very nice IPA, would love to try this again."
"O: It honestly doesn't get much better than this for an IPA, and I wish I lived in San Diego so I could have this on a regular basis. Instead I'll have to be satisfied with enjoying it when I can. This beer is awesome."
"Pours a light straw gold, not much head or lacing to speak of. Smell has a nice citrus (grapefruit mostly) and pine balance, spice, a lot of honey and malt, kind of grainy. Really interesting and unique smelling. Tastes similar, with grapefruit and spice/grain up front, pine, and again kind of a honey and malt sweetness. Not as much of a hop bomb as I was expecting. Medium-full body and medium level of carbonation, kind of grainy mouthfeel. Overall, a super interesting and well crafted IPA."
"O- this is a good one. Real easy drinking for my first Alpine beer"
"O: Really nice nose, pretty nice flavor, below average on the mouthfeel. But all in all not bad. I would really like to try this super fresh, as I think it would be supurb. But, have to rate what's in front of me. Skal."
"I should have bought more."
"O: This is now one of my favorite IPAs, this is an IPA for a non IPA fan."
"A uniquely perfect IPA."
"My first experience with Alpine, and happy to be introduced. Have heard of the quality beers they produce, and this golden IPA did not disappoint. Can't wait to head back down to SoCal and try a few more!"
"Notes - What a surprise of a beer. This beer was a shock right off the bat and continued to please till the very last drop. I cant imagine how good this would be on tap but out of the bottle this was an experience."
"o - Overall a fantastic IPA; another winner from Alpine. Really liking this one, and very glad I have another bottle of it. Well worth the wait."
"I LOVE this IPA."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light copper color with a coastered white head. Nice fruit aroma mostly dominated by grapefruit. Medium mouhfeel. Nice malty backbone with a hoppy forward grapefruit rind notes. Bittenrss lingers. Nicely drinking. No alcohol notes found."
"Overall, this is a very good IPA with the mouthfeel the only drawback for me, but I would love to be able to drink this beer more often."
"Snoogens!"
"Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"O: Delicious IPA, not world class but great none the less, quite refreshing and drinkability is high. Well balanced, plenty of hops but not so hoppy that the malt flavors are completely hidden."
"The NZ hops give a white wine quality to the flavor and nose, with the rye giving a nice tangy bitterness. These flavors blend and melt well into the more traditional flowery notes from the other hops. Combined, I get some great spice notes. Clove?"
"Overall this is not a bad beer, but it not great either. Expected more citrus than what was delivered. I would drink it again and reccommend that others try it as well. Slightly above average."
"A very proper looking IPA. Nice white puffy head which leaves a trail of tight belgian lace behind it. Hazy and opaque but a nice golden orange color. Such a fruity aroma, big grapefruit and citrus fruit. Sticky and hoppy, could pop a bit more. The flavor is clean and pure west coast IPA. Big fruit notes, grapefruit, melon, citrus, really great. I'm missing a little complexity from multiple strains of hops, I think? The rye is a nice touch, faintly spicy. But where the rye shines is helping create a dry clean finish. Nice, alot of IPAs have a bit of a cloying finish from the hops, but not this one! An IPA of the highest order."
"O-Amazing IPA one of my favorites , the tangerines and tropical fruit are super enjoyable. the bitterness is light and the flavors go together very well."
"O - Another winner from Alpine, which I believe is now my fave brewery. If you are looking to enjoy high quality IPA's and DIPA's, this is the brewery to try."
"O- An excellent and interesting beer that I highly recommend. Very drinkable"
"D/O: At the first glance, Alpine's beer line-up may seem needlessly crowded with IPAs. A careful exploration of each will allow the taster to appreciate just how much variability is possible within the style: O'Brien's delivers the greatest balance, fulfilling the role of general-purpose IPA that does not disappoint; Duet is a showcase of Simcoe qualities (and a great substitute for Sculpin); and Nelson is the grapefruit bomb of the three. As advertised, it delivers grapefruit that is laser-focused and juicy, with an intensity that even challenges grapefruit-focused DIPAs such as Russian River's Pliny the Elder. If any criticism is required, its qualities have an obsessive simplicity about them--but after all, Nelson is a specialist whose companion brews pick up the slack nicely."
"Big thanks to Metallitone1, this was super fresh! I split this with a friend and it was entertaining. Orange color, not quite perfectly clear but maybe it was hazed from being too cold at first. I could barely taste the rye but the hops were certainly quite pungent and tasty and bitter! It had a real full feel to it, robust hoppiness. We drank a Duet right after and Nelson was much more interesting. Overall this was a good IPA but I'm not surprised given the source."
"This is my first experience with Nelson Sauvin hops and all-in-all I'm fairly impressed. There's really a lot going on with this beer and although the appearance is the same as any number of other IPAs the taste and aroma is where this beer really shines. It's also interesting to see how the flavors change as it warms. I'm really glad I got the chance to try this and would definitely love to have again."
"O- Another winner from Alpine. This brewery has a masterful handle on any hoppy style of beer."
"o - overall very good. all about the nose on this one...really smells fantastic. beyond that, a solid IPA."
"O- Good, but not as good as Pure Hoppiness."
"Pours a murky yellowish orange. Lots of white frothy head. Smells incredibly hoppy. Tons of grapefruit and a touch of pine on the nose. Smells great! Tastes great. Bitter hops and grapefruit on the tongue as well. The malts are very subtle in the background. Nicely carbonated. Overall a very tasty beer. Probably my favorite alpine beer!"
"Overall I must say that beers wins out massively in every category that matters to me. Nelson is not a hop-bomb IPA, but a delicately complex and deliciously balanced one. Seek this one out."
"O: I love this brew. Drinks very good & is a great change of pace for west coast IPAs."
"My first beer from Alpine. I look forward to trying the rest of their lineup."
"O: This is up there as one of the best IPA's I have had to date. An excellent example of the American style with a slight twist, seek this one out."
"This and Sculpin might be my favorite IPAs. Awesome aroma and flavor. Very fresh/pungent, hops. just like an IPA should be. I'll need to try another Sculpin here very soon as my palate have definitely changed since getting into beer hardcore recently. Unfortunately this is a west coast beer but luckily I have connections to grab it."
"It's certainly serendipitous that I drank this the day after I had Oskar Blues GUBNA. This IPA is exactly what that beer isn't. It's a successful display of how well a strong malt and bitter hop pair with the sweet pucker of citrus fruit."
"O - Didn't like it. Sorry guys, I feel like this one is WAY over rated."
"This is a great beer. If I could find this beer more locally, it would be a regular for me!"
"O - Again, a very unique beer, the Nelson hops bring so much to the party. I'd love to try this again, and will actively seek it out."
"O- The first time I noticed the funky plastic smell and taste it was so faint I wasn't even put off enough to stop drinking. After a few more sips I did realize it was rye, but I still couldn't shake the association. Even so this was a really nice IPA even if it was a tad light in body."
"D-Overall this is a great ipa. I have found alot of ipas to just be hoppy and not have much flavor or other things going on in them But this one has a well balanced citrus and honey flavor. Thats not too sweet or citrusy that its almost not an IPA but gives just enough to the hops to make this beer memorable. Will get this again."
"Thanks to hurfer for the assist!"
"Wow what a great beer, pours two fingers of head and almost comes out with a mercury metallic hue when pouring, settles to a caramel orange in the glass. Nose is just full of citrus and tropical fruits and white wine with a touch of piney hops. Taste is a complex blend of candied citrus rind, bitter papaya, orange mango juice and some dark rye bread with a touch of sauv blanc notes at the end with the requisite ipa finish. Sculpin might have been dethroned in my book gorgeous beer."
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a nice 2 inch stark white head that fades to a small cap. The head is very cloudy and puffy on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of citrus zest hops, pine tree, and some spiciness from the rye. Tastes of spicy rye, malt, and citrus zest/pine hops, but overall the beer has a muted taste in my opinion. Beer is slightly carbonated and seems a bit flat. Smooth but creamy in the mouth. I would have liked to have more carbonation for the style. Overall, this is a good beer from Alpine but I prefer a few of their other beers over this."
"Big thanks goes out to Sixofsigmas for sending me this one as an extra in a trade a long time back. I just found it sitting in the back of the fridge! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a massively fluffy four finger off-white head that subside to one finger stupidly slow. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, orange, citrus hop, and pot. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine resin, citrus, orange zest, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew completely wowed me. There is really a lot going right for this one overall. One thing to note is the head on this one. HOLY CRAP! It basically formed a pillow over the beer and was borderline solid. You could actually take a bite of it and chew it. It remained this way throughout the entire glass which was awesome. If you noticed that I mentioned getting pot in the aroma, well usually this is out of place, but it seemed to work great with the other aromas going on in this one. The flavor itself was very complex and extremely well balanced. Very nice feel on the palate as well. I would honestly have to say that this might be the best American IPA I have yet to have. Really nice job on this one Alpine!"
"The body on this ipa is pushing full, it is a little on the heavier side of medium bodied and is met with a modest amount of carbonation that keeps the bubbles lively inside the mouth and prickly on the tongue. The abv is present with a light fruited aspect but really brings in a solid amount of warmth down the back of the throat for 7%. All in all a very solid, enjoyable brew. Certainly worth checking out. Thanks again Brett for the trade!"
"Drink and overall: Great beer. It really is. Can't argue there. Good hop character, complex body. Awesome."
"EDIT: Scored more of this, damn, this beer is so funky fresh. Excellent, maybe my favorite IPA."
"O - Overall this is a great beer that i would love to enjoy on a frequent basis. This is the second beer i have tried from Alpine, and i im glad i did, cause i really didn't understand Duet. Great job Alpine."
"D-excellent IPA, the tangerines and tropical fruit flavors are so bright and enjoyable. the bitterness is rather light and the flavors go together pretty well."
"T: Some fresh grapefruit hop flavor upfront. Before the hops can get too bitter, the malts come in and smooth it out. The malts don't have a ton of flavor on their own, but they allow the hop flavor to ride over them without letting any bitterness over them. There's no ""pop"" to the hops, but this beer just works. Another great one from Alpine."
"Thanks, Martin for the diligence."
"Drinkability is great. No alcohol harshness or extreme tongue buckling bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel that is enhanced by the incredibly smooth taste. An almost perfect double IPA."
"Light bodied, well carbonated with enough small bubbles to scrub your tongue clean without too much irritation. Very easy to drink beer, and a very unique flavor."
"Thanks to Grapehops for the extra! Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into a pint glass. Pours hazy gold, medium to thin off-white head, pretty lacing. Nose is soft, fleshy stonefruit and papaya, lush and fruity, with both fresh and dried pineapple here as well. Flavors are soft and fruity, but deceptively bitter. Pineapple and guava in the mouth, as well as a pervasive nutty earthiness from the rye. Mostly upfront palate, but some ""white wine"" acidity on the finish with caraway again on the long finish. Quite a complex beer but was not my style among my favorite IPAs. Overhyped IMO, so I am going against the tide on this one."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very smooth and creamy. Spot on for an IPA, pretty much what I am looking for. Alpine continues to impress."
"the CPJ"
"Interesting IPA that's lighter in body."
"D- Insanely drinkable, especially for 7% ABV. This is probably my favorite beer ever. I honestly cannot even imagine how this could be improved upon in any way."
"Overall this is freakin' awesome, my favorite Rye IPA and top 2 overall Rye beers I have ever had (The Bruery Rugbrod being the other). Some breweries totally botch rye and add too much where it is unpleasant or too little, but this is spot on. Highly recommended; I'm going to have to ship more of this from the West Coast. Wow top notch indeed."
"Drink- I like me some Alpine. All of them have been very good. I could sip on this one for a long time. I swear I need to learn to buy more than 1 bottle of something."
"Enjoy it with no moderation."
"Alpine Nelso was provided to me via trade courtesy of tbase. This is a really interesting IPA! The Nelson Sauvin hops used in the brewing of this beer really adds a fresh vinous, fruity aspect to this otherwise solid IPA. Without the interesting hops I think this a pretty typical IPA, in fact it reminds a lot of hill farmstead citra which I thought was pretty good but Nelson really has it going on. The bitterness in this beer is slightly subdued but i like that because it helps you really taste and smell the Nelson Sauvin. The rye also contributes a nice earthy spiciness helps keep the beer grounded. If possible get a hold of this beer, even if you have to pay ridiculous shipping for it. It's worth it!"
"Not a straight up 1 dimensional hop head brew, which is probably why I like it."
"M - Medium body, oily, chewy. Lightly carbonated."
"This beer popes a hazy light orange/yellow. It smells amazing. The blend of hops and grapefruit is captivating. I dig it big time. It tastes similar to the aroma. Big hops with sweet fruit flavors and a bitter aftertaste. Verk drinkable and considerably better on tap vs bottle. Out of the bottle it has a lot of malt flavor and less citrus and hops. Very enjoyable either way."
"Drinkability is really good. Finished the bomber rather easy, really unique beer. Never heard of this beer or brewery up until acouple months ago but its easily one of the best Ipa's I've had."
"Love this beer so much i've been getting shipments from an SD area friend. always UNBELIEVABLY good, one of my top 3 faves all-time. I hear the brewery has a taproom next door with great BBQ, i'm making a special pilgrimage from NJ soon just to experience it. urge you all to buy, trade, beg borrow or steal this beer...you'll LOVE it!"
"This feels like a refined and mature IPA. There is a solid malt foundation supporting the hops, and adding rye to an IPA is a brilliant idea. It smells similar to a double IPA, a lot of malt and some spiciness. This beer does not smell as hoppy as I initially assumed, the bitterness is there but not overdone. Once it hits your tongue, youre not bombarded with bitterness. It's a big beer and balanced well. Plenty of carbonation and a nice finish. Also, if you live in San Diego, it's not that expensive."
"drinkability is good - those big spicy flavors hold me back from giving this a higher rating - i am glad i split this because i would have felt really bad if i could no have finished the whole 22oz of this incredible beer"
"This is the first time I've had this from a bottle. Have had on tap several times, and don't remember being this impressed..."
"Drinkability: Oh hell yeah! The light body and delicate balance make this IPA extremely sessionable. No palate-wrecking here. Delightfully complex and suitable for any craft beer lover. Nelson is a truly beautiful IPA."
"I have seen other Ba's talk about this beer, and comment that it was way better than big hyped IPAs like PTE. I really have to agree. This may be one of the best regular IPAs I have had in my 10 yrs of craft beer drinking."
"Drinkable although a little odd, I would much rather have pure hoppiness or sculpin but I'm glad I had the oppurtunity to try this one. Thanks again Rich."
"The brew's flavor profile is surprising, especially if you were expecting the clean, citrusy profile of a standard IPA. The rye changes the entire complexion of the ale, but once you get used to the rich and almost exotic tropical notes, the beer is completely delicious and quaffs easily. By far the best rye IPA I've had."
"Nelson is pretty interesting. Pairing Nelson hops with rye really expresses the characteristics of malted rye, and also makes for a unique IPA. I like it, but I don't love it. Even so, I understand how others might love this one."
"Overall - I love me some Alpine and am a huge fan of Nelson Sauvin hops. Can't think of a better combination. Had a pour on draft last year that had much more rye spiciness, but I'm certainly not complaining. This is absolutely fantastic. Thanks to Tieman for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel was decent with mild to medium carbonation."
"Pours a nice slighlty hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, HUGE thick creamy/foamy white head, with lots of thick creamy/foamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with a nice touch of malts, citrusy, with some slight pine notes. The taste is sweet, hoppy, malty, with some citrus/pine notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty IPA. Glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Finish has a tart bitter character to it, along with bitter black coffee and burnt toast and is long lasting. Nice rye character through and through."
"D: With the low malts, this one is a very easy drinker, though, for me, the sweetness is a bit much."
"The mouthfeel is amazing. Super smooth, full, and a dry not not too dry finish."
"Now if only it weren't named Nelson because of the hops, but after the Simpsons character. Hah haaah."
"pours from the bomber a hazy yellow/peach color with a small head and spotty lacing some clinging to side of glass...smell is citrus mainly grapefruit /and oranges..a sweet malt smell is there with a slight rye spice smell,,taste is grapefruit hops up with other citrus taste i get a candy sweet hop resin all on the citrus side..its followed by sweet caramel baked bread taste with some rye spices..the best rye ipa i ever had..mouthfeel is just right in carbonation full of flavor hops and malts..high drinkability this is the 3rd alpine beer ive had they are all outstanding ..this one is no exception highly recommended"
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefruit and orange citrus hops. In the taste, dry small citrus hops, dry small fruit notes, and a nice dry malt with a hint of rye. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry rye and hop aftertaste. Nice rye and big hops, simply remarkable."
"Drinkability is excellent. Very great hoppy ipa, very complex, yet easy and very pleasant to drink."
"Overall another winner by Alpine. Boy these beers rock. So damn fruity and easy drinking it should be a crime. Great job Alpine, come to PA please."
"D: Very good refreshing beer thats very good. Would definitely be in my rotation if I could buy it regularly. Will look to get this, and other alpine hop beers again."
"-not a great one for me. my least favorite of the alpine IPA's. i warmed up to it a bit as i got towards the bottom of the glass, but i still wouldnt want to order more. i am usually a big fan of ryePA's too"
"Nelson pours a murky tangerine. it's completely opaque, and not a particularly pleasant hue. The vigorous initial pour yields a creamy bone colored cap of about two fingers in height. Head retention is decent, but lacing is a little underwhelming. The nose is delicious, and pungent as all hell. It's a massive grapefruit bomb, with a subtle white wine presence in the background. One of the best smelling beers I've had in a while. The flavor manages to improve the beer still. A faint suggestion of bready malts kicks things off, before an exceptionally smooth wave of bitterness rolls into town. The end is a perfect blend of grapefruit rind, white wine (maybe chardonnay), and some spice from the rye. The combination of the unusual Nelson Sauvin hops and some rye in the grain bill has resulted in one of the most unique, and flavorful IPAs I've ever had. The body is surprisingly full for a beer that's as restrained on malty flavors as Nelson is. There's also a certain smoothness that I don't always find in the style. Unfortunately, the carbonation is a little bit lacking/dull, and this leads to the beer starting to hint at a syrupy mouthfeel. As much as I love the flavor of this beer, the lack of carbonation keeps jumping out at me and keeps Nelson from being as quaffable as it could be. All in all though, an excellent brew from Alpine."
"Fresh bottle received in a recent trade. A truly special beer. Alpine makes several of the best IPAs on the planet."
"D - Very drinkable and could easily put down a couple of bombers of this beer."
"Alpine, you've wowed me once again. I will seek you out soon."
"D: I had a very hard time describing the flavors in this beer. I don't think I've had an IPA or DIPA quite like this one. I could drink this forever. Thanks again Jeff for this amazing beer!"
"D - Pretty tasty beer but the flavor doesn't match the awe of the nose. Not as bitter as I was expecting but still a pretty good beer. I wouldn't mind drinking more of this but wouldn't go nuts trying to seek it out."
"D-Wish this beer had a little longer finish. Crazy smooth for 7%, and has a lush sexy body to it....MMMM.."
"O - Price-wise, it's less expensive than Sculpin (which is overpriced) but more than Pliny (which is not) so I'll happily pay for it. The beer is definitely worth it. Solid buy."
"Pours a clouded apricot hue with a bright white head formin thick and billowing above the head of my new DFH chalice. Lacing is intricate scattered pattern awesome looking clouded murkiness. Aroma is full of punget grapefruit scented hops and wine like aromatics crazy intense experience. Flavor finesses the palate with hop flavors full of fruity earthy honey malt wrapped with a touch of diacetyl, excellent interesting warming honey pine completed expressive and original brew. Mouthfeel is creamy slightly oily with hops, medium to full bodied never heavy or cloying. Carbonation is perfect and natural, with an insane level of drinkability. Solid well made beer from the beginning to the end."
"Drinkable? I'd say it's drinkable, but I probably wouldn't want to overdo it."
"Sweet, with a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Decent carbonation, medium bodied, and recommended. I would drink this again with no problems."
"Drinkability - This is a big beer that begs to be sipped. It goes down well enough but will be too big for the casual drinker. It feels like a DIPA in every way except in ABV."
"Drinkability: This is a great change of pace from some of the other American IPAs I have been drinking. Still a strong hop presence, but the grape flavor really kicks this beer into a unique area of the palette. Very interesting, and one I would drink regularly if it was available here."
"This is a very drinkable IPA, a different IPA with a unique aroma and taste, due to the Nelson Sauvin hop variety. Might be good to compare with Mikkeller Nelson or another Alpine beer like Exponential Hoppiness."
"Golden and very cloudy. Decent head that fades into a filmy wisp. Great lacing, nonetheless. Slightly resinous aroma with a noticeable floral characteristic. Carbonation is a bit on the hard side up front. The middle brings out an interesting floral/spicy hoppiness with what seems to be a guava-like flavor in the upper palate. Finish is standard IPA bitterness. Medium mouthfeel."
"Probably the best beer I've ever had. This beer makes me wish I lived in cali (even more than russian river does)"
"D: Jesus Christ. Yes."
"Drinkability in turn is good. Because there is that bite to it, I couldn't say its overly easy to drink, but its far from harsh. 7% feels about right for it. As a whole a lot of fun to drink and very unique in the IPA world."
"D- Great beer, I could have glass after glass of these"
"This is a drinkable IPA. Don't expect a hop bomb; just a citrusy, smooth brew."
"D - Overall, an ok IPA. I wasn't awed but I wasn't upset either. I would drink again but I would take other IPAs before it."
"D: A very nice offering from Alpine."
"D -"
"I'll be back!"
"Purchased at the ""best damn beer shop"" in san diego california on vacation with my girlfriend. she spend a semester in new zealand and since something about this bomber had to do with NZ I was pressured into getting it.. it wasnt that bad but I was not all that impressed. Its a golden ipa rendering it a bit less hoppy with a lower IBU than I would prefer.. still not a bad beer by any means. Poured a copper color with a minimal head..very basic almost bland appearance. Upon the first sip I got a lot of grapefruit and burnt sugar...a bit of coriander comes to the nose which is a pleasant suprise. This beer is very crisp and slightly complex..it seems as though a ton of flavor is rather non-existent but still has some of those citrus tones I previously mentioned...the flavor just kind of dissipates the more you drink it."
"Another one from Megan, I thank you again. For some reason, whenever I go to San Diego, I always pass on the Alpine beers. I don't know why. Fortuneately, I got the chance to try this one the other night. Poured a nice clear golden color, with a little white head. Good fresh piney hops, spicy, peppery rye and a long bitter finish."
"Drink- Very good well balanced golden IPA, would definitely recommend"
"D - This one goes down so easy. I really wish I could get it back east."
"I actually liked this one better than PH... I loved the profile of the hops and rye together here...a masterpiece..."
"If you are looking for something with a bit more of a hop kick you should try out Alpines ""other"" hoppy brews, such as Double (Imperial) I.P.A Pure Hoppiness or if you dare their Triple IPA Exponential Hoppiness"
"Overall good beer, but nothing spectacular. I liked Duet better then this one and pure hoppiness."
"Again Thanks to Hayesez for the pour! into a Portsmouth snifter from the fridge temp to room temperature. Looks a pretty dark orange. smell is awesome, with a huge presence of typical fresh hops, citrus smell of orange and grapefruit, and as i smell it, a building presence of mango (hayes says rubber...weird!). This is great! there is also some spiciness that i can't place (not our first beer haha), but adds a nice complexity. Taste follows the smell, but just a hint disappointing. it's decently bitter, and fresh grapefruit is there for sure (comes out a lot more as it warms). the mango and spiciness in the smell, however, didn't come out in the taste. it ended up being just a little odd, but not a terrible one. This one feels pretty good in the mouth, again not incredible. The taste is odd/different enough (to me) that i probably wouldn't want a ton of this one, but definitely worth a try!"
"Consumed: 8/5/2010"
"4.0 D: This is my first time with the Nelson hop (as far as I know anyway). The hops are truly in their own category, but I think they could use some help from a mild citrus hop. A little more rye could do wonders for this as well. Still, a very good beer that I enjoyed drinking."
"An exceptional beer. Maybe one of the biggest bready rye presents that I have come across. The Nelson Sauvin hops are also very apparent. I really enjoyed it. Something that is very unique, and would highly recommend."
"Drinks: like one of the better beers with rye I've had. The malt is used generously but kept in check; the enigmatic Nelson hops blend with it perfectly to create an intriguing beer experience."
"Poured into my Zated fluted glass. An interesting, more brown, color than most IPA's. Got about a finger and a half of white head. Smells amazing, very grapefruitastic. One of the best smelling IPA's I've had in some time. Nice citrusy, lemon and grapefruit flavors. The malt flavor is subdued and leads to a nice, looong bitter finish. Medium carbonation, and very satisfying. The 22oz is a perfect serving size."
"MF/D: very smooth, carbonation evident but not overwhelming. flavors coat the mouth and throat leaving a champagne/beer feeling following each sip."
"d-i'm blown away. these hops need to be utilized more often. this was friggin great. up there with pte as a close second best ipa i've ever had. excellent. screw high life, this is the champagne of beers."
"D: Still not totally sure about this one, its in the range of beers that I would probably drink again but it is incredibly odd. Rye and the nelson sauvin hops are a very unique flavor for me for some reason, for tonight this 22oz sample will be more than enough. Hands down the most unique IPA I've had in some time. I wish I could figure out what the one funky flavor is, its something familiar to me, but I can't place it. Definitely interesting, and very glad to try this beer."
"Flavor is fruity...along with the hop bite. Big grapefruit taste, and lasting dryness in the finish. Slightly creamy mouth, but crisp none-the-less in the sence of refreshing! Big carbonation, and low booze in the flavor. A very good IPA!"
"I still think if I could only drink one IPA my whole life it would fit the classic American hop profile. But this one is lovely and it's great for feeling out the Nelson Sauvin hop."
"Overall a bit of a dissapointment. Expo and duet were quite good. Their brother nelson not so much. Maybe another bottle someday will change my mind."
"Mouthfeel is just great with high carbonation, pleasant creaminess from the medium body, and some faint tongue drying. Very sippable and the flavors just all work well together giving a refreshingly crisp, fruity quality with a pinch of mineral flavor and salt."
"Tasted from 22oz bottle. Pours pale orange with a thick and frothy white head that slowly recedes to heavy lace. Nose of lemon, pineapple and other tropical fruits, hemp, and I think that the rye is adding a dimension that I am not used to smelling. The pineapple flavor really comes through on the palate with lemon and even some red fruits. The rye is also a flavor that I recognize on the palate as hard as it was for me to discern on the nose. This is full bodied, as there is something almost creamy with average carbonation and a long, beautiful finish dominated by pineapple and rye. This beer is ridiculously drinkable with no alcohol burn."
"D: Better than Duet in my opinon, but not nearly as good as Pure Hoppiness. If this was available at a bar nearby, I'd give it a try again, but would not actively seek out another bottle. Too many better options that are easier to get in the Midwest."
"D - Meh. A very weak IPA this one is. Rubber all over the place is a big turn-off. It's still drinkable but I won't be looking to get it ever again."
"D: probably one of the most drinkable IPA offerings from alpine. I always enjoy their brews especially their IPA's. I'm definitely glad I have acceess to them on a daily."
"After having such high expectations for Alpine, I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed by this beer and Duet. Luckily, Pure Hoppiness was outstanding."
"I was skeptical as to how the addition of rye would work in a West Coast-style IPA but I was very satisfied with the results. The folks at Alpine really know how to make their hops sing."
"Drinkability is really high. While the alcohol was notable in the nose, it barely reaches the taste. It is an IPA that could please anyone - juicy yet sticky, sweet yet earthy, bitter yet bready."
"Feels rich and creamy and leaves a lingering sweet residue. Well done for an American IPA."
"It's a very drinkable beer with the hops up front and then the malts coming in and taking over. None of the 7% is tasted. The rye malt adds a different dimension to the beer that you don't get in a regular IPA."
"D- A really crisp refreshing beer. Like I mentioned above, I drank this while on a fishing trip in 95 degree weather. The heat index was 110. It really hit the spot! I was a little disappointed that the 2 other peeps I was splitting it with enjoyed it as much as I did LOL!!!"
"Had at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego. Pours a crystal gold with a half finger head that dissipates, but leaves some lacing. Nice is very clear with just the hops present, very nice pine as the main aroma. Taste is also very clean, with pine and grassy hops up front. Mouthfeel is pretty light and crisp, perfect level of carbonation. Finishes very dry. A really nice IPA, with the memorable quality the clean taste and crisp mouthfeel."
"F: Still very bitter, with a slight sweet finish. Lots of juicy hops linger too, lots of musty resinous wet hops too, slightly astringent, looong bitterness, but tolerable. More citrus and pine, earthy and slightly chewy hops. Later burps bring back the tangerine and grapefruit flavors too. A slight grassy and even spicy hop comes through about a minute after the swallow. Very tasty beer., and you are right James, this was better than Pure Hoppiness."
"Mouthfeel is medium in body and has a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D - very nice, and unique, IPA. easily the strongest citrus notes (especially in the nose) I've ever come across, great aromatics."
"Beautiful. I'd love to see some more IPAs made with Nelson hops."
"The palate opens with a beautiful, suffuse hop character with light bitterness and massive flavor. A veritable fruit basket, there's plenty of citrus and some tropical fruit (pineapple) with a light to moderate grape-character. While there is no sweetness, a light rye character is present, and works very well with the hop character. Drying on the finish, there's a lingering moderate, clean bitterness with a palate coaxing fruit character. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is perfect for an IPA. Beautiful stuff."
"Overall, this, next to Ballast Point's Sculpin, is what it's all about with a West-Coast IPA. The fruity complexity with the right amount of rye and malts creates a balance unlike any of the IPAs I have had recently. Alpine, you have created a masterpiece."
"Drinkability: I have been looking forward to trying this one for a while - just a supurb beer"
"Drinkability? A pretty average abv for the style these days is a major plus. Easily, one of the best and most drinkable American IPAs on the planet. Super thumbs up!"
"A pretty intense flavor...maybe not as comforting as a chewier, more candy-like double IPA, and even somehow lacking that ""daily IPA"" utility of other, less demanding IPAs, the drinkability is maybe only a mere ""4," but that's not to say this isn't excellent...because it is."
"D- Very easy to drink this beer, session beer as Sid stated. Tons of flavors and smells with the New Zealand hops and the rye lends a nice mild spiciness to the finish. Recommneded."
"D: Alpine BC once again works its magic with a superb IPA that captures my taste buds in a way few brewers have (and this coming from someone not overly thrilled with IPAs/hoppier beer styles). Good lord this is GOOD. Nelson ay have climbed ahead of Ballast Point's Sculpin as my new favorite..."
"D: Excellent. This is a very nice, easy drinking beer. The hops are big, but not aggressive or in your face. The rye is perfectly balanced and gives the beer a little body and spiciness without making it too big. Will definitely track this one down again."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and the way it showcases the unique Nelson Sauvin hop however it's in the middle of the pack of superb Alpine IPA/DIPA's. Still, very well worth a shot, even more so if you specifically like the hop."
"Snow white head with a caramel-orangish color. The nose on this beer is GREAT! Smells like an amazing west coast ipa, with maybe a hint more maltiness than usual. Sweet malts and florally citrus hops.Taste time! Wow, this is one smooth ipa. The hops are very well balanced making this beer not overwhelmingly bitter. Somewhat of a melon-honey like taste to it. Amazing taste! I would definitely drink this beer again. Unfortunately for me it's not available to buy here. Sad face."
"This beer smells great, very tropical and fruity, with the typical citrus present but not talking a front seat. Tropical is a major aspect of IPAs i search out, and these Nelson Sauvin hops have delievered. Taste is not as bitter as i was expecting which is a welcome change from a cali brewery and i am digging this, in fact dare i say with the rye aspect of this being involved there is a certain balance? However i would appreciate more dryness on the finish and more specifically and importantly more carbination, i think it is lacking a bit there, and would allow the great hop profile to pop out a bit more. Solid IPA i really am enjoying."
"I'm born and raised in San Diego and grew up drinking IPA's - this is hands down my favorite IPA from the area. There'a a few others that give it a run for its money, but Nelson is consistently victorious (even in the bottle)."
"Had it a second time and just as amazing."
"Alpine has done a 180 on me. I didn't have fun with Duet IPA, but Nelson could be my new favorite ""single"" IPA. In fact, I liked it so much, I did two pints of it, something I rarely do with the same beer at a place with so many great options. Even my friend who doesn't like hoppy beer wanted a pint of his own. Get this without hesitation."
"D- Fairly high. Very tasty, the rye threw me for a bit of a loop and I can say I still prefer Alpine's Duet IPA over this one.. that being said this is a great beer and I'm even more impressed with the skills of the Alpine brewers. This one disappeared from my glass faster than I expected- very very drinkable."
"Very enjoyable and highly drinkable. I'd like to drink this often."
"Poured a HUGE head that settled to a thinner but long lasting one. Lacing is apparent, although certainly not heavy. Good carbonation. Color is a cloudy orange/copper. Wow, this smells perfect for the warm day it is. Nose is lemon and orange and some spice. Taste is first lemon, orange/mango but with a great spicey bready malt and that rye backbone. Bitterness is very mild in the finish. So refreshing...it does NOT deteriorate as it warms. This is a pretty perfect balance for me. Sessionable? You bet. This is an amazing beer - great nose, so flavorful, and leaves you wanting more (and I DO)! How can you left-coasters sleep at night keeping this to yourselves!?"
"Great drinkability,, could stay on this all night, or until the well hidden ABV got me... Best beer by these guys I've had... Much to love here!"
"Medium bodied, with an appropriate carbonation level. No hint of ABV. This has scary drinkability. After having Duet not too long ago, I feel like I need to try the entire Alpine lineup. They certainly know how to make a drinkable IPA. Very good stuff."
"2 of these scores where close to achieving a half point increase but I couldn't quite do it. While I loved this beer it was lacking that ""I deserve to be considered with the greats"" factor. The rye is a great addition to this and really shows itself adding another dimension to an already good example. A well crafted IPA with rye, done just right-what's not to like? Bright, vibrant orange citrus fruits with a bitter backing in the nose and more in the taste blended with rye. I like this nelson hop variety. Mouthfeel was not crisp or creamy but somewhere in between. Search out all Alpine IPA's there's a reason 3 of them (including this one) are ranked in the top 100."
"Very drinkable. I wish I had more."
"D - Very easy drinker, polished off the bomber with no problems and could have gone for another."
"Really enjoyed this beer, tasted it along with Pliny and Sculpin, and this one was my top of the three. Definitely would like to have this one again in the future..."
"Alpine brews some hella good American IPAs. Duet was stunning and Nelson is as well. This is one of those times when I fantasize about living in Southern California and having access to beer like this on a daily basis."
"Slightly hazy straw colored pour with a big, loose white head that fades to lots of lacing. Resiny hop aroma with lots of grapefruit, some floral pine and a vinous white grape note. The malt component is dry, earthy and grainy with a moderate sweetness. The flavor is white grapes, citrus, and toffee with some minty pine on the finish and a hint of butterscotch. The body is creamy and full with lots of soft carbonation."
"This one pours a nice golden color, vary clear, with a bit 2cm head, that's nice and sticky, leaving good lacing. A very nice looking IPA. The smell just reeks of pungent, floral, resinous hops. Almost skunky, but redeemed by a sweet fragrant, almost fruity, citrus peel smell. Really a lovely and complex hop these Nelsons are. I can get grapefruit and fresh grass clippings as well. It's like Centennial, but more pungent, I like this. The flavor continues with the smell, with grassy, piney, resinous hoppiness. The fruitiness is more apparent in the taste, with a kind of grassy mango taste, a tiny bit of sweet cantaloupe, and some bitter grapefruit as well. The malt is nice (as I've noticed with most of these Alpine beers), just to the right level to complement the hops, and very sticky, with nice yeast charcter. The beer finishes pretty dry with a slight leafy fruit taste. And the rye, well, you don't exactly taste it, as much as experience it. It add a huge, nice feeling to the body. The carbonation is lively, and makes the flavors burst very nicely as it sort of stings your mouth. And the alcohol lends a slight burn. This IPA strikes that perfect West Coast IPA balance (and I don't mean a 50-50 kind of balance, but a sort of established - in my mind - ratio of what to expect from a very hoppy IPA). My only complaint is that you can't drink as much of it as you would like, as the 7.1% starts to push it towards DIPA territory."
"D - A Great rye IPA, the hoppiness level is full and it is certainly high in its class for overall drinkability and is just an excellently crafted beer all around. The balance is very good and I would definitely consider this a great example of the style!"
"The taste doesn't quite keep up with the nose; it took some consideration to get over how underwhelmed I was by the flavor. It's a good, well-balanced and well-hopped beer. The citrus and some hints of the spices on the nose are there as well, but I found myself sniffing rather than drinking it. The mouthfeel is very thin, too. If drinkability were 'sniffability' I'd give it a higher mark, too. Overall, a solid effort and a good beer."
"D: A top notch IPA. The Nelson Sauvin hop should be used in more beers (wishful thinking). A stunning nose and solid body. More, many more, please."
"I love Hop Rod Rye and generally like any rye IPAs so I was very excited to try this. Appearance is a translucent golden copper with a massive dense white head that slowly fades but never completely disappears and leaves sporadic sheets and streaks of lacing. Grapefruit, mango and mild pine hops dominate the aroma with some light caramel malt and rye balance, nicely balanced but not overly impressive. I really enjoy the flavor and balance of this beer. The front of the palate picks up grapefruit, citrus resin, pine, and mango. Moving back the palate the mild malt body is present with some slightly spicy rye. Mouthfeel is medium thick and smooth with fine, sharp carbonation that slowly asserts itself. Overall a very nice Rye IPA, not quite as bold as Hop Rod Rye, but definitely one of my favorite Alpine beers so far."
"D: Having a hard time getting past the taste. I wouldn't go as far as to say that I dislike it -- I finished my pint with no problem -- but I don't think I'll be seeking this one out again."
"Overall this was nice American IPA with rye, which was expertly balanced. If you are looking into trying a great IPA with hint of rye, this is your beer. Thanks again Esther! Recommended."
"I found this to be a very exciting and supremely drinkable brew. The fact that Alpine doesn't distribute in my state is unfortunate as this could have easily become one of my go-to beers..."
"Poured hazy copper color with an average frothy white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy grapefruit and earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a slick texture with soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy bitter flavor with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. Very good brew."
"this was wonderful. i did not think Duet could be topped but i was wrong, this really shines."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full, with a nice creaminess and a pleasant carbonation level. This is probably the most unique IPA I have ever had. I really enjoyed it."
"D-This is a good and quite interesting rye IPA. The mouthfeel and smell are great and the taste is above average. Its a little bit heavy on the rye for me without a big piny hop punch to counterbalance it. The citrus is a great touch-and I wish this were more present than the herbal punch. The herbal/rye combo overshadows the other hops trying to shine through. Still a great brew overall."
"D - If this came in six packs I would have a new go-to summer beer. Alas, this will be one to look forward to the next time I visit California."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Average mouthfeel, not too carbonated. Finishes pretty dry, with a nice caress on the tongue. The flavor would probably be enhanced on-tap, but otherwise, there are many other IPA's that I'd seek out before this one. Nothing wrong with it at all, well balanced, but nothing spectacular."
"For me, being critical of silly-bitter IPAs, this one is very enjoyable while still indulging the hop receptors in the hippocampus or where ever beer scientists say they are."
"Grassy, herbaceous, and citrusy in the nose. Pungent hops and a hint of rye spiciness. Flavor is similar, intense yet balanced with plenty of malt and rye flavors lending sturdiness under all the hop greenery. A somewhat sweet cereal grain that reminds me of a local hop bomb, Daisy Cutter. Hop bitterness is firm and moderate, carrying long into the dry finish. Body is on the light side of medium with ample carbonation. Easy to drink, Nelson is another West Coast stunner from Alpine..."
"D: Very easy drinking and the ABV doesn't make itself known at all. I've knocked back a few pints of this on a Friday afternoon on more than one occasion."
"D: A great IPA. Not the standard that we are used to. Shows the range of the style and the creativeness of American brewers by slightly tweaking the ingredients."
"Another great IPA from the Alpine Beer Company. The unique character of Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand adds a wonderful grapefruit/citrus flavor that blends well with the malt. This beer is a light copper color, slightly hazy, with nice head with lots of lace that clings to the glass as you drink it. Light and slightly fruity aroma, with a touch of rye malt that goes very well with this interesting southern hemisphere hop. Overall impression -- this is an exceptionally smooth beer."
"Would have again it is very nice was so glad to try this one."
"Bottle, home. Alpine night #2. Another day, another fantastic IPA from Alpine. Whereas Duet was a nearly perfect version of what I look for in an IPA, Nelson is unexpected but also world class. This isn't my first encounter with Nelson Sauvin hops, but it's definitely the best use of them that I've tried. The beer smells of orange rinds, wild lilacs, honeysuckle and sweet white grape juice. The flavor is dry, bitter and spicy with rye. The whole package works extremely well. I have no real qualms with this beer, but I wouldn't mind if the rye was a bit stronger. I'd love to try an imperial version of this beer, so get on that Alpine. The mouthfeel has a nice hop oiliness surrounding the duel between hop bite and rye spice. It's an incredibly drinkable beer despite its unusual flavor profile. Alpine has managed to make a combination of rye and Nelson Sauvin hops feel completely natural and I'd love to spend a night with nothing but glasses of Nelson."
"Great beer."
"Very interesting beer, drinkability does suffer from the sweetness though."
"this beverage came with a bit of reputation in the sd area, as many of the breweries visited informed us we'd be mistaken were we not to head over to alpine. when i arrived, they struggled to determine what order i should taste in, but were convinced i should finish with this unique beverage. the nelsons have an arrayed aroma and flavor, it was like having a bite of something colorful off of someone else's plate when they weren't watching and you didn't pay attention to what they ordered. playfully citrus with an angry spice contributed both by the hop and the rye. i'm not sure what to make of this beer, but i'd like more to try. it's kind've like a rhinocorn. i don't know if it's even real. a fun and spicy rye.p.a."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with perfect carbonation. This one is exceedingly easy to drink and just amazingly enjoyable. A top notch IPA and I love the addition of rye and the Nelson Sauvin hops. Seek it out if you have the ability!"
"D: Drinkability is high. Easy to drink, smooth, definitely refreshing. 7% abv is hidden well in the taste."
"Crazy drinkable; really delicious and goes down easy."
"The Nelson pours a hazy amber orange color. A nice frothy pure white head sits atop with very good lacing and retention. The color is much darker than other IPA's. Aromas are nice and sweet with citrus fruits popping out of a nice hop backbone. Also some hints of grains and caramel. Quaff is much different from other hoppy IPA's. Plenty of hops make up the taste but there is also some piny notes. Not much citrus in the mouth. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied. Plenty of hops bounce around on the tongue. Drinkability is obviously high, ABV allows you to sip a couple and taste is right there. I am very excited to move onto the other IPA's from Alpine."
"Edit.. after looking at others reviews I would be up to try this one again to see if it wasn't a fluke or a bad bottle"
"Overall an excellent beer and I will drink this as often as I can find it. I only live 1 hour away from the brewery and it's hard for me to find."
"D: I was surprised by this beer, as it really wasn't I expected. Instead of a rye IPA this was more like a saison, with huge carbonation and a lot of tartness. I'd love to have this again with some pork."
"Overall I think the duet is a easier drinking ipa but this should be in the roation to experience all the variety of hops out there, get out there and try some of these nelson sauvin. Again I tip my pint to Alpine, and im not going to bed!"
"I recieved this beer as part of my Secret Santa haul, oner in a series of 3 Alpine beers and I am very happy to finally mark this Want off my list. Like I stated above this is a very good tasting beer and I would love having this again. Thanks Matt!"
"Pours light gold and slightly hazy with a nice amount of light foamy head. I love how the Nelson sauvignon hops smell, they're distinct and the rye definitely gives off a bit of grassy-summery aromas. The taste is pure citrusy bitterness with a perfect dry malt after taste. Once again, the nelson hops have a certain uniqueness to them, I've only had them in one other beer (Karl Strauss Big Barrel but the hop makes its presence felt.)The beer is very smooth, clean and crisp. This beer is very easy to drink but I don't know if rye is for everyone. Great west-coast IPA and another feather in Alpine's IPA hat."
"Drinkability: goes down incredibly easily--not too harsh, bitter, or in your face, and done quite nicely. Could drink this one all night and not think twice about it. At the same time, it's quite unique and nicely done--I've never had a beer quite like this."
"Drinkability: A startlingly drinkable brew. The rye pairs masterfully with the unique elements of the Nelson Sauvin hop, making for a full-bodied, flavorful and aromatic brew that's drinkable not only by virtue of its reasonable abv% but also because of the aforementioned ""what am I tasting?"" effect. I keep getting new things out of this one, and that's really one of my favorite aspects of drinking and reviewing beer - that with four simple ingredients, a masterful brewer can evoke ten, fifteen, twenty, sometimes more identifiable flavors. Nelson - despite not being a perfect brew - is a perfect example of why I love reviewing beer, and in my mind, that makes it as drinkable as any beer I've ever had."
"Very drinkable, and an overall pleasure."
"Cheers!"
"I see why this one gets such high marks. Not only is this startlingly original, but it's crushingly easy to drink. The lack of bitterness of a typical IPA puts this one in a class by itself & it owns that class, whatever else might come along. Excellent beer."
"I'm really impressed with Alpine Beer Company's IPAs. They brew some of the finest in the world. Nelson is one of their best. I really like the flavor of these hops that hail from New Zealand. The use of rye was a stroke of brilliance, as well. There's not a hell of a lot to complain about here. Nelson is that good. Find a bottle. You can thank me later."
"I'd bet that this beer is incredible when fresh. In the state that I had it, it has to settle for really, really good. I wish this were in six-packs and more importantly I wish I could buy it in Missouri. This beer is a great companion for a evening of drinking, the body is nice for a chilly evening that happens to coincide with a hop craving."
"D: This is a truely delightful beer, and I wish it made it's way to me more often. I guess I'll have to get to some more trading!"
"Lovers of grapefruit, spice, or just the Nelson hop in particular are going to really dig this. Personally, I felt that it naturally lacked some of the sizzle that this had fresh on draft in San Diego and had a strange ""off"" taste to it that I couldn't quite pinpoint. This is still damn tasty stuff though and is well worth seeking out."
"D-Well, I am a sucker for Nelson Sauvin hops and for most beers made by Alpine Beer Company so I didn't doubt that this one would be a winner. In reality I feel it exceeded my expectations. A truly delicious brew. I hear a growler of this is coming my way too, Woo-hoo!"
"Slightly hazy golden-orange in color with a good-sized off-white and fluffy head that doesn't want to go away. When it does, a craggy lace is left behind. Nose involves a nice big hit of citrusy hops and a slightly sour earthiness in the background. Smooth and malty going down and wrapped in more citrusy hoppiness with a few sour candy notes in the middle. Well-balanced and quite tasty brew, and there's not much more you can ask for than that."
"Alpine should send me another bottle so I know if it's an infection or not :)"
"Extremely drinkable. Tasty. Balanced. Unique. I really like this offering. Alpine just might have the best overall hop lineup around."
"D: Great for 7% abv. Very happy I tried this beer, definitely gonna purchase again."
"This is a fantastic beer. Alpine is great at packing a ton of hop flavor into a beer yet somehow keeping it balanced and complex. This is a perfect example of that prowess."
"D- Superb. A wonderful if not slighlty over the top twist, enjoyable for any hop-head..."
"22oz bottle from mikey711, very much appreciated. The beer is lightly hazy, light orange color, dense foamy head. The smell isn't as unique as I expected from the Nelson Sauvins, but I guess the longer it lingered I noticed some nuances. Light citrus and pine, a little orange peel, and a very light touch of rye. These all came through in the taste, maybe not so much from the rye but still delicious. Very drinkable, the body was just right for an American IPA, perfect carbonation."
"Another great hoppy ale from Alpine. The rye adds a nice element to it as does the unique choice in hops. Not a mouth blistering hop bomb but definitely complex and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Worth seeking out. Alpine's reputation seems deserved as a first rate brewery of hop-forward beers."
"drinkability is great. love the hop character and bit of extra depth you get from the light rye spice. good balance. this is one tasty brew!"
"Medium body, lower carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Seems a bit thin. Pretty nice."
"I'm a little let down to be honest. It's a good beer but lacking in mouthfeel and a bit watery. Lots of tangerine and citrus flavor with a long bitter finish. Malt is thin and hidden behind the hops. Nice grapefruit but the mouthfeel is a bit off. A bit spicey with a some floral and grassy tastes as well."
"Overall a very good, certainly unusal, IPA. One worth having and definately makes me want to visit Alpine next time I'm in California."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Carbonation detracts from it a bit but still a pretty swell beer. I need to get me some of those Nelson Sauvins. Thanks Eric!"
"Light gold in colour with a slight haze. It had a fine, bright white cap that stuck around until my pint was gone and there was lots of lace stuck to my glass. The aroma was intense with grapefruit and resin, nice for a West Coast IPA. It had a soft, citrus bitterness and grapefruit flavour throughout. There was some malt backbone that showed through towards the finish and a bit of rye spiciness as well. Quite refreshing. Just under medium bodied with smooth, fine carbonation. Light dryness, good texture. I liked the balance on this beer - solid IPA with a bit of rye that added depth to the hoppiness."
"Dial down the carb and you've got one of the tastiest IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking - very complex and layered with enough hops to please everyone. Love the rye - Yum."
"Overall, this beer has some really nice attributes, needs a little tweaking on the taste and it would be perfect."
"Drinkability: Disappeared way too fast, I wish this was a growler, not a bomber. Every time I reach for an IPA I will wish it was a Nelson."
"Pours a yellow straw color with a white head. The main components of the aroma are rye and peaches with some other fruit as well, a very pleasant and different smelling beer. The flavor is rye, grapefruit and a little bit of bitterness. No real alcohol is detectable. A unique beer with a medium-thin mouthfeel and good carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Notes: Nothing but good things to say about this brewer. I will be making this a staple in the arsenal."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a hazy orange(with some yeasty floaters) and a sticky white head. The aroma is pine, oranges and pineapple. The flavor follows the nose, with pineapple-orange juice being dominant. The finish lingers and is sweet. The beer is medium bodied and easy drinking. The beer works for me. I was expecting a bigger beer, but the profile is much more sublime and layered."
"D: I could see drinking several of these!"
"D- A lot of these new top IPAs (Nelson, Sculpin, etc.) are very similar to pliny in the nose. This was wonderfully complex and balanced and one of the best IPAs i've ever tasted, bar none."
"Very well balanced dry, sweet and bitter medium body that is slightly earthy with a lot of uber fresh juicy hops. Lots of dry earthy pine up front that is quickly balanced by a nice citrusy lemon peel/grapefruit character, sweet rye malt and graham crackery malt presence. I was hoping that the rye would be more pronounced but it was a bit subtle providing nice balance. The ABV is excellently masked resulting in a complex, flavorful and dangerously drinkable IPA."
"Overall I was very impressed by this beer, I tried Duet and was not that impressed so I wasn't enthusiastic to try this one. I was wrong, this goes into my top 5 favorite IPA's, right up there with Sculpin and Pliney. Really looking forward to trying pure hoppyness and ex hoppyness now. This one is really excellent in pretty much every category."
"D- Really amazing. I could drink this all day and all night. It smells like something I could only dream of an IPA smelling like Deceptively drinkable for 7.1%abv, but if it was 2% I would still want it all night (same if it was 20%.) This is simply a really phenomenal IPA."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all night long. I really want to do a tasting with Sculpin, this, PtE, and Yulesmith Summer. Those are my favorite IPA's and this one is right there with them. A very good beer."
"D: Very tasty and damn drinkable."
"Drinkability: The abv has legs but the flavor profile and mouthfeel make this one tasty brew I can drink a lot of!"
"D - A lot of hops to drink too too many, but the one I am having is going down just fine."
"Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed bright golden yellow with at least an inch of fluffy sticky bone white foam. The head leaves a nice lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of both white and ruby red grapefruit peel, pith, and juice, tangerines, oranges, lemon oil, fruity, white wine-like notes characteristic of this hop variety. Body is about medium could be a bit fuller, with adequate carbonation and quite dry throughout. Pretty tasty stuff and very easy to drink. Certainly worth checking out. Thanks a bunch Chris!"
"D: No real alcohol presence, just bitterness. Light, hoppy, refreshing= excellent."
"D - High. This is a stunner with the Nelson hops. Never had a bottle but I imagine it'd be almost as good as the fresh growler I got. Look for this and be suprised!"
"Thanks to Mauerhan for the opportunity to try this one. 22oz. bottle served in a standard pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a rocky, bright white cap. Decent head retention reveals specks and strands of delicate, cloud-like lacing as the brew is consumed. Nose is light, sweet grapefruit. Crisp rye flavor comes out up front, followed by grapefruit sweetness in the middle and finishing with a light, cleansing residual bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation that drops off towards the end of the quaff. This is really delicious. The rye really give it an extra dimension. This is my third IPA from Alpine and it is awesome. A top notch beer from a top notch brewery."
"Overall, another great IPA from Alpine. I love the rye in this beer, as it is subtle, but still present. I will have no problem with this bomber. A well done beer."
"Overall very good beer, love the hops and fruit flavors in this one."
"Bottle courtesy of bret27. Pours a light gold color with a frothy off-white head. The lightness is actually enticing considering the darker hues of so many awful, oversweet crystal malt bomb IPAs. Aroma is just ridiculous. A huge wave of tropical fruits explodes from the glass. Peach syrup, tangerines, passionfruit, grapefruit, pineapple; I really can't stop smelling this. The taste is, thankfully, pretty much identical to the aroma, so much so that it was hard to tell when I had stopped inhaling and started imbibing. Fruit salad with a great resinous medium bitterness. Oh and I was so fixated on the fruitiness that I almost didn't notice the rye, which works to spice up (pun intended) the malt base, which would otherwise be imperceivable. Insanely smooth and drinkable. Just a fantastic IPA."
"Drinkability- Fucking fantastic. This is one of the easiest drinking, nicely balanced IPA's out there. It's somewhere between a single and double IPA to me and the amount of rye used is perfect. I've had too many rye brews where the rye is overbearing and too spicy/bitter. This one got it right. Great brew that's even better than I remember, thanks Alex!"
"D - Pretty nice IPA overall. Really enjoying this beer, but not as much as the other Alpines I've had (Exp Hoppiness, Pure Hoppiness, and Duet). Really great beer though. Definitely would go for this one again."
"Very tasty beer from one of the top pale ale producers in the country."
"D: Please. This is one of the best AIPA/RyePA's I've ever had. Hands down. You southern CA SOB's are so lucky!"
"Drinkability high. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Its great. Lie cheat and steal to get this one, well don't do any of those things just go buy it (or trade for it like me)."
"D - One of the top IPAs for me, Alpine continues to kill it when it comes to all things hoppy. A brewery that I won't ever miss when I'm in the area visiting."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with decent carbonation."
"Very well done and luciously fresh - don't miss it if you get the chance to sample this beer in this modality...."
"Right there with the Duet. The Rye adds a nice spicyness and the Nelson hops add a lemony bite. Theres also some additonal earthiness beyond whats found in the Duet. Less malt to balance, but you don't miss it as it allows the rye to shine through."
"I love me some Alpine. I would love them more if it was shorter than two hours to drive there for some more."
"Dangerously drinkable, as the best of them are. Man, if Duet ever hits our shores as well that's THREE new IPAs I want in my fridge ALL THE TIME, and there's already Stone's two and Union Jack and Alesmith... damn you, delicious, fresh, local(ish) IPAs, ruining me for the day I must leave SoCal!"
"Not much carbonation and a fairly average weight make it very drinkable. The 7% doesn't hurt, either. Hidden well."
"D: This is a dangerously drinkable beer. The excellent fruity hops make this so delicious and leave you wanting more. But at 7.1%, you need to watch out, as a bomber of this can do some damage."
"I am glad I tried this but one is enough for me."
"(Edit: Re-tried thanks to weibull. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I remember, and the beer was bordering on under-carbonated, knocking the mouthfeel from a 5.0 to a 4.0. Still, a wonderful IPA.)"
"D - Good overall. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall, an good AIPA that I recommend. Not sure if it was the nelson hop or the rye or the mix of the two but I didn't love this one like I loved the Duet and Pure Hoppiness from them. During my trip, I got to try a sample on tap at the brewery so this was my first real taste of it. Rotation: not avail here. While I enjoyed this one, if I'm going to get some Alpine shipped to me I'll stick to the others from them. But if in the area and can get on-tap, it would be worth a pint."
"Pale, hazy golden body. Thin and bubbly cap of ivory white froth. Lacing comes in sporadic thin rings. Aroma brings bright layers of pink grapefruit, lemon zest, MJ, apricot, tangerine, etc... This is one great smelling beer. This IPA has nice balance between bitter and flavor in regards to the hops. Neither overpowers the other. Bitterness is fairly clean and refreshing. Flavor brings a lot of citrus and a little pine too. Not quite as bright and juicy as the aroma led me to believe, but rather, a little rough around the edges, which isn't all bad in an IPA. All of the original suspects are still around to varying degrees....grapefruit, orange, lemon, etc.... This is an interesting IPA and an interesting hop for sure."
"This is good but I may be tempted to reach for other offerings before this one again. If you like rye in your beer this is one to try though. Let it warm and you will be greeted with a very different beer from when it's cold."
"Quite hearty & complex which continues to remind me, never judge a book by it's cover."
"This is another great IPA from Alpine, who has never disappointed me in this style. They are clearly making some of the best IPAs out there and I'm pumped they're bottling more of them. Highly recommended...obviously."
"D: Easy sipper for sure and the bomber was gone before I knew it"
"Pours a cloudy light golden color with a nice loose foamy white head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is off the charts!!! Really enjoyable aggressive fruity grapefruit orange resin character. Full flavored, the grapefruit taste bursts out and pretty much hides the rye-factor. However, I do sense that the rye is adding to the mouth feel and seems to extend the impact of the resin aftertaste. This is one heck of a nice drinker. Very enjoyable; reminds me some of Pliny. Huge thanks to radshoesbro for the opportunity."
"D - I could do a few for sure. Yeah, Nelson in bottle!"
"Great stuff, all around. Great to see Alpine starting to bottle a few more of their offerings."
"Notes: I have a feeling that this bottle isn't doing the beer justice when compared to the draught version. It seems like the flavor might be able to match the nose, and the amount of carbonation would be improved to give it that slightly creamy feel that I love in my IPA's. Seeing as how Alpine just starting bottling these beers, I wonder if they are still fine-tuning the bottling line because the carbonation seemed a bit off. This doesn't replace Hop Rod Rye as my favorite rye beer, but it will become a staple in my beer diet, for sure. Quite nice!"
"The beer is upper light bodied with a sticky mouthfeel. To be honest the bottle could have used a bit more carbonation, but maybe it's just me as I typically prefer higher carbonation on IPAs. This is a fantastic beer. As of now I prefer this beer on tap."
"D: Quite drinkable. Not nearly as good as Duet or O'Brien's IPA, but very good stuff."
"Alpines folks have got to learn"
"Had this on-tap at the Toronado San Francisco anniversary fest. I really, really liked this beer. I've been an Alpine fan for a while, and I think they do a great job with their hoppy beers. I love the zingy, bitter hop onslaught on this one coupled with the spicy rye, it just really works for me. Poured golden with a wispy head, but very nice continuous lacing. Very fresh tasting herbal hops in the nose, quite a bit of dill aroma that I get from the Nelson Sauvin hops sometime, and a bit spicy in the finish as well. I just love the taste of this beer. Lots of herbal hops followed by lots of pine, pretty much my favorite hop situation. Long, tangy, spicy, piney, and herbal. Beautiful interplay between the spicy, slightly sour rye and the hops. Very bitter and long in the mouth with quite an austere malt profile. This is a delicious beer, but its a mouthful."
"D: Goes down so good. Incredibly drinkable. Could go for another growler easy."
"D - Very high. This beer is solid."
"This is my new favorite beer. I'm lucky enought to live 15 miles from the brewery and I go there bi-weekly to fill my cache of growlers."
"I finally got to try an Alpine IPA that is not Pure Hoppiness and I was left impressed. The combination of the Nelson hops and the rye gives this a unqiue flavor that still fits in perfectly in the IPA family."
"UPDATE: I had a bottle of the a recent batch of Nelson. The bottled version is vastly inferior to the tap version, IMO. Overwhelming rye and none of the tropical flavor. If you've had it in the bottle and were not impressed, try the tap. Not changing the review because I believe the tap version is a great beer and a number of reviewers are picking up those tropical flavors in the bottle - maybe I just had a bad bottle."
"Growler from the brewery on release day. Gold with a lasting white head. Super green, dank, spicy, grape, and mango hop aroma. Awesome. Smells like no other IPA that I've had, yet is unquestionably one of the best hop aromas that I've ever come across. The flavor has a similar light toasty malt to their other IPAs, but with just a touch of rye spice. The hop flavor is all there, but is not too bitter at all, just very dank, fruity, and juicy. The body is on the light some with smooth carbonation. I know that this is at the peak of freshness, but damn this is amazing. Unique and just awesome all around."
"D: A nice beer from Alpine, a joy to drink, but I wasn't as blown away with it as I was with Duet, but a very good effort nonetheless."
"Overall: A must try. Perhaps Alpine's finest beer and something that should be treasured by all beer lovers. Cheers!"
"D - Nelson Rye displays quite a unique hop character. It's juicy, spicy and dry, and packs lots of flavor. Really pungent aroma too. Alpine makes some fine IPAs."
"D: This one is a drinker. It is getting close to the arbitrary 8% ABV required to become a II IPA but I dont care about titles and groupings, this beer is drinkable despite the highish ABV. It could defiantly catch up with you after a few pints."
"Overall one of the best I have had period, end of story. Go get this one."
"Alpine is slowly wresting away the IPA title from the other west coast breweries - it'll be interesting to see how Russian River, Ballast Point, and Alesmith respond."
"Overall, I would be in huge trouble if I could drink this on a daily basis. My only negative was that I wish there was more hop flavor in this beer. Still, wonderfully crafted and a true delight to drink."
"Drinkable, nice juicy mouthfeel."
"D - This is extremely drinkable, so smooth and well rounded and at 7%, it's ok to have more than one. Great beer."
"[OVERALL]: very drinkable, extremely fresh-flavored RIPA (especially when poured shortly after tapping)"
"Perhaps the ultimate Southern California IPA. Had on tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego. Poured a light yellow color, almost the color of a lager, but plenty of lacing and sheeting action on the glass. Strong piney and floral aroma. A decent amount of malt, with a little detectable sweetness, but all the piney and slightly floral hop goodness was definately center stage. Excellent crispness to the hop bitterness. Just a joy to drink and right level of carbonation."
"Nelson is clean, slightly fruity, though the nose doesn't give away much hint of the flavor to come. The aroma/bitter balance is perfect, and for a near-stong ale it is incredibly drinkable; there is no flavor fatigue at all."
"Notes from and tasted on: 3/14/09"
"Overall: World class, probably my all-time favorite IPA."
"Note: Called an IPA by the brewery(golden rye IPA) and tastes as such. Very nice hop flavor, would like to see more of this Nelson Sauvin hop."
"4.5/4/4/4/4 = 4.1"
"I thought this a nice beer, but really nothing all that special. If I lived in the San Diego area, I doubt I would ever order this again, as there are just too many other delectable options to choose from around here."
"Clear gold with a medium white head. Pine, resin bomb in the nose with grass and grapefruit. More resin and pine in the flavor, with the citrus taking a back seat. Sharp rye taste in the back with minerals and a vinuous bite. I see this is listed as an APA here, even though the company calls it and IPA. Either way, it is an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Please Sir, May I have Another?"
"D- I f you like rye, and I do, this is an awesome beer. Think brewery meets jewish deli."
"D- This is the most rye-heavy beer I've ever tasted, definitely an acquired taste that loses points for me personally (not a big fan of rye bread), the dominating rye appears off-balance and limits overall drinkability"
"Poured from tap at Pizza Port (12-8-07). Poured into a pint glass a golden color with an egg shell white thick foam head. Smell is of rye bread mixed with slight citrus overtone. Taste is oh my god good...light malt mixed with dank pot pine taste all blended up with a mixture of pineapple and rye. Mouthfeel is light with smooth carbonation level. Drinkability is high with my first pint gone in 60 seconds, dont taste the alcohol and I could drink this beer everyday for years. The best APA I have tried but I really think it is almost more of an IPA mixed with APA mixed with the color and body of a hefe. Great job alpine now lets put it into bottles."
"Drinkability: It's really great smelling stuff! I had to be restrained from pouring out the growler onto myself so I could continue to smell this beer for days and days to come."
"This is certainly a fascinating hop, it is quite different from any other hop variety that I have direct experience with. Very interesting, and very tasty, I definitely could do with more of this beer. I have a feeling though that these flavors would get old if I encountered them at such levels on a more regular basis. The hop character (both the aroma & flavor) is so musky; it is makes me think of the essential oils of a mix of herbs. I am not sure if it quite works in the IPA format, but could definitely see using it in some of the lighter colored Belgian-styled beers. Definitely well worth it though, and I am still quite exited to use this hop in my own brewing."
"D: Interesting brew. Definately original and worth checking out."
"Overall: oh gawd, I must learn to brew this... a brilliant (rye) APA, and another brilliant beer for Alpine"
"The alcohol is very well masked in this medium bodied ale of bliss. Too easy to drink as well as a hot weather pleaser. You don't want to miss this one...another winner from Alpine!"
"I always look forward to new beers from Alpine as it seems they can do no wrong. The sleeper beer hit of San Diego. Great job."
"A great drink that really stands out, both for the grains and the hops used. Good luck finding this one, but do not pass it up!"
"Mouthfeel is good too, not too heavy, not too watery, very drinkable hard to drink just one, so many interesting flavors happening."
"Overall: As usual, I am not let down with Alpine Beer Company. This is another winner to add to the list of great Alpine brews."
