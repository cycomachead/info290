It's a 12oz bottle, fresh (over 2 months till it's past its due date). The color is good, but it poured quite syrupy into the glass. The smell is malty, with just a touch of citrus fruits. The taste is, as I said, bland. Almost no taste, bread like perhaps, with a mild grapefruit and pine aftertaste. It's a bit thick on the tongue. Overall I'm somewhat disappointed. I saw the high ratings and expected more. I'll definitely pass on this in the future.","tds101","Nov 08, 2014"

Green grass and grapefruit bite into the tongue, while the toasty maltiness with hints of toffee keep things in good balance. Medium bodied and crisp on the palate, the finish is on the dry side, while malt still shines trough. The most convincing part of this IPA is its aftertaste, as it is surprisingly long and superdry, with hops sparking very late on the back of the palate, unleashing an enjoyable taste of fruits and grass just at the moment when you begin to think it may be over already.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

The body has a pleasant thickness to it and little bite from the hops on the finish. This is a very good IPA, well made and all that.","delta490","Oct 18, 2014"

4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/30/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, biscuit, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hop and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit. tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, biscuit, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 12, 2014"

I decided that now's a good time to update my review, as this is the freshest batch I've ever tasted (basically snagged the six pack right off the truck). You would think that my score would diminish, having been exposed to so many more incredible beers since my initial review, but that's not the case here. HopDevil remains consistently remarkable. It's one of the few IPAs I've had that come dangerously close to DIPA territory in terms of flavor. Boisterous hops provide a wonderfully complex display of juiciness, bitterness, and Earthiness, with a lingering spice in the finish. To me, this is a humble, yet world-class IPA that might just be Victory's magnum opus.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 26, 2014"

4.36,7.1,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Final Word: This is a great IPA! It carries plenty of hop flavor, but offers a unique spicy, peachy, grassy profile instead of your typical grapefruit/bitterness combo found in many IPAs. While the bitterness was a bit too unpleasant after swallowing, it merely kept the beer from being perfect, not from being excellent. The texture and balance made for an extremely drinkable IPA, while still offering enough complexity and nuance to please any drinker. I particularly enjoyed the hint of pear in the finish, as it followed this beer’s trend of surprising you with many atypical flavors. This beer is a must try for any IPA lover, and should only be avoided by those that aren’t used to hoppy beers yet.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jul 13, 2014"

Luckily, it tasted much better. Mix of pine and citrus hops up front that are balanced out quickly by sweet carmel malt. Does not finish too bitter. In all fairness, maybe I had too many hoppy beers before reviewing so I will revisit, but right now I would say good- not great.","WesMantooth","Jun 20, 2014"

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass (thought this was style appropriate). 1 1/2 fingers of slightly off-white head (diminished down to about 1, decent retention). Clear, darkish amber color... good looking beer. Medium one the nose, some hints of lemon, definitely some pine, smells 'clean' overall (reminiscent of the 'clean' smell of DirtWolf; at least to me), maybe just a hint of the 'homebrew keg' smell... but just a hint. Tastes were on point. Bright, resiny pine freshness off the bat, bit of citrus on the back end... not overly malty. Crisp and refreshing to the tastebuds. Overall, a nice refreshing, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel, good carbonation, again very refreshing on the palate. Nice beer. This is a keeper, and I am sure it will find its way into my fridge every once in a while (especially when the dates are right!).","Mikus","May 20, 2014"

This was the first craft beer I tried years ago so maybe it has a sentimental impression on me, but nevertheless, it is damn good if you dont mind a complex bitter blast.

4.24,4.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a rich, clear reddish amber with a thin ring of fluffy off-white head. It looks quite nice, though more head formation would be nice. Scents of sweet malt and abundant floral hops upfront, aromas of honey and jasmine are also present, as well as some earthy notes and fainter notes of citrus and pine. Quite well rounded and appealing, very well done aroma in the East Coast style. Flavor begins with a big burst of floral hops and hop bitterness, as well as some caramel malt sweetness backing the hops. In the middle and finish more pine resin flavor comes out, alongside some citrus peel, still backed by a modest level of caramel malt. The finish is mostly pine resin and a bit of caramel malt. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, floral flavors and grainy malt. The flavor profile is quite nice and balances hop bitterness with malt sweetness quite well. Very fitting for an East Coast IPA and quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a slightly sticky and resinous mouthfeel. It is quite easy to drink and very pleasant. Overall this is a good East Coast IPA. It has the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel I expect from the sub-style and it matches quite well with, though not quite as good as, Bell's Two Hearted. Still, it's a good IPA and I'd have it again.","Auraan","Feb 21, 2014"

It pours a deep red amber color with a thick deep cream head that lasts well into the beer. And leaves a thick lacing of off white foam. The aroma is very complex and not reminiscent of most hop heavy ipas. There is a strong presence of malts, some coffee and caramel notes. There are also citrus and pine notes but they are subtle in relativity to the malt. It is very complex and unexpected fir such an unassuming ipa. The flavor is very similar. Im beginning to well respect the east coast for their very complex and deep ipas. Not just the single note hoppy ipas if the west coast. Looking forward to sampling Victory's hop ranch tomorrow.","lochef81","Feb 03, 2014"

This is definitely a well crafted and tasty beer, but falls just short of the top tier for the style. For east cost offerings I'd stick with DFH or Troegg's Nugget Nectar although you will pay slightly more for each.","HarryPotHead","Jan 19, 2014"

What’s most impressive to me is how approachable this beer is. It isn’t over-hopped, still bold in its flavors, and backs off the intensity where others might try to amp it up a notch. Sometimes less is more. I certainly find myself able to put down 2 or 3 of these a lot easier than others.","blindtiger24","Dec 05, 2013"

Popping the top I get a very complex aroma of molasses but not much hops, odd referencing the name. Pours to a red golden color with a pillow foamy beige two finger head. On the taste the complexity continues, this brew is almost imperial ipa-esque in its existence. The taste starts thick and syrupy with an apparent high ABV, it the transitions into nice deep hop kick with a yet strong malted background. The finish is a growing bitter aftertaste that yearns another sip. A great selection from Victory. I will seek out.","mooseisloose","Sep 02, 2013"

4.65,14.3,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Drinkabilty - I recommed this beer to everyone. It has plenty of flavor, just enough hop kick, nice smooth malts, and light alcohol at the finish. Balance is amazing, drinks very easy and very affordable. This is a classic example of a beer that gets overlooked cause its been around for awhile, made year round, and is always avaible around here. Truly world class, glad I revisited this one.","wvsabbath","Aug 23, 2013"

4.24,4.2,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a keeper. I usually find myself not returning to Ipa's with the ""piney"" bitter aftertaste. This one is an exception. Poured into a teku, this has seriously awesome creamy head for an ipa and it retains well. Most ipa's have head which dissipates, but not this beer. The color is deep amber, almost red, full of dancing bubbles. The scent at first is piney and spicy but halfway through mellows out and a deep jasmine scent dominates. Quite lovely really. Perfect carbonation: not too much, not too little. A mellow yet spicy and resin like taste which rounds out to slight bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue, maybe a bit grapefruit like? A bit of hotness I suppose, but this is probably just accentuated by the bitterness! This is like drinking a juicy hop!, and an extremely drinkable one at that! I cannot wait to try this on tap!","devlishdamsel","Jun 12, 2013"

No malt to speak of on the nose. On the palate it’s got medium body and good carbonation. It’s bedeviled with hops but lacking in balance without a bigger malt character to back it up. Goes down oily with a good bitter aftertaste. A very plucky ale. Easy to drink and a clean, long finish.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Orange and other citrus rind meld with some floral notes and alcohol, pretty balanced here. Taste follows the nose well, upfront spicy hop with a sturdy malted backbone. Not much of the floral or citrus notes translate well to the palate, leaving much of the flavor cut and dry hop and malt. The two balance each other well, but leave the overall flavor pretty bland- not much complexity. Feel is solid, dry and sticky, easy to drink with well concealed alcohol. Overall this beer is good in a balanced sense, however living on the west coast I'm used to my ipas ridiculously over hopped and citrusy, not something I get with this beer. As a result I disagree with it's average rating pretty dramatically. This beer just isn't for me","lordofstarside","Feb 25, 2013"

Aroma has a strong grapefruit and pine hop presence (though I've smelt more ferocious than this). Flavor matches the aroma--hops, hops, and more hops. Maybe some malt character can be detected in the finish, but it's hard to tell with the prolonged hop taste. Drinkable, but decidedly one-dimensional. Typical IPA.","MaximalC","Feb 03, 2013"

Just on the nose alone, you know this one will be good. Tastes great! Terrific presence of the malt early, and then replaced by a nice and strong hop hit, all busy and everything, and sustain of the hops lasts at least five minutes. Great after-follow here, on the bitterness I mean. Wow. Mouthfeel is foamy-creamy and high and roiling but soft and not at all scrubbing. A terrific experience from front to back.

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a beautiful mahogany red with rocky off white head. Aroma is of subdued hops and traces of malt. Taste is bitter hops with a slight sweetness of creamy caramel maltiness and notes of banana. Well balanced in that it is a bitter brew with a touch of sweetness. There is not a lot of complexity to the hops, some notes of fruit and citrus rinds. Fruit notes are subtle hints of pear and pineapple. There is a nice roasted flavor to the malts, which lends strength to the bitterness. Subtle bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of an orange peel. The palate is light and smooth with little carbonation.","SeamusDoyle","Dec 21, 2012"

If you are a fan of IPAs, this one will stun you. There are some drawbacks to this beer (not easily sessionable, does not go well with some food), but very, very few. A legend and definitely worth tracking down and trying if you have not yet done so.","BeerDocT","Nov 14, 2012"

Very nice lacing that stays and stays. The smell is subtle and citrus-y. Despite it's relatively mild aroma, this beer hits the taste buds hard. Man! Bitter and sour--very much like a yellow grapefruit (definitely hop-forward. The taste is complex and deep, but the hops win out big time)--but in a really good way. A great mouthfeel--It completely coats the mouth and the taste lingers for a long time. This beer is hearty, full bodied, creamy and delicious. I have a hard time with IPAs, but this one is amazing! By far the best beer in the fridge at my local shop.","jamisonspitzer","Oct 30, 2012"

I tend to lean towards very hop-centric IPAs with just enough interesting malt flavors to back them up, but this is definitely more on the balanced side. The malt is definitely a big player here, though it's not got an overpowering caramel sweetness that I find in a lot of malt-centric IPAs (supposedly they use Munich rather than crystal malts, which might account for this).","spokeydonkey","Sep 11, 2012"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, citrus zest, and some caramel aromas. Taste is of malt, citrus zest, herbal hops, and a slight brown sugar/caramel flavor on the finish. There is an astringent hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but I am not a fan of the astringent bitterness on this one.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 06, 2012"

The alcohol is nowhere to be found. If you see it anywhere, it’s only in a the finish as a little bit of warmth, but I may be imagining that. At nearly 7% ABV, that’s pretty impressive. Really nice beer. I’m upset at myself for not getting into craft beer sooner and not trying more from Victory while I was in college in Pennsylvania. Oh well. I’ve got a lot of drinking left to do in my career. I’ll get to more from Victory eventually.","BlackBelt5112203","Jun 28, 2012"

This pours a nice amber color with a massive tight foamed tan head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of hops and peppers, a little caramel. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, this one isn't as fresh as some of the ones I've had before but its still great, the hops have died down a little but they're still present, a nice peppery finish along with some sweet caramel backbone. This is great even a little older but amazing when fresh.","DavidST","Jun 19, 2012"

Again this won’t blow any major hopheads away in today’s IPA scene but it’s a very well-made and dependable beer that easy to drink, easily found, and an easy answer when you want a nice hop fix.","tobelerone","May 24, 2012"

Thick dense slightly rocky and glossy off white head which inspires rings of lacing with every sip. SOme fizz in the middle but a very bitter end for the style which is fiesty and certainly blunt. Sort of unsophistaicated and rough for the style but forgetting those constraints this is a very likeable beer which i would gladly have again and again.","Zimbo","Apr 29, 2012"

However I can appreciate that it is a finely crafted beer and would happily grab a sixer of it in a pinch.","mjtiernan","Feb 28, 2012"
4.21,3.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Sipping this brings me back to Sierra Nevada’s Celebration, but without the intense hoppiness. There’s a certain balance to this beer that brings these flavors to a place I wish every IPA could go to: smooth, complex, and with a drinkable hop presence. Victory has seriously bottled excellence here.","BarryMFBurton","Feb 28, 2012"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall: A very interesting IPA indeed. It doesn't finish with a strong bite like you would expect, rather it hits you right up front and fades into a bubbly sweetness. I got this in a make your own 6 pack, and I'm glad I did. Not sure if I'd go for a 6 pack of this by itself though.","CPDalton","Feb 28, 2012"

Flavor is very malt forward, caramel, toffee, some sweetness. Hops are not particularly present in the flavor, with little citrus or pine influence. Medium carbonation and heavier on the palate than I expected. Overall I was not impressed with this one and suspect I got an old bottle. Will revisit.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

Smell is of malt, also some citrus hops, I think I detect a little bit of a floral smell in there. Taste definitely pins this as an East-coast IPA, Malts come through well along with the citric and pine hop flavors. Mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected for an IPA. Carbonation is on the mild side. This is a fine beer, but it is hard to stand out when everybody and their dog brews an IPA, compared to the entire field of the style, it is lacking a characteristic to make it stand out.","gkunkle","Jan 16, 2012"

This is darker than Hop Wallop, a reddish copper with a white head. Flavor is super tight, pretty dry, caramel malt with a faint sweetness, a hops are prevalent and throughout the palate a la a fresh harvest ale. I began to appreciate the dryness of this, and the tight balance next to Ranch, which was a hot mess in comparison. Kind of a scaled down version of Hop Wallop, as they're both on the drier side and have a really fresh hop expression that reminds me of harvest ales more than standard American IPA.","JAXSON","Dec 30, 2011"

I am a big Victory fan, have been for years and HopDevil is my favorite hands down. Hopdevil can be consumed all year long becuase it is always available. If you are a hop head this is definitely a beer for you. HopDevil has a wonder hoppy flavor and it is not too over powering in the alcohol department in other words you can drink a 6 pack after work and still drive home for dinner. When a hopDevil is poured into a glass you imediately notice its pleasant smell and its color. The taste is burst of flavors the kick the you know what out of your mouth and tongue. I enjoy fish, steak and poultry while consuming HopDevil. Give it the old college try!!!","jmapple111","Dec 29, 2011"

A flavorful IPA with not too much power, you can drink a few of these. Has a craft taste to it, which I say as a complement, not a criticism. I am fan of most beers from Victory in including one of my favorites, Prima Pils. if you like IPAs that are not over the edge, you probably will enjoy this one thoroughly. Get it on draft and enjoy it that much more.","TheBigBoy","Nov 27, 2011"

The scents of caramel and citrus make for a very enjoyable smell. Malts are surprisingly dominant in the taste, for an IPA. Caramel sweetness is most prominent, with a grapefruit bitterness in the finish that's enough to keep hop heads happy. Nice complexity and good mouthfeel. Not what I was expecting from this IPA, but definitely a pleasant surprise.","DeltaGolfSierra","Sep 30, 2011"
3.33,-18.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Victory Brewing Hop Devil IPA: It’s time to discuss variety, supposedly the spice of life. Do you try a new beer or go with a tried and true beer, which you know is good. Is the reward of discovering a new great beer worth the risk of having a six pack in the fridge that turned out to be a dud? I have decent list of known great IPA’s. Why try yet another, like the Hop Devil? Well I did. The Hop Devil, once in the glass, has a brown color, very dark for an IPA, and an off-white head. The aroma is more of roasted malt than aromatic hop. The flavor has a back bone of roasted malt, but prominent throughout is a lot of hop bitters. It’s a good IPA, but not as balanced as others and missing the really aromatic flavorful hops that I prefer to have come out in an IPA. So in this case, I should have stayed with one of my tried and true standards in the IPA world. Such are the risks of beer exploration.","iSip","Sep 30, 2011"

4.43,8.8,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Pours a beautifully clear amber with a two finger head that sticks around. There are tons of tiny bubbles rising to the top. A beautiful spectacle indeed! The aroma is caramel, molasses, citrus, and some pine. Nothing overwhelming, but nice nonetheless. The taste is pine and citrus. I can't really pinpoint what kind of citrus I am tasting, but I am not getting grapefruit. This is a pretty bitter beer, but the malt sweetness really balances it out. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is medium. Overall, one of the best IPA's out there. My only complaints is the mouthfeel. I prefer a thicker mouthfeel. The taste is spot on for the style and there are very few IPA's in my area (South Florida) that top this one. Extremely drinkable and highly recommend.","hmf05","Sep 27, 2011"

This remained so without crossing over into the realm of the Black IPAs, which can have the malts overshadowing the necessary hoppy components themselves. This brew did exactly the opposite, in that all the flavors of the traditional IPA were retained, with big hops being showcased. Additionally, the aroma was clean throughout, and the tannin like slickness at the end helped to put this beer above the competition.","TheBrewo","Aug 24, 2011"

Nice deep hoppiness that leaves the mouth pleasantly satiated. Leaves a ""peppery"" good medium-lasting bitter finish. For an IPA, the hops are worked in nicely, and not overwhelmingly off-balance in any way. Nice job here.

Smells of bread, malt, caramel, and a hint of bitterness. Didn't catch much hop aroma as I would expect from an IPA. The taste is spot on for a good balanced IPA. Upfront you get a sweet malty taste that is balanced very well with a bitter backbone. Mouthful seems fine, good crisp finish and good carbonation. Overall a damn good beer. Great staple beer to keep in the fridge.","brian44556","Aug 14, 2011"

The bitterness is smoothed out by such a big malty body and fruity aroma hops. I had to be careful with this one the other night. 6.7% and such a smooth body and fruity character it went down fast.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 13, 2011"

Wow, what a nice balance. Not too little, and not too much of anything. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost creamy, and compliments the wonderful hop nose and long puckering aftertaste. I think when fresh this is certainly one of the best American IPA's that money can buy. Another high quality beer from Victory brewing co. Hmm, what could be better, maybe Hopdevil on cask?!?

A very malt dominated beer with very little of the hop characteristics I expect from an American IPA. Its medium bodied and has a little sour and acid aftertaste.

The taste of the beer has an interesting spicy hoppiness to it. There is a light maltiness in the flavor as well but mostly a very strong hop flavor throughout. The mouthfeel was is medium bodied and has a nice stinging on the tongue from the carbonation and hops. Overall it's an impressive IPA and really worth looking into.","Knapp85","Jun 07, 2011"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4," This is a far more than solid craft beer here. It features the typically hoppy bitterness and a citrus grapefruit tinge as well. But adding to that, I sense a certain heavier ""spiciness"" of some sort that I've just never placed in a previously sampled India Pale Ale. What that spiciness is, I just can't put my finger on it, at least not just yet.

The majority coming through as citrusy grapefruit along with a touch of pine and floral characteristic in there as well. The taste matches the smell with a ton of bright hops coming through with flavors ranging from citrus to pine and floral. Despite the hop centric focus this beer is amazingly well balanced. The hops are backed by a solid maltiness with enough sweetness to match the high IBUs. Body is medium to full with a dry bitter finish that lasts.

It's actually an interesting take on an IPA because of that burnt, roasted caramel malt taste that goes along with the whole flowers they use.

Here the beer was a dark brown color with moderate. This beer was delicious as always. With German imported Malts this weights in at a 6.7% ABV. The first time I had this beer was at the Las Vegas Lounge in Philly. I was working as a File Clerk in Philly at the time and Victory was much less known in 2006.

The beer is definitely redder than most Ca IPAs meaning it has more caramel and toasty malt flavors. The hops though really sing, they have a rich woody and earthy edge, probably from the cask dry hopping, and it is just a strong manly flavor. If they made a cologne from this beers bouquet I would buy it. It has the citrus peel, freah cut grass, and damp oak leaf thing going one.

The spice is present in the aftertaste, and the finish is smooth and creamy. Light hops are consistent throughout the beer, helping to balance the other flavors.

Taste starts off with a hint of malt sweetness, but then the feeling delves right into assertive hops. Some of grapefruit, some of pine, some that should probably have an MSDS tag on them. A lot of spice on the backend, with a bitter, spiky aftertaste that last for a while. In my eyes, this is a menacing IPA indeed. Good.","sixerofelixir","Jan 18, 2011"

Smell is a powerfully juicy citrus hop aroma with a solid caramel, sugary sweet malt. Wonderful aroma. Taste is classic IPA, with a moving hops complexity. Again, good balance (for an IPA), interplay with the richer malts. Quite aggressively hopped. Feel is rough, a little too much ""buzzsaw"" feel with the hoppiness. Appropriate thickness, but the alpha oil burn is distracting and just a bit uncomfortable. Drinkability remains good, from the aroma alone. A solid East Coast IPA, another solid brew from Victory.

Some light malt character in aroma. Smells like there might be a very very faint spicey note in aroma. As beer warms, aroma becomes more tropical. Good carbonation; Crisp mouthfeel and haldway through the glass can swirl and get a 1/2 off-white head. Slightly spicey middle, darker sweetness on the beginning, still cirtusy though. Floral end with a grassy finish. With warmth end seems to have a banana hint to hit Hoppy Dry finish, feels like thin silkiness that lasts.

Some unusual aromas for an IPA but enticing nonetheless. Flavour is pine, caramel, slight woodiness, spicy and grassy hops, firm malt sweetness, bitter and citric finish, somewhat astringent. IBUs are apparent on the palate. Mouthfeel is prickly spiciness upfront, medium body, crisp carbonated bite with a juicy and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste.

Nice stuff, even for something not as fresh as it probably should be. Taste is quite bitter up front, and the hops are well known. More citrus here, and at points I want to think the bitterness borders on something potentially enamel ripping when fresh (for an IPA at least). Similar hop profile to what I've noticed in a variety of Victory beers (at least in Prima Pils and Hop Wallop at this point). Long bitter and drying finish.

I wish I could pick up what hops are used in this, but the only hint I can say with some certainty is that there is some Chinook in here. I probably haven't been able to brew with the other hops used here (Nuggett? Some English hops?) The drinkability on this one is just what you'd expect for an IPA. Good alcohol content, and a great body that makes this a great drink even in hot weather. A beer I'd get again in a heartbeat.","Prostman81","Jul 22, 2010"

Also some citrus notes mixed in. Taste starts off surprisingly matly with a bready, caramel sweetness. Not huge malt, but nice. Then the hops kick in. Floral hops, pine and earthy notes create a big hop flavor and citrus also contributes late. Finishes a little bitter and dry, but goes down very well for the style.

The beginning fruit flavors of this ale remind me a lot of an English one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, low carbonation. Good Drinkability.

Bready, doughy almost a skunky beer smell. I wasn't really impressed with the taste. I was expecting a major hop explosion but it was not to be. Subdued hops are present with a lot of maltiness going on. There is an odd aftertaste which is present far too long.

The beer does have pretty good lacing though. The aroma is malty for an American IPA, which is to say, while there is plenty of citrus and pine aroma, there is also decent amount caramel malt in the nose as well as a touch of spice. Taste is quite different from a lot of other IPAs and very nice. Well balanced with a nice hop flavor. White grapefruit and pine mingle well with the substantial malt backbone that consists of some caramel, some biscuit and a bit of spice. Yum! Firm bitterness lends to a nice finish in this IPA which I would describe to be on the lighter side of medium. Definitely drinkable and a session beer for a hop head like me. This and Two Hearted are what got me into IPAs and I had forgotten what a great beer this is.

Smells of bitter, piney hops and sugary amber malts. The balance is pretty nice here and the strength is not bad for either element. I like my beer to have a strong nose, this one is rather fulfilling. The malt element is a bit too sweet to blend in very well, still a good nose though. The hops are also a bit one dimensional. The taste is strange in this beer. It is not the hoppiest beer I have had by far but the hops are incredibly bitter and piney. I also get some orange peel and citrus notes. They dont mask the malts completely but the hop profile itself isn't balanced enough. I still enjoy the beer but it is definitely performs a beat down on my taste buds. Also, they obviously meant for this to have a huge hoppiness. Mouthfeel is rather nice, the body is moderate and the carbonation is appropriate for the taste. The only thing here is the relentless bitterness attack on the tongue. No warming to speak of. This one would be hard to session for me because of the bitterness on the tongue.

This particular HopDevil had an ""Enjoy By"" Date of Aug 19, 2007. Well that was over two years ago, but I was interested in how this might have aged. It was amazing! The hops had mellowed significantly letting the strong malt presence take center stage. The aroma is dominated by sweet floral honey and only a mild dose of citris. The flavor is similar, with a pronounced malt sweetness up front, balanced by alcohol and a spicy hop finish. This was almost a sipping beer that got even better as it warmed.

I generally like malts more than hops so the balance in this beer suited my tastes.

I guess I let the hype get to me because I'm still a bit disappointed. I even refused to review the first two times I tried it, thinking that the bottles weren't fresh enough, but, alas, it's a good IPA that still doesn't knock my socks off. There's a fairly strong malt backbone and a healthy hop bitterness, but neither element is extraordinary. If you're into balanced bitterness, this is probably your thing. For me, it lacks the delicate hop flavors that I really love in an IPA. That's certainly not to say that HopDevil is a bad beer. It nearly has the malt backbone of an amber ale. The hops are fairly strong, if a bit one note. It's easy to drink and quite pleasant.","popery","Aug 25, 2009"

3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Brick red with an ambery sheen and a smallish beige head, difficult to judge from the English hand-pump pour. Very malty in the nose with lots of toasted grain as well as ripe fruits like cherries and apples that synthesize into a pie-like character. Citric hops combine with dark sugars and an unexpected vanilla note to produce hints of cola. Tastes as it smells, lovely, bready, nutty, and bitter with fruity pear, grape, and grapefruit undertones, a hearty almond flavor and a sharp hop bite. However, it's not so sharp that it cuts through the malts - it mostly just perforates them. A bit thick on the palate, which tips the scales in favor of malty sweetness - this would probably be better served another way so that the carbonation makes more of an impact. Still, a very good quaffer.","soulgrowl","Jul 04, 2009"

Nose suggests some grapefruity hops, with caramel on a malty backbone, suggesting sweet flavors in the mouth. Taste consistent with nose - some hops upfront, but finishes malty sweet with just a light bitterness that doesn't linger. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a pleasant, consistent background effervescence. Nice drinkability, but this is not your typical IPA.

There's some malt in there, but it's desperately trying to hold its own against the hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a medium amount of carbonation.

I get the malt flavor too, a bit tannic, but has a nice roasted, burnt flavor that I can totally deal with... In fact, I like that in this beer, the toasted malt complements the hop characteristics... A lot can be said on the floral, citrus, and grapefruit notes of the hops, but the main point of this beer is that its over balanced, hop wise.

The aroma was excellent for the style, lots of herbal and citrus hops with a pale malt backbone. The flavors were at first notably bitter, with lots of orange rind and grapefruit notes, but behind that lurked the flavors of other hops clearly reflecting the multiple additions used. As it warmed I tasted more of the doughy malt along with some crystal malt and the herbal elements of hops that came through. Acidic and a little biting; great for hop heads.

A few sips and it hits me that I'm getting a strong dosage of aged cheese, maybe gouda, and maybe a little spoiled milk. A hint of smoke, though I may be confusing the aged cheese scent for smoke. Interestng, though not typical for an IPA. Not sure what to make of this so far. Taste is a little underwhelming up front. Hops are present in the palate, but don't match the smell in strength. Finsih finally brings the hops out the citrusy hop flavors, with a nice lingering bitterness. I am really a big hop head, so I tend to be rough of run-of-the-mill IPAs, that have just basic hoppiness. I'd put this beer in that category. Mouthfeel is light, with a little oily, creamy, texture. Decent IPA, but not the one for me. Not to worry, there are plenty of IPAs in the sea.","TheDoorman","Jan 23, 2009"

Nose is a dominating raw maltiness with the characteristic floral hops nearly absent. The taste does not add much complexity; very little hop bitterness follows. Where exactly is this hop devil hiding? Maybe I'm spoiled by the hop blasts I'm used to from the American IPAs, but this one just isn't done to style.

Full-bodied, bitter in spite of a softer underbelly, hops still outdistancing the malts, albeit some roasty notes appear at the end. Orange and white grapefruit citrus with fewer baking spices here. Suggestion of pine tar along with generalized herbaceousness. Carbonation goes a long way to making a whole glass drinkable. Intensely aggressive beer.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"

There is the malt sweetness and toasted grain aromas. This is countered with the grassy and pine smell from the hops. The taste is the same. Caramel sweetness and slight roastedness appear up front but this quickly takes a back seat. Stepping up are the hops. Spicy hops and earthy flavors from the hops take over in the aftertaste. The body is medium which is what you would expect from the style. This beer is a staple of sorts. Always easy to reach for when not sure what to get.","hops4me","Jan 03, 2009"

3.91,-3.9,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a light, clear orange amber colour, with a few fingers of pillowy white head, which sticks around for more than a few minutes, and leaves a fair amount of soap bubble lacing around the glass. It smells faintly of grapefruit hops, and not much else, even as it warms. The taste starts with a grassy, flinty hop dryness, that moves to include more resinous pine bitterness, before washing over a thin caramel malt backbone to the lip-smackingly dry hop finish. The carbonation is understated, allowing the hops to remain the star of this show. The body is a wee bit less than full, but, for the style, I suppose it is just right. There is no noticeable warming from the elevated alcohol. For the strong, but not overpowering, hop goodness, and the smooth mouthfeel, this is quite a decently drinkable IPA.","biboergosum","Dec 23, 2008"

The aroma has a pronounced citrus kick but doesn't really lend itself to the naming of any specific fruit. Also the malt backbone makes its presence known in the aroma.

Taste is a good balance of malt and hops, pine, citrus, fruity sweetness, with definite sharpness in the finish. I do not know much about IPAs, but this is one of the better that I have had.

While it's certainly bitter, I find this very drinkable compared to some of the West Coast IPA's that just hit you over the head with a bunch of hops.

The drinkability is rather fair in my opinion, not something I'd run out for but it's pleasant enough that a coupla these aren't the worst thing that could happen to a person at the end of the workday.

The taste is a faraway battle between the undermanned hops and the bolder carmel malt that is the victor in this uneven match over the IPA. Although smooth taste, overall its not the outcome that I would prefer. Mouthfeel is quite balanced, but maybe a bit under-carbonated.

The smell was strong and quite pleasant: earthy, hoppy punch, with plenty of pine flavor, but a dash of sweetness. It was complex and complimentary, and the taste proved to be so as well. The taste had massive amounts of hop power, as you can imagine. It was fresh, and perfectly combined the floral, sweeter hops with grassy, bitter ones. Also, the are sharp citrus flavors as well, like grapefruit and orange. There was a sweet, caramel-like malt base that was simply perfect: not too sweet, not too bready, just right. The drinkability is fantastic: it's so hoppy it's spicey, so I couldn't drink it too quickly, but it still goes down smooth and easy, with the the other flavors coming in.

It's amazing that the amount of hop flavors present in this fine brew find a way to meld and flow ever so gently. I poured this into a standard pint glass and a rather nice burnt orange copper color produced a nice white head. Crazy amounts of lacing creates a spiderweb effect down the glass. Aroma is bursting with bitter and citrus hops, euphoria tickles my senses from scent alone. As I drink this I take bigger swigs and am rewarded with a refreshing sensation. A full malt presence is recognizable but it just can't compete with the generous portion of hops added to this ale.

It smells of piney citrus, but not in the same fresh biting way that a lot of IPA's come off. This one has more of a mellow and rich smell that rides atop a grainy backbone. The taste is more of the same. The hops are first and foremost, but there is a complexity here that leaves you looking forward to the next as soon as you finish the first. The malts provide just the right amount of balance in the sense that the scales are definitely tipped to the hops, but they bring their malty friend along to mellow out the finish with an earthy graininess that provides the perfect yang for their yin. Great beer, enough said.","Godot","Jul 11, 2008"
3.18,-21.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A two-finger tan head tops off a honey brown brew. Head fades slowly leaving some crooked lacing all around the glass. Citrusy hops rise to the nose, but not as striking as I would have imagined with a name like ""Hopdevil"". Behind the hop start is some tea, orange peel, sour grapes and sweet bread. The hoppiness is kept in check by a certain malty sweetness that makes it go down somewhat smoother than expected. Carbonation is adequate in this medium-bodied brew.","stephens101","Jul 10, 2008"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer has a very fruity malty flavour to it, with a huge bitterness from the hops. This is a quite unique IPA to me because of the hopiness being more bitter and less aromatic. The bitterness in this beer is just awesome, it's a nice change up from all of the aroma hopped beers. The mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of carbonation. The bitterness makes this beer drinkable.","swizzlenuts","Jul 09, 2008"

3.74,-8.1,5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours amber to red in color with an off-white head that has some staying power. Some lace is left behind as the head falls adding to the appearance. Muted fruity hop aroma; this must be an older bottle. Hop flavor is still fairly bright. Bitterness is somewhat less than I expected or remembered from a previous tasting. Mouthfeel is about right; slightly full. There's a bit of tannin from somewhere that dries out the tongue a bit. The hop flavor is rather interesting...I can't quite place it, but I'm going with grapefruit and it's a fairly strong flavor. There's a candy-like sweetness there, too, no doubt from the caramel malts that also give the beer it's color. By the time I'm half way through this beer there's rings of Brussels lace left behind. Nice. The aroma has opened up a bit and is a touch perfume or talc like; or dusty. Finish is a bit quick, at least in terms of bitterness, but hoppiness lingers. This is a good beer, but almost a pale ale by contemporary hop head standards.","marcobrau","Jul 05, 2008"

The beer finishes even more bitter than it begins. The beer was well carbonated leaving behind a slick piney feel. Sorry to say a was a bit disappointed by this one.

The mouthfeel is kind of thin and watery but still above average. Drinkability is good, very balanced.

Your girlfriend who drinks Blue Moon won't like this beer. There is a nice sweet malt follow up that perfectly complements the hop dominance.

The nose is distinct pink grapefruit with a spicy citrus rind backdrop and maybe a hint of pine needles. The alcohol is well hidden with a sweet grapefruit taste, assertive hops, flashes of butterscotch. The mouthfeel throughout remains hoppy and crisp with a bitter-sweet lingering finish.

Then a herbal bitterness of grass and pine comes in midway, leaving a a bit of an after taste. A medium bodied feel is consistant all the way through, but it does leave an oily feel at the back end. This is a very easy to drink beer, impressive in the flavor and aroma, though the feel was very good, the oily texture was a sligtht tyrn off.

The hops linger leaving a nice little twang in the mouth once it's down the throat but not anything shouting too loud ""I'm 6.7% abv"" the way a bunch of others do. Nice medium body...not too fizzy nor too oily. The only complain I have is the name Hop Devil itself. After all it's got a hop bud fancied as a devil's face on the label. Off the name alone I was expecting something a bit more over the top and maybe a belly ache/esophagus fire the next day like a Two Hearted Ale (which are a treat once every few month or so but I still would prefer not get stuck with entirely for an evening cuz after a few they fall under the ""a bit too much"" category for me) or the ""This rules but where is the fine line between it and barley wine?"" thing of Hop Slam (Yeah...I realize I used tow different things Bell's makes as my reference point. Hey! I'm Michigan born and raised! Homeland pride brothers and sisters!!!) at first and that was what I was prepared for. I don't feel let down at all that this is a bit more mellow than that...An almost perfect mellow as a matter of fact....A mellow that I can share with friends who are even of the too much persuasion as well as those that like the bite. No matter the season either.

The taste is grapefruit rind up front and center, a decent toasted malt backbone, some resin. I just discovered that this is an old bottle so some of the fresh hop taste is obviously gone, arg! Still a good hop flavor, though. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture, there is a bitterness that kind of numbs the palate.

Some citrus fruit mixed in with the malts, but not as grapefruity as others. The bitterness takes over to dominate in a big way, however, about halfway through -- almost on the level of a Smutty or a Bell's 2-Hearted.

Piney, resiny hops on the nose, with just a touch of biscuit and caramel in the malt profile. Spicey hops are all over the first sip, and the mouthfeel seems fairly light and cleansing. Mild, lingering bitterness with toasted malts almost floating above the aromatic and bittering hops. Not a small beer and not a big beer, but right in-between, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Semi-sweet, with a nice juicy malt quality registering about halfway through the palate. Medium bodied, and much more well-balanced than I recall it being from the last bottle I enjoyed.

Toasty caramel maltmakes an entrance in the background, along with a bit of vanilla and yeasty breadiness, but the malt is definitely playing second violin here. Less balanced than I would have hoped, but it's not a huge criticism really. Mouthfeel is buzzy due to the high acid levels, not so much from the carbonation, which is medium at best.

The taste is citrusy and pine hops (grapefruit) with a bit of malt, but it's the hops that are the most noticable. Very nice bitter taste too.

After getting over the hops, I tasted some fruit in the beer. As for the drinkability, I did not notice how much I had in one instance until I looked at the glass.

Good looking creamy head that hangs around for a while. The smell is more malty than hoppy to be honest. I'm wondering where the hops went. Taste is also lacking that crisp hop kick that I've accustomed myself to. They are there but well covered by a malty sweetness. It kinds of seems slightly watered down a little. Not sure what the deal is here. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and I can get a better sense of the hops. Solid. Pretty drinkable beer in the end. It doesn't stand up to what I drank before it but I can't complain. Well, one complaint. It was a dollar more...which I couldn't come to understand at $4.50.

The consistency of the foam is creamy but not bitter, unfortunately it dies down to a thin film after a few sips. The smell is a hit of hops to the nose with a subtle caramel undertone. The taste is not overpowering and has a distinct hop taste on the front of the tongue and lingers with bitter notes in the aftertaste, though not at all unpleasant. The mouthfeel is a little above average due to the malt needed to balance out the high IBUs of the brew. Very drinkable as it is not heavy and does not impart a sour taste in the mouth, but at 6.7% ABV, moderation is golden! A great offering from Victory and the beer stands up to the hype with all of the awards it has garnered.","DevilDogBeer","Jan 29, 2007"
4.73,16.2,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Served at about 50-55 degrees, the appearance was a deep ruby amber. Full, thick and creamy head. Tons of retention and Belgian lace down the pint. Not quite as big a nose than from the tap, but still lots of citrus hop scents. The taste was next to perfect for an IPA. The higher serving temperature and lower carbonation allowed for an incredible mix of malt sweetness and spicy hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is bready, but the hops still dominate with a biting spiciness, with both grapefruit and pine flavors, followed by a lingering alcohol aftertaste. With such a smooth and chewy mouth-feel you can only get from beer from the engine, I wish all beers could be served this way.","IgnatiusReilly","Jan 28, 2007"

Some citrus notes, bitter smelling, no floral or fruit in the nose at all, disappointing. It is a shocking beer to the palate, all hops. Very blunt up front, citrusy, it seems as if the hop bitterness is overwhelming the hop flavor. Spicy hot from the hops, and they manage to cover the malt almost completely. Not well balanced. Could have used some more base malt in my estimation, because kicking it up to eight percent may have balanced this beer more. Worth the try, but I would not purchase this beer again.","adammills","Jan 23, 2007"

This was the first time I'd seen Victory in my general area so I was eager to see what all the BA hype was all about. I was not disappointed. The beer was very complex and strong without being over complicated or affecting its drinkability. The hops were prevalent and plentiful, but not without just enough maltiness for proper balance on both the nose and tongue. Mouthfeel was great with a medium body, perfect carbonation and viscosity. I found it to be a very smooth drinking IPA for one that has a little more ABV than a typical session beer. The results of which could result in not exactly looking or feeling one's best the next a.m. All in all I was glad to get to finally try a Victory brew, and I will have to return for some Prima Pils when I get a chance.

I stopped by Barcade in Brooklyn where they had it casked. A deep ruby, colored somewhere in between a Brown ale and a Red. The aroma was very hop-rich, with subtle hints of sweetness. By smell alone you could definitely tell that it had been casked. Upon the first sip the hop pronunciation and earthy cask flavor were very bold, yet well balanced on the tongue.

It falls pretty quickly, which hurts it a bit, but the sticky lacing helps to make up for it. The beer is a bright golden amber. Smell is strong of sweet caramel and a lovely hop combination. The hops are initially biting and bitter on the tongue, and then the beer gets smooth in a very nice way that is so much fun to repeat. The hops really build in the back of your throat, perhaps slowing consumption a bit. I end up liking this more each time!","mjc410","Aug 22, 2006"

Pours a beautiful dark amber, with slight head that laced well. Light carbonation. Medium aroma of hops. Full, somewhat warming, bitter hoppy taste - but not overly complex, and not as fruity as I prefer in this type of beer. This beer was enjoyed after a 20 minute walk home from the store on a warm night, so perhaps it should have been consumed a few degrees cooler - although I'm generally a fan of cellar-temperature beers.

The brew has a very green resin/floral scent AND a good malty, perhaps even roasted odor. This decoction actually has a lot more malt and a bit less hops than one might suspect. Placating your taste buds with strong roasted malts, with hints of caramel, approaching treacle, there is also quite a bit of resinous hops to fulfill the need of those who like, well, hoppy beers. This beer is only for those who truly appreciate the joys of strong hops, but it is a well balanced version of high hop holies. Not intended for all dining occasions...I would recommend it specifically with red meat.","Rootdog316","Jul 21, 2006"

Felt slightly creamy with some bite and carbonation in the mouth. Drinkability: sure! The victory brewers knew just what they were doing when they came up with this one.

A faint hint of Grapefruit is the only citrus note. Hops hit the palate and linger like a bad habit. The finish is more intense than the initial bitterness. A good froth while almost chewing and rolling this ale elicits a few malt flavors. I had this for the first time over three years ago but forgot how the hops literally bite back on the finifsh.

Hops nose was not as pronounced as the hop flavor which was strong and complex/deep. Slight ashen flavor from the yeast, and the malt was typical for the style. A nice entry in the category and surely drinkable, but not quite blown away as some folks seem to be. Could be fermented cleaner as it had a slight funk to it.","mooner","Jun 16, 2006"

Aroma is pure hop resins, and nothing more. Taste is pure hoppiness after the malt makes a minimal showing. Definitely a coppery amber/pale ale backdrop that is good, but this is not my favorite hop profile. Resinous and slightly juicy, no notable spiciness, grassiness, or floral overtones. This is not 60 minute IPA of course, and it's not exactly a hop bomb, but there are plenty of hops. The more you sip, the more the hops seemed to loose intensity, and the malt body and flavor was more detectable. Mouthfeel is medium with a desirable amount of carbonation. Overall, this is not my choice for an IPA, thought it's a solid version, and probably somewhat traditional despite favoring american hops rather than english or more noble hops, I gather.","Liquids","Jun 16, 2006"

The grapefruit aroma was very pronounced and a little sharp compared to what I remember from the bottled version. The same grapefruit character was in the flavour as well, along with a very solid, caramel, malty backbone to balance the ample bitterness. It felt very full in the mouth as well - I was a little surprised since many beers I've tried on cask seem a little thinned out without the extra carbonation. Overall, quite excellent! I'm sure the guys back in Toronto will be jealous.","DrJay","Apr 23, 2006"

A little hops in the nose. Flavor was nice smooth caramel and grapefruit. A little spice maybe clove or anise. I felt it had a very good blend that went down smooth.

This beer pours a very bright amber with a decent, foamy head that dissipates only after a while. The nose is big and fruity with hops, and they have an acidic bite to them that packs a real wallop. Underneath the hops is a slight bready malt aroma. The palate is extremely bitter, with the hops assaulting the tongue immediately. The hops flavors are quite bitter but not acridly so. There's very little malt balance to this beer, but the hop flavors are good enough to compensate. The mouthfeel is quite smooth in spite of the hop burst. I'm really impressed.

Plenty of hops on the nose that are very citrusy. Hint of grainy malt. There's something else that's sweet. Perhaps it's just the malt. Hops steal the show from the very beginning of the taste. They are very spicy and a tad fruity. There's really not enough malt flavor to mention. I don't give a damn though because this beer is tasty enough without perfect balance! Creamy mouthfeel with absolute bitterness in the finish. Immediately after swallowing the hops are easy and not too bad but you wait five seconds and they attack. Wow. This is a great beer.

Smell was very citrusy, with loads of grapefruit flavors as well as some grassy earth tones here and there as well. You could also smell a nice spicy aroma from the hops that lent itself well to the overall presence of this beer. Taste was excellent...hop presence was exceptionally executed with prickly spices and earth flavors gliding in and around the palate. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, any lighter or heavier and i think they would have overdone it a bit. This beer will certainly challenge the palate, but I would not call this a difficult beer to drink. Pair this one up with some mildly spicy chicken wings and taste how the hops compliment the flavor.","jamie2dope","Feb 05, 2006"

Begins with a sweet caramel taste, followed by a delicious orange rind and pine sap bitterness. The malt character is mild, but appropriate and balanced for the style.

Hits you with a bit of bitterness, alright- definitely a little on the coarse side, but not too much. I must have a slightly older body, the general hop flavor is less pronounced than the bitterness; it's all bitter citrus peel here. A little malt underneath to balance things out; a bit of toast grain flavor as well. Feels nice in the mouth- not too thick or thin. Easy enough to drink, but not sure I'd crave another. Pretty darn good for the style.","amicar","Jan 02, 2006"

The hops bitterness takes over the taste but it isn't the typical citrus/pine hops. Definately more spicey and nutty than what i would expect from an ipa. The bitterness sticks with you but not a good way. I can see how this would appeal to some but not what I look for in an ipa at all.

The overall IPA flavor here is a little different than most that I've sampled, the bitterness is a bit intrusive, still I really enjoyed HopDevil, but its not my favorite.

It brings a lot of balance to the beer, it is very tasty and sweet, but thats not really what I want in an IPA. Hops...thats what I want. The mouthfeel is good. Light to medium and clean.

The color is a pleasing dark amber. The head disappears quickly, but there is ample lacing on the glass. The fact that I was in a smoke-filled bar probably accounts for the minimal smell of this beer. The taste on the other hand is instantly memorable. There is an intense hop burst up front, combined with a citrussy piney flavor, which is balanced by a notable malt undertone. THIS is what an IPA should taste like!

Not as full as I was hoping for. The taste came on very floral and finished with a rough hop bitterness. The hops are very concentrated in the center of the mouth and finish through decently. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. The hops give way to a small amount of maltiness that comes through as it warms up. I have had much better and much worse IPAs.

However, this is nothing to write home about. Overall an average IPA that happens to be highly hopped. Victory is a great brewery and I think their pils is the best in the world. There is no way this beer should be rated higher than the pils. Anyone can make a decent and hoppy IPA.

Hops hit hard and persist throughout. The difference is that it just tastes a bit more complex and untamed than normal hopdevil. I must say that what really stikes me about this beer more than anything else is the mouthfeel- heavy and creamy and just fantastic. Perhaps the best mouthfeel of any beer I've tried.

There seems to be a very nice malt presence backing everything up. The taste is very nice. Citrus juiciness, oranges and grapefruits. A beautiful malt base appears in the middle and softens everything. It finishes with a gentle hop bitternesss. This is a truly great tasting IPA. There is a ton of hoppiness in it, yet it never falls into the common IPA trap of becoming too harsh. I guess the malt base is sturdy enough to support the hoppiness while keeping it gentle. Very drinkable. I would love the chance to try this on cask, it seems tailor made for it. Also of note is the freshness date on the bottle keeping you from buying old stock.

There's also a strong earthy hop character thrown in for good measure. Fairly well balanced as the malts make a strong showing, and the bitterness never overwhelms.

Needless to say this beer is very hoppy, followed by a little too much bitterness IMO, but nonetheless a good tasting beer; mainly characterized by a peachy infused body.

The hops are not overly oily, but they do coat nicely and end leaving some bitterness behind. The finish also has taste which I can only describe as sweetly acidic, like an apple with the skin still on it. Overall a very drinkable IPA with a very pleasing hop profile.

Drinkability is pretty good, as this is alot more balanced that I expected from an IPA.

It pours a beautiful orange tinged ruby red but is lacking any significant head, only a slightly off-white wispy foam covering. Aroma is a citrusy hop blast but with more of a caramel malt backing than some more aggressive ipa's like Alpha King. Taste belies the aggressive hop aroma, I find that this is a very well balanced IPA with enough caramel flavors to offset the massive amount of hops. The mellow citrus/pine flavors finish with just a hint of spiciness. Mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer of almost 7 percent, but all around this is an excellent IPA which won't peal the enamel off of your teeth.","soper2000","Aug 06, 2005"

Hops come on strong: resinous and bitter. Good balance. Finish dries out with faded cookie malt. My tongue is hop-numbed. Medium to full body, with a creamy feel up front that moves to almost oily.

Tastes just crisp enough, lots of grapefruit and tons of hop aftertaste, although not as much as you'd expect from the name. Very dry and refreshing.

The beer is dry and has a cinnamon quality about it, as well as some tannin. The ending is caramelly sweet sugary with a citrus aftertaste. A nice easy drinking beer that's really tasty.

Smell is a little weak overall but good nonetheless. I pick up some floral and pine hop aromas over a nice sweet bread-like malt base. This one presents itself with an initial spiciness on the tongue and back of the mouth with pine overtones which transitions over to a very bitter resin finish which lingers for a long while. A very balanced beer as it is hoppy enough to seem bitter while still containing some maltyness in the background. Mouthfeel is as good as they come with an IPA, full and coats the palate well. I think this is one of the more full bodied IPAs Ive had. Drinkability is very good as well due to the nicely crafted balanced.

The taste of hops will coat your tongue long after the last sip is gone. Overall: FANTASTIC!!! I'm not a hop-head, but I love this beer.

I love the balance of this beer, you cant miss the big hops in the glass, rich amber color and floral bouquet, the smell of hops wafting from my glass. But the balance in the mouth is perfect.

Taking a sip it comes very smooth and hoppy up front with a buttery feel throughout the swallow. A bit of sugar on the finish along with the citrus tones (underlying).

Hoppy up front with a very bready malt flavor in the middle and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is cask goodness, drinkability does not waver. Three serving types and three 4.5's across this board.

Nice malty sweet and flowery nose with a subtle hint of diacetyl and light caramelization. Very well-balanced flavor with great cherry-caramel maltiness and subdued hop profile for an American IPA. This review is based on a less than fresh sample consumed two weeks after the drink before date and I actually prefered this one over the many fresh samples that I've had in the past. Moderate cellaring took some edge off of the hop character and really opened up the malt base.

Its definitely less focused on the Grapefruity Cascades than Liberty Ale (one of the only other APAs Ive tried). The intense hoppyness is kept to heel by a big bold maltiness, theres graham crackers and a nuttyness in the malt profile. The carbonation is soft making for a very subtle medium bodied mouthfeel.

It has a well ballanced taste, for something that is called ""HopDevil""; the hops are definitly there, but I was plesantly suprised to have such a balance of the two.

This is a reasoable stong beer that I consider almost too easy to drink. I've been having this beer since it's inception, and it is a good, reasonably priced staple beer. Only problem with it is that I've burnt myself out on it. Flipsiding the coin, I sincerely thank Victory and its PA distributors on burning me out on quality and its ready availability.","crookedhalo","Aug 08, 2004"

As my handle suggests, I'm not too much of a hophead - I still think the mouthfeel is a little too oily, and the drinkability, for me at least, is pretty much limited to having one or two with dinner. (having said that, it goes great with food, I made some Italian last night and it went wonderfully with the olive oil...)

The aroma had a strong floral and citrus hop note that did not seem as pungent as when served from a bottle. The taste, a sharp hop hit up front that dominated most of the experience, but I was able to catch enough of a malt taste that tries to balance it out, it fails but with this type of brew that is expected. The finish is still hop, a nice finish to this brew. Ok, now for the thing that has kind of thrown me a bit, I like this brew better from the bottle. Not sure if this brew was getting to its last legs at Mahars but it seemed to lack the character of the bottled version that I know much better.

This is one of those beers I appreciated more and more the more I drank. It left me longing for more. Much to my delight, they now distribute to Ohio. I must admit that overall, I wasn't impressed with many of Victory's other beers.

At its coldest, it doesn't appear too complex: the malts and hops are dominant and at first do not offer any other characteristics. As it warms mid glass, the above-average alcohol becomes evident, but balances perfectly with the malts and hops. Orange zest flavors start to sneak in at the finish.","JimsArcade","Feb 24, 2004"

It pours a cloudy golden orange colour with a head that doesn't last at all. The smell- oh, the smell- it's like sticking your nose into a packet of hops when you homebrew. And that reminds me of the beauty of hops. I suppose I'll have to be a hopdevil worshipper for this one based solely on the smell. The taste is excellent, smooth and malty, and continuing to the bitterness of the hops while leaving a balanced, yet hoppily bitter, aftertaste in the mouth. It almost has citrusy overtones during the intense hop rush. I hadn't realized this was 6.7 ABV otherwise I'd have bought another for tonight. There's always tomorrow. With the grand rush of hops, I hoppily look forward to more intense IPA's.","twilight","Jan 07, 2004"

4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice color on this beer as it poured out a orange-goldish color with a head that quickly disappeared, but nice lacing all the way to the very end. Smell..whoa, they don't call it hopdevil ale for nothing. Tons of hops in the smell with some citrus which smells very refreshing. Taste was awesome. Hops attack your tongue then finishs off with some citrus at the end. Extremely refreshing. Finishes dry. This is a IPA done very well. Goes down smooth which leads to a high drinkability. I would recommend this beer for sure!","necoadam","Jan 04, 2004"

Pours a beautiful tangerine amber with a medium light beige head that quickly dissolves into a slick, with lacing all over the glass. The nose, ah yes, the nose. Plenty of hops here...pine, grapefruit, hay, spices, and some mountain meadow florals as well. Mouthfeel is chewy, and won't hardly let go. Thick and coating, with lots of bittering hops and medium carbonation. Hops dominate the flavor profile, but you can taste the malts underneath. This is one tasty IPA! Flavor just keeps improving toward room temperature, but it's all about the hops. Finishes dry and bitter, with a long and complex aftertaste. This is probably the best ""standard"" IPA I've ever tasted. Impressive ale!","merlin48","Dec 31, 2003"

Very pleasnt hop aroma, oily, resiny, citrusy hops. Flavors was bitter as to be expected but along with pale malt on the back end. I felt a slightly gritty aftertaste, almost as if some gypsum was present. Decent beer but jus didn't have much balance for me to call great. I'd like to try it at the brewery to get a better idea of how it is fresh.","CRJMellor","Dec 30, 2003"

The taste is outstanding. It has a good balance of pale and crystal malts which give it a nice mild maltiness. There is a wide array of hop additions here which adds to the flavor and it's uniqueness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation; an outstanding beer for hop lovers. This is a great drinking beer with lots of hops.","WesWes","Dec 29, 2003"
4.21,3.4,5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This one was hazy with a lovely raspberry-red orange hue. The aroma was resiny hops and more hops, I knew this would be the kind of IPA I would like. Tastes of extreme hops with orange and lime citrus notes...a bit astringent. Sounds a bit harsh but it is quite delicious. Its mouthfeel was the weakpoint, a medium body but a bit thin for me for the style. The crispness was pleasant though. Overall a really beautiful and yummy hoppy IPA that I like to keep in stock in my fridge.","HiroProtagonist","Dec 26, 2003"

4.23,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Noses full of candied citrus-flavored Washington hops appear first, then, after tasting, they produce a tarry, resinny bitterness equivalent to licorice or charred pine sap. Heady, perfumy, sweaty hop aromatics define the experience from the nostrils up. There's texture here, but, despite its grand scale and breadth, it is one that remains powdery in its slate/iron bitterness. One version of a far-too ubiquitous style I'm sorry to report.","putnam","Dec 23, 2003"

The aroma is fairly mild piney hops with citrus notes. Tasted sweet and crisp with a slick oily mouthfeel. The finish is dry with a more distinct hop aftertaste. Very tasty and drinkable, but not bold enough to justify the name HopDevil . Very nicely balcanced, and would serve as a great introduction to microbrews for someone perpetually sucking on macro swill.

4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a wonderful brew. Out of the bottle, it poured a mellow honey color, with very little head. It receded into a patchy foam, and there was very little lace. The smell was that of hops burried beneath fruity aromas, almost grapee. There is a hint of pine and malt flavors in the smell also. The mouthfeel is smooth on the front of the tongue, but by the time it reaches the back of your throat it is very sharp. This brew truely plays on your palate. Feeling this go down my throat was one of my favorite parts of drinking it. The broad full flavor of hops is the first flavor that is recognizable after the mouthfeel wears off and the flavors take over. A taste mildly resembling pine sap is also present, probaly from the hops. A slight fruity undertone is there, reminiscent of that of the smell. The whole body of flavor mellows into a slighty burnt, woodsy aftertaste which persists long after the beer is done. This is one fine brew, especially when enjoyed in good company.","FranklinPCombs","Dec 09, 2003"
4.29,5.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a cloudy copper color, with an almost nonexistent white head that dissipated in seconds, though a collar of foam remained. The smell is of robust, floral, spicy hops and sweet malts. The taste is of mildly swet malts and crisp, spicy hops that finish with a very dry character. The balance between the hops and the malt is nice, with the hops taking the dominant role, of course. Nice, oily, moderately creamy mouthfeel. This is a very enjoyable IPA, well balanced, and very drinkable. This would be very nice on a hot day. Right now, in cold Spokane, I am endeavoring to convince myself it is 80 degress with the help of this beer.","woemad","Dec 08, 2003"

The rich aroma of the hops, crisp and fresh with a sweet malt backing, what a treat for the senses, start is rich in malt, sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate.

The hops dominate all over, especially on the back end where they linger above the gum line, on the back sides of the throat and inside the cheeks. Not much else going on here except the hops, no esters, no malts. I would prefer a bit more balance in my IPAs. A bit over the top on the IBUs.

4.42,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It pours a rusty red, reminiscent of the cedar water of my beloved Jersey Pines. The aroma grabs the cilia of your nose, and innundates them with the very essence of the citrusy hops. Ah, but the taste, the flavor! The taste picks up where the aroma leaves off, with hops sliding about your palate, but then, as the flavor ebbs, the malt asserts itself a bit, letting you know there is indeed a balance in place. It's medium bodied, coating the mouth nicely, then slipping away, leaving you wanting the next mouthful. And a next one there will be, as many as one, two, three or more bottles might deliver. There can surely be no perfect beer, but this IPA fits right where it needs to be, yet kicks out all the character needed to be a true original in its arena.","Foxman","Nov 22, 2003"

As expected (and hoped for) theres a big hop aroma of juicy citrus notes. The aroma isnt quite as biting and grapefruity as some other big IPAs, and it seems a little sweeter from some caramel malts. The body and carbonation are medium. Theres a good malt backbone that starts a little sweet. This brew is very well balanced, and the hops are never overbearing. However, the hops are a little harsher the some other IPAs. This really isnt much of a problem though. Theres a citric bitterness in the finish that lingers for a bit. Very drinkable IPA that I enjoyed immensely. Ive been typically purchasing beers by singles. The flaw in this method is that whenever I try a great brew I dont have anymore to follow.","byrd","Oct 24, 2003"
4.65,14.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The american IPA has finally reached the pinnacle of its evolution, and its name is Hopdevil. This was my second encounter with the Hopdevil, having visited the brewery in 2001. It was even better than I remembered. A blast of citrusy american hops assaults one upon opening the bottle - definitely some Cascade, and I wouldn't be surprised if some Centennial was lurking in there as well. It pours a dark golden brown with a rich white head. The flavor is the perfect union of sharp hops and crisp maltiness. Naturally, it is out of balance and strongly weighted towards the hops, but the hops do not suppress the other complex flavors in the beer. Any idiot can fill a brew kettle to the top with hops and call it an IPA, but the skill of the brewer is revealed by brewing a beer that satisfies the hopheads and still has loads of malt character. In my opinion, this is one of the top five craft brews that I have tasted.","soilguy","Oct 21, 2003"

A big whiff of fresh floral hop is noticed upon opening. The lightly sweet caramel malt has a toasty background flavor. Big white grapefruit bitterness leaps out as fresh under-ripe oranges and a lightly metallic tang add dimension and snap to the overall hop theme. A mild herbal quality ever so slightly tempers the sharp edginess of this brew, making it high drinkable despite its high alpha- acid content.","BeerResearcher","Oct 14, 2003"

Flavors are as well hoppy, yet again the bitterness is counterbalanced by a toasty, delicious roasted, maltiness.

Blended into the aroma are hints of pine and citrus, but well subdued. Taste is very hoppy, but not unbalanced, reasonably sweet with a hint of oak and piney goodness.

The darker color is correct in suggesting this is a bigger beer than most IPAs in the malt department. Its got a meaty, rusty flavor very reminicsent of olde style Bitters, almost of an ESB, but a much more pronounced hop flavor. Its a very nice beer, though its vitals make it somewhat difficult to drink another. After finishing, there's almost the same resiny feeling I get after sampling my wort.

This beer has a zingy floral hop flavor throughout, but the nice buttery-bready maltiness in the background sets this brew apart from other IPA's.Very crisp and drinkable despite a relatively thick consistency. The bitterness destroys any syrupy mouthfeel that may have lingered otherwise. A good american IPA that lives up to it's name. Pretty much what an IPA should be IMO","avylover","Jul 06, 2003"

Fairly good whiff of grapefruit/citrus to it. The taste is equally good. The hops are VERY strong, but there is an exquisite balance to them. They aren't strong for the sake of being strong.

Finish is dry hops with a nice sticky sweet malt balance. Slightly reserved at the finish, which is a good thing because it doesn't send me into a hop-induced coma.

It goes down easy and leaves a reminder of its hopping in a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. Suprisingly, this brew is very drinakable, even though the ABV is up there.

Very minor caramel malt hints, just enough for balance. The impact of the alcohol on the palate (and mind) is ideal. Tremendously dry & bitter finish, rather long too. Moderate carbonation.

The smell is of rolling hills of hops with a hint of the citrus groves wafting in on a light breeze from over the hill. There's noticeable carbonation, but for this kind of day, it's perfect (I just came in from a five-mile walk).

It does have a great malty presence on draft, with a very smooth hop profile as well. This is much better on tap, as the bottles develop a bit of a harshness and do not compare to Two Hearted or Stone IPA bottles.

Smell reminds me of a barley wine. Some caramel and hops aroma. Taste is a surprise. Very malty and subdued hops. I was expecting an all out hops assault. Usually the extreme beers make the list but this one is more balanced. The bitterness doesn't even kick in until 1/3 of the way through the glass. Again more defined by the malty aspects of the beer. A nice beer but I think I prefer the grapefruit of Bell's Two Hearted. Call me provincial 'cause I'm from Michigan. Still a nice beer and I'm greatful for the opportunity to try.

The nose is alluring and complex: an earthy mixture of wood, smoke, burnt sugar, spicy, leafy hops, melted butter(?), fruit (orange, lemon, raisins, apricots, grapefruit?). On palate, a combination of complexity and balance that is exceptional. On the one hand, earthy flavors of nutty, roasted, smoky malt, buttery toffee, and caramel. At the same time, spicy, leafy, cedary hop bitterness and fruit--grapefruit, lemon, orange. Finish is long, dry, and fruity. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with just a touch of carbonation. A surpsisingly drinkable brew to have such a big, spicy hop presence. Very rounded-out and deeply earthy. One of the very best American ales.

This is very enjoyable to drink. There are more than enough hops to enjoy but not enough to burn out the taste buds. For me, this is a very drinkable IPA.

At first taste, it was fresh and crisp. Then I was almost chewing on the malt, even though there was no sediment whatsoever. Finally, just the right amount of tongue-scooting bitterness finished the palate. There were, however, a few sour notes every few sips.

Once the hops fade, the mouth is left with a spicy flavor. Overall this is one excellent brew, very refreshing and a pleasure to drink; unfortunately I cannot get it where I live.

The taste was almost completely hops (bitter and floral) with only a bit of malt, which is overwhelmed. The mouthfeel was crisp, but slightly chalky.

This ale has quite a smooth taste and is very mellow despite its extreme hop characteristics. The nose is very hoppy but the malts sneak through as well as some citrus hints. The taste is very clean but it has a little bite. The head is not too strong but it leaves quite a nice foamy lacing on the glass. There seems to be a slight hint of apple in the middle of the beer.

Your first smell is pure heaven, as there is no better aroma then that of hops. Strong but not overwhealming. The taste is so well balanced you don't know which comes first, though I know it's the hops. Nice malt taste is there, mellow, bringing up the rear as it were, again balancing the hops.

Beautifully integrated on the palate - impeccable balance. The bitterness is more prominent on the palate than on the nose and contributes significantly to a very long finish. Disappears quickly.

The color remains the same, but the head holds to the end of the glass and gives a solid wall of lace. The cask version also has a much lighter nose - I guess that's mainly because the limited carbonation brings it up less. Smooth hop & malt aroma. It has a light silky mouthfeel. The flavor expresses a soft malt of light, sweet biscuity caramel, and a more balanced grassy hop flavor and bitterness. So English! A totally different beer! You wouldn't think the bottled version could do this. Similar, in many ways, to Young's Dirty Dick. I'm sure that the standard draft or bottled version would stand up to some spicy fries, but the cask version gets a little lost. Absolutely worth trying.

Flavorwise the balance is striking-- The malt profile is quite rich & is comprised of nutty, caramelly, and fruity melaniodins only acheivable by continental malt.  Malt is balanced by assertive, but clean hop bitterness.  HopDevil is a big and flavorful IPA and not nearly as bitter as the name woud imply.  Hop flavor is citrusy and herbal.

What is surprising is the generous malt profile this beer contains. A real caramel sweetness with hints of butter, nuts, honey, molasses, provides the sturdy foundation for this beer. But of course this is all to make room for the insane hop element, although I drank Victory's Prima Pils before this and was thrown off by the amount of hops in that beer. Only in that context can this one seem tempered. Otherwise, you'd damn well better be in the mood for hops. (You could say the same about Prima Pils, which I found out of whack for the style.) Delectable, sticky on the tongue, with lasting lingering floral & spicy notes. Drinkability low due to unbalanced hop element.

Smell is tons of floral hops, bitter hop oil, and hop leaves with some sweet malt in the background.  Very floral and slightly citrusy hops own this beer making it very bitter and hoppy.  For all the hops though there is just enough smooth maltiness for this to remain well balanced.  The malt combines with the hops to produce an almost fruity taste at times.  The brew is fairly creamy from the malt but is nicely crisp and refreshing at the same time and it is extremely drinkable as well.

4.35,6.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"About as good as an IPA gets!  Not too strong on the alcohol that it takes away from the ale, but a couple of these will do for a night.  Victory is a solid brewery.","marble","Jun 11, 2002"

4.52,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This is THE ultimate session brew. As a hophead, I am in love with this beer. I like the Wallop more overall, but I could drink these for the rest of eternity. The hops are combined perfectly with everything else in this tasty brew. So well balanced. Crisp maltiness, fruity, hoppy, yeah. Smooth initially, and finishes with some killer hops at the end. Looks very nice...a cloudy amber, almost orange. Not the best tasting beer I've ever had, but arguably the best overall beer there is.","IrishRedRock","May 30, 2002"
4.6,13,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I do not consider myself a hop man at all, but this brew was a very pleasant experience.  The beer is orange, almost amber in color with a very hoppy nose.  While very hoppy and bitter, the beer still had some nice malt sweetness to it which was a pleasant surprise.  Fairly complex IMO and I enjoyed every sip.  A great beer indeed.","jreitman","May 27, 2002"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I had to try this beer due to it's massive following in BA.  I do love hops, so I knew I would love this beer.  Almost like a red beer, hops beyond belief that never seemed to let up at any time.  However, it was very easy to drink.  I was not dissapointed.","AaronRed","May 26, 2002"
4.95,21.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Just tried my first Hop Devil and, boy, was I impressed.  These guys really know what they're doing and they are a hopheads dream come true.  Incredible hop aromas and flavour...enough to satifsy even the most virulent hopead.","esprit","May 24, 2002"

4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"If you were to graph the flavor profile of this beer, it'd be a straight line - no switchover between hoppiness and maltiness, bitterness and sweetness. It retains its predominantly floral hop flavor throughout at about the same degree of hop-malt balance.  A very nice American IPA.","sponberg","May 11, 2002"
3.92,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,3,"5/6/02: I have to admit that this beer surprised me. I'm usually kind of iffy on IPAs and other hoppy beers, but I really liked this one. The aroma is very floral/perfumy. The taste is definitely hoppy, but not so bitter as to overwhelm the rest of the flavors in the beer. My fiancee described it as like drinking perfume, and it did have a powerful floral quality to it. I really enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure if I could drink more than one or two in a sitting.","aracauna","Apr 28, 2002"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sierra who? I finally got my hands on a sixer of Hop Devil and will be going back for more. The hops are definitely there, but they're not overwhelming. The color and head are more or less typical for an IPA, but the taste is really remarkable. I only wish more places on the west coast stocked it. I'm an instant fan.","mickeymac","Apr 24, 2002"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Holy Hops! Wonderful beer. After a few, I need to change to something else (the hops are very intense!!!), but the first two or three are amazing.","Jdiddy","Apr 24, 2002"
4.39,7.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Forcefully hoppy, but very well balanced.  As often as I've had this beer, it always seems to suprise me.  I've seen this beer convert many friends into hop-heads.  Simply wonderful!","Suds","Apr 20, 2002"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep copper color with a slight head. Nice pungent/oily/flowery mix in the aroma. This is a decent brew. Pretty solid caramel malt backing. Good hop flavor, but again, I'd prefer more bitterness. Easy drinking for an IPA. There's no signature taste here that really stands out. This is another IPA that everybody else seems to die for and I just think it is plain good, but not great.","Bighuge","Apr 19, 2002"

4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear ruby red amber, great color. Head is small with a trace of of thin foam after 40 seconds, upwelling occasional bubbles. Citrusy sweet aroma. Very nice hop bite, grapefruit including some bitter rind flavors. Malts are clearly in the background. Hops are pronounced but not overbearing, settles to a mild bitterness at the back of the mouth with just a touch of sweetness. Refreshing. Probably my favorite American I.P.A. to date.","ADR","Apr 15, 2002"
4.85,19.2,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"The hop devil lives up to the hype. Nice red-amber color, darker than I expected. Very big hoppy nose. Nice easy taste, lingered on the tongue.Big spice flavor, florals, hops, is there cinnamon in there ? It sure tasted like it to me.  Strong bitterness at the end wakes you up and demands another taste. A proven winner and worth the wait. I have been trying to get it in Florida for a while.","StevieW","Apr 13, 2002"
4.58,12.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"The quintessential IPA in my book. Heavy hops create a very spicy, qrapefuity beer. If I had one in hand I could review better, but being at work right now... I have to say the only IPA I've had which I could say for sure was better than HopDevil is cask conditioned hopdevil. The cask conditioning seems to mellow out the hops a decent amount by taking a tiny bit of the bite off, without compromising that awesome spiciness. Works even better at celler temps when cask conditioned than when poured from a bottle.","Erix","Apr 02, 2002"
5,22.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Ya know how redheads are either ""hot as hell"" or well ya know a ""train wreck"". Well this is one ""hot"" devil. Bright bubbles, hypnotic in its bitterness. The aftertaste has addictive overtones of flowers, perfume, and a high heel against the backside. God I love the Devil out of this beauty.  Sorry about the description, but this is a top ten beer on the wish list..","frank4sail","Mar 27, 2002"
4.68,15,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"A very good...and it does live up to it's name HopDevil. Amber color is darker then SN-pale ale, with a bit more bite on the mouth. Very hoppy indeed! The malt is very nice too, its sweetness balancing the hop bitterness. A bit of warming in the belly in the finish. Defines the true American style IPA! Cheers!","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 10, 2002"

5,22.9,5,5,5,5,5,"This is my favorite IPA. I think the brewmasters at Victory describe it best, and I quote: ""Bold, spicy and menacingly delicious, this American-hopped India Pale Ale offers an aromatic punch and then follows through with a lasting, full-bodied finish."" Agreed.","mophie","Feb 09, 2002"
4.94,21.4,4,5,5,5,5,"Grinning ear-to-ear now that my local carries this.  I was expecting an overpowering glass of hops and got a beautifully balanced big IPA.  Compares to a SN Celabration but softer with less bite.  $7.99/six is gonna set me back some cash over time.","pbrian","Nov 23, 2001"
4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: This is a very hyped-up beer, and it should be as it is an absolutely marvelous beer for all the hop-heads out there, albeit very daunting for those who are not into hops to the extreme. For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection. A ""Wow!"" beer for sure. 6.7 % abv.","Todd","Nov 19, 2001"
