"Bottle date 2-28-15, poured into a teku-really great IPA, kind of a perfect representation of the west coast style.   Thoroughly enjoyed it, looking forward to more.."

"Pliny light. Looks like PtE, smells like PtE, but doesn't have that ""next level"" flavor profile of Pliny. So damn good though"

"Blind Pig is a classic, and it's a good beer, but it's getting a little long in the tooth. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it again, but I'd happily drink a few on tap if it was available. My wife loved it, so ymmv."

"510mL bottle. Pours a translucent light amber color with a thin layer of head. Lots of lacing.The aroma is grapefruit, orange, mango and pine. The taste is more of the piney hops with some grapefruit and citrus notes. Bitter but with a nice amount of malt flavor. Some more pine and a hint of floral notes towards the end. Grapefruit and orange finish. Very drinkable. Light mouthfeel. Overall, outstanding IPa."

"I would choose this beer over Pliny the Elder."

"It is hard to find another IPA that can top this one folks. Pliny is great but a totally different animal in my opinion. The piggy never fails me in bottle or on tap."
""
""
"I thought it was every bit as good as Pliny the Elder."
"Poor Blind Pig gets little recognition compared to Pliny.  Blind Pig is just as good as Pliny the Elder."

"Light amber with a touch of orange and a big white fluffy head that laces well.  Very straightforward nose, it smells like grapefruit.  Taste follows with a touch of honey like sweetness and big grapefruit flavor.  Simple but very good profile.  Nice bright carbonation and a dry finish.  This is a great IPA, simple but executed so well."

"O: I can see why there's  buzz around this beer--PTE gets the glory but don't overlook this solid IPA from RR.  Hard to find much here I don't like, but I guess the nose could have been slightly more fragrant and back off on the carbonation a bit.  Would love to have this again and glad I had the chance to try this one!"

"Got this 3 weeks old as a gift from a great friend and fellow BA. Taste was a very crisp hop bitterness that didn't hurt like some IPAs. Not as refreshing as Pliny but very quality. Pours a clear dark orange with bright white head and lacing. Smells of pine and fresh mountain foliage with a hint of citrus hiding. Very refreshing but if given the choice I'd give the nod to Pliny."

"I prefer it to Pliny and it seems to be harder to find.  A great IPA and I dare say the best example of an IPA I have tasted."
"Actually like this equally or better than their Pliny. Depends on the day. But one of the best IPAs out there. Well done!"
""
"Love this beer. My favorite from Russian River. It's a must buy... If you can actually find it."
""
"If this was made at a different brewery it would get a lot more love but in the company of Elder and Younger it gets lost sometimes. One of the best single IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice but needs a Lil more carbonation."
""
""
"Pretty hoppy initial taste with a nice malty feel in my cheeks. More enjoyable than alpine duet and Pliny the elder but not as enjoyable as the alpine pure hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Better than Pliny and Heady, for me."
""
"Prototypical IPA. Not so overdone as most are."
""
"Overall - dank nose, dry hopped pot stems. Nice bitterness trail but still juicy and dry. Fantastic IPA."
""
""
"I was just expecting a lot more from a beer that was coming from Russian River Brewery. It just wasn't for me....."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"A good runner up to Pliny the Elder.  Bitter, full of taste, nice amber color."

"If you take the label off the beer, I would say it is a good not great beer. Russian River makes amazing beers, but this one lacks the sweet malt/hop pop I have come to expect from west coast IPAs. Worth it for sure!"
"O: While it isn't Pliny, it still holds it's own as a very tasty IPA. More than happy to review this one for my 100th on BA."

"Fresh aromas of tropical, fruity hops, peach, orange and mango, along with honeyed pine and smooth caramel - finely nuanced with hints of citrus peel. Fresh, fruity hops are hovering above a sweet, honeyed malt backbone, while hints of lime acidity becomes detectable underneath. Hops sting the palate in a refreshing, dry fashion, without ever getting too aggressive. Honeyed, piny, malts wrap up the hops in a well balanced way, along with wisps of whitebread and grass, still, this beer is huge on the bitterness. The taste results in a smooth, dry ending, which is very bitter and hop driven, as malts tend to vanish. Finishes with hops lingering on the palate for a long time, developing a fascinating pleasant depth, as they turn from being fruity to a more bitter, dry impression. A classic IPA, focused on the bitterness, fantastic balanced."

"It's always tough getting your hands on one of these being that i live in So Cal and this isnt distributed much in my area. I've found a bar in Alhambra that gets this on tap from time to time. Other then that when a friend brings me one of these when they go up north i owe them dinner! lol"

"Grossly overrated, mediocre IPA at best. Tastes of latex gloves and rubber tennis balls, some notable citrus and pine notes but overall, nothing to write home about. The fact this beer is no longer seeing distro has just elevated the hype to whole new levels."

"This brew pours a transparent deep straw color with a one-finger head that dissipates quickly and little lacing. The smell is of subtle grapefruit, pine and peaches. The flavor is juicy grapefruit, peaches and bitter citrus rind, supported by a malty, bready backbone. The mouthfeel is sticky and resiny with a slick finish. Overall, this is addictively good stuff that you dream about, much like other Russian River offerings."

"At the brewpub I had the tasty priveledge of drinking this citrus delight. Smelled and tasted like the storage rooms at tropicana juice company. Great clarity, great carbonation, great taste, less filling, where do I stop? This is what all breweries should strive to brew. Once you have one every other beer in the workd is at least a little disappointing. No joke. I am ruined. Until I can get back to Santa Rosa that is."

"EDIT: having now had this several times, including on tap, I think my first bottle may have been a bit old. Aroma and taste improved noticeably in later tastings, especially on tap. Still not as complex or flavorful as Pliny the Elder, but I think it surpasses it in terms of something I'd like to drink often."

"Pours a beautiful golden sunrise orange with a fluffy white head. The head dissipates leaving a generous amount of lacing on the glass. Smells of pine, floral and citrus flavors. The taste is very much the same with some malt flavors in the back end. This goes down very easy and it is very smooth. Not overly bitter, but some bitterness lingers. Overall, a very solid IPA."
""
"Blind pig is the IPA of IPAs. It is amazing the work Russian river does. I live in SoCal and it is actually harder to find this than Pliny. Every time I get my hands on this beer it never sits in my refrigerator more than two days, and I doubt that it sits anywhere longer than that."

"4-6-15 - Monk's back bar after Phillies home opener loss. Still one of the best IPAs around."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid IPA. I don't feel it lives up to its big cousin, PtE, at all - but then, it's lighter and lower ABV, so it occupies a different beer niche. It's closer to the hoppy APAs so many companies are putting out now. Enjoy this with lunch or on a warm day."

"o; A highly drinkable and distinguished IPA. More hop power than many, although with all the new ones out lately, this little piggy risks getting lost in the wallow. Perhaps it had more punch when it was just-out-of-the-brewery fresh. May have to wait until my next trip to Cali to find out. Still and all and as is, exceptional for mouthfeel, balance and refreshment value, worthy of its current #101 spot on the BA top 250 brews."

"Bottle from the brewery. Bottled 2-24-14 and poured on 3-4-14. Oooh fresh. Pours to my wine glass a mostly clear golden copper color with a very creamy one finger white head on top. Classic grapefruit and pine aroma, some mango and pineapple, more pine and grass. Flavor is sweet tropical fruits behind massive pine bitterness. Resinous mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and extremely smooth. I do see why this is so loved, and it is quite a fantastic IPA with a lot of heft despite the lowish ABV. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this lives up to the hype. Everything a West Coast IPA should be and more. Smooth yet bitter but not overly to take it to the DIPA level (that's Pliny's job). I noticed the price has gone up on this bad boy but still worth it to experience the show. Too bad the Blind Pig can't. Whaaa."

"O- Big thanks to my bro for sending this one out to me. Never thought that this would overtake Elder and Younger for me, but the profile fits my IPA wants more than the others."
"This beer is so darn easy drinking and clean. It has a lot of similarities with Pliny the Elder with its characteristics. It's a wonderful balance of bitterness and malt sweetness. Like it's older brother, this beer is all about balance and drinkability."

"What a great IPA. Not the hop bomb that Pliny is but not certainly lacking in character. This would be in my regular rotation if available. The flavor opened up as the beer warmed. A near perfect IPA - my only gripe is the excess bitterness on the finish."

"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Immediate 2-inch thick fluffy white head, which dissipated slowly but left lots of sticky lacing behind. Thin white collar remained throughout. Medium bubbles and carbonation. Color was light orange amber, but mostly clear. What swept me off my feet here was the lovely nose -- perhaps the best citrusy, piney grapefruit nose I've ever experienced, with subtle hints of orange, mango, and papaya. On the palate -- pine, pine, pine and sweet bitter grapefruit. Just fabulous! A textbook IPA in structure, with voluptuous sexy flavor profile. Hops are strong, but not overpowering, and alcohol is totally masked/subdued. Mouthfeel is good & chewy. Overall impression is as impressive as any IPA or DIPA I've ever tasted. If you don't absolutely love this, then you've obviously got your head up your ass."

"O-Overall a great IPA by Russian River. I want more."
""
""
""
""
"o: much more bitter than the nose indicated. its clean and crisp and bitter. the bitterness is not overpowering, and blends nicely with the juicy fruit. the funny about this is that its really quite good - its just hard to live up to the other IPA offerings from Russian River, but this is really quite a good substitute. a little more bitter than say..PtE, but can holds its own with the big boys"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really grabs my tongue, nice and dry. Taste-wise, maybe I've been having too many double IPAs lately, but I'm a little surprised at the subtlety here. Not a bad thing, just unexpected. The flavor, while subdued, is very pleasant. Nothing but bitter hops. No complaints, but I maybe had my hopes up a bit. The dry, tongue-twisting bitterness is the highlight."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is good, I wish a little more of the aroma worked its way into the taste. That said, i'm splitting hairs here. This is a fantastic beer, one of the best I've ever had. It is easily in my top 5 of single IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A damn fine IPA. Deserves the accolades it gets but it's just a step behind PTE in my opinion. Not as complex and little more sessionable as well when compared to the former. This is one I would go to all the time if it was available here. Well done!"
""
"Poured into a snifter with a white one finger head. Crystal clear yellow/orange appearance. Nose is very balanced between hops and bready malts. Taste follows suit. This is my first time with this beer and i'm impressed. Very balanced with a bitterness lingering on the tongue that leaves me wanting more. Could drink this all day."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"D: across the board a good beer for me. this is one of those IPA's that could pass for a pale ale, or at least where the style is going these days. good brew, easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't get me wrong--this was outstanding and I could drink it all day. It just was missing some of the depth and complexity that exists in PtE. And for some, Blind Pig might be better--probably more of a stylistic thing. For me it was a little more resin-y/bitter and a little less fruity/floral. Not a huge difference, but enough that the magic that exists in PtE wasn't there for me."

"O- I was most impressed by the aroma, but all the parts were pretty good. Not even close to Pliny's quality, but still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clean, crisp golden color with orange tinges. It forms a head of eggshell white bubbles of a medium size, which sit nicely above the beer at about a half finger’s width. In body, the beer is clean and clear with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells of big orangey pine. Smooth caramel malt blends over the rich hop aroma, giving a sweet kick to the citrus nose. Touches of grapefruit and citrus rind also make their way into the nose to suggest the more bitter qualities of the beer. The smell is not overly pungent, but is nice and nuanced. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely bitter with a smooth sweet backbone that brings rich balance to the beer. In terms of Pliny, I feel the bitters more in Blind Pig but I know there are less bitters overall than there were in Pliny… Citric acidity is also found in the taste, and is light and playful on the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer begins as aspirin bitters and then opens into rich, bitter grapefruit and orange. Wisps of toast and caramel dance on the sides of the palate, but this beer is all about the bitters, which are strong yet balanced. The finish is of fresh orange juice with a touch of bitter aspirin and grass. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a gently prickly, higher carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel. It leaves the mouth dry with a light bitter resin and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, Blind Pig is a great, classic IPA. It is all about the citric bitters, which I really enjoy. Terrific balance is seen here, similarly to Pliny, but in a way that seems to accentuate the bitters more. Head to head with Pliny, I think I liked Pliny more, this is a solid beer with great flavors, but doesn’t really wow me in any way. It drinks like a classic IPA, which it is."

"Blind pig, great lacing really impressive and a light bright gold colour. Smell has apricot, funky citrus, so much going on, a bit of rich stone fruit, florals and some tropical fruits. 4.5 t is a smooth dry fruitiness, some. interesting yeast character, hay, a light and crisp profile with minimal citrus juiciness, this has lots of dry earthy and funky fruit notes and hop charcter. Retains some lightness but a really interesting flavor for an ipa 4.5 Mod body and carbonation, has a bit of slickness, really good balance alround 4 excellent ipa, highly recommended."

"The beer has a white two-inch foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves a very white with lacing. The beer is an orange and golden amber that is clear and filtered. Even though the head quickly dissipates, the beer still has some creamy covering. The beer smell has citrus and orange hoppy notes. However, the smell has a bit of lightly roasted malt as its backbone and a hint of pepper as well. The beer taste is very different from the beer smell. The lightly roasted malt backbone is more prominent with a grapefruit hop taste as well as hints of pepper and other mineral taste. The beer has a medium body with clean smooth feel as well as a clean aftertaste feeling. The beer has biting carbonation. A pretty good and unique IPA that I would like to have again."

"Had this straight from the bottle 3 weeks after bottling. Pours orange/golden color with a thick white head. The smell was citrus and very earthy. Taste starts off very clean which turns to hoppy bitterness on the back end. Overall, I consider it a top-notch IPA. I'm not sure it's my favorite IPA, but one that I would definitely have consistently when available."
""
""
""
"Yeah, I like this one."
""
""
"Pours orangey golden with a white head. Aroma is citrus and its rind, floral, grainy, and piney. Flavor is floral, citrus rind, toasted bread, interesting graininess, and pine. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, very nice IPA. While I definitely get why so many people love this beer, I only liked it, personally. Would drink again."
""
""
"O: Really great IPA. Good full acidic hopiness; strong bittering, but not over the top. I can't see myself drinking more than one and really appreciating the second though. The flavors are too light and would get lost in the dry finish."
"Pours clear golden with thick bubbly white head. Aroma is crisp hoppy floral citrus. Taste is crisp clean hops upfront with a touch of sweet malt and bitter orange peel on the follow through. Aftertaste is lingering bitter citrus and dank piny hops. Palate is clean and a little sticky. Overall very well balanced IPA."

"O- RR continues to impress me. This beer is balanced in a way that I've rarely seen in an IPA. The hoppy notes are fresh and leading the flavor profile, but the bread caramel malt backbone compliments this beer so well. Like Pliny The Elder, it's drinkability is world class to so easy to drink. I wish this was available to me, as I would purchase it every chance I could."
""
"Bottle from my friend Jim. Thanks, Jim. Pours yellow orange with a beautiful one finger foamy head. A lot of bubbles coming up through the beer. Lots of retention and lacing. The aroma is incredibly intense. Unbelievable. Makes me wonder what I have been drinking all these years that called itself and IPA. I get some pine (Simcoe?) and citrus on the nose. Slight floral accent is there, too. The wonderful thing about this beer is it does not taste like so many hop bombs I have had lately. I would describe the bitterness as medium and just toward the low end for the style. Finish is long and smooth. No harshness, just lingering bitterness. A pleasantly light sweetness balances the bitterness perfectly. The texture of the beer is creamy like the head. Medium body and mouthfeel is lightly tingly. Unlike some beers this beer does not improve as it warms. It is best drank in the first 25 minutes. Overall, a terrific beer. I intended to knock this beer down, because I am sick of all the hype surrounding the brewery. I came away from this beer with incredible respect."

"several beers into the RR flight here at the brew house.  This beer has all the fine things a good ipa has and can only best be described as fantastic.  It is slightly below the best IPA's I have ever had due to the nature of my love for specific hop flavor.  do not miss this beer."

"Nice pale gold in color with a great amount of bubbly white head that persists. Lacing also fantastic. Aroma is of grapefruit and sweet/bitter grassy hops. Taste is really good. Subtle sweetness that reminds me of fresh cut St Augustine. The bite of the hops is slight, but well balanced. I'm surprised that this beer is so drinkable. I've killed a full tulip already. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, and has a nice hop sting. Might have to get a growler of this beer instead of Pliny my next trip to RR."

"Pours a light golden with a thick, quickly dissipating white head. The aroma explodes with grass, grapefruit, and flower notes. This is the best smelling IPA I've ever had. The flavor is more subdued, but still amazing. Biscuity malt followed by strong hop bitterness redolent of grapefruit with hints of grassiness and floral notes. Incredibly drinkable. Finishes dry and bitter. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, if this isn't the finest example of an IPA I've ever had, it is surely in the top two or three! I cannot give enough kudos to Russian River!"

"500mL thanks to OaklandBrewer. Consumed exactly one month after bottling. Pours a crystal clear light orange to deep gold. Thicker, off-white head. Thick rings of lace. Looking good. Nose is thick orange peel, rich citrus, melon character. Approaching an 8 for nose. Taste is sharp, bitter, lots of citrus rind. Nice stuff, could use some extra butterscotch thickness. Perhaps a little dry with nice hints of kumquat and meaty jackfruit. Nice refreshing, lighter mouthfeel. 3.7 is about right. Nice stuff though there are plenty of better IPAs in the sea."

"I've had my eye on Blind Pig for a couple years. I tried a few times to set up a growler trade with no luck so I'm glad this beer is finally bottled and I have the opportunity to try it in excellent condition. I wouldn't hesitate trading for this again and I like the fact it's bottled in pint bottles. The price would put a halt to buying as much as I'd like but it is a delicious IPA. Thanks again for the treat Brian!"

"The BP was great, needed more malt backbone IMO, but wow. The PWO was maltier but not as citrusy, more bitterness, though. I preferred the PWO, my g/f the PB. The PWO was really, really süffig, for the pint glass was empty within minutes though I was trying to appreciate its complexity."

"The beer pours a rich looking golden yellow with great effervescence fueling a dense white head that laces and remains as a thin blanketing throughout drinking. The nose presents potent notes of caramelized sugars, malt, fresh citrusy hops and subtle grapefruit. It's definitely more reserved than I'd expected; more aromatic hops would have elevated it to my expectations, without significantly altering its status as an AIPA. I think it drinks very well, distinctly malty with fresh hops lingering on the palate. It's drinkability and mouthfeel are really where this beer excels (in my opinion) presenting a rich, clean malty sweetness, layered citrus hops, and a mild, lingering bitterness that coats the palate. No grapefruit rind aftertaste, good effervescence, and a touch of caramel. Great beer that I'd soon consume again if bottles were available my way."

"O- not overly hoppy, tons of sweet tropical fruits, this beer is very refreshing and drinkable. Almost not Malt character, but not a hop bomb. I'm really glad I finally got to try this. This reminds me a lot of zombie only much fruitier."
"Overall: Pliny's big brother (being that this is Vinnie's original IPA) does not disappoint. It's a nice sweet but not cloyingly sweet IPA that is very hoppy yet is not overwhelmingly bitter- it all comes together very well to make for an interesting, easy drinking experience that is truly refreshing- it doesn't feel watered down at all. It just exchanges excess, unnecessary (IMO) bitterness for more hop flavour (not that much different than Pliny vs super bitter DIPAs) and apparently that's what I prefer on any given day. (4.5)"

"Overall: YES. What else can I say?"
"O: 4.75 - definitely an exemplar of a West Coast IPA; lots of dank, citrus flavor and aroma, superdry; I'd put this up there with Ballast Point Sculpin, Green Flash IPA, Stone IPA and others as the best examples in class; cheers!"

"Bright golden body with a pillowy white head. Beer is nearly transparent as it is definitely well crafted. The scent is piney with some citrus rind and some grassiness. A hint of sweetness that balances it out. The taste is refined. The hops are in balance but certainly center stage. No strong malt notes or sweetness in the taste. You get light pine and some citrus rind. There is enough bitterness to let you know you're drinking an IPA. Well made beer, and certainly worth seeking out."
""
""

"Overall - Good, but I'm not big on super dry IPA's like this. Lagunitas IPA is the same way; in fact, these two beers are quite similar in many ways. For the price, I'd just as soon drink the Lagunitas than buy this again."

"Poured a seethru auburn-tinted brown with two-finger white head that died quick with lace patches and had a very hoppy nose; pine and citric hops along with grapefruit and touches of breadiness and caramel malt. Light to medium bodied and easy going down the hatch, the hops are dominant and have a great earthy, citrusy and grapefruit taste along with minimal fruit sweetness. Beer is balanced by sweet and dry malty backbones, and finishes not bitter but dry and crisp and makes you want to have another drink. Skirts the edge between overly hoppy/DIPA and just a right balance for an IPA between hops and malts and is an excellent brew."

"The very first DIPA and it's my most favorite of the DIPAs, except for PtY when it's on tap. I like this better than PtE because it feels big, bitter and well balanced. Hate to be a pretentious arse, but there's a bar down the street from my house and they have it ontap all the time, and like PtE, I have to have one of these a week."

"a clean golden-copper with 2 fingers white head, nice retention and decent lacing. very floral scent, cascade piney hops, caramel, grapefruit. a slight piney flavor up front, lots of grapefruit-like citrus flavor, earthy bitterness in the finished mixed in with a sweet malt backbone. medium body, medium carbonation - a very refreshing and well balanced ipa. i have waited patiently for a full year to pull off a trade with this one. i've had way better ipa's in the meantime, but i am definitely glad i've gotten to try it."

"It's a really nice looking beer, pours a largely clear yellow-orange with a medium fluffy white head. It's got a really nice sweet citrusy hop aroma with bit of biscuity malt lurking as well. The flavor isn't quite as citrusy as the smell would indicate. A semi-sweet biscuity malt hits first which transitions nicely into a nice hop bitterness. The flavor doesn't blow me away, but it's nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall this is a well-crafted IPA that is rather on the bitter side, it's not too sweet or citrusy, but comes together nicely."

"This one pours clear, light gold in color with a thick white bubbly head. Good lacing and retention with the head receding slowly. Smells like citrus and fruity hops, sweet grapefruit, fresh cut grass. The taste mirrors the smell with fruity citrus up front and finishes w/ grassy, earthy hops and lemon rind. The taste is a little weaker than I would have expected. The body is light and slightly watery, very little carbonation to speak of. I enjoy the flavor of this beer, just wish there was more of it. A little too thin in my opinion but still leaps and bounds better than most normal-strength IPA's out there. Glad I got to try it."

"Pours a clear golden with one finger white head. Head slowly vanishes leaving little lacing on glass. Aroma big with citrus fruit, pine and slight grass notes.

"Edit: I get it now! Fresh from the tap at the brewery itself, this is one of the best IPAs there is, it's a grapefruit smack in the jaw, and is fantastic. As bright and potent as any beer in the game. Bumping up the score a bit based on that experience, but this doesn't travel or hold up at all in my view. Wow though from the brewery!"

"Pours a deep gold with mild carbonation. A finger of foam with good retention, nice thick even lacing. Fantastic looking beer. Smells of strong hop and grapefruit, pine, citrus, tropical fruits mesh together well with a modest malty backbone. Very pungent and rich, very reminiscent of Pliny, all the smells a good ipa should have and then some. Tastes of strong hops, pine, citrus with a sweet bready malt coming through. Flavors meld together nicely, nothing over powering anything else- very nice balance in this beer. Mouth is also consistent, medium body with a mild carbonation tingle. Resins coat the mouth with a strong bitter dry finish. Overall one of the best ipas made on the west coast, really glad I was able to get a few bottles of this. The freshness no doubt playing a role, but this would still be great even after a few months. The things I'd do to have regular access to Russian River beers!"

""
""
""
""

"O: Extremely easy to drink and enjoyable - a very nice aroma and taste but the best aspect of this beer is how easy it is to drink (I think I could drink these all day long and never tire of it). Lots of hops present but they do not overpower."

"*Hot dog, another of Raul's ""trippin'"" episodes. All down the line, this thang is a smoother than George Clooney. Maybe something was wrong during Raul's first few attempts, but like a fluffy cloud that just gracefully floats by, Raul is intoxicated by its beauty."

""
"O- Great IPA, could drink a lot of this one."
"O: good, but didn't live up to my expectations at all. Not a lot of flavor hops. Most of the flavor I got was in the smell or bitterness. Still a decent buy, and it was unbelievably fresh."

"Probably one of the best IPAs I'll ever have, this is really easy to down in several minutes for hopheads, especially considering how smooth and balanced the drinking experience is. I'm really spoiled with Pliny at this rate and always try to find it over Blind Pig... But that's unfair, and I should pack myself more with this when I have the chance. Don't think of it as a ""Pliny-lite," but rather another fantastic and original offering from Russian River. So drink up!"

"O- A very very good American IPA that has a wonderful piney hop flavor that makes me feel like I am in a pine forest. Would highly recommend it as a classic APA style beer. Another fine beer from Russian River. I might get some slack, but in many ways I think this is better than Pliny the Elder. I know Pliny is a double, but if the hop choices made with Blind Pig are just awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good IPA that Russian River has made. A lot like Pliny but a tad lighter. I enjoyed drinking this very much."
""
""
""
""
"Definatly a good startee beer if your trying to get someone into ipas. What a perfect example"
""
""
"This pours an amber tan color with tremendous white foam. The aroma is full on orange and orange marmalade. So fresh and vibrant. Eminently pleasing flavor. Makes me think of orange and grape blossoms with some grapefruit citrusy notes. All through the miracle of hops! Nice body on this, piney and hoppy, with a rounded bitterness and a dry finish. Delicious."
"O- This was a decent IPA, but definitely not one of my favorites especially from Russian River. I enjoyed this beer however it didn't have the flavor that I was hoping it would have and finished a tiny bit too bitter for my liking. I recommend trying this beer out, but I wouldn't say it's a must have."
"O - no, this isn't PtE but I didn't expect it to be. This is a quality IPA from a truly fantastic brewery. The aroma could be slightly more pronounced and the flavor profile a tad more robust. Otherwise extremely good. I wouldn't pay a premium for this but I would love to have it on draft anyday and would never turn it down."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a moderate, fast dissipating head, leaving lacing. Hoppy aroma. Hops, citrus; hoppy finish. Somewhat muted, like a watered down Pliny the Elder. OK, but don't see the point. I'm not getting the same positive experience as other reviewers. Purchased from a rarely visited store, so maybe an old bottle. If I'm lucky enough to see this again, I'll revise the review."
""
""
""
" coast style."
""
"Well this was a real nice treat. I was out to dinner and saw this one the draft list. I made sure I ordered as many as I could handle in one sitting. The beer poured out as a nice golden color with a brilliant white head on top. The lacing is nice a sticky on this one. The smell of the beer is piney and full of citrusy hop aromas. It smells so refreshing. The taste of the beer is also very nice, hopped up like crazy with a clean malt backbone. The mouthfeel is very sharp and crisp with a strong carbonation to it. Overall this beer was very good, I'm glad I finally finished the trio from Russian River. All were excellent."
"O - Not as well balanced as Pliny but not far behind. Takes the pine/orange peel route."
""
""
""
"The blind pig is very drinkable and very hoppy with a darkyellow fluid."

"O- A solid IPA. Huge amount of bright, piny, citrusy, character. Refreshing on these hot summer days."
""
""
"Tap at Teresa's - hazy orange minimal head lots of lace. Brew has big hop nose, citrus and grapefruit maybe. Brew has big hops, crisp start, pineapple, corriander, some slick oil in the finish. Real good crisp finish that has some tart bitterness. Very drinkable brew here, a standout . Great stuff; An exceptional IPA here."
""
""
"O - Damn good all around, very standard IPA, but not incredibly exciting."
""
""
""
"O - Big Fan of this Pig. Russian River delivers on this one. Thanks to John Neal for returning from his San Fransico trip with some goodies to share!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into pint at falling rock in denver. Pours a clear golden amber with nice foam head and good lacing. Smells of nice candy hops. Taste is really smooth candy like hops with a super crisp malt finish. Really well balanced and full of nice flavor. Such a well crafted IPA. Well worth a visit from anyone!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a slight letdown. Smells delicious, but doesn't deliver on the taste. It's still a great brew, just doesn't quite live up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very balanced, well-crafted, and interesting. Had this both from tap and bottle on multiple occasions and never have I been disappointed. One of my TOP 5 IPA/DIPAs. Very suitable in So. CA summer weather!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All I can think is that this was an old and severely mistreated keg of beer which was then hooked up to improperly functioning tap lines. I definitely want to try this again (preferably from a fresh bottle), but I don't hold super high hopes right now."

"A well done IPA, interesting contrast between big citric fruity nose and more of a pine emphasis on the palate."
"Fresh Bottle poured into tulip. Nice copper salmon color with a very tight creamy inch thick cap that hangs on to the glass leaving wave length patterns as I sip down. Nose is pretty straight forward with nice citrus fruits and pine forest. Flavor is along the same lines with very nice lemon and mango notes, bitter hops and a nice blanket of bready malt to keep it all cohesive, very nice balance. Blind Pig is a quality IPA often overshadowed by it's siblings but worth seeking out for a nice citrusy bitter balanced brew."
""
""
""
"O: Not as bright and complex as its big brother Pliny, but certainly a deliciously drinkable IPA that is a showcase for hops and the West Coast style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A damn good, balanced IPA. Worth the hype? Probably."

"O: An excellent single IPA from Russian River Brewing Company. My only complaint is that Vinny does not distribute his IPAs in bottles to the East Coast."

"Overall a great beer."

"Had this at Toronados in SF. Pours a dark, clear orange with a little lacing of foam. Tastes of citrus, floral hop bitterness. Not a overwhelming flavor, but it makes for a very session able beer. I would have no problem making this a go to beer if I could have the chance."
""
"Russian River's Blind Pig pour a crystal clear orange, with light tangerine highlights. A finger's worth of bone colored foam caps the beer and displays both good head retention and lacing. The nose is one note, but intense. The aroma of straight pungent, bright grapefruit creeps from the glass and reaches my nose well before the glass does. Every sip greets me with a touch of candy sweetness, before a robust, perfectly dialed in bitter bite comes in mid palate. There's plenty of grapefruit, as promised by the aroma, on the back end, and it's joined by a secondary orange flavor. The mouthfeel is picture perfect. The body is light and lean, with just enough heft to support the bit of malt flavor that's present. The carbonation is bubbly and expressive, aiding in the massive impact the hops have. Blind Pig doesn't get as much attention as the other IPAs in Russian River's portfolio, and that's shame, because it's a hell of a beer in its own right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think I am having this beer a bit too warm, but I wasn't super impressed - although it's a good beer. Zombie Dust, Red Racer IPA, Odell IPA are all much better than this brew."
""
""
"So its not Pliny. Its still a really well-crafted, well-priced beer that, for the hop-heads, is a very solid brew. Sure for the same price, more people might prefer Pliny the Elder. But this gets the malty-red-ale lover in me going, so as an enjoyer of reds and hops, this one is welcome here. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: Absolutely perfect IPA. I don't think there is a beer that Russian River makes that even has a hint of suck. At one week and one day old it's at the peak of freshness and it's absolutely wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid IPA from RR. It is definitely good and easy to drink. However, while this is good, I feel like it is Pliny the Elder's little brother. It doesn't have the same wow factor that Pliny has that makes you want to have more and more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Thanks to bbothen, I finally had an opportunity to drink Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder together - both under a month old. I think I prefer the Blind Pig in a lot of ways, which was a bit surprising considering how much I like Pliny. Very well done, and highly recommended. Excellent beer."

"O: It took me forever to getting around to reviewing this beer. It has always been freaking delicous and I honestly don't know whats with the craze towards Pliny (yes it a great beer) but Blind Pig IMO is a more gorgeous well rounded beer."
""
"O: It's a pretty great IPA, maybe better than Pliny. Still not as good as many others I've tasted, and definitely not worth the hype, but still recommended. I will drink again."
"O - This could be the best IPA at a lot of breweries and Russian River has 3 or 4 that I think are better. You have got to be kidding me. This is a solid IPA."
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy gold, with a one inch head of dense white foam. Retention is moderate and clingy lacework throughout. Aromatics are pungent and floral. Tangerines, pine sap, grapefruit, apricots, melons, and light, fresh malt. Tropical fruits in a Northern forest. Medium bodied, with a crisp, dry mouthfeel."
""
"Overall, I had this brew on tap and was more impressed than the bottle. An awesome brew, and one I would drink often!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it's good. I would drink it again, but it didn't stand out in any particular way."
""
"O- I love this beer. I rarely buy it since its the same price as PtE at my work. But whenever it is fresher that PtE I'll buy it. It has less alcohol than Pliny and that makes it a little more of sessionable beer."
"This is a beer that would be perfect on a warm spring afternoon, or a hot summer day, or a cool fall evening, or a cold winter night. It really would be perfect for nearly any occasion. The body is smooth and mellow, like a filtered fruit juice. The carbonation is just a bit fizzy but is definitely helpful."
""
""
"O: While I cannot complain about this, I think it had a lot to live up to, in comparison to Pliny. At the end of the day, I'm glad that I tried it, and enjoyed it, but didn't care for the very dry finish"
""
""
"Another fantastic offering from Russian River. I am lucky to have a few friends on the west coast who can help me get this one but I wish it was readily available here in Ohio."
""
""
"Overall: I did enjoy this beer just a little bit more than Pliney. Even though Pliney is a bigger beer I think that the Blind Pig has the edge because its a smaller and more drinkable beer that has as big of a hop profile going on. Rissian River makes great hoppy beers thats just the straight story."
"Very similar to Pliny - more bitter on the finish and not quite as balanced, but still a delicious brew."
"O - really nice! and super fresh; highly drinkable while avoiding serious palate fatigue; classic ipa; a must-try and i will be finding this one again!"
"Notes: Not as good as it was when brewed in Temecula."
""
"O - it's a really good IPA. I only wish I'd had it before the Plinys, because I can taste the great similarities just not as strong. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I finally got to try a Russian River IPA...this one was about a month old when we consumed it...it's all about the hops...nice citrus flavors with a dry, bitter finish"
"Overall: A good, straightforward IPA. A more simple and less complex IPA from RR."
""
"Really like this beer and would even say I would choose this over PtE."
""
""
""
""

"bottom line: Just fantastic – one of the best “regular” IPAs I’ve ever had. Russian River just does everything right. Great warm (or cold) weather IPA."
"Find it and drink it when you can."
""
""
"This is a delicious beer. Nothing out of the ordinary, but a lot of simple makes a little great."
"O -- Great beer! Hop flavor is dominant and complex; it brings a good balance and does not overwhelm the more delicate toasty/light malt flavors. Easy to drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a serious treat. Wish this was available out my way. Such a supreme drink."
""
"This is an excellent IPA; crisp and clean, it really exemplifies the standard IPA, which in this world of Imperials and Doubles, is oft overlooked and under appreciated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer Date on the bottle is 31 Jan so pretty fresh and purchased from the source"
""
""
""
"This is much more thin in feel and flavor than I expected, and ultimately that's what holds it back from being great. It's easily quaffable, dangerously so. I think I'm ultimately disappointed that the complexity in the aroma is not matched in the flavor. This is just a simple beer with lots of hops in it, but it's crafted well and has its own corner in the IPA world."
""
""
""
""
"O- Needless to say this growler dissapeared very fast. I can name at least 3 IPA's that come to mind that I prefer over this, but none of them drink as easy as this does. Deserves the acclaim it gets. Glad to of gotten a growler and not just a pint or 12 oz bottle."
" Not as in your face as The Elder, but a very nice refreshing alternative that still has the Russian River Brewing stamp of excellence."

"A nice lighter, easier drinking example of the style."

However, I think the Pizza Port Wipeout IPA wipes the floor with this (and other IPAs that will not be named).

"O - Really great beer, wish I had easier access to this one."
"O. I remember having this 9 months ago and I thought it was better than Pliny. This bottle is less than a month old, so it is as fresh as it gets. And it is extremely disappointing. The malt profile on this is awfully thin and what you are left with is a thin, watery bite. Not even close to a great IPA."

"The mouthfeel is also perfect, lightly creamy and just a touch sticky, medium body with just enough carbonation to give it a little life but not so much that it becomes prickly or bloating. Extremely smooth. Definitely top notch and not to be missed."

"O- Blind Pig is a really nice IPA, and a great introduction to Russian River beers. I'm excited to try the Pliny."
"bottled 12.19.11, so just about two weeks old. pours a very bright dark gold/light amber color with a white head that leaves good lace. nose is tropical fruit (pineapple grapefruit?) and hints of flowers with a touch of sweet malt backbone. just wonderful. like cutting a pineapple in the middle of a citrus grove. taste is grapefruity and filled with pine, grass and all the proper hop notes. just enough sweetness to round it out, but finishing bitter and fairly dry. medium body that begs to be schwilled. wow. i've always opted for the other ""well known"" RR brews, and am kicking myself for sleeping on this one. fantastic."

"Thanks to Cstromberg57 for this one. The ""littler"" version of Pliny the Elder, which makes complete sense. They look, smell and taste very similar, but Pliny is just...more. Bottle dated 10/18/11. I wonder if it's a little past it's prime, but no matter, it is a very tasty beer. Nice honey gold with the underlying shimmery orange/red glow of a fine IPA. Citrus and floral notes. Taste follows nose with a good hoppy bite. This is my fifth RR offering. If I had ready access to this brewery, I'd probably be drinking it's output more than anything else."

"Overall, I really loved this one. I would definitely buy it more often if I had easier access to it."
""

"D - So great to have this bad boy on tap. What a great bar."
"Overall I really did and always have enjoyed this. My pallet has change so much over the years. The first time I had this I had is side by side with Pliny and liked this much more than Pliny. How times have changed. I have had a Pliny this week and (as of now) it blows this away. Regardless of my review or comparison to Pliny, this is a must try. Thanks to Tucson25 for this extra."

"O. I got this bottle more than week ago so maybe I should have drunk it sooner but I don't think it's suffered for all of that. A seriously nice IPA with plenty of character. Definitely one to buy again."

"4.5/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"O: This is a great drinking beer. It's a classically balanced IPA with malt and hop characters complementing one another. It's not what I would consider particularly crafty or even innovative. It's drinkable, and even good, but no better than say, Flower Power IMO. The elusiveness of this beer takes away from it's potential for me."
""
""
"O: Despite living in Pliny's shadow, this beer is delicious and just as good. It's also a bit cheaper, and a better choice if you're stuck driving."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. This pours a honey straw color with 1 1/2"" of beautiful white head. The smell is awesome. Lots of citrus heavy aromas. The taste is rich in tropical hops. Pineapple most notable here. RR makes some of the best beers on the planet. They have an uncanny ability to make great hop forward beers that actually have some balance, not just dumping a bucket of hops in and calling it an IPA. Wonderfully carbonated and light to medium body. If I lived in CA, this would be a regular for sure at 3.99$ a bottle."

"Another ace by the pros at Russian River; these are the kind of beers that make it tough to tire of IPA's. A lot like a little brother to Pliny the Elder, maybe a touch more earthy and bitter and lighter in complexion. Feels more session-y too, if RR was ever to 6-pack it, they should start here (and they wouldn't hurt the PtE brand)."
""

"O - Overall, this beer was good and certainly worth a try, but there are better, cheaper, and more available IPAs in my area. That said, this is still quite a good IPA. I'm certainly happy I got the chance to try it, but it's not quite worth a road trip to the brewery just to try this one. That's what Pliny the Elder is for, really. Blind Pig was more of a bonus."

"O - Another great IPA from Russian River. I cold sip on these all day. Too bad they don't distribute to Las Vegas, but thanks to Scott I got to try this one."
""
"O: Very good IPA. Once again Russian River delivers."
"I suspect bottle age may be a problem, but as it just landed off the boat, getting fresher will be difficult unless traded. Having said that bottle age would not affect the carbonation."
"Overall this is a pleasure to finally try. I am not a huge fan of pine forward beers, but this is one of the best I have had. Great balance and not overly bitter."
"As a non-IPA lover, this was actually quite enjoyable. I'd consider getting a full one, given the chance."
"Pours a yellow-amber-orange color, very effervescent, with about a half fingers worth of white head. The head slows into a nice layer on top of the brew, lasting the whole way down. It also leaves gorgeous rings of lace down the entire glass. The dominating scent i am detecting is citrus. To be more exact, peach, orange, and lemon rind. There is also a nice hoppy bitterness to it. Taste follows the nose, citrusy up front, but a sharp hop bitterness keeping it in check. It is followed by a slightly malty flavor that keeps everything balanced. This is very carbonated, but not overly-carbonated, just how i like my IPA's to feel. You can feel the bubbles dancing on your tongue. This is another solid brew by Russian River that I am glad to say that I can find just about anytime that I want."
"bottled on 9/30/11. poured into a goblet a clear golden orange with a quarter inch head that quickly receded to a thin white ring and left no lacing. smell is of sweet citrus and pine hops. taste is exactly as you would expect after smelling it. some sticky pine and tons of citrus. offers a nice malt balance that stays in back where it belongs and leaves with a peach aftertaste. mouthfeel is a crisp medium body with good carbonation and a well balanced feel of bitterness and sweetness. overall this is one of the best ipa's i've had the pleasure to try. perfectly balanced, a must have for any beer fan."
"O - A very nice beer, especially at 6.1% -- they pack in a lot of flavor. Not as blown away as I was expecting, but it is certainly a very fine beer. Pliny is leagues better in my opinion."
"A great IPA. Reminds me of any great West Coast/citrus pine bomb but this is more refined and crisp in a way. Hits me like Stone IPA did the first time 2.5 years ago (a great thing!)."
"This is a solid IPA. Well balanced with nice malt character and a very great hop presence."
"Overall: This truly is a paragon for the American IPA. The flavors are nicely balanced and the complexity is almost unmatched. Decidedly drinkable."
"thanks to furthurgone for sending this in trade."
"Now this is a west coast IPA! It's certainly up there with the other great IPAs I've had over the years."
"Dr: Very drinkable and of nice quality. Thought it's my least favourite style, I'd readily have it again - especially if it were offered on draught. It's not as special as other beers from Russian River, but it's wonderfully hoppy and pleasant. It will satisfy true fans of the style; this is an IPA done right, not the ""dump as many hops in as possible and call it good"" school of brewing."
"O - Not blown away by it, definitely still like it's bigger brother Pliny better, but still a good IPA. Nice rounded out hop bomb."
"Blind Pig arrives with two fingers of white foam atop the clear, amber colored beer. Aromas of citrus and bready malt combine in the nose. Flavors of orange and grapefruit rind up front balanced by notes of fresh biscuits. Bitter citrus abounds in the finish along with a bit of pine resin and oak. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation. Creamy texture. A phenomenal IPA from Russian River. This one never disappoints. Recommended."
"Overall a very good IPA from Russian River, and highly drinkable at 6.1% ABV."
"Looking forward to the rest of these beers...."
"O- A complex and well balanced IPA. Really appreciate the malt character and how it keeps the hops from overwhelming the beer."
"O: What a choice. Just had a Sculpin the other day. This is right there for my favorite IPA. Almost a Pliny but a tad less balanced with hoppy bitterness standing out a bit more. Amazing IPA."
"Very easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had. The flavor of this beer belies its ABV, and it is a fantastic example of hop balance. I'll be hunting down some bottles soon enough."
"Overall probably the best single IPA that I've ever had. I wish I could get this one on a regular basis. From the bottle art to the beer itself, this one is fantastic."
"On the nose, mainly orange citrus fruit and bitter grapefruit dominate, along with a bit of pine. There is a hint of tobacco on the nose. Semi-earthy malt notes on the palate to balance out the hops. he citrus notes linger on the palate, with grapefruit dominating and orange hanging in the background."
"Unique and distinctively Russian River."
"Overall: Bold enough with both the hops and malts. Excellent aftertaste. Sweet caramel malts and of course the oily hops on the tongue."
"Another good beer by Russian River. Easy to drink and smooth."
"To my palate this is more tasting like an APA, especially with the 6.10 ABV. These session IPAs are nice and I favor them on a hot summer day. Kind of take the place of lawn mower beers for hopheads."
"If I ordered one of these without knowing anything about it, I would definatly have another, or 3. I look forward to trying this one on tap at the brewpub someday."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and dry, exceptionally drinkable. One of the better examples of the style, I wish I could have this whenever I wanted."
"Overall, RR blows me away once again with this super balanced, super tasty IPA. ISO: a case of Blind Pig damn it!"
"Overall, another winner from Russian River. This is a world class beer, and I'm glad I got to try it. Highly recommended!"
"O - RR rocks my IPA world."
"Notes: Great IPA. Very fruity and juicy both in aroma and flavor. Well balanced and overall just very enjoyable. Pliny may be king, but this is a prized Pig in its own right."
"Notes: Solid flavor but I see why Pliny is king. This is a nice beer, though."
"O - A great IPA. I wish they sold this stuff here in NC!! Thanks to my good friend for bringing this one back for me."
"O: tastes like a dipa, this beer is so good. It's no elder, but a damn near perfect example of the style."
"Overall, this is a delicious brew that I would drink all the time if it were available locally. Just another outstanding brew from Russian River."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the strong citric quality to the hops, and the robust nose about it. This beer showcased as a simplistic IPA with a full and bright nose, getting its point across with the fewest number of words. In the end, the flavor didn’t quite live up to the stage set by the aromas, but it is ultimately a great choice for the style."
"Overall: This is easily my favorite IPA, I could see myself drinking these all the time. If only I could get them on a regular bases."
"O: I always remember Blind Pig being a good IPA, but perhaps it never got the attention it deserves from me due to it's elder. This really is just a fantastic American IPA, and I could totally see myself grabbing this as a session starter. This does minimal damage to the palate, and you still get to enjoy all the joys of a fantastic IPA. If you want all the flavor of a great beer, and still be able to taste later offerings, then grab a Blind Pig. However, it doesn't quite have the punch that others achieve in style. That said, this has that trademark Russian River balance that so many of us applaud."
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. This was bottled 18 days before consumption. Pours a pale golden yellow with ever present lacing and a 1/4 inch head. The smell of hops is the first thing that hit me. A very enjoyable beer. The taste of piney hops with just a titch of malt sweetness. A little dry, but very enjoyable. I will continue to search out this beer and will trade for it often."
"O: This is a good IPA but not outstanding. I was expecting more from the hype that surrounds it. Maybe that is the problem though. I had too high of expectations. But it is worth giving a try and I definitely wouldn't turn it down."
"Certainly not my favorite IPA that RR makes however it's still a very flavorful and balanced one at that. Bright, clean, bitter and balanced, this is yet another beer that reminds me exactly why I love the style so much."
"O) Drank my first bottle of this last weekend, after enjoying my first bottle of Pliny. I'm glad I had another bottle of Blind Pig, and that I held off on the review. I would have tried my best not to compare the two, but it may have been inevitable. In the end, Blind Pig is a damn fine IPA, and should be recognized as such."
"I've had this a bunch of times on tap, but this is the first time I've enjoyed it out of the bottle. It's just as great. Fuels the on going battle of who is better: Pig or Pliny?"
"Good body, superb flavor with a fast finish that leaves me wanting more. Also leaves me overjoyed that my neighborhood corner store stocks such fine product. Next time I start making noise about moving out of San Francisco could somebody please remind me of that? Thanks."
"Overall this is a fantastic IPA. I would drink this all the time if it were readily available in PA. I received this and a PtE in my trade box and figured that I should try this one first as not to be disappointed after the Pliny. This beer was good enough to hold it's own against almost anything."
"O- This is a good but not great IPA."
"D - A fantastic, tasty IPA, no doubt about it. I'm noticing a trend of the garlic-kiss in many uber-popular IPAs I've been able to try only recently (e.g. Devil Dancer, Gubna, Pliny The Elder, Ruination...)."
"D/O- I thought long and hard about it and came to the conclusion that this beer has no weak spots...maybe even could have given the 'appearance' a perfect '5' rating. Well deserving of the status it carries in the beer world. I found this to be slightly more enjoyable than Pliny The Elder...I know, blasphemy. Thanks stupac2!"
"O: While not as perfect as PtE or PtY, this is in it’s own right a little brother of both of these and is a great IPA. I got nothing else to say other than it’s not PtE/PtY. Must...drink...MOAR! 4.5"
"Thin, weak body and not enough carbonation. I'll be generous and give a 3 for drinkability despite pouring most of my glass back into my brother's. If you like single IPAs, you will probably love Blind Pig."
"O- Good IPA. Not sure if it's A good, but still a solid ipa. Could definitely drink more of this. Thanks Duff27!"
"A really good IPA with plenty of citrus and pine. Well balanced for a West Coast style IPA."
"D - Close to the quintessential IPA. Delicious citrus flavors with a huge hop bite. Great aftertaste and excellent drinkability. The alcohol is well masked. I wish I could find this in bottles, it could become one of my favorite IPAs."
"O: Overall a great easy drinking IPA."
"Tasted this at a beer festival at the Tustin Brewery in Tustin, CA. It was a fantastic festival and Blind Pig was tapped out very quickly. It possibly was my favorite beer that day. I prefer the milder IPAs and this hit the spot. Great color and effervescent head with just the right amount hops."
"Overall a solid but straightforward IPA I think, not that blown away by this however. Good beer no complaints but feels like a one trick pony. But I will get on this ride anytime."
"Overall - Definitely my kind of IPA. Lots of citrus and a nice clean and refreshing taste. It is along the lines of one of my favourites: Bells Two Hearted - but with a touch less sweetness. It has a fantastic balance and its very drinkable. If only I could get this stuff all the time."
"Found in at Clems bottle house in a 500ml bottled just 10 days after the bottling date, how is the for fresh AB. Poured into a tulip glass since no pints available. Poured with minimal off white head that did not stick around and had little to no lacing during drinking. Smell provided great floral herby notes right from the outset that struck around nicely. The taste was another solid ipa from Russian River, not over powering but a great hop character with good malt balance. Think I may like this as much as some of my favorite west coast brews for a warm summer day. Mouthfeel was full but not viscus with a clean finish."
"Overall: Definitely a tasty one. Came across as a bit on the light side (aroma & flavor), but that can be expected when drinking Blind Pig side-by-side w/ PtE. A pretty tasty IPA to enjoy earlier on in a session!"
"Had a pint at the Monk's Tavern in Philadelphia. Fantastic nose of bug, citrusy, piney hops. Some tropical fruit and caramel malt as well. Nice appearance. Off-white head with good lacing. Flavor is similarly hoppy and delicious. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a fantastic IPA and one I would certainly enjoy having again."
"OVERALL: My notes say ""Good lord, this is an excellent beer."" I had tried it once before, but I was distracted and not paying attention to the excellent aroma and mouthfeel and certainly not appreciating the complexity of flavor. Of course, I'm not completely sure until I do a side-by-side, but I may like this a touch better than Pliny. Either way, it's a buck cheaper a pint and a little easier to track down."
"Great beer, but I miss the potent, yet smooth blast of pine. I would also like this beer to be more dry. The extreme fruitiness elevates the sensation of sweetness as it is."
"taste - still a good blast of pine on the hops, the citrus almost dissappears and is replaced with more grassy/earthy notes. really nice mouthfeel, good clean finish leaves you wanting more."
"Give it a shot but at 6.00pt I thought it not quite the value."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
"On tap at the Mayor, this is one of the classics in my opinion. Smells of piney aromatics, little citrus and hardly any malt. One of my favorite parts about this beer is the malt bill seems so simple. Vinnie lets the hops run the show. After drinking about half my glass my palate gets used to the bitterness, I am enjoying all of the hop complexity. Really loving the lacing as the glass continues to drain. A true classic IPA. Can't wait to drink another..."
"O: Tastes good, is well constructed, a nice refreshing summer beer, but not a stand out. This seems more like a pale ale or bitter, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Just that I was expecting more of a hop parade."
"Overall- I know I probably shouldn’t be comparing this to a pliny, but it being from the same brewery I don’t really know what else to compare it to. Definitely not in the same league as a pliny but definitely does come close, a little more bitter and more resin and pine flavours coming through and not as well balanced as its cousin I found. It does hit every typical IPA note but that’s what separates this from its big cousin the pliny, whereas the latter has such a nice balance and some added unexpected flavours, this one just comes through with the typical IPA flavours, and punches you in the taste buds with them, very bitter beer all the way till finish. Very happy I got the chance to try this though and I would definitely drink this one again in a heartbeat!"
"Pours a strangely-light clear straw with a quickly receding head. Not the burst of hops I expected. Really subdued. A bit watery in the mouth, with a strange, harsh finish. Some nice characteristics, certainly drinkable, but absolutely below-average. I’ve had a dozen better IPAs in the last week. I have really enjoyed Russian River, but this is a strange offering."
"Enjoying my first pint at Capone's. Very nice. Smoooh IPA. Virtually no head, but lots of lacing. A very light, refreshing beer. Would recommend, especially to thee that are typically adverse to IPA's. First of several IPA's to review today."
"O- Absolutely in my top 3 IPAS"
"Appearance is a pleasant golden color with a one finger head. It smells of pine, hops, and orange peel. While the taste has some of those components continued, there is also some caramel, grapefruit, resin coming through. The body is pleasant and easy with some bitterness in the finish. BP is a very good IPA and worth checking out."
"This one was bottled 4 days ago. Nice! Pours a clear, pale, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very hoppy with some lovely pine needle notes. A bit more of a malt aroma than I remember from past bottles I've had. Taste is Initially really clean hop flavor. Nice bitter pine flavor with some tasty citrus notes. Some nice grapefruit. Finishes with crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with some crispiness. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is a wonderful trademark California IPA! It's always a good night when I get my hands on some Pliny and Blind Pig."
"O: Fresher tasting out of the growler than the bottle, but the mouthfeel is still too thin for me. It’s an easy to drink brew though, and I will have no problem polishing off this growler."
"O- great, really good IPA. I love the malts with this beer. Such a different and great IPA."
"O: Delicious IPA, really drinkable, very similar to Pliny but with less hops and malt."
"O- Very good IPA, if it was more readily available it would definitely be a staple of my daily brews, but unfortunately, its not. I definitely see why they print right on the label, ""Keep Cold, Drink Fresh"" this beer definitely benefits from a colder temp. Cold, it is light bodied, easy drinking, hoppy, and refreshing."
"Medium body and carbonation for the style. Very good beer that I am looking forward to having again. I wanted to try Pliny and this side by side, but unfortunately O'Brien's was out of Pliny at the time of my visit."
"Well structured but the way the bitterness is delivered is not my favorite. Balanced IPA which delivers equal kick in the nose, flavor and alpha acids."
"Vinnie Cilurzo is kind of the Leonardo of the beer world: he is both artist and scientist, a masterful creator at everything he does. While Blind Pig is one of his simpler works, it is no less absorbing. It is a salt-of-the-earth agreeable, true grit hoppy offering that I could drink until I was a blind pig. This and it's brothers Pliny are rightfully royal family in the IPA world."
"Overall This is definately my favorite RR beer and maybe one of my favorite IPA's. On a hot summer day like today this beer definately comes in handy"
"I hate IPA's that are just bascally bitterness and no flavor. IPA's I think are made for hop flavor too."
"O-Great beer, its plinys cousin i would say...smells great and taste the same, when i pick up a pliny i pick up a pig as well...damn these beers are good"
"Overall, a great IPA. One of the best I've had. It drinks like an IIPA with a moderate ABV. Will have to hunt down some more bottles. The one left in my fridge isn't going to cut it."
"O- Great dry hopped aromas and flavors, as good as it gets for an American IPA"
"The Rest: The finish is sl lingering and the body is just on the thin side of medium. There's a good amount of carbonation that helps cut some of the hop profile and adds to the balance, but otherwise hops rule the day here. A very nice IPA, I'm good I was able to try this while vacationing in SF."
"O: Totally sessionable IPA with a great nose, good flavors and bitterness, and a nice mouthfeel. A go-to beer if I ever had one, now if only I lived in Cali..."
"O-its definitely an amazing IPA. it compares to the Elder, though I think the Elder happens to be slightly more robust, but only by a touch. its very well balanced, near perfect for an IPA."
"Overall: As for American IPA's (single, not double/imperial etc), this is one of the best I've experienced. Delightful aroma and a great combination of sweet and bitter."
"Overall - A fantastic IPA. Perfectly balanced. West-Coast to the end. Great work."
"Overall-IPAs are tough beers to transition too, Blind Pig will make it easy. It's very easy to drink, extremely easy. It has an amazing aroma and IPA flavors but not with too overpowering bitterness. Big thanks to Josh for this beer."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is light bodied with medium carbonation. It drinks pretty smoothly and is enjoyable. Overall, it's a pretty darn good IPA, and one I would have again. Very solid."
"Pours almost liquid gold, with a bright white head. Filtered and clear body. Nose has lots of bright citrus, orange, some light caramel and slight sugar notes. Mild tropical notes behind the citrus. Taste hits with some bitter pine and citrus, a bit of grain, and again, some tropical notes behind this. Loads of fruit, a bit of a caramel-sugar cookie sweetness and a bitter pine finish. Smooth and bitter feel, with an immense drinkability. I'm happy to have tried this, but this leaves me a bit of a sad panda (for the time being at least) knowing that Ontario is nowhere close to this quality of an IPA."
"D-Very tasty and easy drinking, I'd take this over it's more alcoholic and highly-rated brother, Pliny, any day of the week."
"Pale golden colour, nice white head with spots of lace on the glass. Smell is pine and citrus, mango, tangerine, soft malty presence, good balance in the nose. Taste is pine and citrus, dry hop with a nice malt backbone, lots of hops in this one, nice bitterness throughout, IBU is up there, clean and very satisfying. Mouthfeel is very oily and slick, good body, nice light carbonation. Great stuff overall, drinks very nicely, hoppy and well balanced, really good even at a five weeks old."
"Narrative: “Ah not another stupid Kevin James movie!” the children bemoaned in unison. To be fair, 11 years old is far too along in years to enjoy a three act train wreck of that magnitude. The babysitter chortled and guffawed a bit in protest, shaking his sleekly shaven face. “If Mall Cop is not the movie you start, what is it your disdain for this Paul Blart?” The kids perked up at the dapper disabled pig addressing them so casuistically. “Perhaps you harbor dislike from seeing Bewitched, well enjoy Will Smith and this movie Hitch” the dvd slide across the coffee table and Mr. Pig adroitly knocked it into the tray. He appeared overdressed at each of his assignments and, being blind, was hardly the pig for the job, yet somehow his panache and particular sense of aplomb put parents at ease. “I know you tire of little kid stuff, here’s flatulence jokes in this movie Grown Ups!” The children two stepped in syncopation loving their blind caretaker and tugging at the tails of his tuxedo lovingly."
"O - IMO, it's better than the Elder... Great brew. One of my all time favorite IPAs... RR nailed this one. Heck, RR does amazing jobs with IPAs, period. Tons of inescapable flavor that lingers long after your last sip.... Nice brew!"
"Right up there with PtE for an on-tap beer, great stuff."
"PP (Price Point) - $7 for a fresh pint less than 50 miles away from the brewery, spot on for the price, good stuff at this price!!"
"3.5 D: This isn't worth drinking if a Pliny is near (or any other decent IPA) and disappointing if you let the hype monster get a hold of you."
"o-I wish I could get this beer everywhere. The beer is a nice everyday IPA that is well constructed. Solid example of the style. As usual Vinnie and crew kick ass."
"O - This beer is pretty delicious. I still don't think its the best IPA out there but its still delicious."
"O- Excellent drinkability. One of the better IPA's I've ever had. An impressive balance of bitterness and candied tropical fruits makes this beer near perfect to me"
"This is an excellent IPA that gets overlook because of the big brother PtE. The orange notes of Blind Pig is more prominent than citrusy of PtE. This beer becomes rare and rarer to find since most people go for PtE since they are the same price range. IMO, Blind Pig holds it own ground and I have to drive a little further each time to make sure get some Pigs together with PtE. Thanks Vinnie for such a wonderful concoction."
"im not that much into ipas, but rr's dont make me crazy about them either."
"drinkability is extremely good. a toned down version of pliny the elder but just as smooth and enjoyable."
"A fine, fresh, hoppy IPA. Poured a hazy copper with a nice frothy white head that laced well. Big hoppy aroma, floral and fruity, with notes of grapefruit and lemon. Taste is of pine, resin, grapefruit, lemon zest and apricot, with a sweet malty background. Leaves a resinous, bitter aftertaste; crisp and drying. Medium-bodied and very drinkable."
"Drinking a fresh bottle courtesy of magictacosinus, my first since 2010. It's just as magical as I remember. This is the definition of world class. I bumped up the appearance and taste, slightly."
"This is a beer that lets you know you're drinking an IPA."
"O: Really high quality beer. I bet it would be a cracker when fresher."
"Appearance 4/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4.5/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4.5/5"
"O - I don't know if it is just me getting older, but I enjoy the fact that Blind Pig is so balanced with a lower abv% than a lot of IPAs out there. Very drinkable and one of the best IPAs on the planet. A perfect example of the west coast style."
"O - A very good IPA. I can definitely see where the hype came from. If this beer was more readily available to me it would definitely be a staple of mine"
"Overall: Easy to understand the hype on this beer. It is obviously well crafted. The hops and malt combine for great flavors that hit in waves and build in complexity throughout the bottle. Great beer!"
"O: Quite good IPA, top 5 easily. Very clean, crisp and well balanced. More or less perfect if you like citrusy IPAs."
"Overall, I would drink this regularly if I could. Looks, smells, and tastes great. 6.1% abv is nicely balanced with a lot of hops, and a juiciness that keeps you coming back for another sip."
"Overall I'm a little disappointed from this! I had a feeling I was going to like this a little more than Pliny the Elder, especially after reading about the two in a forum. I was very let down by how it's so just one note, being all hops. Clearly the defining character of the style, but I believe there should be more balance. I will always grab a Pliny instead of Blind Pig."
"Overall a flavorful hop forward light refreshing and smooth tasting IPA. I have been liking that more bars around town have but putting this on tap."
"O- I enjoyed the beer but I definitely won't be seeking it out."
"Verdict: An absolutely fantastic IPA from Russian River, it should come as no surprise that they have mastered the art of hoppy beers. The flavors across so wonderfully with such mild bitterness, this really is one of the most drinkable IPAs on the planet. This really is a must try for anyone who loves hops."
"O (D) - this is a great IPA. I am happy to have it. I wish I lived in CA."
"O - Overall, this is a clear favorite of mine. I honestly try to be conscientious about how many ""5.0"" scores I give out, but this one really hits the mark and is every bit deserving of the high scores BA's give it. It's amazing how drinkable this IPA is. There's no question that this would be my go-to-IPA all year long if it was available locally. I know this comparison has been made plenty of times, but even with as good as Pliny tastes, Blind Pig takes the cake for me."
"Sometimes it's hard to pick up this beer when it's sitting right next to a Pliny, but it shouldn't be ignored."
"O - Great IPA. Very high in drinkability. This bottle went pretty fast."
"the bottle. for now this will suffice."
"Overall is wow. if this were still drinkability, it'd get a 5. On the whole, it's hard to find a fault with this one. While I might get slapped in the face for saying this, blind pig casts a shadow over the cowering, pretentiously over-hopped Pliny. Blind pig is king."
"O - Delicious, spot on mouthfeel, low bitterness = me flying through a bottle. One of my shorter reviews thanks to me drinking this really quickly. Not a terribly complex or nuanced beer, but really enjoyable."
"I want to like this beer more. I want to get why this beer makes the top 100 and frankly I don’t get it. An extremely good IPA, but it just doesn’t have that something special to put it in the exceptional category."
"O: Great IPA. Fresher the better of course, but this was not too bad. Have had it fresh on draft at Russian river in April 2010, which was great too. I prefer Pliney the Elder, but this is not a bad consolation either."
"O: The hype was warranted!... especially considering the fact that this was only $4.50/bottle. Yummy!"
"Overall an excellent beer but couldn't go with an all out exceptional because of its one trick pony attributes (but it's one he'll of a trick!)."
"Body is thinnish but keeping well within IPA territory. This beer is frightfully drinkable. Worth the hype."
"The aroma of this beer is phenomenal. It has a really fresh hop smell that sets it apart from some of my other favorite IPAs like Bell's Two Hearted and Victory Hop Devil. Really well balanced with moderate bitterness that balances out and finishes loooong. It has a great full mouthfeel for an IPA and it's really pretty stellar. Lacing stays on the side of the glass sticks around for a long time."
"I could easily see this being a go-to AIPA if I lived on the Left Coast, and found this to be extremely accessible. It's something I would return to more often then PtE, and could certainly put a few back if given the opportunity. Thumbs up."
"Poured into a ccb pint. Pours a golden amber with a 2 finger head. Very clear and crisp, lots of carbonation. Aromas of citrusy hops, smells like summer. Taste has a good balance of malts and hops bitter but not too bitter, just enough to make you want more. Very smooth and refreshing, this is a near perfect ipa! Blind pig flies under the radar due to pliny, but it really deserves more recognition!"
"Overall, a quality IPA, hop forward, but retaining good balance. i would recommend to anyone and it is a beer that is well worth seeking out. Thanks SolomonGrundy for the trade!"
"O: very great IPA.. has some resemblance of PtE but not greatly.."
"An absolute gem of an IPA. It ranks with the best I've ever tried. An incredibly drinkable, delicious beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, it's an excellent beer with a very nice, drinkable character."
"O: Great, great IPA. At 6% I could drink this all day long."
"I remember liking this beer more a year ago. Its not bad at all just hard to stand up to all the other west coast IPAs."
"Had on draft at torando. Came out looking an orange amber without much head from a pint glass. Nose was typical of a solid ipa/borderline apa, piney hoppy bitter notes, citrus was mostly lemon and a nice bready note. Taste was very refreshing and easy drinking pretty much following the nose. The hops brought a slight floral character along with a touch of grapefruit and a pleasant forest note with a good malt backbone. Very well done i just find that pliny and blind pig are both very good beers i was just hoping for more complexity out of them. Blind pig to me really tasted similar to pliny with just a different malt bill."
"o: great IPA from RR. Haven't been disappointed by them yet. The PtE is surely better and this is too bitter (comparatively speaking) given the lower abv. If i could get this often, I'd go for it now and again but there are a few IPA's I'd rather spend the time pursuing. Perhaps I'll attempt revisiting this once more down the road, though overall very nice."
"O- Easy drinkability, very refreshing taste, did not live up to the aroma, but still a solid IPA from Russian River that I would drink on a regular basis if it was available."
"O-> Glad I finally got to try this one. Very well balanced with the hops and the sweetness. It was nice to try the beer that sort of sneaks under the radar with all the attention that Pliny always gets and make no mistake this is a wonderfully crafted brew. Even after a few days over a month in the bottle this one stands up for itself in a crowded field and I could even see this as a porch beer down @ the beach house this summer. Fantastic. Will definitely seek out another Blind Pig or 4, and maybe try to catch a couple closer to the bottling date. Cheers!"
"Overall - It's very tasty, if you're into huge hop bombs. It's actually quite impressive that a single IPA at 6.1% can have this much hoppiness. The downside is that it really isn't balanced."
"O- A nice smooth bitter IPA. All hop flavor, no malt, which is OK with me. Definitely hits the spot."
"D-Overall this is just a Big hop bomb ipa. Which is ok and it gets the job done. Wish it had alittle more going on with it . but overall it is a good beer."
"O - Very good, especially for a standard IPA. This really seems like it belongs more in the DIPA category, if not for Pliny. Very enjoyable, especially since it's a pretty fresh bottle, from 3/11."
"BP is the brew for me! While not over bearingly hoppy the Blind Pig still packs a punch. Superbly balanced with a light and creamy body. Highly recommended for those who are looking to get into hoppier beers."
"O - a bottle that arrived in the mail today [thanks petecz!] and was eager to pop it..but i let it sit in the fridge all day, and was greatly rewarded as I sat on my patio... bottled 3/22/11 ~ this is a beer I wish was distrubted in Illinois... will definitely have to snag more in the future!"
"Bottle to (frosted) tulip. The shizzle! Thanks (again) to Dempsey16 for this delicious brew! The only IPA I've tried that's better is the one I had right before this one (Sculpin). Fantastic across the board. Some beers don 't need words; they need sips..."
"Overall, a very nice IPA. It's more hop-forward - the sweetness really takes a back seat. Not sure the balance is quite where I would want it to be after being spoiled by some world class DIPAs, but a very solid, solid IPA."
"Overall, an interesting IPA. I'm used to a more citrus biterness thses days but this is more piney and earthy to me."
"drinkability: a good IPA with a decent backbone, 4 months old and drank very well. very impressed"
"Overall, I love it."
"Good beer, but not quite to the level I hope to find in a Russian River bottle."
"Drink and overall: overall, this is an enjoyable IPA. Being from the land of Two Hearted, I like to try out these west coast IPAs."
"O: Even at almost a month old, this is a monster of a beer. Incredibly well crafted, this is a no nonsense west coast IPA that makes no excuses for itself. With all the Pliny hype that surrounds Russian River, this offering gets lost in the mix sometimes, but make no mistake, it stands toe to toe with its far more famous brothers."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As stated above, well-balanced and complex. Very light bodied and easily drinkable. Perfect to enjoy in any fashion. A perfect amount of bitterness, sweetness and rough citrus. A solid IPA."
"Final thought - I would drink this beer more often if you could get it more often. Feel bad for people on the east coast, cause you can't get this beer"
"D - Great taste and lowish ABV. Very sessionable"
"Yes! Huge thanks to Carleton for this one. Great orange honey color with a loose bubbly white head. Citrusy and bubble gum hops on the nose, a sweet fruity and pungent aroma. A blast of fresh juicy, fruity and citrus. The hops create an almost chewy texture. Perfect balance of bitter hop flavor and malt. One of the best ipas I've had period.."
"Of the RR IPAs that I've had, this one is definitely my preferred."
"O=Good beer overall, and just another reason for me to rue the fact I live outside of Russian River's distribution"
"o: a top tier ipa in a field shared with very few others, it drinks perfectly and pounds all my hop pleasure buttons - it's truly a beer-tragedy that RR isn't available to me regularly"
"O: A good beer, and one that goes down easily. Very solid flavor, even if it didn't appeal to me enough to make this one go really fast."
"Overall: I want this fresh because what I have here is incredible and I want to see how much it has fallen off. Given the opportunity I would certainly seek this out and highly recommend it to other IPA lovers."
"Excellent IPA, undoubtedly a top tier offering. Everything about this beer is on point. The aroma and flavor is assertive but well balanced. The drinkablity does reach the dangerously high level rather quickly. If you have not had the opportunity I would advise that you seek this one out."
"500ml bottle. Bottled on 3/2/11. Pours a clear copper with a one finger white head with good retention that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is huge resinous pine with a bit of grapefruit. A little bit of pineapple and some orange peel as well. A little bit of bready malt comes through in the aroma. Initial taste has a hint of sweetness going into strong pine hops with a bit of grapefruit. A little bit of orange as well. Finish is some of the bready malt with a strong, but not too strong bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. One of the best IPAs out there."
"Overall, a really good West Coast IPA that is prototypically hop-forward, but something holds it back from greatness. I'd definitely buy it again, but it's almost too easy to pass this up for Pliny."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly well done, with a lightness to go with the flavorful body I have not seen done this well very often. Never gets watery, and never gets too heavy either. Carbonation is weak and perfect, offering a bit of life but fading quickly to allow enjoyment of flavors. Drinkability is the best in any beer I've ever had, regardless of style. 1) The abv is conducive to longer sessions; 2) the finish is neutral enough that the beer never gets boring or overpowering; and 3) the beer is flat out awesome in every regard. I've had my fair share of IPAs and DIPAs since the last time I had this, and right now this is beating all of them. Incredible beer."
"I am new to the beer game, but I enjoy Pliny more than this one, but this is what was on tap so I enjoyed it. Why do I like Pliny better"
"The appearance was a golden caramel color with a white frothy head. The head retention seemed better than most IPAs, but after a couple minutes it faded. The aroma is quite strong, but it's a fantastic blend of flowers, citrus like oranges and hints of pine. In terms of taste, this beer has it all and was very fresh! Perfect balance of toasted caramel malts giving it just the right amount of sweetness. The sweet caramel and hints of honey, along with the perfect amount of bitterness coming from the hops was just was like a symphony on the tongue and an overture for the nose. I'd say it's a medium-bodied ale, probably on the heavy end for IPAs, but I'll tell you what this ranks up there as probably my favorite IPA of all time. Thin creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable? Heck yea, pour me another!"
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable overall. I could definitely see enjoying a few of these on a nice spring or summer day on the back deck. If only we got RR in MA..."
"I prefer this beer on tap. It certainly isn't gonna be the most extreme beer on tap at your local beer bar, but if you see it buy one. This would be a great ""pitcher beer"" -- good drinkin!"
"D: Well, it's a low ABV IPA without much sweetness and isn't heavy in the mouth. This is a summer brew that is very drinkable, just not chugging it down like a madman drinkable."
"D - Very high. Blind pig has very good balance with plenty of drinkability left over. I love this stuff but I still prefer elder a bit more."
"M/D- nice, creamy, light body with a toght, fine carbonation. This is a great beer, but IMO it just doesn't quite have enough of a malt backbone to keep up with the slamming the hops lay down on your tongue."
"Huge thanks to nickd717 for this one. Bottle is dated 2/14/11. It's an excellent beer to commemorate the end of the regular season for my Boilermakers. It pours a beautiful gold in color, very translucent and clear with a one finger frothy white head. It smells of dry piny hops with bitter grapefruit. It's very piny with a light malt finish. The flavor is riddled with pine cones with a slightly sweet and bitter grapefruit aftertaste. It's definitely a solid IPA. It drinks light and is pretty drinkable but it really gives you cotton mouth. Luckily this fades the longer you drink it. It eventually turns mouth watering. It's probably one of the most drinkable IPAs around. I'm definitely thankful for the tick."
"D - The thinner mouthfeel and 6.1% ABV makes this a very sessionable beer."
"D- very easy drinking ipa and I see no barriers to drinking many of these in a session. This would make a great six pack beer."
"Great beer, Currently drinking one straight from the bottle. This is Something you can drink all day, this bottle is from 01 12 11, still holding up its flavor/hoppyness, not watered down/flat tasting. I cannot wait to get a newer bottle release of this to update the review. Nom!"
"Overall, the Pig doesn't disappoint but it isn't Elder or Younger catagory. I would definitely enjoy this brew agin in the future."
"I'm flabbergasted this is rated as one of the world's 100 best beers."
"The bottle explains that a ""Blind Pig"" was a term for beer you would get during prohibition. This definitely could pass as moonshine..."
"Pours a lazy golden orange hue. About a half inch of head. Pretty minimal lacing. What a wonderful smelling beer. Sweet floral and pine. Citrus and hop aroma mixed in the bunch too. Delightful. The taste isn't quite like it smells. Kinda medicinal actually. The carbonation and hop hit your tongue immediately but then then left with a slightly off, kinda medicinal flavor. It's not bad though. As it warms the taste opens up a bit more. It is slightly muted over all though. The carbonation is very good and goes down well enough. I'd like to take on a slightly fresher example of this and compare my notes."
"Bling Pig really is Pliny's little brother. Not a bad beer in its own right however, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"pop top on this one two months too late (i think). Can smell hop aroma but its not very pungent. It's like smelling fruit juice that are not fresh . Orange to golden orange in color, with half inch whittish head and minimal lacing which goes away quick. Citrusy in flavor, pineapple and other tropical fruits. Malty with sweetness. Bitter but not as hoppy as a double IPA like it's sister Pliny the Elder. Smooth and dry, very, very drinkable. all in all not the one of the best ipa's ive ever had but i've got to hold pliney responsibale for setting the standers so high for me on this one. with all that said maybee i should try one fresh not two and half months old."
"Absolutely delicious!"
"Very session worthy, not a lot of sticky pine in the finish too."
"D- This is a solid IPA, and was a treat to try. I feel it was easy to drink and enjoy. I have heard people compare it to Pliny, and I see where they are coming from, but this is not good. I would buy it from time to time if I could get it locally."
"this beer pours a hazy slightly darker golden color. you can see tiny particles floating in the beer. there is a 2 finder white head when the beer is poured, that slowly recedes leaving lacing on the glass, and a small cap on the beer. The smell is slightly piney and resinous, with the main hop aroma being citrusy with a small hint of the malt. the taste is very citrusy and juicy upfront with a small amount of malt character to hold it together with the bitterness. the mouthfeel is good and dry, almost completely dry, except for the small amount of sweetness lent from the malt. this is a drinkable beer, that i would consume more often if it were locally available and reasonably priced."
"T: Strong pine hops at the start with a nice malt backbone that kicks in right before the finish. The finish is smooth without being overly bitter. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but this one is still pretty tasty."
"Maybe This IPA is a little past its drink by date, but I have had double troubles 3 months after bottling and it still tasted amazing."
"This straw to slightly deeper yellow with a nice white head beer leaves good spider lacing on the glass. The aroma of pine, grass and slight herbs are picked up on the nose. The taste is much the same, very grassy and the mouthfeel is drying. It was pretty carbonated and almost too 'sharp' in the mouth. This is a very good little brother of the Elder and a good example of the single IPA style."
"Very well balanced. Too bad it isn't widely distributed so more people can enjoy this gem."
"Hats off to RR for making such exceptional beer. There are 5 or 6 other beers that I would give this grade or higher to."
"The drinkability is natural. There is nothing offensive about Blind Pig. This brew is well portioned and is a solid example of a good ole American IPA, but it is not one that brashly outshines other worthy selections in this category like its famous cousin does. Solid but not legendary."
"Cheers..."
"D: Has similar characteristics of Pliny, just on a lesser scale. This is an excellent IPA, nicely balanced, just like PtE and not a trace of alcohol present. A definite must try IPA."
"D- This is a thirst quenching brew to be enjoyed year round."
"A stylish IPA that helped define the american ipa style - glad I finally got to try it."
"D: I gotta get this one again when its super fresh and give it another go."
"I'm not sure if it's the beer or me on this, but not terribly impressed with Blind Pig. A bad bottle maybe? A lot of recent reviews mentioned a clear look to the beer while mine was slightly hazy. To be perfectly honest, if this were a blind tasting, I would have scored everything .5 lower, but Russian River's reputation buys them benefit of the doubt. I'll try this again for sure and will update this review if I get different results."
"I could drink this beer all night. It's simply delicious. Compared to the hype that Pliny gets, this is my go-to IPA from Russian River. AMAZING."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but drinks a little lighter. Carbonation fits very nicely. Extremely drinkable, really like this one. Russian River did well with Blind Pig."
"D: If these were local, I'd drink them all day."
"thanks to cduckett for the SUPERB extra!"
"Poured from a bottle into a SN tulip. Creamy white 1/2 "" head with very nice lacing. A deep golden orange color. Smell was as expected with a West Coast IPA - clean grapefruit and piney notes. How I wish these type brews were a little closer to my place of residence! Taste was excellent - smooth and balanced. An excellent example of a high quality IPA, this ranks up near the top for me."
"This is an easy drinking IPA. Not as assertive as big brother Pliny (nor should it be), Blind Pig is a solid entry in the American IPA category."
"All in all, wow! This brew started off stellar, but ended up mediocre. The appearance and smell were so good! The other categories is where this brew falls short. Definitely try if you like RR, but Elder is better IMO."
"-Bye"
"One of the most delicate, smooth and soft IPAs that I've ever had. I would dare to say this is the most drinkable IPA in the world. Totally worth it. I'd love to session this one, too bad I can't get it on a regular basis."
"Pours a light orangish yellow. With a good amount of whit head with giant bubbles. Geat lacing. Smells of grapefruit and citrus. A bit of pine on the now as well... A solid mouthfeel and lot of hops on the tongue. Wow. I think this one is better than pliny! Very tasty and highly drinkable"
"A must try."
"Probably my favorite AIPA, this one did not disappoint."
"Drinkability is great. This is one of the best single IPA offerings I have ever had. Definitely in the top 5. At 6% ABV I could easily drink a few of these. Another awesome addition to the hop-forward Russian River beers."
"Wildly drinkable. A unique balance of big hop flavors, amazing mouthfeel, and unparalleled drinkability. One of the best crafted renditions of the style I've experienced. I'm personally not a hype-fanatic, but this one lives right on up to it."
"D- Very high, no alc. An awesome daily drinker that is very affordable."
"This afternoon calls for a deluge of hops. Get some! This salvo pours a clear apple juice topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, pine, light leek, and ruby red grapefruit. The taste holds notes of grapefruit rind, mint, pine, light leek, and a much more subdued caramel. The body is a a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice IPA, heavy on the hops without overdoing it. Good times here."
"Had this on tap at the Horse Brass pub in Portland. Serves in an imperial pint. It's a nice copper color, mine didn't have much of a head, but it sounds like most think it displays a good head when they pour themselves. Smell is of strong citrus and hops. Taste has some grapefruitiness and the hops, with just a touch of malt. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Overall, it's a dang good IPA. Sort if what one would expect from Russian river."
"really sets the ipa standard"
"Drinkablity is high. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Pours a golden orange color with fairly decent not too long lasting white foam on the surface. There is a decent not of pine, the closest I've come to smelling the tree itself in this beer. The flavor itself wasn't nearly as bitter as I was expecting the most flavor I got was of the 2-row barley used in the grist bill. I still think the beer was good, there was a residual sweetness to it, but in all honesty I wasn't going crazy over it. Still I'm glad to have had it, it was a good very highly drinkable IPA."
"Great, immense hop flavor without getting very big as a beer. It's not so much a truck load of hops as it is enhancing and isolating the hop flavors."
"D - I would drink this beer and I would drink it again and again."
"Thanks to Augustgarage for this one- my second Russian River experience (Pliny was first). Bottled on 11-19-10, poured into my Dfh tulip glass on 1-15-11. Pours a yellow-orange color, very little foamy head that quickly dies, leaving very little glass lacing. Some hop aromatics on the nose, a little pine and grapefruit, but nothing overpowering or out of the ordinary here. On the first taste, the hops are present but seem subdued. With what I have read about RR, this one is sadly probably past its prime and has lost some of its luster. Still a very good ipa that I would love to drink again, and hopefully have a fresher bottle or find it on tap."
"D= Very drinkable easy to drink and very smooth really enjoyable."
"Pliny and now this. Russian River's IPAs age like milk, even when they're in the fridge the whole time. This is drinkable enough, but it seems it's become a rather middling IPA. I'll seek it out on tap in the future."
"The nose is very nice but not overpowering. The balance of the hops and the bite hits just perfect. The hop flavor is complex, as it hits you with citrus at first with a piney finish. Great IPA, and a pleasure to drink."
"This is a nice IPA, typical of what you would expect from a West Coast hop heavy IPA. As you would expect from RR's non-sour beers, there is a lot of hop nuance too. For a person who is not fond of overly hoppy beers, this is one that I could see stocked regularly in my fridge."
"I had a Blind Pig a day after I had Pliny the Elder. This was another beer I held high expectations as I was told this beer gave off a close resemblance to Pliny the Elder although some claimed Blind Pig was better. The beer gave off a hazy golden and burnt-orange appearance, citrus and hoppy smell, and a smooth bitterness resembling PTE but less pine in taste. Definitely a dry hoppy beer and I think this beer slightly edges PTE by personal preference."
"Smell is very fruity and citrusy! Can smell hoppy aroma. It's like smelling fruit juice. Orange to golden orange in color, with half inch whittish head and minimal lacing which goes away quick. Citrusy in flavor, pineapple and other tropical fruits! Malty with sweetness. Bitter but not as hoppy as a double IPA like it's sister Pliny the Elder. Smooth and dry, very, very drinkable. Wish the store lets me take out two or more bottles when it's available. So delicious and highly recommended."
"The CPJ"
"We don't get this in bottles in Portland anymore so I have to find it on tap. I love this beer an think about it often. I am hoping we get it back in bottles soon."
"Drinkabilty - Simular to pliny but not as pine bitter, more malt presence and not as strong. Fantastic at 6% drink up a few and enjoy. A real treat, i think i like this more then pliny, maybe...."
"D: This is a good IPA that is well focused. The only fault I can find is that, well, Pliny is its older brother (and younger)."
"Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured hazy golden color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy sour citrus hop aroma. Medium to full body with a oily slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy bitter flavor with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. Very good brew."
"Overall a miss for me just because of my style preferences, but I can see how some would enjoy."
"Drink- Very easy drinking. No residual taste or palate coating at all."
"D - Dangerously drinkable, I wish this was more common. I'd pick this out of almost any other IPA, perhaps only Sculpin."
"Chewy body that's on the fuller end of the spectrum with lots of extremely fresh juicy hop flavor and slight bitterness that lingers throughout. As in the aroma, there are lots of tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as some earthy pine needle and slight malt characteristics. Again, I'm picking up hits of mango and pineapple as well and grapefruit and citrus peel. Slight earthy resinous hops balance out the sweetness and their is just a touch of pale malt to balance out the bitterness. The ABV is extremely well masked makng this delicious beer dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"D - This is one hell of a beer. I think this brew is probably underrated because people will always consider it side by side with the Plinys and RRB's fantastic Wild Ales. This is a fantastic beer in every sense of the word. Extraordinary. I hope I can get my hands on this again. This is truly great."
"On tap at Toronado in San Francisco. I'm so excited to finally try this that I don't care that I'll be at Russian River in a couple days, I need to have this now. Pours a bright orange colour with a finger of white head that lasts the whole pint. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of huge pine and citrus hops. I just want to smell this forever. Really nice kick of bitterness in the flavour, some malt balance as well. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
"A mini Pliny the Elder; this great 'little' IPA has got it all. I have yet to put any of their sour under my belt but Russian River is really impressive."
"This is a good beer, but not as earth-shattering as the preponderance of reviews led me to believe. I consider myself a hophead, but I can run off 5 IPAs better than this one without an effort. Glad I tried it, would get it again without a thought, but it's in the crowd, not at the front of it IMO."
"I drink this beer a few times a week, so I would say it is quite drinkable."
"pretty high drinkability. Low ABV but I'd opt for a Sculpin over this. Reminds me of what an old Pliny would probably taste like. Being made my RR, I'd definitely grab a fresh pliny over this any day. it's still a great beer, but it's hard to choose this over something else. I definitely wouldnt pass one up however. If I mysteriously saw this in the stores here I'd snatch them up too"
"A very balanced AIPA that showcases the hop flavor and the ABV is respectable. The flavor isn't outrageous but its good. Very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"D-Awesome."
"Pretty good drinking beer, but could have been better."
"Overall, I have a very high opinion of all of the Russian River beers I have had, and this met my high expectations."
"Overall very happy with Russian River products makes me wish I lived in California."
"Overall, a nice IPA from Russian River. I'm not completely overwhelmed by it but it is definitely a very good IPA. I would recommend getting this if it is available to you and trading for it if its not. Glad I had the chance to try it. Cheers!"
"M/D-pretty bitter aftertaste but an easy drinker. another one for the hop-heads, but not filling at all and it's a super smooth brew."
"Pours a light amber color, with a small sticky head. Aroma is clean pine, citrus, flowers and a touch of cannabis. This tastes great; just a tiny bit too rough to get a perfect score. Mouthfeel is likewise nearly perfect, tilted a bit too much to the bitter side. The slight malt flavors help with this though. Very drinkable, I like this better than Pliny."
"D- Very tasty, but not something I'd want to slug. Maybe a good yard work beer."
"(44th)"
"Huge fluffy head, leaves globs of lacing! Nice cloudy orange/yellow color. Pine hop smells of course, followed by distinct apricot. Other citrus such as manderin oranges, and pineapple. This is more earthy than pliny. Tastes of very oily pine, apricots and bitter lingering hops. Oily mouthfeel, wile still being smooth to drink. Nice!"
"Another excellent Hoppy brew from RR. Any hop head should love this."
"D - Another dangerously drinkable RR IPA. Incredibly well balanced and easy to drink. Very refreshing and one that you keep wanting to drink. Hopefully I can snag a few bottles of this sometime."
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ, Seal Beach. Deep golden pour with a fine off-white head that leaves a wonderful amount of lace on the glass. Nose and taste are citrusy, grapefruit hops with an elegant malt backbone. Finish is just the right amount of hop bitter without being too biting. An excellent IPA."
"Excellent range of hop flavors melding into a bitter, but not abrasive, clean finish. I would be seriously surprised if any more hop flavor could be enjoyably packed into a beer. Juicy, resinous, flowery, ganja-esque lupulin madness! Yup, this is one fine IPA. Malts are mild mannered and grainy with a light kiss of sweetness. This could really be an APA just as easily as an IPA. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and lowish-ly carbonated, makes for fast drinking. Goes down very easy...right up there with Sculpin for best IPA I have had."
"This is a great beer -- packs more wallop than most DIPAs I've had. I feel like I could have one or two more, though I'm not sure I'd be able to taste it for much longer with the palate-impact this packs. Very enjoyable. Thanks again, ShadesOfGray!"
"D: High. I love IPA's, and this is an exceptional one. If it was readily available in PA I would make a habit of drinking this regularly."
"D - This is one of the best IPAs that I've had super easy to drink with its great taste I could drink this all night definitely worth getting if you see it around"
"A damn fine treat from one of the top breweries in the world. Keep them coming Vinnie, but in the future please ship bottles to PA, please!"
"Another brew that my thanks go out to Adam for cheers heaps mate,the brew pours a vibrant orange/pineapple hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head with heaps of lacing everywhere looks spot on,the smells are honeysuckle,citrus and pine needles,the mouthfeel for an IPA is super smooth,light medium bodied and super sessionable and leaves tastes of pineapple,lychee,passionfruit,light golden malts and finishes with a dry stonefruit bitterness,overall its a top brew that is really balanced out,very easy to knock back while still allowing the flavours to mingle on your palette and im so glad ive finally gotten a chance to sample it and look forwards to rest of their lineup."
"D - Like a sumo wrestler in a zorb ball, the blind pig's powerhouse flavor profile is wrapped in a buoyant sphere of balance and body. This is a quintessential American IPA, with the versatility to succeed in any environment, and the ability to satisfy until the cows come home."
"Overall another treat enjoyed from bottle. I just love the Russian River IPAs, top notch. This is rightfully so the little brother of PtE, but it's still a damn fine beer."
"Cheers!"
"Pours from the bottle with a thin white head which dissipates fairly quickly. This beer smells hoppy but not sweet. Citrus and pine notes. The taste is wonderful, all hops and citrus, I can tell there is some malt in there I'm just not sure exactly where it is. The hops are amped up in this one without much malt to balance them out. This is a wonderful hop bomb without the sugary sweetness that usually accompanies this level of hops. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but not at all unpleasant. This is a very drinkable beer and would be a good choice for a sessionable IPA."
"MF/D: Light and smooth, crisp and clean. Very enjoyable drink. Wish I could have it more, but it'll be a long time until we see this sold in PA I suppose."
"pours a clear amber color with a 1 finger head and good lacing..smell is full pine and citrus hops with a floral and grapefruit smell..malts in the background..taste is much the same its a ipa full of pine and grapefruit tastes it has a great tasty hop profile it rounded out with a touch of caramel malts..mouth feel is medium well carbonated lots of flavor..drink ability is high its so good so drinkable..could down several of these ..really liked this one"
"D-Highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"D-- Very good. Not massive and over the top like other IPA's. Well designed and thought out. Flavors are well balanced and the ABV is basically zilch. Would buy another, especially considering the price."
"I feel bad because I can pick them up near by. Great one overall."
"overall, wow this is a good beer. I wish I could get more easily"
"And in the meantime I might have to find another substitute for PBR. A man can only drink so many..."
"D. Damn. How do they make these so drinkable? I had a PtE and now this and they're just made to drink and drink. Plus the bottles are just the right size that you don't feel bad opening another one up when you finish the first."
"D: I'm following this up with a bottle of PtE, and I hope that this a good preview, very drinkable, even sessionable IPA."
"I could drink many of these and probably would if more readily available in Seattle."
"What kind of deal with the devil do I have to make to get RR in texas? LOL"
"D-Very drinkable. Alcohol is masked perfectly. One of the more intense tasting IPAs i've had. Once again, Russian River blows my mind."
"Excellent IPA that blends well with any spicy meal."
"Follows the nose. Starts with pine and then rounds into nice notes of lemon and orange. A touch of pineapple is there, but is shadowed by the lemon and orange flavor. Touch ofcaramel from the malt, but barely noticeable. Nice brew."
"Golden with a slight chill haze, dense head with great retention and pleny of lace. Citrus aroma with a hint of malt. Some noticeable carbonation up front. Pine middle. Bitter back end, but surprisingly light for the amount of IBUs."
"This is the perfect session IPA. Pours a golden orange color with a soapy white head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and pine, with hints of peach and perhaps honey. Has a nice sweet start, then comes the bitter hit with a nice creamy finish. Some sweetness through the finish. Vinnie knows his pale ales."
"Poured out of a bottle. Good head with a lot of carbonation. smells great! citrus and hops fight jockey for position. amazing hops w/ citrus taste. mouthfeel is a little watery, but nothing to complain about. this is incredibly drinkable. i really wish i had two bottles. maybe not the best ipa ive ever had, but one of them. west coast what can you say. great beer"
"I could certainly session this, but I'd rather go down the road for a Pelican IPA."
"SkÅL!"
"D - I could probably live on this, especially at only 6% ABV. This is a true treat, and does not deserve the second-fiddle status it has when compared to PtE."
"D: Easy to drink. ABV is low enough you could have quite a few of these."
"Appears a perfectly pale see through copper color. Thick slightly off white head, long lasting fine evenly spread detailed lacing. I love the spiel about the blind pig, I never caught the connection with the namesake of this white whale. Aromatics are amazing the highlight of this fine single IPA super grapefruit, floral aggressive West Coast hop additions. There's also a touch of vegetal/onion notes but not overbearing this stuff is nice. This stuff is fresh from a shipment from South Bay Drugs, bottled 9/29/10. It doesn't get much fresher, I just ordered the Pliny they just got in as well. Flavor is excellent bitter dry finish up front hints of cracker semi sweet malt tones wrapped with fresh bursting hops. The hop flavors provide herbal, dry grassy, citrus in this case grapefruit, and a touch of floral veggie notes. Super dry bitter finish this stuff is ideal for drinkability. Medium bodied slightly slick with hop oils, mild easy going carbonation with a bone dry finish. Drinkability overall is killer a beer I could buy a keg of and introduce mainstream beer drinkers to hops, but why waste this nectar on newbies. I earned this experience, not this best single IPA but it's definitely up there."
"Drinkability- While I'm not nearly as big of a fan as Pliny, I would definitely come back to this beer at times. There's certain beers that I feel are good representations of their style, but I wouldn't necesarily come back to them. This one, while there are little things I don't like about all of it, when you combine everything, it kind of works. It goes down pretty smooth and I'd drink it again"
"Drink- Keep em coming please if the store I got mine at didnt have a 1 bottle limit. For a IPA and not being such a fan, I found a new fav to always try to have at home."
"The feel of this beer is a bit big with the bitterness giving this beer a handful. It goes eventual subside and goes down smooth. A great west coast IPA."
"Awesome brew. If only IPAs, in general, were easier to session. As far as this one goes, kind of takes control of your palate for the rest of the night. I don't know if I could have another one, or anything else, after. Edit: just noticed it's only 6.1%abv. If I were a bigger hophead than I am I would definitely go for one more. A hop bomb this strong holds its own against 7.5%+ offerings, I thought for sure it was higher."
"Drinkability: More. Please."
"Overall a superior IPA."
"After Pliny, this beer flows like water in my household...Pours a straw colored gold in color. About half a inch of head develops on the pour. Smell is very citrusy and juicy. Wonderful. Taste is even more citrusy and juicy hops than appear in the nose. Light, bitter, but exploding with juciness. I love this. It's an overused expression, but, I could drink this all day long and never tired of it. I might even go out on a limb and say that I'm enjoying this more then the PtE."
"I go back and forth on Blind Pig, but there's no denying it's a fabulous beer. Dry as the day is long with a rich, complex hoppy nose, long in earthiness and fruit with pine and cotton candy. On the palate this is a bit aspirin-y, a nice, medium body and a finish that's almost crackling with resin. If I have any complaint it's that the dryness is almost a touch much on top of the resin, leading to a bit of an empty mid-palate. This is quibbling. I love it. Less than Pliny the Elder, and it's far superior to their standard IPA (""far"" being relative, that's a solid beer as well). If I could buy this for a buck or two less, or by the six pack for what I can get Ruination, say, I'd have this all the frickin' time."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a orange-ish hint and a white head. In the aroma, grapefruit and orange citrus and a mango like hint. In the taste, grapefruit and orange citrus, and big pine like hop presence. Almost like chewing on a hop and orange rinds. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. with a semi dry grapefruit rind aftertaste. A smooth, big west coast IPA. Fantastic!"
"Taste is a bit sweeter and maltose than Pliny which is to be expected, the hops are a bit less in you're face but the carbocation balances out the body very well. It's really a solid and drinkable IPA."
"very drinkable."
"D: High."
"D - Solid IPA. After drinking this, I can see why it is so highly rated. A west coast hop bomb all the way. However, I thought this beer was maybe a tad too bitter - I like my IPAs to showcase sweeter flavors. Other than that, not bad by any means. I have a PTE in the fridge right now, can't wait to see how the two compare. Thanks to MaxStout for sending this my way."
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth, easy to drink. Has a nice combination of hop bitterness and sweetness, with the hop bitterness being more dominant, as it should be. I wish this beer was more readily available online. I would buy it all the time if it was, along with Pliny the Elder of course."
"Drinkability -- This is pretty amazing. World-class IPA undoubtedly. Great hop profile and the malt character is very well balanced. Top tier."
"D: The drinkability of this beer is through the roof--it disappears effortlessly and only disappoints the drinker when it inevitably yields an empty glass. Truly the little brother of Russian River's other notable IPAs--the sensory qualities detected here remind the drinker that, while each is distinct in its own way, there is much in all three that unifies them as genetically-gifted blood relations."
"Tasted from bottle obtained in a trade. Pours a hazy dull orange with a thick white head that leaves heavy lace. Nose is mango with resinous hops, and a hint of honey and caramel malt. Flavors are good tropical fruitiness with pineapple and mango, pine resin hops, and somewhat toasty malt. There is almost an acidity to this beer. The body is fairly light with average carbonation and a nice long pine finish. This is an outstanding IPA."
"Drinkability was fine, got though the bottle myself, alcohol wasn't too much, bitterness isn't mouth puckering. Great IPA."
"This beer is very drinkable and I throw back a few of these anytime. Similar in style to Pliney the Elder, this beer is a great one by itself."
"On the taste, bitterness comes through early yet doesn't build; almost as if it peaks right at the start. Pale malts, light grapefruit, oranges; flavorful and not astringent yet salty on the finish. The carbonation is medium high while the body is light which makes the beer very easy to drink, but not a personal preference. The beer is definitely a solid, easily quaffable IPA."
"Bottled 9/7/10, drank 9/27/10 from a cold pint glass. Pours a beautiful amber ""que lindo es"" with a 1/4"" head. The aroma on this is absolutely amazing, like fresh-baked pineapple upside cake wafting from an open window on a hawaiian ranch. The taste at first is wonderful, just a flood of flavor with a feel of almost impossible balance of water and creaminess, facilitated by the beautiful bead on the bubbles. The lingering bitterness may be too much for some. But all good things at a price. Including tracking bottles of this down."
"drinks amazing. easily made its way into my top few IPAs on this first tasting. bottled only 2 weeks ago, so its still drinking near or at its peak, and it shows. not a ""big"" beer, but its complex and flavorful. Pleasure to try."
"I could drink this all day, if I didn't have to get it in the mail. One of my favorite IPAs of all time."
"Drinkibility: This is a very nice IPA. Not difficult to down this bottle. More about the hops than the malts which fits the West Coast style. Wish I could've tryed a little fresher bottle."
"D- Man, I could drink a ton of this stuff, but the sheer enormity of flavors is nearly a turnoff. An excellent beer and perhaps my new favorite IPA. I wish I would have bought a few bottles of it now."
"Color= Topaz"
"Drinkability: A very easy drinking, yet flavorful, IPA. Russian River knows what they are doing with IPAs. Fighting myself to not drink the entire growler tonight!"
"This is not your typical punch-you-in-the-face IPA, but it is complex and leaves you satisfied in the most sophisticated of ways!"
"mouthfeel and drinkability was about average for an IPA."
"As with all Russian River beers, this one manages to pack in a ton of unique flavor, while still boasting incredible balance and a maximum drinkability. It's so smooth and subtle, that it makes most of its style seem sub-par. I greatly anticipate trying this one on tap."
"An excellent IPA if you can get it, and dare I say it, on par with PtE for flavor."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a large creamy head that leaves nice lacing for each sip. Aroma is west coast styled hpooybwith sweet grapefruit and pine mostly. Taste is sweet stick and medium full bodied. Really smooth and balanced yet hop forward. Mouthfeel is very nice. Carbonation is spot on and has a nice crisp finish. Drinkability is perfect. This is up there withbthebesr American ipas out there."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is an incredibly well-crafted IPA that I would have no problem drinking on a regular basis. Definitely recommended."
"Very gold in color-I would expect a tad darker but thats ok. Nice fluffy white head. Very grassy and hoppy aroma. Big hop blast flavor wise-quite astringent from the heavy hops. Fresh cut grass like. Long lingering bite to it. Good body-the astringency might be a tad much in the long run. Great example of a US IPA for sure."
"It's possible that the 2 months that this beer was sitting on the shelf in Whole Foods has affected it slightly, but I'd still choose a PtE any day :-)"
"MF/D: sizzle of flavor that quickly dissipates into light foamy bubbles as it slides down the throat."
"D: All. Day. Long."
"D - Almost perfect for an IPA. Is this the little 'Bro to PtE? Hats off to Vinnie and the crew, absolutely LOVE this beer."
"d-friggin great. these russian river dudes don't mess around. not as delicate as pte, but still, this is very good."
"Drink this for days. Low(ish) alcohol, great flavor. Would get a 5, if I could get it in DE."
"D - Damn, this is a smooth IPA! The hop bitterness and the clean, dry finish really help this beer in the drinkability department."
"Drinkability - Great flavor, though there is a lingering bitterness that reduces the drinkability somewhat."
"Thanks to bauermj for sending this one my way! 16.9oz bottle into a Hopus tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is aroma is a nice plethora of citrus hops with a bit of caramel malts. The taste is a wonderful balance of citrus hops and sweet malts that gives way to a subtle, but smoothly present citrus hop finish. The beer is very light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is certainly a beer that lives up to my expectations, a wonderful IPA."
"Flavor is a good balance between the slight citrus elements and the biter hops. Very well balanced with the same profile as PtE, but definitely more drinkable. Good beer. Would drink this again."
"Drinkability: Well I'm pounding through this. A nicely unbalanced IPA for when you want a lot of hops and want to drink a few."
"D - Considering RR's Pliny the Elder has become one of my favorite Double IPAs, just seemed to lack the balance I have come to expect from my favorite IPAs and experienced from Pliny the Elder. Not for me. For others that enjoy the large amount of hop taste."
"This was far more bitter than I am used to with blind pig. Either way, this is still one of the top 3 IPAs in the world."
"D - Goes very nicely on warm summer's day in San Diego"
"D - I would drink this everyday if I could. Maybe someday I will live in the right place or they will start a larger distribution!"
"D- A decent IPA albeit a little one dimensional. I feel that this is maybe a little over-hyped."
"This is incredibly drinkable and delicious. As other reviewers have noted, Russian River really can do no wrong. This is great stuff, and I would definitely buy/drink it again"
"Will Russian River ever disappoint? Every beer they make is pure bottled joy."
"This is outstanding. If I could drink this every day I absolutely would. I think about two of these would be perfect."
"Light orange with a hint of amber in color with a very slight haze. Respectable white head that reduced to a white cap. Big floral tropical aromas, papaya, mango and grapefruit. Buttery smooth feel that rides the carbonation. Taste is all hops. Lots of tropical flavors similar to the aromas, tropical and citrusy flavors that overwhelm any malt character. Finishes with a bitter pine hoppy ending. The intense hop flavor took a little edge off of the drinkability."
"The appearance is a light golden brown color. It is transparent in nature and gives the feeling that it may not bring as much to the table as it does. The hops come out early straight to your nose with the first wiff. A nice piney citrus smell with a tropical twist. The taste is what I love most about this brew. That same citrus and pine that hit my nose comes through in flavor. The hops come in right away with this one with that nice citrusy taste upfront and a long finish. Not too overwhelming but enough on the palate to keep me coming back for more. Good feel on the mouth, a bit thin but a great crispness to it. I could see myself drinking this beer everyday, nice and smooth with great hop character and flavor. One of my favorites."
"On tap at the Local 44 served in a pint glass. This brew appears a slightly hazed light orange color with less than a finger of white creamy head. Minimal retension with slight patchy lacing effect. The nose of this brew is both herbal and slightly citrusy. The flavor has both citrus an herbal bitterness as hinted by the aroma. The malt backing is a very clean grainy character that imparts minimal sweetness. A lingering flavor of the grain and hop bitterness is left in the mouth that increasingly gets more herbal as the brew warms. Medium feel with a modest level of carbonation."
"D- Very good hoppy IPA. One of the better IPA's I've tasted. Could easily drink a couple of these in an evening!"
"Pours a nice cloudy orange with a big time head. Great lacing and retention. Big pine aroma, also bits of grapefruit. Flavor follows. Huge bitter pine hops off the bat. A hint of citrus and floral as well, but the pine takes over. A little bready, semi-sweet malt before the bitter pine takes over again on the big finish."
"Big thanks to billinlafayette for including this as an extra! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a clear golden yellow-orange with a two finger off-white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of malt, tropical fruit, and malt. The flavor is of bitter tropical fruit, smooth hop bite, with a big hop bite upon swallowing. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Another one from Russian River that I wish it were available in my area. One of my favorite American IPA's I have had. Very nicely done Russian River..."
"This was my first (and second and third) time having Blind Pig fresh, and it blew away my previous, albeit amazing, experience. If this isn't my favorite IPA, I'm not sure what is."
"Ok, 'nother local up to the plate...Pours a nice clear amber, ok head that winnows itself down to a wisp of carbonation with some fine lace. Nose is loaded with hops and some other items, some sweet pear and maybe some vanilla..Pretty nice and very robust aromas. Flavor is like the nose - very robust and hoppy. This is a very ""Crisp"" tasting IPA. Flavors are forward yet not overpowering. Like biting into a pear flavored apple, if that makes any sense. Beautiful hop character to this. Evolves from one hop bite to another seamlessly. This is really good beer, but VERY hop forward, like many West Coast ales. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Great beer, but at $4.29/pint+9 oz. it's not what you might call inexpensive...worth it though"
"Picked up another bottle of this from a recent trade.  Bottled 3 June 2014.  Clear orange-yellow pour with a foamy two finger head with good retention and great lacing.  The nose is resiny and herbal with hints of pine, grapefruit, tangerine, and orange peel.  The taste is all West Coast with huge piney, resiny hops up front, balanced out nicely with a solid malt backbone.  Hints of bitter orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, and grass.  The mouthfeel is crisp and tingly with incredible balance and a nice bitter, dry finish.  Overall, this was fresher than my first taste, and it definitely made a difference.  A top notch West Coast IPA that I highly recommend!"
"I think craft beers like this are what make me contemplate living on the west coast. Try this if you get the chance, you won't regret it."
"D- real drinkable. Great IPA, I can only imagine how good it is fresh"
"Drinkability - the astringency makes this a difficult beer to drink for me. Refreshing on a hot day, but relegated to those who like their tongues decimated by hops."
"I really like RR. PtE is one of my favorite DIPA's. I thought I was going to like this, but there is nothing to take away from the palate burning pine and bitterness. Not for me."
"Russian River beers are hard to find, even in California. Why is that? Are they inept at distribution or something? These beers should be enjoyed the world over."
"D-Phenomenal, if you can find it, hence the lower rating. This is the most sessionable, great smelling, great tasting IPA I have ever had. In the past 18 months, I have seen this in bottles only once in Salem, OR. Damn shame. Wish it were more readily available."
"Drinkability:I really enjoyed this beer, the malt gives it a mildly sweet palate upon which the brewer was able to paint great hoppy flavor. It's got so much flavor, that while it might be able to be sessionable, I believe it would be a waste to drink it that way."
"D: The one-dimensionality of the hops limits its drinkability somewhat for me. However it's relatively low ABV (6.1%) for a top level IPA does lend itself well to having more than one glass."
"Thought I reviewed this already so this will be brief. Appearance is nearly perfect, a radiant, clear golden copper color with active carbonation supporting an thick off white bubbly head that coats the glass in rings of sticky lacing and has great retention. Aroma is bitter and hoppy, with mild citrus sweetness, but dominated by citrus rind and earthy bitterness. The pale malt backbone provides a sturdy, yet unobtrusive balance to all of the hops. Mouthfeel is also perfect for an IPA, creamy, medium thick, well carbonated and smooth. One of the best examples of an American IPA, loads of bitter hops that are infinitely drinkable."
"I was very excited to try this on tap at Monk's Café in Philly. Pours the standard IPA look, though this one might reside on the lighter side of things (as opposed to the amber side of the IPA spectrum). Hugely aromatic, very fresh grapefruit and vine aromas--hops rule here. Taste is equally dominated by the grapefruit citrus hops, giving it a crisp edge. Very clean and easy drink, smooth in the mouth. Feel is good, though not so much so as to distinguish this from other good IPAs. Great one here."
"M: Little lighter than normal, but good."
"D: Great but it doesn't have too much alcohol to hide."
"d- i would drink this bottle all day every day. just a darn good beer. luckily picked up a case. ill guard it with my life."
"D - Very drinkable. As this one warmed up a bit, the layers of hops became even more pronounced and kept me wanting more. One bottle is surely not enough."
"D: Russian river really know how to brew an IPA an this one is no exception. Blind pig is very drinkable and love the fact that I have access to it on a daily."
"The mouthfeel is creamy smooth and easy drinking. I love the combination of flavors in this beer as well as the delicate bitterness in the finish. Blind Big is just a tasty easy drinking IPA, that if available in my neck o the woods would be on constant rotation in my beer fridge,"
"Holy crap, what a great beer."
"First sip was an explosion of floral hops, starting with pine resin and blossoming into bitter flowers. The resin doesn't linger on the tongue and mellows out at the end. Each sip brings back the same greatness, never building up the resin like some other pale ales that I know of (ahem Stone ahem). The mouthfeel is tied up in the flavor, which again stays below any unpleasantness. Refreshing and great on a warm day."
"O - The Pliny that you want to drink when you want to drink a lot. A great lawnmower beer even if the abv is just slightly higher than most lawnmower beers. I just wish the price were a bit below that of its brother."
"Poured a pumpkin orange with a big off-white head. Nice gobs of lacing left behind. The smell was malty overall (and very light) which is a surprise, being that it is pretty freshly bottled. I do smell some small floral, citrus and pine notes though and they're pretty nice. The taste kept with the nose, I just felt that it was a little to mellow of an IPA. The mouth was a bit thin. Not bad, I'm curious to try it on tap."
"D - This is one drinkable IPA that goes down really well and decently bitter but not overpoweringly so. Nice work on the awesome IPA RR."
"An amazing brew that is just as good and just slightly easier to get the Pliny."
"pours a light gold with a solid head. Nose is all citrus hops, this is definitely high on the hoppy spectrum for a single IPA. Taste is similar, with a very refreshing and dry finish. Not much balance to be had; the malts barely make themselves known through the amazing west-coast hops. Incredibly drinkable, if perhaps not quite as complex as its bigger brother Pliny. Still, this is a world class IPA by an incredible brewery that I wish I could drink on a daily basis!"
"(D)- A great IPA with everything you would/should expect for the style. Crisp and refreshing; a great alternative summer beer to cool you off. Seek this one out if you can. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability: Absolutely wonderful rendition of the style, awesome combo of hops and balanced quite delicately. Overall awesome brew indeed."
"D- very quafable at the abv and loaded with hop flavor. One of my fav american ipas."
"This was a great drinking IPA one I was proud to share with a craft brew newbie I was glad to try this one and wished I had more"
"This is a great American IPA. I tend to favour balance and drinkability and alot of American IPAs just go overboard with hops in my opinion. Blind Pig however manages to bring the hops to the forefront without going overboard."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Pours a cloudy, golden amber with a two-finger white head which dissapates into a frothy coating. Lacing is abundant, lasting and beautiful. Nose is a mild hop aroma with some grassiness and pine and some citrus, especially oranges and grapefuit. Taste is a wonderful hop bitterness, oranges, grapefuit, pineapple, mango. Bitterness never leaves but never completely overcomes some sweetness in the back that holds as well. Mouthfeel is really interesting rough edges on a medium to light brew - great fun. Finish is somewhat dry and bitter but never too much. Drinkability at this reasonable ABV is guaranteed. I want another NOW."
"Overall of a solid IPA with a good hop presence and minimal malt."
"D: Yes, all day."
"Lovely IPA. Actually comes out as the Mini-Me of of Pliny the Elder."
"Drinkability - I would love to have another, but I live on the east coast....oh well. Great beer"
"Hop nirvana. And with the lower ABV it's not unreasonable to a have a few."
"D- Good flavors and not an overwhelming bitterness makes this a good drinking beer. Another good beer from RR. I have yet to be disappointed."
"Drinkability: if I could get my hands on this regularly I would be drinking it all the time. I liked this better than the elder. Yeah, I said it."
"Paired with a dry Jersey jack from Spring Hill farms in Petaluma. Pretty tasty combo."
"D - Highly drinkable, hits the spot, smooth yet unique."
"Overall a very nice easy drinking AIPA. I would buy this on a regular basis if it was easier to come by."
"On tap at Toronado in SF, poured into a pint glass. Small head leaves some sticky, resinous, soapy lacing stuck to the side of the glass. Aroma is straight up pine and grapefruit. Taste follows suit, delicious hop bitterness, like Pliny toned down a notch. Any time Pliny is being used as a reference point, it's a damn good thing. Very easy to drink and totally delicious."
"Drinkability: All damn day! This beer is great and I'm glad I finally got to try one. Great flavors, excellent smell, straightforward approach and a pretty moderate ABV would allow this to drank from dawn to dark, to dawn again."
"D - Great thirst quencher and highly drinkable, especially on a hot day or after physical activity."
"Pretty good IPA, although I prefer the Alpine IPA's I recently tried...would drink again however."
"D- Very easy to drink, almost easier than Pliny because it has less of a malt prescence. Very nice beer, less balanced but nice."
"I can enjoy this beer. It just lacks the depth of Russian River's better hop-centric sensation, Pliny the Elder (and Younger, for that matter, which I was lucky enough to have on tap once). Maybe a third bottle would convince me, or maybe I've just burnt myself out on killer West Coast IPAs during my stay here, but for now, I have to call it a tad overrated."
"D - Extremely drinkable. I could see drinking this all day on a nice hot summer day sitting on the back deck enjoying life."
"Pours with a fluffy white head and slightly hazy amber color. Nice thick lacing envelops big citrus on the nose. Some faint grass/straw notes also on the nose with faint sweetness. Pretty bold hop character up front that fades on the back of the palate. some residual stickiness follows a slight fizzy feel. Excellent IPA that drinks pretty fast, especially when fresh."
"Overall I think this is a very, very good beer. However I've had better IPAs that are distributed locally. Two Hearted comes to mind immediately. But really I think this beer is it's own worst enemy. The smell was just absolutely bombastic. I like to take my time feeling out the aroma of a beer before taking a sip and I think that just set me up for a bit of a let down. Strange but true, at least for me."
"Good price, but I usually will spend it on PTE . . ."
"This is as drinkable as any fine Lager. Lots of flavor but its still refreshing. This is one fine beer that is nicely balanced, almost perfect. I dont know where they get there water and hops at Russian River but this and their PTE are just amazing."
"Good overall IPA."
"Purchased at Whole Foods in Thousands Oaks about 3 weeks in the bottle."
"D: It's too bad this is harder to find fresh than Pliny the Elder. I'll definitely get it again fresh."
"drinkability - prominent hop taste that is flavorful and enjoyable"
"D - highly drinkable, no alcohol present, balance leans towards hops as it should, but not overbearing"
"D: Pretty good for the style."
"D: Tasty, ""only"" 6%.... Quite drinkable."
"F: Pretty bitter still, it seems to just hold strong at a nice bitter taste the whole time, and with that on the finish it dries quite a bit. It leaves a very fresh dry hop taste in the mouth as it dries, like I just steeped fresh hops in it and took a slurp from the hoppy slur. Lots of pine and hop resins on the finish and some citrus. A very tasty beer, brings you all over the hop map, good parts at least. Worthy of the hype, or better than the lack thereof at least. Not quite as good as Pliny though."
"I have had this beer maybe 10 times, 3 bottles, 7 on tap. I have overall preferred this to Pliny the Elder. Generally the beer has a very bright pine and citrus nose, and more of the same on as the taste. It is usually a nice clear orange and very good drinkability. The latest batch seemed a bit harsh on the back of the tongue, a bit of a surprise to the usual smoothness and dryness in the finish. The smell is really the best feature. Beautiful. Although I'm starting to wonder if RR has changed some things in their beers in 2010, or if it's my palate that is changing."
"D: A good beer, but nothing overly impressive or distinctive. I imagine I would drink it if it were more readily available, but, as is, its not worth the effort in obtaining."
"Pours a nice golden/orange color, with a massive head, 2+ cm, even with a gingerly pour. Looks loose and billowy. A cloud of haze descends on the beer, perhaps leaving a little bit of chunky yeast in suspension. Overall, nice looking. Also leaves some very sticky lacing. The smell is that floral, citrus hoppiness. Lemon rinds, grapefruit rinds, some leaves and pollen, resins. Pretty good. The taste starts out with a little citrus bitterness, then follows with a kind of powdery sweetness. There is some malt here! But the hops are definitely winning, comes on like citrus rind, then you start to get the fruitiness, and a bit of pine and resin. Definitely a West Coast IPA, without question. Finshes dry and a bit grassy, but not overly so on either account. A nice beer. My biggest complaint would be the thin body. It is surprisingly thin bodied, not like watery, but there's no real stickiness to it, just a nice kind of denser than water feeling. The carbonation is lively, quite so, but doesn't sting too much. The beer is very good, one that would probably become a staple of my fridge if I were just a few thousand miles closer to the brewery. I found myself coming back to it, over and over, to have a little more. If only I could get it a week old, instead of a month old, though life could be much worse."
"My first Russian River beer. I've been waiting a while for this. Bottle date is 3-1-10. Much thanks to rmjavanut for the great extra! Things start off good. Pours orange with a nice, rocky white head. Eventually reduces down to a cap and leaves some decent lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles and a little bit of sediment on the first pour, lots of it on the 2nd. The smell is excellent, very tropical and hoppy. Hops, citrus, pineapple, mango. Definitely reminds me of Sculpin, maybe even more potent. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose but this is still a very good IPA. There is still some tropical-ness there but it seems to be mainly citrus and grapefruit. The balance of the hops and malts is perfect. A caramel/bread aftertaste starts to show towards the end. The mouthfeel is very good as well, light but creamy, no alcohol taste, great carbonation level, very easy drinking and enjoyable. This is what I expected and maybe a bit more. I have a PtE waiting for me, hopefully I can hold off till tomorrow..."
"D: Very good IPA, but ultimately nothing that stands out for me. Standard west coast style IPA in my opinion"
"Pours a nice amber color, with a nice, big white head. I remember drinking this beer years ago (early '90s) at the old Blind Pig brewery, although details from those days escape me. This one smells strongly of hops...beautiful floral/grassy/citrusy hops. More floral hoppiness on the palate, balanced nicely by the sweet malt presence. Not sure how similar this one is to the original, but it is certainly a worthy legacy."
"Copper-gold pour with a big, rocky, white head. Nice floral, citrus aroma with a great balance of caramel and biscuit malts. Dry, piny, grassy flavor with nice citrus notes and a well balanced biscuit and caramel malt profile. Creamy, medium body with very soft carbonation."
"D- Extremely drinkable. Great lawnmower beer, imo."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer for how hoppy it smelled. It only leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. Great example of this style."
"Overall...go and get it because if you havent had it you are missing out."
"Really drinkable."
"An amazing IPA from Russian River one of my new favorites."
"D- Very drinkable. Again, I have to thank tbadiuk for organizing this trade. He's got some Allagash coming his way."
"D - Tasty, pretty easy drinking IPA. The malt is strong enough to support the hops even though it doesn't really add much to the beer. The hops are really well balanced between piny and citrusy which I enjoy. The bottle I have really isn't as fresh as it ought to be so I will definitely have to re-review this when I have the chance. Based on this one though I would definitely pick this one up again."
"I really enjoyed this one. Hope my Sister will ship more when she gets home."
"Smoother mouthfeel with medium-light carbonation. Drink this one all night."
"D: This is one that I could enjoy quite a few of and I think would be pleasing to a variety of palates (not just beer drinkers)"
"Pours a hazy, golden-orange color, with a nice-sized, sticky white head. Aroma is great. Full of pine, pineapple and grapefruit. The taste is just as the nose would suggest. Great hop flavor in the form of mostly grapefruit and pineapple. There is a pleasant bitterness present. This is a great IPA that would be one of my go to beers if I had access to it."
"Overall it was a fresh, citrus hop dominated, one note IPA. Very good, but unfortunately a bit of a letdown after PtE, my first RR beer."
"Super-drinkable, no question!"
"This is an excellent straight up IPA."
"I enjoy it, overall it's strong in flavor and light in body, kind of like a baby stone ruination ipa I guess."
"Behold, in front of me, certainly one of the finest specimens I've ever come across! A golden hue of liquid jesus with this perfect little bubbles that dance across my palate and cut the fat of the already eaten pork chop. A wee whiff or a slight sniff of this adult beverage (although children are probably allowed a drop in France) gives off an overwhelming hop explosion. If one didn't know what a hop was, they surely would after experiencing the Blind Pig. It's an elegant hop party in my mouth with no one else invited except for their citrus companions. No one gets out of hand."
"D - Could drink this all night, easily. Perfect in the sun on a patio somewhere."
"lots of citrus goodness."
"D: I really wish I had access to this IPA all the time. Would be a regular in the fridge. I can't imagine what this would taste like in fresh draft or days after it is bottled."
"D - Holy crap is this drinkable. I could drink these all night. Another excellent brew by RR."
"Mouth/Drink: Nice light and bitter finish. Low-Medium carbonation. Drinkablity is as good as it gets. I see myself setting up a trade in the future for atleast a 6pack."
"Overall one of the best IPA's I have had, and I have had the pleasure of having it a few times now fresh. it really shines in the balance it has between the sweet hoppy flavor and the bitter finish. Would gladly drink this anytime."
"The Bline Pig pours a hazy pure orange color with a nice sticky head and plenty of lacing on the glass. Very good start with the pour. The aromas are what make this beer. As soon as the top is popped off the air is filled with floral hops and sweet citrus fruits. The characteristics are plenty with lots of pine, fruits, hops, and even some malts. The quaff is hops, then sweet fruits, then a bitter hop finish that keeps the palate craving more. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and fairly light bodied. Drinkability is great. One of the most sessionable IPA's in my opinion. I do not feel that this gets near the hype as it could and remains under the radar as one of the best IPA's out there."
"This is just a simple but classic West Coast IPA. There is a reason why Russian River has a cult following, when it comes to the style, they nail it and put out a style standard. Big hops on the front, smooth throughout, but still citrusy hops dominated like i like. This beer is so well made with the consistency from first sip to the end. I may be biased since i'm from sonoma county, but this beer is the goods."
"Very drinkable beer, quite possibly one of the most drinkable IPAs out there."
"Had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, at their 3rd annual celebration of everything Russian River. Unassuming appearance, yellowish wheat color. Very mild white head. Smell was anything but reserved. Strong grassy hop smell, some slight fruity notes. taste was similar, not much malt body but tremendous hop bitterness. Biting finish. Great beer for the hop head. Excellent West Coast IPA."
"A great IPA and it deserves the accolades it gets."
"If I lived in the distribution area, I would probably make this one a regular drinker. Of course, I haven't tried the Pliny or Sculpin that I got in the trade yet... Still though, this is a very excellent beer, and my first from Russian River. I look forward to more of each!"
"via duffextracold"
"At my first sip I knew I was drinking something special. This is the beer that came before Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger. The hop character is similar, but less bitter, and the malt is a lot smoother than the elder. At 6% you can session the DIPA! Floral, citrus, and piney aromas destroy the nose as you let the bitterness scrape your taste buds clean and cling to your palate. This can step in Elder's place when he's not around."
"Consumed: 2/23/2010"
"This beer is very drinkable! I would most certainly recommend it - and I'd also recommend the brewery, it's an experience to remember!"
"Pliny might get all the attention, but don't forget Blind Pig. It may not be as ""Extreme!"" but it might be just as good when half the hop power is good enough."
"95/100"
"d - Overall I thought this was a very good IPA. I thought it smelled amazing and while the taste may not have lived up to it, it was still very good. Considering the bitter hops taste it is actually pretty easy to drink, and I would definitely try this again."
"Not a super-complex-keeps-you-thinking beer. But an incredibly nice drinking IPA."
"Drinkability: A fine tasting, easy drinking IPA. To be honest I was expecting a bit more with this one, but then again I just enjoyed a PtE so I may have set the bar a little too high. Either way, this is a tasty IPA and one that I would never turn down."
"The beer is well carbonated and has a nice medium mouthfeel. The alcohol is well hidden, the beer is very bitter and the finish is nice and dry. This is an awesome example of a single IPA, very hoppy, no malt, excellent bitterness."
"D-this is a decent IPA the smell is spot on, solid taste and very easy going down."
"Cheers!"
"Medium to light carbonation . Drinkability is medium for me"
"The problem (for me) is that it has such an unpleasant bitterness to it that I couldn't enjoy it. I was quite disappointed, but as I said, I can understand why others enjoy it."
"This beer is elegant in its simlpicity. Hops meeting barley malt, and stealing its girlfriend, but being nice about it. Good beer."
"OVERALL: Everything turned out nicely on this one, except the feel just did it in. The astringency made it difficult to drink and really hurt the overall enjoyment of the beer. Too bad, because all my other senses were definitely pleased with the situation. Won't be picking this one up again."
"The mouthfeel is clearly medium - very manageable for a bold IPA. Finish is slightly bitter/sweet (literally) but still light. Very drinkable - like I said above, if I had access I'd pound a few of these badboys in a sitting."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a solid well formed head,peaks well and begins to pit leaving mountain like striations of foam and lace,this is one of the finest heads on a beer I have seen in years,as the head dissipates this beer tells you instantly its an IPA citrus floral west coast hops hit your nose,well balanced sweet acid and a solid west coast hop finish,man I could drink a ton of these,Fresh and on tap is all I could think of,but as for my bottle it was still an exceptional IPA"
"Drinkability was great. Not a heavy beer and it doesn't have an overly alcoholic punch either. Gets a little more bitter as it warms but still great. Medium bodied and refreshing."
"Light copper color with a good head and decent lacing. It had a pleasant smell of piney hops with some interesting earthy notes in the background. The flavor was very complex for an IPA, and it took me a minute to pick out the toasty malt taste that I think really sets this beer apart. It of course has tons of citrus and pine tastes from American hops, and a pleasant amount of malt sweetness holding the bitterness up, but there is also a very nice amount of toasted malt flavor that seems to seamlessly mingle with all the other tastes. It made me keep coming back for another sip and was a much appreciated addition. Nice dry finish and on the lighter side of a medium bodied brew. Would make a great session IPA and paired quite well with my slightly spicy entrée. If only it was easier to come by."
"D: Drinkability is above average. I find that the finish is somewhat hindering in this department. The first glass was delicious, the second, very good, the third, good, etc. A really drinkable beer should be very palatable and also get better from one glass to the next in my opinion. Also, I prefer this one a little colder than usual to keep the bitterness in check."
"overall an amazing ipa that isnt too strong, maybe a similar style with a little maltiness wwould be nice but i can appreciate this beer all around, i will be buying more tomorrow!"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer and it is easy to have a second one. (In fact I did.) I'll be quite happy to have this beer again in the future. It's a first rate IPA and definitely among the better that I have tried."
"I'll admit some bias when drinking this beer because I know what a reputable brewery it comes from and how much I enjoy everything that Russian River puts out. If the Blind Pig was placed before me in an unmarked mason jar, I would probably tell you the beer was unbalanced and needed some biscuit malt complexity to back up all the grapefruit."
"D- A pretty highly drinkable IPA."
"I could drink a lot of this IPA. Not too high of an ABV and an all around good beer. Just wish I had access to this whenever I wanted it!"
"D - A pleasure to drink. Like most RR beers, it's a big beer full of big flavors but soft and clean at the same time. Just a great great beer."
"Bell's and Russian River are right there for IPA's they are far above anyone else in my eyes though. Another great beer from Vinnie and co at Russian River."
"drinkability: good"
"Pours a fogged gold amber with a creme head. Soapy, hoppy nose. Sharp floral and citrus tones. I got a lot on the flavor. Earth, smoke, citrus, floral, and soapy hops. Real thick earthy character mostly. Feel is low on carbonation and the liquid is fine. Pretty easy to drink and an overall earthy IPA."
"The beer pours a light orange/gold with a white head. The smell is very piney and very pungent. Very resinous. The flavor is similar with a huge resinous hop flavor. The hops also provide some earthiness but not a whole lot of bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and very drinkable. I wish I could drink this more often."
"D: This is one of the best I've ever had in the style, would drink more if given the opportunity. Thanks RR for strutting across to WNY, and giving me a glimpse of that WC mentality."
"Poured with a great light copper hue and a persistent head. Classic IPA on the nose and palate with lots of boldness and concentration. Pretty great but less intense than the Pliny. The hops are aggressive with notes of fresh pine, citrus, and a tannic finish. If you have a choice, get Pliny the Elder, if Pliny is not available, get this!"
"Conclusion: My first RR brew, and even with my immense expectations, I am not dissappointed. This is one of the better American IPAs I've had, and definitely one of the more over-the-top. But not in a bad way. It's just in your face and doesn't apologize for being that way. As it should be."
"D: This is an extremely pleasing beer to drink, and I will continue to return to this one for solace...and as a regular beer to enjoy with friends."
"My first review from my Secret Santa 2009 haul from brentk56. Surprised by the pale golden color. This tells me this is going to be another hop centric beer. A large white head forms and has excellant retention. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Very hoppy aroma with hints of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Nothing from the malt. The flavor is likewise one dimensional. Citrus hops do shine however in this hop display. Fresh citrus and pine flavors. I would of liked some malt to balance this out a little. The body is on the lighter side but has very good carbonation that gives this beer a nice texture. Nice hop flavors but I would like to taste a little malt in my IPAs. If someone is looking for a better American IPA, I would suggest a few Midwestern beers."
"Overall, a really tasty IPA that I'm glad I finally had the change to try. Not quite the top of the style (still occupied by Hop Rod Rye, Celebration, Two-Hearted and probably Furious), but still really delicious."
"D- A beer I will definitely drink again especially for the price."
"D: Another damn highly drinkable beer from Russian River! Well blended, goes down easily, and is certainly sessionable."
"This is a great IPA."
"D- I could have a bunch of these. Great taste with lower abv%. Great beer."
"D - Spectacular brew! Easy to drink IPA with plenty of hops for hopheads and a more moderate alcohol content then IIPAs. While hop flavours are more pronounced with warmth, mouthfeel does suffer a little. My only complaint on this, perhaps the archetypal CLASSIC West Coast IPA."
"Drinkability: Although Pliny is definitely my preference, this was a good beer. There are other IPA's that I'd take over Blind Pig, but it's a well put together beer that has a nice hop character and malt backbone."
"This is a great great IPA."
"D: Holy crap! This really is one of the best in the world. So incredibly drinkable and only around $5 a bottle? I. Need. More."
"D: Great drinking IPA. If this was sold around me I would definitely session with it. Blind Pig lives in the shadow of the Plineys and does not get the full respect it deserves. One of the best representations of the style out there."
"D - Just a great beer; very drinkable for the hop lover. Quite different from PTE, and nearly as good. I will pick this up often and hope to sample on tap again soon."
"Overall this is a nice beer that I would certainly pick up quite often if it were available in my area. Recommended"
"Drinkability- very nice, Russian River always does a splendid job. I am always greatly satisfied with their beers."
"Spec-tac-ular."
"D: Easy to drink IPA. A lower ABV does not make this 'sessionable' but it is easy to enjoy multiple in a sitting."
"J"
"The taste is pretty light and you get no sweet. The start is pretty plain then goes to a light bitter from mid to finish. Light mouthfeel decently drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable, a good stepping stone to enjoying something like Pliny."
"D - This would be my favorite IPA, but I think Masala Mama wins by a hair, otherwise, this is one of the all time great beers"
"As close to a perfect beer as I have found. Great balance between the bountiful hops in the mouth and the smoothness in the finish. The aroma is second to none, where you can pick up on so many different hints of citrus, fruit and hops. Again, for all the flavor you get when drinking, this remains a very drinkable IPA"
"D - the bitterness kind of wears after a bit. a solid IPA but nowhere near its older brother Pliny."
"D: That's a damn fine IPA... I was excited to try this beer (had it at the Uber Tavern in Seattle... the keg had just literally been tapped) after all I've heard, and it didn't let me down at all."
"D - This is a fantastic IPA, superb bitter, yet dry and refreshing qualities outweigh any negatives. There is a potent hop dose utilized and fresher Ipa's there are few. I really consider this one of the country's best examples of an American IPA- hops are not neglected in any way."
"Picked up after recent trip to RR. Bottled on 9/15, drank today so just over a month old. Poured into tulip. Fluffy, white head, good retention and lacing, golden and pretty clear. Smell is strong of citric and pineapple hops, a weird deep spruce smell too (if that makes any sense). Very floral. Taste was good but not as bitter as I expected. Nice balance of citric hops, a piney bitterness on the back of my throat. Slightly dry and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was nice, not too thin or thick. Very smooth. Overall a great beer. I would take a Pliney over this but this is nothing to complain about!"
"Another solid IPA from Russian River. I almost wish I lived in Cali, if not for Pliny and Bling Pig. I haven't even had PtY yet?!?!?! This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'm liking what I'm seeing."
"glassware: pint"
"A damn good beer for sure, but maybe not quite worthy of being in the top tier of IPAs. But I'll certainly never complain if I have one. This is definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall: Beautiful. If someone had given me this beer and told me it was called Beatification, I would reply, ""that makes sense."" For a standard IPA very balanced and refreshing w/just enough bitterness to keep it interesting. There's a reason RR gets the hype. If they never invented PtE, this one might creep up in its place."
"I think I prefer Blind Pig to Pliny, actually, but both are still a bit on the dry/bitter end for me. It's clearly well-made and worth having at least a few times in your life."
"d- wonderful, glad i got a chance to try this, i'd love to try a super fresh bottle, but even this being little older was still delicious, the pig lives up to the hype."
"Very drinkable and balanced. A slight bitter punch in the finish is appropriate. Very good but not my favorite."
"Pours a nice orange-copper color with a good white head. The smell is of powerful hops and a bit of sweet malt. The taste is much the same, with overriding citrus and floral hops with some pine in the background. Mouthfeel is very good with the medium body and moderate carbonatinon, and this is one of the best-drinking IPA's that I've had. Solid work."
"D - Excellent, full flavored, non overpowering IPA. Would have drank this all night if there wasnt 3 other beers i wanted to sample."
"D- I'm not sure if I have had a better tasting IPA. I love all of the breweries that we get in the Midwest but I would probably trade any of them for Russian River. These guys are the Kings of IPAs."
"Very well rounded tasty IPA. The body is very light and just right for the citrus flavors. Very nice hop flavors without being very intense. Really would like to try it fresh my bottle was a few months old."
"D - Very high for an IPA."
"This beer is ridiculously drinkable. I'm having to stop myself from gulping it. The only other IPA I can think of that I gave a 5 for drinkability was Masala Mama, and this may have it beat. The carbonation level is perfect, and it's a very, very smooth drinker. This is an outstanding IPA, and I think I like it better than Pliny."
"Nice creamy white head. Color is a light straw color with plenty of carbonation. Smells strongly of pine and citrus. First taste is a powerful and bursting mouthful of grapefruit. There is a lingering pine flavor which is not too bitter. The strong grapefruit taste fades in later sips, leaving a zesty pine flavor. Malt characteristic is barely noticeable. Finish is mild and not terribly bitter but slightly unpleasant and acidic. Overall, a nice example of an American IPA, if not my favorite."
"Peach, orange, strong pines, a little bit of creamy caramel, nice dry after taste, bitter lemon. Semigraniess as well, its nice to have an ipa with some body to it."
"D- High. I'd down more of this in a second if I had the chance. A solid IPA. A great example of a west coast IPA. If you get a chance to get a fresh one, go for it, highly recommended."
"Worth the hype, RR doesn't disappoint often."
"D - Wow...I thought Pliny went down easy. Still think Pliny is a better beer, but for sitting down for an extended time, this beer is really hard to beat. Aroma, appearance and taste are really close to Pliny, but the lighter alcohol gives this much better longevity in a session. Excellent."
"This is an easy-drinking IPA; many of the style taste of liquid hops, while Blind Pig complements with hops leaving quite the quaffable brew. Easy to see why this is so popular in the areas it is available."
"Drinkability: It's fantastic, for sure, and the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 in any category is me wishing for just a bit more complexity. Fresh out of the bottle, much like Pliny, is the way to go here, simply a fantastic and very drinkable beer. This is a beautiful brew that I would pick up much more often if it weren't always sitting right next to Pliny, and for the same price, no less. But again, a very, very worthy brew that I consider to be among the top 3-4 single IPAs out there."
"To give credit and since this might affect my rating score I will mention that this bottle is old. So take in consideration that my score might be a little more down cause of this."
"Drinkability: I would have another."
"D - Fantastic every day IPA with plenty of hop character and flavor to please most hop heads. Plus it's sessionable at only 6.1%. This might be second to only Sculpin in the realm of straight-up IPAs."
"D- Yes. I would choose this beer anyday. It's more of a session beer than a hop bomb like pliny, however I'm not sure that I could enjoy more than one of these at a time. The aroma and flavor are great."
"Not too much carbonation, nice body that is on the lighter side of medium, this beer is easy to drink. (Especially with it getting closer and closer to 100* here every day.)"
"D: Fantastically smooth and drinkable IPA"
"This is pretty good but I really like my IPAs with a little more spice in the nose and more hops in the flavor, but this is very balanced. The tart bitterness is great and makes you go back for more. You could have a few for sure."
"Overall, this is a good beer. This is a very good beer and I only wish it was easier to get my hands on."
"D - Off the charts, I wish I had this on tap."
"Definitely a delicious IPA"
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Poured a gold color with thin white head that faded pretty quickly and left sparse lacing. Smelled of citrus hops. Tasted like pine hops and malt. Pretty darn smooth. I could easily drink a few more of these..."
"The Blind Pig is an exceptional IPA. Arguably one of, if not THE, best-crafted IPAs in existence."
"Overall this is great beer. I love IPA's and this is a great one."
"Even mouthfeel, medium carbonation. A very tasty and highly drinkable beer. Many thanks to joerodiii for sending this one my way."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a three fingered white head that is leaving a nice sticky lacing behind. Nose is wonderful, full of floral hops. Taste is light on the bready malts and heavy on peach, citrus, and pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Overall drinability is near perfect. This is a great example of the IPA style with hops heavy and the malts running lightly in the background."
"Ooh but this is yummy! Sweet citrus subsides to bitterness and peach. I like a little more malt in there, but it probably wouldn't go down so smooth. Finish is somehow both full of hop oils and very dry, which, along with the light-medium body, helps this be an incredibly drinkable IPA. The bitter finish may be true for the style, but I prefer IPAs that match it with some more malt sweetness (Stone) or diacetyl (Maui). All in all, though, this is a great American IPA. Hats off yet again to the brewers at RR."
"Drinkability - Very high! I thoroughly enjoy this beer (thought I give a slight edge to Pliny the Elder). Overall, an amazing drink and it is hard to stop at one."
"Mouthfeel: hop bitterness and flavor lingers throughout."
"Straight-forward, clean, to the point, and powerful without being overwhelming - this is a high quality American IPA."
"I can't get enough of this beer! It gets better and better as I sip it."
"d: Great IPA to toast some good news with!"
"O- This is am amazing IPA, maybe my personal favorite. It has all the right hop notes with out overpowering anything. Just the right amount of malt backbone. Perfect."
"D: Surprisingly the beer goes down real quick for as bitter as it is. I think part of the reason may be that it has such a dry finish that it makes you want to take another sip."
"A great regular ipa. one of the best for sure."
"D: Yes, please."
"A modern classic, and for good reason. An exellent beer, to say the least."
"d - highly drinkable. delicious."
"It's a joy to drink and I only wish I had ready access to this benchmark American IPA so I could drink more."
"It had a pleasently bitter bite to it, both up front and aftertaste. There was the usual citrusy notes of the style, most notably tart lemon. It finished very dry but smooth and is definetly a beer I want more than one of."
"Drinkability: Well, there's no question, it's certainly one for the hop fiends. About as reasonably easy to drink as a cuttingly bitter India Pale Ale can hope to be."
"D: There was talk for a little while of abandoning all other plans and sessioning Blind Pig for hours. To the BAs out west I am jealous. This is an amazing beer."
"D: It's a well crafted IPA."
"Bottle is dated 3/26/09, so just around 3 months old at this point. Pours a light honey-golden, almost like a macro. Nice puffy head, retains exceptionally well. Nice and sticky for some cool lacing patterns. Smells of subdued hops, nice standard IPA smell. Taste... very clean piney hops. Nice and on the dryer side, like I like. A bit of earthiness from the hops, also. Citrus takes a back door, comes in more on the back palate, along with a mapley slight sweetness. Pretty much comes in on the back of the roof of the mouth. Most excellent. Great mouthfeel and carbonation, nice drinkability also. Can't wait to try Pliney!"
"Picked one of these up the last time I was in San Francisco. Pours a dark yellow color with a nice tall head that has decent retention and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of US hops that have a citrus and pine character. The flavor is quite bitter and full of that characteristic US hop with citrus and pine. The hops hang around on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is pretty good. Nice beer."
"Overall, I think this is a staple for an ipa. Drinkable and I could easily have more. Some IPAs I can drink more of and this is one of them. Good beer and a great price."
"D: It's too bad that this is the same price as Pliny, because it would be a top rate IPA if it was made by a different brewery."
"Good drinkability albeit a little high on the abv scale for a session beer. Could have more than one in a night but for some reason the carbonation in this brew makes me burp a lot more than I'm use to..."
"straw yellow with a thick head that leaves a thick trail of bubbles down the side. the nose on this beer is outstanding. Smells of grapefruit, very citrusy, some malt in the background, maybe some bready notes too. Taste is rather perfumey. very floral, quite bitter towards the end to balance it out a bit. strong residual bitterness on the tongue. some grapefruit in the taste as well. mouthfeel is nicely carbonated to help wisk away some of the floralness. beer is rather sticky in the finish which coats the tongue in bitterness. drinkability is relatively high."
"D - So easy to drink...I want more!"
"This is an awesome IPA, easy to drink clean, refreshing on a hop day."
"D: All day drinkability. Perfectly simple, clean and refreshing."
"Got this in a half-liter bottle from the Bier Stein in Eugene. It always takes a back seat to Pliny, but this is one nice IPA. Pours out with a nice white bubbly head, and is crisp and clear golden-orange in color. Smells fantastic, with lots of floral aroma. The taste is also very floral and I get a hint of orange. No taste or hint of alcohol anywhere in the taste...seems as though more of the complexity in the taste comes out when it's colder and it loses it's complexity as it gets warmer. Otherwise very drinkable and nice for a hot day."
"500ml bottle. Bottled on 3/26/09. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a pale gold with two fingers of white head. Citrus hop aroma. Light to medium bodied with medium amount of carbonation. Crisp hop bitterness up front. Dry hoppy finish with a good amount of mouth pucker. Very easy drinking beer."
"Reccomended. A great IPA."
"one last thank you to max and vinnie for making this happen!"
"Taste is pretty great - I feel like Pliny is more distinctive beer, but this is pretty great. It's got everything, really reminds me of a mix between racer 5 and drier, British ipas, really classic and it's all there, the hop finish is the best part"
"Medium bodied with mild carbonation, smooth and easy to drink."
"golden orange, slight haze, nice creamy white head and lacing. floral hop aromas mostly in the nose with some citrus, grassy, and tropical fruit notes as well. lightly sweet biscuity malts are dominated by a lemony hop bitterness that is neither harsh nor smooth. well carbonated leading to a frothy mouthfeel. almost light bodied. hoppy, bitter, drying finish comes out clean. could drink a lot of these. Enjoyed this even more than pliny the elder and wish it were available in my area."
"If RR aimed to make a light, easy-drinking beer worthy of IPA status, they've accomplished their objective. Having never had one, I had braced myself for a big ol' West Coast hophead-type of beer. Mind you--this IS that type, but it's like a little ol' hophead beer. It's actually kinda cute."
"An IPA with the complexity of a DIPA but without the hostile takeover from hops, excellent IPA"
"The strong citrus/lime character with intense hops found in the bottle was not found this time on tap. Good IPA to start a tasting; over powered, however, by others you may taste at same time."
"Appearance is perfect, no really it is. Huge head that won't go away. Tons of lacing that spiderwebs on the side of the glass. Nice pale copper look to it. Smell is very good as well. Uncharacteristicly large fruit blast up front for a West Coaster- grapefruit sinks in before the hops even grab hold. You can pick up the individual levels hops however and it is amazing. Taste is a bit weaker than the smell let on, which was a mild disappointment. But lets be honest, its still in my 7 or 8 IPAs. Nice sweet malt as well, another pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is almost perfect, a touch more hop juice for oily effect would have done it. Drinkability is amazingly smoothe."
"D: this beer is bonkers great. Drinks like no other IPA I have had and is loaded with flavors...delightfully delicious!"
"Bottle dated 020209, got as an extra, thanks! I was afraid since I have had fresher BP that this would pale in comparison, it kinda did. The hops weren't as lively and the citrus, although bright, wasn't quite what I remember it to be. This was still a great drink, the color was fantastic, aromas were very good lots of grapefruit. I'd be drinking this fresh if it were more available."
"Overall - Review from notes (April 2009) served at Monk's Cafe. A decent representative of an American IPA. Honestly, I'm not sure this would do it for me all the time but to be fair, it is undoubtedly a good beer. Russian River never fails."
"Not an extreme IPA - certainly not packed with bitterness on the palate. My guess is the hop quota in this brew is used up late, imparting massive fruit aromas, but little bitterness. This leaves it extremely drinkable - very smooth and refreshing. An excellent and tasty little IPA."
"Nice smooth texture despite a tingly carbonation. This was one of the best balanced IPAs that I have tried yet!"
"Not as good as the Pliny but a very good ipa. Surprisingly drinkable and not too high in alcohol. Finishes very dry and the hop flavor i pronounced without being overwhelming. Not as aromatic as the doubles but a very easy to drink beer and very sessionable. Comes in a 1/2 liter bottle; great size."
"D- I had two in a row and probably could've had another, but sometimes the bitterness just gets to be too much"
"Really glad I found a fresher bottle of this one, it was good at 6 months old, but GREAT in its fresher state. Easily one of the best IPAs I've gotten my hands on thus far."
"The color is a slightly hazy orange, the head was minimal in this pour. The aroma was that of a fresh orange with some slight sweet malt peaking through. The flavor was a little malt sweetness with some floral and citrus hops but not as strong orange as the aroma. A very well balanced IPA."
"RR can do no wrong in my eyes, i'm glad i live in SEPA!!"
"A really good IPA, I'm glad I had the chance to try this one."
"Flavor packs a larger hop profile than the aroma lets on, and gladly so, although the bitterness could stand to be a bit more in check at times. Raw, leafy hop cones cross the palate with some citrus & spice before a solid, caramel malt sweetness balances it all out. A slightly stale biscuit note mingles with some wood on the finish, possibly a side effect of the 3 month old bottle's ""age"". Still, the mouthfeel is one of the highlights. Russian River knows how to craft an IPA that finishes effortlessly clean and crisp, with just a hint of lingering bitterness. The medium-thin body is very refreshing and drinkable because of that. Overall, I found Blind Pig to be a good IPA, perhaps a bit overrated, but still very tasty."
"I want more."
"What a nice surpise to see two Russian River brews last night at our Charlotte Oktoberfest meeting. Pliny the Elder was the one I had my eyes on the whole time, but let me tell you . . . this one is just as good, if not even more drinkable. Nice piney hops that we just don't get on the east coast as much. Lots of flavor all the way, a must try."
"D- ugh, i with this one was on our shelves. its an excellent example of the west coast style IPA and something i could see myself bringing a cooler full of to a BBQ or somethign this summer. easy to finish the bottle, and i would have liked another one. check this one out if you get the chance."
"Taste is exactly how the aroma led me to believe it would be, a strong bitter piney taste with some citrus but not enough to balance things out a bit."
"Great job RR!!"
"D--This is as drinkable as any IPA I have ever had. This has made me want to get another Pliny VERY SOON try it again because I had to have missed something if Russian River can make and IPA like this. Bravo, possibly (probably) my favorite single IPA."
"Drinkability - I think this one stands right up to pliny the elder, and in some ways is the equal if not better of the two. Vinnie doesn't expect anything but perfection from his beers, and this one doesn't fall short of those expectations."
"The appearence is a light cloudy orange with a slight white head receding into a thin halo around the edge. Foamy white lacing sticks to the edges. The nose is a mix of fruity and piney hops blended in nicely with a slight touch of maltiness. The taste is big citrus hops and bitter pine hops. This is far more bitter than i remember it being, almost to a chewy respect with the hops. Mouthfeel is overall pretty carbonated and oily from the hops. Drinkability is very high. I think I could down a couple more glasses of this."
"D- This is a damn good IPA and I hope that maybe one day RR will be in Indiana. Not going to ever happen I don't think making this beer one that I will have to keep trading for."
"Overall, the sweetness in the taste is so damn good! I think that I found an IPA that I can sink my pallet into. Send me more ASAP!!!"
"Hmmmm, unfortunately I am taking my first try of this well regarded brew from a bottle a little old for my taste. Pours a pure golden color, with a little bit of cloudy bits settling. The head is a nice two finger, overwhelming size, solid white. Nice lacing left after a few sips, this is a well built beer. Aroma has faded a bit, bit I pick up the piney, grassy hop aroma. The taste follows that piney/grassy hop profile, and has luckily held up well. Unfortunately, I there is not enough malt to balance it out, and if I am going to be overwhelmed by hops, I prefer the citrusy route. Very dry in your mouth, crisp, as well. A little less dry, and maybe earthy, and this would be a bit smoother drinking. Obviously a well built beer, but I prefer a different route on my IPA hop selection. Still, I would like to give it another whirl, with a little more fresh bottle."
"The mouthfeel is bone dry, crisp, and leaves my mouth sticky."
"Overall, this is a great example of a hoppy American IPA. Refreshing, not overpowering or overly bitter, and absolutely delicious. My only complaint would be in the slightly thin/watery mouthfeel and I feel like a bit more carbonation might make it even more quaffable."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and yet slightly wet. A little more watered down than I wanted. Flavor is big time bitter up front, and finishes spicy. This beer is absent of a decent sweet malty balance. This finishes a little harsh and acrid. This could be a little more balanced, but still a great IPA. Glad I had the chance to try it. Thanks, Tzanio."
"my second pour is more drinkable with the slight extra yeast taste to smooth it out"
"d-absolutely fantastic could drink this stuff all night if more available..."
"Presents a big foam on the pour, a good deal of very large bubbles, settles down to the surface quickly leaving a thick, sticky lacing behind. Medium orange to autumnal yellow in color, more transparent at the rims, good brightness throughout. There's a toasty crispness to the nose, the white and pink grapefruit accents penetrate but not violently, retains some honeyed bread crust and cereal aspects, light guava, pineapple, nectarine fruit scents, the malty smoothness is sneaky and mostly before it all dissolves, mainly milk chocolate powder. Medium-bodied, a touch lighter than expected given the expressiveness of the nose, the carbonation more broad than fine, lifts things like an air balloon rather than hang glider. The grapefruit, tangerine, lemon citrus sweeter here and, by the same token, the malts more present and soothing. More grass and grain than bread or cereal, a measured rawness to it. A breeze of spring flowers comes through at the end. Admirable alternation between balanced integration and letting the dog off the leash in the park."
"Actually, a tad thinner than some of my other favorite IPAs. With that said, I would drink this at every opportunity. Fantastic beer, even though I'd probably take a Pliny over it."
"D. Very drinkable. Very good IPA."
"Draught at the brewery. Gold with a white head. Huge hoppy aroma of pine and grapefruit. Dry, lightly toasted pale malt with lots of bitter, piney hop flavor. A little lighter bodied and dryer than RRIPA, with a very dry and clean finish and lingering bitterness. A pretty big hop charge, but the profile isn't quite as interesting as RRIPA. Love the dry, clean malt profile though"
"My first ever Russian River beer..here goes. Slightly murky orange/brown beer..great off white frothy creamy heid. Nice fresh aromas of piney/spruce like hops..some lemon and honey in the back. Good juicy hops, freshly squeezed or so it feels. Fresh grassy, grapefruit, brown sugar, toasted. Really nice and fresh..you should have this for breakfast! Great palate too..very well done. Overall a great IPA"
"D: Easy drinker, I could throw this beer back in a session easily. A little on the strong side abv wise, but still a great tasting IPA. Highly recommended. Excellent beer."
"Drinkability- I could really put this beer away all day. I like a bigger IPA (a.k.a. Pliny the Elder) but I could drink more of this in comparison due to the lighter body and low alcohol content. Great IPA"
"D: This beer has an amazing flavor, great mouth-feel, and a great smell. This beer has move into my top 3 favorite beers. Highly recommended!"
"Palate is pleasantly sharp with hops up front, centennial is my guess, and leads into waves of tangy grapefruit and a light honeyed malt in the distant background. Very citrusy, grassy, and drinkable."
"Drinkability - Too easy. Great west coast example of an APA. Russian River just keeps pumping out great beer after great beer. Blind Pig should be consumed by the masses in large quantities."
"D: Drinkability is damn good. Light - ish, refreshing, not sticky or cloying. Could drink this for awhile."
"500ml Bottle thanks to CaryTheDude. A dull golden color body with a big soapy white head,light to medium carbonation and tuns of stricky lace. Aroma is hoppy, piny,floral and citrus rind,Very nice. Flavor is bitter with some pine up front, a very tasty caramel malt backbone,more citrus hops,a bit of resin,hints of peppercorn,orange peel,just plain juice and balanced,very very good, a nice bitter finish with a hoppy aftertaste, medium body without being sticky feeling at all. A very drinkable top shelf IPA for sure."
"500mL bottle received in trade from desaparecido(thanks Edgar!) Poured into pint glass. Pours a deep golden straw color with an inch of soapy white head. Smell is citrus hops. Taste is citrus and pine upfront and biscuitlike maltiness in the end. Super dry mouthfeel drier than any IPA I've ever had. Great drinkability. My first beer from Russian River and I'm very impressed."
"D- Excellent drinkability. So smooth, not to powerful on the bitterness, not highly carbonated."
"All around a very good IPA, with nothing out of place or over the top."
"D=very drinkable, just a plain good beer."
"Beer is straw colored and a bit hazy. Great lacing all the way down the glass. Ample carbonation fizzes its way to the 2 finger head which dies quickly. Nose is pure floral hops, it's pungeant and smells great. Taste is citrus upfront, with some lemon, and a bit bitter but the bitterness is never too powerful as the malts balance this puppy out nicely. Easy to drink and the right level of carbonation for the style. A great IPA."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is definitely one of the very best IPA's that I've had. It's the type of beer that is worth drinking a lot of for a whole evening."
"D: If this were available, total summer session beer. Low ABV with a delicious hoppy presence."
"Just as on their fantastic Pliny the Elder, the bottle warns against aging this beer. Right..."
"Drinkability- This ain't the hoppiest beer in the world, but any hop-head should enjoy it. Quite frainkly, it should have a little more maltiness and malt sweetness, but this stuff ain't bad."
"Honestly I think this beer is over rated. Too many hop heads have inflated the rating of this beer. If you're one of those, this beer is for you. If you respect and cherish balance, you may not be impressed. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth trying."
"Pliny the Elder's little brother, straw colored body under effervescent two-finger head with lingering lacing. Hops and pine dominate the nose, a bit less malty than PtE. Pine, grass and grapefruit on the tastebuds, with a really nice lingering astringent hoppy finish. The thing I am most struck about is how divine this is on tap compared to its bottled brethren, even when the bottle is relatively fresh-I saw RR products at John's Marketplace that had been bottled within the last 10 days. I did a comparison later with the bottle version, and the keg won hands down. The best comparator I can think of is Bridgeport's IPA, which is high praise. An exemplar of the style, and given its relative lack of availability back east, part of the Holy Grail for BAs."
"Thick white head dissipated slowly into tight lacing. Beer itself was a honey/orange color. Very strong citrus aroma of pineapple and tangerines. Great pine flavor that was not as pronounced in the smell. Slightly astringent but not harsh and very refreshing. Looking forward to the next one!"
"Mouthfeel is on the light side, but the carbonation is great. Blind Pig is a very well-crafted IPA. It doesn't get much better than this. It's like a better version of Two Hearted, which is still a very good beer. Couldn't be more drinkable if it tried."
"Bottle into goblet. Pours orange/golden, huge fluffy white head, retention, clear, active, some lacing. SMELL is grapefruity hops up front, a prominent sweet malty influence balances the pungent hops. Very nice. TASTE is sharp piny and citrusy hop flavors backed and blending with caramel malty sweetness. They struggle for dominance and compliment each other, but in the end the hoppy bitterness takes over and lingers. FEEL mild fiz and tingle, pleasantly rich and full texture. Some warming and drying in the sharp bitter finish that lingers. OVERALL has an aggressive hoppy attitude and bold attributes that make it seem like an imperial/double amped up something or other, but is fairly mellow in abv. Often balanced it drops its pretentions and packs a solid west coast IPA punch."
"Overall: Fairly drinkable, good strong hop flavor, balanced with a sweet malt, refreshing beer."
"Overall, this is an okay IPA, but I am wondering if the high ratings stem more from it being brewed by Russian River than the actual flavor of the beer itself."
"Thanks For Reading"
"On-tap at Ortino's Northside. $5 for a 10 oz pour. Appeared a clear gold with a thick white head. The aroma is an intoxicating mix of pineapple, grapefruit, floral perfume and pine - amazing. I only wish the flavor could match that amazing smell. Yeah, it's pretty awesome, with a more herbal grapefruit taste and hint of biscuity malts, but the aroma is just top notch. The bitterness level is also pretty spot on. This is damn good IPA."
"This poured a slightly hazy light copper with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops, with pineapple and honey. It tasted surprisingly mellow, like orange and grapefruit, with some honey and a bit of cream and rose. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was super clean and tasty, with a fresh hops flavor reminiscent of HopSlam. Not overly bitter, and great body, so it was pretty easy to drink. There wasn't much complexity to it, but I think that's ok for an IPA. Just straightforward and delicious hops. This wasn't quite my absolute favorite IPA, but I can't really find a flaw with it. Well done."
"D: Highly desirable to consume, but the odd texture (from relatively thinness of the body combined with the low carbonation) and the bitterness winning out on the balance war, makes me knock it down a point or so, even though the flavor and especially scent are good."
"Part of a recent beer haul from Colorado. Supposedly some version of this is claimed to be the first ""West Coast IPA"" so I feel like I'm drinking a little part of history here. Nice and clear amber, good healthy long-lasting head and lacing. Lots of pine and floral hops in the nose. Grainy but light malts take a backseat, but do a decent job at supporting the main flavors of this beer. This is a really nice tasting ale for sure, but I think the best thing about it is that it's so damn drinkable and so flavorful with out being a double IPA and with out being too high in ABV. If I had more I would drink it right now. Russian River knows how to do an IPA. Sho nuff."
"D: An IPA that is quite smooth and tasty, yet the bitterness might be an obstacle to some."
"Recommended..."
"This is one of the best IPA's I've tasted. It doesn't have the same bite as some of this style, but to be honest, there are times when I'm not looking for the zing of hopbomb - for such occasions, this is an excellent brew. Smooth texture with great mouthfeel, I wish this one were readily available here as it is about as easy to drink as it gets."
"Thanks flexabull. I'm jealous that you get to drink this all the time."
"Impressed! Loving the IPA's from Russian River Brewing Co. Wish more like it would bottle and distribute in the Portland, OR area at a great price!"
"Overall a very good IPA nice balance and good verity of hop character."
"D: Went down just fine. Is a nice all-around IPA."
"very good beer, enjoyed it a lot ."
"Another winner from Russian River."
"Drinkability: a wonderful IPA that could be consumed all night long. Can't get a better representation of the west coast style IPA than this one."
"Mouthfeel is plenty full, perhaps a bit on the thin side, a problem easily overlooked when their Pliny offerings are there for that. A mouthcoating resin chewy feeling afterwards. Thanks Russian River, you're doing the population of Oregon a favor by distributing here, making our local breweries sweat to keep up!"
"Overall: Blind Pig is like a very dependable friend. At 6.0% ABV, I could drink this beer all week. It's sturdy, very well-balanced, and extremely drinkable. It's not the best IPA on the block by any stretch of the imagination, but it's ten times more balanced than many of the IPAs I've had. In the end, this is a very successful IPA that I will definitely pick up the next time I'm in Colorado or California. Have I said before that there should be a movement to get Russian River beers to more states? Well there should..."
"Definitely worth a shot but I wish I'd brought back two Pliny the Elders instead of one of each."
"Nearly three fingers of off white head turns rocky and leaves considerable lace as it slowly fades. This nose is very fragrant with oily citrus and even noticeable mellon with a backround spike of pickled pine. Body is a hazy orange amber wheat gold thing going on. On first sip I find this considerably thinner than I was expecting. Hops play more of a backround role on the initial flavor profile. Hop profile is of citrus rind and rustic soft pine. Bitter feel does develop more as you drink but it is more of a mouthfeel as each additional sip douses the bitter. Mouthfeel is only a soft bitter hue. This beer is nicely drinkable, it just lacks some of the attributes of other great IPA's."
"It's funny that if you were to make beer, this taste could be the result of messing up your bittering hops by adding too many or letting the boil run long, but if you do it on purpose people love it."
"A good IPA but certainly not the best IPA. it is drinkable but I was expecting a lot more from both this and Pliny the elder, which I had last night."
"Great brew, but Id like to try it fresh. These RR bottles have such serious disclamers about how much better this beer is when fresh, id like to try as soon as possible."
"Given the right circumstances, this could be a good old standby sort of thing. A beer that's not so bitter as to turn off less IPA favorable friends. Should mix good with grilled foods and BBQ'd meats. But, I have to say that it's not that hop monster you might be looking for either. That's okay by me, but it depends on what you might be looking for in a brew."
"D: A pretty drinkable IPA but it is a bit too raw for my taste."
"Pours clear peach yellow color with big white head. Tons of lacing. Smell - very bright grapefruit, hint of pine, hops. Very pleasant smell, however I think it is pretty regular IPA aromas, nothing different. Taste - sweet grapefruit followed immediately with hoppy bitterness, bitter semi-dry finish. This is very clean IPA with no foreign flavours. I guess, this is what IPA is meant to be. Very smooth and creamy, very well balanced. This beer is extremely drinkable for IPA. Even it is 3 months old it seems to be pretty fresh to me. Very, very good beer."
"M/D: Velvety mouthfeel, carbonation is low, light to medium bodied. Very, very drinkable. Very balanced IPA, nothing too heavy, nothing too light. This is about as good as it gets in every way in terms of an AIPA. You aren't going to find many, if any, AIPAs done better than this. Superb."
"Overall, a more session-freindly version of Pliny the Elder, although the taste is does not do as much for me. Still very drinkable, but I may be spoiled from excessive Pliny exposure."
"Great drinking beer. I could see even non hop heads drinking this beer in the summer months. Great beer!"
"Drinkability- A beautiful robust bodied IPA, big hop presence which diminishes drinkability."
"D: This IPA contains flavors, aromas and mouthfeel that I would expect from a DIPA--in fact, it's like a milder/slightly maltier version of Pliny the Elder. I would recommend this beer in a heartbeat. I can't wait to buy a few more bottles!"
"D: It's a little bitter in the finish"
"D: Very drinkable IPA. I love everything that Russian River Brewing is doing & love turning new people on to their great brews! If you haven't gotten the chance to experience them you are missing out."
"Blind Pig is a true joy to behold and a testament to freshly brewed, freshly hopped beer."
"D/O: Overall the balance is what makes this IPA a standout in the category. Neither the malt bill nor hop profile are overly complex or layered, but both are blended together superbly to create a beer that is tasty, very hoppy, and extremely drinkable. With its reputation it's tough not to compare it against other HTF DIPAs, but this one does just about everything right for an IPA."
"This was for the most part a slightly above average IPA. There's not much to distinguish between them. I bet a blind pig wouldn't be able to tell them apart."
"Well, I do like this but there are a lot of other IPAs that I would reach for first. Still, I'm super glad I finally got to try this one.."
"This IPA has a fantastic drinkability. With a 6% ABV I could easily drink and enjoy this fantastically well made IPA all day long."
"Overall this is a very, very good IPA - an important distinction, as it's certainly not a DIPA. Everything hits just right. I wasn't disappointed, and you won't be either."
"Poured a deep orange with good carbonation and nice white head. Nose is pine, grapefruit and orange peel. Taste is citrus, piney,toasted and caramel malts and a hop bite on the end. Mouthfeel is noce and chewy with the hop bite and some citrus notes. Drinability is good. I can get a sixer of Union Jack for the price of two Blind Pigs. A good IPA but not one I would seek out again."
"Very easy drinker. I'm glad they bottle it. Gives me hope to get it shipped to Madison!"
"This is a nice IPA. It's got more hop bite than I expected, but then it doesn't back it up with a whole lot. The first taste is great, but it's also the peak. The beer sort of fizzles after. Still, it's pretty damn tasty."
"One of my favorites IPAs. Smells and taste great. Glad I have the ability to easily get it on tap or in bottles."
"drinkability: the perfect hoppy session beer"
"Infinitely drinkable, I wish this was available on tap in Wisconsin, instead I know exactly what I'll drink whenever I visit California. Despite Blind Pig's weak malt presence, I'm judging it according to the West Coast style of American IPA, in which case, this a flawless IPA. Some may like a maltier IPA (I know I do sometimes), but you'd be hard pressed to find its equal, let alone a superior IPA. Highly recommended, a must."
"Drinkability: Endlessly drinkable for retaining such strong hop flavor."
"Since the body is light and the beer is of a lower percentage I would call this one of the best session brews you could find (perhaps a little heavy in alcohol to be deemed a ""true"" session beer but for me it doesn't get much better) I could drink this all day."
"Yet another beer that makes me sad that I live so far from all these west coast classics."
"Note to self: Ranked #84/100 Top Beers on Planet Earth, #7 American IPA when I tried it"
"Pours golden amber with just a little bit of haze. Thick and sticky pure white head. Aroma is full of clean citrus. Grapefruit and bubble gum. The flavor comes off as pine right down to the prickly bitter finish. Medium body, but drinks fairly light. Long bitter finish. I can surely see why the west coast guy sing Blind Pig's praises."
"Notes: This is a very bold IPA. Bitter overall with a dry finish, and a long hoppy aftertaste that aims to please. I've had DIPA's that boast as much raw hop power as this one. Nothing out of this world, but a very good beer that I really enjoyed. Highly recommended"
"I call them as I see them and sorry to say, I don't think this one deserves all the praise people heap onto it."
"Drinkability is high because of the low ABV and because it is a good IPA all together. I still prefer stone IPA for a single IPA style but Elder has to be my fav DIPA."
"Pours a clear golden amber with 2 fingers of eggshell colored head, good retention and excellent lacing. Smells abundant of citrus, honey, grain, and pine. Taste begins with a touch of floral hops and pineapple and other citrus fruits up front followed by a nice caramel and grainy malt backbone with a puckering of pine resin, earth, grass, and a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Smooth and clean with a firm bitter earthy bite but still quite balanced. Easy to drink and very flavorful, great stuff."
"7/3/7/4/16/3.7"
"D- May I have another...I wish this was more accessible in my area."
"Btw, I could have not picked a better brewery for my 200th review. Surpassing a milestone with this beer was more than I expected."
"D- Flavor stays delicious throughout the life of the larger 500mL bottle, and the alcohol is very doable at 6.1%. Certainly worth picking up if you see it."
"D - A solid IPA. I wish I'd gotten a fresher sample - but beggars can't be choosers. Even at a few months old, this beer's hops pack a decent punch. I'm definitely left wanting another."
"Overall this is a well-crafted beer from the best brewery I've had the good fortune to visit. I'd like to try Blind Pig again within a couple of months of the bottling date."
"This is probably better right out of the tap. My bottle was a few months old."
"Hazy light orange body. Bubbly ivory white head. Lace is abundant and web like. Aroma is outstanding. Everything that is good about hops with a little backdrop of sweet malt. It's fresh, grassy, piney, abundantly citrusy and fruity with pineapple and grapefruit nuances. Exquisite nose. The body of this beer is light and thin. Carbonation quite low. Bitterness quite high. The bitterness is actually pretty scathing for an IPA. Jagged and rough. Hop flavors are more in the background, with some lemon rind and grassiness coming to mind. Malt load could use a little boost to add a little more balance, a little more body and a little more flavor. This is decent. Although Smelling the beer was the climax of this experience. If/when I order more Russian River, I'll definitely be hitting up the Elder (and the Younger hopefully) before hitting this up again."
"Had this about an hour after getting home from the gym, and it was a great beer the relax with. perfect beer."
"Drinkability; I've said it before I'll say it again, RR COME TO PA!"
"This beer pours a very clear amber with a 1 fingered white head and lots of lacing. The smell is big of citrus hops, grapefruit to be exact. The tast is very smooth and has a nice blance of hops and malt, lots of citrus flavors. A nice mouthfeel with a good carbonation level. A decntly drinkable beer, I will search it out again."
"A close second to Pliny."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a huge fluffy white head that sticks to everything. Smells of caramel, biscuit, citrus, kind of sweet and malty with a bit of catty, citrusy hops thrown in. Tastes about like the aroma, lots of sweet caramel malts and lots of pine and citrus hop bite. Amazingly balanced brew! Mouthfeel is sticky and resinous, carbonation is crisp, body is medium. Great Ipa I wish I could get this more easily. Great balance great aroma."
"From a 0.5L bottle purchased locally poured into an imperial pint glass. Resiny hops fill the nose with citrus and pine. A golden color with a small white head. Flavor is forward with the hops followed by smooth malt. Crisp lingering bitterness. Carbonation is low and the finish is dry making this beer very drinkable. I could drink this all day long."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"The taste mirrors the smell. Citrus hops coat the mouth and leave a slightly oily, drying aftertaste. Nice malt backbone, well balanced but thoroughly hopped. This beer is a great example of what I like in an IPA."
"Not being a IPA drinker, this was a nice mellow IPA. When poured, the color was a slightly hazy medium golden yellow with a orange hue. The smell of piney aroma filled the nose. The taste of priney resins and citrus, like grapefruit, orange and a hint of lime hit the taste buds. This IPA is one of the better ales that doesn't have that heavy bitterness or super tart feel in the mouth or on the palate. Just a nice pleasant, rich taste. Another great beer from Russian River Brewing!"
"A+"
"Nt quite in the same category as Pliny, but very easy to drink and enjoy."
"D: This brew is highly drinkable and very nice. It is incredibly well balanced and damned tasty. Its not the most mind blowing IPA, but the balance is the incredible part of the brew. This really is an easily chuggable IPA. Nice for sure. She may not be the chick at the bar with largest rack, but she has curves in all the right places and, best of all, she was an easy close."
"Cheers!"
"RR can do no wrong in my eyes, i'm glad i live in SEPA!!"
"I got this growler at Big Z's beverage in Huntington, LI. Who has recently won best distributor on Long Island. I got an email from mark who says its a ""must try"". The color is a hazy amber color. Little to no head, with excellent lacing. The aroma is like of a piny forest of hops. The flavor is sweet, with a huge hop kick. Flavor not bitter. It has a long mouthfeel where the hops hang out on the back of your throat and it pleads for another sip. I could sit and finish the keg. This is my first experience with russian river brewing company. I cannot wait to try any and all of their beers. Keep up the good work!!!"
"I like it, and I will go back for more of it while it lasts."
"D-Very drinkable @ 6.0 ABV, little too high to be called a session beer but I could imagine drinking these for awhile."
"Thanks to torchednoodle for the opportunity to try this one!"
"I don't think I'd ever session this stuff because it's so intense, but sipping on a pint is divine. Also, no alcohol is detected behind such a potent hop bill. Great stuff."
"This is definately drinkable!"
"Picked this one up in LA about two weeks ago and brought it back home with me. Bottle date within 60 days of drinking. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Really nice looking IPA. Big white head, crisp clear light orange/gold, with tons of lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit, lemon, and a hit of malty sweetness in the back. Flavor follows the nose, and this one is super delicious. It's nicely hopped, but the balance between the pale malts and hops is really remarkable. Very clean, crisp, on the lighter side of medium bodied. Super easy drinking. If this were readily available around me, it would be my go-to IPA. Alas, it is not, but I am really glad I tried it. Will try to get it again."
"Over all, a very good California style IPA."
"Wow, what a treat of a beer. It's even pretty affordable for a world-class IPA. If the hops weren't so complex and delicious, I would accuse this beer of being one-dimensional. But I wouldn't want it to change. Thanks RR!"
"Damn good brew. Best IPA I've ever had, Probably not. Would I drink again, Fuckin eh I would. Very solid brew all around"
"I could drink this all day if I had regular access to it. I suppose my bias is toward sessioning IPAs but this one goes down the hatch easy. For me, it's a catch 22- I don't have regular access to it, so I want to savor it when I get the chance, but it goes down so smooth!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and floral hops are clearly dominating with some notes of bitter hops are also clearly identifiable. Taste is also dominated by a complex and well built hop profile which provide a very good and complex mix between some citrus and bitter notes. Malt profile is kept very low in the mix but can still be felt. Full body with great carbonation. Quite a handful though and not your typical session IPA."
"Had this while visiting San Diego last October. This poured a light amber color with a medium sized but full off-whiite head and very nice walls of lace. The aroma is strictly IBU's, the classic cat piss loveliness if you are so inclined. A modicum of low lying malt. The flavor tells you drink me! The piss and vinegar is still there but it is beautifully mellowed with a sweet melon and apple accent over a very mild malt base. This really becomes highly drinkable after the first few swallows. The bitter hops have their way and it's quite respectable. Great choice, try it quick!"
"Like the tap, the bottle just runs out of steam in the end. At $8 or even $10 a six-pack I would recommend this beer to newbies, but given the price point of this beer I can't in good conscience recommend it at all. This is a light IPA similar to, yet preferred within context, to Harpoon's offering. Not a hophead brew by any means."
"its just crazy how hoppy this beer is. the aroma and bitterness take over and except for perhaps the hop flavor being overwhelmed suits the style just fine."
"This is a very solid IPA from Russian River. I don't know if it's the best I've ever had, but it's certainly up there. If I could get it around here I could see it being a regular for me. As it is, I won't pay to have it shipped here from California, but I'm happy to have tried it. Recommended for any IPA fan."
"overall a very solid IPA, worth trying if you can find it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"This is a great IPA. Distinct, bitter, but not at all cloying. The malt is solid, but not sweet. Not at all heavy. Very refreshing, and great for a hophead. Nice work."
"The beer was served in a Chimay chalice glass. Golden yellor color with not much head, but some lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was full of fresh hops. The flavor matches the aroma. It is very hoppt. A perfect beer for hopheads. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, cleansing the palate with all the hop bitterness. This is very drinkable, but if your not a fan of hops, stay away from this beer and leave it for those of us that like over the top brews."
"D-Really high, right fine brew"
"D: Another offering that I picked up at Collins in Seattle. Very drinkable and highly recommended with their rib eye."
"This refreshingly hoppy beer did not disappoint. Not intensely hop ridden but still noticeable within the aftertaste. The hops finished off with a sweet and pleasantly strong aroma. With a clear golden appearance this beer is both easy to drink and quite satisfying as well."
"Taste was very good, a great hop blast, well supported and well balanced. Overtones of licorice and small fruity notes. Mouthfeel was mildly astringent, clean finish, a little watery. Drinkability was outstanding, low enough in alcohol be almost be sessionable, and delicious and satisfying with every sip. Great stuff."
"D - This is one solid IPA and has a similar hop profile to Pliny's and is less complex. A very drinkable IPA as the hops doesn't completely blast away your palate. Another very good brew from RRBC."
"I honestly could drink this guy everyday all day. I just wish it was more readily available."
"More impressed with this beer, not sure if it was fresher from bottle than from the keg i reported a while back. couple people preferred this to the Pliny. Pliny I thought blew it away. more IBU's in this? seemed to have an edgier bitter finish. nice nose. not sure if the price on this is much less than pliny, alc is much less, maybe go for this when looking for a lower alc beer. 4.0 across the board"
"Pours a copper color with white fluffy head and residuals floating throughout. Medium carbonation. Sticky lacing left behind as the beer is drank. Smells of sugary malts and a light smell of fruity hops. Earthy, leathery malts complimented by a mild citrusy/fruity hops flavor. Mild bitter aftertaste. Light mouth feel with medium/low carbonation. I could definitely drink several of these beers. Overall I was fairly surprised how mild this beer was. After all, the label describes the beer as ""...a bold IPA packed full of hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness."" I didn't get this. Maybe I got a bad bottle or maybe because I drank it 119 days after it was bottled? Who knows? Not what I expected but still a good beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light and drinkability is exceptional. As good as it gets when it comes to domestic IPA's. Excellent stuff."
"I heard raves about Russian River and now I know why. Very nice for its style. Hoppy taste, almost like juniper berries, but still drinkible. Color and smell are both outstanding. I had to go to San Deigo to find it as none of the Vegas stores carry it."
"Very light amber-yellow colored pour with a big fluffy head that evaporates rapidly. Heavy citrus aroma, mainly grapefruit and a little malt. Very dry, much more so than Pliny the Elder. Nearly as good as that beer though, another huge winner from Russian River."
"Drinkability is awesome. I could swill this all night!!! A pity this is not available here in Virginia. A truly great beer."
"I wish I had a Racer 5 to compare this to but it seemed comparable. If this were available to me it would be a welcome addition to my IPA rotation."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy enough; but somthing off about the newer batches I have had as compared to two years ago or so."
"D: There's probably a rule against mentioning AB twice during a RR review so I'll just shutup and say that it is almost certainly the best drinking IPA I've had in years, if not ever."
"Overall impression: A classic West Coast IPA. This is clean and sharp. Truly a treat to cherish."
"I poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a golden yellow with a thick, lucious, white head. The head has nice staying power and leaves beutiful lacing. The aroma is of pine potpouri. Like any good IPA the taste is heavy on pine notes. The resin in this one coats your tongue and stays around for a while. There is a malty backbone that lets it have some balance. This pig is medium bodied with decent carbonation. It goes down very nice. Probably the best IPA I have had, it is a DIPA with a lower ABV."
"D - I had two of these at the brewpub without effort. Goes down so smooth."
"a really really solid west coast IPA i will reach for this one again for sure! exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. well done!"
"Drinkability? Well, the bottle tells you not to store it, and I'm happy to oblige..."
"D: This beer defines drinkability. Goes down so easily. Too bad this is my only one, but I will enjoy it thoroughly!"
"A must try."
"Overall impression: This is a damned fine beer, a nice representation of the style. Well worth the 4 bucks for a pint bottle."
"A wonderful brew. Thanks Matt for the chance to have this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours clear gold with a nice white head. Floral hop aroma, some pine, and just a little grapefruit. Sharp hop taste up front, resin flavors dominating the citrus, with a caramel back. Overall, a great IPA with strong hop flavors but with a light body."
"What a nice IPA. May not be as mind blowing as some claim - at least according to my taste buds - but quite a nice drinker and quite a good IPA."
"Earned a permanent spot on my wants list."
"A very good, citrusy IPA of the west coast variety. I enjoyed it very much. Appearance was golden, with moderate head and good retention. Smell was fantastic, like raw hops. Man I love that smell. Taste was slightly piney, and a little grapefruit. Mouthfeel was moderate, not super heavy or light. Drinkability was very good, I could drink 6 of these quite easily."
"I've gotta get this on tap at some point - while watcing a ballgame or something."
"Beautiful beer that lives up to its billing here as one of the best American IPAs. I'd drink it all the time if I could."
"A delicious IPA! Very pleasant citrus and floral aroma. A nice lingering aftertaste, with hints of grapefruit and fresh hops. This beer really has everything I'm looking for in an IPA. The drinkability is insanely high. Blind Pig is amazingly tasty and refreshing, and would be easily chuggable. Fresh hops with a wonderfully smooth feel. It would be a regular beer for me, if only it was available where I live."
"Mouthfeel is bitter, medium bodied, citrusy, with a bitter finish."
"D: Very tasty and easily drinkable. 6% ABV is more than manageable."
"Very drinkable at 6% abv. You can't detect any booziness. I could have 20 of these... just kidding. I wish I could. :)"
"A: Sea foam froth, the color of wet straw, line of head around the edge, minimal carbonation visible in the beer - 4.25, S: Absolutely loaded with grapefruity and citrusy hops, though hops dominate the nose there is a nice solid malt build - 5.00, T: Heaps of hops from the beginning to the end of this beer, semi-dry and bitter, has elements of freshly cut grass and pine sap - 4.50, M: 4.00, D: An extremely solid representation of the style, hops play the main role and hence this is a beer every hophead should seek - 4.50"
"Very easy to drink, leaves a nice bitterness in the mouth that lingers for a while."
"Drinkability: Could drink 'em all day long. Light, fresh, and super smooth. Wish this was available in SLO."
"500 ml bottle, Bottled on dating ""093008"" = FRESH. The label tells me ""This beer does not get better with age! Please do not age me!"" Not being one to go against the brewers wishes... This one pours lighter golden amber, slight haze, larger dark eggshell head, which shows better then average retention, nice puff/fluff, tons of outstanding, fine lace, vibrant floral hop nose. Simply great ale. Fresh hops in all their bittering/flavoring glory, sweet malts laying the under carpet down. Fine stuff, this would be a go to beer, if they distributed in my area...."
"Wow! What a pleasure to try on tap! I'm not sure the bottled version would be as good as the on tap version, but I'm sure it's up there. If you find out that your local bar has this on tap, make sure you show up early to try this wonderful Russian River beer."
"Good beer but to me its nothing more then a good west coast ipa.Sorry RR.I'll have it again for sure but I dont think I'll buy another growler."
"Blind pig is an excellent ipa, very drinkable. Golden amber appearance with minimal head, excellent lacing. Smells of citrus and even honey with malt mixed in here and there. Mouthfeel is very good and they go down very easily. I stopped myself after 2 but I could have easily had 2 more without any problem, too bad I drove there. Russian river hit it right on the button with this brew. Its super tasty and I love it. Cannot wait until its sold in PA on a regular basis."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty easy drinking IPA. I really enjoyed drinking this one. Russian River does not disappoint. This would be a mainstay in my fridge if we were able to get this here in TX."
"Great beer if you are a devotee of hops."
"4/4.5/5/4/4.5"
"D - the malt is too much for me, but moderate alcohol content makes this very smooth"
"D: Drinkability is killer. I could just keep pouring them down. ABV at 6%?? Are you joking? I want another one. But RR has one thing down ... If you only want one ... they have the perfect sized bottles."
"Highly recommended."
"D: Goes down easy, this concoction is biter without any harshness, its very clean and tasty. My go to IPA. Recommended try."
"Very drinkable, almost sessionable, but a pleasure to share with a close friend. Thanks Grant!"
"A great IPA, this Blind Pig. It's not as over-the-top as its cousin, Pliny the Elder, but it's still delicious. This bottle was fresh, but I can imagine that it's even better when it's straight from the brewery. I would love to be able to get this beer here in TX. Maybe one day. Until then, I'll have to make more trips to Colorado."
"This is the closest I have come to rating a beer as perfect, and I believe I was right in doing so. This beer is amazing and is sure to please any hop-head, such as myself!"
"This is just an extremely well crafted and solid IPA from Russian River. All of the flavors that you would want in a West Coast IPA plus the look, body, and most of all, drinkibility were all top notch. Worth seeking out."
"Endlessly drinkable...Russian River defies normalcy once again with this incredible IPA."
"D - I tend to think of this as a more sessionable version of Pliny with a comparable but pinier taste. Very enjoyable and won't knock you on your butt as quickly as its double IPA counterpart. After having both a bunch of times now I actually prefer Blind Pig. Yes, you will drink a lot of these and yes, you will still feel great in the morning."
"Well worth tracking down a bottle. Makes a great session beer."
"D-Would drink it all day long. Perfect session beer."
"Top notch IPA, very tasty and good if you can get it local. The shipping costs will prohibit me from enjoying this one very often."
"This beer is a total vessel for the deliverance of hops. That seems to be the whole point of it. I prefer an IPA with a bit more malty sweetness to counter act the obvious bitterness of the hops and create a balance that contrasts and pops out a lot more flavor from both. That said, this is a single IPA and it is expected to be a bit dryer. I like this one, it's rather high grade stuff and I would be happy to drink it again."
"great beer. one of the best IPA's around. only wish i could get more of here in PA."
"A great IPA."
"Bottle purchased at Liquor Max in Loveland, CO. Pours hazy orange with an average, white head, mostly lasting with good lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (grain, hay, straw), heavy hops (flowers, pine, citrus), average yeast (dough, sweat) with notes of apple, pear, and peach. Medium bodied, mineral texture, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. Long duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity, and heavy bitterness."
"D- I was really looking forward to trying this one. My 3rd RR brew. Good IPA overall but it doesn't really stand out to me. A bit over hyped IMHO."
"bottle brewed 6 weeks ago poured into a tulip glass has a nice orange ice tea color and a thick one finger white head that retained rather well and laced the glass nicely. aroma has juicy grapefruit hops, citrus peels, pine, orange zest, and underlying malts. perfumed and enticing. mouth feel is medium with biting carbonation and good coating. flavor is all about the hops, (pine, grapefruit, citrus), sweet enough to keep the bitterness down, and just enough caramel malt to keep the hops balanced. finish has a long duration of hops coating. very good and extremely fresh tasting."
"The downside is I only bought one bottle. I will enjoy this beer anytime I can find it."
"[Cask at O'Brien's] Poured a lightly hazy, copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus fruits, pine resin, floral hops and faint malts as well. Taste was super, tangerine and other citrus fruits, more pine and a strong grapefruit bitterness. The IBUs are incredible on this one."
"D: Really smooth and drinkable. Will definitely get it again, either next time I'm at RR or else next time I find it in a bottle."
"A fairly drinkable beer and could easily be enjoyed for multiple rounds. A good brew that I would recommend to IPA fans."
"D: Excellent West Coast IPA. Lots and lots of hops, but not too bitter to be undrinkable. Good balance for an IPA, which is impressive to me because the malt is so understated. I am a fan of grapefruit-dominant IPAs, so this is a winner for me. Low alcohol, smooth mouthfeel and great flavor make this an easy drinker. It was nice to find this here in LA, and hopefully it'll be something not to hard for find for the foreseeable future."
"Overall, a decent IPA. If you like an IPA on the very-hoppy side then you might like this. But it's a bit unbalanced for me."
"Taste is a delicious blend of bready malts, fresh fruits and floral hops. Medium body is very well carbonated. Near perfect example of teh style."
"500ml bottle received as an extra from Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Bottled on 072208 and served in my Ayinger Becker. Poured a translucent orange-gold with tiny bubbles in solution. 1.5 inch fluffy white head embedded with craters left behind strands of lacing as it receded. Nose was sweet grapefruit, piney hops and a light grainy quality in the back. Grapefruit sweetness is diminished in the mouth and hops bitterness is amplified. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a bitter/astringency that lingers between quaffs. Top notch IPA. Not my style per se, but I can really appreciate the quality of this brew."
"Zum wohl!"
"D - Could drink this all night and all day. A great tasting beer. Bud Light says they have drinkability. Well Bud tastes like crap in a bucket. This tastes like heaven and you still could drink it all day."
"D: The ale has a relatively low alcohol level that never rears it head. I'd be happy with a six pack of 500 mL bottles."
"D - Packed with hops but still very drinkable and well balanced in the sense I could have several. Reminds me of a smaller version of the Pliny's."
"Great beer!!"
"Thanks to SkinnyElvis for the Halloween '08 treat!"
"GABF Weekend '08: Enjoyed at the Falling Rock Tap Room. A side by side comparison of this versus the Pliney the Elder revealed that this beer had much better hop flavor, a preferred balance, and superb drinkability. The beer showcases the hop flavor and aroma beautifully with a delicate, strong balance of fresh grapefruit, orange zest, lemongrass, pine, and a clean resin-ey bitterness. This is all woven into a very malty, but lightly flavored caramel-barley malt base. The body supports the hops and sweetness well and doesn't interfere with the hop flavor at all. Finishes very clean, light, and with a long lingering hop flavor. Bitterness is somewhat light, but lends to great drinkability. Undoubtedly the best balanced IPA out there- maybe the best period."
"the beginning of the story - my intro to pliny the elder came via Dave in CA who's a great BA and he geve me a bonus blind pig mug from the RR brewpub. almost 2 years later I now have had the blind pig in that mug!"
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a huge fluffy white head. It also has great lacing. The aroma is an initial hop pop in the old olfactory system. There are definite fruit (grapefruit), floral and slight caramel notes. The taste is initially very hoppy - bitter. There are grapefruit note and a slight hint of sweetness. It is a bit one-sided with hops...could use a bit more malt backbone for balance. There is a lingering bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. There is a residual slickness that coats the tongue. Overall, this is an excellent hoppy brew. Definitely works to satisfy a lupulin urge."
"Go drink this beer, stop reading my review."
"Drinkability - a special treat; you folks out west are in good hands with these to quench your thirst. A big thanks, Ken, for hooking me up with this delicious Top 100 brew."
"D: Yeah, this is a nice beer. It's pretty heavy and hop-y, however. I couldn't drink em all night. Elder is smoother and most balanced, despite being stronger."
"D: This is what more IPAs need to be. Please and thanks to have some more."
"The body is a bit sweet and would like it to be a bit smoother. Carbonation is a bit low, which could help out. Overall a decent IPA with a great hop presence, but IMO really lacks the distinct malt backing to make it a great beer. Good drinkability though."
"Pours a clear golden with minimal off with head. Smells bitter, piney, and with a hint of citrus. Tastes less bitter than the smell, but still a nice bite. Feels good in the mouth, very smooth. Leaves a nice lasting bitterness."
"D: A really nice IPA. I am not a fan of ""soapy"" IPA's, but this one had that quality for me. It just isn't my thing, but I still found this beer to be very tasty."
"D-A wonderful West Coast IPA. Maybe just a bit thin in body but otherwise tough to beat...see it's ""Elder"" brother though!"
"easier to drink alone than pliny but would not hold up as well to spicy food.. but would still hold up enough quite likely. more sessionable than pliny, but they both have their place."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable IPA especially at 6%. This may be my favorite west coast IPA."
"D-Depends on what you want in an IPA and what you like. This is as bitter an IPA as I've had but lacks the overall juicy hop notes I like. I much preferred Pliny to this. I always like to compare the big hitters to our state's best known canned IPA Surly Furious (which is kind of in the middle of the IPA and DIPA area imho). Personally I think Furious is a better beer. The bitterness is about the same but Furious has a better overall flavor to me. I know others really like this and it has won many awards but for me it is not an elite IPA because it is too one-sided and lacks the juicy flavorful hop elements I enjoy."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a nice frothy white head that gets smaller as the beer is drank and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of citrusy grapefruit. The taste is citrusy and dry with grapefruit flavors. This beer has a medium body and is nicely carbonated. Drinkability is good I could easily have a few of these if this beer was readily available to me."
"It's scarce- buy it without thinking twice."
"Pours a nice orangey color with nice head that quickly dissipates. Nice lacing that lasts throughout the glass. Nice piney/citrus hop flavor and smell but not overly bitter. This is a beer that I could drink alot of and hopefully one day will be able to easily."
"This will be the second beer I have tried from Russian River, Supplication being the first, and Pliny soon to be the third. Many many thanks to my big sister, Christian for tracking it down during her stay in San Diego. Poured in to a snifter so as to hopefully rouse some of the aroma. Beer was served just above room temperature, chilled is a good way of putting it. Appearance is a cool gold, and heading is about one finger. The head quickly fades in to a thin white lacing with good retention. Oily hops come to mind first in the aroma, then come citrus fruits such as pineapple and tangerine. Mild earth smells also show themselves to an extent. Taste is composed of grassy hop resins, bit of tobacco, cream and orange jump in at times. Mouthfeel is intense in its bitterness. It leaves the tongue feeling a little numb. Malt presence could possibly be lifted a bit to balance the hops, but overall this is still hardly a problem. Blind Pig strikes me a being a session IPA for people who really bitter, hoppy brews, I wish I had a few more bottles. Final thoughts: This is a very solid India Pale. I wasn't exactly blown away, but that is fine. Instead, I am left feeling very satisfied and refreshed. I can imagine this being a regular in my fridge if only it were available in my state...maybe one day. Cheers"
"Overall, I think this was a quality IPA. The only complaint I have with this one is that I wish the consistency of the beer was little thicker. At certain points, it felt as if I was drinking soda water (the taste still being excellent). Other than that, a great beer."
"pours a golden color with a quickly fading white head. great lacing. the nose is floral and spicy hops. the taste is very bitter, bitter hops, floral hops, subtle sweet malts. medium to full body, medium spritzy carbo. good brew..."
"I, among so many other Philadelphians, anxiously await Russian River shipment time every year. To Vinny, thank you for continuing to send your perfect IPAs to my city! Cheers"
"D - I could drink this beer all day long. It's everything I like in an IPA and nothing I don't."
"Was surprised to find this on tap at Monk's, but hey it was good for me! Looking forward to more of this... but i've not seen it in bottles around the NJ area, much less on tap!"
"i could drink these like water i think. this is possibly my favorite offering i have tried from russian river."
"D= This was a good beer but it is hard not to compare it other IPAs I like better. Still it was damn good and well worth drinking."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the most drinkable IPA's that doesn't disappoint on the hops. Could suck these back all the time if I had more access to them."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat oily, but a little thinner than expected. Mild/moderate carbonation."
"Judging this beer simply as it's trying to be, it's perfect. It is the quintessential West Coast, American IPA. Drinkability is great. Highly recommended."
"Overall impression: Certainly hop heavy - if you are hophead this one should be a must-try."
"Sampled from bottle- pours a cloudy light orange, minimal soapy head. Nose- sweet candied fruit, light piney perfume. Taste- soapy juicy grapefruit rinds, light biscuity malts. Medium bodied hop delivery vehicle. Oily hops leave a dry finish with some orange aftertaste. Very good IPA"
"Excellent stuff. Almost as good as the Flossmoor Vishnu's Vice IPA. I don't think anything can ever top that. I cry every night because it was only brewed once."
"D ~ Enjoyable and perhaps the best IPA that I've sampled to date. (Surly Furious comes to mind) Very managable ABV thats well concealed. A little over hopped to be something I'd session with on a regular basis. A quality offering from Russian Rivers. Certainly worth a try & very approachable. Pick up a pig if you get a chance."
"Awesome big west coast ipa representation."
"This is quite a good IPA, but does not quite reach the level of greatness in my book. Absolutely worth getting your hands on, though."
"D: wonderful... can do again and again"
"It's at the very least tied for my favorite IPA."
"D: Very high. A great all-night beer if you have the $!"
"Pours a cloudy light orange, with a quarter inch of fluffy white head. Smells strongly of citrus and pine. Taste is very bitter, with a moderate amount of grapefruit and other citrus. Just a little bit two-dimensional with the flavor--it was a bit weak, and the bitterness overpowered the citrus part of it. Carbonation is just right, and the lightness makes it a very drinkable beer. Overall, an impressive IPA, but the flavor could have been a notch more complex."
"To all the hop heads out there - try this one out. Highly drinkable and worth a try. Thanks pimpp, DOH, I mean pwoods!"
"Thanks to brdc for sending this my way. It's not to often that I get to pour a Russian River beer into my Russian River shaker glass so I dusted it off just for this. Appears a lightly cloudy, golden yellow color with a healthy two fingers of white foam. Smells of hops - pine, citrus(mainly lemon), and sweet malt. Just like the nose, the taste lets you know there's hops in here. Bitter hops prevail with notes of pine needles, lemon, grapefruit, lime and orange peel followed by a nice mildly toasted caramel malt backbone. Slightly oily on the tongue with medium carbonation and body. Wow, this went down rather quickly. I prefer a little more balance in an IPA (Two Hearted is my standard), but this was really great and I'll certainly seek it out again."
"This is a fantastic IPA, and I could drink it all night."
"All in all, a great hoppy brew. Just the way I like em. I can't drink too many of these intensely hoppy beers in one sitting these days. But it was fantastic, and a pleasure to have just one!"
"D. This is a very drinkable beer i wish i bought more to have. I like this offering from RR better than Elder."
"Drinkability: I will have difficulty making it through my bottle tonight. The hops are overboard and unbalanced."
"The drinkability is very good it really is a must try and fresh lives up to the hype. Prosit, MK"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Both are interesting. Mouthfeel is grain and malt dissolving into hoppiness. Drinkability is good again due to metallic bite in the finish."
"This is an outstanding IPA that I'll keep my eye out for in the future."
"Solid medium body with active bubbles. Aftertaste is very dry and a little bitter and thats how I like 'em. The sheer hop presence alone makes this one a winner in my book, but with the abv being only 6% this climbs to the upper echelon of brews to fulfill my bitter desires. Thanks so much, Mike, for this awesome beer."
"Very Good beer. Big hoppy and citrus flavors. Crisp and rather smooth. I would have liked a bit more malt in the finish. However that is a minor complaint. Not as complex as I tend to like my beers. But it is enjoyable. Drinkability is high. As a matter of fact, at 6% I wouldn't mind a keg of this in the den."
"Overall, I was expecting much more from this one to be quite honest. It is a good IPA however, just less than I was expecting."
"Pours golden with a lovely, thin head and amazing lacing. The smell is huge, citrusy and pineapple-like. The taste is malty and tea-like, with lovely citrusy, grapefuity hops. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin but refreshing. This is a highly drinkable example of the style."
"Special thanks to jhenry04 for sending me this one in our trade."
"Very drinkable, a super AIPA! A bit more malt depth & flavor complexity is need to rate this higher"
"Pours a hazy and surprisingly light golden amber color with a huge stiff white head that resists fading. A ton of Belgian lacing, some 3D. The smell is aggressive, refreshing, floral and piny yet tropical in nature with a nicely balanced sweet underpinning. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and tangy with hop presence. The piny character lingers nicely. A real easy drinker. The 6% ABV is well integrated and quite sessionable. Wow! Really glad to see this one enjoying a wider distribution. My first review of a Russian River product; enjoyed Pliny the Elder and Younger at Mugs Ale House before i began reviewing."
"The taste is similar, with the same elements and range as the aroma. None of the hop elements, grapefruit or otherwise, is too strong so they all are evident. Each element is fairly restrained, for example compared to the Russian River IPA, where the grapefruit tends to dominate all, and the hops are nicely complemented by the sweet, raisiny-fruity character of the malt and alcohol. In sum, it has a lot of character and a lot of flavour, with the rich range more than making up for the relatively restrained nature of each element, a wonderful trait all too rare for IPAs. It's highly drinkable and great with food or alone."
"Really what can I say about this beer that has not been said already. A load of hops in the aroma, the smell of pine is definitely persistent. Lovely copper color. Then to the taste, wow lots of hops, yet not overpowering. Smooth finish for being as hoppy as it is. I was expecting to be punched by the hops, but I was just pushed in the face a little bit. Nice smooth mouth feel. This is a surprisingly drinkable IPA for the amount of hop kick it exudes. Loved the beer and can't wait to go and have another one."
"A very good IPA offering."
"HV"
"This is a truly great IPA! Upon pouring into my pint class whiffs of sweet bitter hops had my salivary glands a pumping. She pours clean and golden but with some small particulates floating about. Nose is off the hook, everything a like in an IPA Piney, tart, fruity and tangy - yummy. Flavor follows nose - spot on! Hops provide a blasting bitterness which is tempered with sweetness. This is very drinkable beer that just rolls over the tongue, drink after drink...I need some more please!"
"A great IPA. The expansion of RRBC means bottles are plentiful in the Bay Area--a wonderful thing."
"Hazy dark gold with a two finger cap of light beige foam off the pour. About a finger's worth stuck around for a long time, producing some slightly chunky lacing. Lots of pine in the aroma, a bit powdery too, with notes of pineapple and various citrus fruits (grapefruit and lemon mostly). A little malt sweetness made itself known up front, but this was quickly joined by hops, citrus and tropical fruits, then gave way to a solid grapefruit bitterness that lingered long into the finish. Quite a depth of hop flavour, wave after wave hits the palate yet doesn't seem to dull the tongue. Medium bodied with a rich texture, plenty of carbonation that leaned towards some creaminess, sort of dry too. Great stuff. This is the type of balance I like in an AIPA, hop flavour and bitterness front and center, but with a malt backbone that doesn't wither under the lupulin onslaught."
"Pours a beautiful honey color, bright off white head, that fades fairly quickly. Smell is an amazing cornucopia of hops with grapefruit & pine notes both present. Taste is a bit of a let down compared to the amazing aroma. I know it's an ipa, and as such a healthy dose of hops is expected, but a bit more balance would've been more enjoyable. Mouthfeel is great, not too sticky, not too watery. A really good ipa. Here in the NW we're a bit spoiled, so maybe i'm biased. But still, a great beer that i would enjoy having again."
"I find this beer disjointed. Flavors are conflicted and the rough edges of some flavors fight to leave a pukey dry in the back of the throat. This beer is complex in hoppiness, but not tremendously drinkable. Tastes like chewing on hop bits."
"Finish was very piney/woody with a nice hop bite. A very nice/different IPA. I love that i have tried this beer and this redition of an IPA. Very surprising and i highly recommend for the experience."
"Pours a beautiful glowing orange/gold color, damn near the perfect color for an IPA. Big frothy off-white head fades extremely slowly, leaving incredible amounts of lacing. Big juicy grapefruit on the nose, tangerine, pine, caramel malty goodness. Taste delivers on all the aromas, much heavier on the pine, crazy amounts of citrus taste, some pineapple. This is just a phenomenal IPA, everything you could want in an American IPA, and I'm quite pleased I got to try this. My 2nd Russian River brew, and I couldn't be more impressed with this brewery."
"Many thanks to golubj for sending me this bottle."
"D: Lives up to it's reputation as an intense, flavorful 'West Coast' IPA. Despite that fact, Blind Pig really didn't win me over. This beer has plenty of rave reviews and I can't discount them; mine is that this needs some balance to make it more palatable for my own tastes. Still, it's absolutely worth seeking out - judge for yourself."
"Cheer"
"Medium body, with light carbonation. Very easy to drink. A simple, solid IPA that is not over the top."
"Thank the gods I've developed a love for IPA's...."
"I'm very pleased that this beer is more accessible now, but I realize the importance of drinking it as fresh as possible. An ultimate beer for hop-heads, the bitterness is quite intense. I could keep coming back to this time and time again..."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. solid malt base. good hop character. a solid ipa."
"Pours a clear yellow gold, thin white head, drops to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, pine and grapefruit, caramel, apricots, lightly fruity, a bit toasty, floral, big hops, nicely mixed up. Taste is nice, very biscuity and toasty off the bat, grainy, caramel malt sweetness, grapefruit, floral, some fruit, light pine, solid spicy bitter kick in the finish, very balanced and drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and enjoyable. Nice IPA. Top 100? Not in my opinion, but very good nonetheless."
"I like that this is an IPA where hop flavor is really the showcase. The malts are nicely used to restrain it from being too hop-heavy, but still, this is a hop lover's IPA."
"D- Easy to drink, and over all tastes great."
"I'd like to sample a whole bottle of this, or have a couple, to see how it tastes through a slow sitting. Only the second Russian River beer I've tasted, & it's very good. Fantastic hops front & center & only the lack of complexity keeps this off the top tier of beers for me; but it's really, really close. Great stuff. I'm going to need to try this one again in the future."
"Pours amber brown with thin white head. Aroma is hops, hops and hops with subtle roastiness and pine. Flavor begins roasty and citrusy and finishes with nice hops in the throat and sinus. Medium body with very nice mouth feel. Very good India Pale Ale."
"Tastes like hops. Yummy. Grapefruit, pine, spice meld nicely around a light malt. Very drinkable and went quite well with the pizza I got."
"Drinkability: No question, this would be my desert island beer. It's loaded with flavor, yet easy drinking, crisp, and refreshing. As close to a perfect beer as I can imagine."
"D: Highly recommended this beer. Great taste."
"D: Very drinkable by bottle or growler. It is one of the best tasting most drinkable beers in the world. I would put it up against any IPA in the world. Ittt'sss Gooodddd! A bit better in the growler than the bottle, but if I had access I would drink this one all summer long."
"D - This is a very good IPA. My first RR beer has me wanting more."
"D - Not a session beer, but a wonderful IPA. Every sips begs for another. I could grow weary eventually, however."
"Not too bad. If you like aggressive dryness, this one's for you."
"Overall: excellent IPA, be sure to try one before you die."
"D- In spite of it's intense hoppiness, I actually could go for another, except that I don't have more :("
"This was unquestionably one of the most bitter beers I have sampled to date. I can appreciate a wide array of IPA's but there needs to be some semblance of balance for me to find them enjoyable."
"Drinkability - If the bitter was just slightly more rounded out, this one could be a staple. As is, still pretty damn good."
"Note: when I was at Falling rock last week, I ordered the Elder and my friend ordered the Blind Pig. We both tried eachother's beer and his had a surprising pilsner quality to it, albeit a very hoppy pils. It's definately not found in the bottled version so I wonder what was up with the draft..."
"The taste has a good malt backbone and is really smooth for the hop characteristics it has. The IBU's give you a slight slap on the second part the the taste but not abrasive at all. In the mouth you are left with a nice tingling on the tongue and it is moderately carbonated. Overall a wonderfully solid American IPA."
"As DIPA's go, this is certainly one of the best I've had."
"D- For all the hype, i really wasnt that impressed. I have no reason to hate on this brewery, i loved pliny a lot more, though."
"Overall, I didn't really care for the hop flavor profile. I was surprised considering how much I liked the Pliny (which was much more balanced). Given the same price, I would take the Pliny over this any day of the week."
"D: Insanely drinkable, tastes like a DIPA but drinks like an IPA a marvel of balance between malts and hops. An absolute wonder from the west coast. I think I'm in love with Russian River."
"One of the most drinkable beers I have ever had."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Flavor on this IPA is really nice, and alcohol is easily sessionable. It's quite a nice beer."
"first taste surprises. with a smell that is so intense one would expect extreme bitter. but its not. yes there is a nice little bite on the back end. but there is an awesome flavor. full flavor. smoooth. but like i said a hint of bite on the tail end. this beer basically drinks itself its so good. if it is this good out of a bottle i cant wait to try it off tap."
"Poured a nice golden color with a respectable white head that fell to a film. Smell is off the charts. Resiny, piney hop oil, floral tangerine and slightly grassy. Wow! Taste is no disappointment either! Hops take the drivers seat, citrus and pine play well together and are followed by a grassy, earthy, white bread. Mouthfeel is slick and soapy. Full bodied hop-tastic!"
"D- For me, I can only handle one beer a week with this level of hop intensity."
"As far as drinkability.... I wanted a few more. Great beer."
"Thanks to Weibull for this one!"
"A golden honey colored body with an orange tinted hue. It displays a lage off white head that us sticky, cream and well brillaint. Excellent lace deposits all around the glass on this. As if it didn't look good enough the nose comes through evenn better, WOW! Super fresh and oozing with pine, pineapple, grapefruit and orange/lemon zest. The taste is again exceptional with the same exploading juicey hop flavors as in the nose plus some dry/spiceness on a very well done sweet malted canvase. This beer is between med/thick but with a great hop oil feel that keeps it going down smooth. Overall even though Blind Pig is extreme and bursting with flavor it is in no way overwellming. Just as well done as an IPA can be IMO."
"d: An IPA I wont soon forget. One of the best I have had. Vinnie over at Russian River is one gifted SOB. This and Pliny the elder are two of the finest crafted beers I have been fortunate enough to experience. My compliments to the brewer."
"Bought this 500ml bottle from Lone Hill Liquors. Poured a bright golden amber color with a thin light head. Hops galore on the nose, with hints of fresh pine & citrus. A perfect balance of malt and hops, very well structured. It had a smooth, dry mouthfeel with even carbonation and left a lingering bitterness on the palate. This is a superb, very drinkable I.P.A. and makes me wish I lived closer to the Russian River."
"D- Highly recommended here. Very great taste and just plain solid."
"Thanks again for this gem, Bill!"
"D - I gotta get more of this"
"Great beer to pair with cheese, apple, or whatever else ya got. Oink."
"One of my favorite IPAs, beaten only by Younger and Alesmith's offering. Get your hands on it if you can get it fresh!"
"really nice aroma of pineapple and fruit. Bitter taste, wish I bought more.."
"Okay I get it. This is the benchmark for the ""West Coast IPA"". Or, if it isn't, it should be. Six percent means it's just over sessionable and it doesn't rip your face off (not always bad!) the way a big DIPA can. Just right."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"A great beer. Works great with a nice sharp Italian table cheese. Huge thanks to BrewerB for this in a trade. And a big cheers to Russian River for a great offering."
"Big ups to RblWthACoz for the hook-up..Proper!"
"Pours a clear deep yellow/orange color with a massive flufftastic white head. Nose is balls out hops and a very slight skunk. Taste is quite incredible with an awesome citrus and pine hop profile that is beaten by few if any IPAs. Like eating a bowl of pellet hops. Very nice mouthfeel, a touch dry. Drinkability is second to none here, as this one is chuggable as hell. Overall a very very good IPA that I would love to have available locally. Midnight sun IPAs are some of the best in the world, but Russian River still holds that top spot IMO. amazing beer, strongly recommended."
"Cheers to jerz for this brew in a trade. Pours with a thin head. Fairly light in color for an IPA. Huge nose of pine hops. Tastes mostly of pine but with a bit of citrus. Mouthfeel is smooth & this is a drinkable big hoppy beer. Kind of tastes like the Elder minus the roids. Recommended & worth seeking."
"Pours a very nice cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy/thick, off-white head, lots of nice thick/creamy sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, very hoppy, slight touch of malts, very nice touch of citrus with some pines. The taste is slight sweet, hoppy, bitter, very nice citrus/pines. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome IPA for sure, glad I finally got a chance to try it, highly recommended. Thanks Casey."
"D- Very drinkable!! I could drink a few of these in a sitting. One of the better IPA's I've got to try. Now they (RR) just need to send it to Seattle so I can get it more often."
"Note: In case anyone cares in the slightest, ABV is marked as 6.10% and not 6.00% as on Beer Advocate. Bottled on 7/8/08."
"Never had this on tap, but sorely need to seek it out now."
"D - Drinkability is very good. I could easily have a few of these. It goes down very easy and has a very pleasant hop profile that does not get out of hand at any point. Russian River really nailed a solid brew with the Blind Pig. Highly recommended."
"Overall, Blind Pig is another outstanding brew from Russian River. Those guys sure have their shit together when it comes to brewing. Highly recommended for all hop heads out there."
"D - This is an IPA I could drink all the time assuming I always had fresh access to it."
"If I had more bottles of this I could session this up all day. Incredible."
"Bitter and hoppy upfront, citrusy with lots of oranges again, along with the usual grapefruit and other fruits. Perhaps an occasional hint of sweetness, but it is hops all along, without being overwhelming. Easy to drink, nicely done. Close to an alpha king."
"As an overhopped West Coast IPA Blind Pig is good, but IMO there are better ones out there (Green Flash comes to mind.) Does it live up to the hype? No, but don't let that stop you from trying it."
"Drinkability: A nice serving at a perfect ABV, I could have another but why... Save it for later, my tongue just got off one this brew and is good for the day...."
"So light but with a huge amount of flavor... I could drink this, like... a lot. too bad it's clear across the country."
"This is the hoppiest single IPA I have ever had. Truly a hop head's dream. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is high, this is a very tasty IPA, greater then the sum of it's parts, full of flavor but not to strong or heavy. Can't wait until this is a regular here in town!"
"Drinkability: A very nice manageable level of alcohol that you don't taste even a hint of. Overall, a really good beer, and one I'd gladly have again. It's really an expectations game - when the taste is great after an average aroma, the rising tide seems to left the whole beer, but when it's the other way around ... either way, this beer is recommended."
"Overall- Delicious, 1 of the best IPA's I've had in a while. Lives up to the hype.(Thanks Mike!)"
"D: I could drink tons of these, I just finally found a beer that could possibly replace Two Hearted as my favorite."
"Found this on tap at Hollingshead's Delicatessen - The appearance was very cloudy but the bartender just changed the keg and I got the first pour. Talk about FRESH this beer was like I died and gone to Heaven. Big fruity burst of Peaches and melon. The mouthfeel was very silky and thick like a beer milkshake! The drinkabilty was off the chart. I had a roastbeef and blu cheese sandwich that went pretty well with this tasy IPA."
"M/D - Medium bodied with the nice bitter IPA kick. Very tasty IPA that could be a great session beer."
"Thanks to jhenry04 for a few bottles of this as well as 0110x110 for the TIF treat..."
"Great hop bite right up front. Mellows with a wonderful fruity hop lingering bitterness. Ths one is chewy and delicious. It has that extra je ne sais quois that most ipa's lack. Might be the sticky, oily, fruity hop flavor that does not just make it a hip bomb, but also gives it some balance. It is not just bitter, but full of flavor as well. Wonderful beer. Top 3 IPA's I have tried, easy."
"This is definitely a beer for the hopheads out there. It definitely doesn't pull any punches and is aggressively hoppy. If in the mood for an aggressive hop experience this definitely fits the bill. It doesn't get overly harsh and it is just so dang quaffable. This is much more aromatic and hop flavorful than the draught sample I had previously."
"This isn't a mind blowing beer, but its a top notch representation of the style. Don't kill yourself to get a bottle of this, but if you ever have the opportunity, jump on it."
"taste is more of the same, dry, hoppy, delicious, malt is there, but this baby is all hops. mouthfeel is good, not thin, but not huge either. goes down well. excellent beer, love it."
"Taste starts with herbal hops bitterness and toasted malt. Big citrus and pine hops take over. Shortbread cookie and caramel malt in the background. This one is all about the hops though. Resinous pine bitterness is pervasive and numbingly delicious and appetizing. Raw citrus and sap in the finish. Medium body with a creamy feel. A quintessential West Coast IPA done to damn near perfection. I wish I could get this more easily!"
"Bumping the last rating up from 4.3-->5.0 This is just an amazing IPA as I have always known but I love the mango fruit aspect to it so much... makes it so unique."
"Blind Pig's an excellent IPA. Easily among the best out there. I'd prefer just a little bit more of a piney quality to the hops. But, I'm not going to complain any more than that. This is a very fine IPA. Can Russian River do anything wrong???"
"Overall I have to say this one in know way let me know down. It was the big IPA that it was meant to be while still staying true to it being completely session able. I would love to have this one hooked up to me 24/7 as it was just that good! Go and get some, you really cannot beat this for a west coast IPA."
"Overall, a fantastic IPA, full of flavor and aroma. Not sure how many BP's I could down but it's a sure bet I'd love every one that finds its way into my soup cooler. Highly recommended."
"For a 6.1% IPA, I could drink this all night."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden amber with a big fluffy white head that hangs around for quite a while leaving big clumps of lacing. The smell is huge on floral and citrus hops - grapefruit and pine just jump out of the bottle when it's opened. The taste is hops galore with grapefruit stinging the tongue with bitterness up front and pine resins lingering on the palate at the finish. There is a hint of the bready hop background, but the hops steal the show here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and sticky with hop oils. This is one of the better IPAs I have tasted and especially enjoyable for hopheads like me. Huge thanks to Praveen to sharing this beauty."
"Good nicely balanced with a great malt character. Very caramel and toffee forward. Again with a nice piney earthy hop bitterness. Not overly bitter. Creamy mouthfeel with a medium finish. Nothing extraordinary but very drinkbable nonetheless."
"500ml bottle from Texas poured into Ports 7th Ann Real ale glass. Poured a golden color with tons of hazy particles of hop floating around. The head was thick white and very fluffy with great lacing. Smell is grapefruit citrus, some pine, and malt aroma. Taste is very strong fresh cut grass and pine with a dry peppery malt taste and grapefruit rind bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a creamy carbonation level. The hops and mouthfeel makes this an IPA you can get addicted to. Diffently a border line double IPA with the amount of hops and high IBU taste but not with the big malt content and alcohol alot of doubles have. AS an american IPA for sure the hoppiest out there with great balance and flavor to boot."
"Pours a honey gold in color, slight haze, with a decent sized, fairly bright white fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving some lacing behind. Aroma is a nice sweet citrus aroma of grapefruit, tangerines and mangoes. A softer sweetness of cotton candy accentuates this and a strong grassiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a good amount of lemon, grapefruit, and citrusy hops as well as a large dose of grassiness that cresendoes towards a good sized bitterness that is also slightly peppery. Mouthfeel is light to medium, prickly hops and carbonation on the tongue up front transisition to a peppery bite at the back and a drying finish. Very drinkable ipa, could session this one without much trouble. Really enjoyed the decent amount of pure bitterness. Thanks Scott for the opportunity."
"Blind Pig pours a beautiful orange color with a huge, strong white head with lots of sticking and visible carbonation. The nose is super fresh and citrusy hop heaven, amazing. Its truly making my mouth water. Upon tasting my initial thought is, wow, what a unique IPA! Very well balanced at first, perfect hop flavor, lots of grapefruit, lemon, orange and pepper notes. The after taste is of sweet hops balanced by light malts. Medium bodied with an excellent level of carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, i cant wait to get my hands on some more of this!"
"Bottle, thanks Dr. Bill! Light golden color with a wispy foam that lasts well. Very nice nose, which is dominated by very bright woodsy hops, with other light notes of resin and lemon from the hops. Flavor hoppiness and bitterness is very bold and impressive, and lingers in the finish very well. The hops are raw, pure, well utilized and again, they linger well after the swallow. Flavor hops are similar to the nose and can best be described as very woodsy. A minor critique, it doesn't have a lot of body, but the finish makes up for it. Overall, really nice IPA."
"(Come to think of it, they should have named this Manbearpig. I'm super cereal. Alright, excelsior!)"
"I tried this on-tap at RR Brewery a couple of years ago, but was not as impressed as I am by the bottled version. All in all, I am amazed at the depth and complexity of such a low alcohol beer. It has the flavor to be a 7 to 8% beer."
"D-Lingering bitterness took away from drinkability for me but overall fantastic brew and would seek out again."
"Bottom line: I'm pretty darned happy that I picked this brew up and I enjoyed the bottle I drank immensely. Now, I look forward to *trying* to get some Pliny The Elder. RR really does have it all going on...."
"Pours a fogged gold amber with a creme head. Soapy, hoppy nose. Sharp floral and citrus tones. I got a lot on the flavor. Earth, smoke, citrus, floral, and soapy hops. Real thick earthy character mostly. Feel is low on carbonation and the liquid is fine. Pretty easy to drink and an overall earthy IPA."
"First off...let me just say I really wanted to like ""the Pig."" But, despite its catchy name and highly reputable maker (Russian River Brewing Company), it left much to be desired. Too hoppy for my simple palate. Kinda overpowered my other senses."
"d: a really great refreshing bouquet of hops and a refreshing beer"
"Glad we've finally got this in bottles!"
"If I had to blindly run around a sty and wrestle a greased pig for another one of these beers i'd do it. Fortunately I can just buy one."
"Drinkability is high, great flavor and body for a single IPA at 6%, solid throughout, no glaring shortcomings for this style, definitely a favorite and repeat performer, this ranks on my short list of top single IPAs"
"A very hoppy, medium bodied IPA with ultra drinkability for the hot weather months ahead."
"On tap at the Liar's Club. A very well made IPA. Supposedly was the granddaddy to the Plineys, Elder and Youngers. Personally I like the grandkids better. This was a good beer but lighter in body then the others with not a totally right balance of hops. Was good and drinkable, just not as good as some others. golden color, not much head, very citrusy hops."
"On tap at O'Briens. Hazy gold color with a thick white head. Aroma of grapefruit and pine at first with some lemon and resin as it warms up. Very hoppy and smooth with a nice dry finish. Extremely refreshing. I could drink this beer all day. An amazing West Coast IPA."
"Incredible initial aroma, not as thick as I prefer an IPA to be but that's about the only complaint. Incredibly drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability> Easy. I've had several since this tasting."
"Great mouthfeel (Russian River knows what the *bleep* they're doing), and it must be pretty drinkable, considering I pounded the growler in one night."
"From growler shipped to me (6 days old when opened): Golden in color with a touch of amber. This still poured a great 3/4"" head that dissipated slowly. The nose was filled with grapefruit, Rouquefort cheese and a touch of anise. In the mouth it had medium density, a smooth texture and was wonderfully balanced. The hops are very well balanced by some malt that leads to a beer with a bitterness/dryness but also a touch of sweetness. The malt is more noticable than the ""Pliny the Elder"" and keeps this beer a touch sweeter. Overall, this is a really well made beer with terrific balance that is easy to drink."
"Excellent IPA, right up there with the best of them. Edged out a little by some others, but one I wouldn't hesitate to drink again and again and again..."
"D - definitely an easy one to drink if you like hoppy ipa's. i could have a few of these for sure and then want it again the next day."
"Mouthfeel is dry and briskly carbonated; it's on the lighter side, but just heavy enough to be satisfying. The mouthfeel makes it a very easy drinker."
"Drinkability- What a terrific IPA. I drank a lot of DIPA's this weekend and am pretty sure this was the only regular IPA I had. That being said, I'd probably take two glasses of this over any DIPA I had (except for Racer X). Supremely fruity and supremely balanced while still letting the hops shine. Great beer that I highly recommend!"
"D - Definite winner. Great job Vinny (brewer)."
"Drinkability was good... I could have gone for a pint of this rather than the 2 ounce sample. However, I don't know if I could take more than a bomber of this stuff in one sitting."
"On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco. Wasp-colored yellow with watery lacing. Reserved hop odor, some cold grapefruit. Astringent grapefruit bitterness, very bitter and dry. Citrusy and mildly one-dimensional, though the malt is enough to support the hops, which is always good. Some sweet lemon. Medium bodied. Overall, its an aggresive beer, but a little bit of a one trick pony. Despite not having anything amazing to say about this beer, however, I have to admit i drank it swiftly and with gusto. So high marks for drinkability."
"smooth mouth feel with an unassuming carbonation and a brisk hoppiness that manages not to overwhelm. some sweet malt backing against a fresh green piney bitterness, with the citrus notes slightly more muted in the flavor than in the aroma. flavorful with a light, drinkable feel."
"Overall drinkability is excellent! For a brewery that's been focusing on wild sour ales and over-the-top hop bombs, I belive Vinnie presents his most tradtional and most balanced beer here, while maintaining his envelope pushing tendencies."
"BP IPA pours golden in color and clear with a thick, white, long lasting head. Has strong, spicy hops in the nose along with complex fruit and esters - very nice. Flavor is all about the hops and shows great hop complexity. Spicy, tangy, bitter and flavorful; with solid malt and fruit elements to back it up. An excellent beer, among the best of the great American IPA's, definitely worth seeking."
"Served on draft at the Toronado. Light amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is all wicked strong grapefruit. The flavor is much the same; big grapefruit flavor with backing malt and good bitterness. Medium body that seems more alcoholic than it is. All around a classic big west coast IPA."
"This is a pretty unassuming beer; no fancy tap handle, not a lot of hype surrounding it, no extreme ABV. Nonetheless, the more I drink it, the more impressed I am. The nose is fresh and fragrant, full of pine and grapefruit. The taste mirrors the nose, with an exceptionally rich, fresh, piney hop flavor. An underlying caramel sweetness is present, coming through right before the finish, giving it balance. The aftertaste is long, leaving a slight oily bitterness, but without any astringency. Quite possibly the best IPA around."
"Pours an orange color with a frothy white head that builds up in my new Sam Adams glass (thanks franksnbeans). Lacing is left along the side of the glass the entire time. Smell is of herbs, earthy grass, pine and citrus. Smells like a christmas tree with grapefruit ornaments. Taste is light sweetness of the citrus followed by a moderate bitter finish. Mouthfeeling is crisp and a little oily with some lively carbonation."
"Pours a clear burned orange with lively carbonation and big creamy head that dies into sheets of lacing. Holy moley the smell! Smells like a bag of the world finest reefer! Or big juicy piney hops! Taste is nothing but the finest hops, so juicy, so piney, so delicious! A little malty balance to make this a masterpiece. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation and an awesome bitter hop finish. Sessionable? I wish I had this on demand to session. Honestly the best IPA I've had to date."
"D- This beer was very drinkable. It did seem to me that it was stronger than 6 percent but none the less it went down fairly easy."
"Had on tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Pours golden with some orange highlights- somehat lighter in color than many ipas. Healthy white head that sticks around some. Nice piney hoppiness in the nose with a hint of orange. You can smell the bitterness and tell this is going to be good. Small amount of dry malt in the background. Wow! Super hoppy beer, with lots of sticky resin. Big pine taste with some lesser citrus notes, especially orange, for balance. Much hoppier than most other ipas I've had and absolutely delicious. Long, lingering bitterness. I wouldn't exactly call this balanced, but it does have some malt backbone for support. Its just that the hop attack is so relentless that the malt gets a little overwhelmed. Who cares, its great. Mouthfeel is perfect as well. Good body, perfect level of carbonation, and ends with a spicy creaminess. Love this beer, but it definitely burns the tastebuds out a bit. Use in moderation. I'd buy this in a second if it was bottled and in my area."
"Highest recommended IPA I have tasted in my beer drinking days"
"D: Great drinkability, one of the best IPAs I've ever had, great sessionability even at 6.0%, Russian River strikes again, making another great IPA for the hophead's enjoyment."
"Drinkability? Yes, I have the ability to drink some more. Goes down great with some Arrogant Almonds!"
"Had a fresh bottle 4 year later, good and smooth though not as amazing as that growler."
"This pig pours a clear dark golden hue with a one finger fluffy white head that leaves a thin layer throughout. Stickiness is damn good, just what I expected for this brewery. Smell is a sweet fresh piney hop burst with a nice earthy/dirty hop undertone. Nice caramel malt scent is mixed in quite well with the gritty hops. Taste is of big earthy hops, just how I like my IPA's. Has a very nice bittering effect on the tongue, but not over-powering. Sweet grapefruit hops seem to surface about midway through with a nice caramel malt balance as well. Aftertaste is somewhat dry, but very clean. In my opinion, perfect tasting IPA. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Such a treat on tap. I could easily put these down one after another. By far one of the best IPA's I've had to date, and I've had a couple ;)"
"Smooth, good carbonation, extremely drinkable. Russian River really can't do any wrong."
"Ranks right up there with AleSmith, Stone IPA, and Furious on my IPA scale (and judging from the rankings, most everyone else's scale too)"
"In the flavour, the balance definitely leans towards the hops. Grapefruit citric acidity becomes extremely piney with a lot of aniseed and fennel backed up by a light crackery malt and just a little bit of vanilla as well. This beer bites real hard. Medium carbonation, sticky as hell, Dry, Dry, Dry. Very drinkable but dosen't pretend to be balanced, it's just a hop bomb. An exceptionally flavoured IPA though."
"Spectacular IPA by RRBC. This beer definitely deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the Plinys."
"Incredibly drinkable and dangerously addictive."
"Had a pint of this at the brewpub while I picking up a Growler of Pliny . Aroma of citrus hops and a nice dark golden color and a small pub style head and thin lacing. Mouthfeel was delightful and very crisp and refreshing. Flavor was of various citrus and fruits such as orange and apricot. Good long bitter and dry finish. A very good IPA, ranking up there with the very best. A hopheads delight."
"If Furious is G.W.A.R.'s version of an IPA, then this is J.S. Bach's. But then that would make Hop Devil the Beatles and Dreadnaught would be Led Zeppelin. Highly highly recommended to everyone. VInnie has a subtle touch that makes bold statements. This is art in a glass. Cheers!"
"If I did not love Pliny the Elder so much I would have this more often. One of the best IPAs ever made."
"D: This rates very high on the drinkability scale. It's well balanced, goes down smooth, finishes crisp and refreshing. I highly recommend this brew, especially for IPA lovers such as myself. Is it the best IPA that I've ever tasted? Maybe, a side-by-side tasting would do better to answer that question. I know it's certainly in the discussion."
" The body’s just a little bit weak, but that’s undoubtedly due to its age. In spite of this, though, the beer is still an immensely drinkable treat."
"Mouthfeel is clean/crisp and perfect. This is the perfect session beer. Absolutely perfect!"
"On tap at the Toronado. What more can you say? Its the grandpappy of IPAs. Pours a nice, somewhat hazy orange with a surprisingly light, thin head. Big piney and grapefruit hops waft from the glass, so you know what youre in for. The hops take over your first sip and really show no mercy to the malt in the background. A bit unbalanced. This is straight up, O.G. West Coast IPA style. Lots of grapefruit and pinestraw. Good body with a clean, crisp and pretty dry finish. IPAs have come a long way since Vinnie first brewed this in the mid-90s, but this still holds court with the better ones of today. Cheers to a legend."
"D- This is the best IPA I have ever had. It may be even close to the best beer I have ever had. I would like to have it side by side with some other favorites and see if this one would come through (I believe it would come out VERY close to #1 if not #1. I would give this beer a 4.999 if I could but of course you can't."
"Drinkability is top notch. This is an exceptional IPA. But what else would you expect from Russian River?"
"Nice medium level of body and carbonation. In spite of the big hop bite and lack of any real sign of balance its tasty for the beer drinker who enjoys hops. Bitter but still refreshing on a sunny afternoon."
"I had this one on tap at RR on Saturday and actually preferred it to the Russian River IPA and Pliny the Elder. Drank from a pint. Appearance is similar to their other IPA's, hazy yellow amber with some gold and some darker reddish hues. No head thanks to the Neanderthal behind the bar. Smells of cascade and a bouquet of floral and piney hops. Taste was excellent. A wonderfully rich combination of bitter pine, fruity hop, and some mouth-watering candy sweetness. It was similar to Pliny but had a rich backbone of fruity syrup that made it stand out. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent as with all RR beers. This was definitely one of the best IPA's I've tried lately."
"Maybe the location and company influence my new-found love affair with this nectar, but I don't care, I love it, and I'm not going to question my feelings! As good as it smelled, I had no idea the flavor would come across as exceptional as it did. In fact, this beer would be, far and away, my top session IPA were it not so freaking rare in my area. It's so clean that having another is an animal instinct. I almost never have two of the same when I'm at Monk's, but this specimen became one of the rare exceptions. Should I ever get near this again, I really doubt I'll drink anything but Blind Pig. Until it's gone, or I'm gone."
"Flavors of sun ripened pink grapefruit fill your mouth as if a wedge was squeezed on your tongue. Bold citrus with a tad of sweetness just dominate and play in your mouth. Very quenching and bold. Light medium bodied and crisp on the tongue. I could just drink this everyday."
"I had the beer at the brewery. I'm from the bay area, but live in San Diego. The brew pub was a cool place and the food was good too. I had a few beers and blind pig was the my third favorite behind Perdition and Damnation. Blind Pig was an easy beer to drink. I thought it was smooth and full of flavor.Though I am new at being a beer nerd, my taste is more for a seasoned vet. I never enjoyed y yellow macro brews but still drank the more popular dark beers everyone had. Russian River is by far my favorite brewery and they don't have a beer I don't dislike. Blind Pig was not as strong as the other beers I had but I think I drank it faster than the others that I liked more than it."
"This is a reasonably solid beer, but a little rough on the edges for me. Pliny (the Elder and Younger) are both superior offerings from RR in my opinion. Still, grab a pint when you see it on tap. This beer's relatively rare."
"Medium body and great mouthfeel, leaves clean with enough taste residue to want more."
"Pours a deep golden orange color with a thick off-white head that recedes into a sticky lace. Spicy hops dominate the nose with strong aromas of fresh pine and even a bit of lemon grass. Hops are, of course, also the key players in the taste with notes of fresh pine, juicy citrus, and grapefruit rind. Definitely on the bitter side, but there is some sweet malt to help provide some balance. A must-try for the hop-heads."
"Light amber, white head. Aroma is all hops, this is a very hoppy IPA, pine, citrus, etc. Tastes like a strong IPA, big hops out front, followed by some bitterness, with the malt in the background. Nice light crisp texture, very drinkable. This beer exists in the no-man's land between IPA and double IPA. Well put together in all respects."
"Cheers!"
"A really good IPA, I had it side-by-side with 4 other IPA's at Russian River. I think this is the last best (they're all good so none is really worst)."
"On tap at Toronado. Tasted side-by-side a pint of the Elder. My first impression is shock that this IPA has considerably more about juniper/pine than the 2xIPA from the same brewer. This beers aroma is intense, painful even. My tongue is freaking out as if I were about to dip it into a vat of citric acid. The juniper in this aroma is just plain ferocious. Inhaling Blind Pig is like having a bully grind your face into a juniper bush on the playground. My eyes are starting to water. Taste is more about sensation then flavor. It stings, it burns, it pricks, it bites, it kicks, and it growls. Beyond that and the thick pine oils I can taste pineapple and apricot but thats about it (I dont mind one but. This rocks). Finish is light, dry, and citric. Body is on the lighter side of medium. Appearance is similar to Plinny the Elder, just a tad lighter shade of golden amber leaning toward yellow with a thinner, shorter lived white head. Outstanding IPA, not for the faint of heart or hops. Just damned adventurous."
"Highly recommended, this may become a great session beer... where are the bottles?"
"I had this beer on tap at Russian River in Santa Rosa. It poured a light copper almost gold very clear, with a light white head. I was pleasantly surprised how light in color this beer was. Big hop nose, grapefruit pine a little floral hop. You cant really detect the malt in the aroma. Taste has a lot of the grapefruit rind. The pine and hop flower, I caught in the aroma were present as well. This beer really presents all of the hop characters well. It has a light sweetness that lingers throughout. Slick mouth feel Good drinkability. The great brewers seem to be able to deliver a hoppy beer that is still palatable."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and surprisingly flavorful for a 6% beer; exceedingly drinkable fruity IPA"
"I think this beer would make a good session beer. It is only about 6% alcohol, so that shouldnt be a problem. Also, the flavor is great, and not too aggressive. I know that I will have a few more of there in my day."
"Hand filled 22 oz bomber using counter pressure filler. The beer pours a nice orange color with copper highlites. Clarity is awesome. A light slightly off-white head sits over top, with a very nice cascade of bubbles keeping things solid over top. Aroma on this one is great. Very solid chunky candied grapefruity sweet hop with a moderate caramel and light spun sugar sweetness in there. Everything about it is sweet. Flavor is nice as well. Hop flavors are dominant, with the same sweet grapefruity citrus, with a light touch of pepperyness over a soild sweet caramel malt base. A few moments after swallowing the beer, a very clean bitterness hangs on the side of my tougue. This one is very much like a baby brother to the PtY. It has all the flavors and aromas of the big boy, but just to a lesser degree. Very tasty and very well balanced between sweet malt, hop flavor, and hop bitterness. The feel is a solid moderate with a very solid carbonation of fine bubbles to keep it from being too thick. As far as I'm concerned, this is another home run. All the flavors play very well with each other, the nose is really full and enticing. This 22 oz bottle is not going to last very long and is going to get me one step closer to planning that trip to California. Awesome."
"I have no right to be critical of RedwoodGeorge since he's responsible for sending me some of the best beers on the planet Earth. That said, here's my beef. It isn't that he didn't make this bottle a bomber like the rest, it's that he didn't send me the whole damn keg of Blind Pig. Does everything that Mr. Cilurzo touches turn to brewing gold?"
"Goes down so easy...this would be my go to beer if I lived near RR...love the bigger beers, but I'd never be disappointed with what this brew has to offer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" off-white head over the almost clear dark golden brew. Frothy head fades gently, with bits of lace here and there. Aroma is super-duper piney hops, with some light fruitiness, and an inkling of sweetness underneath it all. Flavor is what the nose indicated, lots of hops, but just enough malt to take the edge off, with a nice cuttingly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, especially for as hoppy as it is, and drinkability is also very acceptable. Another great offering from ""George's Unauthorized Home Bottling Project""."
"Thanks to Redwood George for shipping this to me!"
"Tunes: edIT - ashtray"
"The third offering in a continuum of Russian River IPAs bottled unofficially by BA RedwoodGeorge from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers, the beer came out paler than the two bigger Plinys but had a little more carbonation, and a bigger head. The aroma was much milder than I had anticipated, with a floral-citric hop smell vaguely reminiscent of Mangos. The taste was citric, sugary, and a little soapy. Body was light and airy, and the hops faded quickly after each sip. Like the rest of Russian River IPAs, this was lighter in body than the strength on the label suggested. Unlike the bigger beers, the lightness of the body had a slightly detrimental effect on the single IPA, where more character is usually better than less. An easy to drink beer, that left me wishing it was a little less simple."
"Drinkability is good one big nice hoppy IPA not much balance but then again hop heads don't need balance. I personally don't see how Vinnie sells anything else when the Younger is on tap, thanks again for all the hard work George."
"this is the first r.r. ipa i've had the pleasure to enjoy, and i hope im not blowing my load on the first date... but i think this stuff is just amazing. carefully just shy of being west coast overdone but still unique enough to be notable. thanks again, g."
"A nice drinkable IPA here that is strong but not too over the top. This here is a beer that shows West Coast hops in all their glory. But to be honest this is a rather strong beer that probably will shock many and delight all the hopheads. If you are not a hop head drink 3-4 of these and you will be!"
"This beer poured a lightish amber, head retention was good and lacing was good as well. aroma was of piney hops, subtle but there. Taste was very piney, a real grabber, hop head delight, say what you will, just plain hoppy and aggressive. A very drinkable and enjoyable IPA. Another testament to Vinnies skills as a brewer. Good stuff"
"The beer poured a nice yellow/golden color with a bright white head that laced around the glass. the aroma of this beer has a very strong hoppy smell with a balance of citrus. Very pleasing. The taste had a nice balance between the bitter hops and the sweeter malt and citrus balance. There was a nice amount of carbonation in the Bling Pig which I really enjoy. The is a very drinkable beer and a very good example of an IPA."
"*Highly Recommended*."
"Comments: Whenever I go to the Toronado, I order at least one of these. One of my favorite IPAs. Extremely enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable as long as you like hopped the hell out beers. Taste buds will be gone after a couple of pints of this. Congrats Vinnie... you did it again!"
"On tap at the brewpub in Santa Rosa in an imperial pint glass. Pours a rather unspectacular, clear copper/amber body, with a thin white head, little lacing. Huge pine, citrus aromas in the nose. Spicy, fruity and floral. Amazing taste - just a superb IPA. A huge amount of bitterness in the finish. Moderate bodied and full of flavour. A great beer."
"...huge thanks to IrishSnake for the growler!"
"overall an excellent ale of a style I personally enjoy"
"A darker orange than the regular IPA at RR this is a recipe that Vinnie revived from one of his first brewpub jaunts at Blind Pig. The aromas are complex. Spicy/piney hops and a lovely complex maltiness that really holdss all of the hoppiness together and makes this brew stick like glue. The taste is hoppy and spicy with some lovely bready notes, and some great piney spiciness from the hops is there as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit fuller than that of the regular IPA and the drinkability is damn good as well. This and the regular RR IPA are twins and they are 4.5 twins as well. Damn good job on these two IPA's Vinnie, damn good job..."
"This is good; I like it more than the regular Russian River IPA."
"It's hard to declare this one of Russian River's ""best brews"" because they're all so good but this was such a delight that I'll be keeping an eye out for its return. While most of their IPAs (Beerocracy, Parking Violation, RR IPA) seem to be related to Pliny the Elder with strong grapefruit citrusy notes, this brew appears to be more closely related to the ambrosia-like Pliny the Younger with a sweet note complimenting a more subdued citrus flavor. This one's a keeper and I'm glad Vinnie brought the recipe out of the vault!"
