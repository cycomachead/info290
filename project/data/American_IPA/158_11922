It is a fine brew to pickup at a Walmart where I've seen it to be one of the better craft brews in there selection. If it was between this and sweet water iPa for instance, I'd reach for the Titan.","Kyseber","Wednesday at 08:15 AM"

The best part is the crisp clean slightly over carbonated mouth feel. I feel the hops are too weak making the malts more prevalent. Overall i enjoyed this brew, but i would never take it over a rhinegeist or madtree IPA or any ohio IPA for that fact.","Ohiolager","Mar 30, 2015"

It's still a wee bit hoppier than I like, so I don't go out of my way to get it, but every once in a while I could see having one of these.

This beer boasts of balance between ""...rich malty sweetness...."" and ""crisp hop bitterness"". And they lied. To all of us. The maltiness wildly savages the hopiness, leaving an overly sweet flavor on the palate. Its relatively high alcohol content makes it difficult to choke down. I'm sad I bought a six pack, I'm going to have to donate it to to the local AA chapter.","ronskrnkn","Aug 19, 2014"

Clear, orange, not a lot of head which disappeared fairly quickly. It didn't have a lot of smell but what there was smelled nice. A little pine and fruit. It had a much better taste with plenty of hops but enough malty sweetness to make it a fairly smooth and refreshing drink. The ABV was enough to take the edge off the godawful baseball game that followed, too.","MarkGamber","Aug 15, 2014"

The beer has a nice amber color with a smaller foamy head when poured and smells great. Not too overpowering with a pine scent like most IPAs have. My first sip I was very surprised. I was hit with a slight bite of citrusy hops which mellowed out with toasty malts. Its truly crafted wonderfully. I can tell this beer was greatly inspired by English Style IPAs.

This reminds me of when I've had extremely fresh Ithaca Flower Power and after one month the flower faded or actually increased in maltiness. I'm believing Titan fresh is the bomb but after a short time this bomb turns into a dud. I want a fresher batch and will buy when I see.

It was rather faint and didn't have any real freshness or punch of pine and/or citrus. Taste-wise, it was very respectable with a nice balance of malt body and subtle sweetness nicely mingling with a bold yet not over-dominating hop bitterness. I'd certainly have another one if only to see if a fresher version delivers on the rather stellar BA reviews. My sample didn't reach those heights, but I imagine sampling a fresher batch may fall more in line with the opinions of other reviewers.","beergoot","May 07, 2014"

Located in downtown Denver, the tap room is a little bit of a step up from other taprooms i visited while in Denver. The neighborhood looks a little seedy, but the place serves some great beer. i would recommend visiting wholeheartedly. as with any great beer place, it was crowded around the 5pm hour. pints could be bought for $6. i chose to buy the samplers at 3 for $3. i could easily have had a pint of each beer i tasted.","abaer123","Apr 10, 2014"

I enjoyed this at some random Marriott hotel bar on the city limits of Denver. It's a very good IPA, but maybe a touch overrated. Strong and floral hops smell and taste. Slight touch of citrus. One of the best things about this beer is its appearance, the dark golden color and perfect head can definitely cause some vertical displacement. Checks all the boxes of what you'd want in a good IPA, but there's nothing all that special here.","MarkQ617","May 06, 2013"

Poured a cloudy amber with a big creamy white head that lingers on and leaves nice lacing. Aroma has mellowed out and is much maltier, with subtle floral and citrus notes. The taste is very much similar with the malt and hops blended with a nice bitter hop hit on the finish. and now reminds me more of an English IPA than an American. It's still quite good and if my memory serves, the newer iteration is always delicious, as well. I'm happy to know that I can cellar it to get a more English-style or drink it right away to get an excellent American-style IPA. It's win-win.","delta490","Apr 14, 2013"

There is a lot more complexity to this beer than most within the IPA style. It also finds a way to remain quaffable despite the 7.1% abv and noticeable alcohol contribution. It seems to have lost a step now that the IPA category has become perhaps the most competitive beer style, but it's still better than most. Still a must-drink.","ryan1788a5","Jan 14, 2013"

Taste follows the nose basically. Hops provide a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is kind of thin with a bit of an aftertaste. Not a bad IPA, but not the best one ever brewed either.","Mojo","Dec 06, 2012"

The taste is in the reverse nose order in my opinion. Hops followed by the malts in the back. The mouthfeel is moderate. Overall it's true to the IPA tradition. Not the best I've had but certainly enjoyable and will have again.","TheSeeker61","Aug 30, 2012"

Aroma of big grapefruits, some strong caramel malts, a hint of other tropical fruits. Flavor follows with the standard grapefruit-malt combination, not overly bitter. Fruity and slick, medium carbonation. Overall a solid beer, but nothing particularly exciting. Done right, would drink again, won't seek out again (not that it is difficult to find).","BMMillsy","Aug 30, 2012"

It did, however, lose some points for the excess bitterness and booziness, especially at the finishing follow through on the taste.

The first taste is wonderful, but the burnt sugar aftertaste is something I don't care for. It's unique in it's entirety, and especially as a west coast IPA.

Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hops. Taste is of citrus zest and herbal hops up front with a malt finish and an alcohol kick with each sip. There is also a slight vegetal presence that comes out as the beer warms. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not as good as I was expecting.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 17, 2012"

Essentially it's a very malty IPA so for those who don't typically like IPAs then I'd say this is a good one for you to try. The smell was also very malty which was kinda surprising given that it says ""aggressively hopped"" beer. Usually if it's got a lot of hops then you can smell it right away. I'd say it falls a bit short if this is supposed to be an IPA. I'd say this tastes more like a very malty pale ale rather than an IPA. The lines between IPAs and APAs are very blurred in the market anyway. So if you really like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale I doubt you'd think this was a true IPA. That being said, I really like this beer even though it's barely an IPA.","beck2008","Apr 04, 2012"

Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution off the pour. Head is a loose, half inch, cream-colored and gradually recedes into a consistent frothy slick. Swaths and spots of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose is somewhat bready to start, followed by citrus notes and candied fruits. Taste follows nose - backbone is fairly malty, candied fruit is a bit more subdued and there's a slight, easy bitterness that follows. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, I really like this beer. It is not an outstanding IPA and certainly not a hop bomb, but I really like the balance and the malt forward nature of this brew.","Jwale73","Mar 05, 2012"

Lots of carbonation is visible in the body as the body is relatively transparent. Smell is of malt and earthy hops.

4.08,0.2,4,3.5,4,5,4.5,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a white head that nicely laces the glass. Aromas are hop-forward, with a lot of citrus, unripened pineapple, and floral notes, but all more subdued than those of my favorite IPAs. Raw impressions from the first sip: this beer has a good taste, outstanding texture, and great drinkability. It's hoppy but doesn't club you over the head with bitterness. A light caramel and sourdough maltiness helps balance the sweet to bitter ratio. Finishes dry, with a lot of orange peel lingering. Has a smooth feel, with ultra fine carbonation that delivers a firestorm of sensory delights with even the smallest sips. Drinks very well all on its own, and goes well with all sorts of pub grub and garlicky dishes.","droomyster","Oct 30, 2011"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a sort of middle-of-the-road AIPA that's very well executed. Not extreme or overtly bitter; easy to drink, booze totally hidden; the maltiness isn't excessive but it's definitely more prominent than many other contemporary examples.","tobelerone","Oct 30, 2011"

3.94,-3.2,3,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden amber color with about a centimeter of off-white, fluffy head. It takes its time settling down, and leaves a considerable amount of bubbly lacing behind. Smells of bready, biscuity malts, some piney hops, a touch of caramel malt, and faint spice. Taste begins with some spicy, partially bitter hops, moves into some significant bread and grain notes, and finishes with a smooth caramel texture. There is a flashback of the hops on the exhale, and you’re reminded this is indeed an IPA and not an amber or pale ale. Mouth is bitter, but not overbearingly so, and the finish is smooth and a touch dry. Overall, a solid albiet different IPA that I’d be happy to have again.","eclipse54","Aug 08, 2011"

No, but will I buy again? No. Everyone should try it as it is well made quality wise but its just too sweet for me.","Lightbearer2012","Jul 23, 2011"
3.72,-8.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall impression: A nice, malty American IPA. I expected more hop aroma and flavor.

4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Appearance is copper - a bit darker than your typical IPA - with a nicely sized head that fades after a few minutes. A fair amount of lacing is left on the glass. Scents come through strongly and are typical for an IPA - a nice fruit cocktail smell of grapefruit and ripe pear. The taste is not as powerfully hoppy as many other IPAs - malts are definitely noticeable, but they do take a backseat to the hops. Malts provide a slight caramel taste in the background, while citrusy hop flavors dominate. Bitterness really isn't very strong; more of a tartness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, almost creamy. A very nicely balanced and tasty IPA.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jul 14, 2011"
4.48,10.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: I was truly surprised by this beer, I had no idea it would be this good. The liquor store I work at only has the hercules DIPA which I haven't tried yet (since it's super expensive), but having tried this one, it's definitely going to be my next purchase.

Mouth feel is good medium with good carbonation, a little creamy. The taste is very good some pine hops, a little maltiness on the way down with a nice bitter hop after flavor.

Taste of fairly strong grapefruit, orange, and pine; with some caramel in the background. Sweet tastes on the front that lead to a fairly strong bitterness on the finish that lingers for a bit with citrus and pine flavors. Very smooth drinkability for it’s alcohol level.

The taste was not what I was hoping....I think the bottle I had may have been over primed, but I have certainly had better IPAs...and I was really hoping this was going to be good.

Needless to say that besides the price-tag, the Titan did its job. The taste of this beer is one of a sweet-bitter nature, not exactly what i prefer but very pleasant. I am more for a beer with a sweet taste and a salty after tone, Titan definitely leaves the mouth with a bitter aftertaste with no salt what so ever. This beer extremely sweet and almost overpowering, it was so ridden with sugar that the reminiscent foam on the inside of my pilsner glass stuck until washed. In afterthought this sweetness was nice, and I was tipsy after 2 beers, and drunk after 4... Purchase this beer if you have the chance, I have no regrets.","Bamabadass","Feb 12, 2011"

4.5,10.6,5,5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a vibrant and clear amber-brown, with a steady flow of carbonation, yet no head. The beer has stong and heavy aromas of pine, hops, and a sweet citrus balance. The beer has a heavy bitter hops flavor, with sweet foundations to balance. Slight grapefruit highlights that linger through to the aftertaste. Sharp and peppery flavors also present in the taste, which help trasition to a quick and smooth finish. Left to sit for a while, the beer takes on some slight floral flavors that will fill the palate and your sinuses. The beer is round and full in mouth, and a bit on the bold side with the full flavors, but very tasty. This beer has strong flavors and hop characteristics that make it a great sipper, but not sure if I could handle more than one or two in a sitting.","GarthDanielson","Feb 08, 2011"

The Titan presents a fine aroma, and an acceptable head. It's that nice consistent hop flavor finished off by a subtle malt sweetness that takes this IPA to the head of the class.

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a crystal clear orange color with a two finger stark white head which resedes slowly and gives way to nice lacing. The aroma is of earthy and piney hops along with a hint of citrus. The taste is much of the same, a big up front pine and earth hop characteristic followed up by a nice slight citrus taste. The malt is hidden. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall for the abv it is an easy drink, it isn't bitter for the sake of bitter, but bitter due to the hop flavor. The hop taste is nice enough to keep you wanting more.","goblue3509","Jan 17, 2011"

First sip I noticed some citrus notes which was nice and then I notice the hops but it's not a hop bomb. Very smooth and very balanced.

Extremely drinkable and worth every sip in regards to value. This is my 1st time purchasing a case and third time drinking out of a bottle and I rank this in my top 5 of American IPA's due to it's unbelievable attention to quality, crispness, and flavor that ranks up with Victory Hop Devil and Bell's Two Hearted Ale.

Scent is lovely with strong grapefruit aromas and sweet candy and even a bit of green apple. Hops are present in the aroma, but more sweet than hoppy. Taste is initially hoppy with great caramel flavors followed by grapefruit and citrus notes. Delicious beer! It end with some piney notes and hob bitterness.

4.82,18.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Poured a nice clear copper color with a decent head and medium carbonation from a 12 oz bottle with ABV and 'date of bottling' on the label. Aroma is predominantly hoppy with hints of sweetness, fruity esters and malts. Outstanding taste, a perfect blend of hops and malts, exquisite on the palate. This is IMHO one of the best IPA's around. The taste gets better as the beer warms up, with the oily pine flavor gelling perfectly with the sweet and malty aftertaste. Very good lacing along the walls of my glass. This is a perfectly balanced IPA and one has to indulge carefully, because this is definitely a highly drinkable beer. To reiterate, Titan IPA is hands down one of the best beers from Great Divide and truly a very delicious and fulfilling IPA. Highly, highly recommended.","CaptDavyJones","Dec 13, 2010"

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured an amber brown with orange highlights that had a thin head but it did leave nice frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was nice for an IPA which consisted of hops, citrus, slight grassy notes, and a good sweet malt presence. The taste upfront had a good nice hoppy grassy piney punch with citrus accents and some sweetness from the malts to help balance out the hoppy kick. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which has a citric, earthy, hoppy bitter, slight sweet, and crisp finish. It drank really good and I kinda like it more on tap versus the bottle offerings; still good either way.","Gobzilla","Oct 03, 2010"

Citrus aroma with a touch or carmel, neither overly strong nor muted. Noticeable carbonation present up front. West coast hops come into play in the middle, mildly resinous and piney. Hops fade in late middle and finish and brew becomes more balanced with more caramel sweetness. Medium mouthfeel.","LittleDon","Sep 30, 2010"

Flavorful taste of hops and citrus. Good amount of bitterness as well. This is one of those IPAs that can hold their own against the better Imperial IPAs. Big hop taste, and bitterness to go with a good-sized ABV. Titan is worth seeking out, no question.","PicoPapa","Sep 29, 2010"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The smell is very piney with a yeasty fruit character that is peach or apricot like and a little bit of ethanol. The beer is properly bitter with a pine and grapefruit blast. Unlike Hercules, which is very pineapple-y and fruit from hops, this is more assertive and masculine (if you can attribute that quality to beer). The first swallow renders your tongue dry from bitterness that stays to the end. As it subsides, the sweetness from the biscuity malt comes through. The mouthfeel is full and slick, and it was easy to drink.","Soonami","Sep 26, 2010"

A slight sweetness starts on the tongue, but it is soon overpowered by the hops. The finish is very crisp, but the bitterness hangs just a bit too long on the tongue.

There is a great copper color and a big head of white foam. I can see bubbles rising within the crystal clear beer. Near perfect lacing has been left as the head settles. The Titan IPA has a sweet, piney aroma. It's a very good hop scent for a bottle that's nearly nine months old. The flavor doesn't hold up with age as well. There is still some bitterness, but it's not too pronounced. The graham cracker malts are more prominent at first. The aftertaste tastes like it could be very hoppy and bitter, but no longer is. The beer still tastes good, just not incredible. The beer has a heavier-than-medium body and some noticeable carbonation. It drinks fairly well, but I certainly wouldn't recommend holding on to a bottle as long as I have. I wish I had reviewed this beer when I tasted it fresh, it was much better than.

4.25,4.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5," Titan is a remarkably good looking ale. Golden amber the lightest of tan head. The perfect amount of lacing left behind as the head slowly dies. A thin cap remains and appears to be here for the long haul. Aromas of earthy and piney hops are strong in the nose and punch through on the taste as well. This IPA has quite a complex taste... bitter hops dirty with pine a slight citrus side notes and a grassy finish. There is a malt presence slight but undoubtedly welcome, and perfectly balanced. Among the multitude of hops a layered taste from all angles grips the pallet from sip to swallow. An interesting IPA that begs to be gulped and that you pour another too bad the ABV says your old and it is a week night.","llllDrGONZOllll","Mar 10, 2010"

The beer poured a large fluffy off-white head that left a nice even lace all around the glass. The beer is a very crisp amber color with a basic juicy IPA scent. Pine hops and citrus notes are the most noticeable in this brew. A very sweet and sticky IPA. To be honest, this is one of the best IPAs I have ever tried. I put it up there with Stone IPA. Light to moderate carbonation and a nice bitter after taste make this a very drinkable IPA. If this beer was a little bit cheaper, this would be my go to IPA.

Overall, the balance between hops and malt is this beer's greatest quality making it a multiple pint candidate.","RiekerStarBrew","Oct 23, 2009"

A very citric, slightly sweet taste at first followed by a good bitter piney hops pucker. Mouthfeel was a little thinner and dryer than I like but good. Slightly oily.

Also up front are those delicious florals and citrus, with the latter seeming more like grapefruit than anything else. There's a caramel malt sweetness, but this brew is pretty fresh and has a hop profile to prove it. Good balance, though. A crisp, medium body sends this brew smoothly down.

I don't understand why Great Divide doesn't distribute to California, but this IPA would fit right in with our lineup. It's the kind of IPA with enough hops to make you feel a bit relaxed from the lupulin or humulene or whatever. The beer is fairly bitter but still well-balanced, in the sense that no off notes stick out or distract from the whole. It's a medium bitter, well-executed, West coast-leaning IPA, and that's probably the best description that I can come up with. The malt has good sweetness but doesn't get in the way of the stars of the show. The only real flaw that I can think of is that it's a bit middle of the road compared against the current field of American IPAs. That said, it's a very well done version of the middle of the road. It just doesn't have that little extra complexity or uniqueness or depth of the very best of the style.","popery","May 30, 2009"

Nice malt base gives this American IPA some semblance of balance. Has a bitter finish. Nothing spectacular about the body, feels a little thin in fact. Nice carbonation though.

The beer tastes perfect too, not overly malty like many DIPA's, but then if more breweries made IPA's this tasty then they might not feel compelled to double them. Strong hops throughout, delicious.

It feels smooth and syrupy in the mouth with a slightly sticky, slightly gritty finish. It's quite bitter-- a little top-heavy with a lot of pine in the taste. It becomes sweeter toward the finish.

Deep burnt orange color, allows you to see through it without truly being transparent, more of a rust yellow-red tinge at the rims. The nose is controlled and powerful, full of grapefruit and orange citrus, pine cone, tarry tea leaves, biscuit and pressed flowers, while undoubtedly pretty damn hoppy, it really comes off more as an integrated whole than individual scents. Which here is a good thing. Full-bodied, you can feel it expanding against your checks without the aid of excessive carbonation. The grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus obvious but the tobacco, charcoal, tar, bong resin and wet stone elements most catch your fancy. The flowers come and go with the tide. Despite a relative paucity of malt, not as bitter as expected, drinks well for its weight and overall high energy level. Most excellent.","farrago","Feb 02, 2009"

Big oily hops initially balanced big time by a sweet, slightly grainy malt backbone, to musty even still in flavor, i cant get down with the hop character that is trying to be achieved here.

Just as the looks reminded me of the likes of 90 minute IPA, the taste is also pretty big, close to a double or imperial. As the label advertises, this is certainly an aggressively-hopped ale. But there is also the solid malt backbone delivering an amazing overall taste sensation. It's delicious but not entirely unique. So it's not a perfect 5, but it's damn good. I'd get it again.

The balance makes up for the mildness, to some extent. Drinkable as hell, almost like a pale ale. Bottom line, a bit mild for an IPA, but if you think of it as a pale ale, it rocks.","PhxHorn","Nov 18, 2008"

There is lots of tangy grapefruit, oily hop esters, leafy hop notes as well, and plenty of bready and biscuity malts in the background. There is a definite puckerishness, tanginess, and slight hop bitterness to the beer that is very compelling and it balances superbly with the bready malts.

The first sip hits you with the strong hop bitterness and flavor, even for an IPA. Very well blended. Very bitter but yet is balanced out with the malty sweetness enough to make it easy to drink. A beer where a minute or so after drinking you still have that strong hop flavor in your mouth. Good job of blending the different hop varieties.

Has an acute aroma of tangy citrus hops that reach out and grab you. There's a slight bit of pine in the background. Taste is superb with the bold hop bitterness somewhat rounded by the subtle lemon, orange, and malt forming toward the end with some phenol lurking behind but never really being able to assert itself. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied with just enough crispness to keep things in balance. There is a powdery affect after a few drinks. This is a very drinkable and tasty brew with little trade-off between the two.","stephens101","Jan 04, 2008"

The smell is of grassy, juicy grapefruit hops, tropical fruit, very fresh aroma. The taste is of piney, resin, grapefruit hops. Quite insanely hopped up. If you want a truely hoppy brew without being overloaded with malt backup, this is for you. A completely one-side brew, all hops. The feel is moderate, a bit fizzy yet finishes rather smooth. I'm not a hop head at all but I do enjoy a hopped up brew every now and again. This one is primo; great hop aroma and flavor without the over the head malt hammer. The bitterness kills the drinkablility but what a great 12oz sample.","Gmann","Oct 16, 2007"

Noticeable lacing. Aroma is floral with a hint of fruit. Some caramel flavors that end up getting over powered by citrus hops on the back end. Medium body, very soft carbonation.

The smell is abundant and primarily a floral citrus grassy aroma. Full bodied, the mouth feel is well carbonated. The first mouthful is a particularly creamy experience through the well designed foam lid. The hop tingle and the matching full flavored citrus taste complement each other. There is a refined sharp finish as a grapefruit bitterness lingers slightly. A really good drinker.","jjayjaye","Sep 06, 2007"

An aftertaste of a small hop dryness that lingers for a while, and a bit sticky. A fantastic IPA, has what I am looking for, hops, yet not too overbarring.

4.26,4.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a beautifully clear and crisp orangish gold. The head builds up very nicely and stays around for a few minutes, not completely going away but fading into a full frothy cap across the top. The smell has a lot of floral hops in it, and also a distinct sweetness, similar to what I remember Ballast Point's Big Eye IPA smelling like. The taste starts out real smooth with not much flavor hitting the front end except a little mild sweetness, but its followed over the middle of the tongue by a wave of earthy, piney, and finally leafy hop character finishing in a medium bitterness and a resiny aftertaste. The whole time it has a fairly slick malt sugary body behind it, almost making you think it was a double IPA. The carbonation is very fine. I'm actually thinking I would have liked it a bit more course in this beer but it's not bad at all. This is an easy drinking and flavorful IPA for sure.","MiScusi","Aug 31, 2007"

Big, fresh, citrus hops (perhaps grapefruit) flavor. Lasting bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a little prickly from the bitterness but very refreshing. These go down easy making for good drinkability.

Really, I just feel like IPA's are a difficult style to perfect because of their prevalence in the craft beer market, thereby cutting the ability to be unique. Those that do stand out are duly recognized, but for one that does have a good drinkability, such as this one, there's not much else to distinguish it from the pack.","CharlieMopps","Jul 28, 2007"

Huge pineapple/citrus notes. I'm just getting tons of orange, pineapple and pine. Love it. Haven't had this much pineapple in the nose since the Stone 10th. Same characteristics in the taste.

Aromas of sweet orange peel, a hint of bitter chocolate and some doughy, yeasty bits. On the palate, fruity bitterness up front, then some herbal notes pop up that are a bit unusual and quite welcome in an American IPA. Quite metallic in the bitterness, especially toward the end. Big, juicy carbonation that fills the palate and thin, live-wire bitterness that has a rocky edge to it. This whole beer is filled with hard edges; there's nothing soft to the malts, hops, carbonation, nothing. In spite of that, it works. It's not a beer for everyday, but when you're looking for some good West Coast bitterness this will do the trick.","geexploitation","Jun 14, 2007"
4.35,6.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Carbonation was moderate, and mouthfeel was very good with a slightly viscuous, creamy texture. The flavor was very balanced as well. Toasted malt flavors with matching bitterness, the caramel and toasted flavors subsiding and leaving a long lasting hop finish. I've used the term ""balanced"" a couple of times, and that is my main impression of this beer. It's a refreshing change from IPA hop attacks, to a more drinkable, yet expertly crafted beer. A fantastic beer that I will purchase again (and again....).","FloridaDrinker","Jun 14, 2007"

Citrus and floral hops, but you really have to stick your nose in the glass to get it. Maybe my nose isn't working properly. The flavor is excellent. Soft, sweetish toasted malt outbalanced just a touch by juicy citrus hop bitterness. Tons of hop flavor. Clean otherwise, with no off flavors. Really resinous and orange-citrus. Full bodied, with just enough carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. Lingering citrus bitterness. Great stuff.","UnionMade","Jun 12, 2007"

4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful copper auburn color. A not very vigorous pour yielded about a good inch of thick frothy dull white head. Head somewhat quickly settled into a thin layer atop the beer. Left a decent amount of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell was of bitter citrusy hops, resiney pine aromas, fresh mowed grass, and a little bit yeasty. Taste was about the same but better. Nice and hoppy up front, pine, citrus fruits, grassy and bready. All stacked on a smooth malty backbone. Pretty well balanced. Seems to have just the right amount of carbonation. Nice and full bodied in the mouth. Lots of flavor packed into a little bottle. Pretty damn drinkable too.","jaxon53","Jun 03, 2007"

Big floral hops and very subtle sweet malt. This is spot-on for the style. Taste was juicy, resinous hops up front with plenty of bitterness and a nice biscuity malt on the finish.

Pours an attractive cloudy amber color with a medium size slightly off-white head. With a hard pour, the head actually hangs in there. Leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell gives a hint of taste to come: hops bitterness and malty aromas. Taste is good, more like an English IPA, because of the strong malt presence. Very smooth and drinkable. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Drinkability is good. Because of the higher abv, this would be a three-and-out brew for a long, long session.

4.13,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is one of the better looking IPA's that I've seen. Nice, swirling carbonation unlike any I've paid attention to. It's almost like a livid dance of bubbles when you pour this stuff. Nice, creamy head leaving plenty of lacing. Plenty of citrus and pine hops in the nose and a slight sweetness as well. I really enjoy the taste of this beer as well. A great balance of hops and malty background that is followed by a somewhat crisp/bitter hop finish. While the flavor packs a nice punch, the mouthfeel is surprisingly light to me. Plenty of carbonation when poured but it doesn't perform the same on the tongue as it does in the glass. I'm guessing a little more body would help this. Drinkability also good here. Not necessarily one of the best in my book but deserves a try for sure. In fact, if this were all I could get I wouldn't be upset by any means.","ncvbc","May 13, 2007"

3.33,-18.2,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Mouthfeel is a slightly syrupy body with really no carbonation to it. The initial head is misleading as to what to expect with the carbonation. I was starting to think I may have gotten a bad batch, but after looking over other reviews it seems this is the norm. This is pretty disappointing to me. This beer has everything else going for it. Just adding a bit of carbonation to it would give it an added crispness that I enjoy in an IPA. I will finish off the six pack, but probably won't get this again.","bort11","May 05, 2007"

The head has dissipated and now lingers about centimeter from the surface, lacing is already present. Smells lightly piney, not too aggressive, but good aromatics likely cascade, theres sort of a roundness to its scent, the flowery pine slides right into the caramaly, lightly toasted malt. Which imparts a sort of nuttiness. I also get some orageny, citrus and grapefruit. The taste is medium crisp with the bitterness coming toward the end balancing up against non-evasive malt. The bitterness seems composed of easy going grapefruit, not over tart or cloying. Of course as it warms up the malt gets sweeter and evens things out a little better, lets just say gets better as it warms. Honesty I feel like this is a good non assuming IPA great for hanging out and having a couple, with out weighing you down or slamming your palate. It doesnt knock my socks off, but thats not what it is supposed to do.

At first scent a strong malty fragrance strikes the nose, then the onslaught of ctrusy and grassy aromas come forward with the hops. The taste starts with that very sweet malt flavor, but instead of an attack of hops on your palate. It begins to blend to a citrusy, grapefruit bitterness with that malt flavor very nicely. A light to medium bodied feel, the hops at the end leave the palate with a dry finish.

Appearance is a clear, honey colored brew, with a medium off-white head. Aroma is hops, primarily grapefruit. Some malt comes through as well as a honey scent. Taste is quite hoppy, more lemon/grass than grapefruit, though. Malt is present, but consider it a supporting role. Finish has some huskiness/grain to it, as well as pepper. Mouthfeel is a medium bodied beer, with high carbonation. Alcohol warming and drying leads you on to the next sip. I enjoyed this and would have it again. Oddly enough, the hops seemed stronger in this than in Hercules, but it might just be that Hercules was better balanced.","","Sep 05, 2006"

Taste isn't the overwhelming hop bomb, though it tastes like it, but more like an unpresumptuous hoppy guy with a really, really, really nice and smooth and just so little bit enough carbonation, and, well, nice. Overall, this isn't an IPA to worship, but to drink everyday for the rest of your life. What I can't believe? 6.8%? Can't even tell.

Beautiful aroma of tangy floral hops blended with lightly sweet malt, with notes of pine and bread. Palate is dominated by an assertive, well-chosen blend of floral hops, with the bitterness offset nicely by some mellow, lightly sweet malt. Body is just about perfect - substantial and just a tad syrupy, but not too viscous to overwhelm the pleasant creaminess. An excellent west-coast IPA from a Rocky Mountain brewery. I'll be buying a lot more of this in the future.","ElGordo","May 27, 2006"

Hops are also present, but make up the backbone. Flavors are rather balanced, neither malt nor hops takes the show. Hops are neither marked by grapefruit nor pine, I'm not sure what to make of them. This is my third IPA produced in the midwest (Two Hearted and Dragonfly), and neither show any similiarities to those produced from the coasts (Stone, Lagunitas, Victory, Brooklyn), so I'm curious if this is the desire to those from the middle of the country (more balance, less extreme)?

Theres a hint of malt in the backdrop of the aroma, but its almost an afterthought. Malt come fort a bit more in the taste, but not much. This is a hop monster, and it doesnt shoot for balance.

The smell is sugary sweet like caramel and bread, with a deep hop aroma to round it out. The taste is also sweet, with rich caramelly malt flavor blending in to a good finish that's quite bitter, but not overdone. It feels smooth, with low to medium carbonation, and an average thickness. Very good balance and the fact that they don't overpower you with hop bitterness makes this one very drinkable...","bennetj17","Jan 11, 2006"

For a very malty tasting IPA, Nectar IPA is better than this one. Therefore since Great Devide IPA is 3.50$ more a sixer than that beer here in California, I will buy that instead. The flavors just didn't blend here for me. However, I am very glad the company is distrbuted out here now. I dunno try it, you might like it.

Pine and citrus hops dominate the aroma, which is very pleasant and enjoyable. I detect much more hop flavor than hop bitterness in the foreground, although the aftertaste is rather bitter. Sweet lightly roasted barley malt, grapefruit and pine are nicely blended together giving this midwest IPA a very west coast flavor. The finish is a bit sweeter than I would prefer. Medium bodied, just the right ammount of carbonation and has a slightly sticky finish. This is a pretty nice IPA, its not much of a change up from the others available in this area, but I think it can hold its own.","kmcnair","Dec 29, 2005"

The huge IBUs somehow blend very smoothly into this one, and creates one remarkably drinkable IPA. Very similar to their Fresh Hop Pale Ale, but with some additional hops to boost the flavor. I've had the bombers as well, and I thought the 12oz bottles were just as good. No noticeable lack in quality moving to the smaller container, still a fantastic brew.","hero27","Dec 23, 2005"

Has a good bit of bitterness. Nice flavor, somewhat typical flavor profile of many other good west coast IPAs. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nice for this beer.

Cascade hops up-front with a little malt in the background for some balance. They've really tried to smooth out some of the bitterness and did a nice job. Pours clean, nice head and very drinkable.

Hops are the word in this one; not in a sense that they overpower the palate, but they do take over on the malts juuust a bit. Very close to balanced, though not as sticky with malts as I'd like it. Nonetheless, this hophead really isn't complaining. Soft plum notes contain a mild sweetness that balances the pinecone hoppy bitterness nicely. Mild carbonation bites the tongue initially, and just as quickly is gone. Alcohol? 6.8% you say? Nary a trace. Sessionable indeed.","IrishRedRock","Nov 08, 2005"

A good dose of caramel malt plays the lever here and blends along to bring out a subdued fruitiness and earthiness. Quite resinous hops profile, very herbal and sappy, potent if a bit astringent in their high level of dryness. Growing bitterness with every sip, mouth coating.

It's an assertive scent and gives me a fair guess at what I'll be tasting. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with hop bitterness dancing on my tongue. Very crisp taste, the hops almost taste hot. They are not overpowering, however. More pine flavors, some grapefruit and maybe lemon come through. The malt presence comes through in the end and balances the taste wonderfully. Then the residual bitterness comes back, reminding me that this is indeed an IPA, and a mighty fine one at that.","Onceeven","Aug 24, 2005"

Taste is great, very hoppy, slightly bready, with lots of piney hops and a nice alcohol warmth to go with the hops. Could use more carbonation, which would really add to this beer.

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Medium bronze appearance, clear. Frothy but minimal head that settles at 1/4 of an inch on the top. Nice laces, dripping and interlocking patterns. Slightly juicy aroma, some elements of sweetness but with definite citrus tones. Mouthfeel is lighter than medium, carbonation is average and well-done. Flavor is very nice for a workaday IPA, bitter and resinous, lightly sap tinged, hoppy with some refreshing lime qualities, and with a decent but subdued light caramel backbone. Finishes without fade and with a remaining hop emphasis. Nicely executed, drinkable, representative for the American style, and a much better drink than the ESB to my mind.","ADR","Jul 28, 2005"

Bready malt aroma, light fruitiness plus orange citrus hoppiness, just a bit of pine. Only moderate bitterness, but plenty of hop character. Citrus, pine resin are balanced nicely by toasted maltiness, especially at the start. Finishes with a resinous hop bitterness. Medium body, moderately low carbonation, a bit creamy and just slightly sticky from residual sweetness.

The hops begin to grab a hold, and the beer has a really sharp bitter bite to it, which gives way to a lingering chalky astringent hoppiness. This is certainly a well hopped beer, it has a hint of maltiness to it, but just enough to be barely perceptible. It really is not enough to even tame the hops one bit. Because of the massive hop character this beer is almost dry on the palate. This is certainly and over the top hopped IPA, almost too much even for me and I like hops. At times I can see this really appealing to me.","Gueuzedude","Jun 17, 2005"

The hops are there, of course, but this isn't a one trick pony. Some orange aroma and an interesting sweetness are detectable as well. The same goes for the taste, which is unexpectedly complex. Starts off with a crush of bitterness but features supporting appearances by pulpy orange, a bit of sweetness, and a tease of lingering alcohol warmth. A nicely balanced mouthfeel--not too oily, astringent, or chewy. Just when I thought I would never find another IPA that made me stand up and take notice...","BitteBier","Jun 11, 2005"

The aroma is complex and intriguing, i have to say its not a typical IPA smell though this is not a typical IPA. The smell is somewhat like a grapefruit with brown sugar on it, a citrusy hop smell with a sweet malt backbone...really fantastic. The mouthfeel is somehow creamy and smooth with light carbonation which is weird considering how hoppy and bitter it is. The taste is initially slightly hoppy followed by a mild and bready malt flavor and then WHAM! the hops hit and its a wallop. The hops flavor is really complex and could be analyzed for hours but i detect grapefruit, perhaps lemon and a floral grass type of flavor that really grounds the beer for the bitter, dry finish that leaves you jonesing for more hops. Truly a fantastic IPA, easily one of the best available in NC (along with the hoppy hour and big boss). The alcohol is discernable but i have to say no more than any other descent IPA which is surprising given the high alcohol content of this beer. In a word Fantastic","silver0rlead","Apr 16, 2005"
4.13,1.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer pours a sort of dull rusty brown color. Lucking the large, bright head and tons of lacing offset the ugly colors. The smell is identical to orange drink. Almost like Sunny D. I can't get past that flavor. Sweet orange concentrate flavor. The taste isn't nearly as sweet or as orangey. More of a pine hoppiness to it. Lots of raw bitteness in there as well. Malts come and go. Quite sweet in the malt department with honey notes and a little toasted bread in there. Alcohol, what alcohol? I didn't know the abv and couldn't taste it at all. I think the bitterness offset it, but I sure was feeling a nice little buzz by the end. The hops linger forever, this could truly be a sipper because the flavor just hangs in my mouth. Nice alpha acid hit in the end. Another great beer from this brewery.","granger10","Apr 12, 2005"

Sharp piney hops bite at the tongue and are largely unchecked by the shallow malt taste. Diverse hop profile comes through in the taste, very interesting. A little caramel and spice are there too.

No attempt at balancing bitter and sweetness is even remotely considered here. This is a hops showcase all the way. Tiny moments of sweetness are just overpowered by the hopping. Bitter at the first and all the way through. Relentless. Sure, I like bitter ass hoppy IPA's, but there are better ones lurking around than this particular one. I enjoy the bitter and dry finish much more when there are other tastes to compliment it. This one has a bitter and dry start and finish with backup of other textures. No complexity. It tastes like they just heaped in five bushels of hop cones and called it good. ""Hop heads"" have at it.

I like it. The flavor is really nice. Some sweet hops, but also spicey peppery hops, balanced over sweet caramel, slightly honey sweet malt base. I like it a lot.

The head is a white dimpled monster that leaves nice, intricate webs of lacing down the glass. The body of the beer is a ruby tinted copper with a slight haze, sparse little chunks of matter here and there and almost no visible carbonation. The nose is vibrant and dominated by citrusy hop aromas, light hints of pine and blending with the sweet malt backing creates a lovely apricot aroma. Flavor-wise this IPA is a bit sweeter and less dry than many of the style. Sweet and sticky with caramel up front, picking up a subtle bubble-gum/cotton candy sweetness flavor as well. The bitterness is moderate (a bit less than preferable), the hop flavors are lovely. The tart fruitiness of the hops both create their own and meld with the flavors of the malt to create diverse flavors of honey drizzled watermelon, honey-dew, apricot, and grape-fruit tossed with a sparse sprinkling of pine needles. Mouthfeel is near-still and medium bodied, very nice. This is a very balanced IPA. Looking forward to having it again.","FormatKid","Dec 17, 2004"

4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Beautiful hopping starts in the middle of the palate and puts a squeeze on the tongue from the middle to the tip, and leaves a tingly kiss right on the tip of my tongue. Very sexy. The malt is thin but sweet, and even a little raw. It goes the opposite way on the palate, right down very smoothly. It's like the parting of the red sea, bittering on one side, and malting on the other. So balanced it might give an accountant an orgasm. I could drink, and drink and drink and drink this. Leaves my mouth with a great spiciness like from nibbling on a piece of fresh herb (horehound, sage, thyme, anise basil).","gbontrag","Nov 28, 2004"
4.42,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy red-orange color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is full of citrus hops, and lots of em! Very fresh, but not too green. The taste starts with a little bit of sweet maltiness. Slightly bready, and a hint of caramel. The finish is all hops. Juicy citrusy hops bring lots of fresh flavor to the palate. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is great for an almost 7% IPA. Good stuff!","SheepNutz","Nov 20, 2004"
3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a amber with golden hints nice fluffy off white head with good lacing. Aroma is lots of hops with sweet malt background, pine aroma on top of citrus background. Taste is hops right away bitter citrus grapefruit flavors stomp all over the malt. Good hoppy IPA with a lightly sweet malt finish and a lingering pine resin finish that sticks to your tounge. Mouthfeel is a little light, mostly hops, malt background seems a little light. Drinkability is good nice hoppy IPA hop heads will rejoice.","mntlover","Nov 17, 2004"
4.37,7.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Pours with a head about half an inch deep of sandy-colored, variously sized bubbles. Head leaves a sticky collar and moderate lacing despite no visible carbonation. Beer is dark amber to matte bronze in color with honeyed bronze highlights... this is a good looking beer. The aroma is surprising--I was expecting the usual pine, grapefruit, etc. Instead, this presents a bouquet garni of oregano, tarragon, and bay; reedy hop characteristics of old hay and under-ripe orange skins; subtle saltine cracker maltiness. A quiet, padding-about nosefeel. Flavors are of a moderately hefty malt backbone displaced by strong, herbal, tweedy bitterness of hop stalks. Assertive taste of grapefruit skin practically curls up the sides of the tongue. Mouthfeel is bitter without being pushy--aftertaste fades out dryly. Drinkability? I thoughtfully reviewed the first half of the bomber for as long as I could stand it, and just slurped down the rest of the bottle. While this beer was clearly not over-the-top, I appreciated its subtleties, particularly the way its aroma made me consider hops for their herbal qualities. Just a really delicious, laid-back, herby smell. I can't resist the comparison to Chartreuse. And that drinkability! Man, this one really hit the spot.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Sep 29, 2004"
4.6,13,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Even better than I recall the older Maverick version being. Simply a wonderful IPA. Nothing raw...just an uber-hoppy IPA that bursts with pine oil and citrus flavors. Palate-coating and immensely drinkable. Awesome.","OldFrothingSlosh","Sep 21, 2004"

Nose is fresh cedar and pine along with some floral citrus notesquite sniffable. Thick and juicy mouth feel like grapefruit juice mixed with pine sap. Taste has notes of acidic fresh citrus fruit and bitter grapefruit rind along with notes of raw hop leafs and resins. A very intense IPA and absolutely delicious.

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This pours out a clear copper body with a few fingers of light tan head. Rings of lacing were left around the glass as this was consumed. The aroma is bursting with fruity citric hops especially grapefruit there was a slight caramel to it as well that was more apparent later in the session. Definitely can tell from the smell alone this is going to be a good one for a hop fix. Citric hops come first in the flavor with orange and grapefruit notes as well as a bit of pine in the mix as well. A slight malty sweetness can be detected as well to keep this one from going over the top. Excellent hoppy bitter finish on the end that completes this great taste. This is a medium bodied brew that fills the mouth and palette with hops galore. Drinkability is excellent for any one that has a taste for hops if not youre drinking the wrong brew to begin with. Great offering from Great Divide that is on par with their DIPA and Imperial Stout.","meathookjones","Aug 14, 2004"

Total grapefruit-piney hops in the nose; fresh and sweet, too. Pine sap and grapefruit rind up front. Nice, fresh hop oil and a little sweetness. Middle is thick, full, darkish tasting, but still full of hops. Remains bitter hoppy right through the finish. Very bitter. This is a good, one-dimensional (maybe one-and-a-half), American IPA. There's a decent malt contribution, but it really can't compete with the hops. But it's a quality brew, and it does sweeten a little with temperature.","kbub6f","Jul 29, 2004"

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 oz bomber. Deep copper hue with a slight chill haze. One fingered, persistent cream white head. Tattered lace remains. Nose is predominantly pine essence and clementine, with honeyish malt and stately bready pale malt tones secondary. Fairly mellow aromawise. In flavor, light lovibond caramel sweetness upfront yields to assertive, pith like hop bitterness. Hop flavor is of softer citrus notes, most notably tangerine and ripe, juicy clementine. Trace pine sap hints. Static biscuit malt presence provides a solid malt foundation. Virtual lack of esters indicative of a neutral American yeast strain. Sweetness appreciably as it warms, with medium toffee sweetness surfacing, although hop presence manages to remain dominant. Moderate in body and suitably viscous in mouthfeel. Finishes sweeter than most IPAs, countered with an orange rind fringe. A well rounded IPA. Assertive, but not overbearing in citrus character. Squeaky clean and damn tasty.","marc77","Jun 26, 2004"

4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bright and clear, dimly orange golden color, solid cap of frothy white foam sits well, resides slowly down to a thin skim and bubbles with immensely sticking sheets of lacing. Resinous hop nose of highly sweet citrus and pine needles. Solid IPA nose. Wouldn't mind a bit of a toasty malt backing though. Once it warms up there's a bit of caramel malt coming through. Taste has nice meld of malty fruityness and slight citric twinges in the front. Middle is subdued in a calmness of caramel but building a base of pine and bitterness to come. Oh...and it turns into a pine needle forest in the finish with lots of pulpy thick, leafy hop bitterness while maintaining a favorable smoothness. Many notes lingering of orange and grapefruit peels mixing with the pine. Nice hoppy IPA taste. Feel is about medium, quite smooth the whole way down until that finish kicks in. Which in fact mellows out and the bitterness falls a bit short, but is still nice at that point with a nice fluffy woodish give. A nice IPA to have alot of.","tavernjef","Jun 17, 2004"

4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As a confirmed hop-head, the bar grows ever higher for an IPA to impress me. This beer cleared the bar with room to spare. Poured a bit more amber-ish than usual, more of a red ale look. Aroma - the expected grapefruit, but quite juicy and luxurious. Exceptionally smooth - none of the rough edges that so often accompany pumping up the hops volume. Easygoing, with a nice malt aspect that balanced the hops quite well, yet the beer was by no means heavy or even particularly malty. Simply a well-executed beer.","Brent","May 24, 2004"
3.91,-3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Largely clear, tawny-bronze-copper in hue, the color is typical of an IPA, sometimes there is nothing wrong with typical. A billowy off-white head reached a healthy two fingers in height. It is an impressive sight. The head retention was very good, it was damn sticky and it lasted a long while before fading to a patchy, foamy, residue. The subsequent lacing was very sticky and quite prevalent. This is an attractive looking beer. Big citrusy notes in the nose, especially upfront, in the middle an orangey, pulpy aroma was detectable as were hints of caramel, pine needles and spruce. When I took a hard sniff I could smell a hint of metal. That is off-putting. Thankfully the potency of the hops was large enough that the metal was drowned out on normal sniffs. All in all, the bouquet was inviting. The hops were very juicy and quite succulent. The citrus flavors of grapefruit flesh blend perfectly with an orangey taste. Add it the caramel maltiness, some toastiness, and then bring back the hoppy influences of pine and then kick in some spruce. Wow, this is tasty! The big hop bitterness does well in covering a noticeable flaw. Metal is perceptible in the finish and briefly in the aftertaste. I can get past it and it is hardly apparent. Still it is noticeable. The hops shine nicely in this IPA and frankly the hopping is great! I love the blend used. It is very complex (as hops go) and amazingly juicy. This IPA is not balanced at all and I dont believe the brewers ever intended to be. It seems to be bitterer than 60 IBUs; this is more proof that IBUs dont translate into actual bitterness. However the alcohol content seems stronger than 6.8%. How odd. The carbonation is modest, on the low side, I like the silkiness of the mouthfeel; the body isnt that big, it hovers around medium. It is nothing special. Whatever. Maverick IPA is very tasty, very drinkable, and very likable. I cant ask for nothing more. I purchased a bomber in Loveland, CO. IMO, it is worthy trying.","bditty187","May 18, 2004"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"22oz Bomber with no freshness date. This big boy poured a clear copper color with a thick, dense and creamy head. Aroma consists of some serious hops that are fruity and piney. Some bready yeastiness is also present in the aroma which adds up to one nice smelling brew. The body is medium, soft and smooth with a biting bitter finish. Flavor has a citrusy hop note up front that kicks you in the backside with bitterness. Malt is underneath and lends good support to round things out. This is one bitter IPA and a good one in my opinion.","BierReise","May 13, 2004"

A sticky, rocky head sits atop the clear liquid, leaving pronounced trails of lace down the glass. Looks good. The smell is that of a pine forest at first, while lingering malty notes loom beneath. The taste is abundantly hoppy as a distinctive grapefruit/citrus flavor becomes clear on the finish. In addition, a substantial, balancing sweet caramel malt flavor complements the hoppy aspects. The mouthfeel is somewhat oily, but smooth. Drinks fairly well for a strong brew. A first-rate effort from Great Divide in its inaugural ""big beer"" series. I'm looking forward to the Imperial Stout in my fridge.","Jon","Aug 03, 2003"
