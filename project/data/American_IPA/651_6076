I see a 2013 review sort of compared this to Zombie Dust and another heralded it's West Coast character. Wow, OK. Totally different beer in 2015 folks . Nonetheless it's still actually a very good IPA.  Goes down quite easy for a 7+% beer but that also speaks to the simpler nature of this incarnation of FP.  It's not a world class IPA anymore in my book but still very good if you can find it fresh. Some of the older reviews on the site are working off a prior version of this beer that was far more transcendent than what Ithaca is churning out nowadays.","mackeyse","Feb 20, 2015"

APPEARANCE: hazy, opaque, almost blood-orange body; white coral sits atop an uneven head; uneven lacing... AROMA: brilliant, BIG mango and pomegranate mix with a floral bouquet to arrest the senses... PALATE: buzzing, vibrantly electric mouthfeel; warm, full finish; big, but drinkable; intense, teeth-clenching aftertaste...TASTE: a potpourri of citric cadences--orange, lemon, grapefruit, mango and sharp sugars--a hop bomb... OVERALL: a mesmerizing enticement of hops, much as the mix pack proclaims; more overpowering than the Cascazilla and the banner carrier in a hop offensive...","dacrza1","Jan 04, 2015"

Taste is similar to aroma with pine resin, hops and a lot of citrus, especially sweet tropical citrus. Nice mouthfeel and th balance of hops and citrus is great. The sweet of the tropical fruit is teasing in that it makes you want a little more but I am glad it doesn't because tha balance is very good.

But underneath those aromas is a light, herbal tea-like scent, which is really nice. The taste is sweet and juicy, with sweetened white grapefruit juice the dominant flavor. The finish is mostly sweet, too, though there's a pronounced bitterness at the very end. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. This is a great juicy, herbal IPA that I'm glad to see in Ohio. Definitely on the sweeter side, but it's a good, light sweetness, rather than a heavy, overpowering, and awful sweetness you see in something like Chillwave.","blankenhoney","Sep 24, 2014"

Someone just explained that it is an ""East coast"" hoppy beer vs the usual Westie style. Makes me happy as now I can hold my head high & say I am not alone. Hops have their place but they should be ""seen but not heard", in a sense. As it Warms to ambient temperature, the hop comes to the fore, but still keeps trim.

Pours to a bright yellow with a bright white head that stands well. On the taste this brew has a nice hop belt up front with floral sweetness in the background. The sweetness then smoothly transitions to the front but the floral hops hang on then come back in the end with a sharp bitterness that then fades to a flat bitter sweet aftertaste. Very intense flavors, distinctive and gradual, nothing abrupt. Pricey, but a keeper without a doubt.","mooseisloose","Jun 25, 2014"

Neither is bad, but there really isn't all that much that makes this beer noteworthy. There is a good weight to the body, thicker than I was expecting based on previous comments.

4.11,-3.1,3.75,4.5,4,4,4,"Hits you with one to two fingers of bone white foam, fairly dense weave but there are some bigger bubbles, the lacing forms very long streaks, however, not the stickiest. Cloudy yellow to light orange hued liquid, lots of “floaties” inside, fully opaque, you can only see a few lazily scattered bubbles but unlikely there’s many more you can’t discern. The nose is on the aggressive side, herbaceous and piney, dried grapefruit pith, metallic earth, burnt bread crusts and while the florality and peach, apricot fruit are no pushovers, they don’t have the raw power to show decisively, overall its muscular texture lengthens presence more than gluey richness. In the mouth it has a similar feel, close to full-bodied, focused on grip over layering. As you get pineapple, papaya mixed into the apricot and apple, more nervosity, same for the white grapefruit, blood orange citrus, comes into its own. Still, little ignoring the grassiness and earthiness, on the bitter side of the ledger. Pine, dash here and there of cocoa or mocha. Seems to want to offer fewer elements and intensify what is there. Carbonation is sneakily strong, enlivens the finish. While not an easygoing rendition of the category, by the same token not overly challenging to the point of conceding the victory.","farrago","May 29, 2014"

I really like the smell, but the taste, while complex, is not my ""cup of tea", but seems to be really good for that style of beer. I am only slightly disappointed because I expected some of the sweetness from the amazing smell to carry over into the taste, but it barely did. Overall it seems to be a very good, very quality beer, just not really my style taste-wise.","silverblaze540","May 26, 2014"

Up front juicy tropical fruit hops with a more herbal hop behind that. Taste is more herbal/catty hop forward than the fruity hops in the nose. Sweet biscuit backbone. Medium mouthfeel with a sticky dry finish. Overall a nice looking IPA with a great nose of tropical fruits, citrus and herbal hops. Nice dry hopping too. The taste is more catty as compared to the nose but still has some nice citrus notes. Respectable and recommended.","CowsandBeer","May 15, 2014"

Not hard to see why. a very good spring IPA. Pleasing to drink, pleasing to allow to linger in your mouth. I have been able to get my hands on some really good IPAs lately and this is one of them. If you find it, buy it and enjoy it.","Seanem44","Apr 09, 2014"

The mouth feel on this beer is equal to the robust nose that it offers leaving no disappointments. Truthfully for the more experienced IPA drinker.

I would consider this an imperial IPA from the taste and the body of the beer, but I'm probably being fooled by the huge hop character. It's missing something to offset that huge hop character, but is not a bad beer at all. This won't become one of my favorites, but I'm really glad that I tried it. After a great aroma, the taste was a little bit of a let down, but this is definitely a fine beer.","jdhowe","Dec 28, 2013"

Nose is super tropical with big citrus aromas – grapefruit, orange and lemon, but mostly grapefruit. There’s a little bit of grassy hops as well. The taste is magical. Bright tropical fruits are cut with just the right amount of bitterness for a dry and fresh aftertaste. Lots of grapefruit and a mix of sweeter fruits that I can’t really identify. The mouthfeel is amazing…it’s one of the smoothest IPAs I’ve had, even as it’s packing a big punch at 7.5%. There’s a good amount of lacing left on the glass as I finish and the head is retained pretty well. This is my new favorite IPA that’s readily available.","greenmtn1111","Jul 01, 2013"
4.11,-3.1,4.25,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,"Great yellow gold color with a fairly thick white head. Aroma is fantastic. I get a ton of earthiness from this beer; along with a ton of hops. Lacing is holding up fairly well. Taste is very nice as well. A nice dryness I don't expect from IPAs, but is enjoyable. The hop profile is clean and bright. Still loving the earthiness; it reminds me of the hills of Tennessee. Mouthfeel is slightly different, but like I said, the dryness is enjoyable. I find this IPA to be better suited for late Fall or early Spring, when it's a bit colder outside.","mverity","Jul 01, 2013"

Leaves behind a medium malt body and lots of dry beautiful hops. The malt holds it up in the glass while the hops bite you. It has a big nose and smells great. A little citrus and clover honey on the palate and dry as well. This beer is dry hopped five times throughout the brewing process. It’s invigorating. The name is also very cool. This beer is on my list of ""I gotta have some of that.""","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Smell is a lot of tropical fruit and earthy notes. Taste follows the nose for the most part, but with a lot more citrus and a bit of pine. I love the bitterness too. First time I tried this I think my palate was completely shot from what I was drinking before, but now all of these flavors are coming out. It's really nice. Mouthfeel is what you would expect from an IPA. Pretty light and crisp and absolutely refreshing. Overall, honestly this is probably one of my favorite IPAs. Possibly up there with Sculpin and Stone.

It doesn't have the powerful nose or big flavor to stand up to the top DIPAs, but it's on a short list of IPAs for me. Really flavorful yet easy to drink. I'll never be unhappy receiving this one.","brydeen","Apr 30, 2013"

This really reminds me of a slightly less aromatic version of Blind Pig IPA from Russian River, but if it was brewed with Citra hops. I highly recommend this beer.","flayedandskinned","Apr 26, 2013"

Hopped, hopped, and hopped again… and then dry hopped. It shows, but it also carries some balance and pleasant sweetness rounding it all out. Great IPA that is really easy to find and find fresh.","Sam21","Apr 26, 2013"

Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, orange rind, floral, grass, light honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Good amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a solid malt balance and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA.

I live in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania where you can not purchase this beer yet, so a drive for it was worth it. It smells flowery but it is Citrus and Pine, with hints of grapefruit. All I have to say is I will be buying this whenever available, because in thirty years of drinking, this is truly one of my most enjoyable experiences.","Arrowhuntr","Mar 14, 2013"

Tangerines/apricots(?), hop flowers, some pine resin, a little grass. It’s just not quite as strong as I’d like. A bit blandly bitter, particularly in the finish. A lightly sweet crystal malt flavor lurks below. This is yet another beer that I’d like to revisit in the future, preferably from a fresh keg. 7/7/11. Better than I remember. Fruity, floral hop aroma and very good flavor. Could have a bit more bitterness, but it’s nice and pale without any of the cloying caramel note that plagues many IPAs. It has some light stickiness.

4.35,2.6,4.25,4.75,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours a clean yellowed orange, almost like butterscotch, with a nice finger width rocky white soap bubble head on it. The beer’s body has a light haze to it, but displays a steady stream of bubbles racing to the head, and is really quite translucent. The beer’s lacing is not very noticeable with light to medium sticky clouds. On the nose, this beer is big from the minute you crack the lid. Even as it sits on the table in front of you, you should be picking up light wafts of orange citrus and pine. When you stick your nose in it, the beer smells like sweet pulpy orange juice with a touch of pine and a light caramel malt ghosting in the background. Hints of mango and passion fruit can also be picked up. On the tongue the beer tastes beautifully bitter and orange citrus. The beer begins with light malty notes before the bitters grasp the tongue and slowly ring juicy, pulpy, bitter orange juice onto the tongue, while a touch of pine works its way in. The finish is light with citrus and bitters and a touch of aspirin. The taste also displays lightly herbal saltiness, which is interesting and cool, reminiscent (to me) of the Floral IPA from Sierra Nevada’s Beer Camp, though it gives the herbal flavor far better than the Floral IPA. On the mouth, this beer feels clean and medium bodied on the tongue. It is extremely drinkable for its alcohol percentage, and leaves the mouth with a light bitter dry pucker that is just enough to encourage you to keep drinking. Overall, this is a delicious IPA that gives me my proper bitter bite, while smelling amazing and giving superb orange juice flavors, which isn’t as common of a thing in IPA’s. Definitely worth a try for the hop lover, and then worthy of a couple re-tries to boot!","Maxwell","Jan 19, 2013"

Smell is just great with a lot of pine and citrus. A healthy amount of fresh whole grain dough with a yeast signature sits on top of a toasted malt and grain melange. Taste is superb with a light crisp drinkability that belies the big hop personality. Malt follows the nose with a great combination of toasted grains and English style yeast fruitiness. Hops are all American while avoiding the cliche' over the top nature that is the downfall of so many otherwise great beer. This is a smooth brew with a perfect carbonation the lends itself to sessioning and early brunch.","scootny","Oct 30, 2012"

On my way home one evening, not wanting to stop at Wegmans to pick up a six of my favorite, I stopped in at the home of Ithaca Beer and bought six of Flower Power. Turned out to be a very pleasant beer. Hoppy enough to satisfy me, and I am a hops freak. Most surprising was the nose. Due to youthful hay fever, I pretty much couldn't smell a barn if I were standing knee-deep in horse shit. This beer, though, comes through with major fruitiness. ABV 7.5, it's enough, but not so much you can't enjoy a few. Give it a shot ...","mobius024","Apr 24, 2012"

Upon sipping we were met with a wildly bitter beer, which held up throughout. We do wish, however, that the flavoring has remained to the end. We felt that it prematurely petered out, leaving room for a more watery finish. All in all, this is a tasty beer, and an expertly crafted bitter guy, which is hard to find. We just wish that the edges were a bit more refined, and things were better rounded out in the flavor department.","TheBrewo","Apr 19, 2012"

Initially my tastebuds were flooded with grapefruit, mangoes, and bit of peach followed by piney hop bitterness which transitions to sweet malt with a touch of banana and then finishes with piney hop bitterness. Pleasant mouthfeel. Fairly medium bodied with a heavy malt backbone, more reminiscent of a DIPA than a pale ale. Plenty of carbonation, creamy smooth brew.

Smell is tangerine, pineapple, mango, grass, and grapefruit. Taste is very balanced, tons of citrus up front with grass, grapefruit, and pine in the finish. Body is great, plenty of life, medium body for the style, little dry, and very drinkable. This is one of the best and for a reasonable price and a freshness date. Wish it was in N.H.

Pretty bitter up front with a clementine finish, bitter aftertaste. Pretty light body, perfect level of carbonation. Could smell this one all day, taste is bitter and juicy.

Poured yellow orange with a half finger off-white head and subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine, caramel, tangerine, citrus hop, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, citrus hop, tangerine, and orange peel. It had a medium feel on the palate with a medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was REALLY nice and balanced. It was very potent with citrus and fruit notes which was very nice. The flavor was more of the same with more of the fruit presence taking charge.

4.25,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - This is an IPA that focuses on aroma and hop flavor first, just as it should. The fruity hops dominate in the aroma and while the beer pretty much tastes the way it smells it also has some peppery complexity in the flavor profile. The malt is sufficient to balance things out and keep the hops from becoming overwhelming, but it keeps its head down and allows the hop character to take center stage. Very nice.","nickfl","Dec 10, 2011"

Citrus pine aroma with strong floral qualities. Also some melon in the aroma. Sweet malt base is hidden but apparent. Strong hoppy taste up front bringing out intense resinous qualities. Bitter grapefruit and citrus qualities with some tropical fruit complexities. Well varied hop taste makes me want more. Finishes balanced with a little malt sweetness, but this beer is all about those juicy fruity hop qualities. Well carbonated with a medium bodied mouthfeel that's easy to drink. This is a great beer gaining popularity for a reason. One of the best east coast IPA's and one of my most frequently purchased. I'd say it competes with the best.","ShemRahBoo","Oct 17, 2011"

One of my favorites from Ithaca, a brewery I've frequented from the early days.","rab53","Oct 12, 2011"

The taste is hoppy but clean. It's not a tongue scorcher. Some mild citrus involved. Little to no pine. Mouthfeel is sticky but thin. It coats the mouth, but not for long. There's a mildly bitter aftertaste that lingers, but it's pleasant. Overall, this is a marvelous IPA.","Retail1LO","Oct 08, 2011"

The aroma is incredible with hints of pineapple, grapefruit and other citrus fruits, and floral scents. very bright and vibrant. The taste does not disappoint at all as it matches the aroma. Very balanced, no boozy alcohol heaviness despite the relatively high ABV. Great big bouquet of hops. The only thing that is less than perfect on this is the mouth feel - it leaves your palate very dry, unlike the very superb & most exceptional IPAs.","Neorebel","Oct 08, 2011"

4.15,-2.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange/gold color with about a centimeter of foamy, bubbly, white head that stays around for an impressive amount of time. Smells of piney hops, fresh citrus (lemon, grapefruit, strong orange), and other faint, grassy herbs. Tastes similar, with an emphasis on the hops and citrus. There is a very faint, and quite peculiar, soapy aftertaste though, which only slightly detracts from an otherwise great beer. Mouth is crisp and bitter, with the hops definitely making themselves known. Carbonation seems spot on. Overall, a great IPA that is worth seeking out.

3.46,-18.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Pretty good beer but not the best example of an IPA, the maltiness comes through much more than any hops that are present. I had this almost a year ago on draft and would like to try this fresh again to compare.","Azurescens","Aug 31, 2011"

Also had a side by side tasting with Two Hearted just to make sure this beer was really as good as I thought it was. It is. Floral, and I mean super floral, hop flavors EVERYWHERE...and the citrus is there as well, mouthfeel is full but not sticky or overly resinous, just refreshing as hell with a perfect amount of carbonation.

3.83,-9.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours golden-orange into my Lost Abbey stem. Big, fluffy, egg-shell head. Looks really nice. The nose is a tame blend of sweet malt and fruity hops. Smells exactly like a toned down version of Jai Alai (or this bottle isn't as fresh as when I have had Jai Alai). The taste is very smooth, mild fruity, flowery hops balanced very well with what tastes like crystal malts. Not super hoppy, but it's definitely there in a way that opens up nicely when warm. Let's not get carried away though, this is not an elite IPA, but a good one. Mouthfeel is very nice, medium body, reasonable carbonation. Overall, I would drink this a fair amount if it was distributed to me and I would trade for a bottle, but not a 6'er. Some IPA's I like better are Blind Pig, Columbus, Duet, Furious + Wet, Sculpin, Jai Alai. That said, it is pretty comparable to Jai Alai and a pretty good beer.","seeswo","Aug 19, 2011"
4.47,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice clear golden amber with a fluffy white head that reaches up to the top of my pint glass and leaves a thick lacing along the side. Nice, strong smell of apricot and grapefruit with a light malty sweetness. The taste picks up where the aroma left off, with a nice refreshing burst of juicy, citrus hops. The middle is much more floral and pine with a grassy and resinous bitter finish. Difficult to tell how much of the fruitiness comes from the hops and what exactly the yeast is contributing, which has a slightly British quality that gives off some nice, subtle fruity esters. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, very dry, refreshing finish and low carbonation that lets the flavors really stand out. A great beer that guys down easily and quickly. For people like me that tend to have a bit of beer ADD, this one is drinkable enough and complex enough to be able to have a few.","charliedvrs","Aug 18, 2011"

I don't know how old my bottle is, but the aroma is good, maybe a bit subdued, but wonderful cirtus smell with a touch of pine. The actual taste is sort of opposite, more pine and less citrus, maybe even a bit grassy, sweet at first then the bitterness really gets you. Carbonation seems about normal for the style and mouthfeel is good, really dry at the end. I had this on draft at Churchkey in DC a few months back and while I didn't take notes, I remember thinking it was very good, and the bottle didn't disappoint.

The aroma had me thinking I got another sweet tropical fruit bomb with subtle malt presence, when the taste was more of a mix between a tropical fruit bomb, a strongly malty IPA, and a citrus & pine bomb.

Poured in my dogfish head snifter, pours a dark transparent light amber color, with nice fluffy head that fills the glass. Wow. This is a beautiful looking IPA. Smell- this hit me the second I got the cap off. Hardcore citrus, orange peel, pine, tropical flavors. Pot? Yes, maybe this smells a little like pot. Awesome- this is maybe the best smelling single IPA I have ever smelled. Taste- big pine, hardcore bitterness from the hops, matched by a nice malt tropical fruits sweetness. The finish is crisp and bitter. Mouthfeel- nice, medium bodied, not syrupy at all, appropriate carbonation. Drinkability- the abv is there, but in a good way. I don't see being able to pound this (nor would you want to- it is to be savored), and ultimately I think this runs a very fine line between being a single or a double IPA.

I like this complex IPA and its twist on the now crowded IPA category. The mouthfeel is just right and now I will have to try to make this growler last a little longer.

The hearty malt profile- more bready than sweet- may or may not be stifling the hops a bit. The malts linger as much as the pine, which for my personal taste detracts from the ""rememberability scale"". Still, a tasty brew that I'd recommend trying.","PDXHops","Apr 01, 2011"

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"medium darkish amber with a cream colored head that holds and leaves lace. nose is perfumy. floral hops on top of some piney and tropical fruit notes and a nice, sweet, caramelly malt backbone. pretty standard concept, but executed very well. taste is intentionally lopsided with a big floral character leading the way, and a healthy amount of bitter that comes in about half way through to open up the taste buds for a little pine and a lot of balancing malt sweetness. medium body starts soft and ends dry. overall, a great beer. one of the northeast's best easily available ipas. always excellent on tap and a great way to cure the hop jones. another winner from ithaca.","timtim","Mar 23, 2011"

The aroma offers classic citrus/cat piss type hops with a slight brussel sprout edge. Nice. The flavor brings a more flowery hop but still carries plenty of pissy bite. Delicious. It has bright orange-grapefruit and as you go there is a fair pine edge with a biscuit idea to it as well. It's medium bodied, slightly syrupy but plenty drinkable. Carbonation is tastefully light.

3.87,-8.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Each sip evolves rapidly from a very sweet, very floral burst into a milder citrus and light malt body. There is a lingering sweetness from honey which is gradually balanced out by soft, buttering dryness on the tongue. Flower Power is crisp and clean, with nice citrus, floral, and fruit flavors from the cocktail of hops used in the boil and used to dry hop the beer. It is very refreshing since it focuses on the aroma and flavor characteristics of the hops rather than oily bitterness which many IPAs tend towards when they get hopped up a notch. Definitely try this one out on one of the remaining summer afternoons.","HarrisonDean","Feb 18, 2011"

The aromatics are strongly of fresh fragrant floral hops a touch of citrus notes along with it. Upfront the taste seems rather abrasive, but it smooths out near the end. The problem is that the hop bitterness leaves that woodsy taste lingering on the back of the tongue. This is a good and rather drinkable IPA, It's good when it's fresh, I wish there had been a better balance of flavor and hop, but all the components are there.

The hops are definitely the star of the show, but they are not too strong. You can also taste apricot, pineapple, and citrus. Maybe a little hint of orange.

Lots of fruit noted like grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and finishes sweet with notes of honey and apple. Excellent aftertaste, as the bitterness isn't tiring or scalding. This is a spectacular IPA.

Aroma is citrus and pine, maybe a little pineapple and quite sweet smelling. The flavour is more of the same plus some grapefruit and is much less sweet/malty than the smell which is a nice surprise. The beer is fairly lightly carbonated with a light-medium body. This is a very refreshing and tasty IPA and highly drinkable.","mrnobody","Oct 15, 2010"

Nice hoppy aroma. Plenty of citrus and pine. Slight hints of apricots and grass. Interesting hop profile. The flavor is plenty hoppy as well. I get grapefruit and pine sap with just a hint of herbs in the finish. The malt adds a little toastyness. The IBUs might not be at the extreme level, but the hop flavors really shine in this beer. The body is not that big or brassy, but it has such nice carbonation, makes it a pleasure to drink this beer. The ABV limits the drinkability a bit but otherwise this is a very solid IPA that will not shred the tastebuds.","morimech","Oct 10, 2010"

Aroma is full of citrus/pineapple and earthy hops, very nice smell with caramelized/biscuit malts sugar coated hops wafting my way. Pungent bitterness with sugar coated citrus/grapefruit/earthy hop blasts...a very nice east coast hoppy IPA. Probably one of the best versions I've come across in some time from the East Coast. Mouthfeel is nice medium bodied sharp carbonation, this would cut through either spicy foods or strong cheeses easily. Slightly oily textured hop content in the body gliding across the palate.

I still have a tasty, pretty (almost an umber color, great fluffy head that settles into fine lacing), easy to quaff IPA. Maybe it's just this batch? I'd kill to find this on tap somewhere to see if that changes the character enough.

No joke, it resembles Duvel and some others in the size, retention, and lacing here. Beautiful. Smells like a decent IPA, a bit piney-er of a focus than some other American IPAs. Taste is similar, piney hops with some clean bitterness and biscuit-y malt. Medium body, not as dry as some hop bombs out there, but smooth. Very drinkable, an IPA I would have no problem ordering or buying again. Just a clean, smooth, straightforward IPA. Good work here.","LordAdmNelson","Jun 06, 2010"

The nose reveals a light fresh grassy and citrus aroma. The hops are certainly present in this beer, but not as overboard as many of todays IPAs. Again, grassy and lemon citrus tastes are prevelant but are well balanced. Alcohol is also detectable, and contributes to flower powers slick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation works well with this beer. I could have several more, but the clinging grassy bitterness would keep this from being a truly session-able beer (i know, its above 4% abv too.)

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, best before June 2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy hops (oranges, apricots, tropical fruit), pine hops and honey. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the hops don't overpower the malty flavors (as the hops seem stronger in the aroma). With that being said, I think it's still a tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy.

Delicate strings and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose is sweet citrus, a suggestion of cereal grains and a light, floral character. Taste consistent with nose; however, cereal grains disappear from the flavor profile, and a light, lingering bitterness comes out at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive background carbonation that falls short of prickly. Consistency also exhibits a little oiliness as well. This is a pretty tasty IPA I have to say.

It has a great smell of flowers and fruits. It really has a strong hoppy taste to it and goes toward the border of overkill but stops short of it.

It has the basic malt bill of pale and Carapils malts loaded to the gills with Cascade hops. It's wickedly bitter, yet so refreshing, even at 8%. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer that seemingly is better unfiltered, although it's not very hazy at all.","WesWes","Jun 02, 2009"

4.42,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice looking beer. Pours a deep gold with a decent head and respectable lacing. The smell is fantastic with floral hops. Great taste with citrus and floral hops up front that flows into a nice little bite of bitterness in the back. The malt backbone isn't prevalent, but you do get a nice bit of sweetness to provide balance to the beer. I really enjoy this beer and what is even better is the fact that it is exactly as advertised. Flower Power India Pale Ale is the perfect description. If you are looking for an IPA that isn't as strong on the bitterness but has a great floral hop characteristic this hits it. I am shocked that this beer is 8%. Easily one of my favorites in this category.","psurandy","May 12, 2009"

Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass and appears a crystal clear rich amber color with about an inch of creamy light ecru foam. The foam leaves a thin lacing on the inside of my glass with each sip. Smell is of floral, herbacious and citrusy hops such as orange and grapefruit. Excellent aroma here! Tastes of toasted bisciut/caramel malts, white grapefruit juice, bitter orange peel, lemon and resinous pine. Hop oils are really noticeable with the slightest touch of warming alcohol.

There are tons of grapefruit acerbic and tart notes, some lemon, lots of orange blossom and citrusy tangerine, and wonderful hop oils seeping throughout the body of the beer. This is a smooth, creamy beer that has a very nice bready malt base that cuts away some of the hop sting. It isn't an entirely balanced beer, and it is a touch too light and thin in parts. The beer could use a little thickening up to really bring this to the next level. This is a delightful IPA with a tangy aftertaste that is a real palate cleanser. This is a dangerously deceptive 8% ABV beer, with no throaty burn or other boozy characteristics. I would seek this one out again. L'Chaim.","albern","Apr 22, 2009"

More cedar-spruce than grapefruit-tangerine in the aroma, but it's a close fight. Floral, too, appropriately. Candied nasturtium and grapefruit pith flavors are undercut by a disappointing watery blandness. Meager bitterness comes back near the finish, but sadly it's too little and too late. Weak finish, and the mouthfeel is dull and virtually lifeless save for a sparkly and bitter bite near the end of the swallow. Decent, but only just.","orfeu","Oct 25, 2007"
4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Golden orange hue with little head but with some lacing for a pleasing effect. Very hoppy, floral, citrusy (grapefruit, tangerine) nose (theres almost an ice-cream or sorbet smell if you really stick your nose into it). Really smells delicious but in the craft scene this type of presentation has become commonplace. Quite a sweet taste, with malty, fruity things happening, but bringing lots of hop flavor to bear. I would say this one is more about the hop character than bitterness, although the latter is still well represented. Some alcoholic tastes but its not really slamming me abv-wise so Id say its fairly drinkable as far as IPAs go. Dryness in the midrange for the style. Some buttery notes in the sweetness and in the mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Whether or not you are into the labeling is one thing, but the beer is quite tasty. If I were eating a meal with this Id want another one right away.","BabaJohn","Oct 12, 2007"

Aromas are of fresh floral hops, with apricot and gapefruit tones. Good body with plenty of maltiness and a fantastic flowery/fruity taste that makes you want more. Taste is hoppy up front for sure but not so much that it is undesired. This is a very nicely balanced hop attack. Plenty of citrus fruit flavors.

I can smell hints of the aroma from a distance - lightly sweet floral scents call me closer. At the nose is a very interesting citrus aroma that screams kumquats. Light hints of spiciness in there to, but I can just taste the sweet rind of a kumquat as I anticipate sipping this beer. Very pleasing aroma, and a little different than most IPAs. he first sip has a bit of sweetness up front, then the bitterness and herbal NB flavor raise the eyebrows a bit. The sweet and soft aromas belie the assertive bitterness for sure. The bitterness gives way to a bit of sweetness for a brief moment before the palate seems to be freed from everything - it's clean. But then the herbal notes creep back in. A hint of mint, a bit of grass. For this much bitterness, I'd prefer a higher alpha hop than NB to cut down on the aftertaste. But hey, it gets me to drink the beer faster to get rid of the funky finish flavors. Hop burps start up quickly. They're better than the finishing notes for sure. Mouthfeel is solid and on par with the style. Drinkability isnt too bad, but a more pleasing finish would make me rush out and buy this one.","aaronh","Jul 27, 2007"

This has been in bottles for a while (who knows how long - there isn't a date! Still, the stuff I had at the brewery was 5 weeks ago. Hmm. Yeah, they had it in bottles then). So, tastes change and I'm getting used to Ithaca hop use (Cascazilla/Red, DIPA, Flower Power). Still... This reminds me, oddly, of drinking Shipyard's Fuggles IPA.

Not very hoppy as IPAs go, and in a blind taste test, I might even guess that it was an APA. Being only slightly fruity and piney/resiny mean it's mild, and that's OK with me.

The taste is ok, not awe-inspiring as I do notice a strong hop taste that is more citrus like but does not seem to have enough oomph. Also picking up a good malt flavor, but to me it just seems that this brew is quite bland for what I was expecting from its name.

Not much in the way of aroma - this followed a HopDevil, so it had a helluva opening act to live up to, but still, very subdued for an American IPA. The hops are primarily in the flavor and bitterness - they add a pleasant but not overpowering floral/citric/spicy character to the toasty, slightly caramelly malt flavors. A lingering bittersweet flavor finishes it off. Because of the lack of full frontal citrus assault and medium body, you can drink a LOT of these. Not the first choice for a hophead by any mans; however, if your tastes lean toward a more restrained IPA, it's a fine choice.","sponberg","Feb 01, 2003"

Light leafy hops accent each taste without being over-the-top. Flower Power is best consumed with a clean palate, as it might be overwhelmed by following a hoppier beer. Good session brew or thirst quenching starter brew before moving on to something more substantial.","John","Sep 17, 2002"
