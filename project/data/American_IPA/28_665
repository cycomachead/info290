3.75,-3.6,4.75,4,3.25,4.5,3.75,"Overall: If like most of us that started with the BMC adjuncts, but has a preferred taste for PBR and its fruity sweetness, you will enjoy this with its ""less than insta-hangover"" quality. I can see where this was a hit after decades with Bud and Miller. Todays standards, it doesn't seem high quality or over the top. But I can see this as an American style that screams ""I'M FUCKING PATRIOTIC AND THIS BEER SAYS 'MURICA!"". Though, it's not a Sam Adams.","iRaven99664","Mar 23, 2015"

This was the second Cascade-based beer I'd had in this session (Saltaire Cascade being the other) and the Anchor pretty much blew the Saltaire brew away in terms of both smell and flavour. There are undoubtedly better IPAs out there, but if you're looking for a toe in the door of the American IPA style then this is as good a place to start as any.","interzen","Feb 06, 2015"

4.18,7.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"i dont care what anyone says about anchor, they still make some wonderful beers, and liberty ale is at the head of that list, with its rich red malt base, glowing amber in the glass, and its huge hop palate, shocking to the masses no doubt when it was released, but not fitting rightly into the ipa category range. i like the fusion here, its got an english type ale yeast that imparts a lot of flavor, along with great dryness of feel, but its also hopped like a west coast ipa, a cool blend of traditions and entirely its own. i like the amber malt base, it isnt the least bit sweet, but its a different launching point than we usually see for the cascade hops, which are everything they usually are, bold and bitter, fresh and dramatic. the grain does balance that all the way through, and the english yeast is a great touch. carbonation is soft and not aggressive, but it is prominent and more than enough. the body is medium but filling as it warms, and the finish is long and bitter and distinct to this particular beer, ipa may have evolved beyond this in some ways, or at least the american beer geeks palate has, but this stands as a baseline for what good american hoppy beer should taste like, and it always makes me happy to go back to this one. a staple in the american craft scene for me, for some reason always better on draft.","StonedTrippin","Oct 13, 2014"

AROMA: floral and citrusy hop and esters aromas reminescent of grapes, oranges and some piny and resinous character. some sweet malt background. APPEARANCE: medium gold color and clear. nice moussy head of a slight ivory colour that persists. TASTE: citrusy and piny flavours more faint than the aromas. sweet malt background. medium-high bitterness that lingers into a dry finish. PALATE: medium-light body with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a nice APA that promisses in the aromas but doesnt deliver much in the flavours.","titvs","Sep 23, 2014"

However, based on the ratings I guess people understand the difference between these two. Liberty being a recipe from the 70s the light hop profile is understandable. This is an IPA when you're looking for something more subtle. Anchor IPA is much more akin to what modern western IPAs have evolved into. It tastes a lot like Torpedo. I guess I get the love for Liberty, it's like Steam was hopped a bit. But I still don't understand the non love for Anchor IPA, sure the market is saturated but it's good.

A light amber in color with sweet hops and sweet malts on the nose. Taste of light caramel and biting bittering hops with an acidic yet somewhat creamy taste. Lot's of hop bitterness on the aftertaste, more caramel sweet notes as it warms. A very good ipa style beer, and an excellent session beer for the hop head. It is a treasure for it's longevity in the brewing world from a solid brewery that still makes steam beer as well as a multitude of other styles. Cheers.","Brutaltruth","Jul 02, 2014"

Good balance, light overall flavor and feel. It definitely belongs in San Francisco, where it can go down easy in sun, fog, rain, or everything in-between.","TangTKE402","Jun 26, 2014"

Although not great in todays craft world, I reckon this was mind blowing back in 1975. Something I will consider grabbing again if Im in the mood for a english style pale ale/IPA. In fact, having had their porter as well, I think Anchor does English style beers justice. The price is right, too.","Bone53","May 31, 2014"

Pouring produced about 1/2"" of white head which lasted for about 2 minutes, leaving some modest spotting and lacing down the glass. The beer's aroma was primarily of grapefruit, with some other unidentified tropical fruits present...a bit subdued but nice all the same. Its taste was again dominated by the grapefruit, but with an increasingly noticeable orange flavour as the beer warmed...much more enjoyable through the second half of the bottle with a better balance between the bitterness of the grapefruit and sweetness of the orange. Liberty had a dry, bitter finish and the bitter grapefruit lingered for several seconds as an aftertaste. The carbonation was perhaps a bit prickly in the back of the throat to begin with, but mellowed as the beer warmed. I would describe Liberty as light bodied, and at $2.00 per 355 ml is quite reasonably priced. A refreshing beer that I would go to again, but next time I'll let is sit for 10-15 minutes after I take it out of the fridge.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

3.84,-1.3,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a pint glass. An American IPA from well before the era when American IPAs became cool, this beer is a light flaxen amber color, just shy of bronze, with a decent quantity of off-white head. Releases a bright, fizzy hops-forward aroma of yellow grapefruit and lemon citrus rind, currant leaf, and clean grainy malts. Palate is quite bitter, perhaps more than expected on the basis of the preconceived notion that a brew predating the current era of hop bombs must be quite mellow, with plenty of bright green grass and lemon hop flavors. Indeed, this may be one of the most lemony brews I've had in terms of this particular flavor standing out ... There's some grapefruit and tangerine as well, white pepper, and ample Cascade hop character. The malts put in an appearance as well, some toasted caramel and even a little sultana fruit in what is otherwise a pretty dry and bitter (but not coarse) finish. Carbonation is assertive but this works well with the overall intent, which is to showcase green hop flavors without a lot of background sweetness. Obviously a classic brew and any IPA hardcore should try this at least once, if for no other reason than the historical context it provides. My view is that this beer is worth a taste on the basis of its own merits, though. Fits somewhere between pale ales and modern West Coast IPAs.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 29, 2013"

It has plenty of hop character but I think my favorite part of this beer is how the lightly toasted grain combined with the fresh mint and the honey. The fact that it wasn't smooth as silk made it even better to me. The bitter was strong but not aggressive and I really liked this one. You drink a few of these easily.","utopiajane","Sep 13, 2013"

The flavor is very hoppy but the texture is thinner then I was expecting. I know this generally reviewed pretty highly but I just find the flavor to be a little off for a pale ale but maybe it’s the flavor pine that I’m not as used to. This is one of the few brews that didn’t live up to its high rating for me.","Lemke10","Apr 12, 2013"

But the thing is, a lot of these brands don't distribute around my parts, so brews from Sierra Nevada or DFH aren't really in the cards for me, but luckily Anchor brewing is. Last weekend I picked up my first sixer of Steam Beer and was really impressed, so I figured I'd grab Liberty Ale this time. The result? Another solid, tasty offering from a brewery I probably should have familiarized myself with a long time ago. Something tells me I'm going to be seeing a certain porter in my fridge next weekend...","Converge","Feb 09, 2013"

It is virtually handmade by the brewers of Anchor Steam Beer in one of the smalls and most traditional breweries in the world. Liberty Ale is made with the finest barley, fresh, whole hops, top fermenting yeast, pure water, and the simple natural meths which reflect our exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. It is ""dry hopped", a classic ale tradition and slowly completes its fermentation in sealed vats in our cellars. This unique process creates Liberty Ale's distinctive bouquet and uncommonly delicate, entirely natural carbonation.""","rickyleepotts","Jan 28, 2013"

Either way you classify it, a damn good beer, but I'm rating this as an APA, because that's what I think it to be. And as an APA it's in the top of it's class, for my money. One of the hop components I believe is shared with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA and it just makes these two beers both quite memorable for me. It's like a a citric mint charcoal bite and aroma and something else that I can't quite pit my finger on. Whatever it is, this is what turned me on to APAs and IPAs and was the beginning of my love for both. Awesome beer!

Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of hops and malts. There are some citrus notes from the hops and it smells a little grassy. It's not a strong aroma, but it is pleasing. The flavor is of citrus and hops mostly on the first sip. There is a mild hop bitterness, which isn't very strong, but does provide some balance. As it stands, this pale ale is a little sweet. There's a mildly bitter aftertaste. The body is light with plenty of carbonation. It's crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. This is very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid pale ale from Anchor. This is a good, drinkable beer.","acevenom","Apr 22, 2012"

The first sip resets the palate nicely, though. This brew is not overly complex, but it's serviceable insofar as it is crisp, refreshing, and balanced.

Hops are a lot more prominent in the taste than they were in the smell, bringing the bready malt flavor to the front. Lots of esthers make the beer sweet, but do not fully balance the bitters. Flavors are big and full, and the bitterness has a bite without being obscene. Btterness lingers into the aftertaste as a reminder of the style.

Flavors are light and effervescent, with grapefruit and blood orange citrus sweet flavors, and a mild, dry hops profile that cleans up the palate. The malty representation is mild, with a slight, full body sweetness in the backbone of the brew.

The hops run up against grainy malt with a buttered biscuit softness. Yeast adds more of an English slant with some fruit and woodiness. An old school hoppy American ale, though not so hoppy by today's standards.

Malt is more in the background and mostly dry and only slightly grainy. Ends with a distinct spice and hop bite. Moderate carbonation, medium smooth and firm body, and very, very dry.

3.68,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This pours a hazy gold with a big, fluffy two finger white head that leaves some spotty lace that can't seem to decide if it wants to stick around or not. On the nose, the hop profile is very floral, lacking the big pine or citrus notes. There are biscuity malts underneath the flowers, and definitely some raw, grainy hints, too. In the mouth the hops subside a bit and the raw grains especially comes out. There are fruit flavors, not citrusy but more generally just plain old fruit in the mouth. The body is medium with a medium finish, very well-balanced, just like the beer as a whole. Overall I think this beer is a fine, well-balanced pale ale, with the big detraction for me being the graininess that just doesn't sit well within the taste mix. Others may think differently about it and I wouldn't begrudge them that, as this is clearly a well-built brew.","EricCioe","Apr 14, 2011"

Lots of tiny bubbles working their way up to the top. Beer smells citric, briney and ever so slightly sweet to the nose, yet a bit vague. The beer tastes nicely hoppy, with lots of piney, citrusy Cascades hitting my palate, with a nice clean, dry, bitter aftertaste. Tastes a bit like an amped up Anchor Steam, more long bitter citric hops, slightly grapefruity towards the end. I can detect some slight sweetness from the barley mash, adds a nice touch. The feeling on the tongue is all smoothness, small gentle bubbles make it almost creamy. Overall Anchor is a revolutionary brewing company that doesn't try to overdo anything. What they do they do extremely well and the majority of american craft brewers could learn from them. Goes down extremely smoothly and leaves me wanting another, which I will gladly do! Anchor Brewing is definitely a destination spot I hope to visit someday.","Star80","Apr 11, 2011"

4.3,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," lemony hop flavors with tangy elelments of orange rind and slightly bitter taste of herbs with a slightly apple-jack type quality. The overall hoppiness is not over the top assertive but it has a nice clean bitterness with lots of hop flavor and only a mild amount of citrus zest astringency. The light floral hop elements are great adding to the complexity of the flavor while the malt is sturdy but not very forward either. A really great Pale, plenty of hop taste with mild malt gives light fruitiness of the yeast an effortless yet delectable balance for the beer as a whole.

Strange, considering it's called Liberty Ale. This beer is very well-balanced and somewhat complex. I'm diggin it. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and almost creamy. Not watery at all.

The aroma is much 'smaller' than many pale ales, but this is not a bad thing, as it is in fact much more refined and delicate. I don't drink that many American pale ales because I find they tend to be a bit overbalanced on the malt side, but the balance of this beer is exquisite. It starts as it means to go on, with a consistent flavor that is quite delicate and pleasant. It's hard to not quaff the whole glass in one gulp.

Gentle gauziness to the zinc orange color, fades to a dark yellow at the rims, transparent enough to see the scattered bubbles rising. Apricot and peach fruit scents strong with sourdough bread, pepper and green grasses to give it erectness in the nostrils, the orange citrus downplayed some, the malts stay off to the side, same for the pinch of honey, except for the fruitiness appears to prefer getting dirty in the earth. Medium-bodied with attractive firmness, so much so that it can afford to be slightly over-carbonated with no ill effects. The bitterness clearer here, gives you a strong twist with lemon to grapefruit pith, grass and leafy forest scrub, pepper, even the pine notes seem sour. The floral element naught but a flourish to the apricot, peach pit flavors. There might even be some estery notes underneath there somewhere.

4.43,13.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Reviewed from my notes. Poured from high above into the center of a 16 ounce fluted glass at the Lion's Pride. Liberty has a dirty, tarnished gold color. The gravity pour gave it a huge white foam head that has created a mountain of foam on top of the glass. As it settles, it leaves behind lots of patchy lace. The liquid is translucent and there isn't too much carbonation rising within. The aroma is very good, with lots of grassy and citrus hop scents. It's a little earthy as well. It isn't exceptional, very very solid for the style. The beer, once I finally taste it, makes me think of a hoppy graham cracker. It's a little bitter, a little sweet, and there are pleasant hops throughout. This is a excellent hoppy pale ale. It has a medium body. The carbonation is at a level where I can really feel it, especially when I swallow. It leaves behind a bitter and sticky coat. It isn't overly sweet though. I find Liberty to be exceptionally drinkable. It could very well be the textbook example of a drinkable hoppy pale ale (even moreso that Sierra Nevada Pale). This beer is good in any situation where craft beer is welcome, in any amount.","ToasterChef","Apr 27, 2010"

Hops provide flavours of peach, pineapple, citrus, and pine. Medium bitterness and tangy citrus linger and fade away slow in the aftertaste.

On the palate it didn't get much better; some nice malt nuttiness, angry bitterness and astringently dry. Somewhat unbalanced too. Lacking body and direction.

A very good beer, and one I would highly recommend. This is an all-purpose pleaser: good for serious flavor, and equally good for a refreshing thirst quencher, or a monster blowout session.

Little vanilla and pale malt, citrus hops bring the bitterness, a malt toastyness as well.

Flavors are well balanced, not too sweet, a pretty bitter finish (I think some of the double IPAs cancel out some bitter with a huge malt attack...not happening here, the IBUs may not be as high but they aren't masked at all).

Not overly bitter or astringent just a solid hop flavor upfront. Touch of malty sweetness. Mildly fruity. Slight lingering bitterness. Good body. A great beer drinkablility wise.

Old in the sense that they have been making a quality product for years, and feel no need to change things, much like the traditional German brewers, yet it is still very American. I can only imagine how bold this beer would have been when it debuted in 1975; it seems rather tame by today's standards, but it is still an exceptional beer.

The color was a golden straw, and just a bit cloudy. The aroma was fresh with hops and citrus, with a touch of yeast.

But the last few times I've had this in the bottle, it's been a big disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer. But it's not up to the standards I expect from Anchor, which I consider one of America's greatest breweries. The hops just don't stand out, the malt is not full or complex enough, and there are some off aromas and flavors. Body is very thin, it's under-carbonated... I can't go on-- too depressing.

Pours dark golden with a big white head that fades to a cap. The smell is all piney and citrusy hops. There is a light malt profile lurking in the background. The taste leans to the piney side, but with a grapefruit peel backbite. Mouthfeel is clean and a bit on the thin side like some of the other classic West Coast IPAs. Drinks well with its refreshingly bitter bite and huge pine aftertaste. It is essential to drink this beer fresh to really experience its glory- I'd forgotten just how good this stuff can be.

3.7,-4.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a nice, dry, flavorful beer that is good, but isn't my favorite pale. It pours a rather light orange yellow with a white thin head, some retention, little lacing. The smell is yeasty bite and prickly carbonated hop essence. The hops here are aged rather than freshly ripe and dripping with ester and oil. The taste is strongly tilted toward the hop. It is a dry, very dry beer, with some maltishness in the finish. I'm detecting some complexity in the malt, perhaps some citrus, some herbal tea like flavors. The hops do overpower a bit. This is a lightish consistency beer, but there is some creaminess to it as well, and it does get better as it settles. The mouthfeel begins rather prickly but smoothes out. The aftertaste is a bit acerbic. It's a refreshing beer. I'm definitely getting more acerbic tea like flavors in the finish as I'm nearing the bottom of the glass. I just had a Smuttynose pale just prior, and I think I will give that one the nod over the Liberty.","albern","Jan 26, 2008"

The smell is of pale malt, lemon, and a slight earthy yeast/hop combination. The brew starts off bitter but not in a citrus hop sort of way. The initial bitterness is followed by a bready pale malt and lemon twang. A tin like metallic bitterness shows in the finish. The feel is light and very fizzy, it kind of numbs the tongue. The finish for the most part is neutral but does have an odd metallic bitterness. A different sort of APA that is uniquely bitter with a lemon twang.

Aroma is a nice blend of assertive floral hops and light malt, along with a bit of sweet adjunct ingredients. Palate is well-balanced up front, with an assertive bitterness come mid-palate. Finish is nice and dry, with a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is substantial enough to convey the flavor, but far from heavy - very pleasant.

The taste was a little bit different than what I was expecting. The malts were up front and present fairly strongly with nice hints of hops that offered to balance the beer even though the malts were much more evident. As you drink more of the beer, the hops begin to recede into the background of the beer, becoming more of a nice aftertaste than a balancing taste with the malts. The mouthfeel was pretty solid and full-bodied. Overall, the beer was fairly drinkable; easy to drink and very smooth. The taste was crisp and refreshing as well.

But when I swirled it around, this nice juicy fruits aroma emerged. Other than that it was just a simple hops and fruit aroma. Up front in the taste were those juicy fruits and after all that, I noticed some grains, little malt, and this all ended with a slight bitter hop taste.

It is very carbonated, it is not as dark as other west coast pale ales, but it is looks just as delicious. Nose is very fruity and floral, clean yeast is in the nose, slight grain, but mainly fruit, flora and yeast.

I'm mad I poured this straight from the fridge as I know it needs a while to warm up since I can't pick up a whole lot in the aroma/flavors.

Nose is a very elegant tangerine-orange-peach combination with pine and hops peeking through the front end of this brew. The presentation on the tongue reveals robust fine carbonation and a solid bitterness and moderate dryness, quite well balanced. Flavors of lime and to a lesser degree lemon appear in the taste and linger long enough to suggest that this beer is well flavored and well permeated with hopping. The mouthfeel is bright and lively; partially due to the fine carbonation as well as the copious citric element present, this keeps the drinkability factor somewhat elevated. Although this is a well-engineered brew, true to the style, I would like to see a bit more body and warmth, but the less endowed nature of this particular selection is likely to continue this session a little further into the evening!","barknee","Mar 09, 2006"

Taste is more of the same, a nice full pale malt with a hint of caramel, giving way to a slightly fruity and nicely hopped finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbontion, slightly dry. This is a solid pale ale, but nothing really stands out about it, and the fact that there are readily available local substitutes usually keeps me away from this one.

Citrus-inflected flavors dominate too, but in a far less astringent way: mellow orange (not yellow) and sweet ruby red grapefruit juice. Light doughy malt presence -- noticeable only in the ""even-keeled"" hop temperence acheived, so I guess I don't really detect much malt -- this is all about the hops. But this is not out of line! Unlike any other beer I've tasted, and unlike anything I was expecting -- almost a revelation! Clean, juicy mouthfeel and incredibly easy to drink.

Appearance is quite solid -- the beer itself is a beautiful just-shy-of-clear orangey amber, and the head is substantial at first, although it eventually fades into a thin white film on top of the beer. Smell is full of those great citrusy Cascade smells, but there's also some creamy notes in there. Taste is outstanding -- sweet and sour hop flavors combined with the malt mean that every part of your tongue is active with this brew. There's no acrid feeling to this beer -- just spicy, flavorful hops. Extremely well balanced. Mouthfeel is a rarity, in a good way: this beer, according to the bottle, contains no artificial carbonation, and it certainly feels that way when drinking it. There's a very fine carbonation, enough certainly to tickle your tongue but no large carbonation bubbles... it's the difference between California sparkling wine and Champagne (with Anchor Liberty playing the part of Champagne, duh). Overall, a wonderful, quaffable beer.","geexploitation","Feb 06, 2006"

Malt is sweet and estery, with a strong toasted character; and herbal hops wash over in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel never becomes dry, but also never gets slippery...very smooth. Medium body and a light, even carbonation. Finish retains some mild ester, and hints at diacetyl, but totally approriate and balnced for the style.

After a few more sips the malt flavor starts to come out, but it is still a bit timid. The beer feels slightly thin, but not bad overall. There is plenty of carbonation present in the mouthfeel.

The taste is a actually a bit harsh, dominated by a hop character that doesn't appeal to me. Very bitter and full of a rotten fruitiness that dominates a malt base that is looking to come forward, but is never really able to. The abrasiveness lingers through the finish. This beer doesn't work for me as an APA because there isn't enough blance between the hops and malt and it doesn't work as an IPA because the hops just don't taste good enough.

The smell is what you would expect for a Pale Ale--plenty of robust english and american hops to go with some enticingly earthy malts. First taste is delicious--the malt flavor is sweeter and stronger than I expected, and is very tasty. I detect a prominent citrus note, perhaps the result of some cascade hops present in the boil. Mouthfeel is excellent; let there be no doubt, this is a man's brew.

Flavor wavers between sweetness and bitterness, with a pleasant tingly bite at the start. The real beauty here lies in the gentle leafy character of the hops! So wonderful! Fades into a light citrus and cocoa aftertaste that seems a little muted. This is a very enjoyable, everyday type of beer. While the stupid bottle codes bother me, I will still buy this every once in a while.","waughbrew","Sep 16, 2005"

The taste was of a very, very slight smokey caramel/malt/honey and finished up with a bitterness from the hops. The after taste stuck around of a bitter hop.

In recent tastings it proves to be a perfect example of an aromatic brew. Aromas of Cascade hops, ale yeast fruitiness, and malt background make for a great beer to keep under your nose. Fine(small bubble) natural carbonation and a creamy head give a quaffable mouthfeel. Some feel this beer should be labeled an IPA instead of a pale ale. Take into account this beer's birthday, April 18th 1975(I was 4) to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Paul Revere's ride, well before american IPA's gained popularity.(Ballintine IPA maybe?)

The carbonation level is slightly lighter than average, but it's fine that way. Liberty Ale has that crisp hop bite (from one or more of the Big C's, probably Cascade) and fruity citrus flavors that you'd expect from an American Pale Ale. It tastes so smooth and creamy and it has plenty of bitterness to keep it interesting. This is as much the benchmark Pale Ale, in my opinion, as SNPA.","goschool","Jul 03, 2005"

The smell is raw, herbal/medicinal hops with a mildy sweet, honey-like malt backbone. The taste is quite complex (as expected from anchor) starts with an earthy hoppy flavor that coast the mouth with a resiny hop oil, and continues with sweet honey like malt taste. The malt taste is almost like doughnuts, and ends with a bitter, grassy and floral hops finish that lingers on your tongue briefly, you really get some complex hop flavors here with a spicy flavor that follows a fruity citrus like taste. The hops definately outshine the malt here but what did you expect from an APA, from the west coast no less. The mouthfeel is smooth and light with moderate carbonation. An excellent APA, really showcases that western hops flavor well without overdoing it. Could be a great session brew as the alcohol hides itself fairly well.","silver0rlead","Apr 27, 2005"

The aroma is a delightful balance of malt, good hops, with some citrus and other unidentified spice. The taste is initially sweet malt and later hoppy, grapefruit-bitter, balanced underneath with biscuit malts. The citrusy/spicy bite makes this a crisp refreshing brew, a staple. A balanced ale, of the quality I have come to expect from Fritz Maytag and Anchor. Keep this on hand for guests...or myself.","Citadel82","Apr 26, 2005"

Some creamy pale malt leads to toasty and biscuity flavors. Finishes slightly bitter with a hint of alcohol. This beer is remarkably creamy and dry. Low carbonation increases the creaminess and thicker mouthfeel. This is an APA for people who aren't quite hopheads. Even if you are, you can still enjoy this easy drinking beer.

The flavor has less of the grapefruit flavors and more of the pine resin aspect. Finish is slightly bitter.

The body is perfectly translucent, a little paler than a lot of the other APAs Ive seen and visually nearly devoid of carbonation bubbles. The head is aggressive and eggshell colored, I couldnt even pour the whole twelve ounce at once, when I finally get it poured it gives that domed ice cream float appearance that I so love. Bright white lacing literally sheets down the sides of the pint. This is definitely a great smelling APA, all the right piney and citrus notes on the nose backed by a candy sweet, bubble-gum/cotton candy malt smell with a little pepperiness hanging behind it. The flavor bears witness to the nose, up front is packed with candy sweet malt, which slowly lets the dense, flat bitterness come through, and then the citrus flavors of the hopswithout ever truly letting go of its foothold. The mouthfeel is softly carbonated and lightly slick. From what Id heard of this brew I was expecting hop-tea, but really it is more of a barleywine-lite, much more well-balanced than what I had expected and the malt flavor is superb (dont forget the hops, they were great too!).","FormatKid","Dec 10, 2004"

Taste is extremely well balanced with a small hop kick giving way towards a huge wall of caramel malt before backing into a hoppy aftertaste. Nice experience. A very solid beer from Anchor Steam.

Disipates to a little less than two fingers, but still hovers like a thick, beautiful cloud. Bit of an orangy-gold colour, with a hazed chill. Lace lightly sticks to the glass. Light fruits, raw honey, honeycomb and biscuit malts, grassiness, yeast, hops and even a bit of sprig mint on the nose. Taste starts out biscuity sweet, with malts and honeycomb. Then it changes to an earthy, flower and grass taste. Aftertaste is bitter fresh. Grass and bitter hops, with a bit of sprig mint that's a bit off. Reminds me of a menthol cigarette. Had to take a half point for that. Finishes dry and raw. Definitely could tell this were dry hopped. I couldn't drink alot of this at one time, but I could still enjoy this occasionally.

The taste is enjoyable but shows more citrus and tart than I expected. Floral notes of honey, hints of pine, and a whole bouquet of citrus: some lemon, some orange peel and a full grapefruit aspect, with a pronounced tartness. The mouthfeel is enjoyable; very floral and fruity hops bring a complexity without making the beer overly thick. This beer reminded me a bit of a mojito, probably in the citric and grassy/minty aspect. I like the floral hoppiness a lot, but I don't like the excessive aspect that much.

Starts big with gravelly mouth feel that mellows to a sandy hop wallop (still not too over powering of the ample malt body)...flavors of peach, pear, lemon grasscomplex, controlled astringency with solid underlying malt spinefinish is a slowly bittering affair as the malt drops away completely and the complex hopping leaves a dozen different impressions on the tonguelike 4 or 5 different metals wadda ale!

Still, I did like Liberty Ale quite a lot. I didn't smell to much other than hops, but the appearance is an excellent orange copper with a think head. My first couple of sips of Liberty Ale seemed too bitter, but I quickly settled in and began to enjoy. Beneath the hops I tasted a little citrus and perhaps some spice.

Pretty good head retention overall. The smell was kind of like an old boat with hops. I don't know where that came from, but that was the first thing I thought of.

4.01,3.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Ive only had a couple bottles of Liberty Ale before, but I like this brew. Liberty Ale pours with a great frothy head that is about three quarters of an inch high. The color is clear amber-bronze. The head hangs around for a rather long length of time and eventually lowers to a thin lace. The aroma has a slight amount of caramel malt with hops being more predominant  slight citric/grapefruit hints. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. There is a light smooth malt start with just a hint of caramel. The hops are great! Towards mid swallow, the hops come in but dont completely hide all notions of malt. There isnt an overwhelming hop bite that takes over the beer, rather, the hops seem to fade in gently and take over. Hops are fairly citric, somewhat juicy and linger into the dry finish. The aftertaste is also of hops but is restrained with malt becoming slightly evident again. Overall, Liberty is quite well balanced, but definitely leans towards the hops. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable brew that is great for most occasions and worth keeping in the fridge on a regular basis.","byrd","Sep 26, 2003"

This beer finishes with a nice pleasing bitterness that hits ones tongue. At its best this beer is overflowing with American hop character, a wonderful hop-citrus character. Backed by a solid amount of malt backbone that helps this pioneering beer stand tall. Unfortunately this beer does not travel well.

Very tasty; I would definitely drink this one again.","BeerBuilder","Apr 10, 2003"
3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Color is a solid golden yellow like honey, recieved a foamy white head about two fingers high with some divets and settled slowly. Smell of this is crazy floral hops, cascade variety with a mix of woodish others, citrus peels of lemon and/or grapefruit, you can tell right away this is gonna be a bitter one. Taste is like someone just peeled a fresh grapefruit, super piney and fresh as hell. Crisp. Tightly bitter, short, leveled, and citrusy stuffed. Slightly sour grapefruit, strong hop bite, pale, and nearly dry as dirt. Feel seems crisp and lighly medium with a clean bite and the malts take a far back, second seat with a slight toasted realm. Drinks down just fine and could easily be quaffed enough until it becomes almost normal to the buds.","tavernjef","Apr 07, 2003"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is yet another exceptional beer from the Anchor brewery. Pours a clear amber/copper color with a medium sized rocky head that retains itself for the duration, leaving a light lace on the glass. The aroma is full of cascade hops, citrus peel, and just a hint of raisins. Taste is extremely hoppy intermixed with some citrus flavor, possibly grapefruit. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is definitely a great session beer that can be enjoyed any day of the year.","Scooter77","Mar 31, 2003"
4.55,17,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"A classic! It's slightly hazy (bottle-conditioned) golden-amber body is topped by a frothy white head that holds really well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. Dry-hopped Cascades saturate the nose - perfumey, floral, lemony, and pine-like over some lightly caramel-tinged grainy malt. The hops are 'softer' from the dry-hopping, however, and not as 'sharp' as if they'd been added to the kettle. It's luxurious! The body is medium; and it's lightly crisp and then smooth and creamy in the mouth due in part to a very fine, natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. Cascades carry over into the flavor in a big way; wrapped in sweet, caramelish malt and backed by a firm bitterness. It's very well-rounded and nicely balanced, without the aggressive edge that many beers like this have. Absolutely worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Mar 29, 2003"

I’ve never been a big fan of Anchor products, but their Liberty Ale is the cat’s pajamas. It is a deep golden color, with an off-white head, with great staying power. The aroma is almost perfect, fruity, perfume, hops, flowers. The taste really shows off the cascade hops, with tremendous smoothness, leaving a very clean dry finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat hop/oils, very pleasant. Damn fine beer.","jackndan","Mar 20, 2003"

4.08,4.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A classic American Pale Ale. This one pours out to a slightly hazy dark golden with orange highlights, forming a dense whipped off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is inviting with lots of fresh, floral, spicy hops...nutty and lightly toasted grains, and a mild amount of fruitiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and pillowy soft with a light body. Taste begins interestingly enough, with chewy, toasty malts. Caramunich graininess is noted, but not dominant. The hops come in, loud and aggressive, but never bitter, completely in balance with the malt. There is a corn taste towards the end, but it is rather pleasant, and I think secondary to the fermentation. Alcohol is completely unobtrusive. No off-flavors noted. Belches are pleasantly hoppy with some graininess. The finish is very soft and wet with pleasantly lingering floral hops and sweet malts. Very nice finish. As it warms, I notice some tannic astringency and caramel in the finish. This is a rich and filling beer, not as drinkable as my favorites, but it can stand on it's own as a good session brew.","Mitchster","Mar 19, 2003"
4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"A pleasant ale and easy to drink, but nothing out of the ordinary. Pours with a nice white foamy head, but it does not last long. For the wood workers out there, the color is close to orange shellac crystal. A crisp hop and citrus flavor with a mild bitter after taste which is to be expected with this type of ale and remains making you want to take another sip. Definitely worth a taste.","gjh","Mar 15, 2003"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This brew poured a hazy copper color. The head was white and fluffy and the lacing was decent. It had a good aroma with floral hops jumping out the most. There was also a fairly strong citrus aroma. Sweet malt was barely detectable but it mostly cosisted of hops. Same with the taste, very hoppy. The citrus flavor hit up front followed by a strong hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was a bit sharp at first although it went down fairly smooth. I wasn't expecting to much from this beer but I was pleasantly surprised. This would definitely be a good beer to drink during the hot summer. I will surely drink this one again.","Bruiser81","Mar 12, 2003"

4.07,4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bountiful head with good lace retention on this slightly cloudy orange brew. Mostly hops with some apricot and peach come through in the smell. The taste reflects the smell, but the fruit flavor is very subtle. The bitterness is very nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness and an adequate level of carbonation to make this a tasty brew. I found this very enjoyable and easy to drink. It tastes almost as if this is the older more sophisticated brother of Magic Hat #9, because it has a much more complex taste, without all the fruitiness. Overall, a very enjoyable American Pale Ale.","BittRnessabounds","Feb 25, 2003"

4.42,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Aside from the occasional holiday brews, this is the best beer in an all-star line from Anchor Steam. It pours an amber-copper color with an average head. The strong aroma is reminiscent of stone fruit (cherry and peach) and citrus (grapefruit). Liberty Ale provides a middle-of-the-road hops experience, with a nice fruit-caramel balance. Although every brew is technically unique, this one really stands out. Its closest availability is at a liquor store about 40 miles from my home. I don't consider that too far, for Liberty Ale.","LiquidBreadMan","Feb 08, 2003"
4.57,17.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a slightly amber tinted golden, with a light white head that fades to a thin covering layer. Aroma is interesting, hops evident with light perfumes and a good dose of spicy hops. Taste is also quite interesting. Regardless of reputations, this is my first time trying Liberty Ale, and it leaps out to me as exactly what an APA should be. Flowery hops merely flesh out the spicy hop flavours, with quite a bit of sweetness to keep that all in check. Light (in a good way), refreshing, and ever so good. A fabulous beer, and a permanent fixture at the LCBO, so I have a new option for backup for when I can't find anything new.","the42ndtourist","Feb 02, 2003"

A great amount of fruit aroma that is unbelieveable. Within in the first sip, the sweetness of the malts dominates the flavor, but a great taste of citrus hop flavor fills the senses balancing this beer perfectly to the likings of my taste buds. I will put it like this, this beer is so fine if it were a woman, I would drink it's bathwater. An great classic taste that is amazingly drinkable.","WVbeergeek","Jan 17, 2003"

Nice lace presence. A very noticeable fruity, citrus taste. I've seen Liberty Ale referred to as the ""quintessential micro brew", and I have to agree. This is one of the beers that I buy consistently, but not as often as I used to. Somewhat tame compared to many of it's hoppier counterparts.","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 08, 2003"

I would have no problem making this my house ale. It's a nice session beer in winter and would make a great companion to any summer BBQ.","luvND","Jan 06, 2003"
4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Another quality offering from the folks at Anchor. A somewhat cloudy, brownish appearance with a citrusy aroma. The white head eventually gave way to just a slight layer of foam. Very pleasing mouthfeel (due to the carbonation?) as well as a flavor that is crisp and would be well-suited to a spicy meal. I have yet to be disappointed by the Anchor beers I have tried and the Liberty Ale certainly deserves a top 50 ranking. A very balanced beer.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jan 04, 2003"

Peaches, apricots, citrus, with perfect integration--nothing stands over or above anything else.

Strong citrus notes in the aroma, with a definite hop spiciness. I can smell hints of the aroma as it sits on my desk. This is a complex beer, with malt, citrus, and peppery flavors intermingling. The finish is heavy on the citrus notes. (I would imagine Cascade hops were used heavily in this beer.) The mouthfeel is very full and solid, as to be expected by the film left by the head. Carbonation is very fine bubbled, which I think helps contribute to the excellent mouthfeel. With the rather clean finish with the citrus aftertaste, I imagine this beer would go great with spicy foods. It's very drinkable, and I wish I had tried this one sooner.

4.62,18.8,3.5,4,5,4.5,5,"I'm a bit surprised. When I read the label talking about a big hop boquet, and several reviews describing the hoppiness of this beer, I suspected they were a bit dated. It had been a while since I last had this beer, and let's face it, this beer has been around for a *long* time -- 1975! What with all the Ruinations and whatnot which have come out since, I figured any pre, say, 1995 beer which proclaimed itself hoppy should be taken with a grain of salt. But hey. I was wrong. The aroma isn't overwhelming, but it *is* very hoppy and quite nice, with just a hint of malt sweetness to it. And the hop flavor makes itself known throughout the whole mouth. Great use of Cascades lend a nice floral, lemony flavor to the palate, and a oily smoothness to the mouth. Well matched by an underlying malty sweetness with a crisp dry finish. A bit cloudy in appearance from the bottle fermentation, with a light gold color and a thin wispy head. This is a beer that has stood the test of time.","mzwolinski","Nov 22, 2002"

Fruity aroma with a citrus hop twang and sweet and sour malt in the background.  Well-balanced is the keyword for the palate!  Smooth hop bitterness and sweet biscuit-like malt blend together just perfectly.  Slightly fruity and almost lemony.  Slight rind-like effect too, especially in the aftertaste.  Mint pops up as well in a light mint-like effect on the mouth.  This hits me as an American-style pale with a bit of English-style thrown in.  Very tasty.

This is one of those beers that you can never tire of (assuming you like it to start), the flavor doesn't bore you, or eventually overpower you.  Drinkability is high (too high?)","doho95fu","Aug 26, 2002"
4.5,15.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Flavorful and biting mediumish body.  Damn fine.  A must find.  I cannot belive I drank Liberty out of the bottle for so long.  Now I know the meaning of beer.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 30, 2002"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"very flavorful with the hops hitting you right away. The taste was a complex as the aroma that finished off with a dry bitterness. Great copper color with a hugge white head that quickly vanished.","Reverand","Jul 08, 2002"
3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not bad on-tap, but much more preferred in the bottle -- seems to be hoppier in the bottle and all the flavours pop out more.","Todd","Jul 06, 2002"
4.25,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Note to self - do not bring this out with the cousins around, unless you have more than 2 bottles. This poured out a lovely copper color with a cloudiness that made me think of a wheat. But not that wheat taste though. Definitely a citrus taste with enough hop flavor to give me a jolt! So refreshing too!","MTMugs","Jul 06, 2002"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a nice reddish gold color with a nice fluffly off-white head that left some lace.  It had a nice hoppy and citrus/floral aroma.  A decent amount of carbonation.  A flavor of malt and lightly of hops.  A slightly dry finish too it.  A good beer.","Wildman","Jul 03, 2002"
4.32,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours with a finely carbonated white pillowy head. Beautiful hazy gold with the lightest of amber highlights coming through. Wonderful fresh and perfumy Cascade hoppiness is evident in the nose. A smooth interplay of malt and hops follows the first swallow. Finishes long and luscious, with ongoing bitterness that fades out longingly. One of the American microbrewing classics, also has the best label in the business!","beerluvr","Jun 22, 2002"
4.7,20.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"One sip and I was in heaven. It has enough hoppyness and sweetness to bring it together as a great beer. This by far is Anchor Steam's best beer!","BeerManDan","Jun 20, 2002"
3.68,-5.4,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"While not a fan of Anchor Steam my wife bought me this brew and I said what the heck lets try it.  I was very surprised and ejoyed it, not one of the best beers I've drank but would purchase and drink again.................CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 15, 2002"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Semi-clear amber orange color, head is around 1/8 of an inch, mostly small but separate bubbles.  Slightly sweet aroma, mostly of a raisin-bread type of smell.  Flavor is pretty neutral, good balance of brown sugar-like malt and a good hop counterbalance.  Nice mouthfeel, if the beer suffers from anything, its a lack of an assertive tone.  A little pepper and spice but as with Anchor Steam, almost too well-balanced to me.  Good beer, maybe a session American Pale.","ADR","Jun 13, 2002"
4.3,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy light orange in hue, topped by a well retained ivory white head.  Belgian lace is left down the glass. Pungent, citrusy Cascade hop nose hits the nose at first, but minty notes and mild caramel malt sweetness follow.  Although quite appetizing, the aroma isn't quite as good as the tap version, which screams dry - hopped Cascade. The overall flavor epitomizes what a good APA should be-- the hop bitterness is assertive, yet a firm, dextrinous malt backbone provide support for the hops.  The hop flavor is all Cascade, with a pleasant and mellow grapefruit note asserting itself.  The finish is dry due to the low residual malt sweetness with a crisp and satisfying hop bitterness.  Liberty Ale is an American classic.  If you can find it fresh and well travelled, it's an outstanding American Pale Ale.","marc77","Jun 06, 2002"
4.45,14.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a light copper color, appears slightly hazy / cloudy but no sediment floating around like someone had mentioned in another review though. There is a slight grapefruit aroma on the nose. On the palate there is notes of grapefruit, citrus, slightly spicy perfect hop / malt balance and natural carbonation which makes it exceptionally smooth/slightly spicy tingly but very refreshing and easy to drink. Overall excellent brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 02, 2002"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Straw gold in color with a huge, dry-hopped bouquet of perfumy hops. Complex palate with several kinds of malt, hops, spices, citrus, and apricot flavors.  A worthy effort and should be on any ale lovers must try list.","stoutman","May 24, 2002"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer is a hazy golden with fine sediment floating around. Rocky white head. There's some big grapefruit on the nose. Very piney on the palate. Spicy. And oily. A little resin kick adds some ooomph. I don't get a lot of bitterness though. Light to medium in body. Malt character is sufficient and slightly caramelly and bready. Solid IPA.","Bighuge","May 20, 2002"
4.08,4.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a pale golden color with a creamy white head.  Smell is of floral hops and some lighter malts.  The first thing to make an impression on the tongue are the floral hops, but as they slowly fade the great malt backbone of this beer is displayed.  Great creamy and smooth mouthfeel and the brew is very drinkable.  Great APA, not just another cookie cutter super hopped APA.  This beer has it's own character.","Murph","May 18, 2002"
4.75,22.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"A sentimental favorite for me. This beer was my introduction into the real beer world. I bought another six, just to have around to introduce friends to better beer.  Nice straw color, with slightly off-white head. Big hoppy nose and crisp hoppy taste with a certain tartness to it. Slight fruit taste as well, big bitter finish. I love this beer on many levels. A classic American Pale Ale, compliments almost any food, and it truly refreshing on its own. A fine tribute to the April 19, 1775 and everything it represents.","StevieW","May 16, 2002"
4.15,6.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I have recently revisisted this brew and fins it is worthy of a new review. Pours a cloudy, flaxen hue with a sticky retentive head. Aromas of citrus hops and fruity suspended yeast. Smooth body supports a nice balance of citrus hop character, mild malt and mellow fruity yeast contributions. Very tasty and unique ale.","beernut7","May 12, 2002"
4.06,4.4,5,4,4,4,4,"A strong pour will force a pillowy massive and sticky head. Moderate Cascade nose. Well balanced profile finishes sharp and fruity. Easy drinking ale and Anchor's best offering IMO.","inebrius","Apr 26, 2002"
4.13,6.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Good headed beer with a slight amber tint to the color.  This is a very smooth balenced ale with a hint of bitterness at the end that beckons you to have another.  Very clean finish.  Thirst quenching, and can be great with a wide variety of foods.","frank4sail","Apr 16, 2002"
4.54,16.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Light in color, strong in taste. The alcohol is very prominent. Excellent aroma, good mouthfeel, nice solid lacing. Taste seemed to change a bit as the glass was emptied. Very complex solid beer from the brewery that started me on the road to beer snobdom. As an update. The last few bottles have been very refreshing with much less alcohol strength in evidence. A real tremendous beer from the pioneers!","Mark","Feb 23, 2002"
4.24,9,4,5,4,4,4,"I like this better than Anchor Steam.  What an aroma.  Smells like fruit, pine, and hops.  It has a taste unlike any ale I've tried.  Complex, yet simple and I can't quite put my finger on why that is.  Nice hop finish.  Leaves you wanting another one.","proc","Feb 22, 2002"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Very tasty beer, not too over the top, elegant, bit spicy, bit of citrus, bit of tropical fruit, i love this stuff, only ver had it on a couple of occasions though (not too available where i am), but its up there.","rastaman","Feb 16, 2002"

4.84,24.4,4,5,5,4,5,"Arguably, Liberty and Sierra Nevada Pale are the benchmarks for APAs as they are today. I still remember discovering this gem and thinking what a find it was 10yrs. or so ago. It's still a great brew.","John","Sep 28, 2001"
4.76,22.4,5,4,5,5,5,"This is not your average pale ale - this is the best!!!!!  I try to have a Liberty Ale two or three times a year - I don't want to get used to it.  THIS IS A TOP TEN!!!!!","gwfrankpsu","Sep 28, 2001"
4.8,23.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I need to revise my review of this beer, as it is worth more than just a line.  I must say this beer is one of my favorites.  Outstanding in all areas.  Perfectly golden in color with a white creamy head, you can smell the floral aromas wafting out of the glass.  Tremendous tasting- hops are outstanding.  This is what an American ale is all about.","AaronRed","Aug 24, 2001"
