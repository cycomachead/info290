It pours a bright somewhat haze gold with a big frothy white head that is very enduring. The smell is intense with floral and pine aromas with vague hints of citrus. The taste reflects this, lots of hoppy goodness with a little malt to back it up. In my opinion this is definitely a hop forward beer. Definitely refreshing after a long day. Usually I like my IPAs more on the citrusy side rather than floral or piny, but for this I will make an exception. I understand why this is a world class beer.","Joe_Howard","Mar 09, 2015"

Aroma is a powerful hop blast: citrus, floral, and pine. A fair amount of caramel and bread malt lies below the hoppy aroma. Taste is medium-high bitterness from citrus peel, pine, and flower hoppiness supported by a nice malty sweet ribbon through each sip. Medium body, slick and creamy, average carbonation, long, bitter finish. Nice to finally drink an archetypal IPA from a bedrock craft brewer.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

A classy light copper color with frothy beige head leaving nice rich lacing on the glass. Aroma is herbal and spicy, with some grapefruit, zesty orange, papaya, and pine undertones. Deep, rich hop flavor and a smooth, near-creamy mouthfeel. Herbal and earthy rather than aggressively fruity, although certainly there are clear citrus, peach, and pineapple notes. This fits the hop bill, heavy on Chinook and Columbus. Extremely drinkable despite the bitter resinous punch. Getting almost a cola-like brown spice in the dry herbal/woody finish. Some bready caramel malts lurk beneath the hops and this sweetness becomes more pronounced as one's tongue acclimatizes to the bitterness. Leaves a very pleasing impression of complexity and poise. Deserves its good reputation and does offer something different from other west coast IPAs.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 04, 2014"

The nose is robust and smells of hop and touches of citrus and earthy grasses and pine abound. Bitter hops greet the pallet as do a moderate but appreciated malt under current. This IPA is really quite gentle on the tongue which makes it quite easy to enjoy more than one. A nice dry finish rounds out this quality beer.","orangemoustache","Aug 25, 2014"

I do love Stone beers.","Motleydrunk56","Aug 24, 2014"

A good summer beer elsewhere but great anytime in its home town and mine. I could not give it a perfect score because I believe there is always room for improvement. However, I am definitely a fan now.","MrJoe","Aug 22, 2014"

4.35,3.1,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy rich golden color with a slight orange tint and a thin cap of white foam. A very nice looking body, but a slightly disappointing head. Scents of pine resin, lemon zest, melon, earthy hops and a faint hint of biscuit on the finish. A nice overall aroma profile that is very hop forward. Flavor begins highly bitter with strong notes of pine resin and citrus peel, with a little hint of pale malt. This moves into a fairly bitter middle with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and pith, some floral and earthy hop flavors and hints of alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and a faint hint of biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is dry with Nora of pine resin and grapefruit peel, with a faint grainy flavor. There is also a very mild, though present, pale malt backbone that barely balances the bitter hop flavors. A good IPA flavor profile that fits the classic West Coast mold. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with resinous, oily slick feel with medium-low carbonation. A nice mouthfeel that keeps the overall impression light and easy to drink. Overall this is a classic example of a West Coast IPA. It doesn't do anything new or experimental, but it does provide a wonderfully hoppy and refreshing drinking experience and highlights the general strengths of Stone's recipes and brewers. Quite the nice core offering and highly recommended.","Auraan","Jul 30, 2014"

Still, its pithy citrus sharpness ensures a high level of refreshment and drinkability as the ale concludes with resolute dryness.","BEERchitect","Jul 08, 2014"

It also has a nice thick foamy head. It has a sweet grassy smell with a slight hint of citrus. The taste is absolutely wonderful! Its smooth and fresh with a crisp bite and smooth notes of pine and citrus. I love how well everything is blended together and lays out perfectly. Truly a world class IPA! Without a doubt one of my new favorites!","AyeMito","Jul 07, 2014"

Not as bitter as I remember it. The taste seems subdued as well. Not as piney as I thought it was. I had this not too long ago and thought it was as good as ever, but for some reason it just doesn't live up to what I remember. I'm not sure if it's a bad batch or my palate has just evolved a lot.","MisSigsFan","Jun 26, 2014"

A little to sweet for me but is easy and smooth going down. A great IPA for this with sensitive taste buds!","Andyyyyyy","Jun 12, 2014"

Smells pleasant, noticeable hop smell, but nothing too heavy imo. The bitterness at the end caught me off guard first sip, but I am enjoying the heck out of it now. Not overly carbonated, great mouthfeel, almost creamy. Leaving heavy lacing left behind. Overall, I am happy to have grabbed a 6 of this very well crafted beverage, at a price I felt was fair.","MASSHLE","Jun 10, 2014"

It tastes a lot better than their other brews. It is perfected with the right amount of hops and is a bit harsh for the normal drinker. Though this specific brew is a lot lighter than its brothers. It is not to be taking lightly this is a strong beer flavorful with dark citrus and coffee residue. It is a must try by anyone and a regular basis drink in the household.","DavidLosAngeles323","Jun 03, 2014"

The flavor likewise has a solid malt backbone, but the powerful bitterness dominates, albeit without being over-the-top abrasive. The mouthfeel is resinous, but the beer is still tremendously drinkable. Overall, this is one of the beers that I think exemplifies the prototypical West-coast IPA.

Honestly I wish more ipas were still this bitter to me. Besides the bitterness the taste overall is amazing with citrus, bready/caramel malt, and BIG pine which helps amplify the bitterness. Overall, this is a great ipa and one that got me into loving the style. This is the perfect beer for the ipa lover, but if your new to the style the bitterness could be overwhelming.

4.35,3.1,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Cloudy light copper with a finger of soapy head that sticks around. Classic IPA smell: A flowery aroma with some grapefruit, orange, lemon zest, and clean crackery malt. Stone touts on the label, ""to say that this gem of an IPA is 'hoppy' would be putting it modestly."" Maybe that was true with this beer debuted, but to the modern palate, the hop level here is manageable if not average. That's a good thing for those of us who like balance in a hoppy beer. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a citrusy payload, a neutralizing malt backbone, and an oniony, earthy character that lingers in the background. I think one of the most underrated aspects of drinking beer is the aftertaste you get when you breathe out through your nose after a glass, and Stone IPA is the best beer I know of when it comes to these bonus flavors: it has a nice herbal and flowery aftertaste. Overall it's my favorite of the Stone offerings that I've tried.","itsscience","Mar 31, 2014"

You could easily drink this one over and over while maintaining a full flavor IPA. Good beer for party or casual drinking....","kcrosson492","Mar 29, 2014"

Incredibly enticing aroma of pine like hops reminiscent of pineapple greets me. The mouth is a little sticky and the bitterness prickles my tongue. When I take a sip I get a short but sharp burst of pine like hops and then some light malt to back it up. I get a nice gentle bitter fade.","Franziskaner","Mar 08, 2014"

A modicum of sweet malt combines with additional hop flavors to create a mild, sweet orange-creme nuance. The chlorophyll-leafy and green onion-like pungency and bitterness has always turned me off enough with Stone's beers not to have any urge to order a pint or buy a bottle. Some of their darker beers exhibit these qualities, but a couple actually taste pretty good. I'm seriously going to have to find out which of the hops they use offends me. Or is it the yeast? It bugs me, because a lot of people love their beers.... Then again, none of their beers below 6% abv score above 4 on here. Maybe there's my answer...

3.8,-10,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A tangerine colored body with a finger’s breadth of fluffy white head comprised of various sizes of bubbles. Average retention and generous wet lacing. Aroma is of pine, citrus (orange and lemon with a dash of grapefruit), grass, and a bit of caramel malt (hint of age on the bottle, I suppose). Flavor draws a bit more malt, but still generous doses of lemon, grapefruit, and pine up front. Bitter, earthen hops dominate the middle and finish. Lively body with perfect carbonation, dry, bitter finish. Overall, a well balanced IPA that is a great example of the style. I do wish Stone had a more robust bottle dating system (the date was wiped off this bottle), but it’s still fresh enough to be enjoyable.","eclipse54","Feb 10, 2014"

Pours a handsome hazy orange with almost notes of green in the light with a slight white head and substantial lacing. The nose is somewhat subtle for a west coast ipa. Floral and citrus hops, some pine and a little malt. It definitely smells very fresh and lively. The flavor is perfect west coast ipa. Bitter and hoppy, tons of pine and citrus. Just a little malt to offset the bitter but not so much to take away from the fresh flavors of the hops. The mouth is light and easy drinking. A little dry on the finish but in the best way. This is the benchmark for west coast ipas. If they all tasted like this the world would be a better place.","lochef81","Feb 03, 2014"

I really like their lineup and this is a great start to the world of craft beer. If you're ready to move up, give ruination a try maybe an Enjoy By IPA?

Disappointing, given that this is the first time I've actually had it. Average IPA, not worth revisiting again. However, Enjoy By and Ruination are much better efforts by Stone. I'd recommend looking for these instead.","Stevedore","Nov 15, 2013"

Lights up my tonque perfectly with small tight carbonation. Perfect level of carbonation. Taste is very sophisticated and smooth. Leaves a nice bitter finish and is not too strong, just right. Very awesome lacing with sticky bubbles ""glued"" to the side of the glass. No taste of alcohol, very well hidden in the hoppiness. The afterglass on this beer matches the original sip perfectly. How did they do this? This has been on my wish list for a while and I found it at a Whole Foods store. I really like this beer a lot! Will definitely be purchasing more.","Hops4Pops","Oct 31, 2013"

Aroma is hops and lemony citrus, and the flavor is earthy and herbal, quite bitter, and just a slight sweetness competing with that. Clocking in at just under 7% abv, the mouthfeel is slick, bracing, and moderately carbonated. Not a lot of bells and whistles on this one, and truth be told I like my IPAs a bit sweeter, but this guy is of fine, fine quality, and a great value at ten bucks a sixer. Clean, tight, simple beauty of the style.","BeerWizard","Sep 30, 2013"

Flavor follows the scents, muddled hops, muted malt presence. Nice mouthfeel, I'm sure these fine bubbles would help scrub the bitterness from my pallate... if there was any. Overall, I've had american pale ales that blow this beer out of the water. I will add a caveat to this review, I started my night out with alpha king and had this beer right after eating some crackers to ""cleanse"" my pallate. I also expected an ipa to bring more to the party than it little brother. I will be revisiting this beer, but my initial impression is that stone may be needing a facelift with this brew.","SFACRKnight","Aug 29, 2013"

This is one of the beers I always have stocked at home, and will never allow to be 86'd in the bar. I highly recommend this beer to everyone who is expanding their beer horizon. Keep up the excellent work Stone.","Adastra","Aug 25, 2013"

I can't wait to try the other ones mentioned. It was smooth for me, had a hint of sweet taste without an overpowering hop flavor. I did try and orange slice with it, and it gave an additional positive flavor to it, smoothing it out more, but not much more. Good Job Stone, you have a returning buyer.","nexumen","Aug 25, 2013"

4.02,-4.7,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Served from tap into a plastic ""bud-light"" cup at a local music club. Great IPA aroma; herbal, citrusy, slightly earthy, along with toasty bready notes. Nice thick head that dissapates into a sheet of lacing (even on a plastic cup) and a fine layer of bubbles that remains on top of the brew. Taste is pure hop bitterness! Herbal hop variety; very piney, some orange pith and grapefruit zest; malt profile is hidden under the hop barrage but very little is to be had in terms of malt complexity or residual sweetness. Very dry and assertive. Medium thin mouthfeel. Overall a very aggressive IPA and the benchmark set by Stone. I much prefer the sweeter, less herbal taste of Sierra Nevada torpedo extra IPA, or even the juicy-fruit bomb that is 'Stone's Enjoy' By line. Just my own personal tastes. Fans of a botanical, earthy, bitter IPA love this beer and rightly so.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 16, 2013"

3.83,-9.2,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average IPA, it had a pretty nice hop profile that stayed away from the heavy citrus and tropical fruit components and it relied on some nice floral hops to take the helm and I thought that worked out nicely. This beer had decent drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention and I think one or two of these would be good enough for me, the bitterness and lighter body might start to wear on me after awhile. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty damn good with the aroma doing a great job at highlighting those floral hops. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, I know IPA's are suppose to highlight the hops, but I think a maltier base would help this beer a little. I don't know if I would buy a six pack of this anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind ordering this at a bar/restaurant and I think this could pair well with some spicy food, I recommend this to any IPA lover and people who like the floral hops, I also thought it was priced nicely. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid IPA, there's some aspects that I think could be improved upon, but for the most part is was a pretty good straight forward American IPA and the more I drank it the more I liked the hop profile. This isn't my favorite IPA, but it's far from my least favorite, I would say it's a little above being right in the middle, but if I was in the mood for a floral hop heavy beer I would choose Two Hearted Ale over this. Good job Stone this is one solid IPA, I have no clue what took me some long to try it but I'm glad I finally did, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Jul 13, 2013"

The featured hop in this brew is distinctive; very clever and well-thought out of the brewmaster at Stone. Nonetheless, this IPA is not perfect (IMHO), but it is very good. Sessionable, but probably not all that great with food. I see the floral hop interfering/clashing with certain flavor profiles. Nonetheless, certainly worth trying this beer if you have never had the privilege.","BeerDocT","Jul 08, 2013"

Excellent citrus malty taste to start, followed great piney, hoppy burst. Citrusy, acidic, bitter aftertaste at the end. This is definitely one of my favorites.

Very floral and fruity with multiple layers of complexity. Perfect hop bitterness lingers just long enough. Just enough malt to balance the powerful hops. Perfect head which adheres to the glass to remind you it is disappearing by the sip. I buy it by the case whenever I can find it! I've tried many beers that are rated higher on this site, but none come close to the perfection of this beer for me. This beer has an unspeakable quality about it that is hard to describe but that I grow to appreciate more and more each year. I would buy the company if I could!","Bobby_W","Jun 28, 2013"

4.44,5.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into becker pint glass. Clear yellow-gold with lots of carbonation and a thick fizzy white head that fades a bit into a thick puck of foam. Smell is lots of floral and citrusy hops. Lots of lacing on the glass after my first sip; taste is clean malts, not quite sweet, with some citrusy hop flavors and tons of bitterness over the slight sticky malt aftertaste. A great and unique IPA, worth trying for anyone who loves hoppy beers.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 24, 2013"

The beer itself is a yellow orange and a little hazy. The smell is grapefruit, pine, tangerine, and pineapple. Taste is all of that, with grapefruit being most dominant in the beginning and the end, with the other flavors lending a hand in the middle. Body is medium, plenty of life, on the dry side, and very drinkable. This really one of the greats! Like someone else said, a bench mark. I haven't had many better.","SawDog505","Jun 23, 2013"

If there are all the light lager beers on tap all over the place I am almost sure to see this guy hidden in the mix.

I didn't find the same cocky personality in this that I have found in other Stone beers and I think I missed that. I also think that the fruit character suffered in the attempt to make it intensely bitter without provoking it sufficiently first. The malt came out more and more to show that it was indeed stronger than you might have realized. The hop character engaged you more and more as well as the expansive bitter just kept unfolding and at the end of the bottle I was mysteriously satisfied.","utopiajane","Jun 15, 2013"

4.55,7.8,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - I've had Stone IPA on several occasions, but this is the first time I've had it in quite a while. At first drink, believe it or not, I kinda felt that it tasted a little watery. But then I realized that my perception has been altered somewhat by my recent consumption of many bold high alcohol IPAs, porters and stouts. However, once I reached the bottom of the glass, I was enjoying this quite a bit, and was pleasantly reminded of my previous dalliances with this beer. Overall, this is a great beer. If you're looking for something more bold and daring, reach for the Ruination or Arrogant Bastard. But if you're craving something more drinkable, less bitter, and, dare I say, sessionable, go with the IPA!","TheBeerDog","May 26, 2013"

4.79,13.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,"I find that Stone IPA's excellence sneaks up on you. The appearance and head are fine but nothing dramatic in terms of size or museum-quality lacing or anything. The aroma is somewhat tightly wound, at least coming from the bottle, and it is subtle though nicely complex--dank hops with with a surprising, orangey-grapefruit fruitiness that tells me this beer was made by people who have a sense of composition and desire to combine flavors in an at least somewhat out of the box way. So then I drink. And drink. And it goes down so incredibly easily, but the complexity of the nose is still there in the palate, and the finish on the back of the tongue, while somewhat short, has a pleasant bite, and it is so tantalizing. Can I do that again? And again? In part because of the company's over the top ad copy, there is this sense that Stone is bad ass, but this standard IPA seduces slowly but completely. The Billie Holiday of IPAs?","Cobrito","May 22, 2013"

It's the beer that I always seem to come back to and always enjoy. It has a good ABV, but it is hidden well. The smell is fantastic and you can really smell the hops. The taste is very in your face like any IPA, but in a good way. The taste is very hoppy and with a hint of pine. This is a great beer and a staple for any craft beer drinker.","Badger72","Apr 03, 2013"

The aroma and taste are out of this world and I will be buying this over and over again. I may be in the extreme minority, but I prefer this over a Ruination. Which is kind of odd considering I love DIPAs typically a little bit more, and I still love Ruination, but this just blows every other single IPA out of the water. This is one of the beers that converted me full time to craft beer. Perfect on every level.","Roman5150","Mar 31, 2013"

When i was younger, i had Ranger IPA and thought very little of IPAs till my uncle (from California) got me a Stone sampler which included this flagship IPA. I will TRY to rate this IPA as objectively as possible... It pours a nice honey with very little bubbles. About a 2 finger creamy-white head with medium lacing. Tastes start with a strong hop presence (duh) then onto slight fruit notes, maybe a faint bit of apricot. The mouthfeel is whole and pleasant. Overall a very good IPA. Anyone who is thinking of trying an IPA, I recommend this one. Honestly, one of the best IPAs out there and one of my personal favorites, when i can get it.","Jellopants356","Feb 10, 2013"

Aroma's of grapefruit pith, lemon zest, pine and resin with a faint bready caramel to provide a hint of balance. The flavor is sweet with light bread and caramel with a pleasant hop flavor and bite. Citrus and pine mingle in a crescendo of flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. I've had this many times before and I can't believe I hadn't reviewed it yet. Great beer, and I'd drink it all the time if Stone could get it to my store before its close to or expired.","johnnnniee","Feb 05, 2013"

I think if stone revisited this they would seek a certain type of balance. It's just that the battering hops dominate more than anything else. Still a good beer but not compared to others west or east coast.","danfisher1","Jan 29, 2013"

Bitterness is there, nothing else really. Nose is decent, earthy, piney and floral with mild citrus. I wish they would have tried harder with their year-round IPA.

The favors are typical; hoppy, piney, citrus, lemony, and the lack of malt makes this a crisp masterpiece. This isn't the best IPA ever made but I can see why this is a staple for stone, glad I finally grabbed one, I waited too long.","brewtus","Dec 30, 2012"

Smells very strongly of hops, there are definite pine and earth notes along with a slight citrus. Taste is slightly malty sweet at first, but quickly fades to a strong hop bitterness. There are pine and resin characteristics. There is a nice long lingering bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly oily. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, although I discovered it is maybe too drinkable. This is turning out to be one of my favorite IPA's. It is very enjoyable and I recommend giving it a try.","scvance","Dec 28, 2012"

The head is small, has no staying power, but surprisingly laces all the way down the glass. The mouthfeel was very strong and overpowering on the carbonation - possibly the highest carbonation I've tried to date - it just detracted from the taste. The taste itself was IPA all the way - something I've come to terms with that I'm just not a fan of. Overall, it's a good beer, but not much better or worse than the other IPA I've tried.","jjamadorphd","Dec 20, 2012"

Definitely huge on the hops (spicy, earthy, even fruity) which is always key for an IPA, and the malt cuts through the bitterness quite well. I do like this beer, but at the same time, I'm somewhat disappointed. The reviews on this site has it ranked among the best in the world, but it's just lacking something. I'm not sure what that something is, but beers like Racer 5 and Two Hearted have it ... this one doesn't. It's still a very good IPA that I'd no doubt have again, but I definitely feel that it's a touch overrated.","Alextricity","Oct 29, 2012"

4.12,-2.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A great, flavorful IPA that is packed with flavor like a double but still very dinkable. Pours out hazy, thick amber, golden with a touch of orange. Head rolls up and recedes into a thick ring. Stays with you the whole way through. The smell is a strong, but balanced aroma with a very strong hop foundation and a sweet, malty backbone. The Flavor is that of a very strong, floral hop, with a nice crisp citrus finish. Beneath it all a very sweet, but balancing malt character rounds it out nicely. Refreshing carbonation, but with a respectable heft on the mouth. Active but short-lived combination. All around great IPA that's easy to enjoy at any time, and more proof that Stone just makes thoroughly flavorful beers.","BigBarley","Oct 26, 2012"

Poured slowly into a snifter, a beautiful soft, chunky head grew and settled into a lacey bead that lingered to the bottom of the glass. The color is tarnished gold. An initial fragrance of distant pine blooms into citrus and fades to spearmint. A clean, refreshing hoppy taste that is bitter enough to get your attention without that 'punch-you-in-the-Adams Apple' bite remained fresh. This IPA is one to spend an evening with preferably watching a sunset over the Blue Ridge mountains or the ocean at Cape Hatteras. I have had an epiphany...this is one not to be neglected.","straygator","Oct 08, 2012"

I found it to be like unto cubist art, in which a single, clear perspective is abandoned in order that the object be viewed from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. There is too much happening on the palate to appreciate all of the flavors of this beer at once. Your perspective must be flexible, mobile, and willing to focus on particular aspects of the experience, perhaps at the expense of comprehending the beer's flavor in its entirety.

4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"yeah totally worth the hype. one of the most refreshing and delicious sessionable strong ipa's out there. this pours clear and bubbly, champaigne looking. it smells like intense oily hops, lots of citrus in this one. the flavor confirms, total grapefruit profile. its got the same juicy acidic tart but sweet addicting essence you get from a fresh florida pink grapefruit. its uncanny how similar this tastes to that fruit. it gets real bitter in the end, and serves a thirst quenching role to perfection. this has a great feel too, light enough in body to drink a bunch of them, but a well hidden and dangerous alcohol strength. carbonation is bright, and it makes the beer feel lighter than it is. overall a nearly perfect india pale ale, one of the best stone beers out there.","StonedTrippin","Sep 17, 2012"

While still being decidedly less strong overall, this IPA is huge on hops. They dominate the nose and palate, leaving a sticky hop residue in the back of your mouth. Hopheads rejoice! Personally, I'd take Ruination over this one, but to get a 6 pack of this one is about 5 dollars cheaper, and I couldn't fault anyone for grabbing one. It is a great beer.","TheRealBigC","Sep 04, 2012"

I can honestly say that I love everything that comes out of this San Diego based brewery.... Stone I.P.A. has such a perfectly balanced hoppy taste along with a perfectly hoppy nose to match it.... With my increased pallete for beer over the years (generally, only giving beers of a 7.5 ABV or higher a chance), this is one I can always go back to because of its increasing availability....

4.25,0.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a tumbler. Pours a medium orange amber with a one finger medium white head and lacing. Strong citrus, floral hops and light malt aroma. Flavor follows; neutral malt balancing citrus and herbal hops. Nice hoppy finish. Medium body. A nice aromatic hoppy IPA as one would expect from Stone.","LiquidAmber","Jul 31, 2012"

4.48,6.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I'm not a big IPA guy, but this is the epitome of the style. Great pour, retention, and lacing. Huge pine-scented nose. Light malt for the base, that balances the moderate hop bill well. Hops do not overpower, but provide a solid kick. Great weight for sessioning. Could throw a few back and feel great, while still getting the great flavors.","boilermakerbrew","Jul 12, 2012"
4.1,-2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Medium body, very strong tasting for a single IPA. However, it is very smooth once your palate gets used to the hops they use in the beer itself. For first timers, this is one that I highly recommend trying, and its priced just right. You can pretty much find this anywhere (depending on where you are located). Always recommend trying it in the 22oz bottles before buying 6 packs.","IPApadawan","Jul 12, 2012"
4.08,-3.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O- a reference standard for the West Coast IPA. I could enjoy it anytime, anywhere, and it really hits home when I want a very bitter IPA (but don't feel like blowing my head off with Green Flash W.C. IPA)","JWU","Jul 12, 2012"

4.59,8.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5," I'm a huge proponent of putting APA's and IPA's in the freezer for about 15 minutes before drinking them. There is just a crispness with these type of beers that is accentuated by drinking them very very cold. However, by the end of the beer, when it warms up a bit you really know what you have. Lesser quality APA's and IPA's tend to lose that crispness as well as show their alcohol content once the beer warms. So if it still tastes good and not so boozy when it warms you have yourself a real winner. And that's what you have with Stone IPA. Super delicious when ice cold..still pretty darn good when piss warm...can't say that about many beers. If you haven't tried it and enjoy hoppy beers, get on it my good people, you'll be glad you did. Good thing about this one is that you can find it at almost any liquor store. Which, in my book certainly adds a notch or two to the rating.","Melikeydahop","May 19, 2012"

As the beer was consumed, there was still plenty of head left on top as well as abundant lacing down the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts as well as plenty of pine and citrus from the hops. It's a very bright and inviting smell. The flavor is fantastic. The big malty sweetness is balanced by big hop flavors. The citrus flavors accompany the sweetness into the mouth while the piney bitterness hits the back end. It's incredibly well balanced. The body of this beer is medium to full and the carbonation is adequate. The beer coats the mouth really well. Overall, this is an incredible beer. This should be the gold standard for this style. Stone hit a home run with this beer.","acevenom","Apr 15, 2012"

4.85,14.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 2/28/2012. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, honey, and a bit of biscuit. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, herbal spiciness, floral, caramel, honey, and biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, and honey notes on the finish for a while. Very hoppy, but still has a nice malt balance to even things out. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable, with hardly any alcohol warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible IPA. Very hoppy, yet still has great balance; and is very drinkable at 6.9%.","derekmorris7","Feb 27, 2012"

Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip. This evolved into a pleasantly ligering aftertaste that was a good mix of bitterness and hop flavor.","BillH200174","Feb 25, 2012"

Other beers, like Green Flash West Coast IPA, have a more prominent malt bill, which I favor. That being said, Stone IPA is a true trailblazer. It remains one excellent IPA, particularly when enjoyed with a month or less of age on it.","hagbergl","Feb 19, 2012"

There's actually more bitterness in this beer than I remembered from before, but that's certainly not a bad thing for me. The hop flavors are delicious, with a good showing of the floral and pine varieties, which make this a very uplifting and drinkable beer. This brew has always been one of my favorites, and will continue to be one I come back to.","TechTriumph","Feb 19, 2012"

5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Stone IPA pours a golden straw colour, almost perfectly clear with a healthy head and very respectable lacing. The smell is completely dominated by the hops, but its so much more than that. Citrus and pine tones are mixed with an ever-so-slight maltiness to form the perfect bouquet. The taste is, well, incredible. The most intensely piney hops I've ever tasted in a beer (not including Ruination of course) are somehow balanced up front with the malt they've chosen. The aftertaste is almost just as intense and it's quite dry. Overall, I've already said it. A perfect example of an American IPA, and a perfect beer.","Intrinsic","Jan 27, 2012"

4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Stone Brewery in Southern California has been producing excellent beers for more than a decade and have a wide array of offerings. This IPA, though not their best IPA (in my opinion), is one with fine character. The golden color of the beer is contrasted with a off white head which laces the beer glass while drinking. The aroma, though not as pronounced as other IPAs (thinks Avery's) is nonetheless hearty with agreeable hop notes. It has a hops, earthy, and some light citrus flavor which remains on the palette even after drinking. Sure, there are many IPAs on the market, but this one is well above average, very drinkable, and remarkably consistent every time I have had it. And another benefit is that one can find the beer all over the US owing to the size of Stone Brewery (among the top 25 largest breweries in the US).","ghwolf","Nov 23, 2011"

It is a little darker than a standard macro. Smells is wonderful. I get pineapple, grapefruit, and papaya. Smells juicy. Taste is a hop onslaught. Mostly citrus coming through with noticeable pine. Overall, I think I might actually prefer this bottled. Perfect representation of a west coast IPA. The only thing keeping this from being an A+ is the lack of any noticeable malt flavor.

This is an excellent IPA, well structure and just as advertised. Those looking for something overly hopped out in order to “get” this beer don’t understand the elegance that goes into beer making and IPAs.","donovanneb","Oct 26, 2011"

4.55,7.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. The beer is hazy-golden in color, with a slim 1-finger head. This is a very aromatic beer with lots of floral and citrus notes; I also detect a little honey at the tail end. At first taste, the grapefruit and citrus flavors are very evident, as well as a noticeable hop-bitterness that is strong but not overpowering. The body of this beer is exceptional, for it accomplishes being creamy yet highly-drinkable. The carbonation is a little much, but the taste outweighs this minute flaw. In comparison to other trademark IPA's. this brew holds its own with ease.","Keithstone44","Oct 18, 2011"

A touch of pine and yeasty doughy sweet rolls. Taste super. Sizable malt front is quickly enveloped by lots of grapefruit. A nice amount of caramel and multigrain dinner rolls for a backbone. Hops are full of oily citrus notes. A bit of mint as well. Finish is very dry and long with hop oil dripping from every part of my mouth.

Many say that Stone is too bitter or hop crazy, but when you compare this IPA to others (such as Lagunitas or DFH), you notice this is much more delicate than its competitors. There are floral and fruity undertones to this beer that you just don't get with others. Now it must be admitted that I'm a bit partial, since Stone introduced me to the wonderfulness known as hops, but I think there is a reason I listened when they spoke. Stone knows what they're doing here, and anyone with taste buds will sit a little straighter and take note. Cheers!","Philousa","Oct 11, 2011"

The smell includes fresh pine and bitter citrus fruit. The taste is quite good. It starts with a nice citrus and pine push then a malt takes over then a bitterness, then the pallat clears with more malt. It is quite an interesting beer. The mouthfeel is very good and I probably could have a couple before running out of steam; higher ABV makes it tough. Overall a very good beer.","WoodBrew","Oct 08, 2011"

Taste is well balanced between the bitterness from the hops and heavy malt profile. Taste strong bitterness from the hops, sweet malts, and a citrus tropical profile. Easy drinker and crisp finish. This growler will be easy to finish before evening hits (2pm as I review). Great IPA from Stone. Makes it even better this is readily available.

Nice vibrant orange body with a fine white head. Moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell was full of hop aroma. Very potent, just like a lot of the West Coast IPAs tend to be. Taste was also mostly hops, and that lent a nice pine-like flavor to the beer. Very crisp beer, with a bit of dryness at the end. Not an over the top IPA, so it was enjoyable to drink.

The nose has all you’d expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, floral accents. These transfer directly into the flavor dept. There is a faint caramel malty sweetness which underlies a huge hop contingency. Grapefruit, citrus, and candy orange slices are noted in the mid-palate, whereas the side- and back-palate are peppered perfectly with a mildly-lingering pine resin dry-hop. All of the wonderful complexities of this brew come together almost flawlessly. It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy (and cleansing) finish that works wonders for the overall effect! Truly, one of the best IPA’s one can have.","ChrisSimpson1968","Aug 21, 2011"
4.25,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Stone IPA is an orange colored brew, medium sized white head with loads of lacing. The scent is pretty interesting and enticing. Some caramel malts, but loads of piney hop, citrusy hop, grapefruity hop. The flavor is very good too; nice sweet malt start, but the main focus is on the west coast panoply of hops.

But even within that range, it has been between good and friggin great.

4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another hop-tastic treat from Stone. A vigorous pour creates a beautiful cascading effect, and the lumpy, sticky head is also very pleasing to the eye. Hazy orange color. Soooo aromatic. Pineapple, citrus fruit, and raw, herbal hops- intense aromas. Very complex taste. Nice fruitiness and surprising sweetness. Hop character is bitter and long-lasting, and perhaps a bit medicinal. Herbal for sure. The finish dries up a little, and the oily hop feel is replaced by a more leafy one. Some spice (perhaps from the alcohol) in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery, but the hops make up for it. As a Hophead, this brew makes me very happy.","huhl23","Jul 26, 2011"
5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Jesus what an incredible beer. After having tried (and enjoyed on several occasions) some Arrogant Bastard Ale (in a bomber no less) I purchased a 6 pack of Stone IPA for $9 today. My immediate reaction? Jesus. The pour is nothing short of beautiful. A foam head at least 1"" thick comes up as soon as the beer hits the glass. The color of the beer itself appears to be the same color as honey is. The smell is definitely a lot of hops, with a strong scent of pine as well. Very, very hoppy. Taste-wise, between the intense amount of hops being present in the beer and the taste of pine and a tiny bit of grapefruit, it's one of a few beers that is actively kicking my ass. All in all, this is a beer that is automatically on my top five list.","cbonham","Jul 25, 2011"
4.38,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours with a hazy orange glow and a foamy head of at least two inches. Head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing.

Very drinkable.","CountJustinian","Jul 24, 2011"
3.94,-6.6,3,4,4,4,4,"OK, not a heavy hitter but certainly a very drinkable IPA, refreshing, one I would drink on the colder side, say around 45 degrees, and suitable for a warm summer day. The finish is the most distinctive component of this ale and definitely adds to the overall enjoyment. Average ABV for this style.

I had stone ipa ruination last week and personally I think this brew does more damage to your palate. Hops are very strong. Immediately attacking the back of your tongue. I feel like I can only have 2 of these and then I can't taste anything. Cant taste much alcohol but the buzz comes in nice and easy.

Sadly, there is so much beer to try and so little time, but today, an old classic reigns in my glass. Frilly lace upon the sides of the caravan as it travels the swivel of my elbow from the table to my mouth. Big time pine in my nose with a little bit of citrus. Drying finish, nice bitterness, subtle malt backbone, just supple enough. This is a classic for a reason. And the reason is love.","dragonWhale","Jul 18, 2011"

Thank you Stone for making me a craft beer lover.","DavidST","Jul 16, 2011"
4.12,-2.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours out a clear yellow in color with a light head on top. The aroma off the beer is decadent, floral, and really showcases those traditional West Coast hop varieties. The dry hopping allows for more prominent tones of citrus, pine, and maybe some light woody characteristics as well. The taste of the beer is similar to that showcased in the aroma, it's a homage to hops and easily overpowers the malt profile of the beer. Mostly the beer tastes of citrus and piney hops and swallows with a dry finish with lingering hop resin on the tongue. Overall the drink of this beer is great for those hop heads/IPA lovers who are more taken by the West Coast variety of the beer style.","jmvecchio1","Jul 16, 2011"
3.96,-6.2,3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Stone gets a lot of praise for the other beers that they produce, but this is an underrated example of the West-Coast IPA style.

3.95,-6.4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"As a fan of IPA (and a fan of Stone in general) this is a good but very mild IPA. Its taste is mild and smooth.

4.37,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours light yellowish orange with a nice big white head. The head disappears to almost nothing within a couple minutes but still leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell right away is hops. For just a regular IPA it's probably one of the most hoppiest smelling beers I've had. Citrus, piney, grassy, a bit earthy. Almost like holding hops up to your nose. The taste like the smell is hops. At first it almost seems balanced when it hit's your mouth but then as it sits for a second the hops take over. Citrus, pine, a little grassy. Ends with a nice bitterness and hop bite aftertaste. At almost 7% ABV it's not terribly high so multiple bottles wouldn't be a problem in one sitting. Overall it's a fantastic IPA and one I've been drinking a ton of lately. So when I can't afford Ruination this is definitely a damn good substitute. Another solid beer from Stone.","dismal","Jul 05, 2011"

3.98,-5.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pint glass pour with a great apricot colored ale with a foamy white head that looks like whipped cream sitting atop the brew. Well done. Nice fruity aroma with mangos, pears, orange and light malt. Nice bitter taste with an even bigger bite on the swallow. Big malty backbone helps to even it out and there is a long bitter aftertaste that sits well on the buds. More carbonated than I would like from this IPA. Overall this is an easy drinking IPA and each time I drink it…multiples are easily consumed. An above average IPA from a great brewery. This beer has everything one could look for in a balanced IPA.","kaseydad","Jul 03, 2011"

The aroma is not quite as full as I anticipated but there is definitely a noted floral hoppiness as is to be expected. The body is creamy and medium. Oh, but the taste really makes up for any flaws (as few as they are) that may be noted at first. Bitter hops with a fruity sweetness on the side.","puboflyons","Jul 02, 2011"

A little bit of light pine, light skunk/cat pee (though not in the light-struck sense) and promises of bitterness. Very bright and fresh pine flavors. A hint of lemon on the finish. 9/10 bitter-wise.

Stone has never distributed to where I live (though where I used to live, Kansas City, just started receiving Stone beers). Whenever I'd be in a city that has Stone, I'd always pass up the IPA in favor of bigger, rarer offerings. So this is my first Stone IPA. I wish I'd have had one sooner. It's a lovely example of the American IPA style. It'd be a mainstay of my fridge if I lived within Stone's distribution.","Reaper16","May 08, 2011"

Elegantly hoppy and bitter. Nice, playfully fresh hops with just a slight hint of malt. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Lively carbonation. Palate is all hops dancing on the tongue. Not super resiny. Just resiny enough to give the finish a long and pleasing bitterness. The hop flavors are so light, they have a more floral quality than you find in most IPAs.

Not a strong alcohol IPA, but pretty strong tasting. Bitter just the way I like it - not as much as Ruination, which is ok. Solid all the way around.

The Stone IPA pours a nice head that goes the distance. Aroma is just as it should be, very inviting, which foreshadows what is to come. Many IPA's start out sweet, then bring on the hop and bitter. The Stone has a nice blend of hop flavor and underlying sweetness from start to finish. Not much bitter to this brew. Very smooth, with a luscious mouthfeel. I give it high marks.

It's nothing I haven't seen before. The flavors are of pine and grapefruit, yet both bitter and sweet. The malt kind of becomes rather prevalent after a few sips and gives it a moderate amount of sweetness. This beer drinks between light and medium with a very, very dry finish. I hate dry finishes. I'm not a fan of induced cotton mouth and this beer brings it. It's unfair to this one that I compare it to Ruination and their 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA but this one doesn't hold a candle to either. The cotton mouth is a little much and it isn't as complex as their other aforementioned IPAs. This beer is pretty average in my opinion, as far as IPAs go.","aasher","Feb 11, 2011"

Smell is of some tropical fruits, citrus and some herbal grassy notes, and some odd glue/acetate odors in the alcohol. Hmm, not what I would normally expect from an American IPA. Fortunately, the taste comes through nicely without the strange off flavors I got from the smell, not sure if that is a by product of the yeast or what. Anyway, the taste is nice and hoppy, big resinous pine and grapefruit, and some sweet malt in there to balance things, a little. The mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, and full bodied. Wow, I am getting a real nice long bitter aftertaste, most be a lot of resins in those hops, whole leaf?? Overall, once I can get past the weirdness in the nose, believe it or not this is a great beer. So far I like their IPA best, the bigger ones get a little too rich, sweet and malty.

This is like smelling a pine tree spayed with sweet tropical juice. The taste is perfect. It simply doesn't get better than this. Dry piney hops, dry bitter flavor with a lemony finish and slight citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is light and sharply carbonated. Nothing to argue with here. This is amazing.

The beer is smooth and full bodied in mouth, with a smooth finish. Surprisingly, there are sour notes to the aftertaste and finish. Fairly easy to drink, but the sour tones make it hard to drink multiples in one sitting.","GarthDanielson","Dec 28, 2010"

Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A very good IPA.","Mora2000","Sep 11, 2010"

More of a floral secondary to citrusy hop notes in the nose. There's a good bit of hops in the nose and the taste. There's quite a bit of bready malts coming through as well. More of a citrus forward taste leaning toward grapefruit with only hints of pine. I found this to be very well balanced (what can I say, I like lots of hops.) Certainly finishes cleaner than Stone's bigger beers, but is great for the style. Not my favorite of the style, but right up there with the best of them.","alkemy","Sep 10, 2010"

The smell is a strong resiny pine hop, some mild florals and a bit of sweet light malt. The taste has an interesting body of tannins and a secondary malt sweetness that support a moderate dose of the sticky pine and florals detected in the smell. The earthy astringent tannin and bitter hop blend well together, tieing the body cleanly to the hop for a rounded full taste. The feel is perhaps a bit on the light side of moderately thick, with appropriate soft carbonation. Tasty. Lace lingers on the glass through the session.","BeerNinja007","Sep 09, 2010"

The head disapears after a few miutes, nice lacing. The smell is wounderful. The hops are INTENSE, but have another sip it keeps growing on you.

Nose opens up with grapefruit and pineapple. Settles into west coast style aroma hoppiness...Flavor is burting out of the gate. Very full and rich for an IPA. Some alcohol in there, and it carries throughout the flavor, but isn't too much. Hops are huge here, and overpower almost all else. Some hints of candied apple, and maybe some vanilla but it's masked amidst the wash of hops. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Priced well usually, so this is great everyday beer.

This co-defendant pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam, complete with a decent amount of etch-style lacing. The nose comprises plenty o' pine, grapefruit, honeydew, and rich toffee. The taste dilutes the pine up front in a wash of grapefruit, followed by a nice smattering of toffee, but then, in the finish, the pine returns for some always-enjoyed vengeance. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty dry and crisp finish. Overall, a very nice, easy-drinkin' IPA. Get some!","TMoney2591","Aug 26, 2010"

Lots of orange citrus and (to a lesser extent) pine resin jump right out in front and later linger long on the finish. In between these hop bursts, the mid palate is noticeably sweeter, with honey and caramel flavors. I pick up some floral and grassy notes as it warms. Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation; a definite palate cleanser that will stand up to any food under the sun and is a pleasure to drink.","droomyster","Aug 22, 2010"

Soft floral aroma with hints of orange and a faint hint of pine. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a crisp finish. Like the aroma, floral hoppy flavor with orange in the beginning, a brief sweet malty taste, and a hint of pine at the finish.

4.15,-1.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"22oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured a pale orange-gold with a slightly hazy clarity. A creamy/frothy, one inch bright white head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap with some thick swaths and strands of lacing adhering to the sides of the glass. Nose reveals grapefruit and resinous hops notes with a trace of caramel or toffee in the background. Flavor profile is very well balanced - some citrus astringency at the start, a little bitterness at the middle and towards the back (not as piny as suggested by the nose) and a light biscuity presence. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation that falls shy of prickly but leaves a residual tingle on the tongue after each quaff. Astringency lightly stimulates the salivary glands. A very solid and drinkable IPA with great balance. Doesn't overly assert itself in one direction which greatly accentuates the drinkability.","Jwale73","Aug 17, 2010"

Taste is more citrusy, with grapefruit rind being pretty noticeable - there is some piney-ness, too. Caramel malt is there, but this beer is definitely hop-forward. Mouthfeel is just about perfect to me. It could use a little more body, but that might deter it from being so drinkable. The finish is crisp, clean and refreshing.

The nose is full of grapefruit and pine with just a touch of pot skunkyess. Sweet biscuit malt is also in the aroma. Flavor is wonderful with loads of American hop character. Grapefruit, pine, orange, floral and a hint of spice. It's all there folks. Strong bitterness, but this beer has a solid malt backbone that keeps it from being completely unbalanced. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium with a sticky dry finish and lingering bitterness. The lighter body and dry finish makes it super quaffable. Could be hop addict's session beer if it had just a little bit lower of an ABV. Classic IPA, and one that I had forgotten how great it was. Glad I got a bomber.","zoso1967","Mar 27, 2010"

Smell is great as well, loads of hops and some tropical notes. Taste is good but doesn't really live up to the smell. I'm getting lots of grassy notes, grapefruit, in the aftertaste a bit of biscuit and surprisingly booze. A hint of toasty caramel lingers as well. Mouthfeel is a tad watery. As far as drinkability, it's good but there are probably other IPA's I'd prefer for the same price/cheaper (Titan IPA comes to mind).

I appreciate it, but the smokiness is not what I expect or enjoy in an IPA. I like the finish to be a little more sweet. With that said, this is definitely worth trying.

Taste is resiny, piney hops with a balancing pale malt backbone and a touch of honey sweetness. The finish is crisp and dry with a moderate bitterness left on the palette.

It tastes wonderful, with a hops taste, and a malt finish that creates a wonderful balance, while still maintaining the bite and bitterness that a good IPA should have.

A cloudy centre remained with a good ring, spotty lace. Smell of citrus hops, sweet and fruity, bit of rind in the mix. Taste is still hop forward although grapefruit affect muted for the most part; still there is a discernible citrus taste with sufficient bitterness and plenty of biscuit malt in the finish.

Only a hint of malt and some sweet light fruit. Tastes outright heavily hopped, with notes of dish soap predominant. Maybe it's the mixture of citrus and resin, but whatever the taste is, it's unpleasant. Gets better as it warms and as the palette gets numb to it. Pleasant sweet malt eventually shows through.

Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"".

I can taste such a great amount of hops...it really dominates my palate and not much else can pull through (in the true Stone style). Medium body mouthfeel offers my mouth tons of residuals, so that I can hang on to the bitterness. I would buy a 6er of this brew without thinking twice about it.

It smells of citrus and pine along with some malt and I'm thinking something along the lines of peach but laid back, sweet and nice instead of brassy, bold and upfront. It's deceiving though because on first sip there is definitely a sharp hop tang up front. Not all pucker power though but like the scent-crisp and citrusy with that peach thing I mentioned in the backbone. Malt shows up in the middle adding a nice balance to the the sweety tarty flavor that surrounds it.

The flavors were totally on-the-mark for an IPA, grapefruit, pine, herbal notes, a slight spiciness, pale malt and a bold but not overpowering bitterness.

All of the hop flavors a supported by a bready honey malt. A pretty serious AIPA with a bigger malt presence than most. The feel is that of a moderate body, soft to prickly carbontation and a bitter finish. The brew is bigger than your traditional AIPA.

The taste starts off with some spicy hops that give way to some citrusy hops that give way to some piney hops that fade away into a surprisingly clean finish. The whole time there's also a sweet malt backbone that helps balance out the hops without overshadowing them. The mouthfeel has a little bit of thickness and and just the right amount of carbonation. One of the big surprises for me is how drinkable this beer is. Even though it's definitely hoppy I couldn't imagine holding on to a six-pack of this brew for more than an afternoon.

I don't think it can be improved upon. Heavy hop and pine flavor with a touch of sour. Not too much sour to be unpleasant, however. Contrasts of sweet fruit, bitter hops, grapefruit, pine, and malt all exist in the flavor to create a pretty damn good beer. Medium body, a little creamy, and a joy to sip down.

Looks really great, but it seems just a little bit lighter than I'd like to see an IPA. The smell is nice, some floral, citrusy, grassy hops. Actually quite a bit of hop resin in the smell. Almost leans towards a DIPA smell. Not really much maltiness to speak of, maybe just a whiff of sweetness. It's about what anyone would expect from an IPA. The taste seems to be a bit more bitter than a standard IPA, which is my main complaint, but there's enough of the hop flavor and aroma to fill in. This one isn't incredibly balanced, I can barely detect any sweet, malty backbone, and I can't taste the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is nice, the bitterness makes you pucker and hesitate. I think this is lost somewhere between an IPA and DIPA, I like it but I'm not sure how well to either style it actually is. This one is very dry, like I would expect, with nothing standing in the way of the hoppy taste. This one really drinks well for almost 7%. You just keep taking drink after drink, and it is definitely worth a try.","taylorhamrick","Feb 25, 2009"

This is not a tongue-burner, you won't suffer from palate fatigue as with lesser IPAs. This is a go-to beer for me, it can always be counted on to deliver a great beer experience.","beertunes","Jan 15, 2009"

This ale did not live up to its reputation. Apearance and smell were average. A nice hoppy aroma was very apparant signalling a good IPA. The taste was average as well. The ale seemed to possess no balance. The consistency was very light,which I did not like. It was hoppy enough for an IPA, but something did not click for me. Other IPA's, such as those put out by Great Divide and Avery, are more to my taste.

The hops are nicely complemented by the malt and pine, and a nice bitterness follows. The taste is very well balanced and doesn't have a powerful hoppy bite. Light to medium bodied and doesn't leave a whole lot of stick in the mouth. This IPA is nice and smooth and goes down real easy.

Slight caramel and biscuit malt help to make the hops not overpowering. Nonetheless, hops dominate and create perhaps one of the finest hop flavors in any beer I've ever had.

Decent stuff I suppose, but I don't like the nose and the taste is onlt slightly above average. Honestly I prefer a simple Hop Devil to Stone, and Racer 5, and Modus, 2 Hearted blow it away. I'd take a bottle, but won't buy another 6, Ruination although a Double is far superior. Maybe it's just inconsistent or badly handled, could also be a Total Wine problem they buy in such volume no telling how long it sits is a hot warehouse or trailer.

That's what this looked like. It was love at first sight. Hops immediately present in the nose with a rich body (chomping through all the remaining foam) and slick, full mouthfeel.

This is not my first Stone and most certainly not my last. Poured into pint glass with a purty lite amber color and fluffy, frothy off white head. Nice small bubbles throughout. Great hop aroma, with a touch of honey. Strong biting hop flavor, bitter. Great mouthfeel, chews on the tongue ever so slightly. The bitterness and hop harshness is maybe just a little too strong to make this a super drinkable beer. Great overall though.","AChamberlain","Sep 20, 2008"

Mild citrus notes are present. Taste is creamy and most pleasant. The hops are of course notable plus somewhat restrained, and not in a bad way. Strawberry perhaps? Some lemon zest for good measure and a touch of mint. The finish has a nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel is of a high quality. The medium and smooth creamlike body grips the palate with a kind of nonchalance. Smooth and easy drinking. All the factors come together beautifully yet it still seems short of magnificient. Lacking in the top-quality of the absolute best ipas (two-hearted, furious and masala mama notably). In the end though a really phenomenal ipa not far off the top.","Duffman","Sep 08, 2008"

Tasted a little dry, slightly bitter, and had that pine taste. It just tasted good. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was good. I would drink these all the time and will buy again.

The hops jump out at you and pull you in for the taste, which is even better. The excessive dry-hopping produces a powerful IPA-worthy bitterness that somehow manages to be completely smoothed out by the mild malt character. Medium to light body with a serene crispness.

Now, the beer is great, although certainly not quite as stunning. It's got a solid look, just like an IPA should. Fairly weak lacing on a solid head. Flavor and nose are strong on piney hops, with caramel malt and some toffee and citrus in there too to round things out. This is a highly hoppy beer, no question, bitter and drying, but delicious.

First sip catches you off guard as it is not what you would expect, but it is a great unique citrus flavor.

The overall flavor was decent--nice strong hop flavor, bitter orange peel. A very easy drinking IPA--would be easy to have 2 or 3 even. Nice carbonation, soft mouth feel and generally a clean finish.

The hops dominate the tastebuds while only being slightly spicy and mildly bready, and this beer actually has a smooth finish. Don't know why exactly, thought I tasted caramel and/or butterscotch and the hops gave off some fruitiness (like apples), but a great finish to a great beer.

Pours a light straw color with decent clarity and a good 1/4 inch head that settles to a fine ring that leaves little lacing down the glass. Smells of big time grapefruit with a touch of floral hops. The nose becomes maltier as it warms up. Tingles the tongue with those grapefruits right away. Some lemon and grassy notes also discernable. A pleasant dose of sweet malts all around. Well structured. Smooth oily mouthfeel. The maltiness also becomes more noticable as it warms. A great IPA that is layered nicely.","timbro81","Mar 27, 2008"

The balance is amazing, I freaking love this beer. The only problem is it's a little pricey on the east coast. Check out the Arrogant Bastard Strong Ale as well. This is a close 2nd in my favorite IPA (first is smuttynose). SO freaking drinkable, I could drink this all night, which might be a little dangerous.","rgb2807","Mar 26, 2008"

The taste is dominated by the bitter citrusy hops that are quite puckering and last well into the finish. There is a mild malt presence in the background, but it is hard to even the slightest attention to the malt before the hops demand your full attention.

Pours that classis IPA orange color. Smells of wonderful hops. The taste is great you have the classic crisp hoppy flavor and its not overwhelmed by the alcohol. I could enjoy this one year round for sure. When i compare it to the ruination IPA from stone i like this one better suprisingly because of the lower alcohol that doesnt take away taste from all the hops. But if your looking for a little extra buzz go with the Ruination. You wont go wrong either way trust me. Oh and this ones a little bit cheaper as far as i know.

Poured with a golden color, and a frothy head that was still a half inch thick a few minutes after pouring. Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip. This evolved into a pleasantly ligering aftertaste that was a good mix of bitterness and hop flavor.

Smell at first is big bold fresh hops, but in a matter of a couple minutes, the hops dissipated dramatically, and turned into a lightly aromatic honey and caramel with the faintest hint of alcohol. I've never noticed the hops aroma fading, or especially that quickly. Taste was actually rather smooth, sweet, and very mildly bittered and flavored from the hops. My girlfriend who can't normally drink IPA's from the bitterness actually liked this one. I was expecting a huge wack in the mouth from hops in this one after reading the bottle's description but it just didn't happen. I happen to like the milder side of IPAs rather than overly extreme, so it was nice, but I'd think some might be dissapointed.

Smell is heavy if not harshly hoppy with pine and grapefruit. Also a myriad of other smells, rasin, raspberry or cassis, apple, a little oak and some honey. extremely refreshing taste. Starts bitter and ends with a sweetish note (for an IPA). Average duration. Palate was light, dry, and a bit metallicy, but only enough to stimulate the senses, still a joy to take down.

4.57,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is one of my current favorites. Stone IPA pours a golden color with a moderate white head about 3/4 inch thickness. A slightly hazy beer that leaves a consistent lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell punches your nose with nice, hoppy notes of pine and citrus. There is also a slight alcohol presence noticeable in the aroma. A sweet malt smell lingers at the beginning of the sniff followed by a lovely fresh hop aroma. The taste has a bite to it from the combo of hops and alcohol. It has a nice sweet, malty taste and a great bitterness on the back of the tongue. The hops are aggressive and the bitterness level is perfect. This medium bodied IPA has carbonation that sits on the tongue momentarily before dissipating. This, combined with the alcohol, creates a spiciness that leave the mouth tingling for several minutes. The drinkability is very high and leaves you wanting more. I, myself, could drink a million.","beeritron","Jan 15, 2008"

Ahh, the smell of hops invades the nose with a bittersweet complexity that makes the mouth water. The smell fades to a honey-like scent after a few sips. The taste is no secret, a bombartment of hops that come at you from all directions, but pleasantly. Strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Biting in the mouth so you remember it sip after wonderful sip.","Neehan","Dec 26, 2007"

Appearance was a nice bronze color with light carbonation visible... aroma was hoppy, tinged by a faint smell of caramel and vanilla... taste strongly complements the aroma, being a solid brew with a strong hop character... slightly bitter finish but definitely full of flavor and really robust... I am eager to try more brews from this company, as I was really impressed with their rendition of an IPA... a good, solid brew... Recommended...","dsa7783","Dec 26, 2007"

This brew poured into a pint glass a very murky copper gold, with a nice one and a half inch thick head. The head was very foamy and creamy, not just bubbly air. The brew itself does not look too appetizing, however, it smells wonderful. Smells of delicious hops, malts, and maybe fruits. The taste is heavenly. Not nearly as bitter and unbearable as other ""strong IPAs."" Great balance of hops and malts, and fruit notes. And the feel, it is wonderfully velvety smooth. Overall, if this were more readily available, I'd be on it all day. Easily one of the best brews I've ever tasted.","zerofear13","Nov 06, 2007"

Color was a beautifully clear amber gold with thick creamy white head that laced the glass very well. Not really much smell as the hops have diminished over time. Taste was good and hoppy, grassy and piney but balanced by the sweetness of the malt. As badass as Stone tries to be, this beer is obviously well crafted and beautifully balanced. Body was medium and carbonation was just right, slid right down the throat.

One of the best IPA's I've had. Hard hitting hops, piney and crisp. Smooth going down and leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste. Also something I really havent noticed in some other IPA's which I guess must be the hop oil. A somewhat ""slick"" feeling present as well.

The hops are there but do not over-power my palate. The brew has the expected floral, grapefruit impact one would expect from an IPA. Do not have the lingering bitter taste and oily mouth-feel that I sometimes experience with other beers of the same type. The alcohol is faintly noticeable but masked well.

To me it tastes the same way it smells, mostly citrus and pine hops with some malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and a bit slick.

4.2,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Awesome! I can't believe a beer of this quality came from less than 30 miles from my house! Pours a perfectly clear (leave the yeast in the bottle - this is LIVE beer) copper color with a beautiful, dense, creamy white head, leaving lacing all over the glass. The hops can be smelled a mile away. The centennial hops dominate the palate, with an exceptionally strong bitterness from Magnum (perfect for blending without a strong taste imparted). Taste is that of citrusy fruits, with a strong hop bitterness that perfectly balances the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel: Light and slick, with a pleasant tingling on the tongue. A sweet/citrusey aftertaste lingers in the background. Overall, one of my favorite beers. Goes great with Bob Sagat live (inside joke).","domtronzero","Aug 26, 2007"

4.2,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Good, simple, ""pure"" IPA from the almighty Stone brewery. This IPA pours a light orange/amber color, like a glass of cold apple juice, into a pint glass, leaving a decent off white head. As I consume the beer, a good lace forms on the walls of the glass. The smell is of citrusy hops and not much else. Pure, clean grapefruit and orange. The taste follows the smell nicely with pure citrus and some alcohol. Quite bitter. The mouthfeel is light and adds to the refreshing quality of this beer. This ale is nicely drinkable once one gets used to the hop attack. Overall, this reminds me of my more familiar midwest favorite, Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Like Two Hearted, this ale has a simple, pure, and delicious character dominated by citrus, particlarly grapefruit, rather than a complex, malty profile.","sacrelicio","Aug 25, 2007"

Malts add a little backbone and make this a near balanced treat. Mouthfeel is thirst quenching. A little bittersweet tingle on the tongue that is great. Drinkability is also up there.

Bit of an alcohol presence unfortunately, which surprises me since Stone Ruination is nearly a percent higher, and I just finished one of those and tasted no alcohol.

The head is attractive, but otherwise looks tame. Grapefruit and orange hit the nostrils first with a bit of toasty, cracker-like malt peeking through. Again, nothing earth-shattering. Oh, but that first sip certainly suggests something out of the ordinary. The grapefruit hinted at in the nose is there in full force in a bitter, piney onslaught. The middle is a lovely, cracker flavored joy. For a brewery that prides itself on monster hops, I am surprised to see the amount of delicious malt that is present. Its a beautiful counterbalance. Ah, the appearance gets better as it goes along. this is some of the stickiest, prettiest head I've seen, with waves of lace latching onto the side of the glass. Lovely... The aftertaste is dry and sweet and fairly long-lasting. I've had Ruination, which is a hop-bomb to say the least. But this is remarkably balanced for a west-coast IPA.

Lightly sweet, warm bitter aftertaste that is average to long-lived. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture, lively carbonation, and light to moderately acidic.

Aroma was largely a bouquet of sweet smells of citrus, dew, and even a hint of white vanilla cake. Although not as dominant, there was also a bit of grassy earth notes in the aroma as well. Taste was filled with citrus hops and grassy undertones. The balance on this beer is insane...hoppy but not overly bitter. Mouthfeel was also surprisingly light considering this brewery.

There is little (but noticeable) malt flavor, but the hop intensity just isn't there. The citrus and bitterness is prevalent, but the bitterness quickly subsides to a mild bite.

4.42,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Found his on-tap at a new restaurant in Columbus called Fabian's. I was impressed to find it there. Pours a clear, golden honey yellow with a thin white head. A tiny bit of retention and lacing on it. Smells and tastes aren't terribly strong (I have to admit that I'm approaching this beer having had Stone's Ruination and 10th Anniversary IPAs), but they're nice and balanced. Good blend of grapefruity hops, with a touch of honey, malty sweetness. Medium mouthfeel, a little carbonation - seems appropriate for the style. If you're looking for crazy hops, this is not the beer, but it's still a superior example of an IPA - well balanced, wonderful to drink. Highly recommended.","ndekke39","May 06, 2007"

4.35,3.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Now this is an IPA. Where other beer try to lean too much on hops, Stone gets the balance just right. There is a plenty big hop character here, comprising much of the flavor. Citrus (a nice lemon zest, if I do say so myself), pine, earthiness, are all on the palate. However, this is offset by a wonderful maltiness that compliments these bitter flavors. Mouthfeel is also very clean, and there's a dry finish. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, I had no idea it was close to 7%. Overall this is the best standard IPA I've had.","BBM","May 05, 2007"

The smell is aromatic, sweet, a bit citrusy, not too much hoppy smell. The taste is clearly imbalanced towards the hops. When the beer warms a bit, you can taste some malt, citrus, less hoppiness, some grassiness. When its colder, the hops are just too pronounced for my tastes. The mouth feel is a bit creamy, and you can feel the hop bite in the middle, end, and aftertaste. The aftertaste is not overwhelmingly bitter but you will know that the brewers didn't spare the hops. If you love hoppy IPA's you're going to like this beer. I'm becoming less interested in them, but it's just a matter of preference for me. L'Chaim.","albern","Apr 27, 2007"
4.1,-2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer's appearance is a clear, orange colour with tiny bubbles consistently rising from the bottom and a good amount of head at the top. The beer's smell is rooted in citrus aroma. You could barely tell of any hops in the aroma. As for the taste, the aroma translates very well. A sweet, citrus taste with a light bounce on the palate. The mouth feel reveals little carbonation. I found this surprising since halfway down the glass, tiny bubbles still rose to the top. Given that mouth feel is light, I could drink this every night in the warm Spring weather. Maybe that is why I enjoyed this brew when I used to live in SoCal. This IPA is highly recommended.","tommy78","Apr 21, 2007"
4.75,12.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a just-shy-of-clear bright amber color, with golden highlights and a big, dense head of white foam that leaves tons of lace. Huge aroma of American hops -- citrus and pine sap and metals. There's a nice, sweet blood orange note in there. Only the slimmest hint of amber malts makes it through. On the palate, the mouthfeel is extremely smooth considering all the hops in this thing. Carbonation is biting but fine-bubbled. The taste is extraordinary, and precisely what you would want in an American IPA. It's almost harshly bitter, but the malt payload is enough to keep things smooth, albeit still massively imbalanced. In the midst of all those citrus and metallic notes is a notable lack of acrid fusel oils or any other detracting byproducts of massive hop bitterness. Overall, this is an incredible IPA. It's big and brash, but not out of whack in its flavors and aromas... huge, imbalanced, but still drinkable, which is a pretty remarkable achievement.","geexploitation","Apr 17, 2007"

Smell was excellent, I absolutely can't stop taking whiff after whiff of this brew. Such a clean and crisp scent of grapefruit with a hint of evergreen pine. I would definitely burn a candle with this smell! Taste wasn't what I expected from the smell, but it was still good. Hops are there, but not overpowering. Grassy spice with a piney zest. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth for an IPA, very subtle bitter bite. The yeasty finish balances this beer out almost perfectly. Such a good job designing this brew. Great IPA, I wish I tried it earlier but I was too distracted by Arrogant Bastard and Ruination. Stone ""wow's"" again.","BeerTruth","Apr 04, 2007"

Really nice IPA.","awall422","Apr 02, 2007"

Smells fantastic -- citrus (pineapple/grapefruit) and pine -- the hops aren't overwhelming like some other IPAs because of the sweet sweet malt. Tastes nearly as good -- this is a real cornacopia of hop tastes -- spice, citrus, bitters, and more citrus (in that order), which somehow drops off, leaving you with a sweet piney, slightly bitter finish. A remarkable beer. Fine carbonation and a creamy body make it very drinkable. Three cheers for Stone!","jbsteiny","Mar 31, 2007"
4.25,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a light yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. The smell is dominated by a floral aromas of hops. This one is dry hopped to give the added aroma to the beer. The taste is not as hoppy as the smell but still very large. The taste starts sweet and hoppy and is followed by the bitter taste, which isn't very strong considering the amount of hops in the smell and taste. A decent amount of carbonation and a great balance make this beer an easy drinker for any hop head. A great brew from a great brewery, check this one out! Enjoy!","wingman14","Mar 30, 2007"

3.99,-5.5,3,4,4,4.5,4,"When poured into a simple mug, the beer was a hazy metallic honey orange with a thin layer of white bubbly foam that was supposed to act as the head of foam. It fizzled away into a small trace of white bubbly rings and lace around the mug. When I first popped the cap, It smelled like I twisted the cap off a bottle of Pine Sol. I didn't know if I was suppose to drink it or clean the floors with it. When it settled in the mug, the strong aroma of Pine Sol was still there, as well as some citrus hops and a hint of citrus fruits in the background. It tasted like somebody started growing grapefruits on pine trees and you took one of those trees and shoved one into your mouth. It was that piney and citrusy! Behind the grapefruit pine tree was a few other citrus fruits, citrus hops, and just the slightest hint of toasted malt at the end. The mouthfeel was very crisp with a strong aftertaste of sharp pine needles and citrus hops. It also completely masks it alcohol content. Pine and citrus hops conquers all! Overall a very good citrusy and piney IPA. I don't think I've had an IPA that was so strong in pine and citrus. I think I should have bought their 22 oz. bomber bottle because this little 12 oz. bottle doesn't go very far. If you like eating pine trees, then give IPA a try.","AltBock","Mar 29, 2007"

Maltiness is also mild and pleasing. The yeast gives a clean profile, no real fruitiness or spiciness. Carbonation is a little too much, rolling the beer in my mouth, a lot of gas comes out.

A subtle malt undertone creates a complex balance between the two that gives the beer a great drinkability. Carbonation is lower than most IPAs.

Once poured, the beer had a slight floral hop scent, with a strong undercurrent of citrus, specifically something reminiscent of grapefruit. The taste was true to the description on the bottle, very bitter hops, with the grapefruit coming through as well. The mouthfeel was slightly crisp, with a good deal of carbonation. Considering the strong hop flavor, one would expect the beer to taste somewhat crisper, but it almost seemed dulled somehow. The drinkability is surprisingly good. I'm personally not a fan of the deep bitter flavor in this one, but I'm sure fans of the style would LOVE this beer.

The smell was light floral hops with a little malt. The taste was malty and a touch sweet with moderate hoppiness. Alcohol was tasted, and there was a light hint of oxidation.

It doesn't last long (though it doesn't dissipate immediately either), but leaves light lacing all the way down. The aroma is really great. The hops are very nice. The mouthfeel is full, almost creamy even, not watery at all. The carbonation is moderate with just the right amount of bite.

Pungent floral and citrus hops explode out of the pint glass. The taste is pure hops as well. It seems almost misleadingly subtle at first sip, until I swallow the large gulp and find a ferocious blast of hops! Not sure I've had a more powerful hoppy beer ever. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, but the thickness creates an almost slimey effect, not a bad thing, just unique.

This beer has a stronger bite then the Ruination IPA that Stone brews. It has a nice hops spice and a good blend of flavors but it doesnt have the same IPA qualities as its sister beer. Where that beer seemed strong and sweet this one is more crisp and biting. It is less forgiving to someone that doesnt know the power of an IPA. Its feel is hard and sharp. It cuts through your mouth with flavor and hits you with the IPA tingle. It finishes crisp and refreshing. In all this is a high quality IPA. It is not a masterpiece but well worth drinking if you like hops.","eballard","Oct 01, 2006"

Grapefuit hop flavor dominates over hints of orange rind and light toasted malt. This is far and away my favorite American IPA out there, just finally getting around to reviewing it. It does a great job of satisfying my craving for hops while being incredibly drinkable.

Starts off watery and bittersweet and ends w/ a long lasting dry bitter taste. Love the tartness it leave on my lips. The aroma is also great.

Reasonable lacing left on the glass. The smell is very citrusy and floral hop aromas. One of the best smelling IPAs I have had to be honest, as the hop aroma was very evident, but not in the burn your nose hair kind of way. I found the beer to be very malty, semi-sweet, and with a solid hoppy punch on the back end. I though the hop profile was pretty much perfect as it had a great deal of flavor, but wasn't so bitter you were puckering up as you drank it. Has a very velvety smooth mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable beer, and one I just found is available neer me. Unfortunately with a $10.50/six pack price tag, it will be a rare treat.

The initial taste is also of aggressive hops (in that ""west coast"" sort of style). The hops are balanced with a good amount of sweet malt character. Very nicely done, big & bold but smooth. The beer suffers a little on drinkability because it seems to be too much (too hoppy, too malty) & too strong (perhaps a % pt. too high) to make a good session beer if that's what you're looking for. Still, a very enjoyable pint (or two, they're small) to have during an evening out.","jsbrendle","Sep 06, 2006"

4.5,6.6,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Pours a peach-orange-nectarine with a kind of thin white and frothy head that leaves patchy ""lace"" spots on the glass. I don't get a lot of malty aromas in this, but that's ok. The hops are good enough for me. Big citrus notes with some grass and a little aspirin. Alcohol is apparent, but doesn't beat you over the head. Taste is of slightly toasty malt with gummi worms and fruit loops from the citric hops. The only way I can describe it. Hops bitterness lays way on the back of the tongue like you swallowed a crushed up pill. That last aspirin bit makes me knock off a little from the score, but aside from that, this is delicious. mouthfeel is of moderate body with soft carbonation and it lingers just long enough on your tongue. Not cloying, but it doesn't wash away too soon. If it didn't cost $4 a bomber, I would keep this in the fridge pretty often.","goochpunch","Aug 29, 2006"

The taste is very similar to my favorite IPA, Bell's Two Hearted Ale (regionally biased opinion of course.) Just enough pale sweet malty backbone to balance out the outrageously awesome hops. They are mostly floral and perfume-y up front, but with a lot of citrus, orange and grapefruit, as well as some apricot. A few pine-y notes come as the beer goes down. Great silky smooth mouthfeel.

Teh aroma reminds me of 60 minute a bit, sweet, with floral and piney hops...smells complex, which for hops is a good thing. Taste is grapefruity bit penetratingly bitter. Not killer in it's bite, but the bitterness does linger. It's in amount of bitterness here not type, thing more like a lot of lower alpha bitterness rather than less high alpha bitterness...and its, again, complex with multiple kinds of hops I'd guess. Similar in style to 60 minute bit more straight bitterness and less in aroma. Leaves a tang on the tounge but it's not so cascade-like where it might linger infinitely past the point of enjoyment. Mouthfeel is not overwhelming but a bit high on carbonation, good for most. When I let this one stick around and decarbonate thought, I realizzed that it tasted mostly like hop water. the malt here is not that present. The complexity of the hop profile is what shines, and the alcohol is well hidden. This has good drinkability for an IPA, but one is plenty for me.

Poured from a 22 oz. bomber with Stone's trademark ripping on the BMC idiots into a hefe glass and was pure orange with a nice head. In fact, the top half was all cream. Upon first whiff, it is all hops, wondering if you can finish the bottle! But you do because of the citrus and hop character found in about no other beer. The taste is amazing. The hoppiness lingers a good 30 minutes after you drink it (the buzz is another thing!). I was amazed at how well the head held throughout a whole 22 oz. bottle. It never dissipated to a ring, but left a good 2 cm of off white on top at all times, and I was very impressed by that. The mouthfeel is great and bitter, a definite sipper over time. Thats where the drinkability takes a whack, but the taste is by far the highlight of the beer! I am fast becoming a Stone fanatic, and living in San Diego is living the dream!

I've never had an IPA before but knew it to be very well hopped. This was no exception to the style and was a very good beer by my standards. It poured a nice goldish orange color and I was immediately taken in by the nice smell of citrus and hops. The taste was awesome. It had a very crisp feel to it and the hops definitely came through.

This taste keeps growing and changing as you drink. Mouthfeel = smooth and wonderful. Just a note: this is not necessarily a quick drinking beer and due to its intense bitter flavor some timing is necessary in regards to accompanying food and the beers to come. Im certainly contemplating breaking out a bit of cheese.","BabaJohn","Jul 17, 2006"

The taste was AMAZINGLY delicious. The hops attacks, smooths, cools, chills, whatever. I loved it. it was so deep, citrusy, grassy, and all of the above. SO MUCH HOPS. The mouth feel was heavy, and dark. I loved it. The drinkability is way too high for something this hoppy.

The aftertaste is clean with a nice hop bitterness, but not too bitter to be a bother. The mouthfeel is smooth with med carbonation.

Mouthfeel is suitably creamy and drinkablility is near perfect. A rugged yet sessionable beer that everyone with any sense will respect. Thank you Stone!","TheBungyo","Apr 28, 2006"

I also drank about half a dozen 22 oz. bottles of Stone IPA in the intervening time. I now realize that the pure piney hop flavor of Stone IPA is superior to these attempts to enhance the complexity. I'm still keeping an open mind, but Stone continues to be the reigning champion of IPAs for me, and is probably the most drinkable beer for its strength of any that I've tried.","instrumentality","Apr 28, 2006"

Big american hop aroma of chinook and cascade like grapefruit/citrus with a mild grassy tone; background toasted pale malt. First sip is sweet toasted pale malt, followed by a rush of herbal hop bitterness. Slightly fruity, but not estery at all which I like. The aftertaste is dry and bitter with a fresh cut whole hop flavor. The pale malt is simple but strong enough for a great balance against the complex hop character. The flavor is dry, bitter, sweet and fruity all at once. Mild carbonation and medium bodied for a smooth mouthfeel that breaks up the bitterness without being overly carbonated. The finish is dry with a hop resin taste and alpha acid bite, but it fades quick enough and retains a high drinkability. A wonderfully satisfying American IPA.","PBRstreetgang","Apr 17, 2006"

Taste starts out with a rather sweet malt and then hits you with loads of flowery hops giving way to a gently bitter finish. Very nice delicate hops meld well with the strong pale malt for a very drinkable balanced IPA. Hop bitterness seems a little too subdued at first, but builds as you make your way through the glass. Medium bodied, medium/low carbonation, and an absolutely silky smooth feel.

The nose opens with a slightly vinous pinch that immediately deepens into fully blown hops (straight-up grapefruit rinds and cut grass) held down by a thin but sturdy ballast of cracker-like yeasts and caramel-dense malts. Taste: Razor sharp zip of hop bitterness -- as if anything less was expected -- blasts off from the tip of my palate and arches back, with finesse, all the way to my molars. The middle reveals more complexity as the malts nudge through, caramel in character, same as in the nose. Thins out for the finish, leaving only a high-pitched echo of hops spinning around the center of the roof of my mouth like one of those obnoxious rotating fire-crackers that throws sparks everywhere and terrifies the elderly relaxed and immobile in lawn chairs on the fourth of July.

Until a friend got me trying some REAL beers and turned me onto Stone Brew. I've had their AB which is a treat, but recently decided to put Stone IPA on tap at my house because it's drinkability is better. This is a truely great beer. My most favorite part is the smell. After my first few glasses I can anticipate sniffing the hops and then getting a good taste of them afterward. If you want (with a tap anyway) you can make a nice head on the beer making quite attractive with a rich yellow/orange color. Has a nice smooth mouth feel as it slides down with a delicious hoppy flavor. Malt and alcohol are present but the hops mutes them. Definately has a bitter ending, which I've grown to like. It fades after half a glass, but can be quite aweful if you had anything sweet as it has a hint of grapefruit at the end. This is probably one of the first beers I take nice long draws from because it actually is that enjoyable. As a word of advice, I see this beer being hated by the average macrobrew beer drinker.","mwc115","Mar 28, 2006"

Lacing is very pronounced, like a ladder pattern on the glass. The smell was strong, some hops, but also the type of fruity smell that I usually associate with hefe weizens. No hefe weizen/astringent taste though. Definitely a hops leaning taste, but not an ""in your face"" hops flavor like Hop Hog or Big Foot. The predominant tastes were hops and citrus, not much of the SNPA type pine aroma/taste. Mouthfeel is what I would expect in an IPA. Drinkability is high!! No hint of the ABF, a nice balanced (I call ""leaning towards hops"" balanced!) taste. This is something you could cheerfully swill until it catches up with you.","JayQue","Jan 15, 2006"

The taste was not as sweet as I expected though, the flavor is mostly domintated by the hoppiness, leaving behind a strong bitterness. The alcohol is readily detectible at times also Mouthfeels is OK, somewhat thin and with decent carbonation.

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"My local bar rotated Stone IPA into their taps, so I've been happily drinking this in place of Racer Five for a few months. The bottled version lacks some of the initial bitterness of the draft version, possibly due to the freshness of this sample.

A strong offering worthy of the gargoyle.","jed","Jan 02, 2006"

There is a honeyed maltiness and the taste of peaches and flowery esters. The mouthfeel is full and juicy, very satisfying. Great drinkability...too bad this stuff is so expensive as a sixer.

Stone IPA settles medium-bodied and from there the bottle basically says it all. Flavors are (or could nearly be) taffey, white grape, wheat, and perhaps more subtle others. In two words this beer is all about ""hop bitters"" just like any quality IPA should be. Finish is melty smooth and clean with an oily and sour aftertaste.","theozag","Oct 19, 2005"
4.57,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer had a clear gold color with an orange tint and a creamy white head. I loved this smell, piney and floral, a bit of fruit. The first sip gives a hint of malt then a slow build with the hops, citrus then bitter with clean finish. Not too bitter just right. Medium body with lots of carbonation contributes to the clean finish. This beer is easily in my top ten.","orsulacp","Oct 16, 2005"
2.98,-29.4,4,3.5,3,3,2,"Just to be fair, I love, love, love Arrogant Bastard, find it to be one of the finest substances ever to touch my lips. That beer's just about as hoppy as this one, but it has such an invigorating mouthfeel and up-front splash of fruit that the hops seem balanced in comparison -- the extremes on both end mesh perfectly and create a brew that actually seems to strive to push the boundaries of what a perfectly-crafted beer can be. I'm not a hophead, so their IPA just seems to be, as another review put it, ""liquid hop juice"". Lovers of hop-bombs will love this one; I just happen to not be one of them.","danielharper","Oct 16, 2005"

Stone comes as close as possible to the edge of being too hoppy without crossing that line. If a good IPA should be considered ""balanced", then this is perfection. From the floral aroma to the citrusy hop bite and bitter finish, this is the best IPA, and the freshest I might add, I've experienced. Fantastic.","Gruntlumber","Sep 14, 2005"

Just hoppy enough to give it some bite, balanced by sufficient malt to give it the sweetness it needs to balance the bitterness of the hops. Smooth, creamy, hoppy, piney, citrusy, resinous, all perfectly balanced. Stone doesn't seem to make a bad beer. Not the overwhelming hops of Ruination, not too much malt to make it too sweet. Simply perfect. If you have any friends who insist Bud Light is good beer, given them a glass of this and watch the reaction.","kirok1999","Sep 02, 2005"
3.83,-9.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a hoppy IPA without a substantial amount of malt body. The taste is dominated by a medicinal citrus injection. For the hop-fanatic in me this is a wonderland of bubbly bitterness that tickles the tastebuds long after I take a sip. For the IPA-lover in me it is too linear, and its focus on over-the-top hops denies the complexity of a malty base. Definately worth picking up again.","Hop2it","Aug 31, 2005"

It was a little late at night when I got home from work, went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle-opened it and took a swig. I suddenly thought to myself ""what am I doing?"" I grabbed a pint glass and slowly poured this delicate libation in. I brought the glass to my nose and took in the aromas. ""This must be what Bavaria smells like", I thought aloud. This beer has a golden hue and a nose of FRESH hops to it. I was once again, amazed by Stone, it smelled so fresh! The mouthfeel is heavy and the taste is quite strong, starting off hoppy and light like most IPA's but finishing with a little bit more bitterness than I was expecting. Which was a good thing.

4.33,2.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Nicely hopped, just as you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. The hops have a kick and are perfectly chosen, tasting good from the first sip through the end of the great aftertaste. I didn't experience any hops fatigue, which sometimes happens as a hoppy character comes to overwhelm other flavors in the beer as you drink it more and more.

The flavor is the same but has an overpowering wet paper character that lets you know it is past its prime. It has a medium body and nice carbonation considering.

Taste is eqaully impressive. Definite strong hop presence that last throughout, BUT has an underlying smoothness that makes the experience very enjoyable.

The prerequisite hops are present to a large degree - citrous and pine notes are tantalizing, dancing with an herbal quality. What sets this aroma apart is a sweet, estery, floral aroma - quite wonderful really. There is also some caramel and pale malt smell present. Do they sell air fresheners like this?? The taste does not disappoint that which the smell put forth. The lovely product of dry hopping is immediately evident. Lots of clean citrous, grapefruit, and some pine nip at the tongue. Assertive hops? Yes sir. However there is a wonderful balance by smooth malt and sweet caramel. True to the IPA style, the malt holds back and allows the beautiful hop character to shine. A little spice and herbal notes dance around as well. Although the malts take the back seat, they never leave entirely. The flavor is exceptional in the fact that it is all about the overall flavor - not just a kick-in-the-nuts blast of hops. The hops are diverse, and the malt character is expertly contrived. Finish is a great blend of dryly bitter hop oils and the faintest of sweet malt. A little alcohol warmth in the finish drives this brew home. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little thin. Overall, this IPA is so good, its probably sinful. Who cares - not me. I'll have another (and another).","BeerFink","Apr 10, 2005"

Copper color with auburn in the middle and an almost golden color around the sides. Huge fluffy white head. Tons of lacing. I love it! Aroma hits me upon opening the cap. Lots of floral hops, almost like walking through a garden. I get a slight pine sensation in the aroma as well. The body in this beer is rather thick for an IPA and holds the flavors of the hops very well. The hop flavor is very floral and that is the showcase here but a nice little hop bitterness comes through in a citric way. Juicy orange and grapefruit bitterness provide an excellent compliment to the floral flavors. Malt also is detectable. It seems rather bready, almost biscuity, with a honeyish sweet compliment. Finish is medium and lingers with a pure hop flavor but is not really too intense. Very drinkable beer here and it seems like there is no way this beer is 6.9% abv. Another excellent Stone offering.","granger10","Apr 05, 2005"

4.6,9,4,4,5,4,5,"Translucent strawberry blonde, with a white cloud of of head that quickly gave way to clingly ring of lace, but with only a swirl the head came right back to life, giving away that incredible hoppy aroma. Pine trees, citrus, grassy, this thing has the whole nine yards. The first sip goes down dry and lip-smackingly bitter, but somehow the malt fights it's way through and holds on to the back of your palate after the first coat of hops saturates your tastebuds into submission. Maybe my sample was getting a little old (6-8 months I'd say), but I kinda tasted a little vanilla in the aftertaste, something I didn't notice when I had the first 2-3 from my 6 pack. Alcohol also makes it's presence known after about the half pint mark. For some people balance in a Beer is important, and I sort of fall into that catergory, but sometimes in life you find balance in inequality, order in chaos, yada-yada-yada. This Beer is the gold standard of American IPAs, and my personal favorite from Stone, regardless of the Bastards and the Ruinations and whatever. This one I could drink every day, I've enjoyed it this summer in the balmy heat of Florida and last night in the great Canadian winter. I'm a very seasonal drinker and rare are the brews that I crave year-round, but this one is on the list.","Goldorak","Jan 23, 2005"

When you want a smooth, well-balanced beer, it would be in your best intrest to keep the hell away from this one. If you are looking for an over the top aggressive hop monster, you've looked in the right place. I love it. Pours a hazy orange colour with a thick white head. The aroma is grassy and very strong.

The taste of this beer matches the aroma with overwhelming citrusy, piney hop flavors. Stone must have thrown an absurd amount of northwest hops in this brew. There's an unusual amount of sweetness, but for an IPA, that's still not much sweetness. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 in taste is the bitterness.

Pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is mostly hoppy, and after struggling a little I could smell some citrus as well. Medium-bodied and very smooth-drinking, with hops and spice at the forefront. Malt and a bit of citrus are in there as well.

The aroma is strong with both pine and grapefruit. Hops and malt take a backseat, but are still present underneath. The taste is as big as the bottle and Stone Brewery's reputation. The hops hit with a huge bang right from the first sip. Some faint hop sweetness works into the fold in the middle, then disappears as the lingering hops slam your senses to a bitter / sour finish that is quite dry. Mouthfeel is just about right: full bodied but carbonated just enough to dampen the blow of the hops. One area this offering scores just a little lower is the drinkability. It's just a bit too sour to drink much. One bottle is probably about all I could handle at any given time.

Although, there seems to be a slight citrus note in the nose as well. The taste again hits you with hops that are spicy and grassy. There is a good amount of malt that keeps this beer from being too out of control. Medium body, carbonation is moderate.

Citric bitterness hit the tongue first with a slightly sweet malt coming though shortly after. The after taste was mildly bitter with an earthy hop bite. A fairly balanced flavor that keep the emphasis on the hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with about a medium body. I could drink this stuff all day, one of my favorite IPAs.","meathookjones","Sep 16, 2004"

I am not a hop head but this is loaded with hop flavor and bitterness and I enjoyed it. Wow ! Holy hops ! The mouthfeel is good. Much thicker than I expected. It really coats the tongue and mouth letting the flavorful beer be enjoyed. There is a long lasting aftertaste of well...hops. This is a good IPA.

As expected of Stone, all tastes were huge as well... really spicy up front, honey-cereal sweet and citrus tangy in the middle and then a solid, dry bitterness that coated my tongue and lasted.

Smell consisted of lots of hops. I noticed on the back that it's dry hopped as well. Some background malts can be detected as well along with some citrus notes. Taste was quite nice. Big hops come across first along with some piney notes, but once you think the hops are going to have a huge bite, some nice malts hide the hops along with some citrus notes. Almost juicy-like in taste. Medium body with the right amount of carbonation blending in. Overall a nice well rounded IPA. First Stone I've had and look forward to many more.","necoadam","Sep 03, 2004"

Floral hops, with a bit of that ""good marijuana"" smell, for lack of a better way to describe it. Like dark hydro. The taste is great. One of the better IPAs I've tasted. Very hoppy - a good balance of hops. A little floral. Just the right amout of bitterness. This is how an IPA should taste, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is good, but a bit weak in the carbonation department, in my opinion. A wee bit acidic, also, but that is to be expected in an IPA. Very drinkable.

Pours out a cloudy marmalade colour, thickish foamy head which recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing. Hops are initially present on the nose, but seem to be biding their time, like a leviathan preparing to surface, grapefruit, pine and some spice, but enough malt in it's wake to not make it one-dimensionally overwhelming. Flavour is not as intense as I anticipated, some sweet malt at first triggers the explosion of hops that build and build and build towards and throughout the finish. Earthy and piney at first, then turning citrus, and the grapefruit rind on the finish. A well-contained IPA, the hops are not allowed to completely run wild and get out of control, there is method behind the madness, some direction. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. I think perhaps this would garner a higher rating if I had a fresher sample, but I'm enjoying this nonetheless, it holds up. Definitely worth further sessions.","IronDjinn","Aug 11, 2004"

4.29,1.7,4,5,4,4.5,4,"A great beer that was more balanced at times than others. Some mouthfulls seemed to be all hops, and others seemed to balance out perfectly. Those that fell into the latter catagory were absolutely wonderful. I just wish that the citrus characteristics of the hops that came through in the aroma would have made it into the flavor. The flavor was all herbal.","Quaffer","Mar 19, 2004"
4.45,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Absolutely, the hops are where it's at. The malt provides a notably subtle sub-layer, but it's there only to keep the hops from sucking the skin from the inside of your mouth. Still, for all the hop oils present, the bitterness is deliciously manageable. No person who craves hops could stop at one of thse, and in fact, I'm not stopping and refuse to count how many I've had. How many just doesn't matter, because satisfying a hops addiction is a timeless, unquantifiable joy when this nectar is around to do it.","Foxman","Mar 15, 2004"

The hop flavor of this beer is tremendous, and should be a decent intro to hops seeing as the flavors are at the forefront, not the bitterness.Nice citrous hop blast with a mildly bitter aftertaste. There is some maltiness in there, but it provides a good base, not flavor. The Hops take over in this department. This is probably the best straight up IPA on the market for any hophead.

Half inch head, whitish yellow in color, leaves a smattering of broken lace above the clear, deep golden colored beer. The flavor is pretty intense, and actually increases after its swallowed. Light to moderate body with a pretty clean taste, the beer stops just short of being really bitter. Piney, citrus hop flavor up front , finishes like a bitter sugary grapefruit. At 6.9% abv it does a pretty good job of warming up my stomach. Theres a lot of flavor and aroma packed into this smooth drinkable beer, a really good (American) IPA.

The aroma is grassy, herbal, citrusy, & it has a sweet hop nectar character. Quite simply, as I take my first sip, I know this is a hoppy bitter brew. The hops explode on your tongue. There is a balancing malt sweetness here that is required to carry this hop bomb. The hop character has strong notes of bergemot as well as some resiny overtones; this is just pure hop nectar. A very fruity beer, made more so by the citrusy hop character. Quite over the top in it's hoppiness.

A surprisingly well-balanced nose for an IPA (though after drinking an Arrogant Bastard Ale beforehand, everything is relative). Floral hops are offset by plainly detectable light malts. This balance carries over to the taste, where the hops and malts play well together. Crisp, clean and very drinkable, this is a really nice IPA all around.","BitteBier","Feb 14, 2004"
3.92,-7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This golden beer almost looks a bit too light under a modest white head. It offers a very hoppy aroma, which hints at the initial tastes - a symphony of well-blended hops.

Aroma is hop essence literally.. with a hint of fuel and quite salty as well together with the more traditional citrus, lemon and grapefruity profiles. A good sniffing which appeals me by its originality. Taste surprises right away being very citric. I simply don't understand how so many people can love it that much since it's so distracting? Neverthless, there's a touch of honey malt and it's very clean. Talking about balance is totally out of place though and it didn't seem particularly pleasant. The body is honest, a solid medium body, but not as mouth-filling as other Stones I've had. Basically, this was totally blown away by the Lost Coast Indica we've had just before. Just altogether way too citric sour for my liking, possibly the tartest IPA I've had to date and while it's a characteristic I truly love in many belgians, it didn't seem to fit here.

Sure, there is some breadiness, very light caramel flavor, and a certain sugariness, but the hops are clearly the focus. Very fruity in a citrusy way. The bitterness is surprisingly not harsh in any way, rather well balanced. Feel is extremely smooth, a bit creamy, and a hint of slickness. Alcohol is present mostly in its warming sensation.

Some particles (hops?) can be seen settled on the bottom of the glass. The aroma is citric with considerable juicy grapefruit notes and a subtle backing of malts. Stone IPA is wonderfully smooth from start to finish. The malt backbone is ever-present despite the tendency for this brew to lean towards the direction of the hops.

It took me a while to get past HOPPY, but I started to understand that this beer, with hops, hops, and more hops, wasn’t screwing my face into a, forgive me “bitter beer face”. The balance allows the entire hop flavor to come through, but backs it with enough malt to leave no edge at all. The smooth finish encourages another drink, and another, so drinkability is only slowed by the sizable alcoholic kick that creeps up on you. This is a liquid celebration of the noble hop. If this is what British soldiers got while serving in India, I think I’d sign up. While not for the faint of heart, this is a must-taste for any hop head.","HardTarget","Sep 12, 2003"

It's gotta be the chinooks! The flavor is the same as the aroma - resiny pine. It left a bitter taste on my tongue that reminded me of the old Foghorn Leghorn cartoons where he painted the dogs tongue with green paint.

Reverse cascaded into a hazy golden much like a midsummer sunset with bubbly white head and plenty of tiny bubble lace. The smell was tart and bursting with Chinook hops, honey and a faint toasted malt. But the smell was dominated by hops. The taste was the same. Huge waves of grapefruit hop bitterness rolled on the shores of my mouth leaving my taste buds in utter shock there was very little aftertaste as the nectar flowed dwn my gullet. The mouthfeel was thinly carbonated and syrupy, more to my likeing. This stands as one of the better IPAs I have had, and that is not just because this is Stone, but because it is damn near the definition of a west coast IPA.","GreatPondBrewer","Jul 18, 2003"

The smell is rich floral hops, maybe chinook, with some citrus. The taste is very well balanced, with sweet malt up against fruity hops. The hops are not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, just a little carbonated. The drinkability is extremely good. This must be Ruination's little brother.","SheepNutz","Jul 10, 2003"

I found this to be so well balanced and easy to drink, I beleave I found my new home stocker of this style. It pours a cloudy orange amber with a one & half inch white head. Lace is very good and sticks all glass long. The taste is hoppy yes, but not over bitter, but rather smooth. Stone takes thier time in the brewing process, and it shows. From the first aroma of floral citrus hop to the mouth that is left alittle tart, but not dry. Wow, a very drinkable IPA to be had.","chilidog","Jul 05, 2003"

A nice strong bitter punch hits you as first, just to let you know there is an abundance of hops here. Citrus like flavors are balanced well with a slightly sweet malt and candy like flavors- but only for a moment. This beer is all about hops, but it backs off just enough to make this a great beer to drink anytime. Goes extremely well with spicey foods.","AaronRed","Jul 03, 2003"
4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Stone IPA pours with a vibrant orange color, which is slightly clouded in appearance. the thick foamy white head leaves a thick, clinging lace around the glass. The first smell immediately presents a sharp hoppy scent surrounded by soy and citrus rind, with an underpinning of apples, pine and malt. The mouthfeel is smooth, although contrasted by the play of carbonation on the middle of the tongue. The taste is subtle, while not at all lacking. Starting with a fruity maltness, it builds to a hoppy bitter within about 5 seconds, with some citrus hints lingering. It blends to a bitter hoppy aftertaste which makes one want to eat something salty, which of course makes you want to drink more. This, of course, is always good. I put this ale high on my list.","FranklinPCombs","Jun 30, 2003"

I had been waiting for a while for more Stone brews to come to Texas, and got very excited when I saw the IPA at the store, sadly there was only one bottle left. The beer pours a nice golden color with a white foamy head. The beer is very bubbly and makes it quite nice to look at after it is poured. The smell of the beer is great, very very hoppy, with a fruit smell, possibly grapefruit. With the first taste the hops hit you like a hammer, then the fruit kicks in, all of the flavors meld terrific.The beer is dry yet wet at the same time, making this one great beer for hot weather.

4.53,7.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"MmmStone IPA This was the first non-Arrogant Bastard Stone beer I tried. I bought a boat load of Stone on a trip to Arizona, and drank the IPA first for two reasonsI expected it to pale in comparison with the likes of Old Gaurdian and Ruination and because at the time (March 2003) it was due to be available in Texas within days. Well, its mid-June and IPA is finally here! Anyway, Im sorry I so under-estimated this beer, because it might just be my favorite Stone. The brilliant, clear gold body sports a stylishly-contrasted white, creamy head and a massive aroma of fruity PacNW hops OTHER than Cascades. The nose isnt one-dimensional either, just like the beer itself. Under the fresh, floral, green hoppiness is a touch of earthy maltiness and a soft, fruity sweetness. The flavor is identical, with the bitterness being far from assertive, allowing the hops to be flavorful, not astringent. The pale maltiness shows even more of the fruitiness in the flavor than it did in the nose. The velvety smooth fruitiness glides effortlessly past the initial hop smack and doesnt end until a touch of alcoholic warmth reminds me that this is almost 7% ABV. How a beer thats this hoppy can maintain this kind of balance and still be as quintessential an example of an American IPA as Ive tried, I honestly dont know. Masterful brewing, simply masterful.","TXHops","Jun 22, 2003"

So I get a six-pack and a growler--I mean why not? Right now, I'm reviewing the bottled one, though they're not too different (a better mouthfeel from the tap, I think). Anyway, this pours a medium gold with a noticeable off-white head that left a modest intricate lace. The smell was complex--hops for sure, but balanced by just the slightest citrus and some sweetness, but I could not figure out from what. I was intrigued. The first taste was brash, good and powerful hops, but it mellowed quickly, too quickly even, as the finish I thought was nondescript. Nevertheless this has a pleasant, light mouthfeel (on tap there seemed to be just a bit more body). Very drinkable for an ale with such high alcohol content, so be cautious.","longpondbeerman","Jun 15, 2003"

The bouquet is citrus and flowers, many different kinds, with a good amount of malt in the backround. The flavor follows the nose's lead with a good dose of malt balanced nicely with a floral,citrus hop flavor. A very complex hoppiness about it, the malt could use a bit of complexity, but hey , that's what the Arrogant is about. The texture is nectar-like, which I love but may be thick and chewy for some.

There may have been more complex smells there as well, but I was too happy inhaling the hops aroma to notice. The taste was mostly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt to balance. The taste buds were awakened nicely by the hop bitterness, yet it all finished very smoothly. Overall this is a very good IPA, and if you are a hophead you will love it.

The hops are diffusing through the air coming for me like a trained asassin. Huge hop aroma with earthy tones I love it, some citrus and floral scents also intrigue my senses. First sip I love it, I am going to say right now this is my favorite all around IPA!!!! Yes, it's that good with the hops consuming most of my palate, the malt sweetness comes to save me from making a bitter beer face instantly forming a smile on my face.

4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Stone brews up some of the boldest beers in existance... their IPA is no exception. Pours a crystal clear light copper, with a thin but persistent white head that leaves a fair amount of lace behind. Aroma is all about the hops... pine, citrus, and just a touch of toasted malt. The flavor is bold and balanced... grapefruit and pine hit you over the head, then once you regain your senses, you notice a nice toasted malt profile that lasts for what seems like milliseconds, then you notice the wondefully bitter finish. Not a single flavor is out of proportion. The moutfeel is very smooth and creamy with a medium body. With this beer, I can honestly say I've crossed over... I'm now officially a hop head.","zerk","Jan 30, 2003"
4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I can't wait to try the other Stone beers I recently purchased. With an arrogant bastard, double bastard, and ruination IPA waiting to be consumed, I may be bitter the rest of this year.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jan 24, 2003"

4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"If you've been to D's in Pittsburgh a couple times Im sure you've met Mike, hes a regular there and he recommended this to me early tonight. This IPA gives an exceptionally strong floral fragerance with a hint of citrusy scents. Head is white, fluffy, and disapates rather quickly. Its color is lighter than that of other AIPA's such as HopDevil. Flavor is very hoppy. First sip just smacks your face with the taste of hops and lingers throughout the bottle. Very hoppy beer. Taste is slightly bitter but very pleasant and tasty. A hophead's beer...Im gonna have to try arrogant bastard soon, which was characterized to me as 'similar to this but on steriods'","allboutbierge","Jan 09, 2003"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Fluffy on the palate. Perfect carbonation here. Intense flavors of sheep's milk ricotta, lemon, egg pastries, heavily toasted, and graphite dust...maybe even a little charcoal. Edgy, forward and commanding. Good entertaining beer. True to its genre. Maybe one of the best.","putnam","Jan 08, 2003"

4.13,-2.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Clear orange-amber brew with a few lazy trails of C02. Nice, thick white head. Head fades a bit quickly, but leaves plenty of lace on the glass, and atop the beer. Smell of piny-grapefruity hops is strong. I didn't notice any malt in the aroma. Taste is a wonderful bitter hop bit, citrusy and herbal with a bit of caramel malt to keep it from being 2-Dimensional.","Viking","Dec 02, 2002"
4.28,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"12 oz bottle, light orange -copper color with a white frothy head, nice lacing. Clean citrus-pine aroma, medium body malty with a strong hop profile, nice balance, One hell of an IPA.","maxpower","Nov 27, 2002"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mmm... hops. This IPA pours a golden copper color with excellent clarity and a frothy, off-white head which holds up well. Nose is dominated by citric, floral hops. With 60 IBUs, the taste is big on hops, as well, with some nice malt support. Not overpowering, but rather fairly well balanced with a definite nod to the hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is smooth overall, and is fairly easy to drink for a brew of its ABV. Stone produces an upper-tier American IPA with this one.","Jon","Nov 26, 2002"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a nice golden color with a good head. The first sip signalled what was to come as the taste of hops filled my mouth. Not extremely bitter, but pleasantly biting. The ABV could be felt as I continued to consume. Quite a pleasant IPA, and I will be buying more in the future.","bewareOFpenguin","Nov 19, 2002"
4.43,5,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"This is really a unique IPA. Pours out beautifully with a nice white head and golden yellow body. I expected more hop aroma but it was there along with a buttery malt nose. Light bodied while going down but the aftertaste is buttery with caramel, butterscotch, and vanilla flavors dominating. A cedery hop flavor is there and the bitterness complements the malt very well but does not overwhelm. When this beer warms it takes on belgian ale qualities which I am guessing comes from the type of yeast they use. A very fine IPA.","Longstaff","Nov 18, 2002"
4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a top notch IPA. Aggressively hopped. A wonderful hop aroma abounds. Very good flavor with the hops dominating, yet very drinkable and not too bitter. If you're a hop-head you need to find this one.","PhantomVodoo","Nov 18, 2002"
4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Light copper in color with a smallish white head. Hop aromas of pine and citrus fill the nose. Light carbonation. The hops bite you right away and don't let go, although there is some toasted malt flavor to keep the hops from completely having their way. I haven't tasted many American IPAs that were better than this one.","doerickson","Nov 18, 2002"
4.72,11.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Notes: Simply put ... this is one insane IPA, and not for the weak palate. To compare it to other IPAs would be silly, however I think this sums it up ... Once Stone comes into a new market it's like a challenge to other brewers in the area: ""I know my big beers are bigger and better than yours, but let's see yours anyway. I promise not to laugh."" Oh ... and this is just their standard IPA doing the speaking.","Todd","Oct 27, 2002"
4.82,14.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"The nose says all hops the taste says big, grainy, caramel malt underlying the big time Pacific Northwest hop profile. The hops are so flavorful, bitterness doesn't really come to mind. The citric, piney adjectives don't seem to capture all the different complexities available in this brew. Anyone who loves hops and thinks they've had it all should try this beer.","QXSTER1","Oct 20, 2002"
4.92,16.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I am beginning to have the utmost respect & highest regard for Stone. I have limited experience of US Brewers, but if there are better ones out there I cant wait to try them!","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 14, 2002"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The body is a hazy deep peach in color, topped by a frothy white head that holds well and leaves some excellent ""sticky"" lace. The aroma is of a fruity, sweet (almost sugary) malt, and bold floral & citrus hops (that combine with the sweetness to offer alot of pineapple - but also some lemon). The body is medium/full with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives a light zest on the tongue and then becomes quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor offers a blend of rich, sweet, fruity, and lightly caramel & bready malt, and loads of citrusy, floral, piney & grassy hops backed by a solid bitterness. It finishes with a lingering combination of sweet floral malt flavor and dry bitterness. Although the bitterness is hefty, it's not overwhelming, and the sweet malt remains evident throughout the glass. The alcohol is beautifully cloaked, revealing only a light touch of ""spiciness"" in the flavor. This is a really unique and exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out. Well brewed. Outstanding.","NeroFiddled","Oct 10, 2002"
3.78,-10.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Stone IPA: Not Ruination, but rather Stone’s everyday IPA, bought in a six pack.  Very nice amber color, with a very thick sticky head.  The aroma was hops, the taste was a mildly pleasant hops tingle and the aftertaste was a very nice hops, with a slight residue of hops oils.  Very nice, with a decent alcohol warmth as well.  Very nice example of an IPA.","jackndan","Sep 25, 2002"
4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I guess this is Stone's IPA light when compared to the Ruination IPA, but don't think this is anything light. Stone's IPA also has a strong hop pressence in it's taste. The appearence is a bit cloudy, yet still has that copperish ale look to it. The hop pressence is obvious in the aroma, so don't say you were not warned when you drink it. This is a good beer by Stone, although, I'm a bit confused as to why they would have 2 full-time IPA's on the market...not unless this is the budget version when compared to the Ruination.","sinistersteve","Sep 21, 2002"
4.95,17.3,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a big, impressive froth that almost refuses to settle (which, of course, is a good thing). Leaves nearly enough lace to make it look like it didn't even settle! Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"". And for the seasoned hophead, this is a wonderful treat and an exceptional brew all around! No matter who you are, try this! It will not fail to impress.","hyuga","Sep 16, 2002"
4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy golden - hue topped by a thick, heterogenous head that leaves lace.  Aromatic citrus rind and pine hop nose perhaps from a Cascade / Chinook combination.  Malt aroma is subdued, and only a light caramel sweetness can be discerned.  The clean, but sharp hop bitterness upfront gives slowly gives way to honey - like sweetness and light bready grain, but hops nonetheless dominate overall.  Hop flavor is wonderfully all American, being comprised of pine, grapefruit & even a hint of lemon.  Although secondary to the hop profile, there's sufficient malt foundation to keep this AIPA from being one - dimensional.  Finishes pleasantly bitter.  A definitive American IPA.  Hops dominate, but they aren't overbearing or astringent.  Surprisingly ""balanced"" for a brew by Stone.  Reminescent of Ruination IPA ""light.""  Stone IPA is well crafted and very tasty.","marc77","Jul 30, 2002"

4.59,8.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Some beers are big, but this one is gigantic.  Pushes the hops envelope with gusto!  Fantastic aroma of grapefruit with a tinge of sweetness (pink grapefruit/tangerine?)  Hops stake a claim in the flavor right from the start, but then back off just enough to let the malt shine through, then the hops settle back in for a slow, bitter finish.  Not over the top with hops, but teetering on the edge.  An outstanding IPA.","Brent","Jul 21, 2002"
4.24,0.5,4,5,4,4,4,"Smell is unbelievable...fresh and spicy with some floral notes...the incredibly complex aroma of this beer is definitely a highlight of it..I could smell this damn thing all night without taking a sip..Taste is very goo..Definitely leans to the bitter side quite heavily, but there is a good malt backbone with some soft caramel undetones...strong bitterness on the long finish...taste doesn't quite match the smell but still very good overall..","ZAP","Jul 18, 2002"
3.9,-7.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I probably should have drank this first. It seems almost boring after the Ruination. Less floral than Ruination, with an intense smell of a christmas tree sap. Smell almost gives me a headache. Stone makes pretty beers and this is one of them. Good head with nice retention, good color. Flavor is surpisingly malty, nutty. Hops strong from the beginning and very short finish.","aracauna","Jul 15, 2002"

Citros, lemon rind, grafefruit and slight pine on the nose.  This is a very balanced IPA in taste.  the hops do not overwhelm, but rather, they are firm in their presence.  The hop-attributed tastes are lemon rind, citrus and pine.  There's some nice bitterness, but not quite enough for my liking.  Very quaffable IPA.","Bighuge","Jul 02, 2002"

4.35,3.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Clearly what we have here is a West Coast IPA. That's a good thing if you're a hophead (which I am...I think). But seriously folks, this is good stuff. Hazy orangish/peach color with beautiful rocky off white head when poured from the 22oz. bomber into my favorite 20oz. pint glass. Big hop aroma. Big citrusy hop flavor that turns a bit milder when it warms (it was a challenge to let this warm as I wanted badly to quaff it down).  Some malt just peeks through and teases but is shut down by more fruity/estery citrus hop flavors. During any session, start with something less aggressive hop wise and work up to this, cause once you're here there's no going back.","John","Apr 10, 2002"
