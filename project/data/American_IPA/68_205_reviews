"Pours a bright copper color with an ample two finger head of fine bubbles that fall quickly to leave a thin layer on top of the liquid.  The aroma is a bit subdued for an IPA as I only get some light citrus and floral character with a touch of sweet caramel.  The taste too is a bit below what I'd expect.  While there is a malty base of caramels and biscuit the hop presence is a bit light.  There is a good deal of bitterness but it comes without much in the way of hop flavor other than some floral tones.  This has a nice dose of tingly bitterness which combines nicely with a good dose of carbonation.  The body of the beer itself may be a little light however.  Overall its just ok or maybe even a little disappointing given my expectations for this."

"This beer is underrated. It's smooth, fruity with some lemon, and had an enjoyable pine bite at the end. I say y'all should get some if you can find it. Cheers!"

"Light bread taste with a dry bitter finish."
"This is an IPA.  The smell is ok although that may be too strong of a word.  But the feel and taste are just shallow and totally lacking in smoothness.  It's got the IPA taste, but that's it.  The liquid is so thin.  With so many other options available, I won't be getting this anymore."

"Almost sweet to the taste"

"On tap at Fast Eddie’s pool hall during date night poured into shaker pint. The appearance suffers due to the pour - no head and super cold. The beer itself is a clear copper and there’s some sticky lacing left after each sip. The aroma consists of citrus and floral hops over top of caramel malt. Citrus juice and biscuit sweetness taste up front with floral and citrus peel bitterness in the middle which mixes with caramel malt in the finish. Medium-light body, a touch thick/resinous, a notch below moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish."
""
""
"I'd buy this again if I find it on tap and I'm real thirsty."
""
"Looked good but looks only go so far.  Taste a was a bit disappointing for an IPA.  Others from Flying Dog are much better."

"O:  I'm not experienced enough to tell how it compares to English or American Pale Ales, but it is definitely hoppy and there is definitely the fruitiness from the yeast.  It's stronger and that was definitely noticeable for me, anyway.  Good beer, I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty well made... clean, soft, fairly balanced... hops are bitter enough and the bitter is bright, clean, un-obscured... English-leaning subtleties..."
""
""
"Very average, lacking in any burst of flavor.  This beer was fresh too, but didn't have any standout qualities worth mentioning."

"Pours to a frothy head with a slightly cloudy body. Head remains for a while before simmering down to a lacy finish. Tropical fruits - particularly pineapple but also caramel fro the malted barley. The malted barley comes through strongly on the taste - a little too strong for me - which presents plenty of bitterness. Not much taste of alcohol considering it's over 7% and the hops are over powered by the Martinez. Lingers well in the mouth. Probably a nice beer if you like malted ales, but too bitter for me"

"O: [3.75] I was hoping that the taste would follow the nose and present with stronger citrus/pineapple (these are flavors that I really like in an IPA).  As the beer warmed these became more prevelant.  Good overall flavor.  I'd like to try one fresh."
""
""
""
"Ok ipa.. Didn't blow my mind.. Has more of a malty taste then hop. No alcohol on the taste at 7.1%"

"O: Less hoppy and fruity than other American IPAs, seemed to work though."
""
""
"Clear pale body with a frothy white head and great lace.. A/T  is sharp bitterness, pine, floral hops.. Slight sweet pale cracker malt.. Simple straight forward ipa.. Every ipa doesn't need flowers and spices and such to make them good.. This one is a great choice."

"Overall: 3.75 - solid IPA, but nothing extraordinary. Leaves you wanting after each sip, but the taste is solid and it's a good bang for your buck."
""
""
"Hazy oraonge colour, with a small white head that does not hold. Yet there's a good lacing. Smell of tropical fruits, citrus , floral and pine notes. Correct carbonation, medium body and dry finish. Taste of resine, tropical fruits, pine, caramel. It's OK, but not the best Brew Dog I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flying Dog's best effort at an IPA. I find that FD usually trades some taste in favor of higher alcohol content. This version manages to nail the best of both."

"A very unspectacular IPA."

"Overall, I found this IPA to be very refreshing. Pours dark golden, with a frothy head of about two fingers. Smell was unimpressive and the weakest characteristic of the beer. Taste was crisp and yet juicy; lots of citrus and hops. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel was good, but not as good as something like 90 minute or Sculpin. Overall, this was a very enjoyable beer paired with awesome art (the bottle was placed over the fireplace as a trophy). Will pick this up again if I run across it."

"O: This is great coming out of the can, which helps preserve the hops from the light. I'd rather buy an old IPA in a can over one in a bottle (or at least one with no date). Good enough, but they have better IPAs and beers that I would go after first."

"Not the greatest IPA, malts need to be tightened up and the hops are equivalent to a pale ale at best. Still not overly off putting just...lacking."

"An IPA that can be enjoyed in summer time and winter hot or cold. Outstanding regardless of the mouthfeel, it happens sometimes! Can't tell it's around 7% which can be dangerous!"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is too bitter for me. Like a two hearted ale that has too many IBUs for this non hop head. IPAs are definitely growing on me, and I enjoy this one, but it's too bitter"

"Interesting that this IPA increases its bitterness throughout the degustation as opposed to otherwise. Felt to me as underrated, probably this is fresher than average and people get very picky in the US with so many good IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very drinkable IPA whihc offers lots of taste and runs very smooth."
"This ale pours a hazy golden amber color with a thick white head that gives way to a slight lacing. The nose is very subtle with some hops and a lot of malt. A little vanilla and toffee peer through on the aroma. The body is light, almost too light. The flavor is malty with a little hoppy bitterness on the tail. Seems more like an apa than an American ipa. Solid beer but nothing worth seeking out."
""
"Overall: very enjoyable. FDB never let's me down"
""
""

"BBD 073/14. Clear medium amber pour with a hint of red. Well formed head with lasting lacing. Nice nose of citrus over a light background of pine and biscuit or caramel malt. Medium bodied with a nice smooth mouthfeel - not quite slick. Well carbonated. The flavor profile is quite complex and very nice. It begins with a brief biscuit that progresses to slightly sweet, then effervesces into a tart grapefruit against a light pine. In the middle the bitterness takes the forefront against a lingering tartness. It finishes with a bit of sweetness over a tart bitterness that lingers. Not the usual IPA, but very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A decent IPA. Definitely not the best, but noteworthy. Wouldn't go out of my way for one, but I would grab one if available."

"O: I may be overly critical when it comes to IPAs; however, along with stouts, IPAs are my favorite kind of beer, and there are so many good ones that my expectations are high. With that being said, I found this effort from Flying Dog to be somewhat lacking, especially in the flavor department. All in all, not a bad beer, particularly for those who may be shy with stronger brews."

"MF – Medium bodied with a medium dry finish. A nice bitterness in the finish as well that dissipates quickly. Almost chewy with such a big malt backbone, which unfortunately lasts on the palate. 3.00"

"Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA ---4/5."
""
""
"Overall not a terribly impressive IPA. Has a lot of elements of better IPAs but they don't really mesh here. Lingering saltiness kinda ruins it for me. I've had worse but I wouldn't get this again"
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a sharp, peppery bitterness up front, but not too strong, but it then lingers with light raisiny sweetness. It's a bit boozy and alcoholic and not complex at all but quite simple. That said, full is good, and has a nice well-rounded quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle slightly cloudy gold. Aroma of rather faint pine, a bit of grassiness to this. Flavor follows with light caramel malts behind what seem to be bland bittering hops. Light to medium mouthfeel, slightly dry, and not as juicy as I like my IPAs. Pretty standard for the style, nothing wrong with it, but certainly not exciting."
""
""
""
""
"o: quite good, interesting, full flavored"

"Pretty cool Flying Dog offers this in a can, an awesome looking can at that. Poured into Westbrook Brewing goblet, very impressive looking brew with a dark gold almost orange color to it. About a finger and a half of head from a fairly aggressive pour. Big hop smell instantly followed by a somewhat citrus aroma, grapefruit or mango maybe? Smells great. Very similar to the smell was the taste with big hops upfront with somewhat of a mild citrus flavor, wish there was a little more there honestly. Mouthfeel is average, somewhat thin I guess. Overall a good quality IPA, one of my favorites but also not the best I've had. I consistently keep this brew in the fridge just because it's sessionable, high quality, easy to find and because I love Maryland."
""
"O--Very good to excellent. I'm a Flying Dog fan, and this isn't their best. It is, however, really good. Quite a good example of what an IPA can be in the hands of quality brewers."
""
"O- disappointing IPA. Very one-dimensional."
"If you're looking for hop bitterness in your IPA, then Snake Dog should hit the mark. A pretty good if rather ordinary IPA offering."
"Poured to a nice full heas, off white in color, which had good retention and lacing. Appearance was slightly hazy with light orange to gold color. Aroma was of some hop and citrus with a little malty / caramell background. Tasted malty and hoppy with citrus notes and some spice. Nice full mouthfeel with a lasting aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
"O: Hops really hung around long after each gulp. Love the hoppiness but not much complexity. High alcohol content hidden well. Taste doesn't quite back up the punch it delivers with the aroma. Good beer, just was hoping for a little more body."
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and thought that it was well balanced and drinkable but I didn't did anything notable. I would drink this one again though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly earthy on the nose. This bellies the bright citrus on the tongue. The color is on the Orange side of golden. A slight speckled lace follows the level of the liquid as the glass is slowly raised and lowered and the bottom comes closer and closer to the top. Not a session beer by any means but refreshing on a hot summer's evening."
""
"o: A good solid medium IPA. If the three and a half months which elapsed between bottling and consumption negatively affected the taste, Snake Dog is even more impressive."

"I would of bought this regardless, just to ad the bottle to my collection - love Steadman's art!"
"Overall: Decent beer! Good for beginner IPA drinkers and great for hot days when you wanna drink more than 3 or so. It drinks very well. Would I have it again? Yes! I would love to find it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much to say about this one - it's unremarkable. Some citrus hoppiness on the nose that carries through to the taste, along with a little mango. Everything seems a little stale and flat, but this sixer is fresh as can be. Hop profile is too thin to cloak the high ABV - the effect is like a slightly hopped up cheap malt liquor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the better pure summer IPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like my IPAs bitter and Snake Dog is rather mellow. Very drinkable however and I would posit there is close to zero aftertaste. A good IPA for the dog days of summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful honey colored brew with a thick white head that lasts forever. Nose is crisp, grassy, fruity hops with a floral note coming through. Clean citrus hops on the palate along with a bit of grass and dried apple. Long, dry finish. Overall solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice transparent orange with a thin but fluffy head. Smells of floral and piney hops. Tastes of piney hops with a tad of alcohol taste, but definitely has some body to it. Beer is carbonated correctly, light/medium bodied, goes down great. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"A good ale for spicey thai, indian, mexican foods."
""
""
"Overall Impression: I drank mine from a can poured into a glass, and couldn't taste any difference from one poured from a bottle. So cheers to the craft can revolution! As for the beer, I quite enjoyed the subtle complexity and nice floral and citrus hops. My favorite part was the toasty finish that is much toaster and slightly less bitter than most IPAs. Overall a solid choice for an IPA on any occasion."
""
""
""
"Lovely looker with nice head on first pour which drops to some very steadman like patterns and leaving some decent lacing on the drinking. but wow. That's an interesting thing happening in the mouth. Living alongside its name. This beer is a bit of a dog with how it can not hide the 7.1 abv it has staked out for itself. It's all there. This might be a better beer with a heatwave, or a deep cold spell or also a burger with red onion and some bleu cheese. But it's not working here for me today as a solo."

"Cool looking can."

"Overall this is a disappointment, after the wonderful appearance and decent aroma. It has no identity with the hop flavor. It's easy to take for granted the ability to have a great IPA since there's so much fantastic work out there by our local microbreweries... which is precisely why I will not choose to but a Snake Dog IPA again."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: A good balance of upfront IPA hop flavors, but nothing behind it to really back it up. Not a bad beer, but a simple and one-dimensional IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark amber color with 2 fingers head that lasted. Cloudy bitter and not too much funk or malt. Lacing well. Just enough hops on the nose to get you into the glass and that’s where I stayed. Good bitter IPA. Light carbonation, bright citrus, a little pucker and a great after taste. This beer would compliment a variety of Chinese dishes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid IPA and easily sessioned. Heavy hop bitterness but still nicely balanced. I would definitely make this a regular go-to if it were actually available in On-terrible."
""
"Agree that this brew has a nice see-saw battler between malt and hops. Like the tannins, wine like feel of this beer."

"I've always been a fan of IPAs and once I seen flying dog snake dog I had to try it. What I look for most in a IPA is the hops and the biterness value. I love the bitterness of IPAs and this beer has it. The hops are not overwhelming but you can definetly tell its a IPA. I think that flying dogs style has great redrinkability as it is not overwhelmingly bitter like most other IPAs. The mouthfeel is great and this beer has a great bite. With 7.1 abv you can't really taste the alcohol but I like this in a IPA. I'm sick of seeing IPAs with 5% abv. Overall this is a great beer and it did not dissapoint."
"O: Very nicely done brew."
""
""
""
""
"like the few other flying dog brews ive had, this one was also a considerable disappointment. I kind of see why they got out of Denver now. this ipa is lackluster. it smells more like an American pale, with nothing at all distinct about the hop profile, and quite a bit of sweeter grain too. the flavor is balanced, but its boring. the hops are mildly bitter, but there is some red malt pushing back. the feel is way too heavy for the style, its filling after one, and its just uninspired to me. the carbonation is fine, upbeat even, but the heft of the body is overpowering, especially without the typical hop bomb type finish to rev me up. I probably am done buying flying dog beer for awhile. it will take something really special to turn me back around on these guys, any suggestions?"

"This is a soild if unspectacular beer. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Dogfish Head glass, the appearance was a clear medium amber with a minimal head, small amounts of lacing and not much head retention. The nose is very floral and bready, fairly nice. Taste is a sweet malt upfront followed by that distinctive citrus flavor that I love. Finish was bitter, but not overly so. This is a great beer for what it is, but hardly the stuff of legend."

"Looks nice; sticky head, Lots of effervescing bubbles. Very dry, lots of resinous hops in the taste, boozyer than 7% should be. Underwhelming smell. Crisp, lots of carbonation. Very hoppy up front but not much else going on. Drinkable, but not a go to for me."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 5/1/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and piney spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, pine, caramel, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, herbal, bread, pine resin, hop earthiness, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, citrus zest, floral, grass, herbal, light caramel, bread, hop earthiness, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Good balance and complexity of piney citrus hops, with a decent malt balance; and hardly any cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, very crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice IPA. Nicely balanced with lots of piney citrus hops; and very easy to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Overall –A decent and fairly easy drinking IPA. It’s a little on the sweeter side and a little low on the hoppiness, but for the most part fairly balanced."

"Hard not to want to love this for the killer artwork, but the bottom line is this IPA didn't blow me away. It's decent, mind you, but I'm more into the big citrus flavors of a west coast IPA. This pours a nice looking light amber color, with a narrow creamy head. The nose has elements of floral hops and bready yeast, whereas the taste combines an earthy, grassy bitterness with a slightly sweet and malty finish. There are also subtle nuances of metal or minerals, which I find mildly off-putting."

"Tasty stuff, a solid American IPA. Certainly hop forward and attenuated; the malt is thoroughly relegated to a back seat. Tons of hop aroma/flavour but the malt and yeast do provide a degree of balance. Would've been nice if the head had lasted longer, but this is a minor quibble. A quality brew that should please any hop-lover; well worth sampling if you have the chance."

"I'm okay with this now, but I may never buy it again. I don't think I'd order it on-tap unless it was one of the only craft offerings available. Not to knock it, but it's just not a stand-out. It's a face you forget about at a party. It's a decent sandwich you ate three years ago. It's forgettable. But, it's good for what it is."

"Overall, I enjoyed this beer as a good IPA with balanced hops. I ate it with spicy food which allowed it to balance out those flavors and gave the bitterness a refreshing, palate-cleansing feel. It would be tougher to drink this alone."

"Pours medium brown color with a good amount of head, great clarity, and decent lacing. It smells very piney with a little citrus after notes. some maltyness up front and then a kick in the pallet by the hops. I very much enjoyed the hops. Fresh and crisp. great carbonation and what i would call a decent to slightly more than decent body. I would recommend if you like IPA's."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but has a better smell in my opinion."

"Pours a medium golden color with a decent sized white head that shows moderate retention and spotty lace. Smells of pine resin and grapefruit with a hint of bread and caramel malt backbone. The flavor is a bit sweeter than I thought based on the nose. Sweet caramel and light sugar and honey malt with a solid hit of grapefruit, earth, and pine. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation, and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Decent ipa, very clean and tasty if not just a bit plain."

"The Crack revealed a puppy that was eager to come out and play. The Glug netted me two fingers of foamy, fizzy, tawny head that fell more quickly than I could type. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose smelled of winter snow in an evergreen forest - cool, minty and man, was my hops jones starting to act up. I had a Victory Hop Devil on the way home tonight and to follow it up with this was to invite trouble. I live for trouble, however, and dove in like the world was about to end. Mouthfeel was medium and the minty hops went to work scrubbing all of those weak, hanger-on taste buds off of my tongue. Phew! My mouth was alive like not in a long time and that snake was slithering around like he knew exactly where he was headed. Yeah, down my throat like a faithful friend. My eyes watered and I gasped for breath as it coiled around my neck with its intense dryness. Jeez-O, man, I've used antiperspirants that were less dry. I was ready for another hit, I mean, swallow and so I lifted the glass back up to my swollen lips ... This is NOT a beer for the faint of heart, but given my habit(s), I CAN shoot the works whenever the opportunity arises. Man and boy, this is a definite CANdidate for Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) as it is sure to take the chill off."

"Not a bad beer, but I find it slightly one-dimensional and unbalanced. If there was more to it than just hops I'd enjoy it more."
"O: A solid IPA complete with great grapefruit and citrus character. Very well balanced and easy to drink at just over 7%. Could get lost in the myriad of IPAs, but it definitely falls in the good/great category. Looks like it's pretty hit or miss though, depending on the freshness (although that's the case with most IPAs). It certainly helps that the one I'm drinking is at most 50 days old (49, if I'm counting correctly and they do the BB for 140 days after bottling)"

"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, orange-copper coloring with a thin, fluffy, foamy, bright white head that quickly settles into a surface cling that also coats the glass. Aromas on a toffee backbone are very complex and blended very well. Hints of orange zest, with basil and oregano spicing, highlight a hops presence that is dynamic, while still providing the nose with the resiny and bitter character people come to expect from an IPA. Smells extremely tasty. Flavors are full and rich, and you get a mouthfull of toffee sweetness on the forward tongue followed quickly by a subtle resiny profile and a little stronger pepper and basil highlight that really balance everything well. Very spiced offering, with a strong malt component that is not usually seen in the IPA field. Borderline malt-bomb, but very tasty. The aftertaste has a great balance of the malt rich and sweetness, with a solid peppery tone that remains consistent from beginning to end. The aftertaste lightens up quickly as the beer approached the end of the palate, and the finish is slick, smooth, with a touch of drying and spicing. Very unique IPA, and the higher ABV never rears its head because it is held in check by the balance of the beer itself. I would seek this out again...this is a very solid brew."

"Pours like'em all; an IPA like color. Nose is malty, sweet, caramel, and some pine and balsam like presence, but not as assertive and complex like some IPA's...seems a bit ordinary. Taste is sweet up front, maybe just a bit too; bitter follows but does not assert. Hop-ness is fine, but I want more. Malt seems a little strong at first, and lingering along with hops, and in a way, interfering with them. Mouthfeel is fine, and carbonation is moderate. Nothing really out of place, just not distinctive in any way."

"There are so many excellent IPAs on the market, in my opinion this beer is not one of them. It lacks a hops bursted nose and finish which really just makes it a bitter beer, not an IPA."
"A great beer although not what I was expecting when I read that it was an IPA, it was a lot more malty and earthy than that but very enjoyable and a good variation of the usual style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was OK but just really isn’t my style of American IPA. It’s just got too much herbal character and sweetness to it, with each sip leading into an assertive finish of resins, spice and bitterness. It’s great to see Flying Dog putting another style in cans though. Let’s hope they keep adding to it."
""
""
""

"Poured into becker pint glass; clear orange/amber with a thin white head that fades after a short bit into nothing. Smell is big floral hops, not much malt to back it though. Taste is bitter spiky hops all over the palate, no citrus/floral flavors at all, and not enough malt to back it up. It's not a bad IPA, but it could use some balance. I love hop bombs but this one is just out of whack."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a bright slightly hazy orangey color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of earthy and bitter hops with a lightly sweet caramel malt backdrop. Taste is also dominated by earthy and citrus hops with a bitter edge and a slightly sweet caramel malt base. Body is about average with good carbonation. Good but more floral notes form the hops would have been better in my opinion."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose and the slurp. All the notes in the aroma were relatively fresh, and the sweeter, fresher hops made for an inviting brew. The taste did little to hide the big booziness, so that became a bit overpowering at times. This is a nice treat for us in the hop-deprived Caribbean, but it doesn’t stand up too well against some of the more robust East Coasters it’s up against."

"O: A good beginners IPA, but if your experienced in the craft and are looking for something to wow you, this isnt your beer! Overall, I enjoyed it but am starting to view the Flying Dog Project as a bit of a disappointment!"
"D - All in all, this is just an unimpressive example of the style, with a peculiar ABV given the flavor profile. I'd rather drink the pale ale by the same brewery."
"I'd call this one a PA, not an IPA, but YMMV. In other words, it is not aggressive enough with the hopping bill, too meek and mild for an IPA."

"Try it you wont be disappointed"
"Initially the flavor is grapefruity and refreshing, but that's followed by a barrage of bitterness and harshness. There's very little malt backbone to support this number of IBUs (only 60, according to Flying Dog's website). This beer just seems to have dried out too much for its own good during fermentation."

"This looks like a pale orange/amber colored brew. I get a piney aroma with some caramel malt backbone on the aroma.

The Ralph Steadman labels look wonderful but I’m still not completely sold on the beers themselves."

Anyway, this is a beer that I'd buy again -- I'm reviewing the third sample from a Flying Dog variety pack."

"Overall: This definitely meets the american IPA cookie-cutter standards. I could drink this all-day, as I am an all-american hop-lover. However, at 7.1% I would become inebreated somewhat quickly. In conclusion, this standard IPA that does not stand-out for me, and I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out, but I will finish my supply."
"O: A strange beast, for sure. It's not as drinkable as it could be (due to its sticky dryness and palpable alcohol), but it's unique flavor profile makes it well worth at least a try. Pair it with sharp cheddar cheese to cut down the astringency some."
""
"O: Not a bad IPA by any means, i've def had worse. Still not a total hop head though but I really enjoyed the grapefruit after taste."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by the 179 day I figure a month in a half old tops. Pours a clear bright orange, with a sticky one inch white head, tons of lacing. Smell orange, pine, grass, and some garlic undertones. Taste is dominated by grass and garlic, with some citrus. Body is medium, nice carbonation, more lush than dry, and very drinkable. This is a nice IPA, especially for fans of a little garlic flavor in IPAs. Two years ago this was one of the better IPAs N.H. could get and it is still solid."

"Review from 7/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light medium copper orange amber. Half finger white head and light lacing. Faint aroma of hops and light malt, very muted. Taste of neutral malt and a moderate hop kick. Finishes with hoppy bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Hard to pick out anything noteable, but actually very nicely balanced and pleasant to drink. Would do quite nicely in a pinch."

"Smooth and sweet with caramel and bready malt flavors. Hops come across as dried citrus fruit with minimal bitterness. Aroma is a dull sweet malt/vague fruity hop combo. Medium bodied, slightly watery, light and fairly easy to drink, though I wouldn't seek it out again."
""
"O: I think they need to tone down the Cascades to let the other flavours shine through."
""
"Taste-Lots of earthy hops, toasted malt, grapefruit-rind bitterness in the finish. Somehow the earthy hops don't quite jive with the toasted malt leaving things a little unblanced. Seemed more an English style IPA than American."
""
"O: The hops are more restrained than I would have liked, leaving the malt profile, which isn't itself that amazing, as the main event. Certainly not bad, but could have been executed better."
"Mouthfeel: This is a winter IPA with a heavier body and low carbonation. It sits heavy on the palate which is great for a cold snowy night by the fire."
""
""
"Overall - Not a great IPA here. It seems to overplay the bitterness and forgo the elements of what makes an IPA truly tasteful. Pretty average IPA."
""
""
"Overall, tastes like a mild amber ale. Not hoppy enough for an IPA. Very malty. Mine could have just been old and oxidized. Drank in Feb 12, and label said 080A12 so it should have been okay until mid March (80th day of 2012 expiration). That said, it was not refrigerated when purchased. I may have to try again."

"O: Last time I had a beer this hoppy was Bell's Hopslam, which is nothing but an extreme amount of hops all the way through. This is an excellent IPA for somebody who likes very strong, bitter hops... or if you enjoy the taste of pine trees. But in that case, I think Alba Scots Pine Ale is far better."

"Very clear orange hue with bright white head. lots of citrus and grapefruit on the nose. little thinner in body than most ipas but very brisk and carbonated. almost refreshing thin biscuit malt presence up front followed by tropical fruit and ends with a very dry and clean bitterness. bitterness is nice and big. flavors are layered in an odd way but otherwise its pretty straightforward for an ipa except for the mouthfeel. some odd flavors of lemongrass and herbs if you dig for them. tries to be complex but falls slightly short and is arranged in an odd matter. thins out on the swallow. different though. worth a try would. be a good summer ipa."

The smell of the beer was moderately hoppy with some malts in there too. The taste of this beer seemed hoppier to me the second time over the first time I drank it.

"Off white head over an amber colored body. Decent clarity, so-so head retention and lacing. Smells like a blend of English yeast and American hops. Hops have a nice piney and citrus quality. What I assume is English yeast smells and tastes floral and fruity. Yeast left a mild sweetness which fits in well with the rest of the flavor. Bitterness is solid and suiting. Not lingering nor scorching. Medium body, with a resinous mouthfeel from hop content. I could go for some more flavoring hops, but this is very good beer. Also the respectable ABV is well hidden. Definitely my favorite Flying Dog brew I've had."

The nose was fairly empty, the taste was bitter with very little backing complexity for balance, but the beer was very nice to look at. I would rather pour and look than drink it. Not drain-pour, but, for me, a bit of a waste of time."

"This IPA has a nice appearance and a pronounced heavy hop bite. However, it lacks balance. The hop signature is singular and the presence off alcohol is too noticeable. I would say this is an Average IPA."
"O- Wasn't crazy about this one. Too much hops, not enough sweetness. Needs more balance."
"poured this one into a pilsner glass.a three finger thick sticky head sat atop a medium copper colored body. taste and smell were both very hoppy. mostly pine and earth with a fair amount of citrus. a little malt also detectable. mouthfeel was medium body with loads of bitterness. overall i felt as thou this could use a better malt presence to balance out better."
"Overall: A very good beer with a nice appearance and great flavors. Definitely recommended."
"O: An excellent choice. It delivers on what it says it is and is modestly priced."
"V: I'm not supposed to do this but I give it an extra half point for good value, partly because you get the great Ralph Steadman label to go with the high quality contents, a nice package for $10 a six-pack."
"O: This beer was a pleasant surprise for me. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but have come to feel that this beer is somewhat underrated. This would be a perfect introductory IPA for someone wanting to get into this style."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky brownish amber color with a half inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of citrus and floral hops, caramel malts, and a bit earthy. Taste is a small amount of hops along with some earthiness and sweet malt flavor. Some floral hop notes at the end as well as some bitterness. Somewhat sweet with a bit of brown sugar flavor. Overall, nothing special but an alright beer to find in a mix 12 pack."
"Overall: It is a decent IPA but I guess after being more into double imperial IPAs I find it hard to go back to singles. I think this would be a good IPA to get someone into the style without freaking them out. A valliant effort by the folks at flying dog but I am unsure if I will pick this one up again."
"O: Solid IPA. Very hoppy, just the way I like it."
"Another from the World Market 6 pack. I feel guilty judging anybody on these ""not so fresh"" beers from WM. Anywhoo, pours a cloudy light amber color with lots of bubbles. Not much head to speak of. Smell is way more malty than I would have expected. I detect no hint of hops on the nose. Malty taste as I would expect, biscuity and bread-like. The hops come through in the finish to balance nicely. Decent tasting beer that I would buy again if it were cheap enough, but def. not something that I would go out of my way to find."
"Pours light copper with lightly tanned, light head. Grassy, hoppy aroma. Slightly oily texture, full-bodied, bitter, acidic taste with an astringent finish. A decent beer but other IPA’s have left me more enthusiastic. This one just seems like it is made for the mass-produced market."
"O: Not recommended. Will not have again. It's not horrendous, but it's surprisingly poor. Not my cuppa tea and not a good example of an American IPA."
"Overall a fun good example and easy drinking ipa. I like this orange hop angle on this beer."
"Ditto on the draft."
"Overall: the pine and bitterness are a little too much. The aroma is weak. Not a favorite."
"O: really great IPA; covers a wide range of quality characteristics for a top-notch IPA to possess"
"I'm a big fan of a good ale on cask. I had a 16 oz. pour of this, and enjoyed every bit of it. This is a marked improvement over the draft and bottled versions of this beer I've had previously."
"Overall, it's an ok IPA. It has all the bitterness, but the flavours are not very distinct."
"o - Overall a pretty average beer. Not bad, but very malty for an IPA. Probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"Do not bother with this one, way too many good IPA’s out there that deserve your time."
"O - Overall, good IPA but nothing to rave about. This beer seems like it has only one or maybe 2 hop variations added to the recipe... I expect a little more for an ipa these days. Although its not bad its not overly good or anything."
"O: Really a good IPA. Nothing crazy about it, but much better than your average IPA. Easily worth multiple buys. Not as good as their Belgian style IPA though..which is an unreal beer..."
"Long, bitter greapfruit finish. Very good IPA for hopheads, I enjoyed it with a curry chicken."
"I think this beer can easily hold up to a Sierra Nevada Torpedo all day long (talking from experience). It's a well crafted and balanced IPA. There is something to be said about a brewer who can precisely incorporate a hoppy pine with an almost honey sweetness."
"Dr: Very drinkable for the style, decently priced as an import, and very good quality. I don't often like IPAs, but this one makes the cut. The best beer I've had from Flying Dog yet."
"Overall I do like it; and what makes it totally worth buying... The price."
"Overall, this is a very good IPA, but it does run the risk of alienating itself because of its heavy bitterness. Fans of hops will find this fantastic, but I doubt anyone who's had anything stronger than a pale ale would deem it the least bit palatable."
"I have 5 others to try!"
"O: This is a nice IPA, but I'm a sucker for the late dry hop additions in my IPAs, which this beer seems to lack. The bitterness builds up pretty strongly by the end and throws off the balance a bit."
"O- This isn't a bad beer, but it really doesn't stand out against other IPA. I would drink it again, but not seek it out."
"Final Thoughts: Certainly and a good tasting and drinker friendly IPA. Would recommend!"
"Drunkability: Not my ideal ipa. I like the spice to it, but it could lose the veggie taste. I would also like it to have more of an up front citrus character."
"D - This has good drinkability. I would have no problem drinking a 6-pack of this in an evening. Overall, I thought it was a very nice IPA, and I would certainly drink it again."
"O - Until I actually started drinking this beer it seemed awesome ... not so much. This is the first time that I've picked up a 6 pack of this beer and I certainly won't be buying again."
"Overall: Kinda what I think of when I think average ipa. Not a bad beer, but also one that does not leave a lasting impression. I could have a couple, but I would just as well have an ipa that tasted a bit different from the norm."
"O: This is a good IPA, not the best, but good nevertheless. The 7.1% ABV cannot be detected, which makes this an easy drinking summer beer."
"Head grows quickly to two fat off white fingers after a medium pour. Stands patient and slowly drops into a nice residual thickness with a snowflake tapestry of lace around the glass. Oily hop and minimal fruit aroma to the nose. Big oily hop taste with a grainy and fruity middle. A bit earthy as well. Some spice is noticed well into the glass. Medium bodied and edgy going down. I could wish for more balance, but I wouldn't want to waste a wish on something so trivial with this beer. Good stuff and probably slightly underrated since its not a craft rock star."
"very good ipa. very straight forward, but by no means an underachiever."
"Poured this American IPA from a bottle into a pint glass. It produced a nice clear amber color and a white creamy head. The lacing was only average. The aroma was full of malt and only slight hop aroma. The taste of the American IPA is a mix of malt, hop bitterness and sweet pear. Medium in body, easy to drink just not as aggressive as i like my IPA's. Very average."
"Taste is nicely bitter, with more pine and sour grapefruit. Not a lot of complex flavors here, but Snake Dog remains a perfectly solid IPA - not outstanding but certainly worthy."
"O: an aboslute hop beating. My mouth is numb. I would have liked to get some more sweet maltyness or some other flavors from the hops but I just got my ass kicked."
"Pours a hazy, medium yellow-orange color with a modest, creamy, cream-colored head. The aroma is predominately a musty hop character, but a little bit of lemon brightens the dull hop character and makes this one seem somewhat light and clean. The lemon comes through in the flavor as well, but there is also more of an herbal character, creating a nice, varied hop bitterness. There is also a subtle bready malt character that balances the flavor profile to some extent. The texture is somewhat resinous, but it finishes quite clean, making it easy to drink down. Overall, although not a remarkable IPA, I enjoyed this beer and consider it to be one of the better selections from Flying Dog's base lineup."
"The could be a refreshing brew on a hot day or perhaps with some spicy food. It's nothing I would go out of my way for because the flavor and smell are so subdued."
"O: Not a bad IPA. In line with the likes of Harpoon or Long Trail. Good if hops aren't really your thing, and you enjoy the hint at fruit, without there being any. Also a fairly decent session beer despite the 7.1% abv tag."
"Taste lacks much hop flavor, maybe some leafy greens but most of the hop effect is on the back end. Grain, caramel and toast show off malt at first, then a rough bitterness takes hold and does not want to let go, lingers for quite some time. The beer lacks any sort of flow, or smooth characteristics. The label descriptions say it best ""...bite and attitude...like your psycho EX..."" yea, not bad - reminds of an old school IPA before all the rage was new hop varietals, dry hopping and juicy hop flavor."
"Overall, a fairly middle-of-the-road IPA. With so many great IPAs, so readily available, I don't see myself going back to this one."
"O: It's a little better than your run of the mill IPA. The lingering bitter finish makes it an interesting beer, but it's really lacking the umph for me to ever buy a sixer of it."
"I'm thinking this will be the final beer of the night. It pours a clear amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, light orange zest, very light pine, and rich caramel. The taste holds notes of pine sap, light grapefruit rind, light orange peel, and mild caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty nice IPA, nothing special, but drinkable and enjoyable enough for an occasional downing."
"overall, a solid but not outstanding offering"
"Overall - The beer would benefit from a little less carbonation and more of a citrus flavour. The beer comes across as more of a English IPA. It's still very drinkable but I wouldn't buy this beer again."
"Notes: Tasted somewhat like a hopped up amber ale. Good although not really a hoppy IPA. Enjoyable for what it is and worth a try. Not going to satisfy a hop fix, but good for a summer night."
"I had this beer on tap at an Orioles game, after a Loose Cannon. Overall, I'd have to say this is a perfectly average IPA. Very strong grapefruit after taste, nice color, solid hop aroma and good mouth feel. I prefer others over this but if you are after a tyipcal IPA, get this one."
"Pours a light amber color that forms a thick white head. The head leaves sporadic lacing along the sides of the glass. Smells of bitter hops, malt, and grass. The hop profile I smell isn't the piney, citrus I prefer in a IPA. Almost smells more of English Hops. The taste falls into the same boat as the smell. The hops are very bitter, but the citrus and pine doesn't shine through. Has a very malty backbone that kind of throws the taste off a bit. This beer is well-carbonated. Overall this is a middle of the road beer. I picked up a 6 pack and won't have a problem drinking them, but I doubt I will ever reach for this one again."
"Will definitely get this again."
"Like the head and lacing but not the pale yellow color. Smells sweet and hoppy. Taste is citrusy hops upfront with a bready finish. Alcohol is evident when it nears room temperature. A decent ipa but pretty boring compared to their other offering, Raging Bitch."
"O: I've had the bottled version of this beer many times... and having it fresh from the tap was definitely a much better experience. If the ABV were a shade low, and this was categorized as an APA, with a little tweaking, this might be world class. As it stands though, this was a meh brew...."
"O: Looked and smelled good, but the taste fell flat, being just too weak. Would try it again just to be sure, but still not something I am going to run out to get."
"Overall, the beer was a good middle of the road IPA. Lots of citrus and malty sweetness flavors, but not very complex. Easy to drink and will more than likely buy again."
"From Notes....Tried the Snake Dog IPA and really enjoyed this beer. The appearance was a decent amber. The aroma was filled with citrus/grapefruite which led to teh nice taste, which came off the pallet clean. The mouthfeel was good even with the higher abv. Quite a decent IPA."
"Definitely recommended."
"1333"
"Overall, not the best option for the style but its managable."
"Pours a very clear golden light amber with a persistent white head. Aroma of biscuit and light floral hop with just the slightest hint of citrus. Taste is spicy, vegetal and light citrus rind in balance with a solid malt backbone. A pleasant east coast IPA."
"Overall - a little too bitter for me to personally enjoy on a long term basis, but for general tasting and enjoyment it's not bad."
"Overall an ok IPA for everyday drinking and a well hidden 7.10% ABV."
"O - This feels to me like a good entry level IPA. It's not overly complex or bitter is well balanced between sweet and bitter. The aroma left a lot to be desired, but the flavor profile is good. I'd have to assume that a fresher bottle would have a much more robust aroma. The 7+% alcohol content cannot be found at all which makes this very easy to drink."
"Snake Bite is not an overpowering IPA and that is just fine with me – a non-hop head."
"(re-visited and tweaked March 2013)."
"A good IPA, well balanced, refreshing but yet inspiring."
"Overall, a good IPA all around. Nothing that really breaks the mold, however. Still, a beer worthy of my fridge space anyday. Could, and did, drink several of these in one sitting, no prob."
"O: Overall this was just okay for me. Too many better IPAs out there will not purchase again."
"Overall - This isn't what I look for in a normal IPA. That said I still liked this a lot and would definitely buy some more, go grab one and see for yourself."
"Overall I really like this one. A very good IPA with good drinkability."
"overall, not a beer i am likely to revisit anytime soon, but im sure itll be offered, and im sure ill happily drink it. too many unappealing hop flavors here, columbus hops i believe."
"O: Good beer, and tastes great in certain circumstances. It's an IPA, there isn't too much about it. Not as sweet as some other IPAs, and I appreciate that."
"Overall a little dissapointing, not much on smell and too bitter that take took over all aspects of taste."
"I had this brew on tap at a restaurant and found this brew fairly boring in flavor, smell, appearance etc. Perhaps their lines from the keg weren't clean and perhaps it would be much better fresh or from bottle. It has some hop bite and moderate bitterness/aftertast but it seemed to just lack flavor and like some of the other Flying Dog's was somewhat rough to drink. It wasn't awful and I could drink it again, it was just a little harsh and lacking in balance and flavor."
"Pours an almost-crystal-clear amber/orange color with a medium white head that diminishes very quickly. Scent doesn't have too much going on. Faint floral hoppiness with a bit of malt and citrus. Taste, however, is much better than the aroma. Although the hops are not as ""in your face"" as I typically like my IPAs...it is a well-balanced beer. This bottle happens to be fairly fresh I might add. I could see this being an absolutely awful beer if it weren't though. There are some lovely pine flavors and floral notes along with nice bittering hops. There is a pleasant caramel malt presence as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a crisp finish. Strong bitter taste at the end. Drinkability is fairly high for the ABV. Overall, a solid IPA. I could see this beer taking a turn for the worst in the near future though. Glad I got it when I did."
"O: kind of disappointing. not terribly so. but i figured with the nice look and initial aroma appeal it would taste a bit better."
"D- Would not go back for another of these. At 7.1% ABV the alcohol is well hidden by the bitterness, unfortunately so is everything else. This is a one-note wonder and frankly I don't find that note very enjoyable. It does look great going into, and sitting in a glass."
"Overall this is an okay but not great IPA. at 7.1% this is a little high in ABV, but still decently drinkable. worth trying."
"Ok IPA, a little sweet, nothing special."
"This is drinkable but nowhere nead my favorite ipa. Does represent the style but not the best characteristics of the style."
"I'm not a massive fan of the alcohol tang to this one, it's got a pleasant smell and a very impressive appearance but the taste left at the back of the mouth was not expected, does taint the overall experience. Still a lot better than most commercial beer mind you."
"I was pretty disappointed in this one. Amber colored with medium carbonation. Biscuity malt smell. Are there hops in this? Taste...yes there are hops, and they are very, very bitter (and not in a good way). This tastes more like an amber that has been mixed with an IPA. Very funky taste to me. No depth to smell or taste. Just funky, bitter malt with strong, strong alcohol. No floral, pine, grass....nothing. Very flat taste. I'm glad I only got a single. Would not buy again."
"Decent looking beer on the paler side with a big white head that slowly dissapates and leaves heavy lacing on the glass. Smells heavy of sharp hops that usually go with good IPA's but not much else to it. Flavor is chock full of very bitter hops at first and its a good start to the taste, but then it kind of just loses it shortly after. Not much complexity, just a crap ton of hops on the front of the palate and then not much on the back. Feels close to water in the mouth, not very creamy or crisp. I give this beer props for the huge bitters on the front side of this beer, but would love to see some more depth to the flavor profile. Decent beer, just not quite cutting it in the competitive IPA market."
"I thought this was a rather boring IPA. Hop profile was bland, might be better labeled as EPA?"
"D- Decent IPA. Would drink it again, if it was available, but im no means would I search for it."
"D - as stated before, this is perfect with bar food, had some spicy garlic wings and jerk chicken sliders"
"Cheers"
"Poured into my Affligem goblet. Nice 1/2 to 1 inch head with some ridges that dissapated in about one minute (not as much staying power as I hoped). Not much smell until the foam was gone; after that, the piney citrusy smell I was hoping for. Taste is somewhat hoppy and citrusy with some complementing malts. Overall a good IPA taste but maybe missing the complexity of their double dog and CA IPAs. Mouthfeel is almost good. Seems a bit watered down next to the IPAs but not complaining since Cruz Campo is the normal beer in my region. Drinkability is good, don't notice the 7+ABV and I do have at least 5 more to drink."
"Snake Dog smells malty and citrusy. The taste is on the lighter side. In style, this is what I like. It has a fruity complexity. It poured hazy amber and had one finger of foamy head. The ABV is high, but not detected up front, but a little in the after taste. There is a little bit of a bite, but I fear that the hops have mellowed. This beer has been in my closet for a few months...oops. Overall it's good. Flying Dog puts out a good product, you cant go wrong."
"Orange, reddish hue with huge retaining 1 inch head. Good lacing. Floral hops, biscuit with citrus notes. A little alcohol is present in the smell. Not as much in the nose as some other IPA's. Nice bitter hop and caramel malt flavor start it off. There is grapefruit like lingering bitterness, but not too much. Good for an IPA in my humble opinion. Nice citrus finish with a little alcohol punch. Not overly complex, yet effective. Bitter hops at the very beginning give way to a smooth middle and nice ending with lingering bitterness. Medium Carbonation. A very nice all around IPA. Not outstanding. But very nice"
"D - A drinkable IPA, but it is lacking something. The way the flavors intermix is great but the way it gets weak at the end just leaves me wanting something more. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this beer, but there are better IPAs and compared to those this is about average."
"Drinkability - Pretty good brew here. Decently balanced in all aspects. A worthy IPA. Very easily drinkable. Good for both Spring and Summer. A little high in ABV for a session brew, but it would still be easy to down a few."
"D- Fairly drinkable but not as many layers to the flavor profile as some others of this style."
"Citrusy nose, with some bready malts as well. The taste is right on the money with the aromas - citrus upfront with a malty backbone and a bitter dry finish. Lighter bodied than I like in an IPA, also seemed a bit under carbed. Nothing special or out of place, just an average run-of-the-mill IPA."
"D: Along with the multitude of flavors, it's got pretty high abv at 7.1%. I don't know if I could manage more than maybe two in a row"
"This is OK, probably better had in the warmer months when you're looking for something easier to drink, but certainly not a hop-lover's IPA."
"D: Despite being a hop bomb, this beer isn't that difficult to drink because the bitterness balanced to a large degree by the underlying malts."
"Palate is bitter right off the bat with some biscuit malt underneath. This seems to be an American version of a British IPA in the true sense. Carbonation is creamy and the hops seem to add more bitterness than flavor. Some faint honey flavor is there too and the finish is rather quick and not overly bitter."
"I thought this IPA was well balanced and mellow but still flavorful."
"This is a great American IPA."
"Drinkability - I'm a big fan of IPA's and big hops but this one is bizarre. Maybe I just need to get used to it, but I have a hard time believing I could drink many of these."
"Poured clear orange color w/ a small head and a bit of lace, very unexceptional appearance-wise but nice enough. The nose is great though, big hops, loads of pine and fruit. The taste doesn't really hold up though. It is sort of bitter and one dimension, astringent w/ a sort of iced tea character. The palate is decent enough, medium bodied w/ brisk carbonation, but I just don't think this is exceptional for its style or in general."
"D: I could probably drink this in a minute, while it's a plus that alcohol isn't really a factor, I expect my IPAs to be too strong/bitter to drink too quickly."
"D- Not very drinkable. Unbalanced and astringent aftertaste that lingers."
"Disclaimer, I am not a big fan of the Salvador Dali-esque graphics, strange beer names (what is a snake dog?) and notations on the Flying Dog brand products. But a high rating on Beer Advocate for the Snake Dog IPA lured me into giving it a try. Once out of the bottle, the Snake Dog IPA has a nice hoppy-sweet aroma, fine golden color and appropriate head. The flavor starts with some good hop and the right amount of a malt base, but then gets thin to the finish with a bitter aftertaste - not in a good way. In my book, there are better IPA's out there. Maybe I am biased, but when you buy a beer, you do buy the whole package, marketing and all. It would take a very fantastic pour out of a Flying Dog bottle for me to overlook the graphics, and this IPA did not make the grade."
"DRINKABILITY: With a bit more malt and a bit less dry-hopping, which would also improved the body clarity, this could have been a great beer. As it is, the brewmaster pushed the edge of the envelope a little too hard and punched right through it into over-bitterness, making this beer forgettable, with nothing to really recommend it. I seriously doubt I'd buy another except maybe to give as a gift to someone I don't particularly like."
"D- This beer smells nice, but beyond that, it's just an average IPA for me."
"D: Haven't had IPAs in a while but was left underwhelmed by this one."
"D -- Meh. Not my first suggestion, not horrible but definitely not great."
"Drinkability: Bitter but no substance, actually hard to drink. Not the greatest IPA by any stretch of the imagination, which is disappointing because both their standard Pale Ale and their DIPA are so strong."
"D: Seems reasonably drinkable but I could see myself switching over to less bitter/hoppier beer with more malt balance after a couple of these. One of the better brews in Flying Dog's mixed case, if not the best."
"D- A very nice all around IPA which is just about the perfect balance for the style. Some are too much where you only want one, some try to placate to those who don't like in your face bitterness. This one should satisy them all...very drinkable."
"I like this. It's got good flavor and good alcohol. It's not over the top hoppy like some IPAs and barley wines, looking forward to trying this with food."
"The mouthfeel is probably a little bit too carbonated and thick for how this beer tastes - the delicate floral aspects make me long for something a little more mellowed out. The drinkability is quite good, the ABV is hidden well, and something about the complexities of the flavor keep me coming back. A very good IPA, and one of the brews that keeps me in their mix packs."
"Very enjoyable. I like it, not the best IPA, but very good craft brew indeed. Would drink again and recommend."
"D: Very inviting beer. Good for the newer ipa drinker, but not anything that will wow you."
"D - Drinks a couple notches lower than the ABV would indicate and the beer disappears pretty quickly."
"Was not sure what to expect with this IPA and my taste buds. Have been drinking stouts. Poured a nice golden amber/orange. Pillowy, fluffy head with some good lacing and stick. Tasted like a solid IPA. The citrusy hops is front and center, some malt but not much. Has some woody characteristics as well. Average mouthfeel, not sticky. I would say this is a pretty drinkable American IPA."
"Good, but not great."
"Overall this is a simple, good, American IPA. Good to drink and doesn't hurt you too much. I return to this on many occassions."
"Overall, a good American IPA. I wouldn't hesitate to drink another, but I don't think I'd buy a sixer if there were other possibilities."
"Drinkability - I could have a few of these without getting tired of it. pretty solid IPA from flying dog and glad this is the first brew of their that I tried."
"I didn't really enjoy this beer, at first it looked and smelled great, but the flavors were way out of balance."
"Drinkability: Slightly above average. I appreciate this beer, but compared to other selections it isn't my first choice. It comes across a bit restrained. Definitely a great beer to pick up when you see it, but not one to go out of your way for."
"d 3.5-4 this is a big, flavorful, ""balanced"" ipa that i am presently holding in high esteem. it's piney, spicy, and citric all at the same time. more dry hopping (or maybe a fresher bottle? don't know the bottling date of this one) would quell concerns about bogging down in the malt and boost this beer somewhere into the statosphere. flying dog seems to me a very underrated brewery. i stayed away for the most part due to their ugly labels and juvenile naming. but let them put out some more stuff that ages well (haven't tried the horn dog yet; there is but a single bottle in my cellar) and flying dog could make it into my personal top 5."
"Pours a clear, carbonated dark gold. Nice patchy head that's got some stick. The nose is a feast of hops, a few distinct smells battle it out. First taste is like wave of piny, citric hops, that ebbs a few times, then retreats back into a subdued malt base. But, oh the splash of hops cannot help but linger on the pallete. Dry finish, a bit of alcohol burn. A suitable IPA that almost acts like an imperial."
"Pours a lightly hazed amber color with thin cap of white froth... scent is of grassy and earthy hops with touches of pine and citrus, some nutty malts and some damp notes... taste comes out muddled, grassy and earthy hops are present, but light in flavor, somewhat high in bitterness. Some off notes of damp paper and mud, a fairly big nutty malt backbone. Medium bodied, ok carbonation. A disapointment of an IPA."
"Drinkability: Despite my distaste for their labels and sophomoric names, I tend to be impressed with the solidness of Flying Dog's beer. Another well put together one here."
"There are some incredible Flying Dog beers, so perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high - but I would vote this beer as an American Amber or a British Pale Ale..."
"D - Even with the mouth puckering explosion of hops present, its still a smooth ride down. Leaves the mouth a little dry."
"This beer has a medium body with a slight aftertaste that seems to wash away quickly and does not leave a bitter footprint on your tongue. It has a nice drinkable feel and it hits you with a well padded alcohol punch."
"D - I am giving this bonus points for the one thing that does impress me is that for a 7.5% brew, the alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable on a hot sunny day."
"D - For 7.1% ABV, I thought it was hidden well, which for me is a good thing. I do prefer a more citrusy flavor, this leaned more towards an earthy/pine flavor. Good beer, just nothing special"
"This beer rolls off the tongue with great flavour and to me is somewhere between medium and light. This beer is a solid contender for a typical ipa and has very solid drinkability."
"D - I think this one is fairly average. I'm sure you could sit and have a couple but there are better."
"If you can get past the cartoon label, this is a good IPA. I'm glad I took a chance."
"D- could throw back several with ease but why would you want to when there are so many IPA's that are superior to this one."
"Copper pour with a 1 finger white head and some nice lacing. Great pine and floral aroma with earthy malt and some tropical fruit notes. Lots of bitter pine flavor upfront with a balance of topical fruit and sweet chewy malts in the finish. Medium body with a nice creaminess to it. I've gotten to be a little jaded after drinking so many ipa's lately but this stands out. Lots of great hop character without going over the top for the style."
"A bit rough. Medium bodied, medium effervescence. Some warming. Decent but could use a bit of nose and more taste."
"D: Could definitely sit down with a friend and six-pack and thoroughly enjoy it."
"Pretty strong alcohol bite at 7%. I could drink 2 of these in a night, wouldn't want to try for more."
"Flying Dog Brewery--Snake Dog IPA--India Pale Ale 12 oz. Bottle purchased 11/24/2010, Sampled 11/24-25/2010. 6-Pack $8.99 @ Colorados Liquor Outlet, Colorado Springs, Colorado. 7.1% ABV. 60 IBU's. No sediment. Thin foamy mild lace white head. Clear rich bright light amber gold color. Mild citrus grapefruit floral Columbus hop front. Medium textured mild sweet caramel citrus fruit mildly hop infused body. Clean slightly bitter dry citrus end. Mild hops, thin tasty body. Good, but not exceptional. (3.75 / 5.0)"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a golden / copper with a small off white head. Aroma of floral and citrusy hops. Taste is citrus bitter hops with some malt. Palate is med to fullbody with moderate carbonation. Finish is dry bitter citrusy hops, some malt . A lot of flavor, hops definitely dominate this brew. Overall a good IPA."
"Drinkability is so-so with an overpowering bitterness and stringency and light minerality. Not much in the way of booze though."
"Drink- I'll probably have it again, but not 1st on the list."
"D- Definitely a good IPA, something I would not mind have again."
"Golden amber in color with a decent 1/2"" off white head. Sweet floral aroma with a hint of peach. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and airy. Snake Dog is hoppy, yet almost fruity IPA. Light malted front leads to a hoppy middle. Notes of peaches emerge in the middle and are followed by piney hops. The finish has a residual bitterness that hangs around the top of the throat and lingers for quite some time. Very enjoyable for a 7% abv IPA that seems much lighter because it's such an easy drinker."
"D. A really nice, delicious IPA from Flying Dog. Not sure which I prefer better, this or their Classic Pale Ale, i just wish I had a few more to sink down. Feels weaker than the 7.1% ABV stated on the label."
"d- very enjoyable beer,doesnt stray too far to the bitter side or the sweet side, a nice balance without being lame like some overly balanced beers"
"Yuck!"
"THe beer is a hazy color. Looks almost orangish like a belgian wit. The smell is of citrus and some fruity notes. There is a lot of caramel malt flavor, ends with a hop citrus bitterness. I think there is to much malt emphasis for an ipa. It says they use caramel 50 and 60, it would be interesting to find out the ratio they use."
"D- snake dog is a big time ipa. You can't neccesarily slam them because of the strength of the malt. You can however, enjoy it"
"D: a quick buy again, extremely drinkable offering from Flying Dog. All the common characteristics of a good American IPA."
"drinkabilty was just ok for me - a decent IPA but not the best one out there - I would drink it again -"
"Appearance has a nice golden color, good head with lots of carbonation right out of the bottle then settles into nice slow bubbling.Smells pleasant, floral and tame. Taste bites with just enough to let you know its an Indian Pale Ale without being to overpowering. This is a smooth beer that sits on the tongue a while. I would drink this again it has a nice rounded equal taste."
"*from notes"
"I was craving an IPA today, and I almost opted for an old favorite (Avery's Imperial India Pale Ale), but saw this on the shelf below and decided to give it a try. Not a bad brew, Flying Dog."
"OK IPA, but there are better for the money."
"The hops explode onto your tongue and leave a lingering bitterness. Malts chase everything. This isn't a complex brew, but it's not too shabby."
"overall, Flying Dog is terrible...i will never buy their beer again"
"D: Easy drinker, good for more than one. Well worth a try."
"I like it, would have it again but didn't rock my world, missing a step to be an awesome beer."
"In my overall opinion of this particular beer, I wasnt impressed and I wouldnt buy it again. Not a big fan of IPA and this isnt an IPA to buy even if you like that type of beer. Im currently suffering through it and I wish it had some type of flavor other than death...."
"Overall this is an average at best IPA, I felt it was unbalanced and didn't have much to offer in the flavor department, a one trick pony."
"Actually a nicely hidden 7.1% ABV, drinks like a 6.0%. Nicely carbonated, fruity bitterness lingers after each sip. Not a bad beer."
"D: The hops are a bit too strong in this one, but otherwise a decently drinkable brew."
"D: A decent IPA that is worth repeating and worth seeking on tap. No real stand out points but well made and fresh tasting."
"D- wouldnt drink this again but it served its purpose for me"
"Overall not bad, but I'll also never buy it again..."
"O: Not one among the best, but it's really nice. Will drink again definitely."
"Overall this isn't a bad ipa at all. Nothing special but definitely drinkable."
"Overall, an okay IPA. I've certainly had worse, but I've certainly had better. Maybe if I can come across a fresh one, or better yet, on tap, I will review it again. I don't know how fresh this one was, FWIW."
"Poured a tawny brown/ruby red body that is well-carb'd with one-finger head and lace with a sour citric fruit smell for hops and some faint malts but rather nondescript aroma. A real dry beer; very hoppy but has a strong breadiness/huskiness to it and a bitter hop presence leads to the somewhat harsh dryness. Not much sweetness or balance and ends with a rather bland sour finish. A strong IPA that was nice to sip on but one is enough and I won't be bothering w/ again."
" ~ Overall I recommend you give this beer a try. It goes down well and is remarkably light."
"D: I think I could drink a lot of these, so the drinkability is great. The hops don't stick around and build up as long as other IPAs in my opinion. It is pretty tasty and smooth. Again, the drinkability might be a 5 if it were just a bit more bubbly."
"Plenty of widely distributed IPAs out there that make this one look foolish."
"D - Taste aside, I would have more than one in a sitting. As I kept sipping the beer, the bitterness lessened. What helped was that I had the IPA with a spicy meal, and it went really well."
"Good to have pretty cold because as it warms the mouthfeel loses some zing."
"I could definitely have more than one in a row. Refreshing but keeps you wanting just one more sip...dangerous!"
"D - A nice example of an IPA, especially from the East Coast. This right coast concoction can holds its ground against the West Coast counterparts. Personally, I think it could pass as a West Coast IPA. This beer hasn't gotten enough credit."
"Copper orange with a deep haze and thin head that leaves a decent white cap. Lively carbonation. Floral orange and grapfruit aromas. Pretty smooth feel with a buttery smooth ending. Heavy hop character with ornage and pine, too much for malt flavors to fight through.it spicy/peppery in the middle and a fairly bitter finish and aftertaste."
"D: The tropical flavors make me want some more. This range of flavors is one reason that I love IPAs."
"D- Good for an IPA, smooth and easy."
"Ehh.. not a bad IPA, but there are other options out there if you're looking for a hop fix.. but this really isn't bad."
"Would definitely recommend."
"Pours a medium amber with nice woody orange hues and a cream colored head that sticks around forever and leaves messy lace. The aroma is full on American IPA. It is predominantly pine, but with a good amount of grapefruit and citrus. It has a pretty classic C hop aroma, and a nice one at that. It also carries a sweet caramel malt aroma that gives the citrus a bit of a candied character. The hop profile is a bit different in the taste. Still plenty of pine, but the grapefruit is a bit more white than ruby red, with more pith than in the nose. There also is a bit more of a spicy herbal thing going on in the flavor and the malt is further in the background with some grainy astringency. Perhaps that is the real issue here. It just seems to be a bit unbalanced with the hops tipping the scale. The body is on the lighter side of medium with a bracingly bitter finish that is pretty sticky. This is a fairly drinkable IPA, if not a bit of a palate bruiser. As mentioned above, it has some balance issues, but is still a fairly solid offering."
"I like this beer and would drink it again - there are better IPAs, but it is enjoyable. Out of the six beers in the Flying Dog variety pack, it is the only one I would drink again."
"A good and somewhat interesting IPA, but there are plenty better out there."
"Drinkability - very drinkable"
"Drinkability: A good IPA that has plenty of flavor, aroma, bitterness and even alcohol content. This one is worth having multiples of and also would stand up well to most dishes. Worth revisiting."
"D - It's a decent IPA that I wouldn't particularly recommend over any other IPA, but it's definitely not bad. I may buy it again depending on the choices available nearby. It's good, but not good enough to make me seek it out actively."
"Pours a nice golden amber color from the bottle into a standard pint glass. White head builds to about one finger and sticks around some with little lacing. Smell is very piney with a faint grassiness. Tastes is bitter pine and has some malt but very light. Feels crisp but not as oily as expected for an IPA. Drinks well and is an enjoyable IPA. Not epic but enjoyable."
"Drinkability is pretty decent tho I prefer two from the sampler over a six pack."
"First the more I drink it the better I like it. Medium amber color with small bubbles. Thin white head that stays until the last sip. Light birch smell with a hint of citrus. Good hop flavor with a moderate bitter bite. Pleasing bitter aftertaste. Drink temperature started at 47F and continued thru 64F. The warmer, the better. When it gets warmer, there is less bitter bite. Couldn't find a brew or drink by date, just 292FX10 under the UPC. Bought six pack at the Warehouse Package Store, Valdosta, GA. Just less than a dollar a bottle without tax. Not a waste of money might buy again, after sampling the Flying Dog line carried at the Warehouse."
"single bottle split with Dad"
"Glad I only bought one bottle, I'll not be getting another, just not my taste, sorry to all you hophead types!"
"As soon as I saw the bottle it was like wtf...but not knowing what was instore for my taste buds nothing but a delicious drink. Not to cold not warm just at a perfect temp enough to taste every single citrus flavor with ease. Highly recommended to me and now highly recommended to others.."
"Very light yellow color, looks like fizzy yellow beer. Moderate hop character, less so than most IPAs. Very drinkable but overall flavor is not what I expect from an IPA, but light flavor is definitely not offensive. Aroma and aftertaste of honey. Not bad, but not great, would be easy to finish too many as its taste is light for a 7 %er"
"I would not pick this out of a lineup of premium American IPA's, but it definitely serves its purpose and is a solid beer that I would not hesitate to buy again."
"D- Typical IPA. Bitter with a good amount of hops to it. Middle of the road IPA. I could drink it, but aren't running out to find it."
"D - Not bad. It's not a huge hop-bomb or anything but I can easily knock back a few of these sitting on my back porch or while grilling. Overall it's pretty much what I expected out of a 12-pack sampler."
"Taste is a bit more balanced. Not so bitter, yet pleasant, followed up by slight hop bite in the end. Feel is obviously slick with those great hop oils, not too drying. Good drinkability, though could be packing some more flavor for my taste."
"Future outlook: OK, but absolutely no reason at all to try again."
"Poured in a pint glass. Look: Dull brown color, lots of bubbles, a thin white layer of foam, like a snowy field. Smell: Pine and floral hops, some biscuity malts at the background. Taste: Pine hops, wood and small proportion of toffee malt. Mouthfeel: Semi woody finish, very dry, extra bitter, medium body, very smooth. Drinkability: Would have been better with more body."
"I was happy to try this, pretty decent IPA all in all."
"The head was white and thin, it seemed to be lightly carbonated. The initial smell of cascade or citrus hops where strong. The hop smell quickly disappeared and the smell was a little like a light beer. This beer has a good taste and a good balance between hops and malt. For an IPA it's not that bitter, which your looking for. It's also a little watery. This IPA has a crisp carbonation on the tongue and a slight citrus pine in the back of the throat. This beer is very drinkable. People that want to try IPA's should start with this beer. As I stated, it's watery/not as bitter compared to other IPAs. I would buy this one again."
"D - I really wanted to like this beer. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but as far as American IPAs go, this one will have to take a back seat to some of the other offerings in the greater Boston area."
"Snake Dog IPA is a beer I would gladly buy from time to time as a rotation among the IPAs available to me. It is nicely bitter and refreshing and has a unique flavor profile from other IPAs."
"Ok for an IPA. Some of the flavors are a little off though. It gets the job done and is refreshing nonetheless."
"Cask opened: May 2010"
"Drinkability is good, i could put down a few of these down. Its pretty good, not my favorite."
"The mouthfeel was fine, and it was drinkable, but I was a little disappointed by this one. I probably won't buy more."
"mouthfeel light, especially for the style, but passable. otherwise very smooth, with good carbonation."
"I like this beer and would go for it again."
"Picked this up because I had heard nothing but good things about this brewery... I must say I was rather unimpressed. Poured into a standard pint glass the dark copper colored beer gave way to about an inch head that went away rather quickly. Giving the beautiful color I assumed this was going to be a rather hoppy IPA.. unfortunately this wasnt the case... mouthfeel was very nice.. very smooth and creamy... but the taste was lacking in the hoppiness ipas usually have. Slightly fruity and not very carbonated... I wouldnt really suggest it if asked about a good ipa....not a bad summer beer though.."
"Poured a light amber with a small, one-finger head. Lacing was thin but lasting. Not a great deal of carbonation was visible. Nose was citrus (grapefruit) and pine. Taste - citrus and pine and relatively sweet malts underneath. There is some bitterness fighting with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is lighter than many IPA's (watery?). I found this an OK IPA but without much to set it apart. It wasn't awful but not terribly interesting either."
"I almost poured this out upon first nose/taste, but decided to weather this storm. My opinion is close to most others - Happy with the appearance, but upon smell, and taste, could not find an affinity. Somewhat musty nose, also reminds me of an electrical-ion sort of essence. To me, not a lot of hop character, hardly drinkable, decided to sewer the last 6 ounces. Sorry Flying Dog, until now, I hadn't met an IPA I didn't like."
"D- Meh... ok but certainly not the best IPA out there. It was nice to have that different buttery taste from other IPAs but I am still not sure if I like that or not!"
"Tried this at the recent City Paper Brew Fest in Baltimore. This one was one of my favorites of the day. Very hoppy and very drinkable throughout. Would definitely seek this one out again and am looking forward to trying other offerings from Flying Dog. Best of all, I get to support ""local"" breweries."
"-Not a bad beer by any means just prefer other IPA's over it."
"O - I'd never buy this again, however if a friend offered I'd drink it."
"Mouthfeel is medium light with a fizzy amount of carbonation."
"Poured into a pint glass, dark amber with great creamy 2 finger head. Great retention. Smell Sweet with some malt but predominant fruity hop character. Taste was similar, but an unpleasant watery character up front. Not bad, just not good. Big fan of the big Flying Dog beers but their smaller ones dont seem to measure up."
"D - mixed on this. started with high hopes but quickly came down to earth. not a bad IPA though, desperately needs some body to carry everything else. might go down well on a hot summer day."
"From the 355 ml. bottle marked 216FX10. Sampled on April 9, 2010. The pour is copper in color with a bit of cloudiness and a quarter inch foamy off-white head that really lingers on. The aroma is notably hoppy as expected but also it carries a bit of orange zest or other fruitiness in the background. The texture of the body is creamy and smooth. The taste has a great hoppiness up front and a little more bitter in the backside. But overall it is a fairly nioce IPA."
"D: Average at best. It's not a bad beer, but given the number of solid IPAs available right now, this one won't be a go-to anytime soon."
"D - Not a bad beer but there are much better IPAs out there."
"Drinkability: Too sweet for more than 2 or 3 in a sitting for me, but overall, not a bad tasting IPA."
"This started off very promising but eventually any malts are drowned out by the hops which wouldn't bother me except for the hops just aren't that interesting."
"Overall this beer is not bad, but really not impressive for the style."
"***A less than 1 month old bottle enjoyed 6/19/12 revealed a much better IPA. Still a bit one-dimensional with the Columbus hop onslaught but juicy, fresh, and punchy***"
"Overall Impression: Not a bad IPA, and it's not a bad value. Certainly worth trying out"
"Overall, it looks great, but only has decent flavor, It just seems to be missing something, just not as good as some other American IPA's out there. This is one I would still want to try on draft."
"D - Well I have 4 more and really don't like IPA's but I almost reviewed it as the Gonzo which says it's almost as drinkable as a porter!"
"Drinkability suffers from lack of balance. Don't think I'll be trying this one again. I like hop bombs but there are so many more out there that have much better taste with equal hop bitterness."
"Poured an amber color with a 2 finger off white head that took a minute or two to dissipate. left some nice lacing down the glass. Not a bad ipa. Nothing incredible, but very drinkable. Nice floral notes throughout, with a slight bit of hop citrus as well. Tiny bit of a sweet malt backbone, which was enough to keep it balanced as the hops werent overpowering at all. Nice mouthfeel, medium bodied with a noticeable but not offputting amount of carbonation."
"D: sessionable but too mild for my personal liking; having so many west coast styled IPAs, my palate simply may not be accustomed to such lighter IPAs, probably won't go back to it any time soon"
"drinkability is good - another solid brew from FD"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It is well balanced and easy to drink especially considering the high abv. I will definitely be picking this up again and checking out more of Flying Dogs offerings."
"M&D- Pretty light body with a fizzy carbonation make for a relatively easy-drinking beer, despite the raging bitterness found in IPAs"
"D: Average if not below average IPA. Could drink but not if I really wanted hops. Disappointed with Flying Dog on this one."
"Pours a medium clear amber with small white head. /good lacing throughout. Aroma is not strong, but good. Taste is well balanced - tart, sour, dry, fruitful with just enough malt presence to balance it all out. Good beer and would purchase again. Would put it in top third of IPAs I've had - -- Cheers!"
"Overall, I think a very underrated IPA. I will gladly have this again, given that it is fresh."
""
"D- IPA Bitterness could make it tough to drink more than a few."
"Drink: Its malty start and earthy bitterness makes this beer more enjoyable the flavor from the finish and the start mix quite well."
"O: Great drinkability. Delicious American IPA specimen"
"O: very well balanced, clean and enjoyable, could use more assertive flavor"
"The taste also suggests a muted hop profile, reminiscent of an English IPA more than the American counterpart. Snake Dog starts off sweet and toffee-rich with lots of pale and caramel malts, too. Decent balance of hops, but the bitterness is mild and in the ""Pale Ale"" IBU range. Finish falls flat, as the thin, under-carbonated body is sluggish and creamy on the back of the palate. Now I remember why I haven't drank Snake Dog IPA since I first started enjoying craft brews over 5 years ago...I think I'll pass for another half decade."
"The beer pours reddish-orange with a large white head. The aroma is resiny hops with some citrus notes. The flavor is resiny hops and something that resembles grapes. Low to medium bitterness. Medium carbonation and thin-medium mouthfeel. A decent American IPA, but nothing special."
"Pours a clear light amber with a small but foamy head. Smells slightly tropical with melons and oranges. Taste follows with slight tropical notes, sweet up front, leading to just kind of a harsh bitterness...Aspirin. Astringent mouthfeel and finish. Well carbonated. Not too bad, slightly better than your average IPA."
"Notes: It´s true that this may not match the bill of an IPA for most, and maybe my appreciation that for an instant made me think of a DIPA, is more of a wish on my part of what it could be than what this is headed for. Hoppy amber then? Dunno, and in any case is rather quaffable. Good but sure enough not the best offerings from Flying Dog and while not avoidable not an IPA that I will look for in particular."
"Good drinkability here. Sometimes you don't need a total hop bomb, this is a pretty good balance between lots of hop flavor without being overly bitter or intense."
"Pours out a clear light orange-amber with a two finger head that has decent retention and is creamy. The off-white head leaves medium-thick lacing behind as I drink this one down. Smell is of nice, fresh hops. The hops are mostly citrus/fruity to me with some earthy ones in the background. The pale malts come through in the aroma a bit also. A well balanced aroma starts this beer off well. The only criticism is the aroma could be a bit stronger. Taste is good. The fruity, earth and citrus hops have less flavor than aroma but their bitterness is not missed. The bitterness is a bit too high in comparison to the hop flavors. The malts in the background come through well and help balance but the bitterness still dominates. Tone down the bitterness and this beer is much, much better. Mouthfeel is good for the style. Light to moderate body with medium carbonation and really no warming. Nothing wrong here but I would like a tiny bit more substance/creaminess. Drinkability is good. The price/ABV ratio is spectacular and the flavors are nice. The bitterness might get to me after 3-4 of these but it is still certainly sessionable. I am glad I tried this beer and will continue to try the Flying Dog ales."
"Drinkability: Overall its above average for drinkability: ABV is a bit on the high side but nonetheless its drinkability is pretty good. I would try this again and its often passed over when i go to the store."
"From the 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, this light caramel colored beauty poured to leave a 1.5 inch head of medium density. Hop heads like myself ought to love this IPA with its slightly sweet, moderately robust but smooth taste that lightly slaps the palette and tingles the tip of the tongue after every drink. Light lacing. Average drinkability. Enjoyable..."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white creamy head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with some citrus notes, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, malty, bitter, with some citrus notes and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this one is pretty tasty."
"Overall, seems a little one dimensional. It's above average, but not by much. There are better IPA's out there."
"D: should reach my fridge from time to time. Flying Dog has some nice stuff and this is one is of good caliber. Sweetness takes hold a little more than I care for in an IPA and I think that the hops could stand to be amped up a bit. Anyway, still pretty solid"
"D - Not a very drinkable beer. The bitterness makes it difficult to even get through one bottle. Not enough going on with the flavour aside from the bitterness."
"Overall- not to shabby of a brew but nothing special. i don't get the watery oily feel from the mouthfeel. i would recommend trying just a single first and take it from there."
"I like this IPA quite a bit. Not the best I've had by far, but it fills out the basic checklist for what an IPA should be: flavorful, hoppy, and refreshing. Pretty solid beer."
"Not the customary hop profile. A little sweeter, but still bitter. Degrades through the drink. Now that they're on the other side of the country, and no bottle dating, getting a fresh bottle is even tougher."
"Clear amber and very stagnant looking. Large white head that disappears by sip #3. Citrus hop aroma with some pine fortification. Mild alcohol and cider malt. Taste unimpressively parallels aroma. 60 IBUs come through primarily in taste and aftertaste rather than bitterness. Juicy mouthfeel with a crystal sugar blob in back. This is pretty lame."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly hops, some citrus. Taste is very hoppy and bitter, a bit to much for me. Feels light in the mouth. One of these was enough for me. Overall not a bad beer, but not really to my liking."
"Note: Probably the worst IPA I ever drank."
"Smooth IPA, good body but not syrupy or oily. The carbonation ensures that the flavors get to every nook and corner of your palate. A sessionable beer - well bodied to be a sipping beer, yet not too heavy not to be considered for sessions. Overall, another class act from Flying Dog."
"The pour was clear and golden amber in color. Strong citrusy hops with some pine residue in the nose. There's also a hint of sweetness...maybe caramelized brown sugar. Taste was decent, but all I could think was grapefruit. I was just left with a bitter grapefruit taste. I typically like such a finish, but this was just a bit overdone. It was very drinkable and the alcohol is unnoticeable at 7.1. I'd just like to be left remembering tastes other than simply grapefruit."
"The best thing this beer has going for it is the 7.1% alcohol volume. With all the terrific American IPAs out there I doubt I'll be anxious for another Snake Dog anytime soon. I'm simply not impressed."
"Drinkable enough, with a very nice smooth and clean profile. Tasty, but a little subdued, with true notes of the classic American IPA."
"A tasty drop with nothing leaping out to ruin or mar its flavour in any way. For a 7.1% IPA, very mild, and yet with all the right flavours in the right doses. An excellent beer."
"D: a struggle to drink, from start to finish. Unsubtle."
"D: I prefer more balance in my IPA's. (I know that sounds weird.) This one feels like someone was going for the bitter win."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, easy drinking IPA. Not the best but I'm digging this one."
"Pours orange-red. Nice caramel-beige head builds with big and small bubbles. Fizzes down quickly leaving minimal amounts of foam on the sides of the glass. Smell and mouthfeel are definitely the high points of this beer. Honey drizzled oranges and apricots with freshly cut spruce limbs in the nose, the taste brings bitterness midpalate and less so in the finish. Spruce, bitter orange and lemon peels with a ruby grapefruit character in there cleaning up towards the end. Mouthfeel has tiny bubbles, yet ample amounts of them making the feel silky and bubbly and lively on the tongue. Overall not very impressive, much better examples are more readily available in my city. Still worth a try. Kind of."
"Drinkability: A second placed DIPA I'm afraid. It is a very competitive style and this doesn't live up to the likes of others"
"D: The bitter hops over power, and not enough flavoring. Again may be too harsh from the person not use to a strong hops presence."
"Drinkability: you know, it's not bad; however, I won't be seeking it out in the future."
"There was plenty of body and feel was sticky with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it crisp with a little bite. A bit dry towards the end but not as much as some. Not the best IPA out there, but definitely not bad and one of the best from this brewery I think."
"Overall it's alright but these days, that's just not good enough."
"A very good beer, and I expect no less from Flying Dog. But the Brewery has several beers with such character and uniqueness that a beer like this--although a delicious, well crafted IPA--just pales in comparison. Don't get me wrong, I'll probably finish the 6 pack tonight, but I expect a beer that I will remember tomorrow morning. Anything less than fantastic just doesn't cut it with Flying Dog."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a decent creamy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, grass, and citrus and resin hops. Flavor is sweet malts, a touch of fruit, orange, and pine resin. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and bitter. Pretty good beer, fairly well balanced."
"D: Eased into this very fine American IPA. I got rolling though. Somebody get me another."
"A decent American IPA but lacking in the hop flavour that drives this style. Bitterness isn't enough to make a good beer."
"One of my favorite IPA; i'd prefer it over just about any."
"Another HR from Flying Dog"
"At best, a decent IPA."
"D: This brew really is a middle of the road IPA. Malts are a little off and the hops come in a bit strong and a bit suddenly at the end. Balance is somewhat off."
"Hits with a balanced flavor that fades into a bitter hoppyness that coats the tongue. The hops are mostly herbal tasting and balanced for the style for sure, but I still feel the malt character on this is weak. The whole mouth feel is a little thin and this brew ends up coming off like a decent IPA that watered down."
" Well done to another ""local"" brewery for me. There are a few beers from these guys I really like. This is now on the list!"
"This is all strictly my opinion but in regards to an IPA this beer failed miserably. It was not a good beer and i can't even recommend it to anyone, i still 5 of these in my fridge sitting there because i can't stomach them or bring myself to try another one."
"This is a decent but not great-drinking IPA, I'd say. I have no problem with unbalanced hop bombs, but I feel like if an IPA is going to be unbalanced, the hop bouquet should be a little more interesting than it is here. This is by no means a bad IPA, but with so many other options on the shelves, I can't really see myself going for this one."
"M/D - A little sticky but I'm not surprised by that from an IPA. Well balanced and probably better fresh. Easy to drink but deceptive, 7.1% ABV is masked well."
"This beer pours a pale see thru copper colour with average carbonation that leaves a one finger head and a ring of lacing,the aromas are strong piney hops and honey,caramel malts,it has an above average mouthfeel which finishes very smooth and only slightly bitter by my standards with nice tastes of peaches,stonefruit dipped in alcohol followed by some nice full malty characters at the finish to balance out its bitterness and the 7.1% is well hidden."
"Taste was bitter but not overwhelming, hardly any aftertaste, but the bitterness builds as you drink. Mouthfeel was full and satisfying. I really like this beer. I think its OK as an IPA but a good beer overall. I recommend it as an East coast pale ale. Seems a little weak for an IPA over all, but probably a bit too strong as a pale ale. Check it out."
"Drink is very good for 7.1% ABV. This was the last one out of a tweleve pack with six different beers and I just loved this one."
"D - This was a decent IPA...I'm glad I got to try and I could drink this one if it was around...now it's on to it's bigger brother"
"A fine example of an american IPA. Well made and easy to drink. A light copper appearance. Abudance of carbonation . A typical fruity bouquet of an IPA . It has grapefruit and wild citrus aromas.Taste was of an average american IPA . The bitterness and acidity is well represented .What a wonderful mouthfeel and easy to drink with food. Overall a great beer from Flying Dog."
"Beer unfolds into a glass as a rich golden amber and forms a foaming head that retains its character and fades slowly. Hops aroma of pine and citrus are prevalent. On the palate the beer feels light and thing, and a subtle malt flavor yields to a building, albeit, not overpowering bitterness that is highly drinkable but nothing special."
"Drinkability: A well-rounded IPA. Not totally hopped like many of the style, so not good for hopheads, but I appreciate the balance in this brew."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA. Certainly not the best, but you could definitely do much, much worse. Worth a try."
"I've decided I like it a lot and that it would really be good with all kinds of food flavor profiles."
"OVERALL: Good beer. Flying Dog has deinitely grown on me. Enjoyed this one much better than their Double Dog IIPA, which was a bit too rough around the edges. One I would pick up again."
"Poured an amber with a modest head that reduced quickly to a thin skin. The aroma was typically IPA... citrus (not that there's anything wrong with that). The taste was a slightly hoppy citrus with a malty finish. The feel was light bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. Typical IPA, but I like typical IPA's."
"Pours a nice dark copper with some decent head and a bit of nice lacing. Excellent scent, very hoppy with wonderful citrus and slight floral tones, with the hint of malt in the background. Nice taste, excellent use of hops for bittering, aroma, and flavor; great citrus hop flavor with a nice bitter aftertaste. Excellent brew."
"Drinkability: This stuff is mighty tasty, not overly hoppy like an imperial but just the right amount. The abv might throw people off from slamming down a bunch of them in a night but this would definitely be a good choice in my book."
"Despite this beer not having much character, it is quite drinkable. There is nothing offensive about the smell of flavor of the beer, there is just not a lot going on. It is fairly week for an IPA. I think this is the light beer of IPA's. I'm quite suprised that the ABV is as high as it is (7.1%). I would put this in the same category as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale; nice, non-offensive ale."
"Poured a nice amber color with a good head into an American pint glass, with little carbonation. This is a great beer for hopheads, as both the nose and flavor were overpowering with bitterness. The taste did yield more hints of citrus than the nose, but the finish was very bitter, and extremely dry. I felt like taking a sip of water for every two or three sips of beer. The body was medium, with soft carbonation, but I couldn't escape the dry-tongue feeling. Mildly good session beer for the hophead."
"D - Great time to drink. Doesn't get too alcoholic, but might get a little boring. Every sip packs a punch."
"drinkability: overall a decent IPA, not the best but if Im in the local area I will hit it up"
"D: Pretty drinkable. I like this one cold cold. The coldness goes well with the hop (snake dog) bite. Wasn't snake dog a character from Road House or something?"
"light body with plenty of carbonation. i liked the snakedog label though"
"Very drinkable beer, Flying Dog has come through with quite a solid IPA here."
"D - 7% ABV means you can't drink a ton but I personally like the hop flavor here, which is strong enough to be assertive but not so strong to be offensive. Not the most balanced IPA but has been my standby this summer!"
"This is a good IPA in my opinion, and it is very balanced."
"Overall: Surprisingly nice American IPA, with a unique bitter grapefruit taste. Well balanced sweetness and bitterness. Had already several ones and will have it for sure again."
"Drinkbility - Not a bad IPA, but not my favorite either."
"Drinkability: Not a terrible beer by any stretch but there are a lot of IPAs out there that I prefer"
"this review makes it sound not so great, but i really enjoyed this IPA. Seems a hair unbalanced, as it is very very floral, but it isnt overly hopped. not my favorite IPA but ill buy it again"
"Etc. - 7.1% ABV, 60 IBU (on the label)"
"A touch dry, with a moderate-strong ABV of 7% and a moderate, hoppy finish. A bit sour on the back end. Comparable to many other grainy IPAs of its style, with predictable Cascade hops and a moderate complexity."
"poured into a pint glass... nice inch or so of thick creamy head... pours light amber and has a smell of tree sap and citrus... a very good beer, i'm surprised that it's 7.1, because it don't taste that strong... reminds a lot of stone IPA... a good beer i'd recommend."
"Nice rich dark amber color, very transparent. A thick creamy head. Smells like a hopped IPA with a slight wisp of something else that didn't appeal to me. Tastes lake a darker malt almost porter-ish. Over all I'd go with something else if I had the choice."
"D- I think there are many better IPA's out there. I could drink this if I was in a pickle but nothing I'd seek out."
"Really solid atmosphere. Great appearance, solid nose pretty characteristic of the style. Decent flavor. . . again pretty much in lock-step with the style. Although this style is going to be dry, this is profoundly so. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"D: Not the truest IPA. The hops are definitely present, but they're overwhelmed by everything else going on. Not a bad brew, shows a great complexity, but it doesn't necessarily all add up."
"D - As it should be, it's a drinkable beer that's crisp and refreshing especially on a hot summer day. Delicious and the best of the Flying Dog sampler I think."
"Upfront the hops dominate the taste: very piney and grassy--Very prickly in the mouth feel, and leaves the palate nice and wet. This makes for a good thirst quencher even with the moderate ABV level."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- not a bad ipa but i wouldnt buy a sixer of it. This is a nice beer to try and get a feel for if you like IPA's."
"M&D: compared with the Harpoon IPA, the texture/mouthfeel is so much softer and more rounded, the body comes roughly medium, and the alc. hides very well indeed. Overall, between the two this might be the quieter one in terms of flavour and hop profile, but it benefits from a better depth and balance, highly attributable to the bottle-conditioning I think."
"OK so it is not the uber IPA, but it is a great deal compaired to others in the class. As with most Flying Dog products, it has little head with a filtered appearance. What I realy like about this IPA is the flavor and the ABV. If I'm going to spend money for a decent drink, I expect it to fall with in the catagories of it's name. For my money, this is one of the best IPAs on the market when all things are considered."
"Drinkability: Might be better paired with a meal given its overall bitterness; a servicable beer"
"Worth trying."
"My second beer out of the Flying Dog sample pack. I was flipping through the reviews and one thing I really agree with is that it isn't as aggressive as I thought it would be. As usual with an IPA it was hoppy and bitter. The color is a light copper color and poured a great foamy head that laced the whole way down the glass, a clean line for every sip. I liked this beer a lot and am looking forward to sample #3."
"Serving type: bottle into pint glass"
"D: A better than average IPA. Certainly light enough to be a session beer, but with enough character to make it worth drinking. Reasonably priced as well."
"D: Not much going on here... Not amazing.. not horrible.. I took a gamble for .99-"
"Overall, I wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't terrible. Pretty average American IPA."
"There is a semi-sweet, if none too overwhelming, balance of hop that makes for a nice sessional quaff. It is supposed to be an American IPA, but I thought this one to be a somewhat milder version of this style. While, I would not go out of my way to look for it, I'd pick some up if the price were right. Look for the label picturing a deformed dog. Woof!"
"Good East Coast IPA. Borderline DIPA. Tasty, and easy to drink, good balance."
"All in all a good hoppy flavor with not much for a malt back, a refreshing IPA that suffers from lack of balance."
"Drinkability: I could drink a bunch of these in a siting, and would even consider buying this brew again in the future. I really like the under the radar 7.1 ABV."
"Overall theres a very fresh hoppy characteristic to this one.. It looks more like a DIPA than a, um.. single(?) ipa with its deep amber color.. Theres an interesting presence in the taste I couldn't quite put my finger on, a bit sweet and a bit spicy.. A fairly light body, easy drinkability. Overall I feel light theres not a ton to say about it.. its quite good, of course, but is sort of just your standard good IPA.. nothing quite unique about it, definitely good though."
"A solid beer that is quite drinkable. Nice amber color and a fair amount of head. I could smell the hops and got some citrus tones as well. This does not have an overpowering taste like many IPAs but there are nice flavors going on here. It is not too highly carbonated and it paired well with the BBQ."
"D- Good drinkability. I couldn't believe it had 7% ABV because it is undetectable. Not enough hops for the style though."
"D: Like many other Flying Dog offerings, this beer has promise, but is offset by several flaws. In this case, the mouthfeel really holds things back. It could also benefit from a bigger hop presence. Not bad, but there are dozens of better IPAs out there."
"Poured out the bottle into a willi glass, it has a copper/ straw clear appearance with a frothy white head. The nose was spicy and slightly bitter, not very much on the nose compared to many IPAs. The taste is standard grapefruit zest with notes of pine. A bit more of a bitter finish than some. Mouthfeel is about medium bodied. I wouldn't go so far as calling this a good session beer, the bitterness would likely bother me after a couple. All in all, this is a decent IPA at the price point, nothing offensive but nothing extraordinary."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into my trusty beer mug, had some foam on top, faded in a short while. Pretty big pine smell to it, lots of hops, kinda oily taste, but not overbearing. Has a kinda lingering bitterness to it, can be expected with the 60 IBU rating. Have had better IPA's with better overall taste, but is worth trying, however."
"D: Not my favorite IPA; however, it does the job with its 7.10% ABV. One of my more favored beers from Flying Dog."
"4.5 D"
"Conclusion: Nice IPA. Did not stood out of the mass of the other good IPA, but I surely buy it again."
"This beer is good but not exceptional."
"D - I had a lot of hope for this one, so it was a disappointing average unfortunately. Not a bad brew at all though. Just had some identity crisis throughout the experience. I'll have to revisit this later and give it a fair re-evaluation."
"There are far too many better American IPAs out there for me to bother with this one again."
"clear golden red with an extremely well-behaved head - about an inch thick on pouring subsiding very very slowly to a respectable 2mm or so. Promising nose of light toasted malt, subtle spice, and citrus - but does not deliver in the mouth where bitterness takes over and remains dominant in the aftertaste, getting rather medicinal, in fact. Overall a bit disappointing, given the quality of their classic pale ale."
"Overall, not one of the best IPAs out there, but still decent and refreshing. I wouldn't mind trying it again."
"Nice head. Retained a thin level of foam throughout the drink. Right away the way it looks and smells like more of a caramel Ipa. Niceley hopped such a smooth mouthfeel with the bitter hop bite. Some lacing but only a little. This is a nicely flavored sweet Ipa. Its not a incredibly bitter Ipa but a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Nice."
"Drinkability- Wish I had more than the two this variety pack has to offer. Will definitely pick up a six pack, as this is one IPA i could drink all night."
"Vibrant orange/copper with an ample soft head that laced very well. Lychee, citrus notes jumping out of the glass. Nice big hoppiness with a touch of caramel malt in the background. A touch awkward on the palate balance-wise, but big, robust bitterness holds firm. Fruit flavours are there with the caramel malt coming to the fore just a touch. A touch over carbonated for my tastes but that's purely personal preference. Don't get many American IPA's round these parts so I'm more than happy just to have tried this."
"Had this at the bar a while back and I found it to be much better than I ever remember it being. Just the other day I bought a sixer and boy Im glad I did. Very clear gold/amber with a firm head. Good retention and lots of sticky lace. Smells like cannabis, a lot like cannabis, like really, really good cannabis. Very pungent. Checked out the website and its dry hopped with Columbus hops which the only way Ive ever been able to describe their aroma is that they smell like dank weed. Flavour starts out hoppy in that Columbus way. Kind of citrusy but not really, maybe a bit of pine but not quite, really hard to pin these hops down. Sweet crystal malt flavour in the middle, which becomes much more pronounced as the beer warms up, finished off by a well rounded bitterness that doesnt completley scrub away the sweet malt. Perfect medium body and carbonation. I really like this IPA. I dont remember it ever tasting so good. Yes please Ill have another!"
"D- This is a drinkable IPA but not my favorite. While I enjoyed the taste, I would have liked a little more complexity and balance. I bought this in a 6-pack mixer, and while I'm glad I did, there are other IPA's that I'll buy first."
"Very refreshing after a hot day!"
"had this one a few times now so its not as surprising as when i first had it. poured into a tulip. its color is darker than expected but is consistent all the way through. a thin head.a mildly hoppy taste. at first i thought the beer was ultra hoppy but since ive had more ipa's the taste sort of evens out.mouthfeel and drinkability are above average but nothing else. what sets this beer apart is its balance. at 7.1% it has a much better flavor balance than most of the 6% ipa's ive had. considering how available this beer is it is definately a must try. a good one to have as a standard cheap and tasty ipa in your fridge"
"I really enjoyed the Snake Dog. It poured orangey gold with a nice head that produced nice lacing all the way down the glass. Definitely a beer that based on citrus foundations. There is grapefruit in the nose. The mouthfeel is very juicy at first and typically drying at the finish. The taste isn't too bold, but it is flavorful and very enjoyable. It is not the most quaffable beer out there, but it is no less drinkable than the majority of IPA's out there. Great beer, not too expensive."
"Not extreme, balanced, drinkable."
"For the over the top hop head. Ill pass for now."
"Drinkability - Not a session beer, but a solid IPA nonetheless. Still, with all the great domestic IPA's out there, it's hard to justify getting this one on a regular basis."
"The aroma is very hoppy with a very pine like hops and a bit of citrus. The malt is very sweet and caramel like with nuts, bread, and butter in it as well. The appearance is amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall a very nice IPA."
"Beer pours an orangish color to it. The aroma is of hops. The smell is good. The taste is not as bitter or hoppy as some others in this category. The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated but not overly so. This beer is drinkable but not overly so. You could have two or three of them but not many more."
"wow, better then expected. beautiful orange color. nice, but small head. kinda weak aroma, some malt, some hop nice but not especially memorable. nice malt background, carmel sweet but light. hop bitterness is the name of the game. nice rich scrubbing hops. a mix of variatals plays like a symphony. sharp cleaning bitterness is prominant but drinkable, but evident. hop flavor is moderate, aroma is mild. this beer is a scrubber, it can clean your palate with ease. it is surely better with food. at und $2 it is a bargain."
"Now, to be fair, I was a bit disappointed with this beer. This is the first Flying Dog I've had, having heard very good things about the brewery, and it turned out to be, while quite good, a rather run-of-the-mill well-executed IPA. I expected something a little more out there and adventurous, and didn't quite find it. Still, a great IPA."
"A bit of a disappointment from Flying Dog! I've never been in awe of their beers, but never had one this lame. I think it could be consumed OK together with some food, and I'm fine finishing off the six-pack, but not worth getting again."
"The mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected but nice, crisp and smooth. All in all this is a good brew to try. There are better, stronger IPAs but this isn't a bad example of the style by any means."
"Flying Dog's Snake Dog IPA is by no means a bad beer. I may be a little disappointed with respects to a few things but I'm certainly not intending to pour the rest of it out! If there is one redeeming aspect of the beer it is that it is enjoyably, easily drinkable. I'm picky because I've tasted so many better IPAs but if you want to ease yourself in to the style this is a decent place to start."
"Summary - Nothing bad, just unremarkable. Maybe a little added variety in ingredients to provide some complexity and it'll come around."
"D - This is a nicely balanced IPA. I've got others that I prefer more, but I sure wouldn't turn this down if offered."
"Feel and Drinkability: Feel is medium bodied with light carbonation and a drier finish. This is a good beer, but there are many better IPAs out there. Give it a shot, but I'm telling you, for small beers, small IPAs it doesn't get better than Two Hearted. This is one I'd buy again under certain circumstances, and the decision in that situation would be made with some deliberation...its the bubblegum thing...I'm getting it, and its something that I really don't care for....but as I said its not all that noticeable."
"A solid drinkable beer."
"D: Drinkable enough, nothing too special. I'll try this on tap if I see it, just to see if it's any different."
"taste is the strong point of this beer, so take that as you will. only thing i'm not the biggest fan of is the bitterness. i like bitterness, who doesn't, in an ipa atleast. but, thats about all you get with this. there are some floral notes, some hoppy hints, but for the most part its hop bitterness from start to finish. its not a gentle, enjoyable bitterness. its a very obtuse, blunt bitterness."
"Overall - I like this beer, particularly the name and the label - very creative."
"This IPA has a nice, pungent, hoppy taste, as they should. But it does not overpower. You could easily drink a dozen of these! OK, maybe 6 or 8 and then you really should stop."
"A solid American IPA here. The relatively high ABV (7.10%) is muted and well contained. Solid hop presence. Much better overall than I remember this beer being. Nicely done. I've had dozens of other IPAs that don't match up."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Gold with a slight tinge of amber. Off-white head leaves wet lacing. Aroma is kind of faint, with notes of grapefruit and pale malt. Flavor is weak. This would be better categorized as an APA if not for the abv. Modest crackery malt base with a slight caramel character. Watery citrus hoppiness with some astringency and almost negligible bitterness. What the hell was the yeast eating during fermentation to put out 7% alcohol? Thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Bo ring."
"this ipa pours well and looks good its an orange/brown color with a good head/lacing... the smell is mostly malts not much hop/citrus smell.. taste is the same more like an amber beer for me with big malts and biscuity taste than hops/ipa taste, its a solid beer well crafted it just needs more bite.. mouthfeel is average again with too much malt taste its smooth, it is drinkable and not a bad brew but for me it just misses as an IPA.. just not enough... from the snake dog"
"one odd complaint...minor...but the labels on all these FD bottles are really applied poorly...alot of crinkles...peeling off...what's up with that? heck, if you're going to do paper, make it crisp like Dogfish Head. or do the permanent Stone Brewing style of print. with this wonderful Steadman art, you'd think it would be done better..."
"The smell isn't as strong as I'd like for an IPA and neither is the taste, they aren't bad, but aren't strong enough either. Its a good beer, it may be up your alley, not mine. It's weak overall."
"Not the most drinkable beer, but highly enjoyable with lots of flavour. I'd buy it again, but not at Australian prices ($10 a 330mL bottle)."
"Another day, another beer from Flying Dog that has so much potential but falls short. The beer pours great, a good copper color with a thick foamy head and nice lace. Smells like an IPA with a good malt balance, feels good in my mouth and is easily drinkable. So how does it fall short? The taste. Its not bad, but it just isnt right somehow. The malt overbalances on the taste, and there is some hop bite, but it needs more. Especially after reading the label that it would smack me in the face with flavor. It turns out that it just kind of grazes the tongue with a bite, but it never quite clamps down."
"The IPA category is bursting at the seams with offerings; this needs to be better to stand out."
"Dark Golden color pour, with a 2 finger head. Aroma = i can smell alot of hops obviously, citrus, piney, pretty clean smelling. Taste is about what I expected, starts just a little sweet then has a Big hoppy taste, although not tooo bitter, which is perfect for me as im just now starting to come around to more bitter beers. Has a pretty good balance for an IPA i thought, but again im just getting into the style so im not experienced enough yet to make that call for sure. Overall Im liking this beer, and would drink again."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable beer, but would be afraid that I'd really feel the effects after just a few of these. Love the name though."
"Drinkability: Smooth refreshing finish means I could put a few back, but at 7.1% alcohol, this is not a session beer for me. It warms you up nicely with only a bit of alcohol flavor on the finish."
"5.0 - I dig the bottle/label, the availability, the price ($8/sixer), and the taste of this solid IPA. It's just my style. I drink it when I need a hop fix and it's semi ""affordable"" for a craft brew. The FD brews always make me smile."
"Notes: the more styles i drink from flying dog the more i fall in love with this brewery. this is one of the best straight-up, no frills IPAs ive had. its litter-mate, Double Dog, is also one of my favorites with the difference only being a more aromatic, floral and sweeter structure"
"D: I could drink quite a few of these actually, but it just doesn't seem to deliver any kind of punch. The alcohol content is hidden really well for me, so it's drinkable enough. Is it worth buying again? At most I'll give that a ""Maybe""."
"A solid offering from Flying Dog. I for one am happy they are the macro scale innovator of the craft beer industry. I always know that when they are available, I'll have a good beer."
"Overall an excellent IPA. Great first impression from Flying Dog. I look forward to trying the rest of my beer in their sampler pack."
"Out of a bottle this beer had a two-and-a-half finger, large head of bubbly beige foam atop its hazy orange/amber fluid. There was a good amount of rising carbonation, the retention was good and the lacing excellent. The aroma was a pleasant blend of citrus, floral and semi-fruity hops. The flavors were big and rather aggressively hoppy. Mostly pine and some herbal/green hops with hints of citrus and some floral elements that appeared as it warmed up. It need a little more malt to balance it however. The mouthfeel was smooth but oily, the carbonation medium, the body medium. Good but not great."
"D- A fairly easy beer to drink. Quite enjoyable."
"D, notes: I liked this beer as a reliable IPA. Could have used some more malt and more defined hop character."
"Pours a red/amber colored body, clear, with a little white head, lasting. Has a very hoppy aroma, sweet, pale, and dry. Also has a bitter taste, then some sweetness. Has a somewhat dry aftertaste. A pretty good IPA."
"D - At 7.1% it is surprising drinkable, which when all is said and done, may be trouble."
"That said this IPA is good, pretty good, not the best, but way above most other IPAs that I have tried. I would probably get it again? I'm not so sure since I'd probably get a Two Hearted instead."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, now available in Norway at Vinmonopolet. ABV from 2008 is 7.1%. Clear orange colour, moderate white head. Pleasant fruity and sweetish aroma of American hops, distinct notes of citrus and blackcurrant leaves, also moderate notes of malts and toffee. The flavour is distinctly hoppy throughout (as expected from an American IPA), but the hoppiness is not overdone, which means that the bitterness is firm but not harsh. Furthermore, unlike many other IPAs this one is not too sweet, and seems pretty well balanced altogether. Definitely a beer I'll buy again."
"I don't know if I'd buy it again, but who knows. I liked that it was an IPA and I could see that perhaps I (or someone) might want an IPA without the full punch you in the face experience other beers offer."
"D - Drinkable non-citrus IPA. Pretty straightforward brew."
"A very good beer that I would recommend, but with so many American IPA's out there, it can get lost in the shuffle."
"D - Would and will buy again...just light enough for non-craft drinkers too..."
"D - Almost too bitter, but not. Great refreshing ale."
"Overall, a good session IPA, though fairly unremarkable in a relatively cluttered market."
"I will definitely revisit this brew because of its flavours and its drinkability."
"this brew pours up a pretty clear copper color with a very small white head. nice lacing on my cheap glass mug. the nose is big bitterness, slight grapefruit, pale malts. the taste is very bitter, floral and piney hops. medium bodied, low carbo. a decent IPA. This is no Elissa though..."
"D - Easy drinking, maybe too easy."
"Nikki"
"Ok drinkability."
"Initial short blast of sweet caramel malt flavor followed quickly by a moderate hoppy grapefruit bitterness. Mid palate then seems to settle into a distracting thin watery taste before finishing with a very dry, mineral-like hop finish. Just an average American IPA, nothing to great or terrible."
"A nice amber pour,with a light tan two fingered head.Aroma of floral,citrus,and spruce hop notes.A bright flavor very balanced between the hops and sweet malt.Thin watery mouthfeel.Not as thick or hoppy as I like my IPA but this would make a good gateway IPA or a nice Summer day pounder ."
"Picked up a single from Abe's Cold Beer, but I've had this a few times. Really, its not much of an IPA, but it would be a decent pale ale. The flavor and aroma have a bright citrus hop profile, but it's weak by comparison to normal IPA's. It's more on par with Sierra Nevada pale ale, but still not quite as good. Still, very drinkable and it does taste good."
"D- very nice, I could drink this all night.. for many many reasons"
"Pours a deep amber, with a middle head. Good, hoppy scent. Taste is hops balanced with some spice. Clove? Real quality here, not often that you find an IPA balanced with spice over malt. A bit dry, good palate, good aftertaste."
"Pours a light copper color into my pint glass. Leaves a rather thin head then settles down quickly. A little bit of lacing. Smells about right for an IPA...hops, pine, some citrus. No one single dominant scent, which leaves me to believe it will taste balanced. I think this tastes very good. Lots of hoppines up front, but a noticable citrus taste comes through. Grapefruit, I believe. Tastes of pine as well, and a nice bitterness is there. A light to medium body. Leaves a little bit of stick but not a whole lot. It's a very drinkable IPA. BA says this is 5.8% ABV and the bottle says 7.1. So who's right?"
"(rated Aug 5, 2008)"
"a mild ipa, maybe an introduction type beer to the style. mild."
"Taste is hoppy but, as others have already stated, lacks the nice citrus complement. Not a bad brew for hop-heads, but there are much better AIPAs out there. I enjoyed it and would have another sometime, but I gotta rate it against its counterparts, and this one falls a tad short."
"D: Crisp, light bodied and leaves a nice spicy hop tang behind. An excellent everyday ipa you can easily drink during any season and lots of it."
"I finally got past the obnoxious label and bought one of these, and its... okay. Pours light orange with a decent head. Aroma is hoppy, but mostly the bitter Golding variety. Taste seems watered-down. The hops are there, but without the nice resiny-piney-citrus flavors. Average."
"Drinkability: This is an easy drinking IPA, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't even consider this to be a fine example of an IPA. :( Nothing clearly stands out to make in an exceptional beer. I think this could best be described as a beginner IPA. An Introductory India Pale Ale, IIPA. Its not too complex, not overly hoppy, great carbonation."
"Not a bad IPA, some of their beers are actually really good despite their horrible label, but this one i would say is just kinda ok. It pours pretty light for an IPA and smells a lot like non-caramelly malts, not much hoppy goodness at all. In the mouth it's not good but not bad. Eh, so so."
"D: The nice flavors waned as the beer warmed. I'll pass on this in the future."
"There's way too many great IPA's out there casting a shadow on this one."
"Poured a light copper.Nose is herbal hop aromas and sweet malts. Taste is slightly bitter, with lots of malts to balance. Some fruitiness is present as well. Medium mouthfeel, I'm not noticing a lot of carbonation. Good beer but with all of the great IPAs on the market I wont get another."
"D - my first IPA, and was not impressed. maybe i got a bad one becuase others have reviewed this well, but i won't gamble on this one"
"Very impressed with this brew. Never been a flying dog fan for the most part but I thought I would give this one a try. Poured a beautiful clear amber into my pint glass with a nice piney aroma. Just enough head retention with some nice lace action. Nice bite at the beginning followed by some caramel malt character. Well that's enough beer porn for now; Im gonna finish my glass."
"Don't know why this one is rated so low but i think that it is great. Pours a nice clear amber color with a decent off white head. Little to no lacing but the aroma and taste makeup for it. The aroma comes out with a great blend between hops and malt and the taste is like Oh Yeah! Not bitter at all, goes down nice and smooth. My bottle says 7.1% and at that rate i could get tipsy off these bad boys pretty easily. I personally say that this is a must try."
"A really good IPA. One of the best that I have had. The hops are really balanced and it taste really good."
"D-This one's drinkable. Non-remarkable as far as IPAs go, but I'll certainly remember it if I see it around again."
"D: Certainly a good beer, but not the best take on this style in my opinion. I probably won't revisit this, as there are better IPA's to be had."
"D: This is a satisfying brew but fits more in the APA category. As long as you approach it as an APA, I think this beer is quite enjoyable."
"Nice two finger head that recedes to athick foam, atop a light mahagony, amber color. Good bubbling and a splash of sticky on the glass after each sip. Minty orange jumps into the nostrils, but only a little toasted malts. The taste I get some water biscuits first, then with a spread of citrus and pine jelly. Vey astringent palate just cleans all other flavors that might have been lingering, are washed clean with every sip. Just a great session AIPA."
"Nice balance, great water, this was delicious."
"Pretty decent IPA. nothing bad here but nothing amazing either."
"D: Easy to drink. Middle of the road IPA. Good and one that should start a night before getting into anything more flavor dominant. Really darn good taste."
"Verdict: While not earth-shakingly amazing, this is quite a tasty little IPA. While I would be happier with something a little more exciting to accompany the bitterness, those hops still have me salivating for more. As I mentioned, I'm just glad that Flying Dog can produce flavorful beer. It makes me a little more excited about the other styles waiting for review in the fridge."
"This is not an IPA that I will go back to, but its worth a try."
"Not a big fan of the aftertaste. Not a bad beer but I dont plan on buying it again. Unless its in a mix pack."
"A really decent beer that would be much more attractive if it were less expensive."
"Pours a clear burnt orange color with an ok, white head. The aroma is strongly of hops and a little bit of malt. The taste is sharp and piney. Lots of hop flavor. The beer has a medium body and you can't tell it has a 7.1% ABV. Good, but nothing special."
"Overall a decent beer, but nothing I would write home about. The mouthfeel was thin and it really was not all that complex. I think they need to ramp up the hops and malt to just give it more flavor. There are much better IPAs out there to drink, but in a pinch these will do."
"D - This is a great example of a well-made IPA, sans the alcohol I get in the nose. Would drink again and would love to try on tap or even aged a bit longer."
"The nose is filled with hops. The hops are floral, and a bit of sweetness comes through. Pretty good nose. The beer is golden with a cm head. A bit of carbination comes through. Good retention and lacing. It's definitely a good looking IPA. The bitterness is very smooth. The hop bite hits you, but leaves fairly quickly. The floral flavours of the bee come out a lot to help; however, the beer is really thin. The malts do not come through at all, which is pretty annoying. It's pretty much like hops and water. The beer is drinkable, but a bit too carbonated."
"This one was just a bit funky for me. Besides the terrible Tire Bite, the rest of the mixed pack was pretty good.. except this one. I mean I like IPA's and all but this one had something odd going on with it and the taste didn't sit well with me. Maybe a little out of balance? Either way I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Nice session beer. Tasty enough to bring me back again. Nicely priced at $6.99 a sixer as well."
"O: Wonderful beer, very much worth the money, and if anyone tells you otherwise, punch them in the head."
"Enjoyed on tap at Buckeye Brew Engine. C-hop aroma. Yellow with a thick white head and thick lace. Astringent bitterness but drinkable with the offsetting malts that kick in. 60 IBU, Crystal Malt, Warrior and Columbus hops, and dry hopped with Columbus.Interesting IPA and worth a try."
"Nice medium body with bitter, herbal, resinous hops on the tongue, balanced by a nice underbody of caramel malt and subtle hints of apple. Beautifully well-balanced with a slightly bitter, slightly sweet, semi-dry finish that begs for more. And, despite the 7.1% ABV, I could definitely go for some more."
"D - I like my IPAs to be hoppier but I have nothing bad to say about this beer. It's got good balance and sufficient complexity."
"Color is a deep orange with minimal head. Smells of citrus, tastes of bitter citrus, mainly orange and pineapple with some grapefruit thrown in. A bit different than most IPAs, but a solid entry in the style. The alcohol is not all that prominent in the flavor, but you feel it. Solid!"
"Drinkability is good. The best IPA I've had yet and at the very least, a great choice for a 6'er."
"NOTE: I'm editing my review because I realized I'm the highest reviewer of this beer out of 500+ reviews. If you sort by date, you'll notice the higher reviews are more recent, while the lower ones are 4-5 years ago. Maybe they've changed the recipe or process? I still think this is one of the better IPA's I've had. Very close to my fav of Great divide's Titan IPA."
"I am currently enjoying my first flying dog ipa as i write this review. I am very impress by this beer. This is without a doubt one of the top three ipa brews that i have tasted this year. The smell is excellent, the appearance is great, and the taste is exceptional. I certainly recommend this brew to anyone who wants to experience an exceptional IPA."
"D - This is a solid IPA that's well-balanced and sessionable. Certainly not at the top of the heap when it comes to IPAs, but I'd definitely have this one again in the future. Great label artwork as well."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose. Flavor is balanced then goes to grapefruit with the expected lingering bitter finish of an IPA. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"In a world of so many great American IPAs, this is difficult to recommend. It's not terrible, but more than anything else it's just boring."
"Pours a clear copper color with a thin head. Aroma is of some sweet fruits, hops and a malty almost grassy lager like scent. The flavor has that nice bitter grapefruit hoppy flavor but it doesn't bite hard, rather it's gradual and easy going. It finishes bitter and somewhat dry. I can see this as a good entry level IPA. Nothing special but it's still pretty good and I'd have it again."
"D: very easy to drink for the style. refreshing and tasty."
"A nice IPA but not a favorite."
"Drinkability is great, this one went down fast and I wish I had another to follow up. Great beer. Great example of the American IPA style."
"Overall, a good but not great beer. Worth trying but don't knock yourself out getting it."
"Flavor is very smooth. Flowery hops, creamy malt. Bitterness lingers, though not overly intense."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA, which is very balanced and not to hoppy, with an aftertaste that is not over powering. Without the bottle saying so I would have never guessed this beer is 7.1% alc/vol. A little deceptive in that regard, but this beer is a well balanced IPA, that I enjoyed and would absolutely drink again."
"Overall, a good drinker, and I could see this as a good one to have if I wanted 3 or 4. I would like a bit more of a ""bite"" though. I do like this brewery quite a bit, and I guess I'll have to review their Double Dog, and see if that gives me what I need."
"D- there is nothing wrong with this one, its just nothing special really. there are several more interesting ones that are equally available to me. mediocre at best."
"D. A very nice beer. It goes down smooth. It's taste masks the alcohol content too you might not realize it's a 7.1% so be careful not to drink too quickly."
"Definitely recommended as a cheap IPA."
"What this beer lacks in style it make up for in drinkability. The flavors are agreeable and the medium body makes this a pleasure to drink. Not a big beer but one you can drink a few times without obliterating your taste buds with flavor, spice or bitterness."
"Disappointingly weak hops make a disappointingly weak IPA. The malt and hops, ironically, are in great balance: they're both sorry. Far too light for style, in terms of ingredients and mouthfeel. Not impressed."
"D: This is the biggest selling point. One of the most drinkable IPAs that I have had in a long time."
"D= very drinkable if you're a floral-hops fanatic."
"The kings of mediocrity are back with the Snake Dog. Please leave your ""flavor of the week"" pet at home. An amber color with a pretty good head but no carbonated body sits in front of me. Smells like pine cones and bleach, I am afraid to try this. It's not poison but it might as well be. I think someone put listerine packs in my brew. This beer is the brewery just stabbing in the dark when it comes to an IPA, no consideration on balance at all. Hops out the ass and that is some bitter shit with no complexity throughout. Lack of ingenuity, character, and thought. Might as well just put hops in water and see what happens. Bitter in a bad way, cool artwork can only go so far."
"Dark orange/gold with a moderate white head with big bubble circles. It really sticks to the side of the glass as I drink it down. It has the hopped-up pine tree aroma associated with I.P.A.s along with a little citrus in there. The flavor contains a pleasant bitterness and citrus hint. This I.P.A. doesn't have a ""sour dish rag"" stink to it that I've picked up on in other I.P.A.s. This is a good one. Good fizz and a pleasure to drink. But this is the second Flying Dog Ale that I've reviewed that had a different ALC/VOL content on the label than what the site says. My bottle says 7.1%. Nevertheless, This is good beer."
"D: Clean flavor and hops that aren't overdone makes for a really drinkable IPA."
"This is a pretty decent IPA, on the balanced side so could be sesssioned. These are usually reasonably priced so I probably will pick this up again."
"D- Clean flavor and hops that aren't overdone makes for a good drinker. What I thought was a slightly higher ABV stops you from drinking too many in a single sitting. It could pair well with spicy/greasy food."
"Pours a clean copper/ orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, big grapefruity citrus hops. In the taste, sticky-sweet grapefruity hops. A hoppy/ bitter and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a grapefruity hop sweet to dry aftertaste. Big hops, lighter body, good beer, and easy to drink."
"Overall a decent IPA , but theirs better to be had."
"Yum! Poured a dark, semi-hazy copper with a little head that dissipated within minutes. Smelled hoppy and sweet and tasted the same. A strong but not too bitter hop on the palate and finishes hoppy but barely bitter, leaving the hop taste behind to savor. Medium-bodied and very drinkable. Nothing too distict, but a well-done IPA nonetheless. Try it!"
"d: a decent beer but a little weird for the style since the hops play a very subdued role; i would have it again but maybe with a relabel"
"D: Not for me. Wish I could chalk it up to a bad bottle but I have had several of these out of my optimistic nature, and each has failed me."
"Dark golden yellow in color with orange tints. Big long lasting white head after an agressive poor. Smellis understated for an IPA still citus/grapefruit are there but take a backseat to the smell of straw and something strange like the sticky side of tape smell. Taste is manly sweet straw like malt flavor with some bitterness on the hop end that doesnt really make it all the way out and again this strange flavor that I smelled is also on the back end which is unpleasant. Light feel for an IPA but did have some stickyness to it and really rather average drinkability. Overall not enough hops for an IPA and also something strange going on in the finish."
"This pours an appetizing dark brownish amber with an off-white head. Aroma is seriously hoppy and has strong hint of evergreen, promising a very hoppy beer. Flavor is as fiercely hoppy as the aroma and even has an evergreen component. Bitterness is mild. Texture is very lively and zingy. Recommended to all hop fanatics."
"Taste was pretty good hop taste, ending with a earthy floral flavor, then finished with a lasting bitterness. Bitter but not to strong for an IPA."
"D: very nice session IPA. another good brew from Flying Dog."
"This poured amber with a nice head that slowly went away. It smelled of hops and a touch of citrus/grapefruit, not much else going on. I tasted how I expected it to taste, with the dominating grapefruit/citrus from the hops overpowering everything else. This was a pretty good IPA, however it is very bitter. I will have to say that this was probably my favorite out their mix pack."
"Caramel punctured by grapefruity notes with strong, solid bitterness greets the tastebuds, softened by mellow toasty notes. For me, the beer is much more drinkable when accompanied by an appropriate snack, else the bitterness builds to a point I can taste little else."
"D - I am a bit disappointed with this beer. There seems to be very little malt flavor to balance the hops. It's okay, but not my favorite Flying Dog brand."
"Still, this is a pretty good AIPA--not top of the line, but not one to refuse. It could and should be bolder, and I'd certainly prefer a stronger allotment of hops in this. However, it's a solid version, and worth a go. Recommended in my book."
"D: Very drinkable for IPA, could definitely drink a few in a sitting. I will definitely be having again."
"This brew poured a rusty amber color with a god size white head of suds, and fair lacing followed. The aroma was not strong or complex but it suggested a decent blend of citrus and malt. The taste was also not very intense, a midland mouthfeel, maybe even on the aqueous side, sort of a peppery sweet citrus with a bready malt accompaniment. Very decent, very drinkable, very nicely carbonated, delivering the necessary quota of citrus hops. But this was not one I would go searching for, just a solid standby for the IPA lover."
"Overall impression: A bitter, hop forward IPA. A touch unbalanced as there is very minimal malt to balance all the hops but it is dry and light enough to be quaffable. Perfect for summer sipping."
"After enjoying Doggie Style classic pale ale pretty well I was hoping this would step up into the A range. I was somewhat let down as it did not live up to my expectations. Still a decent IPA and, as always, sweet labels make it worth the purchase."
"Nice copper color with a big head from a bit of a rough pour which resulted in a big pillow of foam with different density in some spots but it all died down quicker than expected to a small sheen on the top of the beer. Nose is pretty much expected, some citrus but also some floral notes along with some odd sour vegetal qualites that I can't put my finger on. There is no freshness date on the bottle and this left me wondering a bit although it didn't seem to come through in the taste. Pretty standard malt middle but the hops are a bit mixed, I can't quite decide where they are going with the hop bill and I'm still not sure if that is good or bad or somewhere in between. At times I almost think there are very light hints of noble or english but they seem to get smacked around with the typical american notes repeatedly after the fact. The finish has a what starts as a clean dryer bitterness but transitions to an odd lingering confusion of hops, slight esters?, and that vegetal taste that I had earlier determined hadn't shown up which in fact has in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but the beer is more drinkable than other 7% ale out there."
"D - It doesn't have a bad taste; the finish is fairly clean. The body isn't too filling. The abv is a little on the high side. All in all, I think it's a pretty drinkable ale. Just wish it had more hops."
"Wow, a really good IPA. Had this one from the sampler as well. Great, dark amber appearance with a patchy, somewhat creamy lacing. The aromas were pungently strong with great spice, hops, alcohol and some woody flavoring. The taste is those smells actualized awesomely with a warm, bitter texture that is not too strong or weak. Just right. The mouthfeel helps the flavors a bit, but I felt it was a bit too lacking in body and crispness. A little crisper would not have hurt. Overall, some really great dimensions to this IPA."
"Bronze in color. Strong hoppy smell with some slight fruit notes. Sharp bite and alot of hops with high carbonation. Tangy on the palate with a long bitter finish maybe a little too bitter. Not that impressed considering what part of the country it comes from."
"D: Decent. It's nothing special for an IPA, so I can't go higher here. It's still rather easy to drink. More flavor would definitely make this one a quaffable IPA."
"That said I liked the beer. It was an easy going IPA that was very pleasant. A good session beer, I went back for a second."
"Drinkability - If you like IPA's you will enjoy this beer, I am undecided on this beer as of right now. I probably will buy a sixer to find out."
"D-With all the IPA's out there i love i could not see me reaching for this one on a very often basis i'd probably go for their APA even over their IPA."
"D: On our groups tab there were 15 of these on there. Nuff said."
"D - No more of these, please. It starts out pleasant enough but the lack of complexity on top of a pretty rough bitterness makes t his brew tricky."
"1 1/4"" off-white head falls quickly to a cap. Thin lacing. Copper penny color with good clarity.Pine tree, grapefruit and late orange blossom mix with sweet creamy malt. HInt of caramel. Pine and herbal hops from start to finish in flavor. Smooth vanilla and creamy malt. Lingering bitterness. Light bodied IPA, medium carbonation with prickly bitterness on the tongue. The lightness of this IPA makes it sessionable ... pretty good drinkability."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, but there are better IPAs out there. It goes down easy, but it isn't exactly the most complex beer of its style. Still, a decent brew."
"Aroma is gentle, grapefruit hops over sweet malt and a hint of grain. Has a bit off a medicinal off note though, that carries through to the taste of the beer. Hops over top of malt, follwed by some bitterness, and then some weird thing that ruins the moment. I enjoy IPA's and this one is right in there until the odd smell/taste creeps in. Drinks okay, but finishes poorly. Look for a better IPA."
"ok, first off here it says it's 5.8% but on the bottle i have it says 7.1% pours a pretty deep amber with a nice frothy head. very nice looking. smells of sweet malt and very hoppy, i detect some cascade hops in there. very yummy. decent lacing. taste is smooth malt with a very nice hop balance, the hops are not too much it's a nice balance. yet a nice bittering after bite. I like this IPA, it's funny too because from the look of the bottle i was thinking it was going to be some macro version of an IPA, but it's quite good. I will buy this again, and recommend it to people. thanks Flying Dog much respect."
"An afterthought...this is an earthy IPA. It's not super hoppy. This sucker has some floaties in there, but still not a huge beer."
"D: I always find detectable levels of alcohol on the palate slightly annoying and the closer to the bottom I got, the more pronounced it was. Loved the hops! Great malts! Could use less of the phenolic taste."
"This brew was put together very well but it isn't one I would go out of my way to get. Have to try at least one though."
"Crisp mouthfeel. Sharp, bitterness in the aftertaste that lingers entirely too long. For that reason, I have to put Snake Dog's drinkability on a short leash."
"T + M + D: An herbal hop oil flavour, a decent bitterness, a bit of malty balance which seems a little strange, but not a bad thing. Some mild carbonation that could be a bit more lively. Medium body, and ultimately a decent enough drink. I'd have it over plenty of others, but would have an equal number of others rather than it."
"Pours a bright copper with dense two finger head. Nice retention and clumpy lacing. Smell: sweet, piney, citric hops. Taste: hops are piney, grapefruit. Fairly balanced with biscuity, sweet malt and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel: full bodied, syrupy, like an AIPA should be. This is a lot better than I remember. Not a hop bomb, but a nice dose of hops and enough malt to keep it from being one sided."
"D - This is actually pretty good. Not a very hoppy IPA but maybe I got an old bottle. I will have this again."
"Taste was a hop explosion, but very little in the malt department. I like em a little more balanced, but this was a very drinkable beer."
"This was a pretty good IPA. Had the ""hop stink"" on the nose. It poured an amber/burnt orange color. Bunch of hops in the front with that oily mouth feel and a smooth finish. Hop bite was good but alacohol content was a bit low. Not a bad brew but a tad watered down taste."
"Definately easy to drink and tastes like a quality beer should."
"Taste is sweet caramel malt with citric hop notes. A pretty standard, but high quality IPA. Bitterness is not crazy, just at the right level. Again there are the Chico ale characteristics that are really distinct. Great beer, but overruled by magnificent other IPAs."
"I like the bitter beers, but I didn't like this one as much as Flying Dog's Classic Pale Ale. It has plenty of hops, and it was very bitter, but it was just too one-dimensional for me. I want a more balanced flavor with some character to it. No malt was detectable, and the mouthfeel was too generic."
"Other comments: A good, chewy, crisp IPA. A bit annoyed though because I noticed the bottle was a short fill. Jipped by an ounce!"
"Snake Dog pours a clear amber color with a big off-white head. The aroma is of caramel malt, grape and is floral. The taste is of caramel malt, grape, pine and a bit sweet, although well balanced. Medium body with a sweet dry hoppy finish. Not a bad IPA at all."
"HV"
"I think this is a drinkable American ale but it is a bit weak for an IPA and could fit into an amber or pale ale. Still a solid beer though."
"I liked it."
"D- This is an easy drinker. Not the most complex or interesting brew but nothing too offensive about it. I'd drink another."
"Worth a try..."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, golden-amber color with a dense, pillowy head. The smell is all American hops; grapefruit, orange and pine come to mind - nice. The taste is an excellent bouquet of formerly said hops, citrusy with a good malt base that balances the beer. Not a hop bomb by any means, but a great tasting AIPA. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy carbonation. A very drinkable beer, this is one of my new favorite Flying Dog brews!"
"Good drinking. Smooth and mouthwatering. I have often avoided flying dog, just because i see it all the time, both on east and west coast. But now I will seriously consider this IPA against Stone, DFH, and other favorites."
"D: Uh I like the nose on this one, the hops are a bit too intense or at least I don't like the style of hops used here, just a bit to medicinal for my tastes, not as juicy or piny or nutty as I was expecting and hoping for."
"I would buy again and try their other offerings."
"Poured semi aggressive to get a decent head into a Bush Noel glass. Transparent and litely carbonated light amber color with a full head that hit the top of the glass. Head recedes pretty quick to a lite ring around the top of the brew. Excellent piney hops in the smell, smells like an IPA. Maybe cascade? might be a bad idea here, but followed this with a DFH 120 so even after cleaning the palette the following is what I'm getting. Hops hitting me heavy after a waff of carbonation rolls off my tongue, bitterness hits after that. Love smelling this between drinks, smells a little bitter after time, but I'm digging it. Getting some light wood flavors, harsh citrus notes, and bitters flaring on the sides of my tongue, but I almost think the carbonation is too strong. Defiantly getting a bitter aftertaste from the hops here. Overall I think the carbonation is too heavy after getting through it, might be because my tongue is dead from the 120, but I don't have another in the fridge to compare later. Maybe I'll edit the review on a clean palette later. Not a bad IPA by any means."
"D- Great Drinkability, light and smooth, also tasty."
"Overall- A watery IPA, easy to drink and subdued. Not bad, just needs a hop infusion."
" Snake Dog IPA is the on the bitter-end of the brewery's core lineup of beer. As would be expected from an American IPA the hops are at the forefront of the beer, but Snake Dog offers quite a bit of sweet-malt and the hops end up being downright bashful in comparison to other IPA's on the shelves. The beer pours a lovely bright amber-orange and has a nice aroma of American citrusy hops with hits of stone fruit, or apricot. The beer is a thick full bodied drinker with a malt balance twinged with caramel sweetness more typical of an English beer than an American. The finish is big and full with a lingering sweetness that is pleasing to the palate. I like snake dog because it bucks the trend of thin-body hop bombs that are in vogue with American brewers. In the hands of an iconoclast, even the standard IPA can take a different direction."
"Rich honey orange pour with lasting offwhite head. Smell is sweet grassy, soapy hops, bordering on some spices. More pale ale like, I thought, than an IPA, but with notes of clove, some hops and sweetness. Not one of my favorite IPAs by far, but drinkable. Wouldn't really recommend."
"I will have to try this one again. It seems that everything that I like in an IPA is there, but this one didn't seem to come together for me. The individual flavors never blended for that IPA complexity that I've come to like."
"The aroma is of orange peel and hops. The taste is thin bodied with a maltiness in the front and raw hop bitterness on the back end. Not a bad IPA I am just used to one with more character and a better hop presence."
"Poured a bright orange color with plenty of white head resting on top. Slight amount of lacinig stays for the session. Aroma is sweet with plenty of citrus. A lot of delicious grapefruit is heavily pronounced in the nose. Not too overpowering malty sweetness, but the taste remains very sweet with a slight citrus ending. Very watery mouth feel, but still very tasty."
"Brown and copper in color. No head, but plenty of good lacing. Smell is hops, mostly piney and ""cleaner"" in smell. Taste is bitter hops with some decent basic malts helping out. A beer that you would expect on draft at a sports pub. Where the focus isn't on the beer, but it's along for the ride. Eh."
"a (maybe slightly-better-than-) average american IPA"
"Pours a clear golden with a thin off-white head. Smells of citrus and pine. Taste is hoppy, doesnt have quite the same hop taste as most IPA's, but still good. Also a bit of biscuity malt, with a earthy taste as well. There is also a tiny hint of chalkyness. The mouthfeel is average, and the carbonation is a tiny bit rough, but nothing too bad. Pretty drinkable, I could drink a few of these. Not my favorite Flying Dog Ale, but a decent beer that I would drink again."
"Overall: A nice solid IPA, good balance to it. Starting to really like this brewer."
"Drinkability - I will definitely plan on drinking these again in the future. The only thing that kept it from being 4.5-5's was the somewhat bitter finish on the back of the pallet. A great session brew, in my opinion."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced and very drinkable. i was picking up sixers of this one all summer whenever i was in detroit. wish it was available locally and i'd be drinking it all the time. a solid american ipa."
"D: there is no way i could drink even a whole bottle of it. For some reason it does not work for me. I like most everything from flying dog, but this is my least favorite of the sampler"
"Drinkability: This is easy to drink and also enjoyable. Again, it isn't the most extreme IBU IPA, but it is tasty and enjoyable."
"Drinkabiity was smooth, nothing that I would consider a chore to drink. Overall I would consider it average."
"D - Great IPA. I love this one."
"What a treat it is. The beer shines a light copper color in the glass with a head that lasts all the way down. There's a good amount of hop bitterness in this brew, although the overall brew is a little lighter than others. I'm going against the BA opinion by granting it a higher score, but I enjoyed it."
"it's a very good overall IPA."
"Overall, this is a better IPA compared to others I've had. I'm learning to appreciate the style so bear that in mind but offerings like this give me faith that this is a style I can like a lot."
"Overall- Different aspects of an IPA than what I like. I like a more dry taste and finish where this one is sweet and sugary. This is a nice beer though, and I liked it, but is not my favorite."
"Nice amber red body topped with a nice frothy white head. Nice citrus hop aroma with some detectable malt. Good citrus and malty aroma. Good sweetness. Ends with a lasting bitterness but there isn't much initially. Pretty tame beer for Flying Dog really. Good body and good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Very tame, but very drinkable IPA."
"Pours a clear orange/gold. Good head that falls fast and leaves a lot of lace. Nose is sweet with a pine tone. Hello hops. Taste is robust from the hops and has a citric edge to it. Flavor stays with you and doesnt leave your tongue. Feel is carbonated and thick with a slight syrupy edge. Very drinkable if you dont mind the large hop presence."
"D: This is an IPA on training wheels, as it would be good to have a Big 3 drinker try to experience what a big beer might be without blowing their tongue off with a BIG IPA. Could drink a few of these but would soon be looking for a bigger beer. This is a session beer, just not one that completely satisfies."
"I liked this."
"Crystal clear out of the bottle and a pleasant orange colour, a coarse, off-white head formed after the pour and produced some sticky, clumpy lacing. Good head retention. The aroma was of grapefruit pith, pine needles, and perfumy floral notes with some sugary malt in the background. Solid bitterness with juicy grapefruit and a flash of caramel sweetness towards the start. Some pine as well, with a lingering bitter and dry grapefruit flavour. Medium/light bodied with average carbonation. Decent texture, with light warmth and it was quite dry. Definitely balanced towards bitterness - not bad, but could use a bit more of a malty backbone."
"D - A decent beer. The hops certainly take centre stage."
"12 oz brown bottle part of a mixed 12 pack. Pours an light amber orange color with a medium head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is all about the hops, citrusy and piney. Taste is very bitter with a slight alcohol presence. Reminded me of its big brother Double Dog, just a littler tamer."
"Low carbonation, with a great refreshing mouthfeel. This IPA is easy to drink, and is so much easier to drink then say, Titan IPA. So far, the best beer I have had from the recent micro induction, for the sole purpose of what would appeal to a wider audience in Australia."
"It's a brownish orange with a nice, frothy head that disentegrates and leaves some lacing. It smells sweet--honey being the dominant form of sweetness--and hoppy, but balanced. I don't care too much for the IPA style, but this is a very well-done beer. The hops are damn good and (again), properly balanced. Very sweet, but rounded with grassiness. Highly carbonated (*belch*)."
"Overall, not Flying Dog's best offering, but a good beer nonetheless"
"A basic session beer. Looks good, an orangy amber color, with a big, soft, pillowy slightly off-white head. A very little resiny hops aroma. Taste alternated between sweet, bready malt and mild, oily hoppiness. Not bad but not memorable either. Mouthfeel is decidedly thin. Drinkability is good. This one goes down easy, but there is not enough here to satisfy an IPA lover."
"Part of sampler pack on Thanksgiving, paired with meal. Pours a nice clear copper color with thick two finger rocky head. Good retention and lacing as well. Smell is strong of hops and thats about all I could notice, a pretty good aroma to it, smelled very fresh. Taste was good but something seemed a little off. Strong hoppy presence and I didnt notice much in the way of malts. A somewhat dry, bitter aftertaste left behind and a slightly oily feel to it. Moderate carbonation seemed right on. Overall a good, beer, not a stand out but not a bad choice."
"D: Kinda disappointed. The flavor is OK, but not nearly as bitter as I like out of an IPA. Not even close to Stone or Bridgeport. It is a very easy to drink beer, and for parties or IPA newbies, not a bad choice."
"IPA colored with a very generous head. Nothing about this beer is extraordinary, but it's very well done. Nose is very suggestive of hops, and that's really about all. Taste strikes an ispiring balance between malt & hop flavors for an IPA that weighs in at under 6%. A very fine American IPA that I would not hesitate to buy again when I want a break from Stone, who has set the benchmark."
"Final thoughts  Awesome! An excellent, well crafted IPA. Smooth clean and refreshing."
"Overall, not the greatest American IPA I've had, but certainly not the worst. Newcomers to the style would be wise to check it out' not too intense and well-balanced enough for all to enjoy."
"D: A little bit odd taste & mf for the style, but still pretty good and very drinkable."
"This beer is a nice, deep amber color. A nice, frothy head leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The smell was like sticking my nose in a grapefruit. Tasted some slight citrussy sweetness at the tip of the tongue with hoppy bitterness in the middle and at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. A pretty decent IPA."
"D - I'll go through a sixer without a problem. Very accessible IPA. Flying Dog didn't get where they are today by putting out bad brews. This is an easily sessional brew, I'd recommend it especially to those looking for an introduction to the style."
"Clean, clear, bronze-orange body with lighter edges and a little finger of gauzy, off-white head. Bready malt and fruit malt infused with piny, resinous, and scotch-tape hop funk. Toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness flavors up front. Piny hops follow, with scorched caramel and fruit malts. Citrus and scotch-tape hop bitterness in the finish with some lingering soapy, sugary malt. Medium-bodied with a slightly oily feel and a soapy finish. Not bad, but not too memorable in the big world of American IPAs."
"D_this seems like a good mix of a sierra like ipa and an English one. This a good but not great choice. One I would gladly entertain again"
"D - I'm just starting to come around on IPAs so I could have a couple of these like two maybe three"
"Medium-bodied and creamy on the mouth. A very nice example of an American IPA. Drinkability is good because of the nice balance. I will have to pick up a 6 pack of this next time."
"Light body, light carbonation, very thirst-quenching. A little bit dry in the aftertaste. I think this would be a nice fall evening beer. I should have taken mine outside. It seems perfect for a cool, autumn night with friends - not really that great for a night inside writing beer reviews..."
"I picked up a mixed twelve pack of Flying Dog on Friday night. I'm usually not a big fan of IPA's but when it comes in the box it must be drunk! The beer poured a copper color with a nice foamy head. The smell was pine, flowers, and citrus. The taste is pine and citrus with a bitter aftertaste. The hops really come through. Could definitely drink a few of these. As I said earlier, IPA's usually don't do it for me but this one wasn't too bad."
"D - Pretty good IPA. The hop character is excellent but I am not too pleased with finish. It gets kind of harsh and soapy and leaves a lingering, astringent bitterness."
"This is a very nice sessionable IPA. More malt and less hoppy than some but still one to enjoy when you can."
"Overall it's a pretty interesting IPA it makes you think a bit, it's kinda all over the place. One is enough in a sitting but it's worth a try."
"Orange in appearance with a big head, flowery smell which is hoppy and alcoholic. Taste is smooth if lighter than I thought it would be , mouthfeel is very good, this is definitely a very drinkable IPA with food. Not too alcoholic so drinkability is high. Overall I would say it's a great session IPA but something is off for me just a little bit, I think the kick of hops is light and the alcohol (even though there isn't much) isn't too masked. Definitely a fine IPA though."
"D: It's a tasy enough brew and drink easily. Very sessionable. It's priced the same as 2 Hearted so I don't see myself getting any more of this. If it was priced like the cheap JW Dundee's I'd make this my everyday IPA and save the 2 Hearted(and some bucks) for better occasions."
"Amber-copper, crystal clear beer with two fingers of big bubbled head. Leaves fairly solid lacing. Strong fruity hops in the nose, although fairly mild, almost pale ale levels. Sort of odd beer, almost rough, roasted bitterness. Drying hops - very drying. A little spicy. Medium body with good carbonation. A good one, although not great. I liked the FD Pale Ale more. I maintain the best thing about Flying Dog beers is the label."
"Taste is too much on the hoppy side. It is overly floral, with weak malt and a very distinct, unpleasant syrupy taste. Overly hopped and overly sweet. Okay carbonation, but this a very unbalanced taste for an IPA. It taste too hoppy and almost...creamy...at times. It took me almost three weeks to go through a six pack of this."
"Pours a clear amber color, small head, but leaves some nice lacing. The smell is rather hoppy and unbalanced, not that thiers anything wrong with that. The taste starts with a bit of malts and then goes mostly hoppy finishing bitter and clean. A good mouthfeel, and average drinability for the style. Better then the tire bite i just had. About average for the style"
"Probably would not have this one again"
"This brew pours a clear pale bronze color. The head is large, creamy, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of citruc with a hint of grass, but is rather faint. The taste is very grassy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this IPA does not agree with me. It lacks any sort of complexity, and is annoyingly grassy."
"Dark orange in color with a bit haze. Thick light tan head. Plenty of lace sticking to the glass. Herbal and citrus hop odors present. Sharp citrus hop flavor up front. Then a bitter tingle near the front of tongue. Unfortunately ends with an unpleasant medicanal, herbal hop taste at the end which lingers for a while. Brew was nicely carbonated and I could probably down a few despite the lingering aftertaste."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- I drank this bottle at a friends, but may have to go buy a sixer of it as I really liked this IPA."
"This beer is a bit of a surprise. It is a amber orange with a decent head, retention, and some lacing. The smell is lemon grass, hops, some sweet malts. This beer is quite bold. It is ever so slightly less than medium bodied and plenty carbonated. You get a blast of these very strong grassy malts and oily esters, then bitter hops kick in, and then some hoppy aftertaste that tends to linger too long. I don't know if this is what was necessarily intended by the brewhouse, but it does make for an interesting beer that is quite drinkable and enjoyable. L'Chaim."
"D: For an IPA, even on a hot day hanging by the pool, thsi one is pretty drinkable. Not too alcoholic so you will not warm up too much and not too hoppy for an IPA (if that's a conundurm, I apologize, but it's the best I can describe it). It's smooth taste makes it an easy drinking brew."
"D: The way the beer thins as it warms discourages me from cracking open a second one."
"I really liked this one. Golden head that dissipated fairly quickly and citrusy aroma. Very bitter on the palate, but very well-balanced. Taste is hoppy and floral. Very smooth with clean finish. If you like this style of beer, you wont be disappointed."
"Very drinkable for an IPA because of the relatively low ABV compared to most IPA's"
"Just not what I have learned to expect from an IPA. More of a pale ale in my opinion. Good hoppiness to start, but felt watery on the back end. There did not seem to be a significant malt background to balance this beer. It just kind of bottomed out. Could be a decent session beer if you don't want to take on some of the higher gravity IPA's. But what you sacrifice in alcohol content is also sacrificed in depth of character. As many beer advocates may know, this is not a general rule, just an unfortunate consequence of this particular recipe."
"I would consider this a very good IPA. Actually the first Flying Dog beer that I can honestly say that I would definatly buy again. Just the right amount of hoppy taste for an IPA."
"This Flying Dog offering pours a extremely clear amber, not IPA like at all. A mediocre head bubbles quickly away. Very little lacing. Smell has floral hops with balanced malt hues countering. Honey sweetness. Not nearly enough definitive hops, the malt almost overwhelms the hop. Bready. I found the mouthfeel to be thick, and not nearly astringent enough. Despite its flaws it is a tasty brew, more of a pale ale, it's still drinkable."
"D- It is decent. I don't mind this one to much and might buy a 6-pack of it one day for a session beer."
"Drinkability: Good IPA but nothing outstanding. I would pick up for another hot summer day."
"D-I really enjoyed this purchase and for the price I think it is a great IPA but like all hop-heavy beers they tend to annhialate the tastebuds so drinking more than one or two in a sitting is a bit much."
"12 oz. bottle from sampler...pours a gentle opaque copper-orange with a near-perfect head, slow in dissipation...hints of pine fight with an overpowering hops aroma...crunchy (?), sharp warmth on the tongue--but services the whole tongue, thus balancing on an IPA tightrope...warm aftertaste; hops in effect, but more yielding than the aroma would indicate (unlike the alcohol?)...a serviceable IPA--reflects their pale ale in its balance..."
" Overall I really liked this and was very glad it was as good as I had hoped. Another classic brew from Flying Dog. I cannot wait to dry the Double IPA, as this was fantastic. A classic sessioner for me that will find its way into regular rotation."
"Overall - A good simple bog standard IPA... nothing groundbreaking but certainly worth a try..."
"I remember enjoying this on tap once, but I wouldn't buy this again. After checking the bottle, the stamp says 19807FX. Not entirely sure, but I'm guessing August 19, 2007? If so freshness shouldn't be an issue. Just not a great beer."
"The aroma of this beer is pretty impressive however the rest is a little disappointing. A solid beer none the less. Beer review #600... woo hoo"
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a very nice, easy drinking IPA. Very balanced."
"I really enjoy the easy drinking take on the style but with lots of character."
"This IPA pours a nice golden-copper with brilliant clarity. A moderately thick white head coated the top, kept a skim the whole way down with nice lacing. The aroma is moderate-high citrus, floral hoppiness with a little pine also evident. The flavor is moderate-high hop flavor, much like the aroma smells, hop bitterness is also medium-high. The malt presence provides a nice balance with a bit of malt sweetness and little graininess. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and finish a nice, leaves just enough hop flavor on the tongue without being too much. Overall a very tasty and good looking IPA, Ill buy it again."
"Needless to say the head was--literally--over-the top. It did settle down, but stayed thick even after several minutes. Color was a cloudy yellow with a a brownish tinge. Smell was hop large with the malts way, way down.T: butterscotch and piney hops. Mouth feel was a bit lively--all the extra carbonation, but it was also creamy. If other bottles were less carbonated, I might push the drinkability up a bit. As is, it was average; better than some, not as good as others."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a clear deep gold, forming a very thin head, with light spots of lace. The aroma is intense hops! The flavor is a good balance between hops and malts. Hop citrus flavor, along with an equal amount of malt sweetness. I wa sexpecting a sharp, slightly harsh finish due to the high hop aroma, but I was suprised to find a very smooth mouthfeel and finish. This is a very easy IPA to drink and very sessionable if you like hops. Overall, I was impressed by this one. The aroma tricked me into thinking that this would be rough to drink, but I was proven wrong. A great brew from Flying Dog."
"Drinkability is poor, this beer is a shock to your system. Overall, this beer has good flavors, but is brutally unbalanced. Not recommended."
"overall for an american pale ale there isnt enough hops although it would be a nice english pale ale"
"Got this one in a 12-pack mixer from Flying Dog. 12oz bottle with some far-out illustrations on the bottle. Rather amusing. Poured a golden coppery hue with decent head retention. Aroma of hops, hops and more hops wafted up to my nostrils. Great smell. Taste was really nice; packs a good hop punch which is balanced out by the malt rather well. Delightful. In my opinion, this was one of the better IPAs I've ever had. Granted, I haven't tasted that many, but this one was true to the style and really pleasing on the palate. Great beer."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a good off-white head that left nice lacing as it dissipated. The smell is grassy, sugary grapefruit, a tad too sweet. A big bitter grapefruit rind hop blast but mellows out very quickly, leaving a grassy hop aftertaste. It has a sweet malt backbone to offset the bitter hop, perhaps a bit too malty as it quickly rids the hop flavor, still good though. Has a moderate body with a slick feel, finished remarkably not bitter. A good AIPA, probably not up to snuff for hop-heads but drinks well."
"Very smooth for an IPA, lacing was perfect, leading to a very satisfying mouthfeel. A great IPA."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth as can be, and would be a great session brew."
"pours a golden color with a slight reddish color to it, smells good too, floral hops are prevelant but not much else, no malt smell at all. tastes is odd, something seems off. has an ipa taste but has some kind of metallic aftertaste or something, i can't put my finger on it. most of the flying dog stuff is great, maybe i got a bad batch"
"D- This is not my type of IPA. I am more of a hophead so I expect alittle more bang with an AIPA."
"On the whole this is not a spectacular I.P.A. The heavy bitterness is too much when not complemented with any other flavor. Worth a try, but there are so many better examples out there."
"Pours clear gold with a small white head which recedes quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is really nice sweet citrusy hops, a little one dimentional but appetizing. The taste doesn't live up to the nose. Malt backbone is lacking. Hops are big, as expected. Citrusy but mainly it's bitterness that the hops impart. Big aroma hops, big bittering hops, but small flavor hops? That's what it seems like to me anyway. I do like the bitterness, and it's not really bad by any means, but it could be improved somewhat. Medium mouthfeel, well carbonated. Pretty drinkable but I'd rather have a different IPA. Okay overall."
"M/D: pretty solid beer, i ate some spicey pan fried catfish with the beer and it cleaned the palate extremely well. a very solid and different choice, nothing that will knock your socks off, but good justthe same"
"This beer pours an amber color with ample carbonation (noticing a pattern here). Aroma is faint with hints of hops (is that Cascade I smell?) and a touch of fruitiness. Taste is interesting. There's a hop bite up front that quickly leaves a nice touch of bitterness on the tongue. Not overpowering and the finish is dry. I would say it's a decent IPA for the style. To me, an IPA has to have that touch of bitterness or else it's not really an IPA."
"D: Eh. Nothing inspiring about this brew. Too much bitterness without enough balance for me."
"Pours a crisp clear amber with a thin diminishing head. The aroma is on some citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is somewhat well balanced between the citrus hops and sweet malts, but is still nothing spectacular, slightly weak, doesn't really seem like an IPA. The beer is crisp, but the taste gets in the way. This beer certainly seems like a generic example of a weak IPA, truly nothing special."
"12oz bottle from Florian's - first time I've seen it in ME. Translucent amber-red body with a good inch of off-white head that sticks around. Citrussy hops with a good bit of caramel malt. Citrussy hops and caramel malt equally share the flavor. The mouthfeel is mid-range, but borders on syrupy which hurts the drinkability IMO. Not my favorite IPA, but a fairly solid one nonetheless."
"Pleasant, but not really that interesting. Their classic pale ale was better."
"Solid solid solid. Leans on the hop side of the scale, but that's expected...yet it's still balanced. Highly recommendable."
"This is a great session beer for a hophead looking for a good fix, but not a super-heavy ball-buster of a brew."
"A middle of the road IPA. Nothing really wrong, but unimpressive. I'd stick to either side of the Dog pound here, either Doggie Style Pale Ale, or Double Dog."
"I recommend trying this flying dog brew, it's good beer, no shit."
"Snake Dog's label appealed to my 4-year old daughter as I was perusing the shelves, so I bought a six-pack. The beer poured a stunningly clear deep copper with a generous foamy head. Heavy white lacing is excellent. Fresh piney, earthy smell. A better than average hoppy flavor, but does not have a bitter finish like some harsh versions of the IPA style. Medium mouthfeel that is highly drinkable to afficionados of the style. Goes great with cold sandwiches, subs, etc."
"D- this is an interesting IPA that is work a try. Fairly drinkable because of its lightness."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, this is definitely not a beer that I would continue to drink or even start drinking, if I had another decent choice."
"I like their malt bill for the beer, and the hops come out well. The aroma is great, and the beer is a decent IPA, however I think their yeast detracts a little from the nice hoppiness expected from a traditional IPA."
"feel of sweet nut grass raw pine"
"I love the Flying Dog bottle art, very appealing, although it makes the beer out to be better and more badass than it really is. I poured a 12 oz. bottle (no freshness date) into a mug. The heady was extremely foamy and lasted for almost the entire tasting. Great lace too. Nice deep golden color, almost amber. Overwhelming hop aroma with citrusy, almost grapefuit-like, tones. The taste was similar. This is a serious hoppy beer. Best thing I can relate this too is a very bitter grapefruit juice. The overpowering hop bitterness masks some of the more subtle toasted malt tones. The beer doesn't finish as nicely as it begins, but it is easier to taste the toasty, almost burnt, malt notes. Overall, not bad. Perfect if you need a good hop fix."
"Body is average, medium-bodied and smooth, but not too easy to drink due to the unbalanced ingredient profile. I do remember trying this before and not being crazy about it, but it wasn't as poor as this bottle, maybe it's been mishandled or misbrewed?"
"Drinkability: Good. This is a pretty refreshing IPA for a nice hot day."
"Pours a dark golden with a head that quickly fades. Pretty decent lacing. The smell is slightly sweet and grainy with light floral hops. Not what I'm looking for in the style. The flavor is better, but still a lot of graininess and light hops. A little sweet and with a dry maltiness that is almost chalky. Not terrible, but not my top choice. Mouthfeel is okay, relatively crisp, but pretty grainy and a little light. Okay drinkablility, but the graininess is annoying. Many better options."
"Just can't do it."
"D - A good session IPA and a good selection to bring someone into the style."
"Medium bodied and ""wet"" feeling. Slightly fizzy, with a bit. Thickens at the end. Quite buoyand on the tongue. It's a very good drink. Maybe too thick for more than two in a row, but definitely good enough."
"Strong, assertive hop presence with piney bitterness through the sip. Slight citrus twinge and smooth mouthfeel without overcarbonation or any bells and whistles, just straight hop attack. Nothing imaginative about the taste, but solid and drinkable. My second favorite of these puppies after the Gonzo porter."
"Beer pours a golden orange with a light cream colored head. Smell is of floral hops and citrus. Beer tastes a bit unbalanced with the malt and hops just fighting it out rather than complimenting each other. Typical mouthfeel, nothing to write home about. While I wouldn't turn down this beer when offered one, there are better examples of the style out there."
"It poured out into a pint glass. Large foamy head. The color was a nice amber/copper. The aroma of earthy hops is present. The aroma is pleasant. The taste is the fruity hops up front and the malt comes through quickly thereafter. The body isn't a medium, but I wouldn't call it thin. The alcohol and taste allow for you to have quite a few before you call it quits."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking ""sessionable"" beer with flavor that is not overpowering. I've been drinking this beer for years, even before visiting their brewpub in 2000. Always look forward to picking up a six-pack."
" Definitely drinkable, but one can do better."
"Overall: A solid pale ale, largely unremarkable but decent. Good one for just enjoying and not worrying about much else. Worth a try."
"Pours to a hazy bronze with a nice foamy and clingy head. Smells very malty and the bitterness of the hops is evident in the smell. The taste has a great balance of the sweetness and bitterness. Flavor is consistent throughout, no variance from first hitting the lips to the finish, rare for a beer of this type. Very fresh and surprisingly light on weight but not on flavor. Carbonation is perfect. A delicious brew. I will seek out again."
"Kind of thin bodied. But I really like this IPA, I could drink it all day."
"I drank this 12 oz bottle from a pint glass. The color was a nice light orange with a 1"" white head. The appearance was very nice. The nose was strange with a little hops and something else I couldn't quite place. The taste was a little malty to me but I could also taste the hops. The beer was pretty sessionable and I ate some aged sharp cheddar with it which really seemed to complement the beer. For some reason I kept thinking ""they should make a Double Snake Dog"" and that would be good."
"d- sessionable, hoppy but tame, great nose, feels like something is missing up front, but enjoyable none the less, can't say i wouldn't have it again or that i wouldn't recommend it, pleasing"
"Overall, I would try this beer again. It's drinkability is very good."
"Comes out light copper in tone, large off-white head and mild lacing. Nose is of citrus, pine, some spice. Flavor is pretty typical of an average IPA, citrusy bitter hops, some earthy dough flavors, and notes of peppery spice. Hops are pronounced but probably wouldn't satisfy a serious hophead. A pretty good IPA that is very drinkable."
"D - Almost too sweet for the bitterness. Not enough balance."
"This poured a nice, golden-honey color with a finger sized head and good lacing all the way down. The smell is quite hoppy but with a nice sweet backing that has a honey/nectar quality. The taste is not as sweet with a good smack of bitter hops and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but pleasant. This would be a great session ale. Not bad at-all."
"Pours a thin white head with considerable lacing. Color is orange-copper and slight haze. Aroma is American citrusy hops and some malt sweetness and some spicy yeast esters (different, but welcome!). Flavor is pleasantly hoppy and bitter with a strong malt backbone to hold it up, a very good American IPA flavor. Finishes dry and pleasantly bitter. A fine choice."
"Poured from a 120z bottle into a snifter. Thin head quickly dissipates. little foam bits cling to the glass. Orange/Amber in color. Slightly bitter taste reminds me vaguely of grapefruit, about what you might expect from an American IPA. Very easy to drink. I wouldn't mind having this beer again"
"A very nice beer here, especially considering the price of around 8 bones per sixer. Medium bodied and finishes a shade on the dry side. As far as the drinkability, damn near perfect. Definitely give this one a go. Well worth my money."
"Medium mouthfeel,sticky hops give a cloying feeling. A tasty very hoppy beer,the lack of malt makes the beer a bit thin making this a really drinkable beer. If you like hops this beers for you,if you like malt you might be a bit dissapointed."
"Yup, sweet caramel malt backbone with an acidic spicy fruit blast and orange citrus undertones. Strong biscuit malt flavors too. A tad peppery and certainly hoppy, but finishes a tad unbalanced."
"Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA is a good IPA, however to see it just doesn't seem like a full-on American IPA. In my opinion, it's more like an English IPA with a few extra hops. For an American IPA, it gets a high 3. For an English IPA, it gets a low 4. Enjoy!"
"Ok, Ive had quite a few IPAs, and I wasnt expecting much because I didnt know anything about this brewery. But I must admit this brew did bitch slap me upon first taste. Aroma was very strong floral and bitter hops. Hazy yellow color. Semi-sweet malts (I would imagine) this is quite an unbalanced beer...but just at the edge of being undrinkable...so I have to give them points for making an extreme beer and not going over. my glass was empty and I could still get wafts of the aroma even through my stuffed up nose. the last sip even bitch slapped me with bitterness. oh yeah, resinous mouth feel...ok lacing..."
"It's drinkability combined with price makes it a regular in my fridge"
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a medium white head - nose of bitter hoops , piney hopps , sweet perfume , cannabis , and resin  taste of grapefruit , pine hopps , bitter hopps , and - body light watery , and medium carbonation aftertaste of tar, hopps , and grapefruit"
"Tastes dark earhty hops with noticable orange. Some grapefruit fiber and pith. Lemony sour tempering. Malt sweet rises late and is accompanied by a a drying hop bitter that comes across as woody. Plus some fruit esters. Thick mouthfeel and mild, but even carbonation. A nice IPA. Dry finish keeps things clean and tidy."
"This one thins a bit. It's fairly smooth. Nothing extraordinary or over-the-top, but tasty enough to be enjoyable and easy enough to drink."
"Initially, not impressed because lack of a fully body yet, the hoppy taste will improve as you drink more. Would not purchase again."
"pours a cloudy orange gold color with a two finger off white head that holds for a bit with fair lacing on the glass. very strong floral and fruit aroma. taste is slightly sweet, fruity, like peaches turning grapefruit then grapefruit rind. medium mouthfeel with a lingering bitter after taste. taste was a little to strong and i didn't like the bitter after taste. i don't think i would buy it again."
"Tried this from a sampler pack and I was pleasantly surprised. While not my favorite IPA (That would be Victory HopDevil) this is a nice representation of the style and, of the five I've tried from Flying Dog, certainly my favorite. I would definitely enjoy sessioning this brew in the future. Cheers!"
"This beer pours out a slight head that falls into a light head with a good lacing. It has a slightly cloudy golden brown color to it. Smell is hoppy and a little muggy, but still ok-must have an old bottle. The taste is just hoppy and I can't taste any other flavors at all."
"yourself some Snake Dog."
"D - Overall, it is an okay IPA. It just isn't hoppy enough to be considered great."
"Alas, I was disappointed. The taste and mouthfeel of thisbeer seemed a bit thin to me. And the taste didn't live up to the expectation created by the beers aroma. It was somewhat bitter, but not bitter enough to really transmit that citrus hop taste. I felt a bit let down. Also, I felt this beer could be slightly improved by being a bit more carbonated."
"Beautiful American IPA. The initial insane blast of flowery grapefruit-like flavors subside as my tongue gets used to it or numbed by it. By the end Snake Dog is a well balanced bittersweet beast. Also, I dig the zany art."
"Drinkability: A good amount of hop but a wee bit thin bodied. Yet it is still a very drinkable but not memorable IPA."
"Pours a nice rich golden honey color. Perfect one finger head with excellent retention, and lacing. Smell is of piney earthy hops,and citrus. Taste is the same, leaning toward grapefruit, but well balanced in every way. Nice bittersweet finish.This medium bodied beer is good stuff!!"
"The drinkability is good, a nice smooth drinkable beer. MK"
"I like this IPA and would drink lots of it."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick, persistent head. The smell is fruity and a bit floral. The taste is very hoppy and bitter with a slightly sweet citrus like flavor. The mouthfeel is full but not thick. It has a nice carbonation bite. This is a fine IPA that goes down pretty smooth."
"Drinkability: I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I do, but it's a very well made IPA. I effed up, buying four Road Dogs and just one of these in the mixed six-pack I made."
"Overall, this is a fantastic IPA from the U.S. in that it has the classic hoppy sharpness. If you're like me and you dig that, this will satisfy in doses."
"D-Im glad I bought this,its a very good ipa,nothing special or new to me but a very stable brew.Ide come back to this beer again,Im glad I bougha 6er of this.Very good."
"D - very easy to drink. Could be a session beer for me."
"I've tanked a local small brew. An IPA at that. I guess I'm officially a snob. This one was really disappointing, and I like this brewery."
"D: Drinkable IPA, but nothing too speical or out of the ordinary here. Pretty smooth to begin with a softness that quickly turns very bitter and stings the palate."
"D: I could do this every once in a while. It's not bad, just not something I would look forward to."
"Ok i must admit, it was the label that got me to buy this one. Had a nice creamy white head, with a nice citrus and hop smell, however when you get to the taste, blah, nothing there really. Little bit of malt, little bit of hops, but not much else. Definite looks are decieving with this one, awesome label, looks really funky, too bad the beer doesnt match."
"Drinkability is about average. This beer isn't very special but doesn't really make any major mistakes either. This is a classic IPA in every sense but, just a little too forthright in presentation."
"I could easily blast through a weekend with this beer. A great alternative to your standard party beer but not the kind of thing I would want to sit down and have with a meal or if I'm just looking to drink a couple of excellent beers."
"This beer pours a faint gold with nary a head and average lacing. Nothing fantastic to look at, but no biggie. Strangely enough, the aroma of this brew reminds me of cheddar cheese alongside orange slices, sprinkled with crushed rosemary. I can honestly say that, while complex to the nose, I wasn't too excited about my first taste. But Snake Dog IPA gave me a pleasant surprise -- nicely hoppy on the tongue, with a peppery tangerine flavor, and a nicely bitter finish. Very dry too, which I like. This is a good beer. . . much better than I expected."
"Nice change of pace from the other IPA's I've had. Do not consume if you have a canker sore."
"Purchased: 58 Degrees, Tucson AZ"
"There are some great flavors going on this beer. I think that with a little control it could become one of the better IPAs on the market."
"Although in general I enjoy IPA's, but I felt that this one was sub par. The aftertaste was pretty awful as it was bitter but tangy at the same time. I like it and would suggest giving it a try."
"Clearer orange with a twinge of red in the middle. Large foamy white head. Good lacing. Smells floral and resiny. Nice pine acidity and grapefruit flavors in the aroma. Taste is fruitier. Good malt base with a touch of residual sugars in there. Nice hop combination. Sort of English in style with the fruity flavors, but more piney towards the end. Hops control but it's very balance and smooth. Good creaminess in the mouthfeel as well. Enjoyable."
"This beer poured a amber/orangey color with a small white head. It had a pleasant citrus aroma to it which is my favorite smell from an IPA. The taste was excellent. This beer shocked my taste buds and left a warming sensation throughout my body (I know that sounds pretty lame...). I had three of these tonight, all three went down smoothly. I'll definitely be coming back around for another 6-pack of these at some point!"
"Drinkability: A drinkable IPA, but I think I prefer Flying Dog's APA."
"Pours amber with creamy white head. Nose is herbal hop aromas and sweet malts. The flavor is very bitter, with lots of malts to balance. Some fruitiness is present as well. Medium mouthfeel, I'm not noticing a lot of carbonation. This is good, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these. This beer isn't spectacular, but it is solid. I might drink this again, but there are better choices out there as well."
"Note: I had this one a few years ago in a case I bought at work and don't remember this one tasting as good as this one reviewed today...pleasantly suprised."
"Flying dog IPA was golden orange in color with a nice off-white head. The head had good retention and left lots of lace behind. Hops dominated the aroma. The taste was also dominated by hops. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. The drinkability was good. Middle of the road IPA."
"One of the local stores has started carrying Flying Dog. I'd sampled some at the ABF, and thought it worth a try. This was a cloudy orange color with a small head. Very floral (?roses) aroma. On tasting, initially some hoppy bitterness, then some bread. It becomes more smooth as it warms. I liked this beer, will buy it again."
"Although not my favorite so far, this is a great IPA. I really like the bready taste and the alcohol warmth that accompanies it. I will most likely come back to this one again."
"Overall, I didn't care much for this beer. With so many IPAs out there to choose from, I doubt I will ever get this one again. Not recommended."
"Boatloads of piney hops permiate thorough the thick off-white head. The taste is a little strange and abrasive at first, but after the second sip my taste buds have adjusted and can appreciate the balance between the thick malt and the hops. Mouthfeel's a bit on the thick side, and a bit sticky, but it's pretty easy doing down."
"Pours a deep amber with 2-3 finger head with great retention and decent lacing. Smell is typical IPA with a hint of pine. The taste is above average with citrus and caramel coming through. Very smooth and very drinkable in my opinion. This is one I will personally come back to."
"This beer pours out a clear copper color with minimal head. A nice piney sweet smell that was not over powering. For such a hoppy beer the lacing disappeared quickly. Hops were very pronounced from the start to finish with a sweet maltiness that was able to stand up to the hops. A higher alcohol ""warming"" then I would have expected. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected. .Finish had the appetite inducing effect I expect from an IPA, but was a little to sour for my taste. Fared better when paired with food. I couldn't see myself grabbing one unless I was having a meal."
"Pours an reddish amber with a decent beige head. Aroma is piney and resinous with some toastiness. Taste is hoppy, roasted and nutty with a piney almost astringent finish. If the finish didn't have a slight harshness I would give it a 4. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Quite drinkable, and a nice change of pace from my ""house"" IPA (Smutty)."
"Not very drinkable either. Takes some effort to finish the pint, and it just doesn't make me yearn for the next sip like other IPA's often do."
"Drinkability: I could down a few of these. Don't think it be my beer of choice at a session though."
"A rather good IPA, and totally sessionable. Pours out to the usual cloudy orange-ish yellow color with a smaller head of white foam. Lots of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of citrusy pine and hop oils are heavy and penetrating. Taste is medium bodied yet maintains the elements of a good IPA; Citrus, hops, pine, sweet malt. Nice. Mouthfeel would've been better with more carbonation, but was acceptable as it was. Drinkability is north of average. I'd like a sixer of this from time to time. Worth trying."
"This is a drinkable beer, and a very typical example of the style. Id have it again, especially at $5 for a pitcher."
"Drinkability- An approachable IPA with enough hops for the average hophead to be happy, yet surprisingly not too bitter. Admittedly, there are lots of better IPAs out there, but this one is still a solid, very drinkable choice."
"It is rare that you can make this claim, with the way America is run, but Flying Dog IMPROVED this beer. It was a nice session brew to begin with, but they added more malts and hops to this one. Pours an unleaveable head, great lacing down the glass. Classic microbrew scent with hops in the balance. Terrific grapefruity taste and a dry, balanced finish. Try it a second time, it is much better than the first."
"Well, it's pretty nondescript, but not totally sans value. Though, that's not a ringing endorsement. For my money it falls short of what I want in an American IPA. So, I'll finish this six and then move on, no worse for the wear."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a 6 oz. glass at a taste testing. Perfect golden copper color. Strong hop aroma and taste, with just the right amount of bitter to make this a truly good beer. Im surprised that it ranks so low with others. I think Flying Dog did well here, and am looking forward to drinking more soon."
"Overall. ok, but below average for the style. Not a totally well balanced beer. But it is do-able."
"It's a clear, toffee-amber color. It's starts with a nice creamy, bubbly head, but it doesn't retain all that well, though it comes back easy with a swirl. The smell is of floral, resinous hops, and some sweetness from the malt. The flavor has a distinct sweetness, kind of a toasted pale male but not really caramel like, almost like apple juice even. The hops are initially kind of musty and resinous. Some citrus like flavor comes through eventually but its mainly a floral type taste. The mouthfeel is on the dry and tangy side. This is a good IPA, and is quite drinkable, but it's not top shelf."
"Cheers!"
"Light amber color with good head and retention. Aroma is very nice hoppy with citrus notes. Flavor is also mostly hoppy with just a bit of malt sweetness to counter the bitter finish. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch on the thin side. Overall a nice IPA and very drinkable at just 5.83% ABV."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with white creamy lace on top. Smell is light with notes of citrus (grapefruit in particular). The taste begins with sweet malt, then the citrusy hops make their presence felt and finally the sweet malt taste comes back towards the very end. This is an interesting IPA that is really not bad at all. I like the balance between the fresh tasting hops and the malt."
"Drinkability: An easy enough to drink IPA, although beyond this mixed pack, I do not think I would go out of my way to get this one again."
"I may be prejudice as I just finshed a huge belgian beforehand."
"Very drinkable. A nicely understated IPA. ABV makes this a nice session beer."
"On cask at Papago brewing. This beer had a fluffy half-inch light foam top with great retention. Sweet aroma of citrus hops and sugary malt. Flavor was excellent, sweet orange and grapefruit-like hops with a tangy bitter finish that goes down smooth. Mouthfeel of moderate thickness and subtle carbonation, very smooth again. I would have had many more of these but unfortunately I had to move on and try some of the other goodies available to me. Not sure if I would recommend the Snake Dog IPA in general, but if you are lucky enough to find it on cask than surely have a pint..."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer, although it might be difficult to drink too many in a row just due to the hop dominance and bitterness level."
"I wouldnt turn my nose up at this if offered and if I was in the mood for an IPA... there seems to be some under achieving on the part of Flying Dog."
"Mouthfeel is unfortunately on the thin side- it starts out chewy and thins out right away. However, it's pretty darned drinkable. Refreshing, and okay for a hops fix. There are other IPAs out there that are cheaper that I enjoy more, but this hits the spot if you're in the mood for Hercules or Titan and it's not available in your area. Just wish it had more meat to it."
"Pours a nice golden amber with a dense white head. Leaves beautiful thick lacing all the way down the glass. The smell starts with a quick hit of sweet caramel but then hops take over with an orange peel and grassy aroma. The taste is somewhat grassy but there is enough malt flavor to keep it fairly balanced. Not a hop monster but a good example of an American IPA. Slightly bitter finish but it doesn't leave a long aftertaste in your mouth. Very enjoyable."
"It has an almost fruity aroma, although it may be too strongly dry-hopped for the average IPA fan, I do like the bitterness. All around, I'd say it is probably one of the best IPA's I have ever had. Left on the tongue, it can get to be a bit extrenuous, but the all-around experience is a pleasurable one."
"Drinkability  Highly drinkable Im glad this was plentiful in the mix pack. Decent IPA dont go out of your way."
"Overall: Wish the taste lived up to some of the smell. Found the flavor simply lacking. If these guys would kick it up a bit this beer could be really decent. As it stands it's not objectionable, but I can't help but think about what this beer could be capable of."
"Notes: Basically an above average craft beer at best. Not a great beer, not a very good beer but above average, not one I'd recommend but I also wouldn't dump it down the sink. Just pales compared to so many other IPAs made by craft breweries here in the US."
"Poured out of the bottle to have a light amber colored body with a rather nice white head. The aroma was citrusy, didn't detect too much else, mainly citrus, some grain. Taste was of strong citrus, but not palate shattering. It was a good IPA, but not great, something I'd keep as a back up beer, but still don't see myself drinking it again."
"Here I'm thinking, ""oh boy, time for an IPA"" while I pour this. Well, this seemed an odd color for an IPA. Looks more like a bitter or something. Aside from that, it's a rusty-orange color with a frothy little head. Seems to be some chill haze. Great lacing. The beer has a very soft malt presence with a kick of hops. I'm not too fond of these particular hops in large amounts, though (I guess as this is dry-hopped with columbus hops, that this must be them showing themselves). Flavors here are flat and dull. None of the brightness I like in pales (wether APA or IPA). Not much character in the malt at all neither. The hops come in and liven things up a bit, right before a tart twang hits me. Seems a bit out of place with such dull malt that this sourness would just pop up and sock me in the mouth. Contrary to the pretty active carbonation in the glass, this is a bit on the flat side. Kind of watery too. Overall this beer seems like an IPA Lite so in that sense, it is easily drunk. Aside from it's thirst-quenching properties, I'd rather have an IPA with more character. Hell, their regular pale has more character than this."
"Pours a crystal clear light caramel color. Volumnous head produced from an overly warmed up beer, oops. Aromas are some serious hops, very resinous and sprucy. Flavor is that intense piney hops flavor followed by some malty sweetness. Pretty middle of the road IPA, not bad, but nothing extrordinary. Nice to have in the fridge often though. Carbonation is fairly low for this style, a little surprising, gives it a heavier mouthfeel which I think detracts from the crispness expected."
"Not a bad beer, but one-dimensional. This seems like an IPA you need food with."
"Not one of my favorite IPAs, but better than most macro brew."
"bought a single bottle just to try. i hate this brewery's label designs. i dont know why either...they look like gonzo, H.S. Thompson kind of stuff and i like that fear and loathing style but for some reason i can't deal with it when it relates to beer. anyway...nice big fluffy orange tinted head. kind of IPA with so much head you know it should taste good. odor is florally hoppy, some sweet citrus tones. taste is very citrusy. like an orange and grapefruit mix. some peach like notes too. hops well balanced with the malt. i'd probably buy a sixer of this if i remembered and wasn't turned off by the bottle design so much."
"Amber. Nose is entirely too subtle with just a touch of fruit and an infinitesimal and insufficient amount of floral and spicy hops. This is just entirely too feeble in both aroma and flavor and its feel on the palate is far from remarkable. Im forced to wonder if their Doggie Style Pale is hoppier. It sure seems like it to me."
"This beer may not be for everyone and I don't think this will ever be a regular in my fridge. Having said that, it's clear some thought and care went into trying to brew a quality IPA. By the end of the six-pack I bought, I really came to appreciate it."
"I'll drink this if it is there but I probably won't be going back for another sixer anytime soon."
"Mild citrus smell and taste. Nothing too dramatic about either. Little bit of a metalic finish to the taste. Thin on the mouthfeel. Overall a slighly above average beer. Nothing great about this one but certainly drinkable. Purchased this in a variety case and look forward to sampling the other varieties that were included."
"Clear golden-amber, like weak sun tea, with a modest off-white head. Pine scents dominate an underlying bergamot aroma -- seems as if there's nothing but hops in it. PIney hop assault up front, a meek citrus rind flavor struggles to be recognized immediately thereafter but is drowned out by a toasty biscuit malt wash in the finish. Not a bad flavor profile at all, just a bit simplistic for my tastes. Smooth, bordering on juicy mouthfeel; medium body. Easily a session IPA, although I can't help but think that better options would always be available, either on tap or on the shelf next to this one."
"This beer pours amber with a small head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. There is a citrusy hop aroma. The flavor is hoppy, and a little sweet. The finish is not particularly exciting, the flavors hit quickly and are gone. Decent, but not excellent. Worth a try."
"Pours a nice honey, rather clear, decent carbonation, a little lacing as well. Smells of light floral, light hops, no skunk. Taste is decently hopped, nothing too bitter. Not a lot of flavor, either. Mouthfeel is OK. Nothing stands out but also nothing ruins it either."
"It drinks ok, not too smooth or harsh. I'd have another (when wouldn't I?)"
"I really like the artwork on Flying Dog beers, goofy as they are. Into a tulip glass, pours a nice copper amber with good head and nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is full of floral hops, perhaps a bit of biscut. All fairly faint through as compared to the taste, which is bold and full of hops. There is also sweetish malt presense, along with lemon and a slight grain husk, but primarily the hops run throughout, and rightly so. Mouth is mildly springy and mostly smooth, with a slight alcohol warming throught the middle. I'm liking this beer, now that I'm judging it, as I've liked this beer and others from Flying Dog for a while. A good selection that I'd drink often."
"Musings: This was the last of the variety that I tried - and also the worst. The taste is a cacaphony of bitterness. No melding of malts at all - and in the end, is better left capped."
"Taste is okay, body is thin on the palate, drinkable yes. something to seek out? Nah, there are better ones generally available."
"The beer was quite drinkable and refreshing but just not what I look for in an IPA. The hops were too light. A good entry level IPA but beyond that don't buy this one for IPA just buy it because it's a good beer."
"Clear light burnt orange in color, thin eggshell colored head that sticks to the glass. Nose is full of piney hops, very rich smell. Starts off with hops that fades quickly into nothing, no aftertaste. Lots of carbonation, that I think numbs the palate a bit. The smell definitely made me expect and want more. Seems like flavor was sacrificed to allow for ease of drinkability. Very light, very easy drinking brew."
"good drinkability nothing to sneeze at in general, but i would add some hop flavor here rather than just bitterness."
"I thought the taste was average; some yeast, hops and citrus. The mouthfeel (bite) was fairly good. I knew what I was drinking. However, it didn't balance too well with the taste. I don't know why (I only had one), but I'm guessing the hops used were more citrus than others used."
"Nice amber color and I would recommend it to another friend."
"Drinkability: A very balanced and drinkable IPA. Nothing's too out of control, but for what's used it's complex enough to be sipped and admired but also handled in a session. More often I'm finding that out about many Flying Dog brews, and I comment them for that."
"Overall a good brew, definitely worth trying if you are a fan of the style."
"Poured a clear, peach-colored amber with a quickly disappearing head to faint light colored lacing. Smell is hoppy and somewhat piny and fruity as well. Tastes just as hoppy as it smells, with a hint of the sweet to bitter taste and flavor of a grapefruit. Mouthfeel is light and clean, with a mention of lightly bitter hop aftertaste. Lower ABV than most IPAs, making it more drinkable, overall a well done brew."
"Drinkability: Not one of my preferred IPA's. This beer's just not nearly as assertive as I'd like it to be."
"I love the overdone West-Coast IPAs, so this is a nice change of pace. Easy-going, refreshing, well-balanced, and nicely hopped with proper restraint, makes this a great brew."
"From the refreshing, green smell upon opening to the smooth, sticky sweet hops, I could drink this stuff for a night. Just the right bite from the bitterness, nothing too wild, it makes a good point to grab another bottle and refill the mug."
"Had it from a 12 pack mixer, and was not expecting much. Wow, was I suprised!!! Granted, abv% is low, but I think thats a characteristic of an American IPA. This beer is very drinkable. I love IPA's, but tend to only be able to have a few at a time because of the high abv% and overwhelming hops. Not this beer, I can throw these back easy. I recommend this for someone just getting into IPA's since it does not pack a lot of punch, but definately delivers on flavor."
"D - A very drinkable IPA, as far as IPA's go. I like it and would consider it a decent example of the style for certian. I could, and likely will, drink this one again. Thje Flying Dog folks do a good job!"
"D-not one of my favorites, couldn't have more than 2 due to the strong aftertaste."
"This pours a orange color with a foamy two finger head.The head is very lacey,but short lived.The smell is not that strong and it's all hops.The taste is much weaker than other IPA's.There is a hop flavor,but it's not strong and there's not much but hops.The m/f is light,weak,and unbalanced.I'm being kind because I like other Flying Dog beers,but this is average or worse.I'm pretty disappointed."
"pours dramatically and settles looking rather average.. orange and clear with a slight distorted thickness. foam once was great and breaks apart into huge air craters leaving some wacky lacing. smells like old high-alpha hops.. citrusey with a musty funk in the back. taste is disappointing.. rather stale and bitter like tree bark. fresh, fruity hop flavor is a real contrast to what's going on here otherwise, and adds something positive to the party. mouthfeel is still weak, light, and lacking carbonation. bitterness overwhelms sip after sip and prevents true enjoyment. the ingredients seem to be here, simply handled by inexperienced craftsmen. like some of their other beers but this one is not a winner."
"My son, who loves stouts, just had a drink and said -- this is a direct, unedited quote -- ""Augh! Ugh. Oh, that's vile. Who would subject themselves to that? That's awful!"" My overall assessment is not quite so harsh or crass, but as a malt-lover, I am totally non-plussed by this one. The other bottle I have is going down the drain. Also, it is one of the first American IPA's I've had, so somebody please tell me they're not all this horrifyingly unbalanced."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these in one session,not cloying at all.The price was reasonable,so i would definitly consider picking up a few more of these."
"I really enjoyed this one. Poured perfect, a nice two finger head rose up to the rim of the glass and lingered for an eternity the lace stuck to the rim the only break was where my mouth hit the glass for swig after swig. The appearance is a nice amber color with that head speaking volumes, bubbles dance from the depth of the glass to the rim. The smell is figgin amazing, nice flor notes, all hop, people should smell this stuff for aroma therapy, very herbal very up front, says drink me all the way. A hint of citrus fruit also sneaks its way in, very full. The taste is nice, I love a good IPA but have not had one in a while, this one seems to fit the mold. Nice body, citrus and malt hit you up front and then give way to a calm bubbly smooth malt but only for a split second when you are hit with another shot of grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus and a great hop kick....good stuff. The feel is water and plenty carbonated but not a hinderance at all to this one. Overall a very drinkable beer, nice in every form...will buy again for sure...an easy every day drinker."
"A bold ipa, but somehow imbalanced - astringent, without being that satisfying bitterness we love in a good IPA. This is decent, but it is no Titan or even Mojo, in my opinion. For the price though, it may be a good standard IPA to keep in the fridge (this or redhook's mediocre, not too bad, not too good IPA)."
"The color is a standard IPA copper with the standard IPA level of carbonation. The head is off-white and about average in height. The aroma had a strong citrissy hop smell with just a hint of the underlying malt flavors. The flavor is bursting with hops, very citrissy, with a mild, oily component. An underlying biscuity malt provides an almost perfect balance. In my book this IPA seems a little underated around here, the hop flavor is excellent with a nice, moderate bitterness."
"overall- at the first taste of this beer it feels like it will be a hit. but it just doesnt finish as strong as an IPA should. the hops trail off at the finish, when they should be peaking. with some tweaking i think this could be excelent, but as of now its just ok."
"Drinkability: Tasty, an easy-drinking, everyday beer."
"Definitely appears to be a filtered IPA..clear copper color with a thin, tan head. Lacing is minimal. Big floral hop aroma & taste..fairly well-balanced malty sweetness to go along with the hop character. Not as smooth as expected..and mouthfeel is pretty dry. Not a bad IPA, but not a great one either."
"Like most Flying Dog brews, I don't really care for this and there's nothing terribly compelling about it; but oddly enough, I could drink a bucket or two of it. Ehhh, it's decent enough to get you through the morning."
"A hazy reddish gold IPA. Lots of yeast floaties and a frothing off white head. The nose is equal parts pine and grapefruit. Not as hoppy as many of this style, but the sweet malt taste and touch of sugary honey make for a smooth, easy drinking combo. Alcohol content is masked by the slight hop bitterness. Now I'm curious to try the Wild Dog Imperial. For a long time, I had been leery of trying Flying Dog's brews, after a bad experience with Tire Bite and Road Dog, but after this one, and after loving the Gonzo, I'm willing to give this quirky brewery another shot."
"Over the course of 12 oz. this grew on me considerably, and by the end I was wishing for a second...a testament to its drinkability and overall flavor profile. I'd be happy to get ahold of another one of these guys."
"This is a really good IPA - I recommend it if it is available to you."
"An enjoyable experience from start to finish. A real variety of flavors make it fun."
"The carbonation is relatively high for style but noting extreme. Not bad, but a little pasty for me."
"Pale amber in colour and very carbonated. Nice citrusy hop aroma... tangerine is the specific smell here. Flavors begin citrusy, but quickly shift into sour apple with a bitter finish. Far too light on the palete. File this one in the ""smells great but tastes not-so-good category""."
"Light body. Very drinkable. I do have to disclose that I had a craving for some good IPA. Snake dog didn't disappoint me, but there is a possibility that my review is a bit tainted. I did find it surprising that the rating of this beer is only average. Well, regardless it's time for me to grab another bottle."
"so-so"
"Very nice IPA."
"Thanks for the bottle Len!"
"Thoroughly disappointing. Nice to see subtle English hops in an American IPA, but the execution is sloppy and unappealing."
"l"
"Not the greatest IPA in the world, but it's not terrible either."
"So, overall the mouth was a tad to thin and weak. You could drink a few of these in a session, but there are much better IPAs at the same price (Great Divide, Avery)."
"I recently got a mixed selection of the Flying Dog beers from a friend. I had not tried these beers in quite a few years, silly me! This IPA comes off more like an English Ale in it's dark color and bitter taste. The hops were there, but a little slow to come around. The color was almost red and the head was nice and big. It was more bitter than I had expected, but still a decent brew. I found the Pale Ale to be more like an IPA."
"Mouth feel is light and refreshing with mild carbonation which makes this an easy drinking beer."
"Pours a nice golent hue with hazy distortion. The head is an off white batter that rises to 2 inches in depth. The hop blast will hit the nose, grass hints, the floral tones are noticable. A very earthy pine. The taste is heaven, a nice light grain goes smoothly with a great syrup malt. The malts are nice and caramelized. The hops are citrusy and pungent. A nice pucker up IPA."
"poured a clear golden color with adequate white head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is more of citrus fruit, but some hops are noted. Taste is slightly sweet with hops present, but not overpowering. Finished with only a moderate dryness. OK to drink but not great."
"Pours a clear copper/orange color with a tall creamy head. Nose is grassy hops, flavor is same with a bit of grapefruit citrus. Backbone of caramel malt balances, some bitter aftertaste but not greatly. Somewhat slight mouthfeel, modest active carbonation. Decent IPA, non-offensive, easily drinkable."
"Cheers."
"Drinkabilty - Could go well with a lots of foods. The strong bitterness prevents me from coming back for more though."
"edit: after reading some of the reviews previous to mine, I'm almost wondering if we were drinking the same beer. I don't have a single complaint against this beer, even regardless of the fact I have had better IPAs."
"Easy to drink on this hot day."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a clear copper color with minimal head. The aroma is unpleasant. The best I can describe it is juicy hops mostly covered by green apples and sour yeast. The flavor consists of the problems mentioned about the aroma plus a weird medicinal quality. The English hops are good, but not enough to safe this beer. This beer just barely safed itself from the sink."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable with some very nice flavors. this is a good IPA and I would reccomend it."
"Just a confusing beer all around for me...loved parts of it hated others. I would get this again, especially if I see it on tap."
"Seems to me to be an over hopped pale ale that is an IPA wannabe. Compared to Stones IPA this is laughable. Appearance is a cloudy gold with minimal head and lacing, with a pungent aroma of yeasty brown sugar and flowers. Though there is adequate flavor to this brew, the flavor is not such as to cause one to order a pitcher! The finish is bitter and dry. I pass."
"Overall drinkability is a 2.5 for me, as I think this is a beer that I can drink (I don't exactly actively dislike it), but I really wish I could have something else instead. I'll make it through this six-pack okay, but I'm unlikely to ever buy it again. I'll be sticking to the Bridgeport in the future."
"Pours a pleasant copper color with a decent head. Has a bright citrus aroma. I enjoy the taste, especially the hoppiness, but it could stand to offer a richer mouthfeel. I think that the taste could linger a bit longer. Overall, I would say this is one of my favorites from the Flying Dog ""litter."""
"This brew pours a deep copper color with a small head that falls to a ring over the top. The nose is citrusy, slightly spicey and a little dirty in the hop with a sweet caramel base. Smells pretty nice. The flavor is more spicey from the hop, not a lot of sweet grapefruit, which I like. There is a slight bitter on the finish, but it is rather refreshing. The feel is a light moderate with a moderate carbonation. Its an okay beer. The flavor is not quite what I expect from an IPA. The feel is also not as thick as I would like it."
"The smell is like grapefruit, pretty strong. There are also hints of pine. The taste is good and hoppy with ample citrus flavor. Other IPAs have been stronger in the hops than this one, the main reason for the lower scores on mouthfeel and drinkability. Overall, this is a fair IPA."
"Overall = I hold IPAs to a higher standard since they're my favorite style. I have to admit this one is a bit below average, especially in the taste department. It's not awful but it just can't stack up with Dogfish Head, Avery, or Smuttynose."
"Impression: very good beer. Never disapoints. A thirst quencer for those hot summer days."
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy amber-copper with a nice creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Typical citrus and pine aromas, citrus and pine flavors with some caramel. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes bitter, a pretty average IPA, worth a try."
"Orange pour with a nice head and decent retention. Floral, almost piney hop aroma. Nothing overpowering though and a little bit mild for my tastes. The hops were definitely present in the taste and were even more pine-like. A very drinkable IPA, but kind of dull and unexciting. Still, those are the only complaints I have about this brew. I had no problem drinking it, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. Glad I tried it though."
"Taste is very light in nature. Hop bitterness is evident but is definitely not outrageous. Finish is comprised of a lemony tinge and subtle carbonation tingle and hop bite. Nothing stands out as far as constituent ingredients are concerned. Fairly mild mannered from start to finish. Not a bad IPA, but not one of my favorites either."
"Impression: Let this warm a bit, and it comes on strong. Good stuff."
"Good but nothing special."
" I'll buy this again."
"Hazy orange color with a nice white head that leaves a lace around the glass. Smells hoppy. Lots of citrus with a sweet malt background. Taste is oily hops at first and then is balanced by a nice buscuit malt. Has a semi-dry citrusy aftertaste. Meduim bodied a good drinkablity. A well done Indian Pale Ale."
"Not a bad IPA but nothing special either. Pours a light amber color with not much head or lace. Slight smell of pine and spruce. Taste has decent bittering hops but also is a bit tangy and lemony. Lacks good American aroma and dry hops. Malt balance is there with caramel and biscuit notes. Seems a little 'weak' for an American IPA probably more on par with a British IPA. Overall a decent IPA but there are many better ones out there."
"Crystal clear, ambered golden. Trickles of bubbles. Thin, white creamy head leaves plenty of lacing behind. Smells purely of pine and spruce with a solid, honey-like, sweet aroma in the background. Piney and bready in taste with a bittering that comes on slowly and smoothly and lingers alongside a fruity aftertaste. At times, it's citric and tangy as well. Mouth is medium-full, creamy and carbonation is barely there. Very smooth on the tongue. A tasty, easy drinker."
"Pours a pretty clear golden amber color with a bit of frothy head which fails to leave any lacing. However, the head never completely goes away. Smell is hoppy - citrous and a little floral, with a hint of pale malt. Taste, although hoppy, was overall subdued. Orange peel and piney hops are quick to hit the palate, followed by a faint caramel taste. Finish is slightly astringent, not bitter from hops, but seems like tannins from the grain husks. Although drinkable, nothing stands out about this beer - a fairly average example of an IPA."
"Yet another Flying Dog product that has made its way into these parts. Pours out a clear light marmalade hue, lots of carbonation, a thin frothy white head, which retains to a wafer thin presence as the beer is consumed. Decent lacing for an IPA. The nose is all malt at first, rich buttery caramel malts, only now and then do I get a zesty whiff of citrus hops, the hops seem to be sleeping. Or hiding. Ah, there they are, in the flavour. Although present, the malt takes more of a back row presence in the flavour, providing support and a backbone to the ale. The hops in turn slide across the surface almost from front to back, yet mellowing out on the aftertaste. The taste as a whole is pretty mild for an IPA, like the curtain on the stage hasn't been lifted yet, and all we get are the muffled sounds of the activity behind it. Hey, we paid good money for these tickets, had to get a babysitter and pay exorbitantly for parking, we want to see some action! Mild at best is how the flavour can be described for this IPA. Well, no, here's a secret hint: when you drink it straight from the bottle you do get a nice zap from the hops, it's more accentuated that way. The mouthfeel is light, a bit more of a carbonated kick in the beginning, but as it sits it loses that edge. In the end, to my chagrin, this is somewhat of a disappointing IPA, it lacks the ooomph that is associated with the style. I also must admit that I do enjoy this straight out of the bottle, it does hide the defects and accentuates the goodness that is hiding within this ale."
"Pours a dark golden color and has a huge white head. The aroma is very malty, lot's of caramel and a definite butter note hidden in there with the hops. Nothing great and for some reason not too appealing. The taste is heavy on the malt and has a decent hoppiness, but it has a nasty butter flavor that overpowers everything else. And the burps I get from this beer almost make me gag. It does have a decent body for an IPA, but I have had way better IPAs than this and they don't make me want to vomit."
"As I put a dent in my Flying Dog mix pack, I'm becoming more and more disappointed. This IPA is no different. Very plain for the style, no kick with the hops, okay head and lacing. Took a while to finish and would not recommend for a session beer. I'm starting to enjoy IPAs in the past few months, but this one did not help that cause."
"A fairly average IPA. Nothing especially sticks out."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer is just a tiny bit above the average IPA, but definitly nothing too seek out. While it's gorgeous boquet promises greatness, the rest is lacking anything special? Would I have another? Yes. Would I enjoy it? Doubt it."
"This isnt as bad as I thought it would be, based on the rather lackluster Flying Dog brews I have already sampled. Im just annoyed that the promise of the nose never panned out. A decent session brew, but by no means worth searching out."
"A nice beer, but certainly not at the top of the IPA world. Since this is my favorite style, I would probably pick this up before most. Still, it has an opportunity to excel and falls short."
"The true yardstick is how you feel when you finish the bottle and my response was ""wow, I'm pleasantly surprised. I'd certainly have one of those again!"" This beer was tasty, smooth and had a very nice mouthfeel."
"Overall this is an above-average American IPA."
"Muddy, ruddy brown/amber with a big sticky head of foam. Aromas are of dirty water (no joke), and some sort of sickly sweet malt and hop combination. The taste is icky, with bad water, and sweet, tainted hops making this taste like horrible-ness. Mouthfeel is average but drinkability is horrible, as the aromas and flavors of this beer are just wrong. My first flying dog beer, from a super-fresh 12ouncer. I'm not interested in trying their other beers! (Well *maybe* the wild dog)"
"Drinkability- Overall, besides the smell, a pretty average, run of the mill IPA. Decent, but nothing special."
"Pours a golden color with a very thin head. Not very much lacing results as the glass is emptied. The aroma is on the weak side, but what is there seems nice. A bit of floral hops with a malt touch to the background. The taste begins with a touch of bitterness before a segue into a floral hop aspect. The bitterness stays present in the background. Throughout, the malt background stays constant, providing nice blance. This IPA is not nearly as complex or hoppy as some, but it is still a very tasty brew, one that I genuinely enjoyed drinking. I imagine this would be a great choice to show someone ""what an IPA tastes like," not too overpowering but still exhibiting the trademark hp bite in the taste. Very drinkable."
"Overall, it was a very drinkable beer, even though it seemed a bit out of style."
"Snake Dog IPA was a disappointment to me. I like most of the Flying Dog beers, but this one just falls short of my expectations. I thought of it more as an extra-hopped amber ale than a true IPA. It's slightly hazy golden body rests beneath a frothy head of off-white that holds fairly well and and leaves some nice splotchy lace about the glass. The nose delivers a caramelish and biscuity malt that's fluffed with leafy and mildly floral hops (seems like Fuggles to me), but regardless, it's very English in nature. The body is medium and it's soft and slightly creamy across the palate; again, very English in nature. The flavor is full and bold, with it's sweetish caramel malts dominating at first; followed by earthy, leafy, and even mineral-like hops towards the swallow and into the lingering finish. The bitterness is well-balanced, however, and once that initial note of sweet malt is reigned in it slowly waltzes to a long and dry hoppy finish. (I keep thinking Fuggles, and I'm not fond of Fuggles.... so maybe it's just me!)."
"Apprearance is amber, poured an initially nice head that dissapated quickly but is leaving a nice lacing in my glass. Nose is of floral hops and of malt that has a buiscuity tone to it. Taste is of a slightly unbalanced match of citrus, malts, and dry hops. Mouthfeel is reasonably full, the beer awakens the palate. Overall drinkability is pretty good. It is a fine beer for a tailgate but is something I would not go after to enjoy after a hard day's labor."
"This beer is too bitter for my tastes. Not well balanced with malt of hops flavor. The hops were used too much to bitter this brew, rather than flavor it. The alcohol is warming and doesn't seem to interfere much. Not a great example of what I think an American IPA should be."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle it displays a golden color with almost no head. There's a light floral and piney hop scent with a bit of malt a roma as well. The flavor has a light hop bitterness to begin but it fades fast into a thin malt flavor. It is smooth with a sweet, clean finish but it lacks the body to leave a good flavor in the mouth. Overall, this is just not a good IPA."
"Final Thought: This was disappointing, after the first drink I took I wish I would have chosen the Anchor Liberty to review instead... Not a good beer!"
"It's a mild IPA, but seems to be a good example of a beer that's greater than the sum of its parts. In spite of its weaknesses, this is quite drinkable."
"pours a slightly watered down looking amber colour. body looks crisp but not full. the head is nice and thick and very sticky here. at first whiff a nice aroma of sweet hops comes out, but subsequent whiffs are met with a struggle to find anything above a thin layer of sweetness and hop. weird how that first one is the only good whiff you get. anyway, the flavour is quite nice: floral hops with a nice earthy malt background. the finish has a bit of a sweet (and juicy) spice kick to it. in terms of hop levels, i'd say this one is middle of the road, but can still be pleasing to everyone. mouthfeel is just about right here. this one is failry nice overall. it's a step up in terms of boldness (though not thoroughly bold by any means) from something like harpoon ipa, which seems to have targeted the masses in recent years and dumbed itself down a bit. i certainly wouldn't mind a few more of these. the best flying dog offering i've had thusfar."
"Pours a deep golden with a two finger head that settles nicely,I pick up some grapfruit in the aroma from the large dose of hops with some nuttiness that lingers as well.Taste is pretty blazee,not much going on here some soapiness and some zesty hop in the aftertaste thats it Iam still tryin to get get more from this beer but nuttin.Man Flying Dog really needs to check themselves there beers are pretty lackluster."
"If there's anything wrong with this beer it's that its body is a little thin. Aside from that, this is one damn fine Pale Ale."
"Snake dog is certainly ""worth a try", but not necessarily a premium."
"But, there are so many better IPA's available. This one fits somewhere about the middle of IPA territory."
"and very drinkable. Very nice !"
"I did, however, fry up some catfish in this stuff, and it came out quite well. Still, the hops in it are oddly bitter in a less than appealing way. I know Flying Dog has a devoted following, but this one's really failed to stand out. I do, however, slightly prefer it to their standard Pale Ale."
"Drinkability - good all around drinker, very easy to drink a session's worth."
"Pours an orange-amber with a smallish white head. Nice hoppy aroma, with minor notes of orange, brown sugar, and biscuit. Slightly foamy, creamy body holds a palate of sweet citrus, very light malt, and a fair amount of hops. Aftertaste is a nice, sweet parting shot. Not hoppy enough to be west-coast caliber, but a decent IPA."
"Cool label on this beer, but that hardly makes up for the rest of it. Pours a pretty, translucent gold, with good head retention. Smell is hoppy but unremarkable. Taste disappointed me. Arent IPAs supposed to be hoppy? Might pass for a pale ale. Dry and plain, slightly sour, there are far better IPAs out there."
"Will that stop me from finishing off my 6-pack? Hellz no. It was quite quaffable in fact."
"Totally mediocre IPA. Pretty much a lighter-style ale with a hop flavor. No challanging flavors, no daring spices thrown in, just a straight forward weak hoppiness. Though not a bad beer, in a world full of supurb IPAs this doesn't make a memorable mark."
"The evacuates the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous burnished copper color, the head is pythonic in size, light tan in color with a semi-creamy texture as it slowly evaporates, the lace forms a thick and sealing blanket upon the glass. Nose has a nice hop floral spiciness, sweet malt, citrus like in its crispness, fresh and clean to the senses, start is sweet with decent malt and the top light to middling in feel. Finish is passably acidic, the hops pertinent to the style, very dry aftertaste, cannot help but feel it lacks just a bit of body to make it a good IPA instead of a mediocre one."
"I enjoyed this beer and I will have to say it's a decent IPAno big dog, but I can definitely handle drinking it. Great session IPA."
"this one was felt a little watery in the mouth but this is very drinkable, great session beer for sure."
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness date, but nice Steadman artwork. Very ""fear and loathingesque"" Pours a light golden amber, not much head, but does leave some tiny bubble and moderate lacing. Light floral hop nose. Missing some malt in the middle of this one, a tad thin and watery. Hops are moderate, grainy and citric, but again a bit weak for an American IPA. More British in attack. So so IPA, they need to toss in more malt and alot more hops to get this one up to speed."
"The snake wraps nicely around the tongue--ummm.... I should clarify. The beer's finish is very well-rounded and works its way around the tongue very nicely. It pours golden brown in color. There was little head and no significant lace around the glass. The hops are bitter and strong. But they mellow quickly in the mouth and finish sweet and rich."
"Bought this on a whim upon seeing it in the store. Will definitely be stocking up. Very nice session brew."
"Snake Dog IPA went well with the rib steak and potatoes that I had during this review."
"Good amber-orange hue with a strong, stubborn white head and some webby lacing. Tinny hops and grassiness on the nose. On the palate, it begins like most IPAs, with a good rindy blast up front that becomes more intense. However, I found the intensity of the bitterness lacking for the style. As for balance, there is little to be had in a glass of Snake Dog. The finish is dry and spicy/herbal...peculiar in a good way. Mouthfeel is a little thin but overall it is satisfactory. Drinkability is high, and this driks more like an Amber than anything. A decent beer from a brewery that has thusfar mixed reviews from me."
"This beer was a disappointment to me. Being a huge IPA fan, I had high hopes. The appearance was pretty typical IPA fare, medium amber with a fluffy white head. Smelled like a good IPA, lots of hops mixed with citrus. The downfall is evident with the first sip. Hops, hops and more hops, but very little else. No malt that I could detect and the citrus aromas were not reflected in the taste at all. All in all, an unbalanced beer that i will probably not purchase again."
"Eh. This beer was a disappointment. The unremarkable brown appearance wasn't unexpected. The grain and citrus aroma should have warned me, but I held out hope. The key factors were there, there was just no synergy. The flavors were disappointing, and drinkability was just about par for the craft brewed world. All the pieces of a good IPA are present. There's a nice malt backbone, and a solid - but not overpowering hop flavor. This brew simply lacks the magic necessary to transcend its basic ingredients."
"Poured a nice golden color with a head that went away quite quickly. Scents of pineapple and piney hops. Good hoppy flavors. Very smooth and nicely drinkable. Bitterness is fairly low. Great session beer!"
"Nice look but a weak aroma. There was little hop presence in the nose. There was, what seemed to be, a sharp hoppy start, but it finished more of a sour taste. I don't find too many IPAs that I don't like and this one isn't too bad as well. Just an average IPA with an Above average label."
"Saw this beer at my regular beverage store for the first time, so I had to try it. Cool label, but that was about it. Beer is definitely not an IPA. Tasted astingent with minimal hop presence. Color was an appealing orange, but taste and aroma were not pleasant. At ten dollars a sixer, I won't be drinking this again."
"This is a decent middle of the road pale ale. The sad part is that this is an IPA, not a standard pale ale. The hops are mellow and theres no bite. The body is light and doesnt have much character. Its a decent session beer, but next time Ill pass. This beer reminds me why I was never crazy about flying dog beers."
"This is an IPA for the bitter hop lover. Pours very golden, with a good tan head that clings to my glass. Aroma is really more malty than hoppy, with camamel maltiness poking through like a german doppelbock in the nose. Taste has a distinct maltiness, which is accompanied and overran by a good dose of hoppy bitterness. The hops bring an adequate citrous taste too, but provide a great dry bitterness. Good slick mouthfeel, and very drinkable. This is a good , very balanced and sweet IPA."
"Beer is good. Happy seeking and beering."
"This is borderline sink-bound. Off and boring aren't things I embrace."
"Malty, corny aroma can't seem to find the hops. Yellowish tan head leaves a solid coat of lace as it slowly fades. Light orange colored beer, clear with very little carbonation bubbles. Floral and tea hops in the flavor, decent sweet malt base. Finish is a little bitter, nothing too much. Body isn't all that full, just thick enough to slap some flavor on your tongue. Gimme some damn hops!!! The only difference between this and the pale ale is the pale ale has more hops in the aroma, and the IPA is a bit more bitter in the finish. The bitterness is a bit much for the mild flavor if you ask me."
"Pours a hazy gold with all kinds of carbonation. Aroma is pleasant - mild malts, caramel, citrus. Really uneventful in the mouth. Medium body, slightly sweet malts, mild floral hops, some rather unfortunate metallic flavors towards the end. I'm indifferent."
"While not quite hefty enough to be an IPA, and a little to stately to be a pale ale, this brew is very similar to a Anchor Liberty Ale with more grainy toast and less hops. It's flavorful and drinkable, but not outstanding in any one regard. Still, if the price were right, I'd gladly drink this again."
"It would be hard to be the brewer of this beer - I could see how this would've pushed the game ahead a bit 10 years ago - but now the brew seems overly tame. Change the recipe and offend someone? That might be the call i'd make..."
"I'm not necessarily a hop-head, but I do appreciate a good IPA, this is not one. Glad I just got a single, won't be buying again."
"Pours a light copper color with a white foamy head that stayed for a while. There was little lace on the glass as I finished. Smells like grapefruit with a slight hint of flowers. Tastes slightly toasted, earthy, with a hint of grapefruit at the end, but not as much as I anticipated. Seemed medium-bodied with just a tad too much carbonation. Seems pretty drinkable, not a bad IPA."
"A great cross between the American and English versions of this style."
"This is boring for an IPA, but it it were labeled just Pale Ale, I might see it differently. It still wouldn't be earth shattering, but you wouldn't come in expecting more from it. It's really not that hoppy. The malt is good, but the hops are lacking."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not much an IPA either."
"No, I didn't buy this in Moscow. If only I could be that lucky. It was hand-delivered from the States - a little American island in the pale lager ocean that is Russia. It poured a cloudy orange copper color under a one finger off-white head with big bubbles, decent retention and nice lace. The nose is surprisingly mild, with just a hint of mild flowery hops. The mouth is medium-bodied and well carbonated. There's a touch of sour (orange?) and a bit of tinniness amongst all the flowers and bitterness. The finish is all chewable hoppy bite, while the aftertaste has a touch of the sour and the metal. This is not as smooth or hoppy as many IPAs, but certainly enjoyable."
"Orange colored brew, little carbonation bubbles rising slowly. Big white foam head with some big bubbles. The scent is orangey, with some hop oil scent as well. Taste is hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Citrus flavors, oilly texture. Some malt balance. Med/full bodied. A different take from the extremly hoppy IPAs found from this country, not a bad beer at all."
"-Oelergud"
"Snake Dog's label got me in the mood for a big time IPA, but the beer doesn't measure up. The appearance and the aroma are good enough. Trouble is, flavor and body/mouthfeel are much more important and make or break a beer as far as I'm concerned. This doggy might not be broken, but he's cracked. Or is that neutered?"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a half inch tall almost white head, which fades to a bubbly film rather quickly. Golden hue, good lacing present. Kind of a fruity nose, and a flavor consistant with that. Would expect more hoppiness, alhtough it does kick in at the end of the taste. Quite drinkable, for sure."
"Soft golden sunshine hazy yellow color with some steady carbonation bubbles at first but calms to lightly lifting and in less amounts. Nice finger high head of off-white foamy froth that diminishes with a steady flow, lacing leaves broken, thin stringy sheets and tiny spots. Smell is mostly malts with a dryish biscuity caramel, touching some sweet fruitiness and floral attributes with the hops, but nothing strong enough to portray a hopped up IPA. Flavors aren't as hoppy as I like but its not a bad tasting beer overall. Its mostly malts with a biscuity dry caramel, a bit oxidized and plain, but comes across soflty enough, yet starchy as well, which doesn't help much. Hops are tame in its bitterness, just a bit of a bite but doesn't carry much character or length, just some slight floral and woody dryness floating around in the finish that has a fairly decent dryness thats mild and pleasing. Mixing in a bit more are another layer of the biscuity drying malts that has a whole grain touch. Feel is a bit harsh and scratchy in texture thats a bit chalky too just before the finish, other then that its medium in body and would be quite nice if it was smoother. I wanted to like this beer, I seemed to like it, but I didn't. It has effort but no results for an IPA."
"Golden amber in color with some copper tones thrown in. About an inch and a half thick rocky off white head with medium carbonated body resulting in an attractive appearance. Aroma is pine resin, and mandarin orange with a hint of grass. Bite of citrusy hoppy bitterness in the taste is relatively mild (for an IPA). The underlying malt is not terribly complex, but does add caramel like sweetness to the mix. Medium to thin body with smooth mouthfeel. A sessionable IPA that is well above average."
"Pours a clear orange/red amber, with a small beige head that retains well and leaves behind some patchy lace. Aroma is disappointing, being very subdued. Some pine hoppiness and caramel maltiness are barely picked up. Mouthfeel is actively carbonated with a mild hop bite. Taste is not very complex, with caramel malt sweetness and pine oil hoppiness. Finishes dry and bitter with a pine oil aftertaste. Not bad, and pleasantly drinkable. A middle of the road American IPA."
"Drinkable, but why would I want to drink this? YECH!"
"For some reason this poured with an enormous head on it (I didn't think i shook up the bottle at all). Very mild smelling for an IPA, smells lightly of hops, that's about it. Taste is pretty unpleasant. Has a sour flavor that taste like hops and melted plastic. This is the worst IPA I have ever had, and this is the 10th different one I have tried. There are many better IPAS out there, and I wouldn't waste your money on this one."
"Medium, oily feel, very good drinkablility, I wish the taste and aroma were a little better."
"Pours a nice dark gold with an average white, frothy head. As I drink this ale the lace forms thick rings around the inside of the pint glass. Looks like there's lots of carbonation. The smell is very light, nothing dominant, but the citrus aromas are most prevalent and the hoppiness very subtle. Slightly viscous mouthfeel, and here the carbonation is less than I expected. The taste is sweeter than most IPA's; there's a little touch of apple, perhaps. This is a nice friendly brew."
"Alcohol by Volume: 5.8%"
"My guess is that sales were low so they tried to make it more like other successful IPAs. Either that or I had gotten an off-bottle."
"This brew does have a certain drinkability but just doesn't seem to fit what I've come to expect in an IPA. Snake Dog comes across more like a pale ale than an IPA. If you want a modestly hopped IPA, look no further. If you're looking for an assertively hopped IPA, keep on looking."
"A very nice IPA. Pours a very light and clear copper color and topped with a small white head of foam, which delicately laced the glass. Lively aroma of citrus hops and lemon. Also some sweet graininess. The flavor is lightly sweet with a light to medium body of sweet malt and the beer very drinkable. Pleasantly bitter in the finish. A quality beer."
"This is a medium bodied beer that is sweeter than other IPAs, but the hop bite still shows up. Definitely drinkable and a little above average in the IPA world."
"Sample came from a mixed litter of ales, have 5 more Flying dog brews to try :) This one poured a clear golden with a thumbnail sized head that diminished quickly. Smell of citrus dominates. Tastes of a light IPA flavors with nice bubbles and a little hop bite on the tounge. Good tasting brew, but mild for IPA more like a good pale ale. If I were reviewing this as a pale ale would definitely rate it better. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing bubbles and hops make your tounge tingle. Maybe I just have become to use to Stone brews and don't consider other brews hoppy? Would hit the spot next summer for sure."
" A good session IPA that lacks a little body. It seems alot of bottled beers lack the body and character of thier Keg versions. But this is not news to most. This beer suffers that affliction, as I know it is fuller and more balanced on draft. Either ultra filtration and/or forced carbonation at bottling seems to suck some of the life out of this dog."
"I wouldn't pass a free one down but it's just not my cup of tea, old bean."
"This brew is slightly overbalanced in the direction of hop bitterness, but for hopheads this is a good thing. Not exceptional for an American IPA, it is still a strong showing for the style."
"Snake dog IPA comes in a bottle with one of the coolest labels I've ever seen. I take it upon myself to test it for myself and for the good of mankind (don't say I've never done anything for the planet) So much frothy head!!! The georgous head slowly backs down leaving a pretty lace covering the entire glass. The head leads to a coppery amber color.The smell is fruity... orange. Lots of orange. The taste is also quite orangy. There isn't much to speek of in the terms of hops, but I do very much enjoy this beer. It's very refreshing... much like a fruit beer. This beer is without a doubt step two for the rookie beer drinker."
"This beer poured a very light amber color with a thin pillowy white head that left slight lace down the glass. The smell was very strong on oranges with a very slight hop scent comming through as well. The taste was quite dry with a touch of hop flavor, but other than that there was not much else to taste other than a slight hint of orange. The mouthfeel was a little too carbonated for my taste and could have been toned down quite a bit. This beer had potential it seems, but it is just unbalanced and not as flavorful as it could have been."
"A very nice IPA, I will definetly consume more of these."
"Orange copper color. No head to speak of. Sweet citrus mainly orange/ some grapefruit. A little yeasty. Citrusy lemon orange hops with a toasty toffee malt flavor. Linguring bitterness. Kinda syrupy, but not thick. Very drinkable. Not bad, doesn't distinguish itself from the pack though."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that is gone quickly. Aroma is citrusy with a little hops and malts in the back. The flavor is orange peels with the malts detectable in the back and the finish is a little dry. I wasn't too impressed with this one."
"Update  I was the high ball review over a year ago so thought I should revisit this fella with a 2004 vintage. I massaged the ratings a bit but overall I still stand by my recommendation. This is a terrific and fresh (new) IPA."
"I don't know if the label is the best thing about the beer, but it's gotta be up there. A fairly average IPA."
"Light copper color with amber highilights. Good clarity. Topped by a generous off white head that shows decent retention and throws a bit of lace. Aroma is just a touch of sweet floral hops. Not much else. The taste is well bittered, but not overt;ly hoppy by any means. Nice malt sweetness is complimented by additional floral sweetness. A gentle bitterness is released on the finish. The aftertaste retains some of the bitterness as wisps of light fruity and floral sweetness dance in and out. This is a smooth and malty IPA, seems more in the British Style than the American style. Mouthfeel is pretty solid, as there is a bit of lingering body to accompany the playful aftertaste. Drinakabilty is very good, and one of these will not last long. This is one of the better offerings from Flying Dog, along with the Road Dog. I would drink this one again without hesitating."
"Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is citrusy hops, slightly floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet, with a touch of fruit. Hops are bitter and grapefruity. Touch of orange peel. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"Pours copper with slight tint of amber and a large fluffy two finger in width cream hued off white head leaves nice thin rings of even lacing around my pint. Aroma contains a butterscotch esque malt profile with a fair hop aroma thta seems a bit timid for an IPA with some fruit tones thrown in for good measure. Flavor is a bit rusty hop bitterness blended with a syrupy sweet caramel sweet finish not bad just less hops than I expect from an IPA somewhat cloying and not as smooth as I yearn for. Mouthfeel to this medium bodied brew from CO has a great residual sticky texture clings to the palate and doesn't wanna let go. Drinkability is decent if no better IPAs were around I would go for the one with the weird looking dog wth a snake crawling up it's ass. I could drink a few just not as spectacular as the Pale Ale from Flying Dog in my opinion."
"It drinks easy with a mild feel and it goes down easy. From the look of the bottle I thought I was in for a hop blast. Instead it was just a weak IPA. Not a bad IPA if one is looking for a mild fruity taste. Not for the hop head who wants a bit of bitterness and strong hops. This ale does not jump out at you."
"I'm not sure what to expect of flying dog yet. They seem pretty hit or miss to me. Pours copper in color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is mostly grassy. There is a lot of huskiness in the taste. Probably not the best choice of hop variety. Overall, a dissappointing IPA."
"This beer poured a large frothy off-white head with very fine-small sized bubbles. The body was clear with very little carbonation observed. The hue of this beer was orange. The nose was hoppy and citrusy. The lacing was excellent on the sides of my glass. The flavor was very hoppy and bitter from start to finish and the bitterness lingered. The mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue."
"Aroma was grassy, slightly sweet and a little flowery. The only citrus I picked up was in the flavor after it had warmed and as part of the finish. Rich amber color with oranges and red hues. Good steady head with lacing that dropped as drank. Nice bite to the flavor. Still somewhat grassy, quite bitter with a long lingering. Slight malt foundation that didn't increase as warmed (I like it when an IPA does that). Feel was medium and unassuming. Overall decent IPA. Some smoothness developed in time, but not much. Overall covers the bases fine with no apparent weaknesses."
"I love IPAs, but what is going on here!?! Good color of a nice amber with thin white head that diminishes into a ring. Aroma is sweet with lots of grapefruit. Flavor is sweet at first with a strong taste of hoppy fruit and a tongue coating hoppiness that is not very bitter. The finish is long due to hoppy tongue coating but it might be due to the temperature i served it at (48 F). This is a crazy IPA that breaks boundaries set by the IPA style and seeks to blow the minds of it's drinkers. I don't like it as much at first as i might after finishing this sixer but it is definetly not a traditional west coast IPA. An excellent beer to try if you want to broaden horizens or at least raise eyebrows."
"Ahhh the crazy art says it all. Pour was an extremely light, clear copper color with a white head that had some very decent lacing for a IPA. The smell, however, left much to be desired. It was too indistinct and I got no feel for what maybe lurking inside. The taste was much more malty than most IPAs with nice woodsy smoked flavor with just a little tartness in the after taste. There were some pleasent hops in the finish, but not my prototype for an IPA. I need a little something extra. Mouthfeel was generous and creamy. All in all a good brew and pretty damn cheap to boot."
"Honey colored with a big off-white head of tiny bubbles. The head remains for quite a while and leaves excellent lacing around the glass as I drink. Aroma is of hop, pine, and a bit of yeast. Flavor is of smooth hops, not too bitter, with some fruit and honey qualities. Very low malt. A small hop bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, not too bubbly. Not over the top, but tasty and drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a darker golden color with a nice white head that sticks around. The aroma is piney with a slight mustiness about it. The taste is alright, but not that great. There is decent bitterness and a taste of soap suds or something. There is moderate hop flavor. This taste doesn't really do anything for me. The mouthfeel however is pretty light making it a good drinking beer. As most of their other beers, I probably won't buy this one again."
"Hmmmm.....not the usual bite of an IPA. Smell was barely perceptible.....Appearance was nice, but head did not last. Taste was unusual. It wasn't very hoppy and had an odd smoothness that eventually left a bit of bite in the aftertaste. Still, the odd quality was still pleasing, just not expected in an IPA. Very drinkable....probably a pretty good choice after mowing the lawn."
"Below average appearance with a thing head that didnt go anywhere.Clear gold in color with bubbling carbonation.Thin trails of lace left that were somewhat impressive.Bitter hop aroma that wasnt too strong.Very crisp mouthfeel with a long lasting bitterness.Taste is not complex at all.Bitterness and hops hide any other flavor that might be present.I didnt really like this IPA.I thought their Pale Ale had alot more hops and a better taste.A hint of malt on the aroma.Overall good but could be more balanced with the bitterness and malt.I'd rather drink their Pale Ale."
"Between golden and amber, this beer pours clear with a decent pillowy, off-white head and strong lacing down the side of the glass. Hop bitterness is present in the nose, but not as strong as one usually finds in an IPA. Head lends a strong sweetness to the nose; it fades as the head dissipates. Like Flying Dog's pale ale, the taste and mouthfeel of this beer are somewhat watery. The hops hint at a crush of flavor at the start only to fade into a (not unpleasant, but not IPA-esque) mix of malts and water. Finish is pleasant, though--dry and hoppy."
"Snake Dog tastes good but after having Doggie Style, it's a little disappointing. I was trying to work my way up to a higher hop content, but it was actually a step down. Still, it is a very drinkable beer."
"Disappointing, but still good."
"Note: I'd had this bottle stored back for some time, but protected from light. Don't know how much that affected the sampling. If it did at all, it was probably toward the positive considering the style's original purpose."
"Copper in color with a tan head. The aroma was semi-sweet malt, it was also somewhat fruity. The flavor had a malt sweetness, and a bit of hop flavor. It was a medium bodied beer, with a dry finish. It was easy drinking, but not hoppy enough for an IPA. Their pale ale had more bitterness than this one. It was more balanced than anything. I wasnt impressed."
"The smell is sackgrabbingly hoppy. There's something else in there too but who cares? It's pretty obvious this is going to be about the hops. The front is fresh, juicy tobacco. The middle is slightly fruity, with a fresh bitter finish. Some grains on the after-aftertaste. I'm pleasantly surprised by this one. It has some original character."
"A decent take on this style. Fairly good body, with some nicely bitter hops. Just nothing terribly interesting going on as you drink one. I find with the better IPAs you geta variety of flavors and tastes as it warms. This one is essentially the same from start to finish. Good in a pinch, but not if others are available."
"Overall impression of this brew was very good. You can tell its well crafted, it was fresh and very satisfying. No faults at all."
"This beer pours a clear yellow/red with a moderate white head and a moderate to firm mouthfeel. The smell is malty bread mixed with stronger grapefruit. The taste was a round maltiness then a cedary resiny bitterness. Overall a fairly nice IPA. The labels are (as always for Flying Dog) much cooler than the beer inside, though this is one of their better efforts."
"The bitterness is there for this to be an IPA, but it isn't a pleasant bitterness. And there just isn't enough malt up front to balance this beer out."
"This IPA poured golden with a strong long lasting head. The aroma was predominately malt as was the taste. The hoppiness was strong but not really up to a typical American IPA. The maltiness can actually be tasted in the finish. The mouthfeel is refreshing and bitter and a bit light. I find this a VERY drinkable IPA, but that is coming from someone who does not like IPA's. This is not something I would give as a classic example but nice none the less."
"I can't deny it - the crazy labels are what first drew me to Flying Dog. However, now it is also the quality tastes that their beers supply. Snake Dog poured a bright gold color and had a decent foamy white head. The aroma is awesome, fully hopped with floral and candy-like accents - my mouth was watering. Full fruity taste on the first sip with minimal carbonation and a pleasantly dry bitternesss from the hops as it went down. A very nice IPA, comparable in taste (but always below) Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale."
"Notes. Sampling from Blue Max, the label got me, Flying Dog has some unique graphics and label design!"
"My first journey into the world of the Flying Dog brewery. This IPA poured a clear amberish orange color with a really nice foamy white head that left excellent lace down the inside of the glass. Not very hoppy or bold for an IPA but I like it because I'm not much of a hop-head. Thin mouthfeel and it finished crisp and clean. A very drinkable IPA...one that I think I will definitely be buying again in the near future!"
"The label used to read :""Snakes down your throat like a loyal friend", a quote attributed to Anna Steadman, the illustrator's wife?, but the slogan is missing now. It remains a true endorsement, however. Hoppy, but not wildly so . Wonderfully soft and delicious palate. At times, I'm reminded of Anchor Liberty, but it's closer to Bass in smoothness and drinkability. Much less hoppy than many a MidWestern IPA. Ideal as a session beer."
"This is a pretty good session IPA. My main complaint with this brew is that it does little to distinguish itself from Flying Dog's PA, Doggy Style. The hops profile is a bit different. Doggy Style is all citrus while this brew's hops are more piney and floral. But I expect IPA's to be bigger, bolder, fuller-bodied versions of PA's and this brew could easily be considered just another PA. Nevertheless it has a nice bitter bite that I find appealing. A touch of light caramel malt shows up in mid-palate, but this brew could use a bit more. It pours a light orange amber with a white head that maintains a cap and leaves scant rings of lace."
"Pours a clear copper color with a nice off-white head. The smell of pungent citrusy hops and light fresh baked bread malt notes make up the aroma. It smells quite nice! The taste mirrors the smell with a dry citrus hop bite and light malts with an earthy grain background. It is light-bodied and finishes crisp and dry. Pretty nicely done. Cheers!"
"this IPA pours out a cloudy, but bright golden color. a very white and somewhat thin head appears, leaving quite a bit of clinging lace. aroma of caramel malts and an above average piney hoppiness greets the nose. tastes of bready malts and a nice stinging IPA hoppiness. medium bodied....a distinct crispness asserts itself in the finish, followed by a plentiful bitter piney hop aftertaste. although bitter enough to provide IPA lovers a hop-head fix...the malt bill seems a bit lacking to back up and balance the bitter hop load. whatever this IPA is lacking in character, i still found it enjoyable and sufficiently hoppy and bitter in profile. an average IPA, but still tasty."

"One of Flying Dog Brewery's top beers (there are only a few good ones)."
"Note: Perhaps this is why the two Bottles of this beer I had just bought had two different labels. One with a red label that says Snake Dog IPA (India Pale Ale), the other, with the exact same Snake Dog picture, is grey/silver and just says Snake Dog Ale (India Pale Ale). Wierd Heh ??"
"It looks like most other IPAs and has a decent head that holds pretty nicely, leaving lace down the glass. The smell and taste of hops is quiten noticeable, but what's backing the hops is minimal. A slight grassy flavor detracts from the overall drinking experience. It's not a bad effort, but it's nothing special."
"Pours a medium amber color with a patchy but sticky white head. Definite spicy hops in the aroma along with biscuit-like and citrus notes. However, it is not as hoppy as the aroma would lead you to believe. In fact, it only has a medium level of hop bitterness mixed with a sweet malt flavor. It is a bit thin, but goes down smoothly, and would be a nice beer in the summer while outside grilling."
"Middle of the road IPA. Hops were somewhat present in the aroma. Clear gold with a thin, short-lived head. Taste did seem slightly unbalanced. Hops flavor just didn't have the legs for which I was hoping. I would take the Fuller's or Sam Smith's over this if given a choice."
"I really like this IPA..It is very balanced and slides down nicely...It has a great spicy/sweet hop aroma....the body is on the thinner side of medium....for as hoppy as it smells, the hop taste is pretty subdued,  I wish it had a bit more kick on the hops, but they are definitely there...I'm not sure what hop varieties they used, but the blend is very nice....very nice maltiness for an IPA...very tasty...not an elite IPA, but very good indeed..."
"A.deep gold colored brew poors from a high colored artful bottle. The head was nice but shortlived, faded quickly.It does leave a nice lace. Stronger hop over malt but not as strong as other IPA's, but thats a good-thing. I agree this is like a great pale-ale with muscle, a kicking muscle no-doubt. I enjoyed this-one with the grilled flavors of summer."
"Color is bright golden, with a whitish, thin head that almost vanishes in a few minutes, but leaves some lace.  Aroma is of young leafy hops.  Nose is grainy, almost grassy.  Thin body, with leafy hop overtones that linger into a watery finish.  A touch of malt sweetness in the aftertaste.  I was a little disappointed in this beer.  It has good intentions but seems a little simplistic and unrefined.  Needs to be cleaner with a crisper finish, and the mouthfeel is pretty disorganized."
"pours a deep golden color with a thick off white head that fades a little too quickly but leaves a decent lacing on the glass.  Good malty aromas with some nice hoppiness in the background but there is an out of place musty smell hanging around in the background that drops this score a little.  Good bitterness throughout the brew with some nice biscuity malt showcased in the beginning of the brew.  The finish goes somewhat watery, however, and the whole brew suffers as a result.  This brew remains drinkable but is somewhat less desirable b/c of the watery finish.  Not a bad brew but there are so many better IPAs out there that I don't know why you would bother with this one."
"The crystal - clear light copper hued brew is topped by a big bubbled, persistent one fingered head that leaves lace. The citrusy and mildly floral hop nose is accompanied by a touch of fruity esters and biscuit malt. Unfortunately, this brew is a bit lackluster flavorwise.  Hop bitterness is light for an AIPA, and gives way to malt flavors, but the malt profile isn't distinctive. Generic light caramel malt notes and a touch of toasty malt are perceptible. Hop flavor is lightly citric and certainly could be more pronounced.  As this brew warms butterscotch diacetyl becomes discernible.  Ehh.  Finishes w/ hop bitterness on the back of the tongue w/ a soapy hop flavor lingering.  Snake Dog could pass for a decent pale, but falls short if you're looking for an assertive IPA.  Not at all bad for the $4.99 I paid for six pack.  It'll be good July 4th drinking!"
"This didn't tasted much different from their pale ale. This could have used alot more hops to it. Imo it was a bit weak."
"Malty aroma with hops, fruit and alcohol.  Hazy golden brown color with a decent head and a curtain of lace.  Wonderful flavor, malty sweetness initially, then hints of fruit, followed by bitter hop finish.  Alcohol is quite warming.  A very nicely done IPA."
"Notes: The flavour is like a wave ... quick to come crashing in then slowly fading back out. Nice head retention. This is a great American IPA ... good doses of bicuity malt and hops with an sufficing alcoholic punch."
"So, I did a ""face off"" between Snake Dog and the easily available (around here) Summit India.  Summit's IPA represents the ""post- modern blast of hops"" India made in the US that I'm used to and like.  As someone used to a rush of hop bitter/citrus, the Snake Dog was not there -- even almost heavy on the tongue and ""floral"" at the end (more like a mild Special Bitter, but not).  As an IPA, Snake Dog is mid-pack and only OK to me..."
"Definate grain aromas with a hint of fresh hops.  A light and flufy white, practically weightless, head.  Nice looking slightly hazey amber.  Mellow malt character with an odd hoppy character.  The flavors are in conflict.  Confusing signals of citrus, flowers and a mouth puckering hops sensation is in the mix as well.  Not a bad beer, however, nothing to rave about.  Was expecting something more from the Flying Dog Brewery, instead we are given a second rate rendering of what could have been.  Think I.P.A. Light, would be a more fitting name."
"Great label, not so great beer. I expected something a bit more agressive, proving that looks are deceiving."
"Hops get down to business right away, with a somewhat raw, unrefined character that asserts itself  up front, rather than at the finish.  Not much in the way of floral or citrus in the hops, just a 'bite this hop cone"" bittering that is actually a nice change of pace from some other American style IPAs and perhaps more in line with the traditional English version.  Very drinkable."
