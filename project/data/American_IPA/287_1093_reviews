"This is definitely an IPA I would drink year round if I could get it locally. Wonderful first impression from Bell's."
"This beer is bar none the best IPA ever made.....even better from can into glass.  The look, smell, mouth feel, taste, finish, everything is spot on.  Bell's cranked it out of the park with this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"My go to. Such a great beer."
""
""
"Top flight IPA. Full bodied, nice finish, good hoppiness. Always a go to when I can't make another call"
""
""
"Incredibly hoppy, full bodied, tasty beer. My go-to beer every Thursday with my buddies :)"
"Two Hearted Ale is my favorite from Bell's Brewery. The unique taste from the hops paired with the floral nodes really makes this beer unique. Being from Michigan, nothing quite reminds me of home like Two Hearted Ale!"
"This was one of the beers that several years ago got me hooked on microbrews. Reviewing for first time on the occasion of my first time pouring it from a 16 oz. can. Then and now, I find it an almost perfect brew. It's hearty in its hop, consistent in body from initial mouthful to finish, great flavor in its mix of floral and pine, and very smooth. It's very worthy of its standard-setting rep. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well-balanced for the style.  This is one of my go-to beers when I can't decide or don't feel like trying something new.  It's probably not going to win over the real hopoholics, but still a very nice smooth beer.  I feel like it may be closer to an APA vs. an IPA, but we're splitting hairs there.  The 7% is well-hidden, which can sneak up on you as these can go down quickly."

"great american ale, hop filled without blowing you away with bitterness. easy to drink compared with other similar brews.  a hint of grapefruit, pine, and floral hops on the back of the tongue, which is a nice feeling coming out the nose on the exhale. not the most complex or flavorful IPA I've had, but I don't think that's what it's going for. mild, smooth, full bodied ale. nice. will buy again this summer."

"Overall: This was probably my first IPA, and is one I return to over and over.  It is reliably a quality beer, but nothing about it ever knocks my socks off.  Just a good, bitter, balanced, reliable IPA.  I am not a hop head, and love this IPA; 7% is utterly hidden, malts are present and almost in balance.  I will buy this beer again and again."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best IPAs I've tasted.  The hops flavor is the strongest yet."
"Great Michigan ipa! Never gets old to drink. The four pack cans are great as well"
""
""
"This is a great IPA, packs a nice punch at 7% ABV too!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite IPA thus far."
""
""
"Full bodied, solid ipa. A pleasant surprise. Plenty of hops, very refreshing, and not overly dry.  Keep some of these always on hand."
""
"Hops taste a lot, a lot of bitterness with caramel flavor."
"the IPA to judge all others"
"O: Pretty good, for an IPA this is really balanced, I was expecting more hops but the hop characteristics are fleeting then you get a nice malt presence on the backend. Very juicy, I like my IPAs with a little more bite at the front, I would not pass this beer up but I think there are better IPAs especially in California."
""
""
"Color is hazy gold with a thick white head.  Retention and lacing are both good.  Smell is piney and citric.  Smells good!  Just a hint of sweetness and alcohol as well.  Taste is pine and citrus on the palate that is quickly balanced by some caramel malt flavor.  Finish is pleasantly bitter and clean.  Body is medium with good carbonation.  Overall, a very good IPA that I wish I could get on a more regular basis."
"I do not normally like IPA's, but I liked this beer.  It is refreshing and has a mix of grapefruit and subtle spice in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Floral and fruity aroma, a little bitter with grapefruit crisp taste"
""
""
""
"As I increasingly lose interest in IPAs, this one always gets my attention. Well done, Bell's!"
""

""
"Far too bitter for my tastes"
""
""
"A go to beer.  Very drinkable with even yummy flavors"
"Being from Michigan, this beer is widely available. As such, this is probably the craft beer I drink most often. I consider it my old standby. Can't decide? In a hurry? Want to catch a buzz quick? Two hearted is always a good choice.  It is quite hoppy, but crisp and delicious. The high ABV will catch up with you, but maybe that's one of the reasons it's so appealing?"
""
""
""
""
"Very well balanced, not over the top"
""
""
"This is the IPA that started the craft beer movement for me personally.  Just an excellent go to beer."
""
""
"Glad this is a popular beer. I never tire of drinking this one."
""
"I love this beer! It is the right mix of affordability, accessibility, and flavor! If you are looking to enter the world of craft beer tasting, Two Hearted is the perfect introduction!"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best IPAs for a reason. The hype is real. This is my go to beer since they have it at Costco now in MI for $32/case. Excellent hops flavor and aroma. Still like hopslam better but this a a great all-around IPA."
""
""
"Go to IPA anytime any day !"
"Very great beer! Had on draft at BLAH in SD.  Can't wait to try it agian"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding IPA that overwhelms the pallet.  Perfect for sipping, not the best with food."
""
""
""
"Solid IPA. Found it at Samba Sushi in West Village, NYC of all places."
""
""
"I've had this beer several times. First time lives it but every time I have tried it since then it disappoints. I don't understand the hype. Did not seem well balanced at all. Just slightly boozy and earthy bitterness. Aroma was ok - maybe slightly floral. And I love IPAs. I'd probably give it another chance if offered but I won't pay for it again. There are much better IPAs out there."
"Truly a great IPA."
""
""
"The quintessential IPA. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic, huge hoppy smell and smooth, balanced taste.  A frequent short term guest in my beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth and easy to drink"
""
""
"I have tried about 5 times to like this beer that everyone likes, but just can't do it.  Not for me I guess...  Looks good, smells good, but to me tastes like nothing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: No surprises here in flavor. It tastes just like it smells with no complex layers that I can discern. I don’t say that in a bad way, though. The beer wasn’t heavy but heavier than I imagined and it rounds off the fruity taste nicely."
"This beer comes together will great integrity, more than the sum of its parts. I'd always be happy drinking one of these."
""
""
""
""
"First American IPA I've ever had that I actually enjoyed. It is very drinkable to the point of almost being scary at 7% abv. I never cared for the super bitter beers which is typical in an IPA. I just wish there were more IPA's like this."
""
""
""
""
"A much better brew on tap. Enjoyed two effortless pints with a friend. They went quick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy orange color with sticky lace.. A/T pale malt, candy gummy fruit, popcorn, orange, flowery, little pine or even much bitterness.. Medium body.. Really great beer so fruity and floral it almost could pass as a fruit beer."
""
"On tap, outstanding look, feel, taste,.... Great all around IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When it's fresh on tap, it's rare to find a better IPA."
"Real easy IPA to drink. Well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I tend to stick with what I know. I joined this site to break free from that routine, so I suppose it's fitting that my first review is the polar opposite from my usual hefeweizens, porters, lagers, Belgium style ales, comfort zone go-to beers. Perhaps in middle age my palate has changed. Regardless, this beer's a winner. Pleasantly  surprised."
""
""
""
""
"Finally got to try this in California. I'm a west coast punch you in the mouth hop head, but I do enjoy an everyday single IPA, as well. As far as that style goes this is a good IPA but I'm not blown away. Heavy on the grass and pine flavors with a bit more of a malt backing than say a Lagunitas single. Some grapefruit and tropical notes present on the nose and taste but not at the forefront. Definitely a beer I would go back to on draught but not on my radar anymore, living on the west coast."
""
""
""
"TASTE: Deep smoothness, medium bodied, oily hoppiness, orangey, bready, nutty yeast, peppery, leafy, floral, semi-pungent bitterness, slightly dry finish"
""
""
""
""
"A nice tropical everyday IPA."
""
"O: Pretty awesome. Glad I was able to trade for some of this."
"Not bad. I grabbed a 16oz can via mail trade. It was about 3 months old. Kinda malty. But not bad. Like to get a fresh one."
""
""
""
"Really really solid, extremely easy to drink.  With wide availability I see why this is so many peoples go to"
""
"Overall:  a solid IPA albeit on the smoother/softer side of the spectrum.  Definitely get this again if I can find it. (this was actually a bit tricky to find on the West Coast)"
""
""
""

"Beautiful gold color, perfect floral aroma"
"Nice foamy head, great lace.  Taste is great."
""
""
""
"(Draft) at The Refinery in Newhall, CA. Wonderful bouquet-of-flowers aroma.(2/28/14)"
""
""
"Not up to California IPA standards IMO. Disappointing."
"A very good IPA, just not up there with the top tier as Heddy Topper or Road 2 Ruin or Paco's or Baxter."
""
""
""
"Classic front hop bite, crisp selection of dormant aromas."
""
""
""
"Easily the worst ""IPA"" I've ever tasted...if you can actually call it an IPA. Has about as much hops and character as a Bass ale. I am flummoxed as to how this beer is so sought after and over hyped. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is FAR more enjoyable simply because you don't have the preconceived notion that it's supposed to blow your mind. On a 100 point scale, I'd say this is respectfully deserving of 75, and that's generous. Can't say enough bad things about it, so I'll stop. Sorry, but I highly recommend looking elsewhere, anywhere."
""
""
""
""
"Very rich aroma with the very complex hoppy flavor! One of the best IPAs out there"
""
""
""
"Solid, hoppy go to IPA loaded with flavor."
""
""
""
"Floral aroma.  Very well balanced, dry bitter finish.  Nicely carbed, slick feel.  First class IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"As I finish this review, I'm on my third one, so it's very drinkable and very refreshing. Maybe not quite the IPA I'd hoped for, given all the hype. But a solid IPA for sure. Fortunately Bell's is easy to find in my neck of the woods, so I'll most likely be buying this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Was a little disappointed with this one after hearing all the build-up. Maybe because I'm a west coaster I found this a little dull. Much prefer PtE or Alpine, Moylan's, Green Flash even Dirt Wolf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Very easy drinking.  A great IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I always end up going back to the two hearted ale."
""
""
""
"I usually like stouts. But this is delish. The floral notes make it a bit sweet,  not bitter. Loved it. Lots of little bubbles. Very pleasant. Many flavor layers. Hops, floral, bit of malt too I think."
""
""
""
"Overall: It had been a couple years since I had a two-hearted. I remember thinking it was overly bitter. This sample did not bear that view out by any means. If anything it is a bit on the dry side, which I appreciate considering all the saccharine IPAs out there. Two-hearted as an abundance of fresh citrus and floral hop character with only a moderate bitterness. A great stalwart IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my perennial favorites.  So good when its so fresh."
""
"A great alternative to zombie dust. A change of pace solid drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Karl couldnt go all the way"
""
"I agree with much of the citrus and floral attributes given, however, I was put off by over carbonation and a strange metallic after taste..."
""
""
""
"One of my favorites. Very floral and sweet smelling, some grapefruit. Malty, floral, orange blossom, grapefruit. Medium/light body, medium carbonation. Floral and sweet malts aftertaste."
"Overwhelmingly taste of spice that lingers on and on and on."
""
"This one was bottled on december 1 - 2014 * Two and a half months ago."
"Don't have the beer in front of me for a review, but it is one of the best American IPAs I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks,  smells and tastes great.  My go to IPA."
""
"Weird after taste, surprisingly bitter"
"Had this on tap at Detroit airport.  Nice medium Amber with a 1-finger creamy head.  Good retention with thick persistent lacing.  Nice piney, citrusy aroma.  Good maltiness and balance in the mouthfeel but I thought the hops were a little understated in the flavor profile.  Overall very nice drinkable beer."
"12 oz bottle poured into nonic. Half a finger of foamy white head quickly settles to a ring and thin center layer over hazy copper liquid. Dots of lace stick to the glass. Aroma is floral hops, caramel malt, citrus hop, slight tropical fruit. Taste is hop forward with grapefruit peel, floral, and earthy pine bitterness. Some biscuit malt sweetness. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, bitter drying finish."

"O:  An OG to the style.  A brewery that helped usher me into what craft beer is and means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This IPA has a golden, cloudy appearance. Taste is earthy and slightly citrus-y. Balanced flavor and not as bitter as a lot of IPA's."
""
""
""
"very drinkable surprised an ipa..."
"Pours clear golden color.  Great Centennial hop aroma.  Head retention is very good.  Good balance of malt and hop bitterness.  Easy to drink; definitely a go-to-ale."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Finally got to try this...in Puerto Rico of all places! Saw a sixer at a local grocery store in the Carolina area near the airport. A delicious IPA I wish was available in Texas."
""
""
""
"Overall: This bad boy is a 4.75. Excellent go to beer. Enjoy it in the summer as you kick off your shoes and relax on the back porch."
"Wonderful and fun beer - great job"
""
""
"Great IPA, this is a great go to IPA one of the best I've ever had"
""
""
""
""
"Got this one in the 16oz. can.  It looked like it was canned on 8/18/2014.  Great citrus aroma.  Golden copper color.  Drank out of a Dogfish Head IPA glass but also tried straight from the can. Very drinkable for a 7% abv beer."
""
""
""
"Delicious beer! Only wish I could get it in Texas easier."
""
""
"Benchmark Beer- as SNPA is to my OG IPA ;"
""
"Maybe my favorite beer. Bursting with flavor is how I would describe it. I was floored on the first taste.  I actually said wow out loud.  Probably the beer I will compare the rest to from now on."
""
""
""
""
"awesome, my go to beer i can usually get it in michigan for under $9 and under two weeks old.. hard to beat that"
"Great beer. Everyone drinks this beer in my hometown. Always on tap at multiple pubs."
"O: Very solid every-day IPA. Not overwhelming, not insanely boozy, and with a nice balanced feel and taste."
""
"Didn't quite live up to the hype for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Will absolutely seek out and purchase again."
""
"Unfortunately I only had one bottle - now I need to go find more as this is fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"...a little disappointed..."
"Had on draft at The Pour House, citrus in smell and taste.. Hoppy goodness."
""
""
""
""
"Ok, so this was canned 7/22/14 and today is 1/29/15. Pours perfectly with an inch head. Nice lacing. Smells bitter with a hint of chipotle?  Maybe. Tastes pretty hoppy initially but has an oily mouthfeel and it is somewhat flat. This honestly tastes like a more bitter blind pig. I would still prefer blind pig over this, buts it's still good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This 5 word minimum sucks!"
"Had this at the Grand Rapids airport.  Nose is hop forward.  Chill of the beer served on site however limited the aromas that I suspect would come through if served a bit less cold.  Golden color with modest lacing.  On the palate, this beer is hop dominant and has a strong grapefruit note.  Finish is medium long."
""
""
"O- I've had this beer a before and I don't recall such an overwhelming bitterness. It's a solid IPA, but lacks the clean distinct notes of most other highly rated American IPAs."
"Awesome IPA, very very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this. Not overly piney. Just got a six pack that was brewed two days ago at the store. (I live 70 miles from the brewery.)"
""
""
""
"Fantastic--one of the best beers I've ever had"
""
"I would have to say this is one of the nest beers available. Great ale. Not quite and ipa. I would say an intro to ipa.  A fantastic flavor and balance."
"Had on draft. Little sweeter than I remembered. Still very good IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not world class, but very good. I really like Bell's"
""
""
"O: tasty and balanced"
"Definitely one of the best IPAs. I love the floral aroma and taste. Bell's bread and butter beer. I always look for this beer on tap at every restaurant I go."
"This is one of my favorite beers and a def top 5 IPA. Extremely well made. I respect IPAs that impart their own flavor to the hops and this one is outstanding in that respect. Super smooth and easy drinking, this is a great starter for a beginner IPA drinker. Nice citrusy smell, creamy foam, crisp clean look and feel with an outstanding ""pretty"" beer floral-citrus combo. Settles evenly and smoothly in the mouth with a subtle hop bite. Great beer hard to pass up when it's on tap."
""
""
""
"Pours a a light orange with a two finger white head.  Aroma is pine and resin.  Taste is on the malty side for an ipa but still has the pine, resin and snap of centennial.  Mouthfeel is quite nice, medium and easy drinking for its strength.  Overall a nice ipa that I would like to try fresher."
"This is a fantastic IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer. This is the IPA other IPAs aspire to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker in color than the average IPA with hues ranging more amber than golden.  Fairly malty for an IPA.  The sweetness of the malt balances and cuts the bitterness of the IBU's.  Finishes with a sweet pine taste that leaves my wishing it was a bit more crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My gateway drug to the wonderful world of IPA and Double IPA. I really can't say anything on here that hasn't been said before except, I honestly believe if I was restricted to one beer for the rest of my life, I could make it on this one."
""
""
"I love single hopped ales.  Nowhere to hide.  You have to use your skills to manipulate the hopp in order to express it in the end product.  They do a very good job.  The smell is amazing!  Great job Bell's."
""
"Not as hop-strong as most IPAs...definite citrus and light grapefruit, but very smooth and balanced...doesnt beat you over the head with the hops but gives just enough sharp bitterness"
""
""
"Overall:   I enjoyed this, but I have been spoiled lately drinking a ton of heady topper and Lawson's.   As a single IPA, this is decent.  But to me, it lacks that fruit bomb character that I enjoy.  I guess I just enjoy DIPA's more.   A decent IPA, but there are better American IPA's out there like Lagunita's Sculpin, Dogfish Head 90 minute, etc.  Cheers!"
"Great beer. Pick this up if you haven't tried it before."
"This one is not underrated for good reason. Great taste at a very reasonable price. Bell's has world class beer and this one is right at the top!"
"Bitter, moderate carbonation, one finger head; holds well. Well balanced beer."
""
"Mild hoppy Mild bitter finish"
""
""
""
""
"Golden clear. Fresh hop aroma, but doesn't kick your face in. Fruity, citrus, slight pine and creamy. A great balanced IPA."
"V - Good value, decent price and comes in a six pack!"
""
""
"Quite possibly my favorite beer ever and I'm not even an IPA person. Perfectly balanced. Beautiful aroma. Not too hoppy."
""
"Highly drinkable.  A good all-around beer."
""
"Very hoppy. Easy to drink but still strong. Very good choice from double door"
"Perfection! Everything is perfect about this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not an IPA fan, or at least I haven't been, but they are slowly growing on me; bottom line is that I liked this beer, easy to drink, healthy flavors, good balance, moderate complexity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love IPA's. has a great malt, hop balance"
"Overall - wonderful but a bit over-hyped. A must try. Honestly I prefer more floral smelling and tasting IPAs but I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little bland but great easy sipper"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is not overly complex, but everything is in perfect balance, and it's crazy tasty. Can definitely see why this gets so much love."
"Freshness is HUGE with this beer. Drinking an old ass bottle of Two Hearted or having a pint from a dirty tap line will not let you understand what this beer can taste like. Beautifully hazy, aromatic, and punchy when fresh."
""
""
""
""
"I like it. Great taste and feel."
""
"Very good IPA, but a bit overrated in my estimation."
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a dark golden color with a large foamy white head.  There is good carbonation and a lot of lacing.  The odor is strong, IPA like, citrus, grapefruit, lemon, orange, pine, resin, malty, bread like, slight honey, slight floral, a little herbal farmhouse like.  The taste is less citrus, some lemon and orange, more malty, honey, herbal, grassy, some spices, pine, woods, resin, some bitterness, but refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  classic.  Still remember my introduction to this beer:  2006 and my (now) mother-in-law would buy it for trips up to the North Shore of Lake Superior.   I was completely smitten and obsessed.  Since then a lot of hoppiness happiness has come into existence, but this is still a great beer, at least if you get it fairly fresh (...I've had bottles that are approx 3 month old, and they have been shadows of the real thing.)  Quite often, anymore, the melon notes really stand out to me and that is less than ideal, and definitely not the kind of bitterness I love.  Still, I find the flavor and mouthful profile to be fairly unique: I can pick it out, blind, when compared with almost any other IPA I've tasted."
""
"This is my favorite beer. And i would love to take a bath in it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really dislike the flavor, taste, after taste, smell.  I know it's a local favorite but not my bottle of beer, to much citrus or over hop taste."
""
""
""
"Seriously- so good. Believe the hype. Alcohol is so hidden by this tasty, not overally hoppy brew. Unique, delicious, and nooiiiiice. Try it, enjoy it, love it"
"Nice orange copper color with a 1/2"" head that lasted. The smell was at first a little biscuity but then the citrusy smells kicks in. The taste is initially of apricot to me but becomes hoppy with citrus flavors as it hits the back of the tongue. It's a nice tingle crisp feel."
""
""
"My favorite ipa at this time"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice cooper color with a 1 finger head that still lingers after a few sips. Nice hops on the back end. A very good IPA"
""
"Thick and soapy white head, sitting atop a golden liquid..a little haze...this brew is beautiful.  the smell is spectacular...fresh hops..incredibly floral and aerobatic.  Sweet smelling malt.  Balanced and intense.  Full bodied and rich.  This is one delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
"Rich golden color, thin head. Smells of citrus and mild hops. Perfect amount of carbonation. Slightly bitter with citrus taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply the most balanced IPA on the market! Hoppy for sure, but masterfully crafted to achieve what few do, & rivaled only by some Belgium's in masking the alcohol. Top notch! Great job Bell's!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4 days old from the brewer. This is a fantastic beer. One of my favorites."
""
"Beautiful golden orange color with a thick white head. Incredible floral aroma. Hops and citrus. One of the juiciest IPAs I have had, without being too bitter and without the sweetness of the malt backbone being too cloying. Grapefruit, tropical fruit. I even get some candied orange and extremely delicate caramel from the malt. Delicious. I could toss back a six pack and still want more."
"Good every day drinker for sure"
""
"Unmatched balance of malt supporting the hops. Great depth of flavors and aromatics which remain throughout length of taste and continuing with mouthful. Stands above all other APAs and never varies year after year."
""
""
"Floral hints with a crisp finish.. Amazing IPA."
""
"O: A very good IPA. Generously hopped and full of flavor."
"Just a great everyday IPA"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid IPA."
""
""
"Such a classic American IPA, a personal go-to. Perfect balance of hops to malt, not too sweet, not too bitter."
""

""
""
"love of mine"
""
""
""
""
""
"very malty"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really solid IPA - I just wish they would get the canned 4 packs out more regularly - it does seem to sit around here in Chicago, and it is such a shame - when fresh this is great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great beer, not to hoppy but just right with a great kick!"

"OK, I'm not much of a hophead. If anything, I lean towards the malt bombs. But Two Hearted IPA...damn! It is by FAR the most balanced & drinkable IPA I have had to date...& the best. it is also a bit dangerous because it hides its abv. REALLY well (got WAY too drunk off this the first time I had it). This is just a great beer though & I wish more brewerys would take a lesson from Bell's & make an IPA this balanced & smooth."

"Solid AmIPA. As fine as you'll get from the Mitten State. Not as floral as the West Coast class, with a bit more malt on the backend to ease away the bitter. Ernie Hemingway, a noted hard liquor swiller, might even have enjoyed this ale after a long day at his desk...."

"This is my go to IPA.  Always a consistent golden / orange with some haze.  Floral, citrus scent that builds the anticipation.  Taste of pine, citrus and sweet malt followed by a mellow bitterness.  Mouthfeel is perfect, coats the tongue and sticks around just long enough.  Overall, I am glad I can run down the block to pick up a 4 pack of cans whenever I want...think I will right now."

"Tasting notes of pine and grapefruit are present in this Ipa with an incredibly hoppy and piney armoa. Add a slight note off maltiness to balance the hops and you have  Bell's Two Hearted Ale.Very drinkable American IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"So, they don't warn you on the bottle, but I am  telling you this will not be good more than 1 month after the bottle date. I had one bottled from 10/ 21, which was perfectly floral and sweet, and drain poured one from 10/08 which had lost alot of what makes it great. This is an awesome IPA, and consume fresh, for the best experience."

"Taste is nice hop punch of bitter citrus and herb/floral notes. It is a solid I'd faint malt middle with some biscuit notes. Finishes dry with more bitter herb. It has some nice fruit notes and good lively carbonation that keeps the subtle complexities alluring."

"Hadn't had this in a while so I picked up a 4 pack of pounder cans at the Friendly Greek. I could smell it as soon as I opened a can and man does it taste great! Nice and smooth, easy to drink, no sense of it being a 7 percenter. If it wasn't so pricey (relative to Otter Creek's Overgrown) this could easily be my go-to beer (which is currently Overgrown, hence the reference). In my opinion, the best thing about this excellent beer is that I can get in half a dozen places within 5 miles of my home. In a world where availability and price counted as much as everything else, this would rank higher then Heady Topper."

"Overall: A deceptive beer. The aroma and mouthfeel belong to a wildly hoppy specimen with bright flavors, but the disappearing act of the bitterness hops and the overdose of malt in the finish throw things off balance. There are still many commendable elements, however, and the additional malt does add some nice complexity."

"Orange with Amber hues, tall white head, and tons of soapy like lacing.  Aroma hints of fruitiness and is full of citrus, pine and dank hops.  Big citrus and pine flavors, little fruity in the background, and a slight malt sweetness.  Medium body, crisp carbonation and a drying finish brings on some nice lingering bitterness.  This is a fantastic IPA.  Great value and one that I love to have around.  Side note, it reminds me of Lunch in a lot of ways."

""
"Update: The second time I had this it seemed to have a different profile. I got a bit more fruit forward flavor, and less malt, but the malt is still there. Maybe a 4.25 for me."

"This has become one of my favorite beers and by far my favorite ipa. It pours a cloudy orange as it is unpasteurized.  It has a small to medium head.  It has a crisp bitter flavor but that doesn't seem to interfere with its smoothness and drinkability. Sweet, earthy hints of citrus and pine balance out the bitterness making it easy to drink. It has a very strong and distinct smell. There is an inviting floral aroma with hints of citrus."

"Tasted like a poorly-made boiler-maker. I see the reviews here and I scratch my head and wonder why. Perhaps my beer tastes and expectations are too basic and backward. Could not wait for it to be gone. Each sip popped an intolerably sweet flavor in my mouth. It created nice internal warmth, but burned like a watered down shot of bourbon going down. Some have said the alcohol taste is missing, but it was the most prevalent taste/feel I could recognize. I am no expert, so I am not sure how much to trust my rating."

"This is a case where I have to wonder what all the fuss is about - are beer nerds just a bunch of lemmings? Two Hearted recently was launched here in NYC and I have heard and read about this beer for so long my anticipation was very high. All I can say is this tasted like a slightly above average Pale Ale. Not very hoppy, VERY SWEET (not a fan of that). Maybe since this beer came out the playing field has evolved greatly?"

"DATE REVIEWED: August 8, 2014... GLASSWARE: La Fin du Monde tulip... OCCASION: Happy 38th birthday, myself--with the fam, Jer and Matt...APPEARANCE: orange amber body; filmy and hazy; thick, white three-finger head; lacing extends upward and thickly spreads across the glass--a great start... AROMA: fruity and hoppy; apple and citrus first; some bubblegum yeasts too; lastly, some metallic suggestions... PALATE: fantastic, medium-bodied and arresting--effervescent and alive; an IPA to sip and simmer with--little suggestion of alcohol, but definitely weightier than a pint glass... TASTE: balanced caramel malts underpin a hop festival of Noble and citrus--tangy tangerine and teeth-rattling pine resin, a combo that shakes and soothes in unison--this is the IPA the beer folk warn us about...OVERALL: as IPAs go, a mecca of sorts--the hype is to be believed--and although there are many that rival Two Hearted, it is a beer I will seek out again, even if it's only found in a case at a PSU distributor, as this was; the name itself evokes that ""slow"" short story that nonetheless reveals so much of man's plight and hope, and this is a worthwhile stab at perfection...."

"This pours a hazy orange-amber with a modest head. Aroma has pine-resin with a hint of citrus hop notes. Flavor offers high bitterness up front with piney, flowery hop flavor, together with some sticky sweet malt, lightly caramel, and a pleasant yeasty fruitiness. Finish is actually a little sweet while still retaining hop taste. Fairly light bodied for the strength, but also a tad watery."

"I love to try different beers, and this one looked different, the strange fish on the logo had caught my attention more than once. I finally decided to give it a shot and i was not disappointed, this cloudy american ale really lived up to its name. Two hearts, because at first you hit with a strong hoppy flavor, and just when you think you know the exact aftertaste you're going to be hit with, it throws you a great aftertaste that you did not expect. I think this beer is outstanding and can not wait to have my friends try it."

"Final Grade: 4.3, an excellent A grade. Two Hearted Ale is a well-made IPA, though I'm still not sure if I'd consider this brew one of the best of its kind. I'm enjoying this glass and I'd certainly be willing to purchase more in the future, but this one just doesn't reel me in completely. Balanced and approachable, in the sense that it is not as absurdly bitter or heavy as this style tends to want to be. Very well-made; there is no denying that Bell's has concocted an awesome beer here that is well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: first off - totally prefer the bottle serving to the draft... great intensity of flavor after a month... this kinda sits at a nice little midway point between some of the hoppier bitters out of England and the mouth-slapping jolt of a West Coast IPA... heavy on the aromatics and flavor components here, though the bitterness isn't exactly weak"
""
""
""
"O: I know what you're thinking here... I scored this so highly in 3/4 of the categories, but the overall is under a 4... It's not that this beer isn't delicious, because it is. It's one of the freshest, no-frills IPAs that I've ever tasted, but when you consider it's popularity and sheer difficulty to acquire (it's oft-times sold out before I make it to the bottle shop), it's just not THAT good. If I stumble upon this again, I'd, without hesitation, pick up a pack of it, but it doesn't hold the ""WOW factor"" that'll put me in a craze to seek out this over some more readily-available IPAs."
""
""
""
"I've now had this in bottles (lots), cans (a few) and on tap (once) and I'd really say it shines on tap and in bottles. A gem if a bit expensive for a daily drink, and one of my favorite beers."

"T: Light tangerine and orange citrus, citrus florals, honeycomb, bready malts, salt water taffy. Slight piney tingly feeling reserved for final few seconds. Really almost no bitterness at all. The tart/sour phenomena is derived directly from the sweet fruits hop flavors, which perhaps compliment the soft graininess too well. This beer is maybe too 'fine', too 'well-adjusted', too 'balanced' for my liking that it comes across as blase. I'd like to call this an excellent blueprint for a foundation IPA."

"Comes along a slightly fruity and bready taste, but the star by far is the hops. Bold hop flavors come across boldly but not too much as to take away from the pale ale flavor that was expected. Good color and feels slight bitter on the palate but very pleasing. I rated this beer high because it is a well made, tasty beer. I agree that it should be on the top area of the beer ratings but don't take it too far, I've had better"
""
""
"Continuing its developing taste, the hops trend dry, resinous and smoothly bitter- resembling the taste of severed pine needles to and fro. With the hops outlasting the malts with ease, the finish is refreshingly dry and bitter with echoes of perfume in aftertaste."

"O-I have tried this beer on three occasions now and finally got around to doing a proper review. It still has yet to blow me away, but I can see why people like it. It drinks easy, but provides enough flavor to keep things interesting. Although not a session beer (at 7% ABV), I could drink a few of these without feeling overwhelmed."

"O: Was expecting a lot, and like this beer. Certainly stronger on the hops than I’d expected from the review I saw. I see the balance here, and representation of east coast style of ipa it is. To me it’s a little over hopped, but balanced and unique for that. I am burping pine and actually enjoying the overhoppiness- its growing on me! Would go well with spicy food and gorgonzola cheese."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Willy glass. Appearance is clear yellowish copper-apricot with a thin white head and decent lacing. Surprisingly, there was not as much hop aroma as I had expected from reading other reviews. Taste is nicely balanced bitterness with malty sweetness - probably could be described as ""sessionable"". Mouth feel is just right for the style. Overall a very fine IPA."

"I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to IPAs since I have so many great ones to choose from in my area and I love them dearly. That being said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale is one I'll never not have in my beer fridge (not for a lack of trying to drink them all). For me, its the perfect IPA, highly floral with light fruity notes and a strong hoppy attitude. The bitter bite isn't beastly like you may see with so many other IPAs (particularly those of lower quality) but rather justly emboldened. This is, to me, the pinnacle of craft IPAs with the correct addition of fruity and floral flavors (and smells), right between a boring hoppy beer or some bastardized fruit cocktail."

"O: This is one of my favorite IPA's. It doesn't overwhelm the palate with a dank bitterness but masterfully controls the bitterness while letting other flavors in the beer 'take a bow'. It's the closest thing I've found that I could consider a session IPA. I could drink a lot of this. Crisp and citrusy finish and the lasting aftertaste is that of a pleasant grapefruit and citrus hop, as it should be! Try this and you'll buy a lot of it."

"The pour produced a big, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. The nose had a great hoppy presence. The color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. The mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop bite on the palate. The finish lingered with hops. There was great lacing produced throughout. This is unquestionably one of my favorite American IPAs of all time."

"BOD 3/10/14. Slightly hazy light amber pour with a massive head. Excellent lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of citrus and dank hops - mostly tropical with grapefruit in the background. Light medium body which is modestly smooth in texture coupled with an above average carbonation level. The flavor profile is well balanced, but skewed towards citric bitterness, and complex. It begins with hop flavors, grapefruit over tropical, flows into a burst of dank hop flavor that yields itself to grapefruit rind bitterness and ends with a light biscuit sweetness. The finish has a bit of effervescence, is somewhat crisp yet also smooth. A moderate grapefruit rind bitterness lingers."

"Very impressed- more earth-tone bitter, should be marketed as a session beer: no real bitterness, and falls closely in a Pale Ale category with an IPA front! I would really like to find this on tap to better evaluate. This beer is more malty/sweet than citrus or hoppy, yet still floral. Drink more!"

"On-tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI. This pours a hazy amber color with a foamy off-white head. The aroma is mild with hops. The taste is smooth and easy drinking. Overall this is very well made and easy to see why this is one of the best beers for its style out there!"

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious IPA. Very full of flavor but light and refreshing. Much less malty than Sierra Nevada Celebration, which is the IPA I think of when I think Centennial hops. Overall, I like the more tropical fruit flavored IPAs (using Citra, Nelson Sauvin, Galaxy, now even Simcoe, etc), but this is very good nonetheless. If any negative, perhaps this is too one dimensional, but I believe this is a single hop IPA."

"Pours a medium dark copper. Not as orange as a Nectar Nugget but dark copper. No foam. Smells earthy. Tastes is solid with a subtle alcohol punch. Full bodied IPA. Not very citrus. Very piney. Enjoyable considering a I had low expectations. Would purchase again."

"Bells Two Hearted Ale (2014) - 7% ABV. When I stopped in at Casey's Beer & Soda (Pine Bush NY) the staff informed me about this bargain ($8 for a four pack) and how I possibly was missing the best beer out there if you like hops. That is a big rep to live up to... but Bells pulls it off. The moment you pop the top of the can you smell the piney goodness-- a hint of lilac and some citrus. Pours a solid amber with very active carbonation. Excellent head and lacing retention. The nose is pine nuts and coriander. A quick bite of malty barley and the sting of pine mark the mid-palate transition. Lingering malt and spice. Finishes crisp, dry, and some lemon bite. A bit of skunk lager notes but the copper ale note persists in the aftertaste. Full bodied with good crisp mouthfeel. The alcohol is subdued. This is very sessionable from a taste standpoint. Very mellow IPA flavor. Tastes like a ""baby war elephant"" or session IPA but that 7% is there-- proceed with care and respect the beer. Really good. Excellent for that matter. Welcome to the Top Ten list Two Hearted Ale. 4.5 out of 5."

"Bottle date 11/12/2014 so 60 days old. That's a little old for an ipa and maybe why this seems to have dropped off terribly. Pours an odd head that bubbles feverishly then dissipates quickly. Smells of garlic and onions, bitterness, resins. Taste is an off onion hop flavor. More and more challenging to drink as it gets to bottom. Had to drain pour."

"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer and an outstanding IPA. Expertly blended hops and malts make this a great session beer...just don't let that big ABV sneak up on you. This is a BIG beer, but the balance and structure make it a great beer just to have with a burger or pizza...anything really. I like to have my beer with a side of N2 O2...that's right just air. Anyway, this brew is great and definitely worth a purchase, but watch it...some stores charge up to $11+ for a six pack. Shop around and you should be able to get it for less than $10."

"O - a great IPA. Really like this. This would have paired really well with a lemon thyme panna cotta we used to serve at a restaurant I used to work at."
"This is just as good as any other IPA that is on the market right now, but this seems to just be exploding in popularity lately. There have been lots of great deals on this beer as well. It is very hoppy of course, but to me it has a slightly more florally flavor that other IPAs."

"Overall: This is my favorite go-to brew at the moment. Lately when trying IPAs I've been comparing them to this one just because I find it to be a very true, honest representation of what I think an IPA should be. Could easily be sessionable, but it is rich enough to leave you feeling satisfied after just one. Great to share with your friends. I could see this beer being a nice segue beer for a friend exploring the craft brew scene. It may be a bit hoppy for them, but if you want to introduce someone to what an IPA should be, I view this one as a solid standard in any hop heads repertoire."
""
"This is a very hoppy beer. Taste extremely hoppy which creates an equally hoppy aroma. This beer has a very unique story for bells brewery! A citrus and floral aroma frequent this beer with after notes of grapefruit. In appearance the beer appears cloudy... A caramel aroma characterized the beer"
"Very popular beer, especially in the Michigan college community. Strong hop scent and the hops are very apparent upon drinking. High levels of carbonation leave a tingling after taste. Hops are the only way I can describe this beer as it dominates the aroma and flavor."
"Very hoppy taste, but not overwhelming at all. Gives a bite that keeps you wanting more. The light mouth feels allows for easy drinking. The carbonation leaves a lingering tickle in your throat. But the hops do leave a slight after taste, probably the only downfall to the beer"
"Medium Coloring. Smells sweet like citrus. Once you drink it, it feels very light on your tongue. You can tastes the hops in this beer- very hoppy. Once you swallow this beer, your mouth will tingle and feel refreshed. Very good beer and popular in the college community"

"I flippin love this beer. Aroma is soft citrus/floral notes, but also somehow briny and evocative to me of the seashore or (as more appropriate for Michigan) a day out on the lakes. The mouthfeel is rather full-bodied for an IPA. Carbonation is not noticeable. Very little bitterness/dryness--just a faint note from the hops. What is amazing here is the beautiful balance between the malts and hops, and the easy drinkability that somehow highly rewards every sip. And again, I find this beer highly evocative--really reminds me of laid-back days in the great, wild outdoors. One of my favorite IPAs."

"ah, what a gem. it pours a beautiful golden, orange with a fluffy white head of creamy bubbles. the nose is so full of slightly over-ripe grapefruit and mango - citrus zest and a lots of over-ripe apricot. i could smell this all day. the taste follows the nose but it is bright and bursting with flavor (this bottle is about a month old - the freshest i've had it) - a nice sweet malt backbone that gives a candied grapefruit like taste. also some pineapple. a bit of piney-ness as well and a little bit of grassy/earthiness to it. it goes down super easy. all in all this is a gem. i love this beer and wish i lived near where it was distributed. it was one of the first ipa's i had and remains one of my favorites. really wonderful stuff."

"Overall- I think I did myself a great injustice by not checking the date on the bottle in the store. Normally with all the bombers I buy this is something I check. However, this one I purchased as a single 12 oz and it, obviously, had been sitting on the shelf a while. I believe this is a bottle conditioned beer as it had the hop residue and hazy appearance. I normally love this in a beer but this is an old IPA. No glory here. Overall it wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't living up to its potential and certainly drank/smelled more like a pale ale than an IPA. I was disappointed. If this is what it really tastes like than I would not willingly seek this out again. If I get a fresh one sometime I'll be sure to update my review to reflect my findings."

"Had this on tap at the Arena bar and grill in Wilkes-Barre, PA. Happy hour drafts $3 and that includes micros and imports! They gave me a 10oz pour in a goblet. Having just finished a souther tier Choklat(also $3), it took a few sips to clear that rich and flavorful beer out of my palette and when it did, boy was I excited. Hops, not as much as in Hopslam(my only other experience with Bell's)which was to be expected, hit the nose and the tongue in perfect balance. An incredibly drinkable and savorable IPA. I grabbed a six pack the next day and look forward to my next one. One other thing, the draft menu at the Arena had this listed as 5.3% ABV, it's actually 7%."

"Poured 12 ounces into my tulip glass, quite fresh as it was bottled on 6/10/14. 1/2 finger of creamy white head disappeared quickly. However, the golden amber hue of this beer was quite impressive. Aroma of pine and light lemon zest. Hit me with a strong piney/grassy opening note. Very clean and refreshing with a pronounced bitter finish. The light carbonation lent to a bit of a watery mouthfeel, though pretty par for the IPA course. Overall, the only thing I felt that was lacking in this well-balanced, refreshing brew was a bit more of the citrus hop flavor. This would have bumped it up even higher that my great rating. Interested to try this on tap, extremely fresh one day. Excellent IPA."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Hazy orange color with 1/2” of head that recedes to a soapy film on top, with some lacing on sides. Nose is orange juice, grapefruit, slight bitterness with some pine notes- mostly citrus. Little to no alcohol detected. Taste is citrus (on the mellow side, not extremely bitter) with some sugary malt backing and floral notes. Hops gradually coat the tongue, but not with as bitter a finish as other American IPAs. Medium carbonation, somewhat creamy texture. Medium-bodied with a nice balance. Overall this is a tasty IPA with understandably wide appeal."
"overall: every time i drink this beer I am reminded why this is one of the best examples of an IPA. Really well balanced, drinkable, and something new to enjoy each time you drink it."

"Overall: This beer has been my go to for a while now and probably wont change anytime soon."
"O: Very good, and in all honesty, its one of my favorites of the style. The bitterness isn't overbearing and is very well balanced. Quite smooth and session-able. If you want to try a good IPA, then check this one out."

"I tried this beer years ago and, at the time, found it completely overpowering. As the years have passed and I've been able to sample more and more, I've come full circle. I can now appreciate this beer, and it's hops, for what it is...and excellent IPA."

"O- This is a real solid high quality IPA, would go back to this with regularity."

"Overall: This is one of my go to IPA's. It's very clean, refreshing, and drinkable yet all the flavors and aromas are there. I put this right next to my favorites in the style, and right under my current favorite (Head Hunter). Most likely because I can regularly find both of these within a couple weeks of bottling, but fresh is key! Highly recommended!"
"This is my go to beer. One of my top 3 beers. Pours a radiant gold color that has a slight haze. Aroma I'd complex and enticing, a blend of sweetness, maltiness, fruitiness, and hoppiness, none of them overwhelming yet somehow each being strong and distinct. Taste does not disappoint, it is amazingly smooth throughout, making it hard to not down a whole glass quickly. Thick feel on the pallet. Hint of citrus tickles the tongue while the malt opens and promotes Itself. Good down smooth, leaving a mild hint of hops. Always makes you want more."
""
"Golden honey pour with nice white sticky head. Smell lacks with alcohol notes and dome sticky hop resin. Taste and feel great. Sweet honey, molasses but smooth and not overly sticky. Easily will drink again"

"Honestly, though not as good as Hopslam, it is very comparable and will satisfy you. On top of the that, it's half the price and easy to find. For the price alone, I feel it is a much better value than Hopslam, as Hosplam is only marginally better than two-hearted. Two Hearted is a very enjoyable IPA."
""
"Overall I consider it solidly above average. I like it but always find myself wishing it had a little more to offer in the flavor and body."

"reading the bottle after my review i agree that this is well suited to an adventure to the UP. it might even be my first choice if making that trek. the iron aftertaste seems to taste like the stream water from that area. not at all a bad thing."

"O: A great IPA, I'm glad I got the chance to try this. Can't wait for Bell's to enter MD."
"O: This is a solid AIPA, definitely a contender for one of my favorites. Eloquently combines all elements that compose your ideal AIPA. Juicy style that is both refreshing and enjoyable to sip. I’m a big fan of the tropical fruit profile and centennial holds it down in my opinion. Winner."

"This is my favorite beer. It was the first IPA I ever loved. I've tried many other great ones since, but this one remains the best for me. There's something about IPAs in general and this one in particular, that reminds me of a bug repellent we used as kids at the beach in Maine (and I mean that in the best possible way). When I smell this and then taste it, I'm taken back to the sounds of summer, the feel of soft white sand on my feet and the ocean breeze on a beautiful summer day, late afternoon."

"O: Awesome IPA I'd recommend to anyone who favors hops but is looking for a beer they could have several. It's bitter enough but not drying the way some overly hopped beers tend to get. Worth the bucks I spent on it this eve and I look forward to trying it off a tap in a few months."

"It's cloudy, but not a sexy cloudy like Switchback. It's not too hoppy, but a little too sweet. LIke other Bell's, it's very very good, but not quite as good as the hype. I have yet to try a Bell's that I thought was in the league of the best I've ever had, and this one continues that pattern."

"O: glad I finally tried this. Readily available even down in FL and decent for the price. Personally I'm not that in to floral and wheaty-type IPA's, but this was a good one."
"O - It's taken me a long time to get my hands on this beer, only because it requires a 30+ minute drive to Iowa in order to pick some up. With this being barely over a month old, I can say this beer does live up to the hype! I'll be getting more for sure!"

"poured into a wine glass. typical beige i.p.a head that doesnt stick around to much. pours a slightly hazy light amberish brown. this beer smells of citrus so strong. definatly an orange note but not as strong as hopslam. the taste however is grapefruit bitterness with a nice cereal or bread type backbone present after each sip. medium bodies mouthfeel typical to the style. overall you can see smell and taste where the idea for hopslam came from. great beer will definatly buy again!...cheers!"

"The brew that always goes down smooth, converted my girl to an IPA fan, and never leaves me disappointed. Citrusy, perfectly carbonated, prominent but friendly bitterness derived from the centennial hops, pleasant aroma. It is really tough to come up with any negatives for this one, and tough to stop drinking it as well! Although I am a huge fan of high IBU IPAs and IIPAs now, this is the one that seeded my passion for hoppy brews to begin with. Easily one of my favorites."

"Taste is just what I want in a beer. Easy to drink, no lingering bitterness."
"Clear golden under a thin white cap of head. Nose is wonderful with earthy grassy hops, and a bit of floral resin, atop a nice caramel sweetness. Smooth and full balanced flavor, with gentle caramel biscuity sweetness, light bitterness, a touch of grass, a little floral resin, and a kiss of grapefruit rind. A wonderfully balanced and tasty brew that’s tantalizingly easy to drink down."

Perfectly hopped for those of us that don't particularly enjoy the IPA's on the market that are part of what I like to call the ""hops for hops sake"" fad in today's craft beer world. Bell's Two Hearted doesn't overpower your taste buds with bitterness, but that doesn't mean it is lacking in flavor. Just outstanding!"

"Overall - 7% ABV? Sure don't taste like it! This one is subtle, fresh, strikes a killer balance of hops and malt, and finishes really clean. Unlike most IPA's that send you wave upon crashing wave of hop flavor and bitterness, this one drinks so easy that its 7% ABV will sneak up on you if you're not careful. A great choice both as an introductory IPA and an everyday brew."

"This is the first beer I'm redoing my review on. I had a 4.25 at first but that was when I was first getting into IPAs. This is a staple."

"I have had this beer on tap, but right now its out of a bottle. And just as good I might add. Open the bottle and its like you stepped into a hop field. Pours nice with a decent sticky head. Nice lacing throughout the drink. Floral, citricy, piney- its got it all, but I beleive its centennial? Correct me if Im wrong. Anyway, it tastes soooo fresh, freshest beer I have had in a long time, Im loving it. I dont know about drinking this all day long as I already have a buzz after 2. This is just a fantastic hop lovers dream. I love this beer, Bells is by far one of my favorite breweries. Mouthfeel is just under perfect, as it is light. But othe than that its VERY hard to do better than this beer. Outstanding. Love it."

"Very hard to find on tap outside of the northern midwest. I find very little difference between the bottled and draught examples I have tried, and I have tried many."

"O: There are so many quality factors you can feel as you drink this beer. It just stands way above quite a few beers and I'll definitely enjoy drinking this beer!"
""
""
""
"Pours a darker golden color. Darker than most IPAs. Thick off white head. Aroma is a bit light. Citrus, pine, a little tropical fruit. Tastes mostly of citrus and malt. The pine and tropical fruit doesn't come out in the taste very much. The bitterness is balanced out pretty well by the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than other IPAs. Not bad though. Overall, I was expecting way more from this brew after hearing so much about it. Just your average IPA with nothing special really. I really wanted to love this beer but sadly it just didn't live up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice golden yellow color. Can't really say much about the head since I drink it out of the bottle (very drinkable). Floral and fruity nose, but not too strong. Flavors are very well balanced. You can definitely taste the hoppy backend but it's very well balanced by the sweeter/breadier hops flavors. Good for people getting into beer."
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable standby for most. Nothing mind blowing but it's hard to find a major fault with this beer."
"O - Happy to find a random single of a Top 250 beer at my favorite local store. Not as flavorful or powerful as some other IPA's, I might put it on the Pale Ale/IPA fringe. But the flavor is excellent, lot's of hops and a strong matl backbone. Highly recommended to any IPA or Pale Ale fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not an IPA lover by any means. In fact, I am allergic to the hops as my head stuffs up almost immediately after the first few sips of drinking an IPA. But, the label didn't identify itself as an IPA, only in the verbiage on the back label did I discover its pedigree. So, in fairness, I would have to say in this review that this is one of the better IPAs I've tasted, although I would have initially skipped it if I had known it was an IPA! Very cool artwork on the label, too."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoy this beer, and there's no doubt for me that I will be returning to it as a regular staple. I am a huge fan of grapefruit notes and the hops that make those possible, but this makes the case for other citrus themes from the hop. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - one of my favorites. Nothing obnoxious or mind blowing just keep drinking this and you will never grow tired or bored of."
""
"O: This one was built up in my mind from things that friends had said, and it did not disappoint, which is quite noteworthy. So often beers are overhyped and disappointing."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a green flash tulip. Lovely light straw color. Nice head and retention. Smell is amazing. Citrus, citrus and more citrus. Orange peel, grapefruit. Just an amazing smell. I think they should make a perfume that smells like this beer. Taste is just soooo good. Citrus, hops, maybe a little pine. Awesome, awesome beer. This should be a staple in every hop heads collection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had this out of the bottle once and it was really good. This is my first review of it and I was very unimpressed. Its not bad, but it isn't the world class IPA I had anticipated. My bottle is two months old, but I wouldn't think that this would degrade that quickly. I will be reviewing this when I find some fresh."

""
""
""
""
"O-America's IPA. All the ingredients are harmonious and deliver realistic fresh flavors. I feel like I'm eating into a juicy orange soaked in malt all drizzled in pine oil. Two Hearted Ale is not only the benchmark for IPA, but the bar that is not surpassed. Less than a handful of IPA's MATCH it, (Sculpin is one). The malt backbone makes my own straighten up and take notice of it's greatness. I'm honored at the availability of this sessionable IPA. Weird, but I cheers to a beer. Thanks for being, you."
""
""
"Overall: Two Hearted Ale has always been a favorite of mine of the IPA style but this batch is probably the freshest BTHA that I've come across. Well balanced and enjoyable. This one is a benchmark example of the AIPA style. Simply delicious and highly recommended, especially when introducing someone to the world of IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is one of the smoothest IPA's I have ever tried. As stated earlier, it wasn't insanely bitter but the hop prescence was more than evident. A high quality brew for sure that is full of flavor. It was so smooth it was as if it came off a tap, however this sample was from a bottle. For an IPA fan, it would be hard topping and a must try. Besides the great taste, it is an awesome beer with a trout on the label!"
"O- This is a great ""My First IPA!"" beer for a budding young beer connoisseur because it's fucking delish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The roasted malt flavor is up front. The brew ends with a smooth semi sweet bitterness. This is not a bad beer. It has a good malt grain base, but its missing that “umph” in flavor that would make it a great beer."

"We all know that two hearted is one of the benchmarks against which other American ipas are judged and for good reason. It is super smooth, clean, and simple. This ale Pours a gorgeous hazy Orange color with a medium head that dissipates to a lasting lacing. The aroma is pure citrus with notes of grass and very fresh on the nose. It Sips smooth but a little chewy due to the beers unfiltered quality. The flavor is bitter on the front end and malty on the rear. It is very fresh and refreshing and balanced. This is an excellent example of an American ipa. It stands along side of 60 Minute, Centennial, and Stone as dome of the finest ipas produced today. Grab a bottle and enjoy....I may even open another."

"It’s been too long since I’ve had a damn fine IPA. So, let’s have a damn fine IPA. Two Hearted Ale pours a hazy dull copper with half a finger or less of foamy white head that's quick to dissipate. Loads of citrus and pine hops on the nose. Herbal and earthy in the hop profile as well. Simple, clean and... whatever the smell equivalent is for ""tasty."" A very hop forward brew, no doubt, but the balancing power of its smooth malt backbone cannot be overstated. The finish has hints of citrus, lingering malt and then a swooping bitterness comes in to wipe the palate clear. Exquisite. Goes down way too smooth for its 7% ABV."

"Pours a light gold color. Hoppy and pleasant to the nose. A little watery at first but it finishes like an IPA. This is a relatively cheap beer so I would recommend it for a craft beer enthusiast on a budget. It's a solid IPA. It won't blow you away. It lacks complexity and feels a bit watery, but for the price, it's a good buy."

"Perhaps my two month old bottle lost a bit of its hop flavor but this was way less hoppy than i was expecting from the reviews. Imo this is a very balanced beer. Not on the hoppy side one bit. With that said, its still a tasty easy drinking beer. Unfiltered so keep that in mind. Id drink it again. Hopefully on tap and fresh."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. About a half-inch of head that didn't last and decent lacing. This is a well-balanced beer that isn't overly bitter. Lots of hop citrus that gives way to a slightly metallic aftertaste. The metallic aftertaste becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Overall a very good beer that I would gladly buy again."

"poured from a bottle into a chilled pint glass. cloudy amber color with a medium head that receded quickly. mixture of streaks and light lacing on the glass. Smells of strong pine, lemon and grapefruit, like expected. I could literally smell it as soon as I cracked the seal. Citrus taste with a hint of malt and wheat bread. Slightly bitter and crisp finish. Light and tingly carbonation. Very balanced, drinkable brew. You can knock a few of these back with no problem. Terrific IPA that will be a staple of my beer stash."

"Pours a clear minimally slightly hazed light yellow amber with white head that sticks around and laces. Sweet floral hop aromas,some sense of the citrus and earthy pine undertones. Flavors of hoppy tropical fruit and citrus leading to earthy piney florals a quick sense of bready malt into a pronouncedly bitter finish that coats and lingers,very enjoyable and drinkable wish could get more than one. An alcohol element emerges as I drink adds some nice spice to this. Very good satisfyingly bitter American IPA."

"Overall: This beer has been around awhile and was probably a favorite among hopheads before the hop craze. Now this beer tastes one-dimensional, unbalanced, and simple. In a world with more than enough IPAs, this probably isn't the accomplished beer that it once was, but it's still good."

"Finally had this after a distant acquaintance of mine, Chris, have one to me. I have had such good things about Bells that is made seeing Chris again somewhat worthwhile. Overall this was a good beer. Had it in a bottle, and pours a very clear golden clot with little head. It smelled overly smokey to me for some reason. Not that hoppy to me but was a pleasant blend of malt and hops. A decent carbonated beer. I liked this but wasn't wowed... Hate to go against the mass opinion, but just a good beer"

"O- Overall, this is a solid offering in the IPA style. It's fairly priced and it's finally available in my area in upstate New York. Before two weeks ago, I have never seen this beer before. I know this beer has been rated more times than any other IPA on this site, but honestly I don't see why. The American IPA is the top dog on the craft beer scene. Every brewery makes an IPA. Some make several. There are many many IPA's to choose from out there. Thousands. What makes this beer stand out from the others? I think it tastes pretty above average, but like I said, it's one dimensional. There's not a lot of depth. It is good. I could place it in my top ten IPA's, but it definitely wont fall in my top five. To me this doesnt live up to the hype."

"Overall this lives up to the rating and the hype. Living on the West Coast I am use to the West Coast style IPA but this is a refreshing turn from the smack in your face grapefruit/hop explosion.

Honored to try this gem and happy to sing it's praises."

"For me, this is the gold standard of IPAs. A revelation when I first tried it years ago, and still a reliable top-tier tap choice despite the massive increase in quality local competition throughout the country. There's a reason it has become as popular as it has without a ton of marketing money behind it. Complex, balanced, gorgeous Centennial nose — perfect for anything from a single bottle to a few pints."

"The Bell's Two Hearted IPA is a decent beer. It pours a hazy golden with thick white head that is lacing. The scent carries fresh pine with slight bitter citrus. The taste starts a very slight bitter then sweetens with the malt used. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a sessionable IPA."

"Good looking beer, muted orange, looks rich but not hazy, decent head with some outstanding lacing.  Smell jumps out at you, the citrusy orange stands out.  And the flavor is similar, orange stands out but there is some grapefruit and you notice the malt, and the bitter is not overwhelming.  Outstanding IPA"

"On tap at Coopers Seafood House, Scranton, PA. Nice clear golden color, with a half-inch head, nice lacing. Smell was tropical fruity and some grapefruit. Taste was wonderfully balanced, with some fruity, some piney flavors. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, the kind of beer that you want to drink all day, the alcohol was well hidden for 7%. Just an outstanding beer, wish I could find it all the time in CO."
""
""
""
""
"O - Can't believe I haven't had this beer in awhile... starting drinking a few years ago before I really became exposed to the world of craft beers and thought it was phenomenal then. Got wrapped up in trying different IPAs and DIPAs and lost track of this gem. This beer is always a solid win and competes well even with limited releases seasonals. Also, gets high marks for being widely available. Highly recommended and good year round."
""
""
"This brew is complex and rewarding. There are a few minor areas of imbalance and imperfection, but the blend of flavors and (especially) compelling scents make this one worth many happy returns."
""
""
"Two Hearted is still a standard-setting IPA, even though the exclusivity factor has dropped. When Bell's was still avoiding distribution in Illinois, we would drive to Indiana to hunt this down. Now it's in my grocery store, usually on sale (Dominick's needs to seriously rethink discounting this one). Fairly light in color, it's more of a yellow than an amber or an orange. Well carbed, you can stir it up to maintain a nice, foamy white head throughout your session. Lots of orange up front and hops in the back. It's hoppy enough for a hob head like me but won't offend."

"Perhaps the classic American IPA. Great looking with lovely grapefruit nose. Taste is similar, though not quite as bold with the citrus quality. A nicely balanced malt backbone and a rather creamy mouthfeel. This is a really great IPA, no longer as unique as it once was. I really believe that it's even better on tap than in a bottle. On tap, for some reason, every characteristic improves noticeably."

"Pours a slightly hazy golden color, with just a hint of orange. Medium off-white head that leaves massive, rocky lacing as it travels down the glass. Smells of fresh apricot and lemongrass. Taste begins with a big grapefruit rind flavor, followed by a light crackery malt middle. After that is some great citrus flavors, tangerine and grapefruit being the primary. The finish is super dry and piney. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall an outstanding IPA, super dry with massive citrus flavors make this one of my all time favorite IPAs."

"Poured into tulip; slightly hazy orange-gold with a fluffy white head, very nice lacing. Smell is muted bready malts balanced very nicely with sweet floral and fruity notes, as well as some yeast scents. Taste is incredibly well balanced; it starts out with smooth subdued malt, buttery flavors and herbal/citrus/bitter hops all blend together in a delicious orgy of flavor. 7% isn't noticeable at all, I'd be tempted to session this one all day. Overall I'm a bit underwhelmed, but such is the case with probably almost any super-hyped beer."

"Drinking this old reliable on tap at World of Beers. This is one of the classic, all-time American IPA's. Pours a nice, golden color with a 1 inch foam head. Intense citrus hops dominate in this one, unbelievably strong grapefruit flavor. Smells of citrus hops as well. On tap or in the bottle, it's really good. Cheers!"

"O: I was expecting a lot more since everybody is always comparing IPAs to this and they say it is one of the best. It is good but it almost seems too balanced, like I wish that there was something that jumped out at me flavor-wise. I don't what it is, but it just seems quite plain for an IPA. I love IPAs, but it was almost a chore to finish this one."

""
"Two hearted is pretty solid. It is a clear gold color. Smells hoppy and is pretty darn smooth for an IPA. It has a decent head and there was a lot of lacing in the glass. It has a slightly sour aftertaste. Sounds unpleasant but it is really good. this beer also made my mouth tingle all over."

"Overall: An IPA that is very easy to like. The hops are noticeable, but not assertive, placing it in another category from the unpalatable hop bombs that are in vogue. Lacks the malt I've been searching for, but is a complex beer nonetheless. Well recommended, and possibly my new favorite IPA."

"O- Trying to be as objective as possible with this one, but in all honesty, I just love this beer! It is incredibly drinkable; I could easily drink 3-4 of these in the time it takes me to drink some other IPAs. The flavors of the centennial hops dominate, but there is enough malt to back it up. In addition, the finishing gravity of this beer makes for an easy drinking beer that doesn't fill you up."

"12oz bottle. Pours a burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is piney grapefruit with some malts. Not really aromatic. Taste is a nice tingly pine hop bite followed by some juicy grapefruit. Pretty noticeable malt presence. Very well balanced. Medium bodied with a tingly amount of carnonation. Oily mouthfeel. Not an in your face hop bomb but a good marriage of hops and malts. I think its been said before but this reminds me a bit of Racer 5. Overall, solid IPA for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the best IPA's I've had. I love the centennial hops and the nice balancing act with the malt and hops. Perfect if you don't like overly bitter IPA's and would like a more citrusy example. It's from the Midwest but seems like it should be from the Pacific NW. I could drink these for quite a while."

"O- The beauty in this beer lies in its drinkability in relation to the ABV. It's subtle in the best way and actually quite sessionable. An American classic."
"In South Carolina on vacation and popped into my favorite beer spot...Newton Farms at Kiawah Island! Found two hearted, which I can't find in Denver, so I snatched it up! I really like this beer, but I have a beef...the six pack says unfiltered, but there is nothing to suggest this beer is unfiltered (I want to see some sediment). Really good beer, but gives me new appreciation for Bear Republic's Racer 5!"
"Overall, I'd take this any day that the weather is over 65. Man, I never thought I'd say that about ANY IPA. Kudos, Bell's."

"My favorite from Bell's. If I am in a bar or restaurant that carriers this , bottle or keg, iThis always my choice. Usually that's what I drink for the remainder of the stay. It's an easy drinking hoppy ale, not as bitter as many imperials or IPAs. There are citrus note but they're not overwhelming."

"The smell was sweet and floral, but the taste had some bite. What at first drink felt light and acidic, the mouthfeel soon grew to exhibit major hoppiness and lingering carbonation on the tongue. Didn't mind the strong floral notes because of the palate cleansing aftertaste. Definitely found a good summer IPA and proved to myself, with Bell's, you really can't go wrong."

"Overall: Every time I try Two Hearted, I wonder why I don't have a constant stock in my minifridge (maybe because all my income goes to peanut butter and ramen). Arguably the best IPA in the Midwest market. I would love to compare this beast to other renowned IPAs, like Heady Topper and the pair of Plinys."
"O- A homerun from Bell's brewery."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its blend through the flavoring. Every mouthful showcased a beautiful collaboration of solid sweetness of fruit, brightly citric and deeply spicy herbal hoppiness, and a clean, crisp malty backbone. You would get sugars here, sours there, earths way over there, and freshness everywhere. You were given consistency of quality, but with refreshing “newness” with each gulp. The nose was pleasantly fresh as well, and its best quality was its spicy hoppiness. The mouth was soft, helping ease the drinkability in spite of the more bittered and sour grassy hits of malts every now and again. This is a quintessential “third coast” IPA, giving bitterness from the west, even malty sweetness and freshness from the east, and offering a beer that would pair with just about any occasion."

"Pours a translucent gold color with roughly two fingers of foamy, pure-white head. Medeocre retention, but phenomenal lacing. The aroma is of spicy, earthen hops, pine, orange, and grapefruit. There's some wet earth and a bit of grass, as well as some subtle floral notes. Perhaps a hint of caramel malt to round things out. It tastes of lemon, grapefruit, and orange citrus up front, with spicy, almost gritty hops following suit. Some earth, grass, and even a touch of coriander appear, and a tiny amount of sweet caramel finishes it off. The mouthfeel is light (but not watery), vibrant, and bitter. It finishes clean and doesn't linger any longer than desired. Overall, this is a great, well-rounded IPA that is easy to drink and full of flavor. It does a great job of showcasing aromatic, flavoring, and bittering hops all in one, and is one I'm happy to frequent."

"Overall - It's not bad, but it's also not great. It seems like it can't make up its mind. The malt is a bit dull and sour without being creamy, which takes center stage over the lack of hops. I realize that this is a high-rated brew and that others like it, but I simply was not one of them."

"o: had been looking forward to trying this for a while (since the last time i passed it up). a little let down that the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as strong or sweet BUT this is still a really good beer. if you're like me and enjoy the maltier pale ales/IPAs then definitely give this one a try, your palate will thank you."

"O - Another case where I'm just not a fan of the IPA style, but I can tell it's a good one. If you like IPAs you'll love Two-Hearted Ale."
"Poured a nice cloudy amber color, with very little head. Standard IPA appearance but quite well done. Scents of malt, slight pine and slight citrus. Flavors are a nice balance of pine, pine resin, slight floral notes and very, very slight grapefruit and grapefruit pith. There is a strong malt backbone as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a resinous feel and moderate carbonation. It's a very good IPA, with a character different from the West Coast style I am used to, which makes it a nice change."
""
""
""
"Note - the beer was bottled 2-26-13 (today is 5-2-13). Yeah, Raul can only fantasize about what could be..."
""
""
"Wow! Everyone that's ever raved about this beer was right about it's greatness. I wish I could have brought six packs of this home. I really don't need to finish with a huge closing statement about this beer. As someone who's just started homebrewing and a huge fan of hops when they're pervasive in a beer but not grating, and also with beers that strive to find so much balance and use such fresh ingredients - which many brewers fail to do with IPAs - this really is one of the hop masterpieces of this country. I hate to add so much to the hype, but find fresh batches of this and drink it on tap whenever you have the chance. If always this consistent, this is probably the best IPA brewed year-round in the country. And with that, I leave myself in mountains of hops and joy. My favorite beer I had on my trip to Chicago. One of my new favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a hop bomb, not a malt bomb: the end result is a nicely balanced IPA without any booziness. There is a subtleness to Two Hearted Ale that makes it very palatable and a smooth, easy one to drink. Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful beer. It's spot on for the style, and I love drinking this beer whenever I get the chance. I'm glad to have finally reviewed this one."
"Overall: I am not a huge fan of IPA's in general so I tried to be unbiased in my review. It tasted a bit less strong than some of the other IPAs I have tried so, for someone who doesn't typically like IPAs, it is not bad at all."
""
"O/D - A delicious IPA. Very sessionable and the ABV is well hidden. I could drink this one all day."
""

"Aroma & Taste: You'll love this if you're a hop head. Strong hop notes. Starts hoppy with a long finish that has some sweetness at the end. Herb notes and pine, possible grapefruit notes at the end giving it a slight sweetness. Overall though, it's hoppy and bitter."
""
""
""
"The aroma is overwhelmingly hoppy! Notes of pine and hop are pretty much the only distinguishable scents. However, I was a bit disappointed when the beer wasn't as bitter as it smelled like it was going to be. It seems like the bark was worse than the bite. The finish was clean and hoppy. I'm not generally a fan of the IPA style, with it's overt hoppiness, but this one was done in an exceedingly balanced way, that made it a joy to drink."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 3/12/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, slight pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes; with well balanced malt. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Moderate floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and light honey on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of hop flavors; with a great malt balance that still showcases the hops; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! Great balance and good complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- hype for this beer is now understood. Two hearted is not a hops assault. It's a delicious balanced ipa that is not often achieved this deliciously. Pine, citrus, tropical fruit...

"As I write I'm enjoying this beer. I poured it into a snifter glass. The color is a nice, kind of a golden orange color. Had a wonderful amount of carbonation.

"A cool little story: A few years ago a few buddies of mine were backpacking Isle Royale (Island in Lake Superior, Northern Michigan) and we met 2 guys from Germany who came to canoe the island. The only store on the island, which included a mini restaraunt, just happened to stock only bells beer, and a huge selection of it. We met them in a campground near the lodge and they had just bought a case of Oberon and 2 six packs of Two-Hearted. Their english wasn't very good, but they basically said that American beer is shit compared to Germany (and grudgingly Belgium), except that Two-Hearted and Oberon (probably due to Germans fondness for wheat beer) are both some of there favorite beers, ever. I thought that was pretty cool, Germans having mad respect for some local MIchigan Craft Brew."

"O - west coast ipa's punch you in the mouth with a big hop profile and an ibu # through the roof. English styles give you a dose of malt and settle for less than what a hop head really needs. It seems to me some of these real good Midwestern/Great Lakes area breweries knock it out of the park when talking a sit down and drink, everyday IPA. This one is a prime example of what this specific region does better than anyone and it's a hallmark creation of what Bell's does best. Anyone looking for that go to IpA when say the next BIG seasonal hasnt quite hit the shelves then this is the one. Plus there is a freaking fish about to be slayed by some Midwesternman after a hard days work. No he's not shown, but you can imagine. This is one fish everyone needs to catch. It's good stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was not too impressed with this IPA. It smells good but taste didn't do it for me. It may have something to do with the bottle being two months old. When I get a much fresher bottle, I'll edit my review. That is, if it's any better."
""
"The beer pours a golden orange, with a finger width head made of small tightly packed bubbles. The beer leaves a lacing of tightly packed bubbles that form a sticky curtain on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body is a cloudy haze, and a steady stream of bubbles can be seen racing up the glass. On the nose, the beer smells pungently citrusy with nice spicy notes of pine. The malt base of the beer is light and bready with a touch of spice, but nearly nonexistent on the nose. Orange peel citrus is the big player in the nose, and is nicely inviting. On the tongue the beer tastes bitter with a touch of sweet acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes of bitter medicinal hops with touches of citrus orange peel. The finish is strong with caramel bready malts with touches of spice. The aftertaste lingers with bitter hops and light orange citrus. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a light velvety carbonation. The mouth is left clean with a bitter dryness lingering on the tongue. Overall this is a solid IPA with some nice orange citrus hops. It is not the best I’ve had, but it is solid and tasty. If it’s in your area, you should try this beer."
""
""
"This beer is super sweet right up front, then bitter on its way down. The citrus is really the focal point in the taste. Very refreshing. This is a beer that is good all year long. If its hot, cold, or somewhere in between I could always go for one of these. It is medium in bodied but still light enough to have a couple or more. Price point is reasonable, right at or a little above ten dollars. For a beer that I can pick up at any grocery store it is hard to beat."

"This is the best IPA I have tasted to date. It is everything I want in this style of brew. It has balance, hops and subtle malts working together to form a hoppy sweet taste without overwhelming your senses. It hides the 7%abv well with great flavors. I have a new friend today. I am very happy with this purchase."

"Pours up clear honey golden color. Nice white head with decent lacing. Nose is honey, pale malts, citrus hops. Taste is the same, not very bitter. I coulda sworn this beer was a little tastier back in the day. Still good sessional brew tho. Medium body and med carbo"

"O: I know this is the quintessential go-to beer for a lot of BAs here, but I just don't get it. I think part of it is that it's classified as an IPA, but I found it much too timid to earn that title. If it were labeled as an APA, I'd probably rate it quite a bit higher. I can't say this isn't a ""good"" beer and very well made, but it didn't really impress. It did drink smoothly and if the ABV were quite a bit lower, it would make a nice session beer, but it really didn't live up to my expectations for an IPA."

"Overall, this is one of the standout IPAs from west Michigan. To me, it seems a bit more similar to east coast IPAs like Dogfish Head's 60 and 90 minute varieties, and is a nice change from the over-the-top hop-bombs that are so common with this style. Smooth mouthfeel and subtle flavors make this an excellent IPA."

"Had this on draft when i was visiting my family out of state and i was blown away this is a very well balanced ipa one of the best ipa's ive had to date i reccomend everyone trying it if you can get a hold of it...they dont sell it around my area but my goal is to get my hands on hopslam...i was very impressed with the two hearted ale !"

"A remarkable beer, a way to show how to make an assertive American IPA without bombarding you with hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"While not a bitter or brash IPA as many would expect, this is a classic. Its sweetness puts it in a league of its own, I think. Absolutely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hop is fresh tasting, providing a black pepper finish. Starts with a clean ""round"" pale malted barley flavor. Only a touch of sweetness. Full bodied and a below average level of carbonation. Good counterpoint to hot wings."

"O: I was expecting a bit more from Bell’s since the reviews are through the roof on this. The smell is off the hook but the taste is average. Might get again if no other IPA on shelf is better, but doubt it."
""
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."

"O- This is a great beer. I could imagine serving this at a bar-b-que or a party. It seems to appeal to a lot of people and its not too overwhelming of an IPA. My wife also enjoys this one. For such a drinkable beer the 7% ABV is surprising and can sneak up on you!"

"With all that said, one glass is about all I can muster here. It ain't sessionable or quaffable, but it's darn fine. I'd almost like to have it with some spicy Indian food just to see how the sweetness holds up"
""
"M: Acually tasted thin...which is too bad considering this is a supposed legend if IPAs. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty, but it left me thinking there was a bit of water in the glass before pouring. I need to try it against other IPAs side-by-side. Left my palate clean without overstaying its welcome."

"Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass a clear, light golden yellow in color beer, nice 2 finger, foamy head with long retention, nice lacing all down the glass as I drank and solid carbonation that lingers. Aroma is dominant hops, like when I open a package to add to my homebrews. Taste is a nice blend and balance of hops & citrus without either being over dominant. Smooth & silky mouthfeel makes it so easy to drink. Excellent beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer. This could be my favorite IPA. It's aggressive and hoppy, yet drinkable and balanced. This is what an American IPA should be, given the stylistic description and my personal opinion. I should keep a case of this around just to keep my taste buds used to it. Great for those days when work sucked and you need a beer to punch you in the face, yet keeps you coming back for more."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A solid ale. Not to hoppy but enough for those who want a bitter and tangy taste. A great ale for the price. A six pack will usually run you around $9 or $10 bucks. In addition, to the quality for the price, it holds a solid ABV. Great drinkability and good w/ most things off the grill."

"Edit... I am not going re review as it is as perfect as ever, I am just changing my score to a perfect 5.... Every time I drink this I am just amazed at how perfect it is, so why do I not have it rated that way????"
""
"I know this isn't the best beer out there, by far, but I am just now really getting into craft brews and this is the best I have had so far. This is my favorite beer and it is 5/5 for everything until I can start trying more, which I fully intend to do - until then, this is the bar."

"Beautiful pour with little head due to.such.a soft pour. Good retention. Amazing color. Standard ipa look, slighty cloudy. smells very floral, and citrus. The hops are there strongly in the nose. The mouthfeel is nice. Very drinkable. Not thick yet not thin. Its slick. The hops are there in the taste. Bitter with nice subtle malt undertones that balance perfect. This is a great brew! Cheers!"

"O: Someone got their Centennial hops back! For the past year Two Hearted did not taste the same. Taste like their pale ale which is far below average. This IPA reminds me why I love the style, similar to Dogfish Head 60 Min in regard to how well it is balanced. Malt is more on the bready side than 60 min's caramel backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply put, I love this beer. It is a tasty and approachable, yet substantial and complex example of IPA. The balance is to hops, as it should be. But there is balance. it is not a hop bomb by any means. A great effort overall."

"On tap. Pours a clear light golden amber with a small head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is sugar cookie with a lot of grapefruit and some orange as well. There are also some light floral notes. The initial taste is sweet with some sugar cookie and a bunch of grapefruit and a bit of orange as well as a bit of caramel. The finish has a mild bitterness as well as quite a bit of sweetness. Medium-light bodied. Relatively low carbonation. A bit more sweetness than I would like, but a pretty solid IPA, especially for one that is regularly available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well-crafted floral IPA that has just enough malt backbone that it isn't a one-dimensional floral hop bomb. Easy to drink, refreshing. Bells' continues to do their excellent brewing and this is one of their better beers (Black Note remains my total favorite, obviously). (4.25)"

"A great beer just don't have the distribution to the whole US. Had this beer on vacation and can't get it where I live. Contacted the brewery and they said they had no plan going nation wide anytime soon. Bummer! Would be a beer I would buy regularly. If you can get your hands on one of these I highly recommend drinking one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I shouldn't have smelled or looked at this beer before I drank it, because those are the two things about this that impressed me most. This is a well balanced beer that is surely drinkable, yet I feel the end's lingering bitterness may throw off some East coast IPA guys. I was expecting the taste to match the smell and although that wasn't the case, this is still a good beer."
"O- this one has some great balance, the aromas seem fresher and more authentic than a typical IPA. This is a great example of the style."

"Two hearted pours a golden straw color with about a finger of white head. Good lacing with this one. Piney, grapefruit resin fills the nose. Thicker body, more of what I would consider Midwest IPA body. Well balanced taste with good drinkability. Also been a fan of bells and two hearted doesn't disappoint."
""
""
"Overall - Certainly not the hoppiest IPA you'll come across, but it may be one of the more unique offerings out there. Beautiful flavor profile. Excellent balance. Wish I had more than just this one."
""

"O - Easy to see why why this is old reliable. I'm so happy that I have everyday access to this beer. It scratches an itch, that's for sure."

"Tastes like clean crisp resinous grapefruit juice. Mildly carbonated big bitterness with a balanced finish. Slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Clean good flavors with intense drinkability. Nice big malty back bone that holds the beer and all it's flavors together into one great sip that leaves you looking for more. Had this out in chicago over the weekend and it was my first time out there, this along with some others i've had while i was out there made it clear that between english ipa's and west coast ipa's there is a legitimate midwest style ipa that is simple and delicious in it's own way. Super drinkable with simple but well blended flavors. Good reputation for a reason."

"O - One of the best of the popular IPAs in the country, Two Hearted is so well fashioned, crafted to suit almost any beer drinking occasion, I'll pick this one up just about anytime I can out of state. It was better on tap, after having it bottled, the floral and citrus hops on the nose as just a bit more pungent."

""
"Overall, this will be the IPA that I measure all others by, and that might not be fair, or reasonable, but it can't be helped. The amplitude factor in this beer is beyond comprehension. There are of course other beers in this league, Centennial comes to mind, and SweetWater IPA, but not many more."
""
""
"	Overall Impression: I love this beer, it's a great IPA; the hops are present throughout the experience (from smell to swallow) but are balanced by some malty sweetness and grapefruit (and other citrus flavors); it's hard to say what my favorite part is, but if you were to force my hand, I would have to say the hoppy presence (I mean c'mon, it's an IPA!)"

"Served with a two finger head and shows copper with orange accents. Good head retention, and splotchy lacing. Big floral and citrus aromas on the nose. Fairly bitter citrus-tinged hops are ever-present as is the biscuity malt bill. Finishes dry with citrus rind bitterness. Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, and smooth. Very drinkable, however the nose tends to promise much more depth to the flavor than is actually delivered. Certainly a very solid American IPA, but nothing groundbreaking. Still not among my top choices for go-to American IPAs"

"Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, fresh bottle, only two weeks old. Appearance is a deep rusty orange and some yellow, cloudy, little head and not much lacing but I slipped this one in too. Smells a very out doors like evergreens and citrus, grapefruit, resinous, fir and balsam notes, just appropriate for said-named beer. Bitter hits early, and modulates and sustains for some time. Grapefruit rind bitter and balanced malt sweet, with strong afterglow and terrific echo, staying with the palate. This one, a terrific sipper, goes camping with me. Impossible to emulate, and truly hard to beat...more please."
""
""
""
""
"The pink grapefruit, the herbal piney flavors, the slight citrus all from the centennial hop? Very well brewed beer especially with how amazing the malt bill is with this hop strain. This IPA is one my favorites and I wish I could get this in NJ."

"O- I have had two hearted a couple of times before and remembered it as being far better than this batch, but the inconsistency of the brew will steer me clear of purchasing this again in the near future"
"O) A good IPA, somewhat refreshing due to moderate ABV, hops present but not a monster. I would say it's on second-tier of IPA. Very glad I ignored the older 4-pack I tried a few months back; this was a much better and fresher example."

"Overall: Very enjoyable beer from Bell's and I'd say it's reasonably priced too where I buy mine. I like its drinkability and subtle complexities. Still tasting different things every time I drink it. Definite recommend."
""

"O: Unfortunately, I’m disappointed in this one. I was expecting a bit more from Bell’s on this especially with such great reviews and it leaves me wondering if I'm missing something here. I personally think there is too much grain which throws this one off. The hops are great, but there is a lack of tropical fruits to help the balance of this brew."

"This beer pours like it is going to be nothing special. It has a slightly cloudy deep gold appearance with little head, but a lot of lacing. The smell is very fruity. Apples, grapefruit, and maybe some pine. The mouthfeel is world class, all of the complexity present with about the right amount of carbonation. Taste is excellent, a sweet fruity goodness well balanced with bitter hops. A magnificent offering!!!"

"O: To my taste, right on target for an IPA- the bold hop taste pushes the limit but is by no means over-done."
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent and unusual hop offering. Quite pleasing on this summer evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the greats for the simple reason that it takes what is normally considered a ""hop bomb"" amount of hopping and balances it in a way that keeps the palate from being wrecked as rapidly as other IPAs, as well as showcasing an appealing pallette of hopping aspects."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For the review, the beer has been drunk a bit older than necessary. However, a solid IPA, balanced and with character."
""
""
"o - quite enjoyable and well deserving of its reputation. noticeably better on tap than from a bottle. worth seeking out."
""
""
""

"This is a top-notch IPA, and I'm impressed. Sure to become one of my stand-bys."

"O: This is a solid IPA that stands apart from East Coast and West Coast offerings. Pretty colors. Fantastic smell. And, great taste. Bell's also has great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorite IPAs, and is best enjoyed on draft in my opinion."

"M: A nice moderate level of carbonation and a medium to full body. This is a really nice beer."

""
""

"O. Much better than the first time I had this beer. Tastes great for an everyday local IPA I can't get around me. Looks fantastic and drinks way easier than 7% Yo Bells, get to Mass."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty magnificent beer. This has a distinct, strong, pleasant taste to it. As someone that's new to Bell's, this and Oberon have made a good first impression on me ... at least on tap. In about a half hour of drinking, I had my first two ""Wow."" beers."
""
""
"Honestly, it's nothing too excited but it's a classic and it never disappoints. Tasty stuff."
""
"O- nice IPA.Hop heads will enjoy this, even though the hop profile isnt overly complex."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: The balance makes it the beer very drinkable, and the carbonation isn't noticeable. 7% ABV, though, so take it easy on these bad boys."
"Just a perfectly balanced and solid all around beer. Everything an IPA should be."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, burnt orange and is capped by a big frothy white head. There was nice lacing in my glass. Citrus aromas explode from the glass and are underlined by tropical fruit and a slight sweetness. Some pine as well as some grapefruit, pineapple, and orange flavors meet a nice malt feel. Medium body and medium-light in carbonation, Two Hearted Ale is well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite IPA's for everyday drinking. It pours with a nice head and has a piney citrusy smell to it with a little bit of sweetness. It is very hoppy with a complex taste which is very drinkable with a nice balance between piney and fruity hops."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. Great start to IPA Day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great IPA! Refreshing, not overly hoppy, and well balanced."
""
""
"O - I see why this is such a highly rated beer. A very flavorful IPA that goes quenches your thirst."
""
""
""
""
"D - For me, this beer didn't quite live up to the hype. However, this should really stand as a benchmark for what a good American IPA should be. This beer had everything you would expect from the style, from the light toasty and bready caramel malt backbone, to the big, assertive hop presence in the finish. A nice balance between the piney/earthy/herbal hops, and the tropical/fruity ones as well. Altogether, this makes for a delicious and drinkable brew that any true beer lover should try at least once. Remarkable, but not quite world-class."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the freshest bottles of Two Hearted that I’ve consumed and it made a difference. There is some of the same tropical fruit notes that I get from Hopslam. A classic."

"An off-white head sits atop a hazy yellow-orange brew. Smells of malts, subtle grapefruit and herb. Tastes grainy at the forefront, followed by some earthy hops, a dollop of sugar and a mild fruitiness. Smooth and light to medium bodied. Has a slightly creamy core, but remains dry overall. Not exactly what I was expecting form this one, but it drinks fairly well, so I can't complain too much."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear gold color with a thin head and no lacing. The aroma is of lemons with faint hints of grapefruit and caramel. The flavor is an odd mix of mild grapefruit, lemons, very sweet malt, and bread. There's a bit of Ginger Ale hiding in the background. As it warms any complexity fades and bitter hops come through. It's mouthfeel is medium. Bells Two Hearted Ale is an ok beer, slightly recommended."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours with a golden body and ticket white head. Head retention is very nice. The smell is a comforting hop blanket of the American variety. The taste is phenomenal, very smooth but also no slouch in the hops department. Mouthfeel is great and overall just a great beer."

"D - A top notch American IPA... My personal favorites within the categories are those with balance and a strong malty base and this one fits that characterization perfectly... Highly recommended... Something I will need to pick up in bottled form on a more regular basis... Possibly the best that Bell's has to offer..."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with a long lasting white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, biscuit malt and hints of caramel. Body is full and crisp. Some citrusy hops, biscuit malt and fruity notes fill the mouth. Long, grapefruity finish. It seems to me that the bottle was old."

"Overall: This was my gateway IPA and still ranks as one of my favorites. Since it features only Centennial hops, it does lack some of the subtle complexities of other IPAs, but it uses what it has to the absolute fullest. Very strong flavors mixed together almost perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an unbelievable IPA. This beer has some of the best lacing that I’ve ever seen. Furthermore, the aromas and flavors are robust enough for a DIPA but the drinkability is purely that of an IPA. I love the amount of grapefruit in this. Bell’s strikes again. This beer is unreal."
""
"EDIT: Tried it again today, in a bottle, and had a more pleasant experience. Color was oddly lighter than it was when drank on tap previously. Stronger scent of pine, and the taste was more hoppy and just overall tasted more full and balanced than my previous experience with it on tap. Notes of grapefruit and pine were much more apparent."
""
""

""
""

"O- Not a fan of IPA's but I could have 1 or 2 more of these. Better than most IPA's I've had that just overload the beer with hops. This offers something different and more pleasant."

""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - This beer is absolutely delicious on the tongue and cheeks. Light-bodied to medium-bodied in taste. Fresh, piney, sweet, full of lively hops, and brimming with sweet nectary fruit flavors."

"One of my favorite regular IPAs. Bell's is pretty damn good at this style."
""
""
"Slightly hazy orange/yellow with a beautifully frothy off-white head. Great retention. Fantastic aroma with fresh hops, citrus, potpourri, honeycomb and wheat grass. Hearty, creamy, bold, pungent aroma. Smooth earthy hops with tangy grapefruit, tart orange and lemon rinds on the first sip, moves into a creamier body with rich malts and rolled wheat flavors. Finish is smooth and dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Ill buy this for $9 a six pack all day long vs hopslam at $16. One of Bells best IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This will definitely stand out as a very earthy APA. Would go great on a camping trip. I could drink this alone or with a meal. Very good beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer overall. Certainly worth drinking on multiple occasions, great that it is year round and easy to find fresh. Not that expensive either (10.99 a 6 pack for a 7% ABV beer is right in the middle of the price range, imo). A great job from Bell's."

"O: Easily one of the best beers, let alone IPA's, this side of the Mississippi. Bell's Two Hearted is spectacular, and every time I have one, I wonder why I don't drink it more often. If I had my head on straight, I'd stop trading and simply buy a case of this every other week, as it warrants more attention then I give it. A world class offering from one of the best in the business."

"Overall: This is my second try of a Bell's product. I enjoyed this one a little more than the first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good IPA. It can't compete with something like Dogfish Head 90min, but I like it in that it's not trying to be 'in your face' hoppy. Rather, it's a pleasant yet robust, hoppy brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is, quite simply, one of the best American IPAs on the market. It's made by Bell's Brewery in Michigan. It's popular in Michigan, Ohio, and other midwestern states. It's a tad pricey ($10.99 is a good deal for a six-pack) but it's definitely worth it. It packs a punch at 7%, but the high ABV isn't overwhelming in the taste. One of my favorite beers. You can't get it in Texas as of right now. Come on, Bell's! Send some Two-Hearted our way! Some Oberon, too!"

"Poured from the bottle to a standard shaker, May of 2012. This is one of those beers that you're just so used to being a great beer that you forget to give it credit. It pours an almost perfect orange like the flesh of a fresh orange with a little murkiness to give it a good mysteriousness. The head is off-white, big, and persistent, leaving huge cobwebs of oily lacing all over the glass. The nose is a burst of caramel sweet malt and crushed mango, lemons, and a little bit of a green pine cone as well. The taste follows perfectly, full of sweet fruity mangoes that makes you almost feel like you should have the juice running down your chin. The bittering is big, but not crushing and hangs around a long time as you drink this beer. Great feel with excellent carbonation. This is a great beer, just how an IPA should taste and the availability makes it a great go-to beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - I could drink this beer everyday. It is clean, smooth, and most importantly drinkable. This IPA should be what the average brewer strives to achieve."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 4/29/12. Pours a orange yellow, with a one inch white that leaves attractive lacing. Smell is mango, pineapple, tangerine, grass, and grapefruit. Taste is all of that extremely well balanced, leaving you with subtle grapefruit finish. Body is light, plenty of carbonation, on the dry side, and very drinkable. I need to thank my friend Pat for hauling from Florida for. A true treat! Fans of Stone, Finest Kind, and Flower Power should all really enjoy."
""

"O: deserves an everyday place in my fridge. I dorve 2.5hrs 1 way to get a case of this in PA and it was worth it. I kept 1 sixer for ""next time"". Hard to find on east coast, but deserves better distribution."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent. One of my favorite IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer was poured into a snifter. It came out amber with about 2 1/2 fingers of white head. The scent was very floral and fruity. The taste was extreme citrus with just the right amount of hops on the back end. The mouth feel is very smooth. I love this beer and try to pick it up anywhere that I see it available."
""
""
""
"Overall, this IPA would be perfect drinking if there a little more malt added for the balance. But, if you are hophead then this a beer that you will fall in love with. I love my hops don't get me wrong. I just like some balance."
"Overall, a nice IPA. I'll buy this when locally available but won't go out of my way for it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty, slight reddish gold w/ very little head and a slightly clingy lacing. Smell was mild yet it had a medicinal overtone to it that was also present in the taste and finish. It's light and smooth on the palate. Almost reminded me of Hamm's Golden Draft without the macro carbonation. The medicinal aftertaste doesn't linger long in the finish and is replaced by a pleasant, malty flavor. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. But I was hoping for more from the reviews I've read. I may purchase it again."
"Pours a bright golden orange with a thumbs width white head. Limkted lacing. A nice, bright, citrus, floral and breaddy aroma. Flavor is great and so balanced.Juicy orange, floral, and perhaps my favorite bready malt underbelly for an IPA. A creamy, crisp mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Overall, fantastic beer and right there alongside with Odell's when it comes to IPA's for me. Got to admit, give me the option of this or Odell's and I don't know which one I'd choose, very possibly this one. Fantastic beer....want more!"

"O: I think this beer should be in the top 100 list. Very tasty, easy to drink beer that could sneak up on you (@ 7.0% abv). Highly recommended)"
"Overall - I went out of state to find this beer. I was skeptical, but the flavorings in this IPA truely are spectacular. Lots of flavor but not very bitter at all. Great find!"

"beeradvocate dudes: What's up? 78. Please give this one another try."

""
""
"O: This is a very tasty, easy-drinking beer. Pretty well balanced, though hop heads won't complain either. Were it available in my market, I could see myself buying this one often."

"O-I'm not an IPA guy, but Bell's really has it down. This and Hopslam are fantastic hoppy beers to go along with many of their other stellar brews. If I'm in that rare mood for a hop forward brew this is a great choice."
""
""
""
"If you like em hoppy and bitter, try this."
"O - Two Hearted is a classic IPA and an excellent example of the style. It won't blow you away, but it's definitely a go-to beer."
""
""
""
"O - For a standard IPA, this might be the best in the business. All the qualities that this is ""lacking"" are all relative to degrees of robustness, which are found in a DIPA, TIPA, etc."
"This is my go-to IPA. It's not the absolute best, but the drinkability is uncanny. Lots of flavor and it won't bog you down. The only thing to watch out for is that it hides the 7% very well, so the booze will catch up with you."
""
""
""
"O: The upfront hops blast really gets your attention. The grapefruit and citrusy bite come in a big rush and then blend with the pine and floral flavors adding interesting layers. This is another great offering from Bells that is sure to please hop heads."

""

"Another fabulous offering from Bell's. I consider this the flagship beer, not Amber Ale. There are so many things about this beer that are right. It pours a sturdy, healthy head that takes a while to dissipate. Taste is unbelievable. Great hop tast but still balanced. It is the Hopslam Jr. Fantastic!"
""
"Overall- Wish I had six of these instead of just one. A great product. Surprised to see the Bros hit it so low."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had this brew several times, but am just getting around to giving a proper review. It's good, no real complaints. But nothing outstanding, nothing to separate it from the host of other American IPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad this is a year round brew. In my book, it is one of those tasty sixers that I appriciate to have on hand at the local beer store when needed. Very impressed, probably the fourth time I have had this one and it seems to taste better every time I taste it. I am a big fan of quite a few Bells concoctions but this isn't the reasoning for liking this...it's just a good beer ladies and gentlemen."
"Overall (4.5): This is just so well-balanced, without relying on sweetness to balance out the hops. As a result, it drinks like a session beer in spite of the 7.0% ABV, and is easy-going. A real knock-out in this style might be hoppier, might be more pungent, might be lacier, etc., but this is just so tasteful and balanced. Excellent beer, it’s like an exercise in what your standard IPA should be, nailing every aspect without screaming for attention at any point."

I would definitely get this one again (too bad it is not distributed locally to me)."

"	Very drinkable. While I’m used to, and I think prefer, an IPA that’s a little more bitter, clean, and crisp, it’s pretty good; they have a unique thing here. Looking forward to having the Great Lakes IPA right after this to get more of a sense of what the Midwest has to offer to the IPA world."

"Overall I really like this beer and it's one of may favorite American IPA's, they don't get much more solid then this and the mixture of citrus and floral hops is just about perfect and gives this a beer a distinct aroma and taste that is unique to this beer. This beer has great drinkability, when I was younger I was known to drink a six pack in a session but after one too many rough mornings I have come to the conclusion that two or three of these is the perfect amount. What I liked most about this beer were the flavor and aroma, they are kick ass they set this beer apart from all the other IPA's on the market. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I thought long and hard and I can't really think of a single thing wrong with this beer, I would like to see it in cans, but the fact it comes in a mini keg is pretty kick ass. I will continue to regularly buy this beer and since I live in Michigan this beer is almost always an option at any descent bar or restaurant, and it pairs well with almost any type of food, I like it the most with some hot wings. If you consider yourself an IPA aficionado and have not tried this beer, you need to seek it out ASAP, enough said. I love this beer and I think I always will, to me this is the quintessential Michigan IPA, pretty much a classic. Bell's is one of the most consistent brewerys and this beer is very solid, like most of their lineup, one of the best American IPA's from one of the best American brewerys."
"Overall - The flavor is sweet, well balanced and most importantly, enjoyable! The palate is also very well balanced, crisp and refreshing. You really cannot go wrong with Two Hearted Ale, it is that good!"
""
""
""

"Tough to beat this IPA, period. I just wish I didn't have to drive an hour to PA to get it."

"Another solid IPA and another strong brew from Bell's. Where Bell's appeared from? I don't know. How long it's been in Georgia? I have not idea. But I'm glad it is. Not much tops Hopslam. Two hearted is definitely a favorite and a sure go-to beer."

"O: one of my favorite IPAs ever, I hope those that have easy access appreciate, I know I would. this and Hopslam are sublime and stupidely drinkable"

Best consumed fresh, this beer is still great in the bottle and is almost always in my house. The fact that it's named after a Hemingway location makes it all the more special in my book!"

Very good body that just seems to change by the second, warm, hearty, crisp and citrusy good as a sipper or dare I say session for the hearty few. So glad this lived up to the hype, though I know from what I've read batch variation is quite common. Would seek out and recommend. Another solid brew from Bell's"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a light straw amberish color with a nice sized white head with nice lacing. Smells of sweet malt and a flowery and citrus aroma. Tastes light sweet malt with a little piney and citrus from the hops, which is nice balance and great taste. Carbonation is right and it is a bit light bodied, which is very good. Overall, a good IPA, one that lives up to the hype."

"This is one great IPA. I'm sad I don't live in Bell's' distribution area, but was very glad to grab a sixer and enjoy it in CA. Well balanced, and very different from West Coast IPAs. Not as piney or resinous, this is still a bitter brew that I enjoy. A great change of pace and a good stand by."

"O - At first not so appealing or drinkable, but I find myself drawn to the Two Hearted sip after sip and then back to the fridge for another. It is has become a go-to bitter IPA, not as smooth and easy as some, not as punishing as the big boys."

""

"Overall: I am a fisherman so i really love this label with a trout on it. The beer is better than your average IPA. I think this would be a good beer to take fishing to give you more luck! Also because its a tasty beer! Bells make quality beer! Glad its a local beer for me!"

"I did check the bottle dating after I wrote this review and discovered that it was over 2 months old. Maybe the flavors faded? I'll have to try to get my hands on a fresher bottle for comparison..."

"Overall this beer really opened my world to ipas over the past few years. More than anything else this is the reason I'm a hophead. It'll always hold a special place in my beer experience. Delicious, full flavored, balanced but not tame ipa. cheers"

"Taste is of mild fruity and piney hops. Great mouthfeel...not overly bitter but very well balanced. Very very good IPA and excellent on tap. I'd get again for sure."
"O- Had hopes for this beer but it fell flat for me. Wasnt impressed and wouldnt search this one out. Would give another try if received as an extra in a trade might have just had an off bottle."
"Bottled on 1/18/12. This is some fresh stuff right here! Poured into a Smuttynose Big Beer tulip. Wow! Gorgeous color on this IPA. One of the best I've seen for the style. Taste is amazing. Flawless really. Hints of sweet citrus flavors such as grapefruit and candied orange. The hops don't slap your tongue silly (I usually like that) but who cares when this beer tastes so good. Really refreshing and an easy drinker even at 7%. This beer also left some gorgeous lacing. This is my first from Bell's and I know I'm going to try more from them, not to mention purchase this beer again. Like a lot of reviewers before me have stated, the Bros really missed the mark on this excellent IPA."
""

"O: An outstanding beer... IMO, this, Stone IPA and Surly Furious are the best Single IPAs found on MOST liquor store shelves in my area. Surly is rather different, so I wish to do a taste test of Stone and Bell's and find out which I think is better."

"I've been using Beer Advocate for three or four years and this is the first time I have ever seen ""The Bros"" blow it, and the user community nail it. It's usually just the opposite, the Bros get it right. This is an excellent beer, I suggest they re-sample it. A very nice American IPA, goes down easy, well balanced, and not an insanely over-powering, ""hop-head"" beer. Just a good flavorful IPA."

"Had this many times while living in Michigan and honestly it is the perfect go to beer. Especially the case on tap. Pours a beautifully clear golden color, plenty of bubbles, with a creamy white one finger head on the top. The aroma consists of sweet pale malts, grapefruit, honey, just a hint of pine. Flavor follows as smooth as can be. Some up front bitter slowly drifts into a sweet honey grapefruit flavor and finishes with a clean crisp bite. Lively carbonation, light on the palate, and goes down way too easy. Not a world beating hop bomb IPA, but one of the most drinkable beers on earth."
""
""

""
"Overall I love this beer, and this style. I will definitely pick this one up again multiple times."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite tasty all-around. Not too much to say other than that. I've had bad experiences with bottles of this, but if you can get this on-tap and fresh, it is worth seeking out. By far my favorite offering from a short visit in Kalamazoo. Cheers Bell's!"

"Had this on tap at Red’s Alehouse in North Liberty, IA. Pours a nice orange with a thick white head. Nice lacing around the glass, nice citrus hop aroma. The flavor is nice and hoppy with grapefruit and lemons. Amazing beer! Good stuff! This is a mainstay in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellowish amber with one finger of thick white head. Tons of hop citrus hop aroma, just bright, sweet, juicy grapefruit. There's a touch of sweet malt in the taste, but it's more than overpowered by the sharp citric hop flavor. From beginning to end this one is just full of that classic American hop taste. Moderate carbonation and a slightly less than medium body give a very smooth mouthfeel that ends with a moderate bitterness and a nice dryness on the palate. The beer just screams classic American IPA, and does so very well."

"I will buy it when I find it..in DC tomorrow, may have to pick up a case or two."

""

"O: Overall, I'm not a big fan. It's one of those styles where you either love it or hate it, and I'm rating it here for what it is, not according to my personal tastes. I know it's a good beer for those who are into the IPA style, and it deserves at least a 4/5. Love it or hate it, it is what it is, and there isn't anything ""bad"" about this beer, it just depends on the palate."
""
""
""

"Overall: Great beer. Gotta be in my top 5. All around the board you cant poke anything wrong with this beer. Very well balanced and not overwhelming for an IPA. Usually overpriced though..."

"O - a well balanced intense beer - a hard combination to pull off"
""
""
""
"O- I have had this a long time ago and remember it being better then it is. Id like to think that its because I got an old bottle but its less then 2 months old. Having said that, its a good beer, more along the lines of a pale ale then an IPA in my opinion. A good choice for any entry level IPA drinkers or somebody wanting a hoppy taste that wont bog them down."
"O: goes down easy, 7.0% abv is just right."
"O- Though I'm not typically big on any kind of IPA, I appreciate this beer and enjoy it quite a bit. The flavors develop nicely and make for a good drinking experience."
"Well, I've wanted to try this one for a while, so when I drove Shangys for my Hopslam, I figured I'd pick up a case of this as well. I was not disappointed. Pours into my tulip glass with a huge, fluffy head. Smells nicely of citrus hops. Great taste: tangy, slightly bitter, very citrusy. Creamy feal for a single IPA. Overall an excellent beer,and not nearly as expensive or hard to get as its big brother, Hopslam."

"Low carbonation. Light amber. Honey straw. Two Hearted starts with a decent head and keeps solid lacing throughout. Malt bouquet profiles bready malts. Biscuity. Tropical hop aromas. Mango. Hints of sweet melons. Flavor is hop forward but not so much as to be tipping the scales one way or the other. A decent balance for the style overall. Medium-bodied. Sweet malt accentuates citrus-centric hops. Cascade and Centennials play their hand for sure. Caramel and toffee flavors as well as a bit of nuttiness blend in well. Great all-around beer that reminds one of a lawn-mower style beer. Low IBUs and decently hidden alcohol could make this dangerous."

"All in all I think this maybe a little hyped as it is pretty basic, nothing spectacular. Worth a shot, but I won't be something I buy ofter."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Side note- better from the bottle."
""
"D - Two Hearted is one of my favorite IPAs - for good reason. The delicious hop flavor is perfectly balanced by light malty sweetness and is highly drinkable for the style. I always try to have a six pack available in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A classic. I have had this beer hundreds of times, but never written a review until now. This beer is very flavorful, packs a big hop punch, but is still mellow enough for the average beer drinker to enjoy. It pairs fantastically with a number of foods as well. I was very excited to get a sixer of this so fresh; how does Bells get it bottled and in stores in 3 days??? I will buy this again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: When I first came on this site, I didn't like hoppy beers. Thankfully, I've seen the light, and it's thanks to beers like this. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely a standard. Untouchable and unquestionable as a damn good IPA."
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable. The sweetness crossed with the dry bitterness and the abrasion and floral afternote makes for a distinct, memorable, and delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ale pours a dirty gold with a finger head. Nice lacing down the pint glass. Citrus aroma, hops strike first up front with a good solid malt backbone the provides a bittersweet finish. Very drinkable and pleasant but nothing spectacular considering the premium price ($12/6 pack Kentucky). It would be a great value at $8.99/6 pack."
"The Rest: Just on the thin side of medium bodied, but with nice malt character. The real star, though, is hops. Great complexity in the hop profile definitely makes me want to have another one!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite IPAs, I was pumped to see it offered in the “pre-game” as it wasn’t on the dinner list. 5"
""
""
""
""
"overall, still my go to session IPA. nothing too crazy, but for $8 a six-pack and considering its constant availability, I cant think of a beer I have had more of in the past few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm really glad I finally got a good bottle of this. It's still not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's a damn good one, and I can see now why people love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one impressive beer. Now I understand why it was so highly recommended by both personal friends and other BA's. Everything is so balanced and smooth it really makes you want to drink a few more, and for the price you pay for this it is almost unmatched. If you haven't had this beer, get it."
""

""
"OVERALL: I truly enjoy this IPA as an everyday standard, but overall I do believe it is overrated. If I did not have regular access to Modus Hoperandi from Ska (which, by the way, is a totally different IPA) I might rank it a little higher, but given that I have an equally delicious everyday IPA out here in Colorado, I can accept not having Two Hearted on a regular basis. That said, a lack of Hopslam this January is horrible for me. Please send Hopslam to Boulder! I can get you Russian River in return!"

""
""
""
""
""
"O- a superb american ipa with near perfect balance. Hop profile is basically ideal, with ample tropical fruit notes and piney bitterness. Malt backbone is substantial and a great supplement. A real treat to try this one as I can't get it in my neck of the woods."
""
""
""
""
"The Two Hearted I’m enjoying over the holiday break came from a six pack bottled mid-December so I know it’s fresh. Looks great, the color of golden-honey with nice clarity and a wonderful head of foam topping it. My mother’s aroma description still holds—floral, citrus pine with some grapefruit zest and spicy hops rounding it out. Tastes piney and bold with some resin. A bit of chew gives it heft, and there’s a pleasant hop bitterness but a sweetness from the excellent malt bill balances it out. Fantastic finish. And, incidentally, wonderful art on the bottle. Feliz año Nuevo!"

"my personal favorite ipa. pours slightly cloudy glowing golden color with a sturdy 2 inch head. smells fruity/floral hops with bready biscuity malt undertones. taste is similar but more intense hops, residual hoppy sweetness in there as well. balanced bitterness is a radiant finish. mouthfeel is near perfect, creamy and well carbonated. this is a craft ipa in its finest form. high abv, high drinkability, fairly priced. if you havent had this one, put it on your list because its a real winner"

"received a bottle via beer trade. poured from bottle into an imperial pint glass. boors a dark honey with a fluffy white head and great lacing. some pine and citrus notes in the aroma. Nice malty sweetness at first followed by a mild hop bitterness that lasts for a short period of time. As it warms the hoppy notes linger on the back of your tongue. A delicious pale/ipa"
""
"Note to self:  you do like this significantly more than Hopalicious. Not sure how much of that is the Centennial hops. Definitely more malt complexity than Hopalicious."
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA that focuses on the pine flavor with hints of dankness and citrus. It gains some complexity with a slightly sweet, bready malt character. All too drinkable. Like Celebration, there is a character that makes the beer better than the sum of its parts."
"O: Even though this was sweeter than I expected it was never overpowering. Highly drinkable and another great go to beer when fresh."

"O: A very good IPA. I had Two Hearted once before and was underwhelmed, but this was a very fresh bottle. I'll grab some again as a good, casual IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Thinner side of medium, a lot of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a hazy golden/yellow color and poured with a fluffy 1-inch head that dissolves into a top layer of foam that lasts the whole way down, leaving faint lacing throughout. I'm getting a floral and grassy scent, with a faint citrus note. There is also a nice scent of hop resins in there. Taste-wise there is a very nice, mild hop bitterness up front. I'm also detecting peach and mango. It leaves a faint hop bitterness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is just exceptional on this one. It is very mild and smooth, and has a sparkling effervescence to it. This is something I would definitely look forward to having again."
""
""
"This beer was reviewed from package date 08/11/11."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Some complexity; remarkably balanced; flavorful and very easy to drink; does not draw a lot of attention to itself; very pleasant and satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: It's been two years since I first tried this beer and I've had the chance to try it multiple times and in comparison to a variety of other IPAs. As a whole, it's still a very nice IPA, but the overwhelming Centennial nose makes the beer smell cereal-sweet (i.e. fruit loops)."

""
""
""
""

""
"Two Hearted smells good too. You get some pine, citrus, and some earthiness. It tastes very good, as well. This is one of the most drinkable IPA's I have had. If you see a bottle, then I recommend picking it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lingering floral hops. My favorite IPA."
""
"Nice creaminess for a single ipa. Good lingering hop taste. It doesn't leave the sticky resin in your mouth, but it leaves that same great taste."
""
""
""
""
"This is the IPA I go to the most. Does nothing perfect for me, but it does everything extremely well. By that I mean I prefer the smell of Flower Power, the taste of Ruination, etc but this does everything almost perfect. Not too expensive, which is always a plus in my book. The beer that got me into IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I liked it, but wasn't blown away by it. Definitely worth a try for all hop heads."
"Nice light amber color when poured from the bottle with a nice head. The smell is grapefruit and floral. What a great taste...nice floral essence with citrus and pine. Very refreshing. It taste very fresh just asking for another sip. This is an outstanding IPA. I haven't had a better one yet."
""
"Very well crafted, expertly executed example of the style, though decidedly unexciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had an on again, off again relationship with this beer. It was the first IPA that made me fall in love with the style. I claimed it was my favorite for a few years, until I moved out west and discovered some others. I than fell back in love with it, only to write it off for other IPAs from the midwest. When it comes down to it, however, this is neither my favorite IPA or a bad one, at that. I will always be a fan of this for being one of the first american IPAs to be a solid example of this style"
""
"All in all, I really liked this IPA. It's a nice alternative to your usual hop bomb. Very drinkable. If only they could get the taste to live up to the smell... Then I'd have something to really talk about!"
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Lived up to the hype for me."
""
""
""
"The only problem is it tastes like I'm drinking a floral arrangement. I've heard lots of people use 'grapefruit' to define hop flavors but I've never tasted more than just hints of that until I had this beer, and my god is it pungent. There are hops all over the place, but it's just too flowery for my palate."
""
""
""
""
"D- It's tasty and is definitely right on point for an IPA but I'm a little let down that the complexity in the nose is lost in the flavor and it ends up being nothing more than good."

"Tangy citrus up front. Mellow, malty backbone holds the hoppy bitterness in check. Almost watery towards the end, but it works well. Very pleasant, extremely sessionable. One of my favorite single IPAs."

""

"O - Bell's Two Hearted Ale ranks at or near the top of my favorite list of IPA's. I really could drink this all day long. It's very refreshing and has incredible drinkability for an IPA. I do enjoy trying new IPA's any chance I get, but when I need a good one to fall back on, this brew does the job every time."
""
""
""
"Overall this a very nice floral IPA. Not a whole lot of citrus here. So if your a fan of the more floral hoppy beers then this one is for you."
""
""
""
"Out of 12oz bottle. This two hearted beer one broke my heart. I had heard much about this beer and expectations were perhaps too high. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Just too much of thick and hearty beer for my palate. I do enjoy other Bells Beers (Best Brown, Hopslam, etc.)which work really well for my tastebuds. Obviously this beer is a crowd pleaser, just not my type of brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured the same as most IPAs: a copper, transparent color with a nice whitish foam head. The smell is citrus hops. The taste is the same. There doesn't seem to be a complex mixture of hops, but it has a good amount of hops (though not that hoppy). It has a really citrusy flavor from the hops and is very easy to drink. I could easily drink these all night, and it has a pretty good ABV for how smooth it is. I definitely recommend this beer if you can get your hands on it, but it is not worth stressing about trying if you are a huge hop head that appreciates big hop flavor. It is a pretty good IPA, but still not the best that I have tried in my short time as a beer nerd."
""
""
""
"Fantastic. As usual."
""
""
""
"O: This has got to be one of the best American IPAs out there today. A helluva quencher with lots of flavor. Try it with spicy foods."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale orange with a slight pearl white head. Good lacing and the head sticks around as well. Sweet caramel and grapefruit aroma, a bit of pine on the back end as well. Awesomely balanced and big flavor profile. This one would be a hop bomb if not for the perfect amount of sweet malt and vice versa. Silky smooth grapefruit starts off the hop profile and leads into the tasty caramel and sweet bread malt. Perfect amount of sweetness for an IPA, sweet without being too noticeably sweet. Strong pine flavors give a quick, crisp hop finish to the beer. Very simple flavors, but they go great together and the mouthfeel is perfect as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The color was a cloudy amber. The smell and taste were not as strong as my favorite pale ales but the citrus and pine notes were there that make this a very solid PA. This beer obviously has gotten very high ratings on this website and although I don't think I can give it an ""A", it is a solid offering of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, dark orange with a thick, white head. The head stays afloat almost through the whole beer. As small portions of the head do fade away it leaves a thick, sporadic lace on the sides of the glass. Strong piney aroma is about all I get, but that is all I need from a good IPA. Slight bitterness from the hops with a sweet malt finish. This has a great crisp finish and carbonation is spot on. Great, readily available IPA that is definitely one of my go to beers year round."

"O: This is a great beer and one of my favorite IPAs. Its extremely quaff able and can be drank whether it is 100 degrees outside or 0 degrees outside."
"Carbonation adds only a smidgen of crispness to the extremely slick feel. It's very smooth but maybe lacking just a bit of body IMO. Despite a minor dent in the mouthfeel dept, I must remember that this beer has been in my glass for 5 minutes and I only have one drink left. Needless to say it's a solid example, and it doesn't need another review to solidify it's reputation."
"Overall, a nice IPA. It's a nicely balanced with crisp, clean flavors. I'd love to get a fresher bottle to try."
"Overall: A winner in my books. One of the best American IPA's I've tasted. Just extremely balanced and drinkable. I would keep this in the fridge all the time if I could."
"Delicious beer with pungent aromatic hops and sweet body. I'm definitely glad to finally try this beer, it's even better than hopslam in my opinion! Unfortunately, although this beer is quite tasty, it's still pretty generic in comparison."
"O- Solid ipa, this has always been a want and now I cant wait for an even fresher bottle!"
"O - Such an easy drinker, a delicious beer that is always in my fridge."
"This is a pretty standard beer of mine, fitting with a love of hops. It can be in your face and the taste lingers, so be prepared."
"The beer poured a cloudy golden with a bit of white lace. The aroma was a wonderful blend of floral hops and peach. The taste was of rich malt with a heady mix of peach and floral hops. The feel was medium and wet. Having read all the devotionals to this beer on here over the years I was eager to have one. Finding myself at a bar in Dublin OH that had this, I was ready to give it a try. The aroma and taste were really much more than I had expected. A beautiful use of hops to enhance and not merely bitter the beer. Quite an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, a good IPA but very sweet. I love balance in an IPA but this is just a bit too sweet. It's a combination of the very fruity hops and the inherent sweetness of the beer. The aroma is incredible, I just wish it were a little less sweet."
"Overall- In the end, this IPA sacrifices being aggressively hoppy to get the malt to smooth out the mouth feel and make this beer a really easy drinker. This is a fantastic IPA and one that should be readily available in any hop-head's fridge."
"Appearance is light copper with two healthy fingers of head. There is some retention of the head throughout and it leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite pleasant - fresh citrus and hops are very noticeable. The flavor is lemony with a hop presence, but the body is too subtle for an IPA. This beer is enjoyable because it is complex, but it lacks the body I like in an IPA. It is certainly worth a try, but its reputation is quite inflated if you ask me."
"I cannot express my respect for the taste of this beer. A perfect example of an American IPA. Piney, malty, creamy and smooth. Some citrus, but not alot. This baby is perfect for a summer bbq or sitting in front of the tv watching football. Full bodied and just wonderful. As the beer warms in the glass the malts start to come through more and it just stays creamy... Delicious."
"Light bodied...refreshing. Nice carbonation. I really enjoy this particular IPA...and I usually am not an IPA person."
"O: Clean and easy to drink. One of my favorite IPAs."
"O: A good pickup for a growler. This would be a good pickup for a tailgate or drinking in large quantities as I did. Goes nice from a growler, but I suspect this beer is a tad more complicated than it tastes coming from a keg. Perhaps from a bottle you can pickup on some more tastes. I'm not disapointed with it one bit."
"O: Yum. I like the taste of this one a lot. Everything else is meh, but the taste keeps it interesting."
"This beer was pleasant. A nice first impression along with a nice after taste. I was not in the least bit disappointed. This lives up to my expectation of an IPA just fine to date. Definitely give Two Hearted Ale a taste. I think beers like this among many others are starting to convince me I'ma big fan of IPAs."
"Has a nice orange color to it which is what I would expect. The hops are present in the bittering department but they seem to be lacking in the aroma. I'm tasting a little sweetness that doesn't really seem to belong there. Overall, I'd say it's a decent beer but not something that I would seek out. If it were offered to me or available for $1 a bottle, I'd drink it again."
"O- Probably my favorite IPA. It is very easy to get caried away with this beer. I also prefer it on draft, which I have had multiple times."
"The fruitiness and sweetness are incredibly prominent, and I really have a hard time believing this is an IPA-- but that IPA bitterness is very much there at the end, and provides an interesting and welcome contrast to the first flavors. The flavor system present in this beer is incredibly complex, and while it can easily be downed in a few gulps, it really must be savored to be truly appreciated."
"Two-Hearted Ale is of a slightly hazy amber hue with a nice foamy head. The aroma suggests multiple hop varieties with citrus notes dominating. More so than many other IPAs I've tried, this one has a very clear and distinct grapefruit and pineapple dominance. The flavor was very big with Tart fruits and flower petal, along some malt present with the hop bitterness. I want to emphasize that the bitterness is really turned up on this one, especially in the finish. The mouth feel is 'sticky.' This is a somewhat complex ale... if the complexity was turned up one more notch with a hint of something else I may have given this beer a perfect score."
"pleasant citrus grapefruit aroma. Appearance is golden with a nice head. Taste is citrus grassy hops with a pleasant copper taste. Palate is nice and carbonated with a resinous taste to it. Overall I am sad I can’t get this in Colorado. I am still glad i got to taste it though!"
"This beer pours a nice orangish yellow with a decent off whit head. The smell is less than what I was expecting with an ok hop presence immediately followed by a strong malt presence. The beer tastes very much like it smells. The mouthfeel is light to medium light with good carbonation. Overall q balanced beer just not the ipa I was expecting."
"Two Hearted pours an orange/amber color. Two fingers of white foam recede leaving minimal lacing and a thin coaster which lingers atop the beer. The nose is citrus and floral hops. Taste is orange rind and pale malt. Mild bitterness and and bread give way to a sweet citrusy finish. The beer is medium bodied with creamy texture. A nice take on the style by Bells."
"Overall - I'll give some bonus points here for drinkability, as it hides the alcohol very well. It's a solid IPA for sure. It's not as bitter as some, which is a bit of a change of pace. There's still a lot of flavor going on, and (IMO) the malt is balanced. My West Coast friends would disagree."
"A robust drink. I really liked this take on the IPA. There is a lot of malt balancing out the hops and they compliment each other well."
"O- a great IPA, one of my favorites."
"Overall this was decent, but after the smelling the aroma I was looking forward to a solid hop flavor and was a little let down."
"I love this beer. There is so much subtlety and I think that's where it shines. It doesnt have the huge nose or flavors of a sculpin or a west coast ipa but it doesn't have to. A great everyday go-to beer, can't wait till they ramp up production so its easier to find."
"O - A wonderfully sessionable IPA outing! Balanced, with good hop character that doesn't overpower but doesn't wimp out either."
"A pretty archetypal single IPA, this would be a staple in my fridge if I had ready access to it. In any case, this is fantastic on tap. As reliable a choice as any."
"O: Balanced brew that was very enjoyable and one that I will seek out again."
"Overall: For some reason, I didn't really care for Bell's Two Hearted Ale the first couple of times I tried it. My palate must have changed because I really enjoy it now. In fact, it's very comparable to Founders Centennial IPA (though Two Hearted would have to get the edge). I like the fish label and Hemingway reference as well.. one of the best beers to enjoy outdoors bar none!"
"Arromatics were outstanding with a very crisp and clean taste."
"Unique in a good way. As good as an IPA can get."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear deep gold that leaves a two finger head. The aroma is candied oranges and pineapple. Smells floral, sweet, bitter, and delicious. The taste is perfect. Starts of slightly bitter but a nice caramel sweetness comes in to balance it out. Not too sweet, yet not too bitter. Perfect balance. I get mostly citrus wrapped in caramel candy. Drinkability is extremely high. This is the best single IPA I have ever had, granted I live in Florida and do not have access to most California and other west coast IPAs. The perfect beer in every way. Great for noobs, great for hop heads, and great for those who are looking to get into IPAs. A+"
"$10 a sixer."
"Overall: I could drink this for days, all of them, forever. The balance and flavor profile are fantastic. It's not the best of the style by far, but damn if it's not one of the best drinking IPAs on the market. I am envious of all who get to drink this fresh all the time."
"Cheers..."
"O: Overall a very enjoyable beer. A good combination of malt, hops, and a touch of booze."
"This is a fantastic beer, no doubt about it. I've had it plenty of times, and I still keep coming back to it. People refer to this as Hopslam's younger brother, but to be honest, I think Hopslam is a completely different animal, and I love both equally."
"O - This is my favorite American style IPA. I have yet to find one that beats it."
"Pretty nice & drinkable overall."
"I admit I did not get a great look at the color of this, so I graded it slightly down in the interest of not assuming anything."
"O - Definitely a top tier IPA worthy of all its praise."
"Overall: Impressive. Very bold all around. Exactly for what I hope for in an IPA. Heavier on the citrus side, the pine shows up during the aftertaste."
"Definitely the best of the four Bell’s I had on my trip to Ann Arbor. I’d love for it to come out west."
"Overall: The distributor told me to give this a try since I love IPA's. It is a very good beer All round it is a delicious beer. Cheers."
"Reminds me of Racer 5, but more smooth and less aggressive. Delicious and highly drinkable."
"O- Good IPA but not the best ive ever had."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall - One of two go-to IPAs in my area. Sculpin beats it out, though. If the aroma were better on this one, it would delicious."
"Overall, not a bad one paired with food. To me though, you have to have something to cut the hops, a little too bitter to handle alone in mass quantities."
"D-E-licious!"
"93."
"Another great brew from Bell's, great stuff."
"The beer is pretty dry and crisp. It has a light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Extremely drinkable. "
"Cheers"
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice hop malt balance with a solid hop profile. Very smooth and drinkable, even with a slightly high abv."
"extremely cloudy yet beautiful..like a sunset..the aroma was juicy fruity bits of mango..a little mustiness..wow that mango is crazy..with a hint of a champagne aroma at the very end after sniffing real hard for a while..and a shot of pineapple..pineapple mimosas anyone?..the first thing i notice is complete balance..the next is the subtly sweet mango fruity taste..some citrus..maybe tangerine..yet not too sweet..not too bitter either..but a delight..the next progression of flavors is as follows..a hint of yellow watermelon, soil, dirt, and earth, green veggie, spinach, celery, back to sweeter fruits, pineapple, maybe some more unripe and unsweet mango..kiwi..this is a treat.."
"Overall, this beer did feel like it had lost some of its edge since I last enjoyed it. While much of that might be owed to my expanding palette and my increased familiarity with IPA's, I place most blame on bottling. IPAs really should only be experienced fresh on draught."
"O - Very good IPA. I am having this a little late I think. I held on to it for a little too long so this should probably get better scores from me, but for now it will stay as is."
"I've got a buddy making a clone of it, maybe I'll try to get one going, or wait until Bell's ships it to Houston.."
"Overall: Two Hearted Ale really is a classic. Its so well balanced, and yet unbridled because it is so incredibly dry and hoppy. This will probably become one of my go-to beers, for sure!"
"Pours a clear, bright, copper with two fingers of thick, bone white head. Head recedes slowly and leaves decent lacing. Nose is big on citrusy hops. Taste is, as expected, definitely hop forward. Lots of citrus and pine hops with a faint grainy backbone. Has a nice sharp hop bitterness without being overwhelming or too much of a hop bomb. Medium bodied with a bit of a sticky finish. Honestly I don't know if this one could have ever lived up to the hype for me; however, it came pretty close and that still says a lot. Definitely glad I finally got a chance to try this."
"O: Great beer. Nothing else need be said."
"A very nice American IPA, true to the style and satisfying to drink. Hits all the right spots, will look forward to trying again. I've had both fresh and a few months old, and the fresher you get this beer, the more enjoyable it is. A bit of age is fine, but the complexity isn't as strong."
"Great citrus and sweet fruit flavors with some tongue biting bitterness. One of my favorite go to IPAs that I can get around here. Surprised I haven't reviewed this before, I drink a lot of this stuff year round."
"This is my go-to beer at one of my favorite bars in town, and it definitely stands up to scrutiny. It might just be my poor sense of smell, but I'd like a bolder aroma. Two Hearted is a perfect, if dangerous, session beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Best American IPA I've had so far. No real weakness."
"Pours a clear golden color with a a white head. Leaves behind a nice lacing after the head dissipates. The nose on this is piney grapefruit with some biscuit. Taste is more citrus and pine, but its balanced. Niether hops or bitterness dominate, its definitely a balanced beer. This is insanely drinkable. If Bells distributed to NJ I would always have this in my fridge."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow-orange with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to a film. Thin broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of fresh floral and piney hops and citrus aromas. Taste is of very nice floral/herbal hops, citrus juice/zest, and a malt flavor on the finish. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA that is very easy to drink. I enjoyed this one very much."
"This is a good IPA, but the fruitiness far exceeds the bitterness, and the malt character is a little thin for me."
"This is a very nice IPA with tropical notes and high bitterness.  This would be a regular in my fridge if it were a local!"
"Sweet for an IPA but probably not by Midwest standards. Enough hop feel to satisfy but not overwhelming. Nice balance between hop feel and flowery malt flavors that make this a very enjoyable change from West Coast hop bombs."
"Thanks goes to Pest for the awesome extra."
"Final verdict, real good everyday beer. At the end of the day this is a somewhat conservative beer, in that Bell's is not trying to hit a home run with it, just swinging for singles. But they've done a real good job, this unofficial scorer has marked it as a base hit, and a solid one at that."
"Citrus fruitiness cuts through the hops, which linger in the bitter aftertaste. Doughy, biscuity malts persist throughout. Crisp and clean with a medium body. An excellent pale ale."
"O - It's a good beer, for sure. World-class? Meh. I can rattle off a number of higher quality American IPAs (IMO), but I'm glad I got a chance to check out this Bell's classic. Don't turn it down if you see it."
"beautiful nose - very fruity but spicy, citrus and light light light grapefruit. beautiful orange/gold color w/ nice head. taste - for an ipa - does not kick you in the teeth - fruit bomb for sure but hops are right there and very clean. also get some outdoorsy smells/flavors... smells like rainy outdoors or something - very earthy. i could kick this back everyday and be good. i'm really enjoying swirling this around in the glass and smelling whats coming out... its like spring and summer, country ponds, lakes, outdoors - damn good ale - and damn good ipa... also the art on the bottle and the sixer pack - very nice... good stuff - PLEAE SHIP TO TX SOME DAY SOON!!! r"
"Textbook IPA. Smooth, balanced and easy drinking. Great citrus. A classic."
"O- Easy drinking and well balanced. I've always had a special place in my heart for Two Hearted. I just wish Bell's was distributed in CO..."
"O - very good. One of my go to ipa's."
"really an outstanding brew.it sells out quick in the few stores here that carry it so im aleways glad to find it"
"O-Overall, I'm really enjoying this beer. Bell's really knows how to make a great beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a finger of off white head, decent retention and nice lacing. Smells like sweet, round citrus (orange and tangerine) layered over pine. Somehow these coexist together without really integrating; it's an interesting effect. Taste is more pine and flower forward, with the citrus almost absent, both of which mingle with some biscuity malt. Mild bitter finish. Medium bodied, with carbonation medium-high and having kind of a harsh feeling. Overall, a very solid IPA, great everyday beer."
"This IPA excels at being both smooth and easy drinking, as well as bright, clean and refreshing. An all-around winner for me."
"Orange/amber color with white head a'top, smells of fresh citrus and wheat grass. Definitely some spice and garlic lingering in there as well. Taste is the same with not as much bite as I was expecting. Really good, though. The mouthfeel wasn't quite what I was expecting; seemed a little watery and more like a pale ale. Overall, a solid IPA and one I wish I had more of."
"A very well made, drinkable, refreshing IPA. Well worth tasting is you like IPAs."
"O- an excellent IPA and will be one of my favorites"
"Very pale for an IPA, almost yellow, with a thin but persistent head. The aroma is pure floral and citrus hops with a touch of fruit. The flavour is all hops as well, more floral and citrus, not resinous or overly bitter, with the slightest hint of caramel malt. No trace of the high ABV is detectable."
"Overall - Really an excellent IPA, and a great representative of the style. Great flavors, and perfectly balanced. If you like a good malt backbone and some slight carmel with your IPA, let this one warm up to 50 degrees or so. I highly recommend this IPA."
"Nice murky orange-amber pour, with a foamy head that leaves pillow lace. Beautiful mixture of citrus and floral notes in the nose. Well done... wonderfully hopped from beginning to end, without overtaking any of the other portions of the brew. Nice orange peel and grapefruit essence in the citrus dept. Very quaffable, as the citrus and malt combine for a perfectly round and smooth mouthfeel. Pine resin lingers in the finish, peppering the back of the mouth with a decent IBU. Again, the drinkability is very much the biggest ""pro"" of this brew. IPA’s are my fave (as are doubles and impy’s), and this one doesn’t disappoint. ABV doesn’t particularly show... possibly in the peppery aftereffects of the finish, there shines a note or two of alcohol, but well-integrated."
"O - A wonderful IPA. Not one of my favorites, but very nice all the same."
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer liked the candied aspect."
"Enjoy!"
"Overall: It's a hop bomb. If that's your thing, it's your beer. Any nuance in malt character or secondary qualities are buried in the bitterness. There are some pleasant floral and citrusy notes in there, too. I couldn't drink more than one of these."
"I was no less impressed from the tap, naturally. Still a great IPA."
"Overall a good IPA that was medium on the hops."
"Just a topnotch IPA, all the way. Not sure I get what about it is ""two hearted"" or how that ties into the piscine motif of the label though. A little weak in the aroma as compared to my top favorites in the style, but otherwise fantastic!"
"Overall, a solid single IPA. A go-to session beer."
"Overall - I think I really had forgotten how nice and enjoyable Two Hearted is. It's even one of those rare IPAs that I'd consider sessionable while still being very full flavored. If you like IPAs and haven't had this one, you really should!"
"O - A good IPA. The hop flavor could have been a little more complex and balanced out by more malt, but for what it is (hop-centric), its a quality brew. Would have again."
"O: Very jealous that I don't get this distributed in my area. I will have to do another trade in order to get more."
"O- Top 4 or 5 IPA's I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. A real treat. I've had it on tap as well, and that is downright A+ material."
"O: What a treat this beer is! I wish I could get this out east, but I'll have to just wait to revel in it upon my Midwestern homecomings. This would definitely be my every day IPA if it were available in NYC. I must confess, on my 5th beer of the 6 pack I have officially fallen in love with this beer."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA. The balance between the citrus and the floral hop bitterness is about perfect. The complexities of this beer and it's balance suit my palate nicely."
"O: Solid entry from Bell's Brewing, I am very excited to drinking more of their offerings."
"Overall one of the better IPA's I have had. I would say top 4?"
"O) You pretty much can't go wrong with Two Hearted Ale. It is one to just keep on hand, because it always goes down easy."
"On draft. This has the appearance of a solid pale ale: sturdy hazy copper, nice lasting, dense head. I really enjoy the floral aroma. It’s very fresh and exotic with plenty of rather pleasing outdoorsy scents. Flavor is quite well balanced between the peppery hops and smooth sweet malts, though still packs a little bit of a punch with bitterness. This is an enjoyable beer for almost any occasion."
"Bought a six pack of this beer at a local store, and was somewhat skeptical since I'm not a huge IPA fan. Wow! What a great beer! Not too much hop flavor, but just enough to give the beer a good taste and balance. Wonderful taste, color, and drinkability. This would be a great session beer, and will definitely show up in my cooler more often. Another great brew by Bell's!"
"Overall it's a very solid beer, one I'm sure I would grade higher had I tasted it on tap."
"Overall:This is the best beer I've had. I loved it and wished I could have had more. Definitely a beer I could drink several of, although at 7% abv, this one will catch up to you quicker than you expect. A delicious IPA that sets the bar very high in my opinion."
"Poured a bronze, slightly hazy color, with nice active carbonation and lacing. Smell was of piney, hoppy, citrus heaven. The taste is about the perfect combination of bitterness and cirus flavors. Nothing about either is overwhelming, but the combination is perfect together. This is an IPA lover's IPA, one that you can drink many of, and will want to drink many of. Mouthfeel is outstanding. I just wish I could buy it in MA!"
"Cheers!"
"Decent price and great availability. Better than most local IPAs that cost about the same."
"I've had hundreds of pints of this on-tap, but precisely because I can always get it on-tap. I've never had it out of a bottle. It's very similar but with slightly less energy. Big malt and hop profile in the nose and tongue, but moreso on the tongue. Classic. One of the best midwest IPAs."
"It is the beer that will remind you why you love beer in a way that you didn't even know was possible. It is the beer that will change the way you think about all of the beers you've had prior and the beer that will affect how you judge all of the beers you have afterwards. And, it is the beer that you would pick if given the metaphorical, ""if you were stranded on a desert island and could have only one..."""
"O: I'm not an IPA guy and I really like this. I can now see why so many other people like it. It has tons of flavor and nothing overpowers your taste buds. Very nice."
"Overall a very nice beer that is not overwhelming in any way but still lets the hops shine very very nicely. I can see why it is so well respected."
"O- Two-hearted is one of my standby brews. It's solid and good for any occasion. I've found that it's best with some nice hot wings and other bar food, so I usually order it when I'm out. I'm thankful that I get to enjoy this and other offerings from Bell's on a regular basis."
"O: Quite frankly what makes this beer so good is that it doesn't do just one thing amazing (as some beers strive for), it just does everything very well. The smell is great, the taste is great, the balance is perfect and it's all a super smooth combination at the same time."
"Overall I really enjoy Two Hearted for what it is, a very well balanced IPA. 60 Minute slightly beats it out in my book when i want to buy an $11 6pack of IPA, but I could alternate and be perfectly happy. That is, as long as PTE is unavailable!"
"Transparent golden body with fading white head that clings to the side of the glass. Aroma of grass, lemon rind, booze, citrus. Tastes of grass, vague pineapple, citrus with rind, lemon, bitterness comes in towards the middle and finishes warm with booze. A complex melting pot of juicy hops. Medium bodied with a cloying mouthfeel. This beer has a cult following and deserves respect for that but it falls short of a lot of IPA's."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with a finger of white foamy head that retains and laces well. The aroma has hints o piney and floral hops. The taste hits you with the piney and citrusy hop bitterness then finishes with some slight caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbed and burns slightly. Overall a great beer."
"-Cheers"
"Overall: one of the best American IPAs. If you can't buy it in your state - it's worth a road trip to stock up."
"This bottle is not quite as fantastic and smooth as I remember it being on draft in Kalamazoo, and my memory of that is probably affecting my scores right now. Its flavors aren't the most noteworthy or overwhelming, but this beer seems to do what it does pretty perfectly."
"A pretty decent IPA - I'm suspecting one of two things: this bottle has a bit of age on it, or my palate is still wrecked from two weeks of drinking in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho..."
"A great citrus-forward IPA that still maintains a great balance. Incredibly drinkable. I appreciate this treat!"
"O: So this is why everyone says ""gotta have 2 hearted fresh!"" So glad I got a chance to have this again. I put it up with the better IPA/DIPA's I've had. Although the nose is very light, it has an awesome hoppiness."
"mouthfeel - super crisp, refreshing, great amount of carbonation, medium bodied to big body for the style"
"O- I've had this beer many times, and will have it many times more. Using only centennial hops, Two Hearted Ale is proof that more is not always better, and as with master chefs, master brewers find way to coax the most out of every ingredient. Even at 2.5 months out, this bottle is damn tasty."
"O- This is the craft beer that started it all for me; I’ve had this so many times and have always forgotten to review it, just a quality beer that I will always fall back on, always reliable."
"Worth the wait--been looking forward to trying this legendary beer for a good long while. Lives up to the hype--but a touch less drying bitterness would make it just about a 9 on a 10-point scale (or 4.5 of 5) for me; it just sucks the moisture from the inside of my mouth about as completely as ""Mr. Thirsty"" does at the dentist's office."
"(Wondering if the ""Bros."" might review again to see if might be better for them now.)"
" The first couple times I tried an IPA, I didn't like it much at all, but it grew on me, and now it's one of my favourite styles, especially for summer."
"Feel is smooth, rich, finely yet amply carbonated, and medium bodied. Very good. One of my favorite single IPA's. Will be in my fridge for years to come."
"Overall- this beer is praised by most people and with this fresh version I agree. In the South Florida heat this beer is so incredibly refreshing. Check the date, buy it fresh and you will understand the lofty reviews."
"The fruitiness and sweetness are incredibly prominent, and I really have a hard time believing this is an IPA-- but that IPA bitterness is very much there at the end, and provides an interesting and welcome contrast to the first flavors. The flavor system present in this beer is incredibly complex, and while it can easily be downed in a few gulps, it really must be savored to be truly appreciated."
"O: One of the best of the style, well worth seeking out. Drink it and be happy to be alive. Cheers!"
"9.0/10"
"O: Nice bitterness and American hop profile but lacks dimension from such a light malt backbone. This is essentially hop-water but fans of West Coast IPAs will love this beer."
"O: When I’m looking for a cost efficient IPA, this is hard to beat. It has many of the characteristics of a strong IPA, but I could drink this all evening without any problem."
"3) Two hearted goes really well with cheese and fish...At least it does for me, I am no specialist in food, but I will say that I like it alot with these."
"O: Very good beer. Definitely a go to for summer days when you don't want a heavy IPA, but still want flavor to your beer."
"NOTE: I can see where people might be somewhat unimpressed by this brew, as it's not a ""huge"" beer. But in my opinion, its strength lies in its ability to maintain a ""low profile"" while boasting a 7% ABV and drinking incredibly smoothly with plenty of hop refreshness without being overly bitter or thick bodied. This would make a great (but dangerous) summer day kick-back-and-enjoy-the-day pale ale. A very solid ""A" brew here."
"Dark colored, spicy IPA. Great nose full of complex aromas, flavors are deep and intricate, with a good balance of hop bitterness, spice and floral notes, malt backbone and mild booziness. Packs a decent punch, drinkable but you might not want to have too many. Overall, a very good AIPA that keeps its flavors in beautiful harmony, doesn't overwhelm with excessive bitterness. You can really taste the subtleties of this beer. Oh Bells get thyself to New Jersey soon please!"
"This is a big, bold, well-put-together IPA that's loaded with hop flavor and deftly balanced. Probably the best example of an American IPA out of the Midwest that I've tried. Well worth going out of your way to try, especially if you can get it on tap."
"O - ok this beer is completely overrated and i do not understand how it gets the recognition it does, a dissappointment to say the least. i can say that the beer is clean but not above many in the style for me. sorry homers, lets get real with out selves"
"Very solid IPA. Aroma is sweet and citrusy. Lots of grapefruit with an initial hoppy bite that quickly fades. Medium palate. Very smooth and balanced. incredible lacing and an overall extremely creamy body and mouthfeel. An excellent IPA where you can never go wrong."
"I don't know what the big deal is about this beer. It's all hops with no balance at all. You get a little malt in the aroma, but it's all but non-existant in the taste. I'm not a fan of beers that lean too far away from balance and that makes this beer slightly above average at best."
"O--This is one of my very favorite IPAs. A great combo of tastes..and very easy to drink."
"Maybe my tastes will change down the road and I do look forward to trying it again."
"Taste is definitely hoppy, but balanced. Maybe not quite as smooth as I remembered, but still a very nice creamy mouthfeel, and absolutely drinkable with a super clean finish. This is a well-crafted beer that I still wish I could pick up anytime I wanted."
"I enjoyed this beer immensely, and would have no complaints about a steady supply of it in my fridge."
" Overall just an excellent IPA! I buy this all the time and will continue to do so."
"Overall: An excellent IPA. The first time you have Two Hearted Ale, you will wonder about all the hype. But try a different IPA and them come back to a Two Hearted and you will understand how well this beer is put together."
"MF- Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation."
"Highly recommend if fresh."
"O- Great beer, Good quality and available year round."
"O: Nice beer. This hit the spot on an evening when I wanted a balanced IPA. I will buy again. It would go great with a steak or burger."
"Overall this was a good, not great IPA. Definitely overhyped on this website without a doubt. I would buy this regularly if I had it available to me but would not go out of my way by any means."
"I like the beer… a lot. Of course, I like a lot of IPAs. I could and will drink this beer over and over again."
"When I first had a fresh bottle of Two Hearted, I became angry. Why? Because it's so damn perfect, that's why. For years I have been searching for a well-hopped, well-balanced, not over-the-top, solid IPA. This is it. This is a beer that I want in my fridge 365 days a year. My belief in this was further reinforced when I had the pleasure of acquiring a super-fresh six pack. It makes me genuinely heartbroken that I live outside of the distribution area. Someday... I will find a way to get this with minimal effort."
"This is my go to beer. At my local haunt they have an overwhelming number of beers on the menu. Any time the wait staff comes to the table and I'm unprepared to order I simply order this lovely Ale. The fruity, hoppy notes stand out and appear strong, but never overpowering."
"A near flawless IPA that places the hops in the center without aggressive and harsh overkill. One of my go-to beers which I still argue is better, not to mention cheaper, than their HopSlam."
"Enjoy!"
"The hops are bold, yet not harsh. Impeccable balance with a variety of hop flavors. Malt holds up strong as well."
"Though we may like to rate beers based on many properties, its all about the taste and this IPA is one of the best in this category. As variable as IPAs can be, this beer captures to quintessential IPA flavor. Other IPAs seem to be variations of the Two Hearted Ale. This is a recurrent beer in my frig and a personal favorite."
"Overall an amazing beer, depending on my mood I'll like it more than Hopslam--don't hate. One of my go to beers if I can't find any new stuff to try."
"O - decent hop-forward American IPA"
"Nice warm honey color. Thin head with good lacing. This beer has the a solid 5 for smell. I get citrusy hops, but as it warms, it gets even better. Imagine the wonderful smell of a summer produce market with tons of ripe melons, apples, pears. Ripe cantaloupe is very present. The taste is fresh and hoppy with some malty sweetness. Clean, dry finish. Good full bodied yet refreshing mouthfeel. Delicious. I feel the need to add that this beer seems to be EXTREMELY fresh."
"Nice, clear orange-golden color with a decent white head that lingers. The aroma of hops is strong, with notes of grapefruit and flowers, very good smelling. The flavor again has the hops forefront with some citrus and malt, finishing with floral flavors. Amazing flavor without overt bitterness, a really, really good IPA."
"Very happy to have had the chance to drink this, and I'm sure I'll seek this beer out again and again..."
"Overall -- A great easy-drinking, go-to IPA. However, freshness is especially critical with Two Hearted as the hop character falls off in a hurry. Great, but not a show-stopper."
"Overall, I would highly recommend this beer! If you like hops, and a slight bite, try this one, for sure!!!!"
"This beer pours out with a really hazy golden yearly color. The lacing is great with a nice white head. The smell of the beer is very hoppy. The taste of the beer has a nice citrusy lemon lime flavor. There is a nice light to medium body. Overall a damn good IPA all around."
"M. IPA. Medium bodied, refreshing, good bitter, dry, slightly sticky end that leaves you wanting more."
"Well constructed, easy to drink. One of the top American IPA's in my book."
"Don't know that I'd call it a hophead's nirvana per se, but if you are looking for a balanced,high-quality, refreshing, and drinkable IPA...look no further. This is one of my go-to's for sure."
"O-This is one darn good IPA that I have enjoyed many times before but this was the first time I have had the pleasure of experiencing it on tap-and it didn't disappoint."
"Overall, an excellent IPA. Could easily drink a few of these over an evening."
"This is a must have Michigan based ale. Not many beers can beat this when tasted fresh from Bell's taproom."
"Overall: Solid example of an IPA, again fresh on tap was a nice way to experience this beer. IPA’s and DIPA’s seem to be very “basic” animals, slight variations on a citrus/pine, hoppy formula."
"Overall is really good. The last one of my six pack and I just had to review it."
"Overall - A very good beer, a staple that I tend to keep in my fridge year around along with DFH 60 min."
"A great balance of sweet and bitter. Hands down what I believe to be the best American IPA in the country to date."
"O: great representation of the style and one of my consistent go to beers. this beer and sculpin are probably my 2 favorite IPA's that are available in my area. also bells bottle dates each beer so i never have to worry about getting an old batch."
"Overall: One of my all-time favorites. Highly recommended."
"O - This is a very drinkable beer and priced quite nicely too. Very refreshing during the hot summer months, but it's a nice go-to during the winter months too when you're lacking that IPA kick. Great all around example of the style."
"Beer pours a hazy golden orange with a decent sized head and a bit of lacing. Aroma is non-descript citrus a little pine and an estery fruit aroma that I can't really identify. Seemed very sweet up front but then the hops really kicked in on the back end that allowed me to come back for more. Overall a pretty good IPA that I wouldn't hesitate to have again, but there are many others I would go to first."
"M: Average carbonation and on the thin side that I would rate A in a sessionable PA but here it's a little lacking."
" It's more west coast style but with that extra, almost dry, malt kick on the back a lot of ipa's are missing."
"O- This is a very solid IPA, though it's more on the refreshing side rather than savory."
"O- A good IPA that packs a lot of bitterness and is very aromatic."
"Overall a tasty beer. Not nearly as hoppy as some imperial IPA's, but enough to be good."
"O: Love it and am happy to have regular/year round access to such a fantastic beer. Bells does beer right."
"O: This one is a great example of what Centennial hops have to offer and how they can make an IPA taste. Its pretty in your face, which might not work for all people, but I like it. If it was something I could buy in my area it would be battling away against Finestkind, and it might just win."
"Overall a excellent beer. The first from Bells I have had that lived up to the raves I have heard."
"O: My favorite regularly attainable beer - magic on a hot day"
"Overall: This beer is a very unique interpretation of an American IPA but very positively so. For anybody who loves a good solid IPA... Give this one a try! Prosit!!!"
"I really enjoyed this brew. If it were available locally, it'd easily be a go-to. New perpetual want."
"Pours a light golden hue with a good 1 inch head that quickly subdues. The aroma isn't overly strong but I do get light citrus notes along with dry hay. The taste follows the aroma and doesn't really step forward in any specific aspect. It starts off with the bitterness from the hops and it pretty much never leaves. There is some light grapefruit which lingers around and just a touch more would be great. I like the way this one finishes with just a bit of mild bitter/dryness but still nice and crisp. Very drinkable but to me this just doesn't bring home the style. I like it, but it is not something I would purchase regularly... not that I can get this in Texas anyway."
"O: Summer beer at its best. It's not super-complex, but I don't feel that's what it was meant to be. I’ll definitely be seeking out more Centennial hops-based offerings in the future, though. To be honest, I wish it had a lower ABV. I would make this a session favorite if it were under 5%."
"Yum!"
"Two hearted is a slightly hazy copper orange color in my Sierra Nevada hop glass, there is some visible carbonation. After the pour the beer had a 3/4 inch cream head and as I drink it leaves sticky lacing. The smell of this beer is absolutely spectacular, I caught whiffs of orange before I was able to get the cap all the way off my bottle. The dominant smell is the citrus hops, but I think I am catching some floral hops as well. The taste starts with a slight sweetness, in the middle of my tongue I get a bit of pine flavor, finally as I swallow the beer I get a strong grapefruit bitterness. This grapefruit lingers into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel for this beer is just where it should be. Overall, the only negative I can see about this beer is that I can't get it at the supermarket."
"Edit 3 - I had a chance to try a cask-conditioned version of this beer recently. It still tasted like Bell's Two-Hearted, but the aggressive hop character was replaced by a mellow complexity and more well-rounded flavor. The sharp citrus-like notes were gone. In their place were more subtle, herbal, tea-like notes that complemented a faint, fruity flavor in the background. It was a very refreshing beer that I wish I could try again sometime."
"Poured from bottle into an American shaker. Pours a copper color with a nice head with good retention. A nice hoppy floral aroma that leads to a delicious balance of malty sweetness with an assertive bitterness. Nice coronation and mouthful and overall a really terrific beer."
"Amber copper with a nice head. Intense hop aroma, pine and citrus aroma, very North American hop profile. Strong bitterness, perhaps distracting from body of the beer. Finished clean. Some more complexity in the malting would be nice, balance? There is a good hop finish in flavor, but it goes to quickly because of over bitterness."
"O: awesome beer, glad i finally tried it. will definatly buy more. and highly recommend."
"O: Great beer. I can see what all the fuss is about. Highly suggest this beer if you have been snubbing your nose up at your local liquor store. My GF pointed out that the art looks ""camo"". I can see what she means, but that is not how I see it. The artwork for this beer is so simple, yet so original and unique."
"Pours a hazy amber orange with a nice head. Intense hop aroma, resiny pine and citrus aroma. Strong bitterness, again, pine, citrus, and a hint of grapefruit to the body of the beer. Finishes clean and dry. I find this beer maybe a little too dry on the malt body, but I am a little picky when it comes to bitter hoppy beers. I prefer from the bottle than to the tap on this one. Drink on a hot and muggy day, you will surely be rewarded."
"A great American IPA that I'll gladly get again. Something to drink around the holidays thanks to that piney fragrance and taste. Definitely in my top 10 of the style."
"D: Awesome. Could have a couple easily. Great IPA"
"D- Overall, one of the great American IPAs. This is a world-class beer in one of the most competitive styles in the US today. Artfully crafted and undeniable."
"Overall, what a great IPA. It packs a sizable hops punch but is well balanced and very tasty. One of my go to American IPAs."
"Overall - picked up from my good buddy spinrsx and i love him for it! what a fantastic beer, offers so much and I can drink 10 of them. one of the best IPA's around."
"O- While this isn't a bad beer to have, I don't quite get all the raves. As I mentioned, I can I have tried in bottles and draft, but I'm never blown away by it. I'm not against buying a pint here and there, but there are usually several other offerings in the places I go that I would choose first."
"Scent is a fruit cocktail - ripe pear, peach and some apple. The hops impart a grapefruit taste with a piney sharpness that is notciable but not overwhelming. A strong malt backbone is present to give a nice balance. A biscuity taste is subtly present throughout, but comes through most in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full and rich. Wonderfully balanced, complex, and very enjoyable. Sadly, I only had one on hand. Can't wait to have another one."
"Overall-Painfully average. I wanted to really like this beer. I got one once as an extra a few months back and didn't like it much then. Then bought a sixer of it while in Indiana for DLD and same result now."
"Overall – This is probably one of the most drinkable beers I’ve ever had.. after every sip I just wanted more and more. The flavours are perfectly balanced and it came across as very clean and crisp. I find most IPA’s a little too sugary sweet to have a few of them in during one sitting.. but this one is flavoured perfectly."
"Drinkability is good. Definitely better than the first time I've had it, must've been a bad bottle. This one was a little flat but when I had it last week, it was better. Going to have to get this on tap to really judge this beer."
"This is a go-to beer for me. Alot of flavor and does not try to overpower."
"Taste-Here is where this brew really opens up. Flavor by the tons! Piney bitterness that blends really well with crisp, light malty notes. Dried Apricot comes through in the finish and most of the character expresses itself in the back half of the palate. Perfect carbonation is also noteworthy here."
"Overall. I have had this many times in the past but haven't had the chance to review it. I found a sixer of batch 10337 (bottled April 20th 2011) and was so happy to have such a fresh offering, but I don't think this stands up to any high end IPA. Maybe I'm having an off night. I will save the other 5 for a later taste. If they are better then this one I edit my review accordingly."
"O- this is a text book American Ipa. Balance of malt and strong hop flavor. Perfect hoppy aroma, and little aftermath. Very good."
"I've passed over this a lot in the bottle shop (simply because I didn't know who made it, etc) and now I'm kicking myself for it. I could have been drinking this a long time ago. It might become one of my favorites. Time will tell."
"O: Great beer for the price will be revisiting again soon."
"I think I've had this beer about a thousand times. One of my 3-4 goto beers until the price increase and it still find itself in my fridge more often than it probably should with Columbus IPA around. Fresh on tap. Pours a golden orange body with a beautiful cream colored head. Smell is evertything you could hope for in an IPA. Just punches you in the face with piney/citursy hops. Taste is much the same, a little bit of fruit, a little bit of citrus and a lot of pine, leaving a wonderful bitterness on the palate."
"M - Extremely drinkable. Nice carbonation. Not too thick or sweet, but a dry finish that leaves me craving the next sip!"
"O--This is one of my top 5 favorite IPAs. If it were more readily available it would be a fridge staple. It is definitely something I will be seeking out in the future."
"The appearance is clear and light orange hued. The head stands in at around an inch thick, displays lasting retention and leaving ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is not particularly grand, but is pleasant nonetheless. Scents include malt, floral notes, light pine. The flavor is tasty, and though the beer is primarily hop forward, it definitely has a strong malt backbone. This is a good example of what I would consider a ""balanced"" IPA. Though I prefer beers of this ilk to be lighter on the palate and more hop forward with a pronounced citrus component, there is no denying that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a tasty brew. Additionally, I think this beer, like many IPAs, is a notch better on draft versus the bottle."
"Overall this is a good IPA, definately for the hop heads"
"O-Had yesterday and then again today side by side (blind) with Flower Power. Flower Power was better but this beer is still solid. Lacking the earthy tones present in IPA, but almost nailed the citrus and floral flavors."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a creamy finger of head into a tulip. Nose has some nice bready malts, good spicy citrus, bright pine along with hints of tropical fruits (maybe some guava). Taste starts with a refreshing hop bitterness along with some mild bready malts and pine with light citrus. Finishes a bit oily, nice body and mouthfeel if a bit muted on the nose and taste."
"O: Very pleasant drinking, would definitely seek this out again."
"A very well done IPA, and if it were distributed near me would no doubt be a staple in my fridge."
"NOTE: I had this late one night at Big Hunt and I may have been slightly drunk."
"O: Excellent beer. Taste and smell excite you when first trying this beer. Haven't had it in a long time (for some reason, kicking myself now)."
"There really isn't much left to say, I love this beer. It's flavorful but not overwhelming, and has a great blend of hop flavors and aroma. The only criticism I can come up with is that there's the slightest touch of either metallic or phenolic taste, barely enough to notice. While sometimes this can be a welcome addition to the mix of flavors, in this case I didn't feel that it added anything. Still, this was a very minor issue for me, and for a standard IPA this is one of the best I've had. I imagine this beer is even better fresh, I don't know how old it is, but I know that it's at least from January. All things considered, it has held up rather well."
"The feel is good. Nice light body with lively carbonation. A little drying. Overall a nice offering from Bell's. A well made IPA that delivers nicely. I'd welcome more of these in my refridgerator."
"Moderate carbonation, easy to drink. Seemed to get better the more I drank. A nice clean, crisp drink."
"Solid example of the American IPA style with plenty of hop bitterness and a well-founded malt backbone. A go-to choice were it something I could buy here in the Bay Area."
"Overall, an excellent session beer that goes well even on its own."
"O- I have not loved many Midwest or East Coast IPAs, but I really enjoyed this one. I am glad I traded for a sixer and not just a single. I also love the trout artwork on the bottle and carrier."
"Bought from the shit-hole Chain Grocer down the street and poured (sloppily) into a mason jar mug. Lookin' nice and orangey, apricot with a big crazy froth head from my shloppy pour. Mad Lace, Son. Nose is all citrus and pequito pine with sweet enticing honeysuckle on a warm breeze type notes. Tastes great on many levels, refreshing, palate teasing, balanced yet a little boozy (just like I prefer my women). I really enjoy this beer and plan on drinking most of this six with a seared skirt steak over baby greens and chimichurri. Best. Bells. Ever."
"Overall, this is a satisfying beer. Right up there with 5 barrel as my favorite pale ale. Glad I bought it."
"O - A wonderful IPA. I've seen this on the shelf at local grocery/liquor stores for a while but hadn't picked it up until today ... kicking myself that I didn't try this sooner."
"Not an overly complex beer but it's got to be one of the most drinkable beers ever, especially for having a 7% ABV. Really goes down easy. Would be a great way to introduce a rookie to good beer."
"Would have liked to try this fresh, but even after several months in the bottle, this is a great beer. Looking forward to a fresh bottle in the future."
"O: Sorry, I dont get it."
"O-> Could really see myself sitting on the front porch looking out at the ocean enjoying this brew. Great representation of the style however, as with many beers, not sure I get all the hype surrounding this one. Doesn't mean I didn't like it or that it isn't a good beer, because it is. Just couldn't get past the fact that it tasted and smelled faintly stale or somewhat dated even though it was barely 5 weeks in the bottle...will be trading for more of this, hopefully a little closer to it's bottling date."
"D: A great beer, and one I return to frequently if I could get this in Cali. Not to mention my last name is the same as the Name."
"OVERALL: This brew has just redeemed Bell’s in my book. Up to this point, everything I’ve had form them has been just alright, but this one, however, is world class. Easily the best Bell’s I’ve had to date, and probably one of the best IPAs in the field. Lots of flavor and aroma, and a great look and feel to support it. This is a year-round brew apparently, and I can see why. Thanks again Pixieskid. Recommended."
"Overall: Not a bad IPA and worth a sit down during a hot day."
"Taste is piney hops throughout. strong bittering hops in the end. Dry and sharp orange peel taste hits entire mouth in the after taste. some minor medicinal notes toward the end as well. Still, a good unbalanced IPA flavor but I've had better."
" A perfect representation of an American IPA."
"12oz bottle. Batch 10207 (packaged 02/09/11)."
"Highly recommend this beer."
"O: this was my first Bell's beer and I was pretty impressed; very drinkable and not to overbearing, yet satisfying enough for your average hop-head"
"Overall - Recommendation high; a columniation of wondrous flavors wrapped into an ABV of lucky number seven"
"O: Overall it's a nice, well balanced IPA. I would drink it again or order it on tap if I saw it."
"Too bad I have never seen it in New Jersey"
"Poured into pilsner glass. Nice golden color with white head. Can smell the hops and citrus notes. Taste good hops presence along with citrus and some pine. Very brisk ipa with a slight bitter finish. You will be hard pressed to find a better ipa. This is my ""go to"" ipa....just now decided to sit down and review it. Excellent ipa at a very good price."
"Overall this is an outstanding IPA and the bells crew has once again not let me down. This IPA is a little more bitter than expected but was welcomed and I will most definatly visit this tasty experience once again."
"Overall this is a good summer beer. It is light, crisp, and dry on the finish. A good thirst quencher on a hot day. Where this beer falls a little short for me is in the hop profile. It is a little too bitter and I would like a little more citrus to come through."
"If 2-Hearted was a local to me it would be in my fridge alot to say the least. Some great drinking IPA! Tradesies are the best."
"Batch 10234, no date notable."
"Overall- A hophead’s dream, lots of bitter hop flavours with a sweetness from the grapefruit in there and mild malts as well. One of Bell’s better offerings, a definite go to when shopping for beers in Michigan."
"The code on the bottle was 10207. Was that over a year ago?"
"This is not a knock your socks off IPA for the extreme hophead and it's not intended to be such. Overall Two Hearted Ale is higly drinkable and enjoyable. One great goto IPA if you have access in your area (which I don't). I should've bought a case...damn."
"Overall- Bell's has always brewed many great ones and have had this several times @ the iTap House in Chesterfield, MO. This is a well balanced and great American IPA. Will be enjoyed soon but not more than 2 in a night. This is where they fall short... with their Drinkability. Couldn't be the ABV's, but something with the hop character being so strong."
"Overall: A very tasty IPA that has great balance in the bitterness and sweetness."
"D - A supremely balanced beer. This is a great stand by that is good any time. I like it better as it warms because the malt becomes more evident and counteracts the hops that show better when cold."
"Overall, pretty good but not over the top as far as IPAs go. Good balance throughout for some nice tastes."
"D - solid IPA. Big on flavor and easy to drink."
"D - Well balanced brew, definitely one you could drink more than a single. Crisp and very tasty"
"Pours a brilliant clear gold with a frothy half inch head. Lots of carbonatation. Hefty hops hit the nose first, with lots of pine and grass characteristics. Mild cereal malt fills out the rest of the aroma, filling in the cracks left by the hops. Moderate carbonation, good mouthfeel, nice hop bitterness in the finish. Taste is hop forward, but there's a nice subtle malt sweetness that helps balance things out. The body of the beer is lightly syrupy, though the heavy carbonation helps keep it from being overpowering or cloying. Overall it's a very solid and very drinkable example of the American IPA style."
"O: Very tasty. Would definitely recommend."
"Although I am not a hophead, I found this beer to be a pleasant surprise. It's not in my wheelhouse, but can see why it is a highly regarded brew. Lots to like here. I could drink a couple of these, then probably need to switch off."
"Poured this american IPA out of a 12 oz bottle and into a pint glass. The AIPA poured a hazy golden color and produced a nice thick 2 finger width head. Head retention on this beer is excellent and the lacing is one of the best I have seen. The aroma is nice and hoppy, a little above average for an AIPA. There were some notes of citrus. The taste of the beer is a little watery- Its a little weak with the amount of malt. Light body, it makes it a very drinkable IPA but I dont really look for that in an IPA. After the thinness subsides, there is a pronounced hop bite, but it does not linger. The finish has hints of citrus and it is slightly dry. Overall there is nothing special about this beer- does not come close to my top ten list of IPAs. But hey..its not like Bells makes a Kolsh right?"
"O: A very good IPA. Very enjoyable to have with several types of heavier and creamier flavors such as steaks and rich alfredo sauces and such. It also packs the perfect ABV in my opinion, not too strong, but definitely high enough to help a heavy drinker catch a buzz if one is wanted. All things considered, I'd still choose a Hop Devil."
"Just a perfect balance of sweet and bitterness. Doesn't have that hoppy finish leading to palate fatigue common in many IPAs. Wonderful."
"Overall, it is probably the tastiest beer that I have had so far that I can actually find that is less than $10 per six pack. It makes me crave hopslam or the pliny's."
"This beer is very tasty overall. Could be amped up on the citrus/tropical fruit characteristics, but the alcohol is super well hidden, and it's very drinkable."
"Overall: Very good beer that I will definitely purchase again. It sits relatively light and is easy to drink."
"Hazy golden w/ off white 3 finger head. Nice healthy dose of sediment. Pretty complex right from the smell. Pine, orange, grepefruit. Not much malt coming through all that hop smell. Tastewise... probably the best balance I've seen in an IPA so far. Floral hop is the star feature, but the pine comes through as well & not shampooey at all as I feared it might be. It's bold, sweet and finishes w/ a pleasant dryness. Mouthfeel is almost creamy with a nice thickness to it. I'd highly recommend it to IPA lovers."
"I was lucky enough to find this on tap at a local bar and I'm glad that my first taste of this was on tap. There was a great hazy golden body with a nice inch and a half head that stuck around a bit with all the carbonation. The aroma of citrus, flowers and a small hint of honey were strong. First taste hit the hops first, but not overpowering, felt balanced a noticed a bit on the sweetness / honey at the end, and made me really want more. Very smooth and easy to drink several in one sitting. Its not as flashy as some of the other hyped IPA's, its just an all around great beer."
"O: I loved this beer. It had an incredibly unique malt and hop profile that mixed extremely well with the light body. Very drinkable. Like a grapefruit glazed scone..but not too sweet...in a good way."
"an easy session ipa for any hophead, definatly better than you average. i enjoyed this very much, and it would definatly be a staple if it was available in my area."
"(7/31/11)-Exactly 4 months later had a fresher bottle and just as good. Mouthfeel was alot creamier and the aroma was definitely more floral. Solid Beer, wish I could have this at my local beer store."
"O- Awesome and probably my #1 IPA, reviewed this from a bottle but have had it fresh at the brewery and its even better then, I recommend this to anyone and usually have a few in my fridge to prove it to people."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and enjoyable. Quite crisp and refreshing this is always a standby brew that is enjoyable on nearly any occasion."
"The moutfeel is good, light bodied, and pretty refreshing. It's pretty smooth and has a slightly earthy finish, but overall clean. A pretty drinkable IPA, but gets better if you slow down and let it warm up. All in all it's a very good IPA, I've heard a lot of good things about this beer and I think it's pretty good. I'd like to have it a little more accessible to me to give it more of a chance, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to drink and review Two Hearted Ale."
"O: This is the king of the regular IPA (IMO, didn't taste them all). This is, again IMO, better than Blind Pig. Although Blind Pig was really good, it was only hops and some sweetness that would make the overall beer taste more ""juicy"" (IOW, giving the sugar to the hops to make the beer taste more like exotic fruits). Extremely drinkable, I cannot recommend this enough. I can't imagine how good it must be when it is really fresh."
" Should I try a fresher bottle or hunt out a place that has it on draught maybe? It was not skunked, had no freshness date so I have no way of knowing if the hop flavor just faded or what was going on, but there was no hint of hops flavor after the very initial touch of the beer on my tongue. Overall, this was a huge disappointment for me. Maybe if I find it on draught and I know it is fresh I would give it another review."
"O - A great IPA from a great brewery; a balanced counterpoint of malt and hops. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"O: Overall this is a solid beer but not one that blew me away. Nice and balanced, light and delicious. I could easily put away a few of these in a sitting."
"wow this beer seems to be about all one could ask for...thanks bells for makeins such a taste-full beer to enjoy with so many things like sunshine or moonlight you know although i find that 3 is the limit after 3 they seem to heavy imagain that ha ha ha"
"O) This is what I want in an American IPA. Enough malt to provide balance but it is in the background. So good. So good. I'd like to come back and re-review because I don't think the head got a fair shake."
"Other Thoughts: my favorite beer as of posting this review. i haven't found anything that has beat it yet. i'm also a amateur when it comes to reviewing beer, but i can tell the difference between a good and bad beer to a certain extent."
"Overall: If it were available to me normally I would likely make it a regular. I did try it side by side with Founders Centennial IPA a few weeks back, I liked Two Hearted better and Founders is a semi regular in my fridge. Seek it out, it did not blow me away but it certainly is a great IPA."
"The way people rave about this beer I'd love to try it again and see if my palette was off tonight."
"D: Excellent taste, smell, mouthfeel, and appearance, hard to go wrong with a Two Hearts."
"I've been waiting a while to try this, and I have to admit, it didn't knock my socks off. That said, it is an enjoyable IPA, and I would never mind having one."
"O overall I am so glad i have these. I need to trade for some more for sure."
"O: this is an outstanding ipa. one of my favorites really good."
"O - Overall one of the best IPAs around. Comes close to Sculpin, but not quite. For less than 2 bucks a bottle it's fantastic. Goes down easy and is an exciting and dynamic beer to drink. A lot of flavor and a brilliant aroma make this beer a classic. If I had access to it, it'd be a staple in my fridge."
"I think it's safe to say the greatness of this beer is directly corrolated with the craftsmanship it took to create this long lasting delcious carbonization."
"It's good, draft or bottle. I'd describe it as a beginner's ipa because the hops are masked by the honey (as they are in Hopslam, just less pronounced). Yeah, it's good, but there are plenty of other better ipa's out there - assuming you're a hophead. Just depends on if you wanna take off the training wheels..."
"O: This wasn't as bitter as the IPAs I've been drinking recently, so it was a nice change of pace. A great beer that I could definitely see getting again."
"O- Had fresh, this beer is quite lovely. It is what I look for in an American IPA and always consistent, never disappoints."
"Two Hearted Ale does not disappoint. I heard a lot about this beer before I tried it. I understand why it carries such a likable reputation. To be widely accepted, I think you have to have a fairly non-offensive taste. This leaves out any wacky nuance that you might find in other beers. I think this is a crowd pleasing staple. I liked the golden orange pour and two fingers of head. The flavor was hops and citrus, but not overpowering. This could almost be described as an aggressive pale ale. All of the quality that you expect is in this beer, and I will be coming back to this one."
"This pours a slightly hazy copper with a nice, two finger white head that leaves good frothy lace around. On the nose there is a huge mixture of oranges, grapefruit, fresh cut grass, and a hint of a caramel backbone. This nose is unrealIn the mouth there are grapefruits and oranges hanging out over a malt background that never gets in the way. It's balanced very much towards the citrus bomb part of the IPA spectrum, but it's still balanced. Later some spice and bitterness that hangs with a fuzzy finish. It's a medium body, thin enough to not stick at the sides of the palate, but the huge hop presence means it's a long finish. This is a truly great IPA, a desert island type beer, and it's available all year round in a large chunk of the country."
"Pours a nice translucent gold, almost tangerine color with one finger white head. Very little retention and spotty lacing. Smell is citrus hops with a touch of sweet raw honey. Nice citrusy hop profile in the taste. Good mouthfeel - a rather refreshing IPA. I think this is a tweener IPA - in between the big west coast hop bombs and balanced east cost IPAs."
"Mouthfeel is a perfect match to the taste, as it is light while offering enough fullness to back up the flavors. One of the better balanced beers I've had, and this allows it to be incredibly drinkable as well. Great beer aside from the unneeded pine."
"Great Job, Bells!"
"D- This is a delicious IPA that has its set of mood swings. Every sip seems to bring a different feel. If this were available around me i would consume this regularly."
"D: Definitely my favorite brew of a style that I'm slowly beginning to appreciate. Several of these can definitely be enjoyed in a session."
"Overall: Awesome. One of my favorite beers; it's hard to find a fault in it. A go-to for me and a must try for those who enjoy IPAs."
"Hoppy Delight. Only the price keeps this as an occasional beer."
"This is one of my favorites! When it was on sale for $6.99 at Big Red for a month, I probably bought 30 six-packs! It also makes a bad-ass black and tan. Way better than Bass and Guiness, and my last name is Bass. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Great look, taste, buzz, everything!"
"Overall, this is just a great beer. It has a significant malt character which some might not enjoy, but overall you can never go wrong drinking a Two Hearted."
"I can't break a beer down like the majority of the reviewers on here...I'm learning...it'll get better...I just know I love this beer."
"D- This is a great drinking IPA. One of the best bittering IPA's I've had but it doesn't abandon the malt bill. I'll be looking for this one more often, would love to find this on tap somewhere. I actually enjoyed this more so then Hopslam."
"Drunkability: Wouldn't have a problem tipping a few of these back but it would not be my first choice for an ipa. The taste is missing something, just a bit too dull maybe."
"D- this is one of my favorite IPA's, one that hopheads will definitely love, this is a great session IPA for me although they can catch up on you"
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth."
"D-rediculosuly drinkable, awesome!"
"T: Near perfect balance between some citrus hops and malts. Pineapple, grapefruit, citrus hops and a bit of funk as it warms. Really tasty."
"D- this might be one of the most drinkable ipas out there. I could and regularly do put down 4-5 of these no problem. If you like ipas you could drink this all day and all night till you pass out."
"D - Excellent drinkability. I like this beer a lot and I wish that it was available near me!"
"could drink this all day long on draft. as is case with many IPAs, much better fresh off the tap than out of the bottle. I believe it's genius is in it's subtlety... and in an over-the-top American craft beer scene, that's not easy to do."
"D- Not a top on my list, but a good choice for somebody trying to get a good american IPA."
"Drink: Somewhat under whelmed in general, but would be a good starter beer for introduction to APA/IPAs."
"Very good, easily accessible and affordable beer. One of the best craft beers in Michigan and it is available everywhere around that area. Bell's Expedition Stout is also a good one to try, although slightly less common, at least on tap. Maybe Michigan should shift its manufacturing from cars to beer. They seem to do pretty well on the beer end."
"All aspects of this beer make it a top model for the style. Taste and smell are perfect. Love the grapefruity citrus notes perfectly balanced against the malt sweetness. Hopslam's little brother and one of my favorite beers. When the Hopslam is gone...this replaces it!"
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. I think it is very well balanced and I'll definitely come back to it."
"D- This is a good easy to drink IPA and really happy that I got to try it! I would not drink this all the time if I could buy it near me, but definitely would try to work it into trades if the other person had some to trade."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a slightly hazy orange-gold coloring with about two fingers of big-bubbled, airy, light white head. There is a heavy, fresh green hoppy and cedar aroma to it. In mouth, the beer has a smooth, sweet citrus foundation with green, bitter hops blooming into your tastebuds. Grapefruit highlights keep everything very well balanced. There is a quick, smooth finish, with bitter hops and very slight citrus balanced aftertaste. Extremely tasty, and the beers disappeared rather quickly from my fridge."
"Another tasty one from Bell's as always. It's very good for the price and always available. Good stuff."
"Lovely! After a day of tastings, even with a fatigued palate and a fuzzy head, this stood head and shoulder above everything else. A big, silky, orangey, compulsively drinkable IPA."
"Pours to a cloudy golden amber with a nice, one-finger head. A flavorful beer that is heavy on the hops, with a nicely balanced level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice, with the hops and bitterness. A very crisp beer that you'll enjoy if you consider yourself a ""hophead."""
"Not as asserive with the hops as I remember. Good hop bitterness, but nothing crazy. Maybe all the other BIG IPAs have spoiled (?) me, but this one is kind of underwhelming."
"Really like this beer. Nice aroma when i poured it from the bottle to the glass. Thought it tasted awesome, good beer for someone just starting to make the transition into the craft side of the world in my opinion. Very drinkable with a nice after taste."
"T. Very nice hoppy beer. There is a dark berry fruitiness to it and it's quite bubbly. The hops give it a good kick."
"D - Hmm... This one is kinda hard to call for me. I'm pretty impressed by this particular tasting, but I remember barely being able to finish the other two. It seemed like they were just liquid hop oil. Not much flavor too much bitterness. By this tasting I'm intrigued to try it yet again if given the opportunity, but it is just a little too pungent and I don't think I will be actively seeking it out."
"D - The ABV is right about where I want most beers. After two you're feeling in just a tad but you can still fully enjoy it. I really like this beer as a solid go to IPA, an excellent representation of the style. I'd buy this as often as I could find it. I wish Bell's was in MD. I can only hope that they will in the future."
"Well, you can probably guess after this gushing review that I think Two Hearted is drinkable. And you're right. My only critique would be that T.H. that is this fresh would just wreck my palate and leave it in a sloppy mess after two or three of them. That's just the price one has to pay for fresh, hoppy beer, though. One of my all-time favorites and an IPA that I will be enjoying until I die."
"Cheers"
"Pours a yellowish gold with a lot of frothy head. Nice lacing and good head retention. Looks pretty. Smells citrusy and hoppy. Lots of grapefruit on the nose. Tastes similar... Nice floral and citrus balance. Well carbonated and very drinkable. A top notch brew!"
"Got this one from Trader Joe's in Madison last weekend. This will definitely not be the last time I have this beer. Fantastic IPA in my opinion. Poured a slightly cloudy light copper color with very little head. Great hop aroma. Taste is fantastic. Plenty of hops but very well balanced and easy to drink. Very smooth. I will be looking for this one again very soon."
"Finally, the beer had a smooth yet slightly bitter taste to it with a fruity after taste and long hop finish."
"This is a beer I go to a out of my way to get on tap. Good hoppy sweet smell and dark amber color. Head laces around the glass and sticks around for most of the beer. The alchol is mildly present. Good drinkability not one of pound-able beer though, meant to be enjoyed."
"Nice head."
"Overall, a very solid IPA. Haven't had enough kinds to determine if it is one of my favorites or not. Still very enjoyable."
"I love this beer. It is one of my favorite IPA's. It pours a golden color with moderate head. The citrus hop aroma is extremely pleasant. The initial taste is nice and bitter and then the citrusy hops take over. The aftertaste is also very pleasant. I love the hop character of this beer. It is not an overwhelmingly hoppy IPA. It is one of the easier drinking IPA's on the market and I hope the distribution reaches New Hampshire soon."
"D - Very smooth for a 7%er... one of my favorite IPA's... other than my homebrew, of course!"
"D: Enjoyed this one from beginning to end. Easy to drink for 7% with plenty of hops."
"Should be a staple in any hop lovers beer diet"
"A bit more balanced and drinkable than hopslam, although that comparison would be per the brewery and not per style, since hopslam is a double. Still, this is a nice beer that I really enjoyed (although truth be told, I really liked hopslam too)."
"I'd heard a lot of hype on this beer, and overall I'd say it wasn't a letdown but I don't see myself craving this anytime soon."
"A very good AIPA but something irks me about it a bit. The malt seems to be a bit too big and can be overpowering as the beer warms, giving the beer a slightly odd taste. That said it is very well balanced and drinks well, especially when it is colder."
"D - great with food, fried fish, burgers etc...."
"great drink ability...good session beer"
"I think that this beer is the best balance that I have seen between a traditional ipa and heavy hopped West Coast ipa. So far to me, it is the ultimate in regards to drinkability as far as American ipa's go."
"D: This one is very easy to find, nicely priced, and very ""yummy."" A great American IPA that makes this one extremely easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"D-Bought this thinking it was going to be a drainpour..was told it was really hoppy and tried this back when i didn't like IPA's but this beer surprized me. Very Drinkable for an Ipa and its bitterness and citrus combine great and neither overpower each other. Id get this beer again and again"
"Like I said very well balanced. Not much head. Smell was perhaps a little lacking. But a very pleasing beer. I'm glad I bought a six pack. For my hophead friends I'll do penance later with a Double Dog."
"Thanks"
"D - Very nice, a great combination of the hops/malt plus Bells' house yeast makes this a homerun of an American IPA."
"Great Ipa orange color with a nice white head. Not a lot of classic IPA smells going on here. Great bitterness on the tounge with an outstanding malt balance. Resin oils and sweet apricots abound. This is a great tasting Ipa with exceptional balance. Would like to session these very soon."
"D: Perfect balance between flavor and weight."
"D - I could drink this every day. One of the easiest drinking IPA's on the market. My go to beer when good beer is in short supply."
"This was a typical good IPA. Having had Bell's Hopslam and enjoying it so much, I am rather jaded drinking other beers. This one had good scent, bite, and flavor but is just missing that extra bit to put it over the top. Bell's still remains a top brewery and is yet to disappoint me."
"I tend to take this beer for granted. I don't drink it nearly as much as I should. What sets this one apart from other IPAs is the flavors and balance. Pure winner from Bell's!"
"Overall: This is the standard no-coast IPA. Bitter, but never puckering; sweet but never cloying. A must try for any hophead."
"100th review!"
"A great IPA that doesn't slap you in the face with hops. It's very well balanced, and at a ABV that should have it in the imperial IPA range. A lovely beer for a cold, snowy night."
"D: I am not in love with this beer. However, it is a great go to IPA which is highly drinkable. Decent price too!"
"How can you not like this beer? Seriously -- it has good fruit, nice acidity, a lovely perfumed aroma, and a crisp, clean, long-lasting finish! This is the craft-beer generations go-to brew. I can only imagine how lovely this would be with Jerk Chicken, maybe some spicy enchiladas, etc. I'm so glad I took the time to review this ale..."
"D-Easy drinking beer for IPA lovers."
"Another success for Bells. Their lineup isn't perfect but still stands out as one of the top breweries in my opinion. I hate it when they place sixers of TH in the case beside sixers of DFH 60-min because it forces me to buy both. And at ten bucks, who wouldn't?"
"D: Due to the citrus juiciness, this is probably the best IPA I've ever had."
"For instance... you guys do realize theres a reason you can get a 24 pack of keystone light for 13$ right??? the answer being the lack of quality"
"This is a highly sessionable IPA, I love it."
"Nice blend of hops and sweetness making for a great beer to drink on a weekend night. The initial flavor is a bit hoppy but not in an overwhelming way. Nice color, taste, smell and aftertaste. I would highly recommend this beer with a nice slice of pizza or a good cheese. I am extremely impressed with the smoothness of the taste of a hoppy beer."
"had it fresher before, but overall an outstanding standard ipa."
"This is not my favorite of the IPA's, but it is excellent and worth every penny."
"d-its taken me a long time to try this one out because of how common it is. yet i really really enjoy this ipa and will drink this one frequently now"
" Quite a well crafted IPA. I generally prefer more enamel peeling pine and resin, but that's personal preference. I have always enjoyed drinking this beer. It's a good gateway beer for non-craft people too, have converted a few with this one."
"I'd like to try a fresher version of the beer - this one was bottled about nine months ago. At the end of the day it's still good and will always have a special place in my heart, but it makes me sad that it doesn't stack up with IPAs I've had since then."
"D: A great beer, and one I return to frequently. While I love the bitter qualities of this beer in a glass or two, that's usually enough for me to have my fill, even if I'll be back next week for more."
"D: This is a nicely balanced beer, not a trace of alcohol. Starts off sweet and finishes bitter and drinks really smooth and crisp. Not sure if having a Hopslam beforehand hurt the scoring or not, but it is good nonetheless."
"D: Really enjoy the beer, as a relative noob to craft beer, I can see from this example what all the buzz is about. Will have another...now!"
"D: Best American IPA I have had to date. Great beer any time, any place."
"drinkability: fabulous drinkability this beer is a staple of mine.great example of ipa great value"
"Poured into my dfh snifter, pours an opaque orange-ish hue, with about 2 fingers of frothy head that subsides after about a minute. Limited lacing left on the glass. Smell- pineapple, orange peel, tropical fruit. Taste- hops are present but not bitter, and the taste is sweet and floral-like. It is highly drinkable- if I missed anything in this beer, I wanted more biting hops more than the tropical fruit flavors present here. But, it was a very good beer, and I could see easily making a session out of it."
"DRINKABILITY: This brew exceeded my expectations. I definitely would seek it out for a later treat. It was refreshingly hoppy, just the way an American IPA should be."
"D: Well balanced, affordable, and very easy to drink, Bell's Two Hearted Ale goes down as a quality example of the India Pale Ale style in my books. However, it strength is also a bit of its weakness in my opinion as it really doesn't deviate much from the norm. Nevertheless, it is more drinkable than your standard India Pale Ale due to its more pleasant (less acerbic) finish than you will find in some."
"Overall impression: Perhaps there's batch variation, but this didn't seem to have the same ""pop"" I remember from having it on tap. Still, a very nice fruity IPA that's easily recommended."
"Thank you for creating this gold standard!"
"D: A pretty drinkable IPA. There's a nice amount of pine and bitter citrus flavor in there, but the bitterness doesn't overwhelm the palate, making it easy to drink several in a sitting. Overall, one of the better regularly available IPAs out there."
"D: super drinkable. i see what the rave is about. a really solid brew and this is definitely going on my list of fav's for AIPA's."
"Drink- A pretty good IPA. Was expecting more flavor but was pretty good."
"Drinkability: This is my ""go to"" IPA at the local draft house, great IPA in this respect."
"Having had Hopslam and Two Hearted Ale on back to back nights, I think I prefer the balance of Two Hearted Ale."
"Overall, the drinkability is very nice. It isn't my favorite IPA, but it is a good one. I would have no problem having 2 of these just about any time."
"A decent IPA, but I wouldn't come back to it unless mine is subpar."
"D-its not the best tasting IPA, but its one of the better drinking IPAs i've had. what decent tastes it does possess, it keeps through out the bottle. the ABV is between lower and higher, but it drinks like a lower ABV brew. I bet I could get sick on any BMC beer before I got sick on this."
"This beer pours a hazy light golden orange color with a half finger of white foam on the surface. The aroma is mainly earthy hop notes leaning more towards the piny spectrum than the citrus. The flavor however deviates into having much more of the citrus hop flavor. I'm fairly certain this hop character is on it's way down from ones I've had in the past, but the hops are still quite there. The mouthfeel on this is rather smooth for an IPA and there is hardly any bitterness to be found. I must say this is rather enjoyable to drink, I would like sitting outside and relaxing with one of these, except it's winter in Chicago and it's cold as hell."
" A little disappointing considering all the hype. Though I don't think this is a bad IPA, by any means, I feel it is just good, but not great and with so many stellar IPA's available, I would not go out of my way to drink this again. But in saying that, it is a unique brew."
"D: Great drinkability, this is really just a very well made beer. The taste follows the nose perfectly, everything is well balanced and subtle, and nothing sticks out too much. Not over the top at all, which is very pleasant compared to a lot of IPAs (which I rather enjoy, but this is a nice change of pace)."
"M&D- This is an nicely put together brew. Very easy to drink and just after drinking Hopslam from them as well, i still get alot of the hops and citrus that i tought would be overshined by Hopslam."
"D: This beer is for the faint of heart. If I were having a tasting with a bunch of hopheads that just wanted a slam of hops to the face, I would not bring this. If I were to serve an IPA to oenophile, I would serve this. They have done a great job finding a beautiful combo. And lucky for them, it is a flagship!"
"Pours a deep slightly hazed orange yellow color with a thick yellowish white head and a little lacing. Smells of piny hops and a little hidden malts. Tastes of piny and grassy hops with a little grapefruit and a little orange. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation. Drinkability is high for such a health ABV."
"I may be a little bit slighted, being a Michigander, but this is one great beer. Served in a mug of 30oz size with three fingers of head. Lace you could peel off the side of the mug. Color was a rich medium brown that you could see 100 feet if it was that deep. Smell...oooo, fruit city, this is not your ordinary IPA...cherry, pear, pineapple, malt, and more malt. Taste leaves my mouth wanting more. Flavors of roasted wheat, peach, cherry, pineapple, pine, lemon, sweet malt barley, and piney hops. Mouthfeel was like drinking heavy cream. Wow, I would like to drink much more of this, but the buzz is messing with my head. This is one great beer."
"Amazing creamy mouthfeel. Legendary. What can I say? A go to beer that is so amazing on tap as most great hop beers are."
" The taste has lots of hop flavor w/out pushing the bitterness too far forward. The taste has nice herbal hops and mild citrus and spice. There is a light tropical element and mild toasted malt in the flavor w/ hints of pear and light lime accent into to the finish. This is a great IPA, not a 'hop assault' on the palate, but just pleasant honest to goodness drinkable IPA from Bell's. I consider this a top notch example of the style as far as drinkability goes -a go-to beer for me."
"The taste is too boozy for how little flavor is in this beer."
"As the beer gets lower, the aroma and taste of malts come out. There is no alcohol hotness for a 7% beer, and this is a good beer compromise between a single and double IPA. I would recommend this any day, and could drink it all night."
"D: Easy drinking beer that has a great balance and great spicy hop profile that makes it a bit distinct."
"Overall I was very impressed by the overall balance of the beer. Nothing too overpowering and the blend of hops is nice. Nothing particularly outstanding with this beer, but it's a great American IPA."
"Great flavor and aroma; I'd love to try a souped-up imperial version."
"Having sampled this one quite a few times in bottle and on draft, can safely say this is currently my favorite IPA"
"D-Very drinkable brew, went very well with the burger I had and the game. However I think there's better examples of the style out there."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. Its one that makes you drink more."
"Overall, a great beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a lovely goldish orange with a frothy head that gives way to a thin cap. Lacing follows down the glass. Smell is of piney, fruity hops, with a bit of doughy malt buried somewhere in there. Taste is hops initially, but a much larger dose of malt than expected follows, with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy, but the clean finish leaves this very drinkable. Will likely be a regular in my fridge!"
"One of my favorites! I've had it on tap and by bottles numerous times poured into a pint glass. Pour is a clear amber orange with a medium head. Bursts of fresh hops and citrus. Nice malty backbone with enough sweetness to carry along the hop presence. Never overbearing or random tasting, very focused, simple, and nearly perfect. Freshness is a key here in regard to drinkability!"
"real nice."
"D - So much flavor and so much fun. I need more of this in my life."
"Chad"
"d: this is a very drinkable, very flavorful beer. top notch."
"D - it's so easy to drink and so hard to put down. very drinkable beer."
"D- Very refreshing, flavorful and enjoyable. A go-to beer as people say."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite readily available beer from Bell's. A usual choice when I come across it."
"Incredible! Has great flavor and aroma. A great, strong IPA!"
"My favorite beer to-date. Don't know if my ratings reflect it...don't care. This stuff has, literally, gotten me arrested and gotten me laid. At its core, this is all that is great about beer. (Cliche? Fuck it.)"
"The CPJ"
"Taste is wonderful on this IPA, with a perfect orange/grapefruit balance, and tasty balance on the finish of hops ans bitter grapefruit. Real refreshing. This makes drinkability very high!"
"D--Great beer to get your daily dose of hops with out 'ruining' your taste buds. the 7.1% is surprising as it s as easy drinking as any sessionable IPA"
"DRINKABILITY-4.0 A Hophead delight!. More on the floral side of hoppiness, not bitter - right on in my book."
"D - I'm somewhat biased, because this is my go-to ipa, so I consider it a pleasure to fly through a 6 pack. I guess that in itself is a pretty high recommendation for its drinkability. I'm a huge fan of citrus forward, less bitter ipas, and this is it for me. Give me Two Hearted & Dreadnaught and that's all I'll ever need."
"For 7.1% ABV, it is a rather drinkable IPA. I could see knocking a few of these down in a night. Might also serve as a good intro into the style."
"I enjoy hoppy brews. This is not over the top at all, but it has plenty of hop presence to be very satisfying. May be a bit much for those who aren't overly fond of hops, but then they probably need not apply."
"This is a top tier IPA, one of the best drinking IPA's I have had. Awesome stuff."
"D: Very inviting. Yes."
"Moutfeel is creamy as opposed to crisp, a little syrupy in the aftertaste. Very drinkable though. Doesn't feel heavy and just tastes so freakin good that you don't want to stop drinking it. If you like IPA's you must drink this beer."
"Overall, fabulous IPA- what else would you expect from Bell's?"
"O: This is an IPA, so not much to lose your mind over. However, the freshness of the hop flavor make this beer soemthing to write home about."
"Overall, a very nice beer. This is my first beer from Bells so I'm starting to see what the hype is about. It'd be nice if they could start distributing to New York! Hear me Bells? Get on that! Pick this one up and enjoy it. Cheers!"
"This is a great IPA. Probably the most citrus driven I've ever had. For me it's about as close to perfect as you can get for the style."
"EDIT: Drank an (older) bottle today and it superb. A little muted, but the extra carb is fantastic!"
"D. A decent beer, but not an everyday go-to. it is interesting, but not compelling."
"Drinkability - This is another beer I understand why people enjoy so much. It's very good and very easily drinkable. I wish I had another one. I like how the orange is a bit more dominant over the grapefruit. Changes things up a bit. Most definitely worth a try if you haven't sampled it yet. I'm going to be sure to pick it up again sometime soon."
"M/D very smooth, perfect carbonation, a great beer that one could drink several of and not get bored."
"Drinkability: This is a good IPA. I would drink this if I could get it more often, but they do not distribute to Utah. This is a beer that is assertive, but not overpowering. Nicely balanced."
"This was a popular beer at the bar I worked for in Ohio. We carried many beers by Bells and I liked most of them. After the popularity of the Two-Hearted Ale in our bar, I had to try it. Now, I'm not the biggest fan of American IPA's so I'm trying my best to adjust my palate for this style of beer, but I just couldn't find my chi with this one. I liked that it tried to balance itself out with subtle citrus hues, but I just found the hops to be way too overpowering. I felt that it became slightly easier to drink about halfway through the pint, but overall the excessive hoppiness does not seem properly balanced with the rest of the beer."
"Perhaps the best IPA I've had, right up there with, or probably even better than Smuttynose IPA, another favorite. The hop aroma and taste are different than any other IPA I've tried. They give Two Hearted Ale its unique and delicious flavor."
"medium tea brew in appearance. Head - nothing extravegant gone in <5 min. Smell:Nice hops burst light and pleasant. hops are very present, but not to the point of obnoxious. Not sure of mouthfeel but, Me Likey!!! Drinkability: Really???? This is definitately a very good beer. My fave!!!"
"D: This is a solid beer. It's not something I would want to drink all night due to all the different flavors present, but it's one fantastic brew."
"If I had to think of one word for this beer, it would be ""lingering"". The head lingers unlike almost any beer I've ever poured, the ridiculously hoppy flavor lingers in the mouth for ages between sips, and my desire to drink one lingers as long as I've got some in the house. An absolutely stellar beer, with a flavor that is perhaps a bit *too* overpowering."
"Verdict: This beer boasts a lot of unique characteristics and has an impressive, well balanced body and nose that combines bitter and sweet scents into a satisfying IPA. A great starter choice for those who are wary of dry hops or hop-heavy beer. This should be tried at least once by any so-called beer enthusiast. A- (4.2)"
"Nice job Larry, would love to try a dry hopped version!"
"Overall I have always been a fan of Bells. Yes I know some of their brews are extremely overpriced, but I seem to always go back for more. Even @ $11.99 for a 6pk at various places here in Atlanta, this brew is always a must if you see a few on the shelves. Cheers!"
"D-This is a very good IPA and the best I have enjoyed brewed east of the Rocky Mountains. I have never seen this available in the PNW and probably won't have again anytime soon. Glad to have tried it, but even more glad it did not knock my socks off since not readily available to me."
"D: This is extremely drinkable. Because it's not as dry as a lot of IPAs, this one doesn't lend itself to sipping. Two Hearted is very enjoyable and can stand toe to toe with any regular IPA on the market."
"This is a very solid India Pale Ale. The pour is very smooth and hits the glass with a satisfying hiss that floats up to a loose, heady head. The smell is very authentically Midwest with more pines than citrus fruits. The mouthfeel is dry and satisfying. Drinkability is great with this one, be careful because you might just end up having more than you planned."
"D: A very nice American IPA with some extra oomph at 7.1% ABV. The smooth blend of grassy, herbal hops and light malt sweetness make this a great all-night IPA. Wish we could get Two-Hearted here in CT."
"The mouth is smooth very nice, creamy and full of hops and malt. It starts sweet and grassy turns earthy and hop flavored. It ends with a slight bitter but all around nice hop flavor."
"Drinkability: Man, deceptive. On a hot day or balmy summer night I feel one could go through a six pack with relative ease atleast I could. Considering the alcohol content in this one I do not know how coherent I would be afterwards though."
"Pours into glass an orangey color with light yellow tones and slight haze. The aroma is mellow and not overly strong. The taste explodes with strong crisp malt flavors and a nice hop finish at the end... not too bitter. The malt balances very well with the hop notes culminating in well rounded taste. Rich citrus notes do make a light appearance and make this a flavorful and well balanced beer."
"D - Could have a few of these."
"Drinkability: Fairly standard IPA, easy to drink."
"Overall - Its pretty smooth and easy to drink. Freshness really made this beer enjoyable. Has a nice combination or hops and malts. This is totally a go to good ipa for when you want a soild beer. At 7%, you can enjoy a few without getting messed up. Soild and very good beer."
"Pours a hazy, light, golden color, with a nice white head that leaves ample lacing. Strong nose of citrusy hops and a touch of pine. Taste is citrus, pineapple, tones of earth and grassiness. Hoppy bite, but crisp and smooth. Light-medium body, crisp and perfectly carbonated. Extremely drinkable, and I'd recommend even to people that don't care for IPAs. One of the first beers that really started getting me more into the craft scene."
"D: A great beer to sip on and enjoy. Definitely recommended to those looking for a fantastic IPA. Easy to have more than one in a session."
"I think I love this beer!"
"Though this brew has a 7.10%, its not very heavy and can make a great session beer for an IPA. This was a great representation of the style, and another great brew by Bell's."
"Whenever I go searcing for this brew it's typically sold off of all the shelves. I would like to see Bell's at some more Beer Festivals so they can get the word out on the great taste and flavor of this exceptional Michigan brew"
"Now, back to beer envy. This is the first pack of 2H that I've had yet its been stocked on the shelves at some local stores for some time. With the popularity of other Midwest standouts such as Burning River & Daisy Cutter, beauty from Bell's holds its own."
"D: Smooth, easy-drinking IPA that provides a nice, refreshing feel. Lack of bold flavors allow for multiple refills."
"Light orange amber color; tap color was slightly darker than having it from the bottle Extremely clear, clear enough to watch tv through (upside down of course). Thin white head, hangs around for pretty much whole drink. Decent lacing. Fantastic aroma. Bursting citrus aroma, very sweet hoppy aroma, very bright. Good balance of sweetness. Light beginning, slight light maltness. Nice citrusy hoppy middle with Grapefruity peel aftertaste. Growler flavor was slightly darker in the sugary sweetness but still with same bright hoppiness. Overall very light, especially for having so much flavor. Everything seems very balance. Very drinkable. Smooth mouthfeel, nothing overpowering or too potent on the finish."
"I agree with so many of the other reviewers of this ale that it is one of the best examples of an IPA around. It may have its equals, but there are none better among the ones I've tried. It starts out smooth, then a hoppy bitterness appears, and finally a slightly sour taste emerges, emphasis on ""slight."" If you tasted some that was more than that, maybe it was too old, stored wrong, etc."
"D: Pretty refreshing stuff considering the abv; tasty stuff... maybe my favorite Bell's beer."
"I got this on tap at Mullet's without even knowing what it was and it turned out good. I's a medium copper color with a bunch of white head. The aroma is a bit of citrus and some hops. For taste it's hops with citrus and some spices. The hops are medium level, not overbearing but enough to add some character. The body is mid-level with a somewhat clean finish. You don't really notice the alcohol with this one."
"Pours a nice hazy blonde with a lingering head and some lacing. Smells of citrusy hops, a little light malt, and a lemon background from the hops. Tastes primarily of northern hops with a light wheat malt, some hops citrus and light spices. Medium-full body, lots of carbonation, lingering hops in the finish. Overall a solid hoppy ale."
"D: Very drinkable. Alchohol doesn't seem noticeable. Always leaves room for more."
"pours a nice golden hazy color with a pure white 2 finger head in my long hammer ipa glass. smells fainty of pine and only a tad bit of hops, nothing particularly stunning. tastes again like light pine and orange or tangerine, but one good swish makes the carbonation explode and bitterness just overwhelms. its so dry on the finish i cant see myself drinking more than one, although i can see how close this brew is to greatness... it just nearly misses for me. im almost left wanting to chug a gatorade after finishing this beer just to revitalize myself. maybe ill revisit in the future and insure a fresh bottle ( i dont know how fresh this bottle is)."
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
"All in all one of my favorites. I recommend it to all my friends if they ask about a good IPA."
"solid taste, a little bit of hops, but its much more subtle than I expected. Really smooth, something that I could drink all day during the summer or fall. Really good from the bottle too, normally only had this one on tap."
"It was still drinkable - as I was working on my house and had only it on hand - but it was less than pleasant and far from its exceptional - typical - self."
"Worth seeking out, too bad bells isn't in NJ"
"Cheers!"
"Overall a very solid IPA.. Nicely balanced IMO"
"Serving Type: Bottle to a Delirium Tremens tulip glass."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light for an IPA which makes it easier to drink than most."
"D-This was a good, balanced beer that lived up to some of the hype that has been put out about it. It is very drinkable due to it's lower body and low level of carbonation."
"Poured bright copper in color with a slight haze and a strong, rocky white head. Excellent head retention that reduces to a thick white cap. Floral and citrus hop aromas including grapefruit, orange and lemon. A nice sweet malty undertone is able to sneak through to the intense hop flavor. Medium bodied with nice carbonation and a resiny feel. Very complex hop flavors, floral, orange, lemon, and grapefruit with a sweet maltiness beneath. Citrus flavors taper to allow the malty sweetness to intensify and then a light pine hoppy finish . Many flavors and aromas in this IPA. Pretty fantastic stuff. Went down smooth and easy."
"D -Definitely a beer that can be drunk on the regular. I will always want this IPA before others if it is available."
"Alcohol is a little on the high side; otherwise I could keep drinking this without getting bored."
"One of my favorites so far. Such a fantastic beer, whether on tap or in bottle."
"O - Not quite what I want in an IPA, not nearly enough hop flavor. Will try this again in a couple years to once again see if I can like this beer as much as others do. I just don't see why all the fuss."
"Highly recommend."
"Something about this beer (yeast perhaps) makes it much easier to drink than others. It has tuns of flavour but is not harsh or overpowering in the slightest. If I could, I would go back and give every beer I have ever reviewed a lower drink-ability rating, because this beer is king!"
"Overall: A good beer with some unique flavor qualities. Other than that, everything else is pretty standard."
"Pours a clear crisp amber with a thick foamy white head. The nose is dominated by citrus & floral hops but also backed by a bready malt. The sip yields a fine and smooth drinking IPA, bitter at first which quickly fades and leaves a creamy citrus pine taste finishing crisp. This beer is delicious. Medium bodied mouthfeel, I feel like this beer hits all the right notes. High drinkability and really it's a shame I wont be able to make this brew a habit since distribution in NY isnt happening. Hopefully this changes with Bell's expansion in the next few years because I'd make this a regular purchase on USA beer runs. Had to make the rare 3 hour trp to MI to finally try it, and yes it was worth it."
"Lighter medium body, dry and sticky feel. Excellent drinkability and flavor, and the alcohol is totally masked. Easily one of my favorite year round IPAs."
"Two Hearted pours a hazy copper with a rich one finger white head that clings to the glass. The aroma is a floral, citrusy and rich hoppy that is pleasant to smell. This is an excellent example of an IPA. The taste is outstanding with a nice balance of hops that is not overly bitter and a slightly sweet finish. There is a perfect amount of carbonation and drinks very smooth. This is a very drinkable IPA and I would highly recommend this beer to someone who is ready to try an IPA for the first time since this is not overly bitter, yet it has a nice hoppy flavor."
"I've seen polls that placed this beer second only to PtE in popularity, and I can see why. I can't imagine anyone (except perhaps the most pucker lipped hopheads) not enjoying this, and I would certainly rate it among the best American IPAs. I would give Pliny a solid edge by virtue of its fuller body, and its yeasty subtleties. Forced to choose at gunpoint, I might also take a Ruination, for sheer hoppy indulgence. But make no mistake: this is an outstanding beer, fully deserving of its great reputation, and competitive with the very best in its style. I'm jealous of you guys who get to drink it all the time."
"I would say this is a great and very drinkable ipa but not my favorite. I look forward to trying it from the tap."
"D - very easy to drink, I think I've found an IPA that I'll drink again and again"
"Drinkabilty is very good - Hops and more hops - whats not to like."
"I even emailed the President of Bell's with no response. Maybe they don't want my expendable beer dollars."
"A regular beer of choice for me whenever available, on tap or bottled."
"I could use a lesson or two on the subtleties associated with varying levels of hops as they relate to description. My vocabulary for beer hasn't grown much."
"I love this beer! Every sip was so perfect, it just left me wanting more. Probably the best IPA I have tried to date. Extremely refreshing and tasty. A must try!"
"One of my favorite IPAs. Just an outstanding beer."
"D - Delicious, refreshing, easy-drinking ale. Loved it"
"D- I couldn't just have one. superior beer. Stoked on it."
"D - Excellent IPA, very well balanced, easy going and enjoyable. Would highly recommend it."
"I hope to have that chance soon."
"Smelled very sweet, citrusy (orange predominantly), flowery. Hops are second to the fruity floral aroma. Hops up front on the drinking it, with more of a grapefruit taste than orange. Can pick up some malt sweetness. Finishes with a nice bitterness. Had a nice medium body, good amount of carbonation and a dry finish."
"D - not my bag but I could see other people liking this."
"D: Very very very drinkable... without a doubt my favorite IPA to date, looking to experiment more with IPA's now that this 6 pack has grown so much on me."
"Drinkability - I could put a few of these down with a smile."
"I've had this many times at the bar and at home and loved it. I'll still buy this fairly regularly, but it didn't really hold up very well in a blinded IPA tasting."
"Pours an amber orange haze with a white soapy head. Aroma of grapefruit and some pine. Very delicious. Grapefruit sweet up front with bitters on the backend. Dry finish. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Resiny towards the end. Very enjoyable. Another great beer from Bell's."
"Drinkability: Excellent example of the variety. I could definitely have a few of these on a hot summer day (or any other day of the year for that matter)."
"Pours a nice dark golden color with a pretty decent white fluffy head. Left nice lacing on the glass, and a small ring of foam hung around after the rest had dissipated. Very nice hop smell to it with some notes of citrus. I really like this IPA I think it has a good balance of hops and malt. Very nice hop presence though. Theres a slight taste of citrus and orange as well that is nice and refreshing. The mouthfeel was nice on this, it went down reeal smooth. Drinkability is good as well. I could drink these all day and nght. Good job Bells."
"dark golden color with a white head. excellent lacing throughout. smell is of sweet citric hops. taste is similar to the nose with very strong lemon notes and a floral freshness to it. slight bitterness, but not much, the hops is more in the aroma. it leaves hardly any aftertaste and does not coat the mouth. very drinkable. this is one of my favorite IPAs. I was a bit worried as there was no date on this, but freshness was not an issue."
"D- Can really see how IPAs drink very well in the summer, but given where I am in Georgia today in October, it's kinda warm not summer hot but this is still a refreshing brew to sip on. As I'm not a big IPA guy this one is very impressionable and I will have this one again."
"medium to high carbonation, yet fairly smooth mouthfeel. for a hoppy IPA it's fairly drinkable."
"Refreshing but I don't think I could drink it all night."
"D - This is a fantastic IPA, and I'm glad I picked this up in the mixed six pack from Wegmans. This is one of those beers you could drink all night and never get tired of the flavor."
"Draught @ Mellow Mushroom Raleigh: The beer pours a fairly clear, orangish color. There was a bit of a white head on it. It has a very nice aroma. The main nose is that of citrus with some floral hops. Strong, but not overpowering. A hint of sweetness in the aroma also. Upfront taste of hops. Strong, but not overdone. Aftertaste has a bit of orange to it, a hint of both sweetness and tartness. Quite good!"
"Highly, perhaps even deceptively, drinkable at 7%, and I know Bells has been getting slammed for poor QC lately, but the last few sixers I've had from them have been flawless. I'm at the point where I always try to have these, Alpha King, and Sun King's Osiris in the fridge at all times. And keeping them around becomes its own challenge because they're all so damned tasty."
"Having tasted a number of American IPAs, this one does not rank among my favorites. Disappointing relative to the strong reviews this beer has received."
"Overall: very good IPA with plenty of hop flavor and bitterness with just enough malt sweetness to keep it in check. I'd recommend this beer to anyone that likes IPAs."
"Up front I must confess this is my favorite IPA. Pours a nice amber color with a perfect one finger head that leaves some light lacing. Great floral and hoppy notes in the aroma, with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is incredible. Smooth on the palate with the perfect mix of hoppy bitterness and malt balance. Hard to get enough of this delicious brew."
"D- this is a tasty ipa I always get that hint of soap but its not a turn off. On cask this is a great beer on tap its very good."
"D - Easy drinker. A good fishing beer, as the label might suggest! If only it came in cans....that would be awesome."
"Two Hearted Ale pours a nice dark tangerine/orange color; not 100% translucent as it has a little bit of haze to it. A nice three finger head of creamy bone colored foam rises up. Retention is very good, but lacing is a bit spotty for an American IPA. Nose is pretty good, a citrus and pine bomb, but I'm not finding any hint of malt balance. The malt definitely shows up in the taste though, equal parts caramel and bready and very good. A wave of bitterness (just a bit much for a beer of this size) washes over my palate next. I really like that this isn't just straight up citrus on the back end, a healthy dose of pine works really well. Body is a little bit light for this beer, but I think carbonation is especially key for a beer like this as it can help elevate (or dull) the hops and Bell's really nailed it for Two Hearted. It's carbed a little bit on the high end, but not anywhere close to becoming obnoxious. The only real chink in Two Hearted's armor is a level of bitterness that I think is *just* overstepping its bounds. It really is a minor quibble in the face of a great beer."
"On the mouth, this is pretty easy-going. There is not a lot of active carbonation and the ale rolls around nicely in your mouth. The lingering aftertaste could be a bit of a turnoff to those unaccustomed to an IPA. That and the 7.1% ABV bring the drinkability down a couple of notches, but it shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone looking to try an IPA at the top of its game. I wouldn't hesitate to offer this to an IPA newbie or a veteran hophead."
"Pours a clear gold copper color with some visible carbonation. Nice white head with a bit of lacing. Has a great aroma with citrus, and some floral and slightly spicy elements. Mellow flavor, but very tasty. Florals, hops, and spice, with a hint of orange. Light- to medium-bodied, and smooth with light carbonation. A great tasty, and drinkable, IPA. Wish this were available out here in California!"
"D- Near the top of ipa's. Stone and this are probably the top couple, but this is definitely an everyday kind of beer too. Nice to find an awesome beer that won't wear on me if i drink it often. oh and it hides that 7.1 well."
"drinkability Very. Two Hearted takes the normally refreshing IPA a bit past the norm. One eventually can't drive or play with power tools but up to that point this goes down very very well."
"Unfortunately the higher alcohol content means I will probably never be able to enjoy as much of it as I would like!"
"Drinkability- I'm not as in love with the beer as a lot of people seem to be. I've also had it on tap and liked it a bit more but I don't have notes on it so these are my bottle notes instead. I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two on preference but those who like it would obviously have more."
"D: A beer that is greater than the sum of its parts--an unusual sensory profile comes together remarkably well and makes for a subtle yet interesting experience. Two-Hearted does not immediately lend itself to direct comparisons with beers of the west coast IPA archetype, but does remind of Ninkasi's Total Domination IPA. The flavors featured here do not assault the palate, and would humbly vanish in the presence of most savory food flavors."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from bottle into Leffe glass. golden orange color with white straw head. Lots of lacing and bubbles. Smell is great - apricots, strawberries, and grassy bitterness. Taste is fruity wet hops, lightly toasted sweet malts, balanced bitterness. Moderate-light carbonation and dry finish. Very drinkable, this is one of my favorite midwestern IPAs."
"D-Give me more, easy drinker."
"D - Very much a drinkable beer. Very well balanced and wonderful aroma."
"Very good IPA with nice balance. Really good hop flavors with a bitterness that isn't crushing. Would drink a lot more if it were easier to come by."
"D- If you like superhopped IPA this is your beer. Although I definitely enjoyed this beer I don't know if I could just sit and drink one after another. This is the kind of beer I'd like to order at a decent restaurant while ordering appetizers as it kind of fires up your taste buds but overindulgence would burn them out."
"Aggressive pour yields a golden copper color, with a solid inch of foamy head. leaving lots of lacing throughout consumption. Nice citrus nose, that comes through even more in the taste. The malts seem to open up as it warms a bit. Tons of citrus and floral hop flavors, but well balanced and refreshing. A very drinkable IPA that lives up to its praise."
"Light bodied and carbonated, Two Hearted is very clean and crisp and incredibly easy drinking. Could definitely have a couple bottles of these, especially when fresher. Still a delicious IPA from the Midwest."
"D: it drank really good and so good that it could easily become one of my favorite session beers while grillin some shrimps."
"Two-hearted reigns supreme over all!"
"Drinkability is quite good, even for a non-IPA fan such as myself. The taste was quite a pleasant surprise for me, as it was very well-balanced. I used to shy away from beers like this, but Bell's Two Hearted Ale has shown me that IPAs can be more than just bitter bombs. Maybe this is my gateway IPA? Only time will tell. For now, I'm just wishing I had more of this stuff around here in my area!"
"Pics at: http://wp.me/pNKWo-1hr"
"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this gem of a beer, which was my gateway beer to the wonderful world of craft brews. This is Bells' best creation, for me at least. Wonderful appearance, poured aggressively into a Duvel tulip. Smell is what you'd expect from an IPA, but the taste is out of this world. There is some age on this beer, bottled on Aug. 4, 2010. For me, freshness is the utmost importance with IPAs, but this beer at two months old is still excellent. Paired with some spicy Mexican food, this IPA has the right intensity to bite through the spiciness for a nice complimenting beer. Drinkability, even with a 7 percent ABV, is excellent, too. I highly recommend you seek this one out if you haven't tried it. If you find it more than two months old, don't buy -- there is fresher out there."
"This is an awesome IPA. Get it. Drink it. Be happy."
"D - Drinkability is very good but average for a similar IPA. It is a refreshing IPA that I can drink on a regular basis."
"Wow, love this beer. Cannot say enough good things about the quality and taste of Two Hearted. Beautiful floral hop aroma is the first thing you notice about this IPA. The taste is like no other. I feel its very balanced while still providing great hop flavor. Clean, tasty finish."
"D: I don't have much to put this up against, but this is by far my favorite IPA. I usually don't appreciate the overwhelming bitterness that is associated with the style, but this beer is so well balanced that the bitterness becomes just another enjoyable quality. It's fairly strong at 7.1%, though the alcohol really isn't noticeable."
"Anyway, the Bell's Two Hearted Ale is delicious. Nicely done, Bell's."
"D - I don't find the citrus in this to really be offputting or cause the drinkability to suffer. It's not as bitter as i like, but it is a solid tasting beer that i would be glad to down a few of at a time."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Smooth and creamy with great fine carbonation. A really nice overall mouthfeel. Due to the excessive grapefruit taste I couldn't rate the drinkability higher that a 4, however. I can appreciate the bitterness of the beer, but I don't feel like it's bitterness from the hops as is the case with most IPAs. I'm of two minds (or hearts) on this one."
"Overall/notes - I can't say too much here. I've had this on-tap and in the bottle, and both are extremely delicious. Much better than their Pale Ale. Certainly ranks among the best IPAs I've had so far. Going to kick back and watch a movie with a second one!"
"Awesome drinkability. Such a drinkable IPA. Crisp, refreshing, tasty ass shit! One of my go-to beers in late college. As responsible as SNPA for my craft beer and hop addiction. Bell's please distribute to WA. I'd buy the 2Hearted all the time."
"D: Goes down great. Good alone or with food for sure."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This used to always be my favorite beer, and I'm finding out (after not having it for quite some time) that it still is. Hop Wallop, Nugget Nectar, and Hoppe are all great beers, but I'd have to say that Two Hearted is my favorite Ipa of all time."
"I really like this beer. I had heard good things and this one lived up to the hype. Drinkabiltiy would be higher but after a 4-5 of these you'd be gone."
"A great american IPA very similar to the DFH 60 minute IPA due to the intense hoppy aroma and taste. A full bodied ale power packed with hop flavor but also a good malty character to it. When you open this beer it smells of hops and tastes like you are drinking pure hops."
"It's a golden beer with suspended bubbles and a white soapy head. I can smell graham cracker and warm chunky hops. I can taste good bitterness and crystal sugars; there is a little fruit flavor as well. It has medium carbonation and body but a decent coat. It's very drinkable, no single aspect is very overpowering."
"I highly recommend this Bell's favorite."
"Note: A revisit with perhaps a fresher brew yields a slightly better flavor and feel and adds a a nice hop spice to it all. Review adjusted appropriately."
"Drinkability and notes: If I had this beer by itself, I probably wouldn't complain, but there are far better IPA's out there. It wasn't hard to drink , and, by itself, is somewhat refreshing, but the hop/malt balance is off. Given the BA popularity and rave reviews I was expecting more."
"Drinkability: Though you may not be able to polish a couple too many off, you'll want to. The balance of the hops and malts make the want for more unwavering."
"Having said that, I would like to try a fresher batch of this beer. I spent 5 minutes digging around for the pack with the highest batch number and still came home with one over 2 months old. Curse you, Bell's esoteric batch numbering system!!"
"Although my experience with single IPA's is somewhat limited, Two Hearted is by far my favorite of the style and I grab it whenever I come across a fresh sixer."
"Overall: A slightly bitter IPA that remains balanced. One of the best i've had a well worth going for."
"I traditionally haven't liked hoppy beers like IPAs, but that was probably because I was drinking the wrong ones. The is bitter but smooth and I could definitely have 2-3 in a sitting."
"D - Fun beer. I would drink this often."
"Drinkability is exceptional. If you are an IPA fan and have not tried this, you are wrong. Exceptional IPA with the perfect combination of hops, carbonation and scent. Unbelievable great job Bells!!!"
"MF/D: a faint hint of carbonation sizzles the tongue, but there is a dry, smooth swallow that makes this a very sessionable summer afternoon IPA."
"d- definitely try this. i will be drinking this pretty often."
"As far as bitterness goes, it's probably on the medium to somewhat higher end for IPAs. Maltiness is somewhat low. Drinkability is quite high, but then again I like the hop qualities this IPA uses."
"Drinkability: It would be perfect, were it not for the noticeably higher alcohol content. I could drink this every night, but I couldn't drink more than two or three, even on a long night. Great beer in moderation!"
"D-Awesome. Don't sense the alcohol. One of my new favorite hop-packing beverages"
"Medium carbonation seems to increase the spicyness on the tongue. Relatively light bodied. Very drinkable as the sweet malt is strong enough to hold its own against the hops and bitterness."
"D- A solid all around beer. Almost like a half-way to a double IPA based on the flavor, but closer to a normal IPA. It's good easy drinking, and a solid example of the style. Sadly, I don't think it lives up to the hype, but I can't deny that it's still a great beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint. Medium gold/tan color and a mice one finger head. Stuck around awhile. Aroma was of spucy hoppy grapefruit. Taste was strong and deliciously hoppy with a nice malt backbone. I got the weird fruity flavor some have described as well. Medium body and carbonation made it easy to drink for such a strong tasting brew. Packs a wallop of flavor."
"D - Wish i had more. This is the last bottle from an east coast trade. Very easy to drink and tasty beer. Extremely balanced beer with lots of flavor. This is a formidable contender from the east in a style that i favor. If this was a local beer, i would definitely put this in my IPA rotation."
"If you have the chance to try Two Hearted from the cask - not to be missed!"
"D: Easy drinking for an IPA. Smooth and well balanced hop character makes it very approachable."
"D - yeah i would have a few and try again but frankly it was just a typical ipa"
"Mouthfeel was very thin, low carbonation. Cam and Dan, who brought these, have had it before and said the first was probably not fresh enough and the 2nd was just off. I'd still like to give this beer another chance."
"D-Very nice I really liked this one"
"Highly drinkable, this is one of my go-to IPA's either from the bottle or on tap."
"Highly drinkable. Always enjoyable. Probably the best beer that Bell's makes."
"Drinkability: For a strong IPA, this is a very drinkable beer; you have to watch yourself at 7.0% ABV. It's full-bodied, but very smooth."
"D: This beer is certainly crisp and refreshing and boasts many qualities that hop heads would love, but it just remains a bit on the bitter side for me. Easy drinking IPA with great aroma and flavor, and crisp carbonation"
"D: Drinkable for an IPA. I would be able to drink a six-pack in a night, but would rather only have one or two."
"D: Very impressive for an IPA. Borders perhaps on a double? It's no Sculpin, but it has a place in my top 5. If it were local I'd buy it often."
"Overall, one of the best IPAs I have ever had. In fact, I rate this second to Sculpin on that list for single IPAs. Perfectly smooth and balanced. This would be my good to six pack if it were local, but it is not. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A fantastic IPA and probably the best available. I have not had an IPA with so much hop character that also was not oppressive on the palate. Very drinkable (though not quite sessionable) and this is something I wish I could regularly find in NYC. If you haven't already tried this, stop reading this and grab some- I am glad I brought this back from D.C."
"The malt and hop balance is spot on making this a very smooth and drinkable beer that you just can't stop drinking."
"D: I think I could drink this all day. It is a crisp, balanced, tasty beer. The alcohol is not noticeable at all. If you haven't tried this one you definitely should, and it shouldn't be too hard to find."
"Pours very bright golden yellow head retention fades a bit fast. Smell is very tropical laced with bitter hops. I could smell this beer all day. Piney and earthy are really nowhere to be found. I like piney and earthy but this is way different and a nice change. Nice hop bitterness upfront and has a great malt backbone. Very tangy with sweetness in the aftertaste. Gotta love this beer. Even non craft drinkers take to it pretty well."
"Smells of vegetables. A strong and even hoppy flavor that does never get too bitter. Strong, hearty, river-forging brew. Crisp finish and no tastes lingering long. You can crack these forgetting the 7.1 abv, which is a plus."
"The best IPA out there? I'm not going that far but of the ones I can easily get it's in the to 3."
"Flavor has a nice moderate bitterness with lots of smooth citrus hop flavors. Leaves a nice citrus burst in the mouth. This reminds me of a slightly more restrained Alesmith ipa, kinda old school and calm, very drinkable in larger quantities."
"Two Hearted Ale has a nice mouthfeel. Great viscosity and carbonation, just shy of perfection as it just doesn't sparkle like the best of the field. It's damn close, though. The finish is mildly bitter but pleasant. Overall, I love this beer. I think I'll drink it for the next 10 years as well. Thanks, Bells!!"
"Had this one on cask tonight at Landmark Tavern during opening day of Raleigh Beer Week. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a nice lasting off white head that lasted and left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was crisp citrus hops just in front of sweet malts. The taste was a nice balance with the complex hop profile just in front of a firm sweet caramel malt backbone. The beer is on the light side of medium and is quite smooth and refreshing. This is truly the kind of beer that casks were made for, truly outstanding, no wonder this cask kicked in less than 40 minutes."
"On tap at the Melting Point in Athens, Ga. Poured into a pint glass. Oily resinsy hoppiness lines the glass. Aroma is a beautiful grapefruit and orange citrussy juiciness. Taste has a nice malty sweetness in the background but the hops are the story. It's a beautiful blend of different hop bitterness. Deserving of all the praise it's ever gotten, this is one of the best ipa's...ever."
"M/D - Full body is light in flavor but there is sugar at the end. Easy to drink, not insanely bitter, probably a great beer locally depending on the price. I'd drink it again but only if it was easy to acquire."
"Drinkability: At this high of an ABV, this is a one beer a night beer for me, as it's so tasty I'm drinking it quick and noticing the alcohol fairly quickly. Although I drank it rather quick, I could see this as a sit and savor beer. I had it with a grilled chicken salad but I found it clashed a bit so I polished off the meal quickly so I could savor the beer alone. It's a good beer that I'll have to have again."
"Notes: First off, I'd NEVER buy this based on the package if I hadn't heard of it - it looks cheap and designed for tourists. HOWEVER - this beer fucking rocks! In fact all of my housemates agree that this is the balls. Well done and I'm super jealous of people who get to drink this all the time! Thanks again chubbyswans!"
"This one was poured into a DFH pint glass. It poured quickly, a light burnt orange in color with a half inch white head. The smell is very floral and perfectly hoppy. There's a little sweetness to it. It tastes great. It mimics the aromas. It's very floral and has a great hoppyness to it. The sweetness is subtle. It drank very crisp and had good carbonation that tickled the tongue. It's incredibly drinkable. Overall it's a fine IPA and one of the best on the market."
"Drinkability is surprisingly good for a super bitter 7% ABV beer, could definitely have a few."
"Cheers..."
"Notes: Batch 9892. Very good and easy to drink beer. Extremely balanced between hops and malt and between hop flavors. Very good, and enjoyable IPA, especially for one that is easy to get (in the Midwest at least). Not the best beer in the world, but a very tasty one that I would keep stocked."
"D: This beer is certainly crisp and refreshing and boasts many qualities that hop heads would love, but it just remains a bit on the bitter side for me. Easy drinking IPA with great aroma and flavor, and crisp carbonation."
"Perhaps familiarity breeds content. Two Hearted is enjoyable and I could drink this til the vacas came home. Not the top shelf of IPA's, but hovering around the top of the second tier. A Tony Romo selection...discuss."
"D: Pretty good for an IPA. Could definitely keep drinking it."
"D - This stuff is addicting, goes down smooth, and has a delicious and unique hop kick to it."
"The beer pours a light amber that looks green when held up to the light. A soft head clings to the top of the beer and sticks lightly to the sides of the glass. The beer smells of fresh pine, just peeled orange rind, and flowery honey. The beer tastes very crisp with bitterness up front that marries with the taste of ripe peaches and malted barley. The beer is refreshing and with tannins providing good mouth feel and a dry finish. Very drinkable and deceiving for the the 7+% ABV, but definitely not sustainable for a session."
"Bottle 341ml. Hazy gold. Fantastic aroma of peach, tangerine and grassy hops. Flavor is well balanced between citrus, hops and pepper. Lovely dry and slightly bitter finish. Light palate, a little bit crispy. Very enjoyable. As good as it gets for an IPA."
"I need to thank irishkyle21 for sending this gem my way it's a great well rounded beer that I would be drinking all the time if I could get it in my area"
"Impressed with this one, more so than with other Bell's offerings I've had. Recommended."
"Great nose. Mild hoppiness with a malt balance. Taste is more of the same. I really like the balance this beer displays and would recommend it whole heartedly to anyone trying to get into hoppy beers."
"This one was somewhat unimpressive in the pour that built a messy high head that was gone very quickly. Some sticks to the glass though for an extended stay. Bright floral hops in the nose. Lemon and coriander permeate as well. Pungent budding hops with earwaxlike bitterness. Malts and some sweet character pull back the hops briefly, but I am reminded of them again with a chalky bite of bitterness. Balanced, probably not, but enough to make it a go-to for the hop cravings."
"What a great beer. A nice hoppy kick but oh so balanced. I washed a nice bowl of chili down with this one. Smelled glorious. So fresh and bold. If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life this one might be my pic."
"I really enjoy this beer. It's really well balanced with the perfect amount of carbonation. For those that enjoy the seasonal, HopSlam, this is a bit of step down in flavor and hops which I prefer. I feel blessed to be able to pick this up from nearly every local store. However, be aware this is 7.1% abv, you won't realize it when your drinking it."
"There is absolutely no sign of the 7.10%abv in this glass. Combine that with the crisp, refreshing flavor and you've got a very drinkable beer here!"
"one of my Favorites"
"D: An excellent IPA. Probably in my top 5. Doesn't taste strong but gives me a warm buzz before i'm halfway done (empty stomach)."
"D - Great IPA. Lots of great flavor that you'd almost guess it's closer to a DIPA. The balance makes for a perfect drink. Couldn't pass up a glass of this anywhere."
"M/D: Light to medium body with a nice creamy amount of carbonation and just the right amount of dryness and bitterness make me want to immediately take another sip. Very nicely crafted!"
"Easy and wildly enjoyable to drink."
"I've had this a number of times, but never on cask. Let's do it to it. It pours a hazy orange amber topped by nearly a finger of thick creamy foam. The nose is dominated by the hops (mostly citrus with some pine thrown in for variety's sake), though a current of sweet caramel jets through like the EAC. The taste is very similar, though the balance is much better. Both camps respect each other for their ferocity and professionalism. Damn, does it make for one tasty battle. The body is a light medium, with no real carbonation involved and a severely smooth and creamy feel. This is insanely good on cask, even better than in bottles. Get some!"
"edit (5/18/2011) - re-read this review as I had a fresh 2 hearted (first one in a LONG time) and every word/rating holds true for me, cept maybe the beer's appearance...seemed more murky than clear."
"D-highly drinkable IPA that has a nice bitter quality but it still invites you to drink a second or third bottle; slight hint of alcohol; some California IPA/DIPA are just too over the top with little to no balance and in turn much lower drinkability, but this is really nice"
"Just my 0.02"
"D-The alcohol is completely silenced. A 7% brew that could easily sneak up on you especially because the flavor is savory. I wish I could get this beer all the time. Why won't you reside in MA with me? Would be my go-to beer if I could get it locally."
"I've tried quite a few beers, and this beer deserves it's own category, it's almost beyond what you can call beer."
"Will drink this ANY time. DELICIOUS."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Picked this up on a recent road trip and just now getting around the reviewing it. This pours a hazy yellow-orange color, with a small sticky head. Smells are citrus, hops, and flowers. My first drink is of fresh hops, smooth and creamy texture. Finishes crisp, dry, and yeasty. Will definately drink this one again!"
"Bell's still isn't distributed to California, and I've only made two trades (none involving Bell's), yet this is my fifth offering from this brewery. Following the others, THA is DoubleJ approved."
"Quite simply one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Definitely a hop bomb, and a tasty one at that. Alcohol is well concealed by the hop flavors, but its so drinkable you just might feel it after having a few! Absolutely stunning, magnificent IPA."
"Overall, I recommend this beer very highly for its great flavor and great drinkability. Yet another satisfying brew from Bell's."
"Overall- What a great beer! I know this beer is highly regarded and I'm glad I finally got to drink it. I would highly recommend to anyone. I certainly plan to purchase more Two Hearted in the future. Thoroughly enjoyed this drinking experience and definitely am ready for another bottle."
"Courtesy of coreyfmcdonald, pours an amber orange hue with a wonderful fluffy head. Smell is a bit lighter than most DIPA's but grapefruit, pine resin, and brown sugar/caramel are present. Taste is exceptional, ginger grapefuit and pine are all dominant with some dark brown sugar in the back with a spice ridden aftertaste. Probably my favorite DIPA even moreso than PTE. Mouthfeel is viscous and slightly chewy. Alcohol is well hidden."
"amazing drink ability very easy to drink and enjoy would be the perfect camping, bbqing type beer."
"This one poured out golden and super frothy into a standard pint glass, nice thick head to start which left remnants after each sip on the side of the glass. Aromas of pure citrus, limes, orange peel, some cloves with a taste to match. Nice hoppy balance, but not overwhelming like other IPA's I have tasted in the past. Perfect balance between citrusy hops and malts, medium bodied beer with a lighter mouthfeel and extremely easy drinkability. Hard to believe this is a 7% ABV brew, nicely covered up which makes this an excellent overall beer."
"D: A good beer, I can see why it's well regarded. It doesn't stand out next to better CA IPAs but well above average in the style. Had to go to AZ to do it, but I'm glad I finally got to try this classic."
"This beer was poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a mug. It had a hazy honey gold color, a bit cloudy. The initial 1.5 inches of foam decreased somewhat but didn't disappear entirely. The carbonation was very nice. I could see lots of tiny bubbles. The aroma was one of the great features of this beer. It had a strong hops aroma with citrus notes. With respect to taste, the bitterness of the hops hit me right away and stayed until the finish. It's nicely balanced, however, with a little bit of sweetness. It was definitely not overly hoppy for my taste. Bell's Two Hearted Ale was a pleasure to drink."
"Outstanding!!!"
"D - one of the best single-hop IPA's out there, great balance of bitter and sweet. not much to really complain about, always a good go-to."
"I enjoyed this Two Hearted Ale at about 45 degrees. The average score for appearance was due to a somewhat light color. The color was decieving, though, since the the taste was excellent. I'm not usually a fan of Pale Ales, but this one had great balance and was somewhat easy to enjoy for a non-hop-head."
"2-hearted, hyped. Yup. Worth it, definitely."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle, batch number 9637, purchased from the W Grocer. Pours a clear, bright burnt orange with a thick frothy white head that takes a long time to recede, but never truly disappears. The nose is beautiful blend of citrus/pine/resin hops and some caramel malt. On the palate this beer is extremely balanced showcasing the grapefruit hops and bread malts perfectly. The alcohol is also very well integrated. The body is medium with average carbonation and a nice long finish that is both citrus and bitter. It is easy to see why this is regarded as one of the best IPAs in America."
"D: Very nice AIPA, everything you want and balanced nicely to boot. The ABV is right on, but at 7.10% one or 2 will do you. Worth a shoot."
"Pouring light orange with a mild haze, there's a dense, reverse-cascading head that forms a dense collar, leaving sheets of lace. Perfect. The nose is too, redolent, bright and yet suffuse with beautiful citrus and floral hops. Truly a centennial showcase, the palate replicates the flavor. Opening with a bright citrus and floral hop character, this is really smooth. A touch sweeter than it is on tap, there's a little cotton candy sweetness. Still, this dry, with mild bitterness and an explosion of hop flavor. I drank two pints and would have had a third and a fourth if it didn't kick."
"Lots of hop bitterness for my taste buds, grapefruit, pine and lightly toasted bread."
"Purchased a pair of pints in sleeves at Psycho Suzie's in Minneapolis. Both came with a decently yellow to light orange clear body with light lacing. The aromas are dominated by US C-hops, with citrus atop a barely perceptible malt body. Enjoyable thus far. The beer is bitter with a good balancing level of hop flavours with a bit of pine and grapefruit coming through. Very drinkable, especially in the situation I was in. Good beer, worth seeking out."
"12oz. bottle into chilled pint glass;finally got this brew here in AZ.appearance typical aipa color,hazy orange w/decent carbonation,nice citrus,floral nose..the taste---WOW--impressive! one of my favorite ipa's,more refreshing than most,(stone,alesmith, racer5)great hop bite,but balanced beautifully! recommended!!!"
"Cheers!"
"looks golden with and amber tint. large head that settles with nice lacing. I like this beer but lately I have wanted a more balanced Ipa so the smell is very pine but for some reason I can't taste or smell the grapefuit as much as I used too still smells nice. the sweet melts are okay but taste is more bitter than what I remember the beer tasting like lately I have been overwhelmed by hops in beers I think my tongue is burned out a bit by hops. Anyway the flavor is still on my tongue 10 minutes between sips so it strong long lasting pine resin compelling almost gin like. the mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and slick bodied IPA. Still very drinkable a simple relaxing session beer provided you don't have to drive."
"I have had this several times but this was exceptionally fresh for around here (PA) - 2 weeks after bottling according to the batch number. Why can't every brewery do something like this? It REALLY matters! Beer pours a golden amber with a large head which settles to a coating only at the last couple of sips. Lacing is thin but lasting. A whiff of this beer is a pretty perfect IPA-lover's dream - citrus (esp. grapefruit orange), pine and flowery. Not the strongest nose but pleasant. Taste is grapefruit, lemon, pine resin but pretty nicely balanced with tastes of orange and sweet malts. The finish moves toward bitter but without assault - just notes that put a nice end on a good performance. Bravo. Mouthfeel is creamy, a little slick and medium-bodied. Great beer, and one even those who would not describe themselves as hopheads would enjoy. Just make sure to get it FRESH."
"D: This is one of my favorite IPAs, it is a great sipper and doesn't destroy your taste buds with over the top hops."
"D: For 7.1% it is very drinkable, and the profile has a little of everything to offer. I'd like a little less dryness if anything."
"D-This is a dangerously drinkable beer and it definitely belies it's 7% ABV.Easy to get caught up and drink a sixer."
"The flavor here is very herbal...and quite lemony, as well. It's got a serious citrus quality to it...giving it a nice bitter bite and a sweet drinkablility. The components to this beer all come together to create an outstanding ale, one that sits well on the palate, and one that is drinkable the whole night through."
"Poured a nice amber red with a 1 in. white head into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. This is one superbly balanced IPA. A good dose of hops but with plenty of malt backbone. I could drink alot of these in one sitting. One of the most quaffable IPAs out there. Highly recommended."
"The fact that this beer is not in the BA Top 100 blows my mind!"
"Overall this is a fairly light tasting IPA that is well balanced between light malt, citrus and grassy hop flavors and a smooth hop bitterness. I very much enjoyed drinking this beer but the aroma is a little weak for an IPA."
"D/O- A dame good American IPA that is perfectly balanced. Time for me to go and stock-up on this beauty. Well done Bell's. Highly recommended."
"D: I could drink this beer all day, a strong beer, that has just that subtle strong body to keep to on your toes, but ever so tasty to have you coming back for more."
"Very, very well done, and a deserved bright light in the beer sky. Its got a somewhat high ABV that precludes sessioning, and even starts pitching towards an imperial version, but man oh man, do Bell's know how to do hops!"
"Bell's Hearted Ale poured a golden color, with a bit of a smaller head. It smelt very hoppy. The taste was rather unique. There is a initial strong hoppy taste, but a very smooth finish. This makes it easier to drink, but a little bit of a weaker flavors, but IPA fans will still enjoy. Overall a very good beer, a bit more mild then other IPAss but will not disapoint."
"overall: meh a beer I was expecting more from this is the 2nd 6 pack I have been underwhelmed with a decent IPA but nothing I am going to buy again anytime soon."
"D: One sip only invites another."
"D: Fabulous American IPA. Similar, but superior to, the Smuttynose IPA."
"This stuff is great, I could drink it all the time. Quite hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Easily one of the very best single IPAs I've had, if not the very best. Thanks a ton, Dave!"
"O: This brew stands out for its balance of flavors, a treat that has been on the decline in craft IPA's it would seem. Don't confuse balance with absence however, this beer is very flavorful."
"D - YES please! Easily one of the best examples of a year round IPA on the market. A perfect mix between sweetness from the hops balanced with bitterness followed by a great malt character."
"Thanks again to BucketBoy for this gem! Pours a beautiful murky, golden/orange color with a gorgeous white head on it. Very nice lacing as well. The smell is SO fruity! I get delicious, real fruit juice, fruit snacks. Not the cheap ones either, the ones made with real fruit, that are impossible to stop eating. Never gotten this scent from an IPA before. I love it! Initially, I get that amazing fruit snack taste. Not the typical citrus tastes you get from an IPA...I'm getting the citrus along with berry flavor. I'm picking up boysenberries and raspberries too. Very interesting and delicious. I can't get over this flavor. A little melon lingers in the aftertaste. The hop flavorings and bitterness are not much different than HopSlam (HopSlam is just this on Steroids with honey). This mouthfeel is nothing less than perfect. Great drinkability...I hate (ABSOLUTELY HATE!!!) that I can't get this here in California!"
"Picked this up as part of a mix and match six pack from U Pick 6 in Erie, PA. Cloudy orange-yellow pour with nice creamy head and great lacing. The nose is huge and complex with loads of citrus and pine, nicely balanced with sweet malt. The taste is huge as well, just bursting with flavor. The tons of citrus and pine are the stars here, but it's perfectly balanced with nice sweet maltiness. The mouthfeel is awesome as well with a bit of oily, resin to it with a nice fresh, crisp finish. This is a hugely drinkable and enjoyable beer. I am definitely going back for a full six pack!"
"Drinkability - Because of the well-balanced taste and aftertaste, I'd give this a ranking as a good beer in general, as well as being worthy of a six pack."
"O Great beer. A nice go to IPA. I've had this beer in the past and it continues to be a good example."
"Overall - another great beer from Larry Bell"
"This is already a well-recognized IPA, and I'm just confirming its greatness. Delicious."
"D: For me this is one of the most drinkable 7% beers ever."
"This is a different IPA for me, and seems to stand on it's own as possibly a strong hoppy English style IPA. Not really comparable to any others that I've had."
"This was my first really great ""hoppy"" beer, and I love it above all others. This beer has the best first taste of hops that I have ever tasted. Unlike other hoppy beers, this hoppy taste does not sour, or linger too much with time, it just gives you a great crisp taste, and then you are ready for another mouthful. This beer inspired me to coin my handle ""Hoppensniffer", and I love it."
"D- A pleasant and enjoyable IPA to drink. Like I already said, the smell is what makes me keep drinking it. The bitterness also keeps bringing you back for more."
"D: Very drinkable, especially considering this is a six month old beer by the time I reviewed it. Fresh, I think this would be pushing into A+ territory."
"Taste is exceptional. A very well balanced IPA utilizing the malts and hops on a near perfect level. My first Bell's product and won't be my last, if it were only distributed somewhere in west or middle TN. Until then, I must prepare more trips to Bowling Green."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (batch 9637) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Color is a nice clear lightly tinted gold with a very nice head and lots of carbonation bubbles. Lots of floral hops in the aroma with a touch of light crystal malts. Taste is the same as smell, a very well balanced IPA. A medium bodied mouthfeel with a good hop bite. A very well done IPA that is easy to drink."
"I've loved this beer ever since Lisa C. brought it to a party of mine in Chicago about 5 years ago. So nice to revisit this time. It seemed much smoother than I remember, but I am guessing my hop-sensitivity has been dulled since then by infinite craft brew tasting sessions. So perhaps I should I add that this is indeed a hoppy beer -- buyer beware. Anyways, I hope my next pint of this isn't too far away. Here's to you, Lisa!"
"I can't possibly say enough about this beer, it is my ""desert island"" beer, and my favorite of the style hands down."
"Overall: Very solid IPA. I would definitely recommend this one."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but very smooth and creamy at the back end. The 7.1% is nonexistent and this beer goes down nice and easy. I only wish I could get more of it."
"Poured into my pint glass and quickly built up a massive white head that disappeared after a minute or so. Not crystal clear but damn close. Very hoppy in the nose, very citrusy and piney smelling with an underlying sweet malty smell. Tastes pretty delicious. Tastes very hoppy but not overpowering, citrusy, piney and sort of grassy hop taste with the malts hardly noticed in the background. Nice medium bodied and prickly mouthfeel. A nice beer that's easy to drink"
"Good IPA, this brewery was old school before I was in elementary school. Sure, it is not nearly as intense as many more recent examples, but it is a great example of the style."
"Very drinkable beer and a solid IPA, though I don't really feel it lives up to the hype."
"D: The beer is very drinkable and not a trace of alcohol is noticeable in the smell or taste."
"BOTTLE"
"Served from tap into a SweetWater standard pint. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one-finger white head with rainbow effects when held in the light. Lacing was excellent throughout. The aroma was comprised of hops and mild malt. The flavor was a smooth hoppy note with nice mellow malt notes. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. It has been quite awhile since I have had this brew and I had forgotten how good it was. Nothing short of excellent for sure. Believe the hype on this one... I will definitely be picking up more at the store next time I'm there."
"D: No real hints of the 7% ABV in this beer. The taste is light and clean and the finish is nice. I would gladly have another (or two)."
"Drinkability- Well I couldn't drink more than a few before needing a break from the hoppiness but I am sure I could toss back a sixer within a day. This is a great IPA that should be drank accordingly. Pour it and sip it taking in all the wonderful complexities of it and allow it to warm up as you drink it to see how it unravels this tapestry of flavor on your pallete. Bottom line are there better IPAs yeah but this one rises to the occasion. I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner."
"poured a orange to and amber color, with a white/ tan head. it smelled of citrus with flowery notes. The taste was superb with a clean finish, as well with the citrus. It is very easy to drink, is very refreshing to have on a warm summer evening."
"D: Great beer, have had one in the past that was an extra in a trade and had to get more. Have a sixer...had a sixer. And this is a great IPA. I haven't had a regular IPA as good as this one yet."
"D - This was gone in no time. The flowery, fruity start and just-hoppy-enough finish make this beaut drink like a soda pop. Very enjoyable, and this will be a go-to IPA this summer."
"All said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a masterpiece of a beer. I've never been disappointed in the slightest margin by Larry Bell, and this beer is no exception. I can comfortably call this a world class IPA and a brew that I am eternally grateful is easily accessible to me. Two Hearted is my go-to beer if I'm need of a flavorful yet still drinkable beer and will continue to buy this beer until it is no longer made."
"D - Great drinkability, one of the best go-to IPAs!"
"Pours a pale orange with thin white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of hops, but not as much as I'd expect. Quite sweet too, almost like honeydew melon. Taste has some citrus hop bitterness with lots of malt, with some floral hops on the after taste. I wondered if the bottle I got may have been old and missing some of the hop flavours that I expected, but I checked on Bell's website and it says it was bottled on May 4th. Still tastes good though."
"Consumed: 5/26/2010"
"D- The not too dryness of the aftertaste makes you want more and it's probably the best american IPA I've had"
"D- Easy to pound these wonderful beers. So easy to gain respect for with each subsequent beer that you drink. Great job Bell's."
"Here's to the best times, with the best friends, and the best IPA in the world."
"DRINKABILITY: This is definitely not a session beer. Since it is not pasteurized, its shelf life is questionable. But I plan to keep a six pack in my refrigerator for at least a year to see if bottle aging decreases the hops flavor compared with the malt flavor."
"i love this, super easy to drink. a hop bomb for the best of them. this is an IPA that sets the standard for all to follow. i love this and drink it often."
"Bitter orange is the predominant flavor. Very hoppy and bitter and exceptionally dry. The taste of alcohol comes in during the middle and it finishes dry and astringent in the mouth. While not the best IPA, this definitely delivers what it promises, tons and tons of hops."
"If it was available in California (it's not), I'd definitely drink this beer again."
"Super drinkable brew...right up there with the best of them. I had this in bottles before, but a fresh draft is the way to taste this one!"
"Can't believe I never had this before. Pours a clear copper to light amber with very good light foam head. White in appearance. Smelled of citrusy & fruitlike hop aroma. Taste gives qualities of mango, citrus, pineapple but overall provides bubblegum character. Mouthfeel was nice dry crisp-like. A very drinkable beer. Will be looking for more of this again soon!"
"D - can definitely see myself purchasing another pack. Enjoyable altogether."
"D: I could, and have, drank more than my share of these."
"Super nice IPA. Could drink this forever. A lttle embarassed to have not had it sooner. I think if the fish wasn't on the label I wouldn't have had so much bias against it going in. Embarassing for me? Yes. Good beer? Absolutely."
"My pour appeared a cloudy, dulled yellow color with a single finger head. Great citrus nose! I picked up strong citrus hops with pineapple and fresh cut/squeezed oranges. The taste continues with the orange notes, but less hops that I get on the nose. A very full mouthfeel and the body is spot on. I really enjoyed this beer and could do damage to a 6 pack on a hot summer day."
"This looks like a golden hazy beer with a nice billowy head on it that leaves some great lace on the sides of the glass at the beginning and throughout the drink in the entirety. It smells like hops and malts, very sweet, but a definite hoppy odor. It tastes hoppy but very sweet as well, just a touch bitter. I think this would be the perfect thirst quencher after doing something like mowing the lawn on a hot day. Can drink this all day."
"Summary: Good solid IPA. One that I will buy again. Would also satisfy those that don't like really bitter ales. Easy to like!"
"DB- Could be one of the better session beers I have tried. The price was great, the flavor was great and the ABV doesn't rear its head. The semi-subtle flavors allow the beer to take on a more refreshing feel. I gotta get a case of this stuff some time, great session beer."
"Drinkability: Regardless of ABv, this is one of a kind. This truly stands out in its class for IPAs. Distribution is limited on this one but if you can get your hands on it, get it."
"All in all, this was a great beer. I remember trying this brew years ago when I first started introducing myself to beers that didn't have the word ""Light"" in the front and I remember hating it. My, how my taste has changed."
"Overall, its a damn good beer- I can't pick out many things I dislike per se, but somehow it leaves me wanting more (besides a 2nd glass) pick one up for yourself and decide, its definitely worth a go"
"The drinkability is right where the taste is, which is perfect. I could drink this everyday for the rest of my life and would not complain. The only thing that stops me from drinking a case of this beer in a couple days is the 7% ABV which will make it's appearance after drinking 2 or 3 of them. A sixer is plenty and boy is it just a great beer! Bell's nailed this one."
"Easy to drink, but a bit heavy on the malt side and lacks the bitter hop punch I was expecting. Would make a good introduction to IPAs for someone not use to hoppy beers."
"No freshness date but you can find out when your beer was [packaged by looking up the batch number on bells website. Kind of a pain in the ass but better than no freshness date at all."
"Verdict: It's clear why Two Hearted has built such a great reputation; this is just a straightforward, well-crafted, and satisfying American IPA. After this introduction to Bell's I can't wait to try another of their beers."
"Libation: What a great beer! Solid throughout, and truly delicious. I feel fortunate that this beer is so freely available in this market. Great work from Bell's and especially impressive is the year round availability of such a solid offering."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth/crisp. Not overly carbonated, medium body."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D: Definitely has some character. Not a beer to drink quickly. Slow down and enjoy"
"D- Very nice drinkable IPA. A little strong to make a session of but a beer I will certainly drink again."
"Not at all what I was expecting. I was hoping the citrus and/or floral character from hops traditionally tossed in an American IPA would show in this brew. The bittering character was, in my opinion, too dry and lacked a friendlier complement. But, if you are into American IPA's that pack a bitter punch and leave the flower giving for anniversary celebrations, this one just might be what you are looking for."
"This is a good IPA. I guess the best way to descibe this one is balance. The hops don't overpower and blend smoothly with the malts. It has a nice simple citrus/hoppy aroma, but nothing earth shattering. This is definately the IPA to session with if you are careful of the ABV. The balance makes this one very easy to drink and doesn't kill your tastebuds after a couple. While not the greatest overall IPA, it is a very nice example of the style."
"IMO, all other IPA's should be compared to 2 hearted! This is my favorite all time beer!!!"
"D - Very enjoyable, very hopped up...I think more then one would fatigue my palette"
"Served out of a freshly tapped firkin. With a huge foamy frothy cream colored head. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is hoppy grapefruit malt caramel. Flavor is like aroma plus huge bittersweet. And caramel comes out too. Body is what you'd expect from this beer out of a firkin - low carbonation with full roundness. Finish is like flavor with a slow lingering sweetness that tapers off to a slight bitterness. Excellent beer. Session if you can get it."
"This is medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation and goes down quite smooth. Something fairly easy to drink even with all the hops, and very enjoyable."
"(Note: This was me trying to describe a non-fresh IPA.)"
"Very drinkable IPA that I enjoyed. Not overly hopped, but hopped just right."
"If I could get this brew in Seattle, I would have this all the time. Very drinkable. The 7+% ABV keeps this from a 5 for drinkability."
"Conclusion- A very nice American Pale Ale. Another stellar offering from Bell's. A little pricy, but you pay for quality... which is what I've always gotten from Bells."
"Some people think I shouldn't ""down"" my beers and just enjoy them. I agree somewhat, but I feel being able to finish off a beer quickly is a good test of drinkability. That being said, I think this beer definitely can be finished off quickly if you need to leave or something, but I don't think its a beer I would drink all night long. It just has a bit to much apparent sweetness for my preference."
"Pretty tasty beer, lots of flavor and very easy to drink. I had 3 of these before I realized it."
"Slightly hazy gold pour with a small foamy off-white head. Strong caramel malt aroma with a pronounced note of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. Lots of piney, grapefruit hop flavor with a solid caramel malt background. Nice creamy medium body. One of my all time favorite stand-by's."
"D- Very easy. A very good representation of the style and an easy drinking every day IPA."
"Poured a nice orangish golden from the bottle into a tumbler. Head was ample, though it laced minimally. Smell was citrus in nature with a nice malt backbone. Taste was orangy and grapefruity with some bitterness. Malts played a strong part. Feel was average with a nice crispness. Overall a better than average Imperial Pale Ale."
"Drinking this after a long jet-lagged week of work following a great trip to Japan the prior week. Pours hazy gold with poofy white head. Smells of biting floral and citrusy hops. Taste follows - fairly dry finish, but this definitely has some malt balance. Body and carbonation are medium. For an IPA, this is quite drinkable."
"D - This was very drinkable, although it didn't leave me anxiously craving for more."
"Poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. This is a light caramel colored beer. The pour delivers a quarter inch head that dissolves into lacing after a couple minutes. The smell of this bear makes me eager to drink it. It's a combination of peach, apricot, and orange. The taste is a pretty well balanced. There is just enough malt sweetness to carry the hops that are pronounced but not too too bitter. This is a nice light (in color and mouthfeel) beer that will be great going into Spring. This is a very drinkable beverage that is suitable to both beginners to the style and expert connoisseurs."

"Pours a cloudy golden with a puff of white fluffy, fluffy head. Smell is out-of-this-world super sweet double-down sweet corn. Phenomenal. Candy-like, and the taste bears a repeat.. candy-like, a beer starburst, hoppy skittles now available in golden IPA flavor! Finish is smooth, then dry and fleeting. Drink again. A 6 pack to savor this beer a few separate times is recommended."
"I've said in the past that casks don't really impress me unless they're of thick stouts, but I think I'm going to have to amend that for exceptionally balanced IPAs. This isn't *quite* at the level of cask Masala Mama, but it's damn close."
"D- The nicely balanced hoppiness makes this very drinkable."
"Overall- Very well-done IPA. Something that has great drinkability and is a nice IPA. Lacks the dank, earthy flavors that some enjoy; however, this one is a great example of the style and for an IPA is perfectly balanced with the malt coming through in the finish and working well with the overall bitterness."
"D - Very sessionable beer. I could get used to this."
"D: Very sessionable IPA. Wish we had access to this longer than the half year or so it's been in our state. My go to IPA in town alongside Sweetwater IPA."
"I cannot say enough good things about this beer. It's spectacular out of the bottle and even better on tap. If you happen to buy it in the bottle, don't sit on it, drink it promptly, it won't age well - really hoppy beers rarely do. Do not pass up an opportunity to try this beer."
"Pours hazy golden orange decent head. Beautiful lavender floral hops with a hint of lemon. Very refreshing lemon honey sweetness on the tongu. Then, and slow very mild bitter finish. Leaves a great sweet floral honey aftertaste on the tongue. Nice amount of activity on the tongue and a smooth medium body. Absolutely amazing for the ABV and so incredibly refreshing."
"Pours a beautiful hazy dark golden color, capped off with a rocky white head. Looks beautiful in the Bell's tulip; very inviting. Mildly hoppy aroma, some apricot, orange. Taking the first drink I notice a bit of hoppiness, some citrus, and a bit of malt. Dangerously drinkable at 7%, not up to the level of the some of the West Coast hop bombs."
"Can't wait for another."
"M/D medium bodied and good carbonation for this style of beer. good drinkability."
"D-This is a nice light tasting beer with flavors that do not overpower you and would be great on a summer's evening on the patio."
"Mouth/Drink: Medium bodied, smooth and crisp. Its perfect. Drinkablity? As good as it gets. I wish this was available to me, I'd drink it all day (well.. night)!"
"D - A very well balanced, tasty IPA. I'd give it a higher drinkability score, but the 7% abv catches up to you quick. Otherwise, I'd drink it all night."
"D- Great beer. Its a nice gateway IPA before you get into the harder stuff that is absolutely overloaded with hops. I'm going to pick up more of this in the future if I'm in the mood for an IPA."
"I tried Hopslam when it first came to my beer store this year without ever trying Two Hearted. I kept passing over Two Hearted with the idea that since I had tried the Hopslam I would only be disappointed with its little brother. Boy was I wrong. I put this up there with Torpedo from SN and Sweetwater's IPA as some of my favorite IPA's readily available in my area. I've had both of them less than ten days old and can't wait to try a fresher batch of Two Hearted. I'm going to have to do a taste test with all three at the same time to see which of them my overall favorite is but I think that Two Hearted may be an early favorite."
"Drinkability - 7%, great amount of alcohol, obviously no burn, a great flavor, and even better taste. Will have this whenever I'm outside NY!"
"D= 5.0 (session) This is the perfect example of what I consider a session beer. It's not particularly high in alcohol, it's very well balanced, and you could drink more than one without feeling any ill effects. The beer changes character with a mild complexity each sip as it warms and has is a great addition to any fridge or beer collection. I would seek this beer out if you have not had it and on draft it is a must. Cheers!"
"DRINKABILITY AND OVERALL THOUGHTS- I remain somewhat biased towards this beer, but because a combination of its somewhat mild flavor and wonderful aroma with a medium ABV,I consider this THE perfect session IPA. If you enjoy Bell's style and IPAs I would also recommend their seasonal Hopslam IPA which I would consider a more extreme Two Hearted."
"Overall, very similar to my on tap review. A very good IPA and the only differences it seems were that I found the nose to be much better out of the bottle though the flavor slightly less interesting. Definitely give this one a shot."
"Overall Impression: This beer may have benefited from me drinking the Firestone Walker Double Jack right before it. It was a very enjoyable IPA served on cask; what's not to love about that?"
"D - This is a great easy drinking IPA, Bell's makes some damn good IPA's, Highly recommended!"
"D: Exceptional for an IPA."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that's fine, as IPAs that are too heavy strike me as kind of odd. The resin like quality of the hops as a nice touch to the body. The finish is actually a bit watery, but this beer is more refreshing than overwhelming. It's actually really easy to drink, and the 7% abv can sneak up with the quickness. My first IPA, and one that I will always be in love with."
"D: Not my favorite IPA, but a very good one nonetheless. I enjoyed the flavor's great balance between tropical sweetness and hop bitterness. I'm glad I picked up an entire 6 pack when I was in Cleveland last week."
"D - An excellent IPA. Definitley one that I will buy regularly."
"D: its ok not my favorite beers, but i am not a IPA drinker so just my opinion though"
"D-Low carbonation makes for a very drinkable IPA. In fact this may be the most drinkable IPA I have had to date. I enjoyed quite a few of these brews. I would highly recommend this brew to the most seasoned palate or to your busch light drinking friends."
"Still relatively new to craft beers, this one lives up to the hype for me. I can see why people tend to like it so well, and Bell's Brewery in general."
"Pretty good IPA, lacking a little in the balance department but still a nice easy drinking hoppy brew..."
"This is the go-to beer for my wife and I. Every grocery store carries it in our area, and when in doubt, we can pick this up and not be disappointed. It smell amazing, tastes amazing, and provides the perfect balance for us -- That's not to say that it is ""well balanced"". This is most definitely a hoppy pale ale, but one of the best, for sure."
"Taste is quite bitter with a real harsh finish. There is some more of these fruity and citrusy notes as well in the taste. Mouthfeel is fairly cram and sharp. Somewhat hard to drink just because it's so harsh. This is an ipa that would improve with age."
"Had on tap at Dicky's Wild Hare. Came with slight lacing to it. Good golden brown color. Smelled of grapefruit and citrus. For a 7% abv man alive could I put this one down alot. The hop flavor is awesome. There is a slight biscuit smell and flavor as well. As it warms the bitterness fades slightly. All in all a very great beer. One of my favorites."
"D - Extremely drinkable for a 7% beer. This may get dangerous... 4.0"
"pours a slightly hazed golden yellow/amber with a one finger off white that dissipates in about a minute. the aroma is outstanding, hoppy and citrus. simple and yet brilliant. green apples, tropical fruits, and flora. the taste is grapefruit, pine hops, biscuity bread, slight caramel malt, and bitters. completely masked alcohol. the drinkability is a 5 out of 5 no question. i could drink 32 of these. always a winner. a true benchmark IPA."
"Great IPA. I personally prefer a bit more Tropical flavors for perfection, but this one is very solid and def top 10 for the style, maybe higher."
"If I'm in the mood for a hoppy beer, this one is always a good standby, I've had this many times on tap, and even more in bottles... But is a fantastic beer that I would rank up there with many of the best IPAs and DIPAs I've had -- at least in terms of drinkability!"
"D - i could see myself housing a bunch of these."
"D - What an amazing IPA! This has got to be my favorite. It is so well balanced and has everything I would want in an IPA. For the ABV it is super drinkable and so enjoyable to drink. If I could only drink one IPA for the rest of my life this might just be it!"
"Awesome brew for hopheads. absolutely delicious."
"Overall, this AIPA is a bit off-flavor as the style goes. Hops don't linger long and they are not particularly bitter. I prefer a much stronger bitter-tone in an AIPA. Still, this beer is rich and full of flavor."
"UPDATE: This is the most consistent elite beer I've found. Even on the West Coast my brother tells me the Pliny has been slowly degrading. I also find variation between some of the IRS's I like, except Rasputin."
"Poured a cloudy honey yellow with an orange hue. The head was perfect, two fingers of thick white beauty that stuck around throughout most of the glass. Lots of heavy lacing. The aroma was just as beautiful as the appearance. Lots of sweet tropical fruits, pine, slight hint of citrus, dough, and a wood pulp scent. Very complex and balanced. The flavors follow suit with the nose. Very pleasant and great balance of the flavors. Lots of hop flavors mixed well with the malty sweetness. It has a medium body, it feels creamy almost; must be the cask. It has a nice bitter finish. Each sip begs you to take another. So many subtle flavors, each on teasing you to figure them out. Nice body, not to heavy. Goes very well with pup grub."
"To me if you can get this on tap it is much better.Something a tad off when bottled."
"M/D: light bodied without being thin. Pleasant bitterness left in the back of your throat. Very smooth, easy to drink. Refreshing. Almost, too easy. I could drink this all day long."
"Bell's Two Hearted poured into standard pint glass garners big foamy off-white head three fingers high. The color of the brew is lighter than one would expect from a big flavorful IPA, something almost close to a macro brew. One whiff of this lad and there is no doubt that Two Hearted is not some crappy macro brew. Fine white silky lacing is left on my glass as I sip away. An abundance of floral hops hits the nose hard. Two Hearted is one of the best smelling beers in all the land. The first swig of this brew and you will be about knocked over by the hop punch. Citrus and piney hop notes continue to evolve and make this one of the best IPA's available. Two Hearted has a level mouthfeel that easily hides the 7% ABV. The drinkabilitiy is dangerously smooth as Two Hearted has lead to too many rough mornings by people who have mistakenly made Two Hearted their session beer for an evening."
"M & D - Light body with nice CO2 and a light and subdued feel. Refreshing with a slightly higher ABV."
"This is my favourite ""go to"" beer. For a 7%ABV it does not taste like that. It really is juicy and bitter, with a superb malt backing. Balanced! Delicious."
"The hop aroma in this beer is just amazing. Floral, citrusy and fruity sweet and strong. The flavor has plenty of bitterness, but it's not over the top, it's nice and balanced with malt. Mouthfeel is dry, leaving you wanting more. It's not overly bitter, so it's very drinkable. One of my new favorites."
"D- Awesome at home for a single during the week, even better out at McShea's on draft for an extended drink."
"D: So smooth and easy to drink. A top 5 IPA for me"
"Pours a golden yellow with a white head about a cm in thickness. Aroma has a mix of citrus fruits, hops, and sweet malts. Taste was a mix of citrus ""juice", alcohol, and hops. However, the taste wasn't that strong, a bit watery. Thickness was good, not too much excess carbonation. For a 7%, isn't too strong, could drink anytime."
"D- highly drinkable, very light and refreshing while still providing a big ipa hop presence a great balance of ipa flavor while still being very refreshing"
"very nice aroma and Bold taste, great from the tap or bottle."
"definitely my type of beer."
"Drinkability is very good. Very well-balanced, and easy to drink for a fairly high ABV IPA. Tasty."
"This is a great beer."
"Overall, I can see why Bell's Two Hearted is ranked as a Top 100 U.S. beer, and the low bitterness makes this a crowd pleaser. A flavourful and unique IPA."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a two finger head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is a wonderful mix of floral hops and malts - still quite pungent even towards the end of the bottle! Taste is very well balanced. Cereal malts blend wonderfully with piney and citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is very good. This is one of the best balanced IPAs I have ever had. At 7.0 abv it is definitely not sessionable but dangerously drinkable - found that out while drinking it on tap at Old Chicago a few weeks back! I am so happy the Cubs have Spring Training here in Arizona!"
"Overall, my favorite offering from Bell's and a go to beer."
"Pours a hazy orange, hinting at its citrus hop flavor and aroma character. I picked up a funny, damp smell that was a bit unusual, nothing off-putting though. Taste was full of sharp and crisp grapefruit, orange, and floral tones with the occasional tinge of grassiness (from too much dry-hopping?). Bitterness lingers a bit on the finish and mouthfeel runs a little light, but it works. Reminds me of a nicely dry-hopped homebrewed IPA. Very delicious, get some if you get the chance!"
"This is one easy-drinking IPA. I could sip this one all night while shooting the shit with friends -- which is precisely what I did."
"D: Good hops, good malt, good spice. Very easy, yet very flavorful. I'm really interested in trying this fresh on tap."
"D: uh-oh; too drinkable for a beer with this amount of alcohol."
"2 words describe this beer: 'fan', and 'tastic'."
"Very drinkable, and a very smooth beer all around."
"Pale hazy gold in color. Head was thin and lacing was minimal. Not sure if the type of glass was the reason for this or not. Smells floral and fresh like the first day of spring. The palate on this beer is quite pleasing. Citric and piney with soft bitterness. Malt and hop selection mesh well making for a balanced IPA with loads of flavor without being too aggressive like many highly hopped beers. Moderate in body and very dry with a crisp feel on the tongue. One of the most drinkable IPA's that I've had, thanks to the softness of the bitterness. We shall meet again. Soon."
"(d) For a beer that brags on its hops this beer offers superb drinkability. Keep em coming. (4.5/5)"
"Overall I think this is a very good beer! I have had other beers from Bell's and have always been happy. I also notictied at the liqour store that you know can get a 5 liter (1.32) gal. mini keg of Two hearted ale for your fridge! I thought that was pretty cool."
"D- I could drink it all night. Goes down SUPER easy. Overall pretty good beer."
"i did give this one straight 4's because although it is a truly great beer, i feel like something isnt there that is making it highly rememberable and that will stick out like a sore thumb in my mind."
"overall it's a good beer so try it if you can but I just dont think it's as good as some others that are not in the top 100."
"D: Definitly a drinker but be carefull at 7.1%"
"d - Very nice and balanced. The hops didn't stand out as much as I thought they would, but the balance and smoothness from the malts was a pleasant surprise. Great taste and easy to drink, I'll surely be trying this again."
"Those Bells boys in Kalamazoo know what they're doing. I've only been disappointed with 1 or 2 out of the 10-15 beers of theirs that I've tried."
"I love the taste of this one, nothing jumps out at me as far as flavor, not too light, but more on the hoppy side. Strong, but very drinkable on a nice day as it is today. Out of the bottle the color is a light orange head lasted for a couple minutes. The smell of this one does not pop out at you as some IPA's do, but the taste is a reminder of what a good IPA should be. Overall a great beer and will definitely be drinking more of these guys."
"Thanks to Icetraxx for this beer. Pours a light orange color, with a hoppy aroma, not too sweet and nothing really grabs me. Good taste, the hops are balanced out by a sweet taste that I did not smell. Im not the largest fan of IPA's but it was not bad by any means."
"This is very drinkable beer. It goes down smoothly. The balance of the bitterness of the hops with the sweet of the citrus makes it a comfortable beer to drink, unlike some IPA's which are more of an assault (as wonderful as that assault might be) on the pallet."
"D – Hell yeah. Probably best on-tap, too."
"A light to medium body and it clings to the tongue a bit. This beer seemed like Hopslam light to me, but definitely in a good way. While not having the heavier bitterness and hoppiness of its DIPA counterpart, this beer still offers a tasty, balanced beer."
"D Fair to good. The hop levels are too high for me but there is enough balance to make this a really interesting beer, one that I would certainly look for again. 3.5"
"I miss you Prem, may china treat you well"
"D: Drinkability is great! The nice hop bitterness and clean finish leave you wanting more. I can see myself drinking a quite a few of these on a warm summer day."
"I hardly know what to say about this beer. I have more Two Hearted under (beneath?) my belt than any other beer. Impeccably balanced hops and malt hid the abv so well that I only recently discovered how high it is-- by chancing upon the mini-keg version."
"This is an excellent IPA. One of the best out there. It's just smooth and easy, but with plenty of pop. I really like it and just wish it was more available. This beer deserves the accolades."
"Overall, what can I really add that hasn't already been said? This is an excellent IPA and deserves the rating it gets. Maybe even a better one. If I had access to this all the time, I'm sure there would always be one in the fridge. Nice work Bell's!"
"Overall a very nice IPA. I am a lucky girl to get to try this one."
"This beer is probably the most easy drinking IPA or beer at an ABV of 7% I've encountered. The carbonation seems to be at a perfect level in order to take that bitterness away so the palette doesn't become fatigued after several. I could drink a 6-pack of this no problem and I see why they sell 5-liter mini-kegs."
"Thanks to hayesez for hooking me up with this!"
"Poured from my home tap, this one has a golden orange color with a billowy, off-white head. The color is deceptively light compared to the flavors packed inside. Very fragrant, with the aroma having a complex hop character that is both citrusy and earthy. The flavor amplifies these characteristics, with notes of grapefruit, pine, and grass. This is not just another hop-bomb, though, as there is also at least a bit of balance from an underlying caramel malt sweetness (but the malt aspect is certainly subtle compared to the hops). The mouthfeel is both crisp and resinous somehow, with a refreshing, hoppy bite that morphs into a sticky, lingering bitterness. Overall, it's wonderfully bitter, yet quite drinkable, especially considering the 7% alcohol. I've had Dogfish 60-minute and Foothills Hoppyum on my tap before this one, and Two-Hearted is as good if not better in some aspects. It is certainly a go-to beer for the style."
"D- Good beer, nothing too exciting about this one, but it can be drank in large quantities. Overall, it's pretty balanced, but nothing too special about this beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Hazy gold in color with a sticky, white, 2 finger head. The aroma is full of grape fruit and mango. The flavor follows and has a long lingering finsish. A solid medium bodied brew that is very drinkable. A solid middle of the road IPA."
"Looks and smells like an IPA. Golden-orange in color with a nice orangeish head that retains very well throughout the entirety of the glass. The smell is floral and citrus. Taste reflects the smell and is very well-balanced. The drinkability is where I think this IPA really shines though. Far smoother than any other IPA I've ever had. It's not usually a quality I expect from an IPA, and I don't think I've ever encountered this level of smoothness in any other IPA. Overall very good."
"D: Not my favorite American IPA but pretty tasty none the less."
"The balance is incredible, it is not guilty of overkill on any one thing (hop aroma, malt, bitter, etc.) just damn well balanced. A standby for sure."
"D: Easily drinkable--though it's in the mid-range as far as ABVs are concerned, it still drinks pretty well. Definitely a unique brew and very interestingly blended. It's a great session beer, and while I've had it enough times for it to lose a bit of its novelty, I'm still coming back to it. I'll have to do a review out of the bottle at some point--I swear it's better (though maybe the kegs I've had it from weren't the best?) and might bump the rating up a bit."
"Had this on tap today for lunch at Brixx in GSO. Came out a musrk dark gold with a thin white head on top. Retained a bit, but it left great perfect sip rings after every swig. Scents of floral hops, citrus rinds and sweet candy. This smells really inviting. The body is smooth and slightly oily on the tongue. Crisp carbonation backs it up well. Nice sharp bitter hops right away, but nothing that is too harsh or scalding. Finishes sweet like honey biscuits. Wow. I've had this in bottle form, but much prefer it on tap. Excellent."
"D: Fantastic. I can never believe this beer is 7% abv. I could drink a pitcher of this beer myself easily, but it satisfies even with just a pint."
"taste - art! floral hops indeed, but a malt to balance a great finish that anticipates bitterness but is just right."
"Overall a great american styled IPA from Bell's Brewery."
"Could use a freshness date, Ive gotten some older ones of these. -.5 drinkability."
"I had this from a 5L keg. It poured unfiltered orange with a big foamy head that clung to the glass the entire time. The aroma was a sweet grapefruit and roses. The taste is were I was a little lost. The sweetness of malt jumped upfront and then the bitterness was there, but not as pronounced. The hop oils coated your mouth from start to finish. The body was big and filling. I like it better from a bottle, IMO."
"Very drinkable and easy going on the palate despite the dominating hops."
"D - This is one definately great beer that one could have many of and keep enjoying."
"Bell's really knocked this one out of the park. I could drink a six pack of this in one night and not regret it at all, no matter what the next morning held for me. Just a very well put-together American IPA that doesn't disappoint in any of the categories and excels in most. A very solid choice for my 100th review. Here's to you, Two Hearted. Can I toast the beer that I'm drinking?"
"Tastes like something you can drink a lot of, but the 7% will get you if you try."
"Two Hearted is a very good IPA that is even better as a cask ale."
"Pours a gold/light orange color, aroma is hops and some sweetness, nothing too special there. The taste is very interesting with a solid balance of piney hop bitterness and sugar cookie sweetness. I notice how sweet this beer is more than anything, which I enjoy, but it does fatigue me after about 20oz. I think this is one of the top 5 east coast style IPAs out there, but compared to the hop blast of the west coast versions, it doesn't hold up. But I do order it every time I am in the midwest."
"Pours a solid copper hue with a frothy top. Decent lacing. Aroma is strong on the citrus hops but with some florals there to help balance things. Flavor and mouthfeel are very heavy on the bitter. If you're not into IPAs, it might be a bit too much like drinking pinesol but if you're into the style it's a great hop-heavy-but-not-ridiculous IPA. This has earned a place in my top 5 or so IPAs."
"Overall, Two Hearted Ale is classic standby in the style, and an absolute go-to beer for myself. The price-tag is a bit hefty, but I'm of the mind that if a beer is worth it, price isn't of matter. Although, the price would almost certainly exclude this from being an everyday drinker. Regardless, Two Hearted is highly recommended for anyone calling his/herself an IPA fan."
"still a flavorful & refreshing beer."
"Damn it. I was waiting in hopes of getting a fresh one. Well mine was bottled on oct 28 or something. About 2 1/2 months old I really wanted a fresher one. Well the taste is good. I am not a huge hop head and only drink IPA's every couple of weeks and not many doubles for that matter. And really this tastes good but Not as much hop as I was expecting. Anyways had a kinda dry mouthfeel and adequate carbonation decent head retention, Piney then citrus hops. Very drinkable stuff and not too overpowering could get you in some trouble with the 7% and tasting like this. A good IPA, Even though Michigan is close unless I can get it fresher I will stick with the Wisconsin IPA's"
"O: The first IPA that I have loved. Delicious and ""moreish", a 12oz bottle is never quite enough. Thanks, Bell's, for enticing me to try more beers of the IPA style. Bell's Two Hearted is one of the few beers that really is more than the sum of it's parts."
"D- Fairly high, I enjoyed it. If it was in my distribution circle I'd get a 6er every once in a while. Not as 'wowed' as I thought I might be, still a pretty good beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very light but keeps a very strong flavor. Light carbonation but hard to drink a lot of different beers after this."
"PoW! Wow! I have had this many times now and it was my 1st try at this style of beer. I must say it is not for the faint of taste! Smells of piney hops and taste to match it. Bitter oh yes! Looks good and feels good in your mouth. (make sure to decant this one though!) Amazing frothy head with fairly nice sticky lacing for this style. Smooth and drinkable for its style, not over carbonated. Lacking a bit on depth of taste but I believe it fits its style nicely. 2 or 3 will go down great on a hot day but the high alcohol content will knock you down fairly quickly! Not sessionable for me but a good start to a tasty evening of drinks. Yum."
"World class easy drinking beer. Well done Bell's (again)."
"Notes: My wife was drinking a Stone IPA while I was drinking this, so I did the Pepsi challenge. We both liked the Two Hearted better. It's lighter and a bit finer, but went down more easily. If I had access to this in NY, I would buy it by the case."
"Wonderful smelling, incredibly drinkable, delicious IPA. One of my favorites."
"As a guy who generally is not a big fan of hoppy beers, this is the one IPA that really does it for me. Just a tremendous accomplishment by Bell's. Plenty of flavor and finds a way to not overtake the flavor with hops overkill. Citrus in the notes and a Bubble-gum like flavor at the end, just an outstanding brew. The pinnicle of IPAs in my humble opinion."
"Bells Two Hearted pours a slightly hazy light gold with a thin but lingering head. The aroma is sweet and citrusy. Tons of orange and tangerine with no hint of bitterness. The bitterness is apparent in the flavor, it hits upfront with some nice light malty sweetness. Grapefruit and herbal hop flavor come through in the finish, with lingering an earthy resin bitterness. It's nice and smooth, I would never guess it was 7%. This beer is a steal at under $8 for 6."
"d - great beer and a standard-bearer when it comes to AIPAs."
"Drinkability? Give me a case and lock me in a closet for a week. I'll emerge a better man."
"Rich golden color with a nice white head that stays for a bit and laces nicely. Smells of sweet hops, a bit bitter with some bite. First drink was a lot of flavor, crisp and bold. There was some bitterness at first but it smooths out into citrus flavor. The hop flavor balances out with the citrus finish and the bitterness smooths out and add a nice crispness to the drink. Easy on the mouth and easy going down.."
"D) VERY good. I love IPAs, and this one was no exception."
"A very drinkable and well-crafted beer, it has everything if not more than I would expect from an American IPA. Extremely flavourful and well balanced this beer plays on itself first by captivating you with it's deep amber and frothing white head. It takes hold with it's magnificent aroma of grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a hint of sweet fruit. The flavour drags you in with a ridiculously large grapefruit and citrus flavour congruous to the bittering subtleties of the hops. The feel of this beer in your mouth and it's sheer need to be consumed get you hooked. I set this beer as the standard to which all others in this style strive to reach."
"Overall this American IPA lives up to its hype and Bell's has created one of my go to IPAs. If you can find this on-tap, try it. Highly Recommended."
"All-in-all, I like this beer very much, and would not hesitate to purchase it... in the absence of Stone IPA."
"IPA's are not my favorite style of beer, but I can say without hesitation that this is my favorite IPA I've tried thus far."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a large white head, which stays around throughout the drinking process. The aroma is lots of citrus with both orange and apricot notes. You also get some floral and pine aromas. The flavor is relatively bitter with a strong orange/citrus aftertaste. Very tasty. Thin-medium mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. A great IPA that lives up to the hype."
"D: Very drinkable and delicious IPA; one of my favorites"
"Still one of the standard bearers of an IPA, IMO..."
"Notes: This is one of my all time favorite IPAs. Everything is in perfect balance, but doesn't sacrifice anything. The hops don't overwhelm you, but all the flavor is still there."
"D - This is a great beer, very sessionable. Its a shame its not available in NYC."
"D: Drinkability is exceptional, even for this style."
"Drinkability: A superior IPA and a great beer. Despite its heavy hoppiness, this beer is extremely drinkable and quite tasty. I highly recommend it."
"DRINKABILITY- i dont remember!!!"
"D - love the low abv's and how this hoppiness isn't too much to the point where it destroys your palate.. i could easily put down a few of these.. but i'm in CT and these are kinda special we can't get them at our local stores... if we could this would be a regular for me.. i'm a huge smutty ipa guy and this wouldn't totally change that, but i'd look forward to this pretty often!!"
"I think I may have been looking forward to this one too much. I was expecting just a little more flavor but I was in no way disappointed."
"Its a good session IPA"
"Not bad at all. A pretty standard American IPA with a bit more alcohol. If you are a hop head this will be a treat."
"D: The 7% + ABV saddens me because it feels like heaven in my mouth. I would love to drink this all night... and I have tried, but to enjoy it down one and casually drink the rest. In PA its a $40 case so I can't have it all the time. When I can buy it I do Two Hearted has made it harder for me to try new brews I just cant get enough."
"A great brew, and I'm very glad I've got 5 more to drink."
"Overall, this one lived up to it's reputation. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had, and that says a lot as I tend to gravitate towards this style and its imperial older brother."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Very smooth and easy on the stomach."
"Surprisingly easy to drink, I could get used to this. Just dry enough to keep me coming back for more."
"Value: I've seen this for up to $14.00 per six pack. That's awful pricey for my blood. I'd go $12.00 on as sixer."
"Pours a bright copper color with a half inch of fluffy, sticky head. The head dissipates in the middle but sticks to the glass around the sides. Smells of very sweet citrusy hops. Two Hearted's scent and flavor match perfectly as sweet citrus hops dominate the flavor with a touch of grass in the aftertaste. Although the beer smells and tastes sweet it is not cloying. This ale has a very slick mouthfeel with good carbonation. An excellent beer that is sweet and hoppy which is easy to drink. Great for any hophead who enjoys a flavorful beer."
"Pours a nice amber color with a two-finger thick white head. Light cascading lace. Aroma is pretty intense hops with notes of grass/floral and light citrus. Taste brings much of the same - despite the intense hops, the taste isn't especially bitter for the style. Smooth mouthfeel and good carbonation. Quite drinkable."
"Flavor is also more hop based than malty. I thought the alcohol was a little light and I thought this would be a better West Coast Pale Ale than an IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability for this beer is excellent as I said I thought it was more of a West Coast Pale Ale than an IPA."
"All in all, this is a good IPA to try at least once no matter what style you like. I need me a dark beer now."
"D-one of my go to beers, i drink this all the time whenever i want a great tasting ipa that is readily available. gotta love bell's!"
"While this beer is pleasant for one pint, I don't know that I could handle another. The flavors are very strong, and as I said, bordering on pushing it too far. It may be too much for someone who is not a hops-lover. However, this is a well-made beer, worthy of a try."
"Pours a deep, clear, golden color with an ambitious white head that leaves behing a sticky lacing. Aroma is dominated by citrus (lemon and orange notes) as well as pine, with a slight caramel aroma underneath it. Taste features a prominent hop bitterness to begin, but is balanced a slight caramel sweetness and a short finish. In all honesty, it seemed a bit watery, and the short finish, which makes it drinkable, undermines it."
"Drinkability: Not very drinkable. Its nice to pour a pint or so, and then just sip on it for a while. Otherwise its a bit too strong and one dimensional with the hoppiness to really enjoy quickly or a number of times. Plus, its rather alcoholic..."
"A slightly hazy (but very clear for an unfiltered beer) light orange colour with a thick white head that leaves lace for days. Hoppy smell is present, and the citrus is very nice. As the beer warms the citrus becomes more and more prevalent, nudging the score up a slight bit. The taste is something to behold. I gave this the full 5 and i don't question that rating one bit. Grapefruit is noticeable right off the bat, and while many times you hear the term ""hop bomb"" used to describe the strong taste that we come to associate with a good IPA, this is more of a ""hop delivery"". Every sip brings more wonderful hops taste without ever being overly strong or too bitter. A perfect taste every time, that feels just right. Great feeling, not too carbonated, and the aftertaste is almost as delicious as the taste. If i could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be a serious contender. If i could only drink one IPA for the rest of my life, this would be the frontrunner by a large margin, like a Barack Obama to Al Sharpton margin"
"hops are floral aroma with hints of grapefruit, color of medium amber, opaque and hazy, nice off-white head, foamy with great lacing, lightly sour taste and a medium bitterness, nice malty flavor with perfect hops balance, medium body, soft carbonation, a long dry bitter finish"
"I would be a happy man if my fridge was filled with this and some 90 min for the rest of my life. A solid, solid brew."
"12-oz bottle. Slightly hazy golden color. Stiff ample white head that persisted for 15 minutes. Strong pleasant citrus aroma. Medium body with a creamier texture than I expected. Mild sweetness blending quickly into orange and then orange peel. Hoppy without being overpowering. Immensely drinkable. My favorite IPA. No, wait. My favorite beer, period. I continue to be impressed with the offerings from Bell's!"
"D - VERY drinkable. A good ABV that lets you drink all night long. Not harsh, but the carbonation sure gives you a belch or two. A very complex and self-complimenting beer. Hands down a favorite, whatever the style of beer."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a beer that I buy frequently, it's a great beer to take to parties or to have when you want a few. I consider this my go to IPA that I have readily available to me."
"Drinkability: A pretty good IPA. Balance seemed to be more well maintained when it was colder-hops sort of fall flat as it warms up and its overall a bit less interesting. Good news is, the astringency also relaxes as the temperature increases. Not a great beer, but a good one. I'd quaff a couple with some Belgian fries..."
"Drinkability- Nicht so gut. I can see myself having maybe two of these over the course of a long evening but for me is a beer to be enjoyed in small quantities."
"Tastes like biscuits, pine, citrus grapefruit and orange, very bitter, slight metallic flavor also. This is a not a perfectly 'balanced' ipa, but I dont think that was the point to begin with. At 7 percent, this is a nice American IPA. The end taste is a slight bitterness which might be from boiling too many IBUs into this beer. Seems to have a similar chalky taste as I have seen in other Bells beers, but it is definitely a tasty IPA and would be easy to keep these on hand."
"This beer is put together very well, and is one of my favorite ipa's. Price was not bad either! I would have this in my fridge at all times if possible."
"My buddy says ""It just smells like God's vagina!"""
"Overall this seems to be a very nicely balanced IPA. I'm still new to the genre but it seems this is a great place to start. I haven't been let down by a Bell's brew yet. Definitely need to keep trying their stuff."
"D: Give me more because this is a solid IPA when fresh!"
"Two Hearted is medium-bodied and just slightly coats the mouth with oily hop goodness. Moderate alcohol level is hidden well, unlike many beers from Bell's. An infinitely-drinkable, well-balanced IPA."
"Pours a kind of pale color, still nice looking, crystal clear, until the last little bit of sediment falls in, then falls back out quickly. The head is massive, almost too big, but fits perfectly in my glass, almost an inch, maybe more, white and sticky, leaves lacing as it starts to collapse, lasts for a while. I can forgive the light color for the other nice aspects. The smell is very nice, just all centennial as far as I can smell. Flowers, resins, pollen, and a nice kick of lemon and tangerine. The malt provides a slight bready sweetness, but not sticky and bready like some. Great smell, though I might like a little more toasty malt. The taste is good, but it seems flatter on the hop front that the smell would suggest. I primarily get a light-bodies sweetness, with a strong bitterness with some slight floral, almost piney, leafiness. The fruit comes through a bit in the end, mangoes, oranges, a tiny bit of grapefruit, then it finishes with a very light, kind of sugary, though still containing some bitterness, malt body. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin. Not much breadiness, mostly some slightly sugar syrup kind of flavors. I would like a bit more. The carbonation is right on, a slight bite as it goes down. The ABV is a little higher than I'd like, though it's less apparent in the taste than I expected. Still, very enjoyable, one of the better IPAs out there, but there seems to be a bit of room for improvement."
"An all around great beer. I drank this 1.23 gallon ""party keg"" of beer over five days and it never lost its carbonation. What a value when you can depend on the vessel to provide the proper carbonation. Great value!"
"Pours a lighter shade of golden amber, full frothy white head, good retention and lacing. Smell is of floral and citrus hops and biscuity malts. Taste brings the floral and citrus hops, adds a touch of pine. Bisuity and yeasty backbone. Smooth, medium bodied, clean aftertaste. Very good IPA with a nice hop profile and malt backbone."
"Overall: Good beer, pick up a sixer and have at it. Let it warm up to get all the hidden flavors."
"This is probably my favorite American IPA. I have tried a ton of IPA's lately, and this one just blew me away. The smell, the taste, the drinkability, the balance are all phenomenal! Two Hearted Ale is an damn good beer. Scratch that, GREAT beer. It's tastes very fresh in comparison to a lot of IPA's I've tried. If you're a fan of this beer style, you should definitely check this one out."
"Golden in color with a nice two finger head. Tons of lacing are left on the glass. It smells like hops. Citrus, grass, and pine are all evident. The taste is alot of the same. There is also some grainy sweetness in the aftertaste to slightly compliment all the hops. The mouthfeel is lite but that adds to the drinkablilty. For such high alc it is very refreshing and I go back for many more."
"-very drinkable. a good tasty beer overall. is an A on here for a reason"
"Drinkability is dangerous as it goes down quite easy. The ABV will prevent you from over indulging too much."
"While not my first choice for an IPA due to the fact that I always find the hoppiness a little harsh, this is no doubt a solid IPA."
"D-Crazy good! This, already very good beer, is off the hizey served on cask! So glad to finally track down this one down served via the engine!"
"Drinkability - More than I'd like to admit. I'm not sure the price for a six pack of these since I am out in California, but I could easily see me using this as a session beer...a very potent 7% session beer. A very enjoyable, balanced beer that I will be sure to pick up next time I am visiting the Midwest."
"d- this is living up to the hype, very tasty, and nicely hopped, and awesomely bitter, i could drink this all night for sure, and will definately be buying this in the future, a homerun for bells!"
"this has got to be one of my favorite normal (ie not imperial or doulble or any of that extra stuff) beers, can't get enough of it."
"So happy to have this available again. Bells never disappoints!"
"Overall this solidifies the fact that there is no bad way to have this beer. The cask lets the hops shine a bit more but any way you can get it this is worth a shot."
"First thing that hits the tongue is just all the hops, which soon leave a very sweet and sour flavor in the aftertaste. Pineapples, all kinds of citrus and a bit of the grapefruit attack the taste buds but lay off quickly, while still leaving a hop edge. The mouth feel is a little watery but over all very carbonated and creamy. Overall a very choice and exact IPA with very little to complain about."
"D: A very well balanced IPA, I can easily see myself having way too many of these in a sitting"
"D: The perfect IPA. This one gives Sculpin a run for its money. I could and will have this again and again. One of my stand-by brews when I want something lighter and more refreshing."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy medium gold color with minimal head. The smell is what I expected from an east coast IPA...sweet grapefruity scent with a faint hop presence. A very nicely balanced IPA, but as stated above, more on the sweet malty side then a hoppier IPA. Seeing a minimal head on the beer when pored, I thought it may be under carbonated, but it was actually near perfect. A very nice job to Bell's for making this well balanced IPA that is very drinkable indeed."
"Despite the heavy-handed hop impression, Two Hearted comes across mostly balanced, though perhaps with the scales leaning slightly toward the bitter end of the spectrum. Overall very pleasant and a well-crafted and drinkable IPA, and while the alcohol content doesn't soar, it's high enough to make itself known. Two of these would provide enough mind-numbingness and palatial devastation to hinder further quaffing."
"D - Very enjoyable and incredibly easy to drink! This is a classic Eastern IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass. Has a pretty standard golden IPA color with a extremely slight cloudiness. Has excellent head retention that leaves some impressive lacing on the sides of the glass. Definitely gives off an awesome citrus hop aroma. The taste follows up with that same citrus hop punch. Nice hop flavor that is balanced very well. Has a slightly oily mouthfeel, but this doesn't take anything away from the beer. This is one of the easiest drinking IPAs that I have ever had. Great flavor to go with the drinkability. Definitely one of the top three IPAs I have ever had."
"Obviously, this beer is a masterpiece, but is an absolute joy to try on cask. Yumm...."
"I found this beer awhile ago at a World Market as a single and have been buying this, and others on a regular basis."
"4.5 D: Because it's relatively well-balanced, this is a very drinkable beer. Well done."
"Overall Impression - This is one of the best IPAs that I've had the pleasure of drinking. It is nicely balanced torward the hops, but does not leave behind the malt backbone like many other IPAs do. This beer needs to be on your buy list."
"Kind of hard to find this on tap in Minnesota but worth the effort."
"O- Wonderful IPA. Well balanced. Will have again."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- This may be the best IPA in the Midwest. The flavor is super balanced, really smooth and just an overall great beer. Hats off to my Michigan neighbors."
"Brew has good sticky lacing as it goes down and overall is a very good beer! Recommend trying this beer and it goes down easy, has great flavor and the alcohol does not take away from the great taste."
"Cask at Churchkey. Gorgeous cloudy straw colored with a large white head that settles quickly. Aroma of freshly mown grass and cut hay. Directly bitter but not over the top, well balanced with malt and light pepper. Better on cask than tap or bottle by a long way."
"Great name and label deserves mentioning."
"What's most above average about this beer is its taste and smell. I've had stronger, but not anything that is as full and well-rounded as this IPA. This is my standard beer right now and the only beer I've ever bought more than a six-pack of. As soon as I tasted it, I just locked right on to it and realized this was something special. You owe it to yourself to verify this! Note: You must have a fresh batch. This stuff does go slightly south even after a month."
"overall a top notch brew that im glad to have around all year...i should revisit these more often.."
"A bright, golden IPA with a rather large head of white foam. A good amount of head lasting throughout and eventually developing into a smattering of lace. An inviting aroma of fresh hops, particularly a bitter orange peel and grapefruit flavor. Those aromas carry through on the flavor with the addition of a nice malt body to counterbalance. There's a sugar cookie sweetness derived from the malt that's very pleasant and does wonders to soften the hops. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a highly refreshing finish that's dry but not abrasively. A great IPA for hopheads and novices alike. There's an unmistakable fresh hoppy quality that makes this a nearly flawless representation of an American IPA and yet I found it had a great malt balance, more so than many others of equal repute. A must try, for sure."
"Really enjoyed this one, can't beleive I have passed by it so many times in my local beer isle."
"M & D - Smooth and creamy. Medium bodied. Bells has again proven to me why they deserve to be rated in my top 5 breweries. I will recommend this to all my friends that haven't had the chance to enjoy this beer yet."
"I prefer hoppier IPA but it is a nice one, probably not for the price though."
"Appearance is a cloudy, golden dreamboat. White head with good lacing. Smell is sweet and citrusy, full of hops. Taste followed the smell and I could have sworn I tasted Fruity Pebbles in there somewhere. Mouthfeel and body are full, definitely not lacking a backbone here. Very drinkable, a great beer for a day of grilling outside."
"This beer defines ""crisp and refreshing."" It has an overwhelming hop presence, and yet is perfectly balanced. This is as good as IPAs get; despite the bitterness, I could session this beer all month. Wonderful."
"This might be the most perfect American IPA!"
"This is not one of the hit you between the eyes hoppy IPA but one that really is a standard to compare other domestic IPAs."
"Incredible beverage. Very tasty, and quite delicious. Mmm grapefruit in the after taste. Amazing for the abv% considering..i wish we could get this beer in Canada. So refreshing. Where can I sign up for american citzenship? More please."
"D -- Dangerously good -- takes care of the hop craving when it sneaks up."
"D: Super drinkable IPA, so much freshness and great flavor without becoming bitter and off balanced. One of my favorite IPA's of all time! It is so refreshing and easy going and I am not a hophead either."
"D - Very nice IPA. Not over the top, but complex enough to satisfy any Hop Head. This is a very well put together beer, I wish it was available in CA."
"I'm actually kind of disappointed with this beer. I was expecting more out of it. I believe I'd rather have a Torpedo or a Racer 5."
"Fantastic example of the style and one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Nice big three finger head, just enough to build a modest, yet picturesque crown atop the pint glass. Nice alabaster foam to a golden orange body. Nose is very aromatic and inviting offering vanilla cake batter and fresh pineapple. The lace is thin in some spots and chunky in others, overall it is prominent and appreciated as it clings in irregular sheets to every surface it contacts. The taste is all ripe pineapple on top of vanilla ice cream, freshly ground tangerine peel and bitter, pithy, pink grapefruit. Hop presence is big, only slightly bitter and very mellow in general while still at the forefront of the beer. Citrus is well balanced with the pine and spruce notes leaving many flavor combinations up to individual interpretation. The mouthfeel is spectacular. Medium-heavy, rolls nicely on the tongue with small bubbles, a crisp carbonation and it manages to be lively on the palate while being smooth as silk concurrently. The most sessionable IPA I can remember drinking, so hoppy, smooth and flavorful-I really wish it was available in Texas."
"D - Just great. As my hop tolerance has really grown over the last year, so has my considerations for drinkability of IPAs. There's enough dryness to keep you coming back. Also, price wise, this is the best IPA I've had for the money, though it's in a pretty small range of my other favorite IPAs. Regardless, it's in my top three IPAs."
"Pours a light amber body with a big, fluffy white head. Aroma is dominated by citrus and slightly piney hops scents. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Great hop presence that is on the higher side of medium intensity. Just the right amount for an American Pale. Hop flavors come through from start to finish, but the malt backbone is present. Overall great drinkability."
"Poured from a brown 12oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of hops, some citrus. Taste is hoppy, piney, some malts and bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine IPA, but nothing to separate it from the masses."
"Drinkability- I could easily drink a six pack in an evening. Amazing stuff."
"Draft at RFD, 16 ounces served in 16 ounce glass. Yellow, slightly couldy, minimal white head, low carbonation. Amazing aroma. Citrus / pine, not overly piney. Cascade / amarillo aroma, very inviting. The beer screams, drink me! This is the type of beer that reminds me I'm a hop head. Sweet full bodied nice bitterness. Not overwhelming, but characteristics of great hop flavor. Drinkability high, A truly well formed beer. A slight aftertaste, some bitterness on the back end hold son. not strong. A reasonable amount of lingering flavor. This is one of my favorite IPAs in the country."
"The brew feels good in my mouth. However, the drinkability is just short of good. I love this beer; however, I don't think I can drink more than one a night."
"Pour is a nice copper/orange, as usual, with a bit of head...half-finger or so. Nose is mostly pine, but with a definite citrus in there as well. Pine is the first thing you get upon tasting, strong enough to separate the men from the boys. Gradually the citrus aftertaste hits, so that what at first seems hoppy & biting loses some of its edge, in a good way. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, tart but smooth. Improves even as it warms, mellows out a bit. I like this in pairs, though I wouldn't readily choose this as a session beer. Still, for the ABV, pretty drinkable."
"MF&D - the beer perfectly drinkable, compeltely and utterly. in fact the beer is soo good that even claire, who doesnt like hops, really likes this brew. I dont know what a perfect Am. IPA should taste like, so I will curb the rating a bit."
"D - This was an incredibly well crafted IPA that I would like to do a blind tasting with Masala Mama, which I had thought as the greatest IPA until I tasted this beer"
"The lively carbonation and the hint of malt richness make for a very nice mouthfeel and an easy to drink, very inviting beer. I just don't taste the 7.1% abv in here at all. This is potentially a very deceptive beer. It would be easy to drink pint after pint of this."
"D- I could easily recommend this beer to the experienced hop lover as well as someone with less experience with the IPA style. I fish mostly for trout, so the label is a plus :)"
"Also, is there any cooler bottle in all of beerdom? I think not."
"big citrus and pine hop flavors balanced by a sweet slightly grainy malt backbone.medium light bodied.good drinkability,you can have a couple of these without frying your tastebuds. it's hard to beat this beer on tap."
"One of my go-to IPAs and definitely worth the praise it has received. Randomly chosen out of the fridge for my first review after years of drinking craft beers. Simply put, one of the best American IPAs made."
"Two Hearted is a damn fine IPA and I love casked beers so this is a match made in heaven for me. I could easily empty the firkin all by myself seeing how I killed this Imperial pint in about ten minutes. I better take it easy or I'll be sleeping on the couch tonight. Yeeeesh!"
"Fresh 12oz bottle. Drinking this while reading Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River"" for the first time. Very nice hazy golden body with a big, fluffy white head that laces incredibly. Smells hugely of citrus. Grapefruit galore and pine, with a tiny bit of pot thrown in for good measure. Slightly sweet, biscuity malt, which detracts from it a bit. Initial malty-sweet taste, though with a general citric hoppiness. Grapefruit and orange juice with some pine resin. Bitter, but not overly so. This seemed too malty up-front, but the dry finish keeps it pleasant and refreshing, in the end. Medium-full body with plenty of carbonation. A nice ale, but not the magnificent creation it's cracked up to be. Ironically, the Hemingway story wasn't great either; guess I'm a bit picky as a Hem fan though. Granted, both could be better if enjoyed during a summer on the UP."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light. A great easy drinking ale with a great flavor profile."
"A: Finger thickness of thick frothy head, patches of sticky foam along the sides of the glass, pale golden color with a slight orange hue - 4.50, S: Utterly delightful hoppy aroma, centennial hops rule - loads of citrusy smells with some nice floral aromas as well, balanced with some sweet malts - 4.50, T: Grapefruit and orange zest, a touch resiney and a hint of pine, solid hop bitterness, wonderfully balanced with pale malts, near perfect palate for an IPA - 5.00, M: A touch thinner than I might like, a little more body would be welcome though still very respectable - 4.00, D: Two Hearted was my go to beer for a couple of years and I still consider it one of if not the best examples of an American IPA, wonderful use of hops while not being overwhelmed, extremely drinkable - 4.75"
"Drinkability-I could, and have drank plenty of these. I seem to always catch myself craving this stuff on occassion."
"D) Last time I had this, it was in a 16 gallon keg. 'nuff said."
"D: I can see why people go nuts over this beer. Such a solid IPA, much more similar to the California IPAs than most other Midwest and East Coast offerings."
"D: I can only say this ""Very highly recommended."" Top-notch Bells brew. It takes me back to my WMU days and frequenting the brewery (everyday!)"
"Notes: Still a favorite standard from Bells. But, this sure is an improvement in fresh tap form? Appearance and freshness enhance its drinkability quite a big deal. Still a reference standard when I recommend an IPA that without being overtly strong is one level above a regular version of the IPA, and it is great to initiate friends into other double, imperial, triple or hybrid IPAs, and particularly enticing on tap."
"(D)- A great all-around beer that offers you just a bit more potency than your run of the mill IPA. Massive hop addition in this one, but is still rather fruity as opposed to just drying bitterness. Solid stuff!"
"It's perfectly balanced with a soft caramel malt and hoppy fruity explosions, goes down like butter with a dry finish, has a lovely fine carbonation, and I drank three before I knew it--and that doesn't happen often with IPAs. Usually one or two is enough."
"D - Very high for the style."
"This has to be one of the best single IPAs on the planet. Holy and consistant."
"Overall- this beer is one of my favorite ipa's from michigan. well this one and dark horse's crooked tree. dark horse has a nice lil malt mixture tho. i put light to medium bodied for the mouthfeel and right carbonation cuz i've noticed a nice difference between tap and bottle. the bottle i feel is alil more carbonated than i would like it to have. pretty much if you can get this on tap and you're a fan of ipa's this is a must try!!"
"D - Easy to drink, not TOO strong and certainly quenches the thirst, but the flavor leaves something to be desired, imo."
"After reading the reviews for this beer I went out and bought a six pack. This beer has a nice floral smell and taste with a golden color. It was exceptionally smooth especially when poured in a glass. If you like a lighter body Ipa but still crave a nice pine/citrus finish this is a good beer to try."
"looks like this one held up okay."
"A golden orange-ish yellow pale (duh) pour with a finger and a half of white head that went down with a lot of lacing to a thin layer on top. The smell was absolutely delicious. The best smelling beer I think I've come across. Pine and sweetness, some grapefruit, a bushel of hops. Taste was overpowering at first, but after a few sips I've come to quite enjoy it. Same tastes as the smell would suggest, with a fair amount of bitterness. Finishes dry, with a delicious taste on my tongue. Silky light-medium body that allows the beer to be drank very easily. Extremely drinkable, especially for over 7% abv."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a white, foamy, two finger head with a nice sticky lace. Smell is grapefruit and floral hops. Taste is much like the aroma, but some sweet malt comes through, and also some orange flavor. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and very good drinkability. This is equally good in the bottle or on tap."
"A wonderful IPA. Very representative of the American style. Hoppy but not overly bitter with a nice floral aroma. It opens up with warmth and pairs well with spicy dishes. I highly recommend picking this beer up if you can. The hops will keep it fresh for a long time but this beer sure goes down well on a hot day."
"D: I bought a pitcher."
"First taste impression was of alcohol with a barley-wine style caramel sweetness, layered and smooth with nice balance and low acidity. Very, very smooth texture and tasty. Dry aftertaste with slight astringency in the finish suggestive of brazil nut. If the alcohol had not been so much in evidence, I'd have scored it higher on drinkability. Overall, a very nice IPA that drinks more like a DIPA or a barley wine IMHO; I'd like to try this a bit fresher next time around. Certainly worth the accolades it has garnered on this site."
"The body was typical for the style, not light or full. Drinkability was a little better than average since this is not a tastebud burner of an IPA. As with the other 2 Bells brews I received, if this were locally available to me I would drink it in my regular rotation."
"mouthfeel is good. medium-bodied, and carbonated well. drinkability is through the roof, of course, especially at this time in the summer."
"the abv is nicely hidden. goes down easy and i'd like to get more of it when possible."
"Overall: This is almost perfect for an IPA. It starts with light hops and great malt backbone, finishes with a great bitter hop bite, a touch of pine and citrus as well as alcohol, some sweet candy malts and vanilla taste round it off well. Reminds me a lot of Burton Baton with a touch less malt, oak, alcohol, and bitter hops making it more drinkable but less oak and vanilla to round it off."
"D - I could drink many, but the ABV prevents it. Sips nicely and I think I drank this way too fast. Crips and refreshing."
"Were it available in my area, I'd love to kick back a couple of these in the sun. Worthy of its strong reputation."
"D - One of my favorite IPAs that I could drink over and over again. Not too overpowering but still has as much flavor as my heart desires. Bravo Bell's Brewing!"
"Drinkability: This is definitely a top notch IPA. It is very nice to drink and one of my favorites. It shows an excellent balance between hops with malt backbone keeping things smooth and easily sippable. This is clearly a beer to seek out again and again and again...."
"M and D: Crisp carbonation and a smooth, medium body make this such a drinkable IPA, especially for this Ohio humidity that I am having to get used to. I can drink this stuff all day, and I just might go do that now..."
"D - Easily drinkable, even for a something that has some bitter in it. Would love to have more of these."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a nice bite."
"Notes: This bottle was the next to last one from a case I bought when I visited the brewery back in June. While still delicious, I definitely would have rated the beer slightly higher for both smell and taste back when it was fresh. The first few I cracked were unbelievably alive with citrus, and were simply unforgettable. A great IPA."
"-Bye"
"Overall, this is a very outstanding beer and is one of my favorite IPAs thus far."
"Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. This is a classic IPA that I don't think I'll ever get tired of. Looking forward to enjoying many more of these over the years."
"Such a pleasure to drink this fine IPA which stands right at or near the top of its class."
"This is my 2nd favorite IPA, right behind Columbus Brewing Co.'s version. Basicly it's like college football Columbus, OH. is just better than Michigan!!!. My wife is opposite she says Bells then CBC. With Bells you can't go wrong. This beer is borderline Dipa, but it is much more balanced. Price is a little higher than I like but it is a nice IPA."
"Overall, one outstanding beer from Mr. Bell. This IPA is the IPA that got me into IPA's a few years back. I don't drink it as much as I should because of the selection at Ashley's, but I love a Two Hearted Ale once and a while."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a one-finger creamy white head. Swiss cheese lacing down the glass. The smell is suttle, yet strong of floral, piney, citris fruit. Taste is the same with floral, piney, citrus bitterness upfront, with just enough malty sweetness to balance it. Alcohol is very well hidden, in the chewy creamy, rich bodyChewy, creamy, rich body. Hoppiness lingers. Excellent hop balance with this one, very easy drinking. My last one i sipped just because i didn't want it to end! Please come to New Jersey, until then PA road trips."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Actually has a light but sticky mouth feel. Carbonation is just right. The hop finish and aftertaste is really good."
"Poured in to a tulip glass. Light amber color, kind of light for a typical IPA. Very thick foamy white head, also unusual for an IPA. Excellent taste and mouthfeel. Very hoppy nose. Medium bitter. excellent beer. I could drink a few of these. Doesn't seem like 7.1% alcohol. Pretty high carbonation. Best beer I've tried in a while. WORLD'S GREATEST BEER"
"Pours a nice, slightly hazy golden amber with a fairly thick off-white head. Aroma is fairly strong and quite hoppy, promising a good IPA. Flavor is strongly hoppy but only slightly bitter and has just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth and fizzy, quite lively on the tongue."
"Damn good IPA. Period."
"The beer is superdrinkable. The alcohol is barely present, the carbonation is spot on for the style and the hops aren't overpowering but they are the dominant feature. This is a very sessionable IPA that I wish was available in New England all the time."
"This is right in line with most other IPA's. Maybe a little bit less so on the drinkabilty side, because the hop flavor is so strong that it will ruin your pallet for the rest of the night. Overall a good offering, and definitely worth trying."
"Notes: This is currently my favorite beer. Looking to find some like it that have the floral aroma and balance that this beer has. So far I haven't found any. If you are a hophead, you will love this beer and be surprised by the aroma and flavor. Enjoy!!"
"I will say that this beer can be inconsisten. For every perfect fresh bottle I have had, there has been another that lost a lot of flavor, or a cask conditioned pint that was past it's prime. I find bottles from a high turnover retailer to be most relaible."
"I wish this stuff was distributed up here."
"Overall, a great beer, not too expensive, seems like it could become a regular for me."
"Poured a nice golden color with good carbpnation and a small white head. Nose is floral and grapefruit. Taste is nice with hop bitterness in the beginning and middle and cleans up at the end. Very smooth and the ABV is well hidden here. Well balanced and very, very drinkable."
"It felt very, very good after a dinner in the garden, but the bitterness seemed slightly too sharp for my taste."
"It tastes wonderful. It is sweet and citrus but has a great bitter taste at the end. The thing that makes it great is that the bitter note is the best IPA end I've had and allows you to drink a ton of them."
"Well here it goes. Poured into my pint glass the beer is a nice shade of gold/orange. The head is enormus. Bits of sticky lace remain after it settles down. The cap stays put on top of my glass holding in all the flavor. The smell is awesome. So piney. It has a strong grapefruit/ citrus smell as well. There's also a lovely floral boquet that wafts up to my nose. The first sip is a punch inthe mouth. It tastes like the most floral christmas tree I've ever smelled. In a good way. So tart and bitter it makes me pucker. I love it. The feel seems very sticky and dry. It just sort of sets up shop in my mouth and stays there. I am really starting to appreciate hops. This beer does nothing but feed the fire that has been started. Bring on the big boys."
"Great beer I would love to have more often, unfortunately I had to go to florida to get it."
"D- Very easy to drink these and with a 7.10% ABV, one could find his or herself in trouble."
"D: All day along if it were available near me. Great beer to session for all the hop lovers out there, and for that comes recommended."
"This is fairly drinkable, but the dryness does seem to be getting to me."
"D - I could definitely drink a few of these. A pretty good session beer. A bit lighter than I'm used to for the style, but a solid offering overall."
"I still prefer my alpha king, but it's a damn close fight."
"Poured cloudy amber with a two finger head that stayed throughout. Aroma was orange and very nice. The taste was grapefruit without the hoppy bitterness, milder hop taste Stone's Ruination IPA. this one a definate winner, but AleSmith IPA still the gold standard in my unworthy opinion."
"D- This beer you can not just have one of. Everytime I go out and see it on tap I smile and order one. Then it usually turns into a couple more. Great IPA and great company."
"I agree with VikeMan fully. I also am NO expert on IPA's, but I will tell you that I can appreciate a great one. I bought a bottle of this, and poured it into a 22 oz. glass. Slightly foggy, golden yellow in color. Very drinkable, but like any IPA, there is limit. I would definitely buy this again. I paid $5 for the bottle; well worth it!"
"Of the IPAs I have tried (which is not a lot), they pretty easily divide into those I'd have again and those I wouldn't. This one is solidly in the 'ones I would' camp."
"They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. That must be true; the occasions I get to have this beer are few and far between but each time I come back to it, I seem to love it more than the time before. Its quaffability, its quality of ingredients, the vibrant and satiating presence of so many Centennial hops - this may honestly be the best IPA in an American market that knows no shortage of great IPA's."
"D: Yes, please. Anytime. This is definitely one of my favorite all-around beers. Reasonably priced (though still unavailable here in SC), drinkable as hell, and just damn thirst-quenching despite the strength."
"Pours a golden color with a white head. The smell is of hops with some citrus maybe orange and grapefruit. The hop smell is more earthy piney hops. The taste is of piney hops but not over powering it is balanced out with some citrus notes. The mouthfeel is good, there is a good amount of carbonation to this beer. Overall the drinkability on this beer is good. It is a little weaker in the hop taste than some other IPA's this would be a good starter ipa."
"I am not a fan of IPAs but I have been picking some up, trying to get used to them. This one is an easy drinker for people like me who dont like the seriously bitter stuff."
"Great beer, I can't say enough about it."
"One of my absolute favorite beers, there are few that top this IPA in my opinion."
"Cheers"
"i cant wait until they ship this to georgia"
"This is a highly drinkable IPA that goes great with cheddar cheese. Like a subtle Hopslam."
"This is the beer that made me love beer. The hoppy aroma draws you into this beer and adds to the slightly bitter taste. This beer is slightly less bitter than most other IPAs and is a great add on to any beer drinkers list. This beer comes strongly recomended."
"Drinking this one right now. Poured a golden color with plenty of slow-fading, thick, creamy head that left good lacing. Smells of piney hops with notes of malt. Tastes sweet, with citrusy hops and malt. Smooth, with good carbonation, but mildly bitter. Could easily drink a few more..."
"Easy recommendation."
"D: 7% ABV makes it borderline for me to quaff a few down. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this is a just about a perfect ""hoppy"" beer for me. This is one hell of a good beer."
"Nice to finally try it, but was not as good as I thought it would be."
"Compared to the nose the flavor is a slight let down - the hops are subdued with only a slight bitter finish - and then it hits you that this beer is ridiculously balanced. The hops are all there in abundance but the caramel and pale malt act as an equal foil. So drinkable, so balanced. I love my hop bombs but this smooth operator has my respect as an incredibly drinkable IPA."
"D - Thoroughly drinkable, I can drink these all day, especially in hot weather."
"This is a very good, near sessionable beer. It is very nicely balanced and straight forward in terms of taste."
"MF/D: Very nice brew here. A little too strong for a session beer, but definitely perfectly balanced. A must have"
"Drinkability- Though heavy on hops, two-hearted ale is an extremely refreshing brew, and well-rounded enough to be an excellent session beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Very drinkable. Dangerously so, in fact."
"Two Hearted has a citrus aroma, average amount of hops for an ipa, with a good amount of a spice kick to your senses. Upon sipping, I am impressed with the basic yet tasty balance of this beer, not leaning too far in any particular direction of the different tastes. Mouthfeel is very good and drinkability is good."
"From a 12oz bottle; the appearance was a hazy gold with a head that stayed the whole while I was drinking it. The gorgeous smell was probably the Two Hearted's highest high: peachy and apricot-y floral hops that are downright memorable. Tastewise, less bitter than many in the style, slightly fruity, with enough flavor on both the hop and malt ends to go around. My otherwise bitter- and IPA-hating friends enjoyed this a lot, actually, but don't take that to mean that it's not definitely an IPA - it's just that well balanced. It was a bit heavier-bodied and creamy than I'd expected I suppose but that was, again, definitely working in the beer's favor, and I can say the drinkability should at this point be a foregone positive. A really excellent IPA. If only it were more common around here I'd add it as a go-to favorite but alas it's a bit too rare."
"D: Very pleasant and easy to drink beer. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Drinkability: I'd drink this anytime"
"To be honest I was expecting a little more from this beer. Overall this beer was pretty average. A light citrus taste is the most noticeable characteristic. Lacing was nice all the down the glass. Nice head retention as well. Pours a golden cloudy color. Mouthfeel was nothing special. This beer isnt a bad beer it's just too average for me to buy again."
"On a side note, I do feel that I am beginning to appreciate what IPAs are bringing to the table."
"D - goes down w/ ease, i would reach for another and another and another....(i wish we had Bell's here in Colorado)"
"So poured in to my DFH Tulip/Pint glass. Pours an extremly yellow and gold color with a very hazy look to it. Not much clouds in there as the haze is apart of the drink. The head forms rather easily and leaves quickly. The aroma was a nice licte citrusy hop smell. Taste was strong with hop flavor, citrus, and sweet floral accent to it. One particular hops was a bit over the top for me as I felt half way threw the sip it dried up my taste buds. Reminded me of a Ruination but the little brother of it. Was overall a tasty brew drinkability is good regardless of the hops. The alcohol level is at a 7% which is nice if you plan to drink a few."
"D: Very drinkable. Alcohol is so hidden. Delicious."
"This is a near perfect IPA. Its refreshing and crisp enough to drink on a hot day outside, but full bodied and warming for chilling on the couch."
"Pours a light brown with a silky beige head. Very nice retention. Nose has fresh citrus hops, fruity malts and caramel. Taste did not have the same hop explosion. Nice bready malts, but the hops lack the freshness found in the aroma. Body is a bit thin but well carbonated. Another keeper from Bells."
"Highly recommended for someone trying to get into hops, or if you like barleywines then an aged sample of this (meaning more than 3-4 months) and you'll absolutely love it. I certainly do!"
"D - The taste is fantastic, the aroma is wonderful, the alcohol isn't noticeable. If it wasn't a $13-15 six pack I would keep a bottle in my fridge at all times!"
"D: Such a good IPA, and it's so well rounded. I could drink this all night."
"This is a really good beer that has a lot of flavor. Personally, I would prefer this in the fall than in the summer, but that's just me. In the end, this is a really good, flavorful beer."
"The nice thing about Minneapolis was I was able to try a number of Bell's beers (among others), the bad thing was I couldn't figure out how to smuggle some into my luggage for the trip home. If anyone has any great ideas about transporting beer on domestic flights, please let me know."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye=Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min=AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"Medium bodied, with a good bit of stickiness that manages to come across as refreshing rather than thick. Easy drinking; I'm sorry the beer is gone already."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just enough carbonation to carry things down. Excellent lingering hoppiness all around. Nice and enjoyable to drink. I like it."
"An interesting point of note; the burp is quite pleasant and tastes like what I'd expect the hop profile alone to taste like separate from the other beer characteristics. Floral and vegetal!"
"And, if you've not read it, give Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River"" a read...it'll only enhance your love for this beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkibility is high. This is a ridiculously refreshing beer. Perfect for a beautiful spring night like tonight, on an outdoor patio at my favorite bar in town, with my favorite person in the world. Excellent."
"D- Outstanding drinability. Probably the finest IPA I've ever had. 7% ABV, but I could easily session this. I can't set it down and it leaves you wanting more. Great beer!"
"It's really drinkable. Somewhere in this review, however, I want to fuss about the label. I'm sure it'd help to know the story of its origin, but I hate the fish and I don't really like the name. If Bud Light get drinkability credit for its marketing (and it should), then Two-Hearted gets a demerit for its. Despite the -0.5, it's a good beer to always have around, particularly right now as the summer approaches."
"Served in an Imperial Pint glass."
"This is a very smooth IPA, the carbonation is balanced perfectly making it very drinkable. I will be drinking this one all summer, and possibly fall and winter. Overall a great IPA"
"Tastes as good as it smells. Lots of pine with citrus rind. Hop oil is everywhere and graham cracker malt underneath it all. The mouthfeel, I dare say, is frolicking."
"I found this to be another great beer from Bell's. It goes down smoothly and in a lot of ways reminded me more of a pale ale amped up with lots of hop aroma. Would love to try this fresh on tap."
"Poured into tulip, lightly chilled with a nice thick head forming over clear gold color. Nose of full hops, taste is again full hop, light bitterness throughout with sweet notes, smooth finish. Not too high on ABV so fairly drinkable and won't feel bad about having a couple (or a few) in a session. Overall, one of my easy-drinking favorites...have it on tap too!"
"That's one damn fine IPA."
"Donkeyrunner went to st.louis, so he brought some of this back, much to my excitement. Pours a light honey colored, crisp, clear, delicious looking beer. moderate sized white head. aroma is mostly citrus, with hints of floral, and some fruitiness. Amazingly well balanced taste. bitter hops, with a strong, but not overbearing malty backbone. has that tasty, intense hop flavor without being overly bitter. grapefruit aftertaste, again, without being too bitter. nice light to medium mouthfeel, not too light, but not syrupy thick. refreshing , not quite heavy, carbonation. drinkability ranks very high, i enjoy this beer very much, and it saddens me that I only have one left."
"D - With the ABV in-check this is one helluva brew."
"D- This one is so easy to session. One of my favorite IPA's."
"Consumed May 23, 2009. From bottle to tulip. Pours a hazy dark golden/orange with moderate white head. Lacing lingers throughout. Classic IPA aroma of citrus/pine/grass hops and hints of caramel malt. Very well-balanced beer with good bitter finish that does not linger. Excellent beer IMO and up at the top of American IPAs for me - Cheers to Bell's!"
"What can I say that hasn't been already said? This is definitely one of the best and most unique IPA's around, period!!! Nice 1"" head with a smell of honey and citrus. Taste is where this beer excels. Various fruits and honey dance all around your mouth and beg for you to drink more! Mouthfeel is outstanding and it is really hard to put this one down. World Class for sure and one of my go to beers!!!"
"This was a little rushed...had a near dinner catastrophe in the middle of my review..."
"D: To paraphrase Prince of Space, I like it very much. Definitely a go-to beer if I need a hop fix."
"Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Very very drinkable. Nice hops that aren't overpowering make this a great IPA to sit and enjoy. I will absolutely be having more of these."
"D) This is perhaps too drinkable, is there is such a thing. Absolutely delicious beer."
"O: this is a good IPA, its reputation may be better than the beer itself but I liked it and would definitely try another."
"Sweet aroma with beautiful hop notes . Hints of grassyness and summer. Pours a brilliant golden hue with a well developed lasting head. Belgian lace with bearded structures form as I drink this ale. Sweet forward flavors with a lingering bitter, but not walloped, finish. Very clean palate. Pine forests? Clean flavors. Excellent IPA. Top of class. Excellent accompaniment to foods that need some cleansing bitter notes, yet perfect to sip on the porch after a long day at work."
"Drinkability: this IPA is excellent. very easy to drink, it doesn't take long before i'm looking for a refill."
"D. A very drinkable beer if there ever was one. One of my favorite IPA's."
"T: Piney hop quality tickles the front of the tounge, but explodes with a grassy/herbal (basil) note in the back of the throat. Nice residual sweetness remains with hints of grapefruit. Very nice IPA."
"D - Very well balanced beer - nothing out of place. This is a beer that I could stay with all night without changing up."
"This is a very nice and drinkable pale ale."
"Served on tap in a pint glass. Light orange with inch white head that dissolves only slightly. Nice citrus tones upfront. Very creamy mouthfeel with almost a biscuit-y aftertaste. Good body. I could definitely buy a 6 pack for the house of this brew. My first try from Bells and am very pleased."
"It's understandable why this is so popular where it's available. It's a flavorful, hoppy, easy drinking IPA. I have my SoCal IPAs that I'll always love, so I won't be seeking this out any time soon, but this was a nice treat none the less."
"Very drinkable with the managed bitter taste."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipping American IPA. I can't imagine having more than one or two of these in a sitting. It definitely lives up to some of its hype, but I don't think this is necessarily worth the drive to Missouri and the higher prices for 6-packs."
"Drinkability is very accessible to anyone not completely oppossed to hops. One of the best non-Imperial IPAs on the market!!!"
"The beer has a medium body to it; it is smooth, rich and very drinkable. Overall, to date this is the best American IPA I have had and I am pretty sure that it will be tough to top. Exceptional beer."
"Underwhelmed with my first sip. Can definitely taste the hops, but not overpowering. I need to remember that this is not an Imperial IPA, so for a regular IPA it is quite good. I could have a few."
"12oz bottle. Bright orange with an oily head that leaves some nice lace. Big citrus candy aroma: grapefruit, orange peel, and some slight mango for good measure. Pure hops, with a good supporting malt sweetness that doesn't provide assertive character. Very citrusy flavor with lots of orange, light grapefruit, and a soft bitterness. Good balance, with a bitter, yet soft finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Very well done, though the hops are quite one-dimensional."
"Two-Hearted is a solid IPA. If Bell's pricetag wasn't what it is here in Chicago, this would be my go-to IPA."
"Tastes of piney hops on the back of your tongue with a little tart bite on the sides. Bitter grapefruit pith and piney hops with a shade of sweet malt to balance it out. No real alcohol burn, at 7% it's covered up well. Carbonation is on the money, and it feels refreshing in the mouth. Not a chore to suck down a sixer on a Friday night."
"D: a bit pricey for me. can't buy this beer all the time. However, when I do have some extra change this will be the beer im buying. SOOO GOOD!"
"Two Hearted Ale is a good, but not great, IPA that leaves a less than pleasant after-smell and after-taste, similar to what smacks the palate after biting into an orange peel to get it started."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy honey color and the pour produced a nice white frothy head which leaves plenty of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is slightly of pine and more citrus hops. The taste is hoppy and bitter at first but goes down really nice and almost a little sweet. Really easy beer to drink and taste pretty good as well."
"Good beer without a doubt, just a very simple, one dimensional brew."
"Drinkability: Sipper. This double IPA is refreshing and great - but rich. Great with chocolate. I'm looking forward to getting this beer in Charleston. I've been driving outside of state lines to get it for way too long. I hear they sell it at Target in Pennsylvania. Great beer though."
"Have had this treat many times, finally getting around to reviewing it. Appearance wise it looks a bit thin almost macroish. Good thing this is the low point at least for me. As soon as you smell it, you know you are in for a delicous hop-flavored treat. The taste is grapefruit predominant but not overpowering by any means. This isn't a beer that wrecks your palate, and I mean that in a good way. Not every IPA style beer needs to be a total hop bomb. This has such a clean and refreshing flavor and mouthfeel, it is probably the most drinkable IPA I've had. I could spend many an hour on a summer day with a few of these, and will."
"Cheers!!!"
"D- easy drinking you can have a session with these."
"Drinkability: As far as I am concerned, this is the most drinkable IPA ever brewed. It is neither too bitter as some IPAs are, nor too light so I get bored of the flavor."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the best the style has to offer. Tastes great, mouthfeel is amazing..highly recommended"
"Cloudy and light orange in color in a pint glass. Mild motionless prickle. The head is lightly foamy and wispy with a light lacing. Raspberry and blackberry hints in the nose. Mild hops in the nose as well. Sweet and hoppy attack which is an interesting combination and I would dare say is nicely balanced. Tartness to the flavor due to the hops character. The finish is clean but with a sour aftertaste as the mouth dries. The components of this beer are very interesting and it comes across as complex and interesting. All of those factors aside I still think it is an average beer. Fun to drink and review, but not something I will keep stocked in the basement."
"I have had this many times both on tap in a bottle. It was one of my favorite beers. Nicely balanced and crisp. It is a good session beer that works with all types of food. Light citrus flavors balanced out by the hops. Great color."
"D: A great night-long IPA. I was so sorely disappointed when this left Chicago, but I'm so glad to have it back."
"D - An outstanding IPA. The alcohol was really well hidden, 7% is not crazy but I would expect it to be much more present, I'm glad it wasn't. This beer went down like a dream and I'm craving another one right now!"
"Drinkability: Top in its class, without a doubt. Perfectly put together beer. The balance of malt and hops is wonderful, and the hop flavor is very pleasant. This is a session beer year round."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is bitter with a touch of sweetness. This is a very good all around IPA. I am glad that I got a chance to drink this beer."
"***10-01-09*** After an extended period of drinking this, I'd note that the orange has really come on in the taste. I really notice that over the grapefruit flavor lately."
"Two finger lingering white head, nice lacing. Golden hue brew with nice carbonation. Floral hop nose with notable malt presence, but not too sweet. Slightly grassy and piny hop presence with a faint grapefruit aftertaste on the taste buds with a biscuit malt mouth feel, but a very nice balance between hops and malt. While I was disappointed I wasn't able to try the much ballyhooed Hop Slam, I thought this was an extremely drinkable, nicely balanced IPA, more akin to the NW style than the in yo face hopability of SoCal IPAs. I really enjoyed this, and hope the six pack stashed in my suitcase makes it back to Oregon. My first Bell's brew, and I am very impressed. Very Highly Recommended."
"D - This is high. I could have a few of these"
"Pours a hazy amber with two fingers of white foam. Settles to a half inch, leaving a couple of rings of lace. Smell: floral, apricot, orange peel, slightly lemony and woodsy. Taste: hoppy, but reasonably balanced...spicy, sweet orange citrus, pineapple aftertaste (is a flavor here), sugary pale backdrop. Medium bodied with a soft, creamy feel. It's right on par for a good IPA, nothing more or less. Bottled 6/30/2011, drank 7/28/2011."
"Pours a wonderful amber with lovely white head that mostly evaporates after awhile. Smell is the most amazing thing, with wonderful pine hitting the front end. This is a hoppy beast, and its apparent from the first sip. Pine dominates the initial tasting but the citrus comes through a few short sips in. Wonderfully nice feeling, and while fantastic tasting, a little bitter to consume frequently."
"Overall I would have to say this is one of the most well done IPA's I have ever had. It is very drinkable yet displays the hops beautifully."
" Easy to drink. A bit tangy from the hops, but that only leaves you wanting more. Great beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to a white fluffy head. It was a golden color. Pine, floral, and citrus dominated the aroma. At first the pine was apparent but after several drinks the citrus came out. I am not an IPA lover. I like RIS, porters, and stouts, so I am using this as an example of an excellent IPA. I will continue to experiment with this style until I have a better grasp on it."
"Not too hard to get to the bottom of this glass; I think another one might be following it quickly."
"Drinkablity is slightly down because of the intense hops."
"Drinkability: This is a very balanced beer and firmly has me as a Bells convert. To me this does to IPAs what their Amber did to ambers. I love this beer. The highish ABV is masked, but I could otherwise drink these as a session."
"12oz. Carefully decanted contents into a pint glass to leave sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Poured a transparent bright amber with a decent whitish head that left some lacing on the glass. Aromas are citrus - grapefruit with hints of lemon and orange. Also a nice floral hop presence with pine and slight hints of bubblegum. Mouth-feel is rather thin, but has some hop oiliness that coats the palate. Tastes are grapefruit, pine, and also has some floral notes from the hops. Hop bitterness is present, but well balanced by the fruity sweetness. This is one of the more sound American IPA's out there - a favorite of mine."
"All these beers I used to know are an illusion to me now..."
"D: If it weren't for the high abv, could easily be a session beer. Quite easy and enjoyable to drink."
"Grab yourself a pack!"
"Mouthfeel is right on with crisp sweetness and delicious flavors making you want more leaving it very drinkable minus the higher ABV."
"Wow, I have heard good things about this beer, but damn am I over whelmed by how the hype for this beer delivered. Excellent brew."
"D: Drinkability is good. I could drink a few of these, for the style of beer and the alcohol content the mix is nice and easy to drink."
"Two Hearted Ale is definitely a world class beer. Give it a shot."
"D- Will have again not sure when."
"Edit: I drank two bottles (from the same batch) and they both had the weird plastic flavor. I will not raise my score on this review, even though I have had better TH's in the past. I don't know what's up with Bell's' quality control, but I think TH deserves lower scores if they are going to sell beers with a flaw this noticeable."
"Drinkability: A good beer with a strong, balanced flavor. Definitely a nice beer to enjoy with a flavorful sandwich. This beer has enough flavor to keep me interested and is balanced enough for me to really savor it."
"This is one of my stand by IPA's. Very nice looking beer here. Pours semi-gold and amber with a very fluffy pure white head.Sticks around for a bit and then laces the glass as the brew disappears. This smells very piney and floral, with some underlying citrus (although quite faint). The hops are obviously the focus of this IPA and oils taste wonderful. Strong pine dryness coming through with a sweet malt backbone. Bit of raison underneath? Quite complex for an IPA. Very nice mouthfeel, smooth and slightly sticky. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"A Note - This will start to lose hop flavor after a month or so in the fridge, and less in the cellar. Some people might not like this, but I say it is about equally good after losing some hops than before. It allows the tasty malts to really shine, and two hearted has a delicious grain bill, so maybe take a bottle when you grab a sixer and stick it somewhere for a month or two. Try it then if you're open minded enough."
"D-One of my all-time favorite go-to beers."
"Bottle poured into pint glass. Amber in color...nothing too special. Lots of hoppy/citrus smell but really nothing else to note. Tastes like it smells, hops/floral/citrus with a clean finish. Mouthfeel is okay but really nothing to note...light carbonation and light body. I like this beer, but there are other IPAs I prefer."
"Easy drinkability, this is a light floral IPA which doesn't exactly fit the IPA mold, not intensely hoppy but tasty and refreshing, I could drink a large quantity of this. This is a good beer to give someone who has only ever had beer with LITE in the name, to break them of their foolishness."
"D - Definitely sessionable, but as always, probably not on my list of beers to acquire as there are plenty more IPA's I'd rather drink."
"The Founder's is very nice as well but it is somewhat marred by an odd aftertaste. Again, it might slightly hoppier but that doesn't mean it is as good. Despite the same hops, and the beers do taste very similar, the two beers have their differences. I think I've got to say that two hearted is better."
"Great balance, great beer. One of my favorite IPAs."
"Poured very nicely with a perfect amount of head that stayed for a nice visit and laced well in the glass. Smell was of hops and citrus fruit and wasn't as aromatic as I was expecting. Taste was somewhat citrusy, hoppy, with a brief staccato in flavor, and finished with good bitterness and very light piney flavor. Mouthfeel was good and it was well carbonated. One was enough though and I won't pick this brew up again for a while."
"D: Not really flavorful enough to want more than one. Just overwhelming hops, but otherwise flat."
"D - For an IPA, its a pretty drinkable beer. 2 might be my limit though. Its abounding flavors would try to suck me into drinking it all night tough."
"D- For me this is one of the most drinkable beers. They go down so smoothe, and quick! The alcohol is a bit high at 7% but not overwhelming after two or three. So not a session beer but if it had a lower abv it certainly would be."
"If Troegs Nugget Nectar were an APA, this would be his twin brother!"
"Smooth drinker. Fairly light body, but still has a nice creaminess. Appropriately carbonated and highly drinkable."
"D: This does pack a punch at 7%, but I could put 3-4 of these away in a session, easily. Very tasty IPA, one of my favorites. If I can't find anything else appealing, Two Hearted always saves the day."
"This is a very nice IPA, well balanced and very drinkable. Would make a good session beer if it were not for the high ABV."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. If it weren't for the relatively high ABV, this would make a great session beer. One of my favorite IPAs."
"Great taste, great balance, great beer."
"d- I could drink this all night I believe very good beer and I am looking forward to trying the Hop Slam next!"
"D - Very smooth brew."
"Fresh taste at the start with a mildly bitter finish. Quite a bit of carbonation - somewhat more than I prefer. To me, this is a toned down version of Hopslam which is definitely not a criticism. Not my favorite IPA, but another solid effort from Bell's that is worth seeking out. Perhaps the batch is a bit past its freshness, but this one lacks the bite I look for in the style."
"D- Overall an awesomeAmerican IPA with a fantastic taste and smell. Very drinkable if you like hops!"
"Poured dark amber color with medium rocky head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Crisp aroma of citrus hops and malt. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Good complex bittersweet flavor with strong bittersweet finish of long duration. Another very good Bells brew."
"Very tasty beer. Not an overpowering IPA, but lets you know its full of hops."
"D: Well I'm on my third this evening and have no reservations about finishing the other three!"
"D: I could session with Two Hearted on a hot summer day. It is overall an exceptional beer, and among my favorite IPAs. This one will certainly quench any sort of hop craving."
"When I first tried this beer years ago I remember thinking it was the most bitter and hoppy I had tried to date. Now it seems exceptionally well balanced and drinkable for an IPA. Very refreshing and sessionable and one of the best ""non-extreme"" IPAs I've had."
"(EDIT:) re-reviewd on Jan. 10, 2010"
"D: Quite high. I liked Bell's HopSlam, and I enjoy this one, as well. It's too bad we can't get Bell's on this side of the US, but the level of quality shown here makes me want to hunt it down."
"I love that this beer is available year-round at just about every store near me."
"Excellent IPA with a huge hop profile. This beer has a ton of hops, even for an IPA. It really borders on a DIPA, like Russian River's Blind Pig. It's a slightly hazy golden liquid with a stiff, foamy head. The aroma is full of citric hops. The flavor has an excellent malt backbone that lies beneath a bouquet of hop notes that tend toward the bitter citric end of the spectrum. The smell is a bit more floral than the flavor. The beer is well-balanced and the alcohol is nicely hidden. It tastes very American but still quite different than an aggressive San Diego style. I enjoyed this beer very much. (Thanks again to deliriumfest)"
"Simple off-white colored head, gets close to one finger and runs off into a thin coating across the surface, the lacing shows more tenacity and stickiness. Red to brunt orange in color, takes on a more metallic yellow or rust cast around the rims, clear enough to watch the fat bubbles swim upwards. The nose offers up sweet pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus in spades, wheat, rye and soda bread notes, brawny apricot, peach, pineapple fruit scents, warm spring day explosion of fresh flowers, digs in without bruising. Medium-bodied, lively and energetic from the first sip to last, the carbonation dances a tango across the tongue. The pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus slightly more bitter here, just as much as an overpowering presence. Pretty peach, apricot, pear fruit, swells until pine sap, rye and granola in addition to a malt smoothness brings things closer to earth and elongates the experience into more than a series of punctuation marks. With each bottle it's drained before you think it's even half done."
"It also has about the right alcohol content, so you can enjoy a few of them."
"I first drank this beer before signing up for Beer Advocate. The label, with its odd painting of a fish, forced me to purchase what I, then and now, refer to as ""Fish Beer."" I didn't know much about they style then, but I knew that I liked it. Nostalgia is not clouding my judgment. Two Hearted Ale remains a bright light in the beer world. Simply excellent."
"To me this is a Pale though :-/"
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a juicy well balanced brew. Alcohol is hard to pick out in the flavor and aroma. The bitterness level works very well with the other flavors. The malt stays out of the way (for the most part). Bells has a good thing going with the Two Hearted. This one is easily reocommended."
"D: Kinda so so here as well. I couldn't get through many of these."
"Overall: One of may favorites, Great oily and well carbonated mouthfeel. The best thing about this beer is the drinkability, I could easily drink this from sun-up to sun-down. Wonderful."
"Cloudy golden color with tons of lively carbonation, white head dissipates quickly. Aroma is a bouqet of lovely citric hops. Grapefruit comes through upfront. Some grass and pine notes as well. Taste is pleasant though short of great. There's a touch of sweetness in the palate, but the hops are not as prevalent until the finish. They lack the symphonic multi-layered hop flavors that the aroma suggested. A nice dry finish. Light on the palate. Mouthefeel has some problems though. This beer is so overcarbonated that it affects the taste and entire experience. This style tends to have a good amount of carbonation, but this beer needs to tone it down a bit."
"Wish this was available to me on a regular basis. Great flavors. I'm the target audience for this beer. More please."
"overall, its a beer which i'll always have in my ice box...cheers!"
"If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would give this ale serious consideration. It's a must try if you haven't done so already."
"Look poured a thick creamy offwhite head that slowly disapated. Color is a cloudy dark yellow with decent carbination. It has a great smell of citrisy hops. Taste starts out with a slight sweet malt base with a bit of citris hops. Then finishes with finishes with a wonderful refreshness of hops with reletivly low bitterness. Then ends with a bit of drying .Mouthfeel is decent, not overtly thick. Overall another good one from Bells."
"D: Good. 7% alcohol is hidden very well. Drinks like a 4.5 - 5% beer."
"Nothing is bad about this beer, but nothing is that great either. It's worth trying, but just one."
"Taste is a solid IPA... a slight malt with more prevelant hop. The hop is more grapefruit. There is little carbonation and a very nice mouthfeel on this beer. When I am in the mood for an IPA this is a really good one."
"this is a superb IPA ..it pours a beautiful orange color with a just right head and superior lacing to the end the smell is superb you would think you are in an orange/grapefruit field in florida.. the taste is the same grapefruit/citrus with hops, malt and the 7% abv(which you dont taste) all blended perfectly. the mouthfeel is soft citrus with a perfect hop bitterness malt sweetness.. you will drink this so fast you will want another .. bells never dissapoints one of the top craft brewers in america.. if you like IPA you must try this one"
"One of my all time favorites and the beer that I judge all other IPAs by. Powerful but well balanced. I even like the fish on the bottle!"
"D = Fairly drinkable for hop fans."
"Orange honey blonde body with plenty of suspended yeast and a huge,stiff foamy head that leaves tons of sticky lace on the glass. Big grapefruit and floral hop aroma. Tastes of big fresh hops with a touch of honey and fresh baked bread. Creamy mouthfeel with nice resinous hop oils. One of my all time faves."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy golden amber with two fingers of tan head with good retention on the glass. Smell is all grapefruit citrus hops. Taste is a perfect combination of citrus hops and biscuitlike malts. Light dry mouthfeel. Very drinkable. This is a go-to beer for me and always keep some in my fridge."
"D: I was expecting something more aggressive, although this one has outstanding balance. At once bready, sweet, and hoppy - very nice."
"Makes me proud to be from the U.P. too!"
"Well balanced. All of the hop flavor is there with just enough of the bitterness."
"D-Great. Hands down, so great, which is why I drink it so frequently. Many of the bars in my area have this on tap, which makes it one of the best go-to brews around. And I keep coming back for more."
"Also, Bell's has really balanced this IPA out, 5-6 years ago this was nearly undrinkable it was so hopped up dry."
"D- Very drinkable, but not my favorite IPA. Still, the hops aren't overwhelming and the citrus upfront balances it nicely. Could easily down a few of these"
"D - Would make a great session beer if I didn't have to trade for it. Thanks to psunate for sending it all this way!"
"D: Solid APA session beer here...I had three and loved them all."
"Two Hearted definitely beats it in one category: drinkability. It's a big-hopper, for sure, but it has a better balance and doesn't assault your taste buds like Hercules or Ruination. Citrus and pineapple are refreshingly pleasant, and the malt is right where it needs to be. To echo another review, it's so enjoyable that the glass is empty before you're ready, and you definitely want another. I need to test it against a few more, but for drinkability and price (compared to the very pricey competition), this may be my new favorite IPA."
"This Two-Hearted is a splendid quaff that proves to be quite a sessional beer. Yummy indeed."
"A rare 5, but I just don't know how this one could be any more drinkable. One of the best IPA's I've had, and to have it for the first time in an airport is quite ironic."
"D: major drinkability, easy to drink, no alcohol in the taste, and tastes good"
"A good beer to say the least, however as far as American IPAs are concerned Dogfish 90 still rules my world."
"Favorite IPA! Light golden color with a finger head on top. Smells like grapefruit. At first taste I can feel the perfect balance of this beer. Hoppy in the best way yet smooth on the way down. An easy drinking beer for anytime or any occasion."
"D- My favorite beer, a great American IPA that isn't radical. Quite easy to put down a sixer- be careful."
"Future outlook: Another beer that I can't believe I took so long to sample. Worth it's solid reputation it would seem. Will consume again."
"D: I really think if I had consistent access to this beer it would always already be in my fridge."
"Overall, a very nice ipa. The first time i had it, i thought it was one of the best things that has happened to me, beer wise. But later, getting a 6-pack of it on vacation, I seemed to have lost the initial love i had for it. I still think its a great beer, but i cannot get over the unfiltered flavor that i keep getting from it...so though i really like it, it is not one of my favorite ipas, but i can certainly see why others would say it is."
"D- This is a solid IPA that is just above sessionable but oh well i'm going to drink a few of these and love it. Great price for such a gem and has good availability in my area.This will be in my sights in the future trust me. A great American IPA that isn't over the top and expertly balanced."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange with a big yellowish/white head. The smell is mostly piney/floral hops, with a hint of acidity to it. With the smell I always expect a bitter hop bomb, but it's not. It's hoppy without being overbearing and has a nice floral finish. It's very smooth and extremely drinkable. It's our go to in the spring time at the Student Union here in Madison!"
"Beer pours out a hazy dark yellow color. Roughly three fingers of fizzy white head along with excellent lacing round out an excellent appearance. Smell consists mostly of piney and floral hops. A bit of a tart edge to it. Taste is very hoppy, but not overly bitter, a bit of a citrusy bite to finish. Overall, pretty good I'd say. I'm not normally a huge fan of IPA's or any beer that's hop dominated, but this beer's pretty smooth and easy drinking. A definite recommendation, and I would for sure drink this beer again."
"An IPA you can drink all day."
"This is a beer that I would get more regularly if it were available to me more regularly."
"M/D - It's very smooth and quite a bit of carbonation which is nice. Very easy to drink and goes down smooth."
"This is such a great everyday beer. It's my ""session"" of choice. It holds its own yet pairs well with most foods."
"Taste was fantastic - a nice bitter-sweet citrusy flavor that finishes nice and dry. The hops really come through in a bold but refined fashion. Not over the top at all. I love this beer, plain and simple."
"Pours a light golden color with a small fluffy white head consisting of the tiny bubbles produced by bottle conditioning. It smells wonderful, tangerine and citrus notes dominate. Unlike many things in life this beer tastes as good as it smells. Those tangerine, fruity notes being giving off by the hops hit you up front with a mild malt sweetness present in the middle to the end. It wasn't very bitter for an IPA but the aroma hops were very evident. This beer contains a light to medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer hides its 7.0% abv very well and is dangerously drinkable. This beer is unlike any other IPA I have personally have had before because it seems to focus on aroma hops and really backs off on the bittering. Its a great beer and worth a try."
"Classic burnt orange haze. Soft pour,so not much of a tiny white head. Smell is of fresh yellow pine and lemons. A tasty well balanced brew. Not a hop-bomb like these west coast IPA's I'm used to. A nice change of scenery. Easy drinkin'. Refreshing,and I can't tell its 7% at all! Nothings out of place. A really well done IPA from Bell's!"
"Cheers!"
"Very easy to drink for a 7% beer due to the exceptional mouthfeel. Enough hops to quench any hophead's cravings."
"A nice IPA not over the top hoppy, just a mellow fragrant solid IPA. Pour is medium golden with a large fluffy head. Aroma is citrus and pine with some sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium light carbonation that you don't feel until it hits your throat. Smooth slightly bitter finish that is much more refreshing than some othe others I've had. It's one of the best IPAs out there. Top notch hops, Top notch quality."
"have seen this brew as a preferred purchase in the forums, so when I spotted one at ABC, I snagged it up to give it a whirl. Hop smell is a delicious dry hopped woodsy, piney smell. Pours to orange-yellow with a foamy two finger head that laces as it recedes. Taste is a very different hop taste than I have ever tasted before. Initial, but not for long, taste is malty, then the hops kick in. Again almost pine like hop that builds and builds in flavor, but not really bitter. It lingers in the finish but it still lets a slight bit of malts through. Silky mouthfeel but still a slight carbonation zest. This is a very different ale. Unique. The AC is not evident at all. I like it and will definitely be purchasing more of this brew. Drinkability suffers a tad for the AC but hey, if you wanna play you gotta pay. Oops it's gone! I now see on the bottle it's a Yooper style beer, that's why it's so good! Brings me back to ""the woods""."
"Even after two years, this brew is pretty drinkable. Unfortunately, I don't think it's really any better than the younger bottles they. The flavor is definitely subtler this time around, and that can be a good thing, but I'm just not sure it suits this beer. Definitely a brew worth purchasing though."
"Dark a slightly hazy dark gold with a medium white head. Nice hoppy aromas with multiple layers, ranging from evergreen needles to the citrus spectrum, but not in an overwhelming, steroid hopped way. No alcohol detectable. Sweet malts also insert themselves into the aroma equation. A resinous, medium full body with a lot of malt/hop tug of war on the palate, finishing dry, with an orange zest that hangs on for a bit. Drinks very beautifully. Stands up to hearty, flavorful foods but also has the balance and finesse to be enjoyed on its own. Two Hearted Ale is definitely my all-time favorite IPA."
"D - This has become my go-to beer when I'm out a an event that requires drinking from the bottle. Very easy to knock out a six."
"Creamy/velvety mouthfeel that leaves me wanting more, if only they made a beer like this in Ontario!"
"Medium to high carbonation, great hop aroma and very, very drinkable. Clean, crisp and hoppy. A must try for hopheads and not too over the top for the squeamish."
"Pours a big head, white, foamy, creamy, good lacing. Cloudy amber color, good bubbles, fizz. Very strong hoppy aroma, fresh smelling. Bitter taste, some sweet mid-taste, somewhat smooth/bitter aftertaste. Creamy. A good IPA, but a little strong and unbalanced. A little acidic."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs, I just wish it was easier to get a hold of in Maryland."
"D - Sessionable drinkability. Not much else to say; I drink it all the time, its my favorite IPA."
"I'll leave the two-hearted on the shelf and go with the Columbus Pale Ale or Liberty Ale the next time..."
"Pours a cloudy copper body with a vibrant head. Nose is very floral, sweet, and clean hop aroma: perfume to me. A nice hop bitterness that is reasonably balanced. As to drinkability?: I have trouble keeping it in my fridge (where is this 7% hiding? oh yeah, in my subsequent morning). This is easily my favorite beer that is regularly available in Chapel Hill."
"Overall: This is the beer that introduced me to craft beer and delicious IPAs, it will always have a special place in my heart and when I'm at work (where we have it on tap) it's my go to beer. That being said, since I first had this I've had many amazing IPAs and Two Hearted doesn't hold the number one spot anymore. Still a great beer and I recommend trying it."
"Overall, I enjoyed this, no doubt. But, given the hype and ratings, I'm left a bit disappointed. It's really good, but not great. Will have one if offered, and I'd like to have it again, but I'm happy to stick with more easily attainable IPAs."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. One inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops mainly with a subtle hint of some spice. Fits the style, quite nicely. There's a crisp and not so smooth mouth feel. There's a high carbonation level and noticeable bitterness. Tastes of strong hops mostly (a good kick of bitter - yum). That is the only real flavor I can pick out. Overall, what a heck of a strong IPA."
"drinkability: a good choice everytime! One of the best strong IPAs out there."
"D: A very good and easily drinkable IPA. Hop lovers will love it, especially fans of centennial hops."
"D: Didn't realize it was 7%. Masks it well. Heck for that matter a good winter beer, too."
"Would buy this again several times, maybe my favorite IPA."
"D - Nicely balanced IPA, perfect for a session."
"Still a good beer though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Somewhat creamy and very refreshing; the sensation of drinking bottled water out of the fridge on a hot day. Active carbonation keeps things perky. However, the strongly hoppy aftertaste slightly throws off delicate balance of flavors and lowers the drinkability."
"Pours a hazy straw color, the head is tremendous though, rocky and thick. Aroma is sweet malt, and HEAVY on the cascade hops. Flavor is sweetly hoppy... the malt has a nice sweetness to it that works well with the citrus hops, as well as just the plain ol' bitter hops. Woodsy and piny hops on the back end. Enjoyable beer."
"O: Overall had this several years ago before i started an appreciation, vocabulary and taste to define such remarkable greatness. Crisp, beautiful hopping that is not overpowering and begs for more easily breaking the outstanding barrier. Smooth, easily sessionable with a lingering hoppiness that goes on long after the beer is finished. Easy consumption."
"Unfortunately this one has not arrived in Chicago yet but having consumed tons of this stuff over the past few years I can recommend this to basically anyone who isn't totally turned off by hops. One of the best IPAs made period."
"As I've enjoyed more of the case, I really think I need to adjust my scores for appearance and taste. Every bottle has had a luxurious head with excellent lacing. The taste is sublime - delightfully hoppy without being so overbearing that I can't enjoy two or three."
"D - Very high. Toes the line between Pale Ale and IPA. A very quaffable IPA. You hear people talk about a sessionable IPA, this is it."
"T. Tons of grain and malt tastes. Fairly dry hopped. Light caramel accents, and really sticky on the tongue. Some woody tastes are present as well. Its a little rough but its definitely what I was in the mood for."
" Get some!!!"
" 7.00% ABV? Can this be? I'm not even feeling any alcohol as I drink this. It's there, but you'll have to look and sip hard to find it. This is perfect for the state in which it was brewed, since the summers there are a bit less harsh than those in most of the rest of the United States. I'm not sure where the two hearted reference ties in but it if it has anythign to do with the malt and hops, than this beer is more than worthy of it's moniker. Arguably the best IPA I've ever had!"
"Notes: one of my favorite IPAs. definitely a default and a standard for measurement"
"Nice flavor and smooth resin flavors. Nice beer, ever judged by a Pacific North Westerner. Very drinkable and up there with many of the other top notch IPAs from round these parts."
"A six pack of this beer was bought for me by a buddy during their stay in Michigan (big thanks Randy). Poured in to my new Cisco Brewery tulip glass a radiant gold, with about two fingers worth of white heading. Lots of small sediment can be seen floating around this beer if you look closely enough. Aroma is very floral, with hints of honeysuckle, a bit of garlic, and some citrus fruit thrown in the the mix. The floral part of it comes full swing in the flavor, with lots of lemon grass, earthy hops, bright citrus and oily resins. Body is about medium for an American IPA, just about right. The 7.00% ABV does not make itself known at all in the flavor. I am glad I finally got to try this one from Bells. It has a really spot on hop profile that you do not see in many IPAs on the East Coast. If I see this one at Extreme Beer Fest, I will be rushing over to grab some straight away. Cheers"
"Pours a yellow-orange into my Sierra Nevada hop tulip, with tons of carbonation action and a finger-wide off-white head that has great retention throughout the tasting and leaves sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma is strongly of piney hops, resembles the white pine Christmas tree I have yet to take down, with some breadiness and even a little bit of smoke. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a little slippery and syrupy with well-balanced medium carbonation. Taste is like the nose, with piney hops, a lot of bready maltiness, nuts, and wood, finishes dry with good hop bitterness. Overall I this is a great brew and exactly what I expected for the style. Good balance in the taste, with hops that are not overly bitter. Drinkability is very good due to the good balance, and improves as it warms a bit and the flavors develop. Overall this is a great brew, very smooth, and I could definitely see myself picking up a sixer if the mood struck."
"Hops and hop oils are the first thing that hit the nose. Nice herbal and earthy notes with slight hint of citrus/pineapple. Taste is not as hoppy as the smell, but very nice with tones of slight sweetness/malts. Finish is nice. Bubbles attack, but not in a harsh way. Very drinkable. I wish I had another."
"Could drink several in a sitting."
"In summary, this would be a solid session beer, but not a beer I would consider memorable in any way. I am sure I am biased, but I believe the CA IPA's (Racer, Green Flash and certainly Pliny) compare very favorably to the Two Hearted."
"At the end of the day, I have to call this one an also-ran. Nothing here really distinguishes it from some of the other offerings out there. Not to rag on this beer - as I would love to have it in my regular rotation. Iowa is a beer wasteland as it relates to Bell's high point beer. I find it very similar to a DFH 60 minute, something I can get - good news I guess."
"Last time I had this was in bottles, but I have to say the fresh keg makes this thing expontially better on tap."
"the aroma is piney and citrusy. there is hints of grapefruit. there is a nice head on the pour with some good lacing all the way down the glass. The mouthfeel is smooth. you can taste some citrus and hops in the taste, and it has some bitterness in the end. i could drink this beer all night."
"D: As I mentioned, I'm not a hop head so its hard to declare this one very drinkable,.. but I think I could probably have another one and not get too tired of it."
"D - For 7% this is ridiculously drinkable. Overall this beer doesn't blow me away like I was hoping it would because it is highly regarded here on BA but it is still a good IPA. I think its strength is its drinkability. If there is such a think as a 7% abv session beer, this is it."
"Drinkability is very good, in fact, I orderd another just to make sure."
"This stuff is a pleasure to drink - maybe not quite a session effort but very close."
"D: I notice this was on tap last night, and thought why not try it after reading favorable mentions here. I trulyu enjoyed it, and am anxious to pick up some for home consumption."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of Michigan native Shaun Hughey. Contrary to what the prior posters decreed, this is super sexy label art. As a matter of fact, everything about this beer is set up to turn a man on. If only it were available out here in ''Ahregone''!"
"Excellent brew, nice hop punch, but nothing overwhelming. Quite refreshing and worth another visit."
"Overall Impressions: This is my first foray into Bell's beers. I have to say -- particularly after hearing raves for so long -- I am not impressed. I hope to pick up a few more from this brewery on this trip, but as a hophead, this was hugely disappointing."
"D: I have yet to have a Bells that I didn't like. I do like an IPA that isn't scared to have hops completely dominate malt. Balance is not required for my enjoyment. I found this brew to be extremely enjoyable and although it is not the top of my list, it is certainly up there with my favorite IPA's."
"I can pound a good IP all day long - and this one is plenty delicious."
"This beer has a moderate body with some nice carbonation. Feels quite creamy on the tongue but has an overall dry finish. A very refreshing beer, that leaves a nice little grapefruit note on the palate. Not a ""hop-bomb"" by any means, but just a great balance of flavors that taste great and is quite sessionable."
"Overall - A respectable IPA but not overwhelmingly hoppy. The beer draws you in and makes you want more which is the sign of a great brew."
"Pours a hazy cloudy orange with a creamy offwhite head that laces well. Aroma is beautiful very floral and hoppy ,some notes of grass and pine. The flavor is much of the same with some malt background, citrus, hops and a hint of spice. This is amazingly smooth and drinkable for an IPA. It finishes quite crisp and delicious on the palate. It manages to not get you with that harsh bitterness. This is a great beer Ultra Drinkable"
"Two Hearted is light-medium bodied. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with good carbonation. I want to drink 5 more of these, but that's all I have left now so I'll have to savor them."
"A solid IPA style, a good drinker."
"Again I don't think I got the freshest bottle so I will sample another bottle in the future and review it again. I know that JohnTravolta21 sent me the bottle straight off of the shelf but perhaps the retail store had it sitting around for a while or perhaps Bells skimped a bit on this batch due to a hop shortage...."
"Pours a golden orange color, with a strong hop smell and undertones of sweet malt. The flavor starts out with a strong hop bite and finishes with a sweet malt balance that doesn't take away from the hop flavor. I liked it but would rather have a west coast IPA."
"Pours an opaque golden colour with a nice 2 fingers of head. The nose has lots of fruity and citrus hops to it and not a lot of malt. There is a lot of balance in the flavor of this beer. It has lots of citrus hops with a big bready and carmelly malt flavor, there is even a bit of lemon that I detect. It is medium bodied and is fairly drinkable."
"D: My AIPA of choice in Minneapolis bars. I would consider this the beer that got me into craft beer. I remember having kegs of this stuff for a few summer parties that we threw. I can remember people drunkingly criticizing the beer, but I did not pay them much attention."
"i am 99 percent sure that i just got an old bottle of this. i would love to try a fresh one as im sure it would be a much better experience than the one i had. although it might just be the sore nuts talking."
"D - Very easy to drink. Alcohol is masked well. I could sit down with this beer for a nice long session."
"I was still finding new tastes when I finished the glass and the alcohol is well-hidden, will happily continue drinking this when I can get it. Above average."
"D: Overall, this is a likable, drinkable beer. Not the most stunning of IPAs, but tasty nonetheless."
"Some may say this beer is one dimensional and lacks complexity, but like fine single malts the nice focus & concentration of this beer on the Centennial hops is a pure delight."
"Reviewed on 5/10/08. Bottle. Pours a light orange/amber with a thick white head. Aroma of floral, citrus hops (orange, grapefruit, lemon), and a slight hint of pine. Awesome, awesome aroma...it just beckons to you! Flavor of hops upfront, followed by sweet malt with some wheat notes at the finish. Also got some lemon zest. Perfectly balanced- the hops do not overdominate as they do in other IPAs. Mellow, super-drinkable, well-crafted. No bitter finish. Simply superb. 10/4/9/4/16 (4.3/5)"
"D- Six.. easily. No problem at all. My favorite session beer."
"if this beer was as ubiquitous as SNPA, Id order this when Im at bars that dont have much better. But its not, and if Im stuck in a bar like this, Ill continue ordering my SNPAs. glad I tried this beer, but Im not too upset that I dont know when Ill have my next one."
"D - Bell's - please bring these back to Illinois! This is much more sessionable than Hopsolution. Second only to Masala Mama in this regard. You can't taste the 7% at all, and it's super refreshing to drink."
"It's an excellent example of the IPA...This is a ""go to"" beer in my fridge. I love it!!!"
"With a nice inch head and tan/golden coloured beer, Bell's Two Hearted looks like a stunning IPA. The head has great retention and lacing. IPAs should have a nice big hoppy nose in my opinion, and this one doesn't go away from it, but what is different about this beer is the type of hops that come out; it's a fruity mixture with the malts, which I like quite a bit. The taste of two hearted isn't exactly what one would expect from an IPA, but that doesn't mean it's not great. The bitterness comes through at the end but the flavour is kind of like the nose, meaning that the hops and the malts play off of each other in a way that neither of them are in control of the beer; however, it's still quite obvious the beer is an IPA though. It also has a nice sweetness that comes through, which is kind of unexpected, but ace nonetheless! The mouthfeel is what an IPA should be! Very fucking drinkable!"
"One of the best examples of a well balanced IPA. Pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy white head. Beautiful aroma of floral and citrus hops with a solid malt backbone. One of the smoothes easieest drinking IPAs I've ever had. A nice balance of maltiness and citrus and floral hops. Awesome!"
"D - With a 7 abv...you can't tell...and the perfect blends make this a nice IPA!"
"D - Pretty good IPA. A little more balance and it would do it some good but overall enjoyable."
"served in a bottle and poured into sam adams glass. appearance was ligter than i expected and had virtually no head. smells of the usual grapefruit citrus and hops... i have a slight cold so thats all i can pick up right now. mouthfeel is light yet the taste remains strong as you would expect from an ipa. nice citrus finish on the back of this one. very easy to drink and enjoyable."
"very tasty but the hop dryness comes out more with every sip."
"D: It finishes nice, but is a fairly heavy beer. I think it'd be hard to put back more than two of these. In small doses, it's very nice."
"Drinkability: An outstanding brew -- I became a fan when I had it on tap and I will always feel good about buying this when I come across it. It doesn't feel too heavy at all, so I could easily use this as a session beer."
"When I first poured this beer it I took a shot of the beer right a way and it hit me like a bitter bullet. I then finished pouring the rest of it into my glass. It was a little lighter than a lot of IPA's. It had a dark bras colored body not as bronze as I would have thought. There was a lot of tan head and lace. This is a very frothy beer. It has a great floral and citrus hop aroma. It smells almost like a roadside fruit stand when the fruit is fresh. The taste is bitter but not as wild as the beer sits. The flavor is a lot like the smell. I'll be honest I am not always an IPA guy but this is one I enjoyed. It has a very creamy mouthfeel."
"D - hell yeah!"
"This beer pours a golden yellow. It has a thick fluffy looking white head that fades very slowly. It leaves very thick laces. It smells quite hoppy. I also picked on a slight citrus aroma. The hops are very present. I taste almost no malty characters at all. Just a lot of hops. This beer is carbonated quite nicely. I think that this make for a good beer on a hot day. This is definitely a beer to sit for a session."
"Taste: Taste is like the smell with loads of grapefruit and citrus."
"I've had it on draft many times, which is far superior than the bottled version."
"Drinkability is quite high - hence I had another."
"Really nice beer, I could just sit and sniff it for hours."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a very hazy orange color. Very, extremely thick, frothy head that remained throughout. Lacing was very prominent. Aroma was mostly from the hops with many citrus/floral characteristics. Medium bodied with the taste that you would expect from this style. Hoppy and crisp with a bitter finish. This beer is very drinkable with the ABV hardly noticed. Overall a great product from a great brewery."
"The drinkability of this beer is quite high and certainly could be used as a nice session beer even though it comes in with an ABV of 7.0%. There is not an offensive or overly alcohol strong nature to the taste of the beer and the smoothness that holds together the offering adds to the drinkability of the beer. With the pleasant taste and pairing of the sweetness aspects to the hoppy aspects, the beer could be deceiving, though, as it does pack a nice little punch."
"Great beer. One of my favorite, if you like hoppy beer try it."
"this is an interesting yet not the most challenging of beers. I like this one because it is solid in every way and doesn't fail to ""keep it simple stupid"""
"The kind of beer that could get warm and flat and you will still happily drink it."
"this beer is a treat to drink, i had this by itself, but it would go great with a spicy seafood meal"
"D- Highly drinkable. A very well balanced IPA."
"So incredily drinkable."
"A big Thanks to my uncle Mark for this one!"
"Treat yourself to a one of a kind. AMAZING!!!"
"This is a really good beer, though maybe not quite as good as some of the hype led me to believe."
"this is pale for an american. has a straw like yellow with a murky amber in the light. very lighty dusted in cloudiness. medium head, but i seen this come out a tap into a pitcher and the head is very califlower like. looser than the la choufe triple IPA though. either way. extremely lacy blend. cotton candle form and color. smell is out of this world as first. fruity, hoppy, and everything in between. some orange, lemon, grapefruit, and mango tones. all very subtle. all very balanced. fruity hop characters... lemon zest, young orange peel bitter quality. crisp dry hopped character. malt gives it density. volume is good. went up to michigan for a wedding in october and drank this the whole time. sums of the mood for sure. a most have IPA... for british and american hop lovers alike."
"The drink ability of this beer is outstanding! It can be enjoyed with food or by its self; even after mowing the yard this beer is great!"
"Pours a very foamy head with some lacings on top of a clear, dark gold body. A citric and floral burst in the hops along with a decent malt presence. Taste is more of the same, as even though they are a good amount of hops for a dry, citric taste, there is also some smooth and creaminess in the body thanks to a little bit of sweet malt taste. Great beer."
"This is up there with Green Flash West Coast IPA and Blind Pig as some of the best IPA's out there. I generally like my IPAs a little on the higher side in terms of ABV- this one clocks in at 7% (as does GF's). I would have this in my fridge all the time if it was available in NJ/CT, its everything you want in a go-to beer. Enough drinkability (outstanding for the style!), Great hop aroma and floral nose with a great mouthfeel and flavor that keeps you going for another sip. Cant get enough hops lately, and this one definitely will satisfy your thirst for the citrusy, pine-y taste you're searching for."
"A true classic. The mountain top for IPA's as far as I'm concerned."
"Great pour great color nice long lasting head. This one gets me from the 1st sip, hints of orange, maybe tangerine on the citrus side, Nicely bitter and very well balanced without being sweet. Definitely a top tier IPA, that is amazingly stable and consistent. On tap it's pure dynamite, and IMO the best IPA out there in a sea of average. The tap version get's a bump in smell , and taste, vs the bottle which is what I originally rated. IMO damn near perfection on tap.."
" Jim."
"Drinkability is good, and deceiving for the 7.0% abv."
"i believe this is my first bells beer another great that i cant get in illinois. the color is a beautiful cloudy orange hue and a big white head the smell is flipping amazing pineapple, bananas and a wonderful hop aroma fill the nose. taste is also great , i really wish i could get this stuff more often its just damn good. on the label it says its an india pale ale its the most tame ipa i've ever had but a great beer nonetheless"
"You get what you smell, hops and citrus, I loved it. There is nothing bad about this beer, other then it not being available where I live. Slightly bitter taste but the bitterness does not linger at all. I had no clue what I was getting into when I opened this bottle but I truly loved it."
"Not a hop-bomb but you'll get a mouthful and won't be disappoined."
"GC"
"Pours a vivid golden with a big white head and lots of carbonation. The aroma will envelop you - hugely citrusy, mostly grapefruit. The flavor follows right along, intensely grapefruity. The mouthfeel is clingy,leaving a lovely hop bitterness on the finish. Despite it's relatively strong ABV, it is a wildly drinkable beer."
"D: This is an IPA that goes down rather quickly because of its lighter body and nice flavor. Two Hearted Ale is in the top echelon of American IPAs and is a must have for any hop head."
" d) very drinkable except i dont have any more and cant get any more but if i could this would definitly be in the rotation right behind racer 5 and even with a couple of others."
"Orange beer with white head that is gone quickly. Sweet floral aroma with a hoppy freshness. I love centennials. The flavor has nice malt balance with slight toastiness, dominant finish of oranges, grapefruits, and flowers. Almost like PEZ candy. Very refreshing and drinkable. Yum."
"Overall: good stuff"
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"D - incredible! I now see why my DC friend buys this stuff all the time. Bell's: COME TO GEORGIA! Can't recommend this enough if you're a fan of American IPA's. Delicious, balanced, and completely drinkable. I have 3 left and will be savoring each. This is one of the most standout beers I've had in a while"
"Drinkability- I enjoy this beer. It's definitely not a beverage for lite beer drinkers. I think it is an exceptional beer that should definitely be consumed...great around a campfire!"
"Drinkability: Pretty high for an IPA - goes down very smoothly and the carbonation makes it really fresh and light-tasting."
"Drinkability: This a very good beer. It was one of the best I have had recently."
"Not sure if this is the best IPA out there, but that's what these reviews are for, and it's certainly a contender."
"D- The 7% is very well hidden in this brew, and although it's not sessionable, it's damn drinkable. It's odd it took me so long to review this as I have had it quite a few times. I will be enjoying again in the future."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. In fact, one of the most drinkable IPAs I have ever tasted."
"D: although I rarely consider IPAs session beers, I could see myself sitting down and drinking a bunch of these. The beer is light enough in texture that you can sit down and really feel this beer."
"I've had this on tap before, and IMO, it's a better beer than bottled. I'll surely drink this again, as it's still a fine beer, but given the choice, I'd take it on tap over bottled."
"Hazy amber color with a vigorous beige head. Nice aroma of resin and floral hop. Medium body with frothy carbonation. Flavor is very hoppy, piney with a hint of grapefruit. Finishes smooth and tasty with medium maltiness. Yaste is a little better on tap as compared to the bottle."
"That being said, I'll enjoy the balance of the six pack."
"Overall, a great tasting IPA with good balance and likely to make most beer and IPA lovers happy."
"A very nice IPA, quite drinkable and is not over the tops with hops."
"D, notes: This IPA is well balanced, wonderfully hoppy and bitter without the over the top bullshit that accompanies so many West Coast IPAs."
"D - An enjoyable but not overly outgoing IPA. Smooth, clean and easy to drink."
"D - I quite like this one - a big, fragrant hoppy IPA."
"Thanks to blisscent for the opportunity to try this one. Batch# 8491 served in a nonic. Poured a hazy caramel-orange with a rocky, bright white, two inch head. Copious strands of sticky lacing with strong legs. Scent is floral hops and citrus. Primary flavors consist of hops, citrus and a piney essesnce. Also picked up a feint sweetness as well a biscuity quality and some residual spice that is difficult to place. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a pronounced carbonation burn. Easy drinking IPA with an interesting character and balance."
"Pours a deep golden straw color, somewhat hazy but not too hazy with a thin white head. Astoundingly fragrant, a wonderful bouquet of aromas. Brilliant piney hops shooting through with grapefruit citrus tones at their side. Very floral, probably the most floral single IPA I've ever had. A very crisp and well-balanced nose. The hops seem to be as well used in bell ipas if not better than any I've tasted. They just strike the perfect note here for me; piney, farmhouselike, and faintly smoky at the end. Citrus is still present, grapefruit in this case. A mild nuttyness. This is one distinct ipa and really something special. Mouthfeel is a very crisp and deliberate light-medium body. Quite smooth and highly drinkable this beer is one to savor anytime and with just about any kind of food too. Exceptional."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a 3 cm off white foamy head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of pine and citrus. Initial flavor of smooth bread malt and a spike of piney hops. Flavor becomes overwhelmed and dry with hops and has a lasting aftertaste. Moderate carbonation, medium body, alcohol noted as it warms and in the aftertaste. Overall one of the better IPAs I have had, no shock it does well in tasting comps."
"D- Yes. One of my favorite IPAs. Probably best with a meal and not as a session beer. This is something to take time with and fully enjoy the whole experience."
"Drinkability: Excellent, flavorful, balanced, robust, and of course, very drinkable."
"I would recommend it to anyone and I would definately buy more than a sixer. Enjoy!"
"D- easy to put down and very smooth. a six pack would be great."
"Pours from the bottle clear and golden, with a small, bubbly head. Aroma is mild but fragrant hops, more floral and grassy that citrusy. There's also a lot of malt there, honey, fresh bread, and a hint of lemon juice. Taste is soft, mild, but dominant bitterness, backed by some very flavorful malt that tastes almost like pancakes or waffles. Nice tea-like flavor around the edges. Mouthfeel is balanced, carbonation not-quite-prickly, more viscous than most IPA's, but the strong bitterness in the finish keeps it to style."
"floral hops in abundence, this is bid and bitter and hides the alcohol well, this starst sweet and has a smothness in all areas of the beer, this is about as good as it gets. this beer is one that i have to get more of for sure. i want to thank my aunt and uncle for bringing me home this beer from vacation. this is a beer that i could drink every day if it were avalable heer."
"Appearance is hazy but brightly golden-orange with an off-white head. Great lacing. Aroma...ahhhh...take a big whiff of citrusy-orange and lucious Centennial hops along with semi-sweet biscuity malts. Flavor is bursting with those lucious hops. There's almost a juciness to the mouthfeel from the flavorful hops and semi-sweet ""graham cracker-like"" malts. Hop bitterness is moderate but very smooth so that the finish is semi-dry and not harsh at all which makes it very refreshing."
"the firm bitterness and drying finish generally help drinkability, but this one can be puckering and demanding on the palate."
"A good ale. Not great, good."
"A very good brew. Great with a plate of mild buffalo wings. A nice offering from Bell's. A bit unbalanced, but some good flavors nonetheless."
"Appearance is orange-ish haze. Head wells up to a solid 3 finger pillow on a regular pour. Smell is incredibly citrusy. Taste is even more citrusy, like a mixture of lemon and orange rinds. Lots of complicated floral notes but most notably are the hops, just exploding all over the place. Mouthfeel is not bad, average thickness with actually quite a pleasant aftertaste. Drinkability is just average I would say due to the complicated flavor and high Abv%."
"This beer pours a semi cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head with tons of lacing. The smell is very nice, hints of vanilla and citrusy hops. The flavor as well is very nice, I only get a hint of the vanilla which I got from the nose, a wonderful level of citrusy hops mixed in with a solid malt backbone. The mouthfeel is nice, I did a heavy pour and it still seems a little overcarbonated. A highly drinkable beer and I wish it was available on Long Island!"
"Pours a cloudy, orange color with a moderate sized off-white head. Aroma is very floral hoppy with citrus fruits. The hops are definitely citrusy sweet with some orange, grapefruit and lemon and a soft finish. Slight bitterness and rather easy drinking. I'd definitely get it again."
"Bell's continues in their steak of solid brews."
"Smell was freshly sawn pine timber. Period. Lots of hops in the nose. Maybe a modest measure of grapefruit rind, but I got mostly pine resin. Nice, if it is a hop explosion that you seek. Hop flavour is actually much more modest than I was anticipating up front, then becoming a bit more assertive in the middle, with a nice, even if a little muted, malt character showing itself a few seconds after you swallow. Somewhat balanced, I suppose. A good beer that I am very glad I finally got the opportunity to try."
"pours with a nice 3/4"" white soapy/foamy head that sticks to the glass or the entire beer. A deep gold color, clear, carbonaton bubbles rising to the top of the glass. Carbonation level appriate for style. Beautiful hop aroma. Sweet malt taste, nice hop bitterness on back of throat and tongue. A snmooth, very good drinking ale."
"Picked this one up on a vacation to Michigan. This is a great hoppy ale. I was expecting something milder and was pleasantly surprised. Thank you Michigan & Bells."
"Drinkability: I've reviewed this one out of the bottle before - how does it compare on tap? It looks a lot nicer - the colors and head are both superior. Everything else seems to be pretty much the same, however. Guess this is one that holds up well, either way. Not my favorite IPA, but definitely a solid example of the style, and one of the better Bell's brews. Still recommended!"
"A faint touch of wheat on the tip of my tongue, followed by a lovely array of chalky, citrus and pine hop flavor. The flavor is very apparent, yet somehow restrained by the malt that is there. Very long lasting on the palate too, and finishes very hoppy. Touch of soft pretzel malt taste in the mouthfeel, somehow in the middle of the hop beauty. Spotty lacing in the glass. Extremely drinkable for a 7% IPA with this much flavor."
"Overall a great IPA"
"D: IPAs may not generally be the most drinkable style with the amount of hops they have. This one is so balanced that the drinkability is outstanding. The alcohol is well hidden in this one as well. I could easily knock back 6 of these (if I could actually buy them here)."
"I am reviewing this beer from the bottle but I am also a big fan of the mini kegs which my family traditionally gets around Christmas time. This beer pours an amber color with a huge thick creamy white head. Smells and tastes citrusy (and of course hops!). Orange flavors are present as well as a wonderful chewy hop flavor. The drinkability is high on this one. I could easily drink three of these but the abv is too high for it to be a session beer for me. This beer is very well balanced and has a clean taste to it. This is a beer that I go back to more than others. By far one of my favorite IPA's. Highly recommended."
"HV"
"This beer pours a dark gold with a foamy white head that holds and laces beautifully. The smells is a wonderful aroma of hops. This is truly a fantastic smell of sweet citrusy hops. The taste is again all hops. The Centennial flavor is amazing! There is medium-full bodied with some nice carbonation and a bit of dryness. Overall just amazing on drinkability if I could get this locally, I would drink it all the time."
"Just about perfect drinkability. A wonderful IPA that I will definitely seek out again."
"D- very easy to drink and refreshing. one of the better IPAs ive come across recently and im glad i picked this one up. especially since two hearted is one of the bells that wont be coming to IL, at least not right away"
"My first Bell's beer. Hopefully it will not be my last. Highly reccomended as a sessionable beer for this style."
"Utterly awesome, this is another great example of what an IPA should be. Aroma is floral, citrusy, piney and hoppy, sweet and malty I could sniff this for a long time. Pour is a nice golden copper with a creamy thick white head and nice lacing. Mouthfeel is medium thick and really smooth with a creamy finish. Flavor is an intense mixture of malts and hops, truly remarkable. The drinkability of this is good the strong hop presence doesn't become overly bitter. Fantastic! Overall this will become one of my favorites."
"It's ridiculous how good this is. Upon opening, it smells like an orange tree just planted itself in the house. Cloudy amber with a nice head that remains with the beer. Taste is well balanced malts, caramel, and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is low carbonated, but smooth. I could drink these all night. Well done Larry (this is my first 2 hearted...and I grew up in Michigan...I should have tried it earlier). Seek this out."
"D: I really wish that I didn't have to travel to get this beer. It has easily become one of my top five favorites. There is nothing cloying about this one. It is perfection in a bottle. The 7% ABV makes it a little less sessionable, but it was quite nice kicking back 6 of these while sitting on the balcony of the condo each night."
"A great everyday IPA. I love IPA's and this is one of my favorites so far!!!! I wish we could get this in Arizona!"
"I tried this again, after having a bad pour on my first sampling (over a year ago). This one poured a clear gold with lots of white head. It smelled like lots of floral and grassy hops, with a bit of caramel malt. It tasted like floral and grassy hops with sweet peach and a bit of malt. It was oily with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was much better than my first sampling. It was delicious and clean and makes me want to drink more and more of it. My only suggestion is that it could have used a bit more body."
"Defiantly has a nice summer ale quality, can picture sitting on some coastal waters while sucking these down. At the time of writing this I have consumed the aforementioned six pack and all in all have not been disappointed."
"Taste is very bitter and unbalanced. You could say it's great for hop heads but that would only be for cent hop heads. I tend to like the IPAs that use more than one hop variety aside from the double simcoe from weyerbacher. Still a decent IPA but I doubt I'll buy a third bottle for a long time."
"A cloudy straw-amber color with a frothy good head of white and excellent lacing. The aroma is a polite touch of lemony/grapefruit hops with a malty caramel underlayer and a hint nutmeg. The taste is quite bitter with a more floral/lemony hops and plenty of it. There's a candy malt touch but it's very light. This is a bright bitterness with fine carbonation, easy drinking if you're fond of hops. I get a slight popcorn sense under the bitterness. The feel is fairly medium body for a brew that is so sharp. This didn't strike me as being quite so good as it is on tap. I think it was a little mellower on tap, but this is definitely still very good stuff."
"Pick this up if you can!"
"Good drinkability because it's so smooth, yet I was actually a little surprised it was 7% because I thought it was a little higher by the way it went down. Overall I'd rather have Hopslam because of the endless complexities in comparison, but still a damn fine example of an American IPA bordering on Double IPA."
"Mouthfeel is lively, almost prickly, due to the high hop content, but with a smooth finish. I could (and have) drink these all night long but they do pack a bit of a punch, so I wouldn't go overboard with them. All in all an excellent IPA."
"Overall, this is one staple of an IPA. I really enjoy the style and Bell's has a very nice version of it. I highly recommend!"
"A knockout bombshell of a 5 Star beer drinking experience that leaves you in pure bliss, can't wait to get some more."
"I love this beer - especially on a warm summer night. Pours beautifully with a one inch head that dissipates fairly fast but leaves nice lacing. Smells awesome - hoppy, florally, citrusy thing of beauty. Tastes as good as it smells with plenty of citrus goodness and hop bitterness. If someone made me choose only one summer beer to drink for the remainder of my life, this would be it. Yummy stuff."
"D: Very good, flavorful and well balanced. Goes down almost too easily. Hoping Bell's starts ditributing in New Jersey soon because I need to get some more of this."
"D - This is a very good IPA this makes me want Bells in Texas that much more now I could drink this beer all day I think with its great taste worth getting and trying"
"Drinkability - Not sure if this review is a bit jaded by my sky high expectations, but this was just a decent brew. Now I don't mean to say it's crappy, but in the wide world of great micro-IPA's, this just doesn't rank up there with Stone, 60 minute, and HopDevil. This is definetly a brew worth trying, but not one worth going out of your way to get."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a slightly murky orange with a prominent head. Alot of lacing along the glass. Smell is hoppy and a slight a grapefruit undertone. Taste is hoppy, slightly bitter. Taste is accented by citrus and a slight hint of pine. A bitter aftertaste. Moderate carbonation in the mouth. Very drinkable. A good offering by Bell's."
"A very drinkable example of the style at only 7%. I can think of only one area where it may fall flat and that's the mouthfeel, which feels somewhat too dry and citrusy. Other than that, this beer is definitely a winner in my eyes."
"Drinkability - High. The bottle gets you into a good mood thinking about catching the trout on the bottle and the mood continues throughout the drinking process. Bells crafts some fine ales and Two-Hearted is no exception."
"and so i say to Two Hearted, i do understand. fish theme included, i would love to be out on the dad's boat, pole in hand, waiting for that adrenaline charging strike and slaking my thirst in the meantime. a great summer refresher ^_^"
"D: I believe many who really enjoy hops, more than I do, would really appreciate the pine hop flavoring. It is too much for me, but it is a decent IPA."
"This is a great IPA. In my opinion the best way to describe this beer is very well balanced. The hop presence is strong, but the body of the beer is a perfect match to create a fusion between hop and sugars for a homogeneous beer. Does that even make sense? I dunno, but this is a great IPA I would recommend it to anyone!"
"On tap at Coles. Clear golden amber with a quickly diminishing, nicely laced head. Aroma is floral hops with grapefruit. Moderately bitter with more grapefruit and a nice malt backbone. Good beer to drink while you sit around and play darts all night. Its also a good beer to drink with chicken wings."
"A surprisingly creamy mouthfeel up front, maybe abetted by it being on cask. Highly drinkable, with some nice malt characteristics moderating the floral and grapefruit hop taste. The Two Hearted also did not leave behind a parched feeling accompany the hops on the palate, as some stronger IPAs do (at least with my taste buds). Instead it was rather refreshing."
"D: Surprisingly refreshing even with the lingering bitterness."
"Drinkability: Just a great IPA. Tons of flavor, great balance. I could drink this all day."
"Bell's seems to do a lot of straightforward, easy-drinking beers. This doesn't blast you, really, it's just very fresh-hoppy and not all that bitter. Just an all-around really nice IPA. This is going to be one of my staples."
"D- Give me an IV. I could drink this all day everyday, other than the 7.0%ABV that will catch up if not careful. This is the perfect session beer! Cheers!"
"Overall- Overall a fantastic beer that I would love to try again. Should have bought more than one in Orlando. Oh well I'll get mroe when I go back."
"D. This beer was great. I could drink it by the case and may have to."
"Dispenses a mild hop bite on the tongue, along with some honest citrusy pine tar. Easy drinking, this is a very good summer beer, sessionable if you have a high tolerance. IMHO this would be an ideal beer to introduce those who haven't yet made the move over to 'craft' beers; good enough to be worthy, but familiar enough to most beer drinkers."
"I am glad I got to try this one, looking forward to more from Bells."
"It pours out an opaque light rust color with a nice white head. Pretty good lacing too, as the glass empties, with a consistent head. The aroma is all hops, nice and floral, with hints of faintly sweet fruit, like banana. The flavor is consistently hoppy (notes of evergreens), with more fruit flavors making an appearance (I thought of apricot) and some citrus flavors too. The hoppiness wins, of course, but it's an IPA and well-balanced for the style. There are lots of dense, tiny bubbles making for a wonderful, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, it's a great brew and I'm always happy to have another."
"Pleasant bitterness and lovely carbonation make a superb offering. I think I can drink this beer for the rest of my days. If I were stranded on a desert island this is one shipment of beer I would wish washed up on the shore. Wonderfully balanced, light and malty but with a large hop presence."
"If you're a fan of hops and bitterness this is a very solid beer. Seek it out."
"Two Hearted gives a real good pop when opened, it pours a slightly hazy orange brown color with a big sticky white head and lots of visible rising carbonation. The nose is clear and clean with lots of choice fresh hops, some peppery spice and a citrus note. Much is the same in the way the beer tastes, lots of wet tasting fresh hops, tons of lemon/grapefruit character and toasty malts. The weakest part of this beer has to be its mouthfeel, way too much carbonation. Other than that its got a medium body and i find Bell's Two Hearted IPA very drinkable...watch the 7%'ers though, they creep up on you like no other..."
"(Edit: Future tastings still haven't really won me over to this one. I'm just not a fan)"
"D: A decent session bier; will have this one again."
"6/22/10: Bumping it up to all 4.5s after buying several 6-packs lately. Simcoe making a much bigger presence felt than in previous tastings."
"My newest session beer, thank you."
"The hoppy aroma immediately brings to mind sugary flowers. Orange/tangerine notes rush forward as well. The color is dark gold with with a smaller white head. The mouthfeel is exceptionally full and delicious. The flavor is of course the main attraction. More citrus on the tongue, really kind of bitter but like any IPA. This is the IPA to measure against all others."
"Another Good summer beer, I will certainly be having this one again."
"Thanks again to Tilley4 for this."
"D - this is an excellent session beer with plenty of drinkability in its favor I wasn't blown away by this beer but wouldn't mind having a six pack every now and again."
"An excellent IPA, it has a wonderful taste. It's a very drinkable beer but you have to watch out for it's bite."
"D: High. I could easily knock back a 6-pack on a warm afternoon. This is an excellent IPA."
"Overall, this is a very decent IPA even by west coast standards."
"Great beer. I have and will continue to make this a regular in the fridge."
"Man this beer is good. I've had it a number of times in a number of forms, and although they're all excellent, I think I prefer it on tap. The flavor's are an amazing mix of piney hops and a perfect sweet caramel malt. There's just an amazing mix of sweet and bitter that somehow makes this one immensely drinkable. Body is perfect for the style. It's a dog race between this one and the Hopslam for more insanely amazing Bell's most delicious hop bomb."
"Hmm. Two hearted is pretty awesome. I don't think much more needs to be said about it."
"A cloudy orange/amber pour with foamy white head. Aroma is hop driven, small amount of malts. sticky bread, and some spice. Taste-Hoppiness is definite, light fruity notes, malt backing, light spice. palate is very lightly carbonated, bitter, and long. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Definitely among the best of the style!!!"
"D- Excellent drinkability, very refreshing nice beer with good taste."
"Another fine example of beer from bell's"
"I prefer the draft over the bottle. An easy to American IPA"
"M/D - Clean, refreshing, and very consistent beer. I bought this in a 6-pack more than a year ago and drank the last one right now. It's still fresh and tastes almost as good as the first one. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
"D- nicely drinkable, but a little to far toward the chemical end for me. though i'm technically a hop head, in a regular IPA i'd like to taste a little more malt present, a little more than just dry toast."
"A fantastic IPA. The hop flavor here is just bursting with juiciness. Some might call it a hop bomb, but I find it to be quite balanced. I can put down a sixer of these no problem. Probably not the best idea though being a 7% ABV brew. Very sessionable even considering that fact."
"D: This is just a flat out great IPA. It's my second favorite next to the Hopslam, and Nugget Nectar. Very flavorful and just all around delicious. Thanks again to kadonny for the great trade."
"Drinkability - This beer is balanced to perfection. Not too sweet and not too malty makes for a hell of a fantastic session beer. Incredibly tastey and easy to drink."
"D: This beer is very accessible for an IPA. Very smooth and easy drinking. Now I know why everyone speaks so highly of this brew."
"D - I really, really enjoy this but I am biased towards IPAs. I could pound a few of these any day of the year, they go down incredibly smooth."
"D= Larry Bell has done it again! This is a fantastically drinkable ale, and quite deceptive. The 7% abv is not readily apparent and will sneak up on unsuspecting drinkers... I would make this one of my number one session beers, but alas I live in Illinois and the a**hole distributors have caused this fine ale to disappear from my state."
"Overall, pretty drinkable. Not the most impressive IPA I've ever had, but well-balanced, very much on top of the style."
"Best attribute is that it is very easy to drink this, could have several, not a session though at 7%, but very nice, hides the abv very well. I prefer New Glarus' IPA, and Goose Island's is a match for this, but worth looking for."
"Overall a totally different experience than from boottle. Fresh from tap no doubt the hops come through way more and the malt sits more subdued. More balanced in the bottle, but both are super great. Still one of my favorite IPAs."
"This is my go to beer when I don't know what I want. Every time I pop a new one it reminds me of what beer can be. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a hazy, raw honey orange with a billowing 2 finger head that left sticky lacing down the chalice. The aroma is a explosion of citrus. Grapefruit is predominant with bits of orange and lemon. Also sweet grassy notes come through on the finish. The taste is what hops done correctly taste like. Grapefruit and lemon balance with just a bit of spicy/grassy notes. All the hops are balanced extremely well with a malty sweetness that comes out on the finish. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a wonderful coating of hoppy bitterness all around your mouth. This beer isn't a hop monster, its well balanced and goes down smoothly. The only knock is it comes in a little high on the alcohol content to be a session beer. Thanks Bell's Brewery for making one of the Worlds best beers."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable for its weight."
"Pours a very deep amber color with a moderate head and no real retention or lacing. Has a very floral scent with notes of citrus and plenty of hops. Has a very hoppy first impression and fades very well to a great bitterness, grapefruit flavor comes through in the finish. Goes down suprisingly smooth for as hoppy as it is. Could easily drink more than one of these and ranks as one of my favorite IPA's ive had, hopheads rejoice."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light, if not a little oily. However, I think I could drink these all night. A fantastic brew."
"Oh. Hell. Yes. Beer pours a cloudy, honey/orange color, nice fluffy white head, some pretty good lacing. Smell is grapefruit, hoppy madness!! Taste is a spicy, citric explosion, with some faint grassy notes, and a sweet malty finish. Bitterness lingers....excellent aftertaste. For me, this is what an IPA is all about...truly one of the finest I've had."
"Just the way I like it. Very good brew for sure."
"12 oz bottle poured into imp pint glass. Pours golden orange with a big fluffy white head. Smell of orange and grapefruit with pine in the back. Very sweet smelling. Initial sweet taste, then hops, then a crisp finish. One of the reason Bell's is one of the top brewers in America."
"D: As IPAs go, this one was different. Not really my taste, and I don't think I'd reach for it because the cherry tastes I picked up just didn't sit well."
"amazing"
"D - One of the easiest summer drinking IPA's i have had."
"Very drinkable especially a 7.0% abv. Wonderful brew. One of my all time favorites."
"Lately I've gotten away from these more everyday-type craft beers, but after a day of yardwork, this tasted great. Pours the color of a well-polished dooknob with some grapefruity hoppiness. Pillowy head. The flavor is clean, mildly bitter hops over a faint but unmistakable backtatse of Bazooka bubble gum and some lingering grapefruit. Sweet finish, but still clean. A very good example of the style."
"D - It's not all that interesting of a beer, and to boot, it's unbalanced and all over the place. Probably a great IPA for some, but not me. The appearance and generally decent IPA aroma are the brew's best qualities."
"I came here and read the reviews and don't see the ""bitter"" some speak of. This is an excellent perfectly balanced beer that just rocketed to the top of my favorite list. I like stouts and have been ""lighter"" beers, this one will be hard to beat."
"I wasn't immediately bowled over in part due to the big expectations but Two Hearted has grown on me. It's a definite recommendation."
"D: Really nice IPA. Glad I got to try this one. Again thanks go out to fellow BAs."
"UPDATE!!! these things kick your ass! Very very buzzable... potency wise...I can't get through a 6'er. And i'm a DRUNKO!"
"Definately a solid IPA"
"Just an overall great IPA. Should be one of the standards for this style."
"D: Easy drinking, great for summer, and summertime foods."
"Drinkability: Probably as good as it gets. This is a very well rounded beer with plenty of quenchability, flavor, and ample alcohol. It would pair well with spicy foods and would cut through charred meat as well. An icon."
"Drinkability: A very nicely crafted IPA; not as big as some others but suits the style"
"D. Very tasty from the begining to the end .Three of these in one sitting is perfect for me."
"Recommended..."
"Highly recommended if you can find it cask conditioned!"
"Pretty soft feeling, despite a bit of tingling from the moderate carbonation. Medium bodied. PrettyDamnDrinkable."
"Pours with a small head that faded quickly and aroma of pine and hop. Flavor is nice with the good crisp clean and refreshing flavor all the way down. Very easy to drink. I acquired this via a trade and wish Bells had distribution in my state. Get a box when you find this."
"Edit: Procured a case of this (thanks boralyl) and I think this may be the best session beer ever made."
"The blend of flavors is very nice. This is the second beer I've had from Bell's and I'd seek out more beers from them."
"I've never really been a big ""Hop-head"" but this beer may change the way I see things. Some IPA's are just too bitter, but this one mixes the perfect amount of hop bittersweetness, sweet malty goodness, and a grand portion of love. It's floral, it's fruity, it's sweet up front and dry on the finish. The perfect American IPA."
"Mouthfeel was great, chewy with an evident ""fizz"" but not too much. This is a potent brew, quite enjoyable - only slightly one-sided with the hefty hoppage... not that there is anything wrong with that..."
"D: At 7% one of my favorite IPA's. Almost always have this one on hand. Bell's has done it again! Cheers."
"The color is a deep yellow, with a moderate amount of white head appearing. Smells moderately of citrus, and tastes fairly strongly of grapefruit,a teeny bit of orange, a bit of malt, with a moderately bitter aspirin aftertaste. Carbonation was just right. Not the hoppiest of IPAs, but a nice middle of the road beer that is very very drinkable."
"The Centennial hops really come through beautifully in the flavor. It's like a field of flowers in your mouth, but it has enough malt there to balance it out and the hops never become overwhelming. The medium body and ample carbonation give it an excellent mouthfeel, and having a couple of these can be a real treat."
"D: To be honest I was expecting more out of this beer with all I've heard about it, not bad, pretty good, but not mind blowing and a little out of balance"
"10/4/08 Revisiting this is a real treat. Just as good as I remembered. If anything, I enjoy this more today than I did 6 months ago. Just an outstanding American IPA."
"D: I drank a few then went to something else I hadn't tried."
"The body has a moderate level with a light carbonation. Pretty smooth considering the ABV. Very clean with the minimal yeast characteristics. Overall very enjoyable."
"very drinkable and very balanced smooth ipa!!!"
"Overall, this was a good IPA. I have revisited after a while and find it to be better than I remembered."
"Hop flavor is wet, fresh, piney, resiny. Very bitter, to the point that the bitterness masks the flavor of the hops. Hints of orange pulp. Peppery. As it warms it mellows a bit, of course this could just be my taste buds adapting and being overwhelmed."
"Long, moderately bitter finish. Another winner from Bell's. This one goes done very easily and would make for a great summer time brew."
"The drink is medium-bodied with a wee sizzle of fine carbonation, and otherwise highly consumable."
"On tap. This poured a deep golden with a white head. The nose shows off the hops with citric and also a bit of piney hops along with a touch of caramel malt. The palate was well-balanced with the hops beginning and ending with the dry/bitter finish and the malts picking up the body in the middle."
"Eric"
"drinkability is good. this is a solid IPA. the hops are wonderfully aromatic and provide a nice profile. cheers!"
"Not the HopSlam, but a top-notch drinkable beer for those who value a heavy floral hops aroma and taste. Sufficient as a second beer for those hop heads who try the heavy stuff first while the palate is fresh. It cuts through those lingering tastes, which accounts for my high-ranking of this beer. So often an IPA becomes bland after a DIPA, but this one stands the test and affirms an identity all its own. Truly then, for the Two-Hearted!"
"Aroma was not very present, at least not what I could tell."
"D: Although it's really good, I couldn't drink too much of this at once."
"The only downfall. It wouldn't make a great session beer due to its 7% alcohol level. I can live with that."
"I have been drinking way too much of this lovely, lovely stuff to not have posted a review about it yet. Gathering from that opening statement, yup, this is going to be a very positive light shone on the beer that is Two Hearted. Spicy Orange Marmalade. 'Nuff said. Really. That was and still is the first thing that hits me when I drink this exquisite IPA. The honeyed citrus stampedes out of the glass on an aromatic mission to assault your olafactory glands. Luck for me I am a beer masochist. Then you drink it and the barrage of zest simply continues. But all of this hop juice is held in check by an assertive, smooth and full-bodied malt backbone. The finish is crisp, fragrant and your brain's que to hurry up and raise the glass to your mouth again. So drinkable, and even better when you can get it in the 5 ltr. party kegs. Whaaa? Yup, this purty little thang is now available in a jolly little aluminum barrel of joy. Well, not specifically RIGHT now, as Bells puts Two Hearted keg production on temporary hiatus while they crank out the Oberon mini-kegs, but come Fall they will be back. Much, much love to another fabulous beer from Kalamazoo. Well alright, Comstock. Cheers!"
"D- Very drinkable. Could put these away any time and any where."
"This is a pretty easy drinking IPA. If you can handle the big hops, this one is in your wheelhouse."
"A tasty brew, quite enjoyable, but not as classic as some I have tried. I've seen this one hyped a lot, and I dont feel the same level of love, even though it is pretty good!"
"Crisp, dry finish with a blast of carbonation that lingers on the tongue like a lazy Upper Peninsula brook trout before it's snagged."
"Probably my new favorite IPA. Another solid beer from the folks at Bell's."
"An interesting, quality ale that compares favorably with SNPA and other West Coast hophead pales."
"I feel lucky to have this as a standby... the only rivals it has are west-coast bad asses."
"M/D - Smooth and creamy. Nice carbonation. A very drinkable IPA."
"D - I think I'll have another!"
"Appearance is an orange color with a nice head and good carbonation. Some lacing on the glass. Smell is very citrusy with lemon aromas coming through. Taste followed the smell with citrus and lemon flavors dominating. Would have preferred this beer to be slightly lighter in body which would have made it more drinkable, but overall a good, solid beer."
"Poured a nice light copper/orange tinted color, with very little head and a bit of lacing. Has a nice floral and slightly citrus scent, although not extremely weak. Excellent hoppy/citrus flavor, a nice IPA with lemon/orange tones and an excellent bitter aftertaste. Not overly smooth, but not bad going down at all."
"its my favorite ipa. not without imperfections, of course, but it is a fantastic beer."
"Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, keeping the flavors under control and increasing drinkability."
"M/D - masterfully balanced, the flavors are great, but overshadowed by the amazing balance, Bell's continues to brew amazing beers"
"D- Towards the end of this beer I am just hopped out... but if strong, complex hops are what you are looking for, you'll enjoy this brew."
"D - I would have this again but I would prefer and IPA that finishes a tad cleaner."
"A tamer ""hopslam"" if a definition is required. Thanks to Greg for sending this one on a recent trade."
"oveall, this is a really good brew that i wish was cheaper but still not horrible at about $1.60 a bottle"
"D: This is a great example of an IPA, though it was probably a litle bit on the fruity side to be in my top few IPAs. Nonetheless, a well crafted brew from Bells."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange. Thick, fluffy, rocky head with great retention and lacing. The smell is probably the best I've ever experienced in an IPA. A great blend of those bitter hops with a strong citrus accent to it. Taste is incredible too. Very well balanced, obviously it leans more to the hop side but the hops arent overly dominant. They are there and present, but there is a malty sweetness to it as well. Taste very ""fresh"" and clean, just a great IPA. Carbonation is moderate and I'd say a medium mouthfeel to it. There is a slightly bitter, oily hop residue left behind. Overall this is just a great beer and I couldnt be more impressed."
"D: Pretty clean and dry, and it goes down quite smooth for the style. A notable brew, though I'd probably go in the Hopslam direction if after a hoppy Bell's brew, personally."
"Overall: A well-balanced IPA, great for hop-heads who seek more balance than a hop blast in their IPAs."
"D: It's loaded with hops and bitter. A thirst quencher and probably a good one. Good for several rounds but not all night."
"Overall, the beer is good. I could drink this quite often."
"d - This was much better then I was expecting :) This is a very popular beer and thus I was expecting something crazy and slightly over the top. This is the first IPA I have had that I can sit all the way through and enjoy every sip. This might be the gateway beer I have been looking for in hopes of gaining an appreciation for highly hopped beers."
"After having at least 50 of these over the course of a few years (as it is one I can't stay away from for long) I figure it is time to sit down and give it a review. This pours a light body that is slightly orange, slightly gold with a nice head that has a good deal of substance and fantastic lacing. The smell is of hops, mainly citrusy but also with floral and a bit of pine. Fantastic. This is repeated in the taste. Light bodied enough to be very drinkable, and the drinkability is only enhanced exponentially by the delicious taste. Good enough to serve as a thirst quencher. I can't think of a scenario that this beer wouldn't compliment whether it be a sunny day outside or a lazy day on the couch watching ball games. IMO, it doesn't get much better than this. This beer is the essence of what quality, crafted brewing is all about. Exceptional, all the way around."
"Although I waited awhile to drink and review this beer, both experiences were worth it. An extreme pleasure to drink, I could easily spend an outing or relaxed evening consuming nothing but this. A stand-out IPA."
"This beer felt very hoppy through and through with no over powering bitterness with it. Seems like Bell got the right mix here of it all, very drinkable and most importantly DELICIOUS! Try it cold or warm it's great either way. Hints of orange underneath but one of my top IPA's to drink!"
"Very good drinkability. This IPA is one that you can dance with all night."
"One of my favorite IPAs, and for the price, definitely one I like keeping always stocked."
"Drinkability- A great IPA, very tasty and enjoyable."
"Its not overwhelming, but is powerful enough to captivate. The factor that keeps me coming back is the fruity bouquet on the nose and backup with the flavor. It's so full of citrus and grapefruit, but in a purely essence of and bitter way. This beer is one which will be appreciated by the beer connoisseur and the nube alike."
"Poured from bottle into Sam Adams perfect pint. Thanks to lightindarkness for this one! Amber color with slight haze with a thin, wispy white head. Nice lacing. Smells of citrusy hops, light at first, but stronger as the beer warms and with each sip. Perfect flavor for an IPA. Good hop bite, but not overdone. I am a hophead, so I like it if it is overdone, but this one is what I would call perfectly balanced! The malts smooth out the flavor as the beer sits on my mouth. Great medium bodied beer, extremely drinkable! What I would call a perfect session beer!"
"Overall: A solid American-style IPA that's tasty and drinkable. I'd definitely look for this one again."
"Pours a light orange/straw color with a good sized fluffy head. Smell is amazingly floral with a titch of maltiness. Taste is most exceptional, big floral hops with some citrus oil (think orange peel). Malts don't make their presence till its time to swallow and its only a flash. Even though it is unbalanced it pulls it off really well. I wish there was a little more body to it but then again the lightness keeps it sessionable. Very good beer."
"D: Fantastic. My favorite american IPA. All around a great beer. Has a heavy piney, floral taste that is smooth and not too bitter for the amount of hops. A beer you can sip on all night (the ABV sneaks up on you). One of my overall favorite beers. Very well-balanced for an IPA with this much hop character."
"To date, this is the best representation of an American IPA that I've tasted."
"I bought this in a mini-party keg and boy was it good. I went out and bought 2 more after that.The smell is of apricot and citrusy flavors. Probably made with cascade hops and a strong hop flavor. Perfect for hop heads like me. I love the packaging too,I think bell's should make this their flagship beer and change their other ones to follow the lead.If you like this beer a close second is Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA"
"Overall: Thanks to Markgugs for generously hooking me up. The last time I had this beer, it was the first IPA that I enjoyed. I can see how it would have started me down the hop road. I love hops now. I rated this beer lower than I know it deserves because of my inexperience. Now I simply love it. My last review will not be deleted though since it was a valid review when I had a different taste."
"Lots of hops, but very smooth and fun to drink and enjoy."
"The malt that balances out the hops in the back makes this beer nicely drinkable."
"Stays well in the mouth and is very drinkable, given one's tolerance for hoppiness. The crisp finish allows for smoother drinkability and the bitterness does not overpower the palate."
"D - overall, two hearted ale on tap has some aspects better than the bottle and some worse. Thought the taste was mildly better as the hops seemed to pop a bit more. However, I didn't get the smell or the look of the beer that I got in the bottle. Couldn't get the hops smell to be as strong even after letting it warm up to room temperature. Overall, though this was a very good beer and one of the hits from Bell's which to me always seems like a hit or miss brewery. I would definitely get this again if it were on tap and would always pick up some bottles as a beer to just relax and drink."
"Very drinkable Michigan IPA."
"Pretty solid minus the weak front palate. It's a great IPA, though I'm not sure it deserves to be on the pedestal people lift it up to. I just don't taste what makes it better than say Titan, Celebration Ale, or Avery IPA."
"The color is a light, sienna-orange than most. Decent head and retention. Taste is good but the hops do not come across as well as some. Drinkabilty is good. To me, an AIPA should pack some punch, bring out the citrus- grapefruit charactor of the hops, and be a bit ""bigger""."
"Rich golden amber pour with a big sudsy white head in a tulip. Smell is sweet caramel like with a soapy floral hop aroma. Nice hop flavor with a bit of a dull malt sweetness, however. Not a bad IPA by any means, but I found it fairly mildly flavored in comparison to some others I liked more. Still, extremely drinkable and pleasant."
"Pours a cloudy lemon with a decent head and some lacing. Smell is a rich blend of hops and yeast undertones...mmm. This is a taste that is exceptional. Not only is a a fantastic hops assault but the balance. Mouthfeel is rich, almost chewy. Although not having a super high abv, it is a sipper, due to its rich mouthfeel."
"D- I could drink these all the time. The taste was unique in its own way. The higher alcohol content might slow you down a little bit. But you dont want to slow down because the flavor is good."
"D- This is a nice drinker. I didn't even realize it was 7% before I looked at the description on the top. Great beer."
"i think it needs more malt to help with the balance and improve drinkability. I managed to finish one, but i dont want another."
"This is one remarkable, smooth, flavorful beer. At $7.99 a sixer, this is highway robbery, yet another tremendous offering from Bell's."
"One of, not only my favorites from Bell's, but also the IPA style as a whole. Just a really great blend of refreshing citrus and piney hops that never becomes overbearing with either, while remaining hugely quaffable with an easy going body and finish. Just a pleasure to drink."
"Medium-light body, a little undercarbonated, dry, not particularly clean finish. Supremely drinkable."
"Notes - Easily one of the better IPAs I've had. Many thanks to dyan for the chance to try this great beer."
"This floral little beer invigorates the tastebuds with scintillating hop undertones and the bitterness of orange peel and lemon, which is an intriguing combination but not a completely satisfying one. It'll make a hop addict yearn for the close, but a wheat beer aficionado will be confused by the bitter aftertaste. I, myself, wanted something more along the lines of an Arrogant Bastard or Nugget Nectar, while this strange little brew left me confused and distracted."
"D: I wouldn't have more than two of these at a sitting, but would be a nice beer to keep in the fridge for a cold night."
"NOTE: This was re edited after a revisit about a year after the first experience. Whether it was my developing palate, or that the second beer was much fresher, I didn't feel my original review did it justice."
"Draft. Orange color with slightly off white head. Lots of citrus on the aroma. Some sweeetness. The flavor is full of hops with a nicely balanced sweetness some citrus. Finish is long and bitter. This is a really nice drinking IPA that would be easy to drink all night."
"Other: Very Impressed, a Must Try for any Hop-Head!"
"Brilliant golden color with a cloudy chill haze, very good head and lots of lace held on the glass. Loads of citrus in the nose with a little bit of grain. Very sharp bitter hop bite jumps out first, but surprisingly not much malt balance comes through. All bitter grapefruit citrus flavor, but almost seems metallic without a sweeter foundation. This beer comes off a little astringent. Medium-bodied, good carbonation. Definitely good to get your hop craving out of this beer, but a little too harsh to go for more than one or two. I know this beer gets outstanding reviews, but I can't put it at the top of my IPA lists. But all in all, not a bad IPA."
"This is a good strong IPA. I was a little thrown by the fish on the bottle, but hey, I haven't been disappointed with any of the Bell's brews to date. This was no exception. This bottle just seemed to go down exceedingly smooth and left me looking for the next. Recommended."
"D: very good IPA but not on the top of my list. I could definitely drink this one again to re-rate since I didn't feel it lived up to its hype."
"On tap at Jose Pistolas, poured hazy copper, amber, orange... Smells of citrusy and floral hops, caramel presence, too. The head was frothy and off white, it dissipated a bit and left alright lacing. Tasted of hops balanced with some sweetness of citrus and caramel. Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable. After having this, I need to find some Hopslam."
"This is a delicious and interesting IPA. It poured very nicely with a generous but not overdone head and a mild copper color. The taste was an explosion of citrus hops and grapefruit. It didn't have a strong malt backbone to provide balance, but the choice to keep out some of the more piney flavors makes this beer a very drinkable, warming, and refreshing IPA. I'd definitely drink it again."
"This is my favorite of Bell's year-round beers."
"Taste is initially hoppy but slowly mellows out in taste while in the mouth, might have to do with the creaminess of the beer, goes down smooth and crisp, leaves a nice bitter linger long after drinking. I have a hard time believing this is 7.0% as the alcohol content is very well hidden."
"Great brew. Aroma is heavy hops with apple and a dash of oak. Pours a dark yellow with a frothy off-white head with excellent lacing. Taste is beautifully IPA with a nice bitter finish over its long duration. Light to medium body, creamy mouthfeel with something just south of lively carbonation. A nice warming finish. Leaves me feeling exceptionally refreshed, I could drink a lot of this stuff!"
"D - Very enjoyable, I blew through the 6 pack quicker than I expected, must go get more."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a fluffy white head that leaves lots of lacing as it drinks. Aroma is all hops. Spicey, piney, grapefruity hops in all their glory. Taste is more hops with a little malt struggling to get through. Medium mouthfeel and ample carbonation round this brew out well. Pretty good IPA. I couldn't drink to many of these, but nice brew just the same."
"I've had this several times and haven't reviewed it for some reason. Perhaps I was just making an excuse to have it again. Color is a bright amber with a chunky white head. Lacing like crazy here. Smell is of fresh, crisp hops. Very complex. A vast array of fruits meet the nose, though mostly citrus. One of the most fragrant beers I've had (though HopSlam takes the grand prize there). Taste is loaded with bitter hops, though remains well balanced considering how hoppy it is. Medium body with satisfactory carbonation. Definitely one I will return to again and again, especially because it seems to show itself in unexpected places."
"Awesome IPA, nice story behind it too. As American IPA's get more and more popular, I think it's important to recognize this one as one of the early wave makers. Pours a wonderful sticking head, smells perfect, tastes reaaal nice. What is really weird, is flashing-back to my days of beer ignorance and trying this beer for the first time thinking what a bitter smelly beer! Now IPA's are my fav."
"I would get this beer again. Not the greatest IPA, but if I saw it on a menu or in the cooler I would put it in my choices."
"D. Very drinkable. smooth and mild with great citrus flavors. Wasn't a big fan of IPA's before but they are difinitely growing on me and this is the best one yet by far"
"Honey orange hues with a fluffy white head. Aroma of orange zest and bubblegum. More of the same in flavor on a of soft malty backbone that straddles the line of dry and sweet. Medium body with a beautiful finish of delicate hops redolent of orange blossoms."
"D:This is by far one of the most well balanced IPA's. I love this beer, I can sit down a drink a ton of this."
"After having this beer a few more times from my initial tasting almost a year ago, I have a completely different view of it. I realize now I was being overly critical of this beer especially when it came to the malts used. I think I was looking at Two Hearted Ale as a DIPA when I should have been looking at it as it truly is; a beautifully clean and satisfying IPA with an excellent balance of bitterness and floralness. I have to say this is one of my favorite beers now and most certainly my favorite IPA. Too bad for me I can only get it when my roommate goes home."
"I was never much of an IPA guy until I had this, and it is still my favorite. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Drinkability: A fine example of an IPA!"
"I think overall an average IPA. This bottle may have been a little ""off"" judging by the low, inactive carbonation. I'm a fan of Bells (especially their Expedition Stout), but I was not very impressed with this beer even the several times I had it on tap. I'm surprised it ranks in the top 100. I have had many better IPAs."
"Overall a solid beer."
"Very good."
"Very drinkable, terrific IPA one of my tops so far"
"Some people swear by Two Hearted, for some reason it doesn't always sit with me very well. I like hoppy beers and this fits the bill, plus brings along some sweetness, but just isn't one of my favorites. Seems to be a little better on tap than bottled."
"One of my favorites of all time."
"This is my favorite beer. I won't be one of those guys that give it all fives, because I know stylistically it's a bit light on the malt side of things, but if you're a hophead go out and get some."
"Poured an attractive orange/amber color with nice white head that hangs around a while and leaves good lacing. Aroma is piney and citrusy hoppiness. Flavor is beautiful balance of maltiness and hoppiness that again is piney and citrusy. Mouthfeel is perfect and drinkability is great. This is one fine IPA."
"Highly recommended. One of the best single IPAs I've had outside of California."
"I'd recommend it."
"It is complex enough to go with a variety of cuisine -- try with an artisan gourmet pizza."
"This beer definitely deserves to be in the top one hundred, it is one of the better regularly available india pale ales out there, could definitely drink more of this in the future, the people that have access to the mini kegs of this are lucky, highly recommended"
"Above average, a solid IPA, but not the earth-shattering experience some make it out to be."
"drinkable?? no"
"Overall - For hop-heads, this is a downright delicious, well-balanced beer. For people who aren't crazy about hops, you might want to steer in another direction."
"This brew was great. Go get some."
"Drinkability suffered from the prickliness of the beer and due to the pine aftertaste lingering well past its welcome. Overall, this is a decent beer but not one that I'd enjoy again unless I got a glass from a bad batch. Some reviewers have mentioned that they like the bottled version better, so I'll give the bottled version a try sometime."
"Nice but I like the bottled version better.Seems more hoppy.It was still nice to have though."
"d: I'm very glad that these are available on PA. One of my favorite IPAs."
"Medium gold, with a very faint haze (from all the hops?). Head is dense and rocky, leaving lace after each sip, all the way down. Aroma is fresh, hoppy, very orange like (Amarillo?), with hints of pine. Flavor follows through with a definite orange-like hop flavor upfront, followed by a soft, sweet malt. Both carry through into the tail, which is well balanced and light. Great IPA, with a very fresh character."
"D: I really like this a lot and am curious to taste this again in a bottle since I wasn't so impressed with it before I had it on tap."
"Pours a nice hazy copper with a delicious 1 1/2 finger sticky white head. Smell is amazing citrus/ pine, just an amazing and tranquil experience. Taste is mind-blowing as well. Citrus splash with the absolute balance of piney hops to send you wanting more with every sip. The absolute best ipa I have ever had. A complete pleasure to be experienced. Mouth feel is perfectly balance with carbination and thickness totally coinciding for a great mix. I could definately drink this IPA all day long.. I am totally amazed by Bell's 2 hearted..."
"Looks of a reddish amber with a decent head that sticks around. Smells of citrusy hops and sweet malt. The taste of this beer blows me away. It is quite tasty with citrus flavors of orange and grapefruit. The malt backbone holds strong keeping the strong hops in balance. All around maybe one of my favorite IPAs for its unique taste."
"If you're tired of playing around with IPAs, or beer in general, go grab a few cases of this. I have to go back across the border to get more next weekend."
"Pours a pretty foggy amber with a decent off white head. I could get a good whiff of this one even before I had poured it out of the bottle. Nose is perfumed pine hops. Flavor is a mouthful of hops that stays consistent. Thick hop flavors just stay with you. Feel has a good carbonation to it and a the liquid is pretty good as well. Overall this is a very good IPA. Definitely one for the hop heads."
"An excellent brew, excellent...This is one of my all time favorite brews...."
"Drinkable doesn't describe this beer. It is a staple. I wish I had this in my fridge all the time. It has incredible complexity and outstanding balance for an IPA. A must have for any beer drinker."
"A wonderful beer, I feel obligated to buy one whenever I come across it. Pours a somewhat hazy, copper orange, with a strong, citrusy, hoppy aroma. A modest head leaves a thin, clingy lace. Very intense hop flavor. A bit of a palate buster due to the high hoppiness, but expected from the style, and drinkability doesnt suffer."
"Very nice color and clear with a good head. First whiff tells me there are plenty of hops - some pine and slight citrus notes. The first taste is pleasing bitter hops that are like the smell, pine and slight citrus. Very light malt body with a slight hint of roasted caramel malt. Very satisfying and easy to drink. This is a definitely a session beer and an excellent IPA."
"D - Drink ability? YES! Bring me another case and another for tomorrow. I don't wanna share! Now leave me alone so I can enjoy my beer!"
"This is truly a beautifully balanced beer. It is difficult to believe this ale is 7.0 % ABV. If it were not for the high ABV, this would be a perfect 5.0 for a session ale. Seek out this one. In the Louisville, KY area, you can find it at the Liquor Barns. In southern Indiana, ""The Keg"" liquor store in Clarkesville stocks this as well."
"Pretty good IPA. Definately stands up to others I have had."
"If you should see this on the shelves when looking for a great beer GRAB IT!"
"Pours a beautiful amber/orange hue with a good sized pearl white head. The head collapses fairly quickly, but this beer leaves some of the best lacing on the sides of the pint glass that I've seen. The nose makes itself known while pouring the beer into the pint glass. Heavy scents of pine, ripe grapefruit, and orange rind. The floral nose is well done and matches perfectly with the taste. The flavor profile is the winner for me here. Starts out with bitter hops but the delicate pale malt comes into play to round out the bitterness. Fresh citrus fruit flavor, pine, and the sweet malt just work so well. Medium body and medium carbination leaves a slight dry sensation after the drink. The mouthfeel is actually a little creamy as well. I could drink this pretty much anytime of the year. Great offering from Bell's."
"This beer grows on me the more I drink it. It's very different from other IPAs I've had, and that's a good thing. Variety and quality is what good beer is all about. This beer is also strong but the alcohol is completely invisible, which is a nod to the the craft that went into brewing this beer. Highly recomended!"
"D - Good beer. I like this one a lot."
"Yummy. I was expecting more of a hop-overloaded blast of this after hearing about it. Hops obviously dominate, however I was impressed with the balance in this. Smells of grapefruit and hops. Taste is grapefruity, gets a little more grassy as it warms, but supported by a nice malt backbone. The sensations of freshly baked bread and oranges, and a sort of nice woody flavor are also apparent. This has none of the off-flavors that I've come across in some heavily-hopped pale ales. Very nice substantial mouthfeel, and the 7% abv is completely hidden. This beer is solidly well-done and really grows on you."
"huge hop taste, big malt back, floral aroma, two fingers of head,rings and rings of lace beautiful color, tastes of floral hops, and a nutty, earthy malt back. great beer, slighly out of balance but a good ipa really shuld be. best ipa i have had to date."
"D- A good beer, with good drinkablity for an IPA. Because of the bitterness and the bite, not a good session beer."
"I enjoy this a good deal although I sincerely question whether or not I could drink more than two in a sitting without getting tired of"
"Very nice, pale copper color with a decent head. Nice grassy and citrusy aroma. Blast of bitterness though not overwhelming. Moderate amount of grapefruit flavor. Good malty flavor to go along with the high bitterness. Nice malty body. The whole thing is quite well balanced. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Damn good US IPA."
"cheers."
"Definitely recommend, not much more to say. Thanks Jtrockchalk for this one, cant wait for more of these."
"Bubbley off-white 2 finger head that leaves lacing all over the place. Hazy straw colored yellow, but with strong orange hues; a golden orange galaxy. Delicious citrusy aromas, where grapefruit seems to dominate the aroma hops. The hoppiness does not overpower some sweet maltiness that pulls through, even in the aroma. Same hop presence in the taste, but with a nice orange zest, balanced by the same sweet caramel, slightly bready maltiness that reminds me a little of the german malt profile common in oktoberfests. Hop oils leave a little bit of tanin feeling on your tounge. Yummy beer, very well carbonated. I have this 1.32 gallon keg between two of us for tonight...so pretty drinkable. I finish one and really want another. This is the IPA that I will use to judge every other IPA; so so close to perfect."
"D- This is a hugely drinkable IPA. I love IPAs and DIPAs with the grapefruit/citrus hops and this one has that in spades. It's well balanced but my only beef with it is theres nothing that really jumps out and grabs me about it. Would be great (and deadly) to session."
"Amber colored beer with thin white head. Has a nice fruity aroma I can smell a mile away with a good oily hop coming out closer to the beer. Pretty amazing taste. A good amount of hops up front followed by the sweet esters...and as the bitter hop fades the sweet/smooth malt flavor is brought out. Drinks pretty well...a good beer to enjoy most of the night."
"Overall a nice brew, I may be able to finish this can by myself."
"I poured this hppy brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice golden color with a cloudy look. The beer smelled hoppy and was. It is great for what it is I'm sure and has a high rating, but I did not like it. Way to bitter for me and alcohol was right tight also. Not going to purchase this one again"
"I like this one better on tap than bottle--of course, that's almost always true, but in this case I've had both on multiple occasions. This is a well-rounded IPA, but I'd prefer a bit more flavor. That's just my preference. It seems to do better on a clean palette. This may be my next favorite IPA after Avery's."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and bitter but with a good lingering hoppiness. Not too dry. One of my favorite everyday IPAs. Also one of the best representations of the style that I can think of. Flavorful and very well balanced. Really excellent."
"Two Hearted and I go back a couple of years, and this time is not my favorite... maybe not the freshest bottle... but, I hate saying this (living in the West), a never ending keg of brewery fresh Two Hearted is my desert island beer ... as long as I have a nice malty German keg too. :)"
"My review of the taste may seem harsh, but in reality it's just because I'm having trouble describing it. An amazing beer overall...definitely living up to the hype."
"D = Good drinkability whether looking for a one time IPA to enjoy or for several to enjoy in an evening. I definitely recommend this beer."
"D- After having great IPAs like Alesmith, Racer 5, Centennial, and SN Anniversary this one doesn't even compare to me. Its not bad-and I can certainly drink it but is only an average IPA to me. I was somewhat disappointed because it could not compare."
"D: With proper focus and devotion, I think that i could finish the mini keg in one day. As it is, it'll probably only last two days (this is a good one for the Ravens MNF game). This is not the only mini keg that I'll be purchasing."
"I really like this beer! For what it is worth, this is one of my new favorite beers. I just wish I did not have to fly up north to pick it up. I usually visit MN for work, so I know the next time I go there what will be flying back home with me in my luggage."
"Cought a few of these (mind the pun) over Thanksgiving. Beautiful label that matches an equally beautiful pour. Good colored head heaping with a hoppy smell. The first bite was tastey and resolved itself well without stingy like lesser pale ales. Sitting on the table through out the meal this beer lost little of its flavor as it returned to near room temperature. Not a beer for everyone because of its strong taste, but certainly a good choice for anyone looking for an IPA to love."
"Highly recommended."
"All in all an excellent beer. Good smells, great taste, pleasurable on the tongue."
"D - As the taste fades from each sip, I want to go back for more. A very drinkable beer, not to heavy (though the alcohol content should be noted), a very satisfying blend of hop and malt for an American IPA. This is a staple go-to beer for me."
"Finally got my hands on some more Bells after they pulled out of Illinois. This IPA pours a cloudy golden orange liquid with a decent amount of carbonation trails. A nice fluffy chunky head leaves thick sticky lace about the glass. Powerful floral and fruity hops nose. Some piney grass elements. Taste is a full on hoppy affair. Seems some what tempered by sweet malt elements. The sweetness also hints at grapefruit and green apples. Mouthfeel is fairly full for such a hop centered brew. Finishes a bit tart. I found this to be a drinkable beer, not something you want to session, but a good dinner or conversation beer."
"The appearance is golden, somewhat cloudy with a rich creame head. It has a great flora aroma which lets you know immediatly what you're about to experience. The tast is upfront with a high hop tast. It is very bitter in the true essence of an IPA style beer."
"Such a nice and balanced beer. I could make a session out of this."
"D: Going down nice and smooth, and the buzz is hitting me pretty good. I've seen this on tap at a couple of local places and will be looking forward to having this with meals in the future."
"D- At 7% ABV this is not a session beer, but a nice refreshing drink none-the-less."
"Orange amber color with light foamy head. Head dissipates quickly but leaves lacing all the way down. Aroma is of grapefruit and pine, some fruitiness foreshadows the rich sweet taste. For me, a good balance between hops and malt. Feels substantial in your mouth. I drink this beer all the time. It has great hop flavor with rich malty sweetness and doesn't cost a lot. My favorite IPA for the price."
"D: Good for one beer. I am glad I tried it, but might not be my first choice in ordering again."
"A very drinkable IPA. Not harshly bitter while being a decidedly hoppy beer."
"Notes: A fantastic beer that I will definitely drink again. I'm not usually a fan of American IPAs because they're so unbalanced, but this was nice. Good job Bell's..."
"D- well balanced and brewed IPA, delicious, definitely a must try, not the usual hopped to death IPA's"
"Final Statement: A very drinkable IPA but the strange tropical fruit flavours make me think it was a pretty citrus hoppy IPA that is a little passed its prime. Would like to try again some day. Not a bad beer as it was though, just not an outstanding one."
"Thanks to czoch75 and unclejedi."
"This beer is exceptional. To date is this best IPA I have had. Possibly lacking in balance, but that is how I like my IPAs."
"Enjoy."
"D - Not a beer to be chugged - each taste packs a bitter hop burst to the back of the mouth, rendering a taste taken in quick succession rather dull. Best enjoyed slowly on its own, or with food that can hold up to its bite."
"D: Easily a staple in any hop lovers fridge... keep plenty around as you can through them quickly"
"D-- very easy and enjoyable beer to drink but also sneaks up on you as the alcohol is well hidden inside the hops"
"A beer that I will look for again, but will probably wait a few months before searching for a trade"
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a large white frothy head, the body was a cloudy honey. The aroma was immensely hoppy. Taste was good: dominated by hops with some citrus overtones. It had a light sweetness to the taste. It felt a little gummy in my mouth, the resin seemed to let the hoppiness linger in my mouth long after quaffing."
"This one lived up to the hype. I only wish I didn't accidentally waste some of it by pouring it in the wrong glass. Highly recommended."
"Into a pint glass, pours a soft, clear amber, a big ass frothy off-white head with loads of lacing. The aroma is powerful, resinous, piney hops exploding from the bottle, retching the air with citrus and fruit, fantastic. And if my olfactories weren't sent into overdrive, my taste buds sure were. The bitterness is jarring, the hops biting, the mouth delighting, the malts enlivening (and balancing, for sure). Its a sensory cornucopia, but not quite perfect. One could ask for a little more malt to balance, a little more body to hold, but thats cents on the dollar on this fine, bad ass beer. There isn't much to say about this beer that hasn't already been said, so I'll conclude; highly drinkable, highly recommended, yum yum"
"Could be the best interpretation of an American IPA."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer after being let down a bit by Oberon. It's fresh tasting qualities and hidden alcohol along with it's creaminess and balance made for one easy drinking beer. I will seek this one out on draft."
"D - Still high, I could put these back all night. It was thicker and less bitter than it's bottled counterpart. Still an excellent brew, but I prefer bottles to draught on this particular one."
"One bottle of this at Beer Bistro a few weeks back has skyrocketed this beer into top spot on my list of favourite IPAs. I don't know if it was just the shock of finding Bell's stuff in Ontario but, man, what a fantastic beer. The aroma was shockingly hoppy, with those great American pine-and-grapefruit hop flavours shining through but not overpowering. Expertly balanced flavour, with those same hop flavours supported by a great malt backbone. Restrained carbonation, and zero off-flavours all the way through. I love this beer. I want more. Much more. Perhaps a trip to Michigan is in my future..."
"I could a bunch of these, but don't. Savour them."
"D: I wish this was sold in the Boston area! I would add this to my rotation. It's a great IPA that's probably not too far off from being a DIPA. The balance of it keeps it from going too far into that territory. An excellent brew from Bell's!"
"D-This is a very good IPA. A very good hop combo produces a very good punch for the hophead in me. Overall the only negative is there could be a bit more of a malt presence. Still this is better than most AIPAs and a pleasure to drink."
"A great session beer all around!!!!"
"In my opinion easily among the best IPA's out there. Very seldom will you hear people disscuss IPA's without mentioning this beer."
"This American IPA is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Good body and quite hearty. Drinkable to be certain, but it will definitely creep up on you."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a lively, frothy head that hangs around. Looks very inviting and attractive. It has a large pine and floral aroma. You know what you are in for when you smell this beer. The hop bitterness is the first thing I taste with just a hint of malt then finishes dry and clean. The body might be a little thin but it is perfectly carbonated which enhances the bitterness of the hops brillaintly. An exellant example of an American IPA."
"D: Very good, I give her a B+"
"Overall, everything you could want from the style. Well balanced with enough hops to keep the hopheads happy. I will certainly be having more of this one."
"A very active off white head explodes to a three finger thick bubble foam. Bubbles pop fat and leave a little lace. Body is a straw colored amber. Nose is very loud with floral citrus notes and nice hoppy sweetness, this nose is lucious and inviting. A realatively silky oilly hop feel enters the mouth and is nicely coating. Slight piney citrus rind feel is long and even. Carries a bitter zip all the way through the the mouthfeel. Not quite as polished on the edges as Bells other hop masterpiece Hopslam, but still very good."
"I love this beer. One of my absolute favorite ipas. I seem never to be in a place or time to review it properly, but I finally find myself alone with a bottle with everyone else in bed and decided to have at it. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden with a very healthy head that sticks around and leaves some very nice lacing. The smellis wonderful. Deep and bright aromas of citrusy hops, some slight grassiness, and a slight hint of malt in the back to balance. Perfect ipa aromas in my book. The taste is also wonderful. The same wonderful citrus flavors and bitterness, a slight sense of graininess, and the hops turn earthy and spicy as the flavor goes on. Not the most bitter beer I've had, or the one with the longest finish, or the most perfectly balanced, but the overall package is nice- quite hoppy while retaining a certain subtlety. Very nice. The mouthfeelis full and slightly grainy. I like it, but I'd be happy if it were slightly less grainy. Exquisitely tasty and drinkable."
"D- I enjoyed this beer, but did find it to be too bitter for my taste."
"D: To be honest, not as drinkable as the bottled version. Nevertheless, it was definitely worth it to taste it out of the firkin in order to see how the beer I know and love changes with its fermentation process."
"Overall, a fantastic IPA. The malt character is more noticeable than in other hoppier IPAs that I like, but that just makes this one stand out in my mind for accomplishing this with such a perfect hop/malt balance for this style. If you see this beer, definitely try it."
"Drinkability- This is so much more drinkable. I could drink this all night if there weren't so many other unsampled taps in this location. I'm very glad that I have sampled it."
"I love everything about this beer, right down to the six-pack packaging. The natural, washed-out looking greens and the northwoodsy fish... I have a very big soft spot for lakes and pines, and this beer hits home right off the bat. Pop the top off the bottle, and you're immediately hit with this intense, fruity/floral hoppy blast. This beer smells amazing. It pours a bright and opaque golden orange, with a thin bubbly head. Upon the first sip, your mouth is met with an intense but pleasant hop burn. I've had some IPAs that hurt to drink, but this one is definitely much more friendly. As the hops disappear, they are replaced by a sweet grapefruit flavor, just about the most perfect fruity flavor in a beer that's not put there on purpose. The finish is thick and rich, with a sweet and spicy malt finish. You do this over and over and before you know it, your beer is gone and you are sad, because this one of the best-tasting beers that I (and apparently a lot of other people!) have ever had. Good thing there's five more in the pack..."
"Pours a slightly orange tinged yellow with almost two inches of white foam. The aroma is of citrus and pine hops, orange, grapefruit and lemon fruits as well. Nice biscuit type malt aroma. Taste is a good crisp flavor with just a right touch of bitterness. Good combination of citrus flavors and sweet malt backbone. As it warms up I detect some toasted aromas, toffee and butterscotch. Great mouthfeel and carbonation, the fizz makes it feel almost creamy. Great beer all around."
"M/D: To me, it is the mouthfeel that really distinguishes the good IPAs from the great. This is incredibly full-bodied, which really allows the flavors to linger for a while and penetrate to every corner of your mouth. Despite the great list of beers, i almost ordered another one - could have drank this all night."
"This is my favorite beer. I crave Two-Hearteds hoppy goodness often."
"Overall, this is a great pale ale, and highly recommended. More expensive than some other similar offerings, but it's worth trying."
"Drinkability: Good tasting brew with mabey a bit too hoppy of an aftertaste to appeal to non hop fans. Would not have more than one of these at a time. Not that it is bad, but leans a bit too much on the hops. I still believe that the 90 Minute is the ultimate beer when it comes to this style."
"This came in the pitcher as a foggy amber with a solid whiteish frothy head that stuck around forever. could smell the piney hops a mile away. This tasted great with a solid hop bitterness throughout, making it a very enjoyable drink throughout there was a medium body to it throughout, and had a big carbonation. this was a great IPA"
"This beer pours a hazy amber with white head that quickly reduces. Some lacing on the glass. Smell of piney hops. Taste of same with a good malt backbone. Well balanced. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, right carbonation, oilyness and a dry finish. I only bought one, I'll need to pick this up again. Paired well the very hot Thai curry. I do not detect the citrus most others seem to, I get pine and bitterness."
"A very, very nice IPA. I wish I could get it in my area."
"This brew pours and orangey, amber. Big head with sticky lacing all around the glass. Aroma is distinctively citrusy and piney with some caramel while the taste reflects a lot of citrus. Big hops explode in this beer but do not overwhelm the smooth taste of this brew. Very clean and smooth despite being hopped up. Big bitter aftertaste lets you know what beer you just drank. Very dry finish. A damn good IPA not to be passed up."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7796 - packaged 1/16/07. It pours a hazed, unfiltered amber/gold, with low carbonation, and a big, three-finger head that leaves large clumps of foam on the glass. The aroma consists of floral, perfumy, and piney hops, white grapefruit, pineapple?, mango?, and a touch of biscuity malts. About the same in taste, with floral, citric, and piney hops leading the way, bringing with them a hefty bitterness that is only lightly balanced by the malts. Medium in body and carbonation, it has a long, dry, and refreshing finish - overall a pretty drinkable IPA, and a good go-to beer, but at 7%, it can sneak up on you rather easily."
"This is an IPA man. I thought I would never say this but, this is an East Coast IPA that contends with the best from California. Highly recommended."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a pale golden amber color with a nice creamy off-white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is probably the best aroma of any IPA I have ever smelled. Fresh citrusy hops immediately fill the air and just dares you to take a sip. The taste much like the aroma is a hop heads paradise. The hops seemingly explode in your mouth making you die to take the next sip. Wow! This is one hell of a brew that will certainly become a staple in my fridge. Highly Recommended!"
"Two Hearted Ale pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a piney, resinous hop aroma. The flavor is also dominated by resinous and piney hops. There is a strong malt backbone in there somewhere, but that's exactly where it needs to be, in the background. The mouthfeel seems a bit on the thin side perhaps, but that hardly bears mentioning."
"The aroma is a sweet flowery smell with a nice balance of hop oils and scents of pine. The taste is excellent with a strong hop bitterness and a nice balancing maltiness. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with that IPA spiciness. A very good example of the style."
"Over 2 1/2 years ago, long before I was ever a BeerAdvocate, we used to go to Gallos and order this beer to try something different. Two of this would really rock our socks, and make for a nice evening. Little did I know how awesome this beer really is."
"My first beer from cask and love it. Cloudy burned orange with a nice off-white head and full lacing down the glass until I finished it. Looks unbelievable. Powerful scents of floral and citrus, strong hops, the nose is much better this time then out of the bottle. Tastes of strong citrus and powerful dry and bitter hops immediately followed by delicious malts. The carbonation is very low which allows more flavors to present themselves. Dry finish is perfect, no bitterness at all. An impeccable brew with an improved twist from the cask. MMM"
"An awesome IPA that deserves all the hype. East coast brewery, west coast taste. Gotta love it."
"Super AIPA, too drinkable, this is one that lives up to the hype IMO. I like my IPAs to have malt to back up the hops & this one comes through with flying colors!"
"Simply outstanding. The most citrus in an IPA I've ever encountered. Like eating an orange with peel attached."
"Pours a deep golden color, thick cap of foam that has very good retention and thin lacey streams. Lots of hop aromas, this is an IPA (sorry Alexander Keith). Fresh grapefruit and pine and spiciness. A solid tasting beer, sweet pale malt under a great hop punch. It tastes perfectly balanced, full bodied, hoppy, has everything going for it. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation to keep it slightly dry and refreshing. Great flavor, not so much hops that you can't taste anything else. Very nice example of the style."
"This beer is amazing. Pours a burnt orange yellow color with half an inch of head, which dissipates quickly. The smell is hoppy with a touch of floral, spice and orange. Very gentle nose. Starts a little sweeter than your standard IPA which I like. It transitions slowly to a medium hop bitterness in the end. Very nice balance and more drinkable than most other IPAs. In fact, I think this IPA has better drinkability than Dogfishhead 60min. That says a lot being that Dogfish IPA is one of my absolute favorite beers period."
"D - What a great beer all around. I've had IPA's at twice the price that were not this good. A great IPA to knock a few back in. Makes me think of warm weather. Well done Bells."
"Drinkability is top-notch and potentially dangerous. That distinctive taste really doesn't get old. It gets better and better. Why try any other IPAs when this one is likely to be better?"
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow/orange color with a huge head. Wow! The aroma is robust  first of hops then citrus and malt noticeable. The taste is initially bitter from hops, but the sweet malt follows quickly; creating a nice balance. The mouthfeel is full bodied. This beer smells wonderful and the flavors follow that lead  very drinkable."
"Pours a medium amber color with average size head. This beer has a great depth of flavor, because the hops are backed up by enough malt to balance it out. It is medium to full bodied, but not heavy. I thought overall this beer was very drinkable and all of its flavors were in harmony: I can't wait to get some more of this!"
"The first sip is a onslaught of prickly hops and fresh apricots then a soft caramel malt slides in to rescue your palate. The finish is dry with a hint of peacans and fig. The beer is so well balanced that is gives a nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- Excellent! This is an absolutely delicious brew that I wish I had access to. As a session beer, the ABV and slight heaviness to it may hinder it slightly but thats the only negative. This is one of the tastiest IPA Ive had in a long time and would highly recommend it. Thanks again tdp975!"
"This was one of those beers you'd never seen in the Tampa, Florida market without trying to look for it, except in speciality stores. After trying it, what a great beer! I am colored blind, so that hurts me when I rate appearance! My sister and I were playing a game of pool (the exceptional beer tasting environment) when we tried this. It's got a nice ""kick"" from the 7% ABV, but not where it overpowers the flavor. Great ""drinkablility", that's to say it tastes great. No bad after taste and it leaves you wanting to order another one, and probably another ater that. This is one beer you really have to try."
"4/3.5/4/4/4"
"Drinkability: Good beer for you hop heads (and you know who you are!). Not for the faint of heart.... but a great American IPA. The Bier Band HIGHLY recommends this to any ""experienced beer drinker"". A BMC lover would HATE this stuff"
"Drinkability: If I lived closer to MI or even in a state that sold this, I would drink this every day. Its my favorite Bells and its in the top 5 for favorite American IPA's. Smooth balanced and worth drinking every day."
""
"D - Very good drinkable IPA. Fairly high bitterness, but I still wish I had another one of these. The only flaw is the hazey, chunky appearance, but I can live with that. Easily one of the best IPAs I have had in a bottle."
"Big thanks to ohmybock for trading a beer I've wanted to try for quite some time."
"A great AIPA that you could drink for hours. The biggest problem I am having is pacing myself since this beer tastes so good. The 7% keeps you on your toes. It also goes well with my Mexican style food and wonderful summer weather."
"Poured into a Bell's logo pint glass.Peach colored with a white fizzy head that fades fairly quickly. Smell is grassy with citrus notes. Taste is nice bready slightly nutty body with some serious citrus notes. Grapefruit, orange with slightly sweet malty base. Hops are well balanced and coat the palate for a great lingering aftertaste. This is my favorite IPA. The carbonation, hop balance, slight sweetness are really in perfect harmony. This is one of those ""deserted island"" type beers."
"Beer strikes a nice balance between the hop and malt content. I'm a big fan of Victory Hopdevil and this beer is very similar in many ways. As I cannot get Victory in Nashville, I'll be heading to Bowling Green KY to pick up a half barrel of Bell's finest very soon!"
"d: pretty refreshing and citrusy, so i'd say drinkability is pretty solid, especially if you love hops."
"This beer might possibly be made of happiness and joy."
"D - If you love hops, pick this beer up"
"I've enjoyed this ale on tap many the time, absolutely superlative. So smooth and full of flavor...I've made friends at the bar by picking out pint glasses of Two Hearted by appearance and starting a conversation by talking about the superior quality and eminent drinkability of this beer. The bottled version is by no means a letdown, spot-on style perfection, and a personal favorite IPA."
"Ok, this might be the best looking IPA I've ever had, but not the best. The appearance has a short creamy head with thick lacing. The aroma is just a general citrus punch, a little weak. The flavor picks things up a bit, but it's not as bitter as I expected. It's a smooth bitter that puts it on par with a hearty pale ale. Still, the taste is of wonderfully fruity hop juice. Not overly powerful, but nice. I'd like a little more kick, but it's still a great beer."
"Overall, an excellent example of an American IPA from a well respected American craft brewery. This beer and Bell's in general are welcome additions to the FL beer scene."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite everyday beers. It refreshing and thirst quenching on a hot day. One of these after mowing the lawn puts me right where I want to be actually lets me honest 2 or 3 puts me right where I want to be. Thanks Bell's for coming to Florida."
"12/14/07 - update... just had to come back and add a bit to one of my first reviews... since the time of my first review, i've had two hearted on cask, on tap, in the bottle, and last night - in the new 5L mini keg. sheer heaven. hazy amberish with lighter feet that seemed to give the beer a glowing appearance. the girl i drank it with commented right away about how she was astounded by the appearance. she's not a beer geek, but appreciates good schwill. said it looked like an airbrushed picture of the perfect beer in a magazine. georgeous off white head that had supernatural retention and lace. this was so good last night out of the mini keg, i want to give it 5's across the board... malt character was caramelly and sweet. a perfect vessel to carry the fruity, floral hops. almost full bodied, silky, smooth mouthfeel. it left me wanting more and more and paired perfectly with the gruyere mac and cheese that we made. hands down, one of the best beers i've ever had. thanks larry bell. if any of you hop lovin' ba's haven't gotten a chance to try this beer out of the 5l can, run to the store now and pick one or two or three up. don't sleep!!! highly highly recommended!"
"Thanks Rudge for this one. This beer was dark gold with a real pleasant hop nose to start. The mouthfeel was very smooth with the hops coming into play but an almost English flavour came to mind in the rounded complexity of the finish. This is a very individual IPA that is very drinkable but not a over the top west coast hop monster."
"A hop-head delight here! Wish it were available in my area. Thanks to dekker0 for this hop treat!"
"Two Thumbs Way Up"
"D - Pretty good. I would definitely have this again . . . if just to smell it."
"Poured a nice orange-ish color with a white head that disapates nicely. It just smells of grapefruity hops, sweet and tangy. It has a nice smooth bite, and a sweet malt that is phenominal. The alcohol is hidden quite well in this one, as well as a little sticky, but that what makes a good beer, right?"
"Drinkability: Big hop load makes a good example of an American style IPA. Hop flavor apparent and balanced with the hop aroma, containing earthy and citrus components. Could use a little more malt flavor to enrichen it. Highly recommended for hop heads."
"The flavor is bright citrus with a big, but smooth, hoppy finish. Very little detection of malts. Smooth, refreshing, and really hits the spot. I found the carbonation to be a bit much, but that's hardly an objective criticism. This is a well-made brew that stands out in the dense forest of American craft IPAs."
"Thanks to the Mellow Mushroom in Indy for staying late and pouring me an extra pint of Two Hearted. I could still taste it in the morning. I have heard fabled stories of this fine ale and may now report back that they are legitimate. One of the best IPA's I have ever had. It made the Alpha King that I tried after it pale in comparison. Wish I could get this out in Colorado. This is a definite hophead's favorite!!!"
"D- I can't say I'm really new to Bell's in general or even Two Hearted specifically. This will continue to be a ""go-to"" beer for me, especially in the warmer months. As I don't consider myself a true ""hop head", this is the hoppiest (yet drinkable) I've enjoyed."
"An excellent, hop-forward IPA. From what I know of this beer, it is a very basic recipe, but is executed flawlessly."
"This beer really impressed me. I am not a hop-head and it's a style that up to recently I did'nt spend much time on, but I am exploring more now. I enter each one with caution. Pour is cloudy rosy orange, rocky head. Smell is great, floral and fruity, hops right. Taste and mouthfeel is smooth, light, nice hop presence with just the right amount of bitterness, fruity but not overly so. Overall this beer does'nt make my mouth pucker, and I would love to have had lots more, but only bought a single, will be looking forward to it coming to my state, I hope."
"I can see why this is consistently rated so highly. Awesome IPA."
"Drinkability: Yes. May I have another please? Unfortunately, I only had time to have one, but I'll be back. Now I just have to find this in bottles. Fantastic stuff, excellent IPA."
"Scott"
"D: Excellent. Two Hearted has lived up to my expectations. Too bad I don't live in MI."
"Overall: Perhaps my favorite thing about this beer, aside from its wonderful taste, is that it is bottle conditioned. Surprisingly few American craft brews are. This living beer is an outstanding examplar of the style."
" I must add that when drinking this beer from the firkin, I prefer it with a month at least of cask age before drinking. I have drank this less than a two weeks after it was casked, and about a month after it was casked. This has definitely been my most favorable experience with Two-Hearted from the firkin."
"Very drinkable...but as I said, it is thick for an IPA. The thick sweetness (though nicely balanced by the tartness) makes one enough for me...for now. Yummy."
"Simply one of my favorite beers."
"As I drink this sixpack over a week or two I fall in love with this beer more and more. Utterly blissful beer experience. This beer just sings on the palate--smooth creaminess, fantastic aromatics and bitterness, balanced touch of sweetness in the malt--perfect harmony, you can't stop sipping, before you know it the glass is empty...and you are SAD--genuinely dejected that the pleasure pouring from this bottle will live on only in your vivid, tantalizing memories. I will need to make regular pilgrimages to get this stuff..."
"Fantastic taste!!! Hops bitterness and pine and citrus. Rich and varied taste, I could sip this one all day. Mouthfeel is crisp and rich. Certainly would not enjoy a lesser tasting beer after one of these. Drinkability is good, this would be a three-and-out session beer, but it would be a good session. I can't get Bells products here (This one came from D's 6 packs and dawgs near Pittsburg). If I could buy them here or if I could find this beer on tap in Tidewater VA...life would be good."
"Orange, lightly hazed. A whipped-looking white head rises a good three fingers high and leaves behind patchy lacing. Bright sugary citrus aroma, like a handful of centennial hops. The flavor is certainly not a letdown if you're looking for hops. But its not an in-your-face tongue massacre, its loads of fresh, oily hop flower power. Like candied grapefruit, but never heavy and cloying, the filling mouthfeel is surprisingly easy to handle . Naturally bitter, though not overly so. This is an IPA all about that sticky hop cone FLAVOR, not just IBUs. Really delicious stuff...I've found its already become one of my favorites."
"This beer would be a nice sipper on a late summer afternoon. Dry quality pushes it towards a session beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Very smooth and drinkable. Carbonation and abv are perfect. I could easily session this beer. Overall, this is an excellent IPA. Highly recommended."
"A very well put together American styled IPA...not exactly in the Pacific NW style but it bears many characteristcs. tThe nose and flavor are infused with a wonderful hop mixture that indicates both hopback infusion and dry hopping. Smooth, Big flavor, well balanced, drinkable and satifying. This ale has all you ask for in a daily beer."
"This is a damn near perfect beer. I have had this on draft at some less than reputable establishments and it never tasted half as good as this. This is great. Maybe a touch too much carbonation but this still seems to be a benchmark for me. Possibly the best IPA I have sampled."
"D: Top notch, one of my favorite American IPAs. I highly recommend giving this a try."
"This is very enjoyable and goes down like water. Quite the sessionable IPA."
"On tap at Vintage estates in Boardman, Ohio. Pours a nice golden amber color with fluffy head that does hang around for some time and leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is very hoppy, what else would you expect it is an ipa, and a damn fine one at that. Taste is very good a bit bitter but not as bitter as others a little bit more carbonation than others as well, making this beer highly drinkable and such a good find having it on draft."
"D - Extremely easy to drink, I love IPA's in general but the best ones are the ones I can only have a couple of because the wonderful hop flavor drys me out a little. This is no exception, Great beer."
"Two Hearted has a burnt straw color to it with a nice two finger bright white head that slowly dies down throughout tasting. Lacing is very sticky, holds on the the glass with all it's got. Unique fruit aroma, mostly grapefruit but it also has a hint of sweet apple underneath as well. Taste is very similar to smell, but that isn't a bad thing. Very enjoyable to the taste buds. Some floral notes seem to arise as well on the tounge. I would say this is a pretty light bodied IPA with a fair amount of carbonation, quite balanced if I do say so myself. Lovin' this IPA for sure, glad limesmut sent me an extra one ;)"
"I've had it on-tap and I've had it from the bottle. This just seems to be near perfect in every aspect. Pour is light golden with a fluffy off white head. Pretty good carbonation and lacing. Smell is of fresh grapefruit hops with an excellent floral aroma. Definitely one of the best smelling IPA's to me. The hops seem more inviting rather than aggressive although they are there throughout. Taste is exceptional. Grapefruit citrus hops with a sweet floral aroma. Great hop bite that is lightly malted as well but the hops surely dominate. Mouthfeel is tingly from the hops, yet smooth as they come. Nice crisp finish that stays on the tongue forever it seems. Drinkability is through the roof as well. As I said above the hops are there and definitely dominate but they are balanced in such a way that makes this the most refreshing and drinkable IPA out there. This is one of my favorite styles and Two Hearted seems to set the bar pretty high. It doesn't look much better than your average, though you can't judge a book by its cover. Highly recommended. Thanks to Scoobydank and Nathan15 for the bottles."
"D: I dont know, call me a hater but I was not too fond of this beer. Overall I did not think the hop/malt mix was all to great and the sweet and bitter taste got a little annoying for me towards the end. Its not hard to finish but I dont think Ill be revisiting this again.."
"What a fantastic IPA. There is a reason it has a 91 rating here. Get if you can; if you can't, trade for it!!!"
"Bottled from batch 7770. Pours with a small head that faded quickly and aroma of pine and hop. Flavor is nice with the good crisp clean and refreshing flavor all the way down. Very easy to drink. I acquired this via a trade and wish Bells had distribution in my state. I can't wait to try to Hopslam!"
"What's not to like? I have to say that this is, without a doubt, one of the best beers this guy has ever had. Hops Hops and more Hop but well balanced and very drinkable. Don't let the man get you down Two Hearted, you are the best of the best!"
"Two-Hearted is a fine beer, not the best IPA I've had but certainly in the top 10. More aggressive hopping would get this higher marks from me."
"D- I think it is pretty good but wouldn't say it is one of my favorite IPAs."
"Drinkability is solid. The only hit it gets comes from the 6% abv. I wouldn't want to make plans for after sessioning this beer, but a couple would be great. Recommended."
"Overall this is a fine American IPA and well worth seeking out, especially for hop fans."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a wavy head that's characteristically smooth for a heavy-loaded IPA. Smell is perfect: many layers, but mostly floral hops of the cascade and fuggles variety, but also a certain sweetness that's hard to put your finger on. The taste is big and chewy, with the same hop character as in the smell. Terrifically balanced though, many times beers have a one-dimentional hop taste and this seems to totally buck that trend. As the glass empties the taste seems a little less spectacular but just as dense, a feat of a great beer."
"Taste does not dissapoint in the least. Herbal hops dominate, aniseed, pine, citrus in smaller doses. The lovely part about all this is that this beer is extremely well-balanced. Lots of bready/biscuity malt that is almost cookie like at times, other typical baking flavours come through, a little vanilla, caramel, and even a bit of banana surprisingly. Grainy in the finish with lots of hop bitterness. Well-balanced which I appreciate so much in an IPA. Not as dry as a lot of IPA's I've had but I don't mind that, although the carbonation could be toned down a little. This is probably the most drinkable IPA I've had the pleasure of trying, the balance and the flavour is just outstanding, and I could session this all night long to be sure. GET ME MORE!"
"Cheers."
"The body on this beer is amber with a one finger white head. The aroma has a ton of grapefruit in it. That grapefruit is present in the flavor as well along with a bunch of hop bitterness in the flavor but it is balanced with the malt. As it warms up, the sweetness become more up front and brings the balance more toward the center. This beer has a medium body and it fits the beer perfectly."
"This beer is hard to beat. The only thing better would be more of the same. The name ""HopSlam"" comes to mind!"
"The mouthfeel is medium, and the drinkability is great. I could drink these all day. The bitterness is not overpowering."
"Served on tap into a standard shaker pint glass. Appearance isn't thrilling... rather unremarkable golden color with some white head that disappeared quickly & left no lace. Smell is good ... full of citrusy/piney hop notes and a bit of the malt sweetness. Flavor likewise shows some of the malt notes (cereal/biscuit) & plenty of the floral/spicy/citrusy hops. Finish is dry and very hoppy. Very much balanced toward the hop-head's taste preferences (very unbalanced toward hop aroma, flavor and bitterness). Mouthfeel is smooth, body pretty much ""medium"" weight. One of my favorites in the style (along with Stone IPA, DFH 60 Minute). A decent choice for a session ale if you are a hop-head & also a good choice to recommend to people who appreciate hoppy beers or are willing to at least try to push their envelope further."
"A golden/amber color with an off whitw colored head. The aroma very complex, with citrus, pine, and earthy scents. The taste starts with a strong malt flavor, and it dominates the palate till the very end, when that expected bitterness caomes in at the end. A thin watery feel, very surprising, folowed by the strong presence of carbonation at the back of the throat. An incredible aroma, is let down by a mediocre taste and less than appealing feel, was very disappointed, but I will probably give this beer another try."
"Drinkability: This is a brew where the year round hype is a valid one. Bells outdid themselves with HopSlam, but this stuff is beyond damn good for the sessionable brew. It has the flavor, the balance, the alcohol at 7% (via the Bells website as I write this), and the quality for one of the best IPAs available, especially, as I said, year round. It took me a long time to try this, and I suggest you don't make the same mistake I did."
"cheers..."

"Mouthfeel is fairly light and very drinkable."
"Taste spikes a balance of fruit and hops. Orange, plum, peach, mango, and apple cidar. The carbonation levels were great, and the mouthfeel was juicy & crisp: flat out amazing. A nice hoppy aftertaste lingered, but not so long that is frazzled the tastebuds. Drinkability is top notch; goes down smooth and has plenty of taste and complexity. Solid IPA, Bell's."
"12oz bottle split with a friend. The color was a light orange-yellow with a fluffy white head. The smell was oddly sweet. The taste reminded me of candy and nothing else. Grape candy to be specific. Maybe I will try this again but I was not too impressed."
"D: It's been a few years since I've had one of these and I'm kicking myself for passing over this at the beer store for many other less worthy IPA's. So satisfyingly hoppy! An excellent drinker that, dare I say, can be sessioned. Come back to IL, Larry Bell."
"I'm glad I had another chance at this. It's a different experience when I'm away from the bar. I'm able to pick up many more flavors this way, and for the most part, they aided in my experience of this beer. Bell's continues to impress."
"The mouthfeel is light, fluffy, and refreshing, with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability increases, as the late-palate bitterness diminishes a bit (or maybe I'm just getting used to it), giving way to some nondescript hop oil flavors. I believe I could put a few of these away."
"Its drinkable, and enjoyable but dont think i would choose this beer again. worth a try, but imho not so ""great"" just good"
"12oz. bottle poured a dark golden color with a large white head that leaves some spots of lace. Smell of citrusy hops like tangerines and oranges. Taste has a bit of a watery feel at first and a slight bitterness towards the end with flavors of both sweet and bitter citrus fruits. This brew is very easy to drink and is one of my favorite go to beers to have a few of."
"A great IPA. Its own beast - not quite like the NorCal standard I'm used to (the puckery bitterness isn't here), but it's no English-style wallflower. I love this beer and want more!"
"This is certainly a wonderful IPA, almost a quintessential example of the style. It's complex and the hop profile is inviting rather than overpowering. I think I'll just skip my spring and head right into summer with the wonderful brew."
"A good hoppy brew, although not very complex. The low serving temperature might have reduced its taste, though."
"Taste is surprisingly sweet at first, lots of citrus flavor, predominately oranges with malt sweetness and a touch of caramel. Hops take over as you finish the sip, but not overly bitter. Overall, a very well-balanced brew. Well-carbonated and smooth going down without much of a bitter aftertaste."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle. Batch 7856 served in my Dogfish Head shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a hazy, golden amber color with at least two fingers of dense, fluffy off-white head. Decent lacing is left on the glass with each sip. Smells of flowery hops very similar to fruity pebbles cereal (of which I'm a fan) and sweet malt. Taste is the same as the smell and very well balanced. Medium to full bodied with decent carbonation. An overall great beer."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite beer I tried during my Philadelphia trip. I could drink this often, and now that it's finally distributed in Florida, maybe I will!"
"Overall, this might be my favorite beer of all time. It's not the most extreme, and thats why I like it. It takes the concept of a hoppy beer to the next level by having as much flavor as bitterness. Fantastic all around and highly recommended."
"Poured into pint glass, a very nice slighlty cloudy orange hue. Smallish head; very sticky lacing. Very pleasant aroma of citrus hops. You could almost just smell this beer. Excellent balance of citrus and hops flavor. Just bitter enough, but not enough to pucker your mouth. Predominantly orange flavors with some grapefruit in the mix. Finish is dry and clean. Exceptional drinkability. My favorite 60 minute IPA so far."
"For me it is not clear why this is ranked so much higher than other IPAs, it is very good, but there is not earth shakeing difference. It is probably all these hopheads ;-)). Thanks to todd1 for this great beer."
"Overall impression: Definitely for hop heads only - this is a quality IPA if you appreciate the over the top hop character."
"Overall a good contender for the 60 min IPA. Tastes a little fresher but I will have to drink a few more before I consider making a switch."
"($8.49 / 6-pack)"
"However, I found this to be harder to drink than most IPA's. But please dont let that keep your from trying this beer, its excellent in my opinion."
"Notes: One of the best....If not the best Ipa's I've had to date."
"This is a great IPA. Very drinkable and one I'll always have in the fridge."
"Pours a pale copper color with a small white head. Aroma is a balanced combination of floral hop notes and mild pear. Taste begins with a generous floral hop punch as soon as it hits the mouth. A slight bread-like malt backbone can be noticed in the roof of the mouth right before a dry, hoppy finish that leaves you no choice but to take another sip. Being fairly light in both body and carbonation make this one easy on the palate, and quite easy to throw back several in a sitting. Very nice year-round beer!"
"update: have had too many times to count, perfect every time. i like that this is unique in it's light color and honeyed, floral characterisitics. also that it's always well-carbonated, moreso than most bottled ipa's, but not in a seemingly artificial manner."
"Not available where I live...story of my life. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but definately top 20. This beer is devoid of any true flaws and has some great strengths. This goes down absurdly easy and I'd love to have a few more tonite but I must ration my supply."
"Pours a bright, clear amber with an orange hue, The head is a good 2-3 fingers of ivory color that drops slowly leaving a good amount of lacing. The smell is a very fresh, pungent pine & citrus. It has a sharp hops and resin taste with a bitter bite and a lot of complexity in between. A nice medium mouthfeel. A very tasty, easy to drink, gone before you know it beer. Anyone liking an Am. IPA will probably appreciate another high quality Bell's beer. I'd love to be able to have a fresh one of these anytime I felt like it."
"Drinkability: A damn drinkable and fresh IPA. Great hop profile that shows lots of complexity , with a nice restraint for the amount of hops there is. Really tasty a balanced , nicely crafted brew."
"The pour into my Sam Smith glass raises a wild inch-and-a-half head after a not-so-hard pour (I like hyphens). It falls, of course; but ever so slowly, leaving thick bubbles and lace stuck to the sides of the glass. It's only slightly off-white. The body is a bright, translucent gold with a honey coloration. When the glass is tilted, the lacing is patchy and slick. The nose is bitter and filled with citrus notes, and perhaps slight hints of white raisins. The taste is just on the bitter side of balanced, and reminds me of a rich white bread with marmalade. There's also a bit of pepper. Very nice. The mouth is quite thin, with perfect carbonation. Paired exceptionally with some sharp cheddar. I usually don't overly enjoy IPAs, and this bottle of the six pack, the very last, tasted much better than the others. Maybe I'm just in the mood, but this is a great beer."
"Received this beer in a trade (thanks markgugs). Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a hazy copper orange color, with about two fingers of thick, frothy white head that hung around almost to the end. Left sticky , thick gobs of lace on the side of the glass. Had a rather mild nose to it. Hops , grass, bread, and some sweet fruity tones. Taste was of mild bittering hops, sweet malt that balances the beer out nicely. Some citrus notes in the background as well. A pretty mild brew. Pretty well balanced in the mouth, moderately carbonated with a nice full refreshing feel to it. Drinkability is great. I have to get more of this brew."
"Medium bodied and very smooth drinking. A great session beer."
"Leaving a pleasent feel in my mouth, with a tangy feeling brought on from the constant citrus flavors this is a beer that goes down so smooth but allows you to realize that you are drinking a beer, and not water. I personally am the biggest fan of the smell and taste but this is probably the standard that all IPAs should try and live up too."
"I also had one last night on tap at All-Season Grill in East Lansing -- very nice as well, but I preferred it out of the bottle."
"Compared to any other high-hops beers, it has the best balance."
"Quite tasty and easy drinking for an IPA, mostly due to the good balance between the hops and the malt. The relatively low ABV (for an IPA) make this a decently sessionable beer that I would have no problem packing away three or four. Definitely will add this to my would buy a case of it list."
"beautifully crafted, very well controlled. most brewers attempting something like this would've given into the temptation of overly sweetening and hopping to the point of ridiculousness."
"From the aroma I expected a full throttle hop explosion but discovered an overall well balanced IPA that allows the starring hops to be well supported by a nice malt flavor. I have not been disappointed by Bell's and plan to make a pilgrimage this summer."
"This golden orange IPA has a 2"" rocky white head which stands up. An impressive blend of aromatic hops, citrus overtones and hints of pine this is a beer that starts out strong and finishes pretty true to deliver a well balanced IPA. Very drinkable and a real palate teaser. One of the best blends of IPA out there and worthy for any red blooded Muskie fisherman."
"This is one of the best IPA's I've tried and Bell's never disappoints with any of their releases"
"D: Nice IPA with very good balance. Really opens up as it warms too."
"Anyway, it pours a big beautiful head without even trying, I poured a little rough and had to stop the ensueing head from overflowing the glass. Looks great!! The smell is very nice grassy hops that are smooth and not harsh at all. The taste is a bit reminiscent of the Bohemoth this year from FFF, so if you've had it this is very similar. The mouthfeel is very nice, only a little bit of harsh carbonation comes through. Overall I am very glad to get this fine drink in IOWA!!!! I will have many more to come. Thank you so much Bell's!!"
"A classic American IPA. It pours the color would expect, has a perfect head, and then the nose- wow! Great hop aromatics. The taste is just perfect- fruity, perfume hops, without any astringent bitterness. Just amazing. Malts are then as a great backbone, but this beer is about the hops as it should be. The approachableness of the hops is what really sets this apart from the crowd. Any average non hop head can have a sip of this and say- this is a really tasty beer. That is an accomplishment that can't be understated- for the masses and for the hop head. Between Two Hearted and Stone IPA for the best all round IPA in the US, in my limited experience."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden/orange color with a white head that lingers around a while. Lacing is good. It smells mostly like floral and citrusy hops, very nice. The taste is obviously hoppy, with just a bit of malty sweetness, it has good balance to it. The mouthfeel is thin, but it's very smooth and crisp. Drinkability is very good too, I think it's a good sessionable beer. IMO, it's a good IPA, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Ale is what I measure all IPA's against- so far, it's the best in my book."
"Highly recommended"
"A really drinkable light ipa, with alot of hop character but seems a tad unbalanced. i think a little more malt character would make this brew even better than its reputation. Still easily drinkable and sessionable."
"A very enjoyable IPA. This one is on the top of my all time favorite domestic IPA's. The dry finish keeps my palate alive and awake, waiting for that next incredible quaff."
"Pours a lightly cloudy golden color with more than a finger egg shell head with descent hang time. Has a substantial fresh hop aroma and a notable fruity characteristic. A smooth and creamy hop flavor. A medium body that's slightly carbonated. Very drinkable. Would like to do a side by side with Southern Tier IPA."
"D- I could drink this beer every day at all times."
"Recommended."
"This is my go-to IPA; I almost always have it on tap and have yet to find another that is so consistently enjoyable."
"Notes 11-2007: Sampled an ""aged cask"" of this recently, after a year it is way mellow, and strongly similar to hop tea. Uncarbonated, watery, with an earthy suggestion of hops, but nowhere near as balanced as it is fresh. A novelty (not altering any scores here). Do not cellar this, for the love of all things good and holy."
"Lovely beer, pours a full cloudy orangy color with a nice white head and some good lacing. Smells great, citrusy floral hops, very fresh. Taste of grapefruit and freshness, love those hops. Has just the right amount of bitterness to balance the thickness. Very smooth and delicious. Great IPA!"
"Drinkability - Sessionable, in fact if I could get this easier it would be my new go to IPA. We've just began to see Bell's here in VA and I couldnt be more excited. Hopefully we'll get some better distribution b/c this would always have a home in my fridge."
"This is a hop bomb, pure and simple. It has enough hops for a DIPA but lacks the malt and alcohol presence. A good IPA overall, but I expected more complexity and/or balance."
"Drinkability: decent, didn't have another one on the night"
"bottle dated 11.12.13 consumed 12.06.13 - just as lovely as always, floral and bright citrus rind of lemon/lime/tangerine, so fresh, exceedingly cleanly malted with a perfect bitterness, a personal favorite and key to my intro into the scene - scores left intact. going back to my roots tonight with two hearted, double cream, cherry, java, expedition, and third coast on deck."
"I was always put off this beer by the freaky looking fish on the label. However, having recieved some as a gift, I thought I would give it a try. It is drinkable, with a strong grapefruit tone and a nice fullness to it. But I was no super impressed, to me it lacked some of the complexity and over tones of other IPAs. If I try it again I'll give an update as I am suprised that this well liked beer from a well respected brewery isn't doin' it for me."
"Hazy dim copper. Thin beige head. Lace is more than adequate. Spotty, droopy lace all the way down. Aroma is a lot of hops and a little toffee malts. Not quite as ""bright"" of hop tones, but they make themselves known nonetheless. The flavor is great. Again, the hops aren't as ""bright"" as the pushed or bottled version of this, but they are very enjoyable in their citric and piney characteristics. The malts are toffeeish in nature and provide the perfect balance to the hops. The bitterness is very clean. The mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy and velvety and very little carbonation. Room temperature and perfect. This was the first time I had this on cask and it was so damn drinkable. This one is drinkable by the gallon in this form. Great beer on cask."
"D: Drinkability is sky high. A true hop head's session beer. Extremely clean and refreshing. An easy drinker for every occasion. Always a present in my regular rotation."
"Overall, this is outstanding. I'm sorry that I waited this long to re-try this beer after getting an obviously bad bottle. I need to try this fresh or, even better, cask conditioned. All the flavor components exist in harmony here, and all the components individually possess a high quality. Excellent."
"Appears hazy golden amber in color with a big bubbly head that fades fast into a patchy layer of bubbles, minimal lacing. Smells of citrus and pine. Tastes of grapefruit and pineapple up front followed by a touch of malt and then a nice smooth pine needle finish. Medium in body, light in carbonation, with a smooth, drying finish. Highly drinkable IPA, not overly pined like other IPAs, very sessionable."
"Poured from a 12oz with a batch ID on the back label that allows you to go to website to get info on the beer like the date brewed. Was a hazy copper orange color. Had a good head that settles down to a constant foamy top. Considerable lacing throughout the drink. The mouthfeel was awesome - nice and creamy. The aroma is most definitely IPA with dominance of hops and what another reviewer called piney resin. There is also something sweet in there but I can't identify it. The taste is also awesome with a smooth start then a big bit of hops then settles down before becoming to bitter. Very well balanced. I really enjoyed this one but seems best as a regular instead of heavy player. Highly recommend. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts balanced, sweetness in the background but hops dominate as this IPA is true to style. $1.89 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"Hangin' at Bell's in 1999, every Sunday was Two Hearted Ale on the hand pull afternoons. We would go up there after a heavy night of college drinking and would cure our hangovers. If you ever catch this beer at the Brewery on the hand pull, it will probably be the only beer you drink that day. This is an India Pale Ale -IPA style beer."
"Overall, a very satisfying soft yet hearty IPA. Excellent flavors, and well balanced in its flavor profile. I've nothing bad to say really. It's just good."
"D - Wonderful. Once of the few IPAs that I would really call a session beer without killing all of my taste buds. The slight sweetness from the malt really helps a bunch."
"D - Overall, this is a very well-rounded IPA that was surprisingly a bit sweeter than I had anticipated. Lots of nice, sticky hops. I would pick up a case of this sometime. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Superb. Phenomenal session beer that I could drink anytime, for a long time. Blissful simplicity."
"Another American classic. This beer is perfectly balanced and very distinct."
"This is very drinkable. This is so smooth that it's dangerous. All in all a good offering, but I prefer non hoppy beers for cask offerings."
"Very difficult to only drink one, but alas I was by myself and had to be able to get home. Could enjoy a few of these as I cannot imagine getting tired of it."
"D: This is a beer that made me see IPA's as something to be savored instead of my previous thoughts as just being a ""sour beer""."
"Drinkability- With so many IPAs available in NJ (and more are coming), this would be a real gift to hopheads in our region. This beer has it all... and it makes me want to savor each sip. My glass is empty now, and my only want is to have another."
"Bless you, BA JeffKrenner, for the bottle!!!"
"This beer really excels in drinkability, its such a tasty beer and would make for an excellent session beer when your taste buds are in a bitter mood. This is one of my favorite IPAs out there, I'm glad I picked it up again."
"It didn't blow my socks off, but it was a solid, flavorful, easy-drinking IPA. I will definitely get more of this in the future. Recommended."
"Thanks to my cousin in Madison, WI for finally giving me chance to taste this awesome craft!"
"Grabbed the last bottle of Two Hearted tonight from my local beer store. Glad I did too. Pours a nice golden orange-yellow, with a bit of haziness to it. Quite pretty. A nice two-finger head which lasted a while and left a beautiful lace down the glass. The aroma is very citrusy. Orange and lemon hoppiness. Tastes delicious too. The perfect blend of malt and hops. Very fresh. Orange hoppy flavor to finish it off. On a second gulp I get hints of lemon and starfruit. Some pine as well in the following aroma. A tasty and complex IPA for sure. Mouthfeel is solid. A fantastic beer from Bell's. Quality stuff."
"Thanks for the bottle MuenchenerKindl!"
"Drinkability/Notes: After much anticipation, Bell's Two Hearted made it to the DC area and the wait was well worth it. A fantastic IPA made with all Centennial hops makes for a hop heads delight. Big grapefruity hops with just a touch of honey like sweetness to balance makes for a delicious IPA. Alcohol is well hidden. Visually this is one great beer as the clarity of the beer, the long lasting head and huge amounts of sticky lacing make it visually appealing. Two Hearted lives up to its billing as one of the best IPA's and one that has found a permanent home in my DBF. Drinkability factor is through the roof as I could drink these all day. Highly recommended. Seek and Enjoy"
"great american IPA, goes down easy, but more than two or three of these in session will certainly dull your senses"
"Wish I had more and will definitely purchase more in the future. Highly recommend this one to the IPA fans!"
"Drinkability is pretty good and I could probably suck a few of these down without getting tired of hops or a sour stomach."
"This is far too drinkable. I don't usually find beers that make that characteristic so easy to score. I love a moderately-alcoholic IPA that still manages to slap you around a bit. Only, this beer is like being slapped by the most beautiful person you could imagine... and wanting more!"
"Drinkability/notes: A very well-made example of the style."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D: Great beer, absolutely delicious, with the delicate touch of a masterful brewer. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
"Pours a merky amber color with a nice 1 finger frothy head that was slow to disappear, this just looks yummy. Smell is knock your socks off!! Citrusy hops all the way, unreal smell, orange and grapefruit in there. Taste is loaded down with citrus, with a fantastic dry hoppy finish. A bit of a grassy, pine taste, but one of the most citrus favored hops I have ever tasted. Went down ohh soo smooth, just right carbonation. This is so a keeper, cannot wait to get my hands on some more of this. Just awesome, really awesome brew."
"This is an exceptional beer, and one of the best American IPAs I've had. Delicious!"
"This is a very easy drinker and easy summer quencher."
"D: A very nice example of the IPA style, if not mind blowing."
"This is definitely an easy drinking beer that I will pick up again."
"A very drinkable IPA from Bells that has really impressed me. Too bad I only have 2 bottles."
"Try not to give out all 5""s,but I couldn't do it any other way!"
"Very pleasing beer. I found the flavor much more appealing than the aroma."
"D: Um, I'll have another, please."
"Deceptively easy drinking; nice to have a good old-fashioned single IPA without too much alcohol showing through. Very pleasing all around, especially on the nose."
"D: Simply a wonderful IPA! No doubt I'd have another of these - fortunately I received two in the trade. Thanks again, JE!"
"I poured this from a 12oz bottle I got from Westy's outside of Harrisburg PA. It's sort of a golden amber with a smallish head that lingered for a while. Nice lacing throughout. The smell is great with lots of pine, citrus, and a little honey. Very balanced. The taste is much like the smell lots of citrus, pine, and some clove as well. Not too bitter but not sweet at all. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry at the end. This is a very drinkable beer. The kind of AIPA that you can have many of. Definitely one of the best AIPA's I have ever had. Really perfect for the style. Very hoppy but not stringently bitter - nicely balanced. Great beer."
"Taste is well balanced with a great bittering hop character. Not overwhelming, but perfect for this style. Finish is dry with a citrus note. Excellent beer. Well made. Kudos to Bells for making great beer!"
"The best that I have tried so far from Bell's."
"I just realized that my case of this is almost empty and I had yet to review it. So I quickly banged out this review. I hope I did this beer some justice."
"Id heard a lot of positive buzz about this beer before trying it for the first time. Now, in my part of the world at least, it seems like it occupies sort of a gold standard of craft beer (IPAs at least). Appearance is amber and cloudy. Gead sticks around, and around. This particular example was still sitting around even after the glass was empty. Aroma is definitely hoppy, and a bit sweet. Flavor is hops plus citrus and very pleasant. And after, you get those great hop-flavored burps! Ive had it before, and Ill be having it again."
"Ok, so I'd probably have the mouthfeel be just a little chewier, and definitely creamier. It's just a little too carbonated, and on the thinner side. But still, that's a minor criticism. This beer delivers. It's utterly satisfying, while at the same time leaving you wanting more."
"The taste is equally great. Plenty of hops, well balanced. Mouthfeel is a great mix of sweet & bitterness and the aftertaste lingers on, playing on your taste buds. I tend to be stricter in my assessment of American IPAs, those being my favorite and I recognize my tendency to get carried away while having one - but this is indeed a great beer and I'll definitely recommend to all beer enthusiasts."
"Stumbled on this at a good restaurant in Akron. This is one great IPA. Great hop aroma and a nice crisp taste. Not over the top and not too pine resin-like. A little different that some of my other favorite IPAs. A little smoother to drink. They went down really quick."
"Overall-A fine well crafted beer with over the top pine hops that I could certainly appreciate on a frequent basis."
"well I heard that bell's was not going to be in chicago for a year, so I ran out and picked up the latest and last batches of Two Hearted. this is a very nice, very drikable beer. also it seems to be very comparable to the Two Brothers Heavy Handed. glad i got 3 sixers."
"D - A little too unbalanced. Good drinkability, but I believe there should be some balance."
"If this were available in my area, it would without a doubt be my new ""everyday"" beer. Fantastic flavors all around, that you can really sit and enjoy, but not so outrageous that you have to pay full attention to each sip. Also, (despite the fact that I live imperial and double everything) this is a really nice change of pace. Anymore, it's almost hard to find a hoppy beer that is well balanced. This one does it perfectly. Great beer, and definitely worth seeking out. Now I'll just have to hope that Bell's starts to distribute in VA."
"Someone trade me more of this!"
"Pours a hazy light amber with a modest head that dissipates quickly. Great hoppy smell. Taste is brings evidence of the hops in a well balanced brew that finishes with hints of grapefruit. Feels quite pleasant in the mouth making it a very drinkable brew as the whole experience is exceptional."
"Slainte!"
"I could and did drink a bunch of these. I could drink it all day honestly. Cant say enough good things about this one."
"Maximum respect to hoppymeal for sending me four bottles of this beer in our recent trade. Poured into a nonic, Two Hearted Ale is undoubtedly hazy, golden amber with a dense and rocky small white head and sticky lacing. Sparse carbonation. Profoundly zesty citric hop aromas, with grapefruit and pine notes abiding. A substantial caramel malt scent is also detectable. Sharp grapefruit bitterness leads the hop profile here, with young spruce cone and apricot flavors arriving late in the sip. Some mineral notes ride along with a rather understated caramel malt bill that is all but obliterated by the brash (but not overwhelming) hops. Bready aftertaste. Peppery mouthfeel, juicy too. Pretty dry finish -- actually, pretty dry overall. Very nice mouthfeel on this just about medium-bodied ale. This is a ridiculously flavorful IPA which makes it incredibly drinkable. Easily one of the best of its style in the world."
"A very good IPA, I really like the buttery/caramel sweetness it has to it. Highly recommended."
"this is a good beer to drink and solve the problems of the world with friends around a fire. i think that pretty much sums it up."
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Its color is a nice full amber though a bit cloudy. It left quite a head, two to three fingers worth with moderate lacing. Its smell like its taste is quite fresh and citrusy, with a slight bitterness. A solid mouthfeel, not too watery. As for overall drinkability this my be my favorite ale I have sampled. Recommended!"
"This beer pours a nice orange golden amber with high lights concentrated around the bottom. The head is decent centered around edges. Smells great fruity maybe some pineapple, orange peels, nice aromatic hops, some spice and a lovely piny body. Honestly it smells so good. Tastes pungent, good bitter hops, a bit floral a little sweetness, some crispness and a very dry finish, not as clean as some others. This is a definitely a dry English style IPA. Personally I prefer a bit more American stickiness in my IPA, but this a a good offering from Bells."
"pick up a 6 pack and enjoy. Not too much alcohol so you can enjoy 2 or 3 without getting too dizzy...."
"CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- n(good ANY time though)WITH FRIENDS-Y SIPPING-Quintessential! GET MY BUZZ ON- Hell, yeah!"
"Pours a light red with a large foamy head & the lacing stuck around for a long time. Powerful aroma - grassy, hoppy, and bursting with grapefruits & orange. Definitely a hop-hog's brew...bitter, but balanced. The fruit aroma comes back in the aftertaste, and the wonderful hops stay with you through the whole drinking experience. I'd say having two would be perfect...wouldn't drink much more than that in a single serving, though."
"Wow. I had heard others mention how good this beer was and I was happy to finally try it. Now that I know where to find it, I may never leave!"
"two hearted is one of michigans best ipa's, two thumbs up."
"Love it, and will happily buy it again. It's just a shame that I have to come all the way to North Dakota to get it! (Captain Jack's Liquor Store near the Kirkland Mall, $7.99 per six pack.) Makes for a nice night in a hotel room! Now where the hell is that pool?"
"Bell's Two Hearted Ale really impress me. To start, I poured a golden brown w/ a frothy 2 inch head. Lovely scent of pine and grapefruit w/ a hint of malt and florals in the back ground. The brew is well balanced, w/ a bold and dry flavor that begins lightly sweet and ending like a IPA should ""bitter"". At the same time it has a soft carbonation feel and the bitter aftertaste is long lasting. The brew left an excellent amount of lace and the head last thoughout the whole drink. Go ahead and buy a six pack it won't disappoint."
"Overall, this is a great IPA for hop-heads, and might also appeal to those who are looking to try something hoppy without getting their tongue seared. I really like the fact that a beer that is so hoppy can be so warm and inviting, not to mention EXTREMELY drinkable, at the same time. This beer has great balance of character, and I will definitely pick this up whenever I see it!"
"This is currently my go-to beer when I'm just looking to have a couple (or few...), replacing SNPA and SABL. A great beer in every aspect, and I can usually get it for around $9/6er."
"Drinkability was very good."
"Two Hearted Ale was golden amber in color with a large white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was mostly hops (grapefruit) with a little malt in the backround. The taste was very good, cirus hops with a malt backround and a bitter finish. It is medium bodied and medium in carbonation. While the beer is bitter, it is not overly so, making it a very drinkable beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability in tops I would buy this two, What a great brewer. This beer is big on taste, smooth, thick, just a perfect combination to make the beer work right. Prost und Zoom Wahl! MK"
"Pours slightly cloudy and golden with a big rocky white head that persists for quite some time. Aroma is citrusy hops, lemons, there is definitely some noticable sweetness present as well, a bit of sweet oranges, very enticing. Taste is sweet malt combined with citrusy and herbal hops- nicely balanced and similar to the smell. It finishes with a pleasing lingering hop bitterness and a distinct biscuity flavor. Mouthfeel medium and moderately carbonated- just about right for this. This stuff is very drinkable. Tastey and so nicely balanced (for an IPA) there's nothing to get tired of. In fact, I'm going to get another right now."
"A very tasty treat for a hophead. Flavor is aggressive but balanced. Initially very fruity, but becomes more piney as it warms. Recommended."
"And for that I bump drinkability from 3.5 to 4."
"To put it simply, this is one of the best beers Ive ever had."
"Tried this for the first time on tap this weekend. Wow! Very good beer for the hophead. Pours a very clear yellow with a nice white head. Very strong hop aroma is one of the first things noticeable. The flavor is full of hops as can be expected, and I found citrusy overtones in the hop flavor, a nice blend of bitterness to round out the flavor. The beer has a medium body, so you could definitely drink a few of these without feeling ""full"". If you like a high hopped ale, this is very drinkable. I had two, and found by the end of the second one, I was starting to reach my limit on that particular hop flavor. So, it seems to me that it would be great in moderation, but not something I could drink all night long."
"D - If they had this on tap in prison, I would say please lock me up! Great stuff!"
"My new favorite IPA? A IPA that relies on taste, not bitterness, that will always empty my wallet if I see it on the shelves."
"9/3/07 - I revisited my original scoring almost a year later while enjoying yet another. After numerous American IPA tastings, this beer remains one of my top 3 for the style, if not my personal favorite - such a great beer. It's an all-time classic."
"Drinkability: This an IPA that is so agreeable that its hard to drink just one"
"D- A smooth consistent IPA, that still packs a punch when it comes to"
"Drinkability = Excellent! I wish I had bought some more after two bottles."
"D: Definitely one of the best in the style. Extremely pleasant to drink, and it comes at a great price. This one is up there in my book with HopDevil and Burning River."
"D: Extremely well ballanced IPA, satisfied my hop fix for the evening"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with hints oif a grainy yellow hue. Light bubbling a lacing add to the visual experience. The aroma is like baking hop biscuits. The flavor compliments the aroma very well in not having too many off flavors from whats set in your palate. A hint of lemon grass can be detected with faint nuances of anise beleive it or not. Good IPA."
"Very nice drinkability and the slight carbonation and clean feel in the mouth make one want to drink a few of these bad boys."
"I was surprised to pay $2/case more at the company store than at Russo's, an aggressive beer/wine retailer in Grand Rapids. I wish Bell's would be more helpful on their label and web site about the type of hops, and the IBUs."
"D: If cold, the beer is an excellent session beer, but if warm, the spicy bittnerness will lower the drinkability."
" Bottom Line: I'd reccomend this to any pale ale fan, and to anyone who hasn't tried a pale ale yet. Ta Ta"
"Pours from the funky fish bottle to a hazy golden-orange, with off-white head and excellent lacing. Aroma is strongly hoppy, mostly floral and grass, with a hint of citrus. Flavor is much the same, with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Beer ends with a dry finish. All and all, a very enjoyable IPA."
"In my small town in northern lower MI I had few choices. A lot of Bells, which was nice cause I heard a lot about them. This one was one of the easier to drink beers when I was there. And found myself buying more of these then the other ones."
"As stated earlier the balance favours the malts too much for my liking and personal interpretation of this style. The promises of the aroma were not realized upon drinking this beer. This would be an excellent IPA to try while working on one's tolerance for bolder and hoppier beers, of which there are plenty. Definately worth a try, i was impressed by its aroma, and it may suit your fancy more than mine. Really makes me want their double IPA though, can see how it may more fully realize my ideal, only needing more ETOH and hops to round out the malt."
"12 oz. bottle. Poured a slightly cloudy, orange gold color. Moderate head. Aroma was primarily grapefruit, with an undertone of honey. Taste was almost all hops, with a mixed citrus (oranges and grapefruit flavor). Malt was in a supporting role, and didn't add a whole lot to the flavor, IMO. Medium body, with moderate to high carbonation, drying in the mouth leaving you wanting more. An excellent beer, and as I sit here and look at my glass, I wish I had bought more than 2."
"Bottle courtesy of Daalamar: Poured a light orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention. Aroma of floral hops is quiet enticing with a great semi-sweet malt base. Taste of crisp and citrus hops are well mixed with a nice solid sweet malt based. Carbonation is lively and body is about average. Overall a really good example and enjoyable take on the style thought a bit overrated in my opinion."
"Henceforth I'm going to call this beer Fishbine. Not because it tastes like fish but because even the fish on the label ain't biii-ne into the hype of the Two Hearted Ale by Bell's. Bell's makes great beer but they also make craft beers and in doing so there are always extremes. Much more brusk than the aftertaste of Oberon, this beer has a citrus bite that rivals the pungent meat of the rind. It literally is rind beer. I know that it is lauded as a summertime delicacy but it is more like drinking the broth of a lemorange peel that sat out in the sun too long and then was chilled. No goodness here."
"Drinkability: Truly sessionable despite bold flavor. The body isn't too heavy and showcases the hops without making the bitterness oppressive."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium ambe with a fluffy 2 finger head, nice longevity and lace. Nice aromas of hops mixed with a fair amount of orange. Malt aromas are present but quickly fade due to the hop aromas. Something seems off in the flavor. I think it is too unbalanced. Yes, it is supposed to heavy on the hop side but its kind of harsh. I think it just needs a bigger malt presence. The hop amounts are fine, as is their flavor, its just a weak malt presence. It is still a good and quality made beer just unbalanced IMHO. If the malts were a bit more dominate, it would make an excellent brew."
"Batch 7463 on the label - Pours a hazy orange shade with some suspended yeast particles and an epic white head that sticks around forever. Nose is ...oh man ... hops are superbly aggressive here. Citrus, piney, and ever so slightly sweet. Can they bottle this aroma and sell it in a spray like Febreze? One of the best smelling beers I've enjoyed in a long while. Palate is a hop paradise ... pine and citrus combine with an incredible sweetness and texture that almost brings a tear to the eye. This may well be the best balanced AIPA I've ever had ... could the hop/malt ratio be better? Doubt it. Mouthfeel is soft, thick, and luxurious. Medium bodied. Lingering sweetness and absolutely amazing hop tastes linger in the mouth long after each sip. Where do I begin with one ... you simply must have Bell's Two Hearted. I don't know why it's called Two Hearted and I don't know why there is a fish on the label, but I do know it's the best AIPA I've ever had the pleasure of consuming ... and one of the overall best beers made in the USA. More than recommended."
"Taste is mellower than expected and suprisingly well balanced. I'm drinking this after a DFH 90 minute, and this is so much better balanced. And smooth. The mouthfeel is moderate, but the smooth carbonation offers a bit of creamyness. This is a damn fine beer."
"Believe the hype. By far the best Bell's product I've had and an excellent IPA. Period. Worthy of my Beer HoF."
"Drinkability- Easy to quaff; great summer day beer"
"D - Very drinkable. My first Bell's brew and it is very delicious. An outstanding IPA."
"Hazy pale golden amber maybe a little light for the style, with a foamy white head. Smells of sweet pine and citrus. Taste is similar to smell with overwhelming hops dominating the flavor which is ok in my book. Mouthfeel is light with not much carbonation."
" Palate is a pleasing blend of light, slightly sweet malt and assertive, floral hops. Notes of light citrus, grass, and a fleeting hint of smoke are detectable. Body is just a little thin for the style, but more or less fine. A very drinkable IPA, one that could hold its own here on the over-hopped west coast."
"This is one delightful IPA, I'll be looking for this again when I want a smooth, flavorful beer with a dry finish that is not overpowering."
"A pantheon level brew."
"Cheers!"
"The overall effect is borderline narcotic. This is the perfect midwestern IPA. An excellent choice for anytime and/or occasion."
"This is a good drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Although I only got a single of this, I wish I have gotten a six pack of this. An excellent beer that I'm glad I tried and will try again! A must IPA beer!"
"It was kind of watery, and the carbonation a bit weak, but I'll be coming back for more Two Hearted Ale."
"Notes: Greatest of the great midwestern IPAs. Seek it out. Enjoy it."
"Two Hearted is what I measure all other IPAs against. It's everything I look for in an IPA and a beer in general. I just wish I could get it regularly where I'm at."
"Uh oh...foam is cascading out of the bottle after this one, also. I thought it was a fluke with the first one. No problem. Grab a towel and wipe it up, too. Never had that happen unless the beer had been shaken prior to opening. Oh well. Pours a slighlty hazy copper with a thick white head that leaves heavy lacing. Aroma is hoppy. Pine and citrus are dominant. The taste follows in the same direction. Very earthy with pine, citrus and some light, biscuity malts in there as well. Hops are the highlight, as expected, in this tasty brew. Medium body with nice carbonation and a dry, bitter finish."
"could drink all day if it werent so alcoholic! If you dont have it available, GET IT!"
"D: Very drinkable. Every time I have a Two Hearted Ale it makes me want another one."
"Notes: This is a hell of an IPA and as the previous review noted, also a great value. Certainly not the best, but very good and true to style."
"On-tap 5-17-07 - same as above for the most part, just better. 4.5's across the board"
"Mouthfeel of this beer is also great, medium bodied with a dry finish that leaves you begging for more. Low carbonation, just enough to playfully dance the tongue and give rise to the realization that this is a carbonated beverage. This beer is a sipper, don't try to drain this quickly, what would be the good in that? As with all great beers it needs to be appreciated. Don't gulp this one down, sit, realx and enjoy the flavor of this great IPA. Definitely worth the money, will be buying this one again. However, Stone IPA is still my default."
"Two Hearted is a beautiful deep clear gold with a tinge of rusty brown. It's got a small head that fades, and the lacing is nice. The nose is all floral hops... not too complicated here. Taste is as expected heavy hops up front (not overdone), but with a nice amount of malts to balance it out, a surprising tiny hint of pine, and finally a slightly bitter finish. Excellent combination. Mouthfeel is very good, and drinkability on this one is high. No wonder it's one of Bell's more popular brews."
"I was very impressed the first time I had this beer. It is a nice, light, summer IPA. The color is a nice clear amber, with an even head. Upon first smelling it, your nose is overwhelmed with the scent of fresh, crisp hops. And that is pretty much how it tastes, very clean and jumping with fresh hop flavor. It is not one of the strongest IPA's when it comes to hops, and that's a good thing. There is a nice balance between the malts and the bittering and finishing hops. This is an IPA you could drink all night if you wanted to, and not feel as though you've been kissing a pine tree."
"I recommend skipping this beer."
"Personally, I have never thought that an IPA could or should be balanced, but if any IPA is balanced then this is it. It has great full-spectrum bitterness akin to Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, but the way everything comes together here is just a bit more drinkable. This beer makes me feel safe."
"The beer poured a nice orangish, deep gold with a finger plus of brilliant white head. The nose was straight, simple hops, and the flavor hoppy and extremely drinkable. This is a beer I could drink all night long, again and again, with an intense hop flavor and crisp, very clean finish."
"The two hearted name is derived from the two hearted river in michigans upper peninsula."
"I had this on tap at Old Chicago. This beer had a hazy amber/straw color and more head on tap then when I had it in the bottle. The hop aroma was very fruity with only a hint of pine. Two Hearted's taste is a burst of citrus hops that left me with a strange hint of pineapple. The mouthfeel was medium in body, and I swore I could almost feel the hops swishing between my teeth (not literally). Two Hearted Ale is beer I could drink endlessly on a nice summer day."
"i found this beer very drinkable and very fruity. the appearance is a bit cloudy due to the unpasturized nature, but that did not distract orm the taste. the taste was very pleasurable and i really enjoyed the fruity/hoppy balance. i would gladly pay money for this beer again."
"Overall: A really well done IPA. I put this up there at the top of my best IPAs list. A high quality brew that offers just about everything you look for in the style."
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a slight white head that fades quickly. The smell of this beer is original, like nothing else I have encountered. Full of fruity, not so much citrus as actual fruit smells and a great deal of hops. A full character just from the smell. The taste does not disappoint. I am not an avid IPA drinker but this one is tops in my book. A full body of flavors and characters revisiting the smells. I didn't like the overpowering carbonated feel, taking away from the mouthfeel and overall drinkability. I would recommend this brew to all IPA fans, this brew is better than most IPAs. Enjoy!"
"D: Definately a highly drinkable ipa. Great smelling and tasting with a smooth mouthfeel make this an easy drinking, session ipa. Can't wait to crack the others I've got. Bell's does well in every style."
"Great mouthfeel and terrific drinkability. Hard to top this IPA."
"Drinkability - goes down easy and is delicious. Could down many of these in a session anytime, and in fact, will."
"Two Hearted Ale is a very solid, drinkable example of the American IPA style. I'm not a huge fan of hop dominant beers, but when I feel like an IPA this is the one I often find myself reaching for."
"This reminded me of a Dreadnaught light. Not too light bodied, but very easy to drink. Well done. Wish they had it in my area as it would become one in heavy rotation."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for sending me this WONDERFUL beer. Bless that man."
"D-This beer is made for beautiful days on the deck, such as this one or at cookout's with freinds and family. This would be a great session IPA, but alas, this is my only one. Gotta seek this one out again."
"The feel was much of the same; exquisite. A smoothness rarely found with an IPA. It wasn't harsh at all, but not weak. It was semi-full-bodied, but more smooth and creamy. The bittersweet hoppiness fades into a smooth creaminess then into an almost buttery aftertaste that lingers the whole sitting. I'm going out on a limb and saying this might be the top two or three most drinkable IPAs I've ever had. And this is definitely an IPA for people who can't tolerate the bitter hop assault of ""normal"" IPAs or doubles IPAs. Hats off, Bell's. This is truly a wonderfully crafted, nearly perfectly balanced beer."
"This is quite the drinkable IPA, to say the least. Balanced, in spite of the aroma, hearty without being overwhelming, creamy without being chewy... I imagine a beer could be better put together than this, but it would take a damn good effort. Extremely well done."
"This bottle came to me via parental roadtrip; I gotta admit it's an old favorite, but I'll try to review objectively. Ish. The pour is a crystal clear straw color, yellow with just a tinge of orange. Head is thick and a bit yellowish with thick lacing on the glass. Huge centennial aroma! By which I mean, hints of lemon and deep, dark pine. Taste is a centennial assault; big and orangey, lemony, again with a huge pine backup. The hop flavor tastes thick though the body is clean and crisp. Just a tinge of sweetness in the aftertaste, matched by a stiff bitterness that contributes to the ""clean"" feeling. Carbonation is actually a little low if anything - I could use a bit more fizz on the tongue to complement the stiff hop punch, but it's oh so drinkable as is. Glad I have 5 more of these."
"D - I could drink this as a regular beer any day of the week."
"12 oz bottle pours out a rich, amber color. Nice foamy white head. It left some lacing. Hop smell was present, specifically cascade hops. It also seemed to have an orange scent. The flavor was very interesting. It was slightly bitter and very hoppy. It was good. It had a fairly crisp mouthfeel and was definitely drinkable. Too bad I only bought one bottle"
"bottle code: 7245"
"This IPA jumped high up my list and is a definite buy for anyone, not just IPA fans. I plan on getting a case soon."
"overall it's a great beer, and another winner from bell's. definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a nice hoppy american ipa."
"I will definitely return to this AIPA."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, by far my favorite IPA and, in my opinion, Bell's finest and most consistent beer. a true winner here, please try this if possible."
"I am sorry about my rating, but I just had to. This is one of my favorite beers of all time. We are starting to see this on tap at more and more places in Minneapolis, and not just dank beer bars anymore, so I have been drinking more and more of it, and boy, it just keeps getting better. The way Guiness defines stout, and Sierra Nevada defines pale ale, I feel that two hearted ale defines IPA. It pours the same amber color of most PA's, with a slight head that has great retention and provides lacing to the last sip. The aroma is where you find out it is IPA, not a PA, with a complex, hoppy smell. The taste follows up on the smell, an array of hops from piney to fruity to citrusy, that all blend together, with the dry-apple flavor following shortly. This is at the top of my deserted island beers. Good for one or two, or great for the whole evening."
"Cloudy yellow with a orange hue to it. White head leaving small amounts of lacing in the glass. Pine and citrus up front with a caramel and fair amount of biscuit in the background. Citrus, pine, and a lemony finish with a nice balance of biscuity flavors noticed with each sip. Higher on the carbonation scale and a medium body makes the one pretty nice to drink."
"Pours a golden yellow, non transparent color with a fluffy white head that leave quite a bit of lacing. This doesn't look like your typical IPA. It is a little lighter. The smell, however, smells like an IPA. Sweet grapefruit hoppiness dominates the smell. Taste is also great. The hops hit up front, but are followed by a toasted malt quality and a slight amount of sweetness. Finish is bitter and refreshing. Mouthfeel is medum and a bit dry. Drinkablity is very good. I would love to have access to this beer in the west coast. Easily competes with most IPAs I have sampled to date. Very well done."
"I could easily put down a 6 pack of this stuff. Truely magnificent drinkability for an IPA, and incredibly balanced. One of my new favorite beers."
"Overall, this beer showcases the powerful hops of an American IPA well. Great example of the style and a wonderful beer."
"Wow, wow, wow. This is an outstanding brew from a great brewery. Little malt on the front, great, multi-hops on the back end and lots of grapefruit flavor. You can mall through like a 6 pack in no time. Alcohol balance is super. The best part of this bronski is the smell, classic microbrew smell. The smell makes the brew plus the taste is outstanding!! Highly recommend this beer!"
"But, like most archetypical beers, ya can't really say there is anything too special about this beer. To me, it is the benchmark of the IPA style, the beer by which all other IPAS shall be measured. It's good. But let's not get carried away singing its praises. Oh, wait, let's."
"Pours dark amber with big creamy white head, mostly lasting. Nice lacing. Big aroma, pine and grapefruit. Smells very fresh. Flavor is grapefruit, orange peel, caramel malts, with a piney, earthy dry finish. Dances on the tongue for a wonderful mouthfeel. Fantastic texture, medium body, smooth and creamy. Very easy drinking, tough to put this one down. Outstanding IPA."
"I've been drinking the hell out of this for a while, but I've been so busy enjoying it that I've had a hard time making myself review it. The bee's knees."
"I recommend for an everyday quaff if you can find it."
"All in all Two Hearted is a great beer, especially if you love hops! If you are fortunate enough to live in a portion of the country where you can get some do so!"
"12 oz bottle, pours a dark slightly hazy amber, two fingers of frothy off-white head, pretty decent retention, nice rings of lacing. Nose is a nice solid dose of piney and citric hops over a nice pale malt. Taste has a great orangy citric hoppiness that blends superbly with a smooth pale malt, slightest bit of caramel flavor, gentle piney finish with just the slightest bit of bitter aftertaste. Very nicely balanced APA, good hop taste without being overly bitter. Medium bodied with a moderate/high carbonation, this is a real easy drinking beer, an everyday APA that would be good to have aroud."
"Had two bottles at a recent party. Didn't notice if there was a time stamp. I drank these out of the bottle because of a shortage of glasses. The folks with glasses held a trablucent amber (not red) brew with a nice white head. Some metallic taste/smell overtones fade after a couple swallows. Maybe because I drank from the bottles? This is a fine hoppy beer, with a pleasant, lightly sweet, malt backbone. Did I mention hoppy? These would be those citrusy American hops. Best IPA I've had in a while."
"D- Very drinkable. One makes me want another. This will be great for out on the deck on a hot summer night. This is one to come back to again and again."
"Bottom line: Super good American IPA that I find to be one of the most drinkable in its style. Highly recommended!"
"D - As with all highly rated beers I taste, I do my best *not* to get caught up in the hoopla and be extremely objective. However, no amount of skew on objectivity can deny a beer its kudos when it is so obviously well deserving. Two Hearted Ale is a joy to look at, to smell, to drink and to savor."
"very good"
"Crisp effervescence, medium body leaning towards the fuller side, warming. Curious as to how many IBU's this ""ale"" has. A good sipping kind of beer but not a thirst quencher."
"12 ounce bottle. Poured very clear rich nut brown with red tint. excellent head that lasted forever. Superb rich malty hoppy aroma. The taste would have been a 5 but it was way too sweet and very distracting. The palate was very thick and chewy perfect for the style. Not very drinkable due to the overpowering sweetness...may be good for small snifter but real tough to finish 12 oz"
"Overall, doesn't have the malt balance of Alpha King and the hops aren't as intense, but Two Hearted does its own thing very well. Wouldn't so no to either of these fine ales."
"Pretty good pour, it golden orange. The head is about a fingers width. Smell is curious, a dash of pine followed up with orange juice. Taste is lemony, orange followed by a dash of bitter pine. The bitter is almost meek, as if trying to be inoffensive. This one manages to be very citrusy, without incorporating any grapefruit. It almost seems naked without the grapefruit. After those initial tastes, the back tastes like seltzer water. The malt doesn't really show other than to provide a bit of sweetness. In spite of that minor gripe, this is still a very enjoyable brew. Mouthfeel is near perfect, lush and creamy. If this were a local brew, I fear that it would be overshadowed by many of the premiere IPA's. Of the top of my head I can think of a couple that taste almost just like it. In any case, I did enjoy this and were it available here, I'd buy a sixer every now and then."
"Overall- very excited when I saw this on tap bt after drinking I was slighty disappointed. Just too sweet. I wish there were some citrius thrown in to help mellow the sugar. 1 was more than enough."
"Hand carried back from Royal Liquors in Kansas City, MO."
"Drinkability: An overassertive hoppiness makes this something you can't have a whole lot of."
"piney bitter hops in the taste as well with a harshly drying, bitter finish. high carbonation and a coating, oily bitterness. little to no malts in the taste. overall needs a little more balance."
"Um...wow. Pours a much clearer pour than in bottles. A nice small head with a copper body. The head dances around a bit during drinking and this beer makes love to the side of the glass and doesn't want to let go. Like the bottle, huge pine and citrus in the nose. An absolute overflow of fresh hop flavor in the mouth with just the right amount of playfulness in the mouth, not enough to overwhelm the flavors. I could drink this all day..if it didn't put me under the table first."
"Copper orange appearance, not much for a head but has a nice thick ring. Aroma of luscious orange hops, sweet and citrusy. Taste is mildly sweet, with more orange/citrus flavor and lightly spicy hops, a bit tangy. Bitterness is subdued, making it mostly a sweeter IPA, but very nice. Medium thick, good coating ability, nice light carbonation present. I would drink this all day long. Thanks Archer Liquors..."
"Appeared an orange-yellow color with an off-white colored head that was relatively thick and left behind spots of lacing. Nice white bubbles covered the surface. Aromas of hops, alcohol, and ripe fruits. Citrus and grapefruit flavors along with the hops dominated the taste with a strong bitterness that lingers the whole time. Much more like hop juice than an IPA. Thin and dry in my mouth with a citrus-dervied finish. My biggest problem with this beer was it's lack of complexity. It truly bordered on pure hops and that's not a great thing."
"David and I both really enjoyed this one. Had on tap a few times at the Fox and Hound in Beavercreek. Not quite crystal clear, pale gold in color. I think what makes this one stand out is you get two different hop impressions. Initially, the aroma brings it with strong flowery hops, with a second layer of grassy notes too, let's call it the meadow. This carries into the taste, which backs those impressions up with enough malt, and just a touch of sweetness. The finish is more of a citrusy hop taste. A strong medium body, enough carbonation, you have a very drinkable brew."
"Pours a light copper to gold color with a creamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells of light caramel mixed with the scent of mouth watering sweet floral hop goodness. Taste is at first citrusy with grassy-ness with strong bitterness that lingers on the tongue with a very slight alcohol warmth. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel. My memory of this beer was more balanced but in reviewing it today the hop bitterness was very prominent. A solid IPA from Bell's that I am sure I will drink many more of."
"Pours a light gold color, much lighter than i was expecting. Not much in the way of head or lacing either. Also very cloudy. Smell of citrus and floral. This is the most I've noticed floral in a beer that i can remember. Taste is initially bitter up front and then becomes somewhat earthy. I want to say hay or that first cutting of wet springtime grass. Very interesting beer. I don't know that i've tasted an IPA like this before. There is enough of the hop note that it fits the category but there is definately something unique about this beer. As the beer warms a bitter aftertaste becomes more noticable. Is that now a piney note coming through in the finish. What an interesting beer. I have a couple more of these and i'm looking forward to exploring this one a little bit more."
" A rock-solid IPA offering from what I can tell is a great brewery. Keep it up Larry!"
"Burnt orange in color with a half inch head. Fruity and hoppy in smell. Many tastes flow through this beer. Obiviously the hops fly through first with a bit of citrus, a dash of malt and grains, make for a balanced recipe and a smooth and drinkable India Pale Ale."
"Pours a very pale piss yellow, surprised for an IPA. Head sticks very little, very airy, not dense, but hold's its own. Aromas are lemony spruce, with a grapefruit backbone. Where's the hops???? This one is very dissapointing in that area, was hoping it could be a substitute for HopDevil or Stone, but alas, it is not. Very balanced though, malts come through in a particularly sweet way, hmm. This would go nicely with most cuisine, I'll give it that, just dissapointed in the lack of hops ugh."
"D- This beer had good quality grain and great hops that really taste like a simple top notch IPA until you start to notice nuances in flavor and aroma that are very nice."
"D- Fair, I think the problem was my expectations were a bit high upon receiving this brew. Unfortunately for me, there is a bit of a wheat ale taste to it, which for me is a huge turn off. This is mostly taken over by the hops, which are abounding in this drink. Would come highly suggested for hop loving drinkers that don't mind a little hint of wheat."
"Drinkability....off the charts. I could sip this fine brew all day long. If you are looking to try an IPA or just looking to drink a good beer anytime..you won't be dissapointed with Two Hearted."
"At 6% abv, $8.99 a six, and with this flavor, you just have to love this beer as the ultimate session beer."
"This is my old stand-by. No matter what kind of mood I'm in, Two Hearted does the trick. Pours an amber, orangish color. The smell is flowers, pine, and citrus. The taste is incredibly complex and wonderful - bitter, sweet at times, piney (?), and more. Easily one of my personal favorites."
"Pours a light shade of copper, with a dull haze. Dense head of one and a half fingers, stubborn lacing and great retention. The smell of whole hop cones are very apprent in the nose, fruity and herbal, with a hint of pine. Toasted amber malt and a slight ester begin the flavor, and a citrus/pine alpha-oil hop aftertaste balances the taste without drying it out. Light carbonation and medium body allow an uncommonly smooth mouthfeel for a I.P.A.; bitter without becoming harsh. Finishes with residual light caramel and a pleasent hop bite, an excellent drinkability."
"Partaken of at Union Jack's in Boyertown. Presented as an apricot colored beverage with moderate puffy head. The smell can only be described as a superb mixture of hops and fruit. Scents of peaches, apricots, and tangerines dominate, carressed by a subtle hoppiness. Taste is extraordinary, with the fruitiness in the foreground, but mellowed by a distinct hop essence. What an absolutely magnificient combination. Drinkability is absolutely perfect. My first beer from Bell's, and if this is an example of their brewing ability, I will definitely search more out. Excellent"
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Drinkability is insane. It's hard to make this last, it just keeps going down, heavenly sip after sip. Again, I wish I lived within distro range of this one so I could get my hands on it regularly. Next summer, I'm bringing back a case!"
"DI tried this based on the recommendations of other BAs and it did not disappoint. This is a great IPA. Could drink several without any problem. Believe the hype!"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber orange, thick off white heads forms, nice lacing and amazing retention. Smell is piney, with citrus, and caramel/toffee. Taste is superbly balanced, tons of piney and citrus hops up front, then into a caramel/toffee, toasty middle, piney bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, super smooth. At first I thought this was overrated but I've had it a few times it isn't at all, world class IPA."
"Drinkability - I'd call this experiment a success. I let this warm up to maybe 55 degrees before tasting, I wonder if this is one to have a little colder and maybe bottle up some of that soda water taste. It doesn't age all that well but it keeps great. 4.0"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle marked batch 7168 into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden hued orange color with a half finger white foamy head that diminished slowly to light white sticky lacing. Aroma is rich of floral hops, nicely accented by sweet malt pairings. Taste is absolutely incredible, excellent balance between hops and malt, yet far more complex, it's like nothing I've tasted before. At first taste, this IPA tarts off with a quick hoppy bite that is rich in citrus and floral notes, before giving way to a softer, caramelly sweet maltiness that leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slick on the tongue, coats the mouth with a nice light oily feeling. Very, very drinkable, I think I may have a new favorite session beer, I will seek out more of this beer very soon."
"Verdict- Without a doubt, this is the best IPA I've had. Spicy, full, complex and delicious."
"WOW!"
"I like this beer a lot, it's one of my favorite IPAs."
"This beer is fantastic. It is my personal benchmark for what an IPA should taste like. My only complaint is that it is significantly better when fresh which takes out any chance of aging this beer. Overall this beer is outstanding."
"Let me say first that I love this beer. It is floral and spicy and very aromatic. But as other reviewers may have pointed out, it is rather unbalanced. Some may call this ""hop juice"" for its aggressive hop flavor and aroma. Pours a rich golden color, brighter than most amber colored ales. Nice frothy head that turns quickly into a white ring leaving lacing down the glass. Aroma is rough hewn and woody. Flavor is hoppy,less malty, with hints of citrus and apple. Mouthfeel is only average since the ultra high hop flavor makes this dry and rough at times."
"This is my first Bell's beer. The number on the bottle is 7139. The beer is a cloudy amber color. The head was minimal. The smell is sweet. The taste is verry hoppy. Sweet notes linger for a while. Bitter at first with a sweet aftertaste. The beer leaves a refreshing coolness in the mouthfeel. The drinkability is high but deffinatly not a session beer. I would drink it again if it were available in my area. I would love to have a cask version of this sometime."
"Overall, Two Hearted Ale is an outstanding IPA; it's insanely redrinkable. I'd drink this beer all the time if it was available anywhere near me."
"Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a world-class IPA, period. In fact, I'm considering an e-mail assault on the talented Mr. Bell until he decides to extend his distribution area this far west. If I had this fine ale within easy reach, it would have a permanent place in my beer fridge. With regular consumption, say a sixer every week, I'd probably begin to tire of it in... oh, about 2035."
"12 oz bottle Pours a cloudy gold with a cramy white head. Mostly lastingand good lacing. Aromas are hoppy with touches of flowers, citrus, and pine. Taste is medium bodied with a nice consistancy and carbonation. Has a good bitter/alcohol finish which lasts well. A very decent IPA as expected from Bells."
"Overall: A great IPA that's in the top handful of American examples. Always a treat."
"A super solid IPA experience here. Very tasty but after one your taste buds are a bit hop saturated so that it would be a waste of good beer to drink this just to get drunk."
"Foggy gold with a large white head that falls to a sturdy table. Nose is all pine sap and lemon rind. Taste is all perfumey hops with some raw bitter oils and a lemony after taste. There is no balance here, this is a hop heads brew all the way. Mouthfeel is medium to full, outstanding finish. Decent drinakbility for such a hoppy beer. A fine IPA."
"This is a great version of an American IPA. I could drink this every day. This beer definitely deserves the hype that it gets."
"Drinkability: This is practically everything I want in an IPA. I am not 100% sure but I think Two Hearted Ale was the first craft brewed beer I ever drank. I loved it then and still love it."
"A good beer to finish off a session of Wheat beers because of the contrast. Not the biggest of Hoppers but an great representation escpecially in the midwest where it is hard to find big IPA's."
"Balanced, rich and simply wonderful."
"This is an excellent beer. Definitely the first to disappear from the mixed case I picked up the other day. Beautiful orange tone to this one, and a huge, solid, rocky head that maintains it's shape for a while and then fades to a still substantial foam that lasts til the final sip. Mmmm. In terms of smell and taste, this is a perfectly balanced beer, yet robust in both the malt and hop areas. I generally don't draw comparisons between beers, but I like this just about as much as the Alesmith Yulesmith, which I couldn't help but be reminded of while drinking this beer. They both have that great almost vanilla ice cream sweet malt character backing up a load of hops. Very resinous and oily hops in the nose, and also on the palate, but moving towards a more citrusy orange peel and spice bouquet. Also, I could be imagining this but I'm detecting either some light spicing, or just little complexities such as clove and nutmeg. Really nice. This is pretty much a medium bodied beer but it has a great slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel, super creamy and smooth. I know this is tough or nearly impossible to find on the east coast, but if you find some on your travels definitely pick it up, it's one of the best IPAs I've had. And you have to love any beer that has a generic looking wildlife photo on it, a la Schmidt's."
" A great ipa, this would be a regular in my fridg. if it were available locally to me."
"A slightly couldy golden, with a fluffy head that gently receeded and left a hearty lace. Strong piney and floral hops greet the nose, crisp and sharp. My heavens though, it is a nice beer. Full bodied floral hops, not watery at all, just all hops, all the time. I could drink this all afternoon, except for that pesky 6%. An outstanding IPA, the best 'floral hops' IPA I have tasted."
"I was looking forward to giving this a sample, grabbed one on my last trip out to Minnesota. It poured a hazy, golden-to-straw color with a big beaded bleach white head that is quite substantial and leaves a good, clinging lace. The floral hop bouquet is...lovely! Its almost like potpourri, quite an accomplishment. The body is best described as medium with a mouthfeel that's full of a good juicy malt character. The hop character in the beer itself is a pleasant combo of citrus and floral notes, really the perfect marriage. Also adding to the intrigue is the complex sugary balance, which is outstanding. It finishes with a little lemony pucker but still clings to the rose-like passiveness. An outstanding IPA, best I've had in a while!"
"Nice beer, Bells! Its not too heavy, but delicious and easy to drink!"
"Relatively drinkable beer for an IPA"
"I love you my friend."
" Strong taste, but dry and clean. Fruity but not sweet. Better than the other Bells. What the heck is lacing and who cares?"
"Cheers"
"Enjoy."
"Exemplary in every way."
"A nice copper-orange color with a wispy white head. The smell is enormously hoppy. Loads of citrus (zest), rose petals, pine, and floral flavor with a hoppy dry finish. Nice full mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"The taste was a lively blend of hops and malt. a real heart warmer. Compared to the other IPAs I have had, the hops are more subdued. It was very enjoyable - I feel like I drank a good bitter. I would drink this again - in a heartbeat. - no pun intended"
"bitterness isn't the focus here, which is nice. i'm supposed to taste what's going on instead of walk away with a numb tongue"
"Hazy light copper color with a thick fizy head. The aroma is mostly hops, some piney, some citrusy, with a hint of biscuit. The taste doesn't reveal as much hoppiness as expected from the smell, but it does linger into the aftertaste. Nice malt structure, but a little more balanced that I would have guessed. It's well carbonated, with a slightly dry finish. I've had better American IPAs, but this is a pretty good offering."
"This has to be one of the top five IPA's in the country. Smooth, delicious, very well balanced, with a great hop character. Awesome in every way. Can't detect alcohol, even as it warms. Highly recommended."
"don't know if i could session this, but two or three would go down quite nicely."
"Pours aa hazy orange in color with a nice white foamy head. Citrusy aroma of grapefruit and pine. Full-bodied mouthfeel. First taste matches what was alluded to in the nose. Juicy hop bitterness strikes the tongue. Flavors of grapefruit, apricot and citrus explode on the palate. Malt backbone layers the hop bitterness to near perfection. The bitterness of the hops and the supporting malt flavor merge just before the long lingering piney finish. The finish is a tad dry and begs you to take another sip. Amazing IPA. I could drink this all night long."
"overall, a very drinkable beer with a strong hop character, one of my favorites year round"
"Drinkability: A superb IPA in my opinion. The hops are obviously there, but it has some unique and quite pleasing aspects to it as well. Nice job, Bell's."
"This is a no-nonsense solid American IPA. The pour and look were not exceptional but nice to look at. The smell was nicer as to be expected for the style. The taste is a notch above full of citrus, grapefruit, pine - even some subtle honey. Long dry hop bitter aftertaste add to the pleasure of drinking this top notch IPA. Can't say I wanted to drink another one right away but I'm glad dirtylou reminded me about this one."
"One of the best beers I've ever tried, no doubt about it. A hophead's fantasy, plain and simple."
"Wow, this is one great brew. I think even people who aren't into IPAs would probably find this one very palatable. I will definitely work this into the regular rotation. If you can find it, make the purchase."
"I was in love from the second this beer reached the inside of my mouth. The hoppy flavor gave me a real kick without being overpowering. Afer swallowing a gulp the carbonation stays a while to dance on my tongue. This beer was refreshing and full-bodied at the same time. Drinkability is dangerousely high for a beer of this strength. A great offering from Bell's and one of my favorite two beers that they make. This also stood up very well to a spicy chicken pita that I ate for dinner. All and all a great beer. If you're a hophead it is a must-have."
"Oh two hearted, it has been too long. I have become so engrossed in all these other beers that I almost forgot about you! This very fresh 6 pack hit the spot"
"Drinkability is very good, a very good IPA from Bells."
"One of the top IPA's without a doubt. Cheers to my fellow hop heads and the folks in Kalamazoo."
"i have been waiting awhile to try this monster. i've heard such great things about it. i am a bit dissapointed because my first look/smell/taste of this beer reminds me of so many others, and it just rides the same plane as so many other american i.p.a.'s. (three floyds, etc.) yes it is a hop monster. yes it is good, but so are so many others and they taste alot alike. so it is good, but it has some stiff competition so in the end my overall review will show it. what the hell? it's an awsome beer and you should try it and judge it yourself. cheers!"
"-UF"
"Update: So young, so naive...This has become my hop-craving stand-by. So expertly crafted and so good at what it does and just sublime on cask. This. is. beer."
"Pretty decent head and nice lacing. The beer is brownish-gold and there is sediment floating about, I guess I should have poured more carefully. There is a somewhat oxidized smell with some citrus and floral hops. Tastes like it smells but with a nice grapefruit sort of bitterness in the finish. I would really like to grab some of this fresh as even an aged example is very tasty."
"Probably my favorite IPA. Pale amber with a huge white head and plenty of carbonation. Smell of grapefruit and pine from the centennial hops, sweet malt still comes through. Tastes like grapefruit cotton candy--so sweet and fruity--not from the malt, though, which is underplayed. Mouthfeel is full with a sweet but not too lingering aftertaste. I could (and have) drink these all night."
"Edit: Bumped up appearance from 3.5 to 4.5. This is a beautiful beer - the bottle I reviewed must have been too cold or not very fresh."
"The legend...at least in the midwest. Copper amber in color with a nice yeasty haze and everlasting white head. A floral hop aroma hits the nose in waves, followed by a light citrus hop and nice toasted malt background. Flavor is a solid balance of caramel malt, toasted malt, floral hops & bitterness, and fruity yeast. Nice smooth mouthfeel, not cloying but nicely sweet and lingering. A solid IPA deserving of its reputation."
"a big thanks to warriorsoul for giving me a couple of these yesterday, never even spoken to him before. truely a Beer Advocate among beer advocates."
"On a more positive note, I find this beer quite as enjoyable in summer as I do in winter and vice versa."
"Drinkability - As great as both the flavor and aroma of this beer is, after a while it's like sticking your head in a bouquet of flowers, eventually you'll want some fresh air. Until then though, this beer is just amazing. *Many* thanks to Lrrr for opening my eyes to the world of good hops."
"Taste is exceptional. Slightly bubbly in the mouth and quite nice. Citrus and hops on the palate. Extremely clean. Easily a beer I'd buy a lot of if it were available in Nebraska. Will be seeking out more in the future."
"Notes: This is my beer. I love it. A world-class American Classic. The best example of Craft Brewing in the United States."
"Really nice IPA that I wish I had more of."
"This is a good IPA, but not a great IPA. Perhaps I was expecting a bit more from this, but it seems that Bell's weakened it up to get it selling a bit better. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be getting it again."
"overall: very nice ipa. i hate when the only thing that really hurts a beer is it's appearance. the aroma makes up for it however. highly recommended."
"I'm just enjoying IPAs more and more these days. Two Hearted Ale is another fine example of Bell's offerings. Rich and complex, with enough alcohol strength that this cannot be session beer. Great foam head and carbonation, nice hop character. Not my favorite IPA, but will definitely purchase this one if I'm back in the Midwest."
"Pours hazy light orange with a very fluffy, rocky head which never completely goes away and clumps down the glass. Smells of piny, floral, citrusy hops with a very slight funkiness to it. I like it. First up there's very soft bready malt then an incredibly full, round, lush(but not at all aggressive) orangy pine hop flavor takes over my mouth. Bready malts and a nice medium creamy mouthfeel support it throughout. An interplay of spicy hops and pale toasted malts linger on in the finish. This is really terrific. Such a round, full, yet subtle flavor. Drinkable to the end. Best IPA i've had yet; what it lacks in aggression is made up with its cunning subtlety. Sadly I only have one more bottle."
"Two Hearted Ale has fine balance all the way through. In the aroma, the Centennial hops and sweet malt intertwine great. The bitterness is kept in check with a good malt back bone. It poured a hazy yellow-orange and a small off white head. The medium body makes this beer a staple beer in most households."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a hazy golden color with a large off-white head. Piney hop aroma. Juicy hop flavor. The hops are very strong and give this beer flavors of grapefruit, pine, and flowers. The finish is very spicy and bitter. Malt flavor comes through a bit, but is really dominated by the hops. Any hop fan will love this beer."
"Spectacular brew! Makes me happy to live in Michigan!"
"This IPA is perfect. The most citrusy and well-placed malt profile I've ever had the pleasure to experience in an IPA. The hops are oily, fresh and uplifting - not at all husky or raw. Very smooth and graceful, but can throw the gloves off if needed. A soon-to-be Michigan legend. I vote this to be our state beer. A must try."
"Once again a great job by the folks at Kalamazoo brewing. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Big foamy head! No!!! Don't overflow. No, no, no, no. Phew, the pour was fine. Brownish orange in color, like clay-dirtied water. Some sediment floating around in there. Nose is full of light hops, but... Wow! Are they ever hidden once I tasted. Last time I homebrewed I had some extra whole hops and threw some in my mouth. Taste just like that. Very green and rich and vibrant and earthy. Feels like I am hiking in oregon again. Great balance with the malts too. Just enough sweetness to not allow the bitters to be overpowering. Just little bits of citrus rinds too. Do they also cask condition this ale? I wish, I surely wish... Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice and dry finish. Actually drank it just slightly chilled and it tasted absolutely awesome."
"The basic consensus of our little group was mixed-- I thought it was pretty decent, but nothing I would seek out, again. Most of the others thought it was far too bitter. Of course they aren't much in the way of APA or IPA fans."
"At 6%, this makes for a nice session beer. Its flavors will provide endless delights, yet will never overwhelm you as you drink glass after glass. Two hearts aren't enough to contain the love I feel for this beer."
"Booya!"
"Pale golden yellow, nice, long-lasting eggshell head, very good lacing. Smell and taste are very hoppy: cirtusy, zesty, perfumey, herbally. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy. I ate this with some spicy dirty rice and it complemented it great. Hops still aren't really my thing, but even so, this is a pretty tasty beer; I can only imagine that if you like hops as much as some people here, this beer could be your constant companion."
"My Bell's Two Hearted Ale was bottled on July 21, 2005 .. and it shows! As I pour this golden brew into a straight-sided pint glass, I can't help but notice the massive hop aroma; a pine forest full of aroma, accented by a little citrus. the carbonation seems good and the beer displays a good head of foam that settles to thin layer, leaving lacing down the sides of my glass. Love that hop aroma! As a homebrewer, I'm guessing that Bell's added a lot of Centennial hops late or after the boil. After smelling hops, I get to taste 'em and the resiny hop flavor nearly overcomes the presence of some good honey-ish malt and slightly toasted malt flavors. All of this leads to a big bitter finish. Perhaps not the most complex IPA, but when consumed this fresh this beer is a joyous hop explosion!"
"Very, very enjoyable. I think I'm going to get used to having this readily available to me now that I'm in Chicago..."
"Mouthfeel is relatively full with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is a highlight of this brew. Could easily be a fishin' beer any time of year, during hot weather to keep you cool or during the winter to liven the tastebuds while trying not to freeze."
"Thanks to Dertbert for the bottle(s). You da man."
"The body is medium to full with a crisp carbonation. Another great beer from Bell's. Make sure to check the freshness of your sample via Bell's Batch # lookup on their website, lest ye be disappointed in your old beer such as I was the first time I tried it."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a tasty looking foamy peach-colored head, lots of suspended yeast, and some cool looking cascading carbonation. Super sweet and fruity hop aroma, can't wait. Damn, this doesn't disappoint, either. A tasty, sweet, doughy maltiness is present but is beaten severely by the copious hops. Highly herbal and lemony, the bitterness is matched by a good measure of sweetness. As the glass empties, a serious coating of lace is left cemented to the inside. The finish is dry and bitter, but not at all unpleasant. I've not usually been much of a hop head, but this was delicious and amazingly drinkable. None of the wack aftertaste and mouthfeel I've experienced with some APAs and IPAs. Easily my favorite IPA yet."
"Pours a hazy, lazy orange with a thick head that dissipates and leaves lacing on the glass. Lacing and I haven't even taken a sip. Awesome. Aroma is overly citrusy with a noseful of hops. A soft aroma much like sticking your nose into a bag of Centennials.Yummy and floral Taste is softly citrus with a pine/wood finish that leaves that distinct hop bitterness on the palate. Lingers Lingers. Excellent full carbonation. I really could make this a session ale. Drinkability is hight. I've gotten these on trades and via friends, so I have a high reviewing expectation and it doesn't disappoint."
"Let me begin by saying that this beer has moved into my top three I.P.A.'s of all time. From first to last sip, it is phenominal. Starts off pouring a hazy-orange nectar, with a full-sized head. Bubbles lace the concoction from bottom to top, actively flowing through the glass. The smell is dominated by citrus aromas, along with a slight floral hint. Citrus again is most prominent in the overall taste, along with a notable malty kick. This is not the world's hoppiest I.P.A., but does have a bit of a bite to it. The best way to describe it is smooth to the extreme. In mouthfeel, it is full, but not overly heavy. Its carbonation remains throughout and the citrus flavors that come along with initial sips hold well throughout. There is a slight bitterness at the end of each quaff, adding to its appeal. Overall, I would say that this is an excellent beer, whose complexity and smoothness make it one to experience regularly."
"Edit 2/22/09: Over the years I have come to love the the taste and aroma of this beer, but hate the after effects. This beer more than any other I have ever drank leads to a very bad hangover. I mean I can't drink more than one without having a terrible headache all day long the day after."
"Taste is dominated by intense floral and citrusy hops. There's some light pale malt crispness in there but this brew is all about the hops. And while the beer may be unbalanced the hops flavors are nicely balanced with each other. Bitter and sweet citrus intertwined. Long lingering bitter aftertaste and crisp. Taste leaves you craving more. Good stuff."
"[Many, many thanks to TikkiGodxxx for shipping this out West - I'm now officially hooked on trades!]"
"Ok, the bottle I had was probably bad and I drink this beer basically twice a week minimum. Great beer all around and one of my favorite IPA's. So juicy and citric with a good balance hoppiness. Dry flavors mix with the malts so well and the intense citric hoppiness is great. Super drinkable IPA. Hops are amazing in this beer. On tap is better than bottle imo but cask is the ultimate best."
"Lots of hops, but not too much to keep me from ordering more."
"Pours a cloudy orangish-yellow color with a thick, frothy white head that retains well, a spectacular looking beer. Aroma is grapefruit, lemon, floral and grassy hops smells, with a light, bready malt background...quite appealing. The taste is equally impressive, a moderate hop bomb thats as balanced as can be expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine oil, lemon rind and freshly cut grass makeup the hops side, with a nice, dry bread malt flavor that balances the brew very well. The mouhfeel is lusciously creamy with a crisp carbonated bite, the finish is dry, bitter and extremely refreshing. The drinkability is quite high, and i wish i had a few more. Another excellent offering from Bell's, they're becoming one of my favorites...too bad they arent available in my state."
"One of my favorite beers from one of the mid-west's best breweries."
"A solid beer that should be a main-stay of any MI local drinkers rotation. It pours an apricot color with a white head that leaves me some lacing. The smell is of strong hops with high AA and enough flavor to back them up. It has a nice malty base with sweet caramel flavors to build upon all the different hop flavor that come through. A deep bittering that yeilds to soft floral and citrus tones. The finish is a little over sweet."
"This is a beer that brings back my will to live when I get home from a bad day at work."
"Murky golden amber colour, topped by a half-inch slightly rocky, white head that shows good retention and some lacing. Definitely unfiltered, with small particulates in suspension, but clears up considerably as it warms. Hop aroma was evident as soon as I opened the bottle, a nice mix of citrus and spice. Mild malty nose as well, but this is only evident after it's been in the glass for a while. Malt sweetness to start, quickly followed by piney bitterness. Hop flavours (citrus and spice) show up part way through. The finish is quite long, dry and bitter, with more of a sharp orange peel flavour. High carbonation with a medium body and a bit of creaminess. Also just a bit of alcohol warming after it's swallowed, mostly after it warms a bit."
"Finger licking good!"
"poured a cloudy golden with off white head, with some lacing. aroma, grapefruit, yeast, lemon, orange, hops, pine. flavor, orange, hops, supriseingly the grapefruit was weak compared to the aroma, floral. bells does it for me again. a good beer will buy again"
"Two Hearted Ale is an outstanding west cost IPA. (it just comes from Michigan) This is a showcase for hops. If you are a hophead, you must give this a try. If you aren't, it is still worth a taste. (it may suprise you)"
"I'm not a huge hop head and this is a fairly hoppy beer but one that I could easily drink in a session. I am glad I decided to add this one to my mixed sixer."
"Clear and slightly dark gold in colour, this beer has a fantastic spicy citrus aroma with a bit of a grassy note creeping in as well. It's a medium strengh bitterness for an IPA. It's not quite as malty or heavy bodied as other beers of this style that I've had, but that works just fine for me. Drying and drinkable, and deceptive in its strength."
"Nose is quiet exceptional and it's just like hanging your nose in a bag( of very fine) hop. Further hardly anything noticeable but hey as fresh as a beer can get! Taste is almost identicly, hops, hops & more hops. Could have litle more body but hey I'm fine with just hops! Mouthfeel is off course also incredible and hey I could drink this all night long!"
"mouthfeel: a big beer here. smooth going down but thicker and denser in my stomach. a quick beer to fill me up, postponing the cooking of my dinner by an hour or so. couldn't have more than 2 in a sitting.. wouldn't want to though, this IPA is made to savour."
"Fun beer here. Pours a nice bronze color with a wonderfully distinct almost yellow colored head. The foamy layer suddenly dissipates, leaving strong lacings throughout the session. The nose is strong of hops paired with the fruity scents of oranges and mangoes. The taste is excellent. The flowery and orange tastes go quite well with what must be nearly the perfect amount of bitter hops. There is an aftertaste that reminds me of orange peels that almost lasts forever. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer, although it seemed to taste quite different than IPA's I've had in the past. This one is interesting and definitly worth a try."
"It's truly in a league of it's own."
"The color is a dulled creamy orange with a miniscule head. Noticeable, but not uber-thick lacing of the glass. Toned down in the smell department from the bottle. Hoppy? Heck yeah. But not in the way I remember my bottled version. Citrus and floral hops are noted. Sugary sweetness in there as well. Fantastic flavor. The cask-conditioning makes for a silky smooth taste profile. Grapefruit detected, along with ripe fruit notes. Smooth finish. Not as pronounced hop bite as other versions. Here's a beer I could be happy with every day."
"Overall a solid IPA, but nothing exceptional to me"
"Sure, it's a dry hopped Oberon, but it tastes amazing. This is one of the best non-West Coast hoppy beers out there. It pours a orangish hue with lots of head and plenty of lacing. The aroma lets you know what you are getting into. The hops dominate with a wheaty base. My only complaint is that this hop profile is awfully straight forward. Two hearted has always seemed like a homebrew gone terribly well. For a hop fix you can drink all night, this can't be beat."
"This was a damn good IPA, with a strong enough malt presence to keep the hops in check. Exceptionally crafted and highly drinkable. Toss me another feloniousmonk, thanks for the bottle!"
"The beer is a cloudy yellow probably due to the fine layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle, and moreover due to Bell's unfiltered nature. The head has an initial whipped cream-like appearance on first pour, then forms an everlasting wispy cloud-like patch on the top of the beer with lacing on the sides of my imperial pint glass. Even more noticeable is this beer's candy-like smell with some sort of strange interplay between the malts and the wonderfully smelling floral hops. Smells more like a gumball to me than Gumballhead! Taste is where it comes together in an interesting almost butterscotch candy sweetness (diacetyl alchohol) washed back with those bitter hops! I'm not sure if this is one of the great before or after dinner beers. Despite it's paler appearance this is one rich and filling beer at 6.0% abv. Mouthfeel is about where a beer like this should be, perhaps a tad thin. Pretty dang drinkable and those hop burps are great!"
"Good stuff. I want more!"
"One of the best IPA's,reminiscent of Smutty IPA."
"Another fine Bells beer, I've had eight and have enjoyed them all."
"Overall, really incredible. The best of the American style IPA's that I've had. Anybody who's had a bad one must have been victim to Bell's occasional bottling QC problems (or bad storage). Really, on tap, this is magnificent."
"Drinkability- This along with Stone IPA, are among the best balanced IPA's I have had. This would be an excellent choice for a session beer if you aren't looking for a hop bomb."
"Great IPA, one of the best you'll ever find. Pours an orangish amber with a nice 1"" head that settles to about 1/4"" and stays put. Smell is quite hoppy, though not as floral as I tend to like. Also has a bit of a pine scent. Taste is incredible... so smooth yet so hoppy. A very quenching beer, would go great with any number of foods. Stone IPA is still my favorite, but this is one of the best."
"A clean golden colored beer. Has a big fluffy bright white head, that leaves some nice lace.The aroma is very hoppy, citrusy (serious grapefuit character) with a hint of malt sweetness in the background. There is a sweetness to the hoppiness in the strat of the taste. Followed by a smoothing out with a gentle malt push in the middle. All finishes clean and well balanced."
"Very enjoyable. I'd drink another"
"This beer, while interesting, is one-dimensional, with overpowering hop bitterness from beginning to end. Ultimately, I think that it lacks the balance of some of other highly rated American IPAs like Masala Mama or HopDevil. Interesting, but not an everyday beer for me."
"This is a beer to cherish and savor slowly. Every sip is an excuse to inhale the insanely wonderful aroma and to roll this heavenly ale around your tongue. I can't see how this beer could get better. Don't listen to the haters... they're just blinded by the light."
"The spicy hop and bright effervescence hit hard and heavy at the front, then gives way to honey and cherry sweetness with a touch of vanilla. The sweetness fades as the hops come back, this time piney, and linger on the palate as long as I would let them. I paired this with some strongly spicy jambalaya, and it held its own. Its quite a strongly hopped beer, but has a terrific hop/malt balance. Got this on a keep the glass special, and Im happy to keep a memory of this great IPA."
"Dont know about this one. Pour produced a hazy amber orange, which was good. But there was this suspended cloud of yeast (?) floating around in the glass  nasty looking ! Aroma was OK, the citrus was nice, but the flora was too much for me. Flora also came across to strong in the flavor  citrus and hops were powerful and expected. Dont really like fruit in my beer, not that flower power. May need to get another bottle or 2 of Two Hearted, and some other IPAs, for further review."
"Slàinte!"
"Yow. This one caught me off-guard with its uniqueness. Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a steady stream of tiny bubbles journeying upward toward a creamy, small but mighty head. Smells like a barrel of fresh hop flowers - seriously. It's maybe the most floral smelling beer I've ever had. The smell was so floral, it actually caused a sensory flashback to my days of homebrewing. Wicked. While still mostly floral, as it sat for a bit, a sweet apricot smell also began to emerge as well. Phew. Taste was as expected but somehow less severe than its aroma forecast: Way spicy up front, coupled with some sweet flavors that sit back and let the hops take charge but still keep them in some sort of balance. Can't put my finger on the sweet flavors but thankfully they're there. Maybe it's a kiss of honeysuckle. Finish is of sour lemon and then a puckering, bitter finish that forces another sip almost immediately after swallowing. If you let the bitterness sit in your mouth, it overtakes it and lasts and lasts and lasts, revealing some piney flavors late in the taste. For the first time in my life, I can't honestly say the hop burps sent a rush of tears into my eyes. Mouth is a creamy medium-bodied and chock full o' tightly knit, miniscule bubbles... a blanket of effervescence. This stuff is obviously one for the hop heads yet still completely embracable by someone like myself that requires some sort of balance. Why did I only buy one?!"
"Slainte"
"Not a lot of complexity, but nevertheless very enjoyable. A good, solid IPA."
"After seeing them take their stouts to the next level (with Expedition), I would absolutely love to see a double IPA from Bell's."
"Pours a hazy gold with a two finger head that sticks around for the duration. First impression is spicy hops with citrus tones. Second pull is more complex, revealing an earthy, yeasty finish that balances the hops well and is more prevalant as the beer warms. Pretty highly carbonated. A very good session beer that is better on tap if you can get it."
"I could definitely make a session out of this beer....thanks again to onecrazymofo for the chance to try this very exceptional offering."
"I still wouldn't put this beer on the Best of BA. There are at least a dozen others that should be rated above this average, boring pale ale. I like IPA's, NO, I really like IPAs and have sampled enough to know that TH would rank at the very bottom of that list. It's not terrible but it's not good either. Let me put it this way, it's not even close to a Finest Kind IPA.."
"This poured from a bottle to a chalice a slightly hazy copper color with a decent cream colored head and a fair bit of lace down the side of the glass. The nose has some hop flower up front, with pine hints, perhaps some grass and light citrus. The flavor has sharp citrus, grapefruit with a remarkable hop bitterness. Malt sweetness comes later with just a hint of caramel. Less of the velvety mouth feel Ive come to love with Bell's, very drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a nice fluffy off white head, some nice lacing. Smell hops as soon as I pop the cap floral and herbal mixture of hops, slightly different then the citrus and pine of most IPA's, with some biscuit malt in the background. Taste is hops herbal spicy mixture nice flavors mingle with biscuity malt, almost taste like some pepper present nice light clean tasting little IPA, lightly bitter after taste but no real pine resin at all. Mouthfeel is a little light but makes this brew go down that much quicker. Drinkability is good a different likeable IPA would be wonderful in the summer for a great sessions brew"
"Drinkability and Overall: I'm glad I picked up a 6'er of this stuff. Could kill it tonight without a problem. This is very hoppy beer, that takes a hop-head too truly enjoy and appreciate. A great beer worth trying."
"Bonus- I called the brewery to ask about date codes. They do not date code just using sequential batch numbers. Anyway, John there was very good to talk to. This is what I like about craft brewers."
"Many, many thanks to Feloniousmonk for this bottle!"
"This beer was a pleasant surprise. I can't compare it to anything else. Possibly worth moving to Michigan to have access to. Try it if you can."
"Absolutely astounding to taste. Mouthfeel is medium with middle-of-the-road carbonation. The sting of tiny bubbles jumping off my tongue was a nice play with the hop bitter. While many IPAs hit with bitter and finish with a citrus and faint malt, this beer is incredibly well blended. As the hop bitter strikes, it is accompanied by grapefruit and smooth enticing barley sweet. I taste lighter fruits in the background. Apricot? Certainly some pear. As a homebrewer, I know the difference between fresh and aged beers. This beer was fresh and delicious. A+. I'll be stopping in every trip home for another. If you are anywhere near Bell's brewery, you have *got* to stop in for pint (or three)."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color with 3 fingers of head that don't seem to want to fall. The nose is a nice grapefruit with a bit of caramel sweetness to balance the hops. Smells really good to me. The flavor is actually a bit peppery and citriusy. I think the peppery is from the hop as well as is the citrus. The malt is in there, but the hop dominates so that the caramel just seems to fade into the back. Damn I do like this beer. One of the better IPA's I've had in a while. The feel is just a shade below moderate, a touch thin for my liking, but its not thin. Overall this beer is easy drinking and much better than I remember from when I was not a seasoned beer drinker. Damn I like it."
"This may be the perfect beer. Okay, maybe not, but it may be the perfect AIPA."
"Body is between medium and large with a juicey, slick mouthfeel and soft, creamy texture. Very good all the way around!"
"These don't last long in my fridge!"
"Mouthfeel is a good...nice and creamy body with plenty of carbonation..maybe even a little too much. Drinkability is very good here as well. An easy drinking IPA that would be great for session. Hoppy burps are good :-). If you love hops and you've yet to try this one....what are you waiting for??"
"Overall, an excellent IPA. A little more subdued than I expected, but very drinkable."
"Confession that this is one of my favorite beers at the moment. It's very easy to drink and a standby when I get a craving for hops."
"Drinkablity is big, too, and the character is really key. This was an excellent pint, a big difference, though, blast me down if you must, if prefer the CO2 version. I like that hop attack...but there's something to be said for both...hope to have it again at some other occasion in my lifetime!"
"This is an excellent IPA and it is clear why it is a favorite of the hopheads out there. It is now my third Bells beer and I haven’t been disappointed with any. It actually caused me to go on their website to see where they are found. Now that I know they are available in PA, my work trips there next month will have new meaning. This is a devilishly good session beer, of which I need more…"
"Next time I'll just go for the regular bell's two hearted and skip the cask-conditioned stuff."
" Its a pretty powerful beer so I usually don't try to drink to many of them in a sitting without changing it up. It's definately a treat of a beer none the less. A good beer from a good Brewing Co. Very popular in my neck of the woods."
"Golden yellow color in the glass with a nice big ol' layer of medium bubbles on top. Hops smell takes over the immediate area as soon as its poured. The flavor is a real hop mix. It starts off with a bit of mild/sweet hops and malts then quickly turns to a sharp bitter in the same taste. I'd guess that is why its a Two Hearted Ale. It sweet-talks you, then stabs you with hops."
"I love IPA and have heard a good deal about this brew. It appeared lighter in color than I imagined, but a nice hazy dull organge color. I've had IPA's that have much more aroma than 2 Hearted Ale. I was a little disappointed with the aroma. There is aroma but my expectations were much higher. (I'm a hop head) After being a little disappointed with the aroma, the taste made up for my disappointment. A very good hop bitterness, more than most IPA's. The hop bitterness jumps out at you, making this a hop lovers delight. It tastes a little thicker (more mouthfeel) than alot of the other IPA's. A good class beer, have two before you drink something of lesser value."
"The flavor is roasty and malty. Some sweetness but very little hoppy bitterness. The floral accents and tanginess of the hops come through beautifully, but this is not an over-hopped beer that kicks you in the mouth with bitterness. Very subtle and sweet."
"After a bad experience with their Cherry Stout I had to try something else a little more redeeming. This poured out a slightly murky golden orange with a tall white rocky head. As the head shrank into the body scattered lacing was left to coat the glass. Very hoppy aroma with citric and floral hops coming out in abundance. There was a slight hint of malt to it at times. Taste was very similar very hoppy all the way through this one with citric and earthy flavors coming together for a great taste. A bitter hoppy aftertaste is how this ended. Mouthfeel was creamy with about a medium body. I could drink this all day, great flavor and aroma too bad I only picked up 2 bottles. Highly recommend to all hop heads and anyone that likes a good brew."
"I remember more hop flavor in previous samples of this beer. So, the hop intensity isn't there in this sample,but it's nicely balanced. I hope Bells didn't mess with the recipe when they changed the label on the beer."
"I love a good IPA. This is a no-brainer as I love it too. Pours a nice hazy copper with a nice lacy head. Has the aroma of nice citrusy hops which makes me smile every time. The taste isn't as hoppy as I thought it would be but it is nice and crisp with a nice citursy hop flovor, almost a lime taste to it. Anyway this beer is what people claim that it is, but I am happy that there are others out there that are easier to find. I love hops therefore I am biased to any hoppy beer. Respect HOPs."
"The mouthfeel was mildly crisp at the start and finished with a smooth bitter citrus tone that lasted shortly on the tongue. Medium in body. This is a beer that could be quaffed all day long. Super brew."
"Drinkability: Very high. Damn fine IPA from our friends at Bells. Just a hop-heads delight!"
"The flavor is roasty and malty. Some sweetness but very little hoppy bitterness. The floral accents and tanginess of the hops come through beautifully, but this is not an over-hopped beer that kicks you in the mouth with bitterness. Very subtle and sweet."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer. Not too heavy, feels pretty good in the mouth, though that dry bitterness at the end may be a bit of a turn-off."
"Drinkability: Top 3 on my list of IPAs, and definitely the most drinkable. Was surprised to find it was only 6% ABV, felt stronger than that. Unfortunately only got 6 oz of this beer, but looking forward to our next encounter...."
"A very good IPA, well balanced in every way, but definitely a choice beer for hop heads."
"Am I glad I was ""forced"" to buy a whole sixpack of this."
"I love the label on this bottle! Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a thick, white head. The smell is very hoppy, with some grassy notes. There is also a bit of citrus/fruit character in the nose. The taste is quite bitter, with a ton of citrus. There are some mild malt tastes but they are masked by the extreme bitterness. Drinkability is good, considering the bitterness. This is a great IPA. Seek it out."
"This is one drinkable beer. I would gladly buy more of this beer and enjoy it when I am looking for a really solid IPA to sooth my hoppy cravings. What a great beer."
"This was a good American IPA and for those who like the style will find this one extremely drinkable."
"Pours a nice golden color with some orange highlights and a thick beige colored head. Piney, citrusy sweet aromas, and a decent malt backbone evident, too. There's some tea-like sweetness from the malt and followed with a big smackdown of hops that somehow taste sweet, almost like pineapple. Very floral and citrus-like while maintaining a good balance. Its only flaw is a metallic twang; like having a penny in your mouth as you drink it. This could come from oxidation of the hop portion of the beer. Its very enjoyable and well carbonated. I liked it better on-draught."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale malt scent with a dry grainy finish. It is full of floral hops and earthy malts. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor followed up with some pale malts and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine American pale ale. It has good flavor and aroma; a good drinker/sessions ale."
"Hands down, my new favorite IPA. Poured a good yellow color with minimal head which disipated. A great citrisy hops smell. The taste, though, is phenomenal. Not bitter, but full of hops flavors. They dance around in your mouth and interact. Citrus, pine, etc. I'm not sure what kind of hops they are using but it seems fresh and wonderful. The most drinkable IPA I have ever had. I love bitterness, but the lack of it while still having hops character is a huge plus."
"I finally found Bell's on the East Coast! It poured a light copper color, almost yellow. The aroma was citric and sweet, a great hop aroma that really made me excited to get my lips on the glass. The taste was rewarding, a nice balance and not overly bitter. It had some sweet cirtic bites that went well with the hops. An overall great IPA. I wish I was back in Michigan and could find it on tap. I loved the bottle since it mentions the Upper Peninsula, home to my old stomping grounds at NMU."
"Pours a nice light amber with golden hues beaming all over. A firm bubbly white head appears about a half inch thick leaving a nice lace. Aromas of piney, resiney, and citrus hops along with light malt dominate. Initially this beer hits up front with sweet citrusy hops and a caramel toffee malt body. Following, more hops just come into play leaving a zesty piney flavor that just lingers on the tongue. This beer finishes hoppy and sweet, with some more zest and yet a final lingering bitterness that just makes it perfection. The body to this beer is light while it has a crisp carbonation that just keeps this beer refreshing. Overall a wonderful brew."
"this ale pours a cloudy bronze with a nice 2"" head. sadly the head fell fast. a thin lace decorates the glass sparsley. smell is awesome. heavy hops and floral notes are the most prevailent witha more subdued grapefruit in the back. taste is good. though not as good as i had expected given the high numbers. hops are jumbled with a heavy floral front and back and slight peppery taste resides. citrus notes but not overly so. bitter aftertaste. mouthfeel is good with decent carbonation. lighter and less syrupy than a lot in the style. drinkabilty is good. the second tasted better than the first. overall not as mind-blowing as had been led to think but, still a decent ipa."
"Wyll-"
"A bit lighter in color than I expected, kind of a light-apricot orange, with a fair amount of yeast floatation. Thin white head. Fresh citrus nose - tangerine and lemon juice with a musty hop aroma. I'm surprised at the maltiness of this beer, actually; I thought I'd be in for more hops than anything else. Don't get me wrong, this beer brings the hops, but a caramel malty presence makes itself known. Citrus fruit abounds in the flavor as well, and this seems to be slightly fuller and creamier than many of its other American counterparts. Very very well balanced, though being the hop addict I am I could ask for a bit more in the bitterness department. But now I'm being a pain in the ass...this is a great beer, and extremely drinkable at that."
"12 ounce bottle brought to NC by AKSmokedPorter."
"This beer is a pleasure to take in. It looks like drawn butter to accompany lobster. This baby looks thick, and sports a very nice pillowy, creamy head that features tons of stick and gobs of splotchy lace. Aromas are at once citrusy, orange and lemon dominate. The mouthfeel is medium to full with ample crispness and a nice bitter tang. Flavors favor the citric end of the hop spectrum, though ample malt nuances serve to balance this fine beverage. A classic IPA, and a delight to indulge in."
"poured a hazy watered down orange soda color. a nice head appeared and dissapeared quickly. lowered to a thin film. lacing was minimal. Smell was very citrusy, like grapefruit, or tangy oranges. Maybe a little peach as well. Taste corresponded with smell. There is definite bitterness as well that is quite delightful, also a bread-like characteristic. Nice carbonation that sparks the flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium, more towards creamy than watery, but neither of two extremes. The finish is dry and bitter . oddly, this could be a rather refreshing brew despite the dryness. Mmm. good beer!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow/amber color with a billowy white head. Beautiful lacings all the way down the glass. Smells floral and hoppy. The aroma definitely tells me this is going to be a punch-in-the-face IPA. Taste is wonderfully dry, hoppy, and bitter. A little floral, bready, citrus after-taste. Goes down great on a hot day. I know people are very critical of over-hopped IPA's and I could see why people would put this two-hearted in that category but I found this to be quite enjoyable. I would recommend this one to all."
"The IPA from Bells. Well, if you like hop squeezins, this should be your cup of tea. I love the look of this in the glass, nice pale yellow color, frothy white head. It looks like it was dry hopped to me. Smell and aroma are, well, hops.... very close to over the top for me, I could barely pick up any malt at all. A solid beer, but a bit too much hop juice for me."
"Final Thought: I was a bit disappointed by this, I was assuming a competator brew with Stone IPA but it didn't even compare. Still a pretty quality brew from a top notch brewery!"
"The bottle warns that it needs to be decanted and you should heed that advice. The last sip is quite bitter and not as pleasant as the rest of this beer. Leave it in the bottle."
"This bottle poured a hazy gold color with a white head and nice lacing on the glass. Mild citrus hop aroma. Sharp, tart, and bitter citrus hop taste. Very West Coast like IPA. It is possible that this bottle may have aged some. I wonder if a fresh one would bring out more in the aroma and flavor department?"
"A damn good IPA."
"Although the taste is not spectacular, the beer is good enough for a session and is, fortunately, not too big so you can enjoy a few."
"Straw to Orange in color. Has the cloudy appearance of a weiss. Pours with a thick, foamy head, which settles into a nice layer of suds. Noticeable lace throughout. Strong citrus hops on the nose. Initially a nice balance of hop with malt on the tongue. Hops remains dominant however, and overtakes the palate. The hops do a dance in the mouth which goes as: First to play is flavorful, floral to citrusy hop then blends nicely into a tangy bitterness, which melts and coats the mouth. The bitter flavor lingers and slowly fades away, leaving just a trace of its original flavor on the back of the mouth and edges of the cheeks. Brown 12oz."
"Excellent world class IPA. Very crisp and lemony citrus. Grapefruit Bitter sipping with fruity salt, and bitter aftertaste with high but effective complementary hops. Lots of initial and remaining foam. Light texture. Floral aroma. Had this five years later on tap at the brewpub and it is flavourful."
"Nice little bite of hops, grapefruit rind, some spiceyness. Bit of fruit flavor playing around in the background, but not so that it stands out much. Nice malt flavor. Good light body with great drinkability, nice session beer, goes down very easy!"
"Thanks to Mikeys01 for the bottle!!!"
"pretty damn good, and definitely different. it takes similar to other IPA's that ive had, but stronger and more crisp."
"The mouthfeel is a bit harsh - acidic? I don't know - but that's why I reduced the drinkability too. Smell & taste keep me coming back. Sediment and mouthfeel give me pause."
"Thanks Foxman for making this one a part of the BIF 7.0 package. I owe you one."
"Hazy amber with tiny suspended particles. A good sandy head. The aroma starts off a ragged tangle of citric centennials. The hops mellow as the beer warms, letting a soft fruitiness through in the aroma and an off dry maltiness through in the flavor."
"The body of the beer and the seductive creaminess are what set this beer apart. The flavors and aromas are rather straightforwardstrong hop flavor and bitterness with a bready malt background and a burst of fruit sweetness. That direct appeal and the subtle, creamy texture make this a great choice for a warm day."
"Definitely very smooth and drinkable, one of the gems in the Bell's line of beers."
"ng"
"notes: My first IPA was Samuel Smiths and I thought I liked it. Since then I've tried others but the blend of flavors in this just really won me over. I love it and so far its my first choice in IPAs."
"Beer is good. Happy & hoppy beering."
"WOW. This beer pours a beautiful cyrstal clear orange hue. Immediately one is struck by the strong, floral hop aroma. It is but a sweet segue into the awesome taste experience. Initial hop bite, followed by a citrusy hop flavor, backed up with just enough malty sweetness to be noticed but not enough to intrude on your hop experience. I could drink way too many of these at one sitting. This ale has displaced the Hopdevil as my new favorite IPA."
"Pours a deep amber/orange with a nice white head, and a long lasting lacing that coats the glass nicely. I give a perfect 5 for the appearance of this unique brew. It's fascinating, it has hues of gold, orange, copper and white, it's almost like looking at a sunrise-beautiful! Smell is very fruity, lots of hops, maybe some floral undertones. Taste has a definite IPA bite to it, coppery, bitter, but yet still a nice mouthfeel. I could knock back a few of these, I think this is my new fave IPA."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head above a slightly (but only slightly) copperish golden brew. Head had reasonable staying power, and laced excellently. Aroma is about spicy hops, and there's probably some malt in there, but that's not the point. Smells like what I would imagine something out of the DFH Randall would. The taste is as well all about the hops, but there is enough pale malts to round the corners and keep the taste buds alive. Also slight citrus notes are present. It impresses me that such a hop monster remains quite smooth and imminently drinkable."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both fine. I was expecting something different, but was not disappointed by this one. It is a keeper and one I would love to try on tap."
"As far as drinkability goes if you're a hophead this would be excellent as it has a nice bitter twinge and isnt heavy but if youre not a hophead I think that the hops might become overpowering after a bunch."
"So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where they're from, hophead's neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of ""multidimensionality"". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not. Maybe a top 10 IPA though. Thanks Jeff."
"This beer blew me away."
"Masala Mama has strong similarities to this. The hops here are more grassy and a little more biting, and the malt isn't as prominent and not quite as tasty. However, this is a beer deserving of its ranking."
"Poured a nice golden orange with a medium sized white head. Aroma is very interesting. Hops are abundant, plus there is a hint of some spice maybe. Taste is very well balanced. I half expected a massive hop hit, but the hops were well constrained by a nice malty base. The finish shows off the IBU's of this baby. It's a very well crafted brew and super drinkable as well."
"Pretty drinkable beer all in all."
"Special thanks to Felonius for pouring me this one when I visited Minneapolis."
"I could see myself having more than one of these in a night and probably would if it were available around where I live. THis is a great IPA. I would very much like to have another...and another...and...."
"Pours a gold clear liquid with a white foamy, fluffy head. Smell is one of the best ever, strong flowery, grassy smell. Slight grainy smell also. You know what is about to happen. On the taste, you get a quick sweetness and then you are bombarded by bitter flowery goodness. Somehow this is a crisp and refreshing beer. Medium body, but this bottle had too much carbonation, as it felt a bit prickly. Very drinkable, I would certainly enjoy this again. I believe that this is the best IPA I have sampled yet."
"The taste is crisp with bitterness and carbonation, sweet with maltiness, and satisfying in its balanced delivery. The bitterness accumulates on the palate, demanding your mouth have more. Who am I to argue?"
"First flavor was citrus hop, with a smooth lingering clean hop aftertaste. Not overly hopped, easily drinkable."
"What is it with new strange beers from across the country usurping my hometown hero, Victory? This is better than Hop Devil. Different for sure. My new favorite IPA."
"Give it up for the man. OFS is in da house!"
"This one poured out a cloudy orange body, with lots of little bubbles. Big bubbly white head topping it off. The scent is sticky hop sap and some citrus notes as well. The taste is a big whack of oily hop blast. Good aftertaste. A pretty good beer, a hopheads delight."
"Thanks to Feloniousmonk!"
"el"
"12 oz bottle, pours light orange and very clear. White head which quickly went to a tiny bubble film and left nice linear lacing. Nose is piney hops. Taste is also dominated by strong, piney, grainy, resiny hop flavors. Grapefuit, lemon, pine, melon and honey on the tongue. Enough of a malt center to add balance. Medium bodied, fairly thin mouthfeel. A well crafted and enjoyable American style IPA."
"I imagine that 2 months ago I wouldn't have liked this much. But, over the last 2 months, I've sampled a lot of different brews and I can tell that my tastes are maturing. I think I'd like to re-review this about a year from now and see what I think of it then!"
"Apparently two hearted is now a yearlong brew. If this is true expect some quality drinking all year."
"Big thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this my way."
"Poured a orange/amber with a frothy white head and considerable lacing. The smell was pine and citrus bigtime. The taste was piney, acidic, citrusy but just too astringent for my taste. The first couple of sips were a little jarring, but once my taste buds got comfortable I started to feel the overall balance and crispness of the brew. Still, a little too heavy on the citrus aspect and after about 2 I was done. This is a great IPA but I did not find this to be my favorite style of IPA overall -- there is something different between the East Coast brewer's IPA's (Sly Fox, Victory) and the West Coast (other area's) which I can't put my finger on but I know I like the East Coast's IPA brews better (more balance, malt, not as much citrus/acidic taste?)."
"There's malt to spare, but the hops are the headliner here. Everything about this splendid brew draws attention to the piney hops presence and results in a simple and balanced treat. Calling it drinkable would be a considerable understatement, as the crisp flavors dare you to stop at just one. And as with potato chips, you just can't. But then, why would you want to when you know how good the next one will be? The reputation is well earned, delivering in grand style across the board. Certainly, in this case, Two Hearts are better than one."
"Pours a semi-hazy golden orange color with a tall foamy white head that slowly dissipates into a heavy and rocky lace. Nose is floral hops and fruity esters (grapefruit, tangerine, and peach) along with a bit of fresh grain. Medium in body with a good deal of active carbonation, though the initial zestiness becomes more creamy towards the finish. Taste begins with some sweet malt quickly followed by a doughy and biscuity flavor. A lot of fruit bitterness is present towards the end with notes of grapefruit and a bit of lemon rind. Nice IPA herejust wish it was available locally. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Try a bottle (or six!). You'll be belching pleasant flower burps for the rest of the evening!"
"5/24/04: Wrong, I had another."
"This is a great hoppy beer. It is a hazy light orange with a thin head that laced the glass all the way to the bottom. The floral hoppy fragrance is incredible, as is the taste. It is a very drinkable beer with a good mouthfeel. I think it's time for another."
"Medium bodied, heavier than I expected from the looks of it. It isn't the kind of beer I could double up on, but one here and there would be a pleasure."
"This would be a nice brew on a hot day or with a plate of cheese and crackers. Now I see why all the ""hopheads"" rave about this one!"
"note: Even in the same 6 pack I've noticed differences bottle to bottle. Some bottles seem to be more heavy on hops than others. Is it possible that this is due to other factors, such as temperature when consumed?"
"A golden yellow brew with a thick white head and an aroma that I could smell as soon as I opened the bottle. My mouth was watering while I poured this beauty. Strong floral hop smell as well as notes of citrus and maybe a pear. The taste is of a hop spice that does well to blend with the tastes of fruit. Very well balanced beer. There is a sweetness to this beer that lets the hops tickle your tastebuds without causing too much damage. This was truely a delight and I would recommend this to anyone in love with hops."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden-copper color, and is topped by a offwhite creamy head. The aroma is of hops; grapefruit, apricot, citrus, and perhaps some pine, which adds an astringent note. The taste of the beer is quite good, to be to the point. But let me pontificate a bit more. There is a light sweetness which contributes to the citrusy hop flavor quite a bit. It is pretty bitter in the finish as well. The hops are not totally dominated by citrus though, there is some herbal notes, some hop spicines, and some notes of pine here as well. In the end a fairly dry beer, but made so because of the generous hopping. There is some malt sweetness here which helps to hold up the hop onslaught. The hops set a tingling sensation to my tongue, that screams pay attention to my hoppiness. This is a great everday beer, though perhaps it is just missing some slight amount of hop flavor & malt backbone to push it over the edge."
"Beautiful, slightly hazy apricot body with a fluffy, yet sticky off-white head. Hugely aromatic citrus hops--orange, lemons, and grapefruit. Lean malt backing lends a nice sugary complement to the heavenly hops. Taste: some malt up front, fruity with a bit of caramel. Big citrus hops dominate. Big, but not too big, in bitterness. This has just an amazing citrus taste to it! Finish is long, acidic and bitter. Big feel for it's size, and very drinkable."
"Comments - Thanks to chilidog and the '03 holiday beer exchange I was able to get my hands on this great representation of an IPA. One of the best IPA's out there that should be tried by all."
"Even though bottled, this tastes like fresh-brewed. One of the better IPAs I've found. Many thanks to trbeer for introducing/sharing this with me."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a huge frothy pillow of a white head. Smells a little bready, buttery, hoppy. Tatses quite reasonable for an IPA, a style I admit I'm trying to open myself too. A little bit of buttery diacetyl up front is followed by a pleasant wave of hops. Some citrus and grass like hints follow the initial hop explosion. Mouthfeel is moderate. Lots of afterglow on the palate with this one. Emminently drinkable."
"This Bell's lived up to what I was expecting it to. The hazy orange-golden colored ale picks away from the bottom up at the large, full golden tan head. Lace is plenty but in spots. The aroma is bursting with floral and citric hops. That hop is carried over to the taste with a more citric favor. Taste of grapefruit with a not overdone lingering bitter is left on the mouth. If your expecting a drinkable, well hopped IPA thats well put together, you can expect thisone to do the job."
"almost faded looking bottle with an illustration of fish,, pours a deep hazy orange-ochre with a huge aromatic foam top and plenty of patchy lace. Smells great, really fresh and clean hop aroma, very inviting. The taste, a medium to heavy bodied ipa, easily mastering all that appelation entails, citric hoppy with plenty of bitterness and a decidely clean finish. Excellent, I will drink many more if given the chance. I have to thank Bill, beergeek279 for his kindness in delivering this beer to my door."
"Thick golden-cream colored head made of large bubbles, leaves a pieces of lace. Oops, guess it's bottle conditioned. Hazy dark golden colored beer. Grapefuity hop aroma is strong and inviting. Bitter grapefruit flavor is suprisingly smooth and never overbearing. The aftertaste is crisp and lightly bitter. Very carbonated beer that prickles your tongue. Not sure what kind of hops they are, but I like em a lot."
"The Two Hearted poured a lovely clear, and bubbly, golden color with a thin white froth that lingered on the glass as it settled. The first smell is of floral hops, not too strong, and with an underlying sweetness--apples, maple syrup? Very intricate. So, too, was the taste; there's a lot going on here: a good blend of soaring hops upon a foundation of subtle malts. And right at the end, a bready yeastiness lingers. While I found it slightly too carbonated for my preference, the mouthfeel has some body to it."
"Color is a hazy orangish golden brown with gigantic bright white head. Scent is extremely profound and starts the taste buds right up. Floral aromas are extremly pungent and predominate but Two Hearted offers a string and complex grapefruit-citrus scent to compliment. Taste is incredible. Very bitter but in a delicate way. Im sure the IBUs for this is through the roof but its not a biting bitterness like Ruination, Stone reg or any other top shelf IPA. Malt profile does much to broaden flavors and taste. Extremely tasty."
"Highly recommended and worthy of the hype!"
"wow, what a friggin' enjoyable brew (and i'm not the world's biggest ipa fan, either)! this one just looks remarkable. it pours a cloudy orange with a massive monstrosity of a head. thick and creamy as hell...just spectacular, really. the smell is front and back loaded with hops...lots and lots of hops. interlaced are some malt, bread and fruit smells with hints of spice as well. the taste is quite nice, with the hop flavour much more subdued that the smell would lead you to believe. this goes into a nice sweet fruitiness with some welcome cream flavouring and finishes quite dry. this one is smooth as can be and is most enjoyable. a great first brew for me from bell's."
"Pours a medium golden with hints of orange. Lacy head. Citrusy grapefruit aroma is nice. This has an even that is elegantly balanced citrus hop and malt flavor. It is almost too balanced as neither jump out but both are there in generous amounts. It is smoothe but not weak. I could drink a lot of these easily."
"Hazy apricot color with a light beige, nearly white, chunky fluffy head that just sits there. Reminds me of meringue. Aroma is floral hops, but smells a bit malty and sweet at the same time. Very fresh and crisp flavor, accompanied by a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Aroma greets my nose every time I bring the glass to my mouth. There is a strong undercurrent of orange flavor, sweet as it mixes with the hops upfront, and tart and tingly as it mixes with the piney hops finish. The alcohol makes itself known subtley. Thanks to MJR for sharing this!"
"Notes: A super hoppy brew with a puckering dryness that I would only put up against the sharpest of cheddars. A hop heads delight without a doubt."
"Great orange-copper haze colored brew, with a big white head that hollows itself out, and sticks around to a pretty big height. Smells heavily of citrus and hops, a great smelling beer. This is everything an IPA should be. Citrus and a good amount of hops, make this a very well rounded beer. Just a damn good beer, no questions about it. If you like hops in your beer, this is it. Maybe the finest IPA in existance."
"Mmm...a fantastic beer, and probably a close 2nd favorite to the Expedition Stout (of all the Bell's beers). A nice hoppiness leads to a deserved position on the Top 50, and certainly one I'll have again!"
"Served from a beer engine at the Map Room, and at English Ale temperature. Good thin yet persistent head. The hand pull yeilded a beer with no bubbles, yet a firm mouthfeel. The IPA hops were actually subdued, nicely balanced between floral and bitter. Somehow I picked up a note of cherries, too. Color is lighter than the usual American IPA, closer to a Vienna or even a Pilsner. I had hoped to get a better impression of Bells than I did at their Eccentric Cafe taproom, and I was right."
"At first, way too bitterly unbalanced. Much like Stone Ipa or Ruination. I like those once in a while for a hop assault, but not for more casual drinking. Anyway, the more I drank, the more the nuances showed through. Surprisingly complex and floral with a strong honey presence. Reccomended"
"Two hearted is light gold in color, good strong carbonation. dense foamy head is on top, and sticks to the side of the glass well. The aroma is fabulous, it smells quite citrusy to me, namely oranges. Flavor starts with a little malt sweetness, then turns into hops. Alot of hop flavor, and the hops taste like they smell, oranges (to my palate, anyway). Mouthfeel is more on the light side compared to some other ipa's i've had, but there's good body backing this one up. Drinkability is high on this one. It's one of those beers where i always wish there was more when i'm done. Two-Hearted has been one of my favorite american ipa's for a long time. If you like hoppy american ipa's, try one!"
"This beer is much better on tap, full of flavor, and fresher."
"I like my IPA drinkable, more of a spring/summer drink than a cold winter night drink. (Except of course for Dogfish 90-minute!) This beer would be perfect for mowing the lawn or doing yard work. Nice and light (for Bell's anyway.) It's worth buying a six-pack if you're a hophead, because if you're like me, you would easily drink a lot of this beer. Have fun!"
"Larry Bell has crafted yet another winner in the Two-Hearted, a beer so aptly named its frightening. A perfect competition for hops and malt in the nose, and a beer that can be loved by both spectrums of beer drinkers. Hopefully next year's will be a bit stronger so it can be cellared, but overall a VERY enjoyable and equal-opportunity ale!"
"The hoppy American IPAs like this are certainly grabbing my attention, and this one is one of the best."
"Backwash: Probably my favorite “pure” American IPA. Excluding “Imperial IPA’s” and beers like Brutal Bitter and Celebration (once categorized as a Winter Seasonal) which are maltier and bit heartier, this really hits the bullseye. Definitely surpasses peers like HopDevil and 60 Minute IPA. All things great beer should be: complex, refreshing, satisfying and endlessly quaffable. Must be killer on draught."
"Pours golden with a slight yeast haze and the head is thick and stick around till you finish your glass. Smells like fresh hops with a citrus overtone. Initial taste of hop bitterness that is very perfumey followed along by a slight malt flavor although not sweet more grainy. Aftertaste is all hops very citrusy. Very perfumery hops flavor. Mouthful is rich and oily is rather drinkable. This beer has more dry hopped flavor then any beer ive ever had before."
"That being said, this beer is great. Aroma is overpoweringly hoppy/floral. I need to ask Larry Bell how many different types of hops he uses. Definite grapefruit in the nose and maybe even some melon ? Has almost and orange tint to the golden hue as it pours. Taste is a real surprise given the aroma, very chewy malty taste that is then devoured by the hop backnote. For the me the balance works but both the front and the back are very aggressive and I can see how some don't like it. If you like this in bottles, seek it out on draught and you'll like it even more."
"Very similar to Sierra Nevada Celebration and Dogfish Head 90 minute. Biscuity malt with a strong and perfectly balanced tang of Cascades and I assume Chinooks or Centennials. Goes down easy with a good dry finish. Mine was a little warm as it had just been transported from PA to CT but at 45-50 degrees I am sure this is perfection. A great American-style IPA."
"This is worth purchasing a sixer here and there, but all in all, not something I'd leap at when I saw it in the future."
"This beer poured beautifully although I had quite a bit of sediment come from the bottle. Beautiful head that lasted for a while with lots of bottle bubbles. Overall, this is a great example of a good IPA. Bell's brewery in general has a great lineup of beers for all sorts of tastes in mind!"
"Pours a cloudy, light golden/orange color. The head is good sized (1+ fingers thick), white, somewhat foamy, and very persistent. The glass becomes nicely laced throughout drinking from the sticky head. A very good hoppy aroma. Tastes of fruity/citrus hops with some good bitterness, which leaves a very nice tingle on the tongue. Nice tasting malt flavors are present as well, but are dominated by the hops. One of my favorite beers and one which I look forward to reappearing each year."
"Mouthfeel is excellent soft carbonation that only cask-conditioning gives to a beer. The bartender thought this cask might have been broached a bit too early, but the carbonation was just right for me. Way too easy to drink a lot of this one. Simply outstanding stuff!"
"Bell's Two Hearted Ale is probably just about my favorite IPA in terms of most drinkable, most character, and just great taste. I just reacquainted myself with this beer when I picked up a 6 pack on a business trip this week. The Two Hearted pour into the glass a radiant honey gold color topped by a generous and fairly dense white head, that sticks around for most of the drinking. Aroma is mouthwatering floral hops and just a little bit of yeast. Taste is intitially agressively grapefruit/citrus hoppy but somehow soft at the same time, giving amazing hop flavor without being overly bitter. Flavor develops a little more malt character towards the end but finishes very crisp. This is a very easy drinking beer, surprisingly smooth and absolutely delicious."
"This offering from Kalamazoo Brewing is one of the best American IPAs out there. Assertive in its hoppiness but not off-the-chart, Two Hearted Ale is one of the most well-crafted IPAs Ive had. Im real glad I saved a couple to bring home to savor later."
"Large enough to show its bold stripes, subtle enough to blend them together, this is a highly complex (in a quiet way) yet highly drinkable beer. Surprising power and complexity for a low abv IPA, yet delicately so. The best of the pale sort of American IPAs."
"a huge thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Stoked to finally get to try a Bell's beer. Two Hearted is all I could have hoped for. Pours a deep amber with a nice white head. The hop profile is a beauty and takes control of this beer from sip one. The balance is very nice. Oh so smooth of a brew. I certainly hope this is not the last of the Two Hearted I sample. I love it. These better come east!"
"When poured, this beer had a medium sized white frothy and creamy head with fine-medium sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was cloudy and uncarbonated with a golden hue. The nose was hoppy, sweet, citrusy and fruity with a bitter and hoppy flavor. The mouthfeel was a bit tingly, smooth and dry and it was medium bodied. This beer had excellent lacing."
"I last tried the draught version of this a year ago, and after getting a sixer of it this year I don't know why I didn't give it a higher score. Pours a lightly hazy dark orange color with a medium off-white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is nicely floral, grapefruity and hoppy. Medium body with an excellent texture. It never goes overboard with hops, but retains a nice refined blend of hops, citrus, pine and a hint of malt. The finish is nicely bitter throughout. This is a top of the line IPA."
"Drinkability: Give me more of this, please. I shall beat down doors and rip the tags of off matresses for this!"
"Appearance: Is simply amazing glowing orange amber tone with an off white massive off white tinted orange cream color head that rises well above the rim of the glass holding together very nicely lacing is thick evenly spread wow what a great appearance, just absolutely perfect. Aroma: Piney with an edge of sweet peach juice malted like an extract form the hops hold dominance on all other competitive components, but citrus orange peel and flower cascades all come to play at this hop gathering. Even after getting the bottle as empty as I could, I smelled inside the bottle to be greated with a robust rush of hops, now that's what I call hop aroma. Flavor: Simply crisp bitterness blended with a malt backbone not as syrupy sweet compared to the likes of a barley wine esque Double IPA but this one holds it's ground as being one of the best IPAs I have ever tasted. Such a good IPA wish I had this one at my disposal, because this is a buy by the case beer all the way. The layers of different hops that harmonize here is uncanny I can literally pick out seperate hop components earthy tones, pine cone like, flowery, citrus zest it's all here this beer is amazing. Mouthfeel: Carbonation solid all the way through body is medium to light I wish there was just a tad more texture my only complaint. Drinkability: Dead on as can be yearning for a bigger supply than just one bottle I am really enjoying this beer it is christening the gameday as my first beer for the final meeting of the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Virginia Tech Hokies, go 'eers!!!"
"Not a bad beer but not what I expected it to be."
"Overall: This one is logged as a must do again! Thanks to Felonious for this cracker!"
"Some sticky sweetness up front, explodes into fruit salad! Melons, citrus, apples - absolutely amazing. A well hopped finish with notes of pine & lemon brings it home. Incredibly hoppy without ever becoming bitter. Medium bodied, smooth, moderate carbonation. A sublime quaffing experience."
"Drinkability: Too bad this is a seasonal. I could easily maek this one of my house beers. Since it is only available for a short while, I will drink as much of this as I can get my hands on before it disappears."
"Overall, a good IPA. Not one that blows me away, but one I'd be happy to drink anytime."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours a hazy orange color with lots of floaties in the beer. Had a moderate head that died off slowly. Wow, this is an odd beer. The aroma was pretty hoppy with citrus and other fruits and spices there as well. The taste was odd because it tasted like it was laden with alcohol, but acutally only has around 5%. Sweet malts were present, but the main part of the flavor had a spicy, orange peel taste with some hints of honey. Very weird. Took a few drinks to get used to it, but turned out to be a very drinkable beer. Extremely orange peel in taste - almost overwhealming at first, but you become accustomed to it and it becomes more likable with time."
"Gold color. Large white foamy head. Hoppy and fruity aroma. Malty and hoppy. Big and bold flavor. High alcohol taste, unusual because it not that high an alcohol content, but smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer."
"Straight 4's on this one a very solid beer, pours a somehwat hazy orange color with a nice medium sticky head.The aroma is very very hoppy and citriusy and resiny,the taste is pretty biiter with a caramel sweet backbone the hops are the definent taste here very citrius fruit like.A pretty balanced IPA very well done."
"Have been hearing about this ale on the Internet for months. Finally made it out to Michigan for the 6th Annual Summer Brew Festival. While in Western Michigan, I found some bottled Two Hearted Ale in Grand Rapids. The taste was like nothing I've ever experienced, especially for a guy accustomed to the rich, cascade-hopped west coast IPA's. Is there molasses in this brew? It definitely has a distinct and complex recipe of hops and malt working here. It was a very good ale, but I can't understand all the hype and why so many BA's rank this as high as they do. Mad Hatter is my favorite Michigan IPA."
"597"
"The taste was remarkable. Creamy big mouthfeel that sits there and hop flavor busting through. Definitely a well balanced cask version of a wonderful ale. Drink one and burp that hop taste all night."
"Bell's makes some great Stouts. Their Oatmeal Stout is amazing, but I haven't been too impressed with their other offerings. I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is just another horribly over hopped American ale. I know it's an IPA and hoppiness is a characteristic of the style, but I just don't think there is enough maltiness and body in this brew to support all the hops. All I can taste is a sickening amount of floral and citrus hops. To me it seems very unbalanced and astringent. In my opinion it certainly doesn't belong in the BA top 50."
"Pours a cloudy orangy colour topped by a big head. Took the glass and raised it to the level of my head and enjoyed the looks of the beer. This beer has an apperance that FORCES you to drink it. Aroma consists of hops, citrus and grapefruit. Quite complex aroma. A very hoppy yet caramelly flavour. Very drinkable beer also."
"As the beer warms and opens up in the glass, the beer evolves to showcase a larger sweet navel orange flavor."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden yellow, with a massive cratered head that really lasted. Lots of sticky laceing on the glass. Aroma is all hops! Taste is a touch of citrus with a good hop flavor and a finish of hop bitterness. I'm not a real big fan of IPA's but this was suprisingly good. I couldn't sit and drink alot of these but this would be a good kick back sipping beer."
"Pours a bright beauty of an orange. A rather delicate, but inviting aroma of mild citrus and hops. She will maintain beautiful lacing throughout. Complex off the cuff, fresh fruit, grapefruit, orange peel, and some inviting light peach notes combined with the floral hops are there, masterfully blended in. The body is medium, it is crisp, creamy and fresh all packaged up together. Slight warming effect, absolutely delicious. Everything you'd expect and more from an IPA, hop heads will be at the pearly gates, non-hop heads will be right behind, this is an anytime, anyplace, session, etc. beer. Mah-velous!"
"Originally sampled 1 November 2002. This is a monsterous India Pale Ale. It has a great citrus flavor with a grapefruit finish. The nose is chokked full of hops. It is a hazy copper delight. In my opinion, it is one of the best India Pale Ales around."
"One of the best IPA's I've had in recent memory. Cloudy copper ale with nice fluffy head, which is the sign of great quality ales. Aroma is superb, piney and citrusy. Has it's own uniqueness to it and different from other great IPA's. I smell a little cedar as another reviewer points out. Nice lacing. Very crisp and carbonation is solid. I only wish I could buy these locally. Would be a regular for me. Thanks JohnnyDuvel!!!"
"Whoa! What an amazing looking beer. Foamy white head that leaves large patches on the sides of the glass as I drain it. Hippity hoppity hop-hops! Helluvan aroma. Bursting in my nasal cavity. Creamy and smooth IPA?! Don't get me wrong, it's crisp and pops on your tongue, but very clean. Fantastic IPA. Supremely drinkable. I am not a hophead, but this is a great IPA choice."
"Strong cedary, piney, grapefruity, citrusy nose, no doubt due to the hops. Smooth sweetish maltyness. Sharp bitterness at the end, with some saltyness and some alcohol noticed, lingering bitterness. Grapefruity and a bit woody?. I don't know, to me this wasn't very exciting, a bit one dimensional, It had a lot of flavour, but maybe it was a bit too sharp for me?. Still, quite alright. Another gift from feloniousmonk."
"Did I say WOW..."
"I had this beer in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The pour yielded 2 good fingers of foam above a cloudy deep orange yeasty liquid. One thing I really love about this brew is the head. It really stays around, leaving a good bit of lacing on the glass. A little bit of citrus in the smell, very pleasant. The taste is a good bite of hops with a bit of frutiness in the front of the tongue. Almost a flavor of clover and pine really. The mouthfeel is pretty heavy and smooth. The drinkability is average for an IPA. One thing I really love about this brew is the head. It really stays around, leaving a good bit of lacing on the glass."
"I think it is just that damn good, and I also think I?ll have another. Cheers!"
"Overall, it a good beer but too much pine for my tastes."
"Not a bad choice for numero 300. The cask pour came up quite nicely with a thick pillowy white head that dissipated rather slowly to a thin lace blanket that coated the sides of the glass thoroughly. The body was dark gold to light amber and somewhat hazy. Nose was full and gave off piney, herbal hop aromas that carried through to the taste. A flowery sense was included in both nose and taste. This is a hophead ale to be sure, but creamy and full bodied to boot. Very little malt sense, but, of course, that is what carries the hops forward. Not overly bitter at any point, the brew finishes with a hint of lip-licking sweetness that balances the overall experience. This would not be the top IPA on my list, and I've probably rated it higher than I'd otherwise rate it because of the cask influence. IMNSHO, it is very good beer, but a bit too highly rated."
"Edit: Since this review, I have tried many other beers. This is still a great beer but there is strong competition from American Brewers that I found as I traveled around the country."
"Updated early April 2003: I retasted and although this second bottle was MUCH better than the first, it still had subtle hints of that vegetal, coriander flavor. I'm upping my score, but not by much. I'd love to taste this stuff fermented without the Bell's yeast..."
"Aromas spot on of striking Cascade hop goodness. Full on, very good. Full flowery hop aromas. First taste is equally striking, stand up and take notice hop bitterness. Combined with the tangy, bitter citrus taste. Subtle malt body. Balanced. Sticky, whole hop flowers, much like a Celebration Ale. Leaves a hole in your mouth, with bitterness lingering on your tongue. Medium bodied, perfectly charged. This one is the ultimate summer thirst quencher or bbq beer. And 7% abv is not felt. A beer I could drink again and again and not tire of it. I had this with grilled bbq chicken and corn on the cob. Perfect !"
"Color was a solid goldish yellow, small bubbly head that faded fast but left nice tight lace in patches around the glass. Aroma is very grapefruit/orangey/lemony peel-like with lots of fresh floral hops and a bit of spice and slight dry malt. Straight up taste is very fresh hops, citrusy with some spice notes and grain, nothing overbearing, very mellow, its perfectly balanced and is very crisp and clean with a great, light dry finish lingering with dry malts and left over hop bits. Hard and very bold, medium body feel, somewhat creamy with lots of fruity sweetness and a nice, light dry finish. This is some fantastic stuff. A favorite of mine for any occasion."
"This was recommended to me by the owner of Shangy's ""The Beer Authority," here in the Lehigh Valley, Pa. I am truly torn between this brew, Dogfish Head 90 Minute, and Lost Coast Indica Pale Ale as my favorite IPAs I have tried thusfar. This is a great brew. It gets a ""5" in appearance based in no small part on the cloudy golden-amber color. A beautiful thing. The aroma is good and hoppy with some spice, but hardly overbearing. Thsi is a fantastic beer and well worth seeking out, if you can find it."
"Hats off to proc for the experience!"
"Now thats what Im talking about! Pours a rich amber/orange color with a nice 1/2-inch head that almost refuses to leave. The head slowly dies down, leaving a moderate lace on the glass. Aromas are rich with hoppy goodness and sweet citrus. All I can say about the taste is, WOW! Amazing! Fantastic! The hops seem to attack the mouth like a rabid dog on a pork chop. The hops are incredibly well balanced with some mild citrus and malt undertones. This is by far the best IPA that Ive ever had the pleasure to taste. Id like to offer a huge thanks to fellow BA Senior (Paul), from Minnesota, for bringing me this masterpiece."
" Id like to thank Paul (Senior) who brought this beer from Minnesota to Williamsburg while on vacation."
"I'm not usually as knocked out as a lot of others are by hopped up, over-the-top micros, but this is one unique, terrific beer! Kind of like a fruit smoothie or creamsicle with lots of hops thrown in. The citrus smell leaps out when you open the bottle (and I can really appreciate it. I have grapefruit, orange, mango, and lemon trees in my back yard!). The hops certainly are present, but unlike a beer like Rogue IPA, the hops don't push the flavor to the background. Pours a nice, foamy head - with good retention. Cloudy, orange hue. Both refreshing and substantial. It was great to have a highly rated micro brew that lives up to it's reputation. (thanks, Al - I'll need more!!) - (note: the above review was for the 2002 version. The 2003 version isn't quite as good IMO, not as smooth. Maybe it will improve with age, but I couldn't wait to find out!)."
"Quite the cloudy little burger this beer, the color a nice orange, the head gigantesque, spumescent, and as it dematerializes the lace magically appears as a silky sheet to occult the glass. The nose is dominated by the hop floral crispness; sweet malt underlies this olfactory delight. Start is sweet and malt laden, top is middling in feel, finish is moderately carbonated the hops puissant, aftertaste hop spicy and dry, quite long lasting, another beer meant for the Hop Heads amongst this most august group of beer lovers."
"Sampled again to see if I judged too harshly the first time. Nope, the taste has a weird yeast or off character I do not find pleasant at all. If this is the distinctive Kalamazoo yeast flavor, I must just not like what it does to the beer."
"Hazy, orangish-copper color with a thick, chunky, off-white head. Leaves an excellent amount of lacing. The aroma is all citric, flowery hops. The flavor again is citrus hops, leaving the malt pretty much covered up. From beginning to end this one is all hops. It has a long dry, bitter finish. Overall this one is a good beer, I really like the aroma. I would drink this one again."
"A world-class brew and simply the best IPA I've ever had. To read about this brew does it no justice. Go drink it."
"F."
"Overall a very nice IPA that I wouldn't have expected from a Mid-West brewer (bold and bitter I don't associate with the mid-continent). I do so enjoy being surprised and proved wrong when it comes to beer."
"Last sample 4-28-06 Still a damn good beer."
"Hazy honey-orange hue, a skinny finger of white head, bubbly, soapy retention, fair about of lace. Lovely soft pineapple initiates the nose, mellow, light citrus warm and welcoming. Pineapple and light grapefruit construct the palate, not overly bitter, mild pine with a hint of honey and a kiss of malt adds tremendous subtle complexity to this brew. Pleasing mouthfeel, soft, ideal, hearty without overpowering. Slightly dry finish, hoppy-pineapple aftertaste. Wonderfully drinkable, not as hoppy as I would have thought (not a negative), a very pleasant quaff this is a must try and I highly recommend it."
"Cheers"
"Pours with a milky white creamy head. Initial flavor has powerful hops that remains on palate and does not fade away as with most other IPA beers. Has strong citrus flavor and is incredibly smooth in spite of its rather high alcohol content. The bite of the hops is very potent and even after making great efforts to sample other IPAs, this one stands alone and the novelty of the wonderful blend of powerful citrus taste and hops has not worn off after over a year of sampling other hops-laden brews. By a wide margin, my favorite IPA."
"A gorgeous pour--hazy apricot color that lightens to a lemonade hue at the edges. Large frothy head that reduces to a cream-colored cake with decent lacing as well. Crisp, hoppy aroma complemented nicely by grapefruit/pineapple notes. Grapefruit is even more noticeable in the taste, which has a malty foundation that could be stronger to balance the hoppy, citrus flavors. This balance actually seems to improve as the beer warms. Bitter IPA finish is actually a bit sour; this is truly an IPA with a twist. Excellent mouthfeel in this nicely drinkable beer. A unique take on the American-style IPA, but a good one even in a toe-to-toe."
"This is the first beer I have ever had from Kalamazoo Brewing Company and needless to say, I was very impressed. It pours with a nice, lasting, white head and a cloudy golden hue. The lace is amazing and makes this beer almost as good to watch as to taste (well, not quite but you get the idea). Citrus dominates the aroma and it has a crisp taste of huge hops. I could hardly tell that this is 7.0% abv by the taste. It is difficult to have only one glass of this great tasting brew. Thanks goes out to Ashley's in Ann Arbor, MI for introducing me to this fantastic brew."
"Pours with a voluminous cream colored head atop a hazy orange beer with amber highlights. The head slowly recedes while it leaves a thick, sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is very sweet bubble gum with a strong lemon-pine hop presence. The sweetness is evident on the pour, and as you carry the glass to your seat. I wanted to take a drink immediately! Who needs notes anyway, right? The first drink is truly heavenly, with a great malt sweetness sparked by a terrific hop bite. What a dichotomy of tastes that somehow blend together perfectly! Very strong citrus notes are prevalent in subsequent quaffs, but the malt is never forgotten. The finish is exceptionally smooth and clean for such a flavorful beer. All that is left is a hint of fruitiness and a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very rich and supple, while not becoming too heavy as the beer is finished. Drinakbility is terrific, but I only had one! So I made it last as long as possible. I'm not sure if the ""two hearted"" refers to the strong prescence of both the malt and the hops. All I know is that the name had no meaning to me until know. My heart was swept away by this beer. By both the malt and the hops. Thank you, oh thank you cretemixer for this absolutely fantastic beer. My advice to all BA's: Sacrifice anything necessary to obtain this beer. But be prepared to lose your heart: she'll take it and run with it, twice!"
"Citrusy, orangey, hoppy, GREAT! a large, frothy, wonderful off-white head greats you. The smell is amazingly fruity and hoppy. This is a superbly balanced IPA. I've had some IPA's where I just can't stand the very high bitterness level. But it's very enjoyable here and not overpowering by any means. The higher ABV is not noticeable at all. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. I wish I could buy this often, but at $9.25 for a six pack (spoiled rich neighborhood), it's a wonderful occasional treat. This is my favorite IPA and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to crossover into this style."
"This a good IPA. Huge hops with enough malt to back it up. A bit citrucy in flavor and aroma.Thick creamy head leaves nice lacing and lasts. Amber color slightly cloudy due to bottle conditioning. I thought the aroma was a bit foul...fresh apples when I opened it went down to what seemed like an old sock full of older hops(OK, it wasn't that bad). I had an urge for hops and decided to try this stuff. Mission Accomplished."
"with hops in front and long in the finish, very creamy and great mellow hop bitterness. The malt is solid but balanced (not sweet). Yum, this won a head to head blind tasting vs Hopdevil and Stone Ipa over the holidays with my hophead inlaws."
"A bottle that's allowed to sit for some time and then carefully poured delivers just a slightly hazy (almost clear) peachy-gold body that's topped by a frothy white head which holds fairly well. It eventually drops but keeps a really nice creamy collar, and a simple swirl of the glass brings it right back up! Additionally, it leaves some nice lace - although it's fleeting. The aroma, however, is even more astonishing than the appearance with a bright, bold combination of soft ripe fruit, tangy grapefruit and resiny pine. Intense! But it goes even one step further as the flavor is even bolder than the aroma with a searing bitterness right-up front, and from start to finish! If it weren't for the rich (almost sugary) and fruity (apricot, tangerine, mild pineapple) malt underneath this beer would be way too much! Surprisingly, and thankfully, the hop flavors are limited to the fruity side of things and the interplay between the crushing bitterness and the sweet malt is really interesting. It's kind of like a ""tug of war"" in the mouth. The firm maltiness is enlivened by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that helps this to happen. It's surprisingly smooth and creamy. This is one hell of a ""take no prisoners"" IPA that should clearly be sought out and destroyed - one bottle at a time! Most highly recommended."
"Quite a surprising beer - mega-hoppy aroma of grapefruit rind makes you brace both feet for the hops onslaught. Hops are there, big and bold, no question, but - in something of a contradition in terms - quite mellow. Usually this much grapefruity hops stomps on your tongue with hobnail boots, but this beer manages to finesse the hops and go heavier on flavor than bitterness. A great beer - ranks in my top five of the style."
"This will be my last review until I can get some taste buds surgically implanted on my tongue. Yikes!"
"Overall a great american styled IPA..."
"Absolutely untouchable American IPA. Just perfect."
"One hoppy IPA. As with most Bells products, I love the slightly cloudy look..light golden color. Nice white head. Hops, hops and more hops dominate the aroma but somehow they squeezed a little citrus in there too. The taste mirrors the smell. I was not dissapointed, left a nice tangy aftertaste. Pretty drinkable for the abv Way to go Larry!"
"Hazy and light amber with a large, stiff, white head. Smelled like a good AIPA should, big citrus. Also, notes of yeast, grains, and some malt. Extremely well balanced beer (for an AIPA) with some toasty malt providing sontrast to the raw hop and alcohol flavors. Fairly light body and carbonation which I liked very much."
"Simply put one of the best beers of any type I've ever had. Had a nice creamy head sitting on top of a brilliant cloudy beer. The taste and smell both yelled out hops! One of those beers a hophead would be more than happy to get ahold of, yet also has enough balance to even things out abit for something who is not a huge fan of hops. Bell's has done is again!"
"pours a cloudy yellowish-orange. the aroma of this beer is the first thing you notice...powerful citrusy hops. a nice, slightly off white head. taste is all hops....grapefruit, floral, a bit spicy...without any astrigent bitterness at all. the malt is there to offer a nice balance. this beer is very impressive...extremely balanced, with tons of hop flavor that is not harshly bitter at all. one of, if not the best american ipa i've had the pleasure to have, when it's ""on"". i've had a few samples in which the sweet fruitiness is muted and the bitterness more pronounced, which would knock it down some for me. when it's on target though, it is hard to beat."
"This may be my favorite IPA of all-time....Incredible nose...I get the huge citrus aroma with pineaples the predominant fruit...looks a little cloudy but a big rocky white head tops this bad boy....the nose invites you in, and then the taste takes over...no disappointment here....great hops flavor...all citrus...grapefruit the big one...also some pear core on the finish....malt doesn't assert itself but this is very balanced in the mouth...highly drinkable, particulary if you like hopped up beers....Next to some of their stouts this is without question their best beer."
"Pours cloudy copper color, citrus hoppy aroma, nice hop profile, crazy ass foamy clingy head. Juicy grapefruit-citrus flavors, medium bodied IPA with a nice rounded full mouthfeel, this may be the most drinkable IPA I have ever tasted, I just can't stop at one."
"Has been, and will continue to be right near the top of my list."
"Pours a nice amber orange with a massive white head, Nice hoppy aroma, and a killer taste excellent hopiness, and a hint of Maudite?, I could be crazy, but one of the flavors I associate with Maudite is in there. Great hoppy beer to add to my arsenal."
"Light golden hue w/ slight haze, topped by a creamy, cappachino like, sticky ivory white head. Trails of Belgian lace. Delectable combination of assertively citrusy hops, light caramel and mild tart fruity esters in aroma lend a vibrant, but rounded tangerine overtone. Crisp, sharp, hop bitterness hits the palate initially, then yields to citrus rind hop flavor w/ a distinct grapefruit note. Malt and yeast derived character is overshadowed by the strong hop profile, but notes of dextrinous light caramel and pearish tartness from Bell's yeast strain can be discerned. Well attenuated, dryish body. Finishes a lingering impression of lightly sugared pink grapefruit. Two Hearted is a delicious vehicle for Centennials. Malt is not showcased at all in this brew, yet manages to adequately support the assertive hopping. Superbly drinkable-- not unlike spiked carbonated grapefruit juice... but in a great way. Very unique. Would be an American classic if distributed more widely."
"Clear orange-yellow with a thin white head.  Aroma was abounding with hops (citrus and floral).  When I first tasted the beer, all I tasted was grapefruit... I could almost detect some malt trying to sneak through and balace things out, but it couldn't quite surface.  As the beer warmed a bit, the malt became more pronounced, and balanced things out quite nicely, making this a very drinkable brew.  It has a medium body, and medium carbonation, with a slightly oily mouthfeel.  Another fine beer from Kalamazoo!"
"Pours with a great big head - three fingers.  You can smell the hops just filling the air, also smell of grapefruit.  Gold in color.  First sip reveals a taste that delivers what the aroma promises.  A nicely hopped beer but not overly so.  The hops balances well with the citrus taste.  Tastes of grapefruit rinds. This is one fresh bottle - thanks, Cloverleaf."
"I just love this beer.  Right off the bat, I could smell the hops.  I did not even know what this beer was before I ordered it, but when it was placed in front of me, I could smell the hops- they screamed at me- wonderful smell of citrus.  I knew this was an IPA.  Taste was fabulous as well, of course, hops and more hops.   Orange and slight grapefruit flavors balance this beer out- of course that it if you like the bitterness of an insanly hopped brew.  For hop heads only."
"After sucking down a few malty bocks, I figure a touch of hops would do my buds some good.  Decided on the Two Hearted and its light copper color and lacy whitish head.  The aroma told me I has chosen wisely.  The fresh burst of spicy hop punched me right in the nose and my mouth started watering.  The huge hoppy spicy hoppy flavor is sharp and exactly the right contrast to any malty brew.  The medium body helps take a bit of the edge off and brings out some of the malt to make this an extremely satisfying beer.  The knife-edge sharp bitterness finishes the experience off with a great bite."
"Thick, rocky off-white head, with some lace.  Copper colored beer, with haze and noticeable suspended particles.  Very noticeable fruit sweetness in the aroma, with a hint of hops.  The taste is all hops, from the start to the finish, very pleasant but without much malt.  The taste was very long lasting, with oily hops feel.  Very nice, buy it if you can get it."
"This beer was a cloudy orange color with some carbonation present. It formed a sudsy white head that left some nice lace(but could have been better if they had poured it right). The aroma was huge hops with malt and the usual citrus present in many Bell's beer. The flavor was of hops, malt and citrus and the finish was slightly bitter. On tap at the bar(or maybe it's this year's version)seemed a bit more citrusy than from the bottle."
"Nose of deeper citrus; more like tangerine and grapefruit. Overripe fruit. Lemongrass. Twigs. Pure and bright honey malt flavors with some exotic Asian spices. Commanding hop presence through to the long finish."
"The actual review from 2002: This is one incredible IPA. The nose is that of grapefruit with a deliciously bitter hop taste. Pours out to a golden color, all its own. Its almost pastel in color. The head is large and reminds me of whipped cream. The taste excels. Yes the hops are huge, but their is malt here too. Enought to keep the big boys (the hops) from being overwhelming and giving this beer its wonderful character. The hop taste lives on long after the beer has been swallowed. The hops grab you and nearly make you beg for another sip. Once you find your palate likes hops, beers like this will hook you and your journey to all that is hop goodness will be well on its way."
"Murky caramel color with a thick white head. Sturdy retention, excellent lace. Nose is more subdued than its fresher brethren's, however the floral hops still loom underneath a seemingly smoky aroma. Less floral, earthy hops on the palate but more yeasty, toasted quality than noted in other bottles from 2002. The bottle conditioning imparts deeper, more complex flavors that hit the palate a bit differently than the younger, more assertive, and hoppier 2003 version. Of course, this stuff tasted the same as the new stuff a year ago. Pleasant, smooth mouthfeel with some subtle carbonation. Great for a year-old bottle conditioned IPA."
"Pours a bright clear golden with a huge rocky head and a nice sticky lace.  Smell is all hops, huge fruity/floral aromas, enough to singe the nose hairs.  Balance is the first word that comes to mind for the flavor.  Although it is not quite as evident when the brew is colder, as it warms it shows a very nice, very smooth malt character.  Just enough not to let the insane hopping drive you insane.  Piney, flowery, and citrusy hops abound and hold a party on the tongue.  Fairly dry and nicely crisp and refreshing, this is one drinkable IPA with its great balance and completely undetected alcohol content.  I was very impressed with this brew as I seem to have been with everything from this excellent brewery so far.  A hopheads dream brew.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample."
"Bronzish-copper and cloudy look with a solid head that holds. Spicy and citrusy, hoppy as sin, strong. Lovely. Bloody sin lovely. Must try IMO."
"O!  This is some good stuff!  Two Hearted is a seriously hopped brew.  Herbal and citrusy, with a bit of a yeasty tang.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen this in bottles in the area.  If I do, this will become a standard in my beer fridge."
"There's nothing tame about this beer.  It jumps into your glass with a head that rivals most Belgians.  The dregs of the bottle swirl around the light amber liquid like the milky way through space.  You're hit with the most incredible barrage of aromas including apricots, orange rind and yeast undertones.  In you mouth, it's pretty much all about citrusy hops.  Malts?  Who needs 'em?  Finishes lemony with a spicy yeast profile establishing itself as the beer warms.  Great beer, but what's up with that label?  Thanks, proc, for the experience."
"Medium head, long lasting. Hazy amber color, upcharge of streams of medium bubbles. Straw aroma with definite marmalade smells. Hoppy, bitey flavor, more like orange rind than grapefruit. Malts slightly cut the hops, preventing a ""back swallow"" burn and giving a lightly syrupy, medium body. Impressive fullness. Solid beer, definitely as interesting as Kalamazoo's fleet of Stouts. A mouth ""wrangler"" to some degree, but not catoonish. Its rare that I get particularly excited by an American IPA but the hops on this one are outstanding without being overwhelming, juicy and straddling the line between citric and minty but retaining a fresh sense."
