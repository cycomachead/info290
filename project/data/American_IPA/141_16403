5,22,5,5,5,5,5,"In my humble opinion, Smuttynose's Finest Kind IPA is one of the best IPA's I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I work very hard, 40+ hours a week, and I'm up at 5am to be at work on time. That being said, if I have the money, I'm buying a six-pack of Finest Kind after work every day and drinking the entire thing over the course of a few hours. Now, I'm not an alcoholic in any way, but I sure as hell am addicted to Finest Kind. It is the epitome of what an IPA should be like. Not to mention that when I wake up in the morning, I'm not hungover at all. Now that's what good beer is all about: enjoyment, satisfaction, and the feeling of being rewarded. Absolutely love it.","-Hoptimus_Prime-","Mar 17, 2015"

This beer had a nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, fairly clean, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, but the taste doesn't really give me the urge to come back for more.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel it was good and just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the green hop aspect, I think this bee would be better if it didn't have that.  I would buy this beer again, but I don't think it's something I'll keep in the fridge at all time.  I would recommend giving this beer a try, but I can't say it's a stand out in the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, it's a pretty solid IPA, don't get me wrong, but when it comes down to it, I don't think it has anything that really sets it apart or makes it memorable.  This beer made for a nice first impression for Smuttynose and I think it falls at above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this is a solid IPA, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Feb 13, 2015"

The smell is citrus with a malty sweetness that couldn't complement better. Perfectly balanced across the board. Taste is as hoppy as a standerd IPA should be with just the right amount of malt. Great unfiltered feel, crisp but not thin and the right amount of carbonation. Overall excellent, drink one you will want another drink two and you know it's really good drink a few cases and you will see its just about perfect.","Keystone","Jan 21, 2015"

3.75,-8.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.75,"Poured in to an IPA glass, the citron orange liquid displays a slight chilled haze. There's a nice pillowy head that rises above the rim. Decent head retention, with beautiful white snowflake-like lacing in its wake. An aromatic bouquet of minty pine and grapefruit greets the nose. Pleasant and enticing scents. The flavor is malty sweet with a pronounced hop bitterness. Pungent and pithy. The pale toasted malts wrestle with grapefruit zest, and go down for the count. More balanced than some other American IPA's, but certainly still a hop-centric ale.  There's a light lingering mint with a relatively clean, refreshing finish. Excellent mouthfeel with a perfect marriage of a smooth, rich body, and zesty carbonation. This is a quality IPA. It's easy to drink and provides a nice hoppy experience. With the glut of IPA's on the market, this doesn't really stand out too much from the pack though. It's just a tad overrated in my humble opinion.","JohnnyI","Jan 18, 2015"

It's a very nice change up from the usual overly bitter IPAs that linger and leave your mouth really dry.

4,-2.4,,,,,,"It poured a slightly hazy golden amber with a billowy white head that left excellent lacing.  The bitter hop aroma hits you right out of the gate with heavy citrus, tropical fruits, lemon zest and some floral tones to round it out.  The taste starts with the same citrus and tropical fruit hop tones that end with a nice resinous and slight pine bitterness coating your palate.  There are some floral hop notes mixed in as well and begin to reveal themselves as the beer warms. The hops float over a slight malt body that doesn't get in the way of this very clean and sharp hop presentation.  The bitter dry hop finish keeps your thirst quenched and really allows this beer to shine as a hop tribute.","brurevu","Oct 29, 2014"

Appearance...well even with a super slow pour I couldn't keep sediment out of the pour, and alot of it (even after setting for two days??), I'm fine with it but I'm sure it could put off some. Amber in color and hazy in appearance. The taste took me a while to get a grip on. On first taste it seemed to be way overpowered by piney hops with no forgiveness. After the first half it really smoothed over and the malts came to life and it came to life. The second one I poured and let mellow in the glass for a bit longer and that made this beer the Finest Kind of IPA.","baldwinfamilyfarm","Aug 26, 2014"

A hophead's delight - goes down a treat. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Aug 23, 2014"

The malts try to carry the load, but buckle under the weight here. A personal preference. A great example of the super high IBU American IPA genre, so fans of the style who dig and crave this know and of thing will find all they could ever want here. Not me. I am not adverse to hops, but the bitters are over the top for my palate and not enough of that floral character I love in IPAs.","logicalparadox","Jun 28, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit juice flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with solid citrus zest and citrus juice characteristics that are slightly better in the taste to me.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 25, 2014"

The mouth is adequately sticky and smooth. Flavor is far more bitter than the nose with a lot of grapefruit pith, floaral bouquet, and oakish earthy notes.

Looks like your standard IPA, clear and golden, I was actually expecting sediment, due to reviews and what it says on the box, but its clear as day. Smell is a bit lacking, hops are there but not what Id call the "finest kind". Mouthfeel is great, just what I look for and expect in a beer. Taste... hmm I have to taste it over and over again. Something is lacking here. It is crazy bitter, like the white part of a grapefruit. I think they must have done all their hopping at the beginning of the boil, its like they forgot the other additions. Its solid, and I like it. Will I buy it again? probably not.","Jay_Ulreich","Jan 18, 2014"

On the nose, pineapple/orange/apricot scents, coupled with dank earthy herbal tone. On the palate, lots of fruit up front, as well as a hint of caramel/toffee, but then a bitter herbal piney/grapefruit finish. Mouthfeel was average, with strong carbonation. Overall, good but not great. Frankly, I was a little disappointed. Will give it another try soon, as palate fatigue may have compromised my senses.

First smell is of citrus hops and some malt. Smells of a summer day. Mouth is fresh and sharp. Nice carbonation also. The flavors are hops on the citrus side. Some pine needle spice which adds to the light biter flavors.Did I mention the hops, they seem to explode in your mouth. Very enjoyable with my fish dinner.","dalahodson","Nov 17, 2013"

Hops are more pleasant and overall the brew is tastier than suggested by my earlier review.  So I'm raising my rating for taste and overall  from 3.75 to 4.0 and smell from 3.5 to 3.75 based on a combination of bready malt and piney hops..","scotorum","Nov 16, 2013"

They should have either toned down the hops of added more rich flavored malts. But if hops are your thing and that's all you need than try this one out.

Nose is more understated than I expected. Subtle, floral, grapefruit & pine. A confident malt presence as well. Taste is grand with malt character that offers up some honey sweetness, biscuit and grain to contend forcefully with an expansive hop profile. They rise up to the malt with earthly,floral and grapefruit finish that’s tremendously dry and bitter and leaves you with a good pucker. A rambunctious IPA whose flavors all play off one another so well. Would definitely buy this again and again.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

It's pale golden, unfiltered, and the flavors are beautifully integrated, as indicated by the unique aroma and taste. It combines fruity and vegetal qualities nicely. Perhaps the best thing about it is its long-lasting, gloriously bitter and hoppy finish. Unusually pungent for an East Coast brew, Smuttynose is one of the few East Coast breweries to really get an IPA right. A must try for all true hopheads.","Cobrito","May 05, 2013"

Pours cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, pineapple, grapefruit, citrus rind, floral, pine, grass, bread, light caramel, and earthy hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pine, citrus rind, pineapple, bread, floral, grass, light caramel, and piney spiciness. Nice amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice hop flavor balance and complexity; with just enough malt balance to not be overpowering; and minimal cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. Great balance and complexity of hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Jan 08, 2013"

(Finestkind usually goes for $8-9/ sixer in my area, so that’s pretty damn good.) Sometimes when people talk about East Coast IPAs being too sweet and malt-forward, I think they’re just talking about some old bottle of 90 Minute they had. If those same folks had a fresh bottle of Finestkind, I’m pretty sure they’d be singing a different tune.","fmccormi","Jan 03, 2013"

The smell is, you guessed it piney of hops with some citrus and pale malt coming through also. The taste just hits your tonuge like a blast of nice bitter hops with a nice grapefruit flavor closer to the back of the tongue. The mouthfee is great, nice and smooth, coats the tongue real nice and overall a damm good IPA, one of the better ones i have had.","chefhatt","Sep 28, 2012"

Sweet bready malts, orange peel, but really not much more here. Taste- deep bitterness on the tip of the tongue and back of my mouth, Balanced somewhat by a nice sweet orange/citrus malt backbone. This is pretty hoppy/bitter, and the hops win in the balance here bigtime. Pretty tight carbonation, this stays pretty airy and drinkable. I like the mouthfeel- pretty medium bodied. This is a nice IPA, but not sure I would give it an A+ as others (incl the bros) did. I like it, but don't see that its hype worthy. Solid B+ IPA.","lnashsig","Jun 13, 2012"

I've tasted IPA's, DIPA's, IIPA's by the dozens, and become time-honored intimate with twenty to thirty specific varieties, from all over the country. What makes this IPA sooo good is the slightly different profile that separates it from the over copied (albeit tasty) northwestern IPA's. The beauty of the unfiltered murk and the super sudsy, Victorian-lace producing head, all adds to the occasion, making this a quite attractive beer. Odors are pungent and floral. White grapefruit resides in a sap-like chewiness. And best of all??? This ale is dynamite when served both room temp and ice-cold. This beer is not only for hop lovers, but for artisans who really appreciate what goes into a perfect session. Top notch.","datalager","May 09, 2012"

4.54,10.7,5,3.5,5,5,4.5," Overall (4.5) This really is an IPA of the finestkind, standing out from its pine & citrus hop monster contemporaries. Smuttynose IPA sets the standard in paying homage to the British origins of the style, while still adding a distinctly American spin. As far as the appearance, taste, and mouthfeel go, I honestly can't imagine how they could be improved upon at all. My only complaints are the understated aroma and the fact they don't distribute to California. Overall, it is the definitive example of its class: British IPA by way of American IPA.","Sunhunters","Apr 11, 2012"

4.1,0,4,4,4,5,4,"Cask pour served in a true pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed honey-gold coloring with a frothy, bubbly, off-white head of about a half an inch. Aromas are flying off this brew, with a hoppy, citrus, and pepper blend that has a strong resiny overtone. Flavors are more subtle with the cask serving, with a roasty undertone giving rise to the wet, resiny, cedar hops profile that fuels the tastebuds. Light toffee backbone boosts the grapefruit highlights amongst the bitter and rich hops. This tastes great on cask. Bitter and resiny aftertaste, it's like chewing on a cedar and pine air freshener. The body is light and extremely smooth from the cask pour. The finish starts creamy smooth, then shifts quickly to a drying bitter end. Delicious!","GarthDanielson","Mar 23, 2012"

3.38,-17.6,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Received in a trade from Colby, thanks man. Poured from bottle with clear dates on the edge of the label but no detectable notch so I cannot confirm how fresh this beer is. The beer pouts a mostly clear copper orange color with a nice 1.5 finger head with good retention an solid lacing. There is a notable amount of suspended clutter in the beer, perhaps an old bottle? The aroma is a blend of toasted malt and earthy hops, the hops actually take a back seat to the malty character which is almost burnt in aroma, interesting. The flavor follows suit with a malty forward prescense and residual sweetness. Medium bitterness. The hops are dominated by malt throughout, makes me wonder how old this bottle is after reading other reviews. The beer is medium bodies with good carbonation. Overall I think this is an old bottle as it doesn't correlate with other reviews.","hopfacebrew","Mar 01, 2012"

4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, bottle is stamped best before 04/18/12, bought as a single bottle in a pick a 6 pack at my local Kroger. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head and some sediment floaties noticeable. The head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. The brew smells like floral and light citrusy (orange peel, grapefruit) hops, along with some sweet malt. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel malt. There's also a nice long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has good carbonation. Overall this is a good, solid IPA. I'd buy this again in the future, it's definitely worth a try.","bluejacket74","Dec 26, 2011"

As in good. Huge citrus/pine flavour present due to some amazing hops. My guess would be cascade or something similar. Super bitter, and yet you can still detect a balancing malt presence.

After seeing it, I suspected yeast, but I certainly was not expecting it to come out of this bottle otherwise I would have decanted off the top 11 ounces. A finger's-width of foamy white head develops, but subsides relatively quickly. Smells of lemon, grapefruit, hops, pine, and a touch of sugar and clove. Tastes of hops, alcohol, straw, lemon, orange, and some caramelly malt in the rear. Mouth begins with a bitter hop presence, but mellows out in the middle and finishes smooth. An almost soapy aftertaste is left, but it's not entirely unpleasant. Moderate carbonation bubbles off the tongue.

Pours a very hazey yellow orange, with a fairly sticky, one inch white head with a gentle pour. Smell is of pungent grapefruit, pine, and pineapple. The beer is only 3 weeks old, such a great use of IBU's. The taste is even bolder then the smell. Great carbonation and mouthfeel.

The bit of oxidation at the end was the other clue that something is up with this bottle despite it being sooner than it's freshness date.

Grapefruit, pine, honey, green tea, a very broad spectrum of bright, citrus notes. My palate is left reeling, aching with drying acidity, a little hint of bark, and not much sweetness to balance. This is a serious cure for a hop withdrawal. Oh, after finishing the bottle, I had to have a glass of water.","GeorgeAldi","Aug 10, 2011"

The second batch was the same. So, what's the problem? The hop smell is very subdued, as is the taste. It's a good bitter IPA but without much in the way of aroma or flavor.

3.55,-13.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is firmly a medium-bodied beer, but that works here.

A pretty pungent IPA with the citrus then sour elements dominating. More bitter this year around. Almost an apricot type sweet note comes through in the mix.

It's like I'm drinking watered down hop juice, the hop bitter really ruins the IPA. Had it been something that I would have expected such from, I would have enjoyed it more. I enjoyed the many other common offerings of Smuttynose, and this one is my least favorite. I like IPA's, but this one is little malt backbone, not very flavorful, and just hop bite.

So, I thought maybe I had an inferior batch or just not as fresh as it could be. So, I thought I'd buy another six & give it a 2nd chance before I reviewed it. I was hoping to have my mind changed, but it was not to be. Burnt orange in color w/ plenty of unfiltered sediment. Smell was good w/ a citrusy, piny fragrance. The taste, while plenty hoppy, left me w/ a bitterness aftertaste which I'm not a big fan of. I guess I've just been brainwashed by the Left Coast IPA.

The sweet malt is in the background with some dry toasted notes and subtle tropical sweetness from the hops in the middle. There is a gentle herbal quality but I can tell this bottle is fresh since it doesn't stand out, the citrus rind leads to a sharp finish which is dry and satisfying. I think finest kind IPA is an east coast Ipa that sets itself apart w/ bitterness level that is high, but not over the top. It is dry and quenching relatively speaking with high amounts of hop flavor -no shortage in that department. I consider it a good example of the style.","Slatetank","Jun 05, 2011"
4.1,0,4,4,4,4,4.5,"O- My favorite Smuttynose brew and one of my favorite IPA’s. It’s bitter, yet very drinkable and a staple in my fridge. If you are a hophead, seek this one out.","iadler","Jun 02, 2011"
4.06,-1,4,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall- A very flavorful and decently complex IPA, has about the perfect amount of bitterness as well, though the aroma is somewhat of an anomaly. I will definitely be drinking this again.","JLeege","Jun 02, 2011"
4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Taste strikes a nice balance with some toasted toffee and hefty hop bitterness. Hop flavor is clean and not as notable as the bitterness. Nicest part about this beer might be the mouthfeel - very smooth and creamy. Delicious and pretty much flies under the radar when great IPAs are mentioned. Underrated in my opinion.","twiggamortis420","Jun 01, 2011"

I do believe this just edged out Stone IPA in my book. I'm just about finished with my beer and the lacing and head are still there at the bottom of the glass. Very good first impression.

4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Big fluffy head over bubbly orange and golden. Hazy, with plenty of web lacing on the glass. Aromas are citrus, and I'm happy knowing the deliciously bitter hops follow.

4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall - I was actually surprised by just how hoppy this beer was. For those of us that like hops, like myself, it packs a lot in this IPA, but there did seem to be just a little bit of imbalance. It seemed like it was missing some sweetness.","BeerBuckeye","May 24, 2011"

Other than that, the beer is fairly formidable. Bitter, but not overly hoppy. I miss the overdone hoppiness of some of the new IPA's.

4.69,14.4,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Nice huge frothy cotton head. Body is orange peel in color but cloudy with a ton of floaties. Good thing is that seems to happen with the freshest beers. Smell is very juicy, spicy citrus hops. Tons of sweet pineapple laced with sweet caramel. Very nice clean hop bitterness on the first sip. The tangy mango and grapefruit lay out in the middle and backed by a subtle sweetness. Bitterness is nice and lingering. Very soapy mouthfeel with not too harsh and not too soft carbonation. Been looking forward to this one for a long time and it has lived up to my personal hype.","generalnotsew","May 21, 2011"
4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a bottle (Best By Jul 2011) into a Smuttynose tulip glass. Pours a nice golden yellow with about a 1/2 inch head. This IPA really is a perfect example of the style, although it comes from an eastcoast brewery you can tell there are some westcoast influence (the nice hoppy bite) but there's this nice malty undertone that I don't usually get from some American IPAs which makes this unique. Smuttynose is one of my favorite breweries and this ties with the Star Island Single as my favorite beer from them.","KLAYNE87","May 21, 2011"
3.53,-13.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy, golden color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of floral hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, and hint of grass. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, floral hops, slight sweet malt, and hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend.","Tone","May 20, 2011"
3.92,-4.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A well-made IPA though not my favorite take on the style.

Wouldn't buy this again but glad I tried it.","eat","May 20, 2011"

4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Some grapefruit rind is notable in the taste, but a piney flavor comes through in the finish and aftertaste. It's not overpowering though, and not as mouth-puckering bitter as some other IPAs. Personally, I'd like to taste the citrus a little more and the pine a little less. A slight breadiness from the malts is barely noticeable in the background. Nice mouthfeel. Overall, a very good IPA.","DeltaGolfSierra","May 17, 2011"
4.32,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The taste is filled with layers of bitterness ranging from smooth to sharp, but always pleasant. The citrus hops take over the taste of the apricot, but the latter is detectable in the complexity of flavors. The balance between the fruitiness and the bitterness are on point, if bitter hops on the back of your tongue are pleasant to you. The mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink, leaving a lingering bitterness. Delicious beer and one that I must try again.","chodinheaven","May 17, 2011"

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured out a hazy burnt golden/orange with about a finger of bubbly head that dissipated quickly. Nose is a lot of floral grapefruit with a backing of citrus. The malt in the nose is extremely light with only hints of some caramel. The flavor mirrors the nose with a lot of the floral/grapefruit upfront but it quickly transitions to the sweet bread caramel body. A solid dry finish that reaffirms the hops you taste right up front. I think the drinkability of this beer help smutty establish a name.","DrinkingDrake","May 15, 2011"

Nose has mandarins, rye bread spiciness and a floral piney character. The taste is almost a muddled mess - i really think i am reviewing a beer a bit past its prime. Finishes a bit chalky and has some generic hop qualities along with slight citrus taste. I am stoked to try this beer and would love to again fresh but i can only rate what i tasted and it was not that great.","Trilogy31","May 03, 2011"

Nothing is overwhelming or underwhelming and although it is solidly hoppy and bitter, I think would be a great intro IPA. flavorful and not overbearing.

Although, I must say, I'm not too sure that I would drink more than a couple of these in one night. The hoppy flavor isn't really balanced by the fruit notes of the beer - this is really the only thing I wish were different. If the fruit came out just a slight hair stronger to give some more drinkability, this would hands down be a 4.5 all the way through. then again, it always seems to be that the more sips I take the better I feel about it and the more I'm convinced that this is one of the absolute best IPA's.

4.75,15.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a hazy golden amber. As one reviewer said, it looks like honey! The smell is good, but didn't seem overly strong to me. Piney, hoppy, IPA bitterness. The taste is outstanding! It is a full-bodied IPA taste, without being harsh. Some IPA's I've tried have had that overly harsh "bite". This beer has all the full-bodied hoppy bitterness without making your mouth pucker in a bad way. It's not just bitter for the sake of being bitter...it has depth. Creamy (for an IPA) and balanced. Floral and a little piney. Not too much grapefruit notes (which, for me, is preferred). Mouthfeel...it is almost "chewy"...in a good way. Very drinkable, despite a high ABV.

Citrus, some pine, I don't get much after that. The taste impresses me more and more with everyone of these I drink. Pretty hoppy, citrus and pine. Some caramel in the background. Nice and hoppy though, leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste which is great. Pretty good mouthfeel, nothing much else to say about that. I could easily do all six of the six pack in one night.

4.13,0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Smuttynose usually pumps out fine representations of beer styles. let's see how their IPA stands out in an extremely crowded IPA market. Bottle has a humourous picture of two old dudes kicking back in front of a trailer with beer bottles scattered all over the yard. Me in 50 years? Finest kind indeed. Anyway, pours a bright golden color with a 2 finger head, tremendous lacing down the glass. Aroma is comprised of primarily of strong citrus hops, a bit of pine, slight biscuity malt, and a bit of grapefruit. Hop bitterness hits the tongue upfront, with smooth citrus fruit rolling nicely around the mouth. A faint trace of malt is present, this is a very hoppy beer. Good bitterness. A prototypical IPA. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, a good amount of bitterness. Drinkability is outstanding,dangerously slow, especially considering the good finish. A great example of an IPA. While I wouldn't put this into the "elite" category reserved for four or five near perfect IPAs, I would consider Finest Kind a great interpretation of the style.","ramseye4","Jan 28, 2011"

Very strong nose of floral hops, sweet but not syrupy, and promising depth. Nice full mouthfeel, very drinkable but substantial nonetheless. Tasty citrus flavors complement the flowery sweetness of the hop, without making it too dry but balancing it all the same. Extremely well-balanced, complex but accessible.

The taste was more piney and hoppy on the palate with citrus grapefruit that helped out on the hop bit but was not too hoppy. It also had caramel and sweet malt accents to help balance out the beer. The beer was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a hoppy, piney, citrusy, bready, and mild bitter finish.

Taste is also great, Nice and hoppy, not too bitter, some fruity jazz going on, maybe pears or green apple, and a little peppery. A tad earthy. Mouthfeel is splendid, medium bodied, no bitter aftertaste, and still bubbly after a few minutes in the glass.

A bit of cloudyness as well, along with some sediment particles floating around in the glass. Nose is full of strong, bold hops that linger with characteristics of dense pine, citrus, some sweetness and a touch of alcohol. The taste blasts you with a nicely balanced concoction of piney, bitter, citrus hops that mingle with an oily, biscuity texture. Almost no alcohol noticeable in the taste, while a sweet and heavy malt presence shows up at the end of each sip. A medium body with low carbonation leads this brew to a high drinkability, smooth and easy to knock back more than one of these.","jsdunlop","Dec 05, 2010"

Lets begin this way---pour. The pour yields a good looking, clear amber-orange colored liquid capped with a nice fluffy head. Lacing remains to the bottom of glass. Smell is of hops and some pine. Taste---well, here goes---BITTER. I find the dominant feature of this IPA is its overriding bitterness. There is little malt to speak of and a crisp dry finish. Now, this bitterness makes the brew a occasional drink for me---I tend to like a better balanced IPA. But, I do like the beer and crave it occasionally. To me, drinkability suffers due to the bitterness. I know its the style of this beer, but be warned---you want bitter, you got it. BTW, bottle reviewed was very fresh.","DJED69","Nov 29, 2010"

Smell is a bit faint, no big floral smacks in the face like you'd want from an IPA, but what you can smell is citrus, resinous grapefruit. You really have to try hard to get a smell, and I think for a bold IPA you should be able to smell it sitting next to you, aka, Two Hearted or even Alpha King. Anyway, taste is of citrusy grapefruit, with a resinous hop oily aftertaste. Some lemon zest in there too. Nice lacing on my glass. Some good carbonation and medium/rich mouthfeel. Some sweet malt body gives a nice backbone. Anyway, these are quite smooth and drinkable for such a high abv. Overall a nice beer, but not quite all that I look for in an IPA, especially in the nose.

Taste ascertains my lemon rind inclinations, with some upfront bitterness and a thinner malt base than I would've liked. The other fruits play more minor roles here (grapefruit and some pineapple), but are still present. Taste greatly improves as it warms, really starting to like this.

Aroma is a juicy tangerine hops combined with malty sweetness. Taste starts with the malts and fruitiness, but takes on a stronger, more out-of-control bitterness near the end, which continues through the aftertaste.

Absolutely gorgeous. The nose is largely made up of tropical citrus notes, with some bready malts barely perceptible as well. The taste is similar, but after a brief flash of bitterness I'm not getting too much else besides straight grapefruit from the hops. Pale malt sweetness is again present, but an afterthought. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing, as the beer is overcarbonated and just a little on the thin side.

Look is very nice...a robust orange with a fluffy dank head, extensive sediment, decent lacing. Smell is so fresh and so clean, and hints at some choice hops. First sip...wooooh! Went down like sandpaper. Very dry feel, very heavy aftertaste. Wasn't expecting this level of dry hoppiness. The second sip was a different story. This one went down smooth as silk! By the way, it looks like a snow globe inside of it with all the sediment. Anyway, yeah, this is an IPA I can get into. Just keeps getting better and better after each sip. This stuff is no joke! It's dry as hell, it's hoppy as hell and it's got more sediment floating around than the East River, but it's a winner.

This was really hoppy and that aspect was fine, I just usually like more than just straight up bitter hops. I got some pine but that was it for me. The beer was so smooth though and I love that.

Right at my limit of how hoppy I think a good IPA should be. It went down smooth, and wasnt overly carbonated. The drinkability was good, but not a beer that I am going to want many of.

Mouthfeel is fairly light with a moderate amount of carbonation, and a nice creamy texture.

From the aroma to the taste, there is just something that doesn't sit well with me. It leaves an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. I tried this several months back and wasn't impressed and decided to give it another try and the results are the same. I love IPAs and hops galore.

4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is my second experience with Smuttynose IPA. Pours an orange-ish honey-esque color with an average size white head with some good retention. The carbonation and condensation help to increase the deliciousity of this beers appearance. The nose is filled with citrus and piney scents with a nice bready fullness. The taste follows suit with a hint of malty resolve and a nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and appeasing while remaining light enough to keep you thirsty. The carbonation is well balanced just like the flavors. That is not to say that this isn't one of the more bitter IPA's readily available. If you've got a hop grudge then this may not be for you.

This thing started out with a nice thick, creamy head, quickly settled down to a thin but solid head. Beautiful light copper color. Left a nice ring of sticky lacing after every sip (or gulp ;-)). The first whiff of this was just straight up grapefruit (I love a grapefruity IPA!), some grassy undertones upon more thorough examination, as well as some malt sweetness just trying to break through the citrus. The taste was more of the same - grapefruit right up front, as it warmed a little bit the malt really came through and balanced this beer nicely. The bitterness is in your face, but not overpowering, very pleasant. Clean, crisp finish. This had a nice full mouthfeel with just a little bit of slickness on the tongue.

Taste starts with just a hint of malts and then move in to an attack of hops. Fantastic bitter citrus hops hit you first, then some grassy hops even out the middle, some pines and floral finish the taste on this one.

The malt is there only for balance and doesn't add much sweetness. Yep, this is hop heavy and only a somewhat complex. The mouth feel is fine and delivers the flavor in addition to leaving the bitter taste at the bottom of my tongue because of how thick it is.

The taste is a mass of bitterness. A lot more that the aroma leads to believe. Other than that the taste is muc like the aroma. Again, it is something I've had over and over before in different beers, but it is done well enough that doesn't bother me. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture.

It's not really as clean-tasting as the West Coast IPAs I tend to favor, and the hop profile is not particularly to my liking: Simcoe, for instance, is similar to Cascade (which I love) but the fact that it is so concentrated and manipulated paradoxically makes it seem astringent.

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. I think you'll be quite pleased.

Active carbonation, but not overly fizzy. Aroma is a nice balace of sweet malt & grapefruity hops. Taste is neutral at first, with a firm wallop of grapefruity, slightly metallic hops on the aftertaste, which lingers for a good while after the swallow! Mouthfeel is light & smooth, whith a hint of carbonation fizziness on the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good, fairly light body and relatively low ABV for an IPA. Good stuff!!

Sweet floral hop aroma with some sour grapefruit. Taste was initially a sweet caramely malt that was very quickly taken over by a bitter hop profile - lots of grapefruit rind, pine, and herbal hops with hints of bitter orange rind. Mouth-feel is juicy at times and medium bodied. Oliy hop resins coat the palate well. The oils push the lingering bitterness almost to the point of no return at times, but is just held in check by the sweet malt backbone. Finishes very dry. At first I wasn't that impressed with this tongue bruiser, but it is a quality American IPA for the hop lover. Definitely has its unique characteristics, which helps it out when compared to other American IPAs.","barnzy78","May 26, 2009"

It has a golden orange color and a pure white head of soapy bubbles. It had a grassy aroma that makes one think of being outside in a field. There is a full-bodied malt taste at first followed by a very sharp hop taste; it's bitter and strong. I imagine these flavors are enhanced by the oak cask cask and a higher serving temperature, so the bottled Smutty IPA may not be as forceful with it's hops, but this cask was certainly nice. It had a medium body and left a bit of a coating in my mouth. I couldn't really taste the oak or any hints of Scotch whisky, but they were probably there, my palate just isn't refined enough to find them.","ToasterChef","May 22, 2009"

Add a real nice lacing that comes as you drink and this is a pretty IPA. The smell's just as nice - pine and grapefruit and a little bit of malt. Others have chronicled how lovely this is far more eloquently than I can but the taste is nice and hoppy without being overwhelming with a good crisp feel to it. I could definitely drink this all day if I had the chance (and I suppose the two fellows on the label don't do much to hurt that sense) - this is far and away my go-to IPA and recommend it as highly as I can.","frimairist","May 20, 2009"

Appears a hazy light apricot color with about a finger of creamy eggshell colored foam. The head leaves a nice lacing on the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. The nose is dominated by floral, citrus fruits such as lemon and orange, as well as piney hops, and sweet malts. The tongue is greeted with huge citrus flavors, mainly grapefruit juice, tangerines, as well as tropical mango, sweet caramel. Pleasantly bitter and clean tasting. This IPA falls somewhere between medium and full in body and is amply carbonated for the style. I'm fortunate to be able to enjoy this fantastic ale on a regular basis where I live.

4.19,2.2,3.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a one-finger, frothy head. The smell is all hops; citrusy like lemon and pineapple, resinous and piney - a nice hop bouquet. The flavor, while being hop dominate, is pretty well balanced with the initial piney, citrusy hops coming out first followed by the bitter hop bite and finishes with a slightly malty grain finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy, viscous carbonation - chewy is a good descriptor. Overall, a drinkable IPA, very good indeed.

Very light mouthfeel, but not too thin. Glad I saved this beer for about a half of a year. I got used to drinking standard IPA's (Hop Wallop and Hop Devil, Stone IPA..the list goes on).

Taste is absolutely sublime. A crashing wave of grapefruity goodness from start to finish, lingering for what seems like days.

Nice crisp orange color, slightly hazy because it's unfiltered. decent head, but not overwhelmingly frothy The nose isn't heavy on the florals like Two Hearted, but the first sip gets your attention very quickly. This one is a pure hop bomb, and drinking one behind a Ruination IPA, the bitterness level seemed to be about equal.

4.54,10.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"While the orange color is light and closer to yellow than amber, it has a gauzy translucency which deepens it, good one to two finger head of white whipped froth and strong lacing. Unassumedly penetrating nose of white grapefruit, lemon citrus, wheat and rye, pine tar, flower blossom, dry and hoppy without forgetting to allow the tight package to soak in enough to be enjoyed. Medium-bodied, there's a fun interplay between the sneaky carbonation and the general inclination towards woven balance, sometimes dancing nimbly across the palate, sometimes wanting to grip it firmly and make it listen to the message. Playfully bitter hops and yeasts contribute to an erect posture in the mouth, The white grapefruit, mandarin orange, lemon citrus alternately sweet and sour. The pine and wet tea leaf notes persist, the floral dimension needs more 'tude to get heard. Can't say it ever tastes "malty" but this element doesn't cushion things here and there.

It's hard to believe a beer with that kind of bitterness (although it is very brief) could be so smooth and drinkable. There's a nice malty backbone that balances it out. Citrus notes like grapefruit and possibly some lemon present in the taste, though they give way more to the herbal notes, slightly grassy and some pine notes, although not as much pine as was in Great Divide's Titan IPA, which preceded this beer on my list for the evening.","Gyle41386","Jan 03, 2009"

Orange with yellow edges, small off-white head, some nice lacing. Aroma of bitter grapefruit rind, pine and sugar cookies. Not much aroma in the way of anything particularly "kind." Flavor has a nice bitter grapefruit flavor backed up by some pine sap, lightly sweet pale malts, but mostly pine needle. Flavor could be a little more balanced, but the nice oily hop flavor is always welcome. Aftertaste is virtually non-existent. Medium bodied, slick, decent carbonation.

Malt and yeast comes together to give off yeasty bread aromas. Bready malt profile doesn't quite hold up against heavy leafy sharp hoppy bitterness. A little bitter grapfruit juice in the mix. Definitely West Coast style IPA here. Finish is bone dry with plenty of bitterness - not in a good way. Mouthfeel is very tannic and sticky with a good level of carbonation.

A ghost of malt does hover above it all but never but is not haunting enough to scare the bitterness away. Loads of grapefruit citrus again with a twist of pine in the flavor.

4.43,8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a slightly amber golden hue. Fairly cloudy with easily-noticed sediment throughout, this seems uncommon. Hops have a very crisp piney scent to them. While lacking the intensity of double ipas and other hoppier beers the hops here have that same focused strong scent. A bit of tangy citrus aroma and floral notes besides the hops as well. Tastes wonderful. The hops become more medicinal and sharply floral. The citrus is present but more subdued than in some ipas. A sweet nutty flavor too, unsalted peanuts I think, that becomes stronger as the beer finishes. Mouthfeel is superb for an ipa. Chewy and broader than most ipas it has a highly rounded medium+ body, especially for an ipa. Finish is long, nutty and has a remarkable hold on the pallet and mouth. An exceptional underrated ipa.","Duffman","Sep 11, 2008"

Taste follows nose; losts of citrus astringency and hops bite. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and very lively without feeling overcarbonated; lots of residual bitterness lingers between quaffs.

Flavor is bursting with moderate American hops right up front with a decent malt backbone to carry the hops. Flavors of peach, apricot, and fresh grains support moderate to moderately high hop bitternes.

In any case, I thought it was worth reviewing again. Pours amber with a white head that sticks around a bit and very decent lacing. The smell has very nice piney hops, and this same pine is found in the taste in a long piney bitterness. The malt is there, but it very much plays second fiddle.

Mild sweetness is present on the back end, but this is so wonderfully resiny and bitter, it's hard to fault.

The slight tingle of carbonation at the front, having a thin feel blending to amore of a medium feel. It finishes with a medium dryness at the backend of the palate. This is a very good IPA, solid in every category. Throwing some spicy mexican food at this beer is excellent.","cameraman","Apr 24, 2008"

There is a slight cloudyness to this beer. there is not too much of a smell to this some light hop aromas and somevery light flowery notes. There is a litlle bit of malt aromas if you really search for it. I feel like there shoud be more to the nose. I put it down for a while drink a little water then try again, I think I am picking up some white bread scents but very faint. Taste is hops up front but not overwhelming there is a nice bit of malt there to back it up. As it warms a little and given a good shake I feel like there is a bit more malt character coming through, this beer has a nice clean hop finish that lasts.

Nose has the zest of foamy hops and a slight mineral, spice character. Enters the mouth very silky but quickly yields to a dry spicey hop feel that is even and long on the mouth.

The smell is very nice hop esters, oily hoppy notes, pine, some lemon, biscuity aromas too. The taste is hop, hop, and more hop. There is a very pungent grapefruit tang to this beer that you'll experience from the nose to the finish and all the way through.

The range is restricted for acidic fruits and not sweet-based red or dark berries. The acidic level seems really high...and that's what most hop-heads look for....hop bite. And this brew delivers that. no problem. The smooth and now...semi-sweet malt pops out even more as time goes by, often I find if a brew is a little on the frigid side, the hops will dominate totally, leaving you with an odd bitter-beer face, until it warms up and other flavors come out.

It has a medium mouthfeel, not too sticky, sharp kick of hops, grapefruity yes, but also bitter leafy plant-like, juniper or maybe pine or grass. There is an awesomely "deep," dry, bitterness which melts down into my tongue and its there long after a sip. the sweet caramel butterscotchy wonderfully subtle malts both mellow, yet linger with the hops, although you don't notice them for a loooong time after the bitterness fades. then the bitterness comes back!!

I wondered if the bartender had mistakenly not sent me an ipa when I got that first sour mouthful, there was a hops presence along with some apple but the hops were struggling. But after a few tastes the hops begins to overtake the sour apple side, it mellows and really grows on you. It has a wonderful body and substantial feel with nice carbonation. It is very easy to drink though it does remain on the tart side (not too bitter really). Overall an excellent effort by Smutty again. Will drink this one any time.","Durge","Aug 23, 2007"

The taste is intense grapefruit hop flavor with fair bitterness yet amazingly well balanced with solid maltiness underneath. General bitterness ranks pretty high also. Mouthfeel is pretty solid subdued carbonation does enough to move the beer across the tongue without making it too light. The finish is very dry with a long lasting bitter aftertaste.

First taste was definitely a huge bittering hop blast with a very long finish that made me thirsty. Kind of an earthy taste as well.

Not really much of an aroma, though what I did detect was pleasant and somewhat sweet, almost a little like vanilla. Nice medium/light body with perfect carbonation.

Label states the beer is unfiltered, and it has a very cloudy appearance through the glass with some particles floating around, which I see no fault in with an IPA. Smell is dominated by citrusy hops, with a faint trace of malt trying to get through. Flavor starts out with a huge bang of citrus hops and also some pine. Hops remain as dominantly constant through to the finish with the malt trying to sneak through without much success toward the end. The intensity of the hop bitterness is so high that it almost lends an astringent feel in the finish that lingers for a while. This is probably due to large use of some very high alpha acids and not off flavors. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is at a nice level. This is a nice drinking beer with a bang of hops. The astringent feel in the finish drops it a few points for me, but this is a nice big, hoppy IPA.","kkosmoski","Feb 02, 2007"

I was not sure if that sample had suffered or not, it certainly did not seem like it, but it was hard to tell  yet on reflection perhaps judging by this fresher sample it wasnt at its best, still great though.

Nice white creamy head that leaves behind gorgeous lacing, like an artform, along the glass as it is poured down the gullet. Smells of citrusy grapefruit and hops hops hops. Tastes of extreme grapefruity hops all the way, citrusy, grassy, and pungent. Pucker up! Finish is semi-dry. The grapefruit character takes on a kung-fu grip on the palate and hangs on for dear life until the next explosive sip is taken. Mouthfeel is like liquid velvet and rolls around in the mouth. Perfect carbonation balance tingling on the tongue and never invasive. I could drink these all day long, tolerance permitted. One of the best straight-up IPA's on the market today.

Big hop (pine pitch) aroma on the nose, with yeast as its only counterpoint. This is one helluva bitter beer on the palate -- way out of balance, but not unpleasantly so. Citrus flavors come in first, followed by grapefruit, with a finish that displays just a touch of crackery malts -- the only note in this brew that sounds of malt. Mouthfeel is quite astringent, nearly puckering, with an active, buzzy finish.

3.62,-11.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Orangey yellow one finger bubbly head. This is unfiltered? there is yeast floating around. I missed the warning, though it seems like it wasn't settled anyhow and would be in the mid even with a good pour. That makes it a bit unattractive in appearance though otherwise it was pleasing. Aroma is citrus rinds and flowers. Not over the top but getting there, good resinous aroma, but all hops. Taste is intense bittering hops. It's definite a hop kick from the start in that plain old bitter sense. Tastes like a few and not just one hop variety but not a million either. Surprisingly, a malty flavor peaks in at the end, of all things. Very grapefruity in flavor. A hop-heads delight. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with full on carbonation; leaves a zippy lively feel on the tounge. For all of that, I admit this was nothing special. I'm finding I like the multi-hop kind of flavor over the single hop kind of thing, but also with this beer I realize the distinction in "where do you put the hops?" so to speak. Abundant bittering hops, vs abundant flavoring hops, vs abundant aroma hops, and all of the above. This one focused on bittering to my palate, so while the hop choices weren't overwhelming, the puckering bitterness made this not enjoyable. I learned something here. Smutty shows their ability to craft well here, though it's not to my palate. A fine beer for the hop lover, but not the IPA I'd return to.","Liquids","Aug 19, 2006"

The aroma has a great citrus hop nose: grapefruit and lemon, yum. The taste is much of the same with a caramel malt hint that doesn't balance the bitter hop attack, but I don't think it was meant to.

But there's not the intensity I was expecting, making this quite drinkable but not quite the palate destroying experience I thought it might be. Good and bad. Lower carbonation and smooth really with a fruitiness that seems to dominate. Drier on the palate than nostrils however. Balanced but hoppy.

I have to say I was very disappointed by this brew. It was a golden/orange color with a slight white head. It had a very earthy/bitter aroma and an overly hoppy/bitter taste. No malt character, It was like grass in a blender if that makes sense. The aftertaste was much the same, and left more to be desired. Its light body and carbonation allow it to go down very easy but this taste was too off for my palate, I would stay away from this one.","eph","May 28, 2006"

The taste is full bodied with big-time hopping, moderately to generously bitter with a very dry finish. Interestingly, you are led to believe you are about to taste a sweet beer based on the fruity nose; this is not so whatsoever as this brew throws a curveball at your sensory system! Always one of my favorites any time & any place. On a point, a phone call to Smuttynose today reveals that they will be changing their labeling on all their products shortly to indicate a "Best by" consumtion date rather than notching the month of bottling date out...Hummm.... I think I prefer the old system, as I would rather judge "should I or shouldn't I"...

Dry. Hint of lupulin but low on the co-ho grassy. Orange rind soured. Dry hint of cherry sour. Dry rough oil finish. Similar to Hop Wallop, but this has a grassy coho dry edgerather than the aromatic light hop oily charater of HW. Md body that's slightly chewy.

The aftertaste is typical for this style, but not too powerful. I very enjoyable beer that can be had numerous times.","jaluria","Oct 13, 2005"

Aroma is floral bouquet of hoppiness. Which is immediately confirmed with the first sip. This beer is hops; small explosions of oily bitterness all over the tongue. But then those hop bites recede into a slightly sweet malty finish. Oiliness kind of sticks around a bit. Felt like I was squeezing lemon rinds right onto mouth tongue.

This is a more fruity/buttery version of the style than most. That I believe is a good thing. Definitely tasty as hell. Hops are awesome, not too strong, but leave you wanting more.

The mouthfeel is smooth, not too thin or thick, carbonation is fairly light. This is one drinkable IPA. Very smooth beginning that finishes with a great hop bitterness that leaves me wanting more.

The taste starts with a sweet citrus, like pink grapefruit, that hits right away. It finishes with a slightly sour bitterness, much like a grapefruit would. Not a bad start, but as I drink, the overall flavor gets more and more bitter.

The Aroma was strong with hops but they smelled like fresh cut lawn as opposed to good, half spicy grass, half citrus. The mouth feel was a nice smooth feeling which exploded with hop bitterness. So much in fact that it completely covered any maltiness. I'm a hop head myself, but this beer was not a balance of easy going malt and hops and a pleasant aroma. It was more of a hop attack on all counts. The aftertaste really intrigued me. I sat there for a while and literally yelled it to a friend two seats over. ITALIAN BREAD!!!

The nose is very hoppy with evidence of spruce. The mouthfeel can best be described as full but also adds an overflowing characteristic. I enjoy the fact that the hops don't bully you right away, its more of a slow mount. Overall, its very sprucey with a woody character and clearly has a heavy dosage of hops (cascade?). A few sips in, you find the brew settles bitterly at the back of the throat. The finish is a little more sharp with the bitterness as the spruce is accompanied by just a splash of lemon. It really sticks on the palate and leaves a dry coating. Really, its solidly built.","Hhawk06","Feb 05, 2005"

Yeasty perfume of doughy sweet malt, candied anonymous fruit and resinous, sappy, cannabis-y hops. Very kind. Sharp hop acids bombard the tongue up front. Bitter, yet tasty...hmmmm...I like that. Hop taste is slightly citrusy, but mostly pitchy white fir sap. Light biscuit and fruit malt flavors are there, but can't quite keep pace with the aggressive hop attack. Finish stays hoppy and resinously bitter, with yeast, and hints of candied malt. Delicious. Very lively mouthfeel in a medium body. Almost too lively. Still, an IPA I could drink everyday.","alexgash","Feb 04, 2005"

Very good aroma, hops are almost like the freshest ground black pepper. Flavor is hoppy to be sure, again, pepper with a balsamic vinegar tone that suggests the richness of malts as much as anything else in the brew. Hops tend toward resiny (waxy) with a touch of orange cream soda, and if the malts don't keep up in obvious separate flavors, there is enough there to balance and give a good impression. Anyways, because of the flavorful hoppiness, I'm rating this as one of the best IPAs I've come across out of a bottle","ADR","Feb 01, 2005"

Flavors are sweet ruby red grapefruit, a sharp hop bitterness that lingers, and lots of malts which are stronger in the aftertaste. Also a little bit of bitter chocolate and coffee flavors which I don't usually find in IPAs. Lots of hops with a good malt backbone. Very smooth - nice carbonation and it coats the mouth well.

The hops are dominant in every aspect of the beer, but remain nicely balanced by the beers sweetness. The finish is seriously bitter, with a no-nonsense lingering flavor.

I generally like more hoppy/bitter beers, but this was a little much for me. It wasn't very complex, just a big uppercut of hops. It's good for what it is, though. Light mouthfeel, dry finish.

The bottle had some obvious sediment- poured clear orange-copper until the sediment hit, then turned hazy. Two finger foamy oyster white head that left tight lacing. The nose? wow, it hits before you pick up the glass, while you're still admiring the pour. Grapefruit and hops, a touch of peach. The taste is grapefruit through and through- I could drink this for breakfast! There is a subtle sweet malt underbelly too, but this beer is about hops.

This beer is a slightly orangy color with a big frothy head. Aroma is intensly hoppy and full of citrus. Taste is crazy hoppy, even for an IPA. Very tangy and citrussy up front. Not a lot of malt present to back it up though, but this beer is meant (I would assume) to be hoppy all the way. Letting this beer warm up a bit is a good idea because the crazy hops can mask the more subtle tastes of apircots and other fruits. Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability? Um, yeah.

The aroma was all citrus (orange and grapefruit) with a slight skunkiness. Its taste was much like its aroma - big hoppy flavors... citrus up front, a little spice in the middle and a strong bitter finish that remained in my mouth for far too long for my tastes. Some malty sweetness appeared as the beer warmed but for the most part, this IPA was all about bitterness. Its mouthfeel was medium and slightly oily. It's not my favorite IPA to date and pales in comparison to Smuttynose's Big A IPA, which is much more balanced.

Flavors are less pronouced, but the combination of citrous and floral type hops makes for a good taste, almost masking the bitterness in the finish, which this beer needs more of. I like my IPA's with bite, and this falls a bit short in that department. Nonetheless this is not your average IPA and is very flavorful, even though there is not a whole lot of malt character - the hops provide ample flavor here. Mouthfeel is dull, kind of subdued, but I could drink plenty of this stuff. A good IPA, and surely some would consider it great.

Carbonation is fine and the beer is silky smooth. This is far more balanced than the Big A ipa. Drinkability is high.

The taste is similar to the nose as the citric and floral hops dominate the taste from front to back. The slight malt sweetness pulls together the flavor very nicely and a bit of spice adds to the kick. The taste ends with a nice dry bitter finish as this goes down.

However, the flavor is more balanced than the nose. A honey-toffee-caramel base supports this avalanche of hops. Very nicely balanced. Full mouthfeel and quite creamy.

After that subsides a little, a nice bitterness comes in and gives me something to think about. Quite clean. The smoky, MaryJane-like tones come into play on the palate as well. Kind of sticky. Juicy hops take over from time to time. Underneath all the hop play, there's a substantial enough malt base of biscuit and toffee. Body is medium at best.

Appearance: Hazed with hop particles suspended in an orange amber body matched with a big doughy looking slightly gelatinous healthy sized off white orange tinted head leaves heavy thick lacing beautiful appearance. Aroma: Is quite floral with a touch of pine and citrus, really quite grassy with the malt sweetness relatively unnoticeable. Taste: Big rush of hops hits the palate the high bitterness and low sweetness may seem a bit unbalanced at times, but I for one am thouroughly enjoying this blatant use of hops. Pine cones and grassy citrus bursts flow along my palate along with a touch of the pale malt sweetness bringing a bready quality about it, in short this is one big hoppy American IPA. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly resinous mouthfeel I like the raw hop flavor a bit unrefined but downright ideal for most hop heads easy even carbonation well done. Drinkability: Easily forms the cream of the crop when referring to American IPAs, I have been on the fence with some of Smuttynose products but I assure you this is a winner, an aggressive flavorful IPA just what the doctor ordered for us hop heads.","WVbeergeek","Jul 06, 2004"

4.5,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A nice showcase of hop flavors with a balancing front and prominent edge of hops in the finish. Reminds me alot of Bell's Two-Hearted with just a bit more hop finish, therefore, just a tad less on the drinkability. But very good non-the-less. Big thanks to Jason for the supply of this stuff!","tavernjef","Jun 16, 2004"

4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has nice malty scent covered with an intense citrous hop aroma. It smells just like a fresh grapefruit. The taste is great. It has a solid malt base; mostly pale and light crystal malts. It also has an enormous hop flavor that is quite citrousy and bitter on the aftertaste. It goes down easy and refreshes on the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good IPA. It has tremendous flavor and awesome aroma; a good sessions beer.","WesWes","Jun 12, 2004"

Appearance is fine with a nice head and lacing, but the chunky yeast is still not my favorite. Smell, like the mouthfeel is a rounded bouquet of citrus and fruits. Taste is very citrus, having a drying effect on the overall experience...nice. Very drinkable for the style...next time, I'll get a sixer. Up there with Hop Devil IMHO.","edchicma","Jun 06, 2004"
4.75,15.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Murky and tantalizing. Small groups of soldiers sink to the bottom of their creation. Clinging to everything it touches, trying to escape its captor, the froth is alive. Floral bouquets with cornicopias of citrus fruit provide temptation. Sticky honey provides a dirty sweetness to trap you in. Then the bitter launches its assault.","waughbrew","Jun 06, 2004"
4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy golden orange appearance with a two finger tall creamy rich head is dead on for an IPA. The head is constantly replenished by lively carbonation in the beer, and leaves a ton of lace around the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly hops, and is brimming with a citric and piney bouquet. There is also an undertone of maltyness on the nose. The taste is very crisp with the grapefruit like and peppery hops complimented very well by toasty pale and caramel malt. The mouthfeel is medium thick and juicy with a dry finish. A great representation of the IPA style, and a welcome surprise as a part of the BIF 7.0 shipment from Foxman.","rajendra82","Jun 04, 2004"
4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Damn - thats a fine IPA! Some caramel & biscuity malt followed by an onslaught of fruit, orange, pine, & slight floral notes. Medium bodied, relaxed carbonation. Reminds me a lot of Shoals Pale Ale, except on steroids.","xgrigorix","Jun 03, 2004"
4.35,6.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This poured a nice hazy orange-amber color with a lovely head that lasts a while. The aroma is citrusy, fruity, very pleasant and enticing. This is a finely balanced IPA with none of the over-the-top hopping that characterizes so many American IPA's. Though the hops are the predominating attraction, there's enough of a malt backbone to balance the whole affair very nicely. Left a nice laciness down the side of the glass due to it's medium body. Thoroughly enjoyable and a nice session brew.","LarryV","Jun 01, 2004"

The taste is refreshingly delightful. Nice bittering blended with malty sweetness. Almost a hint of peach at some points. Go out and buy this fine beer. Don't get a six pack, get a case, as this is a highly drinkable beer and you won't want to run short.","BadBadger","May 30, 2004"
4.42,7.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark golden color with a finger width white head on top that didn't sustain itself for too long. Turned into a ring around the glass and lace sticking to the side. Smell was strongly scented with syrupy hops juices and just a little malty sweetness. The taste was supremely hoppy with the more juiciness up front with the hops changing to a more bitter piney resin flavor in the finish. There was a bit of charred malt flavor but it was much more focused on the hops. The mouthfeel was crisp and just slightly syrupy. All in all this could be THE summer IPA. Definitely takes the cake over the 60 minute merely for cost sake. Seek this out!","GreatPondBrewer","May 28, 2004"
4.32,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"hazy golden orange with hints of brown. Smells like concentrated pine needles and raw hop leaf. the head is slightly orange with sticky with hop oi making a wonderful lace as you sip. taste is heavenly pine like a wonderful maine (or NH for that matter) fall day. It is like chewing on pine needles and full hop bubble gum, leaving a thick sticky raw hop feel in your mouth. Easily drinkable, specially on a warm day after a hard days work of serving clam chowder, really clears the the grease and seafood taste out of my nostrils and mouth after working in a seafood resteraunt all day. Good stuff filled with those wonderful hop burps that burn enough to let you know you drank a hop headed beer.","MediocreatBest","May 26, 2004"
4.54,10.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"My goodness, look what New Hampshire has wrought! It's about the hops, but the grain has just enough muscle to balance and accent the hoppy highlights. Simply, there's a lot here to like a lot. The biting refreshing character goes a long way toward making it very, very drinkable, and in my eyes, that's true craftsmanship at work. After reading about it, I was excitied to see it on the shelves. After drinking it, I'm even more excited about taking the next one out of my fridge.","Foxman","May 26, 2004"

4.49,9.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"A cloudy golden ale, Smuttynose IPA pours with a thick creamy head that remains through the entire glass. A beautiful beer. The nose is full of piney, spicy, grapefruity hops - and lots of them! Taste is hoppy, with a firm malt backbone and a bitter, sharp aftertaste. This beer is all about hops - it's how I remember my first IPA tasting - but it has the body to back it up. An excellent, very drinkable IPA - perfect for hopheads who want something that is a little less strong than some of the more trendy imperial IPAs.","ColForbin","May 21, 2004"
4.75,15.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Simply superb. It's as if the brewers at Smuttynose took a reading directly from my brain regarding 'BuckeyeNation's IPA wish list' and then proceeded to brew a perfect match. I've had a lot of amazing beer in a very short period of time and this IPA is one of the best of the best. Highly recommended (in case you hadn't already figured that out).","BuckeyeNation","May 21, 2004"

4.47,9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"a semi-vigerous pour produced a decent sized, fluffy but chunky tan head on top of a cloudy copper colour with floating bits everywhere. the head leaves a nice sticky residue on the glass. the smell here is quite nice, with hops coming at you off the bat, with some earth, bark, biscuit, fruit and pinecone notes apparent. the flavour is nice and balanced like the nose, but earth notes overshadow the sweetness a bit here. this one starts out sweet and remains so in the middle and then the hops hit you full on at the finish (mixed in still with a dirty earth flavour), but even then it's not a hop blast, a la many west coast ipa's, but it's a nice kick in the taste buds, nonetheless. the mouthfeel is wickedly smooth and thus makes for a nice quenching year round brew. a nice new offering from the folks at smutty.","SixpointJMH","May 16, 2004"

I think I actually like it more from the bottle and I really loved in on tap! This brew poured to a cloudy/hazy orange color with a nice fluffy white head the left chunky rings down the whole brew. The aroma is hops and a lot of it very floral with a very strong citrus smell. Man, this beer smells incredible. The taste is great, slicing citrus (grapefruit) hop right from the start with a nice bitterness throughout. I can sense other flavors in the background but it is hard to pinpoint them, but they all seem to balance out as well as you can with a hoppy monster like this! I know I had it on tap and was impressed but wow, not sure if it is because the weather has gotten hotter or what but this brew blew me away! This is probably the best IPA that I have had to date with Berkshires Lost Sailor a close second! This made my evening!","Stimack","May 16, 2004"

4.28,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer pours a hazy apricot color into the pint glass with a decent finger and a half head, which leaves some nice patchy foam at the rim of the glass. Recedes into a thin layer slowly. Smell: Theres a distinct wheat aroma to this beer, which is equaled by a fruity hop aroma, with the underlying pine, alcohol and yeast hues. Taste is grapefruit, grapefruit, and citruis, with a subtle hint of grapefruit. This huge hoppiness is really in your face at first, but as the pint progresses, and you get used to it, it reveals its more subtle flavors. There is a small burnt flavor to this, with a very hidden syrupy sweetness. Aftertaste is the same bitter citruis as before. Mouthfeel is wonderful, with a medium (yet somewhat dry tasting body), just the right amount of carbonation and the perfect sense of how much alcohol you are in fact drinking to it. A great IPA to say the least","FranklinPCombs","May 09, 2004"
5,22,5,5,5,5,5,"This is my first straight 5's review and given the fact that I have drank little else in the past month I'm confident with that. I think a good analogy could be made by comparing this brew to a CD; Smuttynose IPA is that new album that you just can't take out of the CD player and when you do try to listen to something else you're just waiting to pop the Smutty back in. This will definately be in heavy rotation for the rest of the summer, at least.","dannyvee","May 05, 2004"
4.18,2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this hazy golden brew formed and retained pleasant head. The grapefruit and generic citrus aromas were inviting. It's a very transparent brew, with some interesting flavors. The hops are crisp and clear, with grapefruit and citrus notes as dominant - but not obnoxious flavors. There's an understated, but noticeable malt background to balance the flavors. I was impressed by the body of the beer, and will enjoy it again.","AllThingsNinja","Apr 26, 2004"

Aroma is bright floral hoppy with hints of sweet citrus, and some pine. Flavor is a burst of hops, big and bitter, sweet and citrusy. Finishes with a bitter orange peel flourish, and lingers with a piney bite. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation. Nice oily webbing around the inside of the glass.","far333","Apr 24, 2004"
4.55,11,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"The two old guys in their lawn chairs on the label beckoned me to try this IPA, even though it is 45 degrees out (and raining). The smuttynose pours of slightly cloudy apricot color with a medium-thick fluffy off-white head. The aroma is of hops and citrus, predominantly grapefruit, with some underlying pine and floral smells. Not much malt residuals. The taste is wonderful; it is a delightfully intricate balance of the citrus (less pervasive here than in the Dogfish Head 60), some fresh breadiness, and finely textured hops. I savored every moment. The finish is appropriately bitter, and the mouthfeel is right on--medium bodied with just the perfect touch of carbonation. A real winner!","longpondbeerman","Apr 23, 2004"
