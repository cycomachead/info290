"O-  This is really good, but I think it's overhyped.  I'm sure this was a game changer when it made its debut, but at this point there are loads of other IPAs I'd rather drink."

""
"I would like to try it super fresh."
""
"Gold in color with tiny bubbles rising to the surface.  Off white head that froths around the top and settles to a slight layer of bigger bubbles.  Lacing is evident along the edges of glass as it slides down.  Smell is of  pine and some citrus is found in the background.  Tastes of pine, grass, citrus and maybe some bitter hops are dancing on the tongue.  Smooth on the palate and slightly creamy with the bitterness finishing it off.  Overall, a fantastic IPA to indulge upon!"
""
""
"I thought this ale was okay but for the price I was expecting to be knocked out.  In fairness it was about 10 or 11 months old, maybe that left it a bit flat in taste"
""
""
"Awesome IPA! Great go to Beer!"
""
"An excellent I.P.A. Strong piney smell, milder on the palate.  Great all around."
""
""
"For a beer I can find almost anytime, it's rarely missing from my refrigerator."

"Great beer. Everything a beer should be."
""
"Fantastic tasting beer. The best I've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&"
""
""
"T: Fresh cut grass, pine needles, resinous. Grapefruit, sweet and sour citrus: orange, peel, lemon. More sour and tart on my account than bitter."

"As far as west coast single IPAs that you can find on the shelf go, Sculpin is king. There just is not a better option. This beer has a huge citrus aroma, hops a-plenty yet still so smooth and balanced. As the glass goes down and the beer opens up a bit it just gets better and better. Had from a can today with the code 15050, so I think it means it was canned on the 50th day of 2015, so late February. Taste was superb, can't really find fault with Sculpin. This was my first IPA a bunch of years back when my buddy gave me a bomber, now it's a regular!"
"Smoother IPA. Sufficient hoppiness. Pleasant aftertaste."
""
""
""
"This is without question the go to IPA."
""
"I am an IPA drinker mostly that is all I ever drink I just feel like I have had way better before just somthing about this beer never really made me want to go back out and drink it again"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dee-licious. Best IPA I've had out of SD."
""
""
""
"A Solid offering.  I am not a huge IPA guy, I'm a little burned out on the style.  But this is pretty darn good.  I have a few more in fridge.  Perhaps I'll update this review after another brew."
""
"Phenomenally interesting. Bright yet with depth and a pine finish."
"Awesome full-bodied IPA that starts crisp with an incredible citrus aroma and finishes with the perfect amount of bitterness. A real gem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good. Balanced. Nice citrus notes. I don't quite understand all the hype, but it is a very drinkable IPA while still having bold hop flavors."
""
"A very well done IPA with big hop/citrus flavors but not in an overpowering way.  Creamy feel and higher carbonation make this quite drinkable as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer that gives a balanced display of IPA characteristics. This could be an good option for introducing newcomers to hoppier beers."
"It's hard not to love Sculpin. An accomplished IPA which hits all the right notes. The can is more drinkable than it has a right to be, but I slightly prefer the bottle. A bit steep at (typically) $15 per sixpack, but a better value than most cheaper offerings. I have had a few slightly disappointing keg pours, though."
""
""
"Nice smooth taste. Not overly hopped. Drinkable beer."
""
""
"I didn't want to believe the hype, as this is priced at $14.49 for a 6-pack (!) in WI where even the rest of Ballast Point's beers are usually under $10.  However, one sip and it was clear that this is a world class beer worthy of its awards.  Ballast Point recently came to WI, and I was excited to try their beers.  Tried it on draft, and it was supremely balanced and well-crafted in every capacity.  Not the most extreme IPA, but certainly not plain either.  Plenty of citrus and pine hoppiness, but also fresh tasting; substantial without ever seeming too heavy.  One of those IPAs that is just clearly above 95% of a very crowded market."

"I remember this being my first hoppy drink... Didn't like it... Now I can appreciate the bitterness and hops.. Can't have enough of these beers, another solid ballast point beer!"
""
"Poured from a 12oz deeply chilled bottle into a room temperature pilsner glass.  Beautiful golden orange hue with two full fingers of crisp sunshine colored head that lingered.  Beautiful looking beer.  Smells of citrus mainly apricots and peaches with a touch of mango.  Hops are noted.  Tastes much the same.  True citrus dominated ipa.  Really crisp with citrus fruits flavor and subtle hops.  Not piney at all.  Aftertaste is only slightly hoppy.  Must try."
"Wow wow wow. On tap at the Park House.   Refreshingly hoppy and just the right amount of malt. A real treat of an ipa. Another winner from SAN."

"a very solid and very good hop flavor."

"The price is also an issue for me.  $13 a sixer is a bit steep."
"Great beer.  Has aromatics like Two Hearted and Lagunitas.  Great price!   Will drink many more."
""
"Wonderful smooth IPA. Hints of grapefruit.  Good crisp taste and color. Pricy but an excellent beer to be savored"
"This beer is bright, clear, delicious IPA goodness!! It has such a smooth finish to it for a 7% IPA. The hops are fresh and full of citrus, pine, fresh cut grass and other herbal notes but the base malts come through clean and smooth too! Nice balance in this beer so I will purchase again."

"Of course this beer is a great example of the style"

"First sip at Manhattan Beach Bite at the Beach Summer 2014 with Andy, Theresa and Wyeth."

"Extremely balanced, excellent IPA. When people ask what an IPA should taste like, I point them to Sculpin."
"I like it but it seems one dimensional to me. Leaves me wanting more"
""
""
""
"dammit."
"Keg of sculpin ipa drank."
"Now this is a West Coast IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours gold with floral aroma hops. Grapefruit bittering hops with a small amount of sweetness coming through from the malts."
""
""
"Huge head; semi-opaque golden hue; faintly citrus smell; silky and hefty mouthfeel for an IPA; oils are present, but cut by the alcohol; taste is balanced, rather light and not overly-complex.  7% ABV is very present.  Pineapple and melon checked well by the hops."
""
"Love love love it. My go to IPA. Very nice. Also who doesn't like beer with fish on it"
"Not bad ipa. Had in bottle but would recommend on a summer night"
""
""
""
""
"Don't get the buzz with this beer. Too pricey to boot."
""
"Always order one when it is available"
"Not sure where the hype around this one comes from. It's good. It's a very good IPA, but it's not some standout to my taste."
"This beer was really crisp. It's also very fresh tasting. I'm a hop head and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Its a little pricey but it's well worth the experience."

"One of the best west coast IPA's...getting easier to find in the south east now!"

"one of my favorites, though I think the price point is a little high. Would go with Hop Nosh if I have the option."

"Aroma is a Hawaiian plantation (think pineapple) and a Florida citrus grove (think tangerine).  Fluffy head and golden malt color. Flavor is coarse hops, citrus rind, and a touch of dank sativa (though not like the rank, dank sativa flavor of Fat Head's IPA).  Bitter finish. Great West Coast IPA, a terrific ambassador of this style of ale. Alcohol is well-hidden."

"Never heard of this brewery on the east coast, but was intrigued when I saw it on the menu and read such positive reviews on here. Did not disappoint. Very impressed for a 7.5 at how drinkable it was."
"The price is what gets me, it's nothing special at all and it is ridiculously expensive, it's just a basic tasting IPA, I don't recommend it"
""
""
"Great beer, my new favorite.  A little bit of citrus, smooth and not over powering bitterness."
"Lovely aroma and a smooth finish."
"I caught the apricot more than anything, besides the usual hops bitterness, which comes in mostly on the back-end.  A little orange peel and general citrus bite in there as well.  A fairly smooth IPA, reminds me a little of two hearted in the sense that it isn't brutally hop bitter but has that punch softened by some nice fruit bounciness."
"(Draft, revisited) at Lucille's BBQ in Long Beach. Great balance, citrusy smell, hemp/earthy hop underneath. Nice dryish finish. Classic west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall a really nice IPA. But there are several that I like better, and easier to find, so not a priority to get more of this."
"Very floral.  Complex. Better near the end than the beginning.  I don't love it as much as others, but not bad at all."
""
""

"Exceptional west coast IPA....but the Grapefruit version is better by far"
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer. The smell is crisp, piney, and fruity. Huge hops on the taste upfront, followed by tons of grapefruit and then a nice blend of danky, fruity bitterness. Pine tree and grapefruit juice. When fresh, this beer is up there with the bests."
""
""
""

"Overall awesome IPA, great flavor, looks good. Very happy"

"Tons of flavor out of this one. Great color and very crisp. Looking forward to my next two."

"For the past few months, I get out to San Diego for business and stop by Ballast Point Brewing Company (a friend told me to go there and boy am I glad I listened to him!).  He told me to get the Sculpin IPA and I love it right out of the tap.  Great look, smells hoppy and the taste is outstanding!  Found it back home in Illinois now and have the spread the word about this yummy brew!!"
""
""
""
"Gateway beer for those who don't like IPAs. Very fresh, drinkable but with lots of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good hints of all the flavors. Mango, peach and lemon."
""
""
"One of the few best examples of an IPA.  It hits all the right notes, stings when it's supposed to, is fruity and wonderful at the right points as well."
""
"one of the best IPA in the mkt"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: damn good IPA, first time I've been able to try a really fresh one. When fresh, this is one of the best IPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you love spicy this is a great sipper.  Had it on tap at O.C. which was perfect becuase one is just right!"
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, I heard a lot about this beer so I ran to the nearest store to grab a 6er. I was quite disappointed. It's very pungent for an IPA."
"Pale orange in color, smells of mild grapefruit and floral aroma, bitter/spicy like aftertaste with mild carbonation. Goes down smooth. It's very good, but the grapefruit sculpin is better."
""
"One of my favorite year round IPAs."

"great IPA, cant go wrong with this. Very smooth"
"Taking my first sip was what I expected from an IPA, but the finish of citrus notes was an unexpected ending but finished the sip nicely. Definitely a smooth and flavorful body and something I could enjoy through out the night!"
""
"Great delivery with a bad execution"
""
""
"I can quickly think of five lesser ranked beers that taste better than this."
""
""
"Awesome IPA base then add habanero peppers.  Huge Chile flavor with enough spice to make it interesting.  Pair it with tacos, and it makes perfect sense.  It's definitely not a beer you can drink all day, but one you must try if you love spice."
"Fantastic smooth taste in every bottle. Highly recommend!!"
""
""
"Fan frickin tastic! Very sessionable."
""
"For some reason, the first time I tried this beer. I didn't like it at all..... Then I had a Grapefruit Sculpin and loved that!! So then I had a Habanero Sculpin and I really liked that. So then I went to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a Sculpin IPA on tab and loved it!! Go figure...."
""
"I mean, is a review really needed at this point? This is a world class IPA that will stand the test of time. Enough said."
""
"One of the best year round IPA's!"

"Poured from 12 oz can into std pint glass. Nice full fluffy head with medium retention.  Very sticky lacing.  For me this is a fantastically balanced IPA with notes of pine and citrus in the aroma.  The flavor follows beautifully.  Just a hint of astringent bitterness on the back of the palate but overall nice balanced mouthfeel.  This has been in my regular rotation since I first tasted it.  Very disappointed when I get an old bottle or a low turnover draft (I know, how could a keg of this last too long?).  Lives up to the hype."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It was beautiful straight out of the bottle. Perfect amount of head, that left lacing around the edge. The smell was a mix of hops, pine, and citrus. Taste was a bit stronger than the actual IBU listing would suggest but was still fantastic. This beer is damn near perfect."
""
""
""
""
"From 22oz bomber with best by date of 8/25/20. Grapefruit and licorice aromas. Creamy head with good lacing. Citrusy start with bitter hop finish."

"O: Fantastically bright hop aroma and flavor. So glad BP is in WI now I only hope it comes as fresh as this one. I could call this my go-to IPA if it was a couple bucks cheaper, but.. I probably will still have it rotating."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep golden hue with a two finger bright white head. The smell is a citrus bouquet. You get grapefruit,  lemon, kumquat, tangerine. There is also apricot and a hint of peach, plus mild spicy notes. Quite delicious. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely, but it has a faint earthiness, reminiscent of English ipa. This is am no the best single ipas I have tasted. I continue to return for more."
""
"Overall I have had this beer twice now: once in a can and once in a bottle. I actually enjoyed the can a bit better. I feel like it held the carbonation in. This beer is great, but I think it would be even better if the bittering hops were toned down a touch. This would allow the citrus and tropical fruits to linger rather than a more bitter linger. I still want IPA status bitterness, but just a touch less. This beer would go nicely with a a shrimp ceviche and a mango salsa. I give it a 94.5/100."
"Yeah, it's good. Very good. No, excellent. But, 10,777 people rate it a 98? I don't see it."
""
""
""
"Fruity, bitter, and lingering. This is what an IPA should be. There are better out there...but not many."

"Great beer, taste is solid, great balance of flavors. After bite is perfect, such a smooth beer - on my top 5 list."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very good beer, but I wouldn't say its the best IPA I've ever had. It is worthy of a top 10 though."
""
""
""
"Tasty, but quite to overrated West Coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great look great taste. .. Definite winner"
"22oz bomber: This one pours a fairly clear, slightly orangish color. There was a pretty good sized head on it that left some lacing. Nice nose to this one. Pine, earthiness and a hint of grapefruit are the main aromas. Maybe some faint caramel malts and other fruits mixed in. The taste is good. An excellent combination of the different hops. Nice amount of bitterness to it. No residual sweetness from the malts. A very nice IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"The IPA that changed my mind about IPAs. The smell, the taste, the feel, everything about Sculpin is near perfect !! Pine, citrus, hops, delicious !!"
""
""
"Probably my favorite shelf IPA."
"Welcome to Wisconsin.  This will make a nice addition into the usual rotation."
""
"My favorite IPA, too bad they have raised the price so much."
""
""
"Side note: Glass poured from bottle bought at AppleJacks in Wheat Ridge Co."
""
""
"Just an amazing beer. Incredibly refreshing and consistently delicious. I love the citrusy aroma. One of the best beers I've ever had. It presents Itself best on tap but drinks like a charm in any format."

"16 oz. can at Nanny O'Brien's Irish Pub in Cleveland Park, NW D.C.; dated ""14338 18:24""; poured out of the can into a standard pint glass; drank over 30 minutes on Tues., 01/13/2015"
"Great IPA with  nice hint of citrus"
""
""
"Pretty darn good. Very earthy dank and bitter. Good amount of pine. Not really citrus tasting. So darn fresh and tasty. Big down side, too darn expensive. The price is reflected in the Overall category. I usually wouldn’t let something like that reflect my rating, but $16 a six pack is too much money. Easily could be a 4.5 out of 5 if the price was closer to $10 a six pack."
""
""
"Consumed 39 days after date on bottle. This is an excellent beer and my guess is if from tap would be awesome. Super smooth, you never get a bite from this beer. Strong flavors never jump out at you, but settle very nicely in the mouth. Had the grapefruit and habanero recently (both ok), but it's nice to get back to the original. While I really like this beer, I'm surprised by the bro's score of 100. It certainly ranks as one of the top IPAs, though.  Definitely worth whatever you can get your hands on if you are a hopheads."
""
""
"Wow, you have to try it!"
""
""
"wasn't keen on aroma or taste, not bad but not to my taste"
""
"This is a well balanced beer, but nothing really pops for me in this one anymore. I enjoyed the grapefruit variant very much. However I think the price of this standard edition is a bit much when compared to similar offerings."
""
""
""
"I dont like many IPAs but this might just be my favorite beer. Yes, my favorite beer."
""
""
""
"BP just arrived in WI - this was bottled on 1/17 so it's really fresh. Light amber appearance with a nice two finger white head that laces great. Smell is a combination of bready malt and dank, weedy hops. Very nice. Tastes of malt, hop oils, pine, earth and a hint of citrus. Lingers quite long on the palate. Mouth feel is spot as is the carbonation. Overall I like this beer but am not blown away by it. The taste just doesn't live up to the hype and at $15 a 6-pack this will be a ""once in a while"" purchase for me."
""
""
""
"I got this here in Pittsburgh. Not sure how fresh it was, but it was damn good. This beer stays with you in memory. The taste is just fantastic. I would love to be able to try it fresh, I'm sure it would be unbelievable. Expensive here at 20 bucks a sixer."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice golden color with a one finger creamy head, slowly dissolving. Excellent floral nose, hint of citrus. The nose of this is very distinctive. The taste starts slightly bitter and piney but finishes clean. Excellent carbonation for balance and mouthfeel."
""
""
"Didn't do much for me."
""
""
"O: Sculpin IPA is a great beer that is EXTREMELY drinkable. There is big, fresh flavors of citrus hops with a good amount of malt to balance it all out. Pretty much a perfect representation of the style with perfect balance, this is without a doubt one of the greatest IPAs that is readily available. In the small amount of time it took me to write this review, I downed 3 of these beers like it was nothing. They are dangerously, dangerously drinkable. I just kept reaching for more and more until my glass was empty. These are outstanding and without a doubt have just become my new go to IPA!"
"Really weak all the way around"
""
""
"So much flavor and so drinkable. Very nice balance of flavors and perfectly smooth. I would drink this everyday."
""
"A great beer and what I would use as an example of a west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a classic IPA. Not too hoppy, large aromas of fruit. I can drink this anytime. Perfect for any meal and not too rich on flavor and taste. In my top 10 for IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"This ranks near the top of the list for American IPA for me. Poured from a can into a tulip. Nice gold color with copper highlights with 2 fingers of white head. Light lacing. Smells grapefruit, some floral notes. Tastes of citrus, earthy hops, maybe a little peach. Mouthfeel is medium but kind of creamy. Good carbonation with some bite. Well balanced beer, full of flavor. Nice clean hoppy finish. A great beer"
"Overall, a great ""Go To"" IPA."
""
""
"Picked up a pack of this from a local beer store and am very glad I did! Very unique taste. One of the more memorable IPAs I've had."
""
""
"Thank You Sir.....May I have another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells great when it gets a little warmer. Aftertaste is a little stronger than I would like but I think I just found my new favorite beer."
""
"Really like the pine and tropical fruit mix on the nose.  A touch more carbonation than other IPA's which really compliments the snappy hops.  Solid beer!"
"Snagged a growler of Sculpin before word got out.  An exceptional American IPA that is actually fairly easy to get and enjoy."
""
"Very nice brew would highly recommend."
"For a ""west coast"" IPA, Sculpin is about as good as it gets. Pricey as it gets, too! Poured into a snifter, its a beautiful, clear orange/gold in appearance, with a moderate white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass while maintaining a ring around the edges and a sizeable island in the middle. The nose, for me, is largely citrus and tropical fruit over a whiff of biscuity malt. Taste is where it really shines--the citrusy hops are balaced with a piney bitterness (though not too bitter) over a very tastey malt backbone of bread and bisquit, low on caramel. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light on first impression, but leans to medium in the middle and thickens in the aftertaste, which is moderately bitter, in a really good fashion. Carbonation is perfect for the style--meaning high enough to balance and accentuate the hop and malt flavors.Overall, it's my favorite IPA--after Bell's Two-Hearted and Surly Furious. Is it worth the price? On occassion, or at least when I'm feeling flush."
""
"A go to, Great Ipa one of the best."
""
""
"This is amazing. I am just getting into IPA's now and such. And this is AMAZING. One of the best beers I've had. Period. Fruity and mildly bitter that doesn't linger on the tongue. I'll definitely be buying more. I wish the ABV was a little lower so I could session out on it more but the 6 I drank in one sitting was fine lol."
"Overall/Drinkability:  A solidly well done IPA.  Went very well with Sushi (Tuna roll) and I think would pair well with a wide range of food.  Very drinkable and I could easily have had another."
""
""
""
""
"I love the look and nose of this but the taste is just not there for me. Not my favorite style of beer anyway but not close to best ipa."
""
""
"Excellent brew- but not a standout."
""
""
"For me, this beer just has too thick of a maltiness to it.  I prefer IPAs with a lighter body.  Also, the hop flavors don't taste quite as fresh to me as most beers rated this highly.  Still one of my go-to's."
"Update:  Had again, same result, just do not find this one to be amongst the great IPAs."

"Lots of frothy head, translucent amber color. Fresh citrus hops aroma. Decent malt background  but the citrusy piney hops are the showcase here. Medium thick body. A very satisfying west coast IPA - Great paired with a meal."

"On tap served in a pint glass. Golden-orange. Moderate head and resilient lacing. Grapefruit scent. Great citrus hop flavor but with other flavor elements that give it a complex and unique flavor. (I read on the Ballast Point website it has mango and apricot flavor--I couldn't detect those individual flavor elements but they worked well.) Overall: fantastic. Intense hop flavor but doesn't cross the line. (More than once, I've found the bottled version disappoints as compared to the tap.) (9.25)"

"This bottle can't be the freshest as it doesn't have the hop bite I'd expect from a beer with this rating"
"Sculpin has a pleasant honey color with a surprising degree of clarity. A bit lighter and brighter than I expected. Quite a vivacious brew. So much so that I had to pour the can in to an IPA glass in stages, to prevent the foam from spilling over the top. The dense, white frothy head stood at least 3 fingers tall, cresting over the top of the glass by a good margin. Great soapy retention that lingered while gradually revealing pretty lacing. Big sweet citrus hops in the nose. As soon as the can popped open there was a burst of perfume fragrance. A subtle pine cone aroma underlies the zesty citrus. The flavors marry lightly toasted malts with a potent hop character. Despite the enormous hop profile, the bitterness is restrained. They're more of the tropical mango variety with a sweet grapefruit zest. There's a little alcohol warmth, without being distracting. A surprisingly clean finish with only some enduring tropical hop flavor. With a medium mouthfeel and corresponding carbonation this is quite easy to drink. That came as a bit of a surprise given the ABV and bold hop qualities. This is a well-balanced IPA that highlights hops in such a fashion as to give them center stage, but without overwhelming the senses. Big and balanced. I tend to prefer more pine and relish the intense hop bitterness, but this stands out to me for its supreme drinkability. This is an IPA that is accessible to both hop heads and neophytes alike."

"Rich golden color. Smells of hops mild citrus odor. Good hop flavor, well balanced, refreshing flavor finishes slightly bitter. Above average carbonation."
""
"In my opinion, the best IPA that comes in a six-pack."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good West Coast IPA and typical of the style. My main concern is that it's too unbalanced and might benefit from a little more sweetness. Other than that, pretty good."
"Wouldn't bother giving this a try again, but I plan on trying other beers from the brewer soon."
""
"Not world class.  I hoped for world class but I won't even be buying it again.  It's just another IPA.  Maybe they increased production and the magic was lost when I finally got some.  Maybe you need to have it fresh?  I got my 6pack on the East Coast and, overall, I paid too much."

"Great tasting IPA love this beer"
"Recently tried this at one of my favorite pubs in CT this past weekend because the Ghabdi-Bot tap had kicked. My server mentioned he actually preferred it over the NE classic. What I honestly discovered was, in my opinion, an overrated IPA. Poured great but otherwise pretty standard in my book. Not saying it was a bad drink, but it was presented to me in comparison to Ghandi-Bot and that I thought it was far from. I would not go out of my way to seek out again."
""
"Nice aromatic IPA. It was orange, hazy with a foamy, looser head. Lots of hop aroma and flavor. Citrus dominated on each sip. Grapefruit and bitter backbones. There was not too much of a malt presence. Good beer, not exactly balanced, but very nice and appropriately flavored for an IPA."
""
""
"Deep golden pour with frothy head, I've read a lot of mention that the hops deteriorate quickly in this one, so I'll need to revisit. Initial impression was nonplussed. Hops had a slightly skunky aroma amonst citruses which followed into the flavor. Maybe just not my style (west coast) as there are more strongly hopped IPAs out there that I love."
""
"Giving it a fourth try. I this is definitely better than most IPAs out there that I have tried. Really hoppy with light malt"
""
""
""
"really good ipa, love the hop selection"
""
"one of my favorite IPA's"
""
"This is as close to perfect as any beer I've ever tried."
"Just about the holly Grail of IPA's!!!"
"Nose and notes of apricot, peach, mango, grapefruit, and other citrus flavors. Plenty of hop punch, but incredibly balanced and smooth. One of my favorite IPA's for sure."
""
"On tap at http://www.vintage-eats.com/ New Market MD."
""
""
""
"O--Very, very well done IPA.  Loving the tropical fruit forward hops.  At 7 % these are a little dangerous.  I considered opening one and letting it sit for a while to reduce the carbonation though, but aside from that this is a winner every day of the week and twice on Sunday."
""
"Great color, golden light yellow.  Light body for IPA with beautiful, smooth hops.  Very drinkable for non-IPA lovers."
""
"O - Realistically this is my go to as it's available in 6 pack cans for $14.  Easy to find for me here in the Boston area, always great.  With all of the world class beers here in New England (quite a few a little better and by a little I mean slightly)  I always go back and compare them to Sculpin. My staple go to beer.  Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a solid beer when it's fresh it's glorious but this beer tends to fall off quickly. The one I'm drinking now is headed toward that but is still highly drinkable right now. "
"I found the hopping a bit too aggressive."
""
""
"All round this beer is what I think of when you talk West Coast IPA's. Clean hop smell, not over powering, great color, a great taste with a smooth finish with just enough bite."
""
"Very good IPA. Fruity and drinkable, not too bitter. Really surprisingly smooth. Delicious"
""
""
"Great, easy drinking ipa.  Nice smell, lots of hop flavor, definitely a good one. A bit high priced at $15 a six pack in MD, but worth a try."

""
""
""

""
""
"I understand the hype around Sculpin now. A really great IPA that manages to tick so many things people look for in a ""perfect"" IPA. Wouldn't be much of a sin to simply call it a perfect IPA actually."
"Pours rich copper with a thick head and lingering lace. Smell is almost all hops, with a smack of citrus. Taste is predominately hoppy, would have guessed this was dry hopped. Some citrus notes, but definitely overshadowed by the intense fisting of hops. Overall a very drinkable, possibly my new go to IPA."
"Wow. This is an outstanding IPA. The most recognizable smell and flavor is apricot followed by an taste of grapefruit on the backend. There is a wonderful balance between sweetness and bitterness. Delicious and drinkable and my favorite at the moment."
""
""
""
"Fresh in cans. Generally not as good in bottles - less dry hops noticed."

"O - This is a great IPA. But definitely not something I would give to someone new to IPAs, as it is 100% an ipa. There is no crossover with this.. Very enjoyable right off the bat; for me it's strong points are in the nose and head. The aromas shine through and the head makes this an enjoyable downer or sipper. All in all, I probably will pass on this again. Mainly because in 2015 I feel this is an outdated beer and there are better, unique ones out there. Definitely a must have though if you've not had it."
""
""

""
""
""
"O - Beer almost never travels well, but it's obvious this is a remarkable beer, and I can't wait for the opportunity to try it fresh when I'm next in California!"
""
""
""
"Could be the best IPA I've ever had."
""
""
""
"One of the best standard IPAs I've had. Crisp. Fresh. Strong hops, but not by any means too much, in my opinion. This is my ""go to"" IPA."
""
"Great balanced flavours, again there's a mix of sweet clean malt and piny, resinous hops. Some spicy notes as well. Superbly balanced, very drinkable."
""
""
"O - A fine West Coast IPA. The pure orange and clementine citrus flavors are oh so enjoyable and make for a world-class beer experience summer or winter."
"I first drank this lovely at Stone in Escondido in 2007. At the time I was blown away by the citrus forward aspect of this beer. A couple of years later I toured the brewery just before this beer blew up in the national sense. We had a personal tour and were told they were putting 7 varieties of hops in each batch. The expen$e to make this ale was considerable.  Thus the addiction began. I believe that, with my uncle, we put this beer on the map on the East coast because we were drinking at least a pallet/year. I have a set of garage doors nailed with thousands of caps to prove our consumption!! But what happened? As they grew this brew dropped off. I remember that on our West coast visit they were expanding tankage to outside fermenters. I believe this and hop shortages/prices changed this beer. Pliny on tap on the East coast, at least at Monk's, is close to what you taste in Santa Rosa. I can't say the same for Sculpin. Like a first love, she always fades with time. Thus the toying with grapefruit, kiwi, habaneros, etc to cover up the loss of what made this beer unique.  Ballast boys- get back to the basics and make less so that we have ""more""!"
""
"Drink fresh! Nom nom nom."
""
"O - It's my first time drinking Sculpin and it reminds me of Fatheads Headhunter."
""

"It is hard to beat a solid, sublimely complex IPA like this one. Deftly balanced across the sensory spectrum, this brew drinks easily and completely satisfies. Must...find...more..."

"One of my favorite IPAs. Tasted from bottle, can and growler pour, and absolutely delicious. It's a light copper color with a few fingers of head. Scents of citrus and pine. Taste is balanced, but definitely demonstrates that pleasant hoppiness you expect in a top IPA. Perfectly carbonated and a dry finish. A must for any true IPA drinker."

"When you consider all of the IPA's regularly available in northern California including the most famous regularly available (although in limited supply) brew (nod nod, wink wink), I believe this tops them all. Having consumed these top IPA's numerous times and side by side, I have come to the conclusion that Sculpin tops them all. A rare combination of all that hoppiness has to offer in a very drinkable brew. Many may consider this a very hop forward beer but in the spectrum of what is out there these days, Sculpin offers a hop experience that is flavorful and very smooth. Best of the class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Few issues.  1 there is no bottle date.  this really irritates me, especially on IPA's.  2.  I get very little hops in this beer.  I don't know if that is how it is intended to be or if they have faded over time.  I did enjoy this, but I definitely doesn't live up to the hype.  since there is no bottle date I will be reluctant to try it again unless i know it is fresh."

"I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is too strong (think next morning...) but I'd give this beer a 5.0 rating for cooking. Risotto and American IPA? The perfect match, and my first choice for an ""additive"" is currently this beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I'll have several other really good beers, then I will be lucky and find fresh Sculpin, and nothing beats it. That's the one issue with Sculpin. Basically impossible to tell it is fresh with no clear bottled on date. I'll give you all a tip who haven't had it before, it should be very pleasant citrus flavors, but not overpowering. If there is a metallic smell or taste of any kind, it is not fresh and take it back to your retailer."

"Pours an orange color with a white 1 finger head. Lots of citrus and pine aroma, which matches the taste. They weren't going for balance here, this is meant to be a bitter flavor explosion but without going overboard. Lingering hop bitterness. Big mouthfeel for an IPA, perfectly carbonated. I absolutely loved it, and wish it was available in the Utah distro area."

"22 oz Bomber.This has a very nice taste of grapefruit with slight lemon.Very Hoppy beer.Solid IPA with a solid 7.0ABV.This is one of the better IPA`s out there.I noticed that just about all the Ballast Point beers are coming out in cans now.Makes it alot easier if you are going on a picnic or other outing.If you haven't tried this one you owe it to yourself if you like IPA`s."

"Really, this beer is not good.  Aftertaste is like fish, its namesake.  Not crisp, not refreshing, not sessionable like a west coast IPA.  I don't know how it even falls in this class.  Its bad fruity with a bad aftertaste."

""

""

"Sculpin has 3 things that play against it: One, no obvious freshness date, which reveals an inconsistency of product.  I honestly forget what good, fresh Scupin tastes like.  I'm sure it was good, but cmon, get a freshness date clearly marked on your bottle so I don't have to fuck around.  Second, it's way overpriced compared to Bell's Two Hearted Ale, and the Noda Hop, Drop & Roll, which are IPA staples,  and competing for my business for that style in my area.. Third, when you have other fresh beers that are very good, and this one isn't fresh, your taste buds begin to tell you that the other's are better, even if they may not be all things being equal fresh Sculpin vs. fresh Two Hearted vs. fresh Hop Drop. You guys need to fix this. I already complained about this, and received free beer, but the issue has still not been rectified."

"It was hard not to rate this a '5', but considering the fact that I've never rated anything a five on the ground that-that would require some sort of undefined perfection, i had to settle - unwittingly - with 4.75.  This beer is phenomenal!  I had it at some random sports bar with a mixed crowd and velvet couches, but I was happy to get lost in my active enjoyment of the beer over gorgeous flatscreens showing two super exciting, MAJOR, college football upsets at the bar - it was easy too.  Many people have rated this meticulously and eruditiously on the quality of it's various elements, but let me tell you, this beer is all ""emotion and feel;"" no need to quantify the greatness of this beer."

"11/04/13 From bottle at home. Very mellow for a renowned IPA. By the power of suggestion (reading the company blurb) I detect hints of mango, peach & faint citrus which all add up to a well thought out blend. Deserves the rep."

"O: [3.50] I have had this on tap and my recollection was that it was better.  This is only 2 months old, and was kept refrigerated - but it feels like it lost a step.  The piece that seems faded is a little citrus and some of the balance.  I like this beer (especially on tap) and I will drink it again.  But I would definitely rank this lower than the tap version."

"The best thing about this beer is the smell. Mrs. Cox said it smelled like grapefruit and if grapefruit were actually heavenly, that would be true. And, if grapefruit actually tasted heavenly, it would be true about the taste, too. The feel is soft and nice (oh yeah, that made sense). Lovely stuff."
""

"Nice bitter brew but not sure it's really worth the high price tag ($19/6pk)."
""
""

"Pours a deep golden amber with a medium off white head, light lacing. Aroma is a citrus grapefruit hops with a very good sweet caramel malt character. Taste is sweet caramel malt followed by some good citrus hops with some very good grapefruit tangy notes. A medium bodied brew has a smooth mouth feel and moderate carbonation, easy on the palate and taste buds. The finish is a well balanced combination of caramel malt and citrus hops with a bit of lingering grapefruit tangy flavor. Overall a solid, very good, tasty and enjoyable IPA"

"This is my favorite IPA."

"Wow. I understand why this beer is rated so highly now that I have finally tried one. Unlike many IPAs which are very citrus and flowery, this contained notes of darker fruits. Well balanced and clean, this is an expertly crafted brew. What a nice change from the average IPA! Definitely will buy again."

"O - The first of these I drank probably was a touch hop-faded.  The second time was more robust hop citrus.  The beer is a bitter one, with only the slightest malt line, but the open is so lively, you keep wanting to take another drink."

"Great IPA.  A lot going on with the aromas and taste.  Well balanced with a nice lingering finish.  One of my all-time favorites in this category."
"O: Excellent brew.  An incredible number of notes and nuances.  I know its probably common on the West Coast, and even in specialty shops all over the US, but I was thrilled to find it in Asheville, NC.  Unheard of in China, where I brought it to and am now drinking it.  Drank Sept 22nd, 2014, from a can."

Maybe it was years ago, but these days there are many, many similar IPAs that are just as awesome. Unfortunately, the hype machine got a hold of this one and caused the prices to inflate ($7.50 bombers, $12+ sixers, c'mon). Regardless, this is a damn good beer."

"What can I say but to affirm the masses here.  A spectacular beer and WC IPA.  One of the best I have drunk- reminds me of Red Racer cans. The beer is bright, balanced, and bitter. Great finish and great piney grapefruit esters.  A benchmark beer and of of my best beer-drinking experiences of 2014.  Thank you Papa!"

"Very prominent tropical fruit notes. The hops are present in the smell and at first taste. At 7% it is extremely easy to drink four of these without getting overwhelmed. I would say that this beer borders an APA and an IPA. Great tasting beer. Although fairly new to the hops game, I place this one in my top 5 beers to drink."

"About as good as an American IPA can get.  Looked like, smelled like and tasted like an awesome IPA. Can't ask for much more."

"Ballast sculpin. Pours copper color big foam and lacing. Subtle grapefruit nose  and citrus. Surround of bitter with a light sweet malt below. Lemon rind bitter finish. All good. 4 4 45 4 425"

"Amazing. A truly great IPA that doesn't mess around. Appearance is a dark yellow/orange with a thin head that trails the glass. The smell is an explosion of hops. The taste is the same with a ton of amazing hop flavor, really fresh and crisp with pine and grapefruit notes coming through. Would highly recommend for any hop heads to grab a bottle."

"It is difficult to identify specific tastes and aromas because the Sculpin is perfectly balanced; it doesn't scream bitter, hops, or citrus, yet all elements are undoubtedly present.  The only thing that does not impress is the label design which is somewhat craft-conventional given the Sculpin's quality. Overall impression: an aristocratic IPA that proves any discussion on beer meccas must include San Diego."

"Delicious! This is the best IPA I've had so far….. Fairly new to the whole thing so that's not saying a whole lot, but I'm guessing by how highly rated it is It's one of the better ones out there. Lots of citrus and pine flavors, a little more sweetness to counter balance the hop bitterness, which is nice. Overall, smooth, beautifully balanced, and packs just the right amount of bite, while still incredibly drinkable and refreshing. I will buy this again and again and again!!!"

"Pours a golden amber with a thin, fizzy head and thick lacing. Smell is of citrusy hops, pine, and sweet malt. Taste is strong citrus hops, fruity sweetness and a bitter bite at the finish. There is an undercurrent of bready malt. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and definitely sticky with hop resin. This is an excellent substitute for Pliny the Elder when it's not available. The two beers are on par with one another."
""
""
""
"Overall - one of my favorite IPAs. If you want more hops to totally dominate your mouth, then maybe this is nit your jam. But with the right good this beer is magical."
"Just about my all time favorite IPA. What can I say to start it off... Its juicy, floral, fresh and crisp. Ballast Point truly made a world class beer. The nose has pleasant notes of lemon, tangerine, peach and pine. It is floral and light with fresh hints of melon, honey, and many citrus flavors that all come together with a crisp bite and a dry, yet juicy finish. I always look for that special beer which hits me as a masterpiece keeps me coming back to get more and more. Sculpin IPA truly fills that title. To me, its perfect. It is a testament to what creativity and experimentation can produce. Give it a try."

"O: This beer surprised me. At a reported 70IBU's I was expecting a bit of a bitter finish. This beer is SMOOTH. The bitterness is balanced extraordinarily well with the hop aroma and comes on slowly in the finish. It has a nice Malty backbone and a pleasant and very evident citrusy, lemon quality that survives through the finish. This is a well crafted IPA. The hops are the star but the malt isn't pushed aside. It has it's own little identity. Truly one of my favorite IPA's... ever."

"One of the best IPAs being brewed. Fresh, this beer is one of the best beers available. If you've never had it, at least try a single of it. Yes it's pricey but its worth More than every penny. Truly a world class India Pale Ale. Although since it's brewed in San Diego, freshness of this beer is paramount, especially considering I'm writing this from New England."

"Ballast Point Sculpin is listed by many as a great beer. I am often times leery of mass approval of anything, with that in mind I gave this IPA a try. it was poured into a pint glass and did have a very pleasing light color for an IPA. The aroma was strong but not overpowering and when I took the first sip, I realized many voters are just towing the party line. I like IPAs but I get the since many of these brews are made the ""drier"" the better and to me that takes away from savoring the flavor. I would drink it again but I don't consider this a fantastic brew. I prefer Ballast Point's Wahoo White which I consider to be an excellent brew. But for the craft beer aficionado this beer would be well worth a sample beer or two to see if it is your cup of tea (so to speak)"

"O: This is one lovely beer. It's on my top 5 IPAs and earned a lot of expect from me for Ballast Point brewery. If someone wanted me to suggest an IPA, I think this is the perfect blueprint of the type. It's not overpowering and too bitter like some heavy IPAs or doubles, the alcohol level is high but reasonable, the flavors mingle perfectly and it has a wonderful balance of carbonation, sweetness, bitterness and virtually no unpleasant aftertastes. Big big props to Ballast Point on this award winner."

"Glass- shaker pint"

"Poured from can into willy glass. A slightly hazy golden-copper color with a thin head that persists. Aroma is a blast of floral, dank, piney hops...it's wonderful. Taste is also dank and floral mixed with some caramel and butterscotch. The bitterness lingers offsetting the fairly malty backbone. Mouthfeel is great....carbonation that lasts and a silky smooth texture throughout. Overall, this is a great IPA, worth picking up even considering the $15/6-pack."

"A hazy orange in the glass with a nice quarter inch foamy head that lingered. Punch on the nose, of citrus. Tastes of grapefruit and pine. Some malty notes and a hint of alcohol. Feels heavy, a beer to drink one of, not make a session of. present but subdued bitterness. For me a really good, but not spectacular IPA. Will drink again."
"Pours a nice yellow beer, with a nice head. Stays foamy for a while. Aroma from the bottle is faint. Taste is good, bitter, hoppy, a bit sweet. This beer has light body, easy to drink. This one could be had more than once."

"Had this originally rated as a 4.75.  I have since revised it due to the fact that I can ALWAYS find it at my favorite beer store.  Compare this against several other (5) rated beers (PTE, HT), which seem to come around less frequently than the comet known as Haley."
"O- Best served fresh so pay attention to bottle dates. Excellent IPA and always consistent. One of the best year-round and available IPAs on the market. Hard to go wrong with this one and it's definitely an old faithful of mine."

"This is my favorite beer to date! Today is my birthday and on Friday I'm taking off work to hit up the brewery down in San Diego. This has to be the IPA that helped San Diego reach it's claim to fame. Perfect taste and 7% to boot! The perfect beer for a beer tasting, kicking with some friends, or even for a raging weekend night."

"O - With every sip, Sculpin inches it's way up the favorites list. This is the only beer I've had from Ballast Point so far, and I ould be interested to see what else they. Have. I would recommend this without question, especially to those new to IPAs - it would be a great introduction."

"I've had this a few times before, but decided to review it this time. What can be said that hasn't already been said? Either way, Sculpin is an exceptional IPA and a fine example of the work that Ballast Point is doing. The taste is full of fruit flavors (mainly peach, lemon, and grapefruit), complemented by a piney hop finish. The flavor is intense, but the malt keeps it from being overpowering. Additionally, It's listed as 7.0% abv, but you'd never guess it. The only downside is that it is a little on the pricey side--I guess you get what you pay for."

"O) A very fine IPA. I'd gladly drink this regularly if it were around these parts. Especially in some cans. Glad to recommend."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 7, 2014."
""
""
"Lots of different hops merging to create a memorable IPA. Layering of hops makes it bold complex and flavorful but not so hoppy as to overpower you. Beautiful light clear amber color. Slight head and minimal lacings. At 7% above - just the right amount of intensity. A very tasty and drinkable IPA. It's a ""can't miss"" for all IPA and Pale Ale lovers. Definitely recommend."

"I've come across some very interesting things here after having Stone and Ballast Point. What I've found is that Stone is much more in your face with their beers, and styles, whereas Ballast Point is more subtle, and a little more balanced. I prefer the Sculpin to the regular Stone IPA, but the Stone Enjoy By's are the best I have had."

"Picked up a six pack of cans because of the buzz I've heard about it. Yes they had bottles but I'm a sucker for a can of beer. Smells really clean and floral and so smooth. Not overly bitter and I think rather than trying to pack as much hops into the can as they could, Ballast was more focused on creating a solid drinkable IPA. Mission accomplished. At 7% it may not be a great session beer (unless you're Irish like me) but one or two is good for circulation"

"Talk about flavors! Couldn't quite figure them out until I read the hop varieties in this one. Mango, pineapple, lemon, pear, grapefruit, and some piney notes. Pretty much the best IPA I can get here in houston. This is my go to special occasion IPA ! Really enjoying their selection of brews!"
""

""
""
""
""

"I love you Sculpin."
"O - I drink this beer a lot. It being a local beer, still kind of pricey averaging a 6 pack at $12.99-$13.99 (on sale). I've had it old and fresh this being a fresh review. Like any other IPA an older bottle will lose a lot. That being said, this is a winner and one that holds a candle up to some of the more world class IPAs that cannot be found in 6 packs. For that reason, I can justify the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good IPA, however, perhaps overrated."

"This American IPA pours an amber off orange, darker than expected~ Moderate white head, lots of bubbles~ Nose of pines, flowers, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, oranges and maybe some mango~ Feel is medium, yet very sticky and dry, yet also silky and smooth~ Taste is what an IPA should be, bitter and sweet~ Grapefruit, Pine, Orange, Pepper, Grass, Mango, Apricot, Honey, Lemon, Bready and Earthy~ I have to give it huge points for being so complex, I do like that it starts one way and ends in a total different direction~ Yet I feel this leaves a bit of an odd after taste for me, This is a highly touted brew, maybe that's why I feel a bit let down?Although good and smooth at 7%ABV, factor in the price at $15 a six'er and it leaves me wanting a little more for my money~ Overall: 8.4"

"I've updated my rating to reflect my several experiences with this beer. The first time I had it in the bottle and it was very good and perhaps more fresh. I've since had a few bottles that weren't very good and some fresh cans that were just good. Still a good IPA but not worth the price."

"If I am ever on deathrow, and I am allowed a last meal and can choose the beverage- I want a fresh bottle or can of Sculpin to be my drink. I grabbed a six pack of cans locally with a canned date of 5-20-14- just over two weeks old. The first six pack of Sculpin I had was about 3 months old, and boy was there a difference. The fresh Sculpin was the best ipa I have ever had. It was crisp and clean with the perfect notes and bitterness. West coast IPAs- fanfreakingtastic."

This should be in every bar across america. Pretty much perfect and dont really see this improving. World class indeed"
""
"Poured from can into tulip glass. Very nice golden color. Good 1-1.5"" head. Awesome smell. A citrus, hoppy, piney smell. Get a hint of grapefruit. Tastes just like how it smells. Delicious. Great feeling in the mouth. Not a long lasting or overly bitter aftertaste. Nice carbonation. This is near the top of my list. Great beer."
"o. My young son insisted I buy this beer, which I knew nothing about, because of the cool fish on the bottle. To my surprise when I looked the beer up on BA, it was a 98. When I tried it this evening, it delivered. I would highly recommend having children who like fish - er- this beer."
"Overall, continues to be a readily-available and stellar -- if not world-class -- IPA. Just wish it were more affordable on the east coast."

"O: It's a very outstanding beer. It gives the expected ""IPA experience"" very nicely. I would drink it again. It provides a good staple IPA when looking for something to drink. I will say that I've had other IPA's that have a fresher smell and flavor from the bottle. That's the main thing keeping me from rating it a perfect. I'm drinking it 51 days after it was bottled, and I purchased it from a store that uses refrigerated storage, so it should be fairly fresh. Keeping that in mind I would buy other beers that I know I can get fresher. I don't want to make any of this sound negative, it's just something I wanted to add for my own future reference. The beer is outstanding."

"Deep orange with a big 3 finger white head and lots of lacing as you drink. Big citrus, mostly grapefruit notes, accentuated by peach and apricot giving this a largely fruity nose. Taste delivers, with some nice grapefruit bite, peach and mango all tied together with a sweet almost graham cracker malt bill. It finishes slightly bitter, but not nearly as much as expected. Very pleasing clean finish. Medium mouthfeel that's just spot on with carbonation. Great IPA that deserves its place toward the top."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am really pleased with this creature. It's a major step up from Big Eye, and for something that's available year round, a real standout. I'll certainly be looking to try it on tap if I can find it--since I might expect a more spicy experience that could be a treat with whatever food I was out to get at the same time."
""
"I had this after a series of double IPA's but it still held its own. Albeit in a slightly lower abv way. This ale had a nice head, excellent aroma, and great mouthfeel. There was an easy drinkability to this IPA. There was more bitterness than sweetness present but it was definitely in balance. Would definitely drink this one again."

""
""
""
""
"I decided to try this beer on a weekend trip to the Adirondacks. After a long day of snowboarding on whiteface the colorful fish on the labelled beckoned with the promise of a unique experience far from wherever the contents of the bottle had been brewed. With the beer poured into a lovely pint class I was able to appreciate the copper color and slight head. The aroma consisted of enlivening hops and floral notes and the brew had refreshing bitter qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malt seems thoughtful, but this beer is all about the hops. Layer upon layer of bitterness. Complex but not overcrowded. Smell and taste is spice, with some pine, and citrus. Finish is loooong and bitter. Can't wait to give it a shot out of the can."
""
""
"Finish: The creaminess stays on my tongue while the hop tartness hits the back of my throat. It doesn't linger overly long."
""
"O: outstanding, my favorite IPA that readily accessible. This IPA I think should be the standard with which most IPA today should be judged. IPAs aren't my favorite style, I know I'm crazy, but this beer is just phenomenal."

"Overall... I respect it and understand the great reviews... but since I am not partial to IPA's, it's hard for me to love it... but I do get why its praised"

"My opinion of Sculpin? I don't know what the hype is about. In fact, I wouldn't buy it again. Especially for $16 for a 6 pack. It's actually a really good, really smooth, really flavorful beer. Until about 5-10 seconds after it goes down. Then that aweful, bitterness overcomes the mouth and has you cringing, waiting for it to pass until the next sip. But the bitterness just never leaves. It's a beer that COULD be amazing, but the bitter after-taste is completely off-putting. I love a super hoppy ale...but Im not a bitter fan. Give me fresh, springy, whole cone hops in abundance. But the ale better be complete with a fresh, crisp finish. This beer doesnt fit my bill. If you're a fan of bitter IPAs, then this beer is for you. But in my opinion, theres nothing world class about it - at all. Mye I've got used to the more malty backbones of DIPAs like Dirt Wolf, 90 minute IPA, etc. Although I'd even rank Southern Tier's IPA well ahead of this. Because its springy and hoppy, without being bitter and hard to finish. I might rate this offering slightly higher if at had a little more abv, at least I could start to feel good while choking it down. But I don't see what the hype is. It's an okay beer, but if you never had it, you wouldn't be missing much."

"Funny I remember this carrying much more piney dankness but this bottle was much more citrus. Definitely a solid IPA. 7% abv, fairly light bodied and dry makes this a solid go to pretty much any time. Some just as good or better ones out there less than the price point though."

The head when you pour it does not over-flow, and there is no stale taste to it by any means. If you are looking for perfection in an IPA this beverage is for you."
""

"Clear golden pour, with just a touch of amber, coupled with a very nice head and long lasting lacing. The nose is a complex blend of grapefruit, mango and other sweet tropicals against a subtle spruce. Light medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is a touch above normal. The outstanding flavor profile is expertly complex and follows the nose. Grapefruit leads then flows into the sweeter hop flavors. In the middle the biscuit malt comes through against a subtle spruce flavor. The finish effervesces into a grapefruit bitter tartness over a caramel sweetness. This is an outstanding complex hop flavor bomb."

"The Verdict: Delicious. One of the smoothest and well balanced IPAs I’ve ever had. I don’t know if my tongue could handle a fresh one from the brewery."

"Half inch thick of frothy white head. Light copper hue with good clarity. Nowhere as bitter as the DirtWolf I just had. The aroma is a balanced play of pine like hops and light malt backbone. Mouth is thick and sticky. The taste is a nice balance of pint like hops and light malt backbone. The bitterness is picking up as it warms. Nice!"

"I've been up and down with this beer.. The first time I had it, it blew my mind..the second time I had it was in Vermont and it tasted very flat .. AND the third time I had it, it wasn't flat but it didn't have that nice hoppy IPA taste as the first time.. I think if you can find this beer fresh it's a top of the line beer but in my experience I was 1 for 3.."

"O- Overall a great beer. I may have to incorporate this into my top 5 beers. Great IPA."
"Bought a bottle at a local liquor store. This beer poured with a yellowish-gold appearance, though I noticed a little amber when I brought it up to the light. Also, the beer had a mushy, medium-sized head with patchy lacing on the side. Very rich aromas mixed with citrus flavors, like grapefruit, and plant tastes like pine and herbs. These aromas were quite good in the sense that were balanced: nothing too strong, but very noticeable. Good taste of citrus, like lemon and orange, as well as malts and hops. Loved that lingering bitterness that came with every sip. Great, crisp mouthfeel that makes this beer refreshing, while not being a watered down drink. Overall, this was one heck of an IPA!"
""
"First review on the site and first time trying this Pale Ale from Ballast Point. Very refreshing taste w/ nice citrusy aroma. Great introduction to the company and a very smooth India Pale Ale compared to others I've had. As a newer beer advocate I've definitely tried to find more and more of the site's 250 and this does not disappoint. Fully deserving of its ranking and will definitely purchase again and again."
""
""
"This is an amazing IPA. It pours a beautiful gold with a nice white head. Wonderful citrus flavors from the hops and a nice mouth feel. If you are a hop head you can't go wrong with this beer. The bottles and cans are filtered. I've had an unfiltered version on draft in San Diego that is superb."
""
""
""
""
"O: Hands down my favorite IPA. Didn't know I don't enjoy pine from hops until this beer; their absence is very welcome! Not super harsh like other IPA's despite the respectable 70 IBU's, and I'm a fan of the unique array of fruit esters present. If I can find 6-packs (which should be more economical) this will become a go-to!"
""
""
"What a great beer. I gotta buy more of this one and will stock it my fridge. Excellent balance and very, very drinkable."
""
""

"Poured a beautiful, clear, amber color to a tall, thick head, slowly settling to a creamy collar and leaving nice lacing. The aroma was big and hoppy less grapefruit and citrus to me though and more spicy, floral notes. The taste followed suite with some nice malty sweetness at first but quickly transitioning to spicy, floral hops with hints of pine and citrus rind. The finish is very dry and smacks of American bittering hops. Medium carbonation and body fit for style and keep the beer light and refreshing. Overall an excellent IPA, although much more floral and spice than the fruity citrus I was expecting from reading other descriptions (not a fault, just surprised)."

"IMO, this is no better than old school caramelly New England IPA with just a little bit drier finish. Hop character was weak and grassy, no citrusy/tropical fruit flavors. Draft has been inconsistent too - sometimes boozy and thin, sometimes decently hoppy, sometimes malty. What the heck happened to that juicy hop bomb like when it first came to the boston area in bombers? I think I'm about done with this beer as I am with GF WC IPA - two beers ruined by increased production."

"A translucent, golden body lurks beneath an inch of foamy, pure white head that lingers briefly before settling to a scant dusting across the surface of the liquid; minimal strands of lacing coat the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit and orange with a fresh pine punch. Some grass, herbs, and wet earth fill out the middle with a lemony zest towards the end. It tastes similar, with some large citrus notes up front that readily fade to a muddled, earthy center. Bitter hops give way to a soapy aftertaste on the finish, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is thinner than anticipated, but well carbonated. Refreshing throughout with a dry finish. Overall, a solid IPA that I thoroughly enjoy. While there are plenty of new options available today, this one remains a staple and a great example of the style."

"Served fresh from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is nice orange haze with lots of lacing that seems to linger. Smell is fresh fruit but not that strong. Would like more punch. Taste is fresh but again not that aggressive. Mouthfeel is average and overall, I believe the first time I tasted it must have been stale as this experience was delicious."

"4.26/5.00"
""
""

"Had a bottle pours a golden orange with off white lacing. Amazing smell of citrus and piney resins. The taste is a balance but lends more to bitter than fruity citrus. More grapefruit than orange but an outstanding IPA nonetheless. Leaves me craving more"
""
""
"pours solid orange, lot of white head. almost looks bottle conditioned. aromas are subtle but pleasant, citrusy, bitter, tart, grainy. flavors are perfectly balanced and drinks like a 5% beer with tons of flavor. hops perfectly balanced not overly bitter or lingering"
""
""
""
""
""
"There beer has stood up with my re-review. One of the best beers you can get on the shelf. One of my favorite IPAs ever and blows me away that it's a simple ""shelf beer."" Drink this beer more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty IPA, I only wish I could find a bottled on date to know how fresh this beer is. Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Great beer, very hoppy, more hop then citrus. a MUST TRY for IPA lovers. The overall feel from it is very hoppy upfront, and smooth citrus in the back. Beautiful soft color betrays the mouthful of flavor. The citrus notes are in the smell and tail end of the taste, but this is definitely overwhelmingly a hoppy beer... in a great way!!"
""
""
""
"Sculpin is a clear blood orange beer with a strong light brown foamy head. On the nose it's sweetness and hops are not too strong, not to weak but just right. It's taste follows it's nose, with a wonderful grain finish that comes later in the drink. This smooth refreshing beer is unique in it's just right balance and is a good option for a new IPA drinker and a nice change of pace for the hardened one. Definitely a must drink for the beer advocate."
""
""
"Drinkability: Very tasty and drinkable. I love the art and the tone it sets with the beer. A tough IPA with big hops."

"12 oz can poured a a beautiful bright golden elixir that omits a a finger or two of fluffy off-white head that is quick to dissipate however leaves a delicate foam lacing in the glass. The aroma is captivating with scents of citrus and hops and slight spice at the back of the nose. While the aroma is captivating the taste is addictive, a magnificent blend of bitter hops, citrus, bready malts, and a earthy over tone make for a fantastic beer. The beer has just the right mix of medium body and carbonation to enjoy from beginning to end. Overall I wish this was readily available to me on the east coast, but for now I will enjoy it often during my 6 weeks in beautiful sunny Southern California."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I get why this beer is popular and highly rated, but it doesn't quite work for me in the same way. My personal favorite IPAs have more maltiness, and an overall better balance. If you like your IPAs bitter and then more bitter, you'll probably like this a bit more than I did."

"I am nuts about Sculpins little brother, Big Eye, so I have been waiting on Brewforia here in Boise to tap into the Sculpin. Poured bright into a 12 oz glass. Head in moderation, carbonation delicate. Aroma like slicing a grapefruit in half- fresh, clean,inticing. Mouth feel- the Sculpin is break dancing on my palette. Of course grapefruit, tangerine,floral oils, but not nearly as fluent as Big Eye. This beer is bold yet exquisite what ever that means in beer,I guess in your face good. Finishes like a world glass IPA should, balanced, complex ,mystifies the taste buds. Hats off again to Ballast Point. Great beer. Cheers!"

"O. Thank you for suggesting this one beer man! It's easy to drink, refreshing on a hot day in San Antonio"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very good IPA in the classic definition. In today's age of complex multi-tiered flavoring, this hardens back to the old standard IPA brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer goes down incredible easy, has a nice flavor and nose profile (although neither are quite as pronounced as I would like) and an excellent mouthfeel. In my opinion the beer doesn't live all the way up to its hype, but it's still something I'd seek out again."
"This is good. I've had several bottles now and I enjoy this one the most, but it's not to the point of the current mean (4.41). Also I can do just as enjoyable for less cost."
"O: An excellent IPA, made by brewers with excellent taste in hops. Great from a can, best when poured from a bottle (or maybe a fresh can)."
""
"The pale amber color and a clear body were typical of the West Coast style of IPA. The smell was a mix of pine and grapefruit, with some tangerine thrown in too. Taste was spicy, piney, bitter, and out-freaking-standing. Just exactly what a juicy IPA should be. Medium body and a slippery mouthfeel fit the style perfectly. A bit of sugary sweetness in the finish to complement the bitterness. Drinkable beyond words, Can I have another please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - Yum! If you love citrus-forward IPAs you will love Sculpin. Unfortunately, this ale is priced out of the ""everyman"" budget; $10.99 for a 22oz bomber---Please!"
""
""
""
""
"I gave a bottle of Scuplin to my friend, whom never had it before, and he commented to me the next day that it was like this giant pint of grapefruit. That sums up why Scuplin is one of my favorites. There are plenty of IPAs with hop additions and grains that are similar to Scuplin, but never quite hit the bullseye like Scuplin. It really nice West Coast style ale, but gives the grapefruit hop aromas just the right finish, so as not to underwhelm or have that one note hop taste. Fantastic beer and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good representative for West Coast IPA's. Extremely drinkable and well versed in hops usage."
""
"One of our favorite IPAs, always pick up a 6 pack or bomber of this fantastic beer when we get the chance. We recently visited this brewery last month, and even went on a tour. A solid brewery definitely. As far as Sculpin goes, a wonderful west coast IPA."
""
"Poured from bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Good sized head with an amazing amber color. Smells of citrus and hops. Goes down smooth., great mouthfeel. By far one of the better IPA's I have ever had. My first time experiencing a Ballast Point beer and was very impressed. Worth the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great citrusy IPA from a great brewery. Grapefruit-IPA with a clean appearance and superb taste. Would be a great introduction to what West Coast IPA brewers are shooting for. The beer more than lives up to its reputation as an absolutely outstanding IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: The mouth-feel is medium. Kind of a harsh/sharp/over carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Just a wonderful beer. Poured in a pint glass. 4/5 clear, Olympic bronze in color, thick foamy chunky cloud like head melts into your mouth. Light but full bodied and softly fruity. Amazing. Bottle art is spectacular too on the latest run of bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid west coast IPA. I prefer a a lot more hop flavors and aromas to be present in an IPA. This is my second time trying this beer (both from 22 oz bottles) and I was hoping I would experience some big hop flavors and aroma that I have come to expect in a top rated IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"After the first taste I was thinking this ought to be considered a double or imperial. Regardless, a very solid American IPA from Ballast Point. I'm glad I finally got to try this brew, and it was well worth the wait. Hopefully distro can be sorted out and it will make it to CO soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sculpin pours a clear darker copper color with a small lacing head. There is a strong, bold floral aroma. The taste has a very bold fresh hop taste, finishes very dry and a good hint of bitterness, no frills in this one. Great feel, great full flavors. Overall a very bold no playing around hoppy IPA."
""
""
""
"The body is medium, with a slightly slick feel, and a lingering grapefruit rind bitterness. This is actually the last bottle of several sixers I've had, just hadn't gotten around to reviewing yet. It's a great shelf-stocker for the fridge for IPA fans."

"The first time I had this I defintely didn't see the hype, but this has grown on me. The aroma  shows pungent grapefruit and mild malt sweetness. The taste consists of pungent/dank grapefruit at first followed by sweeter tropical hops and semi dry finish.  Definitely one of the best widely available ipas out there, but the six pack price will limit the amount of times I purchase this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-One really can't name an IPA BETTER than Sculpin. Only a two or three finger, not even a handful, of choices that are ON PAR. For myself, Bell's-Two Hearted Ale is an example. Sculpin is the most sensory balanced IPA that opts to focus on the tropical smell and taste above all. A fridge is not a fridge without Sculpin in it at all times."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very good west coast IPA, bordering on the too smooth to be a west coast IPA with this age."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: i love the grapefruit bombs, and this is as good as any I've tried with the exception of a fresh Stone Enjoy By (technically a DIPA, so no comparison). it's full on citrusy bitterness, relentless."
"O- One of my favorites for good reason. Everything is well balanced and works in harmony. Would highly recommend."

""

"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice white head developed, thick and creamy, with good retention and lacing. Aroma was very hoppy with strong pine notes. Appearance was clear with a dark golden color. Tasted off the charts of pine and hop, almost a tar type of note. More subtle notes of herb and grass. Mild mouth feel with a strong and bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A remarkably balanced IPA. This one showcases the Pine Flavors."
""
"A solid IPA. While this is not my favorite style, I appreciate it and any fan would be remiss to not seek this one out."

"I've had this in the bottle and on tap. Outstanding IPA!! I Kept seeing and hearing great things about this beer. I stumbled upon it at some tiny little craft beer/DIY brewing store in Port Jefferson NY. I wish I remembered the name because it was a great little store with a great selection and good help. Anyway, the beer caught my eye, and I said ""Finally!!"" Snagged it off the shelf and back to my hotel room I go! Fantastic taste and mouthfeel. I had it around room temperature so I could really get a feel of this beer. And it delivered! Since then I've purchased it several times as well as had it on tap. I think I prefer it from the bottle to a glass myself. But either way, get on this beer if you already haven't!"
""
""
""
"12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer is pale to orange amber in color and crystal clear. Thin white head. Beautiful and distinct hop aroma (Galena? Amarillo?). Floral, rich, and delicious. Flavor is aggressively hop forward. Big on bitterness but also very enjoyable. Toasty and malty flavors bring just a tad of sweetness to make me coming back for more of this 70 IBU beast."
""
""
""
""
""
"excellent in a bottle. doesn't have that annoying pine resin over-IPA thing. even better on nitro-tap or tap. this is my favorite and i've tried more or less all the usual IPAs. ballast point also has a couple other nice ales, but this is my favorite."

"O - Don't get me wrong here, it's a very good beer...with good being the operative word. I was left a little disappointed. I enjoyed it but it is nothing I would actively seek out. The carbonation was a little strong as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinking this bad boy straight from the can like a piece of po' white trash! Can't beat the mango-guava-tropical nose. The hops make love to your tongue but in a totally violent way. Truly one of the finer IPAs out there. Would be a great beer to crush after a long run on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavorful, quite hoppy and malty IPA, almost a DIPA. A nice hoppy bite surprise."
"Served in a pint glass."
""
""
"Beautiful appearance in the glass. Thin foam dissipates quickly, with lots of tiny bubbles, but fine lacing throughout. Sweet pine cone & grapefruit nose. Prominent hops up front balanced nicely with smooth citrusy malt and generous mouthfeel. Seems the perfect example of what IPA should be. Believe the hype."
"Mouthfeel is generous with a nice balance of thickness per sweetness ratio. Medium to full carbonation gives it a prickly taste bud experience. I like this brew alot and wish other breweries could come up with similar but equally unique recipes. So far Lagunitas Sucks is on par with it, and also pliny the elder. Give this one a try you won't regret it. Also I am pairing this with cracked pepper cheese curds from my local farmstead shop, giving it another dimmension as well. Good IPA's deserve to be paired well with good food."
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent. A world class brew. The only thing stopping this from being a go to IPA for me is the price, but even at that it is tempting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But now they seem to have settled on a consistent bottle dating strategy and this stuff is showing up on Long Island fresh. Different beer now but great. Not as fragrant and sweet, but love drinking this stuff now when fresh. Love the old school bottle caps and labels."

"What a spectacular beer! I have read that many consider this the best IPA in the world and I can easily see why. The Sculpin lets you know you are drinking a damn good IPA without hitting you over the head with a one note hop bomb that wears out your palate. It starts with a nice dry hoppy bitterness that gives way to a good citrusy bite with a bit of apricot fruitiness. The strong citrusy aroma and full medium body really round out this top notch beer."

"Thick, light tan and resilient froth topping a reddish orange brew. Big oily hops to the nose with slight caramel notes. Grapefruit to the tongue up front with a strong malt backbone and a herbal aftertaste. Some spice exists. Lighter than expected. This one seems pretty typical for the style, and I admit I wonder what I'm missing. Going with my honest opinion here, but will revisit when I get the chance. Perhaps I missed something."
"This is one of the best IPAs I've had."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: As mentioned above it is so well balanced I truly have no complaints. It's smooth, it's bitter, its refreshing. The only slight negative I could possibly find is that some places don't carry the freshest bottles which leads to a slightly maltier taste. But fresh...it doesn't get much better. I'm hoping now to get my hands on some Habanero Sculpin to see how that is."

"Beautiful beer. A foggy orange with a beautiful head. A little boozy to the nose with a hint of orange and hops. Starts off a bit hoppy and sour but slides into a smooth orangey finish. This is an excellent beer. It's extremely drinkable for a (somewhat) high ABV. I love it. It really does everything I want my beer to do. Excellent. Just excellent."

"This might be the best IPA I've had to date. It is clean, precise, and executed almost flawlessly. It's bursting with hop flavor and bitterness without being over the top which is hard to come by. The layering of flavors are very impressive. As of right now this is my favorite IPA to date. This 6pack was 15.99 but worth every penny."

" Sculpin is the benchmark for balanced IPAs: it's refreshing even though it finishes bitter, because its dryness keeps that bitterness from lingering too long, plus the sweet malts and tropical fruits prevent the hop bite from destroying your taste buds, so you are always left wanting that next sip."

"Ok its about time i rated this wonder! 12oz single bought from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $2.19 Its an attractive pour..orange clear with a lovely half inch off white frothy head. Aroma is very hop forward,green onion,lemon zest and resin...some buried nuttiness from the malts. Taste is similar to nose but without the onion..spicy,hoppy,resin and grapefruit again malts an after thought. Mouth feel is certainly OK..rather flabby finish though. OK beer but not living up to the hype IMO."

"Beautiful light orange color, with an equally beautiful nose with notes of orange zest, lemon and hops. Flavors of ripe apricot, lemon, and orange blossom balance out the persistent hop bitterness throughout the palate, even if it does finish rather quickly. The lack of depth with this ale is the major reason keeping it from being perfect in our opinion."

"Ballast Point remains my most favorite brewery from SD."
""
""

"Overall: Very well balanced with many of the typical West Coast IPA characteristics being present. Grapefruit is definitely the theme of this beer, but all the features of the fruit are being presented at their finest."
"Ya this is west coast all the way, way more bitter then most the IPAs I drink, I am more a Midwest coaster myself, while I do prefer the likes of Two Hearted and Ale Asylums IPAs which lean more towards hop flavor then bitterness. I still appreciate a good West Coast style IPA and this one is up there with my favorites Racer 5 and GF WC IPA, that being said I will enjoy this 6er but after that I will stick to my Racer 5 for my west coast needs, I like it a little better and it is a lot cheaper."

"O: I used to not be a huge fan of this - it's taken quite a few bottles for me to get here, but I've now grown to really like this. This is easily the best IPA I've had with crystal malt, hands down, and definitely in my top 10 of all IPAs for that matter (when its fresh)."

"Overall/Comments: Sculpin is an exceptional IPA that ranks in my top 5 in the IPA style. Very well balanced while still being able to showcase the hops that make this beer so tasty and drinkable. I have also had this extremely fresh when I visited Ballast Point back in 2011. Consumed 7/29/13. Classified as an American IPA @ 7%."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A very bitter, yet refreshing and tasty IPA that clears the sinuses with its complex American hop flavor profile. Both the alpha and beta acids are well-showcased here. Truly an enjoyable IPA that will hit the spot for any hophead."
""
""
""
"O - This beer is as good as its reputation. It may be better than that even."
"An excellent beer that I would happily buy time and time again were it not so expensive. Still certainly worth the $11-$14 it can cost for a six-pack...but make sure to get it fresh, it makes a world of difference. Recommended, although there are definitely IPAs out there that I'm fonder of and that are available to me just as readily."

"Sometimes when I'm at the local beer store you can strike up a conversation with another patron and get some great tips. Ive had other Ballast Point beers and liked them a lot. Sculpin is pretty amazing. It pours a sparkling gold color with a decent head of foam. Good lacing but would have liked a creamier suds on top. I smell citrus but melon breaks through as well. Good carbonation and the bitterness doesnt knock you on your backside. A great IPA!"

"Other notes: I resisted Ballast Point for a long time because it was hard to take them serious with such hideous branding. A few months ago, the local liquor store had some Sculpin on clearance, so I decided to jump. It was out of date, but still tasted pretty good. I'm so glad they finally got a decent design team because this stuff is too good to have such an ugly label."

"Mouthfeel is about perfect. Exactly the right combination of fluffiness and creaminess. Overall, I'm very pleased with this beer, and delighted to finally be able to try it."
""
""
"I think that this is one of the best IPA I have ever had. It had a citrus note in the beginning and great finish. This is the type of beer that I want when I go out to dinner at a great restaurant. It is sophisticated and complex enough to know it is special. Great mouth feel and smooth going down. The appearance is a little cloudy, but worth the burst of flavor. I highly recommend."

"This beer tastes like how you would expect a San Diego IPA to taste like. Lots of big citrus flavors. Mainly grapefruit I would say. Not much malt going on. 7% ABV isn't too hot either. Good mouthfeel as the bitterness doesn't scorch the tongue or palate. A very solid IPA. Not the best you can find in San Diego or even SoCal for that matter but a solid choice nonetheless. I was very glad to find it at Brewforia in Meridian, Idaho. So thanks to them for getting it fresh to a relatively small market. Cheers Ballast Point!"
"O - No denying this is a very good beer, among the best of year-round nationally available IPA's. However, beer is overpriced. $10.99 for a 22oz bottle or $16.99 for a 6-pack is borderline absurd. Really enjoy it, but will not purchase very often until the price comes down..."

"Overall: I go through phases with IPA's and my go to was Founders Centennial (or lavery dulachan when available), but I have a new standby. This is one of the best Beers I have ever had, never mind an IPA. For a beer classified as an IPA this is a lesson and perfect example of artisan craftsmanship and deliberately imparting these flavours into a beer with the hops (Does anyone else feel a good amount of IPAs are just packed with hops without any rhyme or reason these days? Particularly double IPAs?) . Great work and if I wound up with another one of these in my lifetime, I'd call it KARMA!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours clear golden with long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Huge amount of citrusy, herbal hops dominate the palate with biscuit malt and ripe fruit provide some support. Finish is long and hoppy. Great IPA but hugely overpriced."

"Due to the shop I purchased this fine beer at I'm very inclined to believe it's fresh. Gazing upon this glass I see the picture of perfection when it comes to the proper appearance for an IPA. There's effervescence, flawless clarity, a foamy white head of some size, and the hue of a golden sun. The aroma is fresh and alluring, like fresh flowers and ripe citrus fruit. There's a notable presence of tropical fruits as well, such as pineapple and mango. It seems very juicy and zesty! Just like my favorite beers should, I am pleasantly surprised by the flavor due to its complexity. It is merely kissed by those fruity aspects of the aroma, because it's true heart is chock full of resinous, earthy bitterness. There must be an inclusion of Simcoe hops, because that type of ""fine cigar"" reminiscence is unmistakable. I absolutely love how the more coarse bitterness pulls on the palate while the lighter flavors dance in and out with each sip. There's just a tiny bit of breadiness from the malts, which is just right for this mix. The brewers at Ballast Point came up with a fantastic recipe here, that is a rare treat. It sticks and coats to the mouth too, just how I like the mouthfeel to be. The finish is dry, but not too dry. I also like how the ABV is not off the charts so I can drink a few of them. Overall, this is definitely one of the finest IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid all around IPA. The can format is nice and packable/transportable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was alittle dissappionted with this beer. It tasted good but wasn't close to the classic I was expecting. Ill give it another shot though."
""
"O-I am somewhat disappointed. The juicy fruit flavors are pleasant, but I found them to be a bit one-dimensional. Not to say that this beer is not a good IPA, it is above average actually, but it is not the world-beater I was expecting. Perhaps my can was old and the complexity had faded or perhaps it really is just a case of setting unrealistic expectations, but there are better IPAs in California and elsewhere."
""
""

"Clean, crisp, and devilishly intoxicating. Line another one up. Yep!"

"I cannot write anything better about this beer than any other entry you may find about it. It is a perfectly balanced IPA. Bitter, citrusy, slight malt sweetness, crisp...DELICIOUS. Stop worrying about rankings and start trusting your taste buds. This beer is world class."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Over all good beer. Pours a little hazy, with a finger of head. Hop aroma with a nice malt balance. Tastes the same; hop forward with a nice balance of toasty malt. Finishes with a citrus hop tartness. Balanced. Maybe not as much as their big eye, but balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Ties for my top IPA, and I think probably edges out Titan for top honors."
""

"This beer smells and tastes like durians - which I love. It had a slight grapefruit after taste and a hint of banana ester as well in the nose. It won out in a head to head with 90 minute ale, Torpedo, and Hopdevil all of which I rate favorably. Complex, well balanced and clean. Very drinkable medium bodied IPA."
""
"O - A very solid IPA, but not worth the price as I think Stone IPA is better and I get it for quite a few $ less. Marginally better than Goose Island and Southern Tier IMO, which I can get for even less."

"MF - Medium bodied, well carbonated and with the bitterness somewhat of a sharp mouthfeel."

"This is my favorite beer in the planet. Citrussy bitterness.

"Such a great beer. I'm just now really getting into IPAs and this is the best one I've had so far. Would definitely buy again and seems very session-able."

"O: A must for hop lovers, a super bright IPA. Similar to union jack, flower power, lunch ect. Upper echelon IPA for sure. A bit overpriced but worth purchasing once for sure. Getting this fresh is as good as anything out there."
""

"O - this does not disappoint. I wanted tons of hops and that's what I got! This is what an IPA should be!"

"Wow! Although I later learned this beer is famous, it was a surprise for me, and therefore wins its high rating on its own merits. Probably the best taste in a bottle I have ever had. Phenomenal take off, plenty of hops and complex flavors with the most delicate and enjoyable finish. Nicely done, boys! Sets the standard for IPAs."

""
""
"O - 4.75 - This is an amazing American IPA, probably the best one I've had. I think what makes it so amazing is that hop flavor-wise it easily stands up to much ""bigger"" IPAs. And now that it's canned it's a great beer to take golfing, to the pool, or out on the boat without the worry of glass bottles laying around."

"UPDATE 10/1/13 Yikes I forgot about the sixpack I bought back in August, just rediscovered it on a top shelf of my closet and put one in the beer fridge last week. Had it tonight and nothing I would change about my August review except this time it might not have been quite as powerfully hoppy due to the two months the bottle had on it. Still no hop bitterness slouch though by a long shot. Drank from a Sierra Nevada IPA glass this time and the heavy surface pile of white foam really stood out to the end, as did a full pattern of lacing. Refreshing despite the fact it is now only 52 degrees outside. UPDATE2 10/26/13 another from the sixpack and same deal, but no complaints about the hop bite being less than at first. Still going very strong. Drank this one from an Innis & Gunn stemmed flute. Loads of lacing at the end again too."

"Overall: A great food beer, I can keep drinking this. It almost feels like a DIPA due to the strong characteristics. I love it fresh!"

"Overall Impression: A fantastic and intriguing IPA. Bringing much more pine and resin flavor than citrus, the sculpin sits a little heavier on the palate, making it a great dinner or afternoon sipping beer rather than a great six-packer or multiple quaff. Hop forward but not overly so, it's biscuit and caramel malt character ground it well."

"Ballast Point Sculpin IPA ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
"O: One of the top 5 AIPA's I've ever tried. Just phenomenal. It's hard to get Ballast Point here in NY for a reasonable price (usually $15-$16 a 6 without liquor tax), but when I get the chance it is quite the treat. Every beer I've ever had from them is in the upper tiers of craft brew. Must try."
"this is a very nice ipa, and it's nice to finally try it in a can.. i've had this on tap and in growler before, but never got a chance to review it.. it's just as good, if not better than i remember."

"The flavor does not hold the fruitiness of the scent nearly as well but a more balanced citrus, malt and piney hop flavor comes out on the tongue. The flavors are strong but never overpowering the other. This balance lends to feel as a very smooth, light and crisp feel causes the ale to drink dangerously easy. 7 ABV will not hurt you as bad but it reminds you that this is not a DIPA, yet so much fragrance and flavor comes from a littler package."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light amber color with thick foamy head. Good head retention and excellent lacing. Hoppy, piney aroma that is slightly citric. Malty taste up front, followed by mod piney hop. Very good transition from malt to hops in this one. Mod bitter piney aftertaste. It is really a very good IPA. Oddly enough, it may not be my favorite from Ballast Point, although I know that many people would disagree with me."
"A bar near me has started to carry a much better selection of beers which is where I got to finally try this amazing IPA. The color is a crisp golden caramel and it pours with a light head. The citrus undertones pair nicely with the hoppyness of the beer. Overall I was very happy with this selection and look forward to enjoying this again."
""

"Smell is fragrent floral and a little spicy, the taste matches the smell closely with no offnotes, doesn't have the silky or somewhat viscous mouthfeel that I prefer in my favorite IPAs but it is smooth nonetheless. Amber color with a creamy head. From my own personal experience, I consider this a top tier IPA. It is on my short list of IPAs to seek out when I'm making a beer selection..."
"O- This IPA definitely lives up to the hype. This is a wonderful IPA with huge tropical hop flavors, a big aroma, and a great mouthfeel. Bravo Ballast Point this is a winner."

"In a word, perfection. Citrusy, lightly fruity, not much herbal hop flavor it all; a little residual sweetness from what tastes like a gorgeous marriage of caramel hops with the prerequisite two-row. Color is dark gold, not quite brassy with beautiful lacing and head retention. An exceptional and fantastic IPA, one of the best in the world."

"Finally, I get to see what all the hoopla surrounding this beer is all about, and I can say, it's deserved. This is an excellent single IPA. It reminds me of a slightly flatter or earthier Jai Alai or Flower Power, and could easily be a daily drinking IPA."

"Canned and put onto my tastebuds here in Michigan just 12 days later. A six-pack ran me $14 or $15, which is definitely kind of steep (considering I can get a sixer of Two Hearted for $10), but this has an excellent bitter pine and peach flavor that I thoroughly enjoy. If this were available in Michigan, I'd definitely pick it up from time-to-time... even with the slightly higher price point."

"Poured from a 12 bottle into an IPA glass. Pours an orange golden color with a small fluffy head. Smells of earthy and piney hops, nice aroma. Tastes of earthy hops and nice grain bouquet. Beer is light bodied and refreshing, very much finishing smooth with good to slightly high carbonation. Overall, an above average beer."

"Pours a hazy sandy orange with a white head, Aroma is sweet and juicy with some mango and grapefruit paired with a nice, toasty bready foundation. Flavor is quite similar.Mold bitterness in the finish. A crisp, active mouthfeel. OVerall, great IPA. Glad to have finally tried."

"Golden and transparent in color; Bright, fruity, and floral in smell. This beer came recommended by a friend, and I suppose I can see why he likes it. Sculpin is a clean IPA similar to various offerings from Lagunitas, but less punchy than Founders. It's not as sweet as it smells, but hoppier than the nose suggests. It's also cleaner than a double IPA, while carrying some DIPA characteristics that I enjoy. The finish is dry and leaves your palette in a position to try something radically different without the side effects of stronger/wilder IPAs. This is a great everyday IPA, and I'd rate it higher if it were priced more reasonably. I don't think it's worth as much as it costs, but that's subjective."

"O- Just an overall fantastic IPA. Does the west coast style extremely well. Probably my #1 IPA in my short journey through craft beer land. I've got many more to try[Pliny, Heady, Fuzzy BD, to name a few] but the reputation for Sculpin holds up for me."

"O: I would like to e out that the dat on the bottle (which I assume is the best by date) is 6/01/13. It's almost 30 days later and this beer is still great. I will need to try this beer again preferably on draft. I have no doubt that fresher, the hop flavor would be glorious."

"O - A fantastic beer if you like a balanced, unique IPA experience."

"I had this before from a bottle but found it better from the can. By the way, that can came from the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, some citrus. Taste is bitter, lots of hops, some citrus, a touch of malts, pretty tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine beer."

"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time. Heard its praise, never had the chance until it recently got Oregon distro. Looks great, very clear with a thin light head, good carb. The nose is my favorite thing about this, smells like a fair amount of amarillo went into it. I don't know how fresh this is, but I was expecting a bit more out of this one. The bitter is there, I just wanted more floral or citrus presence. It's there, don't get me wrong, I just expected more given all the hype I've heard. Maybe it's just the living in the PNW that's talking, but I think there are other IPAs out there to be had for cheaper that are of comparable or higher quality."

"Purchased at Total Wine in Phoenix, AZ. ""Enjoy by 08/12/13."" Poured into an Alesmith Ten Year Anniversary tulip glass. Golden orange in color, somewhat hazy but mostly clear. Rapidly thinning cream-colored head. Appealing thick, sticky lacing. Aromas of pine, candied grapefruit, lemon rind. Slight malt sweetness at first, but a sturdy bitterness quickly takes over and sustains throughout the finish. A caramel-sweet base carries massive citrus rind and pine sap flavors. Some soft apricot and mango notes appear throughout. Nice and light on the palate with a smooth, dry finish. Must-try for IPA aficionados, although somewhat pricey at $9 a bottle."
"Final Thoughts: I'm a hop head and IPAs are my go-to style but I find myself really dissapointed with this one. Was room temperature when I bought it and don't know how long ago it was bottled but expected better. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'll try to find it on-tap."
"O: Fantastic IPA. This one is definitely a beer to have FRESH. To me it seems to make a bigger difference than some other popular IPAs. My local guy will only procure an amount he can sell fresh and then it is a wait till the distributor reloads. One of my favorites."

"Local to San Diego these go for $3 on tap at some spots. My go to beer if available due to how consistently it makes me happy. After trying HT I've now placed Sculpin at #2 on my IPA list... Sad story but nonetheless an awesome beer. Clear gold/amber color and citrus fruit on the nose. Mouth feel is good, very dry after it goes down with some bitterness. GREAT BEER. $$$"

"O - Sculpin, when on tap, is my favorite IPA."
"Pours out a clear brassy gold. Thin head. Some piney/citrus hops in the nose with a pale maltiness that's fairly prevalent. Touch of booze in the nose. Taste is fairly balanced overall. Quite a bit of maltiness and sweetness up front. Dries out in the finish a touch. Doesn't beat you over the head with hop flavor but has a pretty punchy bitterness in the finish. Bitterness lingers. I enjoy the bitterness, but I'd prefer a touch more hop flavor. Mouthfeel isn't thick and syrupy, which is a very good thing, but it could use a bit more body. Carbonation could be a little more assertive for my tastes. Overall this is a pretty solid IPA with nothing really ""off"" about it. I really just don't understand the $15 price tag for the 6 though. Give me a Stone IPA over this in flavor and price, but I can't really hate on this either. Again, this is solid, but I just don't understand the hype."

""
""
""

"Atmosphere is great. Deep golden hue, decent head, and thick persistent lacing. Nose is pungent bread, all sorts of citrus notes, and pine resin. Italian bread base malt, pine resin and woody citrus notes comprise the flavor. Full, thick body. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"Overall: The hop flavors aren't as complex as when I last had this but then again this isn't a fresh beer. A beer to never turn down if offered and a hop bomb that should be tried by all. My only complaint is that I can't walk down to the gas station and buy a bomber of this."
"Overall - Normally, I'm not a big fan of hop bombs (and make no mistake, this is a hop bomb). This beer, however, balances out the hops with a sturdy malt foundation. A very good beer. Not for the timid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a beautiful clear amber, the head is big and foamy. Reminiscent of its English ancestors, it dissipates quickly but still manages to leave nice sticky lacing. The aroma is big and bold, with nice tropical fruit notes. The taste is equally delicious and the numerous hops additions are apparent. The body is actually a little thinner than I would've thought for such a hopped up beer but it doesn't detract in any way. It's an incredible IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing grapefruit flavor paired with tangerine, and a little bit of piney/resnous hops. Has a grapefruity / resinous finish. Not much in the way of malts, but what is there is light and just enough. Has a moderate body and moderate/high carbonation for an IPA."
"What is the relationship between a fish on a label and a killer IPA? I don't know but it seems that the majority of IPA's I drink with some kind of fish, fisherman, etc are kickass and this one is no different. This one was recommended to me by someone at the local bottle shop as I was browsing. At first I was hesitant to purchase an 22oz IPA for $7.99... I mean a DIPA maybe but an IPA??? He assured me it would be worth it so I took the bait(no pun intended with the fishing analogies). Well I'll be hooked(hey another fishing analogy) but he was right... this is one killer IPA. A perfect balance between hops and malt and everything in between. Amazing! Reminds me of another IPA with a fish on it from the great lakes... very nice. I know I shouldn't base part of my score off of price but I'm gonna have to slightly lower the overall by .25 simply due to it is overpriced for a 22oz bomber IMHO though I assume not the brewery's fault... if i could find this in a 6pk in my area it just may be a go-to. Very nice."

"This was so well done. The malt was immediate, always near at hand. The hops were civilized and cultivated in this drink. It was bold but not audacious. This was extraordinary."

"O: Like i said, everything is straight forward, nothing too complex. But WOW. Just awesome stuff. A ton of hop flavors and just bitter enough to know its an IPA. Good for one beer or 6. Refreshing and flavorful. pick this up now! /96"

"this ballast point ipa is pretty good. nice color- slightly cloudy. the smell is super hoppy with a touch of citrus. the taste hast that nice ipa bitterness, a good solid bitter. i do wish there was some more citrus in the flavor. that complaint is a stretch- thats all i got, if i have to say something. bottom line- if youre in the mood for an ipa this one will definitely hit your spot ."

"What can you say about one of the best? Some might call this a hop bomb, but its balanced so well they would be as wrong as Ariel was for taking those girls. A strong, dry hop presentation with spice, pine notes off of a thin white, low carbonation head. Beers like this make me want to live in the ballast point parking lot."
""
"Poured into becker. Golden orange, the color of honey, with a thick fluffy white head that fades after a bit but seems to leave lots of lacing. Smells of floral hops with tropical fruit; pineapple and mango are noticeable. Taste is less hoppy than the smell; sweet and clear up front with hops coming in at the end, quite a bitter finish though. A great drinkable IPA though; if the hop flavor had been all throughout, it would have been more of a sipper."
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel and no notice of alcohol. An excellent beer overall. Glad its finally being distributed in my area."

"O- A solid beer, overpriced for what it is. Averages about $15 a six pack, would take their Big Eye IPA over this one for about 5 bucks less a sixer."
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer and certainly one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever come across. No real alcohol taste or hop bite...it doesn't have that devastatingly fresh smell, taste or mouthfeel but it's clearly a well put together IPA with excellent balance that makes it extremely easy to down without regret or hesitation. This would be a great beer for introducing people to IPA's or for those that don't like the bitterness. Definitely worth a try but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Best before 09/23/13. Overall this is a well made IPA. Quite balanced and easy to drink. I wasn't as blown away by it as I hoped given some reviews. It's very solid and well made, but it isn't amazing. Worth a try, particularly at a bar when it is priced similarly to other solid IPAs, but it's a little expensive compared to other IPAs I enjoy as much in bottle format."

"What a great Ipa. I have had these at different times however. This is a beer you want fresh. If you are at the store check the date on it. It is not the best when old. And definitely don't age this beer. But when fresh it is pretty much flawless. It is closer in style to a Founders then a Three Floyds as it does not have all the citrus on the nose like a Floyds or even in the taste but it is a great beer. I would never say no to a Sculpin in fact I would hunt it out. It is worth the money."
""
"Overall: a good well crafted ipa but id like a stronger showing of the smooth and sweetness"
"O: A good IPA. This dog does hunt."
""
""
""
""
""
"For those who like to hop we salute you. A satisfying IPA. Reminiscent of Two Brothers ( Illinois ) seasonal Hop Juice for me, which I love. The $16 6pk is a tad rich for my tastes. Other comparables out there at a lower price tag."
""
""
""
"***If not fresh, it will not rate this high. It falls off dramatically!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoy this beer, but there are few more readily available beers here in the northeast that I would consider comparable. But yea this beer deffinatly deserves the hype, really very good."
"O- What I particularly appreciate about this IPA is how well the taste stands up to your expectations after smelling its gloriously hoppy aroma. It leaves nothing to be desired. That and a great malt backbone in this beer make it a stand out IPA and a worth your while. Even if you don't like IPA's, this one could make a hop head out of you."

"The mouthfeel is very interesting. It's smooth at first, but the sting of carbonation follows quickly, and then it finishes slightly sticky. Overall, this is a very good IPA, however, it didn't blow me away as I had hoped. In an overloaded market of IPAs, there are many options with better value, that are just as good."
"OVERALL: Hits the palate in waves and only thins out towards the end of the sip as the perfect flavors all come forward at once. This is what IPA's should taste and look like!"
""
""
""
""

"This was a great beer. Poured from a bottle at home. This San Diego brewery is top notch. Pours a nice copper color and the carbonation and head of the beer stayed consistent throughout the glass. As you get the initial smell, you know they banged out a perfect IPA. Very happy after tasting...great hoppy though balanced beer that is not crazy heavy in alcohol content which I appreciate. This is going to be a go to for me."
"I don't think I've ever poured a beer with such beautiful rich hearty golden color. The light fruity smell, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. Let me say, I am still trying to become an IPA fan but I still struggle with the bitterness. As far as IPA's go though, this one is quite tasty although that may be that I am a fan of grapefruit and Sculpin tastes ALOT like grapefruit. Very thin and light in the mouth, that I really like, with a very light and fluffy head, that I also I like. I was drinking this one with some chips and salsa and for me, I don't think IPAs and salty foods go that well together. I think it really accentuates the bitterness of the IPA. Seems like it would have gone a lot better with a nice medium rare piece of beef. Next time...."

"Finally, at long last, I got the chance to enjoy a sculpin. actually, I enjoyed three of them! the setting was the strip house steak joint in the planet Hollywood casino in las vegas, Nevada. I sat down with my hockey teammates, who all ordered a fancy cabernet, but I asked to glance at the beer list, and there it was, sculpin ipa. it poured a beautiful cloudy grassy pale golden color, with an inch or so of off white head that lasts forever, leaves excellent lacing, and is easily reinvigorated with a swirl the wine glass I asked the server to bring me. the nose on it is long and hoppy, but not in that dank oily sweet fruity way that some of these are, but more subtle, not more simple, but more in focus, more sure of its identity. there are notes of fresh pineapple and spruce, but this is neither bitter nor sweet. its got an impressive degree of malt balance, as well as a yeast character that reminds me of some of the European ipa offerings. the flavor is standalone. its got a gorgeous hop bouquet, with some floral notes in there too, but I cannot quite place any of the specific varietals. less citrus and more pine than I expected, and a forever finish that's both refreshing and filling to a degree. the alcohol is impossible to pick out. feel is also lovely, with effervescently bright carbonation that tickles the tongue without being invasive, and a medium body that doesn't stand in the way of the flavor. this was the absolutely perfect complement to a 20 ounce bone in ribeye, dry aged, rare. I had three of these with my steak, and would have had more if they weren't 12 bucks a go. what a glorious ipa this is, distinct from the crowd, and worth every word of the hype. really sensational brew."

"Poured into a Sam Adams beer glass with an amber color and a light head that faded quickly. Smell of grapefruit and strong bitter taste on the front end. Floral hops linger in the mouth. Sweet malt back that nicely rounds out the hops. Very nice carbonation and just a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, not as good as I expected but it is an excellent IPA."

Very nice carbonation and just a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent IPA. One of the best."

"Overall: It's a very good, even excellent IPA. I'll come back to re-review this beer the next time I have a fresher bottle and see if the flavour is affected at all. But as it stands, this beer that's close enough to its expiration date is still a very good one. I think the hop flavours could bear a bit more of strength in comparison to the hop bitterness even though the underlying malt backbone is solid. (4)"
""
"I don't believe I've ever given a perfect score, but this beer is amazing. It pours a golden orange with a thin white head. Excellent retention and lace. Aroma is of fruits,spice,grassy hops. Body is solid, and nicely carbonated. Taste is an explosion of fruity hops. Crisp and smooth with a great finish. I'm at a loss for words. I gave this beer a perfect score, because for me there is nothing that could be done to improve it. Go out and find this beer if at all possiable. EXCELLENT!"

The label says that it has tropical fruit character, and I did not get one fruity note in the aroma or taste (citrus maybe, but where was the mango, apricot and peach?) Maybe this one was past it's prime, the drink by date was this month. I'll have to try another one and re-review if I like it better."

"I've heard lots of great things about this beer and now I know. They weren't kidding, if you love IPAs and hops you will love the fresh hoppy goodness that is Sculpin!"

"So we have another addition to the West Coast “Must Haves.” Those of us in the Capitol Region may not ever get access to the renowned Pliny, but we damn well can have a Sculpin and that’s good enough for me."

"Excellent brew from down San Diego way. Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is a very light kind of American IPA, with the hops balanced well with lots of fruit and citrus. The finished product is very drinkable and smooth, with a broad, albeit, indecipherable pallet. Pricey, but excellent."

"Overall, I was disappointed with this one. It started off promising with a great appearance and a bold fruity/yeasty aroma but the flavor was so overly harsh and unbalanced. After reading other rave reviews I wondered if I had an old bottle but there's an ""enjoy by"" date right on the label that read 07/13/13 so I have to assume this is relatively fresh. The lively hop aroma certainly attested to that. Its unfortunate the flavor didn't live up to the smell. I really wanted to love this and while its by no means a bad beer, it is unbalanced and excessively bitter in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"I'm going to be forgiving because regardless of how old, it's still not a bad beer. I'll re-review when I get a fresh bottle."
"O - I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not as thrilled about it as most people seem to be. The onion aroma is not my favorite thing to smell in a beer, but I don't consider it to be offensive. The flavor is pleasant, but not outstanding. This beer reminds be of Lagunitas Sucks which I think is a slightly more enjoyable beer than this."
""
""
"Pours like liquid gold, with the beautiful bullion color to match. The nose is citrus, grapefruit. Mild carbonation allows for maximum hop exposure on tongue. Taste develops slowly, like a Godspeed You! Black Emperor tune. Aftertaste is lingeringly lovely. I'd sip this Sculpin sitting on a dock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"I like this beer, but it doesn't wow me. I think the big let-down is that I want a top-notch IPA to blast my nose with hops. This one did, just once. Taste is excellent, though. And both the taste and the feel show restraint, backing off just when I worried they'd start getting worse."
""
"This beers well deserving of its reputation, it hits all the spots and leaves me craving more. I heard my wife say the other day she wants to go to California, I'm starting to agree with her but I think we may have different reasons for wanting to go."
""
""
""
""
"The smooth big body matched with its uncanny bitterness still showcases a great beer"
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O- The best tasting beer that I have ever had. Its like getting kicked in the mouth with a pair of fuzzy slippers dipped in sweet nectar. Amazingly good and worthy of the price and hype. I am eager to see how it holds up against the other big hitters. Was a step above the Stones I have tried."
"Overall-Surprised, yes I am. Didn't quite expect this beer to be this good. Very well balanced and drinkable as hell. Surprised that this is a 7% abv beer, yes. I would put this beer up there with the doubles that get all the hype. 4.5"
"Pours a cloudy gold with typical lace. Lots of sweet orange on the nose, very nice. Taste? Well, maybe mine is a tad stale from being on the shelf for a bit, but I’m not seeing where this beer’s legendary status comes from. I get a fair amount of juicy orange, which I like, but it doesn’t have the biggest bite and there’s a funky aftertaste I can’t quite place. A good one for sure, but it wouldn’t make my personal IPA top-10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great, full bodied, unique as hell IPA. Intriguing blend, would highly recommend."
""
"Very nice IPA. Aroma mellow citrus fruits, well balanced but not screaming pine like some good IPAs. Slight passion fruit. No head retention, not that pretty. Light amber. Very well balanced with sharp but quickly fading citrus fruit. Beautiful bitterness it finish with a sharp tang at the end. Great mouth feel. Coats your mouth. Overall very nice, not the best IPA in the world anymore but still up there."

"Nice pour - Amber to brown in color with a decent head at pour. Some lacing. Finer carbonation. Aroma is bitter citrus. Beautiful clean and refreshing IPA - flavor shows some floral and citrus but bolder than many with similar hop varieties. Sweet up front with a nice, long bitter after taste."

"Pale, golden with a ivory cap that melts away leaving sticky lace on the glass. Decent nose, grapefruit and pine with toasted grain. Tasty and decently hoppy with resinous pine and citrus notes up front with grain and hop oily bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. A solid IPA for sure."

"On tap at the Bridgeview Tavern in Tarrytown, NY. Nice straw color, pretty clear, very nice head, a great looking beer! The smell is all grapefruit and it's good; not overpowering, but good. The taste is good as well, but doesn't quite live up to the smell. Carbonation, mouthfeel, etc. all really well done. It's well balanced and is just a solid American IPA!"
""
"O: Textbook SoCal IPA. No really, this is exactly what a SoCal IPA should look/smell/taste like."
"Phenomenal. This was a wonderfully refreshing rendition of an IPA with all of the characteristics I love about a DIPA without overloading on the alcohol. The tropical fruit flavors are spot on here, and the malts are well used to balance out any excessive astringency or dry hoppiness. I love this beer so much that if it weren't for the high price tag I'd probably buy it over most beers. Can't recommend it enough - all hopheads must try it."

"Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a nice head. The smell is very nice definitely tropical and citrusy. Says enjoy by 6/29/13. It taste extremely fresh. This is my first time trying this beer. It was recommended by a good friend and this beer did not disappoint. Its very smooth and very easy to drink I will definitely be getting some more soon."

"Revised review on 3/27/15 - Finally had a chance to try this beer on tap while visiting California.  What a difference!  I must have had some old bottled Sculpin because the beer I just drank today was terrific.  Great citrus notes, smooth drinkability, good malt presence to bring balance to the hops.  Really a great IPA.  Now I know what the fuss is about.  I'm bringing my old rating of 3.18 way up!"
""
""
"This pours a golden straw color, clear and clean. Billowy foam, and a bright, hoppy aroma. I get a real crisp citrusy scent. Lots of orange—orange flowers, leaves, zest from the fruit—and pineapple. It’s bitter and slightly chewy with a real clean finish. The citrus and pineapple comes across on the palate. It’s fantastic, and every bit as delicious as I was promised."

"I absolutely loved this beer! Very smooth and easy to drink, yet still had a very complex flavor profile and appealing nose to it. Pours a beautifully clear and slightly copper hue with lots of small carbonation bubbles. One of my new favorites! I wish it was easier to get up here in Northern, California."

""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is one of my top three IPAs. The others being Lost Gold, and Blind Pig."
"Not sure why this gets such high ratings. To me, there's nothing special about it at all. Aroma is similar to Sierra Nevada Torpedo. A bit sour with a very small hint of sweetness. Mostly floral, hardly any citrus in the aroma at all. Taste is a little better, but not by much. Still no citrus. Just some bitter hops. Thin body, not much mouthfeel. Has sort of a ""tea-like"" flavor to it that throws me off. The finish is clean, doesn't leave much of an aftertaste -- I guess that's the best part of the beer. This is $13.99 in my area and it's actually worth about HALF of that. A big disappointment for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Literally the best IPA on the planet. If you're lucky enough to make it to the brewery when they have their special Habanero brew, you're in for a treat. Sculpin IPA infused with with the spice of Habenero peppers...you'll have to taste it to understand. Very spicy, but the spice and the bitterness of the IPA blend perfectly."
""
""
""
"O- Very hard to put down! This is one strong, hop forward beer. I haven't been this impressed with the absolute hoppy bitterness of a beer since I first tried Arctic Panzer Wolf by Three Floyds. This is the kind of hoppy beer I've been searching for for a few months now! Not a beginners IPA!"

"Pours a deep golden orange with a finger of foam. Moderate carbonation stems from the center, good retention on the foam. Lacing is good, great looking beer. Smells of hops of course, some lemon and orange zest. Some floral pine melds with a touch of alcohol and a modest malt. Solid hoppy profile, balanced evenly with the malt. Feel is a nice medium body with a dry bitter finish. Over all this beer is really good, however I think it's over hyped and don't know why it's the #3 american ipa. They have a ridiculous shelf life so maybe I need a fresher bottle"
""
""
""
"This is some of the freshest Sculpin I have been able to get a hold of yet, so I thought I would do a full review since it is one of my all time fave's. Bottle date enjoy by 7-28-13. This beer pours a nice golden amber with a finger of head. The first thing that really stands out is the aroma of fresh tropical fruits and citrus with a small hint of alcohol. The taste is outstanding, piney, citrus hop bite with a hint of malt. Outstanding job by Ballast Point on their flagship brew, deserves all the hype it gets! A staple in my fridge as long as they keep churning it out!"

""
""
"EDIT 2/27/13: I purchased a growler fill of Sculpin at a local bottle shop; I'm giving the mouthfeel and the taste an additional .25 in the new format. Blew me away."
""
"O: So i was really impressed and surprised by this beer I really wasn't expecting this amount of drinkability and flavor. This is a great clean well put together ipa its probably the best single ipa I have ever had it seriously could be compared to Pliny (though i still give the edge to PtE). The fact that this is becoming more available this will definitely become a go to for me and is totally worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent hoppy, bitter, dry West Coast IPA. Getting a little pineapple, but this is an overwhelming hoppy pine bomb. Just a touch of bready sweet malt...not the most balanced IPA, but oh so freaking good. Goes down with a dry finsh...uber dry, but again, I like this. I just can't believe this is not a DIPA. Such a robust beer, but at 7%, not a killer...you can easily have several in a sitting. The price point is this beer's only fault...but you know what, it's worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer reminded me of Two Hearted in a lot of ways (though not quite on the same level, but perhaps I'm slightly biased). They even both have a fish on the label. Being a huge fan of Two Hearted, I can clearly see why the West Coast loves this stuff. Simple, yet excellently crafted and executed. A super-drinkable IPA done right."

"O: Like this beer, aroma is the best part of it, again, bitterness a little more emphasized than flavor in this beer, and the flavors are not very, very distinctive - but still, one of the better IPAs I have ever had."
"Overall: A great representation of a hop-heavy IPA. Pretty well balanced as well, but this will definitely give you the hop fix you are looking for."
"I had bought a six pack of Ballast Point Sculpin IPA last year and it was not very good then but, I hesitated to write a critical review because I felt that it might have been a bad sample. However, having bought it again and again having a negative impression, I decided to write this review. Very disappointed."
""
""
"O: Maybe i have become desensitized, but it doesn't taste as hoppy as I would expect an IPA to taste. Still a flavor that varies over the course of the taste very distinctly.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I haven't had some of the truly amazing AIPA out there, this was definitely the best of the 20+ I have tried thus far. This is that initial high that leaves you chasing to find it again. Lets hope I find it!"
""
""
""
""

"Can't go wrong here- only wish I could get this in CO! When I travel to CA, I always buy out Bev Mo. however, still blows me away that they store it on the shelf..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent IPA. Although this is not my favorite style, I have to give credit where credit is due. Comparable in quality to Two-Hearted. The initial taste is very good, while the hops tend to take over too much as you drink it (from my perspective). It's very balanced, smooth, and an easy drinker, so it is well done regardless. If you like IPA's, I like others definitely recommend it. Glad I tried it. I may do so again some day."

"A nice citrus punch lemon and grapefruit with some slightly sweet orange notes noticeable right before the raw resinous pine rips your mouth raw. Excellent flavor with a lively mouth, only a little too raw for me. An excellent IPA, but not my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"My label said ENJOY BY 04/02/2013 so I have to assume it's moderately fresh and certainly well within that date limit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good IPA, though there are a fair number of other west coast IPAs I would take over Sculpin if I were stranded on a desert island and had to choose just one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad I decided to give this another try. Still not my favorite but it is a well made IPA. I tend to prefer a little more malt sweetness to balance the bitter but Sculpin still goes down easy. I had no problems finishing the whole bomber. Any fan of IPAs should give it a shot to determine for yourself."
""
""
""

"My favorite west coast IPA. Excellent balance, and enough hops to satiate the most devout hop head."

"O – over all one of favorite beers this is the beer that started it all for me and not i cant get enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a fantastic IPA. It is loaded with juicy, resinous, and fruity hops while remaining extremely drinkable and smoothly (rather than abrasively) bitter. I really can’t think of many ways to improve this beer; it is just absolutely phenomenal. It certainly lived up to all the praise that it receives."
"It's a great IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden orange, nice white single finger head. Smells and tastes a lot like dark fruit and malt, bready, caramel, lemon, earthy. Taste is malty for an IPA but has a nice hop presence too. This was a little less hoppy than I prefer. It is extremely balanced and easy drinking but it didn't hit me at a 100. I'd say this one is a little overrated, I'd love to try it on tap to compare."
""
""
""
""
"O: My absolute favorite regular IPA. Still fairly easy to get. DO NOT let it sit around as I had one holdover from early December and it could not touch the fresh ones."
""
"Overall this is one exceptional IPA. Very easy drinking and loads of flavor. Would be good for any hophead even those just getting into the style. 12oz is not enough!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comments: I picked up a bomber while in the quad cities over the holidays. It was a few months old (bottled in Oct) but no oxidation notes came through. It's a very nicely fruity IPA and more balanced than I expected. Maybe some of that was the age, but still a very tasty drink."
""
""
"For an American IPA, this is pretty close to perfect. Though it is well-balance, it is far from mild in the taste department."

"(4.25) D: This is probably a textbook AIPA in all categories. Tropical fruits alluded me in the flavour department but nonetheless still a great AIPA and one I would quickly pickup again."

"Overall - This beer will be a staple in my IPA drinking. Easy to drink and no pine at all to me. Good job BP."

""
""
"High expectations for this one, and didn't disappoint at all."
"Trade from Ibrew2or3. Thanks. Had this just after a Westy 12, and it still shines. Pours loght orange, beautifully clear with a small and quickly receding head. This is one of the prettiest IPAs I have seen. Smell is divine, with floral grapefruit, pine, apricot, and mango. Smells sweet but not overly so. Best smelling for a non-double ipa for me. Bitter hop forward brew. Full bodied and sweet with heavy grapefruit and apricot hop notes. Medium mouthfeel with medium-low catbonation for the style. Lingering bitterness. Beautifully done."

"The alcohol was spot-on for this style and only added a hint of warming to an otherwise solid beer. I'll always hold SNPA dear to my heart since it was one of the first that I ever had of this type and has remained the flagship against with all Pale Ales and IPA's are measured. This fell just short of that but that's nothing to be ashamed about, as this beer warrants at least a try by all hopheads and Ballast Point fans. There's a good reason why this is one of the most popular beers on this site!"

"overall a world class IPA. and now they brew it in cans too? amazing."

"o - not one of the best ipas that i have tried, but solid nonetheless. a classic west coast style ipa that for me may be better enjoyed on a hot summer day than this cold winter evening. if it were distributed in michigan i'd buy a few sixers here and there."
""
""
""
"O: Well made American IPA, on the hoppy side more in the bitterness and flavor areas than in the aroma. Mild malt base and apparent use of only small amounts of crystal malt leave this beer feeling lighter on the palate than most Am IPA's. Delicious in my opinion and comparable to Lagunitas IPA."
""
""
""
"Fantastic. A great example of the great West Coast IPA. Look forward to more."
""
""
""
"O-very tasty brew lots of citrus hops crisp very drinkable"
""
"O: I remember its smell bursting with citrus and pine when I had them as draft in SD bars... may be the bottled version is not as good as draft version? or could it be aging?"

"Overall, love the hop flavor profile. The aroma should be bottled and sold as perfume. A great example of the style."
"Gold-colored and very clear body with a half finger of pure white head. Head fades but maintains a fizzy layer on top and lots of lacing. Strong notes of pine, grass, and dirt in the nose, you're smelling your way through a forest. Taste is clean and sharp but fairly one-dimensional. Definitely on the bitter side of single IPAs. Nice level of carbonation with a very, very dry finish."
""

"Overall: I've had this beer many times and yet I'm always taken aback by how incredible this beer is; I've never had another brew like it. Drinking this liquid work of art is akin to taking a bite out of some crazy hybrid tropical fruit. Any IPA lover... hell, any BEER lover needs to seek out this beer at any or all cost. Truly magical."
"Overall: A very solid west coast IPA. Not the best, imho, but quite a treat. A more balanced mouthfeel would make this beer truly great."

"Beer pours a clear yellow-orange with a thin white head. Aroma is great, a big blast of citrus hops is prominent here. Flavor follows the nose - it's awesomely citrusy and juicy with a nice bitterness and a only minor malt character. Very light and easy to drink. It's medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is an awesome IPA that's packed with the flavor of a DIPA but with a lower ABV that makes it dangerously drinkable. I'm so happy that Ballast Point now distributes to DC as this may very well replace Bell's Two Hearted as my go-to IPA."

"Overall: A really good IPA. I wouldn't mind trying it out on draft sometime to see how good it tastes. For all the hype, I should still be drooling by now."
""

"Overall, meh, decent IPA but i didn't see the 98/100 here. Or maybe my bottle is too close to it's ENJOY BY date."
""
""
"O - A fantastic IPA that is truly unique and holds up to its bottle description. It does have a mean bite that quickly fades into a light, fun, fruity IPA with a great nose and interesting variety of fruit."
"Overall, an amazingly balance IPA that is extremely easy to drink. A great marriage between malt and hop and bother perfectly compliment one another. A must-try should you ever come across it."

"GREAT IPA...GREAT BEER!! This is one of my go to favorites and I have a hard time not ordering it any time I see it on tap."
""
""
"If you see it on shelf, and it's reasonably fresh, go get it irrespective of the price. Too bad I don't live in San Diego."
""
""

"O: This was a really good American IPA – not my favorite and was little disappointed because it was hyped up so much. But I enjoyed it thoroughly and would grab it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, one of the best IPA's that I've had. It's quite bitter without being overpowering. The types of hops (perfect mix of predominantly citrus and pine) are appealing. Just really well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty solid IPA, but I think I like the Big Eye a little more. This is not as well balanced and refreshing. This is a great beer, but I expected more based on the hype."
""
""
""
""
"This beer does not live up to the hype. It isn't a bad IPA, but it does not compare to some of the amazing examples out there...Triple Play IPA, HopDevil, Two Hearted, etc...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely purchase again."
"P.S. This was reviewed after drinking 2 pints of Enjoy By, so my palate may have been destroyed by that point. I also don't know if this was a fresh bottle or not. I HAVE had fresh Sculpin since, and was significantly more impressed. While I haven't actually written a subsequent review the scores here represent how I feel about fresh Sculpin, not what was written in this particular review."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The epitome of the West Coast IPA. Dry, scraping, and lacking in most of the malt needed to balance out the hops. If only the dry hopping lasted throughout the body, this might be my first perfect 5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- once again I am not a IPA fan but all these good ones recently have really been making me think twice.... this is a damn good. My first offering from ballistic and now I will keep a close radar on this brewery"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - a beautiful representation of an American IPA. Hits high marks on all facets. I caught a Sculpin while fishing in San Diego Bay which was a surprise but the beer living up to the hype is just as pleasant a surprise."
""
""
""
"Here goes my first review on Ba. I just started drinking craft beer last summer. IPA's for me has been love at first sip. I chose the Sculpin IPA after reading reviews here for it. I picked up a bomber at my grocer. The taste was very smooth and the IPA bitterness was right where it should be in my opinion. The hops are obvious but so well balanced that it won't turn you off even if you are a non IPA fan this is a good beer. ABV is appropriate and this could easily be a session IPA. Sculpin lives up to its name and does not dissapoint."
""
"The only thing I can say is when drinking it from a bottle, there is a little more carbonation which is not noticeable when drinking from tap. Otherwise, I don't care how I get to drink Sculpin...just that I get to drink it. A"
"O - For an American IPA, I just cannot see how to make this much better. Drinkability is superb, ABV is faintly noticeable (in a good way!) and the progression is well... perfect. This beer is fantastic."

"22oz bottle shared with a friend. Pours a hazed golden-tangerine color with a white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are juicy, tropical and citric with pineapple, mango, and mandarin with biscuity malt. Tastes are biscuity malt up front with a touch of light caramel followed quickly by pungent & piny hops balanced wonderfully with tropical mango and juicy pineapple notes. Mouth-feel is medium and fairly resinous; finishes semi-dry & bitter, but incredibly balanced with sweet and bitter. Overall, this is one of my favorite American IPAs, but I don't buy it very often because it's quite overpriced in comparison to other solid IPAs in an oversaturated IPA market."
""
""
"Highly recommended."

"D: Good stuff."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think one of the reasons that this thing is so awesome is that I was able to get a fresh bottle (obviously fresher is better). Probably the best IPA I've had in my day. This thing is so balanced and drinkable. Really can't explain it, but you should just try one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Such an awesome beer! Easily one of the best IPAs out there. It is so well balanced and the citrus and tropical hop flavor is unmatched. The dry hopping shows through nicely and the simple malt profile keeps it perfectly balanced. Seem to always come back to this one."
""
"O: My first ever Ballast Point beer. Absolutely delicious. LOVE the smell, love the taste. A pretty prototypical West Coast IPA with a good hop presence but nothing too overwhelming. Very easy to drink. I could drink this every day! Believe the hype!"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is a good IPA, for sure. I think I was expecting more from it though, to be honest. I’ve had IPAs that I’ve enjoyed 5x more, to be honest, but this does the job and does it well while firing on all cylinders. Still, this was pretty good and I’d definitely try it again (especially if it was some special dry-hopping treatment on cask or something) but I’m probably not going to go out of my way to seek it out again."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent super hoppy IPA. Gigantically complex, simultaneously brash and nuanced. One of the best I've ever tried. Outstanding."
""
"Overall this is a good IPA, especially considering its age. Will definitely buy again."
""
"The taste follows the aromas, tropical, mango, tea with lemon, with a quite bitter, but still smooth, finish. IPA lovers, this one is worth finding!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great beer."

"After multiple samples of this beer on cask, tap, bomber all from Ballast Point itself, I find Sculpin to be inferior to Alpine Duet. This IPA is awesome- that is a fact. The head is massively rocky, leaves massive lace. But its superlative nose of mango peel, peaches, apricots is let down by a mostly voiding body, little butterscotch, very little creamy mouthfeel. More dry, seltzery, bitter. Still excellent, but it seems that Alpine Duet is more consistent with creating that butterscotch and peaches n cream/pineapple ice cream type flavor that Sculpin is just not delivering anymore. A shame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The citrus and tropical aromas immediately seduce you into the secluded part of the world where tourists disappear and legendary tales begin. Are you ready for adventure? Sculpin lets you know she’s not your everyday IPA as soon as you wash up on the shore. She flashes her delicate pineapples and you finally wrap your tongue around her sweet mangoes for the first time. You see little difference between the celestial bodies as both the sun and her white gold complexion refresh your soul and tingle your libido. Her hops playfully nibble and bite, but never lose sight of why you came. She wants to satisfy but she doesn’t want you to leave. Each sip is a tease that both surprisingly exceeds legend and leaves you yearning for more. You want her again and again. Her siren song calls you and you only. This is why you’re lost, sailor. It’s because you want to be."

"O- Solid solid solid IPA. Indeed one of the better ones I tried with interesting flavors and characteristics. If you are a big IPA lover and haven't got around to sculpin yet, you must! Glad I tried it at work today, hands down delicious."
"O: A really solid IPA that everyone loves. For me, it's not to my taste. I've given it a few tries, and I just can't get myselft to like it. But, I think for those that like strong IPAs, it's a winner. So, drink and enjoy! I won't try and steal you beer. LOL"

"O- One of, if not the best single IPA out there. It is obviously hop forward and not quite what I would call balanced but for a hop head such as myself, this is a hell of an IPA. Really wish this was distributed to my area."

"O: This is just an amazing beer. I am so freaking happy that this beer finally came down here to Texas because this is for sure one of the best beers I have ever had."

"Good brew with a very decent mouthfeel."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a solid IPA with a nice fruity, citrus hop taste however it was definitely too bitter for my liking, which I think takes away from the taste a little bit. I would drink this again, however there are plenty of IPAs out there that I definitely prefer. I'd recommend trying this if you like fruity IPAs, if you don't like beers that finish fairly bitter I'd probably stay away though."
""
""
""
"Overall - I definitely liked it. The hops are amazing both in aroma and flavor. Again, my personal preference would have had this be a little more balanced in the malt department. But I enjoyed it and commend it. Will most certainly have again."
""
"O: This the standard in which IPAs should rate against. This is such a delicious beer. One of my favorites!"
""
"A-"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, in a vacuum, this is a decent beer, but it had been hyped up so much that underwhelming is the word that keeps coming to mind. It's true it IS very well balanced and drinkable, but it lacks any wow-factor for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ve had this before and thought eh, but this fairly fresh(from what I can tell) bottle is amazing and totally worth the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Enjoyable and worth trying? Absolutely. World class? To me: far from it. In my opinion, a beer like Nugget Nectar is beyond what this beer can do -- and it's more readily available. I don't want to call this too hyped up, since it is very good, but man, you expect a lot from a beer like this -- something I've been hearing about for at least three years -- and it just didn't fit the bill for the expected transcendence in the end. Glad I tried it, though, in the end."

"Appearance is burnt orange with a half finger of head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose is reminiscent of a fresh pine forest. There is some light malty flavor, but the big taste comes from the hops. The bitterness simply grows into a hoppy crescendo. Frankly, I would consider this more like a DIPA than a straight-up IPA since the tongue tingles even after the last sip of this offering is gone."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a thin, creamy off-white head. Aroma is fresh peaches and some caramelized sugar. Taste begins with a huge apricot blast, followed by a caramel and fresh bread middle. After that is a raw, resinous piney hop flavor that obliterates your palate. Mouthfeel is rich. Carbonation is a tiny bit high. Overall an amazing IPA. I wouldn't say this is my favorite IPA of all time, but its not hard to see why its ranked #1 IPA on BA."

"First time having it out of a bottle, and I think I’m lucky enough to credit Bauer on Newbury St. as my local distributor for having some fresh Sculpin in stock today ($9.99 seems like a deal...). Before I score this brew, I know the appearance will get a 5 because there is absolutely no way I can fault it. Judging by the overwhelming reviews I’ll add an echo to the chorus: this beer is outstanding and among the best in its class."

"O: As a proud California native, it is my goal to chronicle the many brews that have their roots in this great state that I love so dear. Where best to start but with this west coast IPA which has managed to separate itself from an already competitive class. A great single IPA which really showcases the depth of hop flavors. Somewhat pricey at $14.99 for a sixer at BevMo although well worth it given the quality of this brew. A world class single IPA."

"Overall a confirmation of my preference for West Coast IPA's and DIPA's (aside from a lone alchemist lurking in the northeast)."
""
""
"Overall: It's definitely very light on any caramel flavors and sticks to a light malt character to back up the hops. It's balanced towards being easy drinking and has a nice long-lasting foam on top of the beer to give it a silky mouthfeel. One of my top IPAs."
"Hayward Abbey Rating: 77"

"O: Superb IPA! This is a nice blend of the tropical and resinous utilization of hops. The malt also holds the body up giving it some backbone. Refreshing yet lingering."

"Overall: Magical combination of hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness balanced with a solid malt backbone. Incredibly drinkable for such an aggressively hopped IPA. Absolutely one of the best IPAs I have had. Could this be the one?"

"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours clear coppery orange amber. Small white head with light lacing. Nice citrus hop aroma. A slightly sweet, well hopped IPA with good malt balance. Medium bodied. A quite nice IPA, worth revisiting."
""
"Generally not as good as expected as far as taste. Almost a bit bland overall. Prefer IPA's more along the line of Odell IPA. Was really excited to try this one but meh. Not enough citrus tones overall and felt unbalanced. Maybe I got a bad batch. Too bad."

"Pretty standard IPA here; not really sure why it's rated so extraordinarily high on BA, but oh well. Bright golden body, almost completely opaque with haze, and capped with a creamy off-white head that retained well and left nice lacing on the glass. Nose is hop-dominant as would be expected, but not too aromatic, grass, citrus, subtle traces of ammonia well within tolerance. More of the same in the taste: citrus and pine hops, quite bitter, almost to the point of being a palate wrecker, biscuity malts in the background, lasting bitter aftertaste. Medium body, a bit harsh...not quite as smooth as some of the country's better-made IPAs, but still good quality and drinkable overall if you're in the mood for the style."
""
"All-in-all a good solid beer, but not at all what I expected in a balanced IPA. Most of the time I think IPAs as overly hopped up and never would have figured there'd be an IPA that was overly malted up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5) - Wholly deserving of its reputation. There are many, many other breweries putting out Imperial and Double IPAs on the same tier of quality, but this single IPA is extremely drinkable at 7.0% and is probably my overall favorite. It's really finely done, from start to finish, with my only real complaint being that my palate is perhaps a little to wrecked from the dryness (a ridiculous complaint given the subject). Overall this beer sets out to do exactly what it and all its peers set out to do: showcase the glory of the hop in a wildly delicious, balanced, super enjoyable pint. Get your hands on some and try it for yourself!"
"Overall: Very good beer. Glad I have unlimited access to it because I will be drinking quite a bit of this this summer"

"Finally got a chance to try this, one of the highest reviews IPAs on the site. I must say.. it lives up to it's billing. One of the most well balanced and flavorful IPAs I've had, satisfies the hophead in me but isn't overly bitter and remains smooth and tasty. Not much can be said that already hasn't been, but if you get a chance to try it you should without any hesitation."

"Ah, finally, an IPA that is really good. Seems a lot of the ""hey lets make a brewery"" brewers are producing things that are labelled as an IPA, but really taste like old stale hops! Don’t get me wrong, you have a few out there that are making some really great IPAs and this is one of them. Clean, fresh, bitterly hoppy, foamy, citrusy...hits all the marks! Really nice IPA!!! I’m drinking one now!!!"
""
""
"Nice looking beer, a very bright golden color with a white head that sticks around for a few minutes before dissolving into thin lace. Very clean bright hops in the nose, a mixture of pine and citrus. Taste is also very clean citrus hops with a sharp blast of carbonation on the tongue melting into a nice orange/citrus peel finish. Very drinkable!"
""
""
"Taste starts sweet, some hops stank funk in the middle, citrus pine bitterness to the close. Mouthfeel is oh-so smooth, and drinkability is excellent, esp for the abv. Survey says, ding (the sound, not the former ba), we have a winner!"
""
""
"A pleasant, full flavored and full-bodied IPA. In fact, there's enough to this that I'm surprised it is not an Imperial IPA. At 7% abv, it is close, but its the dominating feel and bitterness, and not a booziness, that gives me the impression this is a DIPA and not an IPA. Definitely worth a try!"

""

"Drinkability – Goes down easy. A very nice IPA."
"Overall (4.5/5): An excellent IPA, and because of its refined yet uncompromised hoppiness, more accessible than most. When you see it on draft, do what I did and order one. (As an aside, iit would definitely be nice if Ballast Point added bottled-on dates to their bottles rather than simply printing a hard-to-decipher code on the label–when this beer is fresh, it's definitely worth the splurge (commonly $9–10 in MA).) Damn good."

"Overall: This is a well done, but expensive beer. I really should be fresh and poured into the correct glass to experience all of the nuances. I am not sure that mine was the freshest.

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating legible on the side. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, mango, orange, pine, honey, tropical fruit, and light herbal spiciness. Fantastic aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, lemon, orange zest, herbal spiciness, honey, and light biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon, pine, orange, honey, and herbal on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and smoothness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fantastic creamy, crisp, and extremely smooth mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is extremely well hidden; with almost no warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible IPA. Huge flavor balance and smoothness. Extremely easy and pleasant to drink for 7%; with a fantastic mouthfeel."

"Overall this is a really nicely hopped, refreshing, crisp and leaves me wanting more. Perfect ABV level, no dominating alcohol flavors and the perfect IPA to enjoy any time. The world is saturated with a lot of good IPAs and a lot of bad ones, but this is at the top of the great list, way above average."

"A truly wonderful beer, I can absolutely taste the respect and love Ballast Point puts into this beer. Definitely worth seeking out."

"O - I really enjoyed the Sculpin IPA. It's a great regular IPA. I don't know if I'd routinely buy it considering the $10 a bomber price. Lives up to the hype though!"

"O - I'm kind of surprised by the mild bitterness. I was expecting a west coast hop bomb. It is very tasty and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O: Super solid. Better than the Big Eye IPA. This beer certainly lives up to the hype. Taste fresh. Taste great."
""
""
""
"Wow! Good stuff! Glad Ballast Point made it to OH. No bottle date but I'm pretty sure it will always be fresh bc I can't see it sitting on shelves for long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best way to describe this would be to use one word: CLEAN. The beer doesn't have a huge muddled earth presence, and the flavors are in balance without getting in each others' way. The feel is crisp, clean and inviting, and this beer is clearly crafted with the utmost care and diligence. Well worth a sip or two."
"What a great all-around IPA. Solid aroma, great mouthfeel, flavor that just keeps lingering. I've had the privilege of enjoying tho on tap which is obviously the best way but even out of the bottle this is a great beer. I love this beer in my top 10 maybe even top 5."
""
"O: Very good and drinkable IPA, fruity, floral, bitter"
"O - At first I wondered if this is what happens to IPAs if they sit on the shelf for a long time. I'd heard that hop signature drops way down with age. But I decoded the freshness dating and it's a month before its best-before date, so I guess this is how it's supposed to be. I'm not an IPA guy but keep attempting to appreciate the style. If they were all like this, I wouldn't have a problem with the style, and in fact this satisfied the nascent hop craving I've started having. Maybe my palate is finally coming around. This is a tastefully restrained and classy brew. I might even like for it to get just a bit more rambunctious. I would recommend this to anyone who has been put off by the bitter beasts of the style and wants to venture out again."
""
""
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly, highly recommended."
""
""
""
"A light yellow copper color with a sturdy white head and fantastic lacing. The aroma offers a floral sweetness and mild citrus hop. Very pleasant but not powerful. The first swallow gets tasty grainy bread with a polite lemon overtone. Almost a rye quality, grassy too. A medium bodied brew with lightly viscous, yet peppery feel. I consider it to have light but full carbonation as well. Highly drinkable and understandably popular!"
""
"I would consider getting more of this and nobody in their rght mind should ever refuse one!"
"O- Overall I think the top rating on BA is well deserved. Only a real hophead is going to like this one, but that's me. Well done."
""
""
""
"As good as advertised, and a welcome addition as one of my new favorite American IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Here in the mouthfeel and finish is where things get slightly tricky. The warm malty aftertaste is balance nicely with a firm hop bitterness but there is a confusing lack of carbonation. Surprising because of the aggressive head but not so much so when I feel the hop oils on my teeth. All of this leads to a smooth, extmely drinkable character with a sharp bite. This IPA was a pleasant surprise and one I will continue to buy. If you see it, get it. I put it on almost the same level as the Majaraja by Avery, which is one of my favorites and a double IPA. Consider that hop heads!"

"Smell is like i said before, nicely fresh, hoppy, fruity, and floral...but this time a good. Flavors have a kick of pine and lemon around the edges, with mango and peach in the middle...I don’t find it that one-dimensional this time...in fact, I think the hop combination in this one is rather awesome. I reckon this bottle was a lot fresher than the first one I had...not sure of release dates, though I know this bottle just showed up, so its gotta be fresh.."
""
""
""
""
"out there. If not fresh, avoid it as you will be dissapointed, and will not get the true quality of this beer."
""
""
""
"It tastes even better, very smooth and juicy from the hops. Not very bitter at all. The first few sips had me thinking ""whoa...""."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a tulip glass. poured an orange color with about a half inch of white foam. The smell was not noticeable. The beer did not have a particularly notable taste or mouth feel. The beer did leave a lacing on the glass. Overall I was disappointed. Was really looking forward to this since I found the strong hoppy flavor of Big Eye to be an incredibly enjoyable beer. I won't be buying Sculpin again buy will continue to try Balladt Point based on my experience with Big Eye."

"Overall: I absolutely love this beer! Not only does it have a great balance of hops and citrus but I think what separates this IPA from most is how crisp it is.  It's an expensive beer but for hop heads the taste  justifies the price."
"Even though this doesn't quite meet my expectations, it's beyond solid and very easy to drink. I just wish the flavors did a bit more for me."
""
""
""
""
"O- A really good IPA, definitely will seek this out again."

"High B+"

"12oz bottle split with my old man, poured into a pint glass. Appearance is hazy orange with a one finger cream colored head that receedes to a decent film. Smell is of orange, pine, grapefruit, maybe a hint of mint. Taste is sweet malts, bits of orange and pine, rather smooth for an IPA mouthfeel is thicker than average for an IPA. Pretty decent, but didn't knock my socks off."
""
""
"Overall impression: A West Coast hop bomb for sure! The bitterness is very firm and bordering on harsh. That being said, I like that. Drinkability suffers a tad but this is my kind of dry IPA. Nicely done. Welcome to Ohio Ballast Point!"
""
"Just another very good IPA. Solid throughout."
"O: This is a great IPA. It's got a unique taste which I've never had matched. I don't know if it'd be my everyday IPA, but it's one that's unique enough to want every now-and-then to enjoy something completely different."
""
""
""
""
"Nice aroma, though. The usual orangey amber in the pint glass. I thought I would try this again since it's been a couple of years. But I arrive at the same conclusion: total bitterness. First glass out of the keg at Quality Social in San Diego. Couldn't be fresher."
""
""
"O- a solid ipa from San Diego. My one point would br how good would this be fresh?"
"Awesome! Totally worth checking out. The only thing that would keep me from buying again is the price tag."
"Overall - top notch. One of the best IPA's i've ever had..and I'm not just saying that. White Rajah, Headhunter, Sculpin...best IPAs ever had(not in any preference either.). Every beer I've had from Ballast Point has been amazing, keep on doing great work guys!"
""
"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says best by 070612. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (mango, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pine, citrusy (mango, grapefruit, lemon peel) and spicy hops, and some bready malt. There's a nice lingering bitter/fruity finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and has good carbonation. This is a very good brew. But at $14.99 a 6-pack here in Ohio, I can get either Columbus IPA or White Rajah at a much better price. With that being said, Sculpin is definitely worth trying, I wouldn't turn one down!"
""
"A very good IPA I can drink regularly if I wasn't in the mood for the more bitter hop character IPA's."
""
""
""
"O- What a great beer. At first I had trouble realizing why it was so highly revered but, now that I've had it a few times, I see that it's all in the subtleties just like Bell's Two-Hearted."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a frickin awesome IPA. This was my first time having it, and there's no doubt it'll be in my near future. I'll put this up there with some of the best IPAs I've had.."
"Overall pretty tasty, definitive hop bomb show casing the hop. World class eh so many wonderful IPA's hard to tell but defiantly very tasty one."
"This golden-orange colored pour has distinct peachy aromas. Pine flavors up front with citrusy bitter hop notes on the finish. It has a pretty effervescent carbonation that really wakes up your mouth. Kind of a raw, ripping IPA that's big on hops and packs a tingly punch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer's a bit of an enigma. I really don't know how to rate the mouthfeel properly. It's so amazingly light and clean, that it's nearly a detriment. The hops are prominent, but not aggressively bitter. Great beer, but probably not worth the high asking price, which is nearly double the price of it's competitors."
"A great ipa, although I'm not sure it deserves the legendary status it receives. Like how the hops aren't necessarily punch you in the mouth, although I feel like this beer could use some more malt backbone to give it a bit more balance."
""
""
""
""
"O - Well I finally found this brew I my local beer store, and I gotta say that it's pretty darn good. I really enjoyed the softer tropical fruit flavors of the beer, and the fresh dank hop flavors. The mouthfeel is lite enough to quaff, not over carbonated or full bodied and syrupy. Really good stuff, I'd say give it a try when you can, but make sure it's fresh! Cheers!"
"o: Very solid and oh so familiar. I hope im not just getting tired of beer.."
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing and balanced. Worth the few extra bucks this thing costs. A hop aroma like this is hard to come by. It also helps that this beer reminds me of a sandy beach on a warm summer day."
"Sweeter than expected, but tasty and balanced...I think my bottle might have been a touch old, but it was still great."
""
""
"O: I'm not going to give this beer a 5 overall (I think it's overrated), but overall, it really is pretty great. A touch of fruit, and not so bitter (70+) as to be obnoxious, but astringent enough to please hopheads like me. Light, approachable, drinkable, and yummy. Recommended, with the caveat that it's not going to be as good as you probably think it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is my new favorite IPA hands down. Just fantasic, get a bottle as soon as you can."
"The Sculpin is really, really hoppy on the palate, but smoother than expected. It's on the verge of ""too bitter to enjoy"" without going too far. The finish is bitter and long, yet fairly clean and crisp for such a hoppy monster."
"Sculpin sports a pale-orange, clear body with a touch of the foaminess on top. Grassy, herbal, piney and citrusy hops play over top a candy-like malt aroma. A taste reveals pretty much exactly what the aroma hints at: A nice blend of all the classic hop qualities, well balanced by the mild sweet malts. It's bitterness is very firm but not overbearing. it finishes very nicely with a medium body, and not too sweet. Overall a top-notch IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's hard not to call this my favorite IPA but I literally buy the entire lot everytime it's around. Even then do I have no trouble drinking them while there still fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an extremely well-balanced and enjoyable IPA. Incredibly easy to drink and full of flavor. I'd love to have a stockpile of Sculpin in the summer. Without a doubt one of the better IPA's I've had."
""
""
"It must be said that at my first sip, I thought this beer was a little watery and not all that special, but about 3 sips in, I realized how wrong I was. Not only is Sculpin IPA worthy of it's position at the top, but it's also just a regular IPA, not a DIPA. And to judge it against other IPA's truly proves how great it is."
""
""
""
"All in all, a very good representation of a west coast IPA. Would be great with an extra sharp aged cheddar."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a hell of a beer. Tasty, hoppy, and bitter. Tropical fruit and citrus dominate with pine coming up in the back. I typically like a bit more malt/caramel flavor in my IPAs, but this one seems to keep my interest with a balance of hop flavor and bitterness."
"the mouthfeel is a bit sticky with some residue, but works well with the hop/fruit sugar balance in the taste. overall it's a very enjoyable ipa - not a standout gold medal, although perhaps when very fresh, but still heads and shoulders above many on the market and one i would gladly reach for on a warm day."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty terrific IPA. Strong in all respects. I almost found myself looking for an area in which this beer didn't deliver, and I didn't find it."
""
""
""

"Would give it a higher score if it came in 6 packs for the latter. I could use a day off and a sixer of these."

"O -"

"O: I wish I could get this all the time, I love juicy IPA's, so this was right up my alley."
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is like a non-syrupy fruit nectar. The body is truly thirst-quenching. It glides over the tongue easily while being just heavy enough to properly carry and deliver a tremendous amount of flavor. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy, making it difficult to notice. This is certainly a good thing as the lack of fizz causes no distractions. The carbonation is, however, just strong enough to properly match the body and create great drinkability."

"OVERALL: Although I wasn’t thrilled with the mouthfeel and the appearance wasn’t perfect, it was exceptionally close. I don’t want Ballast Point to ever change this beer, this should be the standard every IPA maker strives for."

"O) Excellent beer, glad to have had fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: I can count on one hand the number of times that I have truly been wowed by an IPA, but this is one of them. The hops are potent, but not overpowering. The fruitiness of the hops mix well with the malts, and the slightly resinous floral taste on the finish is excellent. A strong competitor for the best IPA I have ever tasted."
""
""
"O - A top notch IPA for sure, very drinkable."
""
""
""

"Overall: A, but too expensive to buy frequently"
"Overall: One of the best beers I have had. It is always worth picking up a six-pack when it becomes available."

"overall i loved the nose of this, and the taste was very nice. seems very fresh could drink this anytime"
"D - Good but I'm not blown away. I'm trying to get away from direct comparisons but this feels like a slightly thinner, less flavorful Hopslam."
""
""
"I have this on tap and in the bottle. This was the first beer I had at Ballast Point Brewing Company. The color is a nice golden orange color, that reminds me very much of the Sculpin fish that this is named after. The aroma is rich with many different, smells, the strong is that of citrus fruits with orange and grapefruit being some of the strongest. A very hopy taste with with a nice balance of flavors, the cirutus flavors are balanced nicely with that of the malted hops. Over all a great IPA"
""
""
""
"I bought this beer without hearing anything about this beer or Ballast Point. I tried another IPA from ballast point, big eye IPA it was ok but when I opened the Sculpin the aroma was awesome. Tropical fruit filled my nose and a peach , apricot, mango and citrus flavor hit my taste buds and then a nice dry bitter finish. I live in Indianapolis and I can not get this beer but I drive an hour and a half to Champaign, IL to get it. Sculpin is ten bucks for a bomber and I will not spend that much very often on a beer. I have bought 2 cases of bombers so far. It is the best IPA I have had. It is also the best beer I have had. It is a fruit hop foward beer that I could drink everyday. I tend to like all the fruit hop foward beers but many are only good to have 1 or 2 before your taste buds are over saturated, this beer is exceptional"
""
"Served in a standard shaker glass with a thin white head. Golden in color with good clarity. The nose is bright and hoppy with fresh citrus scents. Taste is much bolder and more complex than the nose. Plenty of citrus hops but also alot of sweet malts which give some depth to the palate. Strong bitterness in the finish with a dry mouthfeel. Fine tasting IPA from the west coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I must say that I like a damn good IPA and Sculpin just so happens to be one of those. North Carolina just doesn't seem to carry anything but the 22oz., but I'm alright with that. Sculpin is the type of IPA I could drink at any given time... like right now! One of my favorite IPAs of all time. Nice job Ballast Point!"
""
""
""
"O: Had a chance to try this on draft and I'm definitely glad that I did. Draft is far superior to the bottle imo. The bottle is a bit thinner and lacks the wow factor. Definitely one of the better IPA's I have had. Overall, a very pleasurable drinking experience, a little pricey though but I guess you get what you pay for."
""
""
"O - My first Ballast Point brew, and I think it was a bit overrated. It's a solid brew, but I think I've had several that were better. However, I might be a bit jaded from all the awesome DIPAs I've had lately."
"so i poured this beer into a pint glass, the appearance is a nice dark copper color with very light champaign bubbles, with a nice frothy head that leaves a nice bit of lacing, it actually held it own from the top of the glass till the very bottom. mouth feel is smooth with light carbonation with a nice hop dry/bitterness taking over. i did taste some light sweetness..maybe syrup or a light vanilla taste. smell is piney with good slightly bitter hops. i did notice that in the initial bitterness there is a grape fruit and maybe orange rind coming through,but quickly calmed by that sweetness in the after taste. A.B.V is subtle and actually hidden by the sweetness that stays on the tounge. a great beer good balance. i enjoyed this very much, and could definatly see this stocked in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow, what can I say? This is truly a world class IPA and one that is definitely worth seeking out and/or trading for. Perfect example of a west coast IPA. One that all others to be judged against. Wonderful job Ballast Point!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Stella glass. Pours a hazy orange yellow with a sticky white two inch head, leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is grapefruit, fresh cut grass, passion fruit, and pine. Taste is very balanced with all flavors, grapefruit maybe most prominent. Body is medium, perfect amount of life, on the dry side, and very drinkable. This is a great IPA not sure of its age, but awesome despite that huge problem."
""
""
""
"O- An amazing IPA, super flavorful and drinkable. I'm a big fan of the citrus-forward IPAs, if I could get this in Chicago I would buy it all the time."
""
""
""
""
"O - I had high expectations of this beer and I was not disappointed. Great West Coast IPA with exceptional balance and drinkability. I was happy to be able to get this one fresh at Abe's. I will definitely get this one again."
""
"Pours an orange color with a nice one finger off white head. Good lacing on my glass. Clear in appearance. Nose is tropical fruit, along with a little lemon zest. Definitely nice smelling IPA. The taste follows suit, and is excellent. Feel is medium w/ a thin malt backbone and somewhat dry finish. Overall, a great IPA- and one I'll have again. Cheers."

"If there really is an alternate recipe, please BP go back to your roots. Let me once again give this golden drink the score it deserves."

"O- Best IPA I've ever had."
"Orange colored Indian Pale Ale with a soapy head with wonderful lacing. Overall the hop profile was good, the beer was almost oddly smooth for 7% abv, with a fantastic lingering mildly bitter hop finish. Overall, a solid and smooth IPA definitely worthy of a try but did not really live up to the hype in my opinion."

"Color is light amber to orange, with a huge soapy head that lasts and lasts. Lots of lacing on the glass too - this one's a beauty. The smell is other-worldly, with citrus hop scents assaulting the senses - mango, pineapple, and orange. Huge hop flavors continue into the taste as well. Delicious grapefruit bitterness builds through a crescendo that peaks with a tangy bite in the finish. Hop oils coat the tongue, and put a smile on my face. Perfect carbonation. If you love beer with a big citrus hop taste like me, you must try this one. It's one of the best. I don't see anything that can be improved."

"Cost: $8.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."

"overall pretty darn good IPA. maybe a bit steep for 10 bones a bomber, but good stuff regardless. been wanting to try this for awhile now, and it finally hit the shelves here in NC. great west-coast style IPA. would like to try on draught sometime"
""
""
""
""
"The taste is really quite nice, lots of citrus and tropical fruit, followed by some piney notes and a slight bitterness. The malts are much more noticable in the flavor than they are in the smell. Much more balanced and well rounded than the nose would indicate. Medium bodied and mildly carbonated. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and very easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall; I've certainly had worse IPA's however this one left me feeling slightly underwhelmed... I'll pick up another bottle at some point to compare but as of now, color me unimpressed"
"O: Easily one of the best drinking ipas for all reasons, whether its the full flavor, brilliant use of hops, or how dry, crisp and refreshing it is. An amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I was a little disappointed at first because I expected more tropical flavors. However, after I ordered another IPA I truly realized how great Sculpin is. The hops really stand out and dominate. I think it really is one of the best IPAs I've had."

"For those interested in extreme bitterness or hyper-West Coast-style IPAs, this would likely hit the spot. Sadly, though, all of the greatness I've heard about this IPA is just not there, and that includes descriptions filled with rich fruity characteristics that, at least to this palate, simply do not exist to the extent that others have claimed. Perhaps this is a different beast when fresh, but right now it strikes me as just that -- a beast, and a bitter one at that. If you're looking for extreme bitterness in your brews, then by all means, this is sure to hit the spot. But if you seek nuance or big, bold flavor, look elsewhere."

"Sculpin India Pale Ale by Ballast Point Brewing Company is an average example of the style. I found that like many IPAs, the pine flavor was overwhelming. I don't find skunky, bitter, and unbalanced beer all that appealing. On a positive note, it was a gorgeous amber color. I liken it to a hot blonde with bad breath."

"O: Very tasty ipa, and wasn't surprised at all. I say it's close to wipeout ipa, but not as bold(by little). I saw that this beer as very balanced, and I like that. You can't really go wrong with any beer brewed in San Diego. Sure I would defiantly recommend, and pickup. Cheers!!!"
"Flavor, great. Pine, floral and overall hop. Well balanced and a very amazing IPA. Its rated so high for a reason. Just go get one. Period."

"Single finger head with nice lacing on a amber gold clear body. Very nice sweet aroma with mostly grapefruit and pineapple notes. Flavor is very different with mostly a dry, pine and musty hop taste. Moderate to high carbonation and medium body. Overall a very good IPA"
"How much more can be said about this beer besides the personal stories. Yes, it's a world class ipa. I agree. I've been looking for this beer for about 3 years and finally found it at a beer store on long island. After so long you would think the beer would be a let down but infact it lived up to the hype. An outstanding ipa! Very hoppy but not harsh. So easy to drink for the style. Another highlight is the crystal clear orange hued body which is a little different. This is some beer alright. If you havent had it yet, look for it. Hopefully it doesnt take you three years to find."

"O: This is an excellent IPA, I love it and put it on the level of Double Jack by Firestone Walker. The only thing keeping me from giving higher ratings is the price, $10.99 for 22 ounces brings this down a lot especially when Hop Stoopid can be had for $4.99 for a 22 ounce and Double Jack for $7.99 for 22 ounces. I won't buy this again due to the price."

"Poured a orange/dark honey color with a thin white head. It had a grassy, piney hop aroma. The taste was balanced up front with some nice malty flavors and finished off with a refreshingly bitter flavor that lingers on the toungue. The body was appropriate to the style. It wasn't a hopbomb like I expected like most highly sought after IPAs are, but this was overall just a very well done beer. Nothing is overdone or overly assertive; it's just an above average IPA and an almost perfect example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorites for the style. Had it on draft about 6-8 months ago and was curious how the bottled version would compare. Not let down. Now if I could only get it more easily."
""
""
"O - This might be my first IPA with a serious dose of tropical fruit flavor. After taking the first sip, I immediately realized that I have been missing out! The smooth, drinkability qualities of this beer are just off the charts as well. I haven't seen this beer on the shelves in VA until just recently, and now that it's here, I'm going to stock up. Wow, I think Sculpin has just become my favorite American IPA."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I really enjoy Sculpin. Unfortunately, it's been a hit or miss with me due to the bottles not having a freshness date. There's no telling how long it's been on the shelf and I've ended up with a few bottles well past their prime. When it's fresh, Sculpin is completely deserving of the high ratings that it's getting here."
""
""
"O - A very well balanced IPA, not too heavy and not too light, hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Very enjoyable"
""
""
"This beer pours an amber color with a bit of white head. Has decent retention, but no lacing. Aroma is very assertive with lots of citrus hops, and a mild caramel note, with some floral honey like notes as well. Taste is very similar with a good, clean, mildly assertive bitterness balancing a mild caramel malt profile. Mouthfeel is light, dry and refreshing. Carbonation is a bit lower than I would have liked, but very nice nonetheless. This beer is very good. So many good IPAs around."

"Hazy pale golden colour, one finger white head sticky with some lace. Smell is of citrus and lots of hops, pineapple, grapefruit, some pine to a lesser extent, bready malt backbone, lemony scents as well. Taste is quite bitter, citrus, more pine than the nose would let you believe, grapefruit, mango and pineapple, lemon in the finish, malt is in check but second (or third) to the hop profile here. Mouthfeel is a bit light, light car, light-med body, some oils on the tongue as well. Good IPA, hits the mark on many things I like in an IPA, would have again gladly, solid stuff."

"D - Thick, rich, and impeccably well balanced. The fruity hop profile works very well with the malt and provides just enough bitterness to keep it drinkable. Not as pungently hoppy as some other west coast IPAs, but it is round and smooth in a way that you almost never see in this style while also expressing a really excellent hop profile."
"Overall: A very nice IPA that goes down smooth and will sneak on you in a hurry!"
""

""
""
""

"O: A great beer, one i'd be proud of. Matches well to any one of many adaptable situations. Great beer to pair with food."
""

""
""
""

"Overall : I have been hooked on this beer ever since I received it as an extra in my first trade on BA. Always a solid choice if you're a hophead like me. Very consistent taste have yet to be let down by this brewery."
""

""
"Had it on tap at Vintners. This is an excellent IPA. One of my top three in the category. The others being Bell's Hopslam and Dogfish Head's 90 minute. I think this compares very favorably to Hopslam. At least on the East coast you can't get this beer all the time. Great head and appearance - lovely golden color. Fruity aroma with a hint of hops. The taste is fantastic, not too bitter, just the right amount of fruit/sweetness to offset the bitterness from the hops. Overall a wonderful IPA."

"O- A very well done IPA. Give hints that it could be a DIPA with the amount of hop flavors, but the bitterness of a DIPA isn't there. Makes for a great drink. Would love to drink a sixer of this anytime. Thanks Josh for the bottles!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely an enjoyable IPA, but not on the same level as some of my favorites like Zombie Dust. Would love to try it on tap at the brewery sometime, but probably won't actively seek it out. Give 'er a shot, though, to see for yourself."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really nice IPA, but the undeniable sweetness and slight hint of alcohol lends it a bit of that medicinal flavor that I find undesirable. To me, there are better IPAs out there. Still, I'm glad I tried this. It is certainly different than the IPAs I have access to around here."

"O: This beer deserves the hype it gets. I picked it up at Al's of Hampden for $17 a 6pack. It was the first time I had every seen it on tap or in a bottle and decided why not have both. Definitely not disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time however due to intense fruity flavor and lack of a deep hoppy bitterness which I personally prefer. Sculpin is a high quality IPA, but to me stands out as more of a novelty than a standard."

"O. A really good, well made American IPA. If I could get this fresh it would be even better. The malt and the hops are in perfect balance. Neither outshines the other and the result is a beer that, at 7%, is just a little too easy to drink."

"Pours a really nice looking hazy orange honey type of color. It has about an inch of eggshell colored head, which fades into a small layer of foam that lasts throughout the whole glass. It leaves some nice rings of lace throughout. The nose on this one is citrus forward. I'm getting peach, orange peel, grapefruit, and lemon. Really nice. Taste is also dominated by citrus. I'm getting pineapple, peach, orange peel, and lemon. There's a sharp hoppy bitterness on the back end, paired with a malty sweetness. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is good, its thin and easy drinking with a nice effervescencee to it. Overall, Sculpin is one of the better selections, one of my favorite IPA's, definitely one I will grab whenever its around."
"O: Decent. A good one but doesn't stand out to me and for the price ($9), I'd much rather have a blind pig or a hop stoopid."
"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass. Beautiful looking golden cloudy pour with a 2 finger off white pillow head. Great lacing throughout and good retention. Smell was of citrus and apricots. A note of grapefruit on the end. Not an overpowering smell, but adequate. Taste followed the nose with was a good fit of citrus malts and adequate hops. Very much on the fruit end which was a surprise. Complex but not too tart. Hides the 7%ABV very well. Feel is full with a lot of carbonation. Not watery at all. Overall- A very solid IPA which is not really my style. Enjoyed the fruit tones with a good amount of hoppiness. Reminded me of citrus bubblegum which is a compliment to it's full flavor. Notes of cloves added to the complexity. A great sipper that I will be having several more of in the future. Very tasty-"
"Edit: had to bump this one up as it warmed. It's really classy."
"Overall: A great IPA that I'm happy I can get in South Florida. One of the best around in this region."
"overall, as an IPA this is still a pretty great beer, i'm just wondering what happened. it went from being phenomenal when i first tried (and reviewed) it in bottle to above average... possibly a fluke and i will re-review if so."
"O: Worth having. I feel this beer is slightly overrated."
"Overall-A solid beer for sure. Really good. Could very well be my number 2 or 3 IPA that ive had. Glad i tried this out and was able to score some."
"The taste starts all hoppy very fresh. The mouth fills with carbonation and quickly subsides revaling slight spicy and mostly bitter hops. A great IPA."
"O: a great ipa, really cant believe ive walked past this brew as many times as i have in the store and never once thought to pick it up, i must admit im not a big fan of their labels in general, great tasting, looking, smelling, and drinking brew"
"Overall: An amazing IPA. The citrus/fruity notes were very prevalent. The balance between sweet and bitter is perfect. Very well done. One of my favorite IPAs."
"I've had this several times, on draft, in bottles, in San Diego even, and I frankly don't get the ranking. I never get much smell off of it, and it tastes fine, but nothing special. I expected a blast of hops to the nose and the tasebuds, but it hasn't been there in over 5 tries. It was suggested that Sculpin must be absolutely fresh in order to shine, so I'll keep trying and revise this review if it ever happens."
"Fantastic beer definately worth seeking out."
"O- This is an excellent ipa worthy of being a world class beer."
"Really one of the best IPAs I've ever tried, I'd even choose it over Pliny. A must try, I just wish we could get it year round."
"O: My new favorite IPA next to Union Jack. Super balanced while still allowing you to get all the flavors."
"O: As you can tell, one of my favs. Get this beer now!"
"O: Great brew that never fails to please. Nothing better on a hot Cali night like tonight."
"O: A very yummy IPA. Have this one fresh - you won't beat the excellence. I shall be seeking out this one again."
"Cheers"
"Overall - This IPA cooks all cylinders. It's no Pliny or Heady, but it's pretty damn good."
"Pours a rich, thick head which dissipates after about 90 seconds to a cool, thin layer. Has a deep golden color with that white head. Scents of some kind of a peachy, grapefruit hit the nose. Possible warrior hops? Exploding creamy malt fired back by a buckling generosity of mean, kick assed hops. Very bitter, but the bitterness fades back as the malt catches up. Extremely refreshing. Super beer for year round consumption. Website says 70 IBU but I say this tastes to me as if it is in the 90's. If you are a hophead or an IPA fanatic, this is one for you! Not for the the unsophisticated palate, for sure."
"O-What a great beer. Clean and drinkable but still very complex."
"O - This beer is awesome. A great treat for the hop head, and a worthy beer to stock Ohio's shelves with aside the likes of White Rajah, CIPA, and Headhunter."
"O - Great beer, quickly becoming my favorite IPA. Solid."
"One of the most sessionable beers out there. Sculpin continues to be one of my favorite IPA's. Always fresh tasting regardless of age, this beer is a must for all IPA lovers. Strong hop flavor but not overpowering to the palate."
"Overall: Another example of a world class IPA, complex aroma and flavor, yet still very drinkable."
"Overall a tasty and very easy to drink IPA. Not outstanding in any respect except being very user friendly. I could see drink a pitcher of this by myself."
"Very refreshing and easy to drink. The hops are definitely here, just not intense. The nice balanced malt finishes this ale off, making for a very nice drink, definitely a session ale. The 7% ABV is not noticeable at all. OK this is not a “killer” IPA, but it is a very balanced and easy to drink ale. Definitely worth a test drive."
"Pale gold in color. Moderate carbonation leaves a decent head that settles to a ring of lace. Thick lacing remains. The aroma is citrusy- lemon, grapefruit, and pineapple. Flavor is American hops- grapefruit, juicy orange. Just enough malt to hold the bitterness. Very nicely dry in the finish. Overall a great dry IPA. Up there with Lagunitas and Stone IPAs."
"This is definitely a beer worth trying. It's got deliciously ripe citrus in its nose and a puckering bitterness in its aftertaste. Even though this is not a DIPA and can't fulfill all my desires for stronger sugars and alcohol, I have to give this beer some credit for working with what it's got. Very tasty and I may pursue this in future trades!"
"O: Only problem I have with this is its availability...Tis very hard to get!!! A super fantastic IPA, right up there with Pliny and HopSlam."
"O: great beer. Wish it was more widely available."
"Poured a 2"" white head with staying power. Lovely clear golden color. There's a strong hops smell featuring pine and grapefruit. Taste is a milder version of the same smells. There's a decent length finish. All in all I'd say it smells like a top rate IPA but tastes more mid-range."
"O: Remarkable balance; rich and delicious."
"O: Overall this beer is pretty damn awesome. Phenomenal hop flavors and mouthfeel. I look forward to this regularly and it never lets me down. 4.5"
"My go to beer if I could get it on a regular basis."
"I like this, I really do, but it's a palate stripper. It'll just blow me out after a few drinks. Ouch. This could have been a contender for best ever . . . need to fix up that finish. This is the most favored American IPA on BA, but I have definitely enjoyed Stone, Smutty, and 90 minute more than this."
"This pours cloudy golden with nice head and juice resin lacing. The smell is floral and mildly fruity. The flavor starts with a crisp bite but turns smooth with a subtle amount of fruit and punch-in-the-face hops. The flavor works through bitterness but it does not take over. I can taste some pleasant grassiness…but not overpowering. The whole feel is pretty much here and gone, but I would not classify it as “rounded” because of the lack of sweet malt. I love this west coast style, and would easily put this beer in my top ten. If you are looking for a rounded IPA with malt and hops at war, this is not it. If you are looking for awesome hop bomb that is easy to drink, this is a must try. Delicious."
"cross-posted on http://booksbitesbrews.blogspot.com"
"Drinkability is super high. I've had this a few times (the first occasional thanks to JohnMichaelson IIRC, thx!), and I love it, one of the best IPAs out there, in the a true west-coast style, exactly as I like them. I prefer it to Big Eye, which is another awesome IPA from Ballast Point, due to it amped up hops and lighter (e.g. nil) malt body."
"Overall – I've drank a lot of different IPA's and this one definitely stands out as one of the best. It reminded me a little bit of a Firestone Union Jack that meets a Bells Two Hearted. It got a great fruity taste and the perfect amount of hop bitterness. It might be a touch too sweet to make it sessionable, but it's surely a beer I'd like to drink every day."
"One of the great west coast IPAs. A hophead must."
""
"D: Very drinkable, though a tad bit over whelming. Too many of these beers would inevitably blow out your palate. Enjoy slowly!"
"The beer pours a super clear gold color with a high frothy white head that stuck around for awhile. Lacing is clumpy and random. Aroma is fairly piney and citrus-like but not as pungent as i would have liked. While the taste is very good i think i expected more of the fruity and tropical flavors that we all love. Lacking was the super fresh and juicy hop character i was hoping for. Feel is moderate to light making it quite drinkable. Slightly sticky with nice carbonation. Nice pale malt flavor is there but not dominating which is how i like it. I expected more out of the hop character but I will see if the next bottle I can get is fresher!"
"Overall: Great IPA, very drinkable. Really clean refreshing beer."
"Second time I have had this beer. Both times from a 22 oz. bomber. Great smell and color. Slightly less hoppy than other West Coast IPA's, but very well balanced. Pours foamy with a nice cream-colored head, not quite as silky as Russian River's Pliney, but certainly a tasty treat."
"D - I never grow tired of this delicious brew."
"O - Overall a wonderful beer, since I had Pliny before this, thats all it is, wonderful. I still think Unearthly ranks a little higher than this. Sculpin is a wonderful IPA however it lacks the flavor of some others. Great brew from Ballast Point, Looking forward to trying their Sea Monster, So far the Calico and the Big Eye have been spot on. Be sure to check them out."
"Overall, this beer pretty much lived up to the hype. It is well-balanced, flavorful, finely crafted IPA. Another shining example of a top-notch west coast IPA. I would love to find this on tap. This is definitely an A beer and should be sought out actively by any hophead out there who has not had the pleasure of enjoying this one. By far the best single IPA I've had."
"Had to edit after tryin an extremely fresh bottle. So amazing. Everything I wrote in the original review but amped up"
"great IPA, right up there with pliney IMO. and dangerously drinkable, this is something i could session all night. im definatly going to seek this out again."
"O: One of the best IPA's that I have had the priviledge to drink. Would certainly seek this out again and again despite the high price tag."
"Certainly one of the West Coast's best IPAs, harder than hell to get in Oregon, glad to have a chance to sample this quality brew. However, in retrospect, after my recent SoCal beer adventures, I'd put this tap version a bit behind Pseudo IPA, though the apricot esters gleaned from Sculpin are relatively unique, and this is an extremely drinkable beer I wish I could enjoy far more often. Tasty."
"O: I have to get my hands on a guarenteed fresh batch of this, because its a really really drinkable, light and flavorful IPA. Will revisit this one"
"I bought this on a whim because I didn't have anything hoppy at the house and was pleasantly surprised how good this beer is. Would love to get this on draft to see how much better it is."
"Sculpin has a reputation as one of the best West Coast IPA's and doesn't disappoint. The only knock is I would've liked a little bit more grapefruitiness to balance out the piney resin, but a small nitpick at that as this beer is still good, just not elite."
"Sculpin is definitely my favorite IPA, and that's no mean feat, especially for someone who doesn't sway to the hop side of the Force like me. It's got a deceptively sublime balance of bitter and sweet, combined with a refined mouthfeel, making it a marvelously seminal experience in craft beer. Damn good stuff."
"Overall, Sculpin obviously has its reputation for a reason. For my money easily one of the top 3 IPAs and the fact that it isn't always easy to come by makes it a nice treat when you come across it. One of my favorites!!"
"Overall: Overall I think this is a very good to excellent beer. Very balanced but it's strong hop presence makes it a real IPA. They have a lot of good things going on in San Diego right now..."
"Overall: Very solid IPA, but this one won't quite live up to its ""A" rating to me."
"Pours tea-orange into the glass, with a retentive frothy head. The nose contains a huge bouquet of pine and citrus elements. Flavors of grapefruit, mangos, pine resin, tea-leaf tannins and fresh grassy hops intermingle in a perfect balance. Although complex, each pull provides an easy quaff and a light-round mouthfeel. Carbonation is smooth, yet provides for a lightly zesty palate. Perfect execution of an IPA. Great brew."
"Overall - not a bad brew. Love the hoppiness of it, although it's not terribly perplexing."
"Overall: I had high expectations for this, and they were met. I think there are other comparably good IPAs that are probably cheaper, but I plan on getting this one again."
"O: Solid IPA, really drinkable and refreshing especially on a hot summer day like today. Wish this got distributed up here in WA."
"Great IPA. I would put this in the top 5 of IPAs that I have had so for."
"Medium body with the alcohol well burried, I'd have to guess it's around 7%ABV, very high drinkability and hop-head friendly...one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted!"
"if pliny is 1A, sculpin is a very close 1B. and at 7%ABV vs pliny's 8%ABV, i'm thinking that means you can enjoy about 14% more sculpin!"
"M/D: smoothly medium-bodied, perfectly carbonated. I'm not a hop head so the drinkability is a touch low for me, but if hops are your thing then you'll be in love."
"O - A great west coast IPA, very typical of the style."
"Poured a shade of gold that promises good things will soon come. Big white head, lacing, a bit of stick. Scent is impressive, lemony citrus notes, hops permeates the nose. Taste is a nice balance between the sweetness of the malts and bitterness of the hops. Not sure what is at the back, I guess bittersweetness. I have been waiting to try this and I was not disappointed. Overall, a great brew."
"Small 4oz pour at Mondial de la bière 2011. Appearance: Dark gold with lasting white head. Aroma: Spicy hops upfront, some citrus and a considerable malt presence (toffee, caramel). Taste: Bitter but not overly so, balanced with caramel notes and spicy hops. Palate: Solid with medium carbonation. Overall: A good IPA but I was expecting more from its reputation. Maybe it wasn't very fresh."
"Overall though it is a solid IPA."
"Pours slightly hazy gold with a great foamy white head. This is certainly hoppy. It is a predictable but welcome delivery of citrusy hops. This one brought Avery’s IPA to mind, just a little more balanced and a bit lighter on the palate. This is refreshing for the style with plenty of grapefruit and juicier citrus flavor. Malts are just sweet enough and not too thick. I’d drink this on a regular basis if I could."
"O: Last time I had this beer I was sure that it was the greatest IPA I've ever had. But this time I remember my other favorites from Alpine and Russian River. But I would put Sculpin in my top four to be sure."
"O: I still really like this beer, just not as much on draft mainly due to the grassy, planty flavors (as well as the hefty price tag of $10.50 for 20oz). Still it's a great beer and I'll go back to it plenty of times."
"Bronze in color with a thick, sticky, lasting head. Lot's of sticky lacing. This is what IPA's are supposed to look like. From the moment I pop the cap mango feels my olefactory senses. Other citrus fruits are noticable as well as sugar cane. Flavor follows the aroma with a huge hop bill that doesn't tear your mouth apart. Sculpin has perfected the balance. Again mango is what I notice first with other citrus fruits. Grapefruit, lemon and a touch of sweetness for balance. It appears they only used pale malts in this one. Thank goodness as that let's the hops shine. Mouthfeel is medium and both sharp and oily. Great beer by Ballast Point and I was lucky to find it while vacationing in Myrtle Beach."
"An excellent IPA for sure although the hype train leaves a tad bit to be desired, particularly in the aroma department. I’m stoked to finally get a chance to try Sculpin and while it may not be quite everything I had hoped it is still a fantastic IPA and one I would seek out again."
"Thanks to The Hulmeville Inn for featuring this beer and other great offerings!"
"O- One of my favorites. Fantastic IPA with only three or four others that I'd put in the same class."
"A wonderful IPA!"
"A great IPA that was very tasty, if you like hoppy beers then you're going to like this one."
"O: Very solid IPA though I could do without the backside pine character. Well executed and a delight to any IPA enthusiast."
"Very good beer!v"
"O - I was really looking forward to this one after all of the great reviews. I picked up this one on the beer road trip to SoCal. This is a really nice IPA done well and has a lot going on with good balance. A true definition of the IPA."
"Overall, if you're a hop lover, you have to try this one: the hop flavors are huge, but also well-balanced, and the result is delicious. I can see why this won gold at the World Beer Cup 2010; few beers can manage this level of bitterness, but still find taste, balance, and nuance at the same time."
"Damn you Ballast Point! Put bottle dates on your beers. This can't be a super fresh bottle! I've had this beer before and I remember liking it a lot more. I'll try it again but I can only blow so much of my money on old beers."
"O - I was really looking forward to this one after all of the great reviews but unfortunately I was left disappointed. Perhaps this is more of a brew for the hop heads that love the bitterness but for me I prefer a little more balance."
"O - I don't get the hype thats with this beer yes it does taste good but I feel like I can't breath before taking a sip because of the smell to each his own I guess"
"O- My favorite ever IPA in terms of something I'd love to have all of the time. Drinkable and a nice ABV that doesn't knock you out, yet still a good beer to get your buzz on with."
"Ok, to start this off, it poured a nice clean goldenrod with a thick frothy 2 finger head that is coating ever bit of glass it touches. this is a very clear beer completely transparent with lots of lively bubbles partially in thanks to the laser etching in the glass. the smell is a little pungent with a slight grapefruit/citrus with some banana and bready notes. the malts stand out at the end of the nose with a certain sweetness i dont mind. I get more citrus than grapefruit in the taste but you definitely get the bready taste more the end of the sip than the beginning with a solid pronounced malt backbone the whole sip. This has some lively carbonation that i enjoyed, lots of tingling from start to almost finish, with a slightly dry finish that makes you want another sip. overall this beer never really amazes me especially with it sitting at the top of the ipa list, dont get me wrong this is a good beer and has lots of balance to it but i dont think i get the freshest bottles because its no in distro in my area. so one day i may change my mind but this beer is worth getting at least once to try."
"This is a great IPA worth having....more than once."
"Narrative: The fish appeared slowly at first. They were reported within the streams of Michigan, then amongst the river beds within southern Kentucky. Soon all were pulling record “catches” and consuming huge game accordingly. What they did not know that the time was that the evolution of the punnet square had out evolved even gregor mendel himself. Put simply, this breed of fish had learned to feed on wild hop beds in the beds of nearly any algae, and offer itself up to sacrifice. The intense neurotoxins within the hypothalamus of the fish made the consumer feel as though they had done something exceptional. The fishing increased, as did the intense hop concentration. “I write to you now from a concentrated bunked in Utah, one of the only territories protected from hops, but, I smell the amazing grapefruit hops, maybe just a single bi-” AUDIO L0G DISC0nTINUED, ver 2.34t5"
"This is beer is just fantastic on draft! Very crisp, clean, and defined display of the the powers and qualities of hops!"
"Packed with flavor and well balanced, when I think IPA I think of this."
"My absolute favorite IPA. This is what good beer should be. The nose, the taste, the mouthfeel, the drinkability, the balance, and the ability to drink pint after pint...is all there. At 7%, it's perfect. If you're into your IPA's, and like something with some nice fruity tinges to it, this is it. I guarantee you can't have just one. I'm drooling just thinking about it whilst I type this review."
"O-This is such a great representaion of he style and I could drink them any time of the year"
"O: The flavour was a disappointment after the great smell. 3.5"
"Not an overwhelmingly hoppy beer, it does deliver a bitterness that coats the mouth. After a few more sips, it turns from it's structured flavors to a rather bland taste that overpowers the palate. This started out as a great beer but it does lack balance and leans away from its seemingly aromatic fruitiness. You definitely need to get rid of the blandness before having your next round."
"O- This is a good beer, but in all honestly didn't live up to my admittedly very high expectations. Definitely worth trying, and glad that I did."
"The smell and the flavor just aren't the quality they've been in the past. Bring back the clean juicyfruit hop bomb we all loved."
"Overall - A fantastic IPA, certainly one of the best out there."
"Nose is really hoppy, lots of citrus / grass / pine / floral battling it out for aroma supremacy. The taste is certainly hoppy throughout, but not as intense as expected. More of a clean, balanced, citrus/pine thing going on, a tad resinous. Light to medium bodied, with good carbonation, somewhat dry. A nice IPA, though perhaps a tad over rated."
"Aggressive pour yields a quickly-fading 1 finger head. Pours a dark golden, hazy copper. Nice, sticky lacing. Smells great - delicious citrusy, grassy hops and some slight bready malt. This is a bitter one. Very hop-heavy with little malt balance. Leaves a bitter, lingering aftertaste. Overall - a great smelling, bitter IPA. If you like more balanced IPA's - look elsewhere. This is a hoppy, bitter bomb."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers with a reasonable abv."
"The mouth feel is truly sensational. The bitterness the hops lights up the back of the tongue, the alcohol the throat, the hop aromatics the top of the mouth. Something to be savored, clearly not a session beer."
"I had this beer on tap at David Copperfield's here in NYC. I found it to be an exceptional IPA with a subtle bitterness and an intense lingering grapefruit hop flavor. The mouth feel was a bit resiny but quite refreshing, the beer poured with very little head at all and the color was a very clear orange. Reminded me of Sixpoint Bengali Tiger only a bit more fruity and not as malty."
"0 = Glad I tried it. Would be glad to try it again. Worth seeking out if you've not ventured in this direction."
"Glad I could try it but won't worry about finding it again. I can stick with normal Sculpin and be very happy."
"Overall, the beer is a bit too bitter for me and is more herbal than citrusy. But I do appreciate that it's fairly dry and drinkable, so I might try it again sometime."
"Some say it's a little over priced but I feel like it is fair for what you get. Great Beer!"
"O – Damn fine IPA and glad I finally tried this one. It’s a great brew on a hot eve or any eve. If you can find it get it and enjoy."
"I think that while my hop tolerance has climbed, I may not be ready for IPAs."
"O- Not a perfect balance between citrus/bitter and malty/yeasty sweetness... but it's fantastic just the same! Really comes alive as it warms up a bit. So happy that I've finally got to try this fresh!"
"HOLY $%@$!.Pours a clear, light amber with a two-finger, creamy, off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Okay lacing. Aroma is huge fresh grapefruit, tangerine, peaches and cream ice cream, huge butterscotch, caramel. Taste is fresh, citrusy, wet hops with butterscotch and a massive bitterness permeating throughout. Buttery, creamy on the palate that leaves a sort of oily mouthfeel. Wow."
"Overall, this is a good IPA. Very drinkable. Is it one of the absolute best? No, I don't think so after having it a few times, but I've never really had it super fresh (not that I can tell from the bottle; thank you, Ballast Point.) It's one of the most expensive regular IPAs out there, and, for the price, it's damn good but nothing too memorable."
"O-Its a good tasting brew, not the best I've had but good, worth giving this beer a try but again, for its price, give me a pliny...i would drink some sculpin again no doubt..."
"Overall this beer is good, but I'd say there are American IPA's from hotshots like Alpine, 3Floyds, Surly and even now the small DC Brau that have far better IPA's than this IMHO."
"D- Incredibly high drinkability. This is a summer day sitting on a porch of a beach house watching the ocean kind of beer that seems to disappear from the glass way to fast."
"First sip is bitter, clean and refreshing. Crisp carbonation, with a light body. Some fresh hop in the taste, gives way to a pungent grapefruity bitterness. This is extremely smooth and refreshing. Long bitter finish fades slowly, and ends dry. I can't find a flaw, other than it could be hoppier. I'm sure that has more to do with the age of the bottle. Very little malt presence. If it's there it's masked by the bitterness. Glad I have another half a bottle to pour!"
"O: Great IPA that should be experienced by all and a prime example of the style. Definitely will be drinking this one again in the future."
"Final thought - pricing sucks ($7.99 per 22oz.) Alcohol is low (7%). But, this beer is one of the best ever"
"Overall, a fine example of this style."
"These Cali brews are killing me! It makes me want to move out west for a month or two, just to visit some of these amazing breweries. While I’m more than happy with FFF, Founders, Bell’s, and the rest of the Midwest, I have had a ton of beers from the west coast that I can only describe as “showstoppers.” This is one of them. I guess it just goes to show: wherever you are, good beer can certainly be found."
"This beer is very hoppy but also well-balanced. Extremely drinkable. Another please!"
"O: This beer is a lot more balanced than I thought it would be, though it is clearly hop-dominated. I also really enjoyed the plethora of citrus and tropical fruits which were complimented nicely by the roasted malt character. I could use a bit more chewiness in the body as I found it to be a little thin, but overall quite good. Cheers!"
"A smooth, easy drinking IPA. There's good flavour here but I feel as if it doesn't live up to the hype."
"O: Overall, this beer to me is a reminder that all expectations are irrational. I was expecting a revelation, and what I got was a very familiar and simple tasting beer. What you have here is a wonderfully balanced and very drinkable IPA. I really have to give it another chance in a more proper and larger glass. There is no way I'll ever buy a bomber of this at 9.99-11.99 such as I see it here, but I'd buy it on draft again for sure."
"Overall a great IPA. Good balance and a good representation of the style."
"Overall: I found it refreshing but I prefer more of a malt presence in my beers. This would be good as a cool down beer on a hot summer day."
"This may not be the holy grail of AIPA's that some make it out to be but it is truly excellent. After drinking a number of other highly regarded IPAs on the same night and over the same weekend, I kept coming back to this one as the best of the bunch, with the tastiest and most complex flavors and best balance by far. Still, at $8.50 a bomber I may not buy this one all that often."
"O - I love IPAs, and this is a great example of the American style. I loved the one glass, but I think it's not quite easy drinking enough to have another few."
"O- Fantastic IPA with strong citrus notes, a beer worthy of its recognition. And also a favorite of the wife."
"I am so very glad I can enjoy this beer whenever I want."
"You can't get much hoppier than this. Cutting back the malts would be the equivalent of picking flies off an elephant to reduce its mass - they're insignificant as it is. This is about as lopsided as they come. And yet, that's why it's widely hailed as the best. And I'd certainly have a hard time arguing it as anything but the benchmark of its respective style. It is honestly the smoothest big, bitter beer I've tried. Thanks to Ultraman9000 for the bottle!"
"Note: I’ve had this both from the bottle and on draft. I certainly prefer the bottle. It has more flavor, stronger aromas, and is just much better overall. The draft form just didn’t do this beer justice and if I would have tried it on draft first I may not have tried it again, which would have been a big mistake."
"There was a lot I liked but overall very good."
"D-A little difficult to finish for me due to the combination of the very dry feel and the hop profiles used."
"O (D) - what an exquisite beer. Very excited that Ballast Point is supposedly coming to OH soon."
"O - Wow this was a really great IPA. If I had it available I'd buy this and Sweetwater IPA on a regular basis. An unexpected and very welcomed treat Evan, thanks man!"
"O - Nothing to say about this one that hasn't already been said. It's a great beer. Seek it out."
"On Draft Pizza Port San Clemente. Pours light golden with creamy white head. Strong aroma of hops and tropical fruits. Flavor is mainly C hops with nice malt balance. Combination of hop flavor w/ hop and fruity aroma is amazing. Very drinkable. Love this beer! So glad it's now in six packs."
"I had this beer pretty fresh from GBX in greenville, SC. Looks grest inch and a half of head pop and heavy lace. Smells like heaven, if heaven smells like mango and grapefruit. Good caramel malt with citrus hops, this is the kind of IPA I try a bunch of other IPA's for. Well balanced. Medium carbonation and just the right amount of boozey taste, I like a little. This one is a keeper. I wish I had a sixth barrel in my fridge at all times, paycheck willing. Good Day."
"Mouthfeel? How is this possibly a single IPA? This is the by far the single best single IPA I've ever tasted. Screw writing more of this review. BUY THIS BEER."
"O: A very amazing beer. Nothing wow sadly, but damn near perfect."
"O- I've had on a fresh draft which I believe was better than the bottle I picked up. I do not rate this on the higher end of IPAs you can get, and will not be stocking the fridge with this for my next get together. But I would most likely have one if I saw it on my bar's draft list."
"This beer was one I was really looking forward to trying. I can't imagine anything much better than my favorite ipa on Nitro. The color was your typical golden hue which was mostly clear. The smell was good but not as strong as the normal sculpin.Tropical fruit --mangoes, pineapple and orange pith. I can't tell you how much I enjoy the nose of Sculpin. The taste follows the nose. Plenty of tropical flavors that consist of pineapple,orange,tangerine and some mango. It is bitter on the finish but has that slight biscuit quality to take out some of the bitterness. I wish there was a way they could put this nitro in a bottle because the creaminess that comes from nitro has to be experienced to believe. Nitro adds a whole new level of mouthfeel to what I already think is a amazing beer and my top ipa. Overall I love this beer and hope to have it again. I wish the nitro version was a little fresher which would be my only complaint and therefore I enjoyed the regular version better. When I did the side by side of the two versions the color of the two was night and day different. I did enjoy the mouthfeel of this beer. Glad I got to try it."
"O- this is a great IPA that has earned the hype/following. if this was available locally i would be all over it. check it out if you get the chance."
"Pleasantly bitter and very light in the mouth. Very well balanced American style IPA. Masterfully well crafted!"
"Overall this is one of my favorite IPA's of all time. I happen to be from the Left side of the country so I cut my teeth on IPA's like this and will always regard them as the best of the style. I know I said this one was balanced but I said that it was for a West Coast IPA. It is still a pucker bomb!! It's just not Ruination. I have had many of these in the past but this one came as an extra from t0rin0. Thanks again to him. A must try!! Even if you have to spend the money and time to trade for it!!"
"Pours a mostly clear light golden color with three fingers of fluffy white foam. Very good retention, and some lacing. Smell is clean and freshly cut orange, white grapefruit, a little mango and spice. Taste is more red grapefruit, with malt presence and pineyness in the background. Moderately bitter. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA with great balance and flavor. I could drink this all day."
"The Beer guy at one of my spots was raving about this. He said he preferred this over Pliny. Well, not me. I'm still a Pliny guy. But I did enjoy this beer."
"If you can get this one fresh it's absolutely worth it and the nose is unique even amongst the ever growing masses of IPAs. Flavor is crafted with emphasis on fruity hops, not overly bitter but great refreshing finish."
"cloudy orange in appearance. head fades fast and leaves a white ring and a good amount of lacing. smells like a big bouquet of hops. citrus is most noticable and some pine, earthy hops also. taste is dominated by citrus/ grapefruit. slight pine taste just before the bitterness sets in. has a clean crisp mouthfeel with a slight dryness on the end. i'm glad my local shop finally started to carry this (or i finally noticed it) as this is an excellent ipa."
"I'm to the point now that if I see this at my local beer store I just buy as many as I can. This IPA is well worth the $2.75 a bottle I get it for. Sculpin pours out as a pleasing golden color with a nice soapy looking white head. The head settles and leave a white bubbly film over the beer that leaves a pretty damn good lacing down the glass. The smell of this beer is very inviting. It's got hops in there along with Grapefruit, lemon, orange, and a faint aroma of peach. The taste is very good as well it's gives off a really nice sweetness upfront followed but a cotton mouth bitter dryness in the back end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's a very pleasing IPA, once of the best that isn't an Imperial in my opinion. The more you have the better they get. I really hope Ballest Point never pulls out of PA."
"O - Some d-bag at our bottle shop sold my wife this older bottle saying they ""just got it in"". I was worried that it would be a complete drainpour, but it's actually not that bad. None of the uber-fresh hop character is there, of course; however, still plenty of grapefruit and tropical fruit flavor to keep me drinking it. It should go without saying, when you see Sculpin fresh or on draft, load up. Happy to have a little SD in my glass tonight, even in this shape. Cheers,"
"Overall - A great IPA that I can buy locally. Can't go wrong with it. There are others that I'd drink before this one, but none that I can actually buy here."
"Tastes are citrus hops and awesomely more citrus hops, maltiness, floral and unfloral hops, fishy yeast, peppery flavors -- aspicy backbone-- a little heat, dry sugar, canned soups, garlic, flower stems, rye, pepperoni, losanges and aged, bittersweet sweetness."
"O: excellent beer, really like the citrus flavors, I suspect this will quickly become one of my favorite DIPAs"
"If you don't like this beer then you don't like hops."
"Overall, one of the best IPA's I've ever encountered. My only complaint is that I have no idea how fresh the bottle was from the absence of a bottled on date. I'll definitely seek this out again and would recommend strongly for others to do as well. If it was only available in six packs..."
"O - Great IPA and an exceptional job of making all the hops work together and create a great IPA. I could drink plenty of this fresh. But one bottle will have to do."
"O: I think this was good, but the flavors and smell sort of fell flat. There was some sediment in the bottle so I plan on revisiting this when I know I'm having the freshest Sculpin I can have."
"Refreshingly different and drinkable."
"Couple half growlers of this confirm it as probably the best beer I have had. Orange-ish gold color has a frothy white head, leaving white lacing down the entire glass. Not quite as aromatic as the bottled version. Taste does not suffer. Lip-smacking citrusy hops and a perfectly-balanced body hold this brew down. Taste is smooth and bitter. A rare treat on tap or in any version. Fantastic brew that everyone must have."
"Average pour gets it foaming up close to half the pint glass, settles for a bit in the three finger range and then down from there, slightly off white, hard to imagine more whipped up froth and airiness, very good retention as well as gluey stickiness to the thick lacing streaks. Deep golden hue to the liquid, slightly metallic looking, consistent throughout, curiously for all the foam virtually no visible bubbles. Sour, zesty orange and grapefruit citrus sets the tone early in the nose, pepper and salt, fresh green grass, pine cone, pressed rose petals, wild yeasts, way in the back row you may find a few chocolate and coffee notes. Full-bodied, here the huge foaminess brings a creamy texture to balance against the bitter invasiveness of the hops. Grains, grasses, snap peas, pepper, coarse country breads, pine, coal tar, no doubt your tongue tingles and feels alive. The sour grapefruit, orange citrus leaves some room for the apricot, peach fruit to vaguely soften things. As in the nose, the cocoa, malt and coffee accents are super-subtle, more present at warmer temps. Given its high energy level is not over the top and pretty close to true stylistic form. Hard not to feel refreshed after a few sips, doesn’t need to be mixed with Red Bull."
"Roots to Ballast Point on this offering."
"O: a very good ipa. Probably one of the bitterest ipas I have had."
"Overall a great beer. I'll likely add it to my wants permanently once I clear my list a bit. I recommend this one highly to anybody who likes IPAs at all."
"Overall this is an impressive beer that both fits into the style guidelines of the American IPA and breaks them all at once."
"The body was pretty typical for the style. Drinkability was very good, you could easily drink several of these. Overall, a very good beer that I'd drink with some regularity if it were local to me. Worth trading for to try."
"O- Top 5 favorite IPA here, bitter citrusy and piney. The dry refreshing bitterness stands out most to me"
"Pours a slightly hazy, light amber with a finger of white, creamy head that lingers. Lots of bubbles keep rising at a decent rate for a while. The nose is excellent, lots of piney hoppiness coming through, very fresh smelling. The taste is more of the same, but with a deeper level from the malts that balances the hop flavors quite well, almost giving it a woody character. There's also a bit of citrus flavor at the end. The mouthfeel is light with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite enjoyable and has a nice balance between hops and malt."
"O- I really cant ask for much more from an IPA. GREAT taste that looks and smells great."
"O - this is a great ipa. not at all what i was expecting and not at all a straightforward ipa but man is it a great beer."
"Mostly some nondescript bitterness and that is it. Add the very thin body, and I am not impressed. Just an average IPA. Nothing I would really recommend."
"Overall this is a great example of an American IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice white head. A very mild citrus hop flavor comes off the nose. A very light, clean citrus hop flavor carries through the taste. Good balance - not too sweet and a good hop profile. Good mouthfeel, possibly a bit of extra sweetness in the body. Overall, this is a very good IPA. You can do far worse than Sculpin, especially fresh."
"O: Great drinkable IPA. One of my favorites to date."
"Excellent, very well balanced between the citrus and the hops. This is very drinkable...very well constructed brew. Possibly one of the best IPAs I have tried. Love the fact that this is finally available out in my neck of the woods. Would recommend this to anyone"
"Overall I appreciated it but there's too much hype attached to it. I actually enjoy their Big Eye more."
"Smell is a cornucopia of piney, grassy, floral, citrusy, tropical fruit hops. It is a delight. There's a bit of malt sweetness, but hard to be more specific while enduring the hop assault. Taste is also a big hop blend, with some apricot and peach fruitiness, finished with a sharp hop finish. The malt comes through in the slightly sweet mouthfeel, but not much in the taste. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium-bodied, and somewhat fizzy. Although delicious, the bomber was enough for me."
"Overall: A decent brew. I know it's rated highly, but I'm not overly impressed. If I had this fresh and/or on-tap maybe my grades would be higher for this beer."
"D- Slightly bitter finish, but a nice and easy to drink. Fizzy with good carbonation."
"Finish: Just sublime! The Hops are more evident at this stage and the fruit kinda takeas a back seat but nothing wrong with that. Best Single IPA on the west coast and maybe the whole country."
"O - a serious ipa just cause it's so damn bitter but if you can get past that there's a lotta love in this beer. Very refined. Honestly not my favorite but definitely impressive. Also a bit pricey but you get what you pay for as an ipa lover... but not if you aren't."
"Overall: Amazing IPA. This would be a great beer for beginners to this style, but also has nice complexity for the more experienced palate."
"Overall: This is a really good IPA, but I don't know that It lives up the the hype. Both times I've had it, it has been from a bottle, so I'll look for it on tap when I get the chance. It's really bitter, but not super interesting other than that. I would have it again."
"O - I was very excited to try this and really enjoyed it.. If it were available in this area I would surely pick it up again, but likely wouldn't go too far out of my way for it."
"O: A very well done beer from Ballast Point. I'm curious how well the rest of their lineup does."
"Overall: This beer can easily take on Pliny the Elder and hold its own, and could likely beat it, I think that this beer is phenomenal, definitely in my top 10 ."
"Overall this beer is outstanding when fresh. Has one of the best aromas of any beer I've tried. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to know if it is fresh without bottle dating. I would love to keep buying this but will not until it is dated properly."
"It's good, overall, though not outlandishly fantastic. If it were available in reasonably priced 6 packs, it would be a near perfect beer for a barbeque on a hot day, except maybe a little high ABV; it's not overpowering, the body is light, but it still has good interesting flavor. As it is there are more interesting things in its price range, but I'd certainly have it again."
"All in all, it's good, but very different from what I'm used to. There doesn't seem to be a lot of subtlety or balance here, it's just hops all the way through. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. This could really hit the spot when there's a hop craving, but for the most part I'd rather have at least some malt quality. Maybe it's just a regional thing though. Still very much worth having."
"goodbye sculpin!"
"This brew pours an impressive hazy apricot hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger fluffy white head with heaps of lacing,the smell is piney,citrus infused hops,boiled candy and pineapple,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of grapefruit,citrus zest,pineapple,boiled candy,a touch of marzipan and finished off with a nice sherbety,piney hop bitter kick and overall a very nice sample of an AIPA and will buy again before it dissapears."
"O: Really great IPA, very flavorful, smooth and light. Highly recommend this to anyone who can find it."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the fruitiness in the aroma. As advertised there were tropical notes, along with some more standard hoppy IPA fruits. This really is a breath of fresh air, as IPAs can run into the trap of being overly focused on the hops, while utterly ignoring other components of the flavor profile. The fruit was also present in the taste, which helped keep us guessing throughout the tasting."
"A good IPA; nice flavors, a bit thin for a hophead in both flavor and texture. Nothing offensive here, but slightly overrated in my opinion."
"O: An extremely flavorful IPA. Lot’s of tropical and citrus notes that make this one of the best IPA’s out there."
"The flavor is an explosion of hops! This is hop head paradise."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer very much. I've been wanting to try it for a while and it didn't disappoint. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Pours a vibrant golden orange, shine majestically in the light. Translucent body, fluffy head of medium sized bubbles. Awesome retention and lacing. Nose is all sorts of tropical. Lots of mango and lemon in there. Taste has more tropical fruit notes than the zesty citrus/lemon, but the lemon notes are still there to an extent. Body is medium light, malt isn't a huge presence here but adds some sweetness. Hops are really on display here, leaving a strong bitterness that's not overpowering. Well crafted and very tasty IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a fluffy white head with amazing lacing. The aroma is sharp and piney, with a firm citrusy hop character. The flavor is clean and sharp, all hop, with both a piney and a citrusy taste. In the background is a clean, pilsnery malt that proves the perfect vehicle to carry the hops, which are the stars of the parade, with just a little whiff of breadiness and light caramel. The mountfeel is slick and the citrus bitterness clings wonderfully to the mount on the finish, with an almost menthol intensity."
"Overall: A really nicely balanced, lush IPA. Nicely done."
"EDIT-Thought this was a DIPA, however as an IPA this thing is perfect so I've upped the score on taste to reflect the fact that the 70 IBUs is on par (if not above) the average for IBUs for the style. I have had the chance to have this beer again, the smell is great."
"This is one of those beers that makes me want to move to the West Coast. I hope to see cans of this some day. Perhaps that will increase its longevity. Regardless, this is so epic that it is worth the risk of buying a stale bottle."
"Snot I am starting to like IPAs more and more. Something about the great citrus flavor. Two finger head of thick foam, good full lace with much cling. Color is a 9 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of grapefruit, lime, malt, pepper, and pine. Taste is very sharp and refreshing, with flavors of grapefruit, pine nuts, lemon peel, roasted malt, and vinegar. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, with good zing. This brew sneaks up and kicks your behind. I will try to get some more of this fine beer."
"*Paired with King crab legs, Old Bay dusted shrimp and oysters on the half shell"
"Happy birthday to me!"
"Solid, but not as well balanced as I'd like. Definitely has a high drinkability, and it might be a good introductory IPA due to it's light body and non-overwhelming bitterness. Would I have another? Maybe. Would I buy another bomber? Probably not."
"I gave it a quick stir so it is a bit hazy pour. Small head but an oily film remains on the surface. The nose is a little weak. The noticeable west coast hops are here, probably cascade, willamette and a couple others. Does have a fresh quality to it. The taste is interesting. Not a bitter as I was anticipating. Nice fruit flavors of citrus and even peach?. A 7% beer, this is very light but is a little acidic. I already have been burping. This is a refreshing IPA and exactly what I wanted after work."
"D- Overall this is just another IPA. Hoppy but nothing overall interesting. Good but boring. Im looking for more than just hops and citrus. Need to stand out to get me coming back."
"Simply a great beer."
"D- Unfortunately I think this one has been over exposed to oxygen. I sure hope this is not the ""great sculpin"" i've been waiting for for that past few years. If so Captain Ahab wasting years on Moby Dick and so did I..."
"This quintessential American IPA looks like an orange pop with a big scoop of fresh cream on top. Dynamite nose of Cascade goodness. Way too easy going down, the carbonation of this brew just makes your whole mouth tingle. An absolute treat."
"O - Not sure when this beer was bottled, but it has stood up well to the time test. Not as good as off the tap but still a very good beer."
"O - just like an equatorial getaway, exceptionally refreshing, a distinctly new experience for me and one Im agreeable to repeating pronto."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery, this beer was served in a pint glass. I'm looking forward to this because I have had it before in a bottle and I have always enjoyed the beer. The colors are brighter than the Big Eye IPA that Ballast produces. The beer was slightly hazy, but more orange-toned to the amber coloring. The beer had no head to speak of. Heavy aromas of cedar and citrus hit the nose, with a very strong, hoppy background. Grapefruit sweet and tart on the tongue, with mild, peppery, green hops to balance. The beer is extremely well balanced, and ridiculously smooth. Tart and bitter aftertaste, with a surprisingly smooth finish. Well balanced and smooth bodied, I could drink this one all day."
"Thanks (again) to Dempsey16 for this delicious brew! Bottle to pint. Flagship for its type! Picture-perfect. Very good bouquet. Just. Plain. Tasty. Goes down as nicely as it hits your palate. If you can't get them, trade for them! The only thing better is a double..."
"O- Very nice IPA, amazing aroma and very tasty, very easy to drink, could throw down a couple in a sitting, very refreshing."
"O- Nice hopmonster if that's your bag, but that's just not my bag. It needs more balance than this."
"d: this is a bitter smack in the face, but as it warms, it is balanced better by the sweet malts in the middle and the grapefruit is beautiful in here. very tasty and would certainly try to get this in the future again."
"Overall: I'd be more apt to pick this up in a 6pack, but the bomber is good too. Delicious IPA."
"I had this on tap at Blue Dog in Chalfont and I wasn't that impressed, however in bottle form this is truly a world class beer!"
"Served from tap into a flared pilsner. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, pine hop, citrus hop, and subtle grapefruit. It had a medium feel (almost resiny) on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew as I'm sure you are all well aware. I had this awhile back in the bottle and it was quite heavenly. If I'm honest I MUCH preferred it out of the bottle as compared to the tap. It still had a nice flavor but it just wasn't as balanced. The pine aspect really overpowered in the tap version. It improved slightly upon warming up a bit but still lacked that heavenly aspect. Still a definite must try!"
"Pours a light orange with a bit of golden yellow mixed in. One finger pearl white head, good lacing throughout. Awesome nose. Mango, grapefruit, floral hops, bit of apricot and more awesome tropical fruit. Light, crisp and extremely well integrated hop flavors. Mango up front along with a hint of apricot and yes, peach, as advertised. The sweeter hops give way to grapefruit and lemon flavors in the middle portion of the beer. A bit of semi-bitter pine resin and floral hops follow before some of the tropical sweetness from the beginning of the beer comes full circle on the close. Awesomely hopped, extremely well put together hop forward flavor profile."
"This is the second growler I've had of Sculpin. The first one I got at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh and I liked it better. Next time I want to try Sculpin out of a bomber and see how it changes. Nice beer, but its cult status within the beer world is overblown, in my opinion."
"Drink and overall: Alright. 3rd of 4 West Coast IPAs from Brandon (one IIPA and one RyePA), and I'm really digging them. Im a homer, I admit it. And I admit I would be one if I lived in California too. Some hop goodness I could get used to!"
"I understand why it gets the acclaim it does, but its just not my favorite. It's good, but at the price, I'd rather a 6 pack of Torpedo and some change back than one bomber of this."
"O- Yes I gave it a four on taste but what makes the overall a 4.5 is the forgotten aspect of drinkability. After sniffing this for awhile I found it hard to take my time on this because of how easy it went down. 7%? No problem, the booze isn't found nor felt in here. Not the best tasting IPA but probably the most drinkable."
"O-This is such a great representaion of he style and I could drink them any time of the year"
"Overall this is a very good beer. Easy to drink, very tasty and refreshing. One of the best in style that I have had. Absolutely want more of this one."
"O: wonderful IPA. One that I will definitely trade for again."
"Pours a golden body w/ great head and lace. A hoppy nose for sure as well as piney and floral plus a touch of booze and sweetness. Easy to drink for being so hoppy as a medium body w/ citric hop bitterness and a mild, bready sweetness balance each other. On the backend there is a crisp, dry finish. Very hoppy but not a tastebud killer as I pick up some fruits like grape and sweet, plush fruits but those don't kill the minor malt presence."
"O - Obviously one of the top IPAs out there right now. Intense hop flavor that is well crafted yet balanced well and quite drinkable."
"One of my favorite brews. A very slightly hazy appearance, with a light copper color. Some spiceness and hop aroma is present, but tells nothing of what is to come. The taste is amazing, starting with a Mango taste, progressing to a spicy pineapple taste, and finishing with pine. Amazing. The first time I tried it, I thought it had some sort of flavoring added. One of my favorites, I love you sculpin!!!"
"I am absolutely in love with this beer and want more of it. I hope Ballast keeps coming with this one."
"Overall, this is a world class IPA. Drinks so well and is just all around great. I look forward to the next time I can have this one already."
"What a relief! This was a re-review of Sculpin. First time it got a C because I must have had a skunked bottle. This time much better. This is a great light IPA because it has a hop personality but remains laid back and unoffensive."
"overally this a very solid IPA, a bit more balanced than many of its west coast and san diego counterparts...tasty, but very overpriced IMO."
"O=Great IPA that I wish were sold on the East Coast. Worth all the praise that has been heaped on it."
"O - I had been looking forward to trying this for a while and it certainly lived up to it's reputation as being an exceptional IPA. Just wish it was available here a bit more often!"
"O: what can i say that hasn't already been said about this beer. its where the rubber meets the road for ipas."
"Pours a lovely pale yellow/orange color with a fine frothy white head. This leaps from the glass with a mélange of bright juicy sweet tropical fruit notes, yellow grapefruit, guava, canned fruit salad in syrup, cherries, pears, peaches. Perfectly balanced on the palate, this attacks with boldly bitter hops, a cashmere-like mouthfeel and a nice balanced lightness that makes this immenently drinkable. This has a lovely litheness and exoticism that sets it apart from all other IPAs and definitely warrants inclusion in any discussion of best of style."
"O - Very drinkable. A truly hop driven IPA."
"D: been searching for this one for a little bit now after seeing how high the reviews were. Definitely up to the hype. the hop character is unparalleled."
"Sculpin was underwhelming, big time. There was no malt backbone whatsoever and the hop flavor was entirely missing in the taste in spite of the great aroma. Scupin is not the most bitter IPA but that's not my beef -- fresh Two Hearted is a great example of a fruity IPA that's not a bitterness bomb, and yet is amazing."
"Thanks, Martin!"
"D- loved it, could drink it all day"
"The best single IPA I have tried!"
"Overall - Well now. As not a big IPA/DIPA fan I'm having to critically look at this beer in terms of its style and enjoyablity. For that, I give it high marks. An easy drinker. Easily a fine summer beer that will refresh you after a long hot summer day. Enjoyable."
"Diactyl is a bit present, but gives a nice buttery feel that is very well played. Carbonation is spot on, and the finish is very nice, clean and crisp. What you would want for a standard American IPA. Great example of the style."
"D: super drinkable, wish I had more"
"Drank the bomber myself, delicious IPA worthy of its rank. Very sweet and fruity."
"Pretty good here, glad I tried it out, easily drinkable and would have again."
"drinkability would be much higher if it didnt have that funky taste. not a drain pour or anything but I won't be buying this again."
"Ballast point wins again!"
"D- This is a thirst quenching brew. Definitely goes down easy despite being full flavored."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A pretty good IPA. The caramel notes and underpowering citrus hops make this beer very drinkable. I guess that I wouldn't say it i underpowering; but just very balanced."
"D: Goes down easily thanks to the solid taste; will definitely be having this one again out with madvermin in California."
"-Cheers"
"D - This where this beer shines. Classic example of an American IPA. I could drink this all day."
"Sculpin came in a pint glass, lightly colored and a very bright, citrus nose. It smelled refreshing and tasted that way as well. Strong hops were readily apparent from the nose, to the taste and mouthfeel. Taste was crisp with a sharp aftertaste, but very drinkable. This is a fabulous IPA, second only to Hopslam in my book. Once I try the elusive Plinii I may re-evaluate this list."
"D: Drinkability is alright, though definitely hurt by the bitterness and oily character hurt it. Overall, not a terrible beer, but not particularly good either. It is extremely overpriced though at nearly $10 for a bomber when I can get sixers of better IPAs for less."
"This is an excellent beer, a textbook IPA that covers all the bases. It balances the sweet and bitter qualities of our lupulin friend perfectly. It's easy to drink, but not TOO easy."
"On tap at a The Fishery here in SD. Poured a nice amber and decent head retention with lacing down the side as it settled. Wonderful smell of sweet apricots as I worked my way down the pint. In the end I found it to be nicely balanced with the hop bitterness, fruity sweetness and drinkability."
"Pours amber with a thin white head, lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma has a lot of citrus and almost tropical hops, very potent and absolutely amazing smell. Taste starts out with the same fruity taste as the aroma, almost entirely hops with a touch of malt. While the flavor is great, the finish is bitter and the hop flavors feel sour towards the end. Too much hop bitterness without enough malt/yeast sweetness to balance it out, while the beer is good, this is disappointing. Mouthfeel starts out smooth with medium-strong carbonation, ends more sour/bitter. Still quite drinkable, but the hop bitterness becomes overwhelming as I finish the beer."
"D: I don't know what's going on here. This has all the hallmarks of being an old bottle, but the bottling size (and its first appearance into our market) suggest it is fresh. Either they really screwed up the recipe, or some distribution snafu took place. Either way, this is a pretty big fall from grace. Ballast Point, feel free to start dating your IPAs so I can give these a fair shake."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer, but one you really feel the urge to drink slowly and savor. The ABV also keeps you from going too quickly."
"Great overall IPA. Live the aroma, sweet with apricot and grainy sweetness. Little tail, and slightly bitter for my taste. Pretty darn nice. Not a total fave, but certainly interesting flavor and incredible aroma. Yum, but enjoy carefully with that 7 percent kicker."
"This is quite drinkable, however I have begun to feel the booze a bit. Not anything crazy and could definitely down another bomber to myself but significant nonetheless. All in all a delicious concoction that I am happy to have finally tried."
"Highly drinkable. I couldn't quite give it a 5 because it's so aggressive but it's close."
"D: amazing! I can drink this over and over and over again, pure gold, I am a fan of things that push boundaries, and to me this is signature. On par with Pliny m m mmmm"
"I will definitely drink this again."
"Overall, an excellent IPA. The strong point here is the eclectic and lingering bitter hop blend. My only criticism: strong hops overwhelm the malt balance; a slightly more even blend would be preferable. But that might be a bit nit-picky!"
"What a beer! The smell is second to none..the perfect combination of hops brings out mango and peach followed by bitter pine hops with a clean crisp finish. A perfectly balanced American IPA ..A gold medal winning beer for a reason..definitely one of my favorites."
"On-tap at Beer Revolution. I've had this before in the bottle, but very nice to have this super fresh from the keg. Pours a golden amber with a thin, finely beaded head that leaves some superb sheets of lacing. The aroma exhibits some lovely notes of fresh floral, citrus, and pine aromas. I'd kinda forgotten how good this beer is. Just delightful flavors of pine, citrus peel, and some sweet, pure malt, all beautifully in balance. Delicious!"
"T: Fantastic balance between tropical, apricot sweetness and huge pine hops. This is an incredible IPA. So lucky to have this so close by."
"I can drink these all night, not too much ABV but enough for a good sessional. Down a sick-pack on the back porch, now that we can drink this fine juice all year-round. Hell ya"
"D: Very tasty and very drinkable. Alcohol is hidden perfectly, making this go down extremely easily. If only this hadn't been an extra and I had a few more ..."
"Overall a well balanced, enjoyable IPA."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Been wanting to try this for a while. Glad I finally got to. It lives up to the hype. It's definitely a top 5 Ipa in my book. Reminds me a lot of Two Hearted."
"Highly drinkable IPA that reminds me of Bell's two hearted but with slightly smoother taste profiles. Could drink Sculpin all night if it were distributed here."
"I recommend this to any IPA lover."
"Great IPA nonetheless.. very similar to PtE.. KR Just outstanding & Citra still reign in my book."
"I hope to snag a sculpin a few times a year."
"I recommend this to any IPA lover."
"Smell- a pleasant sour citrus, lemon peel flavor. Taste- lemon sour citrus, mango, pear, nice hop bitterness, and a smooth sweet malt finish. This one meets me well after a tough day at work, and I would seek out again for sure,"
"IPA's are not supposed to get much better than this: fresh Sculpin served on draft at the perfect temperature in a big Duvel tulip. The beer is extremely hazy, it's as if I can see hop oils swirling around in the chill haze. The soft orange glow of the beer is highlighted with a fluffy white cap of foam that carries the aroma with it. There's really no other way to describe the beer other than tropical--it smells like fresh cut mangos, papaya, and tangerines covered in orange blossom honey. There is a little pine aroma but the fruit dominates the nose. The taste is a lot the same, juicy fruit, sticky pine grounded by sweet lightly toasted malt that provides a nice roundness of flavor and mouthfeel. The bitterness really comes in at the end but there is enough residual sweetness and mango flavor for good balance. The carbonation is spot on with just enough prickliness to dance on you tongue without drowning out the hops. It's hard to imagine a better IPA but perhaps I would like one that's a little earthier with more herbal woody hop flavors and less papaya (a fruit that tastes like meat to me). Otherwise this is an excellent beer and a great experience on draft"
"Mouthfeel is superb, as the beer is light yet full. Texture is smooth as ice, yet creamy from time to time. Refreshing is an understatement. The chalky, chewing-on-raw-leaf finish to this beer is awesome, and really enhances the mouthfeel and drinkability. Abv of 7% is hidden completely - if you asked me blind how much alcohol was in this I would have no idea. Awesome IPA, and something that shouldn't be overlooked in the furious demand for DIPAs."
"Really awesome IPA. Great Stuff."
"Drinkability: This is one the most drinkable American IPA's that I've had. Probably in my top three of this style. Could drink this daily, if they ever put this out in higher rotation. Go out and try it!"
"D = Very drinkable. Fruit and citrus combo is clearly a crowd pleaser. Good with oysters on the half and/or steamers."
"There's no doubt this beer is a west coast IPA, but it doesn't overburden your tongue with bitterness or come off as pushy. If you like more balance, this is not for you, but if you enjoy some bright, floral hops and lots of citrus, this is a keeper."
"D-Thank goodness this comes in a bomber! although, it might as well come in 12oz so i could get 6 packs and drink them in a night. this is so good and it stays so tasty all the way through! i love this beer!"
"Sculpin and Big Eye complement each other brilliantly. Sculpin brings an incredible aroma and flavor, while Big Eye looks attractive and has a great mouthfeel. I'd love to see a double IPA based on a combination of these two recipes. I think it'd hold up to the PTEs and Hopslams of the world."
"D: A strong, hoppy beer that I could easily drink several of. The alcohol is almost undetectable under all of the complex flavor."
"this beer pours a golden yellow color that is ever so slightly hazy, with a thin white head that quickly dissapates. the smell is very citrusy, with grapefruit being the main componant. the flavor is similar to the smell with crapefruit being the main flavor foloowed by a strong bitterness. the mouthfeel is light and dry, but its funny because the grapefruit bitterness makes your mouth water so it seems a little less dry. this beer is very drinkable, i ordered it at the same time i ordered my meal and it was gone long before i saw my burger. all in all a very solid very drinkable ipa"
"2/15/14: Had this from a can and it was again very tasty, with fresh piney and citrus hops in the nose and flavor, balanced near perfectly with caramel, malts and graham cracker."
"EDIT: Tried a fresher bottle and was happy to find it was much better. Big grapefruit aroma you can pickup as soon as you pop the top, more prickly resiny hops then anticipated with the nose but good. Light taste and mouthfeel, solid brew."
"Another great IPA that you must sample."
"Ladies and Gentlemen I have found my new favorite IPA and maybe new favorite beer. If you can get your hands on this one try it, you will not be disappointed."
"D: this is the third time i have had this There are not too many ipa's that i buy more than once but this is a good drinking beer."
"D - Good drinkability. Finish doesn't exactly have me needing to go back for more, but the bitterness isn't overpowering. Very easy drinking IPA, and not too high ABV for the style. Would definitely drink again but I feel it's slightly over-rated."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer, it has the characteristics of a DIPA, but drinks like an IPA. Excellent hop characteristics throughout with nice citrus bursts (mango seems to be the dominant flavor) and the malts completing this well balanced and smooth beer."
"D - Outstanding."
"Not quite as explosive and juicy as I had hoped, but still an excellent IPA. The six pack disappeared way too fast."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. Fairly drinkable and tasty, but I can't pinpoint any one thing that sets this well ahead of other beers of the style that would make me want to buy this on a regular basis if it was available here."
"D - Very drinkable, delicious beer."
"Wow."
"Pour some more, send us more! These folk hit on an outstanding reciepe!"
"Very tasty and desireable, but strong flavors may inhibit having more than 2 (or one bomber) - a good problem to have, though."
"D - Unfortunately, this slightly disappointed. Still an amazing beer, but it took some effort to put down a couple glasses."
"D- Especially at only 7%, this is very drinkable. Every hophead should try this. I can't wait to find some more."
"Wonderful example of a West Coast IPA. Really glad I had a chance to try this one."
"M - Definitely a hop bomb, but that's the way I like it. Very close to being a one dimensional beer but there was just enough malt sweetness to compliment the bitterness."
"I once spent $25 bucks on a growler of this and was supremely disappointed. This bottle (courtesy of cduckett) is much better than I remember, but still doesn't match up to my favorite IPAs."
"M/D: Extremely smooth and very crisp. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Easy drinking, a well balanced IPA."
"I remember the days when Sculpin use to be a rare treat and always an incredible experience. For hop heads anywhere this is an incredible brew. A top 5 IPA on my list for sure. There is no wonder why it won GABF Gold 2010. I do contend however that with the scale up of production this beer has lost some of its luster. I have even seen 6-packs these days. Maybe because I have had some not so good Sculpin experiences at local establishments as well or that there are so many competetive hoppy beers in SD these days. Or maybe it is just me. None the less still a true masterpiece from the brewers at Ballast Point. Such a delicate and balanced use of mass hops. It is no wonder this brew is often sought after. Get to the point!"
"I know it's been said a ton, but Ballast Point really did a fabulous job with this beer. A wonderful hoppy monster that's still a very smooth drinker. The juicy aspect makes this easy to show to the less experienced as an example of a perfectly done IPA. Kudos to them!"
"Notes: First time hitting a Ballast Point brew. Maybe not the mind blower that some would suggest but this is a very nice IPA."
"Poured a beautiful clementine orange, brilliantly clear, with a 1.5"" white, dense head that left large chunks and bands of lace on the Gulden Draak tulip. Very good retention. The nose is a bit lacking in intensity. Quite muted, but the aromas are discernible: a fresh blend of grapefruit rind, grass, mango, and peach. Oh my this is delightful. I only wish it was more pronounced. However, there is no shortage of flavor! A nice, juicy, citrusy start with sweet honey that immediately gives way to the fruit basket of pomelo, tangerines, hint of pears, and peaches. There is a low lying bitterness throughout the experience that presents more prominently in the finish along with a touch of spruce and pine resin. There's a bit of lightly caramelized sugar too, that, along with honey, carries the malt to the finish. A very smooth and unfizzy carbonation makes for a velvety texture for this medium bodied beer. All of this forms a monolith of excellence in the quest for a great IPA. This is one of the best I've ever tasted. I will note, too, that by the time I've reached this point in the review, the beer has warmed a bit and the aromas are now MUCH more pronounced than before, which begs to raise the smell rating from a 3.5 to a 4.0. Truly an exceptional beer that I am grateful to have sampled for the second time and hopefully for many more times to come. Thank you, Ballast Point, for creating this goodness!"
"IPA isn't really my style of beer, usually they're too sour/bitter for me. This is about the smoothest one I've had. While I wouldn't drink more than one, it was awesome to get to try what is supposed to be the top beer in this style."
"Overall a very nice IPA, huge grapefruit bomb. I can't say it is the best one out there but after a certain level they are all worthy."
"If Pliny is the best DIPA, then this is my favorite IPA."
"This growler was courtesy of thagr81us (thanks Calton!), who sent it to me for my birthday despit the package I sent him being destroyed by FedEx. The growler ""popped"" when I unscrewed the lid, unleashing a multitude of in your face bitter and hoppy aromas. This was poured into a Goose Island pint glass. It poured a rich and beautiful gold in color with a two finger, whispy off white head that laced the glass. The aromas are very wet, bitter, and full of pine. It features very citrusy and sweet hops. There is so much going on here for an IPA! I love the variation. The taste of is of pine and honey. I'd say that this is somwhere in between Hopslam and 90 Minute. It's excellent and a must try. It drinks very crisp and has excellent carbonation. It doesn't leave you with cotton mouth like many IPAs and actually leaves your mouth watering for more. This beer is superb! Thanks for the birthday growler Calton!"
"Cheers..."
"I have had a few experiences with this beer where the aste was phenomenal. however, Sculpin is inconsistent, whether from the tap or the bottle. Too many decent to mediocre experiences to sustain the soaring high score I gave it initially."
"Overall, as mentioned this is a top 5 IPA for me if not #1. Love the A/S/T/M/D in total. Great package. Really enjoy the products from this brewery. Big Eye is good too, but Sculpin is much better."
"D - very, very, very drinkable. I love this beer! That's why alot of people like this."
"A well-rounded ipa, that approaches drinking like a double. Multiple flavors are present. It's not hop or malt dominant. It's also not totally pine or fruit dominant. Very good."
"I think everyone else has covered the basics here, bright orange color with fine frothy foam. Citrus overload on the nose with piney sticky hop notes. Taste is decadent, crisp, refreshingly bitter. Awesome finish with lingering resiny hops. Great pucker factor on this one, a stellar IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass and laced all the way down. The nose was big grapefruit. Lots of hops and citrus. Taste was wonderful with a big hop punch. Great finish and what I have come to expect from really well-made IPAs. Mouthfeel was good with perfect carbonation. Really easy to drink for the ABV. One of my favorite IPAs"
"D & Overall: Love this. For an IPA and not a DIPA this is the best I've had. If I could find these in 6 packs I'd buy these regularly. I found this locally for $9.99 a bomber. Thats high to me for a 7% ABV but its worth it. You can easily drink a 22oz of this and move onto something else(unless you had another bomber which I'd be tempted to open) Really was the best IPA I've had, can't imagine drinking a better one."
"Drinkabiltiy- It is hard to find a reason not to give it a five. I could drink this all the time."
"Poured from bottle courtesy of Kevin, thanks! Golden clear body with a one finger white head that fades to a cap with good lacing. Smell is malty sweetness with a balance of big tropical fruit hops, slightly jammy. Taste starts off with a huge pineapple flavor, enticingly bitter but not overpowering, crisp and very tasty beer with a good malty backbone. Medium light body with a light but active carbonation. A very solid IPA, easily the best of its style and up there in flavor and appearance with the best DIPA. Will gladly drink this any day."
"D-very drinkable. Another brew that has me california dreaming (on such a winter's day)"
"Had this at City Beer in San Francisco. I love that you can actually have beer right in the store! Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Really nice head retention with lacing on the glass. Smells of huge pine and citrus hops with some caramel malt. Really big bitterness level, reminds me more of a double IPA actually. Medium bodied carbonation. A beautiful IPA, one of the best I've had."
"My favorite has been the Sculpin, but I'll be buying competitors if the price stays as high as it is..."
"This beer pours a golden orange color with some white head on the surface. The aroma gives the impression of cracked wheat on the nose. The hop characteristics aren't too strong, perhaps this is due to it not being as fresh as it could be. There is a caramel note and some mild spices in the background that I solely attribute to the grain bill of this particular beer. Not a bad IPA for the dollar."
"D - Definitely a summer sipper. Despite the criticisms, this brew is jam-packed with loads of tasty flavors, and distinct tropical roots make it a perfect refresher."
"I finally got to try Sculpin, thanks to a trade with Ultraman 9000. Poured a slightly hazy, deep golden color with a nice head. Some nice lacing after 10 minutes as the head disapated to about 1/8 inch. The smell was as expected from the track record of this brew - a nice grapefruity aroma that I have seldom experienced. The taste was very well balanced...smooth and full of grapefruit and citrus notes. I tasted this one side by side with another highly rated IPA and the Sculpin was more balanced and did not have as much bite/ bitterness as the other. This is one great IPA. I could drink several of these . An exceptional brew!"
"Beer pours a hazy golden straw color with a nice layer of bright white head that leaves a nice layer throughout the drink and lacing all over the glass. The smell is fresh citrus, mostly grapefruit and orange with a little touch lemon zest freshness. The taste is deliciously bitter with a thin albeit adequate maltiness. The hops have a nice bit of fresh grapefruit flavor that tastes as fresh as anything I've had. Very smooth and drinkable for a 7%er, and while the beer is nicely bitter, it is definitely not too harsh to keep going back for more. Will seek out again."
"D: A crisp IPA with a strong flavor profile of grapefruit hops that leave a decisive mark on the palate."
"This is a very good beer, but I would love the tropical flavor hops contributions everyone raves about. I'd certainly try it again, but it's a bit expensive considering."
"The fact that this beer is a little lighter on the palate is a refreshing change from many of the west coast IPA's that I have had and it is nice to have something that is both bold and hoppy, but drinkable at the same time. This is a beer that you could have more than one of and not feel like you have blown out your palate or are drinking a bottle of syrup. (Racer 5 even though I love you dearly, I am looking at you)"
"Drinkability: I received this in a trade (thank you, BOLTZ7555) so I can't speak to it's pricepoint, but it is an enjoyable drink if you get your hands on some. Low ABV, good aroma, moderate bitterness. Overall nice brew."
"Concentrated citrusy hop flavors of pink grapefruit and bitter orange pith. Residual leafiness and a juicy mango aftertaste. Pale malt is relegated to the back of the bus, but provides a slight tip to the balance scale. Moderate and creamy carbonation with the obligatory hop bite to it. Slightly dry in the end with a fairly long finish."
"Great beer this was my second visit,I had initially had it on tap. However I would most likely go elsewhere for the price."
"D: Great. Went down very smoothly and was quite refreshing. This is one my new favorite IPA's."
"Sculpin, huh? One of those sought-after gems on BA here. Hey, it's good, yeah. Not unique. Just real orange on the spectrum of looks and, in a skewed way, flavor. A lot of citrus/tropical elements to the brew. First off, it sports a lovely smooth, Orange-Julius-foamy head that holds tight and lasts awhile atop the misty-dank sunny-orange corpus cervezus - very attractive on a seaside holiday frozen-cocktail tip. Brightly-pulsating waves of melon/custard/pineapple/coconut/ project feet from the glass - quite enticing, yet almost pedestrian. From here, I lose sense of the whole ""IPA"" tag and tune in to a citrus-zest-fest-injection. Not screaming beer/ale with the sip... Fruity, smooth, and thick. Refreshing, but leaving some citric-slick smear behind. Nectary to an extent. Complex collage of tropic fruit dominates, surfing a wave of bold, creamy, dextriny malt - apropos considering this mix or balance of the hops - couldn't imagine this with a snappy, dry feel... It's good - not representative(?) of the (moderate) degree of hype I've been attuned to. Happy to have met with it this one time."
"D - At 7%, Sculpin is pretty average in the alcohol department, but it drinks incredibly easy. It's a very delicate beer, with complex flavors that leave me wanting a whole growler to myself. I didn't expect it, but I can't imagine giving it anything other than a five here."
"D: very drinkable, balanced malt and hop, just hoppy enough to make it a new favorite yet uncommon enough that can almost never find it."
"220z bottle poured into a tulip. No freshness info. Pours a relatively clear and bright amber, more yellow than orange. One inch of frothy foam slowly dissipates leaving good lacing. Little carbonation. Beautiful nose! Mango, pineapple, and fresh, piny hops. A hint of rich malt sweetness can be detected under it all. Medium-light bodied but also flat. Not syrupy at all though. Goes down smooth without destroying the palate. Bight and playful hops have only light resiny character. Citrus, orange blossom, and pine on the palate with almost no trace of malty heaviness. Just the way I like it! This is probably the best non imperial IPA I have ever had. I can only imagine how good this would be if it were fresh from the brewery."
"D: Exceedingly drinkable. Would have another, and another..."
"d. pretty drinkable. 4 describes it well."
"D: Really enjoy this beer. Not a chuggable beer, but one you can sit, enjoy, and drink slowly. And before you know it, you've drank 5-6 of these. A little fruitier then most IPAs, but a must try for an IPA lover."
"12oz bottle. Poured a murky golden haze. Retained a nice head and carbonation throughout. Smell consisted of pines and ""sweaty"" hops. Tasted a big hop character, mango and lemon zest. Crisp and light bitter finish in regard to mouthability. Drank down smooth; a nice and solid IPA with an interesting character."
"D- I could drink alot of this beer thanks to afk sports for this surprise. A very pleasant one at that"
"The CPJ"
"as for drinkability, i will have no trouble finishing this bottle off, but i will likely save my second bottle for when i have company that would enjoy it."
"D: Very drinkable. I had no problem finishing the bomber in short order, and the 7% abv goes unnoticed."
"D: Very drinkable and enojoyable beer worth seeking out."
"A bit frustrating that there is no bottle date for a rather expensive IPA. The appearance is a dense orange with a nice frothy head. The smell is intoxicating. Strong citrus and floral notes. This can't be fresh because it tastes like rotten grapefruit. A little more bitter than the average IPA. Very little after taste. Drinkability is surprisingly still high considering it isn't fresh. I will have to review this again with a fresh bottle."
"Very drinkable! Leaves a little harshness In the throat but a good drinker."
"Notes: Ahhh, I finally got to try the new six-packs. Just picked a couple up last week and now they're all over San Diego. One of the best single IPA's in existence, would love to see this readily available year-round."
"I poured this IPA into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was ugly cloudy colored but did have a very nice luxurious poofy head. The Hay colored beer was very hoppy and smelled very hoppy also. Just like it should have. I think it was what an IPA should be but I will not buy it again, tooo hoppy for me."
"D - The drinkability here is awesome. This is a very solid IPA. I have a hard time setting this one down, I just want to keep on drinking it. I really think this one lived up to all the hype. It is an Awesome IPa and I would love to drink it again."
"D - A well-balanced, palatable beer. Goes along great with a big dinner."
"A very solid example of an IPA and my favourite of the lineup at an IPA tasting in October. Great pour with frothy head. Clean clear and crisp. Smells like hoppy goodness with some citrus and just a hint of malt. Tastes like a balanced hop profile between a few types of hopes... some citrus, floral hints, very good. A bit bitter on the back of my tongue but overall very drinkable"
"I want to revisit this with a full review after acquiring a fresh bottle."
"Drinkability: If I didn't know this was only 7% abv, I would have thought this was a Double IPA, both in terms of mouthfeel and taste. That is an impressive feat. The only downside to this beer (and I do not let this impact the score) is the very high price tag."
"D: This beer seems to be made to fit any occasion. It's extremely crisp and refreshing, yet excitingly complex. This is right up there with the best IPAs I've tried."
"pretty easy to drink but not something i would really seek out especially at its price point compared to what else is avaliable."
"Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint glass. The color is a hazy orange hue with a large white lacy head. The head dissipates after a few minutes. The smell is centential hops through and through. The taste is floral, bitter, rose hips and a bit citrusy. The body is a medium and good carbonation throughout. I would drink this every week and now that it is available I probably will. This is very similar to my other two favorites (Two-hearted and Stone IPA)."
"D: A really damn good IPA; alcohol (present in the aroma) is masked so well by the tropical fruitiness from the hops"
"Poured this on NYE for a group tasting of big IPA fans. Everyone was very surprised of the great aroma and flavor. The brew when poured formed a perfect slight orange/white head. The beer it's self had me take a step back on the color. The color was a perfect Orange and yellow mixture but was absolutely clear. The aroma was great, with fruit mixture rising with a snappy background. The flavor was very hoppy and was bursting my senses. Tons of bitter hops accompanied by citrus and other fruit flavors. Was a most welcome brew that everyone enjoyed."
"Juicy mouthfeel with just the right carbonation, and well hidden alchohol makes this brew highly drinkable, especially for the alchohol content."
"Drinkability is really high with this beer. With the amount of flavor and 7%ABV it walks the line between the higher IPAs and lower DIPAs, but 12 ounces were gone before I knew it."
"Drinkability is very good. I could keep drinking this until I ran into problems"
"Verdict: You can find better-priced IPAs that are as good or better, but this is worth trying especially if you don't like over-hopped Lefty IPAs."
"Very tasty beer however not worth the $10 for a 22OZ. Better off buying their Big Eye IPA ( $13-$14 a 6-pack) which is a staple in my fridge. I waited forever for my local Package Store to finally stock this. Needless to say, I was let down just a bit. After reading reviews and seeing how highly this beer is rated, I am a bit surprised as I do not feel it is any more special then their regular lineup of quality beers. Very good beer just not worth the $ in my eyes. I'll buy it again, just not something I'd pick up every time I go to the store."
"Sculpin drinks far too easy. It is unfortunate this beer does not make it into my area or I would pick it up on some sort of regular basis. Well crafted beer with great balance, outstanding example of the style."
"Comments: I have heard great things about this IPA. It was very good, but not on par with heavyweights such as the Heady Topper."
"Taste has a good hop presence that has right the right amount of pine and citrus, it isn't overwhelming and the bitterness doesn't push me away either since it comes and goes quickly, crisp carbonation really helps this beer and makes me want to drink more and more, the sweet malt backbone is stronger than I would have expected though."
"Those citrus flavors come more evident in the flavor as it warms. This is a very clean beer that is all hop forward. Not much sweetness throughout and finishes dry and bitter. I really enjoy this light and crisp IPA...it has much of the aroma and flavor of a DIPA without the oily body. This is an IPA you could enjoy a lot of!"
"This is one beer I'm going to seek out and buy as much as I can. It's as good as the hype."
"I'd give this a 5 if i could, but this being a So Cal beer makes it difficult to find unless traded for. Probably the best American IPA I've had to date and will be pretty hard to top. Such a sessionable beer and feels more like a 4 or 5% ABV beer."
"D: Quite a hop bomb. Incredibly long finish with bitter hop flavor."
"its okay had better however better then most"
"Overall, a very solid beer. One thing I am beginning to believe in my beer tasting journey is that many beers in the top 100 do not live up the hype and this is one of them. I've had several IPAs that I would rank better than this but aren't in the top 100. Still, its good and worth a try but don't let the hype build up your expectations."
"It is hard to decide but I think I like the aftertaste better than the initial. The hops are so pungent but perfectly balanced."
"On tap at my local pub. The beer presents itself in a pale orange golden hue. A finger of dense white foam dissipates quickly. Excellent lacing. The smell is pure citrus. Orange peel dominates followed by a slight hint of biscuity malt. Taste follows the nose. An explosion of orange, tangerine, and mango hits my pallet at first quaff. This is the juiciest IPA I've ever had! The hop bill sports seven different varieties yet the beer is perfectly balanced with a easing bitterness and subtle malt backbone. Finish is juicy, bitter and sweet all at the same time. Feel is medium bodied and carbonation is spot on. Drinkability is dangerously high due to the delicious taste and completely hidden ABV. This is quite honestly my favorite single IPA of all time. I have had it many times on tap, bottled and on cask and it never fails to please. Seek this out and enjoy!"
"NB. I do believe I personally prefer this to Pliny, that may be however due to how fresh this is."
"Easy to drink this beer. Smooth and not heavy at all."
"Very drinkable if you like the flavor. It's not extremely approachable, especially for the non craft drinker."
"OVERALL: A great IPA for sure, and well worth the praise it gets. Lots of good flavors and quite bold for the style. Almost like a DIPA in that regard. The palate could be a little fuller and oilier perhaps, but that is a minor critique of what was otherwise a very enjoyable and drinkable, hoppy brew. Worth checking out if you're a fan of the style. Thanks again for the trades gents."
"Into a stemmed Stone IPA glass, it poured a cloudy gold with 2 fingers of white head, little visible carbonation, and great head retention and lacing. Smelled of grapefruit peel, lime, apple, and menthol. The taste was very nicely balanced; apple, grapefruit, menthol, and a slight grassy character dissolving to a bitter peel finish with slight dryness, and a good lingering but not overpowering bitter aftertaste. Very modestly carbonated and smooth, with the head retention aiding a slightly creamy feel. If I had to pick something to improve upon, it would be the finish, which didn't seem dry enough to match the flavor nuances, but that notwithstanding, this is an excellent beer."
"[EDIT]: I had to edit this beer on 1-11-2011 and dock it a few points for Taste and Drinkability, as since this review I have found this beer to be probably the most hit-and-miss IPA I've ever come across. With no freshness date on the bottle, I can't conclude that it's merely a freshness issue. In fact, I've had experiences at bars with fresh kegs that I still haven't been impressed with. So I am choosing to drop drinkability from a 5 to a 4. Sometimes this beer is so great it's nearly a religious experience, but equally often this beer disappoints me, and shows itself to be anything but exceptional. When ""good", this is an extremely unique IPA, but there are other IPAs out there that are able to deliver with a far higher batting average than this one has."
"D- Really, you can't beat this beer. Just so good, so hoppy, but light enough you know you can pound them all night. My favorite single IPA hands down. Westcoast, I love you."
"O - To hoppy to drink regularly, but a treat while you've got it."
"This is truly a great IPA. Breweries around the country are all trying to create a tastely, high quality IPA but all are coming up short of Sculpin. The color is a wonderfully solid and has a great luster. Aroma is all big, sticky, icky, piney, citrusy and rainy hops. Taste is an exceptionally good combination of hops and malt (but mostly hops thank goodness). Taste is more on the bitter/piney side than the malty side. Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean. I could get used to this."
"What a great well balanced IPA. I'm not willing to crown Sculpin as the best American IPA available, but it should be involved in the conversation. It's a well rounded and incredibly flavorful IPA. I wish I could find it in the Philadelphia area more often"
"Great Double/Imperial with a bountiful of hops and nice citrus notes that leave a deceivingly low alcohol presence on the finish. Sporadically hard to find with unreliable distribution. It seems to ebb and flow through inventory at local stores in the Phoenix market. One of my favorite limited/rotating release finds from Ballast Point in 2010!"
"D: Doesn't dissapoint. I think I'll have another."
"D: This is a great beer...very drinkable. Reminds me a lot of Hair of the dog blue dot. Would buy this one again for sure."
"I think Sculpin is very good but not great. I wish for more fruity flavor, because although I love the bitter grapefruit peel flavor I like it even better with some juicy sweetness to go with it. The nose had more, the taste not much at all. A very bitter, hop forward IPA, which is certainly plenty pleasing to this palate."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. The night before I sampled this just lightly chilled. It was quite good. However, tonight's sample had been thoroughly chilled in the refrigerator overnight. Slight chill haze and yummy head with excellent retention. Grapefruit and piney nose was enticing. I even got more grapefruit and yummy citrus hoppiness when it was chilled further! Excellent brew. I recommend it cold. Exceedingly refreshing also despite the abv! I want another!"
"This beer pours a clear yellow with darker yellow tints in the middle. Good head. This is a very citric beer with lots of fruits in the nose and taste. I picked up mango, orange, tangerine and some grapefruit. The bitterness of the hops is definitely noticeable and very well balanced. I thought the beer was a little over-carbonated as it was very fizzy in the mouth and made the beer taste a little thin. Overall, solid beer but I think still lags a bit behind some other single American IPAs."
"Truely a great beer, Don't try the Big Eye IPA it is a let down. This one is one of my favorites. A masterpiece Well done! Just how I would imagine sex with Jenna Jameson would be, if it were a drink."
"Simply a spectacular and in my opinion THE best single ipa on the planet. Doesn't matter if it's tap, 12oz, 22oz or firkin it doesn't get much better than this one."
"Finally got around to trying this gem. Shared a few with my brother. Bomber poured into Duvel tulip. Two fingers of pillowy head sit on top of a beautiful orange, golden body. Smell is floral and citrus leaning on the citrus. As I let this fish swim on my tongue, the pineapples, peaches and citrus goodness fills my mouth and goes down clean leaving nice sticky lacing on my glass. Dangerously drinkable and just solid all around."
"Probably a Top 10 IPA for me."
"draft at Galaxy Hut"
"Taste was great. Initially there was bitterness - like a bite from a pink grapefruit, but it didn't take long for that to fade into sweeter fruitiness with a resinous pine finish. The beer was medium bodied, well carbonated and magically delicious."
"After my first sip, I am slightly disappointed, but not because it isn't delicious, the nose just leaves so much to be desired that I can't imagine that anything could live up to it. This is my 2nd favorite (i)IPA to date, and I give it props for competing so well with PtE. The taste is phenomenal and if you're in the mood for a tasty yet not-overpowering citrus bomb I can't believe anything could be better."
"Mouthfeel is full, and moderately carbonated. A really great IPA."
"d - i could easily drink sculpin all night long. my favorite aipa next to nelson and blind pig."
"I've been holding off on reviewing a bottle of this until I had what I considered to be a sufficiently fresh bottle in hand. The 22s I've picked up in PA have always been good, but lacked the ""magic"" of a fresh keg. I just picked up a 6 pack of the new black label bottles so I figured this was as fresh as I'll find a bottle at retail around here. These bottles didn't disappoint with the freshest, hoppiest tasting iteration I've ever had of this not on tap. Aroma is ripe with pine and tropical fruits, while the flavor follows through with a thick, soft body and balanced sweet and bitter pineapple and grapefruit hop attack. Fresh, this is my favorite AIPA, and this sample didn't disappoint."
"Drinkability - I'm not going wild over it... it's going down, but not as smooth as I'd like. Maybe it's a summer beer... it's 34 degrees in Philadelphia tonight... maybe I should have a porter."
"Drink- For a very hop forward IPA this is a remarkably drinkable beer. Best of all it doesn't leave a film your mouth the way some IPAs tend to."
"D - one of the better IPAs I have tried (I can't believe this isn't a DIPA). In your face hops from the nose to the finish let you know that this beer isn't messing around. Great IPA - up there with the best of them."
"I don't know how fresh this beer was, but I'd really like to try both this and Pliny side by side superfresh and see which I prefer better. Hopefully in January when BP dates their bottles. But as of now, I enjoyed Pliny a bit better than this."
"drinkability: a good beer to put up against pliny but just not as solid overall. anyways great hop head ipa."
"Outstanding IPA. This one ranks in the upper echelon with PtE, Hop Stoopid, Racer 5, etc, etc. Friend stopped by unexpectedly with a bomber bottle and I was more than happy to help split it. Pours a bright pale/light orange color with nice head and foever lacing. Smells wonderful---fresh hops, pine, fruit, etc. Taste follows suit with a creamy bitterness and dry finish. Very different than BP's Big Eye IPA which is much more malt dominated. The malt in Sculpin seems very minimal or light. Easily one of the best IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking. Too bad bomber bottles are so pricey --- $8-10 locally."
"Too bad this is so expensive relative to similar tasting beers ($9.99 per 22 oz. bomber vs. $9.99 for a 72 oz. six pack of Lagunitas Lil' Sumpin' Sumpn"")."
"Pours a light amber with lots of fine sediment, two finger foamy white head that fades to a thin cap leaving a few splotches of lace. Smell: a blast of bright pineapple, grapefruit rind, nectarine, light biscuit. Taste: pineapple, soft tropical fruit notes, peach + lemon tea, biscuity base. Light-medium bodied with prickly carbonation. According to their website this is year round now, and FL is a new market so I presume this is fairly fresh. A very good IPA, I see why it is highly regarded... there are a few other beers with *very* similar profiles that are rated far below this one though, so the (prior) limited availability has likely influenced the rating."
"D: One of the best in the style."
"Picked up a growler of this from my local shop. Was really impressed with it. Great appearance! Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head that left a decent lace. Mouthfeel of citrus and pine. Excellent hop presence which is what I like. I would like the mouthfeel to be a little more heavy. Overall, believe all the hype behind this beer. Though it is over priced, its well worth it. Too bad its not readily available round here."
"I cannot say it is great, because it tastes like a 6 month old ipa. Smells great, but the hop taste has faded."
"Drinkability: This is a great IPA, in pretty much every category. Hopefully these bottles will be regularly available in Chicago soon."
"very nice... a lot of hype about this one, and it pretty much lives up to it. just a simple, delicious san diego ipa. pours a fairly clear, glowing burnt-gold with a big white head that never goes away and leaves tons of lace as the beer goes. nose is fruit galore mixed with a nice, pale malt backbone that lends mild sweetness and blends and harmonizes just about perfectly. the malt character amplifies the hop profile instead of simply adding tons of sweetness to mellow the harsh flavor of tons of hops like other less-finessed ipas from ballast point's neck of the woods. mango, peach, nectarine, melon, citrus, pine and resin (read: pot) all with a really bright, pure, fresh-fruit-juice-on-the-beach-in-SoCal quality. speaks of the place where it comes from. unmistakeable. that awesome ocean-air-tropical-paradise thing that you get from the best SoCal ipas. taste is well-balanced, and like the nose suggested, the fruity hops (and yeast?) incorporate extremely well with the pale malt, which produces some sweetness and a touch of toastiness. some pineyness comes through in the end as well, and it kind of zips it up rather than bitters it up. medium body that seems to effortlessly carry the weight of all the hoppy goodness. another example of how well-chosen the grain bill is here. long, hoppy finish that is very mild on the bitter and virtually free of any alcohol taste or aftertaste. i've kind of grown out of my ipa phase, but this one was really well made, tasted like san diego in a bottle and definitely left me wanting more. a real treat. sets the bar as far as i'm concerned."
"D: This is a very good IPA, but I feel like it fell just short of the hype. I'd put Union Jack above it. Still, worth seeking out if you like hops."
"D-- Excellent. great beer. Well hidden ABV and for an IPA can have several of these. Bomber size is easy to put down. 12 oz bottles mean 4 is easy to do. Best IPA I have had due to the drinkability."
"This beer is talked up a decent amount and I must say it does not disappoint. A little on the pricy side about $8-$9 but it is a great IPA."
"from a 12 0z bottle it poured a slightly hazed golden yellow color with a fresh white 1 finger head that stayed with good lacing on side of glass really fresh looking..smell was pine forest with citrus and tropical fruits just bursting with hops. ..taste was crisp pine with loads of tropical hops..mango,pineapple tastes fill the pallet and just resonate full hop flavor ...then grapefruit and and floral hops..malts were there also..mouth feel crisp and fresh well carbonated and full of tropical hops..drink ability is outstanding this bottle was extremely fresh so full of hop flavor really one of the top 5 ipas ive had"
"Overall: Excellent IPA overall. This is a must try for any hop head. I'll definitely be buying more once we get a distributor down here in Fort Myers."
"A nice slightly hazy golden color with big pillowy white head. Some lacing, good retention. Smell is big grapefruit, big pine, big hops, basically. I would say it's citrusy with some piney undertones. The flavor follows suit with some big grapefruit flavor, followed by a piney finish. A bit sticky, but not dry on the finish. Clean bready malt underneath. MF is medium, very smooth, good drinkability. Overall, a really well put-together beer, though it kind of reminds me of very fresh Two-Hearted."
"Girlfriends input: i don't like it. hops tastes like Christmas barf/potpourri but it smells a lot better than it tastes"
"Excellent example of the west coast style IPA. I highly recommend this. Buy it when you find it. In fact buy them all because they are hard to find."
"I'm glad I got a hold of this one, and hopefully some day I'll get a chance to sample from the tap. I'll bet it's superb."
"I bet it's great on tap."
"Drinkability - I wish there was more, very good IPA. Can definitely finish off a bomber of this by myself."
"I was very surprised by this wondererful beer, which is excellent, and one beer is enough. I drank this brew after a pint of pliney the elder and it stood up on its own."
"I even looked up Sculpin on Wikipedia. Because this beer teaches us things."
"poured into a snifter. nice orange hi-c color with very white fluffy head. very citrus-like smell, grapefruit, orange, hint of lemon. the taste as smooth as hell. Very nice citrus flavor and nice malt balance. Also some nice hints of tropical fruit, maybe some peach. the bitterness is mild and subdued, which was an extremely pleasant surprise. it's there just enough to remind you you are drinking an ipa, but it's not strong at all. the mouthfeel is nice and lively. extraordinarily smooth for an ipa. I'm normally not one for hype and tend to be disappointed, but this was fantastic."
"The body is light to medium and the alcohol is not really present in the taste, but apparent as I finish the bomber. A nice amount of carbonation adds to the drinkability. My only qualm is the slight oiliness I seem to get off of this. A minute hiccup in its overall score however. This stuff is just insanely drinkable. This is easily the best single IPA I have had to date."
"I wish my local store would have this in stock. But ill manage with the Ballast Point IPA. which is just one notch under."
"After seeing the glowing reviews, I can honestly say this didn't disappoint. It is one of the finer IPA's in the world."
"D: The beer is highly drinkable; there's a strong amount of hop flavors but the bitterness is balanced by the malts and doesn't slow you down in finishing your glass."
"Really, the only flaw that Sculpin has is it's price. It's great, but is it twice as great as, say, a Sierra Nevada Celebration? I'm sure the six-packs will make this easier to swallow, but dropping more on this bomber than a six-pack of Celebration is a little tough to swallow. A great beer though, can't fault it anywhere else."
"Thanks Josh!"
"D - Near perfection. I could drink this every day for the rest of my life and be very happy. I have now had four different versions of cask Sculpin and this was my favorite, narrowly beating out the simcoe version."
"D: Pretty damn good west coat IPA. Only problem here is that it doesn't stand up to some of it's California competition. Still, great brew here."
"The mouthfeel is full, yet light, with fine carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, and if not for the expense, I would have this on hand all the time. It's expensive for a single IPA, but you'd have to be miserly to think about that once the bottle has been opened and the first drop hits you lips."
"This is a fantastic one-off of one of my favorite IPA's. It is medium to almost light bodied with an acceptably low level of carbonation. Very easy drinking with the alcohol almost completely suppressed. About the only gripe I have with this brew is that it is at times a little watery but that doesn't stop me from emptying this glass at an alarming rate. Very well done."
"I had another chance to try this beer over this past weekend (06/18/11) in a bomber that was most certainly fresh. My description of this beer in this review is good, but my ratings are overly high. Smell was changed to 3.5 from 4.5. Taste was changed from 3.5 to 2.5. Drinkability was changed from 3.5 to Overall 3.0. One glass was more than enough and my group was fighting over who would draw the short straw to finish the bottle. This was a disappointing brew and I probably won't get it again."
"D - Just great! This is a beer I will look foward to having again for time to come. I could sit back on this for a long time. Thanks to Duff for getting it to me!!!"
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. A wonderful beer."
"D: Where's the sting? I think this is an easy drinker!"
"This is one of those few beers that's been able to live up expectations lately. This one didn't let me down and has me looking forward to the full growler."
"D: There's more at the liquor store. I may go back and get more."
"D: good but too hoppy for my pallet to drink a lot"
"Drinkability - Surprisingly easy to drink and a great IPA. I'm relatively new to finding IPAs enjoyable and I have Sculpin and Pliny the Younger to thank for it."
"Comments - I've handed out a lot of 4.5s in my day and more than my share of 5.0s, but as far as Drinkability goes this is the most drinkable hop bomb I've ever had. For the first time in almost 2,000 reviews I wish I could assign a 6.0 rating to something. You really have to drink this beer to believe it."
"an all around balance of an IPA but not something that is characterized as uniquely great or number one. it may be a regional thing but i've had some better IPA's in the midwest. this is a good one to set examples too... but doesn't have any accent."
"Winner of round 1 blinded IPA tasting (over Red Racer and Stone)"
"Good stuff. Awesome IPA."
"Ballast Point Sculpin, 22oz bomber picked up at Liquor Outlet Wine Cellar. Pours beautiful hazy orange color with large white head in shaker. Head sticks to glass nicely. Great aroma of grapefruit and hops. Super citrus flavor, clean malt base. Light, smooth and silky. Very drinkable, this is a superb brew. I was worried that the bottle may not be fresh but that was put to rest the moment I open the bottle and poured it. It smelled excellent before I could even get my nose near the glass."
"Drink- It's very good. It goes down well and has a nice aftertaste. Like I said its a big bomber and I dont know if I could take down 2 in a sitting. It was a great beer."
"This is a beer that lives up to its hype. Like Cigar City Jai Alai IPA, Sculpin is in that gray area between IPA and double IPA Hopheads, seek it out."
"great beer all around. i will seek this out when i have a chance on draft."
"D: These go down like nothing and if you're not careful the 7% ABV will catch up with you over an evening of drinking these tasty little guys."
"D/O- I'm overwhelmed at how good this IPA is. Don't know if this comes in 12 ounce bottles but when I asked if there were any in the back I was told ""well, let's see if we have any big bottles of it."" Luckily, they did have a few bombers on the shelf. I just want to thank all the BA's (especially Bob from the GLBF...don't know his BA name) that recommended this beer on a seemingly daily basis. Definitely worth making a special stop to check if a place 3 hours from home has it. I'm in IPA euphoria right now. Life is good."
"D. A wonderfully crafted IPA, and the best one that I have tasted to date. This was a very pricey 22 oz. But if you are into the grapefruit tast of an IPA this hands is the winner."
"With this praise in mind, it seemed like this year's batch was just a little more subdued than last year's. Still an excellent IPA though, probably my favorite."
"great beer. cant wait to have it again."
"Drinks easy, hops up front are balanced nicely with malt, fruit, citrus and carbonation. Just enough going on to keep it interesting. nice mild alcohol warmth in the end."
"Now this is what I like in an IPA. I like them to be something more than just a flat bitter hop bomb. The beer pours a nice copper color with a nice head. Smells very nice and the taste just shines. There is a solid, slightly sweet malt base behind the hops. The hops linger with that slightly sweet flavor. I could drink a ton of these. One of the best IPAs I've had - right up there with Pure Hoppiness, Furious, ans Town Hall Masalla. Now if I could just get it here without breaking the bank."
"D: Amazing."
"Wow this is an amazing IPA. Pours a slightly hazy golden copper color with a big white head. Aroma is full of citrus fruits and pine. The taste is loaded with citrus, tropical fruits and hops flavors. Nicely balanced with the malts; this has good bitterness to it, but it is not too over the top. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect for the style. Medium-light body, moderate carbonation and quite smooth. Great drinkability, the bottle did not last long!"
"A wonderfully crafted IPA, even at 8 bucks a bomber I still jump at the chance to pick this one up. I hope the move to six packs leaves the quality of this product intact."
"The flavor is simple, with a dry, bitter tone dominating the brew. Malt profile adds nothing behind all these hops. Bitterness is very strong, with a somewhat harsh profile. Hops bring some grapefruit peel, grass, and leaves. Not as much fruitiness is represented as the nose does. I think the fruity hop profile could have given this more depth, but it's hard to please the palate after the aroma is so great."
"M + D: This went beyond my expectations, and I'm very pleased to have local access to such a stellar IPA. Medium bodied, with a carbonation that's pretty much spot-on... sparkling, and giving way to just a little chewiness at the very end. The higher-than-average alcohol content is masked remarkably well and can go down perhaps a little too easily. A nice brew, and I look forward to having more regular access to it on the East Coast. Recommended."
"I can't add much to what has been posted 800 times here already. This is my favorite IPA because of an outstanding taste and an amazing mouthfeel. Love sitting back and drinkin this beer. Go find it if you havent had it."
"D: There is no shortage of great IPAs in the world, and this is among the best. In my area, it seems that Bell's ""Two-Hearted"" is the go-to IPA that has legions of loyal followers. I've heard rumors that Sculpin is now going to be produced in 6-pks. When and if that happens, ""Two-Hearted"" may get kicked to the curb."
"Drinkabilty - Very high. This beer combines everything you want in a ipa, and adds that pineapple twist to make it unique and enjoyable. Limited release will make you enjoy it even more"
"D-Now that this is becoming more available (6-packs soon) I will be drinking a lot of this."
"Great mouthfeel - smooth but with a nice carbonation to it. Great beer, easy to drink even at 7%."
"D-Simply one of the best you can get of this style."
"If you wanted to show somebody an example of a ""typical"" IPA, bumped up to its apex, Sculpin is where it's at. There's no unexpected flavors here, but everything about this beer is done at such a high level."
"D- Solid beer, could easily drink a few of these. Not a super hop bomb but full of flavor"
"D - I could drink this all day long. Sure its 7% ABV, but i couldn't tell. I find the balance to be what makes this a hugely drinkable IPA. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer every time i drink it and wish it was less expensive."
"Really. What more can I add? This is the top American IPA here for a reason. This is an amazingly well crafted IPA, if not my own personal favourite."
"Notes: Excellent beer. Bitter, but brimming with vibrant, juicy fruit flavors. Perfect West Coast IPA, and easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Great from the bottle if you can find it fresh, but a damn near religious experience on tap. Mandarin orange and grapefruit tastes are really augmented."
"A much talked about ipa that backed up all the talk. Bring on fresh six packs."
"Taste is very nice, it's got a surprising amount of bitterness with a good light maltiness, it finishes very light and dry which makes this deadly drinkable. Very fruity and some earthy notes as well. Mouthfeel is full and rich, really creamy. This will be awesome once it's in 6 packs, it's so drinkable one bomber isn't enough!"
"Served: September 27, 2010"
"Drinks: like positive reinforcement. My previous experiences now justified, I can safely say it: I don't get the popularity of this beer. It's decent, but not worth the price and definitely not worth wasting any more time seeking out."
"Pours with a thick foamy head leaving lacey rings all over the glass. A beautiful rusty orange color with slight carbonation. Smells of a variety of citrus but the grapefruit really breaks through more than anything else. At first the taste matches the strong hints of grapefruit in the smell, followed by a punch of hops that complements the sweet citrusy flavor perfectly. Very slight alcohol finish but so so smooth I could sip on this all night long. Excellent!"
"Mouthfeel is medium and oily with moderate carbonation that matches this beer perfectly. This is now the 3rd time I've had this beer, twice in the bottle and once on tap, and this must be the freshest I've had it. I'd drink this beer fresh anytime, anywhere. It's really just magical, but get it while it's hot...or should I say cold."
"drinkable enough i'd guess."
"The beer is straw colored and translucent, with a clear area near the bottom of my glass. The head is soapy white foam that leaves a lot of film and foam as it recedes. It has a great warm hop aroma, full of citrus and spruce. The taste has some sweet malts and lots of hops. I can pick out a distinct grapefruit citrus flavor. The bitterness is tingly and impressive. It has a medium body and not too much coating. I find this to be impressive for a DIPA. Equally impressive is the drinkability. I could easily finish this entire 22oz bottle myself."
"D- I would drink a few of these any day. And today I will. Yea!"
"D: Very high drink on this one. This bomber will be gone in no time! I'll be trading for this again in the future."
"Drinkability: This brew highlights the hops very well. Great hop flavor/aroma that is refreshing and enjoyable."
"Overall: This deliciously hoppy nectar gets my vote for the best IPA ever."
"d - excellent beer and a top-notch ipa."
"At 6%, I love the distinct DFH 60 Minute; and above 7%, it's all about PtE, Burton Baton, Exponential Hoppiness and PtY for me."
"Light bodied beer with a small amount of carbonation sufficient to tingle your tongue. Sculpin is the most drinkable IPA I've ever had, delicious flavor profile without the overpowering bitter aftertaste common to this style"
"Another great west coast beer!"
"A very solid beer."
"Overall, there is a reason this is in a bomber -- because you want more. Very drinkable, with just the right bitter/acid/sweet balance. Glad I grabbed this one."
"D - I wouldn't want to drink more than one bomber at a time simply because after the first, I couldn't appreciate the intensities of the hop flavor. Its a great, intense, IPA with a moderate alcohol content with good drinkability. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and I wish it was available closer to me."
"I used a wide wine for this one. Sculpin poured a light golden color with a big head on the initial pour, 2 fingers in size. The aroma pops with citrus first, then comes faint spice as well as the smell of fresh flowers. Alright, time to take a sip...the taste contains grapefruit, hops of course. The hop content seems to be just the right amount for an IPA in my opinion. And it finishes dry, but not overly so. Carbonation level is good as well. This beer receives praise regularly and I would say it is warranted. It is a nice deviation from some of the east coast IPAs that I drink on a more regular basis."
"D: Drinkability is excellent. The way this brew is crafted to be flavorful, and big without being a gigantic pallet and liver buster makes this brew what it is."
"Drinkability- I could knock back quite a few of these at only seven percent. Very delicious and drinkable."
"D- if your palette could handle all this taste you could go all night"
"Overall- Probably my favorite IPA"
"D - Really nicely hopped, refreshing, crisp, and leaves me wanting another 22 oz bomber. Perfect ABV level, no dominating alcohol flavors and the perfect IPA to enjoy any time. Bought a case and although it's an awesom IPA, it's not worth the $100 price tag for a case of 12 bombers. The market is saturated with alot of good IPA's and there's many others I enjoy just as much that are far less money."
"This is an IPA which delivers a variety of hop flavors without becoming some sort of muddled mess. Sculpin remains super drinkable and delicious throughout, making it absolutely worth seeking out."
"Flavor is head and shoulders above any ipa I've had. Huge tropical flavors blend with lemon, orange, grapefruit, and pine and override a only slightly noticeable caramel malt backbone that keeps the hops just balanced enough. Incredible."
"D: This is not something that could be drank in mass quantities but that's because it's intensely flavored...not because it isn't good."
"The appearance is a clear golden-orangery color with a nice head and lots of lacing on the glass. The nose is full of tropical fruits, mangoes, citrus fruits and pineapple. The taste is very similar lots of tropical fruit notes with a delicate bitterness that blends into the tropical notes. The malt profile is not to sweet or overpowering, the hops are really showcasing this beer. The carbonation levels are spot on. The finish is dry. I could drink this beer all day long just about everyday, it really is one the better IPA's on the shelf."
"Always nice to see a beer live up to its hype and an excellent example of an AIPA with great floral characteristics."
"Clear golden color with a massive white head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is full of tropical fruit. The label claims apricot, peach, mango, and lemon. I definately pick out the mango but the other hop aromas meld together in a fruity punch. The flavor is 95% hops. More tropical fruit flavor with just a hint of dryness in the finish. Bitterness is moderate which surprised me a little thinking this was going to be a palate shredder after taking a whiff. The body is a little light but is pleasantly carbonated. I would place this beer in my personal top 10 of American IPAs. Just not enough malt to suit my Midwestern tastes."
"D - if available, I'd drink this just about every time I wanted an IPA. It's that good. Easy to see why it's ranked so high."
"D: Good drinkability. If this had a little more malt balance and more tropical fruits it would be phenomenal."
"Have had this many times in bottles, on tap and cask. This review is from my first time having it. In a bottle when it was still a VERY limited release (2008). Pours with a large, rocky, yellow tinged head covering a hazy yellow body. Aroma of apricot, pine, mango and some caramel. Taste is pine bitterness with some exotic fruit. Syrupy with lively bubbles. This stuff is awesome!"
"This beer is absolutely amazing in the nose. There are probably only a handful of beers that match the deliciousness that this packs in a single whiff. Unfortunately, the taste is no where near the level it could be. I'd love to drink this again, but I'd more like to enjoy sharing this experience with another than anything else. Something to wave under their nose and just go WOW... maybe leave it at that, but its still good to taste, so I guess not."
"Poured a hazy orange with a thick 3 finger head. Nice lacing. Aroma is incredible, citrus and floral hops. Light to medium body. Light to medium carbonation. Good mix of grapefruit, mango and pine. Very drinkable. This just might be my favorite IPA yet."
"Overall this is a beer that I enjoyed revisiting and I'm glad to report that a fresh bottle stands up to the tap version. Both are very well worth a shot."
"This makes its debut in the top 3 of my all time favorite IPAs."
"Drinkability is superb. Out of a bottle of undetermined age, this was great. Fresh, from a growler, Sculpin is one of the finest I've tried from the IPA family. Thanks Jeff!"
"Drinkability: a bright and pretty intense IPA. Normally I call citrusy IPAs refreshing, but I won't go so far with the Sculpin. It doesn't set out to be refreshing; just a bastard of a hop bomb, and at this it succeeds."
"D. With such high expectations it is almost impossible for a beer to live up and this beer just doesn't quite live up but it is good."
"Cheers.."
"There are minute differences, but I would say that I prefer the growler version due to the freshness of the hops and the aroma. Its really close to call, and either way, its amazing and my personal favorite"
"D: This beer goes down easy. I can not express in words how fast this beer went down! Very refreshing and tasty."
"22oz bomber. Pours a light orange color with a thin head and lacing throughout. Great aroma. Citrus hops, grapefruit and maybe lemon smells. Taste is more citrus with a bitter aftertaste. Hoppy as well. Pretty smooth. It is certainly a bit dangerous how drinkable this beer is. This is one of the few IPAs that can hold their own against Imperial IPAs. Damn good."
"Notes: Great, really excellent beer, the bitterness just lingers a tad too long for me to want to put down large quantities of this."
"Overall impression: Sunavabitch, this beer is good. If it's not the best (D)IPA out there, then it's sure as hell in the discussion."
"Utterly drinkable. Limited Release makes it hard to drink a ton of this, but this is an exceptional beer and should be sought out and bought should you find it in a store!"
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, but rather light. Makes for quite a refreshing IPA. Overall, a top notch IPA that easily fits into my top 5 IPA's. Quite a lucky find for me to grab this while out of state last weekend."
"Outstanding beer."
"Notes: Really well balanced even though it's very hoppy and ""dank."" Not a lot of malt sweetness nor body. Awesome."
"I'm generally a tough grade on IPA's, and this doesn't stand out as one of the best I've ever had though it is darned good. The hoppy flavor is well done. Sculpin deserves the rating it gets, though I don't know if it justifies the high price tag."
"Poured into snifter. Amazing aroma of citrusy piney juiciness. One of those ipa's that you really don't even need to drink... Just smell. Borderline double ipa,has as much flavor as one. Biting bitterness with great citrus taste. I could go on and on. Just spectacular, bottom line."
"In short, fantastic IPA. I'll put it right up there with Blind Pig. I prefer the BP, simply because it's drier - but Sculpin is no slouch. Excellent IPA."
"D-a very drinkable IPA that is bitter, yet refreshing and non-mouth numbing; really worth this high of a rating? mhm i dont know. a little pricey but definitely nice to try."
"D: Very flavorful and overall a nicely done beer. Definitely not a session beer but great to split the bottle with friends."
"I finally was able to have this beer on draft and it was worth the wait. I also tasted this beer from a bomber but I got a much better feel for it after a full glass. It pours a nice orange-golden color with about a one inch white head. It laces very nicely on the way down. The floral and citrus aroma is ony point with its flavor and really prepares you for its smooth but not over pouring taste. This IPA is very drinkable and I hope to have another glass before it runs out. I would definitely recommend trying this beer on tap."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with a white head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops, big citrus. In the taste, dry grapefruity citrus hops and a nice malty backing. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry grapefruity rind-ish aftertaste. Super big hops, nice everyday drinker at 7%."
"Overall - Wow, fresh on tap I'm not sure if I've had a better IPA. This drinks amazingly well and overflows with flavor; so much so that I expected the alcohol content to be a little higher merely due to the intensity and depth of flavor present."
"D- Incredibly quaffable. I wish so badly for this beer to come to Maryland!!!!"
"At 7% abv this is an easy drinker. In no way do i think this is the best IPA on the market. considering the disgusting hype and price this was a little bit of a let down. Ive have far better examples of this style from many different brewerys IMO. Maybe it wasn't super fresh, regardless it is what it is, a solid balanced IPA."
"D - Fresh, delicious and poundable! Freakin' awesome cask beer, actually. I prefer this over the Palisade cask version, though both are fantastic."
"D: I understand why this is rated so high in the IPA category. I find it very drinkable for an IPA."
"Great drinking. The big bottle didn't last long."
"Tastes like wonderful jesus sunshine. Like, motherfuck. Fuck your mother. This is the fruitiest, juciest IPA I have ever come across. Lord Admiral Nelson almost came close to tasting this goodly fruity but, I dunno, its wasn't about the fruit hops in the same way this one is. This is like one of those newfangled layered gums that changes flavor halfway through, but really the first flavor lingers and taints the rest of it. Only here, by ""taint"" I mean ""makes the more bitter hops all good'n'plenty fruity."""
"D: Really well balanced IPA, the body and flavor of this beer make it an easy drinker that won't completely ruin your taste buds. Enjoy this beer and don't worry too much as the ABV is only 7%."
"D - Excellent. Easy to chug, but yet it's all the flavor that I'd expect from a world-class IPA. Definitely one of the best IPAs around."
"On tap at Holy Smoke BBQ during the snooglefest 2010 tour. The best pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches I have ever had. I've had this in a bottle but fresh on tap gives it that little extra kick. Wow compliments my bbq perfectly. Smells of fresh hops citrus and bitter grapefruit. I love this smell. Heavenly. Tastes like everything you could want in a hop forward citrus bomb. Balanced. It was a challenge to make this beer last."
"D - Wow, just wow. Do you've got all the head/lacing, the intense fruity aromas, that taste, and the nice carbonation. A winner in all aspects. I knew when I first tried this I would be giving it all 5's and spent the rest of this bottle trying to come up with reasons NOT to give categories 5's. I couldn't come up with anything. This IPA was just that good. I guess my only complaint would be the bottle price I paid ($10.25). Really wish I had another few bottles of this!"
"IPAs are my beer of choice and this is as good an example as I've tried."
"I must profess that I am not a huge hophead, but my first sip of this was eye-rollingly delicious. Hop flavor is bursting with huge flavors of light fruits. Bittering is there, but not tongue-scrapingly resinous. Not much malt, maybe a hint or two of honeyed grains. Best IPA I have ever had? Probably. A fresh imperial pint of this after deep sea fishing with some fish tacos might make for a perfect day in SD...hey I can dream, right?"
"What a beer, my new favorite IPA. Pours a golden orange hue into a Portsmouth brewery tulip. Smell is exceptionally fruity with mango, apricot, tangerine and pineapple all intermingling with each other with pine undertones throughout. Taste is initially perfectly balanced with hops, bitterness fruitiness and sweetness, but just a smidge, and I mean a smidge too bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth up front with a prickliness at the back. The only hit this one had for me was its very very slightly too bitter finish but it was much closer to a 5 than a 4.5. A well executed masterpiece Ballast Point."
"D - This is a real drinkable beer for a hop head. The bitterness keeps you coming back for more. As I've become accustomed to drinking really bitter beers this one still pounds my palate. I can't wait to see this in 6 packs. While I can easily drink a bomber of this it will be amazing to put away 12oz at a time."
"D: Not a typical representation of the West Coast IPA, but Big Eye would fit that mold more. This fruit flavors balancing out the hop bitterness were a pleasant surprise, and this reminds me quite a bit like AleSmith IPA, another great San Diego IPA."
"Overall, the best single IPA I have ever had. Hands down, no contest. The tropical fruit hop profile, crisp mouthfeel, and clean finish make this a tough one to top. Definitely something I will jump at the opportunity to try fresh whenever I can. Highly recommended."
"D-An exceptionaly drinkable brew. I think I have found a new favorite IPA."
"Love this one. Wish I could get it this fresh more often."
"Poured into a fluted tulip, it's quick to generate a fluffy head of sticky foam. Instant resiny aroma packed with floral/herbal hops and tropical fruit. Color is a light high-clarity orange with tiny rising bubbles. Lacing forms in sudsy sheets, and sticks around for awhile. Concentrated citrusy hop flavors of pink grapefruit and bitter orange pith. Residual leafiness and a juicy mango aftertaste. Pale malt is relegated to the back of the bus, but provides a slight tip to the balance scale. Moderate and creamy carbonation with the obligatory hop bite to it. Slightly dry in the end with a fairly long finish."
"D - An excellent IPA. The layering of so many dimensions of hop flavor make this a very interesting IPA and make you want to sip more and more."
"D- very very good IPA that is leaning toward the charactistics of a DIPA. Flavor is full and bitter- want to try one of these on draft!!"
"Finally got my hands on one of these bottles from my work. Pours a beautiful, bright, slightly cloudy orange color with a nice white head. The citrus hop aromas hit my nose the second I opened the cap. Tons of sweetness and citrus with a nice piney edge as well. Smell is reminiscent of Pliny the Elder. Taste however differs (which is expected considering Pliny is a DIPA). The taste is still DAMN good though. Initially I get some nice hop bitterness, immediately followed followed by some fresh pine with grapefruit, mango, and orange flavors. It end with a very crisp bitterness. The mouthfeel is very dry and crisp. Very ""west-coastish""...a great example if you ask me. The drinkability is quite high. Could probably drink 3 bombers of this stuff."
"""Session""? Easy!"
"D: wow, this is a great IPA. I've heard a lot of good things and they were all true. Can't wait to see this make it into the 6-pack format."
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for hooking me up with this as part of our trade. Crystal clear yellow-orange pour with big fluffy two-finger head and great lacing. Big, unique, fresh, hoppy, complex nose that's perfumy and floral with lots of citrus and fresh grass. The taste is just as big and just as complex. Full of tangerine, grapefruit, pine and resiny, fresh wet hops with a touch of peaches. The balance of this beer is absolutely perfect. Great bitter hop bite, but a nice sweet, malty backbone to make this probably the most drinkable beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is great, crisp and dry and just a tad resiny and chewy at the same time. I've had this beer once before when I was in San Diego on business, and it blew me away then. I have to say that this has just become my favorite IPA of all time. I'm trying to savor every drop as I finish off this bomber. What an awesome beer!"
"D - What more can I say, I was blown away by how good this was and I was daydreaming at work all day about the chance to taste this beautiful beer - just incredibly drinkable and hardly any alcohol in the flavor, yet you may feel it a little if you have one on an empty stomach like I did"
"D: I had two pints, so it's not a bad beer. It just seems out of place from a cask."
"D: A pretty good IPA, but definitely not one of my favorites. A little overrated if you ask me."
"Unfortunately this is one of my favorite IPA's I have had so far and I only say unfortunately because this is not currently distributed to Oregon, as if it was this would without a doubt be my go-to IPA. It really is well balanced, as far as hop-to-malt ratio, as well as a balance in hop flavor."
"Mouthfeel is so thin and well carbonated, this disappears way to fast. I must say that I believe this deserves the top spot among American IPA's. This screams California IPA and delivers in spades. Track it down if you can and enjoy!"
"Drinkability is high, only problem being is you normally can't find a lot of it too drink it so indispensably."
"What can I say about this beer that everyone else hasn't. I don't need to tell you what it smells or tastes like. There are plenty of reviews doing just that. What can I tell you about this beer? Drink it...drink lots of it! not just a fantastic IPA but just a great well balanced beer. If I could get it here in GA, it would be in my fridge all the time."
"Still a solid brew as my score will indicate, but I have had comparable IPAs."
"D : Wow. Ballast Point hit a huge home run here. You'll go through this fast because not only is it delicious & balanced, but so very invitingly beautiful."
"shared a bottle with a couple great BAs, thanks to rhodeska for the pour.Pours a medium orange-brown, with a thick head that ends up leaving a thin layer and an island of creamy head. has a steady stream of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. smeels great, of sharp bitter citrus american hops. smells Really, really good. tastes a little sweet, but with a big citrus hop bitter profile. tastes really good, but, the citrus hops don't have the crisp, fresh taste that make these beers world class... perhaps the bottle isn't fresh, I'm not sure. a good beer to be sure, but not incredible. feels pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. never harsh, could drink several."
"Easy to drink, a good IPA."
"About a finger of ivory head over a lighter than expected golden hue that's letting plenty of lights and shapes/colors through! Aromas are juicy from the hops. Citrus upfront on the nose. More balanced in flavor, with an obvious caramel malt sweetness that clings hard to the palate. There's some citrus in there, but not enough to overpower like a west coast hopbomb is known to do. Big bold hoppy bitterness creeps in from the back and actually takes me by surprise about halfway through the pint. Thick mouthfeel for an IPA, and lower carbonation. I love the mouthfeel because it leaves that IPA all over the surface of my mouth, leaving me wanting more!"
"Beer poured a clear golden orange with a nice white head that is leaving big lacing behind. Nose is tropical and citrus, mango comes to mind. In the taste department the malt bill takes a backseat to let the alpha hop flavors shine thru. Lemon zest and mango hops hammer home a clean finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a light to medium body and mild carbonation. Drinkability is very good, lots of aromas and flavors going on coupled with a clean finish make this one of the better IPA's out there. Recommended to fellow advocates to try if you can find it"
"overall: hell of a beer to do for my 100th great IPA the 70 IBU in this beer feels like its 90 IBU every hop head should try this."
"Carbonation is high, keeping this hop monster at bay with a little harshness towards the finish. Damn close to a Double IPA - packing this many alpha acids in a bottle really tugs at my heartstrings. While I initially considered this one a bit of a lightweight due to the weak malt profile and the bubbles, the second half of the bottle is silky enough to warrant a bump in mouthfeel, while the carbonation continues to keep my mouth scrubbed and ready for another sip. Or bottle."
"D: This is a good beer, it used to be a great beer but it's still up there with the better West Coast IPA's."
"Amber-orange in color with a dense white head that leaves a consistent white cap and wet lacings on the glass. Big floral, hoppy aroma. Grapefruit and tropical mango aromas are fresh and clean. Velvety smooth feel with refreshing carbonation. Sweet malty flavor in the beginning that leads to big grapfruit, mango citrus flavors and a clean balanced finish. Good balance of malt and hops. An excellent IPA and very drinkable."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. A medium golden color with about 2 and a half fingers of white head. Smell blasted up my nose of tropical fruit, peaches, and grapefruit. The smell that made me love IPA. Tastes very grapefruity and peachy. Very nice dry, medium strong bitter finish. Love this. Zaftig. Nice medium carbonation. I would drink a million of these."
"thanks Will"
"Drinkability: Aside from the slight lack of balance, this beer is really quite good; it's refreshingly bitter and not really heavy at all, so getting through 22 oz. really doesn't pose too much of a problem."
"I'm proud this beer is from my hometown, and I got to have one of the first batches quite a while ago. It hasn't changed, and has set the bar very high for future brews. Can't wait to have another!"
"D: Superb. I had no problem polishing off the bomber, and could have easily had more. This is definitely a beer to search out and try if you haven't already."
"D - low abv's make this one insane... and it's insane to make this the first beer of the night and try to switch up to something else unless your gonna do like a PTE it's brutal.. nothing really comes close to this... ughhh i hate that i gotta give it up like this but i do... i think this is the best single IPA I've ever had!"
"As far as taste, what can I say? Fresh Sculpin is one of the best IPAs I have had to date. Completly west coast from the ground up, full of tangerine, grapefruit, mango, and a stern bitterness. Flavors here seem infinitely bright and lively. The hop profile is resiny and sticky, and the mouthfeel is thick enough to back it up without ever becoming too heavy. A malt presence acts as a sturdy base, but asserts itself no further. I reccomend anyone and everyone to try this fresh, its an excellent IPA that lives up to its good name."
"d-excellent, overall i'm very happy. a sipper, but still quite easy drinking. i would have no reason to stop at one if it were easier to get in WI!"
"MF/D: not overly tart so each sip goes down very smooth as the carbonation is very front heavy and slightly numbs the tongue."
"I try not to be influenced by ratings or hype but this is excellent stuff. It reminds me pretty clearly of my one sample of Blind Pig and my one sample of Pliny the Elder. There's a delicate balance to this coupled with a boldness of flavor that is very appealing. I am sad to see this bottle emptied, but I think I can get a couple more so I think I'll be ok."
"Summary: This is easily one IPA that I would buy again and again if it were available in my area. This is a treat to savor."
"Great IPA. Highly recommended. Few are this good without being highly bitter."
"D - With so many in this genre being glorified citrus bombs, its nice to drink such a refreshing, thirst quenching, easy drinking IPA. I could drink these all day."
"Nice smooth beer. Glad I have access to it out here."
"Drinkability -- Starts fruity and caramelized, finishes dry and bitter: the best of both worlds in one sip. When an opportunity arises to drink a top-rated beer I do my best to stay critical and not get wrapped up in the hype. This beer, however, rightfully deserves all of the accolades it has been bestowed. World-class!"
"(served in wine-glass, seafoam head, absolutely enviable lacing, like a goddamn tree trunk)"
"On-Tap: 4.75/5"
"D - Unbelievably well balanced. More so than most ofthe other IPA's I've had. I didn't even notice that it was a 7% beer. It is quite enjoyable and it would be a tremendous beer on a hot day in the summer."
"Thanks daaaah!"
"D-Enjoy the beer so much I don't feel the alcohol. Very easy to finish."
"Very drinkable and very floral"
"Based on what the label tells me, I kinda wanna try some sculpin meat. Anyway, the beer pours a clear golden straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose holds plenty o' sharp pine and even sharper grapefruit, with a buttery toffee undercurrent. The taste follows pretty closely, though the toffee loses both some power and some butter. The hops, though, remain rather powerful throughout. The body is a light medium, with moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a strong IPA, but kinda overly one-dimensional in favor of the hops. I'd prefer a bit more balance, but it's pretty damn good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: A good citrusy and super bitter finishing IPA. A sipper that I could have a couple of. One of the better in the style that I have had, certainly in my top 10 of the style, but not in my top 5."
"THANKS, MIKE!"
"This is a session beer - one I can drink one after the other. None of the layers of citrus hops, piney hops ,or malts are that complex, and the mouthfeel is pretty thin. However, for a relatively light beer that packs a great flavor, Sculpin IPA is the way to go. I would order this at ANY bar where it is on the menu and would purchase at least one bottle at any store where it is in stock."
"Pours a crystal clear, amber orange color with a big fluffy head and leaves soapy residue lacing. Tastes a touch flat to me, has a big hop bitterness with a lacking malt backbone, typical west coast style. Really this is a hoppy IPA, but its lacking balance. Mouthfeel is off as its too flat for me, dense bubbles leave the palate battered with the austere hop characteristics. drinkability is high on this as its got a realatively moderate ABV and would be nice on a hot summer day. not the best IPA i have ever had but still worthy by all means. not worth the 9.99 price tag though."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is like a freshly cut grapefruit, loads of citrus with a nice sweet malt backbone. The taste is just about IPA prefection, loads of citrus hops with a nice amount of pine as well. A nice burnt caramel backbone provides the right amount of balance. The beer is on the light side of medium, very smooth and refreshing after a hot day. This is without question one of my favorite beers, I can't wait for it to come out in six-packs this fall."
"Well this now could very well be my favorite IPA. Need I say if it is drinkable?"
"Pours a nice deep golden color with a thick and frothy white head that retains impressively and leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is equally impressive, with big citrus fruitiness upfront, along with some pine resin and passion fruit, some biscuit, caramel, esters, and alcohol...not especially complex but impeccably fresh smelling. The flavor is also nice, but a bit of a letdown from the appearance/aroma...notes of citrus and piney hops initially, a little mint, biscuit, herbs, caramel, orange marmalade, alcohol and a slight hint of funk. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly, and drinkability is excellent. Overall a really nice IPA, with a fresh hop character that is pleasant and clean at the same time, there isn't a massively bitter finish like with some lesser IPAs."
"Drinkability- I could propably drink this all day during those hot summer days! A terrific beer!"
"Drinkability - This American IPA excelled my expectations."
"Drinkability: This is probably the best regular IPA I've ever come across. I tend to order this whenever I see it on draft and pick up some bottles when it is available here in Philly, which is quite often."
"The tropical hop flavors really shine here. I'll have to remember to look up which varieties were used. This beer certainly lives up to its high scores."
"D- very drinkable, but those IBUs can kick your ass after each sip if you're not expecting it. One hell of an IPA"
"Not much more to say really. Clearly, this is one of the best IPA's on the planet and is always an absolute treat to find fresh and on tap. Even poured from a 2 day old growler, this beer is/was just terrific. Yummm!!!"
"D - Highly drinkable; the flavors all blend nicely although 7% is slightly on the high side, I think I'll happily and relatively quickly finish this 22. I wouldn't characterize this as a ""hop bomb", and I appreciate the subtlety of the flavors here."
"I was excited to try this one on draft and it's still a damn tasty brew but I seem to enjoy this one out of the bottle a little bit more..."
"Drinkability- This one was awesome. I loved it. It was so delicious."
"Poured from a bottle into a Duvel oversized tulip glass. Golden appearance with about a half inch of head. Citrus hops smell that carries over into the taste. Not the biggest hop bomb I've ever had, but very drinkable. Wonderful beer completely deserving of its ranking as a top IPA."
"Feels very smooth & dry, medium-bodied. This has to be one of the easiest-drinking IPAs I've had, I like having a strongly hoppy beer I don't have to wrestle with. Good show."
"A: Decent head with some minor lacing, medium straw in color, extremely transparent - 4.00, S: Quite pungent and loads of pink grapefruit and pine, lemon zest and tropical fruits on the nose, mildly brash countered with a slight floral aroma, a wonderful aromatic American IPA - 4.50, T: Defined hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue, slightly grassy, grapefruit pith and pine, malt is present but hides comfortably behind all the hops, clean alcohol flavors - 4.50, M: Medium body, faintly dry - 4.00, D: This is one extremely drinkable IPA, extremely enjoyable and one I'd gladly drink again - 4.50"
"These go down nicely. The 7% abv is hardly noticeable so finish one 22 ouncer and you may not be able to open another. Now I know what all the hub bub is about."
"Almost 2 years later and this is still one a my favorite Ipas."
"Overall a tasty and complex hop bomb."
"D: This beer has a phenomenal smell and taste, and it also light, crisp and refreshing. Closer to a DIPA than a regular one. Definitely one of my favorite IPA's."
"D - Actually a very drinkable IPA coming in at 7%. I'd like to thank tbadiuk for the great trades again. You've got some Allagash coming your way!"
"Pours an amber orange color with life and a thin foam head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and pine with hints of apricot. Has a creamy bitter taste with the bitterness becoming more pronounced through the finish. You get a very subtle hit of sweet up front and then lots of malt on the finish. Very tasty. But I feel it is a tad overrated."
"This is one of my top overall drinking beers. Refreshing, easy to drink and complex (without being overpowering)."
"D - Easily the most drinkable IPA I've ever had."
"Although its a bit pithy on the back end, the drinkability is pretty good overall, since you don't notice the booze at all."
"(Now if someone would just send me a case or two...)"
"drinkability: good"
"T:"
"D: Don't know if this one deserves the number 1 IPA, but it is up there. Highly drinkable and very tasty. Would love to have this one down South."
"The most integrated IPA I've ever tasted - fruity malts meld seamlessly with citrus hops. I could drink nothing but this for a whole summer and be happy."
"D - It's not over-the-top in any regard which really helps Sculpin in drinkability. I've got the 22 oz bomber to myself tonight (which is good after the day I had) so I don't presume any left over [nope, none]."
"D - This really shines on the CO2, lets the hop profile get a higher level of complexity. Alcohol is well hidden, I could sluck this down all night, until the 7% catches up to me."
"D - Very impressed with how drinkable it was. I only had a small bit of it, but felt that I could have had many, many more before it would start to wear on me"
"Overall beautifully drinkable. A tasty, tasty drop."
"Dirty dishwater yellow. Not much of a head, but what there is sticks to the glass. Opaque. Resinous and piney aroma. Don't know why, and IPAs are my favorite, I'm always reminded of cat urine when I smell them (but, oddly enough, not in a bad way). Maybe too much time with my head over the litter box. Probably says too much about myself already. Piney and bitter up front. Smooth. Cask makes anything better. A tad of sweetness in the middle and on the back end. Smooth as silk. I'd have another if there wasn't so much to choose from."
"Overall, a very nice beer, one that I would gladly buy again. A must have if you are into IPA's or really any craft brew, but I don't know if it fully lives up to its top 20 rating."
"D - Refreshing and very easy drinking, particularly on a hot late spring day. 22oz disappeared quickly. Glad to see the legendary Sculpin hold up, I was very happy to have found this close to me. Excited about the 2nd bottle waiting in my fridge :)"
"The 7% ABV doesn't seem very far-fetched, but that's not to say that this sweet and sassy IPA couldn't be sessioned."
"D- A very nice take on the style. If this came in six packs, you'd be all set."
"D: The ABV is pretty much invisible, this drinks far too easy for such a hoppy beer."
"Loved it. Try it."
"Overall a fantastic AIPA. So glad I was able to secure a few bottles of this."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is light carbonation is perfect. This is a very easy to drink hoppy beer. Wish I had about a gallon of this beer."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip, Sculpin is a lovely light orange color. A good sized (~ 2 finger) creamy white head forms and leaves behind plenty of lace (though a little more would have garnered a 5). Sculpin smells incredible, a mega blast of peaches and juicy grapefruits. The first sips then are a little bit of a disappointment, as there's a little bit of an unwelcome bitter undertone to the citrusy flavors, that when combined with the clean hop bitterness is just too much.This issue fades as the beer warms though, so a bump up to a 4 is warranted. The medium carbonation is very fine, to the beer's credit, and the body is, for a beer with no appreciable malt presence, surprisingly full. Sculpin was a bit of a mini roller coaster ride for me, thrilled with the appearance and nose and initially underwhelmed with the taste, only to have the beer recover beautifully. As one would hope, there's no heat at all from this 7% ABV beer, a fantastic example of a hop forward IPA"
"D: very good drinkable DIPA that deserves to be in the top 20. I'm glad I can get my hands on more"
"D: Very drinkable, crisp hoppy ipa perfectly suited for a summer time quencher. I enjoyed this on a warm day of 85+F and it quenched the thirst quite nicely beating the heat and wetting the whistle. Get your own bomber, a limited release that is all mine."
"Thanks to Eric for generously sharing this one."
"Really clean, drinkable, fresh IPA - certainly among the upper tier but not my absolute favorite. Would have gone for a little more emphasis on the fruity, tropical citrus and at 7% it's not something you'll down a night's worth of pints of (though you'll want to). Glad I had a go at it, thanks Vince!"
"Medium bodied but on the lighter end with a slightly chewy hop forward presence that lingers over the subtle malt backbone into a sweet yet dry finish. Again, the flavor of this beer is dominated by insanely fresh delicious hops that give off a slight dry bitterness and a huge tropical/citrus fruit notes. Lots of mango, pineapple, orange and lemon peel and grapefruit. There's also a slightly lactic creaminess that adds to the beer's complexity and makes it incredibly smooth and quaffable. The malt backbone is subtle and slightly toasty with hints of caramel, biscuit and graham cracker. Perfectly balanced with sweet fruit, dry bitter hop and subtle malt flavors bouncing off of each other. I can't say enough about this beer. One of my favorites of all time and highly recommended!"
"This is, as many people before me have said, an exceptional beer. It is never an extreme beer, but it is an excruciatingly meticulous production of an IPA. Wow - this is exactly, exactly what I want from my IPA; fresh, flavoursome, clean, crisp, drinkable - and I'm so pleased I've found it."
"I have had this beer more than a few times but never written a review. This one is based on a 22 0z. bottle. Poured a light golden amber with an ample two-finger head which dissapted into a white covering fairly quickly. Lacing was on the lighter side but lasted. Nose is a wonderful collection of orange and mango, some pine and floral hops. Taste starts with a some sweetness and citrus and then quickly folds into a pleasantly dry and mildly bitterness. There is some alcohol warming at the end as well. Feel is medium to light and oily. This is a very refreshing beer you must try - IF it's fresh. Highly recommended and near the top of my favs."
"D- if i could find this more readily it would be in my fridge on the reg!!!!"
"D- The hop bite isn't as major as some IPA's so it doesn't wreck the palate. That makes the drinkibility high. A great all around beer that I am glad was finally made available to me."
"D: could easily drink more than my share of this, highly recommended IPA"
"Without a doubt, this is one of the best IPAs I have had. It easily ranks with 90 Minute IPA, which until tonight was my unquestionable favorite. Now... now, I would say it's a tie."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large frothy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with deep caramel malt backbone is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of citrus hops with some floral undertones though no grapefruit notes and a deep and solid caramel malt backbone with balanced sweetness level. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done with great balance between malt and hops."
"Pours clear yellow gold with a white head. Pretty light color for an IPA. Smell is fairly muted, citrusy hops is all I really get. Taste is citrusy hops and a strongly bready malt finish. Very interesting finish for an IPA, instead of lingering bitterness there is lingering bready malt. I actually have remarkably little to say about Sculpin, considering how highly it has been rated. It's a very drinkable, mild IPA, beyond that I don't see how this ended up where it is. Certainly good, but to quote Jim Carey ""I've had better""."
"I can understand the craze for this one."
"I drank this at a west coast ipa tasting last night and this was the favorite amongst beers like PtE and Pure Hoppiness. Very good..."
"Tasted from bomber bottle. Pours a clear, pale gold with a medium white head that dissipates quickly. Nose is hoppy with some malt and some tropical fruits. This is somewhat malty on the front of the palate with a stone fruit sweetness on the mid-palate. The finish is bitter hops. Overall, this is a very solid single IPA."
"Overall, a very pleasant and enjoyable beer, but it didn't blow me away."
"This is a great beer. I was hoping for something out of the ordinary, and that's precisely what I got. The Midwest is where it's at and has many quality IPAs of its own, but Sculpin is another reason to retain just a bit of jealousy toward the west coast."
"D - Very solid and very tasty IPA. I will look for more of this one for sure."
"Very happy to have tried it. A good beer I could drink all the time but wouldn't really seek it out."
"3.5 D: Pretty good, but one of the reason I really like DIPAs are for the awesome creamy mouthfeels. Still, I'm glad this comes to Pittsburgh from time to time."
"The feel of this beer is a pretty smooth beer. It goes down pretty darn smooth but does leave it's mark on your mouth as it bitters the palate with some nice flavor."
"The body is smooth and lush. The bitterness in the finish isn't overbearing, but it makes its presence known. Given that, the drinkability score goes up. This might be the best hoppy, clean, somewhat balanced, drinkable IPA out there. The hops really shine on this one."
"D- OK, I could totally have more than one bomber of this. The alcohol is a tad high, I really wish it fell into the session ale limits of 5%."
"D - great warm weather drink, didnt doubt this beer at all, will continue seeking this out whenever i can"
"Poured into my SA glass, a goldish/orange color with about one finger of head, with good lacing. The aroma given off was of tropical fruits, but to my taste, it was grapefruit that stood out the most. Crisp and clean, very easy to drink, well balanced. I like this beer. I've bought two bombers, will be going back for more...."
"D-Nice beer. The previous bottle I had (a month or so ago) seemed to have more flavor/aroma. Maybe this bottle is showing its age."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. This is a very good IPA, damn near perfect. I am so very glad that I got to dink it, I just need a few more in the fridge. Thanks boralyl, once again for getting me this."
"D - Nicely drinkable, if it were a little lighter would score higher on that aspect, but not like I'm having a problem getting this down. Very good beer."
"Another great IPA from the west-coast. This beer is inviting, well balanced, crisp, and has great flavors; each sip deserves another."
"Excellent IPA! This stuff is close to the smell of Hopslam and excellent."
"Very good beer overall. All flavors were seemingly upfront and didnt leave for much complexity which lead to great flavor."
"Had my first Sculpin in 2009 and the rest is history. Picked this up at The Best Damn Beer Shop in San Diego while on vacation. Had a limit of three per person. Awesome representation of a sweet looking fish on the label. Bomber pour into a pint glass and I am met with a yellow gold hazy brew with a nice big white foamy head. The aroma is amazing. Peaches, pears, grapefruit and lemon zest aroma. Taste is kick ass. Not as much grapefruit as I thought which was nice. Hoppy, bitter on the initial sip and tangy bite on the swallow followed by the drying of the buds until the next sip. At 7% this is extremely dangerous as multiple bombers can be easily achieved in one session. One of my favorite IPA's on the market."
"One of those beers you wish didn't have alcohol it it so you could have it all night without any hangover. But I had one anyway. Thanks to route66pubs for this one!"
" This was just ok for me, it wasn't anything to write home about."
"Overall I have to say I was a bit disappointed by this. No doubt it is a great representation of the style, but I just didn't love it as much as I was hoping I would."
"PS... I also love to drink this brew with a grilled fillet of fresh cought Sculpin."
"Very tasty, recommended."
"Ballast Point must be the Don McLean of brewing: they expend all their creative energy on one brilliant beer, leaving none for the rest."
"drinkability - very enjoyable for a single IPA, super flavorful"
"Pours a golden orange, nice pine and citrus on the nose. Taste is more of the same with some hop and alcohol bite balanced by some orange-y citrus flavors. Mouthfeel was prickly with nice carbonation.This was a nice IPA, but I'm not sure why it is ranked so high here. Good balance I'd guess, but Ive had a handful of single IPAs better than this, including Ballast Point Big Eye, not sure why this one gets all the love."
"D: A world-class hop bomb to be sure. Though that doesn't make it a bitter bomb. Prime example of a West Coast IPA, as I understand it."
"D: I like it! I would have another and buy it again. Another winning IPA from San Diego."
"Drinkability: Ok so I went into this with a don't believe the hype mentality, and I arose with a worthy of praise attitude. This is not a bitter bomb, it's at the extreme end of balanced. If you want a big biting hoppy bitter enamel ripper, look elsewhere, this brew is simply awesome...love it"
"Light to medium bodied. Bitter, dry, and nicely carbonated. A very nice beer, which I wish was more readily available. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"Nice! One of my favorites from this brewery. Poured a rich three finger head that slowly receded to one finger head with bumpy foam. Nice aroma, very floral, piney and hoppy. Nice orangish hue but clear. Goes down smooth but since I purchased in a bomber, probably not a session beer. Will definitely try this agin. Nice label, too. Thank you, Whole Foods."
"d: Fabulous IPA that lives up to the hype for sure. I've seen these around several times but never bought one until now. Its really hard to pull the trigger on a freshness critical $10 bomber that doesn't have a bottled on date. Glad I tried it because I absolutely loved it. I won't buy it again though, too expensive and too risky."
"Pretty solid American IPA. Was a little caught up in the ""hype"" and extremely high BA rating (one that somewhat puzzles me) but it really didn't diminish this experience. I still very much enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink it again, do I think it is the best IPA's there is? Probably not, but it is pretty damn good nonetheless..."
"A damn fine beer. (Piny light) West Side IPA represents at it's best!"
"Overall this is a solid IPA in its own right that sort of walks the line between IPA and DIPA. I can see how some people would swoon over this brew but with so many knock out IPAs coming from the west, this one comes off as run of the mill to me."
"d- really nice ipa here, this beer lives up to the hype, it's a really flavorful, complex, interesting ipa, very delicious!"
"Very drinkable and very good IPA."
"Honestly, I was disappointed in this beer. I expected it to feel better, and to give me a little more balance and adventurous flavor. It's definitely a top notch IPA, but for me, there needs to be more than grapefruit and a little toastiness to justify 22ozs of gradually building bitterness."
"Sculpin is on the same level as Bell's Two-Hearted, another absolutely awesome IPA. Too bad I don't have the same kind of access to Sculpin as I do Two-Hearted, but no complaints, this was a fantastic experience. So, what's with the fish theme on all these amazing American IPAs!?"
"Smell is good ol' grapefruit with a huge caramel malt center. Some pine and sweet citrus. A hint of ginger. A big breadiness and lovely tropical fruitiness as well. Taste is grapefruit and caramel. A smooth bitterness and hop oil astringency. This is so close to perfect. Finish is dry and clean with a touch of earth, herbs, and hop oil. Feel is crisp with a light effervescence and medium weight. Refreshing and super drinkable with a thirst quenching personality."
"This is truly a great beer and an easy drinkin IPA, to bad it is so tough to come by."
"Overall, I did not care for this beer and was quite disappointed, especially given it's price. I paid about $10 for the bomber, and wish I had spent that money instead on a 6-pack of Two Hearted Ale."
"Pours a beautiful bright gold color, with a huge white head that quickly disappears. Incredibly intense fresh hoppy nose here, with peaches, apricots, pine, citrus and bubblegum. Tasting this one is a huge letdown after that amazing nose. Mostly hops (pine, fresh mown grass, lemons), with no real malt to balance it out. Not all that bitter, and really not all that complex. A solid, but far from spectacular, IPA."
"I'm surprised that this beer lived up to the hype. The intensity of the hops is amazing. Biscuit malt is there, but after a few sips your tongue is numb from the incredibly 'green' hop bitterness. A hophead delight."
"Sculpin's a hop bomb in every sense of the word, but not one I'm going to see or purchase very often for several reasons. Too bad, because it's that good."
"The beer is loaded with citrusy, piney hop. The hop is a melange of coniferous elements. There is some orange burst, some lemony citrus hop, some grapefruit sourish hop, but mostly just the estery and pungent piney hop. The beer is medium bodied, very tasty, and it has a nice smooth mid section that adds complexity and assertiveness so that the whole beer isn't taken up with just the strong hop presence. This is a very nice beer. The hops cleanse the palate and it has almost a medicinal quality to it. It is a beer worth coming back to if you need a strong hop blast. L'Chaim."
"Finally available in limited amounts here in NJ, and very fresh. Pours a bright orange brown color with a large, strong, fluffy white head. Tons of aromatics, very in your face hop character in the nose. Perfectly balanced, enough malt to really sink your teeth into while not distrubing the wonderfully grassy, fruity bitterness of the hops that stay center stage throughout. Less than medium bodied, perfect carbonation and at 7% this beer is plain dangerous. Amazing stuff here."
"Drinkability: This is a hell of a crazy IPA. Huge flavor in this relatively low alcohol beer. The bitterness is a little overpowering, and it is quite unbalanced (by design) but it is still very drinkable, and I wish my bomber wasnt empty."
"D- I enjoyed this IPA and is a great example of West Coast IPAs. Definitely one of the better ones out there."
"D - Only have one bottle, I may have to acquire another one, two, or six. Perfection (when it comes to drinkability)."
"For a standard West Coast IPA, this is out of sight. The most extraordinary aspect of Sculpin was the outstanding dynamism of its mouthfeel - sensual and seductive with a little ""sting"". This is a rare example of a West Coast IPA firing on all cylinders, reaching for extreme taste and an intriguing mouthfeel while remaining imminently drinkable. An instant favorite."
"O: Great example of a West Coast IPA. Can't wait to get my hands on more."
"D: Just a really nice beer that goes down well."
"Altogether, very drinkable and at 7% it is sessionable. I could drink several pints of this, whatever the occasion. I especially enjoy the long extended fruity hoppy finish. Makes you pause between sips just to enjoy the extended sensation."
"Mouthfeel is good. A bit chewy. Doesn't wreck your palate completely like say a Hopsickle. Carbonation is lively."
"Drinkability: this beer is refreshing, and hits the spot. Goes down quickly, one could savor a few pints of this in a session."
"Just a classic American IPA here from Ballast Point, that combine massive but well balanced West Coast hop flavors into a wonderfully smooth and easydrinking package (for the size of it at least!). Just awesome stuff here as usual, that tasted the best that it could here on draft at the source."
"Overall, it's a lot of fun. The smell stood out as the ""star"" to me. It took me a while to get to my first sip because of it. I'd love to see the rumored 6-pack. Unfortunately, the cost will probably keep me away for a while."
"I found myself sipping this beer. The dryness made me want to drink this with some water. It could also use some more malt sweetness to balance out all the hops. Still, The wonderful aroma and hoppy flavor should put a smile on any hopheads face."
"D: Although I was a little disappointed with the taste, this beer is eminently drinkable. At 7% a.b.v., I could definitely tip back several of these if the price tag wasn't sooo high. Generally speaking, I enjoyed this brew, but I'm not sure if it really stands out as far from other good American IPAs as the average review score bears out."
"Overall Impression: This is the best American IPA I've ever had! It's what West Coast (San Diego) IPA is all about. If only it were more readily available and affordable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing. I could definitely knock back a few of these (even more so if there was a bit more sweetness)."
"I could drink this until I fell down, got up, drank more, and then vomited. Then I'd definitely be ready to drink some more."
"Yellow-gold pour with a loose white head. Very catty with lots of ammonia like presence, some floral pine, honey and a faintly minty, very bitter finish. Medium-thinnish body with moderate carbonation. This just wasn't very impressive. The body and mouthfeel were really lacking. Big intense flavor for a standard IPA though."
"A medium mouthfeel - not chewy , not watery, chewfactor is denigrated from the dry bitter bite. Low to medium carbonation. Drinkability is relatively high because at only 7% you could have a few of these, but tough to drink them one after the other because of price and availability."
"D - solid IPA, not outstanding...price tag in the area pushes this to a ""try once and move on"" beer ($6 for 12oz pour). definitely different from regular Sculpin...not better."
"D- I'd like to see somebody try to take a glass of Sculpin away from me. If I hadn't just dropped $80 dollars on KBS, I would have cleared the Sculpin from shelves of this store. I haven't even had it before but reviews on this site have said it's exceptional and I can not disagree in the least. Pick up as much as you can drink in the near future whenever you see this beer on the shelves"
"D - This comes in a close second to Nelson as a AIPA that I wish I could get on a regular basis."
"All in all, this is a fantastic brew if you want super hops. I'm not a hop man myself. This is super dry and hoppy. If you want some malts and sweet flavors, than this is not your brew."
"Only knock against it is the price, but this is maybe the only 9 dollar a bomber IPA that I think is EASILY worth it."
"Overall drinkability would good. I could easily drink this all the time. I can't say it's the best American IPA in the world. Having just had Bling Pig, and Founders The Chronic recently.I can't put this up there with those two. I would maybe put it in the top 10 though."
"Sculpin gets a lot of hype out here, and it's a beer that does well to live up to it. It's a fresh, easy drinking IPA with good hop flavor and a really nice finish. Highly recommend (though, that $10.99 a bomber is hard to swallow...)"
"D: Very drinkable, this one is excellent with a decent amount of alcohol and huge flavors it is one excellent IPA."
"d- damn near perfect. i had trouble giving it all 5's for the fact that i think the hops were a little weak and i would like to see a little bit more added to this beer without it having that peatmoss and pine tree taste and keeping the high levels of fruits. i could argue this beer on to anyones top 5 favorite IPA list."
"(D)- A great example of a great IPA. Rather fruit driven that I enjoy. Goes down easy & tastes great. What I like about it is that it wasnt just made to draw higher IBUs, but that it balances all of the things that makes a great IPA. Fantastic brew!"
"I wasn't sure what to expect from such an overly hyped beer, but I was not disappointed. Very good IPA."
"Pours a little golden hue. no fizz but definitely visual signs of carbonation, no head. Very nice aroma. lots of citrus and pine . It gives off a nice medium bitter aroma. This beer is light bodied. I feel like a lot of breweries will have a huge hop bomb backed by some malt, but not this one (those beers are also usually 9% and up, this is under 8%, this note is probably referring to the fact that I drink more DIPAs than IPAs). The taste is pretty good. This seems similar with it intentions as beers like Hop Juice: all about the hops, not the malt. The flavor leans more towards the citrus notes than anything, leaving a slight grapefruit taste in your mouth. The pine notes are there to balance it out, but not too much. This beer is has a bunch of flavor is not in your face. There's no direct attack from the hops, but they don't go unnoticed. Start to finish your getting a bouqet of flavors. I think as the beer warms up a tad some sweet flavors some out. Notes of grapefruit are really starting to show. I think for me to really enjoy that I'd like more malt, but it's a minor complaint."
"Overall, likeable beer but forgettable. Maybe I got a bad one or something but I think this one may be a little sandbagged in the overall grade it snags on here. I guess that basically I was expecting a bit more than I got in the flavor and feel of the beer. This one was really just the big eye IPA with a greater amount of hops in it so not too exciting."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, yes, yes. Next time its released fresh I'll be stocking up on this super fine fish."
"Bocktown had this on tap, it lasted from Wednesday nights tasting to mid day Thursday. I'm glad I stopped in for some lunch time beers on Thursday. Appears a pale copper hue with a bubbling bright white head, forms intricate fine lacing down the sides of my glass as it dwindles. Aromatics have a full blown hop garden going on with bountiful citrusy graperfruit and tropical fruit tones, raw floral and herbal qualities as well, with some mild sweetness making it's way from the pale malts. Flavor was brazenly bitter full on assault of bitter orange peel pith, floral herbal hops, and again tropical fruit juiciness. Pale malts gave enough bread and biscuit components just to balance out the huge hop profile. Killer experience I can't wait to try more from these guys, mouthfeel was oily resinous medium bodied ale. Soft mellow carbonation made this one lubricatingly smooth experience, drinkable as all hell. I'm 100% sold and I'm glad I found this brew that I have been trying to track down for over 5 yrs now, a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh beer scene."
"Finish is nice. Ends on another sweet note, which is nice. The aftertaste that lingers reminds me of having sucked on an orange slice 5 minutes ago... This is one that makes me not want to eat or drink anything else, for fear of losing that aftertaste. If I had more of this, I would have another one!"
"D-such a great beer. very smooth. Flavors in this beer just seem to pop. Nice and complex."
" Drinkability:goes down like the best of them..although for $10 for a bomber in MA(when you can find it) i think it would be better to just mix West Coast I.P.A & Torpedo I.P.A cause that's what it tastes like"
"Overall, this is truly a special IPA. Since I had it just after a Pliny the Elder I'd have to give the nod to the PtE but I hate to make such a comparison because this is an exceptional beer. It's a tremendously intricate IPA and is worth every effort in being sought out. Top-notch beer."
"D - This is a fairly easy drinker. I found myself drinking it a bit faster than normal."
"Drinkability is very good, pleasure on the palate, I wish I could drink it all day long."
"D - Wow. This is just about the most perfect IPA I can imagine. I found myself continuing to go back for more - it's almost too good to savor, you just keep taking sips. An absolute must-try for any beer lover, and especially so for lovers of fruity, floral IPAs."
"Very drinkable beer and one you could drink multiples of in a sitting. Glad I finally got to try it, but sadly this qualifies as another beer that, good as it is, is hard to keep justifying at the price point."
"D: Refreshing, flavorful, and balanced. This one gets an overall ""noms +"" from me."
"The Sculpin IPA pours a brilliantly bright gold color with lots of carbonated bubbles flowing from the SN etched pint glass. A very frothy 2 finger head that does not go away throughout the brew. This is one of the best looking heads I have ever seen. Aromas are pleasantly hops with lot of fruits including apricots, lemons and grapefruit. Quaff is dominated with hops. Also some of the same citrus fruits from the aroma and also pine flavors. No alcohol is noted in the quaff but wow the hops in this are amazing. A hop heads dream come true. Mouthfeel is crispy and full bodied. Drinkability is unbelievable... Flavor profile is intense but incredible. Thanks again Jesse for giving me the chance to try this."
"Bottle pours clear amber orange color with off white head. Aroma is pine, grass, pinapple, and lemon. There are just wonderful citrus flavors not typically present in other beers in this style and this one has them all in one. Medium mouthfeel. Flavors follow the nose and finish dry. Really nice beer and one I'd drink regularly if I could."
"Man, believe the hype. This is a great beer with absolutely no glaring flaws, likely because they only brew it when they have the time to do it right. I'm a sucker for tropical fruit leaning IPAs and this is one of the best in that vein of the style that I've had the pleasure of trying. I'll snag a bottle whenever it comes out this way."
"Disappointed in this one, especially after the aromas right after opening the bottle."
"D- Glad it's only 7% and it's impressive that it packs such a wallop with that lower type ABV. It took a few sips of this serving type to get the full effect from the taste but that changed by the second sip and stayed throughout the 16oz. While bitter this does not kill your ability to enjoy it and bask in the tropic plunge. I will gladly drink the shit out of Sculpin anytime and look forward to having it again soon."
"Medium carbonated, with a creamy and light body. Overall, the well balanced flavors and the creamy mouthfeel make this beer highly drinkable."
"Dry and drinkable, balanced to to the bitter and hoppy, damn this is good."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are nothing abnormal or unusual. Just a really hoppy IPA. I like this beer and would have it again."
"Overall a very good beer. Go get it"
"d - Overall I really enjoyed this IPA. The smell was one of the best smelling IPAs I've ever smelled, and the taste was great too. Very easy to drink and wonderful fresh. I would put this right below PTE and HopSlam in terms of my favorite IPAs and would highly suggest trying this if you see it."
"D: One f the best IPAs I have ever had. If only I could still get it here. Once again, Thanks to 7ways for hooking me up with this treat!"
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! Wow, what a hop nose on this one. It's light with mostly a pale malt grist. It's incredibly bitter with a ton of citrus hops. The taste is great as well. It has a tremendous hop flavor thats bitter up front and resinates in the finish. It's light and easy drinking with a solid pale malt base. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It so incredibly smooth and drinkable. The hop character is outstanding."
"I'd have to give it a 4.5 for drinkability. I certainly won't have trouble finishing the bomber, but it stops just short of perfect here. A little high with the ABV, I find myself getting light-headed quicker than I would have expected. Or maybe this is just some secondary effect from the big hops....I seem to be a little sensitive to hops."
"Drinkability fares pretty well, this is a strong IPA and surely not to disappoint hop heads world wide. The San Diego brewery also boasts another IPA (Big Eye IPA) that is the mellow little brother to this hop heathen."
"I enjoyed the bomber and would love to have another glass. It was worth the wait and I will continue to look for a fresh bottle in Mass if I can come across one. I have been looking for two years now with no luck, they just don't stick around. Now I know why."
"Poured a clearish light mahogany with a thin bubbly head. Nose is nice floral and piny hops. Mouthful is a bit on the thin side. This is a nice an easy drinker for the hop fan, and also for the non hop fan. The hop flavor is prevalent but not overpowering. There is a hint of sweetness up front, then it is full on hops with a nice and long lingering bitter finish.Very well balanced and extremely drinkable. Very solid IPA from BP...definitely on my top 10"
"D: Highly drinkable if you crave a good IPA like I do, but at 7% abv the alcohol content is a little high for the style. This beer blurs the line between the single and double IPA categories. Sculpin seems less balanced than some other single IPAs I enjoy, such as Racer 5, Marin IPA, and even BP Bigeye. It is strikingly similar to GF West Coast IPA."
"Extremely easy to drink and extremely enjoyable."
"This beer poured slightly hazy golden amber into my imperial pint glass. Very nice fluffy head with fine lacing and marathon head retention. Wow, the aroma of this beer is insane. Citrus, pineapple and other tropical fruits. I am also getting some peach and other crazy fruity smells. I am detecting sweetness as well, but it really could just be from the amazing fruity hop bouquet. They need to make air fresheners that smell like this. The taste is like a hop punch to the tongue. I have heard beers described as tongue bruisers, and this one is a prime example. Hops, hops, hops. Pineapple, peach, citrus, pine... it is pretty amazing how intense the hop flavor is. Adding to this is a pretty high amount of bitterness. The bready malt is there, but really does not add much to the beer. It is basically just playing the role of a wingman to the hop goodness. My critical side keeps telling me that it is way unbalanced, but my hop loving side could care less. The more I drink this the more I like it. I would say this beer is fairly light bodied for the style, and the mouthfeel is not necessarily the best. A little bit too sticky dry from all the hops. Quite drinkable, but I find this beer is better to savor and enjoy the great aroma."
"D: I'll search this out again. Big hop flavors dominate and the bitterness carries from start to finish, but not in an unwelcome way. Not for the faint of heart, this beer is all about the hops. And they achieved it beautifully."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. Smooth and easy drinking. Great job Ballast Point!!"
"Drinkability: As drinkable as water-but delicious fruit and hop filled water."
"Hands down my favorite IPA."
"D: This is a big IPA. Easily top 3 that I've ever had. That being said, it goes down very easy. Would like to see this is 4/6 packs, but it looks like it's just a limited release (per the bottle)"
"Mouthfeel was almost sticky and the alcohol was masked pretty well. Not alot of balance here, but I didn't care because the hop flavors were delicious and not harsh."
"The mouthfeel follows closely with the smell and taste. This is a very tasty very easy drinking beer. I recieved this beer as part of my Secret Santa haul from stevemcqueenjr. I was very excited to be able to taste this and I wish that I could get this brew more often. This is a very good IPA and I can see why it is such a highly rated beer. Thanks go out to Matt for hooking me up with this awesome West Coast IPA."
"I don't know what I was thinking, but this is one of my favorite, all-time IPA's!"
"D - maybe give this one a 5 if it were not $10 a bomber if a bit less and bottled regularly look out this is a definate must have !!"
"Impression: Usually no. 1 on the IPA list. This beer deserves it. In a year of incredible IPA's from so many fine brewers, this one shines. Try this, esp. now that it is more widely available. You won't be disappointed."
"D - Highly drinkable, great tasting IPA with strong citrus/tropical flavors, I just wish it was a year-round brew. Well worth searching for this one, one of the best IPAs I've had in awhile."
"Overall, a very impressive IPA. A very well-balanced brew that leans to the citrus as opposed to the pine. A very drinkable beer that is smooth and tasty. Thanks again, Ryan!"
"i was glad to find this one last bottle, and to find that it's as good as the 'fresher' bottles from a month+ ago."
"This was an enjoyable IPA, which is hard for me to say. I don't usually like IPA's, and what I do like are few and very far between, but this one i would have again. On top of that I would have another one right now even."
"People talk about the great balance this IPA achieves and this is true but not just for the malt-hop balance (which is good), the real balance it finds is the balance within the hops themselves. It fits in nicely between the Stone IPA (harsh, sharp hops, huge bite) and the Racer 5 (real soft, citrus, lack of bite). Both good IPAs, but both lacking what the other has. The Ballast Point beer does it well."
"An update: It rocks. Still. Just as fresh and mind-blowingly delicious as the first time I had it. So crisp from the hop bite, and so piney and citrusy. Love this IPA."
"D: Very glad to have (finally) tried this one...its reputation is well deserved. Though my scores aren't as 'exceptional' as some from my fellow reviewers, that should NOT confuse the fact that this *is* a terrific brew - worth tracking down, or...uh... 'catching'. Thanks again, Jim."
"Was excitied to see this when I picked it up @ Whole Foods, for $9.99. Pours a bright glowing orange/light amber color with a frosty/foamy white head that leaves a swiss cheese lacing. The smell is great, citrus notes stand out of grapefruit, but probably more on the tangerine side, piney, spicey herbs also come through, very nice. The taste is also very citrus-y with a complex hoppy bitterness taste, some caramel sweetness in the finish, with a lingering hop finish. Not a heavy IPA, easy drinking, well rounded, what I look for a great IPA, not too malty, just enough malt to keep the hops balanced, love the citrus in this one. Hardly can detect the alcohol. Wish this was available year round in a 6-pack!!"
"D:Extremely drinkable the 7% ABV is well hidden and would be the perfect drink any day of the year."
"Served in a pint glass with a 3/4"" fluffy white head and an orange hued, slightly hazy body. The smell is amazing! There was a ton of citrus and pine from the hops as well as a slight hint of other fruits such as pineapple. The taste is very clean and well-balanced which is perfect for an IPA. The citrus and pine hop notes were incredible and the malt and sweetness balanced out the bitterness. There is a lot going on with all the different tastes but it all works together beautifully. The mouthfeel was creamy and silky with a slight tang from the hops. Not too much bitterness. The drinkability is high on this one for all the right reasons. I found myself not wanting to finish it but had a hard time putting the glass down. I am glad this one is here in Pittsburgh and will be looking for it more often."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just above average for the style. I would have liked a little more sweetness. Overall, I liked this beer, I just don't see how it is the top ranked IPA in America. IMHO, there are many better. That being said, I did enjoy this beer, I just didn't find anything that really stood out, solid, just not outstanding. Skal."
"Tastes is, again, mango with pine edges. Some orange liquor in there as well. Not as bitter as I would have imagined: just a lumpy, timid bitter in back. I would have liked more please. Thin,but appropriate, light malt launch pad."
"d- drink it all day, all hops/ no malt..true west coast ipa."
"D: Another fantastic brew from Ballast Point, they really did a nice job making this distinctive of Big Eye. Still, I have to say for all the hype associated with this brew, Big Eye is basically on par (I gave it a 4.4). A great beer, well deserving of accolades and one every beer lover should try if they get the chance. Special thanks again to Abe's Cold beer for being such a great supplier of hard ot find brews!"
" Leaves an great bitter taste on your tongue after a few seconds, which only makes you crave for an other taste. love it!"
"Pretty ridiculous price for a single IPA but it just feels great to drink, a bomber is no problem whatsoever. Definitely a favorite IPA of mine, deserves the reputation it has."
"Amazing IPA. Golden Orange body with an antique white head. Great lacing leaving thick rocky sheets around the edges of the pint. Smell is heavenly: so much citrus and even moderate pine notes. Big juicy ripe pink grapefruit, pineapple slices, vanilla cake batter and tangerine wedges. Very similar in the taste with a sharp pineapple cake flavor, fresh citrus salad (sweet lemon, mandarin oranges and pink grapefruit). Pine in the background, amazing mouthfeel, unlike any mouthfeel I've every experienced before in this style. Bubbles are ample but not sharp, silky and sudsy coating everything. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable, I will be a happy camper when I move to the San Diego area this year."
"A great beer that I could easily sit and drink most of the night. Bitter, but not to the point of insanity, just the perfect backdrop for showing off the hoppy flavor."
"In summary, very good stuff, just not the most balanced IPA ever to me. Like the crisp, strong hops, but I want more pine and caramel."
"My first from Ballast Point and it was no let down. What a wonderful IPA all around."
"D: wish it was local. I'd drink a lot more!!"
"Cheers!"
"A great brew. Would work well with lemon pepper chicken. This is one that is best enjoyed nice and fresh. If you see it, grab and enjoy."
"M&D - you need to be a hophead to enjoy this, not because its huge on the hops, but that its only characteristic is a superb hop profile, maybe this one sat too long, (only a week in my cabinet) as a pervious reviewer mentions, the supreme quality of this brew is its linger-osity, you can feel/taste the hops for minutes after each sip"
"Drinkability: An outstanding IPA. Plenty of hop character and complexity, great appearance and mouthfeel, and top notch drinkability. This is a beer I will absolutely look forward to enjoying again. I am regretting only picking up one bottle."
"Overall, this is one of the best regular IPA's I have ever had. I would probably still put Alesmith's IPA in front of this, but the Sculpin is a close second. If I see any more bottles of this next time I'm at Julio's I'll definitely pick some up."
"To be honest, at the first few tastes I didn't think much of this brew. Half a glass down, I was starting to enjoy it. Near the end, I was looking forward to topping it off again. It'd be nice to try this one either fresh or let it sit for awhile. Looking forward to my other Ballast Point acquisitions."
"CHEERS!!"
"This beer pours a clear golden copper with a huge white frothy head that leaves great lacing and lasts forever. The smell is a very good and strong aroma of citrus hops,grapefruit,and tangerine. The taste has a bitter first taste,then citrus blast of grapefruit and tangerine. The taste is very crisp with bread yeast and alcohol and a smooth finish. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. A great beer."
"Recommended to try, but nothing spectacular like I thought it would be."
"Full and rich mouthfeel, creamy with tingly carbonation. Great beer, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This beer is so drinkable that I finished it off in about half the time I would normally take with an IPA of the strength of this one. There is not even a trace of harshness in the hop bitterness. I definitely want another one and expect I'll do so without hesitation next time I have a chance. This IPA is now in my top few for the style and I'd love to be able to do a side-by-side tasting with this one, Bell's Two Hearted, and Founders Centennial."
"Pours yellow-orange with a small white head. The beer is very clear. The aroma is strong citrus hops, lots of peach and mango. Very nice smelling beer. There is good bitterness and hop flavor, with lots of pine and citrus. The pine is mainly evident in the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. Outstanding beer."
"D- High. I can see what all the fuss is about. This is some top-notch shit. It's pricey (at least here in RI, about $10 a bomber), but I can see myself buying this again...and again.... and again. Another stellar Cali IPA. Everything I thought it could be and perhaps more."
"Overall this was an exceptional west coast American IPA that pretty much lives up to its hype. I'm glad that I have another in the fridge from another trade and look forward to drinking it soon. Thanks again Jared! Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not too sweet or syrupy. Gentle carbonation that is spot on. Good drinkability, but the bitterness is pretty intense for a standard IPA. It really wrecks the mouth after 22oz. Not that I wouldn't welcome the challenge."
"Overall a great beer worthy of the praise and hype."
"Overall: I've had so many good IPAs, and Sculpin has to be #1 on my list! The smell and taste will make you want to smack you mother! Buy it if you ever have the opportunity."
"Drinkability for this beer is very good, it goes down so smooth and just tastes great. Really a definitive IPA and this is one of the top rated IPA's I had tried."
"Big thanks to jyoungsbcp for this rare gem!"
"D: Nicely blended, goes down easily, highly drinkable - I could sit with this one all night!"
"Goes down pretty smooth and easy to drink."
"My go-to IPAs are Pliny and this guy (at least until I have more trouble finding it). If I'm looking for something more citrusy, refreshing I usually go with this guy. But if forced to pick one for the rest of my life, I'd go with Pliny."
"This is hands down, my favorite American IPA. Completely different from anything I've had before and so well balanced for having such a fruity base. I haven't often been so impressed."
"Mouthfeel is a light medium and allows me to gulp this wonderful beer."
"D- Highly drinkable, great bite with that West coast IPA style through out this beer."
"D: If it weren't for the $10/bomber price tag and difficulty in finding this beer, I would drink this all the time."
"D - Absolutely. One of the best standard IPAs I've had. Unfortunately this beer is prohibitively expensive, so it is one and done for me. The taste is great, and the alcohol is completely hidden. I'd drink it again for sure."
"D- This is one of the best IPAs I have ever had. The taste is amazing and the smell really sets it in a league of its own. All around a great brew and I could drink this all night."
"This is a beer certainly worth a try."
"overall - this is a beer is very hyped and i can see why - but taste is all personal preference and i have had better"
"D: An easy drinker with good overall enjoyment levels. This isn't even close to my favorite IPAs like Commodore Perry, Centennial IPA, Two Hearted, etc, but it's solid and unoffensive. I'm surprised at all the A's, but for a west coast single IPA it's quite good."
"Mouthfeel is on the light side with good carbonation and a bit of crispness. This is the epitome of easy drinking for an IPA and super smooth and tasty. A bomber disappears like nothing and leaves me wishing I had more. Just a killer IPA that deserves the praises it has received."
"D - Pretty high. This is a great IPA, maybe not quite the hop profile of Pliny the Elder but still very complex with plenty of hops character to analyze. This beer begs to be served on cask - something Ballast has never done to my knowledge. Good example of a San Diego IPA, but not nearly as stunning as a Green Flash West Coast or other HYPER hopped beers. This is certainly Ballast Points most loved beer and with good reason. I'd also recommend the Dorado Double - which has a more defined hop character."
"D- This bomber went down ridiculously quick! This brew has it all; looks great, smells great, tastes great and feels great! A hophead must try."
"much more orangey than i remember, almost sunny-d like. clean though, with a thoroughly herbaceous hop blast that finishes with only a slight bit of lingering citrus oil. the body of the beer itself is light yet buoyant, crisp yet not overcarbonated. i could drink this stuff all night, but i would eventually grow used to the bold up front flavor. agree with the good ratings on this one, easily double fucking good."
"Drinkability is great for a stronger hop bomb. Sure it wrecks a little havok on the pallate, but it doesn't leave me dried out or over-stimulated. I loved this world class beer!"
"D: This beer is a great easy drinking IPA. I would love to drink this more often but due to its limited availabilty that might not be possible. Overall a very solid IPA that stands up to all the hype."
"I had this on tap today at Capone's. It is a pale, golden honey yellow with a sticky white head. The smell is rich with copious amounts of citrus and tropical fruits. The flavor follows, sweet citrus, mango, guava. Sculpin has enough malt for balance, leaving a crisp finish. It taste like a DIPA with the drinkability of an IPA. The beer lives up to the hype."
"D - This is an amazing IPA. It has all the complexity and depth of an Imperial IPA without an over the top alcohol presence."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a hazed apricot orange color with a fluffy 2 finger head that leaves some clingy lace on the glass. This is a rather fruitful IPA to me with notes of mango, pineapple, and orange along with a citris rind hop bitterness. Starts of subltey sweet with the tropical fruit notes which is then accompanied by a building citris rind bitterness that lingers all well after your drink is finished. Some warming alcohol notes on the back end. Overall, just a wonderful IPA and in my top 5. Medium mouthfeel."
"This beer is massively different with age. Don't be one of those fools who says it changed or whatnot. Go drink it on tap, fresh. You'll then see. . ."
"D: What a great beer. I understand what the hype is about. Well deserved."
"-very good. would never mind drinking this. not sure about top 12 though, but thats fine"
"Drinkability: Well-rounded IPA, would definitely drink this IPA again!"
"D: This beer is so tart, so citrusy, and so bitter. There is nothign that I don't absolutely love. This is my favorite beer and I will always actively seek this beer out. Cheers to Ballast Point and this world class brew!!!"
"Exceptional offering! Alot of flavors, however very distinguished. Wishing for year-round availability."
"D- This is an amazing beer that I was more than happy to take a sip or two of. This beer is worth the hype and I can only hope to nail another one of these tasty gems."
"Mouthfeel is nice and full, but I don't think I could handle much more than one of these brews at a sitting despite the nice flavors."
"Anyone who enjoys IPAs owe this one a try. Certainly right up there among the better ones in this style."
"12/18/2011 update. Revisiting this review now that I see this around more often. Still a excellent beer, but it doesn't blow me away like it did 2 years ago anymore. Updated from A:4.5, S:5, T:5, M:4.5, O:4.5."
"It's very drinkable at 7%. Why did I only get one?"
"Is it the best IPA in the world? Maybe. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it."
"The best IPA in the world right now? Probably."
"D- @ 7% I could have 3 bombers in one night easy. This stuff is gold and I may end up buying a case. Everything I thought it would be and more."
"D-I love the taste of hop and bitter hop, I could drink a million! this just became one of my favorites of all time!"
"D - Did someone say drinkability? Wow...I can't say anything more than what has already been said...I was super excited to finally try this beer and now I'm disappointed not having it all the time...Sculpin showed me why it is in the top 20 on this website...it's easily the best IPA I've had to this day"
"D: Very drinkable, a bomber is the serving of choice. Just enough to drink at your own pace, while pouring just enough to bring back the sticky head. This ale as it warms reveals a little heat and some malt, flavors hidden by carbonation and hops."
"Recommended..."
"In my opinion, this one is among Alesmith IPA, Blind Pig, Hop Rod Rye, Stone IPA and Two Hearted for best in class."
"Drinkability: very refreshing and easy to drink (even though its a bigger beer)."
"Medium body good connectiveness in the flavors, hits all the centers on the palate, drinkability high."
"Poured a nice yellowish orange color with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is pine, grapefruit and other citrus, perhaps ornage, apricot. Taste is huge citrus and pine , sweet and nice bittering. Mouthfeel slight alcohol more citrus, pine and hops. Drinkability is phenom!"
"This is an insanely drinkable IPA. The smell & taste are complex & the mouthfeel is pleasant."
"Smell really reminded me of Alpine Nelson which is one of the more unique IPAs out there and something I enjoyed. Without the Rye of course..."
"The moutfheel is great with a rewarding lasting finish and the drinkabiltiy is great."
"Damn good drinkability. Great flavor and the abv isn't too high either, making this a good choice for more than just one round."
"D - I'd take another!"
"Sculpin is actually very smooth drinking and not as crisp as I originally thought it would be by looks alone. Light-bodied and moderately carbonated, it has a nice silky and oily feel on the mouth with some bubbly presence. The drinkability is amazing, I can definitely have a whole bomber to myself. My first glass was finished in a span of ten minutes - too delicious to let be alone - and giving me quite a nice buzz. A perfect IPA overall."
"D: A very drinkable IPA due to the lightness of it. Extremely tasty with a most unique hop bill that results in little of the pine found in a lot of IPA's and all of the tropical fruits."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and the beer has a nice medium body. The hops dry out the flavors and leave a nice citrusy aftertaste that leaves me craving more. This is in the class of Vortex I and Pliny the Elder for me, just a fantastic beer in my favorite style."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"Really tasty and dangerously drinkable. This is my idea of a perfect American IPA."
"I loved this beer from bottle, I love it from tap. Just a top notch citrus west coast style IPA that has no rivals in my opinion. What else can I say? Awesome."
"The second bottle heading to you Hooliganlife."
"D-This is my kind of IPA...reminds me of my personal favorite IPA O'Dell. I still give my top vote to O'Dell but this is a worthy contender for the crown. Top notch and if you like a big juicy citrus laden IPA this is for you."
"D - Oh yeah. Bring this IPA again and again and again. It's not too heavy, not too light. It drinks so easily."
"D- Very easy to drink. One of the best smelling IPAs out there. at 8.99 a bomber for an IPA it's definitely a once in a while thing."
"This poured a nearly clear light gold with a little bit of white head. It smelled like juicy peaches and pineapples and fresh lemon, with some sweet mango and light honey. It tasted like grapefruit and pineapple with some peach and mango, and a bit of tea leaves and honey. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a clean bitter aftertaste. Overall this is definitely one of the best IPAs out there. Delicious tropical hops flavors that few other beers can match. There was an herbal hops character in the aftertaste that was reminiscent of Ruination, which I wasn't a huge fan of, and I thought it could have used a hint more body. So there is honestly some room for improvement. But this was still a fantastic beer that was very easy to drink but also a delight to sip. This lived up to the hype."
"Overall, my impression of Sculpin IPA was a very good one, although I think that its rating hyped it up a little too much. Having had both Ballast Point's Sculpin and Alpine Beer Co.'s Nelson side by side, I can easily say that Nelson, for me, is far more enjoyable because of its superior aroma (both the scent and the amount of smell that is perceived) and taste."
"Honestly, one hell of a brew. Looking forward to it becoming a year-round release."
"This is clearly not a session beer, but for the inviting smell, satisfyingly complimentary taste, and re-inviting mouthfeel, it surely gets an ole' thumbs up on the drinkability meter."
"Drinkability: I would drink this regularly if I could. The last time I had it was in San Diego a couple years ago and I think it's better now than it was then. A little more complex than I remember and definitely worth seeking out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a slightly hazy pale honey color with a puffy pure white head that settles into a light cap. The aroma is of a beautiful fresh hop. Nice floral hop aroma with tropical fruit. Smells as if somebody just squeezed some hop juice in this sucker. Big fresh hop flavor with a blend of grapefruit and orange, floral, a touch of asprin in the end. Very nice hop flavor profile without any of the over the top bitterness or sweet malt. Moderate body with enough carbonation to help offset the hop flavor, thus more drinkable. Finishes only slightly bitter, which is surprising with the amount of hop flavor. This is one mighty fine AIPA. Drinks very easy for a brew with such a hop forward profile. Dang tasty."
"D: An IPA that tastes like an Imperial IPA. This is a purer 90 minute with all the best of that beer without the chaff."
"D: Well now, this is one of the best AIPA's I've had in a long time and I do believe it is worth every iota of hype it brings to the table. Seek.This. Out."
"D - Medium carbonation lends itself to multiple bottles if only a PA beer geek could procure multiple bottles. Overall... WOW. Lose sleep over this one."
"Notes: A really good IPA from a brewery that is money. I could have used a little more malt in this one to balance out the bitterness. Not too filling and a good ipa. A little pricey at $96 for a case of 12 x 22 oz bottles."
"Nearly impossible to put down, this is the most drinkable IPA I've ever had. I real stunner on cask..."
"Drinkability has me thinking. Definitely feel the 7%, as well as the very bitter taste. However the smooth texture is bringing me back. I have another bottle, not sure if I will hold on to it and see how it changes or pass it on."
"D - Great, it is so smooth you can drink several pints. However, I am disappointed that the taste did not replicate the smell."
"This is a good/great IPA, and something to be tried if available. Don't lose sleep if you can't find it however."
"D-Great IPA I could continue drinking this all day long."
"The flavor of Sculpin is aggressively bitter, but in a way that still maintains a high degree of hop flavor. Pine wood, resinous greenery, and citrus all make for a delectable bouquet of an IPA. The malts show up just long enough to provide a balance of sweetness and body, but not much flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, with a medium body that, while rugged on the palate, is smooth at the same time. Great IPA, but I honestly liked Sculpin's Big Eye IPA better..."
"Drinkability is sky high. What else can be said."
"There were two choices at the Daily Pint in Santa Monica... for now. Sculpin IPA and Sculpin IPA cask (very rare). The Cask is the one I will write about know. It has a very hazy orange glow in the glass. The head is like a high school cheerleader (very bubbly), and boy does it last a long time, also served a little warmer. I tried to get the owner to tell me what kind of hops they use but he said he could tell me but he would have to kill me. All I know is there are 5 different kind of hops in this beverage and taste/smell is very citrusy. Long live the cask!"
"Drinkability - Very much so. I wish they had this closer to where I live. I would add this to my ""weekly arsenal"" especially since they are suppose to start brewing this year round (so the rumors go). I was not disappointed with this and can't wait to get some more!"
"Overall: Can't believe the sweet citrus smell. I'd like to know their secrets. Only beer that I can remember that had this much was Dreadnaught from Three Floyds. I can't imagine a better beer to be drinking watching a San Diego sunset. (must add to to-do list)."
"If this beer was in 6-pack I'd reach for it in my fridge day after day."
"Finish is grapefruit skin and lemon oil that goes to pine and resin."
"Very tasty and high quality, I can only hope this one will remain available locally for a while."
"Overall a good IPA. Nothing to really fault it for but my tastes lean more in the Blind Pig direction."
"One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Not to be missed."
"While this beer is very, very good, it is short of greatness because of this odd astringency that is pervasive through the whole drinking experience. That being said this is one very drinkable beer of which I could have many."
"Final thoughts: Wow, it was just as I anticipated. A crazy hop bomb with little malts, lots of pine, citrus, juicy fruit hops, some spice, and lots of greatness. The thing that did surprise me was the slight minty mouthwash feel. If this wasn't so limited and expensive I'd really use it as mouthwash and it would be so great!"
"On its own, I would prefer a tad more sweetness to balance the bitterness but when I started eating some spicy panang curry it seemed perfect. This is a seriously good beer."
"This honestly has to be one of the best beers I've ever had in my life, hands down. Big thanks go out to Ian and Adam for sending me this beast of a beer. Thanks a ton!"
"Poured a beautiful orange that was clear through with one finger of white head with great retention and just beautiful lacing. The smell was a lot of sweet candied grapefruit, pineapple, mango and some pine. The taste was a very good balance of sweetness and bitterness with a good aftertaste. There was a lot more hops in the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, nice and creamy, with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability was good, well worth the $6 plus tip I payed."
"Poured a cllear amber with a thin white head. Strong citrus hop aroma, not much else going on in this one for aroma. Up front citrus hop flavor with peach, mango, and oranges in the background. Finishes bitter, kind of on the thin side even for this style. Very easy to drink, love the mango in this one."
"Massive tropical fruit aroma with pineapple in the lead followed by mango, passion fruit, guava, apple, and lemon. This is a fresh bottle as the hop profile is very pronounced with a nice tropical fruit complexity along with grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Overall an excellent IPA and one of my favorites."
"D - at 7.0% abv, this beer hits the nail on the head for drinkabilty. It masks the alcohol, it is something you want to keep drinking, and it does not have a bad aftertaste. I think this is almost as perfect of a drinkable IPA that I can think of."
"Another perfect example of a beer living up to the hype. The hop aroma and flavor are ridiculously fresh. Just enough malt is present to balance things out quite nicely. The mouth is probably the best part. Smooth crisp and refreshing. Excellent beer, highly recommended."
"A terrific IPA. Glad it makes it out to Philly every now and then."
"D- I could drink this all day every day. A finely crafted brew to say the very least."
"Overall- Very juicy and very drinkable. Smooth drinking IPA. Hopefully the hype dies down on this 1 so its more available."
"Drinkable, indeed."
"I could drink this everyday... I envy those who can get this regularly as it would be my standby IPA...I have one more bottle left that I will be opening on Wednesday, my birthday, and I'm already looking forward to it... Delicious..."
"This is a great IPA and it surpassed the other Ballast Point's I have tried in the past. Its hope profile seemed to exceed a number of imperial IPA's that I have tried. Now if only it were actually available to buy."
"Serving Type: 22oz. Bottle"
"A phenomenal IPA. Sculpin pours a relatively pale shade of golden amber with a creamy white head. The aroma is very hoppy with notes of peach, grapefruit and wildflowers. The smell is quite intense for the size of the beer. The flavor is dry and hoppy. I particularly like a good dry IPA. The hops are different, but it reminds me of Pliny the Elder in that respect. I was inspired to try them side by side and they're quite similar beers, both magnificent. Sculpin is clean and strong. The mouthfeel is quite dry with lots of pleasant bitterness and no alcohol. Sculpin is one of the finest beers that I've ever tasted and probably my favorite IPA thus far. It's great stuff and it's a shame that it's not more readily available."
"D: Very drinkable. This is where it might have helped that the hop bill wasn't too strong in the taste. Good brew all around, and I'm looking forward to trying it again."
"Easily and dangerously drinkable. Could definitely use a few more, if I can get my hands on them."
"An excellent IPA, i absolutely love the combo of hops used here to produce a very unique peach, orange and mango aroma and flavor. Nice clean finish produces a beer that has huge hops flavor without being overall sweet, increasing the drinkability even more."
"Hands down one of the best IPA's I've had the pleasure of trying. Drink this one as fresh as you can get it! I just wish it was easier to obtain, or it'd be in my regular rotation. Note: After writing this review, I read the description on the bottle. I noticed quite a few similarities to what i wrote above. Maybe I actually know what I'm talking about???"
"D- Very good flavor. Very good beer."
"Good thing cbutova is on the look out 24/7. Pours a hazy gold that clears over time. Nice thick head that has some fight in it, lacing is moderate, carbonation fueled the head immediately and is not visible in the body. Smell is phenomenal: lemon, mango, orange, apricot. This has got to be the best smelling beer I've come across. The taste follows the nose quite strictly. The hop explosion it produces is amazing. I could use a little bit more of the fruit from the nose but then again that might cause an imbalance so this is a tough call. It's an extremely well balanced beer, a little on the hoppier side of the IPA style. The mouthfeel is nice and full (for an IPA), with a dry finish that leaves you salivating and thirsty for more. This beer has exceeded my expectations of what an IPA can be. Ballast Point wins with this one."
"The elusive Sculpin has been caught. I would have saved this for #100 but it's an IPA and I wanted to drink it as fresh as possible. Grabbed this one at Table and Vine in W. Springfield today, they had 3 cases, I snagged the last two on the shelf (maybe more in the back). Pours a very golden color with a hint of orange, has a very bubbly two finger head that retains very well for an IPA, the carbonation on the pour is extreme, pour it carefully. Thick lacing is left on my pint glass as I drink this bad boy. Smell here is probably the best beer smell I have ever put my hands on. So much great things going on, a huge fruity aspect to the beer (mangos, peach, apricot, lemon), the sweeter fruits perfectly balanced by floral and piney hops, greatness. Taste is a bit different than the smell, less of a fruit characteristic but still enough to be very noticeable, a huge aggressive hop blast comes onto the tongue but backs off as you swallow to allow a very good sweet fruity taste to come through with an eventual delicious hop after taste. A very complex smelling and tasting beer. Mouthfeel is very well carbonated, medium bodied and a bit oily, maybe a TINY bit of alcohol warming but no alcohol taste = a very well balanced mouthfeel, I hate to give all 5s but its starting to look that way. Drinkability is great, the taste is enough for me to drink this all day long, its not filling, the price ($10) was worth it any day of the week, no bad flavors to ruin this one over time, and I would buy this one again over and over and over."
"The taste is even better than the smell. Pure hoppiness goodness. It is incredible even with all the grapefruit hop going on it's not overwhelmingly bitter. This is beer is very well balanced and god damn delicious. There is mild carbonation here, and the beer surprisingly unsyrupy and with the 7% this beer is dangerously drinkable!"
"Drinkability: With out a doubt I would have this again and is definitely worth a try."
"I can drink Sculpin like it's water, which is bittersweet, because this is my only bottle. It's a nice, creamy drinker. I'd put the body right near medium, with a nice little tingle from the carbonation. Just a delicious beer. One of the best I've ever had, no question. Definitely keeping it on the Wants list."
"overall impression- solid effort, medium-weight ipa...easy drinker, interesting sweet and sour balance, a little leaner than i'm used to tasting in a 7% ipa"
"I must indulge myself here and compare this to Two Hearted Ale. Bell's Two Hearted is my favorite beer. By the time I finish my second of two bombers of Sculpin my mind may be changed. Sculpin is much less floral than Two Hearted, but much more pronounced in fruit characteristics. Also, if you've read my Two Hearted review then you know that I love Two Hearted so much partly because of its odd artwork. I have lovingly nicknamed it ""Fish Beer."" Well, Sculpin is named after a fish and features the sculpin fish on its label. So this is also ""Fish Beer."" Maybe this will end up tying Two Hearted as my favorite beer. That I spent a paragraph comparing Ballast Point Sculpin to my favorite beer -- asserting that it might be my new favorite -- is proof enough for me that this beer is brilliant and rightfully deserving of its accolades."
"Immensely drinkable. I would love for this to be available in 6'ers. Can't stop smelling this liquid crack. The world needs more single IPA's with this much flavor. Although, I don't find myself drinking this very often due to the inflated pricetag."
"Poured from my 22 into my awaiting tulip. Pours a bright, clear golden color with a nice full white head. Smells exceptional. Buckets and buckets of juicy tropical, citrus, hops hit my nose like a ton of bricks. I could smell this thing as soon as I cracked the bottle. I'm picking up a hint of sweet pale malt lingering in background. Taste almost of good as it smells. Again lots of citrus flavors oranges, lemon, and I'm thinking a touch of pineapple as well. Hops are amazing. Not really much balance here but who cares!!! There's an intense blast of bitterness at end. Good mouthfeel and nice carbonation. This stuff is crazy drinkable I can't get enough."
"He can swim like this all of the night, few cares in the world, the love of many, enjoyed by few. Here's to the night."
"I have to rate the Sculpin I had, not the Sculpin I wish I could have had."
"D - Very high. I couldn't get enough of this stuff."
"D: One of the easiest drinking and most well rounded IPAs I've had...ever. An absolutely amazing beer."
"D) overall a very drinkable and delicious IPA. i would definitely drink another one when the time comes."
"I have been hearing about Sculpin for a long time and was thrilled to have it. A great, great IPA and a beer I wish I could have to drink all day"
"This is the best single IPA I have ever tasted. Truly superb. Will have to try Dorado next."
"Picked up a bomber of this today and was more certain of it's freshness than my previous review. Most everything is similar but everything pops a bit more, like the volume on the aroma and taste and feel were all turned up a couple of notches. The beer is also much prettier in natural light versus the dim light of a bar."
"D: Probably right past the edge of what is deemed sessionable, it is very easy to put back a few pints of this no problem. A beer that I would definitely want to try again. Just flavor all around."
"A little more of a slick mouthfeel than I was expecting, but still very acceptable. Perfect drinkability and delicious, what more could you want in an IPA? If I found this at a bar, I don't think I would leave until the keg was tapped."
"Drinkability. This is a great IPA. On par with PtE."
"I am usually quite skeptical of IPA's, expecting them to all be the same. However, Sculpin seems to have better balance than most other IPA's. A perfect beer for any summer night. Glad I got to try this one, Chris!"
"Ultra refreshing. Some simco adds a nice and unoverwhelming dry grapefruit. Very light, some lemon, grapefruit and some grassy flavors. Very like mango and apricot flavors. Well done!"
"D - This is a very rich and flavorful beer. Goes down fairly smooth...especially for a 7% beer. Alcohol really doesn't play a factor here from a feel standpoint, but might catch up with me if I had a couple. The odd, off flavor reduces the overall drinkability for me, but still not bad - not quite sessionable though."
"Once again this is not a balanced IPA so purists might hate on it a little. If you're a fan of West Coast IPA's get it for sure. It's my favorite IPA and I managed to even rank it the highest at a blind IPA tasting night, speaks for itself."
"D - I could drink this one over and over again. I just wish I had a better supply."
"(Edit (2011): I guess they listened to me! Just picked up a year-round 6-pack for my dad!)"
"at first thought it was gonna be light because of color . cant really taste the hops, really smooth but fruity at the same tikme. no matter what i say to me it was a good IPA cant wait to have again on Friday when the liquor store gets it back in stock. so good. must buy . just basically a really good ipa different doesn't seem to follow that same trend of just hops, really balanced out."
"Drinkability: Fantastic for a brew with so much hop goodness."
"I also had this on tap at the Khyber, and it was even smoother then. Give it a try."
"D: When I first popped this bottle and started drinking this beer, I was more than a bit disappointed. For all the hype that surrounds this beer, I found it to be lacking in both aroma and flavor. However, as the beer warmed, it began to show a lot more character, with more pine and citrus showing though. Apparently, it's character is in subtlety. This is a balanced beer that resides on the lighter side for an IPA. . While this beer did regain some respect, this was not the exceptional beer I was expecting."
"D: Very drinkable. I'll finish this bomber and wish I had more. Then again, there's a Dorado Double IPA in the fridge..."
"I drove 1.5 hours for this and it was well worth it. Thanks Verdugo!"
"Poured a light pale gold. Looks like its going to be a really weak drink. Body seemed thin to appearance. Very thin white creamy head. Smell was dank. Really strong pine that didnt seem to match its appearance. Smell now makes you think this beer is going to rip you a new one. Taste was citrus, with a little grapefruit. Didnt really get hops out of this. Body is thin in the mouth but full of flavor. Finish is little malty that leaves you wanting more. What a roller coaster this beer was!!! I will definatly be on the lookout to get more of this. This a must try for BA'ers"
"It's a tad light bodied, but that makes it all the more drinkable. This is amazing stuff and more than lives up to any hype. I only wish there wasn't a 2 bottle limit where I purchased this because I should have a fridge full of this at all times. Bully Ballast Point! Bully!"
"Enjoying this thanks to JoeySchlitz. Pours clear gold with a white tan head. Smells and tastes of grapefruit and more grapefruit. But the flavor is fairly well balanced with malts. So not a hop bomb. Body is medium thickness, as is carbonation. Fairly drinkable for an IPA. Good, but not memorable. Not sure how this is so high in the BA stratosphere."
"poured a clear gold with orange highlights, last bit cloudy but no big sediment. white diminishing head. aroma is tropical fruit, citrus, and honeyed floral notes. nice sweet bready malts are cleared out by the big smooth hop bitterness. smells and tastes like a dipa but a bit lighter in body. frothy, prickly mouthfeel with a smooth bitter drying finish. very nice overall."
"Overall, not your typical hop-bomb...which is nice. Good brew that is drinkable and refreshing. More balanced than many IPAs."
"I love mango and I got my fill from this amazing beer. I was able to get my hands on two bombers, but they didn't last long at all. If this beer wasn't a limited release it would be in my fridge at all times."
"This is one of the beers that lives up to it's reputation and deserves to be brought up when the ""best IPA"" conversation comes up. I wish it was more accessable to me but I definitely won't pass up the chance to stock up whenever I get the chance. Well done."
"*i don't care what anyone says, it still doesn't overtake my love for Blind Pig!*"
"D- A very solid brew for sure. Easy to drink and great balance."
"A finger of bone-white head with decent retention. Nose was uniquely fruity - mango, apricot, peach, orange zest. Seven or eight different hops varieties, depending on the batch, four kinds of malt and a Cali yeast strain combine to create the Tropical IPA flavor that trips my trigger each and every time. Coarse filtration to remove the dry-hopping solids resulted in a deep golden-yellow color with NE-quality clarity. BTW, Cuz Colby was forthcoming with some info and asked that his assistance be recognized. Mouthfeel was medium with a uniquely tart/fruity flavor that reminded me of popping an entire roll of Tropical Friut Life Savers (papaya, mango, apricot, peach) in my mouth. The finish was dry, orangish, yummy. Try some today!"
"Said it before, and will say it again: This is the BEST west coast IPA, in my opinion."
"Overall, this is a very impressive ipa. Easy drinking and a ton of great fruit flavors. One of my favorite ipas. If I can get more fresh, I probably will. I can see why it is one of the top IPAs."
"The mouth is crisp and wonderfully bubbly. Excellent for gulping. Flavor is big citrusy notes with some bitter grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangy lemons. Finishes bitter and a bit on the drying side. There's some sweet notes in there that balance this out well. The alcohol is pretty well hidden but makes itself known near the end of the bottle. Oh yes. I could drink this all night. This isn't as bold and in your face as I was expecting. This is just an unbelievably good IPA. Freaking highly recommend."
"Honestly IPAs are not really high up on my personal fave list but I've had many that are way better than this. I think my expectations were a bit too high here or the hype machine on this was just a bit too out of control. Either way it is something that I wouldn't necessarily want to buy again."
"Pours a very pale straw color - nice and clear. Kind of a light orange. With a vigorous pour, you get quite a head, a less vigorous pour will yield a nice dense little pad of carbonation. It leaves just a bit of lacing, and has decent retention. A little lighter than I'd expect, but very nice looking. Upfront, the nose is very leafy and grassy. Just like fresh hops. But then you start to smell some grapefruit, some peach and mango, a little lemon, then just pure powdery, polleny resins. A brilliant hop profile. If you can smell any malt, it's light and powdery. The taste follows suit pretty well. Comes up with some sticky, resinous hops at first. You move from grassy and floral, kind of herbal, actually very herbal for a moment, then to a bit of citrus, then really leafy and resinous in the finish. Nice hop profile. The malt is a little sticky, but overall, this is a very dry beer. There isn't much breadiness, but there is a slight crackery taste. The malt profile is a bit tough to judge when this one is fresh, but I kind of like it like that. Very nice body. About medium, with the perfect level of dryness. Not quite puckering, but definitely no sweetness to block out the hops. Pretty good. A bit thinner than a really great IPA though, and it's a little sticky feeling. It actually was kind of slow starting, I just wanted to relax and savor every little sip, and I really did. I loved it. Overall, one of the best IPAs out there. It almost borders on DIPA, but its still a bit different. A great beer, and if you can find it, but it immediately."
"Bottle Pours a clear golden with a frothy white head. The head lasts well and produces spotty lacing. Has a good hoppy aroma of spruce, citrus, peaches, and some bread. Has a good carbonation. The flavor is real good. Mild bitterness, with good hoppy kick. Real smooth mouthfeel. Blended very well. Has a medium body. The texture is a touch oily. Has a good solid finish with an excellent aftertaste. I waited for this one for a while. Too bad the store only sold one to a customer"
"Shared a bomber at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $14. Totally worth it. This is easily one of the best IPA's I've had in sometime. Reminds me in terms of quality of the pint of Town Hall Masala Mama I had last week. The hops jump out of the glass once the beer is poured - I love when that happens. The hops are a mix of spicy citrus that are juicy, but dry and drinkable. There are also tasty notes of apricot, white grape, and orange peel.The aftertaste just doesn't go away. I had to go out of my way to find an even bigger beer to follow this up, otherwise this beer would have still been hanging on my palate."
"Pours a rather pale orange color, with a huge two finger, white head. Just some stray carbonation in the brew; excellent clarity. Heads sticks around a while, and leaves a little lacing. Great work on the aroma hop additions, as this may be one of the most delicious smelling IPAs. There must be some combination of Cascade, Amarillo, Simcoe and the like, as it is an excellent citrus hop aroma (my personal favorite). There is a mix of sweet mango and tart grapefruit, I just love it. Taste is not as pronounced as the aroma, but is certainly an excellent IPA. A slightly more earthy hop flavor is in the taste, but still retains the citrus characteristics I love. Near perfectly balanced, as the hop flavor is there, prominent, without being overwhelming. Light and crisp in your mouth, and just a little hop slickness left in your mouth after a sip. The balanced hop profile makes this quite an easy sipper, no rough edges at all. I love some ""hop bombs," and this IPA certainly has hops, but you have to appreciate the balance coming from a beer with this amount of hop aroma and flavor."
"D: This is a great IPA with a massive and very tasty hop profile. Still, it manages to stay very balanced. The malts are almost perfectly suited for the hop centered flavors."
"Drinkability: It's been said, but I can drink this all day, no problem. Such an awesome beer, comes highly recommended, and I'm going to spring for 2-3 more of these to hold on to for the next few months, but as the sadness of poor aging hoppy beers goes, I suppose I'll have to enjoy these sooner than later. What a shame eh?"
"Overall a very enjoyable beer, though it didn't quite live up to the hype for me, especially for what it cost to obtain. A fine quality IPA that I would love to have again, but I'd have to find a more reasonably priced source."
"This brew is and easy one to knock back, but actually picking up one, or it's uniqueness might keep you from it."
"Taste starts off, not surprisingly, with a strong, minty-herbal hop bitterness. Cookie-ish malt follows, but soon gets overshadowed by big grapefruit, orange, and pineapple hop flavor. Nicely acidic, and tongue-numbingly bitter. Some fruity malt gets lost in the hops; I would definitely not call this balanced! More citrus into the finish with a strong herbal, resinous aftertaste. Delicious. Medium-bodied, with a slightly lively feel. Dry finish. An excellent very hop-forward citrus bomb!"
"Sculpin pours a lovely honey-copper / orange, with a sudsy snow-white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is superb: tropical fruits -> pineapple, mango; maybe a little apricot; citrus notes; touches of grain; some hints of pine and resin... almost smells like a hopped version of the syrup you would find in a can of tropical fruit mix! Taste is top-notch, as well: Piney hops followed by tropical fruit hints; bitter (yet not overwhelming) hop bite, yet some sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a hint of an oily / resinous feel; carbonation is perfect; crisp; very smooth; sticky (the stickiest of the icky!). Drinkability: unheard of! Delicious... one of my favorite IPA's! Fellow BA's, get your hands on some of this stuff - you won't regret it!"
"if you ahvent had it and you like hoppy beers FIND SOME!!!"
"22 oz. Bright golden pour, some white head and bubbles. Light caramel malt and a ton of citrus, green apple, pine in the strong aroma. Taste is a mirror of the aroma. Tons of hop bittering mid through the finish. Quite lively mouthfeel, refreshingly so. Brings me way back to when I had my first Sierra Nevada Pale and I thought wow. This did that, only after much more experience on the pallet. This is a must for any IPA fan."
"This is, without a doubt, the best regular IPA I've ever had. It has all the hoppiness of a DIPA and the drinkability of a regular IPA. I wish I could get this with regularity but, alas, it is only an occasional rarity. If you have access to this beer and have not yet tried it, go get some now. Highly recommended."
"This is a very nice beer. I don't love the aftertaste, which seems a little bitter and astringent. The smell is amazing, but the taste doesn't quite live up. Still, it's a very good beer and one that I wish was more readily available. It turns out the cask was a nice representation as well. I'll look forward to having some more."
"Great to get my hands on some of this stuff (thanks Roger at Bestway).Poured into a small tulip glass a clear light golden with a clingy 1/2 finger white head.Holy smokes the aromas are just awesome!A mix of big citrus and tangerine just jump out at ya,a hint of caramel/biscuit is there but its a little faint but hey who cares the hop profile is frickin great.Fresh hop flavors abound with tangerine sticking out the most,its lemony with a bit of mango and overripe pineapple,the sweet biscuit malt base does not hide itself as it holds on thru the duration of the glass.Iam not sure if I have had a beer of the style with such fruity hop complexity,wow this is worthy of the rating."
"D: No doubt this is one of the better IPA's I've ever had. Considering though, I seem to have fallen off of the hop-wagon, and my taste is leaning more toward wild ales and scotch ales recently. Just at the moment the drinkability is a little lower, though this brew is indeed exceptional. I'm also drinking this on an empty stomach at 1 p.m., too. So drinkability could be higher."
"Worth getting, would have had higher ratings if the smell was better and didn't look so thin..."
"What a great beer! Ballast Point makes some good beer, but this one is a home run."
"Grapefruit on the nose and on the tongue. Sharp citrus that I absolutely love. Pours nice looks pretty all that good shit, holds a nice head to the end, but taste is where this one is at. Really a well done IPA at a sensible ABV level without sacrificing taste. Surprisingly deep in flavor. Dangerously drinkable too, i would prefer it in a sixer, but i take this one any way I can get it. case worthy to the extreme."
"Draught at the brewery. Gold with a white head that laces the glass well. The aroma is one of the most intense hop blasts that i have ever stuck my nose into. Pine, peach, apricot, and mango are just HUGE in the nose. The flavor has the same gigantic juicey hops but a relatively low bitterness that perfectly balances the bone dry malt. Speaking of malt flavor, you'd struggle to pick out much if anything through the hop juice. Medium, almost light bodied with medium carbonation. This is really a hop paradise on tap. I had a bottle a couple days after sampling it on tap, and while excellent, it didn't quite live up to sucking this nectar right out of the brewery's tap. Very similar to Pliny in that freshness is the world."
"had samples of this on tap a couple weeks later, and while a little better, my opinion still stands. sorry, but i like their regular big eye ipa and dorado double ipa much better."
"This is a wonderfully drinkable double IPA that stands out from the rest with its pristine appearance and the complexity of the hop flavors."
"Yay hoppy!"
"Pours a lightly hazed golden-orange under a thick, creamy head. Smells deliciously stinky. Dank, sugary citrus pulp, juicy ripe mangoes, peaches, and melons. Juicy, zesty, and resinous. First sip isn't seriously bitter, but definitely very flavorful. Sweet grapefruit and orange pulp...all out hops are the name of the game here, but it's not overwhelming. Bright pine needles creep in when held in the mouth for a few seconds. Juicy, oily, floral and obviously very well made. Medium bodied and chewy with just enough dryness to make me drink it down way too quick. Damn you drinkability! I'd love to have some more of this...like on tap...right next to the couch. But, it's $9 a bottle and I can still get a 6-pack of Two Hearted for about the same price, so I'll make do. Highly delicious though..."
"M/D: Delightfully carbonated with a light texture. The taste and complexity make this one IPA that I could drink all day long. A perfect IPA for a hot summer day, if you can get your hands on one!"
"This beer is perfectly bitter - just the way I like it. The appearance is very light, golden yellow with a slight carbonation. The head is small, but the smell is amazingly hoppy, similar to pine needles with a fruit essence. The taste is similar to the smell - fruity, hoppy and bitter. Very refreshing and goes down easy. I will be heading back to the store in hopes of finding more Sculpin! Oh yeah, is it drinkable? Yes."
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to RodBurg for the opportunity!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden almost yellow orange color with a small white head. Leaves some lacing down the sides. I haven't seen to many IPAs with this color but it looks pretty good. Aroma is pretty strong and good, smells piney to me more than anything and a hint of citrus. Smells great. Taste is bitter at first and finishes pretty smooth. Pretty piney which is great, I've been looking for a piney IPA for a while and this one seems to be doing the trick. Decent mouthfeel, kind of light but yet medium bodied. Drinkability is high, not to high of an ABV and with a good taste it's real easy to drink. A great IPA, I'm more into DIPAs and IIPAs and not to many regular IPAs really get my attention to much but this one does, I think it's the pineyness."
"nice beer. i see why people want to try this one."
"Drinkability: My taste buds sure took a beating from this super charged hopped up Double IPA. That's not bad thing, that's a good thing! If you love your hoppy beers (If you're on BA, then you do), then Sculpin is a must try. It is expensive, but well worth the money. If you think this beer is good in bottles, then you should try it on tap. I don't know how you get any better than this, but Ballast Point did it. If you think the bottled version is excellent, then you must try this beer on tap. It's even better on tap!"
"Thanks to Deuane for hauling some bottles up to me to spread around with the NEPA BA's. Poured from a 22ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Sculpin appears a hazed golden yellow color with about two fingers of quickly fading, fluffy bone white foam. The head leaves behind a thin sticky lace on the inside of my glass. Nose and flavor consist of both ruby red and white grapefruit juice, peel, and pith, bitter essential citrus oils, medium toasted bready grains, lemon, pungent hops akin to skunk weed, mild notes of resinous pine, a touch of tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango with some sweet malt coming in towards the end to shoelace it all together. Very pleasant, dry and bittersweet finish that leaves the tongue tingling a bit. Dis be some great shite!"
"I looked forward to trying this and feels that this matches up favorably with just about any of the other world class IPA's. Worthy of its lofty ratings. Would def get again if it was not so hard to find. Check it out."
"Drinkability: This is just an incredible beer that blows all other IPAs away. I think it sets the bar high for other IPAs to aspire to be. To me, it's the best out there."
"D: I could and would drink this brew very often if possible. The only thing holding a hop-lover back from drinking this quickly is the complexity of the hops and the enduring bitterness and profile left on the tongue. That is not a bad thing, but rather helpful in respecting this incredible beer."
"D/O: An excellent West Coast IPA that really shows off the better qualities of the Chinook hop (I can only assume this is one that was used). The crispness of the mouthfeel and the strong piney bitterness really go well together. The smell screamed ""DIPA/IIPA," but the taste really took me by surprise. I'm more partial to the floral/citrusy hops myself, but still found this to be an excellent beer and unique in its flavor profile. This is definitely one to drink fresh."
"Pours a beautiful, light golden color with a nice, white head. The nose is of citic fruits, pine, and slight resin with a nice malt backbone. The taste is full of hops. It's nice and bitter, but it has such a great and complex hop flavor. It ends bitter and malty. It's definitely towards the bitter side, but in a good way. In the mouth it has a nice carbonation level...perhaps a little low though for the style. It's got a nice drinkability...this is such a wonderful beer! I'm so pumped I was able to try it fresh at Ballast Point!"
"Bottle thanks to WeeHeavySD. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of grassy and garlicky hops. Flavor of bitter grapefruit and garlicky hops with a touch of citrusy sweetness and fruity hops in the finish. Certainly hop dominated. The hop profile is not my favorite, but this is a damn good IPA and extremely drinkable too."
"Dayam. My glass on tap was nice, but this is incredible. Sculpin instantly vaults to the top of the IPA class for me. Now I just need to hunt down a few more bottles."
"Is Sculpin really the second-best IPA in existence? I don't know for sure, but I do know I wouldn't mind drinking it on a regular basis to try and find out."
"to me this is perfection (i know that's not possible but i think this one has it) in a beer...could drink this one all night and hope to see it more here on the east coast"
"Drinkability is actually pretty impressive. High flavor/bitterness ratio leaves the palate fresh instead of battering it with astringent bitterness, and 7% abv is easily manageable and completely invisible in the taste. Really nice beer."
"Pours a clear golden amber with thick foamy eggshellish white head head into a tumbler pint. Great retention and some lovely lacing latticework. Smells of citrus fruits, some floral hops, caramel, biscuit, and pine, just like a San Diego IPA should. Tastes of resinous pine up front followed by mango, apricot, pineapple, grapefruit, and peaches that lingers but lets out some honey, toasted grains, and fresh baked biscuit maltiness in the backend. Finishes with some orange and lemon zestiness. Medium in body with some gentle carbonation that pops ever so slightly. Smooth yet slick with a nice balance. Could possibly use just a bit more malt emphasis, but that may just be nitpicking. A phenomenal IPA that is very refreshing, extremely easy to drink, and totally epitomizes the San Diego lifestyle. Cracking open a bottle of this I am instantly relaxed and happy."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is an excellent beer and a great hop bomb that is worth drinking for an entire evening."
"This beer isn't as dry as I thought it would be. It actually finished quite wet and juicy and is extremely drinkable. It's not one of my all time favorites, but I wouldn't mind drinking more in the future."
"Damn fine brew. Easily in my top 3 IPAs of all time."
"D - This really goes down smooth and easy, especially for 7% abv. Big hoppy aroma/flavor with enough sweet malt for a decent balance."
"*** Anyone who wants to argue or send hatemail for this review.. come up to Oregon and let me buy you an IPA!"
"D= An outstanding IPA that really lived up to the hype for me. If the tropical fruit notes had come through in the flavor as much as they appeared in the aroma this would be one of the best ever for me. As it stands, it is something I will drink whenever I have the chance."
"Overall, this is hands down my new favourite IPA. Would put this in a pespi challange with any brew out there. Hope everyone gets a chance to try this brew. Im sure it will be more readily available next season. My hats off to the people at ballast point! Cheers"
"This is great. I could drink it all night. I hope to see this around again sometime. I can only imagine it comes close to bliss on tap."
"M/D - On the lighter side of things with very good carbonation. Very easy drinking with a well masked 7%."
"Well, I was skeptical of the hype. I admit it. However, this more than lived up to all the talk I've heard about this beer and is super worthy of the praise it gets. I wish this were a regular shelf item where I am as it would very possibly be my go to beer or at least in a rotation of go to beers! I want more!"
"Overall AMAZING beer. Well done Ballast Point!! I enjoy their Big Eye IPA a lot but Sculpin blows it away."
"D: Super drinkable and amazingly well balanced. I would have this on my short list of beers to buy if it were available in my area. Well done."
"Huge thanks go out to IBUnit63 for this long awaited brew! Pours a pale golden orange color with a huge three finger billowy head that had great retention and left some thick rings of lacing down the glass. My goodness, I could smell the hops from 5 feet away. Enough grapefruit and citrus aroma that this seems like the cure for the common cold. A nice piney aroma is also present and almost zero maltiness in the nose. Sometimes I just love these IPAs that are practically absent of caramel malts and let the hops shine, but it's not often. This is lovely, though. Very nice bitter, hoppy flavor, mostly consisting of grapefruit, orange and possibly some lemon zest, rounded out by a light piney flavor and some cracker like toasty malts giving a somewhat solid backbone. Body on this one is the only that it's lacking, being on the low side of medium, but it really is the only less than desirable quality. Incredibly tasty and very easy to drink. This really is a great IPA. Thanks again, Larry!"
"D: I really like this beer and think some people may be expecting too much from an IPA. No, it's not as big or hoppy as a DIPA, but it's not intended to be. I highly recommend trying this brew!"
"D - holy shit. ive been pretty meeeh with ballast point after the dorado and big eye IPA but this has blown my mind. this is a very solid west coast IPA that is light in just about every category (except ABV). but this is also huge on flavor and scent. hell yeah bro, this is it."
"Pours a beautiful, nearly-clear golden. Nose is pine, melon, mango, bubble gum, light citrus, and vanilla. Flavor is resiny hops, light fruit, with a nice bitterness and a perfume aftertaste. The hops are really put on front stage here and make for a delightful beer and one of the best examples of the style (a slight nit: the taste was not quite as strong as the aroma predicted). With a crisp, wet feel it makes for a refreshing summer (or anytime) beer. Highly recommended."
"D- Very smooth, very refreshing, very drinkable."
"Drinks easy, not a top flight AIPA, but almost there. Reminds me a lot of Odell IPA, but slightly better. Would love to try this on draft or cask. Finishes with lemony & grapefruitty hops, slight pepperyness. Another good one from Ballast Point!"
"This was a pretty terrific beer overall, especially the lovely head and great hoppy nose."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, to be sure. Very light and refreshing."
"Glad to be able to try this highy hyped and hopped offering from the west coast, thanks to raoulduke37. While I haven't been wowed so far by other Ballast Point offerings, the Sculpin is totally solid across the board. Pours very light, crisp clear and golden, with a gleaming white head, excellent lacing. The nose is deep pungent grapefruit juice and lemon, piney leafy hops, and a bit reminiscent of another popular controlled substance... The flavors in this one all meld together in beautiful hoppy unison, but the main thing I'm getting here is still the grapefruit juice, and a nice bitter citrus rind, along with slick, resiny hops. The most grapefruity beer I can ever recall having. Somehow this extremely flavorful beer remains light and lively on the palate with a dry bitter finish, and very refreshing and drinkable. At one point I was thinking of this beer as a double IPA, and then the light airyness of this beer reminded me that it is just a standard IPA really pushing the out limits of the flavor envelope. Definitely a top-tier, world class IPA, wish it was more readily available."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good on this selection. It's really well done overall and something i could see having time and time again. The alcohol stays well under control which helps it go down with relative ease. Any real faults in this brew are very minor and nothing that would be considered a deal breaker for me. Kudos to Ballast Point for a great brew."
"D--Great beer, I love the hop profile. Glad I was able to get a couple of bottles"
"Overall, an exceptional beer that I give my highest recommendation. Beg, borrow, steal but get your hands on this one. I know I'll be looking for more of it. Most worthy of the hype, praise and high ranking."
"This beer is fantastic, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Maybe THE best."
"When you first pour it, all you smell is ruby red grapefruit. The aroma is so intense, I just can't get enough. It has a half inch head that dissipates slowly as you drink. When you take a sip, you get a load of simcoe and amarillo hops in your mouth. The citrus taste is just amazing. This is all assisted by the fact that Ballast Point went for one of the cleanest malt bases I have ever experienced. Honestly, I just drank most of a growler by myself. I can't get enough of this beer. It gets my vote as best IPA available. It tops Pliny in every way. Good job, Ballast Point."
"D - Extremely drinkable, the best IPA I've ever had."
"D - Man, I really like this one. It's worthy of it's rating, that's for sure. Probably one of the best IPAs I've had, and I've had some good ones. Really amazing."
"believe the hype..sculpin deserves it..."
"It's tough for this not to drink well. It drinks very well. And now I gotta dig up more of this stuff. Knock it down quickly though - don't let these hops fade in your cellar. Excellent stuff."
"D: Great IPA for sure."
"D: I'm mesmerized by this beer. While its not Pliny the Younger.... this beer is right there and NEEDS to be respected as such. If it wasn't for a law school final that I need to prepare for, I would have stayed all night. I'm serious... I would have been at the bar from 5pm til they carted me out drinking this gem."
"Cheers."
"A fantastic beer. Probably the best single IPA I have yet to try."
"This is one that I have been waiting a while to try. I always seem to miss it when Southbay had it and I am glad I was able to acquire it as part of a larger trade. This is one that I would love to see on a regular basis and deserves all of the praise it receives in the single IPA category."
"Just awesome!!!"
"Flavor is just as nice. Tons of citrus and tropical fruits, followed by a nice pine bitterness and a smooth caramel malt background. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth, with a bit of oily like resin. Drink ability is off the charts its just so good and the alcohol is hidden nicely."
"Once you crack this open, you'll wish you had more than 22 ounces. At 7% it is well masked, but after all this is a flavorful brew. Personally I cannot get enough."
"Overall, this was a much enjoyable IPA. I would like to try this uber fresh!"
"Sharp on the palate right away, but not an overwhelming in your face hop presence. It's big but not an assault like some APA's can offer. The bright citrus comes through and again some of the black tea qualities. Faint biscuity malt is in there, and it has a smooth creamy mouthfeel. I pick up some lemon towards the end."
"I had some on-tap at Verdugo Bar in LA two weeks ago, after me and group of 20+ BA's tasted beers like Firestone 12, Eisenbahn Lust, Kentucky Breakfast Stout, and Supplication. After wrecking my palate with all those beers, I thought it tasted great. The bottled version is a little more subtle in flavor, but still damn good."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is an excellent IPA. Not the best I have ever had, but it's probably in the top 5. I'm glad I got to try this one, worthy of seeking out."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light with adequate carbonation."
"D - Ever so drinkable. I can't wait to get some of this from tap/cask."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. This one left a nice two finger foamy head that stayed around for quite a while. The brew is light golden with a touch of orange. Absolutely LOVED the smell. I reminded me of a HopSlam (sigh). Lots of pineapple and citrus, with a definite backbone of malt. It smells very promising. Taste was a bit of a letdown - I was expecting HopSlam, and didn't get it. Extremely hoppy and spicy, no sweetness here. Lots of bitterness, citrus, lemon zest. I didn't enjoy the overkill of bitterness on the mouthfeel. Overall a great brew, but not one that's worth all the trouble to get. I would like to try it on tap, or cask."
"650mL bottle purchased from South Bay Drugs for $8.99 (not including shipping). The beer is crystal clear, color of straw, with a thick wet foam that laces in dry sheets on the glass. The beer smells incredible, citrus fruit and herbal hops with a strong malty scent underneath. The taste is not overly abrasive, more delicious with the hops lending less bitterness and more flavor. Tons of fruit flavor, not just citrus, excellent. I found this too easy to drink, the bottle was gone in no time. Way worthy of the hype."
"Cask at Hamiltons in SD. This from cask is stunning. The aroma is tops with any beer ever. Cask from the 1st batch might have been life changing. This recent batch doesn't have the corn flavor like I tasted in the previous 2. Smooth and a bit short and watery on the finish. Cask conditioning changed all that. Great texture, nice that it was served cold. Super aroma. Nice complexities and finish that stretched further than any other sculpin. But man that nose was stunning."
"Low carbonation and a tad watery but that is somewhat expected from a cask. The drinkability thought is off the charts! I could have easily guzzled down this pint in no time but it took me a few more minutes because I was reviewing it."
"I keep sticking my nose into my beautiful Terrapin snifter (thanks gford217!) & just sipping up the aroma; one of the best-smelling brews I've had, hands down. Excellent beer that lives up to its reputation."
"D: Very drinkable beer, the taste and aroma make this a very easy beer. Another good offering from Ballast Point."
"A good, solid IPA. Would be one of the best if it weren't so hard to come by. Do yourself a favor. Don't sell your soul to a bottle. Do that for a bottle of Alesmith IPA."
"This is a fantastic IPA, extremely drinkable and refreshing (90 degrees out as I type). This was an extremely fresh bottle, which certainly played a large part in the awesomeness."
"Just a great all-around IPA, with enough character to separate it from the pack."
"D- This brew is pretty awesome. Brews that emphasize the citrus/spicy hop combo are hard to come by and this one does an excellent job with it. Really happy that I had the opportunity to try this beer! Too bad it is a limited release."
"Thanks Kevin, I loved this one!"
"D-Outta this world...with almost 6 months on this bottle it still drinks like a champ....so tasty and all about the HOPS!"
"Light-medium bodied with good carbonation. The mouthfeel is dry, crisp, and sticky. I'm glad I made the quick trip over to Ballast Point today to try this. I really like this but I think I prefer the regular version."
"Its funny when you can easily have no problem ordering two Sculpins when you can choose from a Dorado at the same time...stoked I live in SD!"
"D: Goes down easy. I saved this for 6 months. Hop aroma may have faded a little, but not much. Great beer bottled, but even better fresh on tap. Can't wait for the next batch."
"Drinkability: A solid, drinkable brew. There's not too much to dislike about this one, excluding the aforementioned slight vegetal aspects and the mineral quality, the latter of which is likely augmented by the dryness of this one. The hop notes - though light - are really fantastic, complex, authentic, and tasty/aromatic. The abv%, at 7.0%, is perfectly reasonable (even though it's near the upper end of the style). This is just a very solid, drinkable beer. Maybe not the best IPA I've ever had (though I'll have to check my ratings to be sure!), though it's definitely in the top 3. Recommended."
"good drinkability a little bit of a sipper but it goes down easy"
"M/D: Medium bodied, very slick/oily, light carbonation, body just slides over the tongue. Drinkability is very good for this one. Incredible beer offering a ton of taste but never overpowering."
"A two finger light tan head quickly turns rocky as the active bubbles slowly fade. Dots of lace are left behind. Body is a beautiful pure rich amber in color. Nose is so big with luscious mandarin orange, fresh cut flowers, dandelions, and more citrus. Really gets the mouth watering. Hops are fresh, crisp and very juicy with first sip, really highlighting the citrus feel. Mouth watering all over the palate with a very subtle bitter character, not harsh at all. Carbonation is just right and carries a floral mineral feel on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel has a crisp lingering bitter thickness. A sesionable, drinkable IPA that is uniquely refreshing."
"Poured this one into my Duvel tulip. It's a really nice looking bright gold/banana with orange highlights. Very creamy and sticky head which leaves fantasticly thick lacing. The nose on this is super tropical with loads of mango, citrus, and orange. Jeez, this aroma is great! Taste is great too, with lots of mango, orange and peach. There's a bit of bitter lemon and grapefruit, too. Really well integrated, with a bit, but not much malt. The mouthfeel is light to medium, very smooth, and a bit sticky. This one is easy to drink, and I will for sure seek it out again. Damn, this is awesome! Thanks a lot, Mark!"
"for an american ipa you cannot go wrong with this! No BS to this beer, just solid."
"Bitter but drinkable, enjoyable but not classic. Thanks to milwaukeeclassic for the brew."
"A rare treat courtesy of Mauerhan (thanks Topher). 22oz bottle served in a standard pint. Poured a pale orange-gold with a hazy clarity. A quarter inch bright white cap embedded with tiny ringlets quickly dissipates into a soapy slick with a bubbly band around the edges of the glass. Some jagged slashes of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is sweet grapefruit. Taste is bitter piney up front, followed by apricot and sweet grapefruit in the middle and a lingering bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied (but closer to light), with a consistent background effervescence without being overly prickly. Easy drinking and refreshing. Bitterness was intensified because it was initially served a little too cold; however, the true flavor and complexity is revealed as it warms. Great IPA (think I'm finally starting to figure out what this hops thing is all about)."
"The drinkability is off the charts. This is the best american ipa I have had. Truly amazing."
"Drinkability - I had been told to seek this out for some time, and since it was brewed again I snatched some up. This is worthy of everything I heard and then some. Absolutely colossal, and a monument should be erected to this beer."
"Overall: Not too difficult to drink considering it is an AIPA, pretty bitter, a bit unbalanced taste, good piney hop character, and the alcohol is not really noticeable."
"Really nice to sip and I could easily pound these down on a hot summer day."
"Overall- Good piney IPA very enjoyable but a little unbalanced."
"Overall: Interesting DIPA, could be described in one word as bitter. Good mouthfeel with decent carbonation but not a lot of oiliness. It's fairly drinkable but the bitterness slows you down after about 20-30 mins. Still a very unique DIPA that is for sure worth trying."
"This is good, a solid IPA but to be I'm the top 100 there is really nothing outstanding here."
"Standout brew."
"Pours a crystal clear light orange with a thin white head. The nose is an all out assault of juicy tangerine and bubble gum. The flavor doesn't live up to the expectations set my the aroma, but still its very good with some piny and citrus hops. Medium body and super easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Most definitely a very drinkable IPA. I just don't know how much I could take. I love the hops in this one but it may seriously kill your taste buds after a few glasses."
"D:Frickin great. The balance of this beer is amazing, yet the grassy hops are so pungent. Everything just gives way to each other for a beautiful beer."
"Overall, one hell of an IPA. The aroma was distinct and the flavors truly on point. Thanks again Scott for giving me this opportunity. Highly recommended!"
"Hoppy, but rounded. An American IPA classic. This is a great example of the style. Not just hops thrown in, but well-blended with a nice caramelish backbone. Awesome! (There's alcohol in this?)"
"I like this, I would drink it all day, every day. Delish-uss."
"I was never especially interested in seeking this beer out, but when it was offered to me in a trade, I wasn't gonna say no, thanks to srandycarter for hooking me up with this rare IPA. Pour in to a tulip glass reveals a clear golden coloration, and a white lacing of white head. Very potent hop profile in the nose, my mom equated it to my old smelly hockey bag. I definitely get the mango and peach smells alluded to on the blurb on the side of the bottle. Faint garlic and onion can be detected to from the hops. Taste is very pleasant, and not nearly as extreme as the smell as far as the hops are concerned. At the same time, the dominating flavor is hops, it is like hop juice with hints of fruit here and there. Mouthfeel is somewhere between light and medium, and surprisingly the malt can be felt despite all the hop dominance. Drinking this will be a delight for any hophead. Well executed beer we have here from Ballast Point. Very complex, and I am sure I am only scratching the surface of what is happening with this one. If only this was distributed here. Oh well, final note: I love the Sculpin fish on the label. Cheers"
"Great IPA. If this was in sixers it would be a mainstay in the cellar. Dry, crisp, fruity, and clean. The low malt really brings out the hops. A fresh drawn pint must be quite a treat."
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a tinge of orange. Surprisingly light in color. Smallish white head dissipates quickly. Smells of hops. Pine, resin, citrus, perfume, floral, some malty sweetness in the background. Taste is malty sweet with a citrus hop punch. Bitterness hits the tongue up front, finishes dry with a resinous almost mineral aftertaste that makes your mouth salivate for another sip. Medium body, resinous sticky mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. Lots of bitter hop punch and a surprising amount of sweet malt. Great Ipa, but I can't say that I enjoyed it as much as some others I've tried."
"This is truly a fantastic IPA... Thanks again Derrick for suggesting we make this part of the package... Awesome beer that is worthy of the high grade."
"D> Obviously I'm smitten. But how can I rank drinkability for an IPA at a perfect 5 when the ABV is 7%? This obviously isn't a session brew. In my mind, the perfect IPA is a bit lower in alcohol."
"Very drinkable. A great mouthfeel about this one. At first I was perplexed by how it tasted in the sense that the malt was so present through the front, but then it just grew on me. This will be something I have to get every year now. It's going great with some peppered kettle chips."
"HV"
"Thank you to torchednoodle for giving me the opportunity to give it a shot by throwing it in as an extra in a trade."
"As a side note, I was able to try a bottle from the last batch, the medicinal notes were not present. I wonder if it ages out."
"This bottle seemed a bit undercarbonated to me as for prior experiences, affecting both head retention and the volatility on the nose, as well as making the malt structure more apparent from the get go. Nonetheless, the brew stood up quite well."
"In my opinion the sculpin is a fantastic example of a west coast style ipa. In pa we get all of the ballast point brews but for some reason this is not available. Wish it were b/c I would buy a case w/out a doubt. Time for another trade to get more. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Solid mouthfeel for style, a bit lighter than some in the style but incredibly drinkable, virtually impossible to drink just one ( I could not!) Simply a great beer and one of the beer highlights of my recent trip to SD."
"Drinkability: An ode to the hop: this beer captures it's flavor and delivers it to you in a nice clean package. Great fruity flavors throughout. Lighter body makes this dangerously drinkable. Wish they made this year-round."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, herbal, citrusy, with a long, orange-like finish."
"Good body and carbonation. Very easy to drink. Simple. Outstanding."
"M: A really well harmonized beer, one of the better ones. The lighter body is a plus too; it's refreshing without being too weighty. Good flavors of the tropics."
"Pours a surprisingly pale golden amber color with subtle orange hues and a deep foamy white collar with nice retention and a reasonable amount of Belgian lacing with each mouthful. The smell is amazing; aggressive and complex...from the bottle neck, peach-apricot (as suggested on the label) and from the glass a more prominent citrus and piny resin. Full flavored, a hophead's dream! Grapefruit and piny resin tastes explode and linger well into the aftertaste...that's what I'm talk'in about!! The mouth is hugely hoppy and tangy yet light in texture and carbonation. I'm seriously tempted to crack open another bomber...but that would be borderline gluttony [Wikipedia...(disambiguation) derived from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow, gluttony is the over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or intoxicants to the point of waste.]. I am willing to compare this one to Pliny the Elder...many similarities, but this one has a noticeably lighter body. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
"Notes: Amazing! A mouth-watering hop bomb that starts sweet and ends bitter. I knew I was going to love this from the first whiff, but it somehow managed to eclipse those expectations by far. Another jewel from the good folks at Ballast Point. I know they're hard to get a hold of, but you MUST try this if you can! Highly recommended"
"drinkability- drinks way to easy for a 7% beer. this is a first class west coast ipa."
"Drinkability: Good, drinkable and enjoyable. Not the absolute best IPA in the world but always a solid choice."
"Pours a clear golden amber colored body. Big foamy white head, rocky with good lacing. Bubbly. Very piney citrusy aroma, grapefruit. Dry smelling. Watery body, malty taste, some nuttiness. Dry grapefruit aftertaste. Carbonated and drying aftertaste. More hoppy and bitter with only some balancing nutty sweetness. More balanced as it warms up."
"Again not overly complex just clean too the point and delicious. Straight centennial with maybe some other hop addition? Malt balances the hop but shows little character. Perfect amount of carbonation. Piney on the finish oh so floral. An easy perfect scorer for drinkability."
"d) Fantastic and easy to drink, I could have this all day long."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"D. I love this beer! Its a session able Ipa for me at 7%. Im glad I got more than one, cant wait to have another!"
"Pours a barely foggy amber with a thin creme head. Nose is pine resin and slight citric tones. Flavor is that biting acrid salty hops tone. Pine is definitely there. It's biting, but still smooth enough somehow. Feel is typical on liquid and carbonation is even. This is an easy to drink IPA, but it's best judged when you look at it as a San Diego IPA as opposed to an IPA in general. Still, I like it."
"Among the best of the style."
"D: Drinks smooth for 7%. Very well balanced, all of the flavors meld well together. A very nice IPA."
"D: A very good IPA from Ballast Point. Did it live up to the hype for me - not completely, but it is quite a good beer. The hop complexites in this one give it the potential to be incredible on cask - I hope I can find some, but if there's any it's probably in San Diego. Definitely try this release."
"Second bottle consumed at home. Yeah this beer is definitely a big winner. Bumping Smell from 4-->4.5 and the same for mouthfeel."
"Just checked d0b's review - looks like the bottle is from early September, so I'm on the cusp of freshness for an IPA. There's still tons of hop character in the taste and it hasn't gone super-sweet on me. If you're gonna try this one the clock is ticking on this release. I definitely prefer this to Big Eye (which is a pretty solid brew in its own right). Beginning to dread my trip home to Canada - land of weakly hopped IPAs."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours clear orange-gold with a spongey white head. Great floral hoppy aroma with lemon and oranges. Clean, bold hop taste throughout. Good amount of grapefruit with tangerine, pine without resiny stickiness, and maybe a little pepper. Bittersweet malt in the finish without being overbearing. It has the hop bite and taste of an Imperial, but the body of a regualr IPA. Excellent."
"Notes from 3/18/08"
"With great appreciation to Torchednoodle, for this tasty excellent IPA. Orange appearance with white head. Grapefruit aroma, very nice.Very smooth, very drinkable. Great resiny hop. One of the best IPAs I ever had, and the bottle picture is cute too."
"If this were available year round I would likely have a bottle, maybe even a case in my fridge at all times."
"Poured a dark golden color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of more resiny pine (gotta love San Diego!), citrus fruits, caramel malts, and floral hops. Taste of toffee malts, citrus fruits, light malts, and a dry bitter finish."
"Thanks RyanC84"
"Overall this is a very impressive IPA from Ballast point. The first beer of theirs was Dorado, which was also quite good, but i find this one to be so much cleaner. Just ideal for an IPA. The malt profile keeps me wondering even now. That strange fruity kind of dank sweetness is calling to me, but i cannot answer it. It is very mysterious. The balance in this beer is very impressive. A very fine IPA from California, and one I will surely seek out again. Excellent beer."
"D- Very drinkable! I could drink two of these in a row...the ABV is on the lower side for the style and that's fine with me because then I can drink more. Not that I will...but could. Great beer! Thanks to oodeftone!"
"This beer pours a light amber (not cloudy) with a 2 fingered head and lots of lacing. The smell is wonderful, fruity, nutty, hops, spices and you can even get some sense of the malts. The taste is wonderful as well, beautiful fruity flavors with some nut flavor and citrusy hops and a great malt base to it. Very well balanced and certainly one of the best IPA's I have ever taste, I had to take a double take to see if it was a DIPA. The mouthfeel suffers from a very dry aftertaste, but the carbonation level seems nice. I could see myself drinking a bunch of these in a night :)"
"D: Tasty as all hell and ABV isn't too high for the style. This is a massive hop attack, though, especially for a single IPA. It's not too much for this hop head but just a bit too much for the style. A bit more carbonation could improve the drinkability of this hop bomb. Great beer."
"Similar in color to the bottled version with a little more haziness. Fantastic looking head, great retention and lacing. On the nose, this beer is incredibly floral and hoppy with a good deal of fruitiness. Pretty much a crushed hop pellet. On the palate, it's hops all the way, like the bottled version, only better in that there's an excellent balance between the flavor and the bittering hops. Surprisingly well-carbonated for a cask ale, it's a treat on the palate with a great balance, apart from the occasion hop particle that's there. Drinkability wise, this beer is almost bar none - I drank more than I should have!"
"*edit 2/27/09* I've had three different batches of this beer, and I have enough currently to enjoy one every once in a while. I have to say, I drank one again tonight and this beer is STILL the benchmark by which I judge all other beers. It's not the crazy hoppiest beer you'll find, but it had enough bright and citrus hops and malt to satisfy me like crazy. Ballast Point is the SHIT."
"Pours a very clear gold in color with only a ring of froth. Smell is very piney hops. Taste is very green, brutally bitter hops. This is very fresh and very green. Very bittering and tongue ripping. This is a aggressive and brutal onslaught on your palate. The bottle is incredible, I could only imagine how this is on draft. Wow."
"Overall: possibly the best tasting IPA ever"
"This IPA pours a gorgeous a clear bright golden orange color with a good sized bone-white head on it that left spotting lacing on my glass. The nose on this beer is very unique and interesting for an IPA. I think mango is the strongest scent followed by passion fruit, peaches, lemon and orange zest, floral hops, and a slight pine bitterness as well. The smell on this beer is leaping from my glass, and it never left for the entire beer how strong the aromatics were. The flavor profile is loaded with citrus fruits with grapefruit and tangerines being very dominant followed up with only a slight touch of caramel malt. The malt is only barely noticable, but somehow supports the hops beautifually. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation that left a very dry finish on the back of my palate. The drinkability is superb on this beer, and is one of the better IPAs I've have ever had the pleasure of tasting."
"A very tasty, impressive beer. A great hop fix, but not at all cloying or over done."
"There is a light-to-medium level of hoppiness in the taste. It has a relatively light body. Initially, you get a medium dose of carbonation. As the carbonation faded, it seemed like the dryness comes out. I'm not sure what it was, but the final taste in my mouth was not quite as formidable, perhaps because I had just had Pliny the Elder. Either way, this was a great beer and I again would recommend it to people that enjoy beers that are hoppy."
"Medium bodied, refreshingly bitter, with very little malts to be talked about; its backbone shows some cookie notes, but not a lot else. Hops, hops and more hops, with a fresh fruit explosion. Very impressive, if exquisitely unbalanced. This is a hophead's dream, and even for a moderate hop admirer, very well done."
"Overall: I wish I knew how to write better reviews, but simply put....you have to try this beer!!!!"
"mouthfeel is great. the perfect amount of carbonation. smooth follow through and a great aftertaste. the burp flavor is great. you get a chance to try this i dont care what you have to do. you try it."
"22 oz Bottle from Churchill's in San Marcos. Pours cloudy amber orange with a fluffy white head. Sweet aroma of hops and citrus. Flavor begins with sweet hops and ends with hints of lemon and orange. The citrus flavor and aroma really dominate, but it is very nice and very easy to drink quickly. Refreshing! A very very good double IPA!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation that never becomes biting, and the drinkability is just fantastic."
"Bottle poured at the brewery during RBSG 08. Golden color, tightly packed white head, good lacing. Caramel malt aroma with accents of tropical citrus and stone fruit. Flavor is cakey malt, orange, grapefruit, and pineapple, with a solid bitterness. Long dry finish, extremely drinkable."
"D- what a drinking experience, possibly one of the most complex scents I've ever come across on a beer, great flavors too back up the nose. do not miss this beer"
"This is a really solid brew that drinks almost like a double IPA. Definitely one worth seeking out."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden light orange color, very nice carbonation, awesome one-finger plus thick creamy off-white head, which leaves some small islands and sticky lacing behind. The nose is slightly malty, big time hops, some scents of lemon/orange, and piney. The taste is slighlty sweet, nice malt notes, very nice hoppiness, with some lemon/orange tones, and some pinyness. Medium body, a very nice chewyness with a slightly dry/bitter finish. Very drinkable, a truely awesome IPA, highly recommended. Thanks Bill!"
"Huge thanks to Srandycarter & Mikesgroove"
"Thanks to HopHead84 for the opportunity."
"Taste is fruity, crisp, clean, lightly bitter and citrus rind like. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Refreshing and very drinkable. Great IPA."
"Overall a fantastic tasting IPA. I like the hoppy intensity and the uniqueness on the style. Somewhat less drinkable by abv and feel than other IPAs, but this is a tasty treat that I'd seek out to drink again if I have the opportunity."
"Pure west coast hops in the nose. Authentic and just how an IPA should be. Very vibrant. Color is a very light gold, with ample foam. Flavor, however, is a bit of a letdown. Doesn't have a lot of malt depth. The hops arn't as vibrant as I'd like. Needs more bitterness. Still high quality, but just not as hoppy as I'd like."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden, very thick white chunky head forms, drops a ton of lace, great retention, keeps a solid layer. Smell is great, very intense, tons of grapefruit, pine, floral, caramel, sugary malt, pineapple, complex hop aromas, just great. Taste is caramel and brown sugar up front, very fruity, grapefruit, pineapple, floral, very hoppy, pineapple is pretty intense, some alcohol near the finish, balanced but significant bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth, bit of spicy alcohol/hop bitterness kick in the finish, this one doesn't fuck around. Definitely all the hype, kickass IPA! Thanks Jan and Russ."
"Prior to popping the cap, I had doubts about whether Sculpin was the fifth best India pale ale in America. I still don't think it is, but it's in the top fifteen for damn sure. Ballast Point has never knocked my socks off... until now. If you love hops, hope and pray that this limited release will be brewed again."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice malt and hop depth. a top notch ipa."
"This is my first experience with Ballast Point and I'm damn impressed. I wish their distribution reached this far east, but unfortunately that's not the case. I'd buy this by the case if it were available. Sculpin's a truly impressive IPA. Among the finest available. Catch it if you can."
"A nice beer: a bit unusual for an IPA but still quite enjoyable. It is a bit expensive; however, it is a limited release. Worth trying."
"Drinkability- All-and-all, definitely not a bad brew. It smells a lot like Hop 15 (which I seem to compare all of these fruity hop bombs to) but tastes nothing like it. It comes up a bit short of great but none-the-less is still really good. I never thought that I'd actually wish a beer had a bit more hop bite. If that nose came through in the taste it'd be a home run. Big thanks to Shane for the opportunity!"
"Drinkability - my first Ballast Point beer, and a good one. I need a side by side with Masala Mama..."
"Same great flavor...aroma really stuck out this time around. I could smell this IPA all day...glorious!"
"Prosit, MK"
"Bright, crystal clear light orange colour with a cap of fine, white foam. Good head retention with solid sheets of bubbles covering the glass. Wonderful, hoppy aroma. Lots of citrus here, mostly grapefruit, with notes of citrus flesh and pith. Tangerine sweetness was in the background. Quite fragrant with the slightest hint of alcohol buried behind everything else. Solid bitterness that stayed balanced throughout, though it did linger on the palate as other flavours faded. Lot of citrus too, pink grapefruit and tangerine, with orange peel and a hint of pine resin towards the end. Sweetness was fruity rather than malty. Medium bodied (just barely) with average carbonation. A bit dry and highly attenuated. Quite a good IPA, one of the best American style that I've had in a while. Lots of hop character is packed into this one."
"D: For me, this is what all West Coast IPAs should aspire to be and is one of the most drinkable IPAs I've tasted. I would go well out of my way to get a hold of this one. Outstanding."
"Great IPA overall. Nothing overly complex or earth-shattering, but a fine ode to the almighty hop. It's too bad BP isn't going to brew this again for awhile."
"Intense, fresh hops all around in this brew. It is quite spectacular. Much easier to drink than their Dorado Double. Don't you just love California?"
"I'll be sure to grab more fresh when it comes out again, but I don't think it makes much sense to stock up on a beer that I doubt would get better with age."
"Notes: This is what an IPA is. Hoppy, balanced, quenching, easy-drinking, and tasty. I highly recommend seeking one out now, while it's fresh and (somewhat) available. This is gonna be gone for a while, I'm afraid."
"Newer batches of this beer are significantly less impressive. The tropical fruit aromatics are largely gone, and the hop flavor less intense."
"Overall this was probably my favorite west coast IPA I have ever had. I had to score it perfectly, only because I could not find any fault in it. When I think west coast IPA, I think of exactly this beer now. If you love hops, you simply cannot be happy without this one."
"Big thanks to Los for the bottle, quite tasty to say the least!"
"Refreshingly different and quite drinkable."
"Recommended."
"Bottom line: Here's a world class IPA if I've ever tasted one. If you get the chance to try it, don't hesitate for one moment!!"
"D- Wow this IPA seems more complex than the others I have enjoyed. Layers upon interesting layers of flavor and aroma. This is one of my favorite IPA's to date."
"I wish that we saw this one up in the bay area."
"Recommended. A fine SD-style IPA."
"I bought one of only three bottles available for sale at TJ's Everyday. I know its being discontinued temporarily probably because of the hops shortage, and I feel lucky to have scored one of the only bottles in the whole state of Pennsylvania. I shared this 22oz. bottle with 2 friends of mine, and they both have had enough IPA's by now to know that this one tasted like grapefruit. Very smooth grapefruitey flavor provided by the hops. Like most west-coast IPAs, it almost could pass as a DIPA, as the boozey taste is there as well, and the sweet malts. However it is not a full-blown DIPA to this well-trained IPA-lovin palate of mine. It is drinkable but I gave it a 4 because we won't be seeing it in PA for a long time. Its kind of a shame."
"This is probably my favorite IPA and I've only had it twice. It poured a nice thick off white head and it has a beautiful golden color. The smell is just exceptional, above and beyond any other IPA I have ever had. Smells floral, grassy, piney, grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Just all sorts of things going on in the smell and this translates directly into the taste. It tastes nice and hoppy, similar to the smell, and it also has a nice malty sweetness then a lingering, pleasant bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is pretty good and the drinkability is amazing. This is really the best IPA I have had to date and I will definitely try to get some more in the future. Highly recommended!"
"Very well made; clean, pure expression of the hops."
"Poured into a Stone IPA flute glass. Immediate pine aroma hit the nose as the glass filled. Clear light amber color with a small head that dissolved quickly with light/medium carbonation. Huge citrus and pine smell that carries onto the palate. Very light on the tongue...almost Summer ale and pilsner like. Fades to a sweet/light/hoppy aftertaste. Slight alcohol taste as the beer warmed up. A very good aromatic IPA that leaves the door open to the next endeavor."
"This is a very good IPA. I don't really taste the vegetal I got last time, just fruity, dank IPA. This is much better than Dorado or Big Eye. Friends said it was like Green Flash westcoast meets odell IPA. Awesome."
"Pours a crystal clear light copper hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head. Thin lacing left on the sides as the puffy cloud of bubbles slowly dies down to a thin layer. Smell is one of a kind. Fresh grapefruit, subtle evergreen, mandarin oranges, floral aromas, and pear. There is a faint scent of grass as well. By far the sweetest smelling IPA I've ever encountered. Taste begins with a sharp pine bite followed by an interesting creamy citrus flavor. Sour pink grapefruit sprinkled with sugar midway thorugh. Dry floral aftertaste with a lemon zest. Light to medium body with a pillow like feel. Very pleasant carbonation from start to finish. You don't see these IPA's brewed in the east. Such an amazing west coast IPA. Clean, refreshing, and goes down so easy. I really wish this one was avaialble in CNY. One of the best IPA's out there by far."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Orangish color with a large head that dissipates quickly into a smaller one. Aroma of citrus and flowers thanks to the hops. Maybe a touch of sweet malts underneath. Taste is bitter and resiny hops, that fade into a floral and slight malty sweetness. Overall the flavor is all about hops like it should be. Medium-bodied with nice carbonation. This a very tasty beer that I could see myself drinking frequently. In fact, I had this on-cask the other night at Hamilton's and I drank quite a bit of it."
"After having a few bottles, I'm upping the rating. This is just an absolutely wonderful IPA, and it's a kinder, gentler introduction to the style."
"The Dorado Double had a unique richness and aroma and was strong enough to keep you a bit in check... this goes down so easily, I can imagine blowing a wad on this before you know it. Hopefully I stumble across it on draft..."
"Dammmmn, what a beer this is. It's not as intense as some IPAs, or even the Dorado DIPA made by Ballast Point. This is a light, subtle, fruity, exquisite IPA that you should make every effort to taste. Appearance is a rich orange color with fluffy white foam. Smell is an intense peach and apricot flavor. The taste, as I mentioned, is not as intense as say a Stone or Dorado, but is unique among the IPAs I've tasted. Peach, apricot, lemon, grapefruit, plus the bitterness you'd expect. Really incredible mix of flavors which hint more than overwhelm. Carbonation is just right. I don't know what more I can say, except that this is a very special beer."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into PP 7th ann. Real Als Fest english pint glass. Poured a golden orange honey color with thick foamy white head. Smell is a mixture of citrus, malt, and floral hop notes. Taste is like eating a grapefruit with a slight grassy bitterness followed by semi sweet malt profile. The alcohol is well masked in the flavors with a crisp mouthfeel and medium to light body. Carbonation was in great balance with the taste retaining a creamy feel. This is one of he best tasting IPA's on the market right now with just the right alcohol level and great balance still with an upfront grapefruit taste."
"Overall: This beer is great!!! Possibly the best IPA I have ever had."
"yep...it's that good and easy."
"This is a fresh and vibrant west coast IPA, check it out..."
"D - Good session beer."
"One of the best IPA's on the market."
"Overall: This beer is great. It is well balanced and complex. It might be the best IPA from Balast Point. I am going to miss it when I move."
"Glad to see at least one cask at the event and an IPA was a good break from all the barrel aged brews and assortments of doubles and other strong tasting beers"
"Drinkability- Of the 8 brews I had at the fest, this was about tied for my 2nd favorite. Good stuff as usual from Ballast Point."
"You have to try it. Great stuff."
"Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates. Citrusy hops dominate the nose with notes of fresh grapefruit and pine. There is some sugary sweetness up front along with a light citrusy fruitiness followed by a strong bitterness of grapefruit rind and pine oil. A thoroughly enjoyable IPA here."
"Medium body with the alcohol well burried, I'd have to guess it's around 7%ABV, very high drinkability and hop-head friendly...one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted!"
"overall: one of my favorite double IPAs. They really got the hops right in my opinion. I hope they keep this one around for a while."
"Drinkability: Refreshingly drinkable, this is a great example of an IPA in the mold of what a lot of the San Diego breweries are producing (and marketing as a San Diego Pale Ale)"
