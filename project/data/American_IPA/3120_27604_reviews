"I was looking forward to having this beer as well as other Alpine Beers on tap while visiting California.  Had this beer in Los Angeles and was surprised how much it dissapointed me in the aroma and taste department.  The floral and grassy notes were too flowery in a Sauvingon Blanc kind of way and irritatingly grassy.  The taste was more astringent than bitter to my palette.  I thought that maybe it was a bad keg or wasn't fresh so I had it again at Toronado and it was exactly the same.  I guess I'm missing something about this IPA because I'm one of the few that doesn't particularly like it."

"O - great example of the West Coast IPA and I do like this better than Sculpin.  Can hold its own with most IPAs I've tried.  Great beer."
""

"Lots of great hop flavor with medium bitterness. The malt makes a quick appearance with some breadiness."

"incredible ipa, thanks to falling rock for somehow having these beers on tap! this is just insane, and incredibly highly anticipated by me for years, what a pleasant surprise to happen on these! this was the best of the three in my book, and by a mile, one of the best beers i have had this year, certainly on the hoppy side. paler than the others, but also the only one of the three with any haze to it. holds a half inch of white foam for an entire pint. the nose is great, i sweat i smelled nelson hops in here, but it must be some new expression of amarillo i am not familiar with, because this seems so much more southern hemisphere, tropical, and alive than anything coming from california. maybe some wheat malt in here too for body, it has a just short of creamy texture to it, very soft on the palate, but briskly carbonated as well, just how i like my ipa. the flavor is insane, the hops are awesome, and i could never guess simcoe and amarillo if i was quizzed on it, suggesting i either dont know as much as i give myself credit for knowing, or that this is done with some magic, some technique and process or even quality of ingredient that is entirely new to me, im hopping the latter, but am fine with either, as this beer makes everything seem okay. minimal bitterness to the finish, but there is something weird and uncommon in here too, and that is a crazy sweetness in the middle. sort of confectioners sugary, but almost like coconut in the raw, or even pineapple juice for a second, just a strange sweet that lingers long, but it tastes fantastic, and doesnt hurt this for me in the least, makes it even more distinct frankly. overall a world class ipa without a doubt, and really the only one of the three i had that is worthy of all this hype. hoppy birthday was good, but this one takes the cake (good pun!)"

"Sweet tasting and rather simple.  Expectations were not met and I think this beer is overrated."
""
""
"Pours a light golden color with white head and lace.  Light aroma of west coast hops.  Flavor very nice and mellow of citrus, pine and melon.  Bitterness is mild, balancing and agreeable.  A nice IPA that drinks more like a simple pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice medium  amber color. Nice mixture of hop notes. Starts grapefruit but ends with a nice lime and citrus note. Light sweet malt taste. Aroma is very good and hoppy with two hop notes. Overall,  fantastic IPA."

"A quintacential West Coast IPA. Perfect harmony between pine resin, citrus pith, green dankness, and robust honey malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good IPA in the west coast vein that isn't too overwhelming one way or another. Nice floral bite up front that is appropriately backed up by a sweeter malt and citrus backbone. It's not anywhere near Alpine's best beer (that's Nelson) but it's very solid."
""
""
"Nice appearance and good floral nose.  Great flavor.  I think I prefer Nelson slightly more, but would be happy to have another pint of Duet."
""
"Had this last night on tap as a guest beer at the Amherst Brewing Company.  I walked in and ordered it immediately.  Awesome beer!  Incredibly nuanced, juicy, and flavorful."
""
""
""
"Tastes super flavorful without any of the attendant heaviness found in most larger IPAs. Orange and grapefruit hops start things off, sliding into a more balanced middle and ending with a quite nice bready yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Green Flash Version.  From the Duets I've had in the past, the hop element did not shine through as much.  Plenty of Amarillo (in the nose), light pine (in the nose).  Taste, faint pine, almost muted, but heavily bitter.  I was a bit taken back by the bitterness on this one.  I love bitter, but balanced, I didn't find the balance in this one."
""
""
""
"D: The flavors meld so perfectly creating an even, smooth and insanely drinkable beer. Huge flavor, great nose, perfect body."

"not gonna lie this is a delicious beer great citrusy hops .  I may not like how the brewer behaves but this is really tasty"
""
""

"Not bad for IPA not a fan of IPA. Give me a stout or a lager."

"This is easily a 9/10. The aroma is amazing, very west coast IPA. Tropical juiciness hits your pallet at first taste and stays! Crushable for sure. If ever in Western MA go to Moes in Lee, MA."
""
""
""
""

"Sweeter, oranger in appearance, and way more floral than Nelson. An exceptional ipa but Nelson reigns supreme."

"Overall, this was a really fun beer to review.  There is so much going on between these two hop varietals, and it is great to see them paired up here.  They come from essentially opposites sides of the hop wheel, so to speak, with the Simcoes being highly piney and earthy, while the Amarillos are lighter, sweeter, and more citric.  The “lighter” aspect of the latter really hits home here, as they are greatly overshadowed by the piney dominance of the Simcoes.  This is most apparent though the flavoring, the bitterness of which becomes ingrained within your taste buds and palate.  The aroma shows this same preference, but there is greater unity.  None of this is to the beer’s detriment, but rather just interesting discussions points between the two of us.  As with Nelson, this is a great beer, and showcases some of the more serious, refined, and mature products coming off of the west coast."
""
"Poured a cloudy orange body with two finger head and left lace patches down the glass.  Citric, herbal hop aroma with some sweet malts in the aroma and the beer's taste profile is the same as a light, clean body that has citric, earthy hops that balance with sweet notes (malts and possible sweet fruit flavors) for a mild but very enjoyable IPA that hides the ABV."

"Another great IPA from Alpine. Really well crafted, really easy drinking, and just really tasty."
"On tap. Another long awaited ""Want"" cut into the bedpost. Pours a slightly hazy, dark orange color with a soft head. Mild lacing. Aroma is deep and resiny. West Coast all up in this nose. Amarill and Simcoe pull zero punches. Pine, grass, grapefruit, and some other fruit/hop elements. Malt? We don't need no malt here. The flavor hits my tongue and detonates. Heavy bursts of that pine and fruit I found in the nose. Earth hops. Some tropical fruits as well. A barely-noticeable sweet and neutral malt cloak. This feels and tastes like a big Double IPA. 7% feels and tastes like 10% but without the added alcohol. A West Coast uppercut of bitterness floors my palate. Lingering, long, formiddable bitterness. Has a fuller body. Is beer was quite a good time. Alpine in Massachusetts is a good thing for this dude."
""
"Old start but then a strong bitter, black pepper-like hop completely takes over. Good body for the style. Appropriate carbonation. Not as comex as I was hoping given the BA score but still a solid IPA."
""
""
"By far the worst Alpine beer that I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average. Unlike their other offerings, this one leaves a lot to be desired. The hops don't jump out like the other beers."

"22oz bottle poured into tulip at #bottlecherwednesdays with Vito at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Crazy tall off-white head head, on a clear golden beer. Aroma is as advertised: grapefruit, mango, pineapple goodness from the hops plus a little caramel malt hint. Taste is in line with the smell with some earthy tones and nice bready underpinnings. High carbonation, medium bodied, thin texture, dry bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"A vast improvement over Nelson."
""
""
""

"Pours clear light gold with a thin white head. Not many bubbles or lacing. Smell is mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Taste follows the nose. Bright fruity notes with some pine and just the right amount of bitterness. Maybe a little oniony too.  Sweet malts complement the fruity hops really well. Really clean finish. Mouthfeel is spot on. Really easy drinking and super low IBU for an IPA. Overall one of my favorites, edged out just a bit by Nelson. Just a really great, clean IPA."

"Tastes of ripe orange, wrapped up by sweet, slightly honeyed malts. Has a well fitting, slightly bubbly carbonation, drinks exremely smooth. The tropical fruits, orange and lime, get enforced by a slick, long staying dry bitterness, maintaining its rich juicy character. The brews pure fruitiness gets well supported by heavy, bready malts, which let stand out its sunny, sweeter qualities. This gets countered in the finish, when the hops get a dry, lemony punch to them, still in balance with the malts, but certainly quite bitter, while at the same time bing easy drinkable. Ends with a huge load of enriching bitter hops, which remain on the palate for a long while, with a distinct fruitiness still being noteable."
""
""
""
""
"Really good. I just had this after pure hoppiness. I like pure hoppiness better. i also like blind pig better."
""
"Clear amber, laced white foam. Effervescent grapefruit, passion fruit, a little guava. Lighter body but burst of fruit. Very refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"High expectations of Alpine again.  A solid beer but I don't get the hype."
"A nice IPA, a little too malty for me, and overall not especially exciting... Not even close  to the magnitude of Nelson!"

"O: Alpine is the real deal first beer by them and although I suspect it's slightly odd it's still pretty fantastic.  I was surprised it had simcoe hops I would have guessed. New Zealand hops like Nelson.  Regardless it's a great IPA look for it."

"O- Alpine has yet to let me down.  This is another one of the best IPAs out there.  I can't say enough good things about this company.  Duet has juicy and refreshing character that appeals to the hop lover."
"Long on the malt, balanced on the hop. A good palate cleanser. Not a staple."

"This is my 1000th beer.  Had it on tap at Coin Op in San Diego.  Nice and hoppy, but not overly.  Good bitterness.  Really balanced with the hops.  Great hop nose.  Glad this was my 1000th check in.  Alpine is one of the best small breweries out there."

"Pours a golden honey color. Light haze with a 2 finger off-white head that leaves spotty lacing on the glass with each sip. Just a beautiful looking beer. Aroma is citrus forward. Super citrus- grapefruit, tangerine, some tropical fruitiness, mild pine and grain. Taste follows the nose with a wonderful citrus burst and a piney, mildly bitter finish. Malt bill is very minimal and really highlights the hops although it detracts from the mouthfeel a bit. A little lighter bodied  than I would prefer for an IPA, which makes it feel like you could drink it all day, and sometimes I do. Overall this is a world class IPA and one of my favorites."

"Light herbs and floral hops on the nose I sense a bit of chives, tangerines, caramel, grapefruit, watermelon and bitter lemon rinds. The front is floral with an herbaceous hops. The middle palate is caramel before it ends with a grapefruit bitterness and resiny pine. The feel is almost sessionable as it holds almost no astringency."
""

"Alright, this beer is damn good. It's indisputable. Smooth like a pale ale with DIPA flavor and body. 4.35"

"It pours a golden-tan with exceptional clarity. I get a great citrus aroma and some light piney notes. There’s a lively citrus flavor and a light bittering on it. I enjoyed this repeatedly when I found it on tap. An all around well done IPA that hits all the right notes."

"just an incredible beer. Perfection and balance define the palate. Has the right amount of hops, right amount of malt, and it has a silky smooth drink down the palate. There's a bit on the front palate and the concentration of flavor is so appealing and long Not sure what else you can ask from a west coast IPA."

"O - A wonderful IPA. Amarillo and simcoe are not my favorite hops but I can still recognize a very good IPA and this is it. While I do not think it's world class, it's definitely a hop heads dream. I would also like to see a bottle date. This borders on the greatness line and would love to have access to it on a daily basis."
"O: A very solid IPA here. Would have every day, if that were possible."
"O- Very solid. Maybe prefer a bit more than Nelson. Bottom line tho, this brewery knows its way around the hop"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just an excellent IPA. And as I'm aware it's made with Simcoe and Amarillo, I can't help but think to myself that perhaps Amarillo is my favorite hop of all. It seems to be present in many of my favorite beers. This one is no different. Too bad I can't get Alpine in my neck of the woods, or online, for that matter. Not that I'm saying anything that hasn't been said about this beer, but if you see it, and you like IPAs, get it. End of story."

"Growler. Pours a clear copper with a one finger white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. Aroma is dank with a bit of pine as well as a hint of orange and some caramel. The taste is dry and dank. There's a bit of pine as well as a hint of grapefruit and some caramel. The finish is dry with quite a bit of bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:4.5 Great IPA. Amazing how much flavor there is for a single IPA. Has a lot of the same flavors, aromas, and balance as DIPAs (enjoy by, Pliny, etc.), but it's lighter, less malty, and easier to drink."

"Tried this at the bottle share that sprung up at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop. Pours light yellowish gold with a fluffy white head on top. Aroma of huge pineapple, grapefruit, other citrus notes, lemon peel, sweet honey from the malts. Awesome. The flavor is even better. Huge pineapple sweetness up front followed by bitter pine and grapefruit, some grass, and big lingering citrus notes throughout the palate. Super light bodied, easy going, and medium plus carbonation. I wish I could have this every day."

""

""

"O-Overall nicely refreshing. Was looking for a more assertive hop flavor and aroma, but all in all an easy to drink and refreshing beer."
""
"22oz bottle pours a bright golden amber color with a 1/2 inch of head. Lots of lacing. Hoppy aroma with a mix of floral and citrus hops. The taste is sweet floral bitterness with some light citrus notes. Fair amount of toasty malts. More flowery hops at the finish with some citrus peel. Some grassy notes as well. Medium bodied. Overall, this is a really good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very similar to the Beachwood Amalgamator I had last night. Both great brews."
"Duet is a beautiful waltz of Simcoe and Amarillo hop variants- each complementing the deficiencies of the other to near perfection. With just enough sweetness in support, the hops dance on the tongue with delight."

"Taste is moderate sweetness to start, which is quickly overpowered by citrus hoppiness in the middle, and cruises through the close with pine and ample but not overpowering bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Excellent brew, and shows how we can have plenty of hops character and flavor, yet keep the bitterness under control. Bitter is nice, but bitter for bitter's sake gets old. None of that here."

"If I had one word to describe this brew, it would be smooth. This brew rocks, highly drinkable. No date on the bottle, but I can tell the hops have faded and have fallen apart a bit. It's still nice and crisp, just not as strong as I had at GABF. Definitely recommended. I'd love to re-review as fresh as possible."

"The color is a golden California sunset. Extraordinary nose: All sticky weed, grapefruit and a strange, almost Brett-like, hint of eraser. The lightest and most delicate IPA I've ever had. It's utterly refreshing and shockingly not the least bit bitter. This beer is in a whole other realm from your typical swill IPA that dominates American shelves. It's smooth and sophisticated where others are uncouth, bitter bores. Imagine grapefruit without a hint of bitterness; a fresh, warm loaf of sourdough just out of the oven and a fragrant lemon orchard in a glass. Phenomenal."

"Pours a clear bright gold. Nice bubbly head. Smell is amazing. Vibrant tropical fruit. Lots of citrus, all hops. Great. The taste is fruity, only slightly bitter. Grapefruit, citrus, bitter rind. Their is a lemon flavor that is dominating the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, decent carbonation. This is a very juicy ipa, with a lot of lemon flavor. Very nice and smooth."

"The beer is gorgeously clean and easy drinking. Quite a light body on this as it drinks down so easy, yet has tons of hop flavor. Easily one of the best IPAs out there. It’s not a mind blowing beer exactly, but it’s so well constructed and so refreshing. I would love to have this every day."

"Received Duet and Nelson recently and after trying both I was very impressed with Duet. Quickly became one of my favorite beers and has been seeking out more already. Appearance is a lighter golden clean beer. Smell was very fruity and citrusy. Little bits of mango and pineapple come through as well as some grapefruit but the big smell is orange. Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of orange citrus flavor shines. Tasted like someone dropped an orange in my glass. Mouthfeel was smooth and perfectly carbonated. Very good drinkable beer that had me asking for another bomber."
""
"O: One of the better IPAs I have come across. Like previously stated, the amazing balance between the hops and the malts makes Duet stand out. My first beer from Alpine, but definitely going to seek this one out again. Can't wait to open the Pure Hoppiness I have in my fridge..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Holy frig, this is like Sculpin on steroids. Ergo, it's now in my top 5 list for IPAs. This is the kind of beer that makes me want to move to San Diego just so I can consume this like water."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Tastes fantastic. Reminds me a lot of some other IPAs (Blanking on which ones), but it has something to it that has to be experienced first hand, that blows other IPAs out of the water. Alpine delivering a great product here."

"Overall, a really refreshing beer, the highlight being how easy-drinking it is. Definitely one of the smoothest IPAs I can remember. Some of the hop flavor may have fallen off since the bottling, and I'd like to try this fresh one day, but still highly enjoyed and definitely recommended."

"22oz courtesy of peteinSD. Then many other tap pints. Pours a clear light amber/orange with a super rocky, tan head that leaves lacing all over the place. Aroma is outstanding: dank West coast IPA with butterscotch, pineapple, orange juice, orange blossom, mango, lavender/hibiscus. Lots of floral hops. Taste is nicely balanced: super bitterness in the back of the tongue is put in check by butter and tropical fruits up front. Almost soapy, flower pedal, piney/sappy hops all over the place with lots of caramel and butterscotch to balance. This is world-class IPA without a doubt. One of my favorites. When it is fresh, it is unbeatable."

"Amazing ipa. It's no Susan, but one of the best for sure. Thanks for the gift, LaChupacabra! You're an awesome BA!"
""
""

"O: Damn. Really nice IPA, one of the best. Big bitter and drying hop character from beginning to end. Complex and strong hop flavor and aroma. Just enough malt to be noticeable but does not detract. A proper west coast IPA from a master brewer."

"I have drunk a lot of IPA's and even had Pliny the Elder which is considered a top of the line IPA. This IPA was among the best I've ever had; I can honestly say it may be the best. I was traveling in CA and stopped at Stearn's Liquor mart and picked up a bottle of this. This is one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had, yet bitter and a outstanding IPA... if you ever get a chance to get a hold of this IPA I'd advise you to buy it. Only issue with it is that I live in Kentucky and this stuff is made in CA... I need to find a way to get a hold of this stuff here locally."

"Wow, another fantastic IPA from Alpine. Beautiful West Coast hops in a bottle; great balance of weedy pines and tropical fruit. This one's not quite as ""juicy"" as Nelson, and I think I prefer it slightly less, but that's like saying I couldn't go to Harvard and ""settled"" for Yale. Drinking beers like this make me sad I can't readily get them in the Midwest, because this is another truly fantastic and drinkable IPA."

"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be very fresh. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big tropical/citrus hop complexity with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, mango, pineapple, peach, floral, honey, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of citrus/tropical hops; with a good malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hops; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! Tons of big hop complexity and a moderate malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"a beautiful golden/copper pour with 3 fingers of bright white fluffy head giving off ridiculous amounts of lacing while slowly dissipating.. lots of visible carbonation. a really pretty looking beer. the aroma of hops is blowing my mind right now. from a foot or so away i get a huge hit of simcoe, the closer to the nose it gets, i get a nice piney/grapefruity scent.. lots of sweetness/caramel. the flavor is simcoe up front, totally. the second i put the glass down after the first sip, i start tasting sweet malt and start getting floral hop notes and light refreshing grapefruit like citrus. a very nice refreshing ipa and quite honestly very mellow on bitterness for the aromatic hop bomb it is! a lovely beer all around, really happy i got to taste some alpine brews finally. the mouthfeel on this is MADE for summer. highly carbonated, medium body.. refreshing, but not lacking on flavor one bit. this is a damn great ipa."

"This is one of the finest IPAs I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. It figures that it's so hard to get. This was American Craft Beer 2013 pre-fest beer #1. And honestly, it may have been better than anything I actually sampled at ACBF. Curse you, Alpine!"
""
"O - I had higher hopes for this and I think age was an issue with this bottle (no date) after reading the other reviews. I can imagine what this is like fresh, but I didn't get that experience. It still was a great beer, but not world class. Would definitely like to try it fresh some day."

"Overall - This is one of those times where one dimensional is a compliment. Grapefruit citrus blast, no bull."

"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a massive foamy white head on top. There is a bunch of floating particles in this as well. The smell of the beer has a big hoppy fruit aroma. Some sweet pineapple and peach aromas make this beer really nice. The taste of the beer has a slight pine flavor with more fruit flavors like peach and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely balanced and gently carbonated. Overall this is a very good IPA. Really enjoyed this."

"Another nice IPA offering from Alpine, but I'm not 100% sold on this one. At first look and sniff, I thought Duet would be my runaway favorite. It poured beautifully, had a nice color and head, wonderful floral and citrus aromas; unfortunately though, I didn't find it exceptionally balanced, and the resiny finish lingered on my tongue for longer than I prefer."
"Beer pours a slightly hazy gold with a fluffy white head. It's got a really aromatic aroma that has both big floral and citrus notes with a light biscuity malt aroma backing it up. The flavor here is really excellent both the floral and citrus aspects of the nose come through very nice into the flavor, and the malt backbone is just enough to balance the flavor, but very minimal. It's got a little bit of sweetness up front and then has a nice bitter (but not too bitter) hoppy finish. This beer is exceptionally easy drinking! Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a really nice carbonation and something almost sticky about it - impressive. Overall, this is a damn good IPA from Alpine and one of the best single IPAs out there right now. It had been a while since I'd had it last and I'd forgotten just how good it was."

"O - This an amazing IPA. Alpine are the masters of creating amazing IPAs. I would like to do a side-by-side comparison of Duet and Blind Pig as I feel they share a lot of similar qualities. Overall, this is a world class IPA that is easily in my top 10."
"Overall this is incredible, and I would take this over Pure Hoppiness any day. One of the best ""single"" IPAs I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: The thing I love about this beer is that most IPA's beat you over the head with brutal bitterness. This beer has just the right amount of bitterness and big hop flavors without overdoing it. You can easily drink a whole bomber of this beer yourself. Really great complexity from this hop profile. This beer is like hop candy. I am a believer that Alpine has some seriously legendary hoppy beers. Duet is no exception to the statement."
"D: the best part. this stuff lacks so much in the bitterness component and just blasts with fruity hop flavor. totally refreshing and super drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, what a fantastic brew. Certainly one of, it not THE best single IPA Ive ever had. Seek this out, a must try. Very glad I got to try this and can't wait to try to Nelson thats sitting in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
"I dunno if this is a little old or what, but kind of let down on this one. For as much praise as Duet receives, I’ve just got a little above-average IPA here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A somewhat filling IPA, but quite great!"
""
"It's a fantastic IPA worth seeking out."
"Pours translucent honey-golden orange with minimal head that dissipates rapidly. Nose is full of hoppy fruitiness - grapefruit, peach, etc. I want a car air freshener with this scent. Flavor is spot on in terms of the nose. The citrus elements yield to a floral pinkness which is lovely. Little bit of alcohol on the back end which helps to keep the sweetness down. Not an off flavor to be found. Only nitpicking issue found which keeps this from being a perfect IPA is in the mouthfeel - perhaps a bit on the light side. Overall a fantastic West Coast IPA that vies for archetypal status in regards to this style."
""
""
""
"Pours a very clear class golden color with a quickly evaporating white head. Grapefruit nose that draws you in like a Siren. MF is wet and full and accentuates the overall experience of the beer. Grapefruit citrus yields to pine in the flavors that get balanced nearly perfectly by the grain. This is a stupendous IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Duet poured a nice golden color with very little head. A very nice citrus hop nose, very classic west coast smell. Silky smooth mouthfeel, maybe a bit to thin IMHO, but very nice. Well balanced malt sweetness with hop bitterness. This is the second alpine beer I have had and it didn't disappoint. It's extremely easy drinking, and at 7% it's a devil in bottle, in a good way!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Initially I was a bit disappointed that this wasn't more of a hop bomb, but it is such a tasty, easy drinking IPA that it rapidly becomes clear that this is a great beer. Drinkability is off the charts."

"Crisp, smooth taste. Bready, very dry, grassy, hoppy, bitterness is under control. Pretty well balanced for a Single IPA."

"half inch of off white creamy head sits atop of a crystal clear bright copper body. head has good staying power and excellent spider web lacing making abilities. I can smell the floral presence in this beer several feet away. also hints of grapefruit, pineapple and orange with a subtle caramel malt presence. taste is heavenly! more big bright citrus flavors. tastes just like it smells. has a med-lite mouthfeel. carbonation is right, bitterness is just right for me. overall i have nothing bad to say about this beer, but if i had to pick something i would say i can't. love it and you will too, now go get a bottle."
""
"O - A nice beer from Alpine that, while solid, I wished tasted as good as it smeled. The beer thrives on its balance and subtlety and not from strong, in your face flavors"
""
"O- This was definitely a nice IPA that is a little bit different then the typical East Coast IPAs that I'm used to having. It wasn't overly citrusy or hoppy but had a nice lemon hop presence that balanced very well with the sweet malts that provided a smooth very enjoyable IPA. I would definitely recommend trying this and I would love to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably one the nicest Single IPAs I have ever had."
""
""
""

"Medium to light body for a 7% IPA with medium carbonation. The beer is scary drinkable. The flavor profile and overall experience reminds me a bit of PTE. For me, this beer on tap or fresh in bottle, is one of my all time favorite IPA's."
""
"Overall is tops, just a truly great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another amazing IPA from Alpine, it's really flavorful and very easy to drink, excellent stuff."
""
""
"O: Duet is a great IPA that I was thrilled to get to try on tap. I tried to back to back with Nelson and actually liked Nelson a bit more for its raw hoppiness and increased bitterness and complexity. But if I knew I was going to sit down for several hours or an entire evening and both were available, I might have one Nelson and then go with Duet for the rest of the night as it is such a flavorful, dry, easygoing beer."
""
"Drinkability – Pretty good, but a touch too much citrus."
"Some of the above comes across as disappointment, but it's really surprise. I'm surprised at how mild this tastes. It tastes more like a slightly bitter Pale Ale, but smells like a Double IPA. The aroma is great, and the flavor is very palatable. I could drink this all day long."
""
"Overall, this is quite good and is definitely worth trying out."
"O: I enjoyed this one, but it wasn't anything mind blowing. I much much prefer Nelson over this one."
""
"A-"
""
""
""
"O: Beautiful IPA. Really, one of the best balanced I've ever had in this style. Alpine and Kern River are probably some of the least heralded brewers in the country. Bra-effing-vo."
"O: Delicious and very drinkable for 7%. Smooth. I'd drink a lot of this if I lived in San Diego. I'll definitely buy again and have a second. Sarah likes this one a lot!"

"Pours with almost no head on top of a golden clear body. Aroma is really fruity, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, mango. A bit sweet, but fruity sweet not caramel sweet. Lots of citrus, tropics, similarly sweet to the aroma. Nice bitterness that balances a bit of the fruityness and sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice. Unremarkable. Ok carbonation. Pretty nice beer."

"22 oz bomber purchased at the brewery April 6 (yes it was a very Good Friday!) pours a clear medium amber with decent head and lacing. Aroma is thick resin grapefruit, pineapple, and bready malt. Taste is a nice subtle blend of all sorts of fruits - grapefruit, peaches, apples, lemons, etc nicely balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel is fairly light carbonation which is a good thing considering the flavor subtleties, with dry finish. Overall is high quality IPA from a high quality brewery."
""
"This ipa grows on you the more you drink it. A finesse fighter with perfect balance and feel. Doesn't throw hoppy haymakers but draws you in until you submit. Alpine really knows how to craft a hoppy beer, meticulous and expertly built."
"(D)- Definitely an above average IPA, though it was a bit of a letdown when the smell was so great, but the rest of the beer failed in comparison. Nonetheless, a solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O- I found it to be a slightly above average West Coast IPA."
""
"Pours a light golden color with 1 finger of fluffy white head. Boom, the aroma is all over the place. Some definite grapefruit and tropical fruits up front with just a touch of pine behind it. I was expecting more pine from the simcoe hops but this one is very well balanced. The fruitiness really opens up on the nose as the beer warms up, I start to get some peaches and apricots after a while. The taste is more of the same with tons of oily citrus fruits balanced with just enough malt for a dry bitterness and a smooth mouthfeel. Overall a great westcoast IPA, everything I have had from Alpine has been top notch and this one is no different."
""
"O: A very nice IPA. The floral hops are quite nice and an underlying citrus flavor goes well with a low bitterness and moderate sweetness."
""
""
"I have had single hop brews of both of these varieties, but put them together and you get this absolute beast."
""
"Running out of superlatives for this brewery. Another IPA that pretty well epitomises skilful brewing and execution. Works on every level."
""
"I enjoyed it. Not as much as I had hoped, but a beer I would definitely drink regularly if available around here."
""
""
"Cost: $11.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a super large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of pure lupuline with floral notes of citrus and grapefruit. Taste is also dominated by some of the most delicate floral hops aromas I have encountered with fresh citrus notes. Malt base is dry and although discernable doesn’t take away any attention from the hops profile. Body is about average with good carbonation. Those guys are probably my favorite IPA brewers."
""
""
""
"From my haul last week at Alpine. Super fresh having just been bottled. Pours a beautiful yellow orange with a nice one inch thick pale white thick head that clings to my glass leaving intricate lacing as I sip down. The nose is a tropical fruit salad in a glass, mango and pineapple and lemon lead the way before being chased down by the super intensity of the Simcoe and Amarillo hop explosion, just amazing nose. Flavors of tangerine, mango, grapefruit and lemon peel attack the tongue with a balancing act from the malt to deliver an amazingly balanced brew. The mouth is crisp, refreshing and lively from the perfect carbonation, it begs to be gulped, but don't, nurturing this brew brings out a plethora of Flavors and complexities for those who sip. I am an unabashed Alpine head and am in San Diego on a weekly basis on business so I am fortunate to drop in for lunch and refills and get to try a lot of Alpine beer. This along with Nelson, Pure Hoppiness and Exponential Hoppiness are world class ales that I hope all BA folks get a chance to drink at least once."

"I was lucky enough to get this in this years secret santa. I poured from a bomber into a SA perfect pint glass, deep orange pour with a very big white head, some lacing. Lots of fresh pine and citrus on the nose. The beer is piney and has notes of grapefruit, and tropical fruit. It finishes with a light lingering bitterness. The body is medium, above average carbonation. A very good IPA, lived up to the hype."

"Overall, this is a very crisp and refreshing beer. I could easily make this a session beer, and it's so unbelievably balanced. This beer is getting Pliny status from me. Not sure which one I'd choose over the other on any given day."

"WOW, this one stupidly, exciting beer. I am really REALLY loving this thing in smell taste and feel. I have never seen this many exceptional qualities in one beer. I am speechless. 5 minutes... all GONE!"

"Pours a deep golden color with decent head and lace. Nose is grapefruity grapefruit with grapefruit on top of a touch of tropical fruits and a touch of malty goodness. Taste is harmony for sure. Great showcase of two lovely hops. Bitter grapefruit is the lead role, and it reminds me how amazing it is that these flavors come from hops and barley. Doesn't seem out of balance. Medium light body that finishes a little oily. Looks like a lot of other reviewers find it thin, but I think it is quite nice. Very very nice ipa from alpine."

"Pretty awesome balance between hop varieties. Duet is a very fitting name. Once again, Alpine proves to me why they are considered one of the best pale ale producers."

"O: This beer has all my favorite aspects of an IPA. Bitter, crisp, with a dry finish. I could drink this one over and over."
""
""
""
""
"My favorite of the Alpine regular IPA's, but still prefer Hoppy Birthday. I very much enjoy this beer given the chance."
"O – Thank god I like this beer, because I was starting to worry that something was wrong with my palate based on what other say. What I now realize is that the previous attempts to enjoy this beer were with old examples, I hope. This experience is a very good one, one that I hope to repeat again, often. This is a very well-crafted IPA utilizing two of my favorite hop varieties. Will definitely seek this out again."
"O - Overall an excellent beer. One that I'm looking forward to trying again."
"O: I love Alpine. Literally. Having just visited their brewery outside of San Diego, I can honestly say that it holds a special place in my beer-filled heart. And like all of their beers I've had the pleasure of quaffing, Duet is simply beautiful. This is a one of the best AIPA's around, and something I hope all of you BA's get a chance to encounter firsthand. It's amazing what a few good folks can do with water, grains, hops and yeast."
"Alpine Duet pours a crystal clear orange, with plentiful tangerine highlights. The white foam that serves as a crown to the beer draws itself up to about three fingers in height. Head retention and lacing are both solid, bu neither one is impressive at all. The nose is a good blend of pineapple/mango tropical fruit flavors and a big of citrusy grapefruit. Amarillo is definitely in the lead here, and the Simcoe hops, which I don't always get along with, manage to play a nice supporting role. The flavor has just a bit of malty caramel sweetness up front to keep things intereting. There's a solid bit of bitterness mid palate, which segues into the grapefruit aspect of the hop flavor profile. There's a big wave of tropical fruit next, before a subtle orange flavor sneak in on the close. The mouthfeel is solid, dry bodied and with a bubbly carbonation. Duet is a very good IPA, and it speaks volumes to Alpine's prodigious talent at brewing hoppy beers that this is only my third favorite such beer from them."
"Cheers..."
"Overall - lovely IPA. One of my favorites."
"SkÅL!"
"D-Overall this was a good IPA. Nothings super special about it. I would def drink it again but wouldn't seek it out. Very good ipa but just very 1 dimensional and nothing that sets it apart. Still very good."
"Overall a near perfect IPA IMO. Lovely character, flavor and balance. Another amazing beer from an amazing brewery."
"I would drink this beer all the time if it was available to me...a fantastic example of the style.."
"Pours a light yellow with a two finger head that sits on top of the 16oz line on the glass. As the head crawls back into the beer a thick ring of lace coats the sides of the glass. Smell mellow citrus hops and bread from the malts. Taste is very malty with a bitter back bone that stings the tongue a bit. This has a great crisp finish and is an easy drinker. Perfect levels of carbonation. Overall a great IPA and a great combo of hops used in this beer. It is a shame Alpine isn't readily available here."
"Good brew. I am a bit disappointed considering the hops, but would recommend Duet to hopheads everywhere to draw their own conclusions."
"O - Despite my comment on being one dimensional, this is an exceptional beer."
"Verdict: Just as good as I remember it to be, it really is one of the premier West Coast IPAs. The balance of flavors is superb, truly celebrating hops in all their glory. Alpine has proven again and again that hoppy beers are their forte and this is no exception, a masterclass."
"I like Duet better than Pure Hoppiness. It's less bitter, but more cohesive flavorwise. Very potent and dank with the hops, but it doesn't get tiresome on the palate. Easy to drink if you love IPAs."
"O: A good IPA, though the hop character isn't my favorite and I'd prefer more malt (not necessarily sweetness) and more clean and crisp."
"Overall: Another very good west coast IPA. I would say that the taste of the finish is the weak point of this beer, but it's still fantastic. Definitely want to have again."
"O: Good overall package, nothing exceptional or mind blowing, but a good interpretation of the style."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied, high carbonation, very smooth and drinks very nicely for an IPA. Overall, a pretty solid IPA. Very good, clean flavors with no alcohol tinge. Wasn't completely wowed, but found it to be very nice."
"O- Very good IPA. Well balanced honey malts and hops."
"Overall, awesome. Just awesome."
"O: This was different than I expected but I really got to appreciate it after a few sips. This is really well brewed showing that they arent just trying to make the most extreme IPA, rather a refined well executed one. The flavor hangs around without feeling like you scraped your tastebuds off. This is dangerously drinkable."
"Overall this is a GREAT IPA and a very good beer. If I were to give some newbie an IPA, this would be it. I think that's because it's not as dry and bitter as some IPAs can be. This is a sweeter IPA. The hop profile is one of my favorites thus far. If Duet is a true representation of Simcoe and Amarillo hops, than those are varieties I will be on the look out for. Great brew. Cheers!"
"O-Alpine makes such wonderfully balanced IPA's, this one is no different. I feel like Duet does a great job of showcasing how great the Simcoe and Amarillo hops can taste. This is easily in my top ten IPA's. Seek it out."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with two fluffy fingers of white head that left a nice sticky lacing. Nose is full of tropical and citrus scented hops - pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Moderate bitterness with tons of sweet, citrus, almost dank hop flavor. A light, sweet cracker type flavor comes through from the malt when you look for it. It really is all about the hops though, as the dominate the beginning, middle and end of each sip in a supremely pleasant way. No major ups and downs, just a nice solid bitterness and strong hop flavor all throughout. A low to moderate carbonation complements a slightly less than medium body with a nice sticky, dry finish. This beer drinks incredibly easily. If I lived closer this one would be a staple in the fridge. Thanks Dane!"
"Based on the recent recommendations I have heard on this brewery and them making a better IPA than Russian River, I was disapointed. I still seek something that can live up to PtE; I will have to try some of their other offerings. In its own right, it is good, but not in my top in class list."
"Pours a clear, light golden color with a cap of nice white foam; minimal lacing and so-so retention. The smell is a flowery aroma, and as it warms, a dose of sweet caramel malt, blood orange, and milder citrus. The taste is beautiful flowery and pine on the back end, and again sweetish red orange and caramel malt. This tastes amazing. Medium body, and the light carbonation is spot on. Overall, an exceedingly drinkable and delicious IPA; it would be hard to improve on this."
"One of my top three IPA's along with Just Outstanding and Sculpin."
"O- Everything I have come to expect from Alpine. On point. Highly recomended."
"O-I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this IPA...I found it to be complex in its entireity yet simple in its parts. I would love to have it again sometime."
"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is OUTSTANDING! Lovely tropical and piney hop notes with some nice citrus hints. The hoppiness in the nose is just so distinct with a hint of burnt malt. Taste just explodes with clean and fresh hop flavors with a solid malt backbone. Not enough to make this any short of an amazing west-coast style IPA, but just enough to know it's there. The tropical fruits really come out in the Simcoe and Amarillo hops used. Finishes with bittering hops and melon flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied...creamy yet refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is awesome. Very tasty and drinkable with no detection of 7% ABV. Alpine just knows how to make IPAs, that's all there is to it."
"D - Very drinkable. Definitely hop-forward but there is enough other flavors to provide some balance. The hop profile is really nice from start to finish."
"-Cheers"
"A fantastic, super-hoppy IPA. I just wish there was more of this to stock up on."
"Pours a golden straw color with about two inches of bubbly, white head with a frothy appearance to the superior surface. Monstrous quantities of wet, gob-like lacing is left in it's wake. This is how an IPA should look. It smells of honey, grapefruit, piney hops, lemon, some orange, and a bit of straw. Great nose! The taste certainly keeps up with this already tremendous brew, consisting of piney hops in the front, lemon, orange, and some grapefruit citrus in the middle, and a bit of honey and caramel in the rear. Very well done. The mouth is superior; a bit of a bitter finish, but an otherwise smooth, velvety texture from perfect carbonation. The finish is flawless, not leaving a sticky film in my mouth or frantically searching for my next glass of water; just a very content palatal sensation. A phenomenal IPA that I will actively search for again."
"Light, crisp and refreshing. A damn fine single IPA. Doesn't overreach, but also delivers on hop goodness. Nicely done."
"Overall: I dont want to beat a dead horse here but like I said earlier I am not a fan of this here IPA. I did not care at all for the flavor profile or the smell of the beer the two things I am most interested in when drink a beer."
"O: Another great Apline brew, starting to think THEY make the best line of IPAs on the plan"
"O: I’ve seen a lot of beers described as a “Hophead’s Dream” or something along those lines. This beer takes that prize without so much as a breath of self-proclaimed hop mastery. It’s great. Classy brewery, classy beer. A very drinkable, very admirable brew."
"O: Very nice IPA"
"O- There is nothing about this beer i did not like. Much lighter and crisper than the East Coast IPA's I am used to. I actually drank this on the same night I had a Sculpin and it matched up well which is saying alot."
"O - An outstanding IPA."
"O: This is a tricky one to do. The flavors are all so familiar (if not even a bit cliche), but they are just so well done. Many beers taste like sun kissed citrus, but few connote the depth of sun drying and natural honeys. The flavors are soft, and this never approaches being a juice bomb. However, the balance is really something to behold. Not only is this balanced, but the point at which all the elements intersect is the land of magic. This one could be overlooked because of the familiar flavors, but this is a rare treat. Furthermore, the sessionability of this brew is beyond reason. This one is addictive, and will disappear from your glass while you try to figure out its more subtle notes."
"O: I've had duet a few times now and the first couple of times I was convinced it might very well be the best beer ever made. I've had a lot of IPAs/DIPAs since then, and I'll still say that Duet is probably the best single IPA I've ever had, though it's likely tied with Nelson. This beer is delicious, but I'm no longer so sure it deserves to be very near or on top of things like Kern 5th or Pliny. Regardless, easily one of the top 5 IPAs/DIPAs I've had. This beer is amazingly refreshing, enamoring, and delicious. A delight to drink and a tragedy to finish- you must try it!"
"O - This is probably my favorite singe IPA. Hoppy as all hell, and a light crisp finish is perfect for a hot day."
"M- Nice medium body, good carbonation, and nice finish for a big IPA."
"Overall a great example of a hoppy West Coast IPA. If they really only used the two hop varieties, which I'm assuming they did from the description on the bottle, then they couldn't possibly have utilized them any better. Well done Alpine! On future trips to the Left Coast, I will look for more of your beers. I also have a bottle of Nelson on hand...can't wait to try it."
"O- pretty solid brew, liked it more than the Nelson I had yesterday"
"O (D) - a super solid IPA. not the diacetyl bomb it was last time i tried this."
"EDIT: had another bottle. Muuuch better. Scores have been boosted to reflect this."
"O- Totally awesome brew. Very stellar and highly recommended."
"Duet is a deep golden color with three fingers of rocky white foam on top. Head recedes leaving a thin coaster and decent lacing. The nose is big citrus notes. Grapefruit, mango and mandarin oranges present themselves. Pale malt hovers in the background and a bit of pine can be detected as well. Taste is an explosion of fruity, citrus hops backed by sugar cookie malt. Pine enters mid palate with a medium level of hoppy bitterness. Finish is dry with a mild, lingering bitterness. Feel is medium wih a great level of carbonation making this very easy drinking and refreshing. Overall Alpine hits another one out of the park with this one! A well balanced, refreshing, super drinkable IPA that showcases flavors of citrus and pine in the west coast style. Recommended."
"Scores: Appearance 4/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"Thanks again Brian!"
"Overall: I like this, but Columbus, OH has better imo."
"O: Good IPA, a bit on the bitter side yet pretty drinkable for its 7% ABV."
"Really well crafted, complex beer. It has a light-side of medium body, which helps this guy be really drinkable. My dream is to one day have this beer available to me fresh, constantly."
"Nice looking beer, golden copper color but poor head retention. Slight clinging lace, but it's spotty at best. Aroma is a familiar Amarillo simcoe blend. Flowery and fruity, grapefruit, some pineapple, citrus very nice and refreshing, it just doesn't blast you with aroma though. Very fruity ipa. Flavor balances bitter and malty. Nice flavorful hop blast right off the bat, juicy, fruity in the middle and then a wave of buttering hops. Clean yeast profile. Nice weight on the palate. I'll be trading for this again."
"O - Anoter winner from Alpine."
"Narrative: No one thought that Ray Chalmers, simple citrus farmer would make it all the way to the Juice Olympics. They mocked his blood orange and mandarin fusion, blaked at his grapefruit/kiwi hybrid and informed him that tangelo had not place in the world of serious Citrusites. ""AND THE WINNER OF THE GOLD MEDAL IS:"" Ray's hands shook with fatigue, dripping with citric acid on his nail beds. How many seeds had he sewn? How many fruits were bisected? He would wipe his brow if not for the stinging juice covering his forearms. ""THE WINNER IS RAY RAY RAY"" He startled ""RAY! RAY! RAY! Get back on the valencia line, these oranges aren't gonna pack themselves and I don't have the time for you and your lazy day dreaming!"" Sure, the Del Monte fruit packing line was not Juice Olympics, but who would want to win a fictional event like that ANYWAY?"
"Cheers!"
"Snoogens!"
"O- A very good tasting beer. The tropical fruit hop taste is very refreshing. On a sad not I spilled about 10 oz of the 22 oz on the ground because I placed the beer on an uneven surface. Needless to say I felt pretty stupid and bad about it because that was the last Duet at the store near my house."
"Overall - A fantastic beer, perfect for a hot summer day. This beer is the definition of summer for sure."
"O – It was a fairly long drive into the middle of nowhere to get to Alpine, and the guy there was a bit of a dick, but this beer seems to make it worth it. A solid brew by a company new to me – this is the first from them I have had and now have my expectations set high."
"O: Another impressive beer from Alpine. Amazingly drinkable with a great, intense flavor profile. More please!"
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day --every day. I have been drinking hopslam alot in the past week and i actually can say i prefer this more than this years hopslam. I have had hopslam from the beginning 6 years ago and this years although good i think i like this session worthy beer much better and look forward to the case of bottles i bought. Can't wait to try the Pure Hoppiness I got along with the Duet."
"As I've sipped my way through a bomber I'm increasingly impressed by how easy it is to drink, given the intensity of the flavor. A very nice IPA indeed."
"[Edit: I have had Duet like 5 more times in the last year and it is a really good beer, but somewhat inconsistent. I have to knock it a bit because it is not always a 4.5 beer]"
"Overall there are not enough good things to be said about this beer, in my opinion. Definitely the best single IPA that I have tried."
"O - A little old but still quite enjoyable. I hope to have this one on-tap at the source some day. Maybe my next trip to SoCal??"
"the CPJ"
"O - Nice, tropical IPA, full-flavored and delicious. I'm beginning to think I'm really missing out, not having access to Alpine, they make some great beer."
"O: very complex for being 7% abv.. very impressed again with Alpine."
"Overall - It's fantastic. It's like Hopslam, but a better hop presence and it's not overly alcoholic. If I had my way and there was just a bit more malt to it, it would be about 8% instead of 7%. At 7%, it's so drinkable it's scary. I hope I can get another bottle of this."
"O: Another great IPA from Alpine. Each one has been unique and impressive in their own way. Duet, in my opinion, was a very successful take on a dual hop beer. In the end it exhibited much more complexity and depth of flavor than I thought it would."
"I can dig it. Not excellent but I would like to revisit (perhaps on tap someday). I could go for more of a spicy kick. Regardless, worth a shot."
"Overall this was a very good beer and I have to say that my long anticipated first Alpine brew did not disappoint. The only criticism that I could offer is that I might have liked a bit more Amarillo or maybe some darker malts to add a bit more complexity but that’s just my personal preference."
"It was great to finally try something from Alpine, but I'm not sure what was going on here. Maybe I need to revisit another bottle at another time, but right now - this seemed to be very weak, (almost) flavorless and off."
"Overall: as far as hard to get WCIPAs go, I'd say I prefer this over a Sculpin, and at a dollar less, is one of the few IPA bombers I'd consider over-paying for again and again."
"With a solid pour you get about a finger of just off white foam, majority medium to larger bubbles with below average retention, runs down to the surface quickly, the lacing sticks in random splotches more than streaks. The liquid has a zinc orange metallic look to it, much closer to yellow than any red, no cloudiness, a few trace bubbles here or there, consistent down to the glass bottom. Hop-driven nose of pretzel dough, salt, pine cone, herbaceous matter and earth, gets right up in there and starts scrubbing, plenty of brawn in the grapefruit to blood orange scents too, not a lot of fruit, mixed white pit fruit, thin dusting of cocoa powder accounts for the presence of malts. Close to full-bodied with a noticeably firm mouth feel, the carbonation has the grit of semi-fine sandpaper, persistent from mouth entry through finish. The tangy white grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus zings your tongue alongside the pine, iron flecks, pepper and salt bits. Were the total experience more “wet” the peach, nectarine, apple fruit might appear more tropical. Cocoa, mocha accents dry themselves, offers some yeast to multigrain bread dough. About as “chewy” as a regular IPA can get, not really an easy sipper but deserves attention for achieving personality."
"Golden, clear, lots of carbonation. The head is a white, fluffy, medium long lived, and leaves lots of lace in its wake. Aroma is predominately grapefruit, then caramel, finally a bit of grassiness. Despite the visible carbonation, the feel is on the soft side with a tongue coating medium-heavy body. The front is a bit salty with the middle through finish a crescendo of moderately citrus flavored hops and caramel malt. Leans a tad toward the dry side."
"O- This is another amazing IPA coming out of Alpine Beer Company, truly refreshing, reminds me of PTE but not as smooth. An amazing smaller brother to EH and Pure Hoppiness."
"D-this is a rather drinkable IPA with a nice light bitterness and strong balance. Enough doughy malts and sticky caramel to balance an assertively hopped beer. There is a lack of subtly and an aggression in the flavors that make it slightly flabby but still very good stuff."
"O: this is an excellent and well balanced IPA. I would recommend anyone who is into West Coast IPAs to give this one a try."
"Overall is an amazing IPA I would try again and again."
"Another winner from Alpine."
"Definitely a nice balanced and crisp hop blast that drinks quite easily."
"Good stuff, I liked it better than Pure Hoppiness."
"Really good, but perhaps not as good as I had hoped."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest, lively level of carbonation. A pleasant experience and well rounded ipa. The 7% abv hits hard in this brew, it provides a spicy, lightly burning fusel incorporation to the flavor and a solid amount of warmth all the way down the throat. For an IPA that only includes 2 hop varieties, this brew is deep and complex with hop flavoring and aromas. It is a testament to brewers that you don't have to go crazy with ridiculously complex variations of multiple hops to produce a deeply complex and enjoyable layering of flavors and aromas. Well done, of the 3 ipas offerings from Alpine I have had, all of them are stellar."
"T: It's not as ""big"" as some of Alpine's other IPAs, but this is really good. Nice pine hop flavors along with a biscuity maly backbone. The hops don't leave a lasting aftertaste and the result is you feel like you could drink this one forever."
"Thanks to walows for the extra! Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into a dimpled mug. Pours a bright orange color along with a nice creamy head that quickly dissipates, good lacing that lasts throughout the session. Moderate malt and hop aromas of light bread and caramel, flowers, spruce, grapefruit, orange, light yeast, and perhaps a background note of sour milk on the last pour. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is medium, oily with a lively carbonation and lightly astringent and dry finish. The combination of the two hops (Simcoe and Amarillo) bring out some excellent aromas that give Duet a great name! This went very well with my sausage and mushroom pizza."
"Overall I REALLY, REALLY liked this one. I have had Pure Hoppiness and Exponential, it is very obvious this is the little brother to those two. Everyone needs to find a trading partner in California and get some!!!"
"D- Overall, an incredibly well-balanced brew that satisfies with every sip, but never satiates. I definitely need to drink this more often."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with an immense 4 inch head that settles into a plateau of foam. I had to pour this beer and wait for the head to settle a few times before I got a decent glass. Thick globs of lattice lacing all over the glass on the drink down. Smells of fresh citrus zest, tropical fruit, sweet malt. Tastes of citrus zest, tropical fruits, sweet malt, and a slight touch of honey. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation on this beer. A bit coating in the mouth. Overall, a very good IPA and a solid offering from Alpine."
"Drinkability is very solid. ABV is moderate and there isn't any alcohol taste that comes through so I could really dig having this one around more often. I will look for this on again."
"Thanks Imagese for the hook up on this one!"
"Overall this is a great ipa. So tasty and it is really great. Smell is crazy good. The taste is a very balanced bitter bomb, if that is possible. My first beer from Alpine and it is a great one"
"This and Pure Hoppiness are very good IPA's."
"O - REALLY outstanding beer. Flavors are all great and really stand out as a great American IPA. A must try for the hop heads out there."
"Pours a beautiful burnt orange with two fingers of head that quickly leaves. The nose has toffee with hints of tropical fruit and pine. The taste hints of pineapple and coconut with a bitter backbone of grapefruit and orange rindw, well balanced by mildly sweet malts. The fruit is quickly swept away by a refreshing bitterness that lingers nicely. A wonderful example of an IPA that is a notch below my all time favorite sculpin. A must try and if i could get more i would drink it often. Purchased at citybeer in SF."
"This is a solid, hoppy, semi malty bready tasty IPA. Any time you have a chance to get any Alpine beer, get it."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a flavorful more balanced IPA that is on the sweeter side but not so much that it finishes very clean. This is a must try if you are an IPA fan. Another outstanding beer from Alpine!"
"D: Not sure how many of these I could finish. This bomber won't be an issue, though. Great work, Alpine."
"Light bodied and decently carbonated makes the beer very refreshing. Little to no aftertaste on the tongue, very clean finish that only leaves a bit of floral aroma in your mouth. Very easy to drink, an IPA I don't mind finish a bomber of as it doesn't just blast your tongue with dryness."
"D: I am not sure I can get enough of this beer. It is absolutely delicious. Not a typical West Coast by any means - too sweet. However, you should try this."
"Fuller medium body, a bit creamy, decent carbonation, somewhat dry as well. Near invisible alcohol, solid flavor, and definitely something I'd drink again. I should have no problem finishing off the rest of this bomber."
"Poured into my Dfh snifter, about 2 fingers of light white frothy head that hangs around forever! Almost transparent clean orange color. Nice retention, a little lacing on the glass. Smell- huge pine, bitter citrus, terpentine? Love it! Big aromas have me very excited about this beer. Taste- the pine needle flavor instantly greets me, along with a nice bittersweet malt finish. There is a lot going on here, and I can taste a duality of hops types playing here. Love the creativity. Mouthfeel- this has a creamy silky mouthfeel. Drinkability- I am instantly depressed that I can't drink this anytime I want."
"Drank it fairly quick, but as it warmed the butteriness became more evident."
"This is a great rendition of IPA. Hopheads must seek this out!"
"D: A quality, easy drinking IPA, though, nothing that would warrant putting this one into the top tier either."
"The duet is a decent alpine ipa. They have so many that it is hard to say which is best, this is not the best but it isn't the worst. Popes a deep golden color with a white head. It has a sweet piney smell with hints if yellow fruits. The taste is pIne hops with a sweet caramel edge. Malt backbone to this one and it is pleasant to drink. All in all it is very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice deeper yellow with white head. Smell of citric fruits (grapefruit, orange, lemon zest). There is a bit of spiciness but I can't put my finger on it. Taste about the same, with the fruitiness on the forefront, grapefruit, tangerine, orange. There is some bready maltiness to it but it is weak. The mouthfeel is thin and slightly over carbonated. I think the thinness of the mouth detracted from the overall complexity of the beer. Easy enough to drink, just a touch uninteresting."
"What the hell happened to this bottle? Someone please send me another!"
"Dangerously delicious beer. California continues to amaze me with their IPA's. Each one is better then the next."
"Duet has a smooth, oily slick mouthfeel - viscous for a single IPA. A lot of the characteristics of this beer approach a DIPA, except perhaps the ABV. Great balanced flavor makes this really easy to throw back. But then again, it's Alpine, you expect them to be this good."
"Update 1/16/2010. Just had my second bottle of this and it is quickly moving up my charts of the best IPAs on the planet. This beer is so damn good my head is spinning. So elegant, hoppy, fruity, drinkable and just so damn delicious. Wow, I'm blown away. What a beer."
"D: Very easy to drink, smooth and delicious. I liked some of the other Alpine IPA's a little better, but this was solid as well, and for $8, I'd be drinking it all the time if it were available in the midwest."
"Wow. Of the three excellent Alpine IPAs that I tried, this is my favorite. Hops, hops, and more hops without being extremely bitter or overdone. Alpine makes some great hoppy beers."
"Overall - One of my favorite IPAs. Such a beautiful beer. Cheers!"
"Me gusta."
"This beer pours a golden color with a white head that had medium level retention and left some lacing. There is a big grapefruit hop explosion off the nose and the hops explode in your mouth as well. It's got lost of hops but is quite sweet with some piney bitter finish. Good carbonation in a medium bodied beer that is really easy to get down. I would like some more of this."
"Another exemplary offering from an up and coming IPA heavy line up from Alpine."
"Drinkability:This is an amazing IPA, full of great west coast hop aromas and flavors. It's easy drinking, and quite delightful."
"Very good beer, I love nearly everything about it. My one gripe is the lack of a malt presence. By the end of the bottle the citrusy hops became too much and bordered on cloying. A slight pale malt flavor would have evened things out remarkably well. I had to score drinkability down because of this. Awesome beer, would not hesitate to pick up again."
"Notes: Damn, Alpine makes my kind of IPAs. Really easy drinker for IPA fans, and a really nice showcase of tropical fruit/citrus flavors and aromas. Highly recommended!"
"Some will surely like this one for its nice flavor profiles. Unfortunately, this is one of the few brews I've tasted where the mouthfeel simply ruined it for me."
"I wonder if this still only has Simcoe and Amarillo hops in it, this tastes awfully dank and herbal for those two hops alone, or perhaps the crop they used was fairly different from what I am used to. Definitely a hop lovers IPA, my personal preference wishes that more of the bright fruit character from the Amarillo hops came through, but this certainly serves up a needed hop fix right quickly."
"The taste isnt as sweet at the smell but is still a great sweetness to bitterness ratio. Bitter at first with a smooth very sweet finish. Slightly dry but not as much as a lot of IPA's"
"OVERALL: A really enjoyable and flavorful IPA. Very unique as well; it had some definite English EBS characteristics that worked well with the IPA base. A slightly oilier finish would have helped the palate somewhat, but this was still a very enjoyable beer I'd gladly have again. Cheers Mulder1010."
"Poured hard into reidel snifter. Nice head and lacing straw yellow. Smell was a little dusty and some citrus. Taste was deffinitely grapefruit. Mouthfeel was good, lots of carbonation. Will drink more of these. Found this a wades wines in westlake. cheers"
"D - Goes down pretty good could I session this...another great IPA from Alpine."
"Drinkability is good."
"Awesome!! If you are a ""Hop Head""? You will Love this beer. Hops plus more hops plus another dosage of hops!! Glorious hop flavor and Glorious aroma! Did I mention awesome hoppiness galore? This an A+ IPA no doubt baby! It reminds me of Sculpin from Ballast."
"Drinkability: I really like the more balanced IPAs with more malt, so that would be my main criticism. Also, can they try to keep the head in the glass?"
"-my favorite of the alpine IPA's...although i have not had expo yet"
"D: A very hop forward brew, this is a great representation of a west coast IPA even though its not my personal favorite. Robust bitter taste with a clean, crisp feel. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for an enamel-peeler!"
"Drink- I liked this a lot. A nice sessionable IPA that would work well in a six pack for me."
"D: I need another bomber, now."
"D: A very juicy flavored IPA. This one packs more flavor than some DIPAs I've had. I could drink this all day long. Another amazing beer from a great brewery!"
"I'm very happy with this beer as a representative of west coast IPA. Excessively drinkable. 22oz. bomber and could have had one or two more!"
"D - Pretty solid well balanced IPA. However the aroma on this one had me ready to proclaim a new IPA favorite. The taste fell a bit short but it's still a solid beer. I'm certainly glad to have tried this one and wouldn't mind drinking more of it. Though I don't think I'd go nuts seeking it out."
"from a bomber pours a hazy peach sunset color with a staying beige head and nice clinging lacing on the glass..smell is topical with mango and pineapple its mixed with citrus and pine hops ....tasty malts are in the background..taste is superb Amarillo and simcoe hops together make for a tropical hop profile that is just delicious it also has pine and grapefruit resins..sweet caramel malts round out the hops..mouthfeel is perfect for the style it fills the taste buds with loads of hops but never bitter just smooth drinkable and delicious..this is west coast this is a delicious ipa..one of my favorites"
"D: Who wants to send me some more Alpine IPAs?"
"Hazy peach orange body with a large white head appears a beautifully with layers of lacing between sips. Aroma is heavy on the grapefruit and leafy earth and floral aspects, a fruity zesty grapefruit tone with hints of rolling malts. Flavor of duet highlights Amarillo and Simcoe hops battling it out, juicy malt sweetness adds on a nice flavor mix with the super hoppy West Coast IPA tones. Grapefruit, herbal mint, floral tones on the palate. only on the west coast good a grop of people adjust to hoppy delicious beer like this. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, slick hop oils caue this to guide across the palate, medium bodied soft even carbonation. Drinkability overall is rock solid another awesome west coast experience as far as IPAs go, these malts blend nicely a touch of knowing diacetyl actually works once in awhile it doesn't taste bad at all in this case."
"Mouth feel is smooth and slightly oily. Light carbonation. Drinkability is high since this isn't excessively bitter or overly sweet. A solid IPA."
"Bottle, thanks Craig. Pours a medium orange with a fluffy white head. Nose is floral, bright, and juicy. Hopes express themselves as pine with light light citrus elements. Bright and expressive mouth, more tropical fruits than citrus, light pine needles, floral. Nose is amazing on this. Soft. Not highly bitter, which I like, with some nice sugar interplay there. White grapefruit that doesn't become abrasive at all, mangoes, wonderful combination there. This is a pretty elite IPA, but if I must nitpick there's an odd discordant flavor that hangs around on the back palate, as an odd bitterness. Very nice stuff."
"This is a well-balanced, floral hoppy ale that is light-bodied and quite refreshing. Eminently drinkable."
"Bitter, finishes dry, nicely carbonated. The hops have a somewhat oily feel to them. Too bad this is not available in Minnesota, because I could get used to drinking this on a regular basis. Thankfully South Bay Drugs ships."
"D: A very enjoyable citrus IPA. Really drinkable considering its a 7%. I like Odell's IPA and Sculpin a scosche more but I enjoyed it more than Nelson. Definitely will have again, hopefully on tap. Both are amazing IPAs from such a small brewery. I hope that they increase production and produce 6 packs in the future."
"D- Very easy to drink and absolutely no trace of alcohol, awesome job Alpine I enjoyed this more than Pure Hoppines..."
"D: Very Great IPA, up there with the greats in the single IPA realm for me. Wish I could get this whenever I wanted to, but hey it makes having these really special too."
"D: it drank very good with a decent hop profile and a very nice fruit flavor to accommodate the overall taste. Once again alpine comes through with a great west coast style IPA."
"Drinkability: Despite the overcarbonation, this is still right up there among the top flight examples of the west coast IPA style"
"D - Almost perfect drinkability. Very approachable but delicious IPA. Alpine does it again not as good as Pure Hoppiness but very close."
"D - Excellent. Clean, bitter, hoppy. Not balanced, but raw, outstanding hoppiness in a glass. Absolutely outstanding!"
"A very solid and nicely balanced IPA. Very enjoyable; too bad it is so pricey in the bottle."
"Would certainly be one of my go to's if I lived in the area."
"Overall, this is a friggen damn good IPA. Not so sure I would rate it as high as many people seem to, but it certainly was a treat. Classic 1-2 punch of simcoe and amarillo, I think I would really like to blind taste-test this and Sculpin. Right now I would say I prefer Sculpin, but it would be interesting to try them back-to-back."
"This beer is superbly drinkable. I could drink the hell out of this! Super high drinkabilty."
"D: Another great one from Alpine."
"Great IPA. Right up my alley"
"M/D- medium bodied, good strong carbonation. overall pleasing beer. no alcohol picked up throughout the experince."
"Thanks got to Grant for obtaining this growler. Thanks! I really enjoyed this one! I generally really like Alpine's brews, and this one is no exception, in fact I thought this was fantastic. Pours a dark golden with a medium head that is pure white and leaves some great lacing. Not bad from a growler. The smell is a clean burst of pine- like walking into a pine forest after a spring rain. There is just enough clean, sweet, honeyed malt to balance the beautiful pine aromas. Perfect for me in the flavor department. Beautifully balanced with a blast of sweet pine and a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, sweet, and slightly spicy. Classic beer, really, really drinkable- I could drink these all night. Wonderful! I also really like the way that Alpine's IPAs and doubles each display a different hop note/mix- they don't at all taste the same. Great brewery!"
"Not bad overall but I wasn't as big of a fan of this one as some others have been... A nice beer I guess..."
"Drink>good"
"Might try to keep and eye out for a fresher bottle of this, but not my favorite Alpine beer"
"Bottle. Light copper color with a 1 finger head that quickly dissapates. Nice collar. Floral and malty notes in the aroma. Citrus as well. More malt forward in the taste than I would expected but the back end really has a nice hop bite. Very crisp. Pretty tasty IPA."
"Great beer, but somehow not top-shelf by Alpine's standards. Their fault for setting the bar so damned high."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable. I anxiously look forward to having it again."
"Good IPA and one I would recommend to try"
"Great beer, my (i think both of our) clear favorite of the night."
"Consumed : 8/4/2010"
"d - I enjoyed this one a lot. I thought it was a very easy to drink IPA with some nice pine and citrus to it. There was no bitterness to it. Would like to try again."
"Drinkability -- Not a hop bomb, nor any other. Just a well-crafted, pitch-perfect IPA. This is an ideal warm weather IPA: crisp, a bit dry, and a bit lighter in body. If these were distributed near me, I'd drink this on a regular basis."
"This beer is extremely drinkable for a hoppy IPA, the balance and finish is exceptional. This was easily the most refreshing IPA I have ever had. I am glad I got to try this super fresh and it the top of its game. Top notch IPA."
"Drinkability - The lack of a giant dry finish keeps this IPA going down like water. This is easily one of the smoothest most drinkable ""big hop"" IPAs that I've ever had."
"4.0 D: Another great beer. This is definitely better than the Nelson in terms of taste, but the mouthfeel could use a little work. Otherwise, very drinkable."
"d-good not great. i prefer nelson for sure but this is pretty good. that little funky taste was the turning point for me. it distracted from the other good notes, maybe i got a goofy bottle."
"Fresh quality IPA that is just a cut above most others of the same style."
"Picked this up at Lone Hill in Glendora?? or east of LA. This is a great beer, not to be a rude rude in any way but this is a simple IPA, but very well made. These guys have the over the top DIPA's, but it's great when they can bring it back to the basics and make a solid West Coast IPA that you can drink for days. This may be one of the most balanced IPA's i've had in the last few years, nothing over the tops on hops, nothing to boozy at 6+%. very highly recommended."
"Drinkability is great. Alcohol isn't a factor at all and the fact that the hop flavors aren't harsh made it an easy drinker. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and its a very crisp beer. Great for a summer day."
"D: Alcohol is hidden well and I find this to be a quite refreshing beer! Highly drinkable!"
"D: Too easy, it won't be hard to have a few more of these tonight. Excellent, excellent beer."
"An education in these hop varieties. Drinkable with steak and potatoes, but a tough quaff by itself."
"Immense hop amount never fades to the end. Yum. $8 a bomber, a little pricey, but otherwise, the drinkability soars."
"Overall a nice fruity IPA. Glad I got to try it."
"Light easy drinking, not overly complex with a good malt presence with moderate sweetness. Toffee rich bready with some cereal grain. Mango and papaya are the two main fruit components with some floral flavors on the finish. Light and quaffable."
"D: Overall just your run of the mill IPA, nothing about it made me think ""wow this is special, unique, or great"" Not that it's terrible, but Duet is by far my least favorite of the Alpine IPAs at our tasting. I really don't think this deserves to be anywhere close to the top 100."
"D - It's a good IPA that has a great level of drinkability for what it is. I like the lingering bitterness to it that doesn't have a super-strong kick."
"A highly drinkable beer that is complex on the nose and smooth on the tongue with a pleasant bitter finish. On its own, the taste doesn't live up to the nose but it pairs very well with spicy foods. I'd prefer the citrus/fruity side of the beer so I'd recommend drinking this one as cold as possible or with food."
"D - The thinness of this beer makes it quite drinkable. The only limitation to the drinkability is the painful intensity of the pine hops that overwhelm any other flavors in the beer."
"A nice west coast style IPA again, lots of nice fresh hops, and tasty. Just lacking a little in the body and malt department for my tastes at least, but def worthy."
"D - quite drinkable, has the hop bitterness of a West Coast IPA but a great balance of sweet hops and light malts. went down quite easy."
"Overall, this was one of the best IPAs I've ever had and shows that you don't need to be a huge hop bomb to make a fantastic beer. Wish I had access to Alpine more regularly."
"The palate opens with a prominent bitterness, clean and zesty with grapefruit and pineapple. The hop bill leans towards Amarillo, reminding me of the Stone IPA in certain ways. Hilariously dry, there's no real malt character to speak of. This is all about the hops with the balance leaning more towards the bitterness than any other Alpine beer I've had. Still, this is quite extremely flavorful. Moderately resiny on the finish, this is yet another winner in the Alpine pantheon."
"One of the best IPAs I've ever had. The hops are aggressive, bold, and omnipresent, but polite in the sense that they never become harsh or biting. Simply fantastic."
"Overall this is a contender for best West Coast IPA out there. It's pretty much on par with Sculpin for me, though the flavor is more pine-like and less complex. There's a little bit of alcohol presence in the swallow but it's well incorporated. Great stuff."
"It's a good beer and I'd love to try it on tap from the source as I'm sure it's loads better. Definitely a solid IPA worth trying."
"Absolutely tremendous IPA. Full bitterness without the extreme hops and malt of a DIPA. Good amarillo orange flavours, and grapefruit. A bomber was a satisfying fill. Generous white head, above average mouthfeel. Good carbonation, balance.Thanks Augustgarage."
"Clear gold pour with a small, loose, white head. The aroma has a touch of honey sweetness upfront with pungent cattyness, bubblegum and tree fruit. The flavor is sweet with notes of bubblegum, grapefruit, cat pee, oily pine and a lasting bitterness on the sides of the tongue. Creamy, medium-full body with moderate carbonation and some astringency."
"Overall this very well may have been my favorite beer I had while visiting SD, a list that includes a lot of highly-regarded beers. A superb IPA and one that's well worth a shot."
"D: This beer is a pleasure to drink, constrained only by the fact that, after repeated tastes, it seems a bit one-note. Any comparison to Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is both appropriate and well-deserved."
"Great stuff. Was a little let down with the texture, but otherwise this is a quintessential West Coast-style IPA."
"Tasted from bomber bottle. Pours clear amber with a thick pearl white head that fades to lace. Nose is caramel malt with grapefruit, slightly dusty, hops bitterness. The palate is very similar. Caramel malt, grapefruit, some lemongrass, lemon pith bitterness comes through on back of palate. The carbonation is fairly light, and the body is medium, but I love the somewhat coating feeling that I am getting. The finish is long and bitter and slightly nutty. Overall, this is a great IPA, it is super balanced and easy to enjoy, and I am really enjoying it."
"Drinkability - an all-purpose IPA that delivers excellent flavor and sessionability. Thanks to a fine BA out west whose name escapes me until I find my trade list!"
"D: GREAT! refreshing with amazing hop balance"
"Pours a great golden orange, some pine and citrus on the nose. Taste is more of the same with a very good balance between the bitterness and the caramel malt flavors. Mouthfeel is just about perfect for the style, as it warms it has a bit more orange and lemon zest on the tongue. A very well balanced and flavorful IIPA."
"Cheers."
"Poured a golden amber with a 2-finger head with decent retention. Lacing was nice and present throughout. Nose grapefruit and pine with some sweet malts underneath. Taste was initially citrus (esp. grapefruit), then sweet caramel malts and a mildly bitter, peppery finish. Brew was medium bodied with a an oily mouthfeel. This is good! Again, as wiith other Alpine brews I've tried, the balance is right on. This has a little more going on than several, although I would still give Nelson the edge for my personal preference. Still, this is a great IPA and another reason maybe I am living in the wrong place."
"D: A very good IPA. Alpine sure can churn them out."
"Highly drinkable, flirts briefly with EIPA in some respects, then the grapefruit lurches it back. This grew on me as it warmed, would love to get this on cask or draft...."
"Great, easy drinking, full flavored beer...no more to say..."
"Drinkability is real nice too."
"D - Highly drinkable, could do this all day and enjoy it."
"Lighter body than I expected. Appropriately carbonated. Slick, oily texture. Very refreshing IPA. One of the best I've had. Good call, Mike."
"IT pours a deep copper, almost amber, slightly dark ,but nice clarity, beautiful 1 inch head that's dense and sticky. Moderate lacing, decent retention. The smell is grapefruit, pine, and mango upfront. I think the simcoes dominate the smell. Notes of floral resins, and grassy, piney hops are nice, and the juicy fruit comes through as well. Also, as it warms, a nice distinct, raw graininess comes up as well. The taste is interesting. It starts out bitter, then the pine and grass come in, with a nice sweet finish, with the melon and orange notes coming in. As it warms, I think the Amarillo start to dominate the taste - with heavy orange and grass notes - flavors that I think are very prominent in the Amarillo hops. You start to taste the alcohol too, but mostly it just lends a nice pleasant burn to the drink. The malts also start to peek their head out as it warms, and you end up with this very bready, sweet, bitter orange peel kind of taste for the last leg of the drink. A good tasting IPA. I think that the taste of the alcohol is all to prominent in this though - perhaps if it were subdued, this could go to the next level. The body is nice and medium, fairly full with malt, with a good sticky resinous feeling. The carbonation is mild, and lends a slight sting. I would say overall, at about 45-50F, this beer is absolutely amazing, as the grassiness starts to subside, the grain starts to come forward a bit, and the fruity hop flavor dominates. A very nice beer that I really enjoyed drinking."
"The beer is a clear bright golden glow with a thick slightly off white head supported by a steady stream of tiny bubbles of carbonation. Lots of thin streaks of lacing as well. The aroma is the highlight of this, exploding with sweet tropical and citrus fruits, particularly pineapple was my first thought. Flavor follows the nose with an initially sweet citric and tropic hop flavor but though out the body and into the finish the malt backbone and a slight graininess start to balance out the sweet. Mouthfeel is medium thick, with soft carbonation, resulting in a not particularly clean or crisp taste and finish. The finish almost tastes watery at times. Overall reminds me of Sculpin and has the aroma and flavor of an exceptional IPA, but the body leaves something to be desired for me."
"Amazing nose on this beer! Ripe tropical fruits with honey. Yum. Pours a honey golden to light amber, with generous white head. On the palate the hop focus is center stage, with no real need to mention malt presence. Nice piney and grapefruity hop flavors with a dry, chalky bitterness that goes nicely into the finish. Fine example of an IPA."
"D- I am debating cracking the Exponential Hopiness I have in the fridge. Good Stuff and I hope they make their way to Philly at some point."
"Overall an awesome beer that everyone should try. Trade for it if you have to."
"D - Man, Alpine sure hits the nail on the head with IPA... Pure Hoppiness, Exponential Hoppiness, Nelson... and now this. Duet is a tasty West Coast hop bomb that maintains a nice balance of aggressive citrusy hops and sweet malts."
"Flavor is full of citrus. There is tangerine and grapefruit. The hops are also floral. There is a light, bready sweetness hidden in the background. There is a nice bitterness here. This is a pretty light IPA in body but not flavor. Its incredibly easy drinking, especially at 7%, which is completely unnoticed."
"this is one of the best west coast IPA's i have had. nothing is overpowering, tons of complexity, but in such an easy way. alpine has always left me kind of, bleh, but this is just perfect,"
"D- The body is light and nearly quaffable without being thin, the smell is tremendous, and the taste is very good. My vote is that this is a very drinkable IPA. Its not a one-sided hoppy mess-but it showcases the hops very well with a minimal malt backbone. Not as aggressive as some other west coast IPAs I have had-but a very good IPA overall. Looking forward to trying other alpine brews."
"D- Bottom line, I need to get more of this. I could drink this everyday!"
"Excellent! If this one were readily available, I'd seek this out as a Furious alternative on days I wasn't feeling quite so aggressive. Lovely & a masterful creation. Great example of the style."
"Bottle, home. Holy crap, this is good. This beer pours a light golden amber with a nice white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma hit me the instant I uncapped the bottle. This is not a shy beer. It smells like a truckload of tangerine rinds and pine needles were mixed with fairy dust and dumped in a meadow of flowers. A big whiff of this beer is like aromatherapy for a hophead. As Ninkasi doubtlessly intended, this IPA is all about showcasing the hops. The flavor is light and dry with lots of hop bitterness, but there's just enough malt sweetness to keep it from paint thinner territory. The mouthfeel is oily with hop residue but just a bit thin. However, I think that I'm only noticing that because the hops are so big that my palate is assuming it's in DIPA territory. For a dry 7% abv beer, Alpine probably couldn't do any better in this regard. This is a phenomenal beer. I can't wait to try the rest of the Alpine bottles that I bought."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a SN tumbler. The Duet pours a bright golden orange color with a bubbly white head and lots of bubbles rising from the base of the glass. Very good clarity through the pour and solid lacing. Aromas are dominated with floral and hoppy scents. Also hints of grapefruit and pines. Quaff is fairly sweet with plenty of citrus fruits. A nice malty caramel taste comes forth with the warming of the brew. And of course, hops finish off the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is crisp and bitter with a full body. Drinkability is great. Another great example of west coast hops. Thanks again Jesse."
"Drinkability is superb, very drinkable IPA."
"on the visit to san diego, we drove out to alpine to sample the wares. except my partner in crime passed himself out in the back of the van. left alone to trudge on, i put forth my best effort. a light orangey hue, spewing forth grapefruit and mango goodness with a slight bit of malt. a nice bitter, touch of sweetness and plenty of citrus fruit. pretty tasty, nothing to go too wild over, but enjoyable nonetheless. perhaps the sours from earlier in the day were still vengeful, but i would think my excitement from the 45 minute drive would overcompensate for any of that. at any rate, i shall try a bottle in the future or perhaps find it at sd beer week if everything goes right."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with fast moving carbonation making this brew immensely drinkable. This is just a damn good IPA that I would be buying many bombers of if it was available locally. If you have access to this consider yourself lucky!"
"D: Smooth, yet chewy at the same time, This beer is a beast of it's own kind. I find it to be very balanced, big in flavor, yet at a point where it can be easily enjoyed in numbers. I have got to find more of this."
"Hint ..I would gladly drink this one again"
"Overall, ive become a huge fan of alpine, any time someone goes anywhere where they can grab some for my I toss them some money and say grab whatever they have."
"I recieved this beer as part of my Secret Santa haul and I am very happy to finally mark this Want off my list. Like I stated above this is a very good tasting beer and I would love having this again. Thanks Matt!"
"Very earthy up front with a lot of dry pine bitterness which lingers throughout into a very dry finish. The citrus character from the aroma is there but very less prominent than I expected or hoped for. Hints of lemon peel and grapefruit along with some pineapple notes. Subtle malt backbone with hints of graham cracker and biscuit. There's also some strong sweet alcohol evident mid palate and the high ABv is not very well masked. Overall this beer is a bit to dry and bitter for my liking with too strong of an alcohol presence and not enough balance. The balance that I speak of is not a lack of malt, just a lack of the flavors blending with each other. Not nearly enough citrus, sweet flavor for my taste. Decent but a bit overhyped."
"Alpine knows their hops, and they let this knowledge shine through - none of their IPAs are too bitter, they're more often dry than not, and they don't need to be too alcoholic to accomplish their goal. This is a sign of confidence, and that confidence is well earned."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable indeed--it's not as light as the nelson (which I just finished reviewing prior to this one) but it's wonderfully complex, which makes it a very interesting brew to drink. Combined with the wonderful mouthfeel, I find myself looking forward to each sip--though they are sips rather than gulps. Pairs quite nicely with some extra sharp cheddar."
"Drinkability - Extremely so. A very enjoyable beer that has utter amazing taste. Up until a month or two ago I had never had nor heard of Alpine. My local beer store recommended I get Pure Hoppiness and Nelson (I enjoyed Nelson over PH). Both beers were very good and I went back and picked up two more by them. Sadly they are out of Nelson or else I would have picked up another one. Overall, a very great beer."
"Another well done West Coast IPA here from Alpine, with a well balanced and powerful profile. My only gripe with this is the same that I had with Nelson in the bottle. Just a lack of presence in the taste that this had on draft and that same ""off"" feel. I'm wondering now if maybe their beers don't translate the best to bottles? Anyway, I wouldn't pass on a bottle, as this still a damn tasty brew."
"One of the best IPAs on the market. Really hope Alpine will expand their distribution to us folks up north. A must try if you like hops."
"As I said earlier both times I have had this I've been very impressed. Just so much juicy hop character. I'd be very glad to have this with regularity."
"D: Phenominal beer! The use of Simcoe and Amarillo hops in this beer really makes me not wait to brew my IPA with these two hop varieties. This is definitely a beer that I will seek out again, but thankfully, for now, I still have one more bomber left!"
"Every IPA I've tried from Alpine has been top shelf. The Amarillo and simcoe hops in Duet make it my favorite from the family."
"Alpine certainly has a knack for making impressive IPAs. They're at the forefront on the west coast. Actually, they're at the forefront...period. Duet really is a well-rounded IPA that delivers. It would benefit a little from a thicker body and a little less carbonation, but those are small gripes. Duet truly is excellent. Seek out a bottle. It's worth it."
"Chewy, full bodied and highly carbonated. In summary, an extremely enjoyable beer but the excessive carbonation makes the drinkability just shy of a 5."
"I find myself thanking the beer deities once again for the fact I have a regular Alpine hookup. Straightforward but far from one-note, highly recommended if you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation, some of it a bit stinging. Drinkability is high in terms of volume of beer simply due to the balance nature of the flavor profile, but since I am a one and done type drinker in this style I would probably reach for something else instead. Still, a very good beer that deserves props for being balanced."
"D: Good lord, Alpine makes some great IPAs."
"Alpine has really raised the bar with their IPAs - this is no exception."
"D: Another stunner from Alpine! Their IPA's are so friggin' good, we need more!"
"D: Very tasty and refreshing, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely one of the better IPA's that I've had and an excellent beer overall."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. solid malt and hop presence. i can't say i was blown away by it, but it's definitely good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, a little too high like the Nelson although not as much. A pretty damn solid IPA, no Pure Hoppiness for me but excellent stuff. Thanks Eric!"
"Notes: This is a really good IPA that drinks so easily I wish it were available in 6 pack form. Doesn't feature as much complexity in the citrus department as I usually look for in top-notch IPA's, as the bitter pine seems to take over on the back end. But all in all, this is another fine choice in the diverse selection of west-coast IPA's within easy disposal. Recommended"
"D: More, please. I love an IPA that kicks my tastebuds in the teeth. This one does it with panache. Now, who's gonna send me a bottle of Nelson?"
"D: Very enjoyable. Only wish that we could get this on the east coast."
"Overall, a pretty damn fine IPA, to me, much more superior than the Nelson."
"Slightly overcarbonated but not as much as it's Nelson brother - I'm sure some of this will get sorted out in the newer bottle releases. A fine, drinkable IPA, just not the best."
"D- It was a great beer to look at but the buttery notes ruined it. I'd be willing to rerate to see if it was a bad bottle."
"Pours light orange with a huge white head. Very carbonated from the looks of things. The main aroma is piney hops. The flavor has a good amount of bitterness and pine flavor, but that is quickly washed off the tongue by the high, prickly carbonation. The huge amount of carbonation makes the beer taste slightly watery and takes away from the overall experience. That is my only complaint about the beer. With lower carbonation, I think I would have enjoyed it as much as good as Nelson or Pure Hoppiness."
"Notes: After taking down 3 alpine brews in the past couple weeks I've found another reliable brewery to purchase from. Everything I've sampled has been at the very least solid and at the best stunning. Don't hesitate to purchase."
"EDIT- I have gotten a bunch of bottles of this since my first review. I am in love with this beer. One of the best from the West, no doubt about it."
"Not QUITE worthy of its top 100 status, IMO, but a very nice IPA nonetheless. If I loved Simcoe, this would be my jam."
"D: Fantastic IPA. Simcoe and Amarillo is just a classic American pairing and I never get tired of the two. ABV is reasonable and the brew doesn't want you to stop drinking it."
"Pours a medium gold color with a large creamy off-white head. Aroma is tropical fruit salad with pineapples, oranges, honeydew, and grapefruit. Almost perfumey with citrus oils. Flavor is light unobtrusive malt overlaid with citric hops. Nice solid bitterness on the back of the palate. Hoppy and drinkable, an always welcome combination."
"Overall this was an exceptional and quite unique American IPA that contains one of the most interesting and appetizing biscuity malt characters that i have tried. Thanks again Dan for supplying me with this. Recommended."
"Rustic bronze color with medium head. Pine cone, grass on top of floral, light citrus, with faint caramel sweetness peeking through. Creamy mouthfeel nicely balances the almost spicy hop bitterness. Pleasantly lingering bittersweet finish - not at all harsh."
"Another great IPA from Cali."
"...an hour later... not as bad as it was at first. I'm not sure if it's mellowing out or I'm just getting used to it. Unfortunately, it's probably a bad bottle. If I get the chance, I'd like to try it again."
"Drinkability: Quite the session IPA."
"Light carbonation, but as with all Alpine beers, it so drinkable that it should be a crime. Just a refreshing, hoppy delicacy I wish I had access to all year round."
"If you're a hophead like I am, this is the beer for you. Very West Coast in flavor and aroma and quite drinkable. Worth seeking out."
"I've been slowly adding more beer to the glass as the head disappears, its almost time to drink. Strong bitterness and a slight aftertaste of more pine based hop flavor. There is some funk in the midpalate of the beer so a slight deduction. Body of the beer is medium, its not as if you are chewing the hops down its less forced than that. Overall the drinkability is good and I think this is an excellent example of an American IPA."
"D - I'm only a few sips in and I wish I had a 2nd bomber to drink. This stuff is great."
"Definitely a notch below pure hoppiness in my humble opinion. Needs a ""bottled on"" date."
"Duet is liquid crack for hop heads. Packed with a menagerie of hop-derived flavors yet shockingly balanced, this beer is all too quaffable. Furthermore, the 7% ABV was remarkably well hidden. I can only imagine how good this must be on-tap."
"Drinkability- Brilliant. So light and easy drinking and everything an IPA should be. I wouldn't say it's the greatest beer I've ever had, but it's possibly the easiest drinking IPA I've ever had. Awesome brew, thanks Alex!"
"Not very carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel. This stuff, at 6.75%, is insanely drinkable."
"Overall this was an OK beer, not my top west coast IPA but good and different. I drank a High Tide Fresh hop IPA before this and that one was in my opinion much better and I would order that one again easily over this one. The hops in this one just didn't compare. Knowing South Bay didn't get these in too long ago I can't imagine it was an old bottle, but it almost tasted like it."
"Alpine Duet is pretty close to an ideal IPA from my perspective. It would most likely get there with 50% more pale malt, 25% more hops and a higher Simcoe to Amarillo ratio. Anyone who lives in ABC's distribution area is extremely fortunate. Two thumbs up."
"Thanks a million Clint!"
"The flavor is quite grassy, with a smooth pine flavor and some grapefruit for good measure. They balance out quite nicely, making for an intensely hopped flavor that avoids bitterness for huge levels of aroma. Quite well done. Medium thickness with a medium/high level of carbonation that is not yet prickly. Pretty much spot on feel. Highly drinkable. This brew has been available on tap before and it indeed lends itself perfectly to having a couple of pints."
"Rich flavor with sweet caramel, earthy Simcoe, vegetal hop bitterness, maybe a 7/10 on the bitterness scale. Plenty of citrus, bitter orange peel and grapefruit pith. Medium bodied, with a slightly viscous feel. One bomber is easy to finish. This is a solid example of a West Coast IPA..."
"Thanks to stawn for sending this my way. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my Imperial nonic pint glass. The ale appears a slightly hazed golden yellow color with a huge inch plus of fluffy sticky bone white foam. The head leaves quite a lace in its wake. A very nice looking pour, can't wait to dig in. The nose and flavors consist of caramel malt, tangerines, floral, orange, pine, white grapefruit, grass, spicy citrus mint, peach skin, ripe tropical fruits, toffee. Just about the right amount of bitterness with no alcohol heat to speak of. Adequately carbonated with a clean medium body. Simply delicious stuff and very fresh right now. By all means, get your hands on a few bombers if you can."
"This is a very good beer. It was almost great, but it finishes so dry that I'm having a little trouble with it."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick with a nice bite of carbonation."
"I got this gem in a trade with stawn. Thanks Chris! Poured a 22 oz bomber into a oversized Pinot wine glass. Pours a golden caramel with minimal lacing and a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates. I put my nose to this beer and this is exactly what I like about west coast ipa's rich citrus. This ipa uses a mixture of simcoe and amarillo hops, yummy. This baby tastes exactly how it smelss citrus pronounced with wonderfull grapefruit bitterness. This beer goes down very easily, too bad this is not readily available on the east coast."
"(Edit: Had on tap at Woodshop tasting, no soap taste but still not very impressive. Will raise scores a bit.)"
"What a great IPA, like California sunshine in a glass."
"Hazed pale copper. Dusty looking cap of ivory white foam. Lace is quite substantial and intricate. Aroma is tropical, grassy and resiny. Flavor is a lot of citrus. Tangerine, orange, grapefruit, nectarine. Good hop flavor. A little grassiness and some pine resin. Bitterness is very clean. Underneath all the hop character is a solid enough toffeeish malt base. Medium-full bodied and moderately carbonated. This is a flavorful, easy drinker. Great IPA overall."
"Overall, a great beer, but I will probably not be buying this one very often since Nelson is usually available now, and I think that Nelson has all of the good things that Duet has and more."
"This is an outstanding IPA. Although it's certainly worth the $6 price tag, I would buy much more if it was $4 a bottle."
"Seek this one out. If you love IPA's you won't be disappointed."
"D - A solid IPA if I've ever had one. Alpine is the ""hop master"" of the West Coast, in my opinion. When I went and visited the brewery, Pat was kind enough to take me on a full-blown tour of his place. All the beers I sampled were excellent, but Duet might be my favorite."
"Lots of piny, citrusy hop flavors in this one. Bitterness is slightly subdued, and the malty backbone adds sweetness, but not much flavor. Grass, grapefruit, and tangerine peel on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, with a watery consistency and low carbonation. Crisp, smooth finish with a lingering bitterness, but not much of a bite. Still, this is a very good IPA, but I expected a bit more after falling in love with Alpine's Nelson Rye IPA..."
"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 22oz. bottle served in my Allagash tulip. Poured a honey-gold with a dense, half-inch, bright white head. Excellent head retention with some spotty lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose was sweet grapefruit all the way. Taste consistent with nose - sweet to start, some bitterness in the mix, but incredibly balanced. Mouthfeel was light-medium and very lively. An exceptional IPA that approaches a DIPA in flavor profile without the big abv. Another top notch IPA from Alpine."
"I agree with a previous reviewer who said this tasted like honey and nectar. I believe that is what a little age has done to transform this. I can't really remember the exact differences with this compared to the fresher version, but the former had more citrus and less bitterness. Still enjoyable, just make sure yours is fresh."
"D-I was expecting a lot and got a lot...top quality IPA..perhaps the only knock would be the less than sturdy body which does feel a little watered down at times as I drink more and more of this. really takes on more of a pale ale persona....None the less I love this beer and would like to have many more."
"D - Not bad. A good quaff, definitely not top 100. The tannic flavor killed the citrusy hops."
"Overall, an excellent AIPA that I most highly recommend. Worthy of the hype and praise. During my trip, I got to try a sample on tap at the brewery and then several more pints on-tap at the bars. On-tap is slightly better but the bottle is still excellent. They are an amazing brewery and can't wait to try the rest I brought home. Rotation: not avail here but I have a source who lives in SD so this will become a regular shipment. At about $4 for 22oz's you can't beat the enjoyment to price ratio."
"D: This is nearly the perfect session beer. I feel like I could drink this one through the day no problem and definitely the best alpine beer I have tried."
"HV"
"Pours an ultra pale golden color that first appears effervescent but is actually laced with suspended micro-particulate. The collar is better that a full finger deep loose foamy and off white and in nature. A nice amount of Belgian lacing left behind each mouthful. The smell has a really nice balance of floral citrus-pine perfume and sweet maltiness. The flavor presence wanders around some and in the end is suggestive of that same piny element. I am really enjoying this beer. However, the body abandons the experience IMO. It's as if the bottom drops out. I'm half way through the glass and now notice that those unique little floaters have settled to the bottom and don't quite cover the half dollar bottom of this most recent shapely Ithaca receptacle. Very drinkable; it feels so light that it surprises me to find that there is 6.7% ABV. This one has a whole lot to consider. Many thanks going out to radshoesbro for this opportunity!!!"
"Yet another great IPA out of the San Diego area. I'm curious to see how this compares side-by-side with Sculpin."
"M/D - A touch on the light side and little too much carbonation. Overall a very easy drinking a good IPA but just a touch off the mark from great."
"D - Extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability? It's entered as 6.75%abv, my bottle says 7.0%abv but whichever it is, and I'm leaning towards the 7(because my bottle says so...maybe a change from version tap vs version bottle?), this is highly drinkable! Alpine brewing did a great job here and Mauerhan did a great job sending this one my way. More BAs need to try this!"
"Upper light bodied with a dry and sticky mouthfeel. As I noted with the bottle of Nelson that I tried earlier tonight, carbonation could be kicked up a notch. It's at a pretty low level for an IPA and not as carbonated as the draft incarnation. Great stuff. A light and flavorful IPA, though I definitely prefer the draft version to this bottled batch."
"D - Very high. Overall this is another awesome IPA from Alpine."
"D: Superb. I absolutely loved this one. Had at the same time as Nelson Rye and this one was definitely better. (Also had Exponential Hoppiness at O'Brien's that evening, and this one was definitely better in my book.)"
"This was poured from a growler purchased at Alpine and I also had a glass on tap at O'Brien's the day before. Bright orange color with a white head that really laced the glass. The smell was a little pine but mostly bright fresh citrus fruit, excellent. The flavor was like nectarines and oranges, so juicy and hoppy, fantastic. This beer really impressed the hell out of me and I hope I can get my hands on a couple bottles if they release them."
"with a faint hop cry"
"D: An exceptional IPA right up there with Sculpin, Blind Pig, AleSmith IPA, Masala Mama and Furious as the tops in the category. This is an easy drinking brew that does not skimp on flavor and aroma."
"Drinkability: Delicious. I will be back. And soon. I wish this was more widely available, but I will be having it again soon. Watch it rise up the board, it deserves it."
"Overall: Saw this on tap at Toronado SD last night and found myself ordering this over Pliny the Elder, Expo Hoppiness, Blind Pig and so on. Hope that explains how I feel about this beer. A must try. Cheers!"
"D: Great balance of flavors and aromas. I would drink this one again if I got the chance."
"D - Smooth, flavorful and quite memorable. This is an outstanding CA style IPA."
"Growler from the brewery on release day, consumed the next day. Hazy gold-light orange with a sticky white head. Ripe apricot, sweet grapefruit and lots of tangy nectarine in the aroma. Like a tangy hop-fruit salad. Almost no malt in the flavor, just pure fruity and spicy hop flavor. More bitterness in the finish than Nelson, though still not strongly bitter. Medium-light body with a dry finish. More of a classic fruit hop profile than the grapey nelson, but very tasty. One of the most drinkable IPAs that I've ever had. Alpine is owning the IPA segment right now with a handful of amazing examples that all have their own flare."
"D: One of the best IPAs I've ever had, a must try again if I ever see it on tap. This beer is beautiful, my new favourite IPA I think, just wish it was more available."
"I really liked this beer as it has tons of hops and plenty of bitterness but remains extraordinarily drinkable...like, ""I could drink the whole growler"" drinkable. A great beer."
"D - My criticisms of the mouthfeel actually contribute to the incredible drinkability of this brew. It's like chugging hop-flavored water. Absolutely the quickest drinking single IPA I've ever tasted - dangerous stuff."
"Solid beer. Nice the Alc is ""only"" 6.75%. Not as aromatic as I thought it might be. A bit more IIPA feel, big rich body. Pine hops, nice drinkability. Has more weight to it than other IPA's. Richness and a nice finish. Though the richness adds to heavyness which 1 pint of this was plenty. Nice and fresh at Toro SD today."
"Overall this was easily one of the most sessionable IPAs I have ever run across and really one of the best tasting. I am glad I got this and it was worth the wait."
"Drinkability is off the chats. What a great IPA, lots of great flavors, but not too heavy at all. I could knock down quite a few of these in one sitting..."
"I will miss Downtown Johnny Browns. What a place to drink."
"Could drink this all day. Nice to see some SoCal breweries still carbonate their beers."
"Notes: I shared this with a friend and he commented that it had an English ale character to it, only with massive American hops. That's a good way to describe it; it's distinctly different than the Blind Pig we followed it up with. Softer, lighter, perhaps not as crisp and crackery as most West Coast IPAs, strangely cask-like. Wonderful stuff in any case, nearly perfect for the style."
"More hops on the taste buds initially with some moderate malts participating. Finish is lingering and brings back hints of orange peel. Offers a nice medium body and a well balanced carbonation, which remains quite constant through the finish. Very drinkable for an IPA; ABV is kept in check as are malts, present and accounted for but not rich and cloying. Hop bitterness remains low as well. Nice balance, nice beer."
"Tap at Pizza Port, Carlsbad. Clear yellow pour with a average-sized white head. Perfumy hops with grass and pine. Smooth hop-and-malt balance that takes nothing away from the bite. More resin than grapefruit, but the citrus is definietly noticeable. Thick, but not as syrupy as other borderline IIPA/IPA's. Very good."
"D: Duet is an amazing west coast IPA. I'm happy to have access to it when it is brewed. A testament to its drinkability is how I am sitting here finishing the whole growler without hesitation."
"Notes from 9/27/08"
"Brewandbbq hooks it up again on this one. Big pile o' thanks man."
"D-A hop head I am and this is a hop heads brew. Simcoe and Amarillo...how can you go wrong? Alpine didn't with this one that's for sure!"
"Very good IPA that is more 1 dimensional on the hops"
"D- amazing IPA (one of my favorites), damn enjoyable an drinkable, highly recommended"
"D- Super piney IPA, hops overwhelm the malts-in-hiding but the balance is there, can sense the underlying alcohol presence but its not overwhelming, unique and complex IPA definitely worth checking out (if you can find it)"
"Highly recommended. This was a standout for me at the fair. Wouldn't have minded having a full pint of this one. Hope to see it at one of the SD bars in the near future."
"I love some of Alpine's ales more than life itself, but I was disappointed in this one. It has a nice floral bouquet, but it lacked body and sufficient flavor to really wow me. Very little complexity. Maybe I was hoping for too much since the pub I was in had just run out of pure hoppiness and the barmaid said this would be a reasonable substitute. There really are very few substitutes for pure hoppiness."
"D: Seriously quaffable and easy to drink. The growler really didnt stand a chance. It wasnt the most complex beer but it has a really nice flavor with long lingering flavor."
"This is a excellent IPA."
"If you are in the area, be sure to stop by the brewery and pick up a growler or three."
"This is an outstanding IPA, of the hundreds that I've tried - this is right near the top."
"This beer would probably make a good session beer. It tastes great. I doubt I would ever get tired of it."
"Light white cakey foam head. Strong scent of grapefruit rind and something not quite piney but very hoppy. I'm being greedy when I say I wish there were an even bigger aroma. Flavor is just like it smells. Medium strong hop bite plants this firmly in the IPA range. I tried sniffing for orange but didn't get it. Malt kicks in about 5 seconds later. Clean, hoppy, malty, tons of flavor. Virtually perfect. This is what I strive for in my homebrew!"
"West Coast style IPA made with Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Sampled this one at the brewery, then on tap at O'Brien's and again at the Liar's Club. Could not get enough of it. Light bronze, big sticky foam head. Huge, unique hop explosion of an aroma. Reminded me of sticking my head into a big bag of leaf hops before tossing them in the boil. Flavor follows suit, grapefruity citrus blended with dirty spiced pine. An astounding blend of hop flavor. Hints of mandarin orange & fresh cut grass. Not a harshly bitter beer, but it certainly lingers on the tongue. Medium bodied. Biscuit and light caramel round this out beautifully. Delightful medley of flavors showcasing the hops uniquely. Best IPA I've had to date."
"Cheers!"
