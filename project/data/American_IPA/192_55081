3.51,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"1 pint 6 fl oz (650ml) bottle. It sat on the counter for a while before I opened it so I would guess it was probably 45-47 degrees, poured into a room temperature 20oz fluted beer glass. Appearance was amazing. A little more carbonation than I expected, 2 finger white head, good retention and nice lacing. Surprisingly clear dark amber color. Smell was what I would characterize as typical IPA. Nothing outstanding or remarkable. Citrusy/piney/floural... IPA. Taste was an immediate hop forward bomb on the front of the tongue with a dry finish. Again, my reaction was that it was a good IPA, but nothing really extraordinary to separate it from the other 2 kerzillion IPA's dominating the shelf space across America. The feel was probably a bit drier than most IPA's. Overall not a bad beer at all. "Refreshing" would be a good one word description. I'm not sure I would run right out and buy more, but that's probably more because I'm growing extremely tired of the IPA fad.","sremed60","Mar 30, 2015"

Lots of carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Floral aroma, also noted hints of spice, citrus, orange, grapefruit, and ginger. Light weight to the mouthfeel. Quite bitter, with a prominent hop taste. Grapefruit and citrus are also present. A bit boozy for 6.5%, but drinkable. Tasted a bit thin, in terms of actual flavor.

The flavor is crisp, very sweet, floral orange grapefruit combo that has ok bitterness. Its biggest strength is its consistancy. I can't remember a time when it didn't taste like itself on tap or in bottle (unlike Averys sadly). Its biggest weakness is in the mouthfeel I think. It just feels thin too often but thats not to say thats a terrible thing, but the flavor ends up feeling a bit generic  or mass produced at times because of it and its really better than that. Its usually priced VERY well too so that is a bonus.","Jrhockney","Feb 23, 2015"

I have a hard time rating this because it's just so different from other beers I've had that it's hard to make a comparison, but it's been a pretty enjoyable experience both times I've had it and works pretty well with food. This beer has taught me that IPAs aren't something to fear, even as a fairly new beer drinker who'd never had anything with more than 23 IBUs previously. (though trying one or two bottles/glasses first rather than going for a full six-pack would probably be wise if ypu've never had an IPA before.) I do think I'll probably make my next "hoppy" beer something a bit milder like a pale ale or a pilsner rather than another IPA, though--I'm just not quite used to such strong hop flavors and bitterness yet.","Pantalones","Dec 19, 2014"

It had good lacing, a great dark golden color, and a rich citrusy smell, but outside of that, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  There was plenty of after-taste for a normal IPA beer.  Again, it was better than average, for me, but nothing I would go out of my way to partake of.","jjamadorphd","Dec 07, 2014"

The taste is mouthwatering; loads of pine, citrus, grass, and some juicy fruits coat the tounge. It ends with just the right amount of bitterness. I really like the feel of this beer. It starts off with an in the face hop bomb but the malt balances it out just enough to leave the mouth watering and wanting more. Great IPA","Cory_Brown","Nov 27, 2014"

4,6.1,,,,,,"This is my go-to IPA. The price is quite reasonable, and being sold in 12-packs of 12 oz. cans is the best format around for beer. At 6.5% you get a ton a flavor without too much alcohol although after a few you will definitely be buzzed. Price is right, very good (actually somewhat underrated), very easy to get, and great for when your hosting a party or guests are coming over.","TCJ0100","Oct 17, 2014"

Still,  I'd come back to this, I always do.","SitkaSteve","Sep 29, 2014"
4,6.1,,,,,,"Smells alive and I like that. Clarity is good. Carbonation portrays small bubbles continually floating to the top. Small layer of foam on head after gentle pour. Several IPAs and DIPAs have a processed pellet hop flavor. This one is different - refreshing, alive, and a good bite. Tastes like I put a fresh hop flower in my mouth. I like the low alcohol (6.5% ABV). Hops need to overpower alcohol with IPAs and DIPAs and this one does. Easy to drink. The bitterness slows me down in a good way. Real decent IPA, and it's a pretty mainstream brewery.","Smitt","Sep 28, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 12, 2014"

The answer would be New Belgium's Ranger. It is by a long way NOT the best IPA nor is it characterized by uniqueness and distinctive flavors, but it is certainly one of the most standard and balanced beers of its type. A wonderful hop balance, nice body and crisp citrus (grapefruit) notes. A solid A-.","jsausley","Aug 07, 2014"

It is quite possibly one of my gateway IPA's, I was beginning to enjoy the style around the time I tried this one, but it was one of the first that really did it for me. Its piney, resinous, but now looking back it is not all that potent compared to some of the other IPA's I have consumed over the years. Its a very well balanced beer and one that someone should try if they are looking to try an introductory IPA. It definitely has that signature Colorado style and New Belgian yeast strain going on. Its a bit biscuity but hoppy enough to make a novice to IPA's enjoy this particular style. Then again it may come across as a bruiser, but if you find your self getting into IPA's or Pale Ales, you should try this one out. Its easy to find and relatively inexpensive for what you get.","humuloner22","Jul 29, 2014"

3.83,1.6,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Welcome to Alberta, New Belgium. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance at long last. Of course one of the new arrivals is going to be an IPA. Ranger is a dark gold, perhaps just shy of light bronze ale with a decent amount of light beige head. Looks quite fizzy and light-bodied. Aroma is pleasantly herbal, fruity, and tangy, featuring a bouquet of grapefruit and orange, lychee, gooseberry, canned peaches, a hint of pineapple ... Nice fruity hop notes with a gentle caramel malt background. This IPA is rather refined, bold of flavor but not coarsely bitter, rather smooth, moderately medicinal, and notably fruity. Has one of the more pleasing gooseberry or currant flavors I've encountered in such a beer, rich and assertive, musty and spicy but not pungently catty. Also features faintly toasty malts, more peach and lychee fruit, melon, medicinal orange, and some pot resin that shows up late in the show. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost veering into creamy territory, a little soapy, on the lighter side for an IPA body-wise but this allows the hop flavors to shine through nicely. Not an obviously West Coast pine bomb and that's OK by me. Workmanlike but not devoid of some artistic flourishes. Recommended for the IPA lover and relative newcomer alike.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 25, 2014"

Taste was not what I expected, there is just something "off" about it, but the hops really shine and I cant quite put my finger on it, but its just a touch too sweet or something.

The forest ranger hat full of hops had me at hello. Beer pours a brilliant copper body with slightly off white head forming thick and rising well above the rim of my pint glass. Aroma earthy, pine, citric qualities...hey gang the hops are all here. Perfect drinkability, clean bitter hops but finishes clean and bready. The type of sessionable hops I could consume in number, albeit the ABV at 6.5% my stand in my way, clean cereal biscuit notes bring out a bread like character, that meshes well with the hops. Let me talk about the hops since it's an IPA and all...great hop flavor, grapefruit peel, pines, earthiness a bit of dirt kicked up on the palate. The label mentions Simcoe, Cascade, and Chinook relatively clean sharp bitter finish that's well balanced and doesn't really kill you with the hops, again the balance and drinkability with hop flavor think of drinking a bomber of something really mass produced with actual malt flavor and hop bitterness married in perfect balance. Overall I can't stop buying this after two bottles, I will drink the rest of the local stock available to me.","WVbeergeek","Dec 17, 2013"

Clean, clear and well-balanced, it is -nonetheless-- a bit too dry for my tastes as far as a session beer goes. However, as a one-off or a beer while out at a restaurant, it is great. I would really like to try this beer on tap somewhere. Its grapefruit characteristics remind me of Lord Chesterfield, a beer I can no longer find in Georgia. Frowny face emoticon for that sad fact of beeranity.","BeerDocT","Dec 10, 2013"

The smell is definitely of fruity hops. I get mostly a of oranges or maybe tangerines with a slight hint of bitterness. Taste is pretty well balanced with a decent malt bill that definitely keeps up with the bitterness in the nose. I didn't notice any malt in the nose but definitely present in the taste. Not sure what the hop bill is here but it really is hard for me to describe. Seems to loose the fruit that I found in the nose as the hops really escape anything I can think of to describe. They really just seem to add bitterness without a tangible taste. The taste is quite balanced. Mouthfeel is thin as one would expect. Overall I really liked the beer more than the last time I had it years ago.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 06, 2013"

Coming from New Belgium, its a mature concoction to be sure. If you dont like all the hops in your face taste that is typical of an AIPA, you should try this beer.","Hops4Pops","Nov 20, 2013"

The smell is quite pleasant but not profound. You get some hops and citrus just what you'd expect, I did not get any pine but apparently may others have. The taste is wonderful with a barrage of hops but none of them overpowering or overly hoppy. In the end you don't get much hoppiness but plenty of subtle citrus. The mouth-feel is phenomenal, not too carbonated and all very subtle and smooth. I often talk about balance and that's exactly what this beer has. Wonderful hops but not overbearing and a great intro style for the newcomers. Highly recommended to anyone!","Khad","Nov 15, 2013"

I prefer either a leaner, dryer IPA, or one that is sweeter and thinner with more of a honeyed note to the malt. When I get a grainier, thicker one like this, I can't help but think of a mash that has been inefficiently sparged. I'm not saying that's the case here, just what it puts me in mind of. The hops are fine, if a little tame. I'd like either to see some more citrus tang or more of a piney blast- particularly to cut through the graininess. What you get instead is a respectable but slightly boring blend of the two with any earthy note underpinning it all. For me, this is the kind of beer I drink when I'm eating at someplace that doesn't really have a real beer list, but they've got this. In other words, it'll do in a pinch.","Georgiabeer","Sep 17, 2013"

It has a nice rich color of copper. Very little head. The aroma is excellent. The first taste is also very good. But that is where it stops. For an advertised 70 IBU there is no bite from the hops. You still get that pine, citrus feel in your mouth, but only when you drink. It has no staying power. The sweetness of the hops are non existent. It is smooth and well balanced. I would say it could be an IPL also. It's a decent session beer if only the ABV were a bit lower, the 6.5 does nothing to help. Worth a try, you will definitely love the way your belches taste.","mreatsum","Sep 06, 2013"

The taste was not like it smelled. It tasted like grass brewed in hairspray. I was very disappointed. This was my first IPA and I will have to say it will take a lot of courage to try another. Maybe I will have to grow my pallet for this style of beer. I will try some more and if my taste for IPA changes, I may revise this review.

However, I am giving it a second try and must say for a single IPA this is a good IPA, not great mind you but a butt ton better than the last two IPAs I have had to date. The color is what I expect a light honey and a pout that creates a nice head and dissipates evenly across the top of the beer. My first smell off the top surprised right away I detected that nice grapefruit smell. The first taste went in quite well as the beer sat on my tongue the bitterness spread evenly across my palate and then cleared out right after I swallowed the beer down. The residual beer taste in my mouth was pleasant enough to warrant a second taste just to make sure I wasn't deceiving myself, and then of course a third and fourth and so on and so forth.

3.95,4.8,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Ranger is a pretty simple, tasty IPA. It's refreshing and extremely drinkable, with it's most remarkable aspect being its clean malt base. The malts are just so perfectly clean and crisp, they allow the more delicate citrus flavors of the not excessively bitter hops to shine. Like the other New Belgium main-line beers I've had so far, it's not a jaw-dropper, but instead an extremely tasty and very drinkable beer.","shand","Aug 01, 2013"

Aroma is big pine hops, sweet, and more pine. Beautiful. Flavor is pine bitter up front, fading into light floral citrus, then lots of grass, and finishing with a lingering grapefruit. Light bodied and yet slick. Medium high carbonation. This is very nicely done! I could drink this all day.","BMMillsy","Jul 29, 2013"

It is a great value as well and outperforms more expensive ales in terms of flavor, mouth feel, nose and delecability. I have tried hundreds of ales and this one has just the right balance of flavors for me. The fact that they use three of my very favorite hop varieties (chinook, simcoe and cascade) yields a wonderfully citrusy finish that is intense without overpowering the malty deliciousity ;) If you haven"t tried it and you can get it, get it and try it if you like IPA's at all...Enjoy!","hopdaddy49","Jul 14, 2013"

I prefer it over many IPA's and PA's out there. I am amazed at how bitter this simple IPA can come across on some days, and on other days taste much sweeter. Obviously, my palate is the variable, but it is impressive to me, none-the-less. A solid, relatively-unique look at an IPA.","jamespub","Jul 10, 2013"

I guess of you have already tried a lot of beers and know you like pine flavors, this would be awesome, but I am still trying to figure out my palate and this was not appealing to it. I will read more about IPAs in general to find out if this is typical of the style before purchasing another. It was nice to have a beer with flavor. The strong taste would have been awesome had the overwhelming flavor not been a pine cone and grass.","Bill_Murray","Jul 05, 2013"

Smell is piney with some fruit and a little honey malt. Nice hoppy taste that leaves a little bitterness on the tounge. Taste a small honey malt but mostly pine grapefruit hops. Feels medium mouthfeel very smooth. Pretty much the same as most ipa but just super soild and just great when looking for a more simple flavorful ipa.","DrewsBrews450","May 18, 2013"

But the taste and body are what you would expect of a solid IPA. This is a great value brew for when you need to pick up a 12 pack for the weekend and an IPA is the only thing that will hit the spot.

The head retreats slowly as it should for an IPA, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. The aroma is of clean grapefruit with some pine. I get some caramel in the nose as well. The flavor follows the smell pretty well. There's some nice bright grapefruit and bitter piney hops in the back. There's also some caramel sweetness from the malt as well as some breadiness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is sticky and the hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. This beer is pleasantly drinkable.

This was floral enough not to be bold and balanced enough to feel more like a Pale Ale, but the slight buzz that I felt at the end reminded me that this was indeed an IPA. While not the best of its kind that I had, this would be perfect in the Summer when something just a bit stronger than a "lawnmower beer" would be called for. Certainly, this would be a great introduction to the style for a neophyte.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 17, 2013"

I feel like there was not a lot of experimentation going on in this beer, which is a good thing in the case of Ranger. It also has a very crisp quality to it which makes it an awesome beer on a hot day, and I find it slightly more drinkable than many IPA beers.","orcsinspace","Mar 11, 2013"

Hop-forward aroma of resiny "c hops" has hints of tropical fruit with a respectable grain base. The flavour is by no means well-balanced, but it is bitter focused and hop-forward in a manner that I fully support. An initial bready sweetness with mango and pineapple elements transitions rapidly to an abject bitter resin, with some grapefruit tones left within a delightfully lingering finish.","hopsolutely","Dec 04, 2012"

Plenty of wonderful grapefruit hops in the nose with a bit of earthiness and pine in the background, well balanced. Taste is more of the same. Grapefruit hops coat the mouth, and there is a nice malt backbone that supports the hops. Pleasantly surprised by this one. An excellent widely available IPA.","spark3148857","Nov 28, 2012"

4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall this ale has what this reviewer has come to love about the west coast version of the ipa style. Colorado may not be on the coast, but the general western usa idea of streamlined and less filling while still utterly delicious is evident here. Spending years chewing down the midwest's drinks, while fabulous to be certain, has made me grow fond of this lighter type of beer and hence I may feel more satisfied than others to whom this brew has been commonplace. New Belgium is new to our market here in Michigan and I am glad that I decided to snag this out of the gas station today as the overrated status of Fat Tire nearly deterred me from finding out what a great little brew this Ranger India Pale Ale is. I will be looking to this in the future!","SupaCelt","Sep 24, 2012"

The taste followed right along, with a bitter start, a fruity middle, and a piney finish. Mouthfeel was creamy and on the lighter side of medium. Not much of an aftertaste, and not any stickiness either. This beer was firmly in the West Coast school of clean and dry IPA's, and was quite quenching as a result. I usually prefer a bit more malt character in my IPAs, but this was clearly a quality product.","rajendra82","Sep 15, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability, it went down smooth, was a little refreshing, and the flavors did an ok job at holding my attention, one bomber is enough for me, but if I was really in the mood for an American IPA, I could see drinking two of them. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both really good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was how the taste just couldn't live up to the aroma, the taste wasn't bad by any means, but the hops didn't show up as much as I would have liked. I would buy this beer again when looking for a decent and cheap IPA, but I don't think I will buy it often, I recommend giving this a try to any IPA fan. All in all this beer was nice, it didn't wow me, but I was impressed with some aspects of it and I would call this a pretty solid American IPA, nice work New Belgium a solid beer from a solid Brewery.","StoutHunter","Sep 10, 2012"

Anyway, nose is fresh pine and some fruit and sweetness. Smells balanced. Taste confirms the balance, a hoppy and distinctive citrus rind, and fruit, and balsam, supported by a nice, but not overdone malt presence. I really like the taste. Bitter notes persist, inviting another drink. Mouth-feel is terrific, carbonation moderate. Great for the price and newly stocked nearby, I'm sure to have another soon.","Bitter_Echo","Sep 09, 2012"

3.94,4.5,5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a mostly-transparent yellow-orange color, with a thick, fluffy head. The aroma features a prototypical Cascade hop profile, with a fragrant combination of pine and some light citrus, which is balanced by a reasonably substantial malty sweetness. The flavor similarly showcases a juicy combination of grapefruit and pine, with only enough underlying sweetness to keep the assertively bitter hop flavors from overwhelming. The texture is pleasantly light yet resinous, which helps this beer go down relatively smoothly, but it is really the bold, varied hop character that makes this beer what it is.","devilben02","Sep 04, 2012"

Well bitter as I would expect, with more pine than I noticed in the nose. Floral and citrus and herbal as well. Would like a little more maltiness.

I don't think she has explored the Ranger yet, but I'm fairly confident she'd really dig this well-balanced yet hop-forward delight because it showcases the hops' citrus and earthy characteristics without bashing you over the head with them.

As it slowly fell, as foam is wont to do, I was left with some generous lacing in its wake. Color was an orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity and I just remembered that I wanted to ask for a Lovibond scale at SAVOR, dang it! Nose was redolent with pine hops and I was happy that it was hoppy. More truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and perhaps I have become jaded in my hophead ways, but this did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary. It was plenty hoppy with a caramel malt backbone evident on the tongue, but I was not aroused as I was with the earlier Shift. It could also be that I had it as a Want for so long that it took on mythic proportions ... I dunno. Finish was super dry and as I think about it, this was a pretty darn good IPA, and in a CAN no less. I'd best take my own advice and kwicherbichen.","woodychandler","Jun 19, 2012"

It's a burnished brass color with excellent light penetration and great clarity. Pillowed with lots of pure white head and sticky lacing all over the glass. It's an overall very fine looking beer. The nose is a bouquet of hops, full of pine and citrus oil that's a good smell for a good IPA. Malt is very subdued overall. The taste is very indicative of the nose as well. It has strong bittering without being overly harsh, very much like orange rind and smacking with some citrus fruit juice as well. Bittering is well done and finishes strong. Full mouthfeel with good carbonation overall. I think this beer is a very quality representation of a good IPA. It's a good standard of the style and does well what it sets out to do.","estlinska","May 23, 2012"

Flavors reiterate the tropical fruits in the nose spitting forth waves of pineapple, passion fruit, unripe mango, maybe some guava. Overall its on the dry side of sweet..does that make sense? Who cares. Lots of fruity notes, as I’ve said..with dry yet soft bitterness over a nuetral foundation of sweetness. In any event, its clean and fruit, and accents the fruity hop notes, backs them with adequate sweetness, tingles the senses with a burst of dry bitterness...and ends soft and gentle, yet evident..","SallyBirkhart","Apr 02, 2012"

Flavor has a very strong hoppy bitter leaf bite up front that fades to a mild orange, strong pine and mild caramel malt middle finishing with a pronounced doughy/biscuit ending.

Nose is nicely hopped, some orange and grapefruit, with a bit of dankness and grass. A light spicy hop note as well, accenting a lightly sweet malt character. Taste has more of the same idea, quite bitter with grassy and herbal notes, a hint of the spicy hop note and more orange and citrus. Very light malt character again, some light grain and cracker in that respect. Long bitter finish, a bit of a palate zapper. Medium carbonation, fairly light medium body. A good hop assault.","liamt07","Jan 03, 2012"

It's definitely good for a hop fix, but it becomes difficult to even drink without the malts to back it up.

The flavor follows. A really good mellow citrus flavor, not dull by any means, but well put together. Sugary grapefruit juice, without the bite or strength of fresh grapefruit leads the hop profile. Lemon juice flavor follows. A solid caramel malt is next before a more bitter, pine finish. Nicely done, not huge flavor, but tasty... very drinkable IPA.","uustal","Nov 15, 2011"

It was an ok brew. I think they may have been shooting for drinkability just like the Fat Tire and Hoptober. Probably won’t seek this out again, but it was enjoyable.","CraftBeerTastic","Nov 13, 2011"
4.05,7.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The palate opens with a moderate grapefruit pith bitterness, and a mild pine-like bitterness, as well. There's plenty of flavor too, including some citrus and some tropical fruit. There isn't much malt presence here, with a touch of toast. The freshness keeps the hops bright and vibrant. There's a mild resin character as well. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer is fairly light in body and is moderately carbonated. The mid-palate is just a touch watery, though. All told, this is a surprisingly good IPA, and this fresh, it's awfully enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Nov 12, 2011"

Amazing hop aroma. Intense, pungent grapefruit and herbal hop aroma with a solid sweet maltiness beneath. Smooth oily feel. Carbonation is a bit understated. Tart grapefruit flavor is prominent with herbal hop flavors and a sweet malty backbone. Finishes semi-dry with pungent, spicy herbal aftertaste.

3.98,5.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Out of a bomber this beer was a golden amber color with lots of rising carbonation and one finger of yellowish head. The retention was impressive and the lacing in thick bands. The aroma was a pleasant blend of citrusy hops, resin, sweet malt and hints of tropical fruit. The flavors were more bitter than the aroma suggested but this is not a bad thing in an IPA. I tasted grapefruit, pine, caramel malt, orange peel and a hint of earthiness from the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation light.","thekevlarkid","Nov 03, 2011"
4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall- This is by all accounts, a well balanced IPA that lets the floral and herbal notes really ride the wave, while providing a citrus and biscuit malt background.

4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Medium body easy to drink American IPA! The New Belgium Brewery makes an IPA that I can find in most supermarkets. Something I can count on. The price is not bad compared to most craft brews; $8.99 for a six pack is good these days.","Luigi","Oct 22, 2011"
3.62,-4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"not your stereotypical ipa. this one has more of that belgian vibe to it, not as sturdy as some of the american versions. its delicacy lends itself nicely to the hops here, allowing them to be tasted in their entirety without a lot of interference from other elements. not as yeast driven as their belgo, this one doesnt satisfy all of the conditions of an ipa for me, but under any other name it is an excellent beer. the 6.5 percent can catch you unaware as well!","StonedTrippin","Oct 22, 2011"

I really felt that while the hop profile of this beer was impressive, the malt side of it could have been upped to bring an overall better balance, although I'm not sure if that would cross too far the boundaries of what the style embodies (if so, my apologies).

3.65,-3.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours clear "Kool-Aid" orange. With a thick off white head that clung very well. Smells of pine and lemon peel. Smell is fresh even though its 21 days past expiration. Taste is semi dry with a nice bitter linger that lasts enough but not as much as some of the Pacific North West versions. Hardly any malt in keeping with the style. Solid, but I would put it right the middle (I've had better, I've had worse). I will say I'd like to try a super fresh batch for comparison. I wouldn't turn one down... but if I'm buying and one of my favorites is available I might pass it by. Worth trying.","Justin23060","Sep 11, 2011"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a huge head w/ sticky lace patches on a clear, reddish/orangey body. Very earthy, citric hop aroma and hints of caramel and breadiness there as well. While hoppy, really hoppy for just a "single" IPA, the hops are citrusy and earthy but not overpowering as this beer goes down smooth. Nice balance as well b/c I also pick up some caramel sweetness as well as touches of grape/tropical fruit. Finishing w/ a slightly dry edge, I find this beer to be a quality sipper and one that a hop lover and just a beer lover would enjoy.","clayrock81","Sep 09, 2011"
4.17,10.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Big thanks to my boss for saving me a bottle of this and giving me one to try. This poured out as a light colored orangy yellow, the head was white and had a decent retention. The lacing wasn't too sticky though. The smell of the beer packs a nice little punch for just being a regular IPA. Plenty of citrusy pine aromas pouring out of this one. The taste is really nice on this brew, lots of really piney notes on the tongue, very flavorful IPA. The mouthfeel of the beer is slightly creamy but still quite prickly feeling from the hops and carbonation. Overall this is a highly enjoyable IPA, would be able to drink this one over and over.","Knapp85","Sep 09, 2011"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this one on tap at the Carolina Ale House in Fayetteville NC. Tastes better than I remember if from the bottle. Nice light copper color with a decent size whit head. Good retention and plentiful lacing. Smell is robust floral and citrus hops. Taste is primarily citrus hops with some balancing malt. Mouthfeel is better in the draft version. Crisp and rich enough. Good hops bitterness. Overall the drft version is even better than I remember the bottle version. Good IPA.","JayQue","Sep 07, 2011"

4.47,18.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very well balanced between hops and malts. The hops are bold and bitter, but also citrusy and sweet at the same time. Juicy grapefruit comes to mind in taste and mouthfeel. A good and balancing amount of biscuity malt is present and really makes the beer stand out. Sometimes I find that too much of a biscuit malt is overpowering in IPAs, but not the case here. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is very dry and it finishes crisp and relatively clean. A little grit in back that only furthers the experience. Alcohol is hidden very well and it only registers as an afterthought. Really just a well done beer, but make sure its fresh or that biscuit malt may take over the character. The hops in this are not to be missed.","chodinheaven","Sep 04, 2011"

Nose is that of mango, grapefruit, hops, and earthy funky-ness. Slight malt in the background. Taste is a little better. Hops are king in the taste, and the funkiness evident in the nose is completely gone in the taste. Very hoppy, dry aftertaste, w/ medium body. Ok.. I lied. Slight earthy funkiness evident in the aftertaste as the beer warms up. Decent malt backbone as well, although I'd like more malt in the taste. Not a bad IPA, but not my favorite in the style.

Way too malty for an IPA in my opinion. There is an odd aftertaste also. Watery mouthfeel…very thin. This malt bomb made the drinkability difficult for me. Overall I know this is an extremely popular beer by the masses, and that is great, I just like my IPA’s on the hoppier side.

The lacing left behind was very nice, surely above average. The aroma filled with floral hops. The mouthfeel was very nice, very smooth beer. The taste consisted of a strong malt base and was balanced by hop bitterness. Overall this was a very Safe IPA, nothing that makes it stand out other then its very good drinkability. Great entry level IPA.","GossageBrewery","Jun 25, 2011"
2.74,-27.3,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer pours a luxurious golden color that is topped off by an enticing thick foam head. The effects of the carbonation that create this creamy white cloud releases an aroma of spicy pine infused undertones that is almost overbearing when drinking. The intense bitterness hits the tongue in a refreshing way, but the after taste of pine almost ruins the experience for me. It is a well crafted beer that almost gets ruined by the intense spicy flavor of pine that I do not find in some of my other favorites IPA's.","works4beer","Jun 25, 2011"

4.2,11.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A bright straw, gorgeous looking brew with a soapy, bubbly head and tons of effervescent bubbles rising to the top. Lace is strewn about the glass. Pine, earth and weed elements in the nose, with a light caramel/bready undertone. Tastes solidly bitter, with pine, earth and dirty grapefruit. The malt comes off biscuity, and really lets the hops do all the talking. Light to medium bodied feel, sharp hop bite, right on for the style. A veritable plethora of hops, with little else. Cool with me.","Stinkypuss","Jun 20, 2011"

It is a bit on the crazy, hoppy side, and satisfies that hop-head in me, but is balanced enough to keep me drinking and refreshed. The finish could be crisper for my taste. For me, this is an IPA that finds itself in my stock at least 50% of the time. It is really enjoyable and drinkable.","BJA","Jun 18, 2011"

I find that I prefer grapefruit and citrus flavors to the pine notes, and although this one contains both, I find that the pine notes are not overwhelming. I would say that this is probably on the upper end of my hop tolerance, and while the malts are subtle, they are there and they do help balance the beer out a bit. I found this to be quite drinkable considering the hop presence and higher ABV. Not my favorite I.P.A. by any means, but definitely drinkable. Cheers!","kflorence","Jun 10, 2011"

Flavor is nice resin-pine like hops, sweet and pungent, which then reveals a cake like malt consistency, back to a slight bitterness of the hops on the finish.

A few things show up here but not in the smell, citrus and clean, clear Colorado water. Goes down very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink but not at the top of the list.

Carrying a nice medium body with heavier medium carbonation, the Ranger also offered a slick oiliness that coated my tongue and mouth while at the same time ended on a dryer note. I've gotta find out how they do that, it doesn't make sense to me that something can be oily and dry at the same time...and still taste delicious. I think the oil came from the lemon peel that was in the aroma, but the taste was more lemon-lime with touches of grapefruit rind. I was a little surprised to find that none of the citrus flavors were very pronounced or obvious despite the use of both Cascade and Chinook hops, and much of the taste came out in light unidentifiable florals and herbs. Nearing the end of my glass, I was able to pay more attention to the sweetness emanating from the liquid and recognized a light honey and a few caramel malt notes just around the edges. These were offered with some breadiness that helped me to really feel it in my mouth - making it taste stronger/thicker.","Lucklys","Jan 07, 2011"

It is by no means a wimpy IPA, but I don't feel fully satisfied with my sip after such a wonderful nose. It's not a complete let-down, it tastes pretty damn good. There's a punch of bitterness and piny flavor right from the start, and it subdues into a sweeter grapefruit hop taste. Later the malt peeks in to see what's going on, but the door is slammed in its face as the bittering hops take control and leave a VERY dry, bitter aftertaste. Some people have told me that this aftertaste is a HUGE turn-off to an otherwise remarkable beer. I say, "BRING IT", I love being hit in the face by hops, and this IPA does exactly that.","Estocker","Dec 10, 2010"

The nose comprises pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, and plenty o' caramel. The taste runs very similarly, with some added pine sap and a touch of mint and lime (mojito, anyone?). The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

With most bitter beers, you receive a bouncing sensation across the palate, much like pop-rocks.

The aroma yells grapefruit with a tiny hint of pineapple. But a weird listerine-like tone as well. Hmm, at least it's not too noticeable. Immediate honey and tangerine notes give way to a mildly grassy and herbal finish. Pine is subdued, but present. Long aftertaste of honey and grapefruit rind. Perfect carbonation and a smooth beer. Solid. I should make this a staple IPA or one to have at least a few times a month. Too bad they don't distribute around here.","DmanGTR","Sep 23, 2010"

I've had Ranger NUMEROUS times, but I think this may be the freshest I've ever had. I was never this impressed by this beer in the past.

Flowery, grapefruity and some cinnamony notes in the nose. Not sure where the latter is coming from, but it rounds out the aroma nicely. Flavor is what you'd expect in an IPA, but just the more-balanced side of the IPA world. Funyy - this comes from Colorado, which isn't quite the West Coast, and the hoppiness of this IPA is less so than those on the West side...kinda neat and regional. Finish is super-long and bitter in a good way. This is actually the best New Belgium beer I've had yet, andf it's really excellent, and excellently priced.

This beer is one of the better IPA's I have had that use cascade hops and has, like the aroma, a medium to strong citrus presence and almost completely hid its taste of alcohol. Not overly strong but definitely creeps up on you after two or three.... Again it hides its punch well. Highly recommend this beer to lovers of a more floral/citrus IPA..

Extra points given for the kick ass lace left by this one on my glass. Mild tea like hops, with some faint citrus/tropical fruits.

The taste confirmed the flavor, with the most notable aspect being balance; fruit and malt meet nicely at midpalate and then finish on a dry note. Those expecting big citrus and bitterness from their ipa's will be disappointed with this brew, but they should be careful to not discount the beer entirely, as this is a very nicely balanced one.

It seems like more and more hop forward beers (at least from American brewers) are going the citrus route, so it's always nice when I find a beer that's gone in a different direction. The taste is a little bit of a letdown, as after minimal (maybe even too little) malts upfront the hop bitterness thoroughly dominates any flavor that was hinted at in the nose. The score for taste would have been lower, but as the beer approaches room temperature this egregious imbalance begins to fade and the resinous hop flavor becomes more appreciable. The carbonation level is nice, a tad low for the style but still perfectly acceptable. The body however, as the lack of malty flavor might have suggested is entirely too thin for an IPA. The light body does lend the beer some drinkability; it drinks fairly easily. That said, I'd gladly trade some of that drinkability for a little more caramel or bready malt flavor. Ranger isn't a bad beer, it's just unfortunately brewed in a style that many breweries are a little more locked in on.","axeman9182","Jul 20, 2010"

The flavor has plenty of crisp hop bite that's citrus and herbal in nature with a bright wheat sense to it. Some caramel vanilla and grass edges.

The nose is full of those sweet citrusy American hops that we all love so much. This two finger frothy white head dissipated while I was typing. Wonderful bittering on the sides and top of the palette. Brings to mind that hops possess all of the flavours of grapefruit and the like that I do not care for, but can't get enough of here. Many of you do not know the joy of enjoying a hoppy beer with the addition of facial hair i.e. a mustache. It delivers an extra bit of bite after your palette has already gotten over the joy of the alpha acids. The finish is clean and leaves a familiar taste of an IPA. Not an overly great version of an IPA, meaning not "out there". But, it is a fully solid one to stand up to any other. In short G-d bless the Imperical Brits who's undying thirst for beer in a far away land that they were oppressing who made this beer possible. See all good has to have some bad.

Lace sticks to the sides of the glass with each sip.

The aroma was comprised of only hops. The flavor was only comprised of hops with a very slight spicy note to it. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent IPA that was very light on the hoppy flavor. It could have been a great brew if it either had something to balance the hoppy flavor present or had more hops present.

Nothing in the way of juicy fruitiness, just dry bitter, peppery hops. This is not the style of IPA that I enjoy most. Malt flavor is barely there, only a dry cracker-like quality. Underwhelming.

Points for effort, and a good effort from a large brewery. As far as a widely distributed IPA goes it's good and cheap, not the bestm but by no means the worst. This is an example of a popular brewery bringing more styles to the masses, an attempt to convert more people to craft beer.

Nice citrusy pressence, grapefruit, lemon and pine resin all present and pretty much all that is discernable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a frothy carbonation and slightly drying mouthfeel.

Personally the tangerine/orange/grapefruit sweet and sourness gets to be a little much and makes it hard for me to enjoy more than one or two. I prefer a more straight forward clean bitter flavor with more of a malt backbone in an IPA. That being said, it is plenty bitter in the finish.

Pretty good, but honestly, when there is Pliny at the same store I got this at, I'd rather spend a dollar fifty more to get that.

I maybe was harsh on the taste score, but this is where the big boys come out to play. This is not a repeat buy, especially since the price point is not much better when looking at sixers (even though I can't find bombers of any kind of hoppy beers at this price).

Too much of the rind/peel factor and not enough of the actual fruit flavors. It struck me as pretty bitter (more than I expected anyway) which is neither good nor bad just an observation. I will say that I felt it needed a bit more malt to balance out the bitterness and more of the juicy fruit flavors as opposed to the earthier orange peel/pine type notes. Mouthfeel was OK but maybe a bit undercarbonated. A bit of an unpleasant finish in my estimation.

Aromas is fruity with pear and grapefruit, bright flora with a pleasant sweetness. Hops are not too intense, but very nice balance between them and also with the malt. Smells maltier than it looks, then it ends up tasting hoppier than it smells. Grapefruit and pine explode on the palate with a great full bitterness for a floral and slight cookie finish that is fairly dry. This one totally exceeds my expectations in the flavor department. This is a serious IPA. Full prickly carbonation, though a tad on the lighter side in body, the only issue that prevents this beer from being a straight up "A" quality.

This one, however, is definitely a good settle IPA. Looks great with some incredible white head that laces with the best of them. Color is pretty too, a nice golden oak color, with plenty of tiny bubbles rising up from the bottom. The nose isn't too powerful, some pine and maybe lemon zest notes, though the lack of strength could be due to the density of the head. Taste is pretty good for a decent IPA, simple caramel malt, piney hops, a bit of herbal hops, and that's about it. Not too much to think about, though it's exactly what I wanted--a simple, easy-drinking IPA. MF is medium to light-bodied, smooth, a bit dry on the finish. Drinkability is huge, a great session beer, though definitely not my favorite IPA.

It was so watery and bland that I almost felt like I was drinking a pale ale. I also noticed that it seems to have that "fat tire" after taste. Not sure if its the malts or yeast that they use.

Lemon rind, grapefruit and grassy hops come through with just slight bit of toast. Also at the very tail of the aroma is a smell that I can only describe as earthy. The flavor is a bit more hoppy then the aroma but is still toned down from what I expect from an American IPA. Lemon rind, grapefruit, just a bit of pine. White bread and just a little medicinal bitterness at the tail. The mouthfeel is very light and for as oily as its appearance is, it really doesn't coat the mouth in hop bitterness like many of the best American IPA's. The drinkability is about average.

4.13,9.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Mouthfeel is very soft and smooth. That greatly increases the drinkability. I like this a lot better than Fat Tire. This may be my new favorite everyday New Belgium.","bort11","Feb 03, 2010"
4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I have had mixed feelings about the last few New Belgium brews I have had lately,this is a clear winner in my book.Poured into a standard pint glas a clear medium golden with tight formed 1/2 finger white head that left shotty lace as it settled into an almost creamy mass.Nice shot of the Simcoe hops in the nose,sharp and citric, with a little herb.Flavors are well balanced at first with pine and citric hop melding well with a hefty caramel base,a big shot of sharp herbal leafiness hits in the finish.I think a very well rounded IPA with a alot of different hop components going on.","oberon","Feb 03, 2010"
3.45,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"- Great drinkability.. but not really that great for the style. I am used to a bready, not-so-sweet IPA. Its good though... and I am sure would be nice to have a pint or two on tap.","Docer","Feb 03, 2010"
3.75,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"D: Good drinkability. I could certainly drink more than one, but it wouldn't be my first pick, in terms of an IPA.","HopEnforcer","Feb 03, 2010"
3.52,-6.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The body and drinkabilty were both average for the style. Overall, this was a very decent beer, much better than I expected from this brewery. Certainly worth your time.","beertunes","Feb 02, 2010"

4.5,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Green, fresh hop cone nose, with some underlying bready malt. Flavors are bright, with lemony, minty hops coming through uninhibited by much malt sweetness. The malt profile is lean and biscuit-like, and stays in the background. Bitterness is clean and refined; mouthfeel is smooth and silky with fine carbonation. The green hop flavors integrate perfectly with the slightly doughy malt, resulting in a clean, bright, balanced IPA. Clearly one of the finest IPAs being made today, and from a brewery large enough to offer consistency, value and availability. A staple of mine.","bcm119","Feb 01, 2010"
3.97,5.3,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"I will try the Ranger again for the sake of fairness but so far I would only buy it if it was one of the few IPA's to choose from.","unHipHopHead","Feb 01, 2010"
3.63,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D- This is a fairly light IPA with loads of grassy hop flavors that would fare well on a hot summer day. It's not a great beer, but I would definitely buy this again to bring to a BBQ or to keep around for friends and family to try.","Tdizzle","Jan 31, 2010"
2.86,-24.1,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Middle of the road beer, nothing impessive about this one. Way too many other good IPAs to go back to this one. Sorry New Belgium.","bonsreeb85","Jan 31, 2010"
3.4,-9.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle. This poured a golden color with a white head. This was a typical New Belgum beer to me, not always a bad thing. I have not had a lot of their products but they seem to lack complexity. To me it just was not hoppy enough for an IPA. It still was very smooth and easy drinking. I will try it again.","Brettster","Jan 30, 2010"
3.51,-6.9,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D - very pleasant hop aroma and a taste that invites you back for more. an ipa on the somewhat lighter side, though.","revolution","Jan 30, 2010"
3.15,-16.4,2.5,2.5,3,4,4,"The carbonation was good. Gave it an above average mouthfeel. If I forget the mislabelling of calling this an IPA, this would be good on a hot summer day sitting around the BBQ pit. I could put a few away. But, given the number of good, reasonably priced West Coast IPAs that I have access to, I doubt I'll spend my money on this.","BuckeyeOne","Jan 30, 2010"

3.92,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I picked up a 22oz bottle to try this again and I'm glad I did. Nice hop flavours here with some grape fruitand pine and some nice grass. Malt is hiding in the background but does enough to make it noticed. Nice bitter and short aftertaste and makes this quite drinkable. I guess the last time I tried it my mood just wasn't right. Scores adjusted.","Bitterbill","Jan 24, 2010"
3.37,-10.6,4,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass at around cellar temp. Golden color with a tinge of orange, fluffy off-white head. Aroma is immediately Simcoe, but its character is well-balanced with the other hops here. Sometimes Simcoe-heavy beers are catty but not this one. Candied grapefruit and some skunky weed, resin. I like this aroma quite a bit. Unfortunately it doesn't really translate into the flavor. Pale malt shines through up front, which is always a bad sign. The hops dominate the aroma but fade to an afterthought in the taste. Still I get a little citrus and a faint but distinct melon note. Nice long bitterness but also some astringency. Not a sweet beer at all, which is a good foundation for my ideal IPA, but the hops just never show up. Another victim of the laughable "well-balanced IPA" paradigm I guess. Dry finish, but again, in an astringent way. Easy to drink but uninteresting.","illidurit","Jan 22, 2010"
4.07,8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: The malt throws me off on this one as I'm not a fan but the blend of hops makes up for it. I could, and will, drink several of these. If you're a hop head you can count on this one to satisfy you. If you're just breaking into the hoppy beers this is still one you'd want to try.","BrewIndy","Jan 22, 2010"
4.17,10.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Very drinkable. Hop smell and taste is strong, and would satisfy hop heads, is also mellow/fresh and not overwhelming or bitter. I could drink several of these.","jwillcourt","Jan 21, 2010"
3.98,5.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"quite drinkable. i only have a 12oz. pour and yet i can easily see into the future. this could easily be a starter for the novice who wants a solid, well-crafted IPA, but may be frightened by a more assertive and bitter offering. this beer screams session if an IPA should truly be sessioned.","eyncognito","Jan 20, 2010"
4.8,27.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I picked this up at whole foods fresh off the truck.. Looking at the bottle there is a unfiltered cloudiness in the lower 1/3 of the bottle.. While pouring I noticed quite a strong floral hop aroma very impressed in this from NB.. The first taste was exceptional there was three levels of of flavor, from instant bite to a strong malt in the middle, then a bitter finish.. Overall very impressed in NB for this one they made it thier way with thier own malt and house yeast.. A","harlanhu28","Jan 15, 2010"
4.15,10.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. To be honest I am quite shocked that it is from New Belgium. I can only hope this is a new trend with them. Good IPA for people who love Fat Tire and know nothing else of craft beer. This could be my go to IPA if the cash flow is low.","alleykatking","Jan 12, 2010"
4.15,10.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D: This is an impressive IPA. It's got the bitterness, citrus, and all that goes into beers of this style, yet it is mellow enough that it could easily be a session beer.","WYVYRN527","Jan 08, 2010"
3.45,-8.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"D: All in all, a solid effort. New Belgium always has well made products. This is by no means going to make me ditch the San Diego hop efforts, but should be an inexpensive IPA making it something I'd pick up now and again.","Halcyondays","Jan 07, 2010"
4.72,25.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Very nice beer from our friends at new Belgium. 70 ibu's but you don't get that tipical hop hit that you would expect. Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoy this brew and the fact that new Belgium is doing something new is awsome. I think more and moe breweries need to start doing more hoppy, ipa high alcohol beers. Bang for your buck I say.","LiveOakMarket","Jan 07, 2010"
4.14,9.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. As it seems most people posting are liquor store employees. This muddy copper colored beer poured off with a fair amount of head that reduced down to rim of the glass lacing. The aroma that lofts from the beer is citrus and a clean hop smell. Really aromatic. The taste is that of a clean hopped beer both during the brewing cycle and a dry hop flavoring. The tones of grapefruit lead through toward the aftertaste of the brew. A slight amount of a watered down taste also peaks through. Overall a averaged IPA. It will be interesting to see if this takes off or if it actually just stays like the abby, blue paddle and mothership wit.","Tolnik","Jan 06, 2010"
4.13,9.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A well-made IPA, quite sessionable, and what I'd expect from New Belgium. Why they didn't do this earlier I don't know, but at least this presumably long awaited beer lives up to what it should be.","wnh","Jan 03, 2010"
4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability is awesome. This one sampling won't last more than a few minutes. Really well crafted IPA. I would have to say this is the best beer I've had from NB thus far. Looking forward to this one being available soon.","jera1350","Dec 31, 2009"
4.19,11.1,4,5,4,2.5,4.5,"Pre-release sample courtesy of my favorite pub. Pours a golden color with a thick white head. Huge cascade/grapefruit aroma. Very surprising for NB to use so many hops. Very well balanced with a fair amount of bitterness. Only thing that was really disapointing was the body which was on the lighter side. Still a very drinkable session IPA.","bigbelcher","Dec 31, 2009"
