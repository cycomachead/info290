"O: very tasty IPA.  This one I would seek out again!"

"Bottled 9/24/14 and this has changed a lot since the last time I drank it.  It says 100 day IPA and drink fresh on the bottle, but I think it has gotten better with time!  Last time I drank it when it was more fresh it seemed like a solid IPA dominated by the typical IPA tartness.  Now it seems like the hops have mellowed as it is less hoppy and now more malt forward and balanced.  Now it actually reminds me a lot of Bigfoot.  It is very smooth, with a nice, but not overbearing sweetness.  It still has some tart hop flavors which give it a nice balance."

"Found a case of 22oz bottles at Costco Chico after leaving the brewery.  Death asterisks at Costco. which means it will be gone soon.  I recommend checking the selection at Chico Costco before stopping by the brewery.  They usually have four to five offerings from Sierra Nevada.  I love it, should have bought 2 but unable to taste at the brewery.  Wonderful beer and a great value compared to the Pliny the Elder that I purchased last Tuesday.  Both great beers but the huge price gap."

"A very interesting flavor, not at all what I expected. Was my first wet hopped beer."

"O- a pretty unique hop, with a great mouthfeel to boot, very nice IPA"

"It's alright. Subtle notes of different things but not the body I was hoping for"

"Counterpart - Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hops - is so much better."

"Had out of bottle and was close to the 100 day window so I think this is unfair to rate. Tasted a little stale. I'm sure much better when fresh"

"Overall: Sierra Nevada's Northern Hemisphere Harvest is an interesting display of a more floral/earthy hop rather than the typical piney or citrusy American hops that characterize our IPA's these days. Definitely not my favorite IPA, but a very interesting and pleasant experience that introduced new flavors to my palate. The beer is still solid and very quaffable, and I will likely try this again."

"How does it get a 93??  This is a B, B- beer AT BEST. It's got so much potential, and comes off when you taste it like it just isn't there.  It's not bad, there is some hop to it, and some pine notes. But overall, it's weak. Much weaker than I expected given the reviews."

"O = A nice balanced IPA Not a hop bomb. Nicely done!"

"First of all this bottle says 16.8 ounces but it looks totally ginormous. Anyway, benign nose and taste is malt forward. Two strikes. However it kinda grew on me. Not great but not bad."
"O-Decent beer not exactly what I was expecting so maybe thats throwing me off a bit"

"Pours dark amber with thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are out of this world.  Aroma not very strong but can discern a nice piney hop, floral components and slightly citric aroma.  Maybe some slight caramel.  Bready, malty taste, ending in a mod piney hop.  The malt to hop transition is subtle and carries a decent caramel taste throughout.  Strong, good bitter aftertaste.  Decent beer, but not the best that Sierra Nevada has to offer."

"Sierra Nevada Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA -----4/5."
"Very accurately dated to 9/24/14 4:52."

"This wet hop IPA is outstanding. The  1 PT. 8 FL. oz bottle states that it is a 100-day IPA, drink fresh and don't store. The IPA boasts an awesome hoppy flavor with some citrus and a slight pine finish. A bit more smooth than the Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA. I am definitely not sipping this one. I wish this was available in 12oz. bottles. Enjoy!"

"Picked up a couple of IPAs on a good deal at Costco today.  Wasn't sure if it was going to be this one or Chasin' Freshies that I wanted to crack first, but the Bros did it in for me.  Can this really be a 100 point IPA?  24oz of 2014 Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA, served in a pint glass.  Beer pours surprisingly dark amber in color, with a large paler amber head on top.  Aroma provides all the requisite piny and citrusy West coast IPA notes.  Oh, but the flavors are what really nail it.  I feel like I can taste the individual corners of this pine cone and trace the curves of the grapefruit with my tongue.  For such a high alpha, hoppy ale there's a really impressive depth and complexity here.  The malt body of this beer does not disappoint, absolutely playing a secondary role, but it's not just there for filler -- it provides both balance and flavor."
""
"Poured from bottle into a big pilsner glass. Pours reddish with a large white head with good retention. Smells of sweet pine and toasted malts. Sweet pine taste with some notes of resin that linger. easy to drink. definitely picking up some more next release."
""
""
""
""
"O) well put together beer.  Very balanced.  Not as sweet as other ""harvest"" ales out there but I assume that is the hops used.  Likable and quaffable beer.  I like it."
""
""
""
"Poured into a DFH Signature Snifter. Pours a beautiful amber color with a one finger, slightly off white head. Has great retention and lacing as well. Has a slightly sweet pine scent that wasn't as strong as I expected. The taste follows the scent but has some sweet caramel like characteristics to it. It was much more sweet than I expected and is very balanced. Overall a super tasty and drinkable fresh hop IPA by Sierra Neveda that I will definitely look forward to each year."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint.  Pours a medium bronze amber with a fine one finger light khaki head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel, slightly toasty malt, citrus and pine hops. Flavor closely follows aroma, dominated by a rich caramel, lightly toasted malt, blended citrus and pine hops, lightly resinous. Medium bodied with light creaminess, nice mouth feel. A well balanced wet hop ale with a non-herbal, but flavorful hop component, almost reminiscent of a well hopped English IPA, although the hop varieties are typically Western US. Nice lingering resinous hop finish. Sierra Nevada IPAs never disappoint and this is a fine one. Not as intensely herbal hop flavored, but beautifully balanced and satisfying. Missed this Northern variant over the last few years. These don't sit on the shelf long."

"Overall:  Great quality, as expected.  Doesn't disappoint.  Wish there were more wet hop options in these parts."
"Lots of floral hops backed by citrusy flavors and some malty sweetness to complement."
"24 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/24/2014. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, mango, caramel, toasted bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/earthy hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, mango, pine, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, mango, pine, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of juicy citrus/earthy hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent wet hop IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall pretty nice but not great, it has some good hops that come through nicely on the aroma but are quite lacking on the flavor, malts are nice but hard to see that in an IPA, more like an amber or even brown ale, nice bitterness, great mouth feel, but just lacking that hop profile on the flavor to really kick this up."

"A very well done IPA. Big, fresh hop character with just enough malt to keep it balanced."
"Wow. This was unbelievably great. The smell was good, but it was the smooth taste that stole the show. The pine is met with a honey/sweet malty sweetness that just makes you smile. The citrus is more subtle, but it plays a nice role. I'm still blown away by how frothy the head remained. I would drink this every day."

"Overall, not as hoppy as previous vintages, however wet hop beers tend to be a little subtle compared to normal 100ibu hop bombs. A beautiful example of the Wet Hop IPA. I would buy it again."
""
"Golden on pour, with a huge head that dissipates slowly.  Hoppy, well balanced with malt and fruit aromas.  Bitterness at start, then sweet, then finishes bitter.  Fairly dry palate, but with a long finish."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its flavoring, which is helped along by that full and robust pull to the mouthfeel. We were actually disappointed on the first sniff of this one, as we felt the malts were somewhat overpowering to what we figured would be a bright hop-filled nose. The taste, on the other hand, brings a whole new perspective to it, as it should. The grain bill was wildly complex, sparring intensely with its unexpectedly bittered hoppy counterparts. Not sure why we were so surprised to have a bitter IPA from a classically west coast-centric brewery, but I guess the nose just got us thinking down an initially divergent path. This is one heavy, malty, and hoppy beer, and with all of the right components in eventual unison, most beer fans will find something they like about this guy. This, coupled with the Southern Hemisphere, is a really fun and tasty idea for a series, and they absolutely nail it."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL - (READ THIS IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH THE LOW SCORE) - go ahead and consider this a review of a past-its-prime SN Harvest. I considered scrapping this review but I don't think it's useless, as it can serve those who possess old bottles of this beer, so I'm letting it ride. I'll try to pick some up fresh this fall and re-review."

"Overall: Excellent. Would love to try more wet hop brews, a very unique hop character"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is an excellent IPA. Tasty. Complex. I personally love the more fruity notes of grapefruit and other citrus that take a back seat here, but the result is nevertheless both satisfying and an excellent example of what an IPA can be without being a blast of fruit and bitterness. I'd pick this one up again."
""
""
"O- this is a great seasonal IPA from Sierra Nevada."

"Overall - Very interesting beer for both the brewing and consumption. Never overdoes any single aspect of the beer leading to a wonderful product, overall. Significantly different from your standard American IPA and well worth a tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good hoppy IPA that also has a touch of American Amber Ale. The aroma could be bolder though."
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a softly foamy (3/4) and smooth (1/4) mouthfeel that fits the style and the beer quite well. Closes dry, with low stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""

"O-great IPA I was quite impressed especially with the everlasting head. I can't wait to try the Southern Hemisphere harvest!"

"O: Wow. What an accidental score. I got this only because I scratched off the other ones on the board just because I had already had them or was not interested. Not only that but I got it at a discount. I hope they have some more left tomorrow cause I am going to kill this growler tonight. WOOOOHOOO! This is definitely a beer you want to get hold of if you can during the harvest season. Way to go Sierra Nevada!!!"

"2013 bottle. Pours a clear amber with an outstanding head that laces just as well. Nose is hoppy of pine and grapefruit with a slight malt undertone. Light medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. The taste is well balanced between hop flavor and bitterness and a touch of malt sweetness. Neither pine or grapefruit flavor predominate. Clean finish with lingering moderate grapefruit bitterness. Quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best-looking beers I've ever seen, and a rather tasty one at that. As before, I prefer my hops a little more on the citrus end of the spectrum, but I'd gladly have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I kept wanting to like this, as it is perceived well. I just keep picking up soap and caramel. Has a funky after taste. I wonder if its old maybe? A revisit is in order next year~"
""
""
""
""
"O - highly recommended. Really digging the wet hop harvest style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(edit: retried today, and stand by original assessment except so expound that the dry earthiness does tend to linger quite long - x2 on re-re-review 11/2014.)"
""
""
""
"Lovely seasonal brew for harvest time of year. Could use a little more distinction in the hop character, and maybe a little more balance. But Definitely fun and worth a drink."
"Silly Sierra Nevada date code; definitely not 326, because that's the future. Has to be fresh within the last month or two, though, as it's currently mid-November."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: while it does taste like ""just another"" American IPA in most respects, it's still worth seeking out if you're a hop head; very, very bitter but with a lot of other taste to keep it interesting; the strong bitter bite very well could be a bit fresher, but i hesitate to decare this brew the freshest of the wet-hop ales (the one I'm drinking is almost 2 months old ... I wonder what it would taste like just 1 month old or younger?)"
""
""
""
"Overall - a quality brew from a quality brewery!"
""
"O - A very drinkable and enjoyable IPA. Much different from all the West Coast styles out there today. It was a nice change of pace and shows that the other hops are still very very good. A very different beer that I'd be more than happy to drink again"

"Pours a clear amber, with a frothy, creamy 2 finger head. Great, citrus, hoppy aroma. Mild malty backbone. Well balanced and delicious. Very smooth, drinkable with a light mouthfeel. It's a dangerous 6.7%, but drinks easier. Overall, really pleased."

"Overall, I was very much impressed by this IPA. Bravo!"
""

""
""

"overall a great fresh hop IPA!"
""
"Taste has lots of grassy, grapefruity, earthy hops mixed perfectly with some sweet caramelly malt. The finish is clean, with only a little bit of lingering bitterness that doesn't stay long, and leaves you wanting another sip. A few more tastes leave me with a nut aftertaste."
"Overall, it's a really great, balanced hoppy beer. It's definitely hop-forward, but not at all a hop-bomb, which is refreshing. Overall, the hops are almost evenly balanced by the malts, and the hops only barely win out on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a beer that defines the word ""balance"" when it comes to the American IPA. Although this is made by Sierra Nevada, you definitely can not call it a West Coast-style IPA, so hop heads should not go to this beer looking for their ""hop-fix"". This is a very good beer that I would definitely like to find a few more of while I can."
"This beer is basically a red IPA/amber ale. Still extremely drinkable and simple, but hoppy and tasty (and cheap at $4.50 for a bomber)."

""

"Overall: Nothing better than an IPA with fresh hops. Very delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a thick, quickly dissipating white head. Settles into a frothy cap. Good lacing. Not the hop bomb I thought it would be. Faint citrus, pine, grassiness and hints of malt on the nose. Bitter hop notes throughout the palate with spiciness mid-palate that finishes dry and bitter. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted fresh-hop ale."
"I can't complain that this was a bad beer, its so much nicer than many. Just hate that dark caramel flavor when I expect grassy bright hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MF – Crisp, medium bodied with a dry finish."
""
"O: Not what I was expecting. Kind of like a red ipa or a rye. Taste is more cascade than centennial I'd say. Well balanced, and very tastey brew. More of a beer drinkers beer than a hop heads beer. Which is good if youre going solo on a bomber. The price is right. Its kinda the ultimate session beer."
""
"O - What can I say, my expectations were very high and this one threw me a curveball. Not a bad beer by any means, but not special in my eyes. Looking forward to the spring (as I always do) to try out the Southern Hemisphere."
""
""
""
"Actually kinda dissapointed with this one, to mouthfeel is just SOOOO thin it really takes away from the beer in my opinion, theres also not too much overall aroma which I think SN usually does a good job with both."
""
"O - In a blind taste test, I would not call this an IPA... perhaps a cross between a Rye and a Pale Ale. Somewhat boring. Not unpleasant in any way, but the smell and taste which I consider most important are not wholly remarkable. Cheers to those who think highly of this beer, but I will not repeat."
""
"Overall, this is an expertly crafted beer with a simple concept. I love everything about it... the shorter, fatter, 24 oz bottle as opposed to your typical 22 oz bomber, great label art, fresh hops with great malt balance, and excellent drinkability. Well done, Sierra Nevada. Highly recommended."

"Overally, this is truly one of the best hop experiences I have had, maybe its placebo but there is something just so damn delicious about this beer."
"UPDATE 11/6/14: 2014 version bottled 9/24/14, same day I surmised last year's bottle was capped, but now they have the date in an easily readible form (thanks SN!).  Poured into the same glass used last year too.  Same rich appearance, strong grassy aroma rather than last year's pine suggests super fresh wet hops.  More grassy notes dominate the flavor as well, in fact the most grass-dominated flavor of any IPA I have had yet.  I appreciate that more now that I have had a lot of Heady Topper and Be Hoppy under my belt this past year.  Mouthfeel not silky smooth though, but rather dominated by heavy carbonation, which was evident from the first pour with the enormous white head.  Overall a bit different from last year's for me, but tastewise even more amazing.  Will leave my ratings as is (although this year the mouthfeel rating would drop to 3.75)  and again be looking for more SNNHHWHA, a good value at $5 per 24 oz."
"The lacing on this beer is fantastic! If Picasso worked in head foam, it would look like this. It has an excellent citrus and hop aroma almost as if you are at the farm itself. A light, semi-airy mouth feel makes this American IPA extraordinary. Sierra Nevada hit a homerun with this one and I would prefer this one over its Southern hemisphere counterpart. I will.definitely go buy 1or 2 more bottles before they are gone."
""
"O: One hell of a good IPA. I prefer this over southern hemisphere. A must try at a great price."
""
"Overall- First time trying and its great. So fresh and so tasty. Gonna look forward to this from now on."
"O: Another great one from Sierra Nevada. This beer delivers for those wanting big hop flavor but is so well balanced and supremely drinkable. This one ranks up there with my favorite IPA's of the year."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers, not just IPA's, and the cost-point only improves the rating on this brew. IMO one of the top value buys you can make in the craft beer world. Seek out as many as you're willing to go through before the hops start to fade. The gentleman's Enjoy By haha. Cheers."

"More malty than anticipated, which works for me. Hop bitterness isn't overwhelming or harsh, and the flavoring tends a bit toward the resiny side, but citrus is well represented."
"I've always been a fan of Sierra Nevada's North and South Hemisphere offerings, and this does nothing to change that."

"Overall, a thoroughly amazing beer. The hop aroma and flavor is just out of this world and a very nice solid malt backbone as well. A must have beer and one I will pick up again before this year's supply runs out."

"Poured into becker pint glass. Dark orange with a beautiful, thick fluffy white head that isn't going anywhere fast. Smells floral and hoppy, a bit of citrus, and clean malts in the background. Taste is incredibly well-balanced; a bit spiky up front, but it smooths out in the middle and finishes with a delightfully bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste seems to also have an aftertaste, which is sweet again. Love this beer."

"Tasty stuff - a beer of substance. Plenty of hops, as might be expected for a wet hop brew. Looks fantastic, and the aroma/flavour are solid. I'm a little surprised the alcohol comes through as much as it does, but there you go. Good body. Quality - might be a bit late to find one now, but if you do see it in the future it is well worth your while."

"The appearance intrigues. Copper colouration with a majestically thick, lacy head. I see this beer. I want this beer. Furthermore, not only do carbon bubbles ascend, but some sorts of fragments descend. Hops? Unsure. The mouthfeel also intrigues. Initial carbonation gives way quickly to smooth silkiness, even when gulped rather than sipped. The nose is much as the taste: bright, nutty malt matched with subtle hop over/unders. Complexity abounds. No. Hemis. Wet Hop demands digestion of both the mind and stomach. All-important aftertaste leaves one satisfied, but desiring a bit more. Intriguing."

"Overall: a very good example of a good-quality, flavoursome American IPA. I am a bit sick olf the usual ""whop the hops in an hope for the best"" AIPAs that have no taste. This one is clean, crisp and distinctly flavoursome. A very nice beer, that whilst a bit dear at AU$80 a case of 12 x 710mL, is a darn site better than half of the worse, but more expensive AIPAs out there."

"Great SN AIPA. The color is deep orange/amber with a hint of red? The head is sticky lacy and lingering until the last drop. Te smell is sort of fruity, but also is reminiscent of freshly cut grass. The citrus/grassy/earthy bitterness of this beer is just fabulous. Am I the only one also tasting a bit of rye on the body? Unlike the Estate from Sierra Nevada, this one is not 100% organic, but it kind of taste like it. The wet hop method truly adds to flavor and aromatics."

It's not overpoweringly bitter and the ABV is manageable which allows one to work through a 24oz bottle with ease. I am really glad I picked this beer up."

"Pours a clear brownish red with a fair amount of chunky tan head that clings to the glass. Smells of citrusy hops and malty sweetness. The taste is heavy hoppiness with a small amount of malt, but mostly of hops. it's not so much bitter as it is just citrusy hop flavor. Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, very nice. Overall, if you love hops, this is a great beer for you."

"o - well crafted, but honestly not doing much for me. of all the hop harvest beers i have tried this season (founders harvest, broodoo, millking ray, hopivore) this ones near the bottom, and i prefer the southern hemisphere version over this one. maybe i'll try again next year."
""
"O: Sierra Nevada's hoppy beers never cease to amaze me. This beer is intense, balanced, and absolutely delicious. I'm very impressed."
""
""
"Overall – This one lives up to it reputation. Another wonderful beer from SN. It reminds me of a more complex and hoppier version of their celebration ale. Now I just need to track down the Southern version when that rolls around."
"This is a phenomenal beer. With SN, you never are disappointed. Good bang for the bucks. I just love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer... wish it came in six packs of bottles that were twice as big."
""
"The Northern Hemisphere Harvest Ale lacks the slight sweetness of its Southern Hemisphere cousin. I prefer very little sweetness in an IPA and therefore prefer this beer to the Southern Hemisphere variety (which is still quite good). This beer is very reminiscent of Celebration Ale."

"O...very nice brew. Very complex, enjoyable beer. Highly recommend."

""
""
"Overall: A very interesting and delicate flavor from this “wet hop” brew. Sweet raspberries to start, floral notes in the middle and ashy tones to finish, this beer has terrific complexity and a depth of balance that indicates deliberate, knowledgeable construction. The mouthfeel isn’t as profound as the flavors, but otherwise, this is a hell of a brew, and a treat for the pallet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Years ago, the Southern Hemisphere version of this beer was one of the first IPAs that woke me up to the wonderful extremes of the style. The Northern is no exception. What an annual treat."
""
""
"A beer of the highest quality. This is why I drink quality over quantity."
""
"I really don't like this beer all that much. I find it to be unbalanced, overly bitter, and without a whole lot of depth of flavor. Don't plan on drinking it again. Chalky and dry. Blech."
"o: If I compare this to Founders Harvest Ale, Founders wins going away. It's not a knock on this. It just makes me appreciate the Founders that much more. This is good but a bit more malty than what I would have liked."
""
""
"I know that SN is easily passes up for not pushing the envelope enough but the never come up short. This is a great beer that is overlooked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into nb globe at crescent in Omaha. Pours. A brownish burnt orange with lots of sticky thick head. Nice fresh hop and biscuit aromas. The taste is mild bitter biscuit malts at first but finishes with a great fresh pineapple citrus hop. Really nice finish. This is a great brew and they seemed to capture a fall feeling in an ipa. Nice."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL/NOTES: Consumed with lemon-chili corn nuts that are a bit too spicy, but really made those citrus notes POP. Most certainly a good, strong IPA. Lemon bread as a potential food partner? Must try this soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is good, but I won't run out for another or anything. I just don't think I like the caramel malts in an American IPA."
"Pours a deep orange, rust color with fine, extensive puffy foam and substantial and extensive lacing. Smells malt, and very hoppy; pine and resin and citrus rind and complex and, maybe just expecting it, straight-out fresh smelling. Tastes bitter bitter bitter bitter in the best way possible. Terrific balance, the bitterness modulating in different ways, with nice sustain; more pine than citrus and fruit, but both present. Striking detail in the flavors, and a moderate and well-defined backbone of malt. Carbonation and mouth-feel is well defined, a bit leaning to DIPA's slightly thicker flow. I hope there's still some at the store."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty clear amber big fluffy head tons of lace. Fresh big aroma of ripe melon and berry, wow. Fresh taste follows, lots of pine, green grass, delightful grapefruit finish. The flavor and aroma is so deep and rich, making a delicious, extremely drinkable treat. Fresh hops at their best. Outstanding. Get one."

""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious wet hop ale. Always loved the mouthfeel of these beers (northern and southern, founders harvest, etc). You can practically feel the hops and hop oils lingering in the beer. Very tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"Interested in trying other wet hop ales. Founders Harvest is up next - this one is a tough act to follow."
""
""
"O- this is a fine wet hop ale. Well balanced and just a wet, mouth watering ale. Glorious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am tending towards the wet hop ales lately. It's becoming my favorite time of the year. I can actually enjoy the malt flavors in the beer while still getting a strong hop presence without the mouth drying over the top bitterness of some beers. This beer is a very good example of a fresh hop ale. I'm definitely going to reach for this every year...and at $5 a bottle it's a steal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit of a letdown. I remember this as a bigger winner last year. Perhaps my bottle sat a few weeks longer on the shelf than I'd have liked, or maybe it's the batch. Either way, it's a middle-tier IPA. Maybe I shouldn't have drank this one after I had a few Lagunitas DayTimes."
"O: Beautiful work by Sierra Nevada. I think this is a bit better than the Southern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop Ale from New Zealand, as it is a bit more balanced and extra drinkable. Looking forward to getting some Celebration soon to kick off the holiday season right!"

"2012 vintage served in a tulip pint. Pours a translucent copper with a dense, creamy, butter-milk colored head embedded with clusters of tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a creamy dollop with textured strands of lacing evident as the brew recedes. Nose expresses citrus, light piny notes and a trace of earthiness and rind. Taste follows nose; however, there is also a mild, caramel maltiness that sits in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an easy carbonation and just a kiss of acidity. Overall, a really well-balanced and easy drinking American IPA. There aren't a lot of nuances to this beer; however, it is really pleasant and quite drinkable. I can't believe I haven't tried this sooner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very well made beer, and at less than $5 for a 24 oz bottle its a hell of a deal. The fresh wet hops are on certainly display but are balanced by a great malty base. I could drink this year round."
""
"I was actually very disappointed in the bottled version of this beer. I had high expectations and excitement because we don't get many fresh hop beers on the East Coast. Maybe this has lost the hop strength during the trip across the country and it may have sat in the distributor's warehouse for a while seeing as it's now early November. When I had this beer on-tap last November in Arizona, it was later in the month but had a much stronger hop presence. This has lost nearly all of the hop flavor. There's none of it. It's all malt. The malt flavor isn't bad but considering this is supposed to be a fresh/wet hop beer, I don't get it. Disappointed and confused. Hopefully Estate tastes better on Sunday."
"O: Easy to drink because of the pleasant wet hop flavors and well hidden ABV - enjoyable and one I will look forward to getting again next year. Overall the flavors are well balanced with a good amount of complexity."
"Been dancing around this one for years, figured it was time to finally take it down. It pours a clear brass-amber topped by a finger of lightly sandy cream-white foam. The nose comprises pine needles, caramel, sweet toffee, and a bit of lemon zest. This isn't to say that it smelled old or anything, but rather it smelled more balanced than I imagined a wet hop from SN to be. The taste holds notes of pine resin, light cedar, mild caramel, light menthol, and a kiss of spearmint. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice wet hop, one that maintains a healthy balance without disregarding or canceling out the wet hop addition. Still, it is a bit one-sided in terms of hop flavor, but this isn't a total negative, as it works well with it."
"O: Besides the weird mix of scents in the nose, this one is an absolute winner. This is darker, sweeter, and heavier than Southern Hemisphere, making it drink almost like a barleywine; just what I was looking for in an autumn IPA. One of the best values in beer I’ve had this year – I’d be happy to buy it if it were double the price (disregard that statement, Sierra Nevada…please keep it low)."
"O: Big, resinous hop notes, bright citrus and rich candy caramel abound. High bitterness, smooth and easy drinking. Dead on and a great Wet Hop IPA!"
""
""
"Overall: Sierra Nevada has done it again with a great representation of the style. It is a shame that this beer, by its very nature, cannot be brewed year-round. This beer just pushed wet-hopped ales that much closer to being my favorite style, which is unfortunate given their limited releases. This is art in a bottle. Keep it up, Chico, California. 18/20"
""
"O) I think this is the best wet hop ale I've enjoyed to date. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: So smooth and so creamy. Fulled side of medium and is so soft on the palate. Carbonation is low. The finish is quuck and too the point. Nice juicy ""wet hop"" feel to it."
"I get a bouquet of sweet citrus, tangerine and orange marmalade in a perfume, followed by a flavor that’s lightly bitter with some piney orange resin notes and a long, dry, piney finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"RJT"
""
"Taste is definitely hop-forward, too, but well-balanced. I get pine most emphatically, with a lingering maltiness at the finish. Overall, very tasty and a great value, running about $4 on average for the 220z.bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured a deep golden- amber and had a beautiful creamy white head. Very clear and glowing. Gave off nice hoppy floral scent as well as a light malty-ness. Taste of full on hops but not overly bitter. More mild than I expected. Has a steady lacing. Beer has a clean, balanced feel and a mild, dry citrus zest finish. What's interesting is that the more I drink this, the more hoppy. It keeps building on the finish. I could drink a lot of this in a short time. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a nice wet hop IPA. I’m not going to lie; I expected this to be hoppier in both the aroma and the taste. However, I began to realize that a big dose of hops are in this thing at the finish. Bitterness and spice just keep building and building and finally linger on the palate for what seems like forever. This beer is also very well-balanced for one that is meant to showcase fresh hops. Other pluses are that it looks fantastic (standard for Sierra Nevada) and the mouthfeel is phenomenal. It is so sticky and chewy and the bitterness and spice seem to linger endlessly. Great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"O: Not something I wanted to spend $6 on, especially not 2...."
"A good but not great wet hop IPA. I enjoyed it but for the money there are a couple others that I prefer."
"O - This is a great example of the wet hop style. The aroma is fresh and bursting with hops. It has phenomenal balance and I would never call it too bitter or sweet. The perfect tide-over beer until Celebration pops up in a week or two. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
"Over all a well done beer with a unique emphasis on the freshness of the hop, and kudos to how quickly it has to be made. Definitely prefer this one over the southern hemisphere harvest, will get again soon when and if my city gets any. Solid ipa, good idea- great execution. Sierra Nevada ftw"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This one has a huge herbal, earthy characteristic to it which inspires me to try a Torpedo-Ruthless mix come spring time and do a side-by-side. Another very good option from SN."
"This is a wonderful brew, if only for the breadth of flavors it presents. If they jacked this up to 10%, we'd have a world-class American Stong Ale on our hands."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great wet hop ale. Nicely complex hop profiles with a solid malt backing."
"This is the flavor of fresh. It tastes damp, wet, and immature. And it works. It's very hoppy without being abrasive at all."
"Overall great for what it is trying to be. Really nails the harvest IPA style. Freshness on this is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it, but the aroma could be more hop centric. It was more malty than a typical SN IPA. Perhaps my expectations of an IPA preceded this too much, but shouldn't you showcase the hops in a wet hop ale?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Under four bucks for a bomber of this? Yes, please!"
""
""
""
""
"O- So fresh, complex hop profile, and big malt backbone. Sierra Nevada does it again."
""
""

""
""

"Fine, fine beer. If you have the hops jones but aren't a full-on hophead, this will scratch that itch just right."
""
""
""
"This beer presents with very fresh, green, oily hopping over a nice blend of caramel and honey malts. The hopping 'pops' with grapefruit, orange peel, apricot, spicing and floral hop spectrum that work together in tandem. It gains a faint grassy and earthy tone as the glass warms up. A very tasty brew indeed, due to a wide variety of fresh hopping flavor and aroma."

"Mouthfeel is pleasant and actually very refreshing at the front, the sweet stickiness comes through towards the end. I wouldn't mind it having even less carbonation just so I could get that initial taste more. Overall I would definitly get this again. I'm excited to try this bottled as well."
"The lingering impression is how well balanced this IPA is, truly refined, and showing off some skill. Dry for an IPA, definitely a slow sipper."

"Pours a copper golden color with an eggshell colored foamy head. Head retention is longer than average with sticky foam lacing the glass. The bouquet is magnificent with generous aromas of mown grass, pine, white grape, and grapefruit. The mouthfeel and hop presence don't compliment each other. In fact, they cause each other to be more harsh than either would be alone. The hops sting a little on the back of the tongue and remain bitter in the palate after the beer has finished. Rather than one flavor yielding to the other, both pine and grapefruit are present at once and tend to overwhelm the sense of taste. That and the astringent mouthfeel make this a less drinkable beer."
""
""
"A truly a sensational, flavorful beer, and proof that SN really knows what they're doing when they overload their hops. This is bound to become one of my favorite releases from any notable craft brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper, sticky well formed cap of foam on top. Exploding with bright hops - leafy, citric, grassy, dankness. Sticky hop oils coat the palate. Malt is beefy but doesn't interfere. Still the best wet-hopped beer on the market, and cheers to Sierra Nevada for pricing these bombers ounce-for-ounce the same as their 12oz offerings. American craft beer at its finest."

"A very well balanced DIPA that is surprisingly understated allowing lots of hops but not in a way that challenges you to do anything but sip. Super hopheads may find this weak but this is perfect for me. An absolutely beautiful looking DIPA that I would have more than one of."
""
""
""
""
"All that said, this is a very well put together brew."
""
"(Overall) This was an alright IPA but with so many alternatives on the market there's plenty of other options, even if you're going for a milder-tasting IPA. While its got it's character and enjoyment here and there, there's nothing standing out about this beer. 3"
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great beer. It's not really big on the aroma or bitter, but there is a nice balance and some really good earthy-piny flavours. They say the whole cone hops come wet from the bine and go straight into the boil, which might account for the nice depth of flavour without the overpowering (but also awesome) hoppy-ness of something dry-hopped like crazy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent hop-forward brew, light in the mouth but strong in its flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this in the pass and have always been impressed. This would be an amazing year-round brew, but alas, it is not. I look forward to having this again next year."
"Pours a beautiful, hazy, amber color with a perfect off white head that is slow to fade away but as it does leaves a nice film of lacing on the glass. With the initial smell I get a fruity, soapy smell with a finish of sweetness. With the first taste I notice the crispness and the freshness of this beer. There is not as much flavor as I would like but as it sits on your tongue the flavors start to erupt. Very similarly to FFF Broo Doo and Harvest Ale from Founders it has a heavy fruit flavor that is nice, but unlike the other two this one's is hard to find. I would put this as my 3rd favorite Wet Hopped Ale behind the two I have already mentioned. If I had not had those others before this, this beer would be exceptional but since I have something to compare it to it does not hold up. Still a great beer and for $5.49 here it is a great steal."

" I tend to tread lightly with IPA's but am always on the look out for a well balanced entry that isn't too high in the IBU's and not a complete choker destined for the drain. I thought this was very well done and not nearly as strong as I was expecting but a definite sipper from the hops within. Solid as always from Sierra Nevada."

"2011 edition poured from a 24 oz bottle into a liter mug. Pours a dark amber color with a nice frothy white head that stays and leaves nice lacing. Smells of hops and floral and citrus tones. Very pleasant smell and has a few complexities. The taste is a lot of hops and a little malty taste, but the hops are very nice and dominant. For a very hoppy beer, this is very good in carbonation and in smoothness, and definitely is one, while not one to be chugged in any definition, is definitely one I could drink all night. Overall, a very good beer. Just too bad it only comes out for a few months each year."

"Heavy earthy pine flavor up front. Next is a lively citrus flavor dominated by bitter grapefruit. A slight caramel sweetness and some bread notes round it out to a full lively flavor. This beer dances in your mouth in a slow harmonious waltz - very nice. I like the punk mosh feel of some American IPAs, but this one is very pleasing as well in its own unique way."
""
"O: Once again, Sierra Nevada knocks one out of the park. More and more SN is becoming my go to beer. Any dive in Santa Barbara carries the pale, I can find the Torpedo for cheap at the grocery store. Seriously, it's hard to go wrong with a brand this widely available and this good. And the pricing is fair, for the most part. Sam Adams and Yuengling may have larger numbers, but as far as I'm concerned, this is THE great American brewery operating right now."

"overall - definitely a great IPA."
"O-a good beer. I digged this one. The Flavors keep it interesting and smooth. Really hoppy and nice. It is a little dry and finishes quick. But still ok. "
"Medium body, well carbed, very dry and lingering on the tongue. Really tasty wet hop beer, I forgot how good this was."
""
"O - Great IPA chock full of Cone hops, I'd get this anytime."
""
""
""
""
"O-Delicious IPA which is expected from Sierra Nevada. They make some of the most drinkable hoppy beers around. Fantastic for the price and would most certainly beer again"
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful beer. A little bitter on the tongue, gorgeous aromas of pine, honey, some citrus and some floral notes. An absolutely fluffy white head and a smooth resounding finish. Great beer, even better when really cold, when all the wet hops seem to explode against the roof of the mouth."

"A lovely, big IPA, better than their Celebration Ale. This said, for me this still falls short of the best Australian IPAs, which judging by other reviews can only be a matter of freshness. This beer was only out of the fridge for less than one hour between the bottle shop and my house, yet the hop character still seemed somewhat faded. The moral of the story - if you like hoppy beers, buy local."
""
"O - A great beer that is only let down by its aromas. The flavour profile is well thought out."
""
"O – What a beer! Enough hops for hop heads, and enough malt and alcohol for lovers of “stronger” beers. Flavors, while not incredibly complex, are RICH. I might have a hard time enjoying boring one-note hop bombs with dry finishes after drinking this flavor and mouth feel giant. This is without a doubt my favorite IPA I have sampled. Will be a staple."
""
"Taste: Wow, this is a fantastic IPA. First was the sugary grapefruit from the nose. Then came the citrusy vanilla note that lead into a very smooth aftertaste of bitter hops mixed with s residual malt sweetness. Mouth feel was very creamy and sticky."
"This beer smooths itself nicely. Not a palate scorcher like I initially thought, but a pretty drinkable brew. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really nice balance, interesting malt profile, huge hop aroma...good beer."
""
"Lots of fresh hop flavors without an aggressive bitterness. This was one of the best retaining heads I've seen on an AIPA. Toasted malt give good balance. It's a refreshing IPA."
""
""
"It feels more like and American Strong Ale than an IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very spicy and refreshing beer. One to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is airy with bubbles but not a lot of fizz. Swish it around and you will get a cloud of foam in your mouth but not a bunch of tingling."
"Great moderately high carbonation."

"O- an excellent wet hop ale. I'm glad that I have another bottle left."
"O - Great fresh hop beer. This one may have been a few weeks from being spectacular as the hops have faded a bit on this one. Another great IPA from SN."
""
""
"There is no doubt about it: Sierra Nevada knows their way around hops. This is a fantastic IPA, very complex in its use of hops. There are so many one-note IPA's out there and this is not one of those. Highly recommended for any hopheads, as is their Southern Hemisphere when that comes around again."
""
"Pours a deep orange/red. Big fluffy two finger head with tons of lacing and legs. Sticky hops fill the nose, grapefruits, a tad grassy. Big juicy hops on the tongue, wow, citrus hops, bittering lemon zest, juicy juicy hops, this tastes great. Medium bodied, and light in the mouth, easy drinking, smooth, hoppy as hell and bitter on the finish. Overall this beer is a home run, hops are out of control on this sucker, SN did a great job on this one, much better than the southern hem. IMO. The price on this was great too, real cheap, excellent choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a truly impressive IPA."
""
""
"M/O: No doubt this beer is about those fresh, wet hops almost to the point of astringency. I do prefer a bit of sweetness to my IPAs though. Still, a worthy purchase if in need of a hop fix."

"Love the big 24 oz. bottle. The color is a beautiful dark reddish amber and the head is one of the most persistent I have ever encountered. It continues to expand when most other ales have already receded. The head hangs in there for the whole glassful. If you like lacing inside your glass you will be impressed. You will pick the hop aroma out immediately, to be expected from a wet hopped ale I would think, and it is more piny than citrus. Nice solid mouth feel with a pleasant hop bite only rounded out a little by the malt. Nice ale Sierra Nevada."
"O- A really good beer, especially for the price. SN...you can do no wrong in my book."

"D - The 2011 batch was exceptional. I've been enjoying it off-and-on ever since.  So far, it's the best Sierra Nevada Harvest Ale I've had. I stocked up on this for home. It suited my 2011 taste buds really well and still pleases with the 2012-2014 batches.  The 2014 batch has a lot of fresh hop flavor and may be the bitterest of the past 4 years, and there's less caramel in 2014.  The ABV is reasonable. Good stuff no matter the year."
"O - I enjoyed all 24ounces of this good IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Wow. The head of a stout, big and fluffy with the most complex taste and body to match. This is a new favorite on my IPA circuit."
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Wow. This beer is just in another category. Such a great concept, but the actual beer lives up to it. A MASSIVE rush of hop character on the nose. A bit more pine flavor and less citrus flavor than i would have expected, but excellent. When you drink this beer, you can almost imagine fresh hops going down your throat. It coats your palate with hop flavor. The malt character is perfect. Just enough to back up the hops, but not too much to hide them. This beer is damn near perfect."
"Love this one. All hail fresh hop IPAs!"

"One of my favorite all-time IPAs. Worth finding. And growler'ing."

""
"DOA"
""
""
"Full flavoured and commands attention. Only let down by the slightly harsh mouthfeel which significantly lowers the drinkability."
"Long and lingering bitterness in the aftertaste obliterates the finer points of the hops to a certain extent. Medium body, medium to low carbonation, good creaminess. Definite west coast hop bomb here. Delicious and unapologetic. Gotta be down with the bitterness to enjoy this one. Balance fully tilted in the hops' favor."
""
""
"O: Such a great beer, except for the most important part - the body. I am not sure if it had dropped off a bit, but man oh man, wet hopped ales (I have now had two or three now) sure disappoint in the body of the beer when it comes to flavour..."
""
""
"Overall however a fine beer, pleasant to taste colder than warmer, and hopoy flavorful for hop worthy moments."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a nice amber hue with a huge 2.5 finger head from a light pour. the smell is piney and spicey and earty with a hint of malts. the flavor follows suit with a piney spicey hop bite and a nice malt backbone to balance it. the mouthfeel is light to medium and well carbonated. overall a very good wet hop ipa"

"O: This beer has no complex agenda. It just delivers a big blast of juicy fresh hops."
""
""
"Well played, Sierra Nevada. Well played...a light brown opaque body, exceptional head, solid lacing with residue remaining on the side well after the pour, delicious juicy hop flavor, slightly citrusy and very bitter that just cleans the palate and leaves you wanting more. Great with quesadillas and rice & beans."
""
""
""
"A choice offering from a little brewery in chico, ca....nicely done sierra. Pale copper color on the pour with plenty of lacing left in my glass. I get tons of pink grapefruit in the nose with a bit of floral/piney qualities as it goes down. Smooth mouthfeel leads to a crisp, dry finish with more grapefruit aromas and pleasing bitterness. This is the kind of beer I could sip on all day."
""
""
"A light coating of the palate as it warms."
"A nice fresh hop ipa although the hops are not any near as complex as they are in many other IPA's with either fresh or dry hops."

"Poured into a pint glass. Very dark, almost amber but with some orange tinge as well. Head is fairly large, leaving lacing behind. Smell is of pine trees – a pine forest in fact. Taste is naturally piny but there is much more to it as well. Some sweetness, perhaps apple, in the middle that bridges the two waves of bitterness. The ending is much more citrusy. Mouthfeel is chewy but not overly so. Very complex, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Man, was I sad to see this beer end. It's silky smooth and goes down very easy. I thought the bitterness and delicious hop flavors were nearly perfect. The hints of caramel-like sweetness as the beer warmed was a nice surprise too. As long as I can find this beer, I will definitely keep coming back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another nice brew found at ""Plan B"" in Milford. Clear copper coloring with a decent off-white head and a mess of lacing! The aroma is piney-citrus hop and yeasty malt. Taste is also pine and citrus hops over mildly butterscotch malt. Apple pumpkin and sweet vanilla. Solidly medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and a fairly luscious feel. Very beautifully balance with IPA qualities that are highly drinkable. Another bravo to SN!"

"A very tasty and drinkable beer that I was quite happy to have a couple of, regardless of price."
"Semi opaque burnt orange pour in a tulip. Thick, lump head dissipated pretty quickly. Looks like a classic SN...beautiful for about 30 seconds, then well, messy. Spicy and very bright and floral in the nose (high grade marijuana buds) with malts present in the background. Dried fruits and spices...Big fruity hops are abundant. Earthy and grainy, the barley malts add a depth that surround the huge amount of hops beautifully. Pine nuts and a tangy finish. Dense, oily feel foamy on the tongue. This beer is really good. It really has the depth and hops of a double IPA. This is a well named brew. Tastes and feels like a harvest. Pairs nicely with turkey and cranberry salad. This is my second bottle this autumn and hope to have more. Great!"
"O: Another home run for Sierra Nevada. While it's nothing overly exciting or out of step with their ""norm", I can't say it's bad. In fact, it's really good. The bitterness is so well pronounced while maintaining this fantastic balance with the sweet caramel malts. The creamy mouthfeel is quickly becoming one of my favorite aspects of any Sierra Nevada beer and this is no exception. Their blueprint has become virtually flawless in my opinion. The only thing I will say is that I don't think it falls in line with the ""harvest ale"" style...but I wish other breweries could still hit a home run when missing their mark the way that SN can."
"The brew is smooth, easy to drink, with moderate carbonation and body."
"O - I haven't always had the best opinion of Sierra Nevada, but they continue to prove to me that they brew some of the best beers out there. Glad I was able to have this one a couple times this season. Highly recommended for IPA and fresh hop fans."
"Overall: Carries the signature Sierra Nevada excellence. Nicely complex with tons of depth, but never feel overbearing. Truly great."
"(Reviewed 10/19)"
"O-I can't get enough of Fresh Hop IPAs. This is no exception. The abv isn't that high so I don't feel bad for having the entire 24oz bottle and the price can not be beat."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. Overall it was well above average and for the $5 price it was hard to beat. I'll be picking up another as long as they are out"
"Overall a solid offering at a reasonable price, but the hops are a bit outweighed by the malt profile here which I do not like. Not how I would do a wet hop beer."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, I'm anxious to compare the estate organic ipa to this one. Definitely try this if you have the opportunity."
"O: Wow, I have to admit I am a hophead, and this is so bitter I am intimidated by 24 ounces of this beer! This is NOT a balanced beer! This is hops, hops, hops, and bitter as hell. An impressive ale, but so extremely bitter I am having a hard time really laying into this. Needs cheese pairing to balance out astringent lingering."
"Overall: An interesting and enjoyable beer. Worth picking up if you see a bottle around."
"O - I have always enjoyed this beer but when it goes down hill it goes down quick. Luckily this one was still teetering off the cliff so it was still pretty good. It is still a little too sweet for me but, when fresh, it is a very good beer."
"O- A great special occasion seasonal beer that I may get again before they are all gone. I will definitely be back next year, nicely done again Sierra Nevada."
"O: great wet hop ale, wonderful hop notes perfectly paired with the malts."
"Overall - Awesome, more bitter hoppy then southern hemisphere. Not quite as smooth either but very very tasty and hoppy. More malty then i expected, nice brew, will enjoy fresh every year."
"O: This is one fantastic beer. I love it!"
"O: 3.5"
"Final thought - The price is better than most seasonal releases and I think well worth it> not a beer to save, but to savor!"
"O - I love this series and have never been let down, even by older bottles. A perennial favorite."
"Overall I would recommend picking up a bottle. You should hurry because these beers go bad quickly and this beer is probably selling well."
"A huge billowy off-white head sits atop a clear amber liquid. The head lasts to the last sip and leaves several rings of lacing down the glass. Wonderful citrus fruit cocktail scents (pear and green apple) are intoxicating; I can't stop sniffing. Taste buds are assaulted by a huge explosion of hops. Hop oils of grapefruit and pine grab hold at the start and never let go. Bitterness is high, and at bit harsh at first, but toned down a bit as my tongue adjusted. Smooth with perfect carbonation. Hop lovers must get a hold of this one."
"D: This beer is only available in a larger bottle size (22oz? it doesn't say), and for me, one of these is plenty. It is a nice treat to have this beer and enjoy it."
"D - A solid straight forward wet hopped American IPA... Text book Sierra Nevada here... On the drier pinier side and definitely a worthy hop experience..."
"O- A solid IPA that I enjoy a bottle of a year on release."
"Overall-- this is a nice and enjoyable beer."
"Bottom Line: Get it fresh, I would not buy this past February 2012 (unless it's a new batch) A top notch IPA."
"Overall: I like this IPA from S.N. and they never seize to impress me with there annual releases. I would like to see this in 12 oz bottle, but that's just being nit picky."
"O. Nice wet hop beer here. Big piney hop taste that satisfies. Love fresh hops beers."
"Great IPA!"
"Serving type: bottle into perfect pint glass 4.99 1pt8oz"
"I love allthe hope flavors and aromas, but I feel gagged by the bitterness."
"Another solid brew by SN. Pours a clear golden amber with a thick satiating head. Gobs of lacing all over the glass as it is drank. Solid hop aroma, earthy, floral, more citrusy and fruit based than its southern hemipshere counterpart. Mango and citrus centered hop character, tangier and fruitier than its southern hemisphere counterpart. Bigger malt body as well, solid caramel flavor. Dry, crisp, descent amount of resin, solid medium bodied ipa that finishes clean."
"C+"
"It sits like a good AIPA should. The bitterness destroys your palate, yet isnt a bad thing. it toes the line between too bitter and just right."
"Pours copper colored like a fall leaf. There is almost a finger of head that leaves a nice trail of lacing behind. Fresh hop spice is the name of this game. The smell, upfront flavor and finish are all a testament to the holy hop. Too bad this can only be a seasonal."
"O: Overall, a pretty solid IPA. It has good flavors and aromas, but it just lacks a punch. Even with vigorous swirling, I have stick my nose into my glass to pick up on the aromas. I really just wish the flavors and aromas would pop a bit more."
"O: Liked it, but didn't love it. While it was fresh, it still came off a little too resiny/dank for me."
"I am really enjoying this beer. I bought this to share with my wife and it wasn't a huge hit with her. She didn't dislike it, but I think the hop profile is more forward than she's used to as a die hard Dales Pale Ale drinker. The peppery notes were a bit much for her, but I didn't pick that up at all. I will be looking for Southern Hemisphere this spring."
"Overall- A really swell wet hop IPA, my first in fact, and I really dig it. My main gripe is the mouth feel; it's just a little light for I like this style. And as good as the hops are, it could have been a little more explosive on the palate, but by all indications, this is a must have."
"O - An excellent wet hop beer. smells great, taste great. Woo hoo."
"O: a nice brew, great nose, would have liked a bit more citrus in the taste but overall an extremely drinkable brew and once again another one ive loved from sierra nevada"
"O= Overall, I think this was a great harvest ale at a great price. I would pick this up if I saw it in my bottle shop great beer by a solid brewery."
"O: Another solid brew from SN. I haven't had a pale ale from them yet, keep it up please!"
"This isn't as bitter as you'd think, but still gives you a nice IBU load...enough to cut through a spicy chili-cheese dog. Still, I preferred the Southern Hemisphere Harvest more. Maybe because I get Pacific Northwest hops in just about anything these days. the hops in SHH are different, which to me means refreshing."
"O - A tasty late season ipa, 'Harvest Ale', fresh flavor as expected from Sierra Nevada....not bad at all."
"O - As I continued to drink this beer and it began to warm, I noticed that it's pretty darn bitter, and the bitterness lingers big time. Over all I loved this brew, it's got a nice balancing thing going on in the flavor, and don't even get me started about how fresh and dank those hops are! I definitely recommend this one to an IPA lover. Pick it up as fresh as you can get it! Cheers!"
"Great, dial down the bitterness a notch and this IPA would be one to remember."
"Drinkability: I must say after trying alot of wet hop beers this one takes the cake as my favorite. I love how this beer is a full on hop explosion - really showing off those citrus properties perfectly, a nice balance of malt tends to slow things down and make this beer more interesting as well. And the mouthfeel on this beer is fantastic - bitter, not too dry or cloying - almost perfect. By far a homerun in any hop heads book. If you see it - TRY IT!"
"Overall, a nice IPA. It's not Celebration but it's still a good IPA with loads of fresh hops flavors."
"Overall : I love this beer in my opinion its Serria Nevada's best beer overall. The price is unbeatable I bought my bombed for $3.99 . So much flavor and biting bitterness this harvest ale has no equal ."
"Overall: Sierra Nevada does it again with this wet hop ale. Wonderful flavor and remarkably balanced. If pressed to choose, I think I still prefer the Estate Ale, but this one is great too."
"Not the most vivid wet hop ale I've tried, but really well-balanced with some solid flavors."
"Richly hoppy, grassy aroma has an undertone of yeast and a hint of caramel - and it just sends me. It pours a luscious clear copper with a very thick fine-bubbled cream-white head that leaves some good lacing. Hoppy flavor has fruity and yeasty tones and a hint of caramel, and is only slightly bitter. Lively, fizzy, restless texture has average body and truly dances on the tongue and on the way down, leaving a woody and hoppy texture. Harvest indeed! Drink deeply - and responsibly."
"Overall, a really tasty fresh hop experience. Personally would have liked a little more of the grapefruit over the pine but still highly recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - glad to get to try this one after missing it somehow last year. Kinda pricey and still a little on the bitter side for me so probably just a bomber a year for now would be good. [O;O]"
"Overall - An impressive IPA. The hops are certainly present here if there was so more malt here, it would almost pass for a Bigfoot. Still, well done by the folks at SN."
"Overall: the somewhat dry, nutty and biscuity nature of this beer get in the way of ultimate enjoyment for me, but I do appreciate the role those characteristics play in making this a seasonal harvest-time ale. Not my favorite beer, but quite good despite that."
"D: tasty brew from SN. gotta love the wet hop brews especially from these guys that know there IPA's. highly quaffable and not overpowering."
"This brew really took me by surprise on how good it was. A huge oversight on my drinking part. Will definitely be picking up some more."
"Deep copper orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a frothy, off-white foam with superb staying power to the finish. The foam leaves sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Intense, fresh-hop aroma: tangy citrus orange and lemon, earthy floral and pine hop aromas with a touch of grapefruit. Medium-bodied, lighly resinous, with lively carbonation. Flavor is a balance of tangy citrus orange and pine hops from beginning to end. There is a bit of sweet maltiness beneath, but only enough to be noticed. Earthy floral hop flavors show up at the finish and transition into a lingering pine hop aftertaste."
"Pours a medium amber with stone colored foam, very dense, good retention and leaving a swath of lacing. Smell is a nice mellow hoppiness (citrus and floral), some tropical fruit. Taste is grassy and floral, again pretty mellow, which is followed by a dose of pine, juicy orange, and grapefruit peel, with a pleasant bitterness throughout. Very light carbonation and medium body. Overall, very drinkable and nice balance, a good choice to have on cask."
"Overall, an incredibly good wet hop IPA. Factor in the great price ($4.99 in CT) and it is tough to beat for the style."
"O: Solid brew. Great balance between the malt and hops, while providing a unique taste"
"What is there to say about this beer? The label talks a big game about fresh ingredients, and makes like rushing these not-yet-dried hops to from Yakima, WA to Chico, CA to make this beer is a big deal. Then it delivers deep, powerful hop aroma and flavor exactly as advertised. If you like that sort of thing, you should be buying this beer."
"This is a fantastic IPA with a big bitter kick and a spice, pine, stone fruit flavor. It is dry and all too easy to drink. Well done."
"O- I like it, but may have to snack on something between sips to balance the hop flavor and let me fully appreciate the beer. Luckily, there's plenty left in the bottle!"
"O: Good beer, but not my favorite harvest ale."
"22 oz 2011 vintage from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $5.85 Wow pretty dark amber for a regular IPA but attractive with a gorgeous thick frothy eggshell white head. Good fresh hop aromas..slightly resiny,herbal wih a hint of pine Strange the taste while well hopped has a monsterous creamy caramel maltiness. Hops take over more at the back..this balance is very nice for me..this seems to be in the same direction that many newer PNW IPAs are going..stronger but more balanced. I like. Great smooth mouthfeel..creamy. Overall an excellent beer may not make ultra-hop heads happy though"
"Overall: This is a damn tasty and well done beer, and a pretty good deal for a limited release. Kind of like a Hoptimum light."
"Pours a deep golden color with a huge off-white head and great retention on the pint glass. Smell is so fresh. Lots of floral and pine up front with sweet fruits and fresh hops. Smell is powerful and appealing. Taste is also very fresh. Nice complexity with sweet fruits, malted grains, and bitter hops. I could drink so much of this. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation. Overall I loved this. Nice alternative to other fall seasonal beers."
"Eh, this was okay for me. I can appreciate the concept of the hop harvesting and such but I think I've become more akin to a citrus IPA profile, as opposed to this brash pine and sap bitterness. It's good but it's tiresome after a while. I didn't even end up finishing the bottle."
"6.7%, 60-65 IBU."
"Overall just a great example of fresh hop beer, with lots of well balanced taste everywhere as well. I definitely like this one more than the Southern too. Great beer."
"Overall a really good fresh-hop IPA, enjoyed this one from Sierra Nevada."
"O-Beers like this are exactly why I love this time of year.Really nice Wet Hop/Harvest Ale."
"Overall this beer is delicious, I have been waiting for this beer for a while and was happy I grabbed one. very good and solid beer."
"An excellent seasonal, well suited to Indian Summer."
"Loved this beer and just as good as I always remember it. The Southern Hemisphere was a huge unbalanced mess, but this is a great beer."
"Overall, can't beat it. This and the SoHem makes me wish Spring and Fall were the only two seasons. Well actually, extreme heat and cold makes me wish for that too."
"O - An Excellent beer, I would recommend it to anyone who already likes IPAs. Stronger hop flavor than the southern hemisphere brew but still has a great balanced flavor."
"i swear this one gets better every year. pours a dark whiskey colored amber into a frozen pint glass with a spectacular head. looks like a handful of shaving cream, or, like flying over the north pole in a helicopter. white puffy dunes that do not diminish one bit as it sits. immaculate presentation. nose is fresh hops in that mild, subtle, high quality sense, like a wise man being patient with a group of children. the taste is excellent, balanced malts and the elemental hops that were grown with love for exactly this realization. man i can't say enough about this one. enjoyed on a 50 degree fall night with maple mustard chicken on the slow charcoal fire and a setting rocky mountain sun. the smells and vibes of the food and the beer almost become one in a weird ritualistic synergy that is the absolute essence of fall relaxation. magic!"
"MF: A great fresh hop assault; similar in hop profile to Sierra Nevada's other hoppy offerings, but with a definitive wet hop edge. Good stuff."
"O - The flavor just doesn't do it for me here."
"O - id like to thank my local craft guru, Bob W, for pointing this one out to me, and to Sierra Nevada for shipping this seasonal to my area. This was a very good beer. It's more of a well balanced hybrid of sorts, but has enough hop character as the highlight to be considered an IPA. This brew really surprised me in the sense that I'll buy another one of these this autumn season. I rarely ever drink IPAs in the fall. A real winner here. Everything anyone could ask for in a good IPA. Wouldn't expect anything different from SN."
"O: Very enjoyable! This beer has in no way diminished with a little age. The aromatics and the resinous mouthfeel imparted by the wet hops have clearly faded, but only to give way to other characteristics which are equally enjoyable. Would be worthwhile tasting this against a fresh 2011 vintage."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking copper color, the head was thick, foamy and white. The lacing was sticky on this brew. The smell of the beer has a big hop aroma to it along with some sweet malts in the background. The taste of the beer was pretty good, it's got the really nice bitter sweet bite that Sierra Nevada loves to do. The mouthfeel of the beer is lighter than a medium bodied brew, it's drinkable. Overall I enjoyed it, I thought this was a pretty good brew all around."
"Thanks Sierra Nevada, and thank you Payless Liquors in Geist for keeping this one in the cellar for me."
"A beautiful pour, orange ruby amber color with nice, persisting frothy creamy head. Nice dank, pungent, resiny, hoppy aroma, not so much spruce really but more resin and pine. Hoppy yet mellow. Taste is a hoppy bitterness with surprisingly mellow finish. Slight yeasty quality to it, slightly syrupy. Overall an excellent brew from sierra nevada, gotta love ’em."
"O-as iconic forthe wet hop pale ale stle as snpa is for the regular pale ale style. Inoffensive and tasty. Spicy and dank with great hop flavor and a great and unexpected biscuit malt taste."
"Overall: the aroma and taste with this one is very complex. Some of these conflict but others mesh. Very interesting beer."
"O- I'm not a huge pale ale fan, but this was very well done. Would certainly look for it again and would certainly recommend it to others. Nice job SN!"
"The many faces of hops, with just enough caramel behind it. We know what this does, but don't we just love it. What an American IPA is."
"Drinkability: It's so drinkable that my hubby and I both enjoy it... crazy."
"I liked it better this year out of the bottle (I’ve had 2 so far this year), and look forward to next year’s batch; a very high recommendation as this was delicious and very easy to drink. Another Sierra Nevada session beer for me. 2012 batch raised the overall rating from 4 to 5. Yeah, it was that good."
"O-This beer reminds me of a nice cold glass of nice fresh and natural hops. definitely a Sierra Nevada, but doesn't completely follow their MO."
"Overall, of very good wet hop IPA."
"Very well balanced and enjoyable. Wish I would of picked up more when i got this one 1.5 years ago."
"Overall - interesting brew. Although not a taste/flavor that I love, I do appreciate the subtitles here."
"A fantastic savouring beer, a beautifully balanced, full flavoured beer but with that characteristic American hop profile. Wonderful."
"O - A mixed bag. Solid craftmanship, but it has a major off-putting character."
"D- Very enjoyable beer. Nice balanced IPA."
"D-Overall this is a great beer. Really loved the floral and cirtus notes. And just alittle bite at the end, gave this beer just something alittle different which i liked. Would like to get this again!"
"Fresh lemongrass and mint aromas with some light malts lingering in the background. Fairly intense bitterness and a dryish finish lend to a somewhat puckering feel. Intense lemongrass and mint hoppiness with some herbal notes as well. The malt stays out of the way and shows off the interesting hop profile. Good stuff."
"D: Pretty drinkable and not one of those over the top IPA's that are too bitter for my tastes."
"D-a classic IPA that i could drink all night long."
"O- Incredible beer for an ipa lover. I couldn't get over how incredible the smell, taste and how sturdy the head was."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A little watery and quite light bodied. Prominent in sweet fruits and hops. The sweet hops add a good bitterness to the beer."
"This is a fun, and well rounded AIPA that I wish would be available all year round."
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Overall I had higher expectations. I am little underwhelmed. It's not really bad. Just not for me."
"Why don't more hop shop breweries try this kind of restraint in their IPA? Or come up with new category for extreme hop-crazed beers? Like Beyond IPA. This is so pleasant yet hop powered, I think it ought to set a standard."
"Overall Grade: B+/A-"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a crystal amber-copper color with a thick, small-bubbled, foamy head. There are smells of hops and slight spicing all over the nose, and some sweet malt aromas under it all. Citrus and grapefruit abound, with plenty of resinous, dank, pitch notes. The beer has a sweet caramel malt backbone that does a very good job of platforming for the low, steady assault of peppered hops flavors throughout the brew, as well as the tangy tropical fruit and citrus notes, especially grapefruit. The beer is light and creamy in mouth, which has a great feel for the flavors riding it. The beer also has a fantastic lacing as you make your way through the brew, with decent head retention, too. A peppery and hoppy aftertaste that lingers through the finish, with a shift to just hop bitterness all over the tongue and roof of your mouth. Delicious for hop heads like me. Heavy flavors are balanced by the light body, and the ABV makes this one an easy drinker."
"Between this and the estate ale; this is a tough choice. Excellent, and different faces of a brewery at its best. All I can do is recommend you get yourself some."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability- It was very good. It had very nice balance."
"A very nice beer overall. The rating may have been higher if I hadn't had fresh Sculpin just prior to drinking this, but hey, I've got high standards (for beer at least)."
"Bottle via trade with HogtownHarry. This isn't as fresh as it should be I guess, but here goes. Beautiful deep copper pour with white head just sitting on top. Aroma is quite hoppy, peppery, earthy, leafy, everything IPA should smell like but this is dimmed down a bit. Taste is still quite bitter, just enough malt sweetness to make it enjoyable. Palate is average but good."
"Decent beer - less of a hop bomb than I thought it might be (keeping with Sierra's style in this regard), and a good solid drink!"
"My thoughts on the Harvest Ale are mixed. First and foremost, it is one of the most drinkable pale ales I've had. The flavors aren't overpowering and it's easy going down. On the other hand, the beer is not adventurous. I was expecting it to have a more robust hop flavor and a heavier body to it. So, if you're wanting an overly complex beer that tests your taste buds, the Harvest Ale won't meet your expectations. However, if you want an easy-to-drink pale ale that has plenty of quality genuine flavors of the beer type, then this is exactly what you want."
"T: Lots of grapefruit-like hop flavors that fade towards the middle and give way to some of the malts. The finish is pure hop resins. The hops were pretty dominant in this one and I could have used a bit more balance. A huge IPA that will satisfy the biggest hopheads."
"This is one amazing beer; congrats to SN"
"All in all, a solid IPA. Glad it is different from Celebration, though I like Celebration a little more."
"Into a tulip glass on 2.14.11 this pours a deep amber color bordering on red under a bubbly foam head and has a complex aroma of fresh hops and sugared malt. Upfront and center, a solid and spicy pungency of pine hops hits my palate and empties out into a finish that leaves a dry and resinous hop garden's calling card. This is all about the hops...with a great supporting malt to create a balanced mouthfeel and a very drinkable A-IPA."
"D - Smooth, easy drinking, enjoyed this and thought I would definitely session it with the 6.7% ABV and a nice price of $4.99 for the bottle which I thought was 26oz bought at a BevMo.."
" Drinkability: I'm drinking it and enjoying it. Good."
"Will be interesting to try each year's iteration to see how much it changes."
"drinkable statisfies a hops craving even though i would have liked a more hop character"
"24oz bottle. Pours an uber murky amber color with a big frothy head. Good amount of sticky lacing. Aromas of hops all around here. Pine, citrus, and floral smells. Taste is hoppy and sweet. More of the pine stands out here with some citrus and floral notes in the background. Floral aftertaste. This beer has a nice mouthfeel and is tasty as hell. Big shock, another great Sierra Nevada beer."
"D - Very drinkable IPA. Super smooth and crisp with a nice hops profile all the way through. The background sweetness also blends nicely with the other elements. Very crisp and refreshing."
"2010 vintage, poured from a bottle into a tulip, slightly cloudy and reddish with a big head and lots of lacing. The smell is hoppy and light, with a similar taste. The hop bitterness is subtle up front and finishes with a clean minimal aftertaste. This beer is nicely carbonated like I would expect from the type and I could drink a bunch of this stuff. This beer is a lighter IPA than what I am used to, but I highly recommend it and look forward to trying it again next year."
"Bomber poured into dimpled mug. Sweet resiny grassy citrus notes, massive aroma, but not intense in a traditional IPA sense. Deep copper amber color, frothy head with good lacing. Good soft caramel malts, grassy bitterness, fresh hop aroma. Mild carbonation, rich body, fresh grassy hop finish. Great beer, fresh hops are really highlighted well."
"Notes added 10/27/12. Got a fresh one so I thought I'd add some notes. The smell is much better from a newish bottle. Tons of pine, citrus and lawn clippings, all balanced with caramel and pale malt goodness. Goes down pretty smooth. Taste is fresh hop goodness, well balanced. A slight change in the score on smell and mouth."
"This is a very fresh, delicious American ale. Highly recommended."
"This has great hop flavor. It is very potent, yet smooth and refined. If you love hops, this one is for you."
"EDIT 22 October 2012: The 2012 version isn't nearly as good. The hops are slight, the malt base dry and lagery, and the overall effect weak and metallic. Disappointing."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine hops, and very slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, and pine hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. The flavors in this one made it very easy to drink. However, there was a lot of pine notes going on in this one. It had a good flavor and aroma that seemed to blend together very well. A definite must try if you have not already."
"The beer is highly carbonated, perhaps just a little bit too much so for how relaxed the flavors are. The drinkability, however, is very high. This hits the perfect level of bitterness with regards to drinkability, I can just keep going back. A nice, laid back IPA that's very enjoyable."
"The feel is very smooth and slick. The carbonation is sharp but ends without much intrusion. The body is full and viscous, ending chalky and dry. It's refreshing and well-balanced, making it a joy to drink. A bit more intensity in the overall flavor would have made it excellent."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a Stella glass. Plenty of carbonation and great lacing. This beer has A dark copper color; true to the American ipa style. The hops really back a punch, and the hop oils really linger on the palate. At 6.7% percent alcohol, it is more of a sipping brew than a session beer."
"D: This is a breeze to drink, especially at 6.7%. Gimme a couple bombers and I'll be as satisfied as a bear with honey"
"This beer is a beauty, and at $5 for a biggun, it's one to seek out and keep around."
"I love the Sierra Nevada Harvest beers. They are very flavorful but still not hard to put down, and are relatively affordable. Sierra Nevada is such a solid company."
"Drinkability - Another tremendous brew from Sierra Nevada. I would really like to try this at its peak freshness. I'll be sure to be on the lookout for it next year. It's still really, really good. A lot of flavor an da great mouthfeel. Easily drinkable and one that I will look forward to each year. I liked the Estate Homegrown Ale a bit better, but this is still a brew that I could enjoy drinking anytime."
"D - All of Sierra Nevada's beers are exceptionally drinkable, and this is no exception."
"Poured into a rocks glass(shared amongst three) with a copper body and that trademark puffy sticky Sierra Nevada head. Smells of: you guessed it, fresh hops, of a variety I can't quite pinpoint. Nice refreshing citrus(?) bitter flavor. Nice smooth malty body with light carbonation. Very different fresh and refreshing IPA. Two Bottles amongst a few people. Awesome."
"Overall, this is a solid brew from Sierra Nevada. A hop-head's delight."
"Very drinkable. Wish I had another."
"Dr. Very very easy to drink."
"The brew pours an impressive looking amber chestnut hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy,creamy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of lacing everywhere,the smell is a little subdued with aromas of sweet honey,caramel,stonefruit and pine,the mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and medium bodied and the tastes of mandarin,honey,caramel and lemon zest make themself well known before being overpowered right at the end by a strong wet pine,sherbet bitterness that really leaves your lips puckered,and overall its a fine drop that i could drink alot of and ive gotta say even for a hophead like me i am very impressed with the bitterness of this fine brew,definately reccomend cheers."
"The mouth feel is medium with some fizzy, refreshing carbonation on my tongue. There's nothing about the beer that's tiring or cloying. Very reasonable ABV. On the surface it seems very drinkable, but I am going super slowly. I've been at it for at least 40 minutes and I'm not nearly halfway through my 24 oz. bottle. Tried to get my wife to share it with me but it was too bitter for her. I feel awkward rating its drinkability, but it is filling and satiating. It doesn't seem right to deduct points for qualities that make it so good."
"D- A solid beer. Nothing jumps out at me but overall, a good quality beer I would enjoy again in the future."
"UPDATE: 2012 edition consumed Jan. 2013 earns about the same high ratings."
"Drink ability: For any IPA lover, very easy to drink. Great kick at the end as well."
"Very drinkable- wish I had another right now. I think I like these fresh hop styles"
"I've had bolder beers, but never fresher hops than this."
"Citrus notes right away, especially grapefruit. It's not as bitter as I thought it would be, and I found myself being slighly disappointed. It seemed a little one-note. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer. It's just not overly interesting."
"Wow. This will make my favourite beers of 2010 list, if I make one."
"D- It lacks in balance, but the nice fresh hops causes me to return"
"It was tasty, buy some if you can get it."
"Great beer, very drinkable."
"This is a great beer. I have not reviewed the Southern Hemisphere Harvest but from what I remember I liked it better. The hops were very unique. I definitely recognize these hop flavors."
"D - quite good and easy to drink."
"This beer pours a glowing amber color with a dark copperish tint to it. The head was slightly off white. The aroma is unique, very piney, almost reminded me instanly of some sort of cleaner. The taste has a citrus piney hop taste, with a sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium, and overall is a very drinkable beer."
"D- My first impression was that this was a bit watery, but after a couple sips the nice oily finish coated my palette with the hop flavors and lingering bitterness that really help the flavors to come out. Not anything crazy, just a great representation of the hops that went into this. Milder than I was expecting, but I still enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: Excellent I need another bottle."
"Overall, it's a very tasty brew that I could session on for a good long time. Very happy this is a 24oz format!"
"overall i enjoyed this but it seems a bit redundant. or maybe just not so spectacular that it stands out as an overly special IPA. as i finsh the bottle it's apparent that this is indeed a blistering bitter hop bomb...solid but not spectacular."
"Wish I'd purchased more than one!"
"An exceptionally drinkable beer, would love to try this fresh on tap."
"Very good beer."
"D- A solid beer from SN. Could definitely drink a few of these."
"The is oh-so-drinkable. The 24 oz. went down easily and did not damn my palate. I think this will be a yearly treat for me, as long as I can find it right when it is released."
"Despite being a year old, this has held up well. My pour created a finger of tawny head with good retention. Its color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles. Nose had a very earthy quality underlain with a dry spiciness. Mouthfeel was medium with a grassy hop bite on the tongue. Finish was quite grassy, a bit malty, but it had held up really well. It speaks well for refrigeration."
"Highly drinkable. I would definitely pay the $3 for this 6.7%abv pint. I would pay that much in a bar for a pint of blue moon or Coors and have no more hair on my chest to show for it. Unfortunately this is a limited release brew, but next summer I will try the Wet Hop (very excited) and Southern Hemisphere (to compare to this!)."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied and pretty well balanced considering how hoppy the beer is. Nice balance of sweet caramel malt and sweet citrus hop notes. Hints of pineapple, lemon and grapefruit as well as dank dry piny bitterness that lingers throughout into a long bone dry finish."
"Overall drinkability is pretty good. The 7% does not hurt the beer at all. The stickiness of the hops is what really seals the deal for this beer. It makes it unique and is an interesting spin on the traditional IPAs."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just a bit over light bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink overall. Another solid effort by Sierra Nevada in their fresh hop series."
"Fresh, delicious and rewardingly wet hopped. Reap the Harvest!"
"Although a bit dated by December (the store owner only charged me $5 for the bottle), the wet hops still come through well and create a fresh-tasting IPA."
"Drinkability: It is a great beer but I don't think I could drink more than a bomber at a time. I am a mild fan of IPA and I find the hops to be a bit aggressive as the oz go down."
"I'd have another one but not craving one. Can usually find it anywhere this time of year and its not too expensive for how much you get. A little too much malt for me."
"D: This Special Edition pale ale shows more snap and urgency than Sierra Nevada's standard, without compromising the balance and overall character that are their hallmarks. Sensory qualities found here are very similar to, if not more intense than, those of the Sierra Nevada estate ale--and at half the price per bottle, this is the better choice to make."
"Served to me with a two finger cap of soapy head. Good lacing down the side of the glass. Deep copper in color with good clarity. Smell is of raw and fresh grapefruit and pine hops. Palate is a hop lovers delight. Lots of fruity, earthy and piney hop flavor. Also has enough malt flavor for balance. Bitterness is pretty mild. This beer reminds me of their Celebration Ale without the dry bitter bite. Certainly worth seeking out, which, for a Sierra Nevada brewed beer, goes without saying."
"This beer is clear and appears a sunburst orange / amber color. The head is approximately an inch thick, and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Aromas of hops, citrus, pine. The flavor could be bigger / bolder. There is enough of a malt presence to balance out the hop profile. The feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, a good beer and one worth trying."
"Extremely drinkable, I rarely drink/like IPA's and I quaffed this one."
"A good hop kick in the brew with nice creamy malt backbone, sweet notes just there to round it out. Very worthy hop lovers brew!"
"Other Notes - I wish I had posted this review a few weeks ago when I first tried the 2010 batch, as it naturally has lost flavor & smell from when it was fresh. It is still a great brew, pick some up now if you haven't already. This years batch is much better than past years in my opinion. I also prefer the bottle over tap with this beer."
"Overall: This is a pretty well crafted beer, not something I can drink all the time, but it is enjoyable. The color and aroma are very much enviting and the drinkablility doesn't let me down. If there was any complaint it was that the initial bitterness was more harsh than I would have liked but in the end it really mellowed out."
"Yum. Excellent brew. Copper-orange color with excellent head and lacing. Beautiful fresh hop nose and flavor. Has a nice malt balance to the hops, which I appreciate. Taste is very balanced and well---quite fresh. Reminds me of a more refined version of Celebration--less bitter. This is another excellent offering from SN."
"Nice head retention, with lacing around most of the glass. Smells of citrus hops, with some oily pine and a bit fruity too. Nice caramel malt backbone to this beer. Mild bitterness balanced out by the sweetness. A very nice fresh hop ale."
"D: Very drinkable , this beer is awesome, I enjoyed it very much!"
"This beer isn't that bad. I'd call it a fair IPA. Something's just not quite right about it."
"A great beer that celebrates simplicity and balance without any hype or overpricing. This is a wet hop ale I really like even though the wet hop character seemed muted after 2 months of bottling. Seeing as this beer was brewed with Centennial hops, I was looking for a character similar to all Centennial Bell's Two Hearted and Founders Centennial but the fruitiness was missing and this one was very clean with only the bitterness shining. Highly recommended. Did I mention it's less than $5 for a 24 oz. bottle?!"
"Drinkability is good. It's nice and bitter, but I couldn't see sitting down and having more than 2 pints of it. Also, as always, Sierra Nevada's cheap pricing always makes their ales much more appealing."
"This is a good beer, but not bold enough to really be anything special."
"This is one of my favorite SN offerings, I'd rate it a bit above their Homegrown Wet Hop Ale, which I also really liked. If you like hops without the complete bitterness overload, look no further."
"D: A wonderfully drinkable beer from SN."
"This one is my favorite of the Harvest beers SN puts out. Great beer."
"Overall, a very good brew."
"D - I think this has really good drinkability. Its refreshing and goes down easy. It is nicely balanced which makes it go down smoothly. It also has a very fresh taste to it that makes me want to go out and buy another. I'm glad I picked up this one."
"Easy drinking, smooth mouthfeel with very modest carbonation. Not really my style, the whole American IPA thing, but occasionally I feel to drink a beer like this and this one hit the spot. Well done."
"M Medium to heavy body. Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is right on. 4.5"
""
"D= Need to get to the store and buy more..."
"Drinkability: As good as could be reasonably expected from such a flavorful brew."
"Drinkability - I could definitely drink a few of these. The one caveat is that you probably need to be a hop lover to consider this a very drinkable brew, but if you enjoy hop bitterness, you will probably have no problem putting down a few of these."
"D - I have yet to find a Sierra Nevada beer that is not only drinkable, but highly drinkable. This beer is no exception. Awesome Sierra Nevada hop flavor along with a great body and aroma. Definitely a hop pleaser."
"Drinkability I could drink this every day, definitely one of my favorite beers."
"Nice crisp mouthfeel. Good hoppy aftertaste. Worth a try."
"While I believe I prefer Southern Hemisphere as a fresh wet hop ale from Sierra Nevada that won't prevent me from enjoying this, my second and I doubt the last, bottle of Northern Hemisphere."
"Solid bitterness and hop flavor combines with fruitiness and dark herbal character on the palate. My complaints about the beer are too much caramel malt flavor and residual sugars, and too high of carbonation. A bomber is nice to have for the fresh hop season, but I might be better off with a Pale Ale bomber."
"Relatively fresh bomber from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI. Pours a deep amber hue with one finger of rocky, eggshell white head and thin strands of lacing on the tulip glass. Smell is all about the wet, whole-cone hops, with tangerine, citrus, flower petals, orange rind, nectarine, red and white grapefruit, and resinous pine needles coming to the fore. Taste is identical to the nose with pithy, citric, and fruity hop flavours on the palate and a bold, mouth-coating bitterness to end. Some lightly toasty caramel and pale malts provide a biscuit-like backbone to balance and I also get a small trace of cookie dough. Medium mouthfeel has an indulgent silkiness about it, very juicy and oily middle, crisp carbonation with a flash of spice from the C hops and a lingering bitter finish. This harvest ale is just brimming with complex aromas and flavours. The hop oils and resins are evident throughout, and here again Sierra Nevada shows how to take a ridiculous amount of humulus lupulus and create an IPA that's much more rewarding and sophisticated than mere hop tea. A model India Pale Ale from Chico, California."
"In the battle of North vs. South the North wins (again). Southern Hemisphere was more pleasingly bitter I must add."
"Overall I found this to be similar to Celebration as far as the hop profile but with more earthiness. Well worth a shot."
"This is a very drinkable fresh hopped ale, and of all of them I have had I think it might be one of the best to have with food. If price is a concern I would definitely take this one over more expensive examples from SN or other breweries."
"Bitter but quaffable...I wish I had another!"
"Drinkability: This is a fairly intense beer on the palate. The taste does not dissipate too much."
"Bottle- pours deep copper/caramel colour with average head and thin lacing. Nose- grassy pine, some spice. Taste- spicy, with fairly meaty hop profile that is quite bitter and quickly drying. The caramel malts are there, but this is a very bitter brew and a little one sided on that aspect of the hops. Was hoping for more ""fresh"" hop flavours. Drinkability is good, but the dry bitterness does get somewhat tiring."
"the abv at 6.7 is a bit high for sessions, I'd recommend the Smuttynose Pale Ale at 5 abv and excellent taste for a comparable product."
"First off this series is always the best bang for the buck hands down, 4.35 for a 22oz bomber of this quality. Nice dark amber body with a slightly off white head. The smell is a bit disappointing, woody and grassy with a little bit of caramel. The taste is very good I love the nutty flavor at the end, very earthy and woody with a little malty sweetness to balance the slightly bitter woody taste. The body is on the light side of medium, a very drinkable beer."
"M/D- Good carbonation, medium bodied. very drinkable. would like to see some more hops expressed here since that is the selling point of this beer."
"D: Very drinkable - I drank tons of these at Toronado last week and hadn't tried it in the bottle yet. Picked one up tonight and wished I had grabbed a few more."
"Very consistent stuff out of the bottle, always seems to be less hoppy than the tap version. Of course I think my palate has been exposed to so many extreme hoppy beers, this might be the same as it ever was at times. Its not overly hopped, or under hopped, its wet hopped, and appreciated."
"Pours a clear, dark copper amber colour with a decent amount of head in the sam adams perfect pint glass. It has a slight malt caramal like taste, but I kinda taste rust like features in the finish. Not a lot of bitterness, and the hops aren't too noticable. Its very bland and not impressive to be honest. Haven't found too much from this brewery that I have enjoyed so far."
"Drinkability - this one is very easy to drink, very smooth and mellow in flavor but not lacking in taste. I feel as if their pale ale is more hoppy than what this is. Very pleasant beer, though."
"Quite drinkable, I plan on enjoying every sip of the seasonal classic."
"D: Very refreshing drink to have. Great especially because of its freshness and the wet hopping, which is some of the better that I have had this year."
"Overall, yet another delicious wet hop ale, well crafted and balanced with only minor flaws."
"D - Too bad hops aren't harvested in spring, cuz I would love this refreshing beverage then."
"M/D - This beer coats your mouth with a film often consistant with IPA's. Very pleasant. The drinkability is great. This is one that is fresh and light enough whereas the entire bomber could be downed by myself no problem."
"dark amber with red hues, very clear. A nice thick head with amazing retention. I poured the beer and let it sit for half an hour as I finished cooking and the head has barely moved. Lacing is nice. Grassy with citrus, and some pine, very green. The taste is clean with wet hop bitterness, grassy, citrus up front and a nice pine finish. Nice malt bill that doesn't dominate but adds enough residual sugars to balance nicely from an Americans point of view. A smooth beer with carbonation. A very drinkable beer at decent price."
"Sierra Nevada never disappoints, but this offering is phenomenal. I think I'll have another"
"Drinkability is very good. Sierra Nevada does good, drinkable hoppy beers well."
"Linger: 3"
"24oz bottle into a pint glass and then some. NHHWHA has a dark golden look with some bronze type tints. A significant amount of lace sticks to the glass all over the place, spraypaint like. Smells like wet hops with muted citrus and a nice bready build. This comes off hoppy in a earthy and different way. Taste is quite nice and one of my favorite wet hopped beers of the season. Getting a nice amount of citrus backed by pine with some caramel and bread. I like taste of this, alot. Feel is approaching medium with some spritz, drinkability is insane. I like the big bottles of this two. This is one i'll be scooping up a few more of before they are gone. I think southern hemisphere got this beat by a bit though."
"Kudos to Sierra Nevada for a nicely-priced beer here. Good, solid malt body with, as one would expect, a hop-centric focus. Herbacious and a touch grassy up front, sliding into a long, firm hops ride to the end. Hopping was a little rough around the edges and finished with a sharp quinine-like bittering that was discordant, bordering on harsh."
"Poured into a pint glass. Showed amber brown with thick white head, great retention and lacing. Smell of oily hops, sweet bready malts. Sweet and refreshing. Taste was incredibly balanced between the malt body up front and dry hoppy bitterness in the finish. Crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable, great beer."
"d - A very solid wet hop beer. WOuld certainly drink again."
"D: To be savored, warm and often. Share this with someone, someone who likes hops."
"Looks nice. Clear orange, a bit coppery, with a sticky yellow/beige cap. Tons of lace coated the glass, solid sheets and some streaky, spotty areas. Good head retention. Citrus hop aroma, solid but not overwhelming. Grapefruit rind, a bit powdery and spicy, slight resin. Bready malts in the background. Juicy hop flavour with moderate bitterness throughout. Crystal malt sweetness adds to the fruity, citrusy hop notes. Light alcohol in the finish along with some herbal hoppiness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, but too much to give it a creamy texture. Palate drying with a hint of alcohol warmth. I enjoyed it and found it to be quite easy drinking."
"A beautiful auburn pour with a sudsy head that stuck around through half of the pour in an aventinus .5l glass leaving a scant and sticky lace. Great carbonation,big bubbles. The hop and malt aromas are understated and did not detect much alcohol on the nose which I was surprised by this being a ""big"" beer. The sweetness on the nose lead me to expect a balanced brew which would be surprising to me as most AIPAs that I have sampled have been overwhelmingly hoppy. Again, not as heavy as I have come to expect from an AIPA but pleasant on the pallet, not slick or syrupy. The hoppy aftertaste is nice. Though it is not as representative of the style as I have come to expect, the brew is clean, crisp, and very flavorful. I will drink and cook with this all season long."
"D - very pleasant offering from the fine people in Chico."
"D - I really didn't like this one, I know it's supposed to be different but I really didn't enjoy this brew."
"Not a bad beer really; it's just kind of ""meh"" in terms of an IPA. Now, if the hops were given more wiggle room..."
"24 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a deep rich amber color with a thick three finger head. Lacy white head clings to the glass throughout the session. Fresh hoppy pine smell with a hint of malt. My first reaction is wow! Just the right amount of hoppy bitterness but there is slight amount sweetness that gives it a nice finish. The mouth feel is of medium body, nice carbonation, and feels fresh. Very drinkable beer, lots of flavor. Goes down nice and easy. At $5 a bottle well worth it."
"Drinkability: For a fresh hop beer this is definitely a go to. This is pretty readily available and only $5, which is a steal. Not quite the quality of the Estate, but this is an awesome beer. Definitely a beer that I pick up annually."
"This is a great wet hop ale and at 6.7 abv it can begin to hit sooner than expected. I strongly recommend this ale to any hophead who is looking for something new to try."
"Fantastic stuff...one of my favorite wet hop ales. Not even gonna bother shelling out the big bucks for Estate when this delicious nectar is only about half the price."
"Another Sierra Nevada IPA, another good experience. I like this one quite a bit more than the Southern Hemisphere."
"Sitting at 6.7%, this is drinking real well. I grabbed this bottle because it looked appealing and I'm very impressed. A great IPA from Sierra Nevada who are quickly becoming one of my favourite breweries."
"D: If you like hoppy beers, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed."
"D - So good, super glad I tried this one. Love the fresh hops and could enjoy this one time and time again."
"Like i said before this looks and tastes like a hopped up amber ale. Great brew for a cool fall day. I was expecting a fresh hop bomb and it is a little dissapointing in that aspect. I perfer more citrus/tropical hops profile."
"Notes: Love it."
"D-A decent IPA, but not an especially good wet hop ale. This beer seems to lack initiative in that it seems the brewer was unwilling to risk creating something exceptional. Is Sierra Nevada getting too big?"
"I have had this beer previous years but this version reminds me more of their Celebration Ale than I remember."
"I could drink many of these. With the hop bite and a malt backbone, combined with a nice mouthfeel and not too heavy ABV, this is one drinkable IPA."
"drinks well. fresh, juicy hoppy flavor with some nice, soft, and semisweet malts to back that up. Nothing earth-shattering, but one I'll enjoy a few times every year when its released."
"Glad to have you back in my life, fresh hops. Fresh hope."
"D - Pretty drinkable due to the balance. a Nice IPA to be sure but I seem to remember having liked the Southern Hemisphere a bit more. Worth picking up at the price point though and I could see myself grabbing another of these this year and certainly another when it comes out next year."
"Overall: a good beer, probably the king of the wet hop ales here. I like normal IPA's better but its a good change up from them."
"Taste is more complex, but again the rose is there from the start. Up front, it is sweet and rosey like rose Turkish Delight, soon joined by citrusy and spicey hop bitterness, nice sweet caramelly grain and light juicy fruitiness. Overall, the elements are gentle but fresh and bright, and well-integrated. Feel is great, creamy but lively. Drinkability is good."
"Pours a somewhat clear...somewhat dark amber color with a medium white head that doesn't hang around very long. Scent is what you could expect from a brewery that has mastered hoppiness. Great hop aromas...grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango...scent is amazing. The taste is amazing as well...although I wouldn't say it's as great as the southern hemisphere harvest. I get great citrus fruit and hop flavors...but southern hemisphere just stood out a bit more to me. Everything is so well balanced in this beer. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied, yet crisp. Drinkability is high. Another amazing IPA from SN!"
"Flavor does not disappoint either. Huge juicy graoefruit, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon, orange. A bit of pine under it all. Great hop profile. Touch of caramel malt base, but barely noticeable under the ridiculous amount of flavor from the hops."
"D - Good. Clean, bitter, refreshing, dry and flavorful. Quite quaffable, but the bitterness gets to be a little much after a few pints."
"D-All I can handle!!!! (3 max) lol"
"Pours a dark, clear, copper with a big foamy head. Head is off white and dissipates slowly leaving some chunky lacing behind. Nose is lots of piney, earthy hops. I hate to say it but ""fresh"" is the only word that comes to mind to describe it, smells like there's an actual hop sitting at the bottom of my glass. Nice hint of maltiness as well. Taste is again dominated with hops. Lots of earthy hop flavor with a nice biting bitterness that comes in at the finish. Nice, faint malt backbone throughout. Has a bit of a boozey taste, but not so much that it takes away from what is a solid brew. Maybe it's because I had a light dinner but it feels like this one is catching up with me fast for 6.7%. Another solid offering that contributes to my new found love of wet hopped beers."
"D-Great for a IPA. I look forward to these releases every year. It really showcases the pine and grass characteristics of the hops. Too bad they won't release them in six packs."
"pours a burnt copper color with three fingers white head. after the head disapates there is a nice amount of lacing.the aroma has subtile earthy and citrus characteristics about it. the taste is crisp, the light grapefruit notes from the hops dance off the toung. not too bitter. nice hints of smoke, almond, spice and citrus that all ballance well together. the aftertast of the hops lingers by the end of a glass. this brew drinks real nice. the ABV is just right at 6.7%. i find this brew to be very refreshing."
"D. This is a unique flavor and definately worth buying. I wish they had more, but I got the last one."
"Pours a very thick off white almost tan head. Color is very dark brown. The head is really strong on this one. Very strong bitter piney earthy hops in the nose. One of the strongest smelling IPA's around especially at 6.7% abv. I could live in this. Extremely bitter grassy dirty hop flavor with just a twinge of the grapefruit. Mostly just very, very bitter. Not much, if any, sweetness. How they pack the smell and taste into this low abv is crazy. Carbonation may be a bit sharp. I could lay waste to this beer. This and the Fresh hop are 2 of the best IPA's money can buy and costs way less too."
"Sierra Nevada Brewing Company--Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop Ale--2010 24 oz. Bottle. 6.70% ABV. 66 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) Harvest Ale. Big dense lacy foamy off white head. Bright Harvest red maple leaf color. Fragrant sweet toasted floral hop front. Creamy mellow sweet earthy crusted malt fruit caramel biscuit fresh hop infused delicious body. Rich earthy burpy malty smooth hop spice end. Sampled 10/10/2010. Purchased for $6.99 @ The Ballard Market on 10/10/2010."
"overall simply a stunning example of quality."
"Harvest Wet Hop Ale is another impressive hoppy ale from Sierra Nevada (SN). At times it's difficult to distinguish one from the other; however SN excels at this style and this offering is both solid and accessible."
"D:Overall a pretty average harvest ale. A little too balanced out then I would of thought it would have been, was expecting a little stronger hop presence on it. Other than that it was a average easy drink which was flavorful but not as much as I would have wanted from a harvest ale."
"Duvel tulip pour and I am met with an amber colored ale with a huge off-white head that will not go away. Excellent. The smell just gives me a sticky sensation as the nose is lowered. Light citrus smells, grape and some malty whiffs as well. Piney taste and grapefruit tanginess with some initial bitterness on the back of the tongue but it is rather subdued. Nice full bodied beer. Chewy. I tried to hold off on the drinking this but alas I could not hold out any longer. An excellent ""wet hop"" ale that I am sad to say I missed the first 12 releases. Looking forward to 14."
"Drinkability- I will easily finish the rest of the bomber and could want another."
"The finish is fresh, bright, distinct and herbal - it makes for the perfect finish to this wet hopped pale ale. I really enjoyed this beer and without hesitation would go for it again, however hop heads looking for that robust and aggressive hop explosion should look elsewhere - this beer has too much balance to play that game."
"Pours a crystal clear orange amber with a very nice sized crème head that has excellent staying power. Nose is very sticky, piney hops. Flavor is interesting. Kind of like a nice and thickly hopped ale with a leafy thing mixed in on the backend . Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and the liquid is pretty well bodied. Overall this is a good APA. Definitely smooth and robust. The bite is a bit much on the bubble, but it is definitely worth going for."
"Pours a a slightly rust copper colour with a good creamy off-white head and a moderate level of fine carbonation. The aroma is unmistakably earthy with a really irony metallic hint. The hops are clear on the nose and come through fresh and piney. The taste is heavy and full of malts at the start, with a thick mildly sweet caramel and slight grains, after which the hops are more prominent providing a bitter hit with a vegetative taste of greenery. Really great beer, much more balanced than I was expecting. Eagerly anticipate trying next years brew."
"D - Very good beer but I was expecting more hop smell and taste. I was also expecting an extremely bitter hop aftertaste but this beer was lacking in that regard."
"D--drinkable anytime, anywhere for a great price ($5)"
"Sampled at a beer tasting."
"Drinkability: All day Err day... Can't go wrong with this Americal style Ale."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer and it is no problem drinking all 24 oz. quickly. This is great to have as an affordable and nice drink for a special occasion."
"The beer had a medium body to it, excellent carbonation, creamy, smooth with a nice dry, bitter aftertaste. The beer was very easy to drink. Overall an excellent beer and one that I will most certainly drink again."
"D: A shade on the bitter side for me for everyday drinking. But damn fine, and I would welcome it in my glass again!"
"D - Equally good warm or cold. A very nice brew. Not the kind that punches you in the mouth. More like a wet kiss. Nice!"
"Wish I could get it near home."
"MD-Creamy feel from a head that sticks around for long time. This is the beer that is going to change my outlook on American IPA's. Thanks to MattE for the bottle ."
"Pours a very appealing amber color with a billowy off white head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is very mild. There's hints of piney hops and some fruit, perhaps apples and figs. They blend very well together. It's very distinct and sweet. I'd say the majority of hops has faded, as this is a 2009 and, well, it's April 2010. This tastes almost like a barleywine at this point. The malts kinda take over and there's a bit of bitterness from whatever is left of the hops. Mouthfeel is good. There's not a bunch of carbonation here. It's very smooth overall though the drinkability is suspect."
"I'm not as analytical a taster/reviewer as some, so I'll just say that it was an enjoyable brew. If you're reading this to decide whether or not to buy, I say Go for it!"
"I remember drinking this for the first time and immediately saying ""wow, I would love to have this again."" I have had it again, and it does not disappoint."
"Notes: Great brew to mix it up every now and than...you should def pick it up"
"Disappointment for me, if only because of what I am accustomed to."
"This beer is extremely drinkable, and it delivers awesome hop flavors. A must drink for hop-heads. The balance definitely favors the hops, but malt is not this beer's focus. The Harvest and ""wet hop"" promises, and the taste delivers."
"D - A well-done, tasty IPA that showcases the wet hops very nicely. Good balance and a delicious and complex hop profile. I hope I can get my hands on an even fresher bottle on the next release."
"D - Exceptional. Much like all of SN's beers, it is always a pleasure to drink one or three in a session. 5.0"
"D: Excellent drinkability. This beer comes in a big bottle for a reason. One is not enough."
"Thanks for this beer!"
"I'll have to make sure I get it fresh the next time it is released. Not my favorite Sierra, but excellent nonetheless."
"Would and will drink again. Not a session brew but one to enjoy."
"T/M - I'm not a huge fan of overly hoppy beers but am enjoying this one. Certainly hoppy. Very creamy and full mouthfeel that stays throughout before trailing off in a pleasantly bitter finish."
"OK, so I gained a lot of respect for SN after drinking this beer. I will seek this out again and again."
"D: Excellent. Well balanced brew...goes down too easy!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured in glass with nice amber color and thin but thick head. Smell and taste are typical SN like, pine and citrusy. Great drinkability ...! However, I would not neccessary consider this an AIPA, more like an APA"
"Verdict: Harvest is another solid, well balanced, tasty, and drinkable offering from Sierra Nevada. I'm not sure how much credit is due to the wet hop element, and how much is due to the recipe, but the end result is good enough that I just don't care."
"Excellent Ale! I must say poured into a pint glass it has a dark aber color with a nice head that sticks to the glass the whole way down. It has a strong but nice smell of hops. The taste is a very hoppy with the taste of pine being whats noticable. The mouthfeel is great. You would think from the look of it that it would be heavy but its slick and smooth, which makes for a superp drinkability!"
"D - I really like this beer for the fresh hop taste without the tongue crushing bitterness. Much more balanced and subtle than SN Celebration. Very nice brew."
"D- Great tasting ale with citrus/hop hitting the pallet. Very Drinkable."
"D - Superior brew for hopheads only!"
"This bottle might be a bit old, bottled five months ago. Would love to try this fresher!"
"The assertive hops are very appropriate if you're a fan of the style creating character and refreshment. This is a well-made beer with plenty of traditional character to offer."
"D: Very, very drinkable. With a light mouthfeel, a subtle but pleasant taste, and an above average abv (6.7%), this is a session beer. Too bad I haven't seen it in six packs."
"Well the bottle says 2009, but I do not know exactly how old the bottle is. If you buy it now though, it's going to lack the hop flavors I'm sure were there if it were fresh. High price plus lack of flavor equals disappointment for me."
"I will look for this one again."
"Overall, I can dig it. Manageable ABV and flavors that leave you wanting more. Nothing over the top, just a solid seasonal offering from a cornerstone of the craft revolution."
"Poured a perfect beautiful amber/orange color into a mug with 2 fat fingers of off-white creamy fluff head with good retention, and quite possibly the best sticky lace rings i have seen to date, all the way down, just pure awesome. Gives off big hops, pine/mango aromas. At first sip its a very nice roasty/toasty flavor with alot of citric and piny hops that are strong but not overly so, bitter but just right. A medium feel and the right amount of carbonation, the flavors in this IPA are blended just right, a real solid brew. Im drinking this in winter but i wish id had it during fall also as it would be great for the season, definitely going to pick this up again."
"It has the bitterness I have come to expect from IPAs, but it isn't nearly as strong as the (admittedly few) IPAs I have had before. This does not have a dry finish, nor does it have a ton of carbonation. It goes down well and I am enjoying it."
"The first sip provided a harsh lupulin overload, but once my palate was prepared, the complexity of the hop presence revealed itself. While the ale is certainly hop dominated, it is in no way one-dimensional. Very enjoyable."
"again, another reason i put SN at the top as one of the best breweries. one of the true pioneers still at it."
"d- So good. Each sip/gulp/drink leaves me wanting another. Very refreshing, full in flavor, but balanced. An exemplary example of what this brewery does so well. I can fall back on this beer time and time again. (especially with the Torpedo shortage in Iowa right now! but that's another discussion altogether)"
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Would pick up again, a nice representation of an IPA"
"Overall it's a lot like a bigger fresher tasting Celebration ale. It has the spice, caramel and toast but it's just a bit bigger and more delicious. Great beer."
"D: I don't think it's the most mindblowing IPA out there, but I almost always get one of these when I see them. They're very solid and a steal for the price."
"The fairly thick mouthfeel (sticky) is significantly lightened by the generous carbonation. This brew is a deliciously drinkable beer, and if the ABV was not an issue, could easily be drank en masse."
"Drinkability: Yet another decently drinkable, fairly enjoyable India Pale Ale from Sierra Nevada."
"The aroma is very hoppy with citrus, yeast, grains, caramel, and pine. The appearance is amber gold with a large foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter finish. The palate is smooth. Overall a very well made beer that tastes even hoppier than it smells."
"I wasn't overly impressed by this one; maybe it's because I've been so enamored with the Torpedo and Anniversary offerings, maybe I was just expecting a major hop bomb, or maybe this beer was simply past it's prime. worth a try, but I'd wait until the next batch is released to check it out."
"D: All day, every day. This is a great example of how to make a session PA that still retains flavor and aroma. Delicious and well-priced at 3.99 for a 24oz"
"D: I could drink this brew year-round."
"D-Very, very easy drinking. The lack of overt bitterness makes this dangerously drinkable."
"D: I haven't been let down by a Sierra Nevada beer yet, and this is no exception. In fact, I'd go as far to say it's my favorite SN beer to date."
"A spicy well-hopped aroma. Piny and a little fruity. Tastes like fresh piny hops with touches of spicy bitterness. Some citrus, but more pine in my experience. Sweet caramel shows itself in the background. Somewhat bready and drying on the finish. Nicely carbonated, smooth and slick mouthfeel. A worthwhile IPA."
"D: A really nice seasonal fresh hop offering from SA and at 6.7%, one you could pick up a few bottles of and make a grilling session out of. Went really well with my stuffed mushroom and scallion burger with whole grain IPA mustard. Really tasty on its own as well. A must try."
"A great experience. A great drink. A few of these could easily convert me into a real hop monster."
"The light copper colored body displayed some chill haze, and sported a picturesque two finger thick head. The smell was fresh and herbal, just a wet hop ale should be. The taste was very caramelized and citric with a sugary malt backbone. The body felt slightly thinner than the norm, and the sugary burst like aftertaste was a little brief as well. A very well constructed beer in my opinion."
"This beer has absolutely changed the way I look at hoppy ales. The fresh hops add huge depth and complexity in the flavor and aromas that you don't expect to find in most IPAs. I look forward to getting more of this as soon as I see it, and I'll be on the lookout for Sierra Nevada's other fresh hop/harvest beers."
"D: An exceptionally smooth brewed beer that satisfies your thirst of fresh wet hops with a smooth character that will no doubt keep you coming back for more. Solid drinkability with a good enjoyability factor. A good beer to sit back and relax to on a lazy Sunday afternoon."
"Pours copper with a light tan head. Aromas of hops dominate but there is a faint aroma of malt. A backbone of malt is in the flavor followed by the subtle wet hop flavor (chinook maybe?). Smooth finish slightly piney and citrusy. Very refreshing and not over the top makes this an enjoyable beer."
"D: This is a great value beer from Sierra Nevada (as always). Next year I'll have to pick this up right after it comes out."
"This is a highly enjoyable beer to drink...not as bitter as some of the other Sierra beers like Torpedo or Celebration but just as good if not better. I definitely recommend this one.."
"Overall, another strong effort from SN, that allows the house-style to come through while giving the drinker something new to try. Pretty cool...."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, has a nice flavor profile without being overpowering, probably a good beer to offer to some one starting to branch out of the big box brewers while offering enough character and flavor for a more experienced pallate to enjoy."
"D: As easy to drink as any other hoppy SN release. Very good brew, worth a try."
"Pours out a perfectly clear dark coppery orange, almost amber color with a head that resides at about one finger. The head is very frothy and has a light tan hue. The retention is great and lacing about a millimeter thick starts to be left as the head dies down. The lacing does start to let off as I get further down the glass. Certainly a good looking beer. The first thing I have to say is the hops are less aggressive than I thought they would be. In the nose I get a huge malty, grain smell that reminds me exactly of the smell of the kettle when boiling up some homebrew. I get a tiny bit of hops in there too. The nose has a good strength but is a bit bland for me. The pale malt extract nose makes me want more out of this, especially the wet hops they mentioned. The taste improves a bit on the nose. The same pale malt/homebrew grain notes are found in the taste along with some nice hops. The hops are rather weak though and seem to only be used for bittering. I get a nice bitter finish on this one and some earthy hop flavor. Once again, I want more of the hops. The mouthfeel is fairly appropriate for an IPA. I would like it to have a little more body but it is not overly watery as it is. There is some creaminess to it and no alcohol warming or taste whatsoever. The carbonation is also a bit low for this style. The DB of this one is the best thing next to the appearance. This one definitely drinks well and goes down nice and smoothly. I want more out of the nose and taste but at $4 a 24oz bottle I am drinking something that was worth the money. Sierra Nevada is good at making session beers."
"Opinion: If anyone has read any of my previous reviews, I always mention that I am not a hop-head. This beer is still REALLY hoppy for my taste, but it is not a bad beer overall. I like that it has some age on it and that the hops have softened up some. I will certainly drink all of this beer, but this is not one that I will be seeking out in the future."
"this was delicious and complimented my white sauce pasta. the hops were dead on perfect and really came out."
"D: Eminently drinkable. Somewhere between their flagship Pale Ale and their Torpedo in quality. In other words, another damn good beer. Could session it easily."
"Overall for a beer that cost under $5 this was very good. Probably not my favorite wet hop beer but a great value."
"Really high drinkability. Ill probably grab this and every other release of this. Not to mention any other releases that I can find from SN. Really loved every beer Ive had from Sierra Nevada. This is no exception. Its up there, probably at the top."
"From the 24 fl. oz bottle. No lot code or expiration date listed but this was the 2009 13th release edition. Sampled on December 17, 2009. It pours a decent looking amber tone but quite cloudy. A thin but frothy beige head caps off the top of the brew with a little beige lacing on the side of the glass. While the aroma is clearly well-hopped, there is also something kind of soapy about it. I found that to be odd, which is why my 'smell' rating is the lowest one on the BA rating scale. The mouthfeel runs about medium in texture. A bitterly hopped taste greets the taste buds. This makes me think of a dessert beer. It had this kind of pie-like quality to it as well. Good for afters. A nice beer in the end."
"Notes: Nice brew, in line with some of these Sierra Nevada big bottle offerings,i.e. nice but not too remarkable. Rather similar to those reviews. In fact, it might be a bit of a let down if one follows its own hype. I could have had this one a bit late off the shelve compromising the freshness, but the place is typically legit and I´m getting this vibe from their production on this range. For a web hop ale I sure had a better feel with others."
"Overall this was a nice wet hop American IPA that contained balanced yet subtle flavor, but I would like a bit more of a flavor profile for this to really compete in this segment. Worth a Try."
"it's nice to be able to drink the sierra releases when they come around. 100% quality"
"salud!"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is astringent, clean, and rich. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. I am a bit disappointment in this beer, thier pale ale is really a up in your face; although, this beer is a very good IPA."
"D: All night, for the rest of my life. I'll buy at least two of these bombers every year."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Raleigh on Oct. 27 served in a standard pint glass and reviewed from notes. The beer was served a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is crisp citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The taste is loads of crisp sharp hops in front of sweet malts. The beer was light, crisp, and quite smooth. This is a very enjoyable beer, it's too bad its only this good once a year."
"Well-balanced refreshing and clean, focused flavors."
"Pours a mostly clear orange with creamy white head, big globs of thick lacing. Smell: slightly grainy and sweet, floral, orange extract. Fresh cut grass and... sour apple? Taste: lightly toasty / bready, pine, tangerine, grassy, oily. Medium bodied and phenomenally smooth and creamy. Nose is a bit disappointing compared to other fresh hop ipas, but still tasty."
"D: this is really great, but not a session beer, between the super hopiness and the 6.7 ABV. lovin this"
"(I originally wrote this review in October, but it got deleted during site difficulties. I reposted it now when I realized it was missing)."
"drinkability: another solid IPA, and probably my favorite speciatly ale that they do."
"Notes: Another outstanding selection from Sierra Nevada with big bold hop flavor and nice supporting malt."
"Pours a very clear amber color with a slightly yellowish stained head of foam that is more than 2 fingers of big bubbles. Head retension is stellar, almost a full finger of fluff remains down to the last sip. Tons of lacing all over the glass. Nose is an awesome mixture of hops that reak of pine, flowers, citrus and spice. Little bit of malt coming through the hop aroma as well. Taste is an awesome blend of hops with a malt and grain base. Hops play the leading role and have a finish that is bitter but not a lingering oil-like resiny finish, it is quite crisp considering the extent of the hop bitterness. Carb level is medium on this and the feel is quite light. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes a little more pronounced but the hops are the real star here and rightfully so. Very good beer, I will snag another one of these if I get the chance."
"Pours a dark brown amber color with a two finger head that gives way to some okay lacing. The aroma is of citrus and piney hops with a sweet malt backbone, there are also notes of lemon and orange. The taste is of citrus and pine hops over the sweet malt backbone, the hops do not have the typical strong hop bite of a regular ipa, however, it is a nice bite and flavor. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The drinkability is very high, the flavor and taste is well rounded, it is not bitey or lacking bite, just good overall balance."
"Drinkability: Pretty good if you like bitterness."
"And the burps are pretty good, actually. Had to note that."
"The hops really stand out in this beer as expected with very bright and fresh feeling to it. The bitterness is just right with right amount of citrus and other flavors to make this a very drinkable beer."
"D - Sierra Nevada never disappoints me...another classic IPA that needs to be consumed...I'll have to wait until next year and compare"
"Pours a beautiful, rich amber with a nice ivory head. Aroma is wonderful. Lots of big, but delicate hops. Taste is full and very hoppy, but not overpowering. Very nice hops, with pine, a little citrus, and maybe a hint of rose. Very floral, and very tasty. Mouthfeel and drinkability also both excellent. Overall, an excellent beer. Floral and crisp and almost sweet. The hops are bracing but not at all bitter. Yum."
"A nice crisp and clean copper with a very voluptuous white head. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Smells of very fresh hops and some grassy, piney aromas. I also get a sweet honey like aroma towards the end. Tastes like fresh hops, pretty simple. Not super bitter, but rather sweet. The honey comes back again on the end of the sip. The beer has grapefruit notes for sure, but not as evident as I've found in dry hopped IPA's. The fresh hop seems to lend a sugary sweetness that coats the bitterness of the hops. Mouthfeel is a bit average for an IPA, crisp and clean. Medium body. A 24 oz. bottle of this brew goes down easily, as does two of them..."
"The feel is really good. Just enough body to know its beer, with carbonation that is kept in check allowing a smoothness and easy drinkability. This is a beer worth waiting for on an annual basis. Nice freshness to the flavor. Maybe next year I'll try to drink it earlier to see if the flavors vary."
"Very good beer. Give me another!!!!"
"This is a very tasty fresh hop ale. I think the Southern Hemisphere is a notch better actually, but this is a very good beer in its own right."
"D: Very good. Sessionable. The reduced maltiness is appreciated and certainly adds to the drinkability. However, there is enough going on for this one to still have a good bit of flavor."
"D- Very drinkable, I really love these wet hop beers, I've yet to try one that wasn't really drinkable. Overall a great beer when it's on tap, I wouldn't mine picking up a couple bottles anyways though."
"A rich and accurate bitter hop flavor fills the mouth and then slowly drags the bitter flavor behind it as you drink. The flavor is very herbal or floral or whatever and far less fruity than expected, but its not a bad thing. This is a hop strong but ultimately very drinkable and balanced. Although the malts nothing special, I understand thats not important. A good wet hop experience from SN... Mouth feel's great"
"D: It went really fast, very nice and drinkable. I'll be having this again."
"Poured a hazy orange/red with respectable head that faded to a thick collar. The aroma was citrus but malt was there in the background. The taste was in line with the aroma with a bitter after taste added. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. A good, solid American IPA."
"D- I could sit and drink this one all night smooth and easy to drink I just love the harvest line up Thanks SN for another fine brew."
"D- The use of fresh hops in this beer is really noticeable. They lend a spicy freshness that just isn't present in other IPAs. Really a must try!"
"D-As is the case with a SN beer, this is very drinkable."
"Buy Again: Yes."
"Poured this one into my Goose Island IPA glass. There is a huge, pillowly foam sitting on this one and the aroma is jumping out of the glass. Grapefruit and grass, kind of tickles the nostrils in a good way. Tons of lacing as the head settles. This is the smoothes IPA ever, like glass. The taste kind of works its way out after a sip or so. You know the hops are there but so is an almost vegetable like bite (asparagus??). It finishes very dry and bitter. Kind of morphs from the time it touches your tongue to the last drop heading down the ol pie hole. The mouth feel is almost pilsner like if you know what I mean. I'm enjoying this one but just can't get into it. Can't pinpoint why, maybe just a bad day, but it's just not there. For sure give it a shot, there are some highly praising reviews."
"One extraordinary grapefruity-IPA, could probably be considered an American Pale Ale, not too bold but just very, very well done. Cannot be beat for the price!"
"D: Very good harvest style beer. Get it early while it last."
"D - A great experience, but not a go-to beer. Demands focus and attention on the part of the drinker (not always a plus). On the other hand, I was very sorry to see it gone."
"Deep amber to copper color with a two finger off white head. Smells of grapefruit along with floral and pine hops. The taste has the previously mentioned hops flavors along with oranges, and a sweet malt backbone. The hops are bitter and oily, but not overwhelmingly bitter. I view this as a plus. Finishes dry and perfectly carbonated. This is a nice enjoyable beer."
"D: Overall, Very drinkable IPA. The price is right as well...at $3.49 for 24oz. Already bought a case of the Fresh Hop Ale earlier in the year. May also consider purchasing a case of the Wet Hop Ale."
"Drinkability overall is killer something that you will want to hoard but an experience that you should definitely pass around to some close friends. Considering this type of experience could convert a fraction of the masses drinking mindlessly bland tasting American industrial lager."
"I wouldn't expect anything less from Sierra Nevada. This is an excellently balanced IPA, and a pleasure to drink. Thanks to Shawn for sharing."
"This was the first time I had drank a wet hop beer. This particular brew involves picking the hops and getting them into the boil within a few hours, which is amazing to me. The result is not just a very hoppy beer, but one in which the hops taste almost raw and unrefined. Takes a few sips to get used to, and this isn't really a beer to enjoy for much longer than that, at least in one sitting, but even so this is a fantastic beer. Makes me proud to be an American."
"Poured from a bomber. Great autumn colors dominate the pour, with brown and orange hues and a dirty white head. Good layer of head, lacing sticks but doesnt last long. Nose filled with that fresh hop smell you would expect. Some citrusy notes as well. The ""fresh"" smell and taste is simply put, amazing. Fresh cut grass and just enough maltiness to provide a nice balance. Medium in body, good amount of carbonation. Drinks so smooth, I have already finished the bomber. For the price, this beer is an incredible value. The perfect beer for the fall season and I am going to be drinking this beer well into the cold months of winter."
"I love how Sierra Nevada celebrates everything with hops. Autumn? Let's make some wet-hopped IPAs! Winter? Let's make one of Reaper's favorite IPAs in Celebration Ale! Go buy a bomber or two of this and raise a glass to the hop farmers who make it all possible."
"D: Ho-hum....another delicious specialty IPA from the folks at Sierra Nevada. I wonder if they get bored of brewing these big, fresh, beers all the time. I'd guess not, and I'm certainly not tired of drinking them. A very nice, juicy, grassy IPA that's worth seeking out."
"D - Pretty good. I won't have any trouble finishing the bomber. I think if it was on the dry side, drinkability would be even better. Pretty nicely priced for my area at $6 per bomber. I rarely get bombers cheaper than that, honestly."
"Overall, I dig Sierra Nevada. They do harmonious things with hops. I prefer the Southern Hemisphere on taste, but this one is lovely!"
"Highly recommend, as always."
"Poured from a 22 oz I see the hazy orange/amber beer form a nice white head at the top of my pint glass. The smell of the beer lends a hoppy spiciness smell and gets you ready for the flavor that's about to ensue. Not sure what to expect from a wet hopped beer, I'm pleasantly surprised at the freshness of this beer. As I tasted it, there's a malty initial taste followed by the hops. Real nice fresh hoppy flavor comes through which gives way to a citrus and spicey flavor. Overall, it's a very nice balance between the malt and hops. There is a touch of bitterness in the finish but that's definitely a good thing. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied. The body of the beer, the balance and smell make this beer a very drinkable IPA from SN. Not that I expected anything less. A real nice flavorful beer with a great balance of flavor, body and aroma. This is a beer you can settle into for the evening and sample a few from the luxury of your own home."
"Picked up a bomber. I love SNBC bombers, they are the full 24 oz. not 2 oz short like all other bombers (even my own home brew hehe). Bottle smell is a crispy hoppiness followed by an intertwined maltiness. Pours to a yellow brown with a nice two finger micro bubble head. Taste is indeed hoppy but the bitterness is accompanied by a brown sugar maltiness. Great backbone. Very consistent from start to finish, with a tad more bitterness in the finish. Most definitely a hop lovers beer. Great aroma, flavor and bitterness. SNBC never dissapoints, I'm glad almost all of what they make, I think, is available here in FL."
"This baby was very fresh, all the chemicals in the hops were here to play. It was almost a little overwhelming, i was hoping for some maltiness to at least balance some of the hops. But wow, extremely unique and a must try."
"drinkability - i have yet to have i beer from SA where i did not want another one - its just too bad i only bought one - live & learn"
"Drinkability: I'm on my first cup, wouldn't want to over do it, but it would be easy! Just sayin', it's quality stuff."
"Poured a copper color with a small, white head. Smell is hoppy, but not the pine and citrus I was expecting. Taste is very well balanced, with lots of caramel and biscuity malt to go with a strong hop flavor. I am once again not getting much pine or citrus in the taste. It is more of an earthy hop aroma. A very well put together IPA."
"Drinkability: For the price compared to the Sierra Nevada estate brew this is a steal. This is far superior to any of the Sierra Nevada IPAs and should be experienced by any lover of good IPAs. High ABV aside this beer would be too tasty not to be drinking it as long as possible."
"It was a bit one-noted, but I couldn't get enough of it. Every sip is enjoyable and strongly encourages another. This beer is perfect for any occasion: slightly dry and distinctly hoppy, while still well-balanced and a bit fruity."
"I'd like to see more malt backing up these awesome hops. It is a bit on the thin side, especially for a fall release. This type of body would be more appropriate for spring/summer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and I wish it was a little more full."
"D: A well made wet-hopped beer, could have another glass or two. Sierra Nevada continues its reputation for distinguished brews"
"Mostly clear medium amber with a medium-large, foamy, off-white head that slowly diminishes to a thin lasting head. Very nice lacing. Smell just as the label describes, huge juicy hops aromas that put a face on my face. Malts presence is of course not center-stage here but offers enough in the nose to balance it out. The taste is more of the same, Huge pine and citrus over a light sweet malt backbone. Bitter and cloying? Very. And not in a bad way at all. I was tasting this for an hour after finishing it."
"Beer is bitter on the back end but only slightly. The mouthfeel is a little thin. Not a lot happening in the midpalate or front mouth areas as far as this beer. Second taste time, some funk in there as well. Not a well balanced hoppy ale, sorry SN. A slight miss IMO. Drinkability is fine, although the bitterness builds on you. Its mediocre, I expect more from you SN."
"Pours a nice amber/copper color, with full off-white head. Decent retention & lacing. Smell is fresh, spicy and piney hops with hints of carmel, as well as floral and citrus hops. Upfront taste is a spicy and piney bitter hop blend, smooth carmel malts, toasted grains and hints of floral and citrus hops present. Feel is medium body, slightly sticky and coating with good carbonation. Another good beer from Sierra Nevada that shows the different things you can do with grains and hops."
"D- Good, tasty. Complex enough. Not a knock you off your socks kind of beer but one I'm glad I drank."
"D= Not too bad. the only complaint I have the the grassy hop taste didn't have enough punch for me. Torpedo had too much punch and this had to little... The thing I don't like about this beer may be that it tastes like the shitty hops one of my neighbors gave me this year... I'm grateful for the hops and they are great for something like dry hopping but the AA isn't there."
"MF/D: Good carbonation, twangy/bitter aftertaste, with a distinct fresh-hop finish"
"got a 24 0z bomber at my go to store today..whoa !! this poured a beautiful copper color with sticky lacing and fresh looking 1/2 head i could smell this as soon as i opened it..the smell is pine needles grapefruit and toasted caramel malt ...wow this ale just smells of hop resins and a pine forest ..the taste is a hop showcase of pure delight bite however it is balanced very nicely with some sweet toasted malts...very drinkable leave it to SN to make a great wet hop at an affordable price this ale is great and highly recommended"
"Drinkability: An APA that drinks almost like a heavier big IPA. Minus the bitterness and extreme citrus flavors. It is heavy and filling, but still refreshing so I say its very drinkable. Seek this out while it last. All fresh hop ales are slightly"
"1193"
"Man, these Sierra beers just keep getting better and better. The 13th Wet Hop Harvest is marvelous, and a steal at the $4 price going at my local beer-pusher. This is one of the best buys of 2009. Buy it soon, drink it fresh!"
"Drinkability: Not nearly as fresh or juicy as the Founders Harvest or as interesting as the Southern Hemisphere. This just seems like a solid APA/IPA hybrid. Very good, but expected more."
"Well priced, adequate percent alcohol, and good size make this a easily consumable delight."
"This brew has some qualities that I would expect to find in a big beer, however the relatively low ABV allows room for more than one."
"D - Such a spot on beer, everything is so right about it. I get excited for all their harvest ale releases."
"Medium body with light to medium carbonation. Another solid offering from SN and I have no complaints. I'll be coming back for more."
"D=greatly drinkable, could easily drink 3 or 4 not overpowering in any aspect but nicely flavorful in most."
"D - Warming and refreshing at the same time."
"Overall - Inspiring beer! Really, close to, if not as good of APA as you're going to find out there."
"Dave"
"Overall, this beer exudes freshness. I have never held an actual hop so I don't have an idea of what a freshly picked hop would smell like, but I got an idea that this is pretty close. My favorite thing about this beer was the earthy notes in the aroma and taste"
"Pours out a deep ruby red with a thick white head. Great lacing all the way down. The scent is barely apparent with my terrible nose. The taste has a very nice hop bite upfront. The freshness of the hops is very evident and much appreciated. The mouthfeel is great, very smooth and just the right amount of carbonation. Sierra Nevada does it again with another great Wet Hop Beer."
"The clarity if this beer is impeccable. It pours a honey colored amber with a thick lingering foam that leaves a lot of lace on the glass. The smell is herbal hoppiness mixed with a little sweet maple syrup. The taste is pleasantly bitter with a very dry finish. The hop profile is unmistakably Sierra Nevada, but there is less pine smell and flavor than in their standard APA. Mouthfeel is just about perfect and the overall drinkability is great."
"- All around, SN makes some of the best Harvest Ales around in my opinion, and this one doesn't disappoint. The Estate was great, and so is this.. in it's own way."
"I could drink this beer all night long. It was definitely brewed for hop-heads (which I most certainly am) but it maintains excellent balance as well, making it all that much more enjoyable. This is an exceptional beer, and for the price (I found the 24 ounce bottles for $3.69 each), you should go out right now and pick yourself up enough to last you until the 14th release next fall."
"drinkability: very sessionable, very affordable and damn good tasting."
"D - This is a steady beer that I could continue to drink. Not one of my top harvest ales, but I would not kick it out of bed."
"Drinkability: Complex but not robust, the other flavors tend to mask the overall hoppiness. An interesting brew but not the typical flavors one would associate with a Sierra Nevada."
"A nice solid beer, should be easy to find and try and it is worth it."
"D - For an IPA, this is high marks. Not palate (or judgment) destroying, but a nice kick in the pants."
"D: This is easily one to sit with for a bit, goes down easily, nicely balanced a touch maltier than other versions of this style, but still worth a try."
"D - This was the 13th release of the beer was another home run from Sierra Nevada, I know this is for the 12th, but I will transfer it if they say that these are different beers"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable APA that I'll definitely have again. I could easily have had a few more given the right time and circumstances. This beer was also a nice complement for the taco salad that arrived at the table about half way through the beer."
"Again a really solid beer from SN. This is just so drinkable and enjoyable that it's crazy. It almost leans on an IPA, but the smoothness keeps it firmly planted as an APA. Well done."
"Notes: Interesting beer Sierra Nevada and one that every Beer Advocate should try."
"Yum, so tasty and fresh. A side by side with the Estate showed the Harvest to be a shade hoppier, as well as the added dank, resinous note from the wet hops. Otherwise the two beers are pretty identical. I prefer the Harvest though over the Estate."
"Very good."
"Moderate mouth with some resins and dryness as it fades. Again, a couple steps down from a BW which is just right per style. The abv is just low enough for more drinking which just adds to a very tasty and well done brew."
"Poured into a pint glass. Slightly hazy amber/copper color, with a decent head, and mild lacing. The best way to describe the aroma is Cascade hops on acid; super floral and citrus notes, which only became more potent in the flavor. Nice citrus and woodiness in the flavor, with a characteristic Sierra dry finish. Medium-bodied and decently carbonated. Fantastic sensation, spells a great session ipa. I will definitely be on the lookout for more 'wet-hop' ipa's."
"Overall- i think this is past it's prime but such a weird and amazing brew from it. sorry if this isn't helpfull but would recommend it. if you're an ipa fan and have a chance at a wet hopped ale i say go for it!"
"D; I could really sit back and sip on this for a while."
"An orange/amber body sits beneath a huge rocky, ecru cap that rose a full two fingers and subsided slowly, leaving loads of spider web lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose is good balance of caramel, toasted bready malt, flowers and pine. Pine and fresh flowers, light grapefruit, leafy tobacco, caramel and a toasted malt base round out the flavor profile. A nice balance all in all with the caramel adding to the sweetness of the hops and the bitterness is a pleasant little punch. Easily quaffable with the booze extremely well hidden within the medium body. Another winner from Sierra."
"Overall - It would seem this beer is good whether consumed fresh or aged a bit, only getting a little different as time goes by. I look forward to future iterations of this beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"The body and drinkability are typical for the style. It is unfair that I'm reviewing this beer when it's a year old, this beer was almost certainly much better when fresh. I'm on record as thinking that SN is guilty of making a series of similar IPAs. This one seems like it may have been better than the usual SN IPA. I hope that I can try this years version and give this brew a higher score."
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. Kind of wish they made this year around and not had it be a seasonal. But this is a very nice beer to sit on the porch and welcome in the summer or fall with. Keeps you warm on a chilly spring or fall night."
"Poured from bomber to pint glass an orange amber color with a bubbly light cream colored one inch head that reduces to heavy lacing and a solid sheen. Has a nice hoppy smell but does not overwhelm the malt backbone. Has a bitter hop flavor with a mild malt sweet finish. Sticky mouthfeel and very drinkable at 6.7 APV. This is one I will seek out again."
"D: I will have to try this again in from a bottle or on tap somewhere."
"D- I realize that this brew is probably a bit old for an IPA. I think that some of the hop flavor may have faded a bit, but the malt has really begun to shine and it makes for a very interesting flavor."
"I would love to try a homebrew clone version of this excellent beer."
"T- It should be noted that this came of a keg that was kicked after serving. It had an intense taste, very bitter with a banana kind of taste. Slight balance of wheat to it."
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Poured a cloudy amber color with foamy butter head that faded slow and left good lacing. Smelled of malts and earthy hops. Tasted toasty with earthy hops, grass, and malt. Smooth but slightly bitter finish. Like the large bottle."
"Drinkability? Off the charts. See this at your store? Buy this. Lucky you. This was the last one at my local guy. On second thought maybe that's a good thing, I'd probably crack it next."
"Pours a nice caramel color with really good clarity, big thick lasting foam. Nose is mostly of hops with a bit of malty sweetness but not too citrusy. Fairly heavy bodied and pretty creamy and smooth - not very carbonated. Mostly American hoppy APA bitterness at first but actually finishes very chewy, almost like a brown ale - big caramel flavor. Lasting subtle finish of Pacific Northwest hops. Unique and quite hearty, I'll be getting this one again! Probably best for the fall/winter seasons. I haven't really had one quite like this. Why don't I drink other Sierra Nevadas (besides the Pale Ale) more often???"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Okay, this one caught me by surprise, and I am glad to see others rating this as highly as I did. (Usually) not swayed by gimmicky labels or elaborate descriptions of brewing processes, I nonetheless pronounce a simple amen after finishing the glass.... opens with a tremendously aromatic fragrance with a floral, buttery smoothness... beautiful orange-brown body in an oversized Hop Devil snifter; two-finger foam leaves wonderful lacing, the look of a limited release... medium to full-bodied, with a crunch that reverberates--a smoothness early that balances well with the grit betweent the teeth... not at all my expectations: no big Christmas tree suck of pine cone explosion, no cascade of Cascade--mellow, almost laidback to the point of sharing common ties with the creamier, more balanced English pales... start to finish, a crowning achievement... an excellent spring nightcap to a day of work, but in most (any?) settings this would work well, well enough to finish the 24oz. bottle and wish for a second...I get more of the citrus as the glass drains, but this may be misadvertised as a hophead's ""wet"" dream , due to the fact that the pleasure of drinking this beer is its bouquet and its flavor balance... I had to buy brother Jer a bottle before the 4th, just to share the triumph with someone..."
"Golden orange color with a big frothy head, great lacing, amazing head retention. Smells citrusy, orange, grass, earthy, pine. Huge hoppy taste, more grass like in the nose. Resinous hop flavor. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Very drinkable."
"I can't see the drinkability being very high on a beer like this, but I very much need another bottle of this! Very good beer. Sierra Nevada never disappoints"
"Quite drinkable and another winner from Sierra Nevada."
"Really great beer- Complex and fresh tasting with a lot of nuances of the hops on display. Great to see that this was bottled. Pours a dark orange with a grainy looking head that settles to a thin cap and some light lacing. Lots of citrusy hop aromas, tangerine and lime especially, and some floral notes. Beautiful. There are some honeyed malt notes that are an appropriate balance for the vibrant but not in-your-face hops. The taste is robust, and because they are fresh hops there are some vegetal notes up front, including a touch of asparagus and herbs. There is also an added note of pine. Some sweet malt throughout. I love the fresh taste and the interplay of different hop components. Smooth and clean in the mouth, this is absolutely delicious."
"Drinkability- yes I could have 6 of these."
"Price @ 3.99 for a 24oz .... delicious."
"I paid $2.99 for a 24oz bottle. This was a bargain."
"Overall, I think I enjoyed this one a little better than the other harvest series beer I had. I just seemed to stick out a little more against all the other IPAs out there. I paid $5 for a 24 oz of this and I think that this was a great deal. If you can find it around, it is worth a shot. I know I won't have a problem finishing this one up."
"It has a medium body that's easy to swallow and leaves a tingle in the mouth. So smooth and easy to drink, I could definitely drink a few."
"Drinkability: Good for a pale, ABV feels a bit higher than 6.2, but the freshness makes this a good beer year round."
"Poured a very nice clear amber color with the head forming easily. With the nice head aroma was easy to detect and was nice and refreshing. Bitter citrus notes were easy to detect. The taste was good nothing amazing to me, for some reason I felt this particular brew's hops just did not float my boat. Still the taste was very good with a citrusy and very bitter taste. The malt helped a little sitting in the background but I felt I should of made a bigger appearance. Brew was nice and light though and I would really enjoy drinking this on a hot summer day."
"From a 24 ounce bottle and into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed golden amber color with an inch of creamy bone white head. A thin lace is left behind on my glass with each sip. Notes of grapefruit peel, lemon, some pine, sweet malt, earthy bitter hops, lots of pine here and slightly spicy. Finish is dry with ample carbonation. Good stuff."
"For a beer with this much hop presence, the drinkability is amazing. It goes down so easy, that you could easily drink too many. I think thats a good thing!"
"D- one bottle should do.. after that could get repetive"
"Drinkability: Pretty certain this is my first ever wet hopped beer and I must say I am a fan. Captures the flavor of the hop without getting overly obnoxious."
"Over all an above average IPA. A bit too biter though to make it a really great beer. Was hoping for a little sweetness, citrus, or pine flavors to balance it out. Still pretty good for only 3.50 a bomber"
"4 love this stuff and yet it doesn't stick in my mind the way bigfoot does, and think that's because it's too easy to drink quickly. it doesn't force you to savor. kind of a high-class slut."
"M/D: I was surprised that this brew wasn't more bitter and drying. It was really smooth with some hitter mouth later on that is not really bothersome. The drinkability is good for sipping slowly and savoring."
"D: Flavorful, balanced and very drinkable. ABV not high but still very well disguised...you'll need to be careful."
"D- very drinkable, a very clean finish that makes you always happy to have another sip. I will look for this one again when it comes fresh as I can get it in Colorado"
"I'll be this was much better fresh - I'd rather drink a Torpedo IPA. Not that it was bad, I'd just prefer a more pronounced hop flavor."
"D: Goes down very easy. I would like to buy this beer again."
"M&D: very soothing and light on the carbonation on top of a hoppy flavour and good level of bitterness, guaranteeing that the richly flavoured hoppy palate treads rather light. The relatively clean texture and medium-light body complements the flavour really well, making it in every sense a quaffable type of IPA to me. All in all, this fresh hop ale is very delicious as well as decently balanced (after some time into the tasting, that is), and I have nothing to complain about this beer except for the price - maybe it's time Sierra Nevada finds a permanent importer in the UK?"
"Serving type: bottle"
"After finishing the bottle, I continued to be puzzled by how subtle the flavors were in this brew. Very drinkable, but it slips almost apologetically by the palate, like it's afraid of drawing attention to itself."
"D - This beer is quite interesting. Good aroma and flavor but its a potent beer for sure. Its flavor doesn't not lend well to mass consumption. Drink it slow."
"Nice inch and a half head from a slow pour into a pint glass. Amber color, clear but their is some fine particles suspended. Malty smell, mixed with a good hop aroma of pine and citrus, sweet smelling. Mouthfeel is smooth with a lot of carbonation. The malt and hop bitterness are present right away in the flavor and both hold equally strong as the taste fades. The hops linger on, sweet and fruity. Leaves a little warming in the mouth."
"Drinkability was very good. Nice balance of flavors and could have a few of these back to back very easily."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange-amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes into a solid inch of foam. Rings of lacing stick to the sides of the glass until the beer is gone. The aroma is of full of floral and herbal hops with a hint of grapefruit underneath. The taste is a lot like the aroma. It is very floral with a nice lingering dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a tasty beer that I will certainly drink again."
"24 oz. bottle. Copper pour with a large, chunky, pillow of a head that lasted the entire length of the drink. The smell was great. Pine hops dominate the aroma, with a balancing act of sweet malts. The flavor is similar; well balanced with a slight peppery kick and great hop taste without being bitter at all."
"The name of this beer was interesting and curious. The foam was light wheat in color, a little thick and lacey. The color was an amber orange and some red highlights in the light behind it. The smell was dark, rich and complex. The taste had a deep hops flavour, rich, a little flowery and a hint of wood. I thought the mouthfeel was smooth and complex - great!"
"I poured it from the bomber to a pint glass. yellow-orange in color. thick white head, took forever to go away. left lace all over the glass. hops, malt, citrus, and slight caramel aroma. all the hops you expect from s.n. and just an overall delicious beer. creamy and acidic mouthfeel. I would almost consider this a session beer. I usually do not put beers away fast but, I could'nt help myself with this one. really good stuff."
"laces the glass heavily, the fluffy head remains to the last sip -tastes real good - hops up front , balanced by the bready malt and yeast(i guess) - pretty complex in flavor as it flows over the tongue - carbonation and finish seem right - each sip wants another - i haven't seen this on the shelves since the last one i had a couple of years ago, and am glad to have it again - tasty stuff that goes down real easy - i'm curious about other vintages.."
"Overall: Decent drinkability, not a lot of hop character. The flavors are good up front but end with an unfavorable bitter soapy taste. The smell is pretty bland, with a slight spiciness but mostly sweet caramel."
"Overall - This is a great beer. It is superbly balanced with an enjoyable hop profile. It does have a bit of a vegetal (raw) component, but that adds to the character."
"Yet another very tasty offering from the guys at Sierra Nevada. I'll seek this one out again, especially at this great price."
"D: another winner from Sierra Nevada and hop lovers will get plenty out of this, as well as the malt mongers. Tasty brew!"
"D- Very sessionable even with 6.7 ABV. Great balance in a nicely crafted ale. Recommend trying!"
"D: Going to finish the 24oz bottle, and that would be about all I could manage."
"Overall an interesting brew. I am not overly impressed with the flavor or aroma but the mouth feel is great."
"A different beer with lots of unusual hoppy flavours. But the strange mouthfeel ruins much of the experience."
"The sharp aftertaste is the only thing that seems out of place. Quite an enjoyable brew."
"This beer is freakin' incredible. The smell is really good, but is a weak indication of how great the beer tastes. As much as I love the hoppy flavor, it would be hard to drink too many of these because after a while, I would need a break from the dominant hop (however awesome it is)."
"Nice carbonation, a bit sweet and oily from the fresh hopping. A smooth and easy drinking beer that I look forward to trying again next year. Thank You SN for focusing so strongly on quality even as you expand as a company."
"Overall: A tad sweeter than I remember, but a phenomenal beer."
"D - Nicely drinkable IPA, with flavorful fresh hops."
"Taste-Bold hops up front layered with piney citrus orange rind and slight malty, spicy sweetness. Well balanced and tasty hops throughout. Very drinkable and likeable American IPA"
"This is best served slightly chilled from cellar temperature. Refrigerator temperature does not do this justice. It simply masks the malt and makes it less than it should be. I went back to this after warming and it was a completely different experience. Visually much clearer, much more balanced, much better....warm it up."
"Drinkability- so easy drinking and just so enjoyable, really well done, maybe i wonder if bit hoppier bit fresher but still really nice now with some time, a really great beer thats i thoroughly enjoyed drinking spot on and enjoyed just as much as if not more as my previous review"
"Poured into my Sierra Nevada pint glass. Hazy orange liquid with large bubbles leading up to a splotchy thin cap. Great lacing though, thick and sticky. Smell is disappointing. Doughy malt essence countered by slight alcohol. Taste is better. Sharp orange rind bitterness. Pine. Boozy ether smashes any attempt at this thing being balanced. Mouthfeel is great, dry and refreshing. I found this to be an enjoyable and drinkable brew."
"D: This beer could be quasi-sessionable. As it is, the 24oz. bottle suits me perfectly--two servings of this should be a decent start off to any night."
"really good example of the style. not as dry as a really bitter IPA. very good, balanced and flavorful."
"Poured slowly from a large bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden amber with a moderate head which thins, but never really goes away. Smells strongly of hops as expected. The taste is strong hops all the way through, but surprisingly balanced. As it warms the malt character comes through more, but the hops are always strong and right up front. As far as drinkability goes they got it right on the money, a two serving bottle is just what you'd want."
"This is my first ""wet hops"" drink and apparently SN made the first ever American beer brewed with wet hops so they know what they are doing. YUM."
"coming from sierra nevada i expected this brew to be very good and they didnt disappoint its a lot like i expected it to be, it really hit the spot for my hop craving."
"Pours an amber brown color, big yellow-white head, foamy. Consistent color in the body. Hoppy aroma, acidic, some grapefruit, but mostly acidic, piney. Piney, somewhat hoppy taste. A little bitter aftertaste, but mostly balanced. Not too bad, IPAish, but balanced."
"Bitterness is pretty high, while hop flavor is moderate. There are tons of caramely sweet and toasty malts to offset the high lupulin content. Alcohol is slightly noticeable and about right for nearly 7%, carbonation is moderately high and helps scrub the palate a bit on the finish. Definitely a good beer, but all the hoppy Sierra Nevada offerings are becoming difficult to distinguish from one another, but this one seems a bit maltier than most."
"Taste is a little dryer than other offerings but is very very drinkable. Citrus and hops every where and I like that. That in turn makes this beer very drinkable. The slightly larger bottle help one enjoy the beer a little longer."
"Drinkability: A delightful beer. Although it's definitely on the hoppy side, it still feels very balanced. It has definitely not the most complex taste out there, but still it is a really refreshing blend of tropical fruits, earthy hop resins and restrained sweet malts. And although the hops really dominates, they never get too aggressive or overpowering. It's a laid back beer, yet it's full of character - somehow, I can't stop thinking of it as a Celebration Ale in harmony. Highly recommended."
"Overall, one of the best IPA's I've had."
"D: Average."
"This is a very drinkable beer and at the price they are asking it's easy to justify spending a weekend with this one. Now if we could get Sierra Nevada to brew this year around!"
"D- I think this would be a good beer, day or night. Good flavor, good balance, not unreasonably high abv. I could drink this all day."
"Mouthfeel is lively but not too carbonated, medium-full body. Very nice."
"4.7/5"
"This is one of the better beers I've had in a while, I look forward to many more chances in which to support an old friend."
"For a gauge, I find this IPA to actually be more mellow than their Celebration Ale. An excellent beer nonetheless, very full tasting without being overpowering."
"D: Hops straight from Yakima which is cool. I would use this beer as a gateway for people that have not tried a lot of hoppy beers. Great beer without blasting the taste buds too much. Quite enjoyable and quite drinkable especially while jamming Goatsnake's Flower of Disease."
"Pours a cloudy copper color with a frothy cream colored two finger head. The lacing stays forever. Smell is citrusy hops. Taste is more of the same grape fruity hops with bitter finish and a creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, but after the full 24 oz. I am left reaching for something maltier for some balance."
"Recommended to craft beer lovers and hop fans, both far and near."
"Update, 02/07/09 this 12th release is in the American IPA catagory the 11th release of the same beer was in the APA catagory."
"Mouthfeel is silky and medium bodied. Drinkability is pretty awesome. Great IPA!"
"Poured from a 24oz bottle, two fingers of a nice thick off-white foam. Rings of lacing stick throughout the glass. Dark copper/nearly red through the center. The aroma is not as strong as I was expecting but the smells that are there are sweet with a citrus back. Great tasting ale with a nice malt start and then a progression of hop flavors, leafy then citrus hop. The feel is very nice, creamy then with a nice tingly finish. Very drinkable, a lot of nice flavors and alcohol is hidden well."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good...the alcohol doesn't really get out of control here. Fairly smooth MF also makes this a quaffable beer. Overall though, I'm not really blown away. This is a nice solid IPA, but I prefer a lot more citrus. Always nice to get that fresh hop flavor and feel though, but I'll probably just stick with High Tide if push comes to shove."
"good, but really the only thing that distinguishes this from other good APA's is the freshness of the hops. get this one as fresh as you can."
"I love the bomber as much as anyone, but 24oz. is a lot of this very potent beer. The first half was drinkable, but there was definitely some diminishing returns."
"D - I could knock out a couple of the 24oz. in one sitting."
"solid flavor. Pine is dominant, followed by a citrus burst and covered with subtle spices. Sharp bite at first, then slowly gives way to a buttery feel and sweetish finish. As it warms, the sharpness is rounded out and it settles down. Overall a solid brew"
"Very drinkable, very good. Tastes like their Pale Ale with a bit more confidence. Probably my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada."
"One more reason for me to love autumn."
"D - If you love hops, this bomber will go quickly, but luckily there's plenty out there. One of their best...it's this and Bigfoot for me."
"Again, I am really suspicious that the beer is not fresh, had a rough journey to me, or whatever, that affected the overall quality. THIS beer is not bad, but certainly nothing great."
"Pours a nice red color with a great thick tan head. Leaves good lacing down the side of my glass. Smells like hops of course, with some pine notes. Tastes very similar, but starts off kind of malty, then the hops kick in. The only real qualm I have with this beer is the same that I have with the other SN beers I have tried: it finishes a bit harsh. Just a bit past bitter to harsh. Its a smooth drink at first until the finish. Other than that small problem, its very good, I will definitely be buying this again."
"Poured from a 24oz bomber into a pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy amber color with a big off white head. Smells strongly of hops, citrus and sweet malt. Tastes of hops upfront, spicy, citrus, and sweet malt. This beer is medium bodied, very smooth and very drinkable."
"D: Attention Hopheads! Great beer here! Wet hoppy goodness!"
"Drinkability: Dang! I love this one. The 12th release is certainly one of the best and I'm certainly going to pick up several more before they dissapear. Did I mention that the balance was incredible? Whatever dry hops and constant infusion has to offer, wet hops yields something quite different to the palate. Spicy notes abound and at 6.7%, is quite open to more than one in an evening. I'd seek this one out as both a great beer and a great value."
"D - Defintely a top-notch brew. This is wonderfully complex and I love the uniquely hoppy flavor of the ""wet"" hops, but this isn't totally wowing me though. I keep thinking that this seems ""British"" in origin in some way."
"M/D: smooth and crisp. Definitely sessionable. Alcohol is not a big part of this beer's effect, and the clean finish is refreshing."
"Great value for the money, which for me was approx $4/bottle."
"Keep in mind this beer has been around for about three months and I just bought one this week. Pours clear copper with a huge fluffy creamy head. Plentiful lacings. Piney hop aroma. Taste is medium bitter citrus hops. More orange pinapple than grapefruit. Good amount of sweet malt backing. It might be I've had too many hoppy beers this evening but for me this was closer to an APA than the IPA style. Excellent beer, well balanced. Session wise it is a bit high an abv for an all nighter."
"D: Well, I got the last one at the bar, but was wanting more and more of this excellent brew!"
"Very drinkable and will spend the rest of the evening slowly enjoying this little monster of an IPA."
"A very nice fresh hop IPA from Sierra Nevada. This beer drinks cleanly and easily. It isn't quite as good as what I remember from past editions, but I confuse the various SN Harvest beers. I think that I might like the Southern Hemisphere version best, but I imagine that I can't exactly try them on equal footing against each other because freshness is such a huge factor. Anywho, this beer is on the darker end of IPAs. I have no idea how well it fulfills strict IPA specifications (it could easily pass for an Amber), but I really like the color. The beer has a great hop profile. It's delicate and piney. The malt actually tastes similar to a Dogfish Head beer, sweet caramel that saps most of the bitterness right out of the hops. It has a full feel, almost syrupy for the abv. This IPA is delicate and unique. I sort of see all of these SN Harvest Ales as interesting and delicious shades of the ubiquitous Pale Ale."
"Nice crisp, spicy hoppy bite with the first taste. Also some pine and sweetness. Goes down real smooth. Like drinking sunlight."
"D= This was a very good, very sessionable beer. I liked it way better than the SN Chico Estate Harvest Ale and not nearly as well as the SN Southern Hemisphere Harvest Ale. I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience fresh hops in all their Sierra Nevada glory."
"Overall a really great beer from Sierra Nevada. Hoppy, but still a smooth beer."
"D - This beer might be past it's prime as the malts are starting to overpower the hops. Still a drinkable beer, I'll gladly finish the 24oz bottle. Could be better."
"A pretty good beer that I will have to try again to see if this was just a bad bottle."
"Very very good drinkability. The finish is fantastic and begs the drinker for another sip. Thoroughly enjoyed this IPA."
"Taste: They weren't lying when they were talking about fresh hops for this one. Slight Granny Smith apple taste, with some tropical fruits thrown in. Yeast and malts aren't too noticeable; just hops, hops, and more hops. The bitterness creeps up on you slowly at first, then bites in the aftertaste. Overall, very refreshing; definitely will wake you up in the mornin'."
"Nice balance. Delicious beer."
"Conclusion: This is a NICE Pale Ale...not what I expected at all, however...with the ""wet hop"" I assumed a more aggressive, in your face hop flavor, but this is quite balanced, and is almost more of a session Pale Ale (despite the abv.) than an IPA IMO."
"Flavor is a wonderful, bountiful mouthful of hoppy goodness. Bitterness is tamed down a bit, which probably aids the high drinkability as well. Spot on, SN. Wonderful brew that I will seek out year after year. Recommend."
"The smells are very hop-like, piney, grapefruit, you know the drill. That being said, I appreciated the balance in the smell. This balance is carried over to the taste. Yeah, the hops bomb you at the beginning but the sweet caramel maltiness carries you through the rest of the experience. You get all of the joy of the hops but are protected from any danger by a malt cacoon. I liked this very much, have typically been anti-SN for no good reason and this beer makes me think I need to re-evaulate my baseless stance against them."
"This beer is a great IPA that I'm going to stock up on while it is still available...I loved it."
"Nice body, and very drinkable. This is a great offering from a great brewery, and it sets itself apart from their usual pale ale/IPA fare with a great earthy hoppiness and real nice balance."
"Pours a clear dark amber with two inches of white head that has good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Even though my bottle has some age on it, it still has a nice aroma of Cascade and Centennial hops. The citrus and pine aromas are quite inviting. The hops are still present in the flavor as well. Citrus flavors combine nicely with the caramel malt. Bitterness is moderate for the style. Has a lingering citrus aftertaste. The body is nothing special however. Feels overcarbonated and lacks a nice texture. Wish I could of gotten this fresh. Still outstanding with high drinkability."
"Just as red-wine connoisseurs have the Burgundy region in France, hop heads have the Chico estate in California. Not only the 'New World's' first brewery to start liberally hoping their beers, Sierra Nevada also claims to be North America's first brewery to ever release a beer with 100% fresh picked 'wet' hops. This means Sierra Nevada not only re-acquainted us with tradition but also introduced us to innovation."
"The 12th Release Harvest pours a light amber with a medium white head. The smell is mainly citrusy hops & yeast. The taste is strong on hops--nice and bitter. There is also a sort of nutty sweetness to it as well. The mouthfeel is light yet grainy. This is a very drinkable IPA. Perhaps the ""wet"" hops make the difference and give it a wonderfully hoppy smell and taste."
"D - I enjoy these wet hop ales, but one bomber is all I really need. This will take care of my hop fix for the evening."
"Really good atmosphere, decent taste, but don't misunderstand. . . I don't mean this in a bad way. Great drinkability in my opinion. However, if you're not into hops you may not have as high of an opinion of this. I am, and this is a great quaff overall, especially if your a hop head."
"About as good as any other fresh hop ale, and the price is very attractice as well. Definitely a nice ale to be looked forward to at harvest time."
"-Oelergud"
"Good stuff"
"D- glad i found this. it really appeals to me because the balance fits my ideal ipa dreamz, and the fresh hops are outer space. puts your ass to sleep too. hop sedation."
"Sierra Nevada 12th Release Harvest Wet Hop Ale is clear, sparkling and copper. The head is huge and fluffy; rocky and bubbly. It has excellent retention and leaves thick lacing on the glass. Incredibly fresh hop aroma. Smells like hops still on the vine. Spicy, sweet, juicy, piny-- yum! It is medium bodied, a little oily and quite smooth. The finish is pretty crisp. It is a well balanced flavor. The hops are full and juicy and backed up nicely by a big malt body. It is a little peppery. It's mostly a big grapefruit peel and pine flavor. It tastes very fresh. Well crafted! I'm glad I can get two glasses out of this bottle!"
"From a 24 oz bottle purchased locally. Aroma is full of American hops, piney spicy and citrus. Color is an orange amber, very clear with a khaki colored head. Flavor is forward on the hop flavor with caramel and toasty malt coming through. Bitterness balances well and there is not much sweetness. Clean, dry and easy drinking. I love this beer. Too bad I have to wait till next year to have it again."
"D: With such a sublime combination of flavor and aroma, I'll be sure to stock up on this brew."
"We had planned on having a taste-off, sampling all three of Sierra's Harvest brews: The Chico Estate and 12th Release Harvest Wet Hop, and the Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop brews. We were distracted and ultimately derailed by a walk over to Iron Springs Pub & Brewery for fortification. But that's another story. I'm sure we'll get back to our experiment at some point. Anything for science!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"I've never had a wet hop before so I wasn't sure what to expect, needless to say, I like it."
"Overall not bad; malt is a little weak, but hops are flavorful without being obnoxious. I had no problem finishing it and could've easily done another."
"Coppery amber with a minimal light tan head, sticky lace that leaves rings down the glass. Nose is very floral hoppy, pine, grapefruit, but not all that powerful. Taste is kick ass and gets better as it warms. A fresh and tasty hop bomb that isn't overpowering with alcohol heat and doesn't neccesarily need to be sipped. Decent malty backbone balances perfectly. Medium slick/salty mouthfeel. A treat to drink and impressive, by far the best $5.00 24OZ. beer that I've ever had, delicious."
"D - Phenomenal brew by a pioneer in the realm of American craft brewing. The beer is nuanced and makes great use of the fresh hops in the overall flavor and I truly appreciate the utilization of the fresh earthly humulus lupus. This ale went great with my Chicken parm!"
"A nice surprise to find this on the shelf at BevMo. Pours clear copper with a standard white head, no different than their pale ale. Big, wet hops in the nose. Tons of resin and pine draw you in. Clean and crisp mouthfeel without too much carbonation. A hop party in the taste. Resin, grapefruit, oranges, and pine are balanced perfectly with the malt back. Drinks like an IPA with the hop profile and taste of an IIPA. Outstanding."
"This was an excellent beer from an excellent brewery. The aroma was huge with hops and citrusy goodness. Appearance was light copper and a tan head that laced nicely. Flavor exploded with fresh, green hops and a strong caramel backbone. Delicious. The mouthfeel was full and rich with a nice scrubbing carbonation that leaves the tongue wanting more. Overall this beer is great. I would happily drink it everyday!"
"Man I love the fresh hop ales,I should have bought this when more fresh.Poured into a standard pint glass a rich clear copper/bronze with a large fluffy two finger slight off white head atop.Aromas of pine and caramel mainly with a bit of citrus and biscuit as well.Flavors are spicey like the label claimed,the hops are not overpowering but are the dominant flavor with a full caramel base.A little thin but not overly so,I very nice brew I liked the spiciness going on there,well done."
"Overall this is going to be one of my go to beers on a crafty night. I'd reccommend this to anyone who loves hops but is in the mood for something besides in your face knock you on your butt hops kick while still giving you your hops fix for the night"
"Aroma is sweet malt and pine hops. Beautiful head and golden red apperarance. Flavor... hmm, not as balanced as I would like, and the hops are a bit 'harsh' or maybe resinous is a better word. Almost like sucking a pine cone. This could be better with a nice balance, I think. Goes down alright, though I do not really want to have multiple pints of it."
"The feel is strangely bubbly and fizzy with a bite on the way down. Though this beer is really bitter, it's beautifully balanced. A superior Harvest/IPA. Dynamite in a glass."
"D - Very easy drinker. 24 oz felt more like 12. Well balanced and approachable. Another quality effort by SN. Not quite as good as Southern Hemisphere or Chico (my favorite) but still very good."
"Taste - Sweet roasted maltiness and caramel come together to form a solid backbone for a bitter hoppy beer. But unlike other IPAs, the bitterness of this one bites but doesn't destroy the person drinking. In the past I have had IPAs where I needed to eat something with them to make them tolerable, this is not like that at all. SN seems to know what they're doing by keeping such a delicate balance. Grapefruit of course appears on the tongue but it is followed by apricot, mango, and pine needles. This is much like the relief one gets from a sour patch kid once the sweetness hits. Alcohol, at 6.7%, is well hidden by the hops. Oh the joy!! There is still so much beer in this bomber. I refill my glass. Aftertaste starts off bitter but then has a citrusy trailoff. Definately the most complex and delicious IPA I have ever experienced."
"Drinkably: very smooth and easy to drink with the alc 6.7 its also easy to get buzzed"
"D- This was a very very good IPA. Perfect? Na. Damn tasty and incredibly well balanced."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick, frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and Carapils malts along with a fantastic hop nose. It's well balanced and the hops are incredibly fresh. The taste is great. It has a kick ass hop bitterness that's so damn fresh tasting. The malt bill is incredibly balanced adding just the right amount of body and sweetness. It goes down quick and clean and leaves a nice residual hop presence. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one fantastic IPA. What a hop bomb!!"
"Drinkability- Quite nice. Not a great example of the AIPA style, but very drinkable."
"D: I downed about 20 ounces of this in 15 or so minutes. You better watch out with the higher ABV, but this thing is so delicious you'll want to get it down fast. The mouthfeel and wonderful flavor really beckons one to another sip. One of the best beers I've had in the last few months."
"D - It's not a surprise that a beer that tastes this good is extremely drinkable. Only knock is the somewhat high abv, and thick body"
"It is smooth on the palate. Very drinkable. Just wonderful. Thank the Lord for the hop harvest!"
"Love this one. I could seriously drink this beer forever."
"Nice tan pour, dark, for an IPA- almost brown. Big hit of hops upfront in the nose, let's you know this is for people who like hops and bitterness in their beer. Citrus like flavors as well balanced with a nice strucure of malt, almost caramel behind it. Very straighfoward and complex. Clearly with a try if you like this style."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Nothing overly special about it beyond the added pungent nature in the taste, so I'd say it's a really solid ale. Definitely worth drinking. I picked up a bomber of it and after finishing it off, the ABV didn't kick me like I thought it would, so I probably could have drank some more (although, it is Sunday night and work will be calling, so it's probably best that I didn't have more)."
"Amber appearance with reddish highlights. Good frothy head of 2 fingers with great retention. Leaves spotty lacing down the entire glass with a full cap of foam. Not overpowering in the aroma department - a very clean citrus hoppy smell with a slight hint of alcohol. Tastes as clean as it smells - bittering hops in perfect proportion and a wisp of warming alcohol - nicely done. Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. The ultimate in drinkability - this beer just flew out of my glass. The first Sierra to really impress me - the Pale Ale and Celebration Ale are good beers but this is a cut above."
"Overall: Probably my favorite Sierra Nevada brew of all time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the original stuff. It's even better!"
"Drinkability: I have always been a fan of Sierra Nevada brews and this one is no exception. I love the Southern Hemi Harvest, but this one is even better IMO. Far exceeded my already lofty expectations and quite a steal at $5 for a bomber."
"Drinkability: I think we have a winner. The classic harvest ale (and, surprisingly, the last of the three from SN that I tried) xnd still deserving of the crown, in my opinion. No problems with alcohol level, either - just a damn tasty, complex, drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 24oz. bottle into 20oz. Guinness glass. Towering cream colored head leaves behind some quality lace. Superb bronze color with a transparent appearance, Towards the end of the glass I am able to spot a very tiny amount of sediment. Smell is mostly of fresh floral hops, Some pine, citrus fruits with a slight sour dough aroma. Taste is superb. Slightly numbing hop bitterness at first then some sweet malt finishing with a nice dry hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is also quite nice leaving a slightly creamy aftertaste with a dry finish. Drinkability seems quite good due to the good balance. Overall, This is a great beer which is widely available and well worth a try. Highly recommended!"
"be nice to find this on tap. oh well, i'll just have to settle for a case or so's worth..."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but I just can't drink the same beer all night unless I'm just out drinking with the guys getting drunk."
"A wonderful example of a well-balanced beer. Nothing to be bored about in this bottle and yet nothing to fear. Absolutely bursting with hop flavor without the often-characteristic acid-burn of many other American IPAs."
"A delicious, subtly made ale. Excellent."
"D - Dare I say that this beer smokes regular SNPA? Yes, I do. It's got it where it counts in all categories, and it's a breeze to continue sipping without stop; full of flavor and character. Well done, Sierra Nevada!"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a nice copper with a fluffy two finger head that leaves nice thick lace. Smell is pine, sweet nectar and a bit of honey. Taste is sweet up front with a bit of lemon zest, followed by a hop bitterness towards the back of the tongue, very smooth and not to bitter. Finishes off with a slite slick feel to it. Overall this is one I have been waiting for, impressive offering."
" Very drinkable stuff. I wish I could get more."
"Drinkability. A 22oz bottle is plenty to drink of this stuff."
"Not really something I care for. Not balanced at all. It's pretty harsh in it's bitterness and metallic sting. I'm gonna have a hard time finishing this bottle."
"Ordered a pitcher about a month ago at Bar Coastal UES(NYC) and now drinking a pint poured from a chubby bomber. Similar taste from bottle as from tap. Pours a deep amber and smell is sweeter than the taste. Taste is smooth with malty overtones while not too much hop bite. Very drinkable and could be a session beer for those looking for flavor without the high alcohol content."
"D - Nicely refreshing in its own way, just not the mouthful I had expected."
"I poured from a 24 ounce bomber into SA pint glasses. The beer is a pretty shade of amber with an abundant sticky head. The lacing is everywhere. The smell is of a pine forest. The beer heavy on pine resins with a lingering dry finish. It is a medium bodied beer that has a sicky mouthfeel, due to the abundance of fresh hops. This taste like a DIPA with the ABV of an IPA. A very good beer."
"I love it sloppy wet. A picturesque head sit creamy white atop burnt amber body. Aroma is heavy hop pellet at first, them dissapates to SN Pale Ale on the juice. Chewy toffee base provides green light for fresh green hops. For a moment the body goes burnt caramel amber, then hopsback to Imperial IPA without the malt support. Citrus, floral, pine, spice...the hops provide several characteristic notes. A numbing, bitter oil sparks attention on the recede and leaves a note of chlorophyll and sour, waxy leaf. I dig, keet it coming."
"Orange caramel hue with two finger milky head that clings to create a fine lacing. A mild scent of pine, hops, and a light maple syrup. Upon taste, the palate is bombarded with a whole lotta hops and you can bet your a$$ they're wet and sloppy. It's hop attack the whole way complimented by slight floral notes through the drink with a chewy bread aftertaste. A serene mouthfeel where carbonation takes a back-seat to flavor the way a great IPA should be. Pleasantly drinkable with an amiable personality that could compliment a wide variety of foods. Worthy of being mentioned as one of the best IPA's. I cast my ballot."
"D- A very nice and balanced highly drinkable pale ale."
"Pours a surprisingly rich reddish hue for the style. The head is THICK and foamy and looks simply delicious. I really can't remember the last time I saw a brew that looked so tempting. Smell is rather sweet. Grapefruit. Very citrusy. The first few tastes have some bite, but as it warms up it mellows out a little bit. At 6.7 this one might sneak up on you if you take the bomber to quick! Solid."
"Drinkability - Great drinkability but definitely not a session beer. 24 oz will be plenty for me...for tonight. Wish I could find this a little bit farther uptown..."
"from a bomber, this was a deep amber with nice clarity, just a touch of chill haze. the head was really nice-off-white to almost tan, creamy, thick, and lasting. piney, spicy, grapefruity hops dominate the caramel malt base both in aroma and taste. the spiciness is tough to pin down, almost tobacco-like and peppery. well carbonated, has a nice prickly, frothy mouthfeel. medium-bodied with a long complex finish of spicy hops."
"D- Very drinkable and nice."
"An expose on hop fundamentals. But, not much more to make me come back for more."
"D-Good drinkability. This beer wonderfully featured the fresh hoppiness to create an overall quite enjoyable brew."
"The closest thing to this beer I've tried in the harvest category is the Chelsea Catskill Hop Harvest, and it doesn't even hold a candle to this puppy. I'm not real schooled in Sierra Nevada's offerings, but now I want to be."
"Cheers!!!"
"This is a solid beer."
"Poured slightly vigorously into a pint glass. Good looking head with retention. Thick lacing on the glass. Good amber color. Huge nose, fresh fresh hops with no hint of alcohol. Taste is hoppy hoppy hoppy but not in an extreme IPA way. Not too bitter, not exciting my acid reflux. Like shoving a fresh ale-soaked hop cone in my mouth. Carbonation level is spot-on. Aftertaste lingers piney/evergreen. I love it and I want to keep drinking it."
"Nick"
"Really good stuff. I'll be sure to grab a few more 24 oz. bombers from the outstanding Neil St. Piccadilly, which did well by stocking up on this gem. Well done yet again, Sierra Nevada."
"A fruity floral fragrance hits the olfactory apparatus, upon pouring from the bottle. The visuals are a pleasant foamy head, just off-white in color, and a dark copper coloration to the liquid beneath. The head is thick, sticky almost, and tasty. The fruity hints in the aroma are also present upon tasting. There is a somewhat slight metallic after taste that sticks on the posterior of the tongue. Overall, a better than average ale. Seek out and enjoy one!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice amount of frothy head that lasts and lasts. Color is mostly copper, slightly orange. The nose is mostly hops, no surprises there. The taste is also hoppy. Pine hops prevail, it's a just a little citrusy and oily. Good amounts of hoppiness here. It's not overly hoppy. Bready malts, just a little sweet, play in the background. The finish is a little bitter. I'm no hop head, but I enjoyed this. You probably will too. Highly drinkable, highly recommended."
"This was my first try of the Sierra nevada Harvest series. Excellent beer for you hop lovers out there. Beautiful copper color and a nice citrusy/ piney aroma. there is also a good malt character to this brew. I was expecting an overwhelming hop sensation but this beer is quite well balanced. Cant wait to try the other harvest ales."
"Poured an amber copper color into a pint glass with off white head, It smelled wonderful to me, lots of citrus and pine, nice grapefruit. The carbonation was nice and It tasted of the most fresh hops that I have ever had in an IPA, well I dont drink that many. Very hoppy citrus flavor well balanced. Mouth feel was right in the middle, I could drink this all night, wasnt overly hoppy like most i have tried. Overall for an IPA this is the best I have had."
"the taste was soft and hoppy. almost a slippery taste, leaves quite a hoppy lingering aftertaste, but wasn't too bad. soft on the palate. For some reason I expected a little bit more from SN and this harvest ale."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with good carbonation. I was not overly impressed by this ale."
"I know I am in the minority, but this ranks as a major disappointment for me."
"D: Again scores very well, a decent cost a decent abv leaves this being a solid offering from the folks at Sierra Nevada."
"Pours a orange amber color with a thick off white head that stays until the end and laces nicely. Smells of sweet hops. Tastes of very sweet malts and citrus hops. Goes down very smooth, with no hop bite. Mouthfeel is good, slight bitterness towards the end. Drinkability is decent, couldn't have more than a 24 oz."
"D - Overall this is a step below greatness but still a fantastic beer that any fan of hops should try without hesitation. I'm starting to dig this wet hop thing, though I feel SN's ""Chico..."" is a better brew. No problems getting through my 24 oz of this though, even after it's warmed a bit."
"Medium body, great carbonation and a crisp clean aftertaste. Hops rule the show and do so very well."
"Buy it. Immediately."
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink, I have enjoyed the wet hop ales very much. I may score this slightly higher based on my personal preference, but still a great brew most will enjoy,"
"Very drinkable at 6.7% abv. Another solid brew from SN"
"D: This is a mighty fine brew... not quite Celebration level, but quite drinkable on a Saturday afternoon spent stirring a brew kettle."
"M = Meiudm bodied, very good mouthcoating, foamy creamy feel."
"This one pours a dark amber with a full off white head. The smells start invading your nose the second you open the bottle. Very intense hop smell with citrus and pine notes, and some sweet notes as well. A very inviting beer. The taste is layered starting off somewhat sweet then quickly moving into an amazing hop flavor with obvious citrus flavors. No real bitter finish, just a long lasting hop aftertaste. A nice mouthfeel, good carbonation, everything there is done very well. This is an easy drinker, I am going to have to go get more. Great beer, recommended for everyone especially any hop heads out there!"
"Fresh hops are soooo amazing! It makes this beer absolutely incredible and unique. I wish all IPA were fresh hopped..."
"Overall, a very nice fresh hop ale."
"I love wet hopped beers, and this is no exception. Good hop build, and great balance. Definitely worth picking up."
"D: Hells yeah I can drink plenty more of this. Plus with 24 oz bottles, who can complain?"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable if you can find it. Wish they had this on tap, wish they could make a six pack. I would make this a regular, but it is hard to find. A great brew, definitely try it!"
"Seems a little bit thin on the palate, but that is the only negative thing I have to say about this brew"
"With mad hoppiness, great taste, a superb heavy-medium body and a sizzle of fine carbonation, I'll be adding the 13th Release of Harvest Wet Hop Ale to my list of beers I'm anxiously awaiting. Super-drinkable like just about everything else Sierra Nevada offers. Awesome brew."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable, well constructed beer. Not exactly what I expected, but good nonetheless."
"Tasted on 11/10/08."
"Pretty good; I would recommend this."
"Again, pretty. Again giant head. Nice grapefruit rind bitterness."
"Sierra Nevada 12th Release Harvest Wet Hop Ale pours a clear copper color with an off white head from a brown twenty four ounce bottle. The aroma is hoppy, morstly citrusy but also a bit pine like. The flavor seems the opposite, more pine like hop than citrus. There's a solid malt presence in the background, but the hops are the star of this show. Recommended."
"This is really a great Ale in every single way. Pours a nice coppery color with a tremendous head that lasts to the end of your glass. My 1st glass I was almost to the bottom and still had a 1/8 layer on top. I would say this is a very full bodied hearty Ale, that has a nice hoppy bite, but also has a lot more going on. Very nicely balanced between the malt and hops. I'm a hop head, and this easily satisfies my cravings, and IMO the best I've had from SN. I would love to see this one available year round, it's a great winter brew without the quirky spicing, and would be just as easy to drink in the summer."
"Cheers!"
"As a side note, their Celebration Ale this season seems to also be maltier than last years, and in my opinion, this years is probably the best one they have ever done."
"D: This is a bit of a wildcard beer with the raw smell and taste and big balloon of bitterness, but I like it and suggest others with a love of hops would, too."
"Very drinkable - good balance between malt and hops."
"A hop blitz when I first sipped it, with a good smoothness and some creaminess that goes down easy with predominant citric hop notes and some sweet malts like caramel and/or honey in there. A refreshing beer with a dry backbite mixing hops and maybe some roasted malts. While a very good beer that I enjoyed thoroughly, it is very similiar to regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and is worth a try only."
"Pours clear, copper with medium-dense head of beige bubbles. Little lacing. Hoppy, full-bodied flavor, but not floral. Some sweet maltiness. My only qualm is with a bit of a sharp bite and some cereal flavor. Similar to their pale ale in taste, but much more robust and flavorful."
"D- The elements keep it interesting, but the carbonation made me feel a bit bloated."
"I grabbed a bomber of this while visiting a friend in Austin, Texas. This beer pours a medium copper, with a copius amount of foamy white head, with lots of lacing. The aroma is of citrus and pine hops, with a slight sweet malt presence. The taste has a moderate pine hop bite, and a smooth malt backbone, quite balanced. There is a mild carbonation, with no noticeable warming. This is very easy to drink, a decent offering from this brewery."
"I've come to love wet hop ales. The juicy oily fresh flavor and the slipper, slick mouth feel are fantastic. This is, as expected, a tasty example of a style I love."
"The appearance is a reddish copper with an off white head, excellent lacing. The aroma is hops, a little grassy/citrus/flower, very good smell. The initial taste is smooth with the bitters hitting later and building flavor on the back of the tongue that is very good almost chewy. For any HopHead this would be an excellent beer."
"Poured amber with an off white head that disipated. Nose is very nice, the fresh (wet) hops really give it a different aroma with a nice malt backbone. Taste is of caramel malt, but the hops seem to be very subtle compared to a dry hopped beer, nice hop flavor with a tad bit of bitterness at the the end. Definatly a beer I could have a few of, and one of the better SN beers I have ever had. Smelled and tasted GREAT"
"This is really an enjoyable IPA. I'm loving all of SN's special brews."
"Medium bodied, smooth and easy tro drink. Hops are a bit subdued compared to some American IPAs but there is still plenty for the hop heads in a nicely balanced version. Well worth a try if you like IPAs."
"Pours copper with frothy off-white head. Aroma is bitter and flowery, very herbal, with a pale malt backbone. Flavor is light with hints of chocolate, caramel, and vanilla malt and a flowery, herbal finish. Not much bitterness. Palate is extremely smooth and full, with minimal stickiness. Pretty good."
"This is much more subtle than I was expecting from SA, but I like it alot. Good to see some sanity coming from the West Coast. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable IPA that may confuse some hopheads due to the high malt/sweet notes."
"Overall: A fantastic brew! I'm glad I picked up two and good thing I ordered 4 cases at work also since we're down to our last case. I'm not a big hop fan but this one is really making me reconsider."
"D- The price is right for the beer that you get! Nothing especially crazy about this beer, its got a cool bottle/label, and passes for a better than normal beer but I dont see myself going out of the way to buy it again."
"Drinkability - Pretty good drinkability here, the fade into roasted malt produces a pleasant aftertaste."
"Had this on tap at Fatheads, too. The bottle holds up real well to the draft version. Well worth seeking out. WELL worth it."
"Drinkability- Good, fairly intense. More then one in a sitting would take away from its appeal."
"D- I could think all year long if only it was available."
"A good brew with an overly firm carbonation that surrenders a bit in the end. The weakest of the three fresh hop Harvests from Sierra in my opinion, yet still a nice brew."
"Poured from a 24oz bottle into a pint glass. Clear and caramel colored with a large, long-lasting tan head with lots of lacing. Smell is a good balance of malt and hops, but not very strong. Taste is malty and sweet with a smooth hoppy finish. Smooth and easy drinking overall. A good beer, but nothing too outstanding."
"Pours a reddish amber with a thin creamy tan head that lingers a bit. Has that pine and citrusy hops smell I've come to appreciate. Tastes of an earthy bitterness, not as piney as I would have thought. The bitterness really doesn't detract from the drinkability, and finishes crisp. My only other basis for comparison right now with regards to the wet-hopping is the latest Harpoon 100 Barrel series (#24), and this one has more of a traditional IPA taste to it. Overall, a very solid beer from SN. It isn't quite the favorite for me than it seems to be for some people, but it is a clean, well-executed example of the style. The IPA mood doesn't strike me too often, but I would come back to this again should it strike."
"Probably my favorite of these special releases from Sierra Nevada."
"I really enjoyed this beer, the malt and hops are really dancing in unison. Drank it slow and enjoyed every second of it. Great job by Ken, I will certainly be picking up some more of these."
"o:very drinkable. excellent hop flavor. sierra nevada has very non-astringent bittering that must be from their water. this is less bitter and more drinkable than the chico to me(on tap at falling rock)"
"Pours a brownish color with a creamy tan head. Nose is more the line of an English Pale in the sense that the malts definately over power the hops. Taste has a bit more hops, but still a bit weak. Well balanced though. The medium body is well carbonated. A nice beer, just not what I look for in the style."
"Thanks to SkinnyElvis for this Halloween '08 treat!"
"D. A damn fine beer. Tasty and quaffable. Clean and well executed. Layers of hop goodness. Recommended."
" ad"
"D - Drinkable and food friendly given the hops don't whack you over the head. I'll be sipping this while the Trick or Treaters bang down our door. Yum."
"A good beer, overall."
"D- I will definitely have this one again. It's a beer to be drunk slowly and savored."
"D - I'm glad these come in a 24oz. Good thing I bought two :)"
"I don't know if I just didn't have enough to eat yesterday or what, but three of these laid me out flat. They went down smooth enough, but just like their Anniversary and Celebration ales there's just some Sierra Nevada does to their beers that make them give me wicked hangovers."
"I have had the pleasure of tasting all of SN's Harvest Ales this year and they are all excellent. These guys really know how to do wet-hopped ales. I honestly could not pick a favorite."
"10-15-08 review moved to appropriate location."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It's a very refreshing and interesting IPA. Plus I have to say, in my experiences I'm a huge fan of wet hops."
"D: After much thought and consideration , I must say....This is the new Grand-Poobah of Sierra Nevada."
"NOTE: I had bought and reviewed a bottle before this. It was not very good at all. It had a grassy and green apple flavor. I'm a big Sierra Nevada fan so I wanted to review it again and I was glad I did. The second one was just what I expected. Outstanding."
"Drinkability: tasty brew, very fresh with good hop citrus flavor, refreshing, very drinkable, would definitely drink again."
"A nice reddish orange color with a creamy head that is about a finger or so thick. Head leaves an off white thickness that retains for a few short minutes with a lasting amount of lacing. Nose is very fresh and hoppy with a distinctive hoppiness. Taste is also fresh with spicy hops and a slight resinous taste from the fresh hops; almost like fresh cut glass. A slight malt backbone holds the beer together well. Goes down quick even after the 24oz."
"Very nice. Highly drinkable and incredibly satisfying to this hop-lover. Most impressive is the tight balance given so much wonderful hop. In fact, this is the same kind of tantalizing balance Bigfoot has. I love Sierra Nevada."
"D: A good brew, but down on the SN pecking order. A decent session brew for its lighter than average flavor and good balance."
"Taste: The taste is pretty much all hops but thats not a bad thing. I only wish that more beers could be wet-hopped. Theres also some caramel malts to it but who cares about that! Wet-hopped = delicious."
"D- I'd be pretty satisfied with just one bomber, im kind of let down, i expected a huge bright, citrusy hop monster. Still a quality beer none the less. Definitely worth a try for Sierra fans, hop fans and collectors of one off brews."
"A great beer, Im glad to have found it, and wish I have had any of the other vintages, and will absolutely be looking for this beer each year."
"Exceptional Ale!!!"
"Maybe it's the size of the bottle, but I'm a little intimidated in terms of finishing this beer right now. Since the beer is so loaded with flavor from every side it's a lot to gulp down after a while, despite its amazingness. Overall, I'm very happy I bought it."
"Notes: It is certainly a very drinkable beer if I had another bottle I would have another without a doubt.Cheers"
"I'd say, one of the top IPAs available. In my opinion, the wet hops give a little more perfumy aroma, and tea like flavor. The fresher hops I feel really puts it over the top, and adds some flavor to go along with the bitterness. Recommended."
"It's very good, I'll get it again next year...love SN."
"Nice beer. Pours a nice copper red with a very fluffy off white head. Great lacing that lasts the entire beer. Has a aroma of hops and a little yeast and cirtus, but nothing that really stand out, mostly the hops. As for the taste there is hops and citrus. Nice smooth beer that is medium bodied with just a hint of bitterness to it. Great session beer. I did think that it would be better but wasn't that bad."
"Medium body, good CO2 (from a keg though so this doesn't mean anything). Very drinkable, but this was not at all what I was expecting."
"Wonderful malty aroma, with a tad of citrus. This beer is very well balanced with a nice, cotton candy type bitterness. Hops are very much on the flavor end of the spectrum. Bitterness is mellow and balanced nicely by the malt. Beautifully round, and quite exceptional."
"On tap at Buckeye Beer Engine. Amber in color, with a nice, lasting tan head. A fairly hoppy IPA with a floral and citrus nose; there was malt on the palate and a piney hop flavor dominated. Fairly balanced, but nothing dramatically special about it. Good, but there are plenty better."
"D- Very drinkable. Nice solid tasting beer."
"M&D- Feel is slick with silky carbonation that makes it superbly drinkable and refreshing"
"Nice color, good head, aroma is lacking in fresh hop goodness, and drinkability is fine, but lackluster. Don't get me wrong, buy one of these and relish in the awesomness of the fresh hops...just don't get crazy. And this beer (as are most fresh hop beers) is not one that will last. Chill it and kill it."
"D - drinkability is hurt a little by the sharpness"
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a solid beer and a decent experience. For the price you can't beat it. Seriously, $3 for 24oz? That's a deal."
"A solid outing once again by the folks at Sierra Nevada. This is a very good, not great beer, in my opinion. But it's solid and consistent and does not disappoint really in any aspect. The nose could be a bit bigger for my tastes, but that's just me being picky. A totally drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 24 oz. bottle. It has a nice aged copper color with a substantial head that laces down the glass. I enjoyed the smell, which was hoppy yet different than other beers presumably because of it being wet-hopped. The taste was fantastic. It was both sweet and smooth in the bitterness and citrus flavors of the hops. It was a big beer in taste and weight, but eminently drinkable and enjoyable. The 6.7 % ABV does get to you and this beer quickly goes down."
"Pours brilliant clarity amber color with white lacey head. Aroma is balanced toward the hoppy side with citrus, pineapple aromas and sweet caramel malts. Flavor is also balanced toward the hoppy side but with significant malt presence. Hops are very american: citrusy maybe a little resiny hop flavor balanced with sweet malt and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable delicious american ale. Unique style fresh hop flavor is awesome."
"An enjoyable fresh hop ale. Others in the style I enjoy more. But this one is totally acceptable. I enjoyed the Chico Estate version more."
"Pours a clear deep copper color with a smallish head and lots of lacing. Aroma is medium sweet with strong grapefruit and caramel to a lesser extent. The flavor is nicely bitter and more pine shines through than does in the aroma. Full-bodied, crisp texture. Long dry and bitter finish."
"Pours a medium golden with a HUGE frothy head. The retention is fantastic and the lacing is outstanding. The aroma is of fresh mint, grapefruit, pine sap, and caramel malt. Delicious grapefruity fresh hops great my palate. The hops impart a nice level of bitterness that tastes of mint and herbs, and which is joined by a solid sweet caramel backbone. The mouthfeel is sticky and the carbonation is excellent."
"I'm pleased with this beer in that I like the fresh hop flavor, but in this case they don't make it so overt. Others want to knock you over with hops and lose all since of balance."
"pours a copper color with a huge frothy and bubbly cream colored head. great retentive lacing. the nose is a nice bouquet of floral hops, mildly spicy hops, piney hops, subtle sweet malts. the taste is piney hops, sweet malts, nice bitterness, kicks you in the tongue with spicy hops, slight citrus in the finish. a very crisp brew. tastes like a hoppy American Red Ale. medium body, medium spritzy carbo, semi dry finish"
"Drinkability: It's not as good as we were hoping. But you could easily sit around drinking these all night long. Even our girlfriends like it. Fun drinking for the whole family!"
"A smooth, easy to drink beer."
"I have not had any Sierra Nevada Harvest Ales before other than their Southern Hemisphere version. From what I was told and what I expected from this wet hop method was a very distinct piney and citrus aroma. This wasn't really the case. It seemed like there was some piney-like hops in the nose but it was dominated by malts. The apperance was spot on though. It has a nice copper look to it as well as a nice off white head. There was good head retention and great lacing. The taste had very good bitterness to it and there was quite a bit of citrus hop flavor to it. It also has a nice caramel like sweetness to it which makes it a pretty well balanced beer. The mouthfeel was full and I think that it is fairly drinkable with its great balance."
"This is an exceptional beer. Definitely an iconic beverage. I don't think I've ever had a fresh hop ale as good as this one. Sierra Nevada has always been a symbol of quality. This beer is just another reason why they may be one of the greatest craft breweries out there. I am tempted to go pick up a case of this despite the cost at $6.50 a bottle. This beer is definitely worth it."
"Very highly recommend."
"D: very high. I'll probably go get another couple bottles and put in the celler to check this pioneer's journey through time."
"This is a good beer, but not quite up there with SN's best. As mentioned in an earlier post however, it's still a great bang for the buck."
"Overall, an incredible beer. I really wish the would be available daily. Apa is a good and reliable style, but i never had one i found was a incredible beer, until i had this one. With the alc content and the hop presence, it makes me think this is a hybird of a apa and american ipa. Just a great beer all around."
"D - Another excellent contribution to craft brewing by SN. This is almost as good as the SN Southern Harvest Fresh Hop but not quite. Glad I had a line of communication with my local beer store so that I was emailed when it came in."
"This one gets better with each sip... not a heavy drinker, but a damn fine beer to sit back and enjoy."
"A huge 3-finger bubbly tan head clings to the glass for all it's worth before it leaves spots of lacing around the glass and some fluff right on top of the brew. Color is a clear copper. Potent hops at first are noticed on the nose, then a little citrus and pine. Tastes of perfect citrus hops with a good malt backbone and a spicy aftertaste. This is a perfectly balanced, light to medium bodied brew that doesn't kill you on the hop bite, but hits dead on the bullseye."
"A good brew. Works with with a nice plate of Mexican food. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for a 12th release of this brew. Well worth the price for a try."
"I can see that this would make an easy drinking bottle, but for me, the hops are too over dominant. I might pick up a few bottles to cellar for a year or two, to see how they age."
"The beer poured a clear, deep, reddish-amber with a thick, almond head into a pint glass. The aroma was of fresh, piney hops. The initial flavor was of sweet malt and hops, with a fairly quick transition to a bitter hop finish. Beautiful carbonation and lacing matched with the nicely balance hop profile - another quality brew from SN."
"Pours a clear, copper colour with a nice head. Decent retention with a small amount of lace. Aroma is of citrus/ pine hops, with a sweet malt malt character. The aroma is very nice, but not as intense as I would expect from a wet hopped beer. Flavour starts out with a sweet, lightly nutty malt character that transitions into the citrus/pine hop flavour. Very balanced between malt and hops. I expected more green fresh wet hop character, and while the hops are certainly there they dont exhibit that character. Finish is pleasantly bitter with a slight lingering malt sweetness. Carbonation is medium as is the body. Overall this is a very nice, easy drinking pale ale. Very well balanced. I would think that the wet hops would have been more prominantly featured in this one though."
"well, I thought long and hard trying to find a flaw in the beer because I am hesitant to award my first perfect score, but I just couldn't do it. To me this is the best example of everything I am looking for in a beer. Highly recommended!"
"Medium copper with a nice pillow head. Smell is a very distinct balance of rich hops and a definite malt sweet aroma. The taste is excellent, pre.esnting the same balance as the aroma..hops aren't harsh, malt isn't overly sweet. Mouthfeel is rich, chewy..a beer to savor. Drinkability based on the above characteristics is way above average."
"Damn, this is one hoppy/delicious beer. Although you can smell and taste the hops easily, the beer is still not that bitter and has a very 'wet' mouthfeel to me.. which is different but good. I think it's kinda of cool how they do this in one night and bottle it all up and ship it out in a day. For the price, it was one of the best purchases I made and I'm gonna go out and get more this weekend."
"D - Because not too extreme, extremely drinkable!"
"M/D: ok this is a very clean drinkable beer. its very good. very sessionable. its not very robust but has enough flavor and body to keep it pumpin"
"Drinkability: A pretty nice APA, overall; well-balanced, with enough bitterness to please the hophead"
"I picked up a 24oz bottle. Poured it into a pint glass in two servings. Color is light copper with some cloudiness. Thick foamy head with nice lacing. The smell is dominated by sweet malt with a hint of pine and hops. The taste is better balanced than the aroma. Tastes lightly malty, some sweetness and a little hoppy. Mild bitterness rounds out the taste. Leaves some stick in the mouth but goes down very easy. A very drinkable and tasty harvest ale."
"Pours a nice clear auburn color, big foamy khaki-colored head fades slowly, and leaves big foamy sheets of lacing in the glass. Smell is bright citrus hops, with a biscuity malt background. Lots of citrus flavors, tangerine, slightly bitter grapefruit, some pine on the back end, light caramel sweetness. This is the very definition of medium-bodied, lively carbonation, and a pretty intense lingering grassy bitterness. Crazy-drinkable beer....love everything Sierra Nevada does."
" SN in the 24 oz. bottle, The Chico Estate, Harvest ale and Wet hop ale are high very high quality and should be loved by traditional hop head everywhere."
"D: Easily drinkable, i do wish the ABV was a tad lower, though"
"D: Drinkable, but I'm not sure I could do more than one of 24 oz bottles at one time. Definitely glad that I finally had this beer."
"Overall: An excellent Pale Ale. A good choice to start an evening or to enjoy with dinner. A seasonal upgrade over SNPA that is worth the extra cost."
"D: Damn good, great, incredibly fresh taste, easy drinking, wish they had this all the time kind of beer. A must try, if you see this in the store you must pick it up, and at 5 bucks a pop, its an incredible deal. Highly recommended."
"Out of a 24 fluid ounce bomber this brew was a very appealing amber with ruby highlights. It had good visible rising carbonation and a tan head that displayed some good lacing and retention in chunks of sticky foam. The aroma was bold and hoppy, pine and citrus with hints of alcohol esters and earthy malt. The flavors were also hop dominated, the wet flavor was apparent in the many facets of the hops, green and piney at first followed by hints of citrus rind and some resin at the end. The malt backbone does show through all the hops activity and offers a nice doughy character that helps ground the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and the carbonation perfect. Very drinkable and rather complex without being aggressive."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a very nice aftertaste. Very easy drinking but not quite as hoppy as I was hoping for."
"This drinks very quickly for something with such and abundant flavor profile. Excellent fall harvest ale."
"mouth is oily but expected with a wet hop. good carbonation and very drinkable."
"D-I'm buying a case of it, while its note quite as good as the southern hemi, still overall a fantastic freah hop brew."
"I love this beer and at less than four bucks for a 24oz bomber the Sierra Nevada Harvest series are probably one of the best deals around"
"mouthfeel is resiny delicious lingering hops, bitterly sweet, carbonation is perfect, yum"
"One of the originals, still one of the best."
"Another very nice beer from Sierra Nevada. I'll look forward to the 13th release."
"D- I like wet hops.... this is not my favorite of the bunch though."
"Notes: 2008 vintage."
"I look forward to this beer every year. Highly recommended."
"Poured the beer from the bottle into a pint glass. I absolutely love the way this beer looks, beautiful copper color with frothy off white head which goes the distance. The nose is hops lovely hops, spiciness. I am slightly biased, I love hops. This beer is outstanding the taste is hoppy but well balanced, medium bodied. Wonderful beer. I will go and buy the rest of the stock up. Really liked this one!!!!"
"looks like a not so dull penny, smells of beautiful hops with some sweetness. produces an inch of head and some lacing that lingers. wow this is what I remember from my first sierra nevada, only this is full-on hops. The esters from the wet hops i can really taste and are at the front of the flavor profile. Very rounded body nice nutty malts. finishes with the grapefruit tart which leaves you needing more. light carbonation, very slightly sticky. tremendous"
"This reminded me of SN Pale Ale with a bolder hop presence and less hop/malt balance. Good beer!"
"The taste is surprisingly complex. The immediate flavor is that dry citrus from the hops, but continues into a gradual sweetness from the malts. Fantastic moutfeel, light and refreshing without becoming thin. Could drink this all day. Maybe I'll try."
"I will definitely have this again."
"Overall, a good beer by Sierra Nevada that reminds me of their Pale Ale."
"D: Pretty fair really. A bomber is good, but if on a night out I could easily pour back a few pints of this before having to switch it up. The hops kinda wear on the tongue a bit, but not too bad. All in all a great brew. Can't wait for 2008's beer!"
"One of the best ""pale ales"" I've had, though it may in fact fit in the IPA category better. Certainly highly recommended."
"Great beer."
"Im glad this one came in a 22oz. I definately want more."
"A great specialty APA from Sierra Nevada. I think I actually like this one better than its older more popular sibling."
"This is one hell of a pale ale. The hops hit you over the head, but i wouldn't expect and less from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall- Good thick and solid. This could be a staple amongst Pale Ales."
"This poured a hazy rusted copper color with light tan head. It smelled like strong copper hops and floral hops with a bit of light malt. It tasted like potent bitter pine sap and dry floral hops. It was oily with no carbonation, and had a lasting very bitter aftertaste. Overall this was not a very well balanced beer, and didn't have the best hops flavor either. But it was at least clean had a good body."
"24oz brown bottle. It poured a bronze color with nice clarity. The smell is of hops and you can tell its is a very complex beer. The taste has a touch of frutiness and nice malts, a beautifully crafted beer. It feels smooth in my mouth with a nice level of carbonation. Definately a beer that I could drink all night. This was a great idea wwith the fresh ingridients and it worked wonderfully!"
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink had a dark amber appearance with creamy lacing and a patchy head. The aromas were generally spicy with some malts and hops. I also sensed some light caramel and some grain to the aromas as well. The drink was bittersweet with an almost syrupy sweet maltyness and spice. General medium body, helped it be smooth and not overpowering. Overall, this one was pretty good."
"Poured into a pint glass. Beautiful amber hue with a foamy white head that dissipates to lace the glass. Carbonation is very evident. The aroma is fresh mowed grass, fields of grain blowing in a spring breeze, and a floral hoppy flower. The taste is hop oil mixed with more hop oil and then a malt backbone that tells you its there, but faintly. The oils coat the mouth from start to finish. The body is medium to full. I would drink this every day until my tastebuds were completely burned out."
"Overall: A great beer, props to SN for making this beer and now twice a year. Get it while you can and in this case the 2007 actually holds up pretty well over time."
"An amber color with hints of gold along the sides of the glass. A two inch off white colored head forms on top. The aroma is strong, it can be smelled several feet away. There is a quick scent of malt at the start, then an onslaught attack of hops cames right at you. It brings the combined fragrances of grass, citrus, and earth. The malt is very mild at the front of the taste. Then halfway across the palate the hop flavor comes out with citrus and earthy flavors. A watery feel, with a bit tingle from the carbonation. It does stay consistant all the way through. Wow, what an intense aroma and a surprisingly balanced flavor. The aroma tells you hops are coming at you, but the taste reminds you that malt is the backbone to this beer, not guest to the party."
"I am using a pint glass and see a lots of lacing and a decent creamy head. Head tastes all creamy, too. Smells hoppy and like honey. Taste is similar with more of a pine hopness. There is a sweet malt flavor that comes out sort of like caramels. This is a very drinkable, delicious beer. It's not all out hops, it just a smooth, incredibly well-balanced beer. Delicious!"
"D - Has a nice balance: heavily hopped, obviously, but not over-powering."
"DA: Easily drinkable and definitely a go-to american IPA."
"This is quite possibly as good as Celebration Ale, which is hard for me to believe. Celebration seems to possess a more pronounced hoppiness, but this has the unique vibrancy of freshly harvested hops, making it incredibly delectable and unique. I can only imagine how this is even more impressive within the first month of it being bottled, though this by no means tasted like it had aged at all."
"D - Overall, this is a nice drinking beer that is nicely balanced and would maybe be a beer that I would drink with some pizza. It is one of those beers that I could easily finish the whole bomber and then say oh no where did that go?! Very easy drinker that has a nice good taste to it."
"Quite drinkable indeed."
"Pours clear amber with a creamy dense off white head three fingers high and sticky. The nose is all hops, pine, grapefruit, and slight peppery musk. Really nice peppery hop spice right away, perfumy pine, and a bitterness that intensifies into the finish and becomes very dry. Light buttery malts in the back and melon fruit about. Good amount of cloying, average mouthfeel. Overall a really fragrant hop beer and at times does well to assert itself."
"Foamy bubbles like the top of a bubble bath are a light tan head and jump to two fingers. Lace is thick and consistent as the head slowly subdues. Body is an attractive orange amber glow. Hops are sweet and gummy on the nose with notes of spearmint, anise, green tea, and wet wheat. A zesty, prickly hoppy freshness enters the mouth. Like walking among hop bushes at harvest time. This beer is crisp and refreshing with tingling mouth hue throughout. The bitter is even and long carried by a thick resin like feel on the tongue. This nectar like elixar should be a real winner with the hop heads. Nicely drinkable."
"Don't worry, this is balanced. You can drink it and not say its another one sided hop bomb that lacks character. Seek this mother of india pale ales out and stock up before its all gone and you have to wait for next year's release."
"Beer poured an amber color with a solid white head that is leaving a beautiful lacing in my glass. Nose, not surprisingly, is hoppy. Taste is of caramel malts balanced nicely by northwest hops. Mouthfeel is full for the style, quite nice! Overall drinkability is very good. Celebration has always been my favorite SN brew but this one has just taken over as it is a bit more balanced. I will definitely have to try it 5-6 months earlier!"
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: I would really like to try this again next year when it's fresh. I'm not sure whether or not some of the ""edge"" was worn off this beer in the 6 or so months since it was bottled. I could easily drink several of these in one sitting, though it would be nice to have a 12-ounce serving to cure the occasional ""hop fix."" I wish I had picked up a few more bottles when I saw them, but this is now definitely on my list of yearly seasonals to seek out."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber red color with a nice off-white head that leaves a nice film. Malty aroma with nice hops, florals, and citrus. Crisp refreshing taste with good malts initially, giving way to citrus and florals and a great pine-ish bitter finish. Nice lingering hop aftertaste. Light- to medium-bodied; very smooth with minimal carbonation. An excellent and refreshing offering from SN that I'll look for again."
"d- awesome"
"Poured from a 24oz. bottle into a pint glass. Brown in color. Nice head with some lacing. Fresh smelling, piny and floral hops, that aren't as overpowering in the nose that I thought they would. Flavor has the same hop thing going as the aroma, but with a sweet, biscuity, malt background. Mouthfeel is relatively thick, but not overly so. I could drink a lot of this beer, but it doesn't quite stick out."
"2007 edition - 24 oz bottle with some code on the label. It pours a clear orangey-topaz, with low carbonation and topped with two fingers of sticky head that eventually reduce to almost nothing. Spicy and floral in the nose, with a backing of orange and pine. Strong hop bitterness and flavors, with orange, grapefruit and a woody character being the most prevalent, lasting long into the finish. Slight malt backing and subtler hop flavors hide beneath as well. Medium and fairly smooth body, but the carbonation is tingly and numbing, lowering the drinkability. This is definitely a hoppy beer (perhaps too much so), but I did enjoy it and will probably give it another chance at some point - ideally a few months closer to the release date so I can check out its full potential."
"The 2007 Harvest Ale is a great example of the difference between using fresh, wet hops in the kettle over dry hops. The beer poured very clean, I assume the yeast was filtered out and this beer did not bottle condition. The color was a nice amber color with a creamy white head that lasted throughout the glass. The smell was great; crisp and clean but not overpowering. With a smell this refined, great care was taken to ensure purity in this brew. The taste seemed a bit light to me, granted the fresh hops do not impart the robust taste that the dried hops give but I still felt this beer was a bit thin. Very crisp, however; it was a nice change from the almost purely dried hops used in every other beer. The mouthfeel was exceptional and this is a definitely drinkable beer. Well worth a try if you can still find a bottle. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - This might seem just a bit stiff for the beginning drinker but anyone who can appreciate APAs will love this beer."
"Pours a nice ruby amber with a good sized lasting off white head in a tulip. Piney, chemical cleaner like hops aroma. After it warms, some bitter unripe pecan like nuttiness too. Taste is pretty similar to smell. Kind of piney, fairly bitter, and astringent like hop taste. Nicely carbonated and nice body. Sharp, dry metallic bitterness but a faint earthy sweetness in the finish as well. Overall a hoppier than average IPA that has a unique character about it. Good, but something I'll have to try again, I think."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Nice job once again by one of the APA originals."
"I would recommend this beer once a year when it's released"
"Pours a copper, golden color with no head. Smell is slightly hoppy. Not a hop-bomb or overbearing. Taste is piney hops. Again not over the top or dominating, but reserved and actually well done. Decent brew. A good beer from a brewery that I'm not very fond of, so that is a success."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a clear medium amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention but no lacing. Aroma consists of bitter hops with some traces of caramel malt. Taste is a mix between some bitter green hops with some notes of caramel malt. Medium body with some average carbonation. This beer is really average on so many levels and it definitely isn't one of the best harvest hops beers that I have had the chance to try."
"thanks Sierra Nevada!"
"Serving Type: Bottle in English Pint Glass"
"Another overrated beer from Sierra Nevada."
"The beer pours a brilliant copper/amber color with a nice thick white head. The aroma is hoppy, moderate-high, citrusy, spicy, and a hint of pine. The flavor is highly hoppy, with moderate bitterness, yet there is enough malt presence to create a nice balance. The flavors are like the smell, citrusy, piney, and slightly sweet. The body is medium-full and mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. Overall a great beer, highly recommend!"
"I poured one for the guys at my Tuesday night beer club. My friend said it best: ""Dude, this is alive!"""
"Thanks to SN for bottling this finally. Going to pick up a case next year."
"Very bitter for a wet hop. That being said, this is another excellent beer from SN. It's nice to have a fresh hop with flavor."
"2007 bottling, 24 oz bottle. Pours a hazed amber body with a creamy eggshell head. Lots of sticky lacing is left on the pint glass. Aroma of spicy and earthy hops. Grassy, pine, and floral notes emerge as it warms. A hint of caramel underneath. Medium body and carbonation is a bit slick. Taste if full of leafy hop bitterness. Grassy, earthy, piney, and spicy hops run the show here. A hint of caramel sweetness adds some balance. Wish I could've had this one a bit fresher but the hops are still just fine at this stage."
"Sweet nectar! I look forward to next year's version."
"2007 Bottling (11th Edition). Pours a dusty amber-orange with flecks of gold and deep orange, tones of blonde. Head is large, foamy, honey-tinted, and solid. Spotty but strongly present lacing rings the glass. Aroma is pleasant and warm with a strong overtone of pine and orange. Goes down slick and smooth; carbonation is on the lighter side and the mouthfeel is juicy to oily. Flavor is at once lightly buttery and bitter. Sourdough, pale malts and dough / butter are followed closely by astringent, oily pine and grapefruit hops. Finish is oily and mild with a lingering light bitterness and some warmth."
"A great brew from Sierra Nevada. Although this one has lost some of it's fresh hop edge by now, it is one tasty tasty beer that I eagerly look forward to for next years hop harvest."
"D- A great everyday beer, very fresh all around, maybe the best beer in the Sierra Nevada line-up."
"What I mean to say is,I would take an older bottle of this over a few other brews any day."
"Again, I blame my disappointment on the time this has spent on my local store's shelf and an under-carbonated bottle."
"Pours a reddish tinted amber color with a nice creamy 2 finger head into a pint glass. Smells of nice piny and citrusy hops. Taste wasn't a hop bomb I thought it would be. (The write up on the label builds it up to be a slam dunk, but I think it fell short.) It does have a pleasant earthy hop presence, just not a complete bitter hoppy bite. The mouthfeel was a little over carbonated and thin. Lack of crispness at the end as well. Very drinkable and a pretty good earthy flavored brew in all."
"Good drinkability on this one but the 24oz's is enough for one sitting, not a bad APA in all"
"Poured a nice dark orange/copper color with nice generous white head that lasted quite a while and left nice lacing on the glass. Open the bottle and you immediately are treated to the nice hoppy aroma of this beer. Flavor is also hoppy with hints of citrus and grass. The maltiness balances the beer nicely. The mouthfeel is good and I could drink a lot of these. Great beer."
"Poured from a 24 oz. bottle. The color is a clear, light copper/red. A nice off-white head forms on the top which leaves a lot of lacing down the glass. I could smell a lot of piny hops before I even put my nose near the glass. Some citrus on the nose, too. A nice medium mouthfeel and carbonation. A hint of caramel gives way to bitterness all over the tongue that stick around for quite a while after the swallow. All in all, a really good hoppy ale."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full. Light oiliness."
"A good IPA."
"24oz bottle bought at Lou's in Augusta. Pours slightly hazy amber-red with a thin quickly disappearing off-white head. Smells amazing - pine, citrus, floral, herbal, mint... Hoppiest smelling beer I've ever had. Tastes similar to the armoa. Mint, pine, floral, citrus bitterness shining bright on this one with just enough malt to keep this one from being one-dimensional. Surprisingly clean finish. Medium mouth feel, making for a rich-feeling palate without being chewy or viscous. Medium carbonation is just enough to keep things clean and make this one a really easy drinker despite the big flavor and abv. Wow. A hop-head's dream. This is perhaps the finest use of American hops in a beer I have ever tasted. I would drink this morning noon and night everyday but I'd probably feel spoiled."
"Pours a nice amber color with a tan off-white head. It has a nice amber malty and hoppy aroma. The taste delivers just that. This is a superb pale ale with a very nice amber malty base with a really crisp and clean hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is excellent. It has a really fresh, crisp, mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. This is a really drinkable beer and it is definately worth a try if it can be found."
"Pretty full bodied and creamy smooth. Not one to quibble, but this beer fills me up. I've had a 24 oz bottled version which is nearly the equal of the beer on tap, but in either case 24 oz is about my limit of this stuff."
"D - The drinkablity is great. I wish I had another bottle."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, citrus, pines, some spicyness, and caramel. The taste is a hop bomb, some malts kick in later with a slight sweetness, nice citrus/pine tones, and nice touch of spices/caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, a mighty fine brew from SN."
"What a great all-around beer...I thought this would be good, but I didn't know how good. If ""Fresh Hop Ale"" ever becomes a widespread style, the beer world will be better for it -- if they're all pulled off as well as this one. Truly outstanding."
"overall this is a beer that sucessfully balances numerous hop flavors but but has a little less of a hop kick that i was expecting from a sierra nevada 'fresh hop ale.' but that just means it was different than i was expecting, not any less enjoyable."
"Pours a clear copper color with a lovely head and good lacing. The aroma is surprisingly faint, even after it warmed, but there are some nice, and complex, hoppy notes, fruity, piney, lovely. The taste is much more assertive, and delicious, and complex. It has about every adjective you could use to describe hops. Its wet with oils, fresh grapefruit and citrus, piney to a certain extent, bitters toward the end... but what of the malts? They're there too, and also seem in a more 'raw' state, grainy and everything coming off dry, even though its smooth through the middle. The carbonation is spot on, has good body... its just a thoroughly drinkable beer!"
"I recommend trying this very well brewed beer!"
"I love hops! This is my first wet hop brew and I wasn't disappointed. Harvest pours a very bright, deep copper color with a lovely tan head full of big bubbles. It billows over the top of the glass in a mound of foam. It smells incredible with notes of pine and cascade hops. There is a bit of a sweet smell that mixes well in the aroma. The taste is beautiful. Big hop character with significant bitterness that is not overpowering. A thin layer of head follows the beer to the bottom of the glass. The medium mouthfeel is very smooth and glides over the tongue and down to the belly. Harvest is a very drinkable beer; a hopheads dream!"
"a great fresh hop ale. More than enough hop complexity to satisfy anyone."
"Overall, great beer."
"Nothing about this beer wows you except it is so well balanced you could drink it all night. Don't expect your typical big seasonal beer and just enjoy this brew for its great drinkablility..."
"I'll be heading back to the store to get a few more bottles as this easily cured my hop fix. I look forward to this beer every year for at least the past few years."
"Drinkability- This is a really tasty brew that I thoroughly enjoyed. I dont think it quite has the balance of say Deschutes Hop Trip but Im not a huge hop head either. This is probably more of a true fresh hop beer because the hops are more pronounced. I havent had a bad Sierra Nevada brew and this one doesnt even come close. Definitely worth picking up."
"D - Great APA. You can really tell how fresh hops make a difference in a beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth, soft, and light in the mouth... I think that it could benefit from a little more activity and texture. Otherwise, this tasting goes down as my absolute favorite APA from a bottle yet... as with many things in the food and beverage world, fresh is best."
"D'ability - A different kind of hop bomb. Very pleasant - not overly bitter despite being quite hoppy. IBUs are under control, and a very pleasant big APA."
"Poured from bottle into Pizza Port 7th annual Real Festivale int glass. Poured a copper color with slight red tint. The head was white, thick, and foamy with good retention and lacing. Smell light pine citrus yeasty aromoa. Taste heavy citrus rind and pine flavor, wish that the malt flavors were bigger. However with a light crispy mouthfeel and a hearty drinking IPA bitterness, this harvest ale with wet hops is a very enjoyable beer to drink."
"Sierra Nevada Harbenst pours a orange copper with a thick bubbly head. The aroma is fresh citrusy hops, earthy and almost metallic. The flavor is just packed with citrusy hops, not bitter but just tons of delicious hops. A slight malty caramel sweetness come through but gives way to solid bitterness. I like the idea of this beer and I'd love to try it even fresher."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of amber, with a frothy off white colored head - nose of nice hops, fresh and light malts taste of nice fresh hops, light malts, and resin- body is medium , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of grape fruit, resin, bitter, and semi-dirty"
"Pours a crystal clear orange amber with a very nice sized crème head that has excellent staying power. Nose is very sticky, piney hops. Flavor is interesting. Kind of like a nice and thickly hopped ale with a leafy thing mixed in on the backend (to appease the whole ""harvest"" thing). Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and the liquid is pretty well bodied. Overall this is a good APA. Definitely smooth and robust. The bite is a bit much on the bubble, but it is definitely worth going for."
"I hope this comes out in six packs next year."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, very well carbonated, and very smooth and refreshing. Extremely drinkable. I could drink this all day during the summer. Overall, very nice offering from Sierra Nevada. Highly recommended."
"D: Throughly enjoyable brew, especially if you favor things on the hoppier side of center."
"Pours a clear coppery amber honey with a giant white foamy head. The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing. The smell is a mix of sweet malt and hops. A nice citrus and carmel mix. The taste is a mix of bitter and citrus hops. Sweet malt makes it's self known in the aftertase making this a complex and enjoyable brew from one of the classic American breweries."
"I'd call this medium bodied, moderately carbonated and highly refreshing. Surprisingly easy to drink, this really hits the spot."
"I cannot help but wonder how our current hop shortage might affect this beer and other highly hopped beers later in year 2008."
"Pours a crisp, clean medium bronze color with a thin, bubbly off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Spots of lacing dot the inside of the glassware. The nose is incredible - very fresh, aromatic hops like they were squeezed into the bottle. Floral, herbal, and some citrus notes break through right off the bat. A slight sweetness accompanies the hops, making this beer smell absolutely terrific. I could use this in an air-freshener! I mean that in a good way, of course. The palate is lively and full of fresh hop flavors as well. Extremely floral and clean with enough malt backbone to keep a good hop/malt balance going. The mouth feel is full, but does not come across as overly thick or sticky. Finishes slightly sweet and leaves a pleasant floral hop taste in the mouth. Very drinkable if you dig hops. This isn't your typical American hop bomb, by any stretch ... what's going on here is much more subtle. There is enough in-your-face hop presence here, though, to deter the typical light lager drinker. A truly quality beer in a rather rare style - it doesn't get much better!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style even though you could argue that this is an IPA rather than an APA. This is a very enjoyable beer that I could drink for a long time."
"Pours a clear amber with a medium off-white head. Smells of lemon. Taste is hoppy, fresh citrus taste, slightly grassy, with a good toasty malt in the background. Surprisingly balanced with good bitterness from the hops. The carbonation is slightly high, and the beer has a full mouthfeel. Very drinkable, a very good tasting beer. This is the first wet-hop beer I've had, and I plan on buying this again next year when it comes out."
"Pours a clear amber, huge and thick off white head forms, tons of lacing, looks great, good retention. Smell is very flowery, citrus and floral, bread, alcohol, lots of light fruits, very fresh hop aroma, very nice. Taste is perfumy, lots of floral and citrus freshness, caramel and bready malt, minerals, more fresh hops, great bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, bit of warmth, very crisp flavour, significant bitterness, but highly enjoyable. Thanks a lot Jan!"
"Rerddish copper with a dense white head that leaves nice sticky lacing. The smell is hops but with a nice caramel note backing it. The taste is wonderful, smooth and spicy. The hops are everywhere but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is silky and maybe even buttery. I am not a hops fan and yet this beer is right up my alley. This one may convert me. The drinkability is very good. The smooth character has led me to almost drain the bottle before I've finished reviewing it. Well done, boys, well done!"
" The 6.20% ABV is just right for this beer, since it can hardly be felt, and sneaks up on you like the flavors do. Even though this has a fall release, it can be enjoyed any time of the year, since it's neither too strong, nor too spicy, nor too warming, in it's attributes. Any hopheads or SN fans out there won't be disappointed by this - it's well worth going out of the way to find."
"24oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a dark brownish amber color with a nice creamy off-white head with great retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet malt and fresh hops. The taste is surprisingly balanced with a nice malt backbone that complements a fresh bitter hop taste in the finish. Overall, this is one of the better beers from the Sierra Nevada lineup that is highly recommended."
"The first time the Northern Hemisphere has shown up in town. $6.99 for the 24oz bottle. I complained, 5 years ago, that it was too dry of a beer for me and after sipping on the bottle I just bought today, I give myself a kick in the buttocks. It's dry but the wet hops are kicking it with the spices and I'm enjoying this a lot. Score adjusted.."
"The hop flavor here is pretty dry for a wet hopped beer. See Great Divide's Fresh Hop Ale for a study in wet hopping. This doesn't get it done."
"D: I could drink this all night, the alcohol is not apparent at all and the hops are not overwhelming like some IPAs. I would like to compare this to SNPA just out of curiosity. Highly recommended and a nice change from an IPA, I am very glad I picked up 4 of them :)"
"Found this beer in a grocery store when it came out and figured I would try the larger than average format. I was not disappointed at all. The wet hops give it a distinct taste that I look forward to trying again next year. I only bought one at the time and have been looking for it ever since."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: The beer is a clear copper-amber color with a medium off-white head that dissipates slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. Big piney hops aroma with caramel malt and herbs. Medium body with earthy malt and herbal hops flavors. Hints of citrus fruit and dough too. The finish is moderately bitter and leaves a lingering hoppiness. Solid all around."
"Good beer. Very drinkable. My first wet-hopped beer, so I don't have much to compare with, but I hope to be trying more in the future."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear dark amber brew. Thick, pillowy head lasts and lasts, with chunky dwelling lace. Aroma is dominated by prodigious amounts of piney hops. Taste follows the nose, with some malt backbone, but the close finds the hops reasserting themselves anew. Mouthfeel and drinability are both good for the style. Seems to push the APA envelope for me, but a worthy brew nonetheless."
"I'm not sure SN has hit what they are advertising. I expected a Dub IPA like beer and that isn't what I got. It's a nice beer. I would label a SNPA + a little better than the standard green label from SN. Worth a shot and I will buy it again."
"Poured a cloudy amber with a large head. Smelled crisp with a possible hint of banana. Tasted smooth and very inline with Sierra Nevada. It's like the SN Pale Ale ""hopped up"" with flavor. It's a very complex taste similar to Stone Brewery. Very drinkable, but unfortunately quite expensive. If this was affordable and mass produced, the human species could be fated to a mellow existence."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Sierra Nevada knows pale ales. Purchased one bottle to try for a mear $3.99 the day before Thanksgiving. I wished I would not have waited to long to have this. When I went back for more I did not see any, too bad."
"Poured into a mug, it's a deep cooper-orange color with excellent head retention. As a pale ale using fresh hops, the hops in this beer are crazy! It starts bready with a touch of caramel, which is then puished aside for lots of bitterness. Grapefruit and piney notes are most noticable of the group. Bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. With the hop presence as big as it is, it's more of an IPA than a pale ale."
"I stumbled upon this killer brew after a tip from the wobbley mail man! Any Sierrra NV beer I've had has been great, but the Harvest is the best I've had in a while. I'm a fan of IPA's, porters and stouts and I was more than satisfied with the unbeatable taste of this beer."
"D: Drinks wonderfully. I will definitely be buying it again. Worth every penny."
"Feels thick and substantial with a very nice level of carbonation."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with visible effervescence and a mammoth stiff eggshell colored head that fades in a rocky pattern, leaving 3D lacing in is wake...wow! this is a Pale Ale(!?!). The smell is an aggressive classic bountiful fresh hopped aroma. Definitely a CELEBRATION of #8000 LBs of hops. (Wonder what holds in store for next year...with the current state of the hop harvest). Savior it while you've got it gang. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is really nice. Smooth yet complex. Hoppy yet wonderfully balanced with a solid malty sweetness. A little roasted malt character as well. Full flavored, each mouthful through the textbook head is creamy citrus pine and grapefruit. Once again...this is an APA?! Rivals many IPAs. At 6.2% ABV you'd think that you could enjoy this one all day long...but not...if this is 6%, i'm a slim man! Hey, this is kick'n. Highly recommended. Now lets talk about the bottle...are you kidding me 24oz's. This packaging definitely sets the standard. The height of this bottle is so much easier to store (and send) than the current 22oz Industry Standard. Tastes like ""i want more"". Thank God for Gomers in KC, MO!"
"drinkability: high"
"d: Nice hops and low bitterness make this an enjoyable and pretty drinkable APA. Its a good beer, but i've had better fresh hop ales."
"D: The 24 ounce bottle disappeared as quickly as most 12 ouncers. Yet another great brew from Sierra Nevada - probably their best."
"Pretty damn drinkable, certainly not hopped up to IPA levels, and i was pleasantly surprised with the tasty malts in this one. Slightly dry and refreshing. Glad i got to try this one, its something i would enjoy again, just dont expect it to measure up to fresh hopped IPAs."
"Amber pour with an off white head that disipated but laces a bit as you drink it. Aroma is very nice, the fresh (wet) hops really give it a different aroma with a nice malt backbone. Taste is of carmel malt, but the hops seem to be very subtle compared to a dry hopped beer, nice hop flavor but the bitterness isn't there. Definatly a beer I could have a few of, and one of the better SN beers I have ever had."
"Steve Harrison-RIP."
"I'm going out to get some more bottles as they probably move fast."
"Drinkability - this is a very good ale, one that is all about fresh hops, and is also sessionable."
"This is an APA with character while remaining a beer that is easy to drink and easy to enjoy. Well done, Sierra Nevada."
"This is an excellent beer. I still like the maltier, darker stuff better (Celebrator, anyone?) but this is a damn fine beer that tastes and smells remarkable. Very impressive!!"
"Drinkability is very good. Without that aftertaste, and without waxing your tongue with each sip, you can really just enjoy the beer. However, it may make this beer less memorable? I'm not a big fan of hoppy beers, so it's very hard for me to expound on its virtues, or describe the differences from its brethren."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer has a full body and is appropriately carbonated. As mentioned before it finishes with a somewhat dry character, and leaves the mouth watering, wanting more. This is a brew that I perceive to be heavier in body than most APAs, I like that. This is a brew that I'd not hesitate to buy again, though I'll have to wait a year to buy it again. Before I come back to this one I'd definitely like to try some other fresh hop ales and see how they compare. This is definitely an offering from Sierra Nevada that you don't want to miss out on."
"D: at 6.2% this is highly drinkable. If I was a jerk I could have bought several cases of this fine beer. And perhaps I should have, but due to my pack rat nature I thought that I would take to long to drink it. And others would enjoy it more right away. My unselfishness leaves me with only 1 bottle left. If my supply weren't so low I could drink this all night."
"Good drinkibiblity. I wonder what the IBU's are on this sucker?"
"Deep amber-bronze with lighter edges. Tall, thick, light khaki head. Great lacing. Big citrus hop nose. Fresh grapefruit, juicy pineapple and pine. Fruit and cookie malt backbone. Tongue-tingling hop flavors up front. Big, piny hop flavor. Juicy fruit and sugary malts temper the resinous hop bitterness mid-palate. More pine and light citrus in the herbal bitter finish. Medium body with a creamy feel and an oily finish. Outstandingly delicious and I am really glad to see this in bottles!"
"Drinkability - too intense for much sessionability, but this is one fine brew. Could pass for an IPA really, at the very least would fit the bill for an 'Imperial Pale Ale' if there was such a thing."
"D-I only had one bottle courtesy of PintOfNoReturn, now I wish I had many more."
"This one caught my eye due to the Harvest label stating that they were using fresh, green hops. It's a great beer and one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada. The green, oily hop flavor is strong and it gives a unique character to the beer; something I haven't found in many other ales. This is a keeper!!!"
"A very direct and simple beer, yet with no lack of lure or character. Gets in there and gets the job done. It quenches the thirst, it satisfies any hophead's craving, and it definitely leaves you wanting more. At 6.7% (so says the 11th Edition label), it's not gonna kill you to hog the whole bottle for yourself."
"Steve"
"D - This is as easy to drink as SNPA - which is quite impressive. I will try to have this at least annually. Although it is simply an excellent APA, it is worth seeking out. I will have again."
"Edit: If you were that guy in line in front of me at the Coop, please beermail me, I wanna say thanks."
"Don't pass this one by. Buy it, and get as much as your budget will allow. In fact, sod it, just overspend and report an exception."
"This was my first time having this beer, and I must say that it is another fabulous beer by Sierrra Nevada!"
"pours a reddish copper color with a pretty white head, that laces quite well. smells really good, lots of flowerly hops present. taste is odd.. it has a great hop first impretion, citrusy, bitter and well defined. but after that it drops off, it seems like it doens't have alot of body to it, i can't explain it. its a good beer dont get me wrong, but i dont see it as good as other people have rated it, maybe i got a bad batch, or my pallet isn't well defined enough"
"At 6.2% - I could drink this all night. I thought the Celebration Ale was my favorite SN offering - not anymore. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this one while it lasts."
"Poured from 24 oz. bottle into chalice (should note 2007 release). Pours an amazing amber color that is crystal clear. Nice thick head with an almost creamy quality to it and excellent retention. Great lacing and layers left after each sip. Smell is good but not as strong as I expected. A definite hop presence with some grassy aroma as well. Taste is good, hoppy with good malt balance. This beer seems to have a different hop taste than other APA's or IPA's. Its a subtle and smooth presence. Moderate carbonation and a dry and oily aftertaste. Very smooth beer. Overall a terriffic beer. I dont believe its their best offering (gotta go Celebration there) but a strong one and deserving of the hype. I waited months to try this and was not let down one bit."
"Drinkabity: Overall, a great offering from Sierra Nevada, though I enjoy this beer much more on tap. Quite worth a try, though I don't see myself buying this very often (unless it's on tap), simply because I can think of many IPA's with much higher drinkability."
"superbly drinkable, i put this bottle away as if it was a much smaller one. not at all abrasive, and hits all the right notes."
"This for me was a bit different than the rest of the SN line. Was expecting more on the hops but actually seemed to be less pine and citrus and more of an english ipa. This is more of an american ipa light. Very tasty and highly drinkable, sessionable for sure. If one were to look up the definition of consistent the SN label would be right there. Would like to see this in 12's or 6's."
"This beer is similar to the celebration ale, but is a bit sweeter and then there is the leafy tobacco aroma and flavor from the wet hopping. In any event, this is an excellent beer from Sierra Nevada. If not particularly surprised by that, I will say that I'm nevertheless impressed. Very good beer."
"24 oz bottle purchased at Bevereage Superstore in Suwanee, GA for $2.99 - What a deal!. The brew pours a beautiful copper color with a nice fluffy head that leaves sticky lacing that slowly falls. The aroma is all hops, spicy and peppery with a little citrusy zest as well. Taste is all oily, citrusy grapefruit hops with just enough malt sweetness for balance but make no mistake, this brew is all about the hops. Good job from the folks at Sierra Nevada!"
"Goes down real easy and is a well crafted special release. Would be nice to see it in sixers someday like their Anniversary Ale was packaged."
"D_very good. Highly reminiscent of fresh hops and very different from the pale ale. Another winner from SN"
"First time I've ever had the grand-daddy of all wet hop ales. It's light copper in color with a long-lasting head; the bouquet is very flowery, with a strong, neutral (ie generalized) hop smell. Similarly, the biting hop start is pronounced and has a nice juiciness to it. There's a light tinge of alcohol on the finish; the aftertaste is bitter and enduring. You'll have to search for any malt presence to speak of, but that's not really what this beer is about is it? A wonderfully refreshing APA that is a great showcase for hops. There are better 'wet hop' beers out there, but Harvest Ale is a classic, unrepenting introduction to the beauties of the hop."
"The single word that occurs to me when I think of Sierra Nevada is 'solid'. As it turns out, one of the original American craft breweries is also one of the best. Harvest Ale (11th Edition) is delicious beer that deserves to be released throughout the entire country, right alongside their standard lineup. Given its 'fresh hop' nature, I know that isn't possible, but it sure would make a lot of hopheads happy. This one included."
"Overall, I was disappointed with this beer. Hop heads may rejoice with this seasonal offering, but I found its overwhelming hop bitterness rather difficult to stomach."
"Finish is long and grapefruity bitter."
"D - Despite the aroma, deceptively smooth. More than one at a time? maybe. Very nice."
"A good above average harvest beer."
"D: As an APA, this is a nice drink. I'd like to see a little more wet hop flavor, as the uniqueness of the flavor makes for a great drink."
"As far as drinkability goes, I don't think I could have too many of these. I love this beer but I could have only so many before my tastebuds are blasted to smithereens. There's a lot going on here and it truly is that good."
"Wow, what a great brew. Really showcases the flavors that can be produced with fresh hops, and does so with a masterful level of balance. The 24 ounce bottle goes down as fast as if it were just 12."
"24oz bottle purchased for $4 from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Pours a clear, medium copper with ample head. Terrific lacing. Nice fresh hop aroma, but I have a feeling it would be much stronger if this was on draught. Flavour is quite nice - with fresh hops upfront. I'm enjoying this quite a bit more than the Harpoon Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer."
"Poured out a fairly clear amber brew with a 2 finger head. Smells of hops as soon as i pop the cap off,,hell yea. Smells of floral citrusy hoppage,,really nice smell.Taste is very good,excellent use of hops make this anIPA that possibly people that arent into IPAs like.Mouthfeel is nice.This is a vey likable drink,,Sierra Nevada should make this all the time. Good Stuff!!!"
"Smooth and tasty, and not a bad buy at $4.50 for a 24oz jug bottle at almost 7% alcohol."
"This is a well balanced, tasty beer. Other than the odd notes I picked up in the aroma this would make a great everyday APA."
"Overall I thought this was a slightly above average pale ale. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'd rather have an Anniversary or Celebration Ale."
"As the beer warms the malt sweet shows a come-back in the finish that really helps things out."
"Nice copper color with a half inch head that has great retention that leaves some stickly lacing. Smell is as expected, hops, mostly on the piney side. I had a full case of these and this is one of the last 2. Early on the hops had a really fresh smell, now with some age on it, it comes across slightly metallic. Taste again is piney hops with a sligth metallic tinge. Again when it was fresh it was outstanding, now it has dropped to mearly a good level. Overall I thought this was a great beer and really enjoyed a case of it. Only complaint is that it dosn't age real well but that is to be expected with a hoppy beer like this one. Get it fresh next year and enjoy it."
"Overall, I've been looking forward to trying this one and was not disappointed in the least. A very tasty beer that I will be getting every year it comes out from now on."
"Last year I had this brew on tap but had not reviewed it at that time. This year I was able to track this brew down bottled. This brew poured to a copper color that had amber highlights, had a nice sized off white head that had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas, as expected, really show off the hops which give a very nice floral scent but also noticeable is a nice malt sweetness that gives it a very inviting scent. The taste, is very good, the hops really stand out here as they seem to coat the mouth quite well leaving a hop residue and linger at the tail end. In the beginning the malt flavor does stick out and with that start and the hop finish it seems to be ell balanced. This is a very good brew, nice one to bridge the fall till the winter when the celebration ale makes its appearance."
"Drinkability: the fresh enjoyable taste is accentuated by a wonderful mouthfeel. I would love to have this all year round."
"OMG. This beer is incredible. It pours a light brown color, clear and not cloudy at all. Absolutely love the color. Frothy white head that laces all the way down the glass. Aroma is incredible. This is my first fresh hop beer and I am blown away. Truly unique aroma. Fresh flowery bouquet, rich and deep, some sweetness, bready, and a bit peppery. Flavor is again unique. A whole different type of bitterness here. Fresh. Sort of a light hop bite, but very much upfront if that makes any sense. Again, a very rich hop experience. Very well done. A nice malty backbone here too and bready."
"Wowee! Exceptional beer. This is way better than the Celebration. This is much softer and rounder. wish it were sitting on my lap. mmmm. The hops arent so sharp and are in harmony with the malts. Lots of lace with a nice head. Clear amber color. Nice nose. Earthy without fruitiness. Extremely drinkable. Great finish."
"D: Gimme more."
"D - The fresh hop taste is always one I want to quaff. Glad I can get my hands on this brew this year."
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin, though it drinks very easily. Good beer, but I don't think it lives up to the ""extreme"" hype on the label."
"D: This glass is disappearing quickly and the other half of the bottle will soon follow but the hop bitterness is starting to catch up with me."
"D- A bit bitter for a session beer, but I'd enjoy this one from time to time."
"Overall a very drinkable Pale ale."
"Taste is a great interplay between fresh hop bitterness and a soft, yet sufficient malt backdrop. Lots of hop flavor intricacies to nail down. This brew strikes a perfect balance while still letting the hop flavor dance in the forefront. Mouthfeel is defined by hop bitterness, finishing with well, even more bitterness. Nice. I'm glad they are 24 oz bottles. Cheers."
"24 oz bottle. What a thing of beauty. The brew pours a beautiful copper color with 2 fingers of ivory head that leaves a ton of sticky lace as it slowly falls. This one is crystal clear and has a solid carbonation working up to the top. This one almost appears to glow in the glass. The aroma is nice, with a spicy and peppery hop with a kick of citrusy zest as well. This is balanced with a solid caramel backbone and a touch of fresh green vegetative matter in there as well; think good like freshly cut herbs or pine needles right from the tree. The flavor starts with a crisp citrus and lighter earthy hop balanced with a kick of pepperyness. Behind this sits the caramel malt that moves to a mild bitter and fresh green flavor. It rounds out with a mellow bready and grainy flavor that belnds well into the caramel and pulls the earthyness of the hop in as well. This one is very tasty. Mouthfeel is moderate with a lively moderate carbonation. This is one of the more drinakble beers I have had in a long time. I really don't even want to set my glass down. This one is big on flavor while being very sessionable. I'll look forward to this each and every year."
"Drinkability: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Very solid hoppy goodness. Can drink a few of these.... I should go get more of this..."
"The beer starts out by seducing you with its dark-reddish appearance and thin frothy foam that looks like it just came out of the fermenter. Smells sweet and fruity, with a hint of just-cut grass, no doubt from the fresh cascade ans centennial hops. Tastes like how a beer would taste in the perfect world -- no overpowering flavors, but the entire range of hop flavors are on display: hints of floral, piney flavors, bitterness and spicyness throughout each sip. So smooth, that I never noticed the alcohol. Fresh hops really do make a difference and its too bad that this is only available once a year."
"Sierra Nevada rarely disappoints."
"I liked it better than the SNPA and the Anniversary Ale. Probably on an even keel with the Celebration Ale. Will definitely return to this in years to come."
"Eric"
"I could drink maybe two of these without getting tired of it. My favorite Sierra Nevada brew...or maybe a tie with celebration 07."
"So well balanced and smooth. Easy to drink. The hops are so pleasant - no harsh bitterness. I finished the whole bottle before I knew it. This was my first wet-hop beer, and if the rest of them are like this one, I may have some new best friends."
"The first thing that strikes me about this beer upon first taste is how oily & slick the mouthfeel is. Juicy flavors of orange, pine cone and spicy black pepper. A totally enjoyable APA with that distinctive Sierra Nevada signature flavor."
"Overall, a decent IPA(?) with good bitterness. It's a little simplistic and not totally to my tastes."
"tastefully done. hoppy APA over a simple but effective malt platform. bitter, tactful, super tasty. somewhat piney although certainly more citrus. actually, now that i think about it, the crystal malts are fairly significant. i guess you need something to bite into if a good hop experience is going to be successful. it's a very smooth drink"
"What a wonderful offering--it looks great and tastes better. Some great hoppiness that lingers well into the aftertaste."
"I also enjoyed 2 pints of this quality offering on tap at the Gingerman in NYC. Smooth, tasty, balanced and thoroughly enjoyable ale. Fresh hops poking through and in sublime balance with layers of smooth malts. Nice job by SN."
"This beer is perfectly crafted. The hop is not overwhelming and never out of character or place."
"Pours a light rustic amber with a nice two finger fluffy khaki colored head that slowly dies down to layer of goodness. Stickiness is insane, leaving hop webs all over the place. Smell is a clean citrus scent with hint of light caramel malt. Very enjoyable in the nose, clean and smooth. Taste is a creamy bitter pine flavor that lasts forever. A hint of sweet caramel appears on the tongue as well. There is some earthy hopness in the middle, but overall this is a good clean citrus pale ale. Mouthfeel is a good creamy texture that is light on the tongue. Some mild carbonation that gives this one an exceptional feel. My first fresh hop ale of the short season and it came out damn good. I have Great Divide Fresh Hop Ale and Deschutes Hop Trip awaiting to step up to the plate."
"Brilliant clarity with more carbonation than I expected. I've never smelled such clean fresh hops. Great lacing, I can look at my glass and count how many times I've had a drink, always a good sign. Notable piney hops throughout but not a wallop in the face, refined freshness. Nice aftertaste with the hops building and lingering around until the next drink. Overall I was very impressed with this beer. I only hope my unborn children are half as beautiful as this beer."
"This beer comes as advertised. It pours a clear, deep amber color with lots of brownish head, thick bubbles, good retention, and very nice lacing. The smell is piney, resinous hops, and you might find some sweet malts popping through of the bready variety, but the smell is all hops. The taste won't disappoint. This is a medium to full bodied beer, decently carbonated, with tons of resinous hop flavors. The back bone does contain malty tones to it, but its hard to get beyond the hops. These are green, fresh, piney hops in the taste, as is advertised on the bottle. This isn't the most well balanced beer you'll ever taste, but the nice surprise is the very nice creamy mouthfeel and the lack of hop resin on the tongue. The aftertaste is a bit tart and lingers longer than it probably should. This is a very nice beer, especially for hop heads who will appreciate the hopped up nature of this ale. L'Chaim."
"Finally got to try this as it is both in bottles and draft in the Twin Cities. I had a bottle, and it was good. Not knock-down excellent, but a good beer. I think Town Hall's Fresh Hop and Great Divide are more my style for fresh hop beers."
"D - Very tasty wet hop beer. The resiny earthy flavor/feel of the hops would prevent me from having more than 1 22oz. It has a slight taste feel I had when I tried eating hop pellets, pleasant in a beer but not pleasant eating the pellets."
"Good body, appropriate carbonation. So drinkable. This one is so very nice."
"Mouthfeel is good and comfortable for the style and the aftertaste is no where near as offensive as the actual fresh taste, but still I am left with little more than 'just hops'."
"D- Fairly drinkable brew. I love the grapefruit, citrusey qualities but it might be a little bit on the bitter and thick side to be very drinkable for a pale ale."
"Ditto every other review I've read with one exception: Beer Belcher's ; I don't know what he was drinking but it couldn't have been this beer. Harvest Ale 2007 is absolutely positively the best APA I've ever had in my life!!! I'm going out tomorrow to buy up every bottle I can find!!! This beer should be the standard by which every other American beer should be judged. The clarity, head retention, lacing and drinkability of this brew is unsurpassed. I've lived in Europe and I'm a big fan of German beers (in Germany only) and often wondered how most of what passes for beer here in the USA was ever sold. This offering by Sierra Nevada gives me hope for the future ... and could go a long way towards making me proud to be an American beer drinker."
"CHEERS AND HOPPY HALLOWEEN!!!"
"They did a nice job with this beer this year, I feel grateful for drinking my first one as I will my next 2.. great stuff"
"This has been such an ellusive beer for me; but the billing was worth it. This is a fantastic beer. The pour brings a dark copper - nearly brown appearance with nice head retention and some lacing. Aromas are simply of light toasty malt, and a soft powdery sweetness -- kinda Dortmunder-like. The hop aromas was certainly showcased in the nose with a sharp, fresh, spicy, citrus character along with pine and lemon grass. Flavors remain soft and simple on the malt front with a firm toast taste, and delicate sweetness. And again, the hops steel the show, bringing a big hit of grapefruit, orange rinds, pine resins, and a bitter, grassy flavor. The texture is quite light and very easy to drink. Refreshing and hoppy in the finish. Simply a great beer. Thanks again Clvand0."
"Notes: Not exactly sure where this falls, score-wise, when compared to my reviews of the SNPA, Celebration and Anniversary Ale (all somewhat similar offerings from Sierra Nevada), but I can say this with certainty: this is a mighty quaffable beer for the 6.7% ABV (my bottle says 6.7 versus the 6.2 listed here)."
"Overall: Sierra Nevada is on the the forfathers of micro brews and beers like this one is the reason they are still around and others got into true craft brews. This is a nice West Coast APA that tastes good and is easy to drink. It's a great beer from a great company, what more would you expect?"
"Highly recommended. Just as good as I remember it from tap. This would make for a great everyday drinking beer for me."
"Cheers."
"Overall impression: Awesome to see this in bottles, I've been enjoying this one on tap the last few years. This is definitely one of my favorite fresh hops - shows off the flavors very well, and seems to come through pretty well in the bottled version too."
"d - lip smacking good. i had a 24 oz bottle of this and could have gone back for more."
"O: lovely, the glass went down easy and subsequent glasses were desired..."
"Overall an excellent seasonal."
"this was recommended to me after I expressed disappointment with the anniversary ale. This is my favorite Sierra Nevada to date"
"Final Statement: A very very good beer. Surprisngly balanced, fresh smelling, and amazingly different mouthfeel."
"dry hops don't create"
"d: I split the two liters with a buddy and was glad for the help, though I would not have minded a bit more."
"This beer poured a nice amber/copper hue with a thick dense tan head that was a full three fingers worth. The head had good retention and left a decent amount of lacing on my imperial pint glass. This is one of the best smelling APA's I've ever smelled. Strong scents of grapefruit and pine with slight grassy overtones. The scent is very pleasant and never leaves throughout the entire beer. The taste is just like the nose.Good malty backbone that balances out the hops very well and doesn't let them overpower the beer. It is a well balanced beer that finished very smooth with very little bittering. The mouthfeel is very smooth and almost a little creamy. It coats the mouth very well and overall is very quaff able. Drinkability also holds very high for this beer. It's fresh, tasty, and it leaves you wanting another one. Well done."
"Pours a transparent auburn color with decent head retention. Outstanding lacings coat the inside of the glass throughout the session. The aroma is of pungent oily hops. Very piney, fresh-hop smell. The taste is magnificent. There is a wonderful hop flavor that is different on the palate than the usual dry-hopped beers. Using the fresh undried hops really seems to make quite a difference. This is one of the best beers I have tasted in a while, probably the most satisfying of the fall season so far. Very impressed with this offering, as I generally am with most Sierra Nevada brews. Very nicely done."
"Poured from a 24oz bottle into a pint glass, very clear light bronze coloration, medium thick head. Smell was not as overpowering as I was expecting. Very hoppy, but not particularly floral or citrusy. Taste was a bit yeasty, quite hoppy, but not really what I was expecting. Leaves your mouth with a very bitter aftertaste. Not a bad beer, and a bargain at 4 dollars versus 5.50+ for most fresh hop ales from other brewers. Nothing extraordinary in my opinion, but very solid indeed. Just what you might expect from Sierra, very hoppy and fresh, always a good bet at a party."
"I'll be looking for the 12th edition, though. ....and the 13th, the 14th, 15th...."
"This beer is highly drinkable. 6.2 don't qualify as a session beer for most, but if I had an opportunity to do pitchers of this stuff, I would have no problem slowing down and making it a longer session. This is highly swillable and a great beer."
"This has a basic taste that reminds me of this brewery's pale ale, anniversary ale and something similar to the celebration. If you like those beers (which I do), then you will like this one, too! Complexities give it an enjoyability, as does the intermingling of the malty sweetness and hop bitterness. Well-done!"
"Pours a bright, clear golden amber color with a fantastic fluffy white head that dissipated quite slowly leaving a wall of lacing on the glass. The smell is fainter than I expected but still good. The aroma is of grassy and piney hops. The taste is very buddy and grassy and has a moderate malt base. The hops dominate the flavor profile. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture. It finishes with a solid bitter twang. A very hoppy and fresh APA and definitely worth a purchase. Very drinkable for a hoppy brew."
"D: A moderate ABV makes this easy to drink; outstanding flavors, aroma and balance make it even easier. Definitely one of the finest, most-drinkable APAs I've enjoyed in quite a while. SNBC has a winner here..."
"Fantastic brew, and I am SO happy to see them bottling this now. I used to look forward to this on tap each year, and now I can enjoy it at home. As much as I like seeing this in bottles, I'd love to have this on cask someday... I bet it would do quite well."
"2008 UPDATE: There's an intense citrus and pine hops hit at firsy, but it quickly fades to mellower grapefruit flavors. Still a great beer, but I found last year's beer to have a fuller hop flavor. Still worth a try. Very tasty."
"D - I am somewhat surprised to say that this beer is highly drinkable. I am always a bit wary of hop-centric beers, especially from west coast brewers, as they can easily become over the top abuses of the virtues of the hop bine. However, SNV Harvest is a strong reminder that many brewers are capable of centering a beer around hops while maintaining balance and bringing out all of the best characteristics of the hops. I think that one of the reasons that this beer is so successful is its somewhat restrained bitterness. By aiming their hops more at aroma and flavor than bittering they have achieved a level of hop complexity far beyond that of beers that shoot for shock-value IBU numbers."
"Overall, an excellent beer and one which I would definitely drink again."
"Drinkability is average. Honestly, I could have used more hop flavor and less bitterness. The softness of the wet hops coupled with the sweetness of malt reminded me of an aged IPA."
"The harvest with the fresh hops is a keeper. It pours a light amber color with a nice foam head that leaves some nice lacing. The smell is of oily hops and the flavor is malt up front with the hop kicker. Out of the fresh hop beers I have tried this is the chewiest. Overall the alcohol is more prevalent in the taste but it has a nice balance to the brew. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Drinks very easy, a pretty good celebration of the hop, not perfect by any means. I recall this being better on draft, but I usually find that to be the case. Needs more aromatic hops to make me really happy. Just ecstatic to find it down here!"
"It's good to see this widely available."
"Deep copper hue. Slightly hazed. Rocky eggshell colored head sits on top. The retenion is better than average and lace patterns are quite full and intricate. Nice hop aroma, but not as heavy as I was expecting from this wet hopped beer. It contains all the usual suspects on the nose. Grapefruit, canabis, pine resin and citrus. Just not that strong for the style. This beer is pretty thick. Full bodied and heavy. Carbonation is pretty light. The malt base of this beer is caramel and toffee based. The bitterness does linger, but it's more of an astringent kind of bitterness. The hoppiness is pretty subdued for a wet hopped beer. Not sure what happened here, but it's really not what I was expecting. Celebration has a lot more juicy hop flavors than this. Maybe the Town Hall's Fresh Hop beer has me spoiled now, but this really is pretty average."
"Personal Score- 94/100"
"I like this beer alot though I do remember it being even better on tap..."
"D- It is probably the best fresh hopped beer I have had. Just excellent and wish you could get it year round in regular 6-packs."
"This beer pours a clear golden amber with a frothy just off white head that holds nicely and laces well. The smell is full of fresh cascade and centennial hops with a touch of malty sweetness. The taste also bursts forth with the hop flavor and finishes with a slight malty sweet and toastiness. The mouthfeel is very nice for the style with even carbonation. Overall, very nice beer, one of the best sierra nevada has. very drinkable."
"Best. Sierra. Nevada. Ever."
"I have been hearing about this beer for years and finally had a chance to try it. Overall, it is a well crafted beer with an obvious tilt toward the hops. In fact, why is this not considered an IPA? I think this is the first ""wet hop"" brew that I have had and I must say it is different. Kudos to SN for all of their effort in the production of this jewel. One of the most hoppy-bitter APA's that I have ever tried and happily, since this is a 24oz bottle, I am ready for round # 2."
"D: One of the better Pale Ales I've had. Very easy drinking, perfect with my dinner(Fish n' Chips), and would make a nice session beer."
"Poured from a 24oz bottle purchased for $4.99 in Columbus, then poured into a Boston Beer Company lager glass. The first seriously good attribute is the huge frothy and rocky head, making cumulus clouds on top of the beer and leaving tons of lacing on the glass. The beer itself is crystal clear light copper color. The aroma is pungent with hops, much more so than the Harpoon wet hopped ale I tried 2 days ago. The flavor has some sweet balance with the hops, although it might be that some of that sweetness comes from the resinous hops (not sure). It's a delicious mix no matter where the flavors come from. This is a must-buy, a very good deal for 24oz of top-shelf beer."
"Drinkability is very high here. I mean 4 bucks for a 24 oz. 6.2%er is a very nice change."
"D- This beer has some subtle hop flavors that are more muted than I would expect for 8,000 lbs of wet hops. The bitterness really comes through and is a bit more than I would like without a big flavor of hops. There is a quality to the hops that may be just my imagination but it has as unique flavor like MSG that makes me anxious for the next sip. Perhaps that is the mystery of the wet hops, but it is still tasty."
"Cheers!"
"It's just like the label says, you get way more nuances in the hop scent and flavor. It's a biggish beer and tends to overpower simpler food, but I could still session one of these."
"Perfect beer for ...hell anything."
"D: Very drinkable. I could drink this all night."
"bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"Pours a nice rusty orange color; beer is bit translucent. Has a thin head that laces away, but the lace stays for a long time...Aroma is of hops and pine. Has a slight sweetness to the taste, but I get a little distracted by the higher degree of carbonation....has piney aftertones and left a bit of an oily feel in my mouth."
"The taste is sharp, citrusy, oily hops. The pine is more subdued than in the aroma but it is there. Nice biscuity malt helps to balance this beer out a bit, though it is far from what you would typically call a ""well balanced beer."" A lingering citrus rind bitterness is present well after the beer leaves your mouth. Mouthfeel is medium and oily from the hops with a pleasant carbonation level. Pretty easy to drink. A good beer and the original wet hop beer."
"Overall: A good but not spectacular brew by the folks at SN. I like the balance that is achieved here, though I don't know how much the wet hops used actually end up noticeably affecting the flavour, for my mouth at least."
"Mouth happinesss: tastes like more !"
"One damn fine beer. I could probably drink one after another if my life depended on it, or if I just had more than one 24 oz. bottle in the fridge. If you see this one, pick it up, you will not be sorry."
"Very, very nice oarangey bronze color-looks like fall in a glass. Moderate aroma-newly mown grass. Faint toasted malt. Decent amount of hop flavor up front though not overly bitter. Nice malty sweetness right there in the finish. Again a mellow toasted malt character. Good body. Overall a very enjoyable beer. I could see a lot of this in one sitting. Compared to SN's other recent efforts ie the IPA, Anniversary and Brown ales this is far superior. Nice job."
"D: I got the last bottle at the distributor. Too bad because this is a really enjoyable beer. Hopefully next years will be as good."
"Taste is floral and fruity. Chewy grapefruit and orange rind. Bitter and sweet at the same time. Unique flavor, quite good."
"Pours a beautiful deep amber color, excellent head retention and very heavy lacing. Very nice hop aroma, without a lot of citrus or pine. Smells fresh! Duh! Very smooth hop flavor, just the slightest amount of bitterness. Balanced by a hefty malt body. Very smooth, very drinkable. I was expecting more of an over the top DIPA kind of flavor, but this fresh hop ale is very well done!"
"D: I loved this beer. I was really looking forward to this beer after watching the video on Sierra Nevada's website about how they truck the fresh hops down to Chico and brew the beer within 36 hours. It did not disappoint whatsoever."
"D - I'd like to have another please! This is easy to enjoy. Its a simple and true beer pure to the hops featured here."
"Tawny, crystalline amber. Steady, driving streams of carbonation. Ecru foam, all fat, chunky, pock-marked and sticky. Floral, citrus, and pine aromas are fresh and fully present, yet more understated than brash dry-hopping would produce. Bitter grapefruit pith and lemongrass. Slightly sugary background. Lightly toasted bread in the aftertaste, with grassy, piney, raw hop burps. Fuller mouthfeel than expected, with a medium-heavy slickness to it. Most certainly a fresh-hopped brew to be reckoned with, and by far the best Ive ever tasted. Love the 24-ounce overgrown stubby bottle, too."
"At long last, Sierra Nevada has bottled their infamous Harvest Ale. I happened upon this beauty at Bottleworks in Seattle, and loaded four bombers into my basket. This is a unique brew in that ""green"" fresh hops are used in the brewing process, which creates a beer that is almost sticky in its oiliness. What a wonderful treat to finally have in bottles..."
"D - Good - could drink a couple more right now..."
"D: A very drinkable offering in my opinion. The only thing is, I was a bit thrown off by the balance of this beer. Actually, it exhibits a rather nice malt/hop compromise, I was just not sure what to expect from the hop profile. Still, it was tasty, and I appreciate the painstaking effort that goes into wet hop ales."
"An exceptional value, drink it fresh while you can get it!"
"D: I'm still just getting into these harvest, wet hop ales, as they seem to be getting more available around here in Huntington and Orange County. A very good beer from Sierra Nevada, I will definitely be getting more of this while it is still available."
"Pours out a brilliant copper with a wealth of evenly distributed bubbles throughout the glass. Head is thick and creamy, kind of like this came from a nitro widget. Leaves some sticky and raised rings of lace. Aroma is of pungent grapefruit and pine, giving this a fresh angle on a classic West Coast pale ale aroma profile. Lots of hop resin fills the nostrils over a backdrop of toasty maltiness, caramel, and brown sugar. This tastes fantastic. You get beat over the head with grapefruit oils and pine sap but with only moderate bitterness. Malt is really only there to lend some soft sweetness and a subdued toastiness in the finish, which mixes with the lingering hop oils. Somewhere on the middle of this, I get some definite caramel, but it's certainly not all that prominent against the hops. Mouthfeel is light to mid weight with a bouncy carbonation. It can get just the slightest bit sticky in the mouth, but it's not too bad. This is going extremely fast, and I should slow myself down. Really great quality and the most affordable fresh hop beer available to us in Texas."
"Bottle to pint glass reveals the darker, rich bronze body with very mild, active carbonation. The head is on the smaller side with very good retention that will fade back into the glass eventually. The smell is loaded with the freshest hops, reminding me of an imperial IPA, but milder. The taste is exceptional and blended perfectly. This will satisfy both hop-heads and those that are not as it has tons of hops but lacks the biting bitterness of most beers that are this well-hopped. It's amazing how this beer can be so robust yet mild at the same time. A bit heavier and creamier in the mouth than most IPA's with a good balance of carbonation, hops, and the other elements. The mildness and lack of a bitter smack-in-the-face leaves this quite drinkable. Okay, very drinkable. I'll have to snag another bomber of this."
"This is my first so-called ""wet hop"" ale, and it was very good. The hop flavors were huge and definitely different than what I'm used to. I'd certainly like to try more wet hop beers. Recommended if you love hops."
"Drinkability: Aside from the 12 dollar price tag at my local bar, I could drink this when I'm in the mood for an american pale ale. Its definately in my top 2 for the style."
"Served on tap at the Toronado. This beer was pretty good, but given the hype I had heard was slightly disappointing. It had a crystal clear amber body and looked great in the light. The aroma was sweet and had some hop aroma, but not as much as I wanted. The flavor was pretty good as well with good hop flavor and a sweet maltiness. Again however, I wanted some more hop presence. Medium body and not a bad beer, just not what I was expecting."
"Very drinkable. I appreciated the extra 2ozs in the bottle and was longing for a couple more. This beer is so good it makes me a gluttonous."
"Pours very clear, with a dark amber hue that resembles a medium-colored tea. Nice lacing on the glass, even though the head is just a dusting. Aromas are full of American hops -- grapefruit and mint, some honey from the malts, and a fresh, soft, green aroma. It seems to have fewer edges than the aroma of a dry-hopped beer, perhaps. On the palate, very full flavors and carbonation, starting with with substantial, but soft, hop bitterness that sets the sides of the tongue a-tingling. Things sweeten up a bit from the mid-palate on, as the malts and the alcohol present themselves. The finish is substantially dry, very active, and long, as those green, piney aromas from the nose show themselves. Overall, this is a fantastic beer -- well executed, integrated, and tasty. The wet hops seem to add a distinctive soft, green element to things. Very good."
"Pours a nice golden amber,with a huge off white head. Lots of retention,and lacing. Smell is of sweet fruit,and grassy,pineyhops.Body is medium,with carbonation. Taste is of grapefruit,and piney hops, Smooth,and creamy,with a nice burn in the finish. Excellent!!"
"Overall, a more of an IPA. Reminds me of a super-fresh Celebration. Still, better than many, and definately worth a try."
"Whoa, that's a large Sierra Nevade bottle. Pours amber to red with a large big-bubbled head that reduces to a creamy half inch. Aroma is lemony, slightly catty and fresh. Flavor is bitingly bitter but only for a moment. Oily hoppiness, very lemony and grassy. Fresh hops do rule, apparantly..or at least make it oilier. Medium to full bodied. A nice drinking experience."
"Pours a clear copper with orange hue with a couple fingers of off white head that dies slow and laces big. Smells of big juicy citrus hops and little sweet malt. Taste is huge on hops but not overpowering and not bittering at all. Citrus, rind but nothing to fry my palate, yum. Malty balance shows but the hops do dominate yet dont pack a big punch. Medium in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Rediculous drikability. APA eh? I consider this one of the best in show if that the case. Well worth the try."
"D- This was very intense, but damn impressive."
"Overall Impression: Well, it is a load of hops. I guess I was hoping for a little more depth on the malt side, but this is a hop lovers dream date. I guess I would call this a West Coast XPA. Good stuff, but I think Im good until next years harvest."
"Sure wish SN would bottle this full time instead of their regular Pale Ale. And yes, I went through those 4 bottles rather quickly, and just bought 4 more. A case purchase isn't far behind...hope there's some left!"
"Outstanding!"
"Poured this beer into a nice red wine glass. The color was pretty amber glow with a tan pillowy head. The smell of fresh pine and roasted malts. The taste is so smooth with a big presence of earth tones and fresh roasted peanuts. Great oily pine resin really cotes the tongue. The mouthfeel is med. body but the beer is so well balanced that is comes off bigger than expected. Drinkabilty is perfect. So complex so many foods this would go well with."
"D--Nice wet-hopped brew. As stated previously, a bit more aggressive on the hop kick than I expected. Overall a very good beer by this old gaurd."
"Drinkability is as good as it gets. Sierra Nevada has brewing down to an exact science and that is why I will never stop buying their products. Highly recommended"
"Overall a tasty and very drinkable APA. However, a bit more body would have gone far to temper the medicinal herbal hop notes."
"Full,creamy mouthfeel,had a nice smooth feel, for all the hoppyness, suprizing drinkability would have loved another,but have to move onto something else."
"Pours reddish golden with 1/2"" white head that leaves a continuous lace rim, but the head dissipates relatively quickly. The aroma is moderately malty with light hops and very slight carboard. The taste is good - malty, slightly sweet initial flavor with moderate to heavy hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with dry finish and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good, easily drinkable pale ale that is not too sweet. I think it is maybe a little overpriced compared with some beers of equal quality."
" Body is nice and smooth, about perfect for the flavors embodied in this beer. An exceptionally drinkable ale, I wish I could get this fresh year-round. Alas, it's one's of the best treats of fall."
"Yummy solid stuff!"
"This had a clear orange color and a musty smell, yumthe mouthfeel is like lots of tiny bubbles, weird carbonation. Taste is subtle oily hops, no bitterness and the alcohol is not noticeable. Good fresh hop ale but my favorite is Deschutes Hop trip. Sierra Nevada never seems to disappoint."
"Medium bodied, pleasant carbonation, very refreshing, balanced and hoppy. A very nice beer."
"This beer clings to the palate failry well and makes for a decent session."
"A nice toasted malt follows up the bitter yet juicy hop load. Lingering bitter pine with a hint of sweet. Malt has a round feel after the inital bitterness. Dry, tacky in the aftertaste. Very easy to finish the 24 oz. bottle. Reccommended."
"Overall impression: Clean, well balanced, and smooth. High carbonation makes it seem lighter than it probably is. Strikingly smooth for the amount of hops. Well balanced and enjoyable. I know wet hop beers are kind of trendy but SN delivers in spades here. Nicely done!"
"Probably the best beer I've ever had from Sierra Nevada and it quite easily rivals Great Divide's Fresh Hop."
"Served at nearly cellar temperature, in a pint glass, from a twenty-four ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful, rich dark reddish copper color that was quite clear. About a two finger, thick almost pillowy off-white head rose and slowly faded back into the glass, leaving plenty of lace in it's wake. Smell was of very fresh hops, thick malty aromas, and some citrusy notes in the background. Taste was as good maybe better. Nice fresh resiny hops, a big sweet balancing malt bill, some minor pine notes, with a little bit of a yeasty flavor. Not too bad for my first wet hop beer. Mouthfeel was full and thick and quite a palate pleaser. Drinkability was quite good as well."
"drinkability is ok. this is one that i think needs some time for the bitterness to mellow. right now it's a little unbalanced and the bitterness lingers long after you taste it. the alcohol and malt backing are nice, and i can see this being great a year down the road."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. Aromas of hops and faint earthiness. In the taste, earthy, hoppy and somewhat sticky sweet. A smooth, yet watery mouthfeel and a small bitter aftertaste. Nice flavors, kind of light, yet easy to drink. A great seasonal!"
"Cheers"
"Certainly easy to drink the strongest point of this ale is the scent. Probably this is a bit over hyped; it is a good beer but not the best fresh hop ale around. Recommended but forget the hype about it."
"Good beer. I like this one a lot!"
"I bought two of these, and I think I'll go buy more tomorrow. 3.99 for a bomber of this is almost a steal!"
"d- Very drinkable, especially if you tend to be more of a hop-head. The fresh hops definately give a different impression to teh ber."
"I was expecting something closer to an IPA, but this creature is very original and gave me a good lesson on diversification of hop profiles. The overall spiciness of this brew lends itself nicely to the fall season (right now the leaves are almost peaked and it's sunny and 54F outside). A very interesting and unique pale ale with a very organic and earthy core. Good beer for certain."
"i'd reach for a fresh celebration just as fast as i reach for this beer. recommended, just don't expect what you've had in the past to show up in the bottle."
"D. Is it drinkable? Well, to answer that question, I went back and bought 4 more bottles for friends and I this weekend. A drinkable beer that makes me want to try even more fresh hopped brews."
"Final Note: Between this very tasty beer and cooler temperatures, I wish it was Fall year round."
"24 oz bottle pours an Amber color with clear, and sparkling body. thick, and fizzy light brown head rests on top of this one. Excellent lacing that lasts for a long while. Smell is citrus and earthy, grassy hops, with a little malty sweetness. Taste is malty sweet first, then the bitter feeling kicks in for a tiny bit. Mostly smooth with a strong lemon citrus prevalent. Soft carbonation with a watery mouthfeeling."
"Marvelously clear. Color is like bourbon-spiked iced tea. Kinda amber, nice, large bubbled head. Tiny carbonation bubbles floating up from the etched 'd.' Amazing. Scent is big, fat floral hops and citrus. Very clean scent. Now for the sip-- without a doubt, I've had nothing like this before. So clean, crisp, with a nice malt presence. Caramely. Hops are oily, flowery. Its bitter, but not rip your tongue out bitter. Nice lingering mellow hop tingle. I was expecting this to be way less drinkable than it actually is. I need to review this one later. I'm at a loss for words. A truly surprising beer."
"Clear and red in appearance, a thick creamy head sat firmly atop this brew. Aromas of rich hoppy oils, piney and lovely. Bitterness was not as high as I would have expected and played well with the malty sweetness - excellent balance. Great use of the hops... No questioning the oily goodness of these little animals... Nice job."
"Just picked up a case of this. 24Oz Bottle.Started out with a big fluffy head almost 2.5-3"" that lasted a good 4 minutes, Copper color, lots of lacing Very hoppy, almost like a IPA. Citrus, hops, Pine notes. Smooth and crisp could drink this all night, not overpowering. I have tried several new Beers this year and 2 stood out to me as being excellent. Stone IPA and this Sierra Nevada Harvest so this is one of my new favorites. Glad I got a case :)."
"This is a really easy beer to sit back and drink, its crisp and refreshing."
"I have never met a SN offering that wasn't perfectly balanced, extremely drinkable, and full of flavor, and this beer does not stray from this tradition. One of my favorite beers that I have tried this year. Highly recommended."
"Overall: It reminded me a little of their celebration ale, which is a good thing. An excellent brew, highly recommended."
"24 ounce bottle, 2007 edition, 6.7% ABV. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/red color with an inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both excellent. Smells mostly like citrus (grapefruit) and herbal hops with a bit of caramel malt too, the aroma is very nice. The taste is very good. Herbal and grapefruit hops dominate, but there's enough malt to balance it out. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's creamy and a bit oily. Drinkability is very good too, it's easy to drink and has just the right amount of carbonation. Alcohol isn't noticable at all. I'm very impressed with this beer. I'll definitely have to pick up another bottle of this soon!"
"What can I say. This is one of my favorite beers on draft and it's just as good in the bottle. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for finally making this available in bottles. Do yourself a favor and seek it out."
"Pours a nice mild copper color with a one finger head. Aroma is hard to describe but smells of fresh hops, with a mild grassy/floral touch. Taste is very nice and hoppy upfront with a bold maltiness as well. There's a nice dryness towards the back of the throat and a subtle bitterness as well. Definitely a beautiful ale with the type of dryness that I look for in a beer."
"D: This actually seems more like an IPA to me. Or maybe some of the IPA's I've had should really be PA's. Who knows? I do know that this Harvest Ale is really going down easy. The hoppyness is really refreshing, and just keeps you coming back for more. Excellent!"
"This beer is everything it is made out to be. Coming in I had high expectations and they were met. This is the highest review I have ever given a beer,"
"I've had this beer numerous times on draft and loved it. In the bottle it might be better since I'm drinking it so fresh. Best Fresh-Hop beer I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"Palate is prickly hoppy with a nice dry tart component towards the end. Malt is present but the atypical hops steal the show. Finish is pine cone like and quite satisfying."
"Pours a deep copper color with rocky off white head. Hop aroma is not dominate in the pour. I detect some slight hop bitterness and a light malty sweetness in the finish. Mouth feel is medium to light while drinkability is high-this is one of the easiest SN beers to drink-almost dangerous because it is so smooth and has a good balance of hops and malt."
"After hearing rave reviews about this for a couple years now, this wasn't as incredible as I hoped, and this from a SN fan. Not great, but very good. There was a heavy of hops flavor, with a lot of malt and caramel, and lots of bitterness and an aftertaste that lasted forever. This is the kind of beer you could sip one after another."
"Drinkability: phenominal is all I can say. I think this is my favorite Sierra Nevada beer. Easy to drink, great tasting, and one everyone should get there hands on."
"Pours a clear amberish copper with an adequate eggshell white head that dissipates quickly leaving sporadic lacing. The aroma is interesting. Spicy hop character and something resembling a hair salon. Don't know how else to describe that, but it is in your face. The taste is mostly about the hops, obviously, balanced by caramel malt. There is an aspirin-like after taste. In my opinion, this offering doesn't quite live up to expectations. I was hoping for a bit more bright hop character in the taste and aroma and was put off by whatever it is that reminds me of a hair salon."
"Drinkability is great. Wonderfully hoppy beer, that doesn't kick you upside the head with too much of anything. I'll be grabbing these from the store shelves as long as this is around. Very good stuff."
"Oh man, I wish I could have this baby all year round. Very, very nice hop forward pale ale that I could drink into the night and never get bored. Highly recommended. Bottoms up!"
"Very highly recommended, great beer for the summer"
"D- sessionable, nice balance, good flavors, great pale ale, easy drinking, recommended"
"A very welcome seasonal brew."
"Pours a clear bright copper-amber color with a thick white head that leaves heavy rings of lace on the sides of the glass as you drink. Nose is floral and grassy hops with notes of fresh pine. Fresh hops dominate the taste throughout with piney and citrusy notes but there is also a nice caramel malt backbone that holds everything together. I could sit and drink this all night."
"Bottom line... This may not be the most unusual or distinctive beer, but its really, really ""drinkable."" As I understand it, Harvest is essentially SN's Pale Ale, with extra hops - and I also understand that they make it only once a year. My keg was delivered in February - long after the harvest - yet showed no signs of age. Mouthfeel seemed a bit carbonated for my tastes, and the smell/taste wasn't blowing me away, but there is just something intangible about this beer. I don't get tired of it. It doesn't leave a bad aftertaste. This is a beer you can drink a lot of, yet its also a beer that you (well, I) really enjoy. Recommended, especially if you like hoppy beers."
"Beer poured a very nice clear dark amber with an exceptional creamy head, and left amazing lace on the side of the glass. The taste was very smooth with an initial sweetness up front, along with nice hope flavor, followed by a long-lasting bitterness once swallowed. The carbonation on this was very low, making it real smooth and mild up front. Definitely a good beer when looking for something with a little bitterness to it."
"Sampled at the Draught House on Saturday, October 14th, 2006."
"Appearance was a rich amber color with a nice heavy frothy white head. The brew smelled of a wonderful mix of piney and citrusy hops with a slight hint of malt. The taste was that of a sweet start, followed by a citrus takeover and a nice bitter finish. Extremely smooth beer with a nice fresh hoppiness and a hop dryness. Very drinkable and not too high in alcohol content. A wonderful brew I long for again."
"This is a very solid, drinkable beer for a fresh hop ale, and one which I'll get again in the future when it's available on tap, fresh."
"D - darn tasty beer and something I wouldn't mind drinking year round. Great example of what a brewer can do with a lot of hops -- without making the beer so syrupy and bitter that you can hardly drink it (e.g., Stone)."
"A ""darker"" complexion that their Pale, as I'm waxing poetic I'd call it chestnut-amber in color. Poured with a bare minimum of head, but I appreciated it while it lasted (thing is, the bartender poured the beer to damn-near overflowing!) Hops are earthy and herbaceous, spicy and subtle all at once - I really, really enjoyed the nose on this one, and let it sit for a good minute to warm and to take in its finer qualities. A bit skunky in a good way, too. Medium-bodied yet this drinks like a lighter bodied ale, and also tricks you into thinking it's smaller somehow; I'm thinking this happened because I let it warm a bit? The other thing is, last time I enjoyed this was in a smokey bar and now (thanks to anti-smoking efforts everywhere) no more smoke in bars to get in the way of me and my beer and this is *much* better than I remember as a result. Harvest Ale's alcohol is higher than Pale's but doesn't *seem* higher due to its unique body and texture. Mouthfeel is definitely creamy, juicy, but amply punctuated by spicy hops. Notes of honeydew melon and cherry from some of the tawnier malts used in this really give it some depth, especially as the hops add a familiar pineapple musk to this brew. And then there's the bitterness: piney, resiny, oily hops with a touch of stinging nettles, it's a bitterness that lingers on your palate like the acrid smoke of an old man's favorite pipe - even in a smokeless bar! Wonderful stuff, and makes me think a lot more highly of it than just ""the smaller brother of Celebration", even though there are some similarities. A heck of a deal too - it was 'Two for One' night . . ."
"Great APA all-around. For me, this isn't quite on the level of GD Fresh Hop, but it's one of my favorite APAs."
"Delicious, but sacrifices some drinkability due to the carbonation levels and hoppiness. That being said... I could certainly have my fair share of these over the course of a night."
"This is a drinkable beer. I think i;'s more akin to the IPA style, except for the absence of the thick chunky head found in an IPA. I would have SN Harvest again. It's a slightly more bitter version of the SN Pale Ale."
"this would be the perfect session beer although a bit expensive yet worth it"
"Not bad for an APA. I think the SN Pale ale is a better choice but this can stand its own. Worth a try, I says."
"D: I really prefer the fresh version...these type of beers don't historically age well."
"A clear copper/red beer with a foamy off-white head. Lots of little bubbles and great lacing. Nose is hops and grains. Taste is lots of hops up front, then bits of malt, and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. Could use more complexity. Mouthfeel is good, a bit foamy. Drinkability is good."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with light carbonation. The hops have a slight oilyness that prolongs the flavor. I could have drank this one all night long. I want some more! Please bottle this one for the masses."
"I really liked this beer. The smell and flavors were all there, like a bag of fresh hops in a glass. Bring on the next harvest!"
"If I could find this in bottles, I'd be all over it."
"Great beer. Go find it before you miss out."
"Man, this is one fresh hoppy beer. Served to me at Tyler's Taproom in Durham, NC in a standard shaker pint glass. Clear, pure orange color - the head leaves rings of lace on the glass and settles to a fine white velum sheet for the remainder of the beer. Smells of fresh citrus hops - candied and very sticky with oily lupulin goodness. Taste follows the smell very well...a big mouthfull of sticky fresh hops with some residual sweetness lingering on the tip of the tongue. Solid bitterness and medium mouthfeel. Mmmm-mmm good...did I mention fresh? Glad I got to try this!"
"This is about as balanced a highly hopped APA as I've had the pleasure to experience. The malt distributes just enough sweetness and fruit to counterbalance the energizing bite of wonderfully fresh hops. It's so damned good that I defy any hophead to have just one. This is a sessionable pleasure, a step above so much of what SN offers, and that's not to slight the others, but rather to extol the virtues of this pleasing, refreshing, edgy concotion. I often think scarcity is a big factor in making some beers as good as they seem, but this one would be as good no matter how available, so I say, bottle it now!"
"D: Quite a fine beer. If only this was as readily available as SNPA. Awesome."
"A very drinkable pale ale from Sierra Nevada."
"2007 bottle, dry but hoppy. Understated IPA, viz. pale. Lots of good head."
"Oh yeah, not overly hoppy, but thoroughly hoppy from start to finish - just barely enough malt backbone to support this freshly piney, cedar tasting/ smelling beer. Reddish color, like an ESB or Red. It's a shame that ""fresh-hop"" or ""wet-hop"" style beers can't be made year 'round, but I guess that is the joy of it. This style of beer is the prime example of why America is not wrong in evolving their own style of beers that showcase the considerable flavor/ aroma additions beers can benefit from with more aggressive hopping regimes. I generally tend to drink more malt accented beers, but when the depth of juicy dank fresh hops is present on the beginning, middle, and finish of the beer without seeming bitter or overly sticky, or unbalanced, then I have to stand at attention and salute."
"I was so excited about getting this fresh harvest ale the day it was tapped in Exton, PA. It was slightly more resin-y or oil-y than I remember it being last year. It tasted more alcohol-y as well. So I had a pint of the 2005 version (which the Drafting Room had as well) to compare, and I liked the 2005 version better. Aging this beer a year makes the taste improve remarkably."
"Overall: I am very impressed with this beer. Usually, I am a little unsatisfied with Sierra Nevada. This is definately an exception. If you see this beer, drink it. Outstanding."
"Seek this out now. I don't want to see any of those bad mid-summer next year reviews, this MUST be consumed fresh. Put this on your must-drink list today. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is like a very tasty middle ground between the SNPA & their Celebration Ale. This never seems to be available anywhere in my area, so I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"Nice mouthfeel and a hefty medium body, my guess for the ABV would be around 6%. This stuff is a pleasure to drink fresh on tap, it's got my vote!"
"Rare enough and downright good enough that you shouldn't pass it up if the opportunity should arise."
"I had this on tap at the Gingerman in New York. It poured a deep copper color with a tan fluffy head. The head left a nice delicate lace as I sipped the beer. The nose has a lot of citrus hop aroma, a little bit of hop flower with mild caramel. Citrus and floral taste. Nice mild caramel back. I have the Celebration Ale in the bottle, and this is a more subtle beer. Fresher taste (I realize a fresh tap should be that way), but I really like the way the hop flavor comes across without a huge amount of bitterness."
"Pours deep red with a creamy off-white head. Immediately as its poured, hops aroma hits me. Spicy, floral/piney, and especially hoppy aroma is refreshing... Maybe hints of apple. Spicy flavor fills mouth with bitter hops and notes of pine. Nice bitter finish lingers. Alcohol is subdued but noticable. Malt characteristics barely noticable but present. Finishes very bitter. Extensive lacing through whole beer as head diminishes slowly. Very lightly carbonated. Excellent and refreshing beer. Light moutfeel but not watery."
"I was very surprised to see this at one of our locals I had never seen it anyway in Georgia. This beer has a nice hoppy aroma with pine and orange. I couldn't really tell that this was brewed with ""green hops"". The aroma was very similar to Celebration, but not as hoppy. There was excellent lacing and a nice, firm head. The body was clear with a nice amber.orange color. There was moderate hop bitterness initially that became stronger. There was more of a malty smell and flavor than Celebration. The finish was long. It has a medium dry mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation."
"Body is perfectly medium, smooth, and oh so quaffable. I could drink this any time, anywhere. Too bad they don't bottle it."
"I love this beer. Even better than the only other fresh hop beer I've had (Great Divide Fresh Hop), but probably only due to the draught pour. I only wish these beers would come more than once a year."
"A dark amber colored beer with an off-white colored head that lingers for some time and leaves behind some lacing. Aromas of hops, grass, and dried fruit seem to be present. The taste is more like a cross between an Amber Ale and an American IPA. The first few sips make the beer seem well balanced with a nice malt presence that grows into a hop bitter taste. However, as the beer warms, the hops begin to dominate the malt with a fruity aftertaste that is enjoyable and evolving. The hop profile in this beer is closer to that of an IPA or even a Double IPA than a regular pale ale. Good drinkability."
"Had this on tap, first time I've been able to try it, side by side with the Celebration. Pours a very dark copper, darker than the Celebration, with a finger of off-white head, nice retention, and huge excellent lacing. Nose is all hops, mainly piney and resinous, but with some lighter floral notes too. Taste is wonderful, a slightly caramel malt upfront instantly bombarded with huge flavors of hops, fresh and green and piney tasting, some slight grapefruit, a nice lingering bittereness, absolutely superb. Medium bodied with a nice smooth mouthfeel, fairly active carbonation. This is a great pale ale, less hoppy than the Celebration, but with a fresher greener hop flavor. Great beer for hop lovers, wish they bottled this one, would pick it up in an instant."
"For some reason, I expected a beer with subtle hop character and limited flavor. I was all sorts of wrong on that. Initial scent is nothing but hops. Bountiful, beautiful hops  oh, how I love thee. Its very aromatic, quite floral  a little pine smell. The color is a dark dark brown, not terribly pretty. What it lacks in beauty is made up in taste. Truly amazing flavor: full of hoppiness  evenly distributed, well proportioned. The mouthfeel is perfect, finishing with a nice creaminess. This is a top-notch beer, find it and drink it!"
"This is much darker than the usual ""pale"" pale ale- deep amber with good head retention. The nose is filled with citrus, pine and grass aromas from the generous quantities of hops. Cascades are out in full force here, along with their regular West Coast pals. The extra bitterness combined with a hearty caramel malt backbone makes this the barley wine of pale ales. This is a terrific seasonal release from a brewery that knows a thing or two about pale ales."
"Overall a solid pale ale and nice drinkable brew. I just cannot ascertain much of a difference between the harvest and celebration. Subtley different."
"SN's Harvest Ale is one big bad-ass American pale ale. It has a great aroma and taste in which the malt and hops complement each other to the fullest. Drinkability is damn near off the scale. Great stuff worth seeking out."
"Thankfully on tap at Old Chicago in Eden Prairie, MN, served in a 25 oz. mug. Very dark bronze color, nice creamy tan head that lasts for about the first half of the beer. Smell is nice sweet, fresh hops, floral and sharp, with some malty sweetness going on in the background. Taste was great, I like it better than the SNPA that has been a benchmark of the style for years. The hops are robust and tangy, this was a nice surprise to find on tap at a place like Old Chicago (Their Minnesota beer of the month was Budweiser Select...). Highly drinkable and enjoyable, I would've gotten more, but there were still a number of good octoberfests on tap."
"The truest way to describe Harvest Ale is that it is basically an amped-up version of their flagship beer - the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. More hops, darker color, stronger scent, more bitter, more bite."
"All in all it was worth seeking this out. It doesn't seem as complex as their Celebration Ale...which I eagerly await."
"Pint, make that two pints, at Tylers in Durham, NC, yes, that is correct, we have the beer on tap in NC...HA!"
"Hop burps always help the drinkability of a beer! This is a very enjoyable quaff. It is tasty and refreshing it was kicking ass with my black bean and chicken quesadillas and I bet it would have been great with a cheesy cheese burger! The long aftertaste didnt let me forget the flavors. Yet another wonderful beer from SN, it is fairly complex for the style. The hop depth really elevates the palate over a typical APA or even an IPA. I sampled mine at the Crescent Moon in Omaha get some before it is all gone!"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. Almost carries over into the IPA category. Fairly well rounded. Would definitely get this one again."
"The smell is also good, with hops coming through strong on top of a solid malt base. The taste is good too, but seems a little plain by comparison. It's not too far off from their regular pale ale with some extra kick. The mouthfeel is good, and it's very easy to drink."
"Poured a light reddish ruby color with a creamy off white head that left nice lacing. It had a strong citrusy hop aroma. It tasted like strong hops, nice and citrusy, just like the aroma, with a slight malty backbone. The head lasted all the way down the glass. This was terrific!"
"12-9-07: 24oz. big bottle. Love the unique bottle and big size! This beer is as good as it's ever been and I'm glad to finally see it bottled. Big citric, piney hops all over the place in the aroma and flavor. Fresh, green with a sturdy smack of bitterness. I really can't say enough about how much I love this one. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for bottling this and I hope to see it again in the future."
"For a fall seasonal, they sure have it out early. Poured a clear amber colour with a good frothy head that quickly dissipated. Pretty hoppy aroma with earthy tones. Good balance between hop and malt flavours. A slightly bitter and dry finish. A very smooth and easy drinking beer."
"This is, yet again, another solid brew from SN, and I was elated to find it on tap as I've never seen it anywhere around these parts. Grab a pint if you can."
"This is one of my favorite brews from SN. There is a brewery that really puts out a fine array, quality across the board. This one stands out among their lineup. Brewed with fresh hops at harvest time, it has a wonderful floral aroma and rich, full malty body to carry the substantial but smooth herbal hop character. Part of the magic is that the hopping isn't wildly out of balance as you see in products from Stone where they like to use hops as a weapon. I just wish it could be put out year round. This is unquestionably a must-have for hop lovers."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability is very high. This was a really good APA. Not overboard on any one item like some many beers. Hop fueled for sure but copious amounts of malt really balance it well."
"Had this in a growler from Fingerlakes Beverage in Ithaca. Crystal clear golden/Amber body with a really nice thick, caramel head. Great retention, nice lacing down the entire glass. The aroma is hoppy as would be expected. The floral aroma is intense and quite nice. The taste is very clean and crisp. It's dominated by the hops, but they aren't overpowering. The taste of the hops is complex, it's not just a ""whack you over the head with all the hops we can"" taste. The drinkability is outstanding. I had this throughout a day of football, and I wish I had another growler when my first one was gone."
"One excellent american pale ale!"
"If I bought him a pint of this, I'm thinking he would've hurled when it first met his lips."
"A little overhopped to be interesting, in my opinion. This kind of fits as a slightly darker SNPA, or a slightly lighter Celebration Ale. More malt balance would really help this out."
"Bloody amber with a huge meringue-like head that leaves some damn good lacing on your glass. Aromas of fresh oily, piney, citrusy hop goodness, and a light whiff of french bread. The taste is super hoppy up front with an oily feel and a very piney flavor. The middle is slightly bready and the finish is dry, oily, and hoptastic. Mouthfeel is medium to full and oily, as mentioned, oh, and the drinkability is quite killer. This is almost like a cross between the SNPA and Celebration. Except the fresh, wet, hops that they use for this brew makes it a little more intense. An awesome brew from Sierra."
"Clear auburn red color with copper highlights. Smell is definitely hoppy and piney and has a sweet honey note to it. Taste has more of that hoppiness upfront in the form of citrus and grapefruit. There's a sticky caramel sweetness underneath that gets stronger and slightly stickier the further I go. Piney sharpness hits my tongue in a prickly way. Finish is hoppy and dry. A very good beer from SN, one that I could drink all night long, but I still think I like Founder's Harvest Ale better."
"Wow, this thing is like SNPA on crack, with more hops, more hops, and more hops. It has some nice biscuity malt, caramel flavors, which quickly gives way to a very bitter, resinous finish that feels like it's working the enamel on your teeth. On draft this was a really special treat. For thos of you that like the flavor of SNPA, but thinks it lacks balls, then here you go."
"This beer is a clear amber color, and it has a surprisingly long tasting tan head, at least for a draught beer. There is a fresh, herbal, hoppy character to this beer, and there is a hint of caramel to the nose as well. The taste is sharp and herbal, but there is perhaps a bit more malt character than is in the Celebration, I get note of caramel and biscuits. Of course this beer is about the hops, the hoppiness is quite sharp, definitely with an herbal quality to it, and it is just pungent. The sweet caramel like flavors of the malt mix with and, accentuate the orange-bergamot notes from the hops. The finish is fairly bitter, though this is a mix of traditional bitterness, and a contribution from the herbal hoppiness that is found in this beer. This is quite tasty, though it is perhaps a bit too green and herbal, though of course this is what this beer is all about."
"This had a copper body with about two fingers worth of white head. Head had decent retention and left some rings of lace around the glass. Aroma is full of hops with citric and grassy notes coming on strong. A good bit of malt is present as well to keep the balance. Taste comes across a bit hoppy with citric notes with balancing malt coming on almost as strong. Very well balanced and tasty brew that has a very clean crisp taste. Aftertaste is a bit hoppy with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with a very crisp feel to it. Drinkability can be defined by this stuff. This could almost be overly drinkable. All around excellent beer that I wish they would bottle."
"Drinkability: Nice solid seasonal selection to usher in cooler autumn temperatures"
"Had on tap at 'bones last night. Had to give the appearance a 5, as this has got to be the shiniest, clearest beer I've ever seen...it's like a diamond, all sparkle and shine. Color is an auburn shade, with a low white head. The beer comes across tastewise as Celebrations kid sister...lower hops all around, but still that good Sierra flavor. One interesting aspect is that the malt follows the hops tastewise, as opposed to the other way around. Very tasty. Like when you want Celebration in a much mellower style."
"Served in a pint, this beer has a light orange-copper hue and a decent head of 1.5"". Retention is somewhat better than average, and carbonation is ample. First thing about this beer: HOPS!!! The nose is very fresh, very green. Pine, some citrus. The taste is nice and clean, with a nice dry malt back and tons of fresh hop flavor. Very oily, very aromatic. Some orange flavors. This wasn't bitter, didn't have that grapefruit taste of some hop-monsters. Freshly hopped and nicely put together, this didn't weigh on the pallette or become boring. I'd give anything to find this on cask somewhere."
"Downy, big plume of initial head that just seemed to stick around for a good, long time. Coppery brown hue and clear with just some light action. To nose, some hop bite and an undertone of caramel and sweet wine which lent it a tart aspect. Initial hop flavor to taste, not overwhelming by any means, followed by a slight cotton candy sweetness and a filtered smokiness, like oak chips. Very easy on the mouth, this one is completely drinkable and stuporous-inducing."
"A grainy bed for hops. Bitter and citrusy hops. Grainy malt and lightly sticky. Bitter finish. Lightly fruity. Mouth is alternately crisp and sticky sweet. Really good stuff, wish they bottled it."
"This was served in a sampling glass from a tap. Poured a nice amber color with a short head that quickly died off, but left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very hoppy - citrus and pine aromas mostly. Very clean and fresh taste. Has a decent malt profile, but the hops take the main show, mostly citrus and grassy hops. Well-made beer, but I left this one wanting a little more. Not sure what, but it was slightly lacking in my book."
"Very drinkable. I will enjoy ordering it again."
"late october red with a tightly bubbled sticky tan head. crystal clear with small bubbles of carbonation. intensely green resinous hop aroma. wow, that is some fresh smelling beer. sturdy medium body, full and creamy while retaining some crispness. ample caramel malt backbone and bucketloads of cascade hop flavor. piney with orange peel and lemon notes. delicious and highly drinkable, if not very origninal, especially for SN. high marks for freshness."
"On at at Mugs Ale House in brooklyn. Bright clear amber. Creamy off-white head is sticky and wont leave the pint. Very approachable and attractive C-hops aroma is well complmented by caramelic malt. Foresty. This is indeed incredibly well done, superior balance. This is almost worth its reputation and puts a shame to the existence of SNPA. Bitterness is restrained, orangey, cascade-ish. Refreshing on the tongue, the ultimate green hops/malt combination, honey notes, very fresh. Of course its not incredibly complex, but among the style, this has to be close to my favorite. This has quality written all over it. The culminating point for me is the mouthfeel. First sip was shouting 5 for texture all over the place. This is perfectly creamy, very airy, smooth, round.. Yum Yum, easy quaffer even."
"Piney, not grassy, hops like I was expecting. Fresh, sappy, piney notes along with underlying light fruit notes. This version avoided the grassy, herbal and medicinal qualities that usually turn me off with wet hopped beers. I really enjoyed this."
"Overall: Another new brew from Sierra Nevada and one that I enjoyed, but at this point of the night I am not sure if I could picked this one out from its taste from some of the other SN offerings. Felt like a mix between the SNPA and Best Bitter."
"Note: I drank this as my ""control"" beer along with many Belgian ales. The Sierra Nevada, while not as exotic, definately stood up to the imports. In fact, it might have stood a little taller."
"Like the bartender said, this is definetely a Sierra Nevada product. But there is enough difference here to keep any beer fan interested. It has the Pale ale's hop-structure and the Celebration's big hoppiness, but it doesn't taste like a simple blend. This beer is in a class of its own."
"Tasty, but not quite what I was hoping for. I've never seen this beer in CT, so I wanted to try it. With everything else on the tap list, I would have made another selection, but it was certainly a good pint. I'd get it again as a session, were it to make a local guest appearance."
"A clear, dark amber colored beer. Pours a fine light tan head that rises up after the pour, and leaves a decent amount of lace. The aroma is all hops, mostly citrus. Damn smooth, very drinkable. Fresh hops dominate the flavor, but are not overpowering. This is a damn good beer."
"This is a good beer and I'll bet it would be killer with a sandwich, but it'd have to one heroic sandwich. The smell of the hops alone would make lesser sandwiches soil themselves and run screaming back to the deli. I enjoyed this pint in an only slightly masochistic way, but I can't credit it with too much drinkability."
"A nice cross between Pale and Celebration. Sweet with a spicy bite near the end, paired nicely with the Eggplant Rollitini I was having. Don't ever see this in bottles so I was thrilled to be able to have this one. Another fine brew from Sierra Nevada."
"I think it is safe to say that this beer is a more palatable and less floral version of their Pale Ale. It looks allmost identical and feels quite the same as far as mouthfeel goes, but the big difference is in the taste. The hops are a bit more bitter in this beer and there are also some spicy characteristics to it that I cannot put my finger on. The malt sneaks in and gives a peek but this a hoppy beer for sure. I will definantly come back to this one if I see it on tap again."
"Now....if this were only bottled, I'd be in heaven."
"Overall - Another excellent use of hops by Sierra. They really do it well. Most of their ales exhibit near perfect hop flavors and bitterness. This one is no exception. Picture this - 50 degrees and sunny. Farm tractor rumbling in the distance, fresh cut hay nearby, and your quaffing this tasty brew in quantity, while catching some late mid autumn rays."
" A medium bodied brew with light carbonation. Lots more flavor than their regular pale ale, and it is also a bit more spicy. This brew has a mild maltiness to it, but the hoppiness is the real story here. It is not by any means overpowering, but just has a nice pleasant bite to it. It is a bit refreshing, and the drinkability is excellent. This is a very solid drinker, and many people could enjoy a few at a sitting."
"A year later almost, and another growler is here. It just keeps getting better and better. I am in love with this brew (but don't tell my wonderful girlfriend, I still love her more anyways!)"
"I originally called this the ""Oktoberfest Pale Ale"" and it seems somewhat fitting. A simply fantastic beer, and unlike the bunch of cookie-cutter Oktoberfests out there, a unique take on a seasonal beer, and I can't wait for next year for this one!"
"The beer as its drawn from the tap pours a deep amber to copper color, the head modest in size and the texture frothy with the lace a concealing sheet. Nose is malt dominated with a nice underlying hop floral spiciness, crisp, fresh and a treat to the senses. Malt also controls the start, the top middling in feel, finish is walloping in its acidity, spanking in its hop spicy bite with the aftertaste dry and long lasting."
"A very drinkable brew... think I'll order another... god, I love the fall!"
"Drinkability: A nice aggressive pale ale, but not mad crazy insane or anything. I'd definitely have this again."
"Medium gold brown color. Small head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied pale ale, Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Nicely balanced. Fruity. It has the sweetness of a barley wine balance with the hop bite of a pale ale. Interesting. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"This is a fantastic, fresh, hoppy, creamy, sweet, malty, nutty joy of a beer."
"Wow, this is the best SN I've had. Copper color with a thick and foamy 1/2 inch beige head that corks the top of the glass. Light smell of citrus and hops belies the powerful flavor that lies beneath. The flavor hits the tongue all at once with a flourish of bright hops, citrus and pine. Mouthfeel is crisp and tingly. Big, fat flavor rolls all the way over the tongue and leaves a lingering hop bitter. I ripped through this pint because I needed to have that flavor constantly hitting my tastebuds. Why is this only a seasonal?"
"Originally sampled on 26 October 2002. Sierra Nevada's harvest ale has a harvest gold/red color (imagine that). The flavor has lots of up front hops. However, it finishes very smoothly. It's a shame that they don't sell it year round in bottles. It is an exceptional beer. It's extremely drinkable."
"The drinkability is good here. Like all other SN offerings, this one is a class act."
"Amber colored with an adequately sized, off-white frothy head. Aroma is mainly malty but with a crisp fruity hop presence. Medium bodied in the mouth with a *very* fresh hop presence throughout. A bit of biscuity malt struggles to make itself notices, but the overwhelming flavor is a grassy, citric Cascade hop flavor. Finish is dry, with a long lasting acidic aftertaste. Quite a treat!"
"Had on draft on numerous occassions from 10/1/02 to 1/11/03. Wet hopping of the freshest hops available in the hands of craftsmen, like the SN brewers, makes this brew a ""hopheads delight."" Lacin was minimal. A clear, amber appearence with a small off-white head is present. The nose is this unmistakable hoppy bouquet. There is this refreshing mouthful of a this piney, but slighly critic taste this is immediately evident. However, the mild malty finish enhances the overall drinkabilty of this brew. A seasonal brew that should be and only be available on draft."
"Pours a great copper color with a slightly off white head that holds pretty well, and leaves significant lace. Overwhealming aroma of hops(thats not a bad thing). At first, I was waiting for the finish, a little more malt was expected. It wasn't there. Good hop finish, but not what I was expecting. I think I went into this with high expectations. I love everything from Sierra. Still, a good ale."
"6.3% ABV as indicated by the keg cap. Clear, copper in color with a very creamy and dense, 1/4"" tight-bubbled tan head that holds really well and leaves very nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is like opening a bag of fresh whole leaf hops! Stunning. Slightly sweet Cascades. It's hard to find the malt through the hop aroma. The body is medium with a  very fine carbonation, giving a zesty mouthfeel that becomes creamy as it warms. The flavor is of a rich, lightly sweet, somewhat biscuity and brightly caramel malt entwined with restrained, grassy & lightly citrusy hop flavors. The hops are all in the nose! And that's not easy to do - very well brewed! Nor is the bitterness overdone. Very well balanced allowing malt and hop flavors to come through unhindered! An extremely nice and incredibly enjoyable beer that is absolutely worth seeking out. Draft only."
"Great deep copper color in the glass with a respectable head which left a nice lacy residue on the sides of the glass marking each consecutive sip.  Earthy on the nose.  The hops take front row in the flavor, as could be expected.  Underlying the hops is an earthy warmth with a touch of citrus to balance out the experience.  Full mouthfeel, plenty of body, and a good long finish.  Somewhat pungent at first sip but still quite drinkable.  Good fall quencher."
"Wow! This is hopped up for 2001! Beautiful, deep reddish color. Superbly balanced. Far better than any previous years, IMHO."
