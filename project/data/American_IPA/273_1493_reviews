"Hard to beat! Perfect balance, incredible smell and great price.  One of the best IPA's ever to be brewed in the south. Try it! 4.80"
""
"Quite possibly one of the most well balanced IPAs ever."
""
"T: orange up front, bitter aftertaste that leaves you thirsty for more. Approaching singular citrusy flavoring, not very complex still one of the better iPa's that I've seen at most non microbrew carrying grocery stores. Would buy again but usually if either stone or something a bit more appealing to my particular taste weren't available."
""
""
""
"This is what I had hoped Delicious IPA would be, lemony hops but without the cloying aftertaste."
"Pours a dark golden yellow with a frothy white head. The smell is very hoppy, sweet, with nice citrus notes. Unfortunately, the smell isn't very aromatic.  The taste compensates with a big flavor, hoppy up front,  slightly bitter on the finish that sticks around. A nice medium body, the mouthfeel is not as smooth as it could be, but it still adds a great dimension to the beer. Overall a nice ipa, very enjoyable."

"I've long wanted to sample some of the offerings from SweetWater, but their non-presence in Chicago left that want unsatisfied. However, SweetWater distro just reached the Chicagoland area and I'm glad they did! This is a very solid IPA, nothing that screams mind blowing, but well balanced and interesting enough to make this adding to my list of go-to IPAs."

"Great IPA!  Safe bet when you want a great tasting beer at a decent price."

"Great beer the after taste for me is weird, although it's great."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Lacing is good.  There is a lot of precipitate.  Has a fresh citrus aroma; grapefruit, lemon, resin.  Malty taste up front with a piney hop burst at the end.  A grapefruit/lemon aftertaste predominates.  Mild soapy astringency but not overwhelming.  Perfect amount.  Great beer.  Glad to have them in Texas now."

"Poured into the Spiegelau. 4/19/15 enjoy by date. Weed joke, or actual freshness date, I don't rightly know... but I do know that I can't pick fresh IPAs with a gun to my head. 3 fingers of beige head on a golden body, crystal clear (despite being marketed as unfiltered). Astringent pine on the sinuses, bitterness, and an alarming savory hop note (comes off as a cheese aroma to me, more interesting than off-putting, but definitely from the 'dank/earthy' hop varieties; have gotten the same aromas in Six-Point Hi-Res and a couple of others that escape me at the moment; more of a headscratcher than a deal breaker). Clean bitterness on the front of the palate, bit of that dank hop note on the finish. Average IPA mouthfeel with a couple of slightly odd lingering flavors (yeasty bit). Nothing special in the wide world of IPAs, but I wouldn't refuse a fresh bottle at a BBQ. Wouldn't trade my firstborn for one though."

"Pours with a dense white head and an amber color.  Awesome hoppy aroma.  Head dies down to amber light cover that laces well.  Not too bitter.  A very good IPA"

"L: 1inch of white pillow-like layer of head, and a body color of hazy orange, and this beer left a beautiful spider web of lacing around my glass.  Smell: Wonderful citrus, grassy and hoppy aroma. Taste: A great complexity of a earthy hoppy flavor up-front, with a very clean finish at the end. M. Feel: Very carbonated, which helped pronounced the flavors even more; This beer, lets you know that it's a beer. Great American IPA, right now it's my favorite"
"Wow sweet citrus followed by balanced mouthy aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Golden color, floral aroma, lighter in taste. The hops are not over powering and it finishes off with a crips mouth feel. The beer really does not stand out to me. Still a good ipa."
""
"My rating: 3.60"
""
""
"Ok. Citrus comes through strong in smell and taste. Not much else. Citrus overwhelms. Meh."
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice smooth IPA...mine was a bit flat, but I think I attribute that to the poor tap at the tavern where I purchased.  Overall, a drinkable thumbs up."
"Not a bad local brew,"
"Still has that traditional grapefuit taste to it that sweetwater does, but a little more pronounced. A fantastic sipping beer and tastes like a quality beer for the money. if you like IPA's and haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and pick one or a couple up. Definately a recommend."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/5/2015. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Outstanding aromas with awesome complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Ordered draft at a restaurant, when it arrived there was decent lacing left.  Smell was good, not an over-hopped monster, not too much malt.  The beer was yellow gold, neither of either.  Taste and mouth feel were very good.  I had one with my meal and another after while my wife finished.  This is a very good beer."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. A golden orange with lots of hazy particles sizable dark yellowish head that leaves lot of lace. Citrus and pine nose, mild caramel and toffee. Taste is solid east coast. Caramel malt sweetness pine hops citrus finish. Medium body light but effective carbonation. Quite quenching and drinkable. A solid got to IPA."
""
"Was fairly impressed with this brew. I have not had a sweetwater  beer before and this wasa good first experience. lighter orange color, good hop aroma. mouthfeel was crips and refreshing. overall a solid effort for what is now a lower ABV IPA"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, hops, pine. Taste is hops, minty, piney, mild bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but I was expecting more."

"Pours a mostly clear orange, not too much carbonation, frothy pure white head. Smells delicious, very potent nose on this guy, very juicy pine hops, slightly citrusty with some grapefruit. Taste is very similar, mostly piney hops coming through, goes down nice and easy, very smooth. This is a good beer I really enjoy it."
""
"This is a great beer, but I am not getting the ""hop bomb"" angle on it.  Hops on the nose and front of the palate are definitely there, with dominant grapefruit and a bit of sour apple.  The beer's body is where it differs from a typical IPA, though.  The hopping doesn't seem heavy in the boil, leading to a some sweetness after a couple sips.  While the bitterness of many IPAs can get cloying, the balance of a sharp hop nose and sweeter body make this really drinkable.  My wife, who typically tends towards sweeter beers and shies away from bitterness even in food, found the grapefruit element refreshing.  A great beer and really unique."

"This was the first Sweet Water beer I've had. To be honest I was expecting more. There's nothing off with the beer but it's lacking in the flavor and aroma that I expect in an American IPA. The nose was very muted and it appeared to be hopped along the lines of a pale ale. I perceived the flavors I expect in an IPA, but it didn't burst with flavor. Not a bad beer, but nothing warrants another buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid IPA. I agree with BB1313 the nose is easily the best part. If the tropical fruit was more prevalent on the palate this would be outstanding. Still definitely worth a try & glad to have it available in Ohio"

"The aromas steal the show, but everything else is on point. This is a very nice IPA, especially at its price-point. I understand why this beer was always reguarded as one of the better IPAs in the past. This was something that was ahead of its time at one point. Maybe other breweries have caught up and eclipsed this, but this still holds up as a winner in the world of IPAs. I like it."
""
"this is my kind of beer. dank, resinous, piney...in the vein of lagunitas, racer 5, and stone. well done, excited to try their other seasonal ipas"

"Hard to believe this is 6.3% ABV. Extremely smooth, very drinkable. Unlike other IPA's that are similar ABV I don't feel the need for a glass of water after every glass of beer."
"Very tasty IPA."

"Had this in cans while on vaca in the smokey mountains...took a sixer with me fly fishing and this beer was such a treat to have, I felt guilty that I actually found a great beer while on vacation. Usually settling for some macro crap. Thanks for the great day guys. Word, Atlanta! whodathunk."

"BBD 9/15/14. Clear medium amber pour with a very faint ruby tint. Excellent head, lacing and retention. Very nice nose of grapefruit and tropical (mango) with a touch of spice and pine over a very light biscuit. Medium bodied with a normal carbonation level that imparts a bit of effervescence on the finish. Nice balanced flavor profile with a bit of hop complexity in a blended fashion. It begins with the flavors of the nose then flows into a mild bitterness. The finish is dry, not quite crisp, and leaves you with a light grapefruit rind bitterness and a touch of spice."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with a flurry of cascading bubbles and a one inch billowy foamy head. Leaves a slight amount of lacing along the glass. The smell -- grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit! Also subtle hints of mango in there. Really nice. Grapefruit is also the overwhelming quality of the taste. Nice level of carbonation. Really fresh tasting beer. I had one on 8/7 that had a Best Buy date of 8/17 and it felt like I was drinking this right at a brewery. Really solid IPA. For a 6.3% ABV, very easy to drink."

"Transparent orange with a single finger of fuzzy head. Not a particularly strong scent but a pleasant fruitiness. Probably the beers strongest trait. Not a harsh bitterness but reminds me of tree bark. A bit sour. Not so fruity for an IPA. Dry mouthfeel. Decent but odd."

"Overall, a reasonable take on IPA, but as the market continues to flood with them, and many really good ones, this one just probably just middle of the pack. That said, the fishing boat artwork on the can does seem to match the fact that I'd gladly take this on on a hot summer day floating down the river or out on the lake. Low bitterness and a nice gentle hop characteristic would make for easy summer drinking."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker, the beer is a hazy, vibrant, copper coloring with a tall, foamy, off-white head. Aromas of rich and sweet caramel, tart citrus fruits (grapefruit and lemon), bitter hops aromas, subtle pine pitch, and subtle spice. Flavors are a well blended blast of grapefruit, resinous piney hops, and a caramel backbone. Cut grass, pine tassels, and hints of evergreen build as you go. Despite all the robust flavors, the body stays light and crisp. A tart, bitter, dry aftertaste loaded with hops characteristics and citrus highlights. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry, as well. Very well put together, drinkable IPA. Bravo!"
"Thankfully, I can still get Lagunitas out here."

""
""
""

"Taste is a big citrus punch of a little lemon and lots of grapefruit - bitter, sweet, and delicious. It has some minor earthy undertones and the whole thing is hung on a thin malt backbone only slightly detected. A very nice American India Pale Ale."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of floral hops, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight floral hops, strong citrus hops, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and slight alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."

"Overall- A pleasant, easy and smooth drinking IPA. Not an IBU or high alpha stronghold but not a wash, either. At 7% it's really not a session ale for me and doesn't have quite a unique or bold taste for a beer I'd relax with at the end of the day. So, for me, it doesn't have a place in my fridge as a regular resident but it's not a bad choice if you're on the go and looking for something less expensive and yet enjoyable. Probably good for a day in the sun or on the lake when you just don't want a massive IPA."

"O: This one really hit the spot, more than I anticipated it to. It's one of the more refreshing IPAs I've drank in a while (I've drank many of them recently, keep in mind), and it's just so drinkable without having to resort to being hop water. I'd drink it again, absolutely."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very accessible IPA (you can find it in almost any grocery store in South Florida, despite the limited and behind but ascending craft beer scene here). It's a great staple. It's a great blend of both West Coast and East coast IPAs. The citrus/floral aspect does not completely overpower the beer like some west coast varieties, and neither does the malt like east coast. A very solid, staple choice in your rotation."
""
""
""
""
"Still, for the price and availability, it is a good IPA. It won't knock your socks off, but you can have more than a few and won't get tired of it."
""
"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this brew is its aroma and its drinkability. The nose seems to have been the muse for Founders All Day IPA, as they are quite similar in base, but with more booze and medicinal bite here. That said, however, the flavoring does cheapen up a bit in the grain profile, causing the hops to come across, themselves, as a bit hollow and skeletonized. This takes the balance off in a direction that we were not too eager to follow, although we were ultimately pleased with the big picture of the beer as a whole. This is a beverage for some fun outdoor activities in the sun, and nobody can argue with how easy it slugs back. This is an excellent beer if you’re all about sippin’ and relaxin’, but if you linger too long and begin to dissect it out, you might find some unwelcomed and simplified layers here and there."

"a well made if a tad generic india pale ale from the great state of georgia. richer bronze color to this, mostly clear, with an inch of pure white head that slowly settles down. it smells like cascade hops, higher alpha but overly common, the classic mix of hop bitterness and juicy punch. malt base is bigger than average and lends some biscuity aromatics, although its flavor is far more subdued. a fuller bodied gulp shows nice carbonation and a long hoppy finish that moves from lightly citric to quite bitter. well done, but the varietals used could be a little more unique i think. this is basic american ipa, well crafted, but not particularly intriguing. a good sixer to drink down thoughtlessly coming from one of the better known georgia beer makers. curious to try their other stuff though, this was good, but couldnt hold my attention past one."

"O-Very good ipa with great flavor and finish. Definitely top 5-10, but a notch below Celebration Ale. At $15-$16 for a 12-pack, this beer is in my regular rotation. This beer also scores above average on the hangover so drink your fluids."

"This IPA is a brightly shining clear amber. Gentle bubbling rises from the glass's bottom for the duration. The head is very nearly white, a bit spritzy though it has a thick, creamy texture. Lace is moderate, a thin ring at the top with spotting to follow. Slightly mineral undertones lie beneath perfume and floral bitterness with light fruity esters and breads. Ruby red grapefruit, orange zest, lemon peel, and floral bitterness show a hoppiness not foreseen in the aroma, strong and straightforward with most of the balance coming from a hint of sugared fruits and some bready malts. There's a strong crispness in a medium body with plenty of smoothness running over the tongue and into the finish with a mildly lingering bitterness."
""
""
"Overall a really nice IPA. The big hop aromas had me hoping for more than what the flavor delivered but still pretty solid in general. If I wanted an IPA this wouldn't be my first choice but I can see drinking it from time to time. Very drinkable."

"This beer was a complete surprise. This proves convincingly that a world class AIPA doesn't have to come from CA or VT. First, when uncapping the bottle the first thing that hits you is the aroma. There is hop cloud released with citrusy, resiny notes. No doubt dry hopped at a high level and certainly with a Cascade, Simcoe blend. The appearance was good clarity, a deep golden color, little head retention and no noticeable lacing on the way down. On the tongue it starts with a grassy presence, leveling out to a little alcohol tinge and finishing with a lingering grapefruit bitterness. Well balanced and extremely drinkable. One of my top 5 all time AIPA examples. Excellent!!"

"Very delicious fruity smelling ipa. I tried it because they were out of dogfish head so I figured I'd give it a shot. Wow I was shocked at just how good this ipa is! I'm a beginner when it comes to ipa's and beer in general really, but man I get alot of pineapple and some grapefruit with just a little pine on the back. I will definitely keep this in my fridge I need to try their other beers."

"Citrusy unfiltered IPA that tastes like an above average West Coast IPA. Delicious with a decent head, hop with grapefruit forward and a great finish. Clean in appearance despite being unfiltered. One of the few east coast IPAs that can compete with the left coast."

"The head that I initially created was a finger-and-a-half of tawny foam, but it fell as I was typing, leaving great sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-amber with just the slightest haze (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose had a pine resinous scent that was perfect for post-season baseball. Pine tar and baseball just go together. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops bite was immediate. It was not as much of a kick in the teeth as they might have liked (and I have had those, both literally and figuratively), but this hophead was getting his groove on. The lacing was ongoing and unabating. Finish was semi-dry, very pine-like and a welcome addition to my afternoon."

"This beer has a burnt orange color body, with a small, foamy head. The aroma has a piney notes. The taste is of piney hops and some malt. I also get some citrus also. The mouthfeel is well balanced and very drinkable. Overall this a really good ipa, wish I could it up here in Pa."

"Nice IPA here, nothing to blow you away but very refreshing and citrusy which is something I like! I do prefer there 420 pale which I also had for the first time tonight but this is also very nice. Sweetwater continues to impress!"
""
""
""
""
""
"More earthy and grassy than citrusy, it's like a Chilean sauvignon blanc vs a Marlborough sb. There's enough citrus to add intrigue, but not dominate. Malt is present and identifiable for somewhat more than support. Probably the best I've had from Sweetwater."
""
""
""
""
"While a decent IPA from the South, these simply don't stack up to the hop bombs brewed on the West Coast. Moderate bitterness, somewhat faded citrus hops in the background, and sweet, caramel malts. Nothing bad, and well made, but disappointing as well. Decent enough, but unexciting. Regardless, I'm very glad I got to try this."
""
"Overall- Pretty good IPA, not your typical hop bomb though. Strong grapefruit flavor with very little malt character."

"Overall: Sweetwater IPA is a solid interpretation of the style. Nice hop profile, and a lighter body. Thanks Scarci for sending me the samples!"
"Overall 4.0: Great IPA. Excellent balance of malt and hops. Also, the hops that were selected for this beer are an excellent and complementary blend. The label says it was dry-hopped, which no-doubt added to the excellent bouquet. This is definitely an IPA that IPA lovers should try. It may not appeal to non hop-heads due to its level of carbonation, but they should give it a shot, too."

"This is a really nice, hoppy beer, though it's much heavier on the aromatic hops than the bitter. More in the realm of what brewers have been calling dry-hopped APAs. But whatever. It's fruity, it's dry, and it's tasty."

"Hazed tanned leather with a solid fine sheet of light tan foam. Smells like mangoes, light malt, some bits of bubble gum, and more mango. Although pretty one dimensional, the fruity character of the nose is really nice. Flavor follows through a bit more malt balanced with some light bitterness, hints of wood and still plenty of fruity sweet mango with a touch of grapefruit pith. Medium on full bodied for the style with a light, fine carbonation and a wet finish. I bet this hits the spot on a hot southern day."

"O. High quality IPA. This is a fine example of the American version of the style."
"This isn't my first time with this beer. I've had it on tap and bottle before and just got a sixer. Its a tad old but still pretty fresh. It pours a hazy orange brown with a two finger head of large bubbles. There are hints of carbonation rising to the top. Nice lacing. Head fades within a couple of minutes. Right from the start you get a combination of sweetness and hops. The hop bite isn't quite as large as other times I've had it, but has a large body to it. Hints of lemon and grapefruit. The finish has more of the hop bite. It has a very refreshing feel to it and should be best enjoyed after a lot of man sweating. Overall a seriously good IPA."

"O - It's a slightly above average beer. Maybe I am spoiled by big flavored IPA's, but this one seems a little weak to me."

"A champion, citrussy IPA - very surprised to see that this is EKG and not something like Centennial. Malt is there and the IBUs are not huge - very East Coast that way. I could sit with this one all day."

""
""
"This beer is not as hop- infused as others of its style, but it does have many positive qualities. It offers a more unique twist on the style and makes a good option for the craft beer curious who want to like IPA, but cannot make the palate leap to the 90+ IBU level. Try it if you can find it- you should like what you discover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts with a neutral malt flavor, but the prickly and peppery hop kicks in quickly. The aftertaste is shorter than one might expect given the biting finish. The body is middle of the road as is the carbonation level."
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty average beer. I suggest a try"
""
""
""
""
"Now, with that said it could use a bit more diversity in the aroma, but otherwise, not bad."
"Overall: slightly better than average, you can do better but for the price you could do worse."

"O: As I drink this in a hotel room in rural Georgia I've got to say this a very enjoyable IPA. Definatly want to drink it before the date on the bottle since its dry hopped. Only my second beer from sweetwater and its a winner."

"12oz: Hazy golden color, small white head that settles quickly. Good lacing. Grapefruit aroma with a touch of spiciness. Dried apricot sweetness also in the nose. A very nice aroma. Taste is very sweet with just the right amount of bittering for an IPA. Hops taste more floral than the citrusy aroma promised. The finish is long and steady with no odd tangents. Texture is a little sticky. Carbonation is above average - biting. The carbonation gives the beer a refreshing quality. A nice IPA the selection of hops (Columbia for bittering, and Golding for aroma) made this IPA interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably a bit old at this point, but still a very solid and highly drinkable IPA. Proves the point that a hoppy beer should have a solid malt base to hold up to a bit of age."
" I'm surprised Sweetwater got their IPA right. I have not been too impressed with their other beer, but they hit a home-run with this one."
""
""
"Overall – My kind of IPA.. lots of fruity juicy flavours. I'd like a little more in the hop department, but this is still a beer that I'd be happy drinking the rest of my life."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why I don't drink this more often. It's a relatively cheap, year-round, widely available (even in local Walmarts and grocery chains) and freakin good IPAa but I only buy a sixer maybe once a year. Definately the best availabe local IPA and can hold it's own against most of the big boys (Two Hearted, Jai Alai, Centenial). Very much worth trying if you aren't already familiar."

"Received this in a BIF from hippityhophead24! Label clearly states that it's best if enjoyed by 02/18/13. Clear amber body produces a thin loosely bubbled head that leaves some spider web like lacing. Aroma is pretty one dimensional. Grapefruit hops overpower anything else that might be in this beer. Taste is very grapefruity as well. Although some caramel sweetness and maybe a hint of cracker poke thru. Carbonation is decent but this just feels a little thin and watery for an IPA. Long bone dry finish with more of that dry plain cracker on the finish. Overall this is a good IPA that is easy to drink. Just seems a little too one dimensional to get the praise that the big boys get nation wide."
"A down-the-drainer, I can't believe it gets so many good reviews."
"O: Overall this beer is very well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops. The beer is easy to drink with the very enjoyable hop flavors and I would definitely have a couple of these in a session."

"Overall (4.0): This beer is, above all else, an easy-drinking, straight-forward, reliable IPA. They’re not pulling any punches with this beer, and it does everything an IPA should do without ever coming off as out of whack in any regard: the hops are relatively one-dimensional but solid and not overly harsh, the malt is solid enough but neither too sweet or too toasted, and the hops are always front and center. Solid everyday (hoppy) drinker."
""
"This beer pours a light amber/deep gold with a one finger head, poor retention, and some lacing left behind. Hazy in appearance, there is some very small particles of suspended yeast in it. Smell is floral, pine, and citrus. Taste follows the nose basically. Balance is excellent between sweet and bitter. The taste is not in your face and is one of the weaker tasting IPAs that I've had. But it is a good one and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is nice with a pleasing mild aftertaste. I'd try this one if you never have. Not the best ever, but a nice offering nonetheless."
""
""
"Overall not bad I got this mixed and matched for $1.75. Not bad overall."

"Sweetwater IPA pours a lightly hazy orange, with scant tangerine highlights poking through. Maybe a finger of white foam crowns the beer and hangs around for just a minute or two. Lacing is hard to come by though. The nose is nice, with just a bit of a bready note mostly failing to pull my attention away from the bouquet of tangerine and grapefruit peel wafting out of the glass. The already slight maltiness from the aroma pretty much disappears in the flavor profile. I'm all for a dry, hop forward IPA, but there needs to be at least a little bit of a malt presence to serve as a baseline. The mildly assertive bitterness and potent grapefruit and tangerine citrus finish are all nice, but there's nothing for them to play off of. The body is nice and dry for the style, but the carbonation just lacks energy, and doesn't pop as much as it should. Sweetwater IPA is a decent brew that, with a couple minor tweaks, could be one of the better IPAs brewed on the east coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an above-average IPA. There are better options out there. And while I'm drinking this almost two months before its best-by date, I can't help but wonder if this bottle isn't as fresh as it could be. I'd love to try a really fresh bottle and re-visit my review."

"I wish this beer came around in New Jersey because it'd be a regular for sure. The citrus and lemon quality to this beer is unreal. Its almost as juicy as juice and thats all from the hops. Very impressive beer. This beer is a perfect IPA in my opinion."
""
""
"This is a really good IPA. Poured a nice white 2 finger head from the bottle to a pint glass. Overall, you can really taste the piney hop-kick followed by typical IPA bitterness. For me, it's not a chugging beer nor one I could drink all night. But for a good IPA, you can't go wrong with this one."

"Overall: Delicious IPA. I am liking what this brewery has to offer."
""
"In my opinion this is epitome of what an IPA should fundamentally resemble. It's not the greatest but a very good example of the style. It has a good appearance with a half inch head and lacing that hangs around throughout. The nose is a combination of hops and malts that's blended very well. The tongue gives way to hops with a hop/malt backbone. The mouthfeel is moderated with a dry finish. Really like this IPA and will indulge these more. Can't wait to get a growler of this soon. Cheers."

"Overall: Immensely pleasant. Not over the top like most California IPA's, and not bitter piney like many others. There are not too many IPA's that I would want to sit down with a 6-pack of, but this is one of them. Impressive for an unfiltered IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Seems like it would be an ok session or lake beer. The word that kept popping into my mind while drinking it was ""muted"" - muted smells, muted flavors, muted mouthfeel. Everything was there, only weaker than most IPAs I've tried. Almost watered down."

"Overall: As an Atlanta native having access to any kind of Sweetwater brew, I would definitely say this is my favorite beer this brewery puts out. Would love to try an imperial from them--have heard certain ""Dank Tanks"" are delicious. This beer is a reasonably priced ""go to"" beer if you are at the store and not sure what to get--it doesn't let you down. Very enjoyable, solid beer. Recommend to all, not just hop heads."

"Pours bright orange with a foamy beige head. The aroma is intense resin, pine and floral hops, with some hay and bread notes. The flavor is very bitter and well balanced up front, with the bitterness dominating the finish. The palate is medium to heavy, sticky, acidic and astringent. The aftertaste is long, very bitter and acidic. Overall, this is a good IPA."
""

"Just had another Sweetwater IPA! Incredibly smooth. Reminds me of home."
"On tap at Dragonfly in Gainesville. Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a nice white creamy head. Aroma is nice light citrus and honey, very pleasant and seems nice and light and easy drinking. Flavor follows that trend with light pale malt sweetness and pleasant citrus notes and lemon peel on on the palate. Medium high carbonation with a crisp clean finish. Very nice brew, really easy drinking, and great southern warm weather beer."

"Poured from bottles best by 3/27/12 the beer appears a brilliant golden brownish color with a nice 2 finger white head, some retention, and good lacing. Somewhat murky. The nose is fruity sweet with citrus hop character. Very appealing. The flavor is more powerful than the nose, a nice blast of citrus fruity sweetness and hop character immediately. Medium bitterness. As the beer warms it becomes more balances with the sweet malt and hops. Lighter end of medium bodied and a bit chewy. Easy to drink and refreshing. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise! It is a treat, I'd recommend it for sure!"

"12 ounce bottle courtesy of markwise. Pours a bruised peach color with a solid ecru head. Aroma is fruity and malty, pineapple and grapefruit at the fore with canned peaches and cornbread. Flavor is also pretty fruity, with the peaches coming on a little stronger alongside the emergence of crystal malt. Somewhat lacking in bitterness. A pretty decent beer, but one that might be better off calling itself a pale ale."

"O - this is a very tasty, sweet ipa which is something i'm not used to. light tasting and easy flowing with nice abv% makes it perfectly balanced."
""
"I was psyched when I saw this beer included in my beer-of-the-month selection! I've read such good things about it. Pours a golden orange, tons of sediment floating around in it. Nice. Smells slightly of citrus. Taste follows the nose. Not overwhelming, but a very solid IPA-ish taste. Overall, a very good IPA. I would buy a sixpack if it was available. Nicely balanced between hops and malt."
"Overall a very light hopped IPA with the complexity kept to a minimum. That being said it was nice and refreshing and had a great drinkability."

"Overall, I like this beer a good deal. I've tasted it before with a marketeer from Sweetwater, but I think this bottle is fresher. A very solid IPA that I'd be buying in quantity if I lived in the South."

"O: A pretty decent, ""sessionable"" IPA. While it's not something I'd go out of my way to get my hands on, I'd like to try it fresh someday at the brewery. I didn't notice any real flaws, and would recommend you try it for yourself if you have the chance."

"Many thanks to ahlthe3rd (Hugh) for the chance to taste this. I have had it on tap in Atlanta before, but never in bottle format. Bottle dated ""Best before 3-02-12", so assuming pretty fresh. Poured from bottle into my Victory tulip. Pours a rich and completely transparent orange color- on the darker side for an IPA. Smell- an interesting hop aroma- blood orange, grapefruit. Taste- a blast of bitterness hits the front of my palate. Waves and waves of bitterness without a real malt backbone. I love IPA's and love a hop forward IPA, but this lacks balance. Its wave upon wave of bitterness without anything sweet to counter. Very medium to light bodied, the mouthfeel is light and airy. This IPA would be better if the malt developed some tropical fruit sweetness, but it's still a decent IPA regardless that I would have again."
""
"Overall: Decent, but not earth shattering. The bitterness and intense grapefruit/orange flavors drop some of its long-term drinkability. Definitely a unique hop profile."
""
""
"O: This is a classic American IPA no doubt about it."
""
""
""

"A nice IPA overall, very crisp and satisfying.  At first sip I was ""meh"" but as I'm finishing my glass, this turns out to be a pretty good IPA. I'm sure I'd buy it if it were local."

"O: Not an overly memorable brew. Flavor is a little lacking, as is the smell."
""
""
"This is my favorite Sweetwater offering and is one of my go to IPA's. The combination of taste, price and availability can't be beat in this area."
""
""
"Slightly chalky, oxidized, citrus IPA that is bready and well balanced. I bet this would be much better fresh nearer the brewery, but it is still good. Interesting citra type flavor that is nice if not exactly my preference."
""
""
"The taste has enough hops to at least slightly satisfy a hophead, but it has a very strong citrus flavor. It is definitely a good flavor, but the amount of fruit in the taste is stronger than I have ever had in an IPA before. I feel like some will love this beer, while others will not really like it. For me, it is a very drinkable beer that I will definitely buy again. In my opinion, this is a very good and exciting IPA, though it is not quite on the level of those really great IPAs that are just unforgettable."
"M – Bright with par carbonation and a medium body. Lightly syrupy."
"This is a solid Flagship IPA that is definitely on the bitter side. Very nice mouthfeel."

"Overall this seems to be a middle of the road IPA that came across as a bit dull. It was nearing the best by date, so perhaps this bottle was past its prime."

"The body is good-- firm and well-carbed."
"The first beer I had after a week of Presidente while in the D.R. and it was so damn refreshing and tasty. The amber color and low carbonation was nice to look at. The aroma was hoppy and a bit woody. The taste had a lot of the hops up front with a touch of citrus followed by a light driness then a sharp flavor decrease. The body is spot on and burps up a good amount of the hops. Little malt present. This is definitely a repeat buy if I go through Atlanta again."
"O- love it. So easy drinking. Excellent beer"
"A very good IPA. Really nice hop flavor balanced well with the grains."
"D-overall this was a nice ipa. Good hop profile and good citrus flavors. I got a 6 pack of these and am glad i did. A really nice ipa. Now id just like to have their DIPA"
"I'd buy it again, but I can also see getting tired of it before I ever really get behind it. You can't go wrong with it though, so..."
"O- This would make for an awesome summer day beer. It goes down smoothly while not being too light on taste. It is sweeter than I usually pursue, but that only adds to the summer feel of it."
"Poured a nice deep gold color with a thick white head that sticks around nicely. It has a good IPA nose with strong piney notes, some vegetal scents and a touch of sweet, caramel maltiness. The taste has a medium bitterness for an IPA, it definitely doesn't overpower the beer. The mouthfeel was slightly thin and the carbonation had lots of small bubbles. Overall, this IPA is not going to blow you out with ultra bitterness or ultra hop aroma but it is eminently quaffable and in this sense the thin mouthfeel and dry finish add to its drinkability."
"Drink- This was pretty damn tasty. I liked this one a lot for the tropical notes and being very well balanced. I am a little sad this one is from the SE. I could see drinking a lot of these."
"Drinkability is good, this is a solid IPA, especially for the east coast! Still has the iced tea maltiness I don't love so much."
"Pours a deep copper color with a thick, creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the side of the glass. It has a wonderfully sweet, floral, perfume-like aroma. This floral hop character is well-balanced, however, by an abundant but light malt sweetness. The hop character is a welcome change from the citrus hop flavor that is so prevalent in many of the IPAs on the market. In addition, despite being an IPA, the bitterness is not overwhelming, making this a very easy-drinking."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger head, decent lacing throughout. Aroma of all citrus hops, simply delicious flavor profile that balances out with malts. Taste follows the nose, well balanced. More than average for an ipa but man, this is easy drinking and delicious!"
"This was quite good for a single IPA but I found it lacking backbone a bit. Hops came through in a strong and elegant manner, but the body was a little thin and the hop flavors had very little backup from the rest of the beer. Definitely a good six-pack beer but not in my dream team lineup."
"Visited J. Clydes in Birmingham and was able to due a flight of tap beers and selected Sweetwater IPA as one of five to try. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a white head that settles into a very sticky lace that loves to cling to the sides of the glass. Wonderful IPA aroma of pine oil with some underlying fruity notes. Medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation that does a nice job of offsetting the sticky texture of the beer. Taste begins with some sweet and biscuity malt flavors that soon give way to tart acidic citrus rind and bitter hop resins that remain in a lasting aftertaste. I certainly would recommend any hop head to try it."
"A great IPA I will jump for if it shows up in NJ or PA."
"Overall: Very nice drinkable east coast IPA"
"I definitely appreciate the trade bonus and can honestly say this is a tasty IPA. There is a lot of flavor and it's a good taste to leave in your mouth at the end of the night. I would have liked to try a fresher bottle, but this was still a treat. I will pursue sweetwater's other IPA/DIPAs in the future."
"O: Nice drinkable IPA"
"O: Nice craft IPA."
"Its an ok IPA, just many I enjoy alot more. Kinda expected a bit more. I think this is dated with a 3 month shelf life, so this selection should only be about 6 weeks out. Nevertheless, happy just to get to try something that is outside the distribution area."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow amber color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of grapefruit and lemons mostly. Pine and resin play a role here, but this one is all about the citrus. Malt, yeah I guess there's some in there. If I close my eyes and take a deep breath I can find hints of bread and maybe some hay. Taste is lemon and grapefruity with surprisingly a little bready grainy malt in there as well. Fairly dry finish with a bitter lemony aftertaste. Medium to thin body, moderated level of carbonation with a resinous watery mouthfeel. Decent light IPA that I could see going down quite easily on a hot summer day."
"Solid IPA that I would drink on a regular basis if I had access too."
"Overall this was an enjoyable IPA. Smell was the highlight here but the taste was also very good. Very drinkable beer as well."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is light bodied with high carbonation. Fairly smooth going down. Overall, not a favorite of mine based off this experience. If I ever get the chance to try this fresher, I definitely will. I still didn't find it bad by any means; just not what I was expecting."
"a staple in my fridge,always fresh and very drinkable year round"
"A translucent gold body with about a finger’s-breadth of foamy, almost frothy white head that consists of billions of tiny, tiny bubbles. The head hangs around for a while, but doesn't leave any lacing as it subsides and the liquid level lowers. Smells of piney hops, citrus (orange, grapefruit), some floral notes, and some nice hop spice. Taste is a bit weak; hops and citrus up front, a watery middle, and some spice and faint malt on the finish. All of the flavors seem a bit muted, though balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but smooth and crisp; amply carbonated. Overall, a decent IPA that I'm glad to have tried, but there are other readily available offerings I prefer a bit more."
"Not a bad beer, but not one of the top IPA's either. I'd like to have it on draft sometime to see if the hop profile is better fresh."
"Good IPA, well balanced with a bit of malt sweetness, worth a try."
"Overall, this beer was a let down compared to how great it looked and smelled. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover... oh well."
"Highly drinkable, great flavor and complexity. Man...I wish this was available in my neck of the woods!"
"Pours cloudy, sappy gold with a really nice white head. The nose on this is very enjoyable. It’s sweet of flowers and honey with pine, tea, and citrus depth. Really tasty brew here, it walks the line of a beefier APA and a more typical IPA. The finish lingers of sweetened green tea and honey with adequate hop bite to deliver refreshing zing. Citrus notes are there, but not as prominant as a piny, foresty character. This is really well done, easily one of the better india pale ales I’ve had from the south."
"As far as southeastern IPAs I've had, this is probably one of my favorites. Pours a coppery-orange with a fingers' worth of head….swirling he brew in the glass leaves an ameoba-like ring around the edges. I love the nose on this IPA….some pineapple, orange marmalade, and floral notes abound. The taste closely follows the nose, but there seems to be more of the grapefruit and piney notes and not as much as the sweet citrus flavors. Goes down with a slight bitterness from the hops, but not too overpowering….it also has a pleasant lingering, citrusy aftertaste. Just a solid IPA from one of my favorite southeastern breweries."
"O: Just about an average IPA. Not great, not bad. easy to drink, I could put away a few."
"good buy good drink"
"O-decent but the sweetness was not something I like in an IPA and precludes it from a higher score"
"Clear luminous copper amber with a thin head and soapy lace. Smell is extremely fruity hops. Juniper, mango, and melon. Great nose. Taste is outstanding, sweet mango and melon forward with full round body across the middle. The juniper bitterness pops out at the back. Aftertaste is dry and pleasantly bitter. Refreshing, sticky mouth with medium carbonation. Excellent example of the style while having a distinct character of it's own."
"The flavors are very hoppy, but arent overpowering punch you in the mouth strong, just defined and present. Certainly not an over the top hop bomb. I get no hint of ABV, and the beer is almost gone before I am done with this review. Quite a nice IPA that I would recommend to others and would buy if I found it in my neck of the woods."
"O - One of my personal favorite IPAs. An excellent brew!"
"Overall: I like this version. I appreciate the IPA background and heavy citrus. I will be grabing more of this from time to time."
"O - Overall, this is my favorite year round beer from Sweetwater. Please bring back the Magnum IP!!"
"Thanks again Jacob!"
"Overall impression: Awesome IPA at the peak of freshness. (And it's certainly worth noting that they date their bottles as well- kudos for that.)"
"O: I may be incredibly biased because of the limited availability but for my money I'm going to pick this out of every other IPA in the store if I'm going for taste and price. This is a great IPA if not one of the best in the USA. Must buy."
"M - Medium bodied with good carbonation."
"8.3/10"
"O- This a standby beer for me. Good, not expensive, readily available, sessionable (despite the abv) and easy to find fresh in Nashville. This beer can be divisive though, as some love it and some think it is very overrated. My take is that it is what it is. It's great for the reasons I stated above, but if you're looking for a highly complex IPA, this probably isn't your beer. Great intro IPA for people who don't like piney beers or over the top bitter beers. My wife was like this, and this was the the first IPA she liked, and it broadened her horizons a bit."
"I actually really like this but I think a fresher bottle might have been better. It will do and seems like an alright IPA to me."
"Overall good ipa, good bitter close."
"O- Not to impressed, it is a average to good IPA but it has a lot of hype in GA that is a bit over rated. I think one of the cases of the fresh IPA is the best plus some SE bais. still decent though and worth a try if in ATL."
"O- I am not the biggest IPA fan. But I never mind having one. But this one is really good. This is one I will defintly be buying again. It is just all around a very well balanced beer. good flavor with the right amount of hops."
"Notes: Thanks to Steven and Allison for bringing it along!"
"If Skittles made a beer, it would be a lot like this one."
"O- the taste almost died after the initial hop presence. I wish the flavor stsyer through out the beer."
"This beer was really enjoyable. Id really like to drink more of this one on a regular basis."
"O: I nice IPA. I enjoyed that the hops were the main character and it wasn't overtaken by a certain fruit or spiced addition. A very solid go-to brew."
"O - Great aroma, pretty decent taste after letting it warm a bit. Pretty good, and 7.99 a growler is tough to beat.."
"O- Hops have a herbal pineapple weed flavor with a soft bitterness but there is not quite enough to support the full caramel sweetness that is a bit to much."
"O: Afordable, tasty and easy drinking, Sweetwater IPA goes down well and will leave you wanting another. In my opinion, this is the best IPA(non-DIPA) that you can get in Nashville for the money."
"O-A solid IPA. Very refreshing but interesting."
"O--This is an absolute gem from an otherwise mediocre brewery. I want this to be my everyday go-to IPA."
"Note: This bottle had a best by date of 4/6/11, but due to circumstances I could only get to it now. If I get to try it fresher, I'll update my review."
"Notes: Overall a decent beer, although nothing steller for the style but okay at least."
"O - A great beer overall. I would drink this again, no doubt. Very pleasant smell. I have a special place in my heart for this beer because it was the first IPA I ever had. I would recommend this to any beer lover."
"Overall - I really like pine heave IPAs, so this did not disappoint."
"Hop oriole on this is fairly unique, it's very grassy, citrus flavors and some pine notes. Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth - almost like it's on nitro - but it's not. There's a good sharp light bitterness, it's not overwhelming at all though. It's quite drinkable and quite good!"
"Overall a good Americaqn IPA, not a world class but certainly worth paise."
"Good solid ""go to"" IPA. Nice citrus notes with enough malt to make it multi-dimensional. Grapefruit is the overriding citrus flavor with no alcohol hotness. Best bang for your buck from the Atlanta breweries IMO. Freshness is important with this one and the ""Best Before"" date is always worth checking out."
"O - Good brew that seems to be a bit under the radar. I've enjoyed both regular Sweet Water offerings that I've had."
"O: Good malt and hop character in a beer with good balance overall."
"4/14/12 Edit= I managed to get ahold of a much fresher bottle that was best before June 30th 2011, the taste was much brighter and tastier, those great citrus hops make their way to the flavor and show up nicely. This was one refreshing IPA, I am glad I got to try a much fresher example and will change my score to reflect how much better it is fresh. Original Score 4.5/4.5/2.5/4/3"
"I love the hop flavor here, but I wish it hit a bit harder. Still, this is the kind of IPA I can put back very easily, and I'd drink it a lot if I could buy it where I live. A good East Coast IPA, and really cheap, at least in Georgia."
"O- I feel like this is a bit overrated on this site. Its a good beer, but not A-... I feel like I got a fresh bottle but I just was looking for more of an IPA bite. Will come back to this again because it is one of the most accessible IPAs for TN, but I won't be coming back to this when I want that in your face hop bite I get with other examples of the style... Above Average; BARELY..."
"Overall a pretty good IPA, I would classify this as a Southern Summer IPA, if there is such a thing."
"O: A well balanced, flavorful IPA. Pretty solid, lacking a bit in m/f and finish. Im glad to have tried this."
"Next review!"
"O - My go to IPA. Had this a long time ago prior to my appreciation for beer and thought it was okay at best. With a new-found respect for IPA's and having it fresh I can say that it's one of my favorites."
"Ok, a little thin on body was my only complaint."
"Overall, not the best I've had, but far from the worst. It lacks that something special on the hop profile or the malt profile to really make it stand out of the crowd, but I'd gladly have one again."
"This overall isn't a bad beer if you like the malt character, but it's just too damn sweet for me. I'm glad I only got a single; I doubt I'll be buying a six pack of these -- I'll stick to my SN Torpedo."
"Beer is moderate in body and mildly sweet on the get go, the midpalate is earthy sulfury hops and a decent finish with moderate bitterness. Beer does not finish dry, the overall malt backbone weighs this beer down in a bad way unfortunately. I did not thoroughly enjoy this beer. I've had this on tap before and I remember liking it better. I'd have it again to confirm my suspicions that this may be an older bottle as this is not as hoppy as I recall it to be."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Had the opportunity to try this a second time. First time I had concerns it may have been light-struck, which were confirmed the second the super citrusy aroma hit my nostrils. Really an excellent IPA at a reasonable ABV. Highly recommended."
"Delicious, refreshing and my favorite looking IPA so far."
"Overall, this is a good beer in every way. It doesn't have in-your-face hops, but it definitely has an adequate fix of them and is an all around solid beer."
"O - Not the hops in my face IPA I'd reach for if ""I'm only having one"". However, an easy and nice tasting IPA to knock back a few of on the weekend."
"O- Certainly a good tasting brew, and very drinkable, even at 6.7% (I neither smelled nor tasted any alcohol). Unfortunately, and despite the fact that I bought this beer at a Atlanta, GA, ""package"" store, the beer is almost out of code and lacking a lot of the hop presence that made this an IPA to begin with. I much more enjoyed the fresh Hopsecutioner that I purchased in Orlando, FL (go figure). I say give it a try, but try and find it fresh, maybe at the brewery or on tap."
"Enjoyable to drink and a good beer. Not sure if I would classify it as an IPA..."
"O - A well made sessionable IPA for hop lovers."
"On draft. The bartender told me Sweetwater does a lot with fruity undertones with their beer. He then told me the IPA had grapefruit undertones - which struck me as cliche... Until I tried it! Fantastic - assuming you like grapefruit! A great novel IPA variety!"
"O-Overall this is a very pleasant beer and easy to drink but there are other IPAs I'd opt for given the choice."
"D: A nice local brew, will have again if I see it and nothing bomber is on the beer menu."
"Very nice IPA overall, nice flavors, approachable and easy drinking."
"Overall, this is a solid and tasty IPA."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, color is a good coppery-golden hue with an off white head that laces nicely. Smell is primarily hops with citrus leading the way and some pine following. Taste is very similar with a little more pine. Feel is very nice and smooth, with an oily finish. Overall a great representation of an IPA and a very good beer."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It wasn't exactly what I'd expected it to be, but it was good nonetheless. Seeing as I live in Atlanta, I could see making this my go to IPA. I'll have to get over to Sweetwater for a tour - I'd be interested to see how it fairs fresh from the brewery."
"Great body. Great mouthfeel and just an easy drinking IPA with a bold pine note left on the tongue. Again, this is delicious."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and of the five Sweetwater beers that I have tried, I think that this is the best one. Their brown is pretty good too, but this one is superior. I wouldn't call this my favorite IPA, but this is certainly a darn good one."
"D - I'd buy/order again with little question. Very representation of the regular American IPA. Very easy to enjoy two or three in an evening. That there would be a good night, I think."
"All in all, this is still an excellent beer, even for one that has been tempered with a couple months of age. Under ideal conditions, it would have a more pronounced citrus aroma and a sweeter flavor. In Montgomery, a really fresh beer is rarely found. I'd love to conduct another review with a truly fresh pour."
"D- A nice refreshing IPA for a hot summer day. Not too much to it, so I can easily throw a few of these back in an evening."
"Good moutfeel, good carbonation and very drinkable."
"Sweetwater IPA is complex; I find different subtle flavors each time I drink one. It's an under-rated beer, even here in its home town. I'm always searching for that perfect or new IPA, but one of, if not my favorite is always right under my nose, at least in the bottle. You can find Sweetwater's ubiquitous 420 everywhere on tap here in Atlanta, but their IPA is not served in nearly as many places. Too bad, as it's a far superior beer whether you're a hop head or not."
"4.0/4.5/5.0/3.5/4.5"
"Had a best by date of 2/21/11..I think I am close enough. Poured a nice hazy light orange, and it had a head that spent slowly. Immediate strong peach smell coming off the glass, quite fruity! I got it in the taste as well, but more of an undertone. The first thing I got in taste was a smooth hop presence. Then a sour, but fruity finish. Flavors blend together for a very drinkable IPA."
"D - I'm torn. This drinks well, but I only want one. It's too much of a hop bomb to be anything like a session beer. That said, it didn't stay in my glass very long."
"Drinkability: This is great stuff, and lucky for me it's all over the place here in Georgia."
"D: It's delicious and widely available to me. I've had many and will have many more."
"Appearance is a pleasant gold to amber with a slight orange tint. A vigorous pour yields a decent-sized head, with plenty of lacing down the glass as it disappears. The scent is one of my absolute favorites of any beer - a wonderful fruit cocktail/grapefruit/pear scent. The taste can be summarized in one word - grapefruit. But really, it is more complex than that. There is a grapefruit undertone from start to finish, which pairs well with a malty sweetness at the start to a big burst of tart grapefruit at the end, and a slight lingering piney aftertaste. Enjoyed it immensely, an outstanding IPA."
"Another good one from SweetWater."
"Overall its a solid IPA for sure."
"At least as long as its in my glass."
"M&D- A fuller texture and feel to it. Easy to drink though. I get a, easy drinkability. I would love to have this beer in my fridge all year long. This is one of my new top IPA's."
"Sweetwater did a real nice job with this one."
"Drinkability - that was easy to drink - I had planned on enjoying it slowly - didn't happen - very drinkable - well balanced Ipa - I need another one . thanks again Tilley4"
"Pleasant surprise from what I expected. I expected it to be more malt heavy, but this is much better than what I thought."
"I'm eagerly looking forward to the day when I can go to my local bottle shop and pick up a sixer of Sweetwater IPA. I gotta admit it: for everyday drinking, I don't know if it gets any better. I heart this beer."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pour is mostly cloudy amber/orange color with active carbonation bubbles and a pretty two inch off white head. Some sticky lacing is left behind. Aroma of resin citrus, orange sweet with some pine notes. Fresh hop nose, nice. Taste is the nose, pine, resin, citrus; though its not quite as fresh or bright as the nose. Some bitterness towards the finish. Some musty, almost pineapple sour present as well. Palate is medium, with earthy lingering bitterness. Overall, a nice IPA!"
"D-very drinkable. Pleasantly suprised with this brew"
"D - this beer drinks greatly well. Tasty and Inoffensive. I digit."
"D: I've gone door-to-door and promoted this brew with my craft beer peeps. I think it in one of the best IPAs in the Midwest... but still playing a very distant fiddle to Alpha King and Dreadnaught off course. :)"
"Pours murky orange with lots of white head. pretty cloudy. Smells nicely hoppy. Some citrus and pine on the nose. A bit more complex than most. Tastes really solid. Lots of pine on the tongue and some grapefruit too. Not much malt on the background but a great mouthfeel. Highly carbonated and very drinkable."
"D: A lighter IPA that makes for easy drinking."
"D: It's a pretty drinkable IPA, especially for one that shows off the pine flavors so well. Many piney IPAs coat my tongue with bitterness that lingers well after the taste, but not this one."
"D- Great Ipa from sweetwater, will always love a cold glass of this beer on a hot day."
"This bottle was about a month away from it's best by date, so I think a fresher bottle would be worthy of a re-review. This bottle was still very good as is."
"Overall, not as great as I thought from the nose and how many taps it has in the area. Alcohol is hidden, I'll give it that. Which makes for easy drinking."
"Overall, this is one killer IPA. A clear mix of east- and west-coast influence."
"All in all, this started stellar, but ended up not all that good by the end. They definitely need to rework this recipe IMO."
"D - Clean, dry, refreshing and tasty, it pretty easy to put down. Just not up to par with most other IPAs I've had."
"Poured out a nice looking darkish golden-light amber color into my pint glass. Nice amount of yeast sediment seems to be floating around in this one as well. A fluffy, thick white head immediately formed and left copious amounts of lacing behind after each sip. Beautiful. Smell is of strong pine, grapefruit and citrus. The taste starts out strong with hops, a barrage of pine, oranges, lemons and limes, while a semi-sweet maltiness manages to make it's way onto the palate to mellow out the hoppiness. This beer is mildly carbonated, allowing for your tastebuds to be fully aware of the hop presence, not at all blinding the piney, earthy and natural citrus flavors. You get the strong, crisp bitterness at the end of each sip, while a slick and oily mouthfeel hangs around. Moderate body in this one with a bready and sweet malt presence. Pretty darn good in my opinion, light enough to enjoy more than a few. I'd say the drinkability is higher than most IPA's I've had in the past. Great brew from Sweetwater."
"OVERALL: Sweetwater is one of the few things I have ever enjoyed from Atlanta, Georgia. I've got some horrific memories attached to that city and state, but the Sweetwater IPA is good enough to make me forget that for a moment. If I'm ever stuck there, I know how I'm passing the time. Like their other beers I've tried the IPA is amongst the best in the South."
"If you want an IPA that's as grapefruit as they get, go ahead and pick this one up. I'm impressed though, that they stopped short of making it ridiculously bitter. Recommended!"
"D -- Very drinkable for the hop lover, and the crisp finish makes it one for those expanding into IPAs as well. Will definitely keep stocked."
"Drinks very well. Great stuff!"
"D= Very good beer really drinkable not that high of a ABV. really enjoyed it."
"The IPA had 1 1/2 Fingers of head and was copper in color. The chunky head lasted throughout. The smell was strong hops and floral. This was suprisingly more refreshing than some other IPAs that I've had. The taste is bold, but is quickly out of your mouth. It does not have that lingering sour flavor that makes you wish you could brush your teeth; and you would if you didn't already know how terrible beeramint is. It has a welcome crispness and a little malty finish. It was medium bodied and easy to drink, but pretty zesty. I probably wouldn't drink more than two of these in a sitting."
"D: Very good. This is my go to beer. One of my all time favorites."
"New to our area and I am excited about this arrival! Available most places in Jacksonville FL!"
"One of the best normal IPA's I've had in a while...and unique tasting as well. One of the best beers in the entire region easily."
"D: Very easy and pleasant!"
"D: The beer is very drinkable. I would definitely have another one of these again because it has a nice amount of bitterness and a good amount of flavors. I could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"The mouthfeel has some perky carbonation that sizzles the tongue and a medium body that coats your mouth slightly. Another area of this beer that is simple but well done. It doesn't need anything more complex then the bitterness and malt sweetness it has. A very easy drinker and one worth checking out."
"D- Very easy to drink. Very nice refreshing, hoppy beer."
"Overall, an excellent brew and cost effective. Like many IPAs, this is much better fresh and Sweetwater providing a Best Before date is awesome."
"D- very good hoppy beer on the verge of a sessionable"
"On cask at Brixx Pizza in Chapel Hill served in a standard pint glass a nice hazy orange with a decent off white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of pine hops in front of caramel malts. The taste is a nice kick of bitter pine hops with a sturdy caramel malt backbone providing nice balance. The beer is medium bodied with a nice hint of dryness. This is a very enjoyable cask IPA, one I was glad to go a bit out of my way for!"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable and highly thirst quenching. Exceptional. This moves high up on the list of my favorite beers. I plan to have it on hand regularly. Wish I could find it on tap more often."
"drinkability and mouthfeel are perfect, and i wouldnt change a thing."
"First review of a beer I received in Secret Santa '10. Slightly hazy orange color with two fingers of white head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Huge citrus and tropical fruit in the aroma. Malt does not make an appearance. And the malt does not add much to the flavor either. This is a hop showpiece and the brewer evidently did not want any of that pesky malt getting in the way. Just a lot of citrus hops is tasted but bitterness does not get out of hand and is very manageable. I enjoyed the body in this beer. Although it is not that big, it has really good carbonation that lends a very good texture. Overall a good IPA that features the hops nicely without blistering bitterness."
"d: Top notch IPA. If this was local it might knock off 60 minute as my go to IPA. Thanks to titosupertramp for the treat."
"This is one of my favorite IPA's and definitely my favorite of the Sweetwater beers."
"Mildy hazy light brownish orange color. Thick Ring on edge of glass with thin covering on face of beer. Outstanding aroma, brown sugar, some honey, and excellent citrusy grapefruit aroma. Mild to moderate carbonation. Very smooth mouthfeel, with a mild grapefruit finish. A little on the sweeter side but pretty well balanced. Extremely drinkable for an ipa with such a good flavor and good hop character. Has that citrus peel aftertaste, but nothing in the aftertaste that linger longer than it should."
"Having previously enjoyed quite a few of the 420 extra pale ale, I was surprised by how many notches Sweetwater cranks up the hops for this product. Big hops profile, with some floral notes and a touch of honey/dextrose sweetness in the background. Color is an unsual orange/gold. Finish is a firm, lingering bitterness. Nicely done."
"Pours a lighter shade of amber with a thin beige head that retains OK. The aroma is all piney and citrusy hops, along with some caramel and turbinado sugar, fruity esters and some alcohol. The flavor is similar with pineapple and grapefruit hops, along with some piney and grassy hop notes, caramel and brown sugar, fruity esters, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is pretty good. A solid, but unspectacular IPA."
"D. A very good representation of the style. I like how all of the hop character interacts to create a complex IPA."
"OK. I get it now. I get why people love this beer so much. I just need to be wary of Sweetwater IPA's freshness in the future."
"def a session ipa....although its like 6.5%abv."
"Drinkability- I'm about to open another."
"[re-sampled 6/19/2011 with bottle: as excellent as the draft version]"
"D - Exceptional. Quite simply, one of my favorite beers and a regular go-to standard."
"D: A very solid sessionable IPA."
"Pours copper with a white head. Nice staying power and good lacing as it goes down my glass. Nose brings some fairly strong citrus hops and a tad bit of light malt. The taste is mostly citrus. There is some light bread and caramel flavors underneath. Good feel with nice bitterness. Not too high in alcohol with a good levels of hops, this is a drinkable beer."
"Medium body, carbonation is soft and adequate. Not as juicy as I thought from the nose. Alcohol is hidden, making this an easy drinker. Very nice."
"D - So refreshing its impossible to drink just one. I rarely buy multiples of any beer, but this will become a repeating stock in my fridge."
"D - Nice and drinkable, put me down for a couple more. This was much better then I expected, I'll have to seek out other Sweetwater brews now."
"I was lucky enough to find this beer at the Atlanta airport at the Sweetwater bar/restaurant. A decent IPA but an awesome find at an Airport."
"D- A good IPA and one of the better made in the south."
"The pour resulted in a thin head of light brown foam that faded quickly, leaving a very thin ring on lace. Medium cloudy amber color, rating a 13 on the SRM chart. Rich smell of citrus, wheat, and malt. Deep rich flavor of lemon zest, grapefruit, sweet malt, and spice. Crisp flavor with a mild bitter finish. A little thin in mouthfeel, but none the less pleasing. Good blended flavor, good price and availability. I would be glad to have one with a meal if it was on the drink menu."
"This is exactly like making out with a hot chick. You think it's gonna be good before you even get to it and then when you're in the middle you don't realize how good it really is. Then when it's over you wish you'd taken your time and savored things more."
"d- this is a good beer for sure, if you like fruity ipas then this should be in your wants list"
"Sorry guys not my favorite offering from Sweetwater"
"drinkability: solid IPA selection and Im sure to have it again"
"Drinks: run-of-the-mill. The flavor was just too muted for me. It did, however, pair quite well with some spicy taco meat, which really brought out the sweetness in the IPA."
"This is one of my favorite IPA's and definitely my favorite of the Sweetwater beers."
"D: Very drinkable with a good hop bite, this is a rather impressive IPA."
"Reading the best by date, this should have been consumed by 6/13/10... hopefully the hops haven't faded too much. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy burnt golden orange color with a thick, soapy white head. The nose definitely tells the story of an AIPA, thick with citrus notes like orange and grapefruit, resinous piney notes also are present. Upfront the flavor is very malty sweet, hops are almost unnoticeable in bitterness but are definitely present in the preceding flavor components. This IPA is very interesting in that it does have an intense hop nose/flavor but most of it must come from dry hopping because it doesn't have the mouth puckering bitterness you would expect. Very well done indeed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin yet creamy carbonation. Overall an incredibly easy drinking beer due to the excellent hop flavor but subdued yet balanced bitterness. Definitely a winner in my book, cheers to Sweetwater for this one!"
"Golden amber and hazy from the lack of filtration. The head is huge and eggshell white. As it dies down it leaves behind a lot of lace and finally settles into a 1/4 inch foam cap. The aroma is very citrusy with grapefruit, hints of lemon, sweet wildflowers and a slight earthiness. The first impression is that it is quite creamy, medium bodied and actually has more balance to it than I initially expected. Some light malt flavor is intertwined with all the citrusy hop flavors that the aroma prepared me for. The malt is very good, but not what I would expect from the style or the aroma. A great IPA and I have to say that so far this is my favorite Sweet Water beer."
"This is definitely better fresher!!! Still a good, drinkable IPA."
"Overall, an average ipa at best. Decent drinkability, but nothing special. Too malty for me."
"An eas drinking, pleasant IPA."
"Notes: One of the first Sweetwater offerings I am lucky to try and this is a rock solid and quite recommendable IPA. Worth the trip to Atlanta..."
"Bottle. Cloudy orange color with a slight white head. Aroma is more malty than hoppy. A very pedestrian everyday IPA in my opinion. Not super hoppy but hoppy enough to know you are drinking an IPA. Medium mouthfeel. Citurs hop notes. We don't get Sweetwater here in MN but if I'm down south I'll be sure to try this on tap to see if it is any better that way."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle obtained in a trade. Pours clear bright amber orange with a good-sized beige head that has some real retention. Nose is more caramel malt with the hops, citrus, and light yeast taking a back seat. The palate is similar with the caramel and some chocolate malt taking over. The hops kicks in as bitterness on the back of the palate and finish, and there is also some grapefruit citrus. The body is light with heavy carbonation and a decent bitter and chocolate finish. Kind of strange for an IPA."
"D-This is an insanely drinkable IPA, although when you mention ""extensive dry hopping"" on the bottle I expect from the nose."
"D: A good American IPA that goes too heavy on the grapefruit. However, this is my only complaint, and a mild on at that. Worth picking one up if you're in the Southeast."
"Drinkability - extremely drinkable and thoroughly thirst quenching. Worth another purchase especially fresh. I tend to prefer IPAs with a little more sweet maltiness to help mellow out the IBUs, but this is certainly a good brew. Iconic American IPA."
"Sampled this at Savor 2010. Poured a golden-orange, with a finger of white, decent retention, and good lacing. Huge citrus nose, with pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot, with some bitter hops. The taste confirmed the aroma, with a huge citrus flavor, though more balanced with malt at midpalate than expected, and then finished on a sweet pineapple citrus note. Not as overpoweringly sweet on the finish as some other pineapple-flavored ipa's I've had recently. Modestly carbonated, and very smooth and medium-bodied. Very nice, citrus-oriented specimen of the style."
"Overall this is one of the better IPAs I've had."
"quite drinkable."
"D Very good IPA, but a little more subdued in the hops from others."
"Pretty good but not elite level IPA overall, better than I expected from the dirty south."
"D - Glad to find this on tap. I had 420 in a bottle and hoped to find some IPA. I wasn't disappointed."
"This stuff is very good. I am thoroughly enjoying it. The perfect thing for an 87* Saturday evening like this."
"Living in Atlanta, I have ha this beer numerous times, but with all the other stuff out there have not had it in a while. Drank one tonight and was reminded just how solid of a beer it is. Doesn't knock my socks off...but is a very drinkable American IPA. Great to drink during a BBQ....and because it is not expensive it is a good beer to keep in the fridge. If you are in town...try it on tap., it is better (per norm)."
"Notes: Still my go-to IPA, and this is FAR from West Coast stuff (in terms of taste)... My opinion of the bottled vs. draught debate is that they are both delicious. I would say that the bottled version may seem a little hoppier and less malt-driven, but its all preference."
"Mouthfeel is good. Light bodied as an IPA should be though I found it slightly overcarbonated. But good nonetheless. This is a great beer. It's been 6 months since I've had one and I find it easily as good or better than the big IPAs that everyone (including me) love like Two-Hearted & Stone IPA. Really great stuff."
"Based on previous experience with Sweetwater I was really looking forward to this beer, and I wasn't let down. It does juicy citrus and pine very well, so if that's your thing give it a try. SweetWater Brewing is on my radar for sure. If it was available in PA it would be a mainstay in my fridge. If you're ever near the ATL or have a trading partner in the dirty south, be sure to grab some of this...you won't be dissapointed."
"Cheers"
"Overall a great IPA with tons of fruit flavor. Super drinkable. I wish I had access to this beer on a regualr basis. I would stock cases of it on my fridge. Thanks for the bottle Scott."
"Received as an extra in a recent trade with scifan (Thanks). Pours a fairly dark amber color, with a thick, fluffy light tan head. Nice floral hop aromas, along with melon and resiny pine. Similar on the palate, although much more subdued, although the melon remains fairly prominent. A pretty solid effort, and a much appreciated extra."
"Dont pass this one up."
"One of the best IPA's I have had in a while"
"Had this while on vacation and I never heard of this brewery before. The head held up nicely for the entire pint and the smell was amazing, super fresh with tons and tons of pine aroma in it. And that was exactly how it delivered in flavor. This was like a simcoe hop bomb. Very enjoyable, very good ipa. Not a perfect A, but nearly flawless."
"EDIT: So, in finishing the remaining beers from my 6 pack, I noticed they degraded faster than any other beer I've ever had. Some may disagree, but I've lowered my ratings. Sure, in its ideal form, its phenomenal. But the beer can't hold that ideal form for any reasonable amount of time (drink by date is still 7 weeks away and its already a shell of its former self, and I'm not part of the ipa faded army). Anyways, its ratings are now changed accordingly. This was a 4.75 originally."
"All things considered it's not a bad beer, but it doesn't deserve the credit it gets IMO."
"The Sweetwater IPA pours a hazy orange color with a frothy 2 finger head that has great retention. Some noticeable sediment is seen in this unfiltered brew. Aromas are grainy and sugary. Lots of sweetness that far outweighs the hoppiness. Some malts are also present. Taste is also somewhat sweeter than I expected. I actually enjoy the sweetness to it, there isn't much bitterness at all. Some fruit is also present in the taste. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good for this. ABV is mediocre and the taste was a pleasant suprise."
"this is super easy to drink. not too much of anything and a really nice hop flavor that creams refreshing. i like this a lot."
"d- I love this beer. has turned into my ipa standby and I always keep sixer in fridge. at $9/sixer, it really is hard to beat."
"D - this is a solid IPA. I love the grapefruity hops. This is a really sweet IPA that isn't overly sweet. I bought one six packan but will buy another before I head back to St. Louis."
"D - Overall, this is a fantastic IPA, despite my nitpicking review. We will see how it fares in the East Coast-West Coast beef that I have arranged... can it be felled by a can from Oregon? Caldera IPA is up next... (Update: Sweetwater wins, barely)"
"this beer has become my go-to inexpensive IPA. very underrated, it's got some of my favorite characteristics in this style, citic hops, a bit of sweetness, and, to borrow a phrase, ""superior drinkability"". keep making it and i'll keep drinking it, sweetwater."
"D: Very drinkable solid IPA. The sweet malty taste makes this an interesting full flavored beer."
"can't wait to go back to ATL and get me some more sweetwater."
"This is a standard of mine for an after work start to the evening. The color is a lovely straw amber grain. The nose is grapefruity and slightly piny. The flavor is VERY grapefruity with that sweet tartness. It coats the mouth, but not in an overbearing way. As much of it as I have consumed, I must declare this beer extremely drinkable."
"Sessionable. Low ABV. Highly drinkable. Great highly available brew."
"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is citrus and resiny hops with some earthy notes. The flavor is resiny and orange citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pretty good IPA. This is par for the course with my experiences with Sweetwater to date - like all of them, love none of them. Still looking for that can't-put-it-down experience."
"D: Oh that I could get these up here on a regular basis. I will definitely have to stock up when I visit family in Georgia."
"Finally got around to reviewing this semi-regular local for me. I think this beer encapsulates Sweetwater's approach (non-Dank Tank) which is to build a beer that appeals to the largest variety of drinkers possible. Would consider it SE's best widely-distributed IPA and one that would appeal to those looking for a balanced/restrained version of the style."
"D: A decent little IPA from a region which is not necessarily known for good craft beer. Not a hop-bomb of an IPA, but an easy drinking example"
"D: An excellent IPA with a crispness and brightness which is unique. It belongs in the upper tier of American IPAs. Thanks to my friend Erinn for bringing it up from Atlanta for us to enjoy."
"This is a good very drinkable and hoppy IPA from my own backyard long overlooked by me. Not overlooked anymore!"
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this IPA. Maybe I was just really in the mood for some hops, but I will definitely be purchasing this beer again and hopefully soon. It could be more complex but, I think it tastes delicious."
"Lemony hops dominate with a bittersweet grapefruit flavor showing up as well. The middle of the flavor has more of the herbal bitterness with that component lasting through the after taste. The malt reminds me of the malt in 90 minute, but on a smaller scale, very standard but tasty. Overall a great IPA for the region and a competitor with some of the great AIPAs like 60 minute and smuttynose and even many Cali breweries. The mouth feel is fine for the style, not too thin and just sticky enough."
"Very surprised by this one. Can't figure out how they snuck this into the TN grocery stores considering it is 6.7% abv. I may have found a new go to IPA. Very cheap and must say I like it more than my standard favorite DFH 60. Just hope the ATF don't ever crack down on it."
"Drinkability: OK. Standard, average IPA. Would recommend to those new to the world of IPA."
"D - Highly drinkable, great thirst quencher, surprised how much I liked this."
"WoW!! I love it!! When I poured the brew into a 150z mug it poured into a merky amber color not much head that sticks very well to the glass. The smell is great with a smell of pure hops. The taste is wounderful with a balance but with a wonderful citrus flavor that is through and through which include a great taste of grapefruit. The mouthfeel is great considering which makes for the best drinkability. I would highly sugest that you try this brew!! You will not go wrong I promise!!!"
"4.0 D: Very interesting brew and definitely worth a try."
"It has a nice golden brown color with about a finger of white head resting on top. The head recedes to leave some excellent lacing. It has a robust pine aroma with a slight citrus grapefruit smell. The taste is quite similar. The front of the taste is of earthy pine followed by some citrus notes in the finish. The finish is slightly bitter, but nothing that takes away from the drinkability. It has a crisp hop presence throughout. Overall and excellent IPA. Definitely my favorite offering from Sweetwater. With warmer weather approaching this will start to become a staple in my fridge."
"Thanks to my friend Dan for sharing this interesting IPA. The flavor has a sharp, crisp citrus punch character that reminds me of Five Alive. The taste finishes with resinous pine syrup and floral notes. It's nice to get an IPA that's a little different, worth a try if you come upon this one."
"D: Could easily drink plenty of these in a sitting. Wonderful example of an American IPA."
"Impression: An excellent IPA. I would get this again for sure, but Sweetwater doesn't come here."
"Sweetwater IPA is a superb beer. I'll definately pick up a sixer of this whenever and wherever I come across it."
"Overall, this is a really refreshing and enjoyable IPA. It's not the most flavorful, but it would be the perfect brew to crack open on a hot day in the summertime. It's a little bit sweeter than the average IPA, but what else can you expect from a brewery that goes by Sweetwater? This is a nice example of the style and I would definitely drink it again."
"Smooth citrus flavor. The ""grapefruit"" taste does overpower the grain flavor at times but it is not a sour taste. Nice hoppy flavor. The cloudy ""unfiltered"" look of the ale was appealing to the eye. I think the IBU is probaby in the 46- 55 range. It is a great summer time brew"
"Overall, Sweetwater's IPA is a pretty good representation of the style. Though not as hoppy as the label claims, the only improvements it needs is to add a little bit more flavor and to give more head. A very easy drinker, it won't be hard for me to finish this and several of its friends. Not a bad beer, at all."
"Liked this quite a bit and was pleasantly surprised. Decided to try it as I have had their Pale Ale on tap and was similarly impressed; will definitely be keeping an eye on this brewery as quality overall seems high."
"To be sure, this is quite a unique ale given the strong grapefruit flavor, but it's a bit much. I think it overpowers some of the hop and pine flavors. Overall, it's still delicious."
"Overall - Really enjoying this, it was a warm day out so we went for a hike and this is really refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability: good"
"Taste was bitter hops, citrus, grain, bread and caramel. Very balanced and easy drinking, but a bit lighter than I prefer my IPA's. Would make for a good session beer."
"Drinkability: A very good IPA that is bitter but not overly so. The hops are there, but not overpowering. A simple yet good beer."
"D: A great gateway IPA for malt-heads. Hops are not apparent in this one at all compared to some others I've had. Regardless, very balanced and the mouthfeel makes me feel like I could drink a gallon of this."
"D - If I could buy this locally, I'd have it around quite often I'm sure."
"D-nice hop profile and some sweet caramel malts. it is very smooth and has a good amount of body to it. the finish had some kind of a watery taste to it and the alcohol was slightly present on a lower abv beer."
"I would say if you're having a few, this is a good choice. If you just want one, you might want to go with something a little more satisfying. Good pizza beer."
"D) Delicious. I'd have another and make a recommendation to a buddy."
"I've had the 420 before and enjoyed it, but this is a really exceptional IPA and a really pleasant surprise. My only regret is only buying two bottles instead a whole six pack, but that will be remedied the next time I see this again."
"Thanks go out to Speedwayjim for this extra! Lovely orange color with a small white head left some llight lacing on the glass. Aroma is grapefruit and lightly sweet and spicy. West coast style IPA here, plenty of grapefruit and citrus, a touch of pepper, crisp, dry malts. Good balance, easy drinking. Nice IPA!"
"Slightly chewy, resinous medium body with a lot of delicious fresh floral hoppy goodness. Lots of sweet citrus flavor, especially lemon and orange peel, mango, pineapple and grapefruit. The perfect amount of dry piny bitterness balanced out by a subtle biscuit/ graham cracker malt backbone. The ABV is excellently masked making this beer dangerously quaffable. I love this beer and wish I had constant access to fresh bottles of it."
"Overall pretty good, more like typical fairly balanced east coast style IPA that does it's job, and nothing wrong. Hops are decent, fairly balanced, fairly tasty and drinkable, but not quite a standout."
"Notes: Surprisingly solid selection from sweetwater. This rivals the standard IPA's. By that I mean, as good as the ones that I consider to be ""good"" IPA, not just a run of the mill beer. It definitely has some character to it."
"This is a beer I could drink all day if I were inclined to drink beer all day. It's not blowing my mind but it is all around good."
"Thanks Casey!"
"M/D- when trying to dissect the mouthfeel it's fairly difficult to pick out many flaws. IMO, this part of this beer is what makes it such an easy drinking session-like IPA. great balance of viscosity & carbonation. I'm glad one of the south's few regional IPA's is a very enjoyable brew."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I was hesitant to review it because the bottle was at the end of its shelf life, but it tasted good and was worthy of a review. I want to try a fresh bottle."
"This is a very drinkable IPA. Those it has a light hop nose for an IPA, but it has pleasant sweet, cereal, & citrus aroma. The body is appropriate for the style with a medium-light body. This IPA overall has a medium hop/bitter load for an IPA, and is not an over the top hop load. This beer does however have a fantastic balanced sweetness that marries well with the hops. I would definitely look for this beer next time I'm in the South."
"All in all, this is drinkable, but I'm not a big fan. The sulfurish taste really does it in for me."
"Rather drinkable and with a hop profile that is distinctive and superbly inviting and delicious. This is one killer IPA -- I'm proud to claim it as a product of my home turf. A clear mix of east- and west-coast influence, I could drink this until my tastebuds ceased to function or I passed out from the moderately-high 6.7% ABV, whichever happened first. Excellent."
"I'm impressed with Sweetwater beer. IPA is very, very good and falls just a little shy of excellent. The flavor is very good and just a little more bitterness would probably drive it up a notch. The nose could also use a little more strength. Those are the only small qualms I have. This is very good beer. Definitely pick it up if you have the opportunity. Thanks, Chris."
"The label deceives, or perhaps we were not ready for the hop onslaught that was delivered from this bottle. A hophead's beery dream. Without a doubt this a good call when it comes to American IPAs."
"Drinkability? I could enjoy more than 1 at a sitting, for sure! Overall, this IPA brings a lot of ""ammo"" when it comes to drinking enjoyment. I'm impressed!"
"D - Very enjoyable & easy to drink. As far as I'm concerned, this would make a pretty solid session IPA."
"Would I buy more of it? - Absolutely, I'll just need to leave New England to do it."
"I loved the taste of this IPA. The hops are very citrusy and not overly bitter. The sweetness of the malt really comes through and really helps balance out the bitterness. This was a very easy drinking IPA that I could drink all night long if only I had more. Excellent taste and drinkability. This is one of my new favorite IPA's."
"d- really good, sweetwater isn't available up here so i'm really glad i got this is a trade, i'd drink this again for sure, definately a fruitier ipa which is a refreshing change of pace for my hop craving palate."
"This poured a slightly hazy light copper with some light tan head. It smelled like oranges and grapefruit, with a bit of pineapple and lemon and honey malt. It tasted like fresh grapefruit and orange and lemon, with some sweet pineapple and honey malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a fantastic IPA that I would place just below Blind Pig and/or AleSmith IPA. It had a great clean hops taste with good body. It had just enough malt to keep this easy to drink without the hops being overpowering. I've heard this beer can be temperamental (i.e. must be drunk very fresh), but it's awesome if you get a good bottle."
"Nose is slightly skunky, with grapefruit notes. Color is a hazy amber with a thin head. Would benefit from a more complex dry hop. They advertise ""an extensive dry hop process," but i have a hard time believing they dry hop with more than one hop varietal. Decent brew, but doesn't hold up to a Belle's or Rocky Mountain IPA."
"D: Decently drinkable but is easily lost in the sea of IPAs out there."
"D: very drinkable. Such excellent flavor and balance."
"D - This was a very nice IPA, if it was available full time down here, I would buy this beer a lot"
"D- Drinkable in my eyes, but strange flavors and burps make me think hop extracts where used in place of real dry-hopping. Hey worked for Hop Stoopid... Would have again just wouldn't look to hard."
"Great beer"
"Pale amber color with a small amount of lace and some rimming. Loses a point for head retention but pretty nice overall. Strong aroma with citrus flavors leaping out of the glass and coming through nicely on the palate. Loads of grapefruit and some sweet orange flavors and I almost feel like there's some mango in there as well. It seems a little softer than most IPA's. It's different but nice. Very drinkable and better than I had expected to be honest. A nice choice for an IPA from the Southeast."
"Not a hop bomb, nor is it that in your face, just a solid IPA. Thanks deaconbluez!"
"Opened a week after the freshness date, but still very enjoyable. Pours a deep copper color with a thick, creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the side of the glass. It has a wonderfully sweet, floral, perfume-like aroma that melds with a grapefruit character that is more typical of IPAs on the market. This grapefruit-laden, floral hop character is well-balanced, however, by an abundant but light malt sweetness. In addition, despite being an IPA, the bitterness is not overwhelming, making this a very easy-drinking selection. Two thumbs up."
"D-A sharp, hop forward, light bodied and fully sessionable IPA. A very nice brew that is the kind of beer you would be happy to have as your local."
"d: easily drinkable, a fine ipa"
"Overall, a great example of an IPA. If I had regular access to this beer, I think it would challenge Furious's permanent spot in my fridge. Great beer, thanks a bunch Ben!"
"D- This is the kind of IPA that will get me in trouble. It is very drinkable and you will quickly put them back without even knowning you did. I would recommend this beer to anyone who has not tried it and like citrusy IPA's."
"Drinkability- Not sure of the freshness on this but I'm assuming with the dry hopping this thing is fruit galore when fresh. It's still got a fairly crisp zing but you can tell the hops have faded a bit. Still damned good though!! Thanks much Marc!"
"drinkability is good. an easy-going IPA with a very drinkable aura. the tropical hops are very fresh and the aftertaste is solid. cheers!"
"Not a big fan of the 420, but this one has merit. I personally love the hops and was quite surprised. Pours a hazy, dirty brown with lots of carbonation present. Head is medium/thin and leaves soapy lace. I'm still a newb, so I haven't identified the hop, but I absolutely love it. Not as refined as a few other IPA's but still very, very good. Thank you sweetwater, can't wait to try this off the tap."
"D - Very drinkable IPA...this one goes down easy. Plenty of bitterness and hop flavor, but well balanced, everything blends well without any one aspect being overpowering. Balanced on the hop side of the equation, but definitely balanced."
"Not what I expected, but it still tasted good. Usually I like more hoppiness in an IPA, the sweet, toasty malt in this made it more like an American Pale Ale, but very enjoyable. Would rather have this than a lot of other beers"
"The smell is initially that of a tropical and citrus fruit basket. Unfortunately, as the beer nears room temperature it completely falls apart as the grains start to show more. The same thing happens in the taste, however the mango and lemon remain in the flavor and match with a light caramel flavor. The body is full but sort of grainy. I could drink this often and in great quantity. This beer would be perfect for those hot days mowing the lawn."
"Drinkability: This is a very different beer than I remember. Whether this is due to my changed palate since October 2005, or whether the brewery has tweaked the recipe, or whether it's just an artifact of the growler vs. the bottle, I can't say. In any case, this is a very good IPA, although the characteristics seem to vary widely between the bottle and the growler."
"I like this, and I am very glad AL upped its ancient beerlaws so us Mississippians can cross the border and get acces to this beer goodness, one more please!"
"D: This is easily one of the better IPAs out there."
"D: Quite high actually, it's very easy drinking and almost ""sessionable"" compared to some IPAs."
"D-To me, drinkability is very high. I can go through a six pack without even realizing it. Well, until the ABV hits you, which, while moderate, is still high enough to do some damage if your hopheadedness leads you to chug them down."
"D: An easy drinker with little evidence of any alcoholic punch. The balance between malt and hops makes this one go down easy."
"Overall a good IPA, well balanced with a decent body."
"D - decent session IPA, nothing FANTASTIC, but overall pretty darn good in all facets."
"D: Excellent drinkability despite its 6.7% ABV. Perfect finish to a hot summer day! Many thanks again to Pullen for this delicious treat!"
"D: I could see myself purchasing a sixer of these on a hot summer day if I had them available here. I'm just glad I've got two. Pretty pretty good."
"Sadly, for the haters, I cannot rank this beer poorly. This IPA is wonderful. It is pale/copper in color with a decent white head. There is a bit of haze and a small bit of hop dust at the bottom. It smells like an overly ripened ruby red grapefruit. The taste is all grapefruit and orange peel. The mix of citrus flavors and light body makes this so easy to consume. It is now my go-to beer for a relaxing evening in the summer. My suggestion to anyone that loves IPAs and ranked this beer below A, is to go out and look for a fresh bottle and try it again. Sweetwater IPA is a baby Sculpin. Similar hop character without the degree of intensity. Absolutely wonderful."
"Pours a hazy, brownish-gold, solid layer of foam on top which retains well. Good lacing. Aroma is sticky, citrusy hops. Grapefruit rind, grapefruit juice, and a sweetish malt note in the background, kind of like honey or something. Taste is big time grapefruit, huge hop flavor but very little bitterness. A bit of malt in the background but it is really the hops that take center stage. Overall, the taste and smell are very clean, refined, huge emphasis on the citrus notes. Finishes real smooth, extremely drinkable. This is a very good IPA and a good showcase for citrusy hops. If I could get this beer in eastern NC, it would make regular appearances in my fridge."
"D- OK, but the aroma doesn't make you want to immediately jump back in for another sip"
"Poured a mellow orange/amber color with a bright white head. The aroma is great - a strong bouquet of grapefruit, lemon peel, and tangerines. The taste is hop heavy, but not overbearing - very citrusy with a little malty sweetness. It finishes crisp, and moderately bitter. Overall, a very drinkable IPA if you enjoy citrusy, west coast hops."
"Pours a clear and effervescent amber color with a big loose foamy head that resists fading. Sheets of Belgian lacing. The smell has a candied floral character. On the lighter side body-wise, although the flavor is sweet with descent hoppy tangyness. The taste is rather understated compared to the nose and cleans up quickly. Not a bad drinker."
"D - Easy drinking and very enjoyable. If I ever find myself in Atlanta, this would be one to search out! Very enjoyable"
"Hazed brassy color with rocky froth whiffs of Humboldt County's finest - herbal, minty, with citrus, floral notes, yikes this stuff smells sticky icky. Nicely dry hopped, which contributes to the beer's aroma, refers to the technique when a brewer throws in hops after the beer has finished cooking. A bit of bready malt balances out the brew and is accentuated by a soft, fruity yeast. Very nice brew!"
"Never have been a huge Sweetwater fan although many of my friends are. All of their brews seem to just miss with me."
"This was a nice surprise. A quality, drinkable IPA that's more on the sweet side than bitter."
"M: Relatively light bodied and a smooth beer with decent drinkability. If it tasted better I'd probably spend some money on it but alas. Just not to my liking but really nothing wrong with this beer--I'd still say give it a try if you like grapefruity IPA's haha."
"Overall this is a great IPA, considering style guidelines this has a nice bitterness and has a nice ABV for an IPA."
"I'm in the middle of a sampler six-pack from Sweetwater, and have been pleasantly surprised by their IPA offering. Looking forward to the other types but will definitely try this one again if given the opportunity, particularly on tap."
"Easiest IPA to drink ever. I don't know how they gave the beer such a strong flavor that is so easy to drink. This is an IPA that won't let you down."
"This is one of my favorite beers from Sweerwater, it pours with a two finger creamy white head. It laces the glass like rings of a tree trunk. You can literally count every sip. The color is a nice amber, maybe a little haze. The aroma is like fresh cut grass, you just know that first sip is going to have a nice hop flavor. The taste is very reminiscent of grapefruit, it coats the tongue and lingers, giving you a chance to savor it. The mouthfeel is moderate, a little resiny, but very drinkable. This is a beer worth seeking out."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with dense whitish head, fades to a thin layer but the lacing is nice. Smell: mango, grapefruit, resiny pine and a little spiciness. Mild milk caramel sweetness in the back. Taste: sweet grapefruit and orange flesh upfront, flash of pine, citrus rind, a little spicy. Hop flavor centric, just bitter enough, with a nice pale and caramel malt backdrop. When fresh (and this is fresh - best by 10/16 and drank 8/2), this is one of the best IPAs in the country."
"Easy to drink, if you like citrusy IPA's."
"overall, I did not really care for this bier. Not a typical pale ale. Try it if you want..."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation."
"To be honest I didn't have particularly high expectations for this beer. I think I had a bottle of it last summer when I was here (in Atlanta) visiting my parents and wasn't impressed. But I figured I should drink a local beer, and an IPA sounded good to me... Well, allow me to retract my earlier opinion. Sweetwater IPA is a delicious beer. When it's fresh, this beer can stand its ground against any American IPA I've had... Really, it's very good. However, if it's a old, it might only be mediocre."
"This isn't too out of the ordinary, but a very solid IPA."
"It's quite drinkable."
"balanced bitterness...frothy, and strong, stand-alone body...believe me, you'll drink more than one during one sitting...it's impossible not to...great ipa from sweetwater..."
"This would be wonderful with some nice ceviche of shrimp, squid, and scallops marinaded in lime juice, cilantro, and chilis on a hot summer day. Very nice beer that should be a regular IPA for all who have it available."
"D- i could drink this all day long. one of my favorite IPAs of all time. check this one out if given the chance, it doesnt get the attention it deserves."
"Drinkability: I would say pretty high - I really like the flavor and it's not an especially challenging beer -- just a straight forward and bitter IPA with a nice clean finish. It's refreshing and doesn't pack too much of a punch. Good all around."
"D: Good balance in this one that makes it a definate sessionable beer. I could go for a few. I'm glad I brought back a six pack of this beer from Atlanta."
"D - This is absolutely my favorite fully available Sweetwater offering, probably the most affordable of my highly rated IPA's. and should be considered a staple of the local Atlanta bars."
"This is a pretty unique IPA and I want more dammit!"
"Very light amber in color with some orange hues making it look a bit grapefruitish. A two-finger dirty white head wisps away quickly and leaves a craggly lacing behind. Aroma consists of resiny hops with a good grapefruity base. A little pine and malt waft up upon closer inspection. Tastes pretty much the same with a bit more sugar covered citrus involved. Has a medium mouth-feel, and there's plenty of carbonation involved. Excellent IPA that approaches FFF Alpha-land."
"FWIW: I typically compare my IPA's to Bell's Two Hearted and this one is maltier with a softer tropical fruit hop character rather the bigger citrus, orange type hops in Bell's."
"Maybe this brew has changed my mind on IPA's. It was a solid beer with mild complexities that I wasn't truly prepared for. A big thumbs up in my book!"
"medium body. resins again in the finish. crisp yet controlled carbonation."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and little dry. The body of the beer is medium and the finish lingers for a little bit. This beer is descent IPA, but the malt is flimsy. I the beer had a little more hops and a stronger backbone this would be a really nice IPA."
"Poured from a bottle and in to my DFH semi tulip pint glass. Pours a very cloudy amber color, the clouds swirl threw the beer and look to carry alot of flavor. The aroma is of a citrusy hops and floral notes. The flavor was actually very similar to a Stone Ruination for me but not as harsh. The Hops were very prominant and were a specific hops that are a bit to bitter for me. In the Ruination the beer's hops killed my taste buds quickly but this beer the flavor lasted which I was very happy for. The medium body and alcohol level makes the drinkability pretty good. Would like to try other beers from this craft brewery."
"I can honestly admit that I wasn't expecting a ton from this Atlanta brewery but this was outstanding. Definitely top five and maybe top 3 for best American IPAs I've ever had and that includes almost all of the big boys. There is something just eminently drinkable about this brew that I can't get enough of. I need to find more soon; at $8 a sixer, this could easily be my summer drinking IPA."
"D: Session written all over this one, easy drinking, not very challenging to the palate, but it's subtlety is a strength here."
"Flavor presents a pleasant balance of floral & piny hops and toasted, biscuity malt notes. Hints of herbal tea and grass clippings linger into the finish...a touch of cardboard, too. Body is thinner than expected on the palate, and the uppity carbonation level doesn't help. Still, the hoppy bitter finish is solid. All in all, a good IPA that I would gladly try again, but considering how flooded the craft beer market is with this style, I can't say that Sweetwater's version stood out from the rest of the pack."
"Medium-full body. Rich flavor. Carbonation level is appropriate. Smooth drinker. Very easy, and enjoyable, to put back several of these. This is one I'll keep on hand both for myself, and for trade throw-ins. Great stuff."
"Pours a great copper color- what I like to see from an IPA. Smellwise, I'm unimpressed- there's some citrus aroma coming through, but it's relatively subdued. Taste is much improved however- plenty of grapefruity citrusy hops. Very well balanced and not too sweet. Mouthfeel is great- substantial without being meaty. Very impressive IPA imo- up there with some of the best single IPA's I've had."
"D- Very good. One of my top 5 favorite IPAs."
"D- Nicely balanced IPA. Refreshing and easily drinkable."
"Pours a slightly gazed amber with a creme head. Flavor is heavy on the bitter with a pine and resin tone. Feel is well bodied on the liquid and the carbonation is fairly noticeable. This is a good IPA. Some might consider it rough around the edges, but if you are looking for something intense, I think you'll like it."
"D: Not bad. If they could push a bit more flavor out of this one it would be world class...."
"M/D - nice bitterness, taste and carbonation. I would grab one of these any day."
"M/D: Light to medium body, a little slick, carbonation is slightly prickly. Drinkability is good. A pretty solid IPA."
"I had this on tap in Nashville awhile back and it was great. Not so good in the bottle."
"D - Easy to drink IPA with a clean, dry finish and a pleasant grassy/fruity hop profile. Good balance and appearance. I'd definitely take a second if I had another bottle."
"My first Sweetwater brew. Pours wonderfully into my Sam Adams sensory glass. Nice frothy head and wonderful smell to match. I can definitely smell the hoppiness of this brew. The taste is magical. The bitterness matches the smell. I love the fact this beer is unfiltered, giving it a distinctive look, smell and taste. At 6.7 percent ABV, this IPA definitely packs a punch. But, like ROCKY, I can handle it. Definitely my kind of IPA. A wonderful beer. Thanks Sweetwater."
"D- Very well balanced and crisp. Great bitterness and just an overall easy drinker."
"Quality brewery and I'm a fan of some of their other offerings (Sweet GA Brown & 420)...but I'll always pass on their IPA."
"D= Very high. I really like this beer. I think it's got great balance for a hop forward IPA. The finish with the malt is ridiculous. Great IPA"
"Good carbonation. Goes down smoothly. Would be great to enjoy in the sun or shade on a spring day. I am a sweetwater fan so I was looking forward to trying the ipa. It didn't disappoint me on this hoppy kick I am on."
"Good, I wouldnt turn one down if handed to me, but not sure I would choose it over very many other IPAs."
"If you've seen this brew and haven't had it yet...you really need to go get some."
"I'm a huge hop-aroma fanatic, especially this sort of blend of hops. I'm not sure what's involved exactly... cascade, amarillo, others I'm sure. But I love it."
"Sweetwater urges ""don't float the mainstream"". Although this offering diverges far off the path of commercial macro products it doesn't stand out in the stream of America's flourishing micro breweries. I liked this a lot but the fact is: there's plenty of fish in the sea. That being said, I'm happy to have caught it - this isn't one you'd throw back in!"
"Poured a deep yellow color with a small white head. Nose is hoppy, citrus, floral with lots of hops. You can feel a dry hop in this beer on the taste. Lots of floral and light citrus notes. Pretty big and tasty IPA overall by Sweeetwater. Worth a try for sure."
"D + notes: This is a good offering. It has some English IPA qualities to it in some ways, with the more subtle and balanced flavours and scents. I quite enjoyed this beer, and would look forward to another."
" Served in the airport special 20oz size, very very fresh , excellent glass lacing and a honied amber color. great aroma of fresh cut grass, pine, and floral aromas. the taste reminds me of Pliny(slightly watered down and not quite as deep) but no matter, a comparison to what for me is a world class IPA says a lot about this beer. Had some other tastes of this brewery's beer and very suprised. If I am ever in atlanta I will seek this place out. Very good beer but this one stood out above the rest. For a BA who prides himself as a discerning hophead, this was a great IPA. worth drinking anyplace, anytime, airports included. Seek it out and you will not be disappointed. Cheers to the Sweetwater brewers!"
"Smells great. Nice floral and citrusy hops and some nice sweet maltiness. Taste similar to smell great hop flavor, very citrus almost lemony and some nice malt too balance. Tons of awesome hop flavor and not too much hop bitterness. Well done Sweetwater."
"Smell is very green, sticky icky hops. These come through even more in the taste. Don't know if it was intended or the hops just weren't ready. But it's a bit too much to get past. Different."
"D= For a beer that I had never even heard of and that I acquired as an ""extra: in a trade, this was a freaking awesome beer! Totally flavorful, and i could drink a bunch of these in a sitting for sure. Wow!"
"9/4/9/5/17 (4.4/5)"
"A very well made local IPA."
"There is a rather nice mouthfeel to the Sweetwater IPA even given the intense hop nature that is in the taste. With a moderate carbonation level, there is a nice smoothness to the beer that works its way across the palate nicely. Though a strong IPA in nature, the mouthfeel is certain well balanced enough to have plenty of different beer drinkers find this offering as being a well rounded IPA."
"This really is the quinticential grapefruit beer. Huge citrus flavor with a nice tangy bite at the end. Great hop bitterness. Finishes bready. Slight sweet notes in there as well. This is plenty drinkable. It is a thirst-quencher for sure. Highly recommend."
"If this were my local IPA, I doubt I could be happier. I could drink this one 'til I explode. An all around solid IPA with so many good things going for it, it's hard to nitpick. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall a really nice IPA that's meant to appeal to the masses. Nothing amazing, but well done!"
"D: easily drinkable, just suffers from lack of flavor"
"Had this on draft at the SweetWater location in the Atlanta airport. Pours a rustic orange with a fluffy head that leaves nice thick lace on the glass. Smell is very citrus with hints of nice apricots and outdoor goodness. This is a great smelling IPA and one that will stick with me for some time. Taste is out of this world the hop profile is not a palate burner but very subtle. Hints of orange and pine with a bit of a lingering hop bitterness towards the end. This was my first offering from Sweetwater and man was is awesome, this has to be one the best IPA's that I have ever tasted."
"D - A great IPA, I definitely prefer the ever present sweetness to balance things out. Mouthfeel makes this all the more easy to session."
"Pours a nice orange copper color, deeper than I expected. Decent head, but would like to see more oomph. Nose is all citrus, the taste is grapefruit all the way. A very nice IPA but really is dying for more depth in flavor, and a longer finish, Fresh , refreshing very clean IPA, and good enough to buy by the case. Taste profile resembles Hopslam with a big grapefruit hit, but not as pungent or quite the hammer on the palate. It starts out strong and finishes a little weak, but it's still a tasty brew."
"D - oh, yeah..."
"This is a very good IPA out of the bottle, but the tap version I had recently is markedly better. Nonetheless, this is Sweetwater's best year-round bottle by some margin."
"This one pours a deep, hazy, almost opaque coppery amber with a thick, orangy-tan head that sticks around for a bit. Aroma is strong and very evergreenish. Flavor is seriously hoppy, like drinking a pine tree, with just a whisper of sweetness, and mildly bitter. Texture is smooth and jazzy, very pleasing, leaving an evergreen aftertaste. I have had this in a bottle, and it is better on-tap! Strongly recommended to all hops fans."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but not a great one. All the flavors are tasty, but just too tame for an IPA. Bump it up a couple of notches fellas, and this could be a great beer. I would try this on tap, if given the chance, but won't be seeking out another bottle anytime soon. Too many great IPA's out there."
"Unfortunately, Sweetwater Brewery (Atlanta, GA) has limited distributorship and it's only available in 4-5 states. If you are in the south or as far west as North Carolina....you gotta try this IPA"
"Very nice IPA."
"This is a very different IPA. Despite what I feel about the cat urine smell and taste, this beer levels out and is quite enjoyable."
"D-Strong drinkability, due to its ease of consumption, but also largely because of its tasty and appropriate hoppiness. This is a fun beer to enjoy, perhaps a bit too hoppy and strong for a session, but easily smooth enough to crack a couple open."
"I could drink a few of these, however i notice a slight alcohol numbness on the palate towards the end of the first one. Theres that 6.7%alc that didnt seem to be there earlier."
"This beer pours a copper orange color with a small head that quickly disappears. The aroma is floral and citrusy and a little piny. The taste follows the smell, starts smooth and ends bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth but a tad thin. Drinkability is decent. I could probably drink two of these. Overall, not a bad IPA."
"D- Probably one of the most balanced IPA's I ever had. Highly recommended for sure."
"Drink up if you can get it in your area!"
"Drinkability is good. Not thick or overly hoppy, actually quite nice. Just didn't hit the taste target for me. Still an enjoyable & quality brew."
"*Side note - I have not had their Donkey Punch yet but I have had all of their other stuff."
"D: At 6.7% this is soooo drinkable. If only this was distributed up my way I would probably always have some of this in the fridge! Thanks to Ben (bhalter8) for hooking me up with this one, I'm definitely going to need to get some more of this!"
"Starts out with a wonderful aroma and finishes so smooth, you can barely tell that you had it. Feels balanced and I would definitely drink another."
"A local favorite for me... a solid, but not overwhelming IPA. Pours a light reddish/copper color with a light, ""bubbly"" head. The smell is a nice combination of citrus and strong hops (I realize hops are obvious in an IPA, but I do find some lacking in the aroma, which this certainly does not). Taste includes that strong hops character as well, without being overdone, which also can be the case with these ""West Coast"" style IPAs. A crisp, but not too bitter mouthfeel adds to what I feel is a very drinkable IPA. I find myself easily drinking these while watching baseball in the summer, or my ""go to"" beer at a grocery store when I have to grab something fast."
"Since I sat down to take a look at this and have been writing the whole time I'm just realizing that it's almost gone. Guess that's my answer. This would be almost perfect for a session IPA. Beautiful Chemistry in a solid Southern package."
"Pours a mostly clear honey/orange color, foamy off-white head fades pretty quickly and leaves a few splotches of lace on the glass. A metric shit-ton of grapefruit on the nose, some tangerine fighting for attention, and a nice caramel backbone. Taste is just an all-out citrus riot....grapefruit, tangerine, clementine, slightly bitter grassy element here...you could argue that the taste is a little one-dimensional, with the huge grapefruit/citrus presence, but it's just plain tasty. Something about the flavor profile on this beer just dazzles me, and this is kind of ""it"" for me when it comes to IPAs. Refreshing, nice lingering bitterness. I could drink this all day, all year. So good."
"O-Pretty decent IPA but very rought about the edges, Could use a little time to mellow"
"Drinkability: well, I can, and have, drunk this all day. Despite the harsh at times mouthfeel gos down well and makes you want another. Or two."
"M/D - Medium bodied and it coats the mouth as you drink. Very drinkable IPA but not quite the taste I am looking for."
"Delicious brew!"
"I really liked this beer! I've had a lot of Sweetwater's 420 Pale Ale over the years, but this was my first run at this one. It is a lovely IPA that hits you head on with a rare and delectable fruity nose that foreshadows the wonderful hops that you'll relish on the tastebuds. The color is golden amber, with a nice whitish head and good lacing. On the palate, this is a superb beer. It nicely blends a complex malt with a sophisticated multilayered hop across the tongue and a perfectly bittered finish. Very good mouthfeel with perfect texture and a refreshing carbonation. This will become one of my favorites."
"I like this brew a lot. Why isn't this more highly rated? It kicks ass.."
"D - Very smooth and easy to drink. A great session beer. This is my favorite IPA made in the southeast."
"Drinkabilty is good. Its amazing I haven't tried this before. I'll probably pick it up again soon."
"In my impression, an average IPA. Good to try, but thats about it. I might have had an old bottle so will try again."
"A rocky light tan head sits full and fluffy leaving some lace as it slowly fades. Body is a pure amber sap in color. Nose has some citrus rind, soapy alchol and prickley pine but all relatively soft. A nice mix of crisp approachable hops and fruity citrus based sweet sour feel enter the mouth on first sip. Hops turn creamy on the back of the tongue as you continue to drink. Malt balance is really there also. Bitter does develop on the mouthfeel but it is pleasant. Super easy to drink, very well made IPA. Would have been close to a 4.5 if the nose was a little more developed."
"I think this is an extremely drinkable IPA. I could drink this brew all evening."
"Wow! Very nicely done. This one will become a staple in my fridge since I can find it at a nearby grocery."
"I had this on tap at Taco Macs in Douglasville. The beer is copper color, clear, with a thin white foam that left a solid sheet of lace on the glass. The aroma is intensely good, loads of hops with a caramel malt background. The hops are citrusy, mostly I get grapefruit. The taste is just as good, not too bitingly bitter, just deliciously hoppy with a sweet malty balance (but leaning uncompromisingly towards hops, like a fat guy on a seesaw with a child). A very good beer that would be welcomed in Ohio if distribution ever goes that far."
"D- Yes please!"
"Very solid IPA here. I'd be glad to drink this with regularity if it were available around here."
"I could enjoy several of these."
"Really delicious example of the style."
"Drinkability- If I would have known how tasty these suckers were and how easily they go down, I would have traded for a case instead of one bottle. In a blind tasting, I would guess this beer was brewed by Bell's. It is like the Southeastern cousin of Two Hearted, which is a high compliment in my book. I hope the other SE IPA's and DIPA's in my fridge are this good."
"Tastes well balanced. 3 headed monster - Bright tangy hops up front (cascade?), malty middle and a crisp, dry finish. This is a damn good brew. Best sweetwater beer I have had, although I have not had Happy Ending or Donkey Punch."
"Another Sweetwater beer I wouldn't mind finding in my fridge more often. Happy and hoppy."
"Sweetwater IPA pours a nice deep copper color with a two finger head on top. It smells fantastic. I can smell the aroma even before putting my nose to the top of the glass. I can detect malt, hops, and citrus. The taste is delicious. This beer is the perfect combination of flavors. I have found in my beer tastings that I prefer beers with a balance of flavors. This beer from Sweetwater is the perfect example. There is plenty of malt sweetness balanced with a hoppy bitterness all sitting on top of a great citrus flavor. This beer is proof that the South can produce a fine IPA. I am proud of Sweetwater and wish them much success. Sweetwater IPA will be in my heavy rotation from now on."
"A new fave for the Sweetwater brews."
"Sampled this American style IPA on tap at the airport in Atlanta, GA. Finally, a nice head on a Sweetwater beer! Tan with medium sized bubbles capping a deep, deep orange color like pumpkin paste. The nose was full of hops, bitter and poignant. Pineapple and pine! The flavors were equally bold as though the beer has been dry-hopped during brewing. Sharp and tart, hops, citrus, honey and malt to balance. Well thought out and quite drinkable. Medium/high carbonation, has some gumption and a smooth mouthfeel. A fine drink, to be sure."
"Overall this one seems to go down very smoothly with a strong hop display and some stand-out quality from among other IPAs, though not as balanced or nuanced as some others. It's still a pretty great beer."
"D: This is definitely a drinkable beer. It has a big personality, but this is never off-putting in any way."
" I really like fruity IPA's."
"Very good beer. It's a very good example of an IPA, if you haven't tried it at some point already check it out."
"This was actually the first IPA I ever had, way back when I started drinking craft beer. Back then I liked it, but I don't think I had the same appreciation as I do now. This one is well crafted with great flavor, and has good balance. Recommended."
"D: Goes down smooth because of its (relatively) balanced flavor and great mouthfeel. I'll definitely be picking up some more of this next time I'm in Georgia."
"D - This is a beer that I'm fairly certain that I would -not- want to quaff: it has a dynamic flavor when held in the mouth, and I'm content to just sip on this one. The crispness and cleanliness of this ipa really enhance the drinkability for me. My favorite ipa to date - yay for local beer!"
"This was a great one to follow up the Hoptical Illusion with."
"Drinkability was rather poor. While the aroma was punchy yet inviting, the taste was harsh, bitter and unbalanced. Toward the end of the glass, the beer became rather difficult to put down."
"D: I'd drink another!"
"Poured into a pint glass (sign on the wall stated the beer was 6.9% ABV). The beer poured a nice orange-red with a thin cream colored head that was not retained at all. I think that the lack of head had more to do with the pour than the beer, but not the fact that it did not last. The aroma was a heavy floral but the hops squarely in the background and not as pronounced as I would have thought. The taste was OK, but it really followed the aroma, heavy on the floral with a hint of hops. The beer had good carbonation and it left you with a nice bitter aftertaste. Overall the drinkability was slightly better than average as it was smooth and creamy. I would probably drink again."
"I thought the appearance and smell was pretty decent. It smelled really hoppy and strong. But compared to some of the other IPAs I have tried it was not my favorite at all. I believe the balance was a little off. The mouthfeel was good and I could probably drink this again. But I probably wont."
"A great bitter (but not over the top) IPA that is very easily drinkable and quite enjoyable. I could easily enjoy several of these in one session."
"D- this tasted great on the fourth of july which was sunny and warm, and I would have liked to have a few more of these. very easy drinking."
"Pours an attractive medium to rich amber with an offwhite head that hangs around for a bit. Smell is fruity and earthy hops. Perhaps some light citrusy quality. Flavor is thin and mildly bittered up front, while the body is average. Light malt backing and it needed more hops for my taste. Kind of hop tea like, I thought. Not bad, but not one of my preferred IPAs."
"Good West Coast-style IPA from the South. Not my favorite offering from Sweetwater, but woudn't turn it down if offered."
"D: Pretty good IPA here, imagine it's even better really fresh."
"Drinkability: Very nice. Lots of hop flavor and presence for the hopheads, but not lacking in other departments either. A decent alcohol level (6.9%) and no bizarre off flavors make this a fairly drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is high. Low alcohol and good flavors make for easy consumption."
"Overall a very good IPA, hard to believe that this is at 6.7% because I feel it is almost sessionable. Great example of the style and some promise that Southern breweries will one day catch up with the rest of the country. . when they are allowed to."
"Thanks everetends for the bottle"
"I got this on tap in 33oz glasses. I was at Spondivits in Atlanta, GA. I was th first pour off a new keg. The beer was served very cold, which helped to make this such a refreashing drink. It is an IPA with a very low citrus flavor. If you have opportunity the 33oz glass is a delightful ride."
"I was disappointed that it had temporarily sold out on my way back home."
"Pours a somewhat hazy dark copper hue with a generous two finger off-white head that slowly falls leaving a thick layer of webbing on the sides of the glass. Smell is oily slick hops with some floral notes. A fair amount of caramel malt and earthy hops as well. I could use more citrus sweetness in the nose. Taste begins with a smooth caramel malt followed by over ripe grapefruit and gritty hops. Cane sugar and buttered biscuits with a dirty hop aftertaste. Creamy medium body with slick feel. Mild carbonation on the tongue. The label proclaims it to be a ""mammoth IPA"". Maybe, but it's mammoth on the malty side for the style. I like my IPA's with a good amount of citrus hops, so I can't say this is a favorite of mine. Solid IPA, worth a shot."
"D: Just a damned good beer. It not heavy, or is it too sticky. It doesn't wear on you like over hopped west coasters tend to. This is not a west coast hop bomb, and I am not trying to sell it as one. What it is is an easy drinking IPA with fantastic, big time flavors and aromas. Its not going to wreck you with bitterness or dryness but it has those qualities. This is a beer that needs the respect it deserves. Fine crafted IPA that is certainly a diamond in the rough of Southern offerings."
"Highly drinkable IPA for its strength, probably has a slight edge over DFH's 60-minute brew, and a tad more drinkable. As sessionable as an IPA can be. A great brew from Sweetwater."
"I'm not sure what hops are used in Sweetwater's IPA, but they're not my personal favorites. Overall, it's still a very tasty and flavorful brew and I really enjoyed it during my layover."
"HV"
"6 pk $8...11 cents per oz."
"Taste is not overwhelming with the hops but a good balance with the malt, there is a bitterness but not overdone and with a slight sweetness, some puckering from the grapefruit and citrus aspects."
"Very easily an enjoyable session IPA. This is my first Sweetwater beer and I hope it won't be my last."
"I expected to like this one since Sweetwater rarely disappoints. However, I was not expecting to like it this much. I will definitely be buying again."
"I was suprised by the boldness of this beer. This is a true IPA through and through. It has prescence and bite. I am a fan of IPA's - this IPA certainly has a bold, distinguishing taste to it. There is no denying the hops! It poured well with a light coloring."
"Special thanks to Maria for picking this up for me on her travels."
"D- Could easily drink this all night. Great IPA, nothing that will blow you away. This is done right though."
"Relatively light bodied in my opinion, everything seems to hit late on. Drinkability is good as well. Not sure if I would sit an drink an entire 6-pack in one sitting though."
"A very nice AIPA and would buy more of this if available in these parts. Nothing really wows you with the beer but it is pretty damn good and would recommend to hopheads and non-hopheads alilke."
"D - Solid IPA. My first beer from Sweetwater. I would definitely like to sample more of their brews down the road."
"Holy crap, I almost forgot how good this is. Pours a solid amber with a nice fluffy head and great lacing down the glass. Smell is so strong of fresh and juicy citrus. Grapefruit is the main culprit and a sugary sweet malt is also present. About as great as it gets, with hops winning but malts providing a solid backbone that keeps it in place. A crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Slightly bitter and drying finish. Mouth watering. Excellent drinkability. It's gone before you know it. An all around classic IPA in my book. I need to pick this up more often, damn!"
"D - Well balanced with excellent hop character, easily drinkable. I have been less than impressed with most of what I have had from Sweetwater, but this IPA is a wonderful exception."
"D - This is the kind of beer that I want to come home to after a day of work and sit back with and enjoy the hops its worth a try"
"Bright golden color. Not a lot of head or carbonation. Nice hoppy aroma-a lot of grapefruit in there. Fantastic hop flavor. Not overly bitter but a great, great hop flavor across the board. Killer malty sweetness to offset the hops. Really a great tasting beer. Touch of lingering bitterness. Nice body-not too big or thin. Simply a great US IPA. A style that can really run the gamut of flavors. They nailed this one for sure. I could do this all night."
"Fantastic extra Marc! This would be a regular in my fridge if I had access to it.. I prefer a little maltier IPA.. and the Sweetwater delivers nicely."
"Overall, this is a decent IPA and is one of the better offerings of Sweetwater."
"Finish is dry and bitter with a little malt running fullback to keep it pleasant."
"I'm not a hopshead, but I love this beer! I think that attests to the nicely balanced malt in the backgroud that keep the hops from being overpowering. My favorite IPA to date, and IMO the best Sweetwater offering by far."
"This beer is in my top 5 and I was fortunate to have the wife travel to Atlanta. She picked me up a case. The first bottle was just as I remember, if not better. Very nice citrus, grapefruit smell from the hops. Nice balance. Definately my favorite session beer."
"D - Very drinkable, I could see myself going through a 12 pack on a hot summer day. This would make for a great session beer. I would love to try this one of tap someday."
"Chewy, medicinal hop taste. Sweet, syrupy hop finish. Definitely a palate coater. As hoppy as this is, very drinkable...scary."
"A solid IPA."
"Overall- This is a strong offering from Sweetwater. This one was from the bottle, but I have had it on tap at the brewery too. Both are equally enjoyable. I cannot believe that it has taken me this long to review this brew, but I am glad I did. I have found a new session beer that will be taken advantage of!"
"Awe inspiring in its unfiltered beauty, deep and almost amber in colour. Creamy off-white head left legit lace along the sides of the pint glass. Bright and floral aromas of sweet and citrusy goodness. Piney resins play well with just the right hint of malt sweetness for balance. Good bitterness to boot. Great body and high quaffability, for sure. It could be a little bit more crisp, as some others have said, but this is very, very well balanced. Perhaps one of the more well balanced, quality brews available that I have tried in the Southeast. Well done."
"D - I'm not much of a hop head and I found this to be a very enjoyable IPA..the hops were strong but balanced well and the grapefruit flavor and sweetness in the drink balance out well with the sweet malty caramel flavors"
"D - A hop driven IPA that is tasty."
"This is a very nice IPA. In fact, it's one of my favorites. I had to vacation in Florida to find it. It was worth the trip."
"D: Agreeably sessionable. Brightly and fully flavored--delicious, really--but not too heavy in the belly."
"Pours a gorgeous dark orange with a light brown two inch head that builds then falls leaving a creamy white head that has lacing sticking to the side. Smell is like a christmas tree, with a lot of strong pine, and a little earthy character too. Some citrus type smells left in the background. The taste is one of the best beers I've ever had. Citrus, mostly grapefruit taste, some pine followed by bitter hops. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for a refreshing taste in an IPA."
"Pours a hazed apricot with a finger of lively white head that dies rather quick and laces nice random sheets. Awesome smell. Floral, piney, juicy hops with grapefruit. Taste is a delight. Big hops, rind, grapefruit but backed by some malt that finally gives way to the hops at the end for nice bitter finish. Light in the mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability...lets just say if I lived in the ATL, this would be my drank all day, every day. Give this one a shot and be rewarded.."
"Had this one on draft at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Poured a hazy copper color with a nice white head. Aroma is sweet and of hops. Taste is citusy and very hoppy. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is way up there. I thought this was excellent and will have whenever I get the opportunity. Unfortunately, not available in Mississippi."
"D - A very drinkable IPA with a lot of flavor - this tastes fresh. I would enjoy this beer if I cross paths w/ it again. I think the feel is slightly undercarbonated, but has a very nice oily hop feel. It is a very good example of the IPA style."
"Aroma 4/5, Appearance 3/5, Taste 4/5, Palate 4/5, Drinkability 4/5: 3.8/5"
"Overall: A great citrusy domestic IPA, definitely worth a try. Certainly the best of the Sweetwater line that Ive tried so far."
"D: That bottle was my only one, looks like I need to add this to my 'Wants' list."
"Pours a clear coppery orange color with 1"" of off-white foamy head that reduces to a nice thin layer with heavy lacing. Smells are rich with grapefruit and piney hops with hints of honey and fruit sweetness. Taste is sweet up front before a bumrush of grapefruit followed by some balance from caramel and a good pine finish. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Very drinkable and different from other IPAs. Glad I have friends in Atlanta to hook me up with more of this, my 6-pack won't last very long!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - a most drinkable IPA, very sessionable."
"Drinkability is good. This is an enjoyable beer--but very strange with the intense tropical fruit aroma dominating the experience."
"This beer was a beautiful golden orange with a two inch solid white head which subsided slowly. The head left lacing on my glass and lasted until the last drop, nice and sticky. The smell was slightly piney with fruit aromas and was pretty strong. The taste followed the smell with some citrus, some bitterness ,and a little pine. The mouthfeel was the best part, it felt like a cask beer. This is the best IPA i have had that is under 6%. They really have a winner with this one. Yum!"
"Drinkability: Definitely one of Sweetwater's better beers!"
"Almost seems like a cross between American and Brit styles... a very nice IPA."
"Brown 12 oz bottle with best by 8/28/07 printed on the label. Pours a cloudy pale orange with a nice white creamy head. Aroma is very hoppy. Citrus and piney aromas dominate. The taste is a big citrus and pine hit up front with a clean malt finish. This could be a regular in my fridge if they only sold it in SC. Solid offering from the folks in Hotlanta."
"Pours a nice dark amber with some orange highlights. Decent initial head fades to a ring pretty quickly but leaves some okay lacing. The smell is of faintly bitter hops, apricots, and just a touch of that meatiness you find sometimes with Simcoe hops. Nice. More apricot up front in the taste, but this fades to a more conventional hop bitterness with some citrus and pine. There is a nice malty backbone, but the hops are definitely have the upper hand. Deep bitter aftertaste, and I don't get any of the meatiness I caught in the aroma. Really nice session ipa. This one makes it easy to support the local brewery. Crisp mouthfeel and medium body. refreshing and drinkable. It's 93 degrees and sunny right now- this one quenches my thirst and gives me a nice hop hit at the same time. My favorite beer from this brewery."
"Pours a nice deep golden/amber color. Pretty good American hop aroma. Hop flavoring is, again, classic American profile, well balanced (almost too balanced for its style) by a fair amount of pale malt. This beer is VERY drinkable, however. I could drink one of these every day, especially considering the relatively low price tag. Nice job Sweetwater, much better than the 420 pale ale."
"Certainly a session beer, and a top-notch IPA; this one can stand tall among any IPA collection. Wish we could get it regularly up here; it would quickly supplant my Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as my stand-by. This is, in my opinion and of the ones I've had, the best Sweetwater brew so far."
"FINALLY...Simcoe hopped beer in Atlanta. This a a very well balanced IPA using Simcoe hops. Think citrus, apricot and a distant, but distinct grassy taste. If you nver had this beer, and never experienced Simcoe hops, try this one. This beer deswerves more recognition now that they started using Simcoe hops."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Nice dense white head. Copper color, unfiltered, but not cloudy. The hops are huge in the aroma; I'm not sure what type/s are used, but the smell of Amarillo hops come to mind (I could be completely wrong). The taste is bitter dominanted with a slight malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a lingering bitterness throughout. So much so that is drys out your tongue. I sat down with two no problem. A hopheads IPA!"
"I heard this brew was overhauled a while back. I don't know if that's true, but it certainly tastes different than I remember. I also think the alcohol content might have been raised a bit from the 5.90% listed in the description on BA. (The Sweetwater website was showing a content above 6%.)"
"Taste is very nice, citrus aromatic hops, very definite IPA style. Very hoppy but the hops are almost all aromatic, not bittering. This is a fine example of an IPA, hoppy as hell but not bitter, malty enough to stand up to the hops and very drinkable. I almost can't wait to mow the lawn so I can have one after."
"Super sessionable IPA, a simple, straight-forward IPA. Not supper aggresive IPA, just a very quaffable one!"
"A disclaimer to start; this bottle lists a best by date of 3/2/07 and was consumed on 3/21/07, so it was slightly past peak. It has a very clear amber body with very little head. The aroma is not powerful but is all hops. I can't quite place the aroma but it is primarily grapefruit, but a much more bitter grapefruit than normal. The flavor is primarily grapefruit as well with a slight bitterness at the end, but it isn't as bitter as the aroma is. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both good."
"I found this IPA to be decently drinkable, as I think I could drink a few of them. The flavor took a moment to catch on, but I realize it is pretty solid and worth trying..."
"Drinkability: Very high! This is a very good beer!"
"Bottle courtesy of blitz134. Thanks!"
"Thanks to pugman for sending this one my way. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a shaker glass. BB: 3-2-07. Appears a very clear golden amber color with two fingers of egg shell colored foam . Minimal lacing left on the glass with each sip. Smells of pineapple, sweet malts, and white grapefruit juice. Tastes of lemon, grapefruit, mildly bitter hops that are nicely balanced by the malt presence. Finish is dry and bitter. A very drinkable IPA. Well done Sweetwater."
"Slainte!"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden copper color, with some nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet, hoppy, citrusy, and slight caramel. The taste is hoppy, and citrusy, very tasty. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice IPA, glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"Poured a cloudy pale orange with a nice white creamy head that lced up well. Smell was strong and very hoppy. Citrus flavors abounded this. The taste was wonderful. Big citrus and pine pop up front with a dry hopped back. All hops, no real balance on this, and non needed. Could easily drink this all night! Goin to get more ASAP!"
"Nice bottle out of Atlanta!"
"A very sessionable IPA. Nice hop flavor, but not a palate crusher. Purchased this on my last trip to Alabama back in October, and decided to roll with it again over Thanksgiving. My only complaint is that it seems to be a bit one dimensional. I like the flavor, but if the grapefruit was complemented/contrasted a bit more, I think this would be a better beer."
"Thanks to SilentSabre for including a few of these."
"D-I could have 2 then the long lingering bitterness would force me to move on. But I would come back"
"This is a wonderfully hoppy thirst quencher."
"d - incredibly refreshing beer that really smooths out as it warms. top notch beer and one of the few in alabama (for now)."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Not one i would want everyday, but when i want hops, and grapefruits- this is one i would go for (if it was readily available down here)."
"Appearance - nice warm tan with slight cloudiness. I put little on this as I don't watch beer but drink it."
"D: I drank this one down fairly quickly for a review. Even though it may be a little sweeter than most IPA’s, it’s very tasty, not-too-filling and is the type of beer I could stick with for a long, long time. This was a very pleasant surprise for a beer that was added in to round out the trade. I think I’m now intrigued by this brewer and I’m going to have to deal for some more stuff from them."
"One of my favorite beers overall, the best you can get in AL, IMO."
"Taste- Some orange peel mixes with the toasty malts to give it a burnt orange peel hopp flavor. Clean hop presence. Not resiny or syrupy. Almost like a lager with IPA flavors."
"This beer is excellent."
"From BA Rammerjammer in Boaz, Al. - What else have you been hiding down in your parts, Mike?"
"Drinkability: An excellent mainstream IPA - not sure whether this is the new recipe or not - ""Best if Enjoyed by 5/5"""
"Medium body, perfect carbonation tickles your tongue. Such a smooth beer. Although its not high ABV it is still incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Incredibly refreshing too...good god."
"Im a big fan of IPAs, and while this is not the best Ive had, it did not disappoint. Had the fruity aroma (apples, oranges) you would expect, and was highly hopped. A good bitterness in the finish, and an overall good drinking beer. This is one I could see having several of at once. Glad to see the local brewery did well."
"12 oz bottle poured into a hefe glass. Hazey orange color with a white head, about an inch thick. Lacing was moderately sticky. Smell is citrusy and sweet, like oranges. Taste goes back and forth between grapefruit and oranges, but I think the oranges come out on top. The hops is not bitter, and it has only a slight pucker to it. Mouthfeel is pretty light, almost juicey. Typically I don't like an IPA to be too sweet, but I think the flavor was balanced enough to pull it off. Quite enjoyable."
"Very impressed with this one. If you like that West-Coast citrus / pine hops like Dale's Pale ale, you must try this one. It poured a slightly cloudy orange bronze colour with loads of carbonation bubbles streaming upward to maintain its fluffy white head. Nice sticky lacing and great head retention. Smells like grapefruit and pine resin. I must admit, I have to be in the mood for this kind of beer, and it just so happens that right now, I am! The taste is wonderfully bitter and pine like, and while I know that they must be there, I cannot really detect any malt; Just pure pine sap and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is very smooth, but a bit lighter than I was thinking it would be. Drinkability is fantastic! This would be a wonderful session beer. A smash hit from Sweetwater, for sure!!"
"This beer is certainly not what I have come to think of as a traditional IPA. It was gold to amber in color (lighter than expected) and was very effervescent. Overall, quite an attractive appearance. The nose was surprising also. The most prominently projected aromas here are of peach and apricot and a little of noble hops. The taste is a bit light on the malt for my taste, but is still pretty flavorful. The hops domiate the palate, as expected. I could certainly drink a few of these on a hot summer evening. Outstanding beer."
"Sweetwater's IPA is certainly a showcase for hops on all fronts (aroma, flavor, and bitterness), but in superb balance and with high drinkability. This is an effortless beer to drink!"
"I've been drinking this for a while, but the new version has really increased my interest. Big pine and resin and lemon and citrus aroma -really nice. Very little malt taste. A little hazy with an OK, creamy, white head. I'm starting to prefer this to Terrapin. I really like that they added teh Simcoe hops. Nwo if they would only make a DIPA."
"D: Probally the most drinkable IPA I have ever had. Not too often can one say ""This IPA is a great session beer"" but I have been able to put down a sixer of these and could have drank more if need be. Good job on making a light bodied, but full flavored beer."
"Filled my glass with a golden copper color with just a quick showing of a white head that turns into just a thin ring. Light lacing is left. Citrusy orange smell with not much else going on. Hop flavor comes in the form of grapefruit with some orange. Slight bitterness on swallowing. A bit bubbly as well. Just an average IPA in my opinion."
"The flavor follows the smell, and I add that the mouthfeel on this beer is a pleasant surprise. This is a very solid IPA, and if that is your thing, this beer is for you. Not overly hopped, which is perfect for the balance on this beer. Very drinkable, the kind that could turn into a ""session six-pack."""
"A good drinking beer even though it is not like an IPA that I'd normaly grab for."
"This one falls just on the hop-tea side of things, but is fairly strong especially for the $6 price tag."
"D - Good drinkability. Hop driven, but with a seemingly different hop profile than I am used to. This is a decent IPA, but I prefer their 420 APA over this one."
"Citrusy in both the bitter rind qualities and the sweeter orange fruit aromas. Lusterous amber in color with a thumb thick white head that is mostly lasting. Sweet fore tastes a bit of orange/lemon spiked cake, slightly toasty with a firm malty feel. Hops are fairly low in bitterness and an excellent compliment to the fruity malt base. I put of trying this because I tend to dislike IPAs (really hoppy ones anyway) but this is a tasty fine beer."
"The beer is lightly sweet up front, with a solid citrusy orange note. The beer finishes with a light, though strange astringency, and a solid toasted malt note. Candied orange zest was definitely used in this beer, I just know it. The beer has a solid bitterness to it that starts up front and becomes more noticeable as it finally has a strangle hold on the long, lingeringly bitter finish. The hop character creates a bit of a tingling tongue sensation, much like carbonation does, and it is accompanied by an herbaceous hop character that is quite nice as well. This beer is fairly light and drinkable, of course I mean that it has a medium fullness to eat that is not so much that I couldn't see drinking a couple pints of this quaffable IPA."
"By far, my favorite from the Sweetwater Family. I'm biased though, being a Georgia resident. But seriously, this is what all other IPAs want to be when they grow up. This thirst quenching ale from the south does its job tenfold in the IPA department. As far as flavor, undoubtedly the best. Please try this beer. Do yourself the favor."
"Thanks again to timtheenchanta for the bottle."
"Clouded copper with burnt orange highlights. A puffy head of loose small eggshell colored bubbles with vibrant carbonation streams. Dimpled and slowly settling, it leaves splotchy lacing. The smell is of citrusy hops, candied grapefruit. Fresh and bold. Hops, more piney up front and in the finish, some sugar notes struggle to make their presence known. Citrus rind flavors linger in the finish. Medium body, soft and loose feeling. Kind of mushy and watery. Mainly hops without much malt body."
"Fairly drinkable and a very sweet for the style IPA. I don't know that I would buy this again, I would buy a drier beer."
"Notes: very good brew"
"This is an average beer. It poured out with a little head. It is a cloudy yellow color. It has some floaters. It has a hoppy smell and the taste is fairly bitter. It has somewhat off a negative aftertaste which distracts from the drinkability. Still it is not a bad choice if you like IPA's. I could possibly drink a few of these. I may try this again sometime."
"Sweetwater does a good job of mixing in a fruity sweetness into this IPA while still maintaining it's hoppy character."
"Drinkability - If you could take away the astringency this would be highly drinkable. Nonetheless... thanks to 1hoppymonster for the drink."
"12 oz. bottle, best by date of 1st week in December, from JP's liquor in Brunswick, GA. Poured a deep orange into my pint glass with a nice 2 finger head which dissipated rather quickly leaving some nice lacing. Smell is malty sweet at first then the hops come in and take over the sweetness. Taste is initially bubblegum sweet then the hops take over, but not with the authority of a good IPA such as Stone or Hop Ottin. The label claims this is the beer I have been training for, but I'm not feelin it. This may be a step up for a macro beer drinker, but in my opinion it is a decent Pale Ale that is easy drinking but not much more than that."
"[Thanks to mntlover for sending this pleasant surprise from Atlanta]"
"Comments  Thanks to the ever-thoughtful Uncle Flip for putting this in my WTF BIF box."
"It smelled like a handfull of fresh pacific northwest hops and tasted the same. Loaded with bursts of hoppy goodness, and a good malt backbone. Damn fine beer."
"It was the draught version of this that first won my heart, but i think i may actually prefer it from the bottle. I'll evaluate it again another time."
"Poured a very slightly hazed golden orange into my pint glass. The thin head leaves a Swiss cheese like lace on the glass. The aroma is musty, floral and sweet  like a flowery meadow. Some fruitiness and dark nuttiness. Intriguing aroma. The taste is very appealing. Accent on the hoppy with the malt bringing up a close second. Theres a grapefruit rind bitterness in the finish. A fine and flavorful IPA."
"Thanks again to rajendra for the package."
"After the new brewery opened, Sweetwater IPA has taken a turn for the worse. What was once a cloudy, gritty, hoppy, exciting beer, has now turned into a clear bodied, timid little IPA. Not a bad beer, but not as good as it used to be. I wish they would go back to the old formula, or better yet brew a Double IPA for the adventurous types."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for me. No ETOH noted, the hops are interesting but not destructive. A refreshing brew for the end of the summer. Recommended."
"Bottle provided by UncleFlip, thanks for the opportunity! Freshness markings are Month 8 Week 3. Pours an easy two finger very light yellow head over a rather cloudy apricot orange liquid. Smells oranges and tangerines, some grapefruit pith beneath, and just a wisp of pine sol. It's got a real sugary sweet smell, like rock candy. Tastes citrus hoppy with a little bit of a sour hop twang at the end. The draw is grapefruit pith, orange oil and honey in the mouth, and then ""pine sol"" at the end. I think the ""Pine sol"" is actually a combination of a pine hop character mixed with rough grassy co-humulone, topped with some acrid on the tongue from a bit too much carbonation. Not much in the way of fruity esters. Perhaps some mango as the beer warms. Md body and md-heavily carbonation. The flavor grew on me as I drank it and as it warmed."
"This beer knocked my socks off it too me by such surprise. Pours a murky brown in color with a clean and foamy head. Nose is full of hops. Flavor has intial stong tones of malts with some honey, but then come the hops with lots of clover and grass. Picked up a sixer while in Boone and had to ration myself when I find out how far I was going to be from refreshing my empty beer cooler. Mouthfeel is almost enough to call heavy with some chewiness going on, but not so much that it destroyed my interest in having a few more of these beers."
"Pours a slightly hazy peach with a tight one finger head that leaves a ring of lace behind,big lemon essence in the aroma along with spruce anf touch of nutty malt.Really like the flavors going on here citrusy and pine/resin really stand out but there is real nutyy malt presence to keep this beer in my mind a true quaffable,sessionable IPA.True American in its big hoppiness but not over the top,well done."
"Body is medium to big with a chewy and heavy mouthfeel. I could definately session with this and would buy it again if it was sold near me."
"The beer I've been training for? Not exactly, but the hops are definitely a force to be reckoned with. However, in this day and age hoppier American IPA's can easily be found in most states. Still, I really liked this one a lot."
"Medium bodied and firm with a fine leafy/fluffyness of hops and a super refined tone of bitterness under the realm of tropical citrus. Light piney notes float off the back end. Stays creamy on the understatement with the caramel malt and is down right slamable. One stupendously slippery drinkin' IPA! I would stock up on this in my fridge as the 5.9% makes for a extremely steadfast sessionable brew. Infallibly deliciousifibly drinkable!"
"Picked this up in Alabama on the way down to Birmingham for the U.S Men's World Cup qualifier against Gautemala, in 3/05."
"Otherwise, a solid IPA from what I now conclude is a top notch brewery...good thing I have a couple more to try from these folks."
"It presents most as a fortified pale ale or bitter, as it lacks a bit in IPA terms. It's not so much balanced, as sloppy at times. It's still fairly tasty, so it's hard to ding it too hard."
"Drinkability is good, overall a solid IPA. Glad someone wanted this in a trade gave me a chance to try this fine IPA."
"-UF"
"Finger licking good."
"Notes: This one is very well crafted and a remarkable all around ipa. Cheers!"
"Pint at Summits in North Atlanta. I had long looked forward to trying this beer only to find it overly sweet."
"Nice iced-tea color brown, with a nice big head of off-white which leaves considerable lace. Bright floral hops in the nose, slightly piney. Taste is perfectly balanced malt and hops for an IPA. Sure it is hopcentric, but the malt gives it a full biscuit aftertaste. Not off the wall hoppy, but satisfies my hop craving, and has an extremelydrinkable quality to it. Thanks to Southernbrew for another great hoppy beer."
"This beer takes on a nice golden straw color with a slight orange hue. Head was rather small and disappeared quickly. Aroma is quite strong and runs rampant with juicy hops. Aroma is characterized by a blend of grapefruit and a touch of tangerine. Taste is slightly different than the smell and is a nice crisp blend of citrus, pine and resin flavors. Initially the juicy citrus and pine show through but the finish is of resin. Mouthfeel is average in heaviness for an IPA. Flavors linger for a short while, a little too short. Drinkability is awesome for this beer. The intense aroma and nice taste make this beer my usual session beer of choice (it doesnt hurt that I can get it locally and fairly cheap)."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, orange/golden color with a small white head. Very nice nose of floral, spicy hops and a touch of sweet malt and ale yeast. Substantial body holds a palate of slightly sweet malt up front, with notes of honey and fresh ale yeast. Towards the back of the mouth the hops come out with a vengeance. Very assertive and bitter hoppy aftertaste hangs around for quite some time. While not as ""monstrous"" as the bottle advertises, it's a great beer nonetheless. I'm impressed and proud that a Georgia brewer has produced a beer like this."
"Sweetwater IPA is a wonderful example of the style from one of the best craft breweries in the South. I'd be thrilled if I had the opportunity to buy their beer on a regular basis. Thanks to aracauna, a man with ready access and a willingness to share."
"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with medium head and medium retention. Aroma is quite hoppy and I can already feel the bitterness. Taste is extremely bitter, probably one of the most bitter IPA that I had the chance to taste but also I can feel very light sweetness in the background which make this beer very interesting. Body is just above average and carbonation is medium. Probably one of the most interesting IPA, which mixes some extreme characteristics as well as some balance."
"12oz: Hazy golden colour, nice generous white hear, initially huge, but sets down to a foamy cover. Bushy, spine, citrusy smell. Balance is totally great on that aroma, soapy woodiness somehow.. yum yum. Once again though in this IPA tasting, I still am not able to identify so many flavours in this, its certainly nicely floral and presents a firm sandy/bushy bitterness, but the body is certainly a bit too bubbly, lively biting. So this is obviously in the better half of the American IPAs, but once again, it so dries out on your tongue that it leaves you the impression that youre missing a lot."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" of slightly off-white head over the medium amber brew. Head fades, but leaves good lacing. Aroma is slightly fruity, more subdued than I would expect. Taste is picks it up a notch from where the nose was leading. Full of fruity, citrusy hops, but not over the top. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are excellent as well. Excellent representation of the AIPA style."
"Thanks to Rajendra82 for this bottle, my first from Sweetwater. Pours out a very clear bright amber color with moderate carbonation and a slight fizzy white head. Aroma is quite bready and full of sweet malt, just slightly overpowering the citrusy hops. Taste brings out a nice spicy hop bitterness at first, more piney than citrus, then transitions into a huge chewy center. Lots of sweet and caramel malt flavor through the middle, maybe even a bit creamy. Body is a little more than medium, I could definitely drink a couple of these but more than that might get a bit sweet. Finish leaves a lingering bitterness more appropriate to the IPA style. Not a hopmonster but nice to try something a little different."
"On the plus bitter side, with citrus from Chinook hops? Citrus aroma. Smooth. Well gulped on the night of a humid day. Malts present though not that balanced. Delicate taste, medium mouthfeel. Thanks Mr_kimchee.Had on tap at the brewpub 3 1/3 years later and better than average IPA. Good bubbly head onto grapefruit."
"This pours out a fairly hazy amber orange color with three fingers of fast rising rocky off white head. Beautiful chunks of foamy lace are left cling to the glass that seem to cling on for dear lift as they stay in place throughout the beers life. Glorious citrus hops jump through your nose when first sampling the aroma. Quickly the hop scent dies down to let the sweet caramel malt profile take center stage. Hmmmm the first thing that comes to mind when I took a sip was balance that seems to be the game here. The sweet caramel malt play at the front of my tongue while the bitter hops take residence in the back balancing each other out one for one it seems. I would expect more hop presence in an IPA than this; it seems at times malt is in the starring role. Mouthfeel is great medium body with creaminess written all over it. Drinkability is good too as this went down very quickly and I would have had a few more if I had them. Overall the only knock on this baby is the taste and smell, which needed a bit more hops for what I want in an IPA. Besides that the brew still tastes great and is something you should give a shot if you come across it. Many thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle."
"The taste was slightly sweet and lemony. Sort of reminded me of a lemon drop. Very drinkable but not quite what I am looking for in an IPA. Needs more hops."
"Pours to a cloudy, chunky hazy orange with thin white head. Aroma is dominated by Pacific NW hops. Flavor is predominately hoppy, accentuating the citruslike character of what I think are Cascade hops. Malt backbone is strong and balances the hops. Finishes bitter and dryish. This is a bold IPA with strong hop flavor and aroma and a puckering bitterness. It's not the bitterest IPA I've ever had, but it is a complex yet highly drinkable American IPA."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a cloudy orangish-golden color. Some floaties in there also. Mine didnt have much of a white head to it. Nice hop nose, mainly of graperfuit, but some spiciness and maltiness come through also. The taste is a good balance of hops and malts. Just a bit bitter. A decent IPA."
"Pours a hazy orangish amber with a massive creamy head & an absolute crapload of floating debris. Nice floral hoppy aroma that also features loads of grapefruit some toasted caramel malt and hints of sweet fruit (apricot, peach). Muted base of pale malt lends some sweetness, but is outdone completely by the hopping. Moderately bitter with flavors of citrus & pine - great use of hops here, this is delicious stuff. Finishes slightly acidic with more fruity notes. Amazing creaminess to this IPA only adds to its delightfulness & makes it more drinkable & unique. Top notch."
"It's the second best beer currently brewed and sold in Georgia (Terrapin Rye P.A. being the best, IMHO). We'll see if that changes after July 1."
"Thanks to Rajenda82, and BiF7 for this one!"
"Taste is also sweet and citrusy. The orange flavors shine through here. Strident bitterness in the finish, a hoppy bite that sneaks up on you. Lingering bitterness and citrus in the finish and crisp. Drinkablility? I keep quite a selection in my fridge and I always seem to drink my Sweetwater selections first. This brew is no exception. Could this be my new standby IPA?"
"Much thanks to rajendra82 for dropping this one on me."
"Special thanks to rajendra82 for the trade that brought this to my door!"
"Solid copper color, decent head. Obvious strong hop smell, very enticing, definite citrus notes. Medium bodied, with good carbonation. Lots of citrus hop flavor up front that becomes slightly bitter. It finishes up with a pleasant dry bitterness. This is my favorite IPA to date, and something I try to always have in my fridge."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a white head that settles into a very sticky lace that loves to cling to the sides of the glass. Wonderful IPA aroma of pine oil with some underlying fruity notes. Medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation that does a nice job of offsetting the sticky texture of the beer. Taste begins with some sweet and biscuity malt flavors that soon give way to tart acidic citrus rind and bitter hop resins that remain in a lasting aftertaste. A fine IPA to be had hereI just wish that it was available locally. Thanks to aracauna for the sample!"
"Overall, a very pleasing beer of the style. Not the life-changing experience I anticipated, but a more subtle pleasure. Glad to have this available as a hometown brew. The local Kroger has it everyday for $7 a sixer."
"Slick with a little bubbly carbonation, this is a very good IPA - a southern classic? Thanks to aracauna for the bottle."
"I take one sip, and... wow. There are lots of tastes flying by in rapid succession. First comes a slightly creamy wave that quickly becomes citrusy. Then there's the most abrupt snap of hop bitterness I've ever experienced; it actually feels like it's in my cheeks! The dry finish carries several surges of wonderfully crisp, sharp bitterness on the back of my tongue. Thanks to rajendra82 for the trade; I look forward to more!"
"Drinkability: A wonderfully drinkable IPA. I WILL be having more...well, 3 more, anyway..."
"Notes: This beer may have been a bit old when purchased. The hop flavor wasn't as good as remembered from a previous tasting. I will try to repeat this tasting when I can get my hands on this beer again."
"Poured a deep golden bronze with a thick frothy head. The smell is citrusy and piney, balanced nicely with sweet malts. The taste is very well balanced between hops and malt and finishes very strongly with hops bitterness, leaving no doubt that this is an IPA. The hops are aggressive, but not over-powering - I just can't get over the fantastic malt balance in this brew. The mouthfeel is dry without being harsh, and very well-rounded. Another fantastic brew from Sweetwater."
"I wish I could get this by me...I'd drink plenty of them...Thanks Aracauna"
"Cloudy, tawny-bronze hue frothy, off-white head with an apex a shade under a finger, good retention (residue remain throughout consumption). Strands of lace were produced. Lovely nose with ample potency and plenty of hops complexities grapefruit, citrus rinds, sharp acidicness, and very distant malt. Exceedingly inviting! The first sip is ass-kicking hops dry and leafy yet acidic and citrusy the bitterness is assertive (and tasty)! The malt backbone is solid; the complexities added to the flavor profile are subtle but important yeast influences are noticeable towards the end, it has a softening effect, which is overpowered by the dry, bitter, grapefruit rinds. Very tasty! It is balanced enough definitely leans heavily on the hoppy side. The body is very solid, perfect carbonation great mouthfeel, almost dead-on for what I want in an IPA. Great aftertaste that does not allow your brain to forget how damn tasty it was. Yummy its on par with many of the absolute great IPAs. Recommended."
"A slightly hazy (unfiltered), very deep amber-orange body reveals wide golden highlights when held to the light; and it's creamy off-white head slowly drops to a good-sized collar and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The aroma is bold with brightly floral, sweetly citrusy, and softly piney hops over a sweetish malt. Very nice!!! The same hoppiness appears in the flavor (it's loaded with grapefruit!), tempered a bit by the fuller sweetness of the gently biscuity and softly caramelized malt; and accentuated by a delicate, fruity contribution from the yeast. It's bitterness is firm, but never steps ahead of the rich maltiness; and only makes it's full strength known in the dry finish and long-lingering aftertaste. It's rich, and the medium-full body and very fine, moderate carbonation serves to accentuate that. I'd almost like to try this beer a little bit crisper (with the thought that that would add to it's drinkability), but I like it so much as it is that I feel that might be a fool's errand. Quite nice! Brewed with a firm but delicate hand. Well worth trying!"
"Beautiful looking amber/orange and cloudy with significant sediment. Thick head which is settling down rapidly. Looks similar to Bells Two Hearted. Fat piney hop aroma. Crisp with a medium body and a bitter slightly dry finish. Not an outstanding brew but definately worth a try. I accidentily poured thesediment in my glass and I'll re-rate on next one without sediment."
"Originally sampled on 5 November 2002. Thanks to aracauna for this beauty. Poured a cloudy orange color w/ a foamy white head. A nice citrus/hoppy nose w/ a nice bite. Definitely a must-try for the IPA afficionado. This, in my opinion, is a very nice IPA."
"Thanks to aracauna."
"Light amber hue, animated by fervent carbonation. Thick, rutted off white head leaves rough lace. The aroma is dominated by pungently dry hopped, juicy grapefruit and spruce laced Cascades. As the hop oils dissipate, softer, light caramel malt surfaces and partially offsets, lending a sweeter, orangey citrus character. Quinessential, hop driven American IPA hop nose. The flavor is a more placid, balanced extension of the aroma. Mild, dextrin malt sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by citrus hop notes with hints of peach. Moderate hop bitterness emerges mid palate and complements the underlying, token residual and caramel malt derived sweetness. Somewhat understated, but functional malt character. Hint of buttery malt late merges with the citrus hop presence leaving a lightly sweetened orange Julius impression late. Medium bodied, with the well calculated attenuation facilitating an agreeably smooth, dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bitter and mildly bready. A well balanced, flavorful IPA, that falls a bit short on the aroma's promise. Nonethless highly drinkable and satiatingly hopped. Very tasty."
"This IPA poured a very VERY cloudy yellow but did have a fine white head that lasted long and provided a lot of lace on the glass. The aroma was hoppy but not overly so. The taste of citrus was quite present but did not dominate the taste as many IPA do. The hops were well blended with the malts so that they were in the forefront but were balanced more than most IPAs. The mouthfeel was very light and had no exceptional qualities. This is a very drinkable IPA and I look foward to tasting the remaining two bottles that are in my refrigerator."
"Overall a nice IPA with good balance and flavor for a warm climate. I personally would have liked a bit more malt flavor balanced with some more hop bite. But I am a hop head."

"Got this solid IPA via trade. I think it is every bit as good as Fuller's and Stone's version, but not on the scale of Buckeye '76 or Ruination. Light and hazy amber color with a medium bone white head. Resonant hops aroma with some citrus. Flavor is nicely sharp and crisp, consisting of floral hops, pine and citrus. Finish is rather dry with a nice bite. Not as intense as the great IPAs out there but it is good enough."
"The draught version of this beer is bland and only mildy hoppy. The bottled version is one of my favorite beers. Since I can't see a logical reason to brew them on two different recipes I don't know what causes the difference in taste. The only difference I know of for sure is that the stuff out of the tap is clear while the bottle has plenty of yeast, but I am clueless as how the lack of yeast removes the juicy hop flavor and stips a bit of the malt as well. What is a juicy, well-balanced IPA in the bottle becomes a bland middling beer on tap."
"Enjoy by: 3rd Week, Dec ('02) Tasted: 12/27/02"
"This is one of the better IPAs available anywhere on the face of Gods green earth. Slightly cloudy orange, with a generous head and oodles of fine lace, also lots of goodies coating the bottom of the bottle. The nose simply reeks of hops, citrus like in its crispness with a malt sweet backing, and yes even a tad bit of yeast, a damn nice sniff, with the start sweet and pleasantly malted, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasingly acidic, the hop bite Herculean in its spiciness, the aftertaste droughty."
"Cheers to Jacob for the trade !"
"Nice bitterness in the flavor, not a huge hop flavor, more just bitter, but nice. Malt vanishes very fast and dosnt linger to balance the hop finish, but is nice and clean without any detracting suagry cloying ness. A very refreshing IPA in the british character, but with american hops. Works very well. Would like some more malt complexity and presence, but the way it is makes it very drinkable"
". Grapefruit hoppy nose Firm mouthfeel with a sweetish malty start and stong bitter grapefruit finish. Very enjoyable. My favorite regional."
"Great beer if you are a hophead you gotta try this one, my wife is going to have to bring back a case for me from Atlanta. Great cloudy golden color, unfiltered scares alot of people lol.  Heavy on the hops and a excelelnt hoppy aroma.  This is a great compliment to spicy food such as the cajun jambalaya I had when partaking..................CHEERS"
"I loved the aroma of this beer.  Nice fresh waft of apricots.  I was expecting an onslaught of hops on the first sip, but it was a pretty mellow, balanced flavor with a lingering  bitterness late in the swallow.  Overall, a nice beer I wouldn't mind having in my area.  Thanks to aracauna, I was able to sample it."
"Very balanced, almost too balanced for the style. Good amount of dextrin sweetness with a softer yet bold hop bitterness. This one reminds me of some west coast pale ales, light in color with a big dose of pale malt and low - medium alpha hops. Clean finish with dextrins and floral hop."
