Lots of pine and grapefruit and it lingers the perfect amount. Overall this is a great IPA, and at 7.5% it's pretty high for a non-imperial IPA, and the alcohol is masked very well. I'm glad Ohio has more great beers than I can count, including this one.","Tylertut","Nov 05, 2014"

Great nose - grapefruit, tropical fruit and hints of Simcoe and citrus rind towards the back.  Taste expresses less fruitiness and more Simcoe and rind in the forefront with grapefruit (not as sweet) towards the back.  Finishes with a light and pleasant herbal bittering between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant carbonation that falls just shy of crisp and biting.  There's a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and also a little maltiness to the body.  Overall, a solid IPA.  If I had regular access to this, it would be part of my standard line-up.","Jwale73","Oct 28, 2014"

3.94,-9.2,3.75,4,4,4,3.75,"Overall, this was a beer enjoyed after a day of riding ten of the world’s best roller coasters at Cedar Point.  We were most certainly thrashed from it, and ready for some swill and delicious grub.  We found this little establishment on the interweb and loved it.  The food was great and so was the beer, but we’ll leave a full review for it in the proper place.  This beer was recommended to us by the knowledgeable bartender, although it has been on our “Ohio list” for a little while now.  What we found was a nice local offering, but really were hard pressed to find much more.  The flavoring was there, showcasing a deeper malt profile, but we were a bit let down in the department of feel.  It was just a little light for the depth they’re going for.  This, unfortunately, slows down the drinker, tricking them into thinking the flavors are lighter than they actually are.  This is not the case in the nose, as we felt this to be its strongest aspect.  This is a great Ohio beer, and one we would certainly seek out again, but we can’t help but feel that we prefer something more substantial to quench this thirst.","TheBrewo","Sep 29, 2014"

Soft, sweet, sugary malt. Flavor just smacks you with upfront citrus. Grapefruit uprising. Piney and grassy and hempy. Tropical fruitiness (mango, specifically) is detectable but starts to burn off by the aggressive bitterness. A submissive maltiness is a bit toasty. Percussive bitterness. Moderate carbonation. Resinous. It always feels good to finally nab a beer you've been eyeing and it also isn't a letdown. This beer is mightily hoppy. Bottled offering.","VelvetExtract","Sep 04, 2014"

It took me awhile to find it fresh, but drinking a few of these less than 2 weeks old really made the wait worthwhile. A must try! And one ill enjoy again.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 28, 2014"

4.06,-6.5,4,4.25,4,4,4,"A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's.","John_M","Jun 05, 2014"

But my wife recently visited Ohio and stopped by a beer store to kindly pick me up a bottle. The beer poured a clear golden color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent was fresh hops bordering on bitterness and pine. The taste was crisp and bordered more on bitter with touches of sweet malt and pine like hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer and would recommend it to any one who like the Z'Dust.","WoodBrew","May 13, 2014"

Aroma is bold citrus (grapefruit and lemon) with some resiny pine and a bit of pineapple. Medium body and high carbonation with a good hop bite. Taste is complex. Grapefruit, pineapple, pine and floral hops all intermingle and compete for attention. The aftertaste is piney, grapefruit in the front. I had this with two weeks from bottling and the flavors were much more pronounced and played better. This was written from a 3.5 week old bottle.","mverity","Apr 13, 2014"

The spicy, citrus, and pine nose really started thing off great and the beer tastes almost as good as it smells. A bit of bitterness, but the sting leaves the tongue after a few sips... I taste hints of heavy citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, roasted carmel, and even a little bit of spiciness which is my favorite thing about this brew. This is one of my favorite IPAs I've tried as of recently, I would for sure recommend it to any IPA lover!","exposd","Apr 07, 2014"

4.49,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was one of my goal beers on my Ohio buying trip and I was not disappointed. This ale pours a very cloudy copper color with a ton of sediment (god I love unfiltered beers). The head is off white and short lasting but the lacing is quite substantial. The nose is a delicious blend of bitter hops; both citrus and pine. This offering smells very fresh and lively. The taste totally follows suit; all hops. It is a sparkling delicious and fresh ipa. Not complex but awesomely is what it is. Think hopslam but smoother and a little less in your face. This is a great beer and will pick up every time I'm in Ohio.","lochef81","Feb 19, 2014"

Let me first say there is no other IIPA that can hold a candle to this beer'S aroma- pungent pine, spruce, freshly cut grass. I would buy for the aroma itself. Great bitterness and mouthfeel and the flavor lingers of summer evergreen nights and bitter grapefruit mornings. Great balance and finish. Have had it on tap and most recently in bottle. This review orompted by cellar temp drinking. So so good and satisfying. A hidden gem, kinda like the iron city. Find it in pittsburgh and not much farther but so worth the physical and beer drinking trip. Cheers","sublimesipping","Oct 21, 2013"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an awesome citrus hop presence that makes this one super easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 18, 2013"

Hop aroma was a little cat pissy for my taste, but this is a west coast style ipa after all. Grapefruit notes are pleasant but the aftertaste grabs the back of the tongue and is a bit harsh to my taste. As the beer warmed, i picked up hints of pineapple in both smell and taste. The beer drinks easily enough though, and I found myself at the bottom of the glass fairly quickly. I would recommend this beer to a friend.","Zackcavalier","Sep 01, 2013"

Huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aromas, ripe orange and pineapple, with faint pine hop notes in the distance. Hop aromas are delicate enough to allow sweet caramel to show through beneath the hoppiness. Medium bodied with a slight oily feel and aggressive, but not fizzy carbonation. Pungent citrus hop flavors down the middle with pine hops on the edges. Nice sweet caramel malt backbone keeps the bitterness in check. Citrus flavors taper through the middle as the pine hops take over to the end. Finishes with a strong, lingering pine hop bitterness.

My favorite part other than the fruitiness is the undeniable wetness that this holds - in fact, its lack of dryness makes it scarily quaffable. This beer has been romanticized to death, recently, and I can see why. It reminds me of many different IPAs across the country, but holds on its own as pretty unique.

Taste is fantastic. Similar to aroma an initial bitter rush of pine finished with a grapefruit kick that stays with you. A nice dry finish makes it an easy drinker that hides the abv well.

However, the flavors in this one are so good, I almost put the whole bottle down before I had time to type up the review. It has just a touch of malt to it, but the piney notes assure you that the hops are in control. The overall mix of bitter flavors are excellent, and while they are aggressive, they're not too, well, "too." It lingers in your mouth long after the liquid is gone, but not in a way that makes you need to clean it out. It's a great beer that I wish I had unlimited access to in my area.","yankeepride","May 29, 2013"

My head gets to the top of my glass and trickles over at around 3 fingers. Head is a soft doughy beige in tone. Tones of lace is left behind with nice retention. Body is a bold copper amber in tone. The whole look itself is very enticing. Nose is of fresh cut grass and grapefruit rind. There is a hint of lemon zest and pepper also. All in all the nose is a bit soft. With first sip you get a creamy bitter dance on the tongue. The rind tones really build up the bite as you drink. Piny and rustic with layers of deep dry hops. Really develops well as you enjoy this on. It did start a bit on the soft side but finishes wonderfully. Mouthfeel is one that really hangs on and is monstrously bitter(in a good way).","SPLITGRIN","May 28, 2013"

The flavor sweet enough to remind you that this is beer with hints of brown bread and light sugar and a boatload of dank hoppy goodness.

The taste reflected the aroma, with a nice blast of fresh hops, oily citrus, resinous pine, light biscuity pale malts somewhere off in the distance, bringing in a sense of balance, but ensuring that the hop profile is still the dominant factor. Perhaps nothing you wouldn't expect, but nevertheless, this is pretty much exemplary of the style. Medium body, crisp mouthfeel, super drinkable.","Rifugium","Mar 23, 2013"

Smells like an ipa should. Lots of resinous pine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, maybe some papaya. Tiny bit of a bready malt presence. Pretty dry. Taste starts with the resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange. Then there is a decent malt presence that brings some carmel and breadiness to balance it a little. Very resinous, dry finish with more pine, grapefruit, some pineapple, papaya, along with some sweetness to cut the hops. Almost like a bubblegum flavor. The hops get more abrasive as it goes down. Pretty hefty body for a single ipa. Creamy and surprisingly clean mouthfeel for such a hoppy beer due to the lively carbonation. Extremely well done ipa that lives up to the hype in my opinion..","brewskis","Mar 09, 2013"

4.41,1.6,4,4.25,4.75,4,4.25,"The beer was poured into a snifter and was a light copper color with a fluffy white head. Retention and lacing at the top of the class was appropriate. A huge aroma left an immediate impression with notes of grass and fruit. In terms of the initial taste, this might be the best single IPA I have ever heard. On the forefront, one detects pineapple, apple, orange, and a little grass. I can not get over hop big the grapefruit is in the initial taste. Though the taste does not seem as intense on later tastes, it is still wonderful. The mouthfeel proves to be quite bubbly which brushes away the taste all too soon. In the aftertaste, one detects orange rind and grass with a mild warming sensation. This is a really good example of the style.","JohnnyHopps","Beers"

Taste is bitter hops up front with great cutrus flavors, great west coast style hops, piney, subtle malts, nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is right on. Overall this is a great IPA that hits you hard with bitter hops. The malty flavor takes a backseat to the piney, floral hops that dominate the flavor of this one.

The aroma is loaded with grapefruit and spicy hops, with some grass, herbs, and pine resin in there as well. It tastes of spicy, earthen hops, with lots of pine and grass/herb notes. Loads of citrus come through as well - predominantly grapefruit, but some orange as well. Mouthfeel is bitter, slightly acidic, and dry on the finish. A piney resin seems to linger, accentuating the raw hop character. Overall, this is an awesome “west coast” IPA that really showcases a number of aspects of the hops: citrusy, earthen, and of course, bitter. Well done.","eclipse54","Dec 03, 2012"

Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, and subtle apple juice. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, fruit, fruit hop, tropical fruit, bitter hop, and subtle pine resin. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really liked what is going on in this one. There was tons of pine notes going on, but it had a nice touch of fruit to help balance it out and leave your palate feeling refreshed for a moment. After that moment the hops come flooding in to carry what is left of your palate away.

The mildly high ABV hides beautifully behind zesty grapefruit, spicy hops, fresh cut grass, and biscuity maltiness. A very well-balanced and well-done IPA bottling that I crave and will seek out.

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of caramel malt. I think the taste follows the aroma, it tastes mostly like pine and citrusy hops, with a teeny bit of caramel malt noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and oily with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's nice to see this brew in bottles, I've heard about it for a while now but finally was able to try it today and it didn't disappoint! It's certainly one of the best Ohio IPA's (and IPA's in general) along with White Rajah and Columbus IPA. Definitely worth trying if you have a chance to get it!","bluejacket74","Jul 06, 2012"

Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing. orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. A very Hop forward punch with a grapefruit that keeps you coming back for more. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing.

Rather easy drinking, would no be opposed to having this available to me as an everyday option. Good IPA that falls just short of the next level.","kzoobrew","Feb 25, 2011"
3.18,-26.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Yellow, golden pour with a bright white head that clings to the glass. Minor grapefruit smell with malt in the background. I'm also getting an old sock type smell. Hmmm. Unusual bitter taste which doesn't improve much at all. Metallic tasting. Not too pleasant. Very thin mouthfeel. This wasn't the greatest beer but it was unusual for an IPA. If you're looking for a different experience in an IPA...this is your huckleberry.","kaseydad","Feb 25, 2011"

4.1,-5.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice gold to light copper color with a nice white head and a good amount of lacing. Nice retention as well. The nose brought forward a large amount of hops ranging from citrus to floral to tropical. Altogether a really nice package from a mixed back of hops. I can't recall them at the moment, but there was a sign on the wall that seemed to indicate the hops used in this one. The flavor hit the spot as well with a nice hop character coming through as the dominant character and a good, brisk finish. A bit of alcohol in the finish, though not too much. Terribly drinkable. I wish this were available locally and weren't quite as high in ABV.","Thorpe429","Feb 15, 2011"

4.65,7.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Pours on the lighter side of the spectrum for IPAs, bright and golden orange, healthy sticky head and lacing galore. Sharp piney aromas and loads of tropical fruit, citrus, uber fresh. I was expecting decent or even tasty at best, but I was really blown away by this beer. Super bitter, nearly astringent (in a good way), light malt profile allowing the citrus hops to shine. Really amazing pineapple-y minty sappy resinous danky hops. So bitter. My special lady friend was drinking other top tier IPAs such as Sculpin and Green Flash, and swapping sips I think this was a notch ahead, which is saying a lot. Nice smooth mouthfeel, not overly heavy, thick, syrupy, or sweet like some IPAs pushing the imperial tend to be. Crisp, fresh, quenching and highly quaffable. Definitely in the top tier of IPAs in my book. Wish it was more widely available but now I have another excuse to go visit the folks in Pittsburgh.","twelvsies","Dec 05, 2010"
4.27,-1.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,"At the Pittsburgh location (even though I live in Cleveland). This is a really great IPA, on par with Two Hearted and a few others in that class. Super fresh and refreshing. Really clean hoppy flavors with some nice underlying malt. The real all-stars in this beer are the citrus and piney hops. Great aroma, great flavor. Very easy-drinking, a bit lighter in body, but that ups the drinkability for sure. I wouldn't say a "must-have" in terms of "you must drive 500 miles to get this beer," but if you head to Fat Head's, you better order one.","LordAdmNelson","Nov 19, 2010"

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A real piney, citric hop nose that even hits grape-like aroma on top of a golden body w/ large head that dies quick and leaves lace ring. Very dry - first thing that hits me - as the citric hops are prevelant throughout entire drink yet it flows smooth, not haggard, and has a nice touch of sweetness to it as well. A well-balanced, solid IPA that a hop lover will love and so will fans of less hoppy, more malty beers as well...must say did not realize 7% until I saw this website b/c they hid it well.","clayrock81","Oct 01, 2010"

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Draft at The Bistro IPA festival. Golden amber, bright and clear, with a solid white cap that slowly settles to a collar. Very floral aroma, centennial hops are prominent but there's also a citrusy, herbal character, a little weed and cut grass. Little perceptible malt in the aroma, but it has a touch of bready sweetness on the palate beneath the huge hop flavors. Floral with orange and grapefruit, bitter herbs, a little toasted biscuit. Nice bitter grapefruit finish that lingers for a long time. Pretty damn good.","largadeer","Jun 29, 2010"
