"I really enjoyd this beer i loved how bitter it was very powering smell didnt like how my six pack had an empty beer with it but mistakes happen"
"Wouldn't turn down another...not quite as delicate but putting that aside, does this remind anyone else of Two Hearted?"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/16/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"First thought, oak/lambic funk with bitter finish.  Surprisingly complex.  Loved it.  Different from  my usual TG IPA's i drink."

"Due to the high rating, I have tried this beer multiple times, to rule out bad batches, shipping malfunction etc. Nope:  Every time it smells & tastes badly skunked."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Forgot to check date. Pours a mostly clear orange with a nice head and lacing in the glass. Aroma and flavor both feature moderate orange-rind character. It's a solid effort, but it leaves me wanting a little more hop aroma and flavor."

"Really great beer. Would definitely drink this one again."

"Five four three two one"

"Pours a cloudy golden haze. Half a finger head that sticks around practically downto the last sip. Good bite, bitter but, has a decent citrus tone to balance it out. Good bready finish. Personally I seek more citrus tones in an IPA but, overall a solid brew. Wouldn't buy one at the bar but would get some to take home."

"Fantastic beer. Pours golden with orange hue, a bit cloudy. Well balanced bready, yet citrusy and floral mix with rich, malty finish present you with one hell of a drinkable goodness. Obviously not everyone will like it so much, but this ONE is on top of my list. Cheers!"
"From can. Not sure if I would consider this an ipa. Tastes like a hoppy lager. Hoppier than the rebel ipa but just as crappier"
""
""
"Great rocky mountain head, no pun intended. The head is marvelous, really nice foam. As you clear the glass  the lacing looks like a snow storm. Very sticky. Unable see through the glass, outstanding! Nice orange hue. Sweet esters to the nose, and a very assertive malt backbone. Very smooth IPA. Very enjoyable to drink. Will be purchasing again!"

"Wow really good stuff! Poured with a thick very long-lasting off-white head, lots of lace and a clear amber color. aroma is fresh hops and malt. Flavor is a wonderful blend of sweet bitter and Tang with resin hop dominating. Body is perfect. Drink drink drink!!!"
""
""
"Overall - Eh, wish I knew Avery's bottling code before I bought this. Turns out this one's nearly a year old, and certainly a reason why the hops are so dead and the malts so strong. What's there shows promise. Certainly a candidate for a Re-review, and with a much fresher example."

"overall- very satisfying and tasty IPA, it won't be a constant repurchase but i definitely see myself buying again."
""
""
""
"O-Overall, it's an enjoyable beer. It doesn't live up to some of the others I've had from Avery. I love this brewery and have visited the taproom in Boulder. I'd much prefer Maharaja, which I know isn't quite in the same class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it's a very drinkable IPA, even when a couple of months old. It's clearly well-crafted, and I look forward to having it super-fresh sometime. Until then, this grey-market import will do me nicely."

"An extra nice IPA. Big head first which dissipates quickly. It is a very carbonated head. There are some citrus overtones but the predominance is great hop bitterness. The end is a little grassy?, piney? and compliments the overall beer. overall a very nice ipa for hop lovers, good Job, Avery !!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Like I said this may have been old so I feel bad judging it harshly considering that it has good rating. Even then it wasn't a bad beer by any means, but it feel just short of good. I'll be trying to see if I can find this fresh so I can know for sure. Hopefully Im right and it proves me wrong.  (77/100)"

"Pours a clear golden with little head and no lacing. Almost no detectable aroma. A Budweiser initial taste followed by a very bitter aftertaste. Poorly balanced and thin. Avery can make a delicious IPA (See Avery 20th Aniversary IPA). In fairness, this IPA seems to be widely variable from one 6-pack to another. It is not a big seller and I suspect that it is sometimes quite old. Not the best IPA."
"Tast/palate: It’s flavor first hits you with big juicy hops right up front. The malt offers some sweetness for balance before a big citrus rind/pith like bitterness slowly sneaks in on the sides and lingers on palate. The palate feels fairly full and there is just enough carbonation to give it some lift."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a big fan at all. Not much smell, taste, or feel. I have week taste buds and need flavorful beer to wake them up. I would say its a great starter IPA for anyone looking to get into IPAs. I do want to say it's not a bad beer but as I mentioned would prefer a hoppier, bitter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reviewed a year later from can, really nice appearance, clear with nice retention. aromas of pine and grapefruit, fresh meadow florals. Taste is smooth, bready malts with a citrusy pungency, coating resiny hop notes but also a brightness to it. Good balance, and a firm mouthfeel with an assertive carbonation. Big chewy mouthfeel.  Lots of bright C-hops in this with some earthiness as well and I think this makes quite a pleasant IPA with some forward flavour and a nice balance, a touch resiny perhaps but I enjoyed it. Bumped rating a little higher."
""
"Not like me to poo-poo a beer that is well rated but I just don't dig if all that much. If feels thick and syrupy in my mouth and that feeling persists minutes afterward. It looks good with a nice head. Smell good but it just doesn't feel exactly right. So I disagree on this one with the Bros and my fellow beer snobs."
""
""
"Overall- Refreshing and goes down easy. Not as bitter as many other IPA's as this one is more malt flavored."

"For the most part, this IPA is very well balanced. It's not overly bitter and has a subtle sweetness. I only gave this beer a try because I needed something in a can and when I read ""Hop Heads Unite"" on the can label, it went into my shopping car. I consider myself a ""hop head"" but was actually hoping for the beer to be a bit more bitter, so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't."

"O - There's definitely craft in its concocting. Moderately balanced but off putting in its odor. I like it. Its like a guy who hangs around a lot that you can't quite get a good read on. He seems nice but you've heard he's a little shifty. Either way, you still think he's got your back."

"O: Very drinkable and enjoyable IPA. As suggested in the can: ""Hoppy Freaks Unite!"""

"O: A nice drinking IPA with a solid malt character. I think the bottle I had might have had some age on it, so I'd like a fresher example, but.. middle of the road as far as IPAs go."
""
""
""
"There's nothing not to like about it. This beer will alleviate a hops craving just as well as any other IPA of high renown."

"I drink a lot of ipas, and this is somehow different, but hard to put my finger on how. Not the greatest brew ever, but good for sure."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine one finger ivory head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of light caramel malt, citrus hops, light orange family citrus. Flavor is rich caramel and bready malt, resiny pine and citrus hops, nice lingering pine and mildly citrus hop bitterness. Medium body with a a light creaminess. A quite nicely balanced and smooth IPA. Nice hop bill with more pine influence but good citrus too. Great tasting malt support body. This may be an older bottle, not confident about the store I bought it from; kudos for the healthy hop flavor is has been sitting for a while. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"It appears this brew has been around for quite a while, but this is the first I have found it in my market. Having lived in Ft. Collins many years ago, I was really excited to try this Avery. However, I am quite underwhelmed. The aroma is bready, slightly floral, with a bit of orange and pine. For an IPA it is more sweet than I had expected. The finish is very sharp, more so than I am used to, but not in a good way. I doubt I will be purchasing this one again. I give it a rank of around 40 in my top 50 IPAs (i.e. #3 IPA shelf)."
""
""

"Otherwise good solid drinking, if unremarkable. Age is of course the unknown and concern."

"Pours a golden caramel with a nice white head. Aroma is quite bready, floral, even a little herbal and earthy. A touch of candy orange comes out the deeper I search for it. Flavor follows suit. Crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, wanted to like it more than I did. Not bad, like I used to think, but not really my favorite. Living in a market where I can always grab an Odell IPA, I can't see myself drinking this that often."
""
""
"While it's not wildly complex, this brew is well-assembled and far from uninteresting. It's not only very drinkable on its own, but loves food--light, spicy, bready, and cheesy. I'd buy this one to sit alongside fun cooking ventures at home, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More malt than expected, which is favorable to me. Not the most complex hop character, but it hits a few notes. Bitterness is relatively tame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Nice IPA that is somewhat normal today. If this was the IPA on tap I would certainly order it. No need to revisit in bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's not the most unique IPA, but it's a very pleasant experience overall. This is my first beer from Avery Brewing. I will likely pick this up again, and am also curious about their other offerings. It's not a beer to go hunt down, but if you come across it, it's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot heavier on the pine then the citrus and tropical hops. It is extremely well put together, and well I can pretty much assure you that you have tasted this one before regardless of you have had it or not. But never the less a decent beer that I will enjoy from time to time! Hope the cans hit this area, I could see my self picking this up more in cans for the beach or something."
"O-very solid American IPA, nothing out of the box but nice representation of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty solid india pale ale. It's Quite bitter with piney, and citrusy tastes which jump off your tongue as soon as it hits your taste buds. Its definitely up there on the IBU scale and I'm no expert in beer tastes, but I recommend it if you enjoy piney IPA's."

"Good and solid IPA. I liked the profile of this brew, pleasant citrus acidity with a bold bitterness, and still with high drinkability and well balanced. Though, it did not take any “wow” from me, well it is a balance brew."

"335ml Can. Shaker glass. Bright golden color headed by white, close & lasting crown. Floral notes, slight salty nuts to the nose & underneath smoke. Light malty upfront followed by gentle bitterness. Light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily texture & funny palate. Citric astringency lingers into a long bitter finish. Fruity aftertaste."

"Before I left Texas and moved to the Pacific Northwest I judged all beers by my previous standard Sierra Nevada IPA, Well This Avery IPA is my new Standard, it's better than a Sierra and I could easily buy a 6 pack and enjoy it all, can't say that about Sierra anymore. A beer has to be at least this good for me to pay a second visit."

"Hate those pansy cirusy IPAs? Want all the flavors of pine, without chewing on pine needles? YOU HAVE ARRIVED! Pine flavors through and through, with a pleasing resin bitterness that sits on the tongue for just long enough. I love how this beer looks. Hazy, light-orange with head that will leap out and attack you. Literally. I cracked this one open and the head crawled out of the bottle. So much lacing that you'd swear your glass was still full. Overall, this beer doesn't blow me away, but it is still one of my favorite IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is surprisingly malty, some caramel. Taste is well balanced. Hoppy and bitter up front, a strong malt backbone, a bit of caramel. The flavors coming in layers. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
"Poured out a beautiful clear light amber with a creamy white head. The head has moderate retention and leaves big lacing. The aroma is lighter, with notes of caramel malt and floral hops. The flavor was very earthy, almost musty. It was kind of off-putting and I wonder if it was the bottle or the beer. I had it on draft before and thought it was quite good."
""
""
"A pretty good drinking IPA that borders on the west coast style but brings its own tastes with it."
"O: I really have nothing to complain about. It's a decent IPA without flaws. The problem is that there's nothing here that wows me - basically, it's a bog standard IPA. I wouldn't seek it out given all the choices here, but I'd easily drink it again if offered to me."

"A rather decent tasting IPA that loses some of its attractiveness with a funky, off-beat background aroma."
""
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable even with a powerful bitterness in the finish."

"o: An easy drinking yet pleasantly sippable moderate strength IPA. Definitely worth a premium by the sixpack. REALLY looking forward to opening my bottle of Maharaja now."

"The Avery IPA poured a golden amber with tropical fruit and slight citrus hops on the nose. There were floral and tropical fruit hops on the initial sip that faded to piney and resinous hop flavors on the back end that coated my palate with a good hop bitterness. The brew was very bright and clean with the fresh hop notes jumping off my tongue. The Avery IPA was a very well done classic IPA that was a refreshing treat."

"Poured hazy golden color with thick foamy head and excellent lacing on the side of the glass. Strong citrusy smell with hints of pine. Citrusy, malty taste in the beginning, followed by a strong, piney hoppy taste. A smooth maltiness finishes it out. Excellent bitter aftertaste that persists."

"Overall: One of the best IPAs. Extremely nostalgic."
"O- Decent beer, nothing spectacular but nothing wrong with it either. I have had it before and I thought it had a much stronger citrus flavor to it so maybe I just got an older batch this time. All in all it is a good beer to try but there are definitely better ones out there."

"Hazy, golden-orange pour with a small cap of white head that retained well and laced the glass. Crisp hop aroma, pine and citrus, with some bready malts coming through. Actually quite malty in the taste up front, but pleasant and not overly sweet, mid-palate quickly brought in a rush of crisp hops, orange rind and pine, for a lasting bitterness that took the edge off the obvious malt base. Medium body, crisp, fresh mouthfeel. Quite a solid IPA overall."

"O: It seems that this beer was not able to find a happy medium; I had a hard time determining whether I should be sipping or sessioning, and so I ended up not really satisfied. But the hophead in me loves that lingering bite after each sip, so I can’t complain too much – it really is a good beer, one that’s stood up to more age than it should have."

"O- A straightforward, but very aggressively bitter IPA. I've had better, but certainly have had much worse."
"Yellow-orange, hazy appearance with some sediment. Nice fluffy sugar-white head. The aroma was appealing with grapefruit and orange sweetness overwhelming my nose. The flavor itself was much more better than the nose let on, with piny, and mostly resinous hop tastes. Very, very dry. Overall, there isn't much too this one, but it is good, solid, and very drinkable... I'm glad they offer this in cans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The highlight of this beer is the wonderful strong finish, despite being 6.5%. In general, the beer really reminds me of Stone IPA with its color, aroma, hop profile, etc. Just an extremely solid IPA."

"Avery IPA pours a light copper color with a slightly hazy body. Incredible lacing rules the glass. Smell is a 5 because the hops are so pungent. Based off of that there is almost no way that there can be a letdown with the taste. As expected there is not. I am really digging the hops blend here and the result is an explosion of flavor. Citrus notes, especially grapefruit are apparent. The chinook hops are more passive here which is fine with me. This one is not offensive at all in terms of mouthfeel and the aftertaste is clean. It leaves you wanting another sip immediately. I'd have to say that this is one of the better IPAs that I have encountered in awhile."

"Overall: While this is a very drinkable beer, there really isn’t too much to it…standard IPA, with a bit of a floral kick, but nothing drastic…it’s not a citrus hop IPA, it’s not a malty IPA, it’s not a floral IPA…it’s just an IPA, which is fine…with that said, though there’s nothing distinctive about this brew, I would drink it again happily because the flavor that it does bring is enjoyable, crisp, refreshing and hoppy…(3/5)"

"O-Nice aroma, good flavor hops, but the heavy piney hops clash with the grain bill. A slightly darker beer or maltier grainbill would be nice. With this very light colored and flavored IPA citrusy C hops seem more appropriate. Nice Am IPA"

"Overall – I expected more based on their IPA/DIPA's and the high reviews. It has a nice taste but there is nothing vibrant to the smell and it's just a tad boring overall. A decent beer but not something I'd buy again."

"Not sure how fresh this is, but wasn't dusty when I picked this up. Pours a real light orange yellow, and somewhat distinct for an IPA. Clear but not sparkling too. Nose doesn't give much hops, IMO, but I'm getting more defined sweetness from the malt. I expect this to be hoppy but, but not prominently either, and that's exactly what I get. Malt masking the hops, the hops coming in later, and there, but not loud. I would think in this form, this would be a brew that would please malt forward lovers of beer who want a moderate touch of hops. Freshness too might be clouding my observations."
""
""
" All in all a very nice beer , Im glad I found this and can buy it local , another win for me"
"This beer poured out as a very nice golden color with a white head on top. The head retention and lacing were both very nice. The smell of the beer is very nice, lots of strong hop aromas with a subtle malt backbone. The taste of the beer has a great hoppy flavor. Lots of pine-like flavors. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a nice carbonation. Overall it's a great IPA, easily available and well priced. Very good stuff worth having again."
"HOP FREAKS UNITE!!! This is a lovely hop bomb. A true Yankee IPA. I loved this beer! Hope is there right in your nose as you get the glass to you face taking in that first break in anticipation of the first sip of this beer! Upon first sip you are given a lovely taste balance of hops and malt. The taste of both are not over powering in the least, very smooth. A nice head ring remains around the glass, after taste dissipating within a few minutes. I could kill off an afternoon and an evening with nothing but this in my hand!"

"My overall feeling is that this beer has been over-filtered and under-dry-hopped. To get a beer as clear as they have, you really have to be careful and know what you're doing to not lose all the important hop aroma and flavor that really make a contemporary American IPA. I'm guessing this is why it's so crystal clear but underwhelming in terms of hoppy flavor and aroma. There's quite a few breweries doing amazing stuff in this category and I don't think this one stands out in todays crowded IPA scene. It's a bit above average, but I've had lots of better ones."

A great, great IPA that was tasty and flavorful from start to finish: a top notch IPA."

Mouthfeel is waxy but still crisp. Goes down smoothly. A delicious beer to be enjoyed on any occasion. Notable IPA."
"Golden amber color,out of the can with a nice frothy head that lingers well. Somewhat opague. Smells of a piney with mild citrus hops. presence of malt gives a slight caramel smell and taste. Crisp hop flavor when fresh; after a bit of time you get a hint of candy but still good."

"Spectacular hue of honey-orange, clear, with a rocky 3-4 finger cap of foam that persists, receding slowly leaving copious heavy lacing. It looks delicious. Smell is a bit of a let down. Mildly orange, muted hop, biscuits. Blah. Taste steps it back up, good bitterness flowing with orange citrus pith and herbal elements. Zesty. Wet. Nice, nice balance with a bit of honey, biscuit malt. Canned peaches. Pears. This is Very good. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, carbonation is just right. Mildly lingering bitterness for a clean finish. Half empty now and the sides of this glass are thickly coated with curtains of lacing. Overall very, very good."

"clear golden yellow pour with 1/4"" white head. smells of grapefruit, cascade hops, grass. bitter earthy up front followed up by a citrusy tangy bitterness. tastes of dirt, grapefruit, pine. medium body with a nice creaminess to it.. fizzy carbonation makes it go down easily. this is a really nice IPA overall, not too special, but nice and bitter, yet very refreshing."

"O- Try it. I look forward to my next trip to Boulder so I can get this straight from the source. One of the hoppiest basic IPAs I've had. Honestly though, I think its better if you let it sit for 10-15 minutes in the glass before drinking it. I found it improved as it warmed."
"Golden in color with minimal head, this IPA smells of pine soap and, honestly, tastes a bit like it too. Also some hints of vanilla. Medium bodied and rather smooth mouthfeel. A good beer to enjoy by a campfire on a chilly night amongst the conifers."

"Notes: This is a very hyped-up beer, and it should be as it is an absolutely marvelous beer for all the hop-heads out there... For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection.

"Overall this is a good IPA but nothing special."

"Avery has this IPA thing down pat. Pours clear golden with medium head, fluffy and white. Aroma of strong pine, some pale malts in the background, and just an ever so slight hint of citrus. Flavor follows with a nice up front bitterness of pine that mellows into a dangerously drinkable sweet citrus. Slick but relatively light and easy drinking, medium high carbonation. A classic example of the style. Nicely done."

""

"T: The one dimensional thing worked with the smell, but it's not working quite as well with the flavor. A good amount of hops with a really high amount of bitterness and not enough malt to smooth things out. I probably wouldn't do this one again."

"I can't believe I haven't officially set down my thoughts on this stuff yet. Go figure. It pours a clear golden-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sharp pine, strong grapefruit, and a kiss of mild honey. I have this sneaking suspicion that some hops have been added to this beer... The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit, complete with peel, stealing the limelight. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a somewhat simple, yet very tasty and satisfying, IPA. Good times."
"O - Very drinkable. Will have again. Especially like the availability in the can. Great for the outdoors!"
"This is a solid, well balanced IPA."

"Refreshing. Overcarbonated. On the verge of bitter but nicely done overall. I do think there are other IPAs, specifically of the west coast types, that are better than this but this is solid."

"O – Really solid IPA. Nice refreshing flavors. May fall short if you are hop crazy as it is not as biting as some. All told this is a damn solid brew."

"O-I dig this beer. but what else do you expect from Avery?"
"This is my first beer from Avery. I figured this would be a good starting point. I've had better IPAs, but don't have many complaints here."
"From the can: pours a hazy light golden body with a bright white head with excellent retention that leaves one of the most thorough lacing patterns I've ever seen. Aromas lean toward the centric spectrum, with a bit of pine resin and caramelly malts swimming in the mix as well. Tastewise, orange and lemon peel come through loud and clear on the front palate, with sweeter malt flavors like caramel apple hold the middle before piny flavors define the finish. For me personally, this beer manages to be simultaneously assertive yet easy and pleasurable to drink all on its own, no pub grub required."
"In conclusion This is one heck of India Pale Ale. A wonderfully balanced brew with a dry finish. I don’t really know if cozy is the right word but I’ll refer to anyway. The balance is flawless. Not too bitter, not too sweet. Just a dryness that’s very appealing. Part of the commercial description reads “Brewed by hop heads, for hop heads.” Avery to that!"
"I really liked this beer. I think it was a tad too fruity or girly, but it went down smooth."
"O- Very good. A basic AIPA but it has a nice rough personality."
"O: A great everyday IPA: I often forget about this beer but I shouldn't--it's awesome"
"Golden/bronze hue, not much murkiness at all. About a half-finger head. Lots of hops and a hint of citrus (I'm getting grapefruit) on the nose. The hops dominate most of the taste of the beer; high alpha acid American hop bitterness shines through, and some nice spiciness on the back end finishes it off. The mouthfeel is my favorite part; medium, but the bitterness and spiciness tingles the sides of the mouth and it still finishes really clean. A good session IPA. Definitely will be coming back to this one."
"Fruity and citrusy hops dominates the smell of the head. A grapfefuit aroma eminates from the head. Golden amber with sheer white head that disappears. Super floral hops with an amazing sweet sour combination with a grassy finish. Palate is slightly resenous with light traces of carbonation and a long, tasteful finish. Overall, one of Colorados top IPAs, especially fresh."
"O- this is one of my favorite ipa's to style. I liken it to sierra nevada torpedo with a little less sweetness and a little more varied hop flavor. Bitter with a lot of pungent hop flavor and little to no malt present, just like an american ipa should be. This capped off my night of avery brews (white rascal, out of bounds stout, ipa) and is my favorite of the three."
"Overall - I would dub this a ""summer"" IPA. Unusually light, crisp, and yet enjoyable all at the same time. Perfect for drinking inside a screened in porch."
"Pours a clear light apple juice color with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus/tropical fruits, and some citrus zest hop aromas. Taste is of toasty malt, citrus juice, and some floral and herbal hop flavors. A very mild bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a dry finish just like the can says. Overall, this is a good IPA with a nice balance between the malt and hops."
"Overall a nice brew gald I tried it and if I had regular access to it would definately rotate it."
"O: This is a very well crafted IPA in the West Coast style. You know what to expect, and this one stand tall, but not quite in an elite category."
"Color is a burnt yellowish-orange with a one-finger head. The smell is subtle and doesn't really take over your nose like it should. The hops carry the flavor throughout the sip. It's stronger on the pine and resin profile rather than the fruit and citrus. I prefer a little more balance in that area. If finishes with a flat bitterness and not as clean as I prefer either. Not a bad beer but not a good beer either. I wouldn't buy them again when there are so many others that are better for the same price."
"D/O- Overall not impressed with this Avery offering. I wasn't expecting world class by any means but I wouldn't even considered this an ""average"" IPA."
"for avery, which is a wonderful brewery, this is by and large a non-descript ipa. pours golden and thin, weak vanishing head. nose is generic hops, nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. taste is a weak ipa. its an ipa yeah, but for avery, this is lame. their maharaja proves they know how to do it, but this one just comes up short. also somehow weirdly filling, and not in a nice way. eh"
"At just 69 IBU's, this is not that bitter of an IPA, but it still tastes good and I enjoyed it. Maybe we should call it IPA Lite."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. great IPA flavor with some nice citrus notes. Pretty damn good Avery."
"This is a very good single IPA. Most of the time I'm more of a Maharaja kind of guy. But this is a smooth, balanced, and flavorful example of the single IPA."
"Overall: Good IPA but not in my top 5. I did like the hop and citrus tones."
"Pours a nice golden / amber with a nice medium white head. Sweet floral citrus hops, some nice grapefruit and fruity notes and malt aroma fill the nose.Taste is sweet caramel malts, citrus, grapefruit notes with some nice earthy, citrus hops. Nice crisp medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet caramel malt, some yeast flavor as it warms up, nice subtle citrus grapefruit notes and nice citrusy earthy hops ending. Overall a very nice, solid easy drinking IPA."
"O-A bit of a letdown for an agressive brewery that brings out some nice ales. Interesting profile, but generally not what I am looking for in an IPA."
"O: A fine example. I like most of Avery's offerings, and their IPA had been a favorite of mine ever since I found the light of American craft beer. I've found plenty better since, but I really appreciate it's drinkability for a being a well hopped AIPA."
"Having this & Ska Modus available as canned options thrill me. I do like this better from the bottle,but this could be a freshness issue since I really don't know how to translate the date coding"
"***I just checked the website at the hop is not citric....which is a surprise to me....but Casscade, Chinook, columbus, and centinniel.****"
"O - I like the Tropical AIPAs and this fits that bill nicely. A solid AIPA"
"O: A very drinkable beer with pretty good flavors. Nothing groundbreaking but it is one I have never had and I would like to find more of Avery's products."
"O: a really wonderful American IPA, one of the better ones I've had."
"O: I really wish the can was dated. As I drink it now, it is nothing special. Really an average IPA and a subpar mouthfeel for me."
"O - A solid IPA. Hop-forward with a complimenting maltiness. I will purchase this again."
"O: enjoyable as an everyday ale"
"O: Superbly drinkable and very enjoyable. Recommended. Will have again. If it's not as powerfully flavorful as some might like, it's well-crafted and subtly excellent."
"O: This is an excellent standard bearer for Avery. It is bold, bitter and very crisp. It is not watered down or toned down like some flagship offerings are."
"Overall: This is a solid IPA, it's not 100% like a west coast IPA, there is a good malt presence and there is a bit of pine taste in it, but also very citrusy. This is a good one for hop heads as the taste isn't trul;y balanced out, it is a hoppy one. Again a very solid offering from Avery."
"Poured rich bright clear amber into glass. Aroma is of a light caramel and almost sweet and light hoppiness. At first taste is of bitterness but is quickly smoothed out and you can taste the caramel and smooth maltiness. Only leaves a light reminder of the beer you just enjoyed great light American IPA. Very good for a nice session."
"O - A standout IPA - not necessarily unique, but a strong example of style. This is the first IPA I’ve had from Avery, and I’d be interested to try all of their other varietals."
"I've been drinking this for years from the bottle. The can tastes just as great and is an even better reason to pick it up."
"Overall - I think for this style of piney/dry hopped west coast American IPA style, its one of the better ones I've had so far."
"O - Overall... I like this one, but its a little one dimensional or maybe two... Meaning the hops are singular styled. Good ipa though, a winner for sure for a single/normal ipa!"
"One of my favorite canned IPAs."
"Overall: despite some textural issues, I like this flavor of this beer a lot. I would definitely seek this out again."
"Crystal clear, orange color; good carbonation with thick, fluffy white head. Tons of lacing. Strong citrus notes along with floral, planty, and grassy aromas. Little to no malt evident. Nicely bitter flavor - grassy and planty, resinous with good citrus notes to balance. A bit on the drier side - a little caramel malt is evident but otherwise not much malt flavor. Nice crisp and bitter mouthfeel. Well-balanced and a great example of the style."
"O- A good everyday drinking IPA. Nothing particularly earth shattering or exquisite, but I can respect this offering from Avery whole heartedly."
"Overall, a really delicious tasting IPA that has a nice malty sweetness to balance out the hops."
"O: a tasty IPA from Avery here, more in the balanced arena than hopbomb, so depending on what you like this beer is either excellent or just another good drinkable IPA."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I enjoyed this while I was at the beach because it was a nice change of pace from the usual cocktails my family gets by the pool. Now that I'm home, I'm finding the bitterness to be a bit unbalanced and takes away from an otherwise solid taste profile. Nice hop integration that doesn't outshine the malts."
"Hazy orange color with foamy crisp white head. Smelled of pear and citrus fruits. Citrus fruits came through on the taste along with notes of vanilla and honey infused malts. I actually like how the malt profile is kicked up a tiny bit to balance the hop volume a little...though it is still a hop forward brew. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel for an ipa, though still crisp enough. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Altogether one of the most balanced IPAs I've ever has."
"A great, middle of the road west coast IPA. And it comes in the can! Everyone likes it in the can!!"
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. After the initial taste bud impact, the beer slides down smoothly without being very sticky. It persists just long enough to allow the bitter aftertaste to take effect but does not overstay its welcome."
"Overall this is one of my favorite IPAs, if i were to introduce someone to IPA this would be a pick for sure."
"What's to not like about this IPA? I'm impressed, and I wonder why it took me so long to give it a try. I'm surprised its rating is not a little higher than it is. I will buy a six-pack of Avery IPA the next time I see it and I'd be happy to find it on-tap."
"O - A pretty good IPA. I'm a fan of Avery and I got this on sale for $7.99 for the 6 pack. It's a steal at that price."
"very nice golden color with a huge fluffy head on top. Massive amounts of lacing on down the glass. Very strong fresh mown grass aroma. Quite malty with a definate hop bite to it. Great plain old hop flavor-against the initial bite the 2 are nicely balanced. Touch of sweetness in the finish. Very solid mouthfeel. WOW! A great US IPA all in for me-almost dangerously drinkable at 6.5%."
"T: nice bitterness, strong on flavour, resinous, long final, some malt sweet notes and alcohol falvour at the very end, medium body, the carb is not noticed on tongue, alcohol warming"
"This one goes down very nicely, the bitterness and hop flavor is substantial but not overwhelming. Special bonus that this is in cans. Would buy again for sure."
"Overall - Very tasty, and easy to drink. Very floral and hoppy, lower alchol and good price, really impressed me. Only thing i didnt like was it left a dry bitter finish, but overall its great.I really enojoyed the hop bite it had, and the sweet fruits really make this tasty. Recommended."
"O: An enjoyable American IPA and true to the style, this brew is nicely hopped but remains balanced enough that it isn't overwhelmingly bitter. This is a solid summer and early fall brew that is decidedly simple but brewed with a quality and precision that you can't help but appreciate. If you're looking for an aggressive or edgy IPA, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a solid, drinkable and refreshing summer IPA, give this one a try. Cheers!"
"Pours medium amber with a significant head and some lacings. Aroma is bitter pine needles. Big citrus hop hit somewhat offset by sweet malt. Nice finish. This is a memorable pour. Well recommended. One of the best canned IPAs."
"Overall I think this is to yeasty and not hoppy enough. I have some research in on how old this bottle is, so I don't know how fresh this is and if it's not fresh I will re-review this when I get a fresh bottle."
"This is a fantastic example of an American IPA. If someone asked me to suggest a West Coast IPA to them, I'd tell them Avery IPA. A great beer."
"Overall, a decent brew. I'd have it again."
"Damn fine IPA. More than the sum of it's parts. I may have another."
"D - It's hot here in San Diego, and I could drink a lot of these right now."
" Body is appropriate for the style, not too thn or too sticky, but carries the flavor well. Nicely drinkable, this is a good, hoppy ale, although not quite up to west coast hop bomb standards."
"It's a decently balanced IPA, but really nothing extravagant."
"Very enjoyable IPA that I highly recommend."
"def. going to grab another while on sale...this beer is def. awesome @ 6.5 abv, have you feeling irie as well"
"O - I like but don't love this beer. It's more bitter than many IPAs, which I appreciate. I think it is the malt/grass/spice smell/flavors that aren't that interesting to me."
"O: carbonation is good enough to maintain a head at a thin layer for a while, a good basic IPA."
"Heard a lot of good things about avery, picked up a 6-pack of their IPA. Poured from the bottle to a pint glass, light yellow, surprisingly light for an IPA. Not much of a nose on it, a bit of citrus and piney spice but not too much. The body is light, the flavor is good, a nice amount of bitter with a sip. This is an OK not great, IPA. If you're an hop head that's big on the flavor/aroma this IPA won't be high on your list, but it's tasty enough to give a whirl."
"Poured this straight from the can into a pint glass. The color is transparent gold. The aroma is fresh hops, citrus, tropical fruit, and pine. I also get some nice caramel, bready malts. The taste is incredible. Exactly like the smell, yet the hop bitterness is balanced well by the malts. This is a 1st tier ipa for sure."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good IPA. The balance is a tad hoppy for my taste, but that is really just personal preference. This beer is really a good example of the style. I think that Adam may have had to change the hop schedule since the last time I tried this beer (~3 years ago), so the aroma is a bit odd at first, but it still is well blended and drinkable. If you like hoppy beers, I would definitely tell you to give this beer a shot."
"O - This isn't my favorite IPA in the world, but if you're looking for a lighter, more pungent IPA this is certainly worth a try. I've never tasted an Avery beer that I didn't like and this one is no different.. Quality. Period. The more I drink it, the more I like it to be honest... that's a good sign."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice golden color with a decent 1 1/2 finger white head. Good active carbonation present. The aroma is sweet and citrusy with nice clove spice and pine needle present. The taste is nice and sticky with grapefruit and orange citrus up front and a nice spicy pine mix in the finish. Not much for malt balance in this brew, but in an IPA I like the bold bitterness. Light to medium body and has a nice pop from carbonation. Decent brew here."
"Not bad not really good. Well enough put together but lacks enough malt balance for me to go with the hoppy flavors. Scent is great, rest is lacking."
"Whoa! Like, I said, nose was floral and minty/grassy and I was sent, man. Coming back down, the mouthfeel was meaningless as I just wanted the sweet, sweet taste of hops running around on my tongue and down my throat. Yeah, that's it, give it to me, baby! CAN't they just CAN hops extract for people like me? Why do I gotta go through this torture? It had a beautiful taste, grassy, minty, slightly piney and I felt like a hops virgin again. Finish was when when I sat back and started licking the lacing out of the glass. My sponsor is on his way over, but I think that it is too late. I'm filling a cooler with this, tooling over to Hops (not Skid) Row, picking up my buddies and we're going surfing on hops down at the beach. Look for us, we're the pasty guys all huddled around the cooler with our eye out for The Man."
"I enjoyed it and would drink again for sure. Too bad they're leaving Wisconsin."
"Poured from a 12oz into my fav pint glass. Head is super white and sticks around till the last drop. The color is light like a fruit beer and ultra filtered. Should be a little darker to hint at the taste in my opinion. Smells like hop fruit and molasses very inviting but a little muted due to a soapy influence. Taste is slamming though, a little soap some citrus hops and big burnt sugar the exhale is very enjoyable. Carbonation is perfect but could use a bit more weight. Overall a def recommendation. The smell and taste make this a go to beer, a few dollars cheaper and I would be all over this."
"O-A very nice IPA. Not world class, but I wouldn't ever turn my nose up at one of these-its solid."
"I enjoyed this IPA quite a lot...it's a solid everyday type of affair!"
"D: The beer didn't blow me away, but it also wasn't really bad."
"Overall, this is a beer I'll be happy to grab again!"
"D-very drinkable and solid brew but can't stand up well to many of the best ipas. Still enjoyable and nothing you would refuse."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall, this is ok for the style. This is my first time trying this beer ... perhaps my experience would be a bit different had it come from a bottle instead of a can? ... or maybe I'm thinking that since we're all so used to drinking craft beer from bottles. Anyhow, this would be a great beer for someone getting used to/into the style."
"O: So so. I'd give it 3.5 stars. Not quite 4. I'm hoping it's due to maybe an old bottle. This is certainly one I would try again. At the same time I'm happy I didn't get a 6 pack of it."
"A clear golden/orange with about a finger of thick head shrinks down to a thick layer of lacing. Large mounds on the sides. On the nose I get sour malts and a dirty type of piney/citrus hop. Some alcohol notes also shine through. Creamy body with a light finish. A piney hop bite upfront that keeps on going. The middle is faintly citrus and finishes very dry. A lot of that dirty pines cuts through a little to much."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"This was a pretty overall solid IPA from Avery, with well balanced hop flavors and a generally pretty easy feel for the alcohol content. It had been awhile since I’ve had this one and it more than held up to what I remembered of it."
"This brew pours a hazy golden yellow hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a half finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell has aromas of pineapple,lychee,toffee and citrus zest,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of grapefruit,passionfruit,pineapple,light toffee and finished with a nice tinge of piney bitterness and overall a nice AIPA and would buy again."
"O: a pretty good single IPA. I have a feeling that this one isn't very fresh but it's still pretty good."
"I was disapointed with this beer because I was told good things, it's not bad, it's just not that great either."
"As the Avery IPA leaves the mouth a distinct after taste is left lingering on the palate; with the front of the mouth mildly dry with a light malty flavor and the back featuring grapefruit hints and hoppiness."
"After having this one on tap, I immediately went to procure a six pack of cans. Sadly, although good, the insane hoppiness was rather muted. Poured a rich, golden color, with a nice white head. Muted hop aromas (comparatively) along with some light caramel. Easy drinking and medium bodied, with caramel and earthy hops."
"Thought it was fine, maybe a bit..raw? Harsh? Not bad, just not enough malt, it got buried completely."
"Overall, decent IPA but the boldness needed for a solid IPA is a bit lacking. However, it is quite drinkable and reasonably priced."
"On tap at my watering hole, Old Chi's Westy. Poured an orangeish color with a nice foamy head that hung around for a bit. Aroma of biscuts, citrus, and mowed lawn. Taste was citrusy with some malt and biscuts and some spice with a nice hop bitterness on the finish. Even doing this out of the ""metallic"" stein at Old Chi's, this is still a quite enjoyable brew."
"I love how bitter this beer is. It was served at one of my favorite restaurants. I loved to get it, but since I'm in TN I no longer can. Bummer. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I used to get it whenever and wherever I could! Try it if you can, you won't be sad you did!"
"I am a fan of Avery but this didn't hit the top of my list of their brews. DuganA is a much better IPA in my book."
"Sampled 3/11/11"
"Clear light gold body, some visible carbonation, 1/2 finger head resulted in pretty good lacing. Hops dominate the nose, tropical with some citrusy, lemon pith, resin. Taste mirrors nose, more sweet than resiny. Medium light mouthfeel, minimal effervescence. Fairly well balanced, but not all that memorable or something I would seek out again."
"o - Overall this is a pretty subtle IPA. The hops are not in your face and the bitterness is very subtle and not offensive as well. There is no bottled on date, but I imagine it don't get much fresher than a sample from the distributor trying to sell product? Pretty good though and a bit candied in the flavor dept. This would be a good introductory IPA."
"O: For some reason, I feel like canned beers are more drinkable... this is definitely an easier-drinking IPA, though. Very tasty stuff - another candidate for “best camping / fishing / beach beer” (the canned version, that is)."
"Solid brew overall. Would be a regular in my rotation if readily available in my neck of the woods."
"O: Another very drinkable IPA. I enjoyed it. Not the best IPA around but most certainly not the worst. Not as ""citrusy"" as described on the bottle label, but still goood and I would have again."
"The batch I got must be super fresh because I cant imagine the hops getting any better than this. Great IPA."
"This is a tasty, well balanced easy drinking beer. I like that it's now available in cans."
"D - Good brew, could sip a couple of these with no problem"
"The epitome of an IPA in my opinion. Well balanced, good carbonation, full creamy mouthfeel. Malt is a bit chewy and toffee driven with some biscuit on the finish. A melange of hop character then spaces itself out in the mid palate and finish. Tropical with some citrus in the middle leading into the pine and floral notes on the bitter moderate finish. Nothing that is going to thieve the enamel from your teeth but just so nicely balanced."
"O) I think this is a good ""refreshing"" IPA, not your typical ""Big"" IPA that you would want to savor with the tongue, and taste for 30 minutes after finishing it."
"O: Very nice offering. Stands above other ipa's but not life changing. I would purchase again as this is a quite sessionable ipa."
"Pours a pale yellow/orange with a one-finger bright white head. Good lacing and decent head retention. Citrus aroma. Orange and lemon zest aroma. Taste starts off with citrus hops. Same orange and lemon zest as were in the nose. Little bit of grapefruit. Decent caramel and hint of toffee backing malt, but gives way to a bitter pine resign finish. Lingers well into the aftertaste."
"O: overall a solid IPA from Avery. Easy drinker with great flavors .."
"Ending notes: Overall this is a very nice IPA. I would recommend this to the typical hop head. Nicely done, Avery!"
"This is a very solid IPA. It doesn't amaze, but it executes its simple flavor profile. I'm glad to see it in cans; it'd be a great beer to take fishing."
"O- Overall a solid IPA but hard to defeat so many other great beers of the same style."
"O- This is a nice beer, definitely one that I would turn to for a hop fix."
"O - Sold IPA. Crisp and flavorful. Few flaws. Will visit again."
"Good mouthfeel and carbonation, and overall a great IPA."
"O= Again I say it's a bit of a let down but I am also somewhat blessed living in the land of Surly and Town Hall. I prolly won't buy this again but I am happy I tried it and would even say seek it out if ya can."
"M/D: light bodied but a little watery for an IPA. Good drinkability."
"A decent IPA but I couldn't find anything that made it special or stand apart from the rest. Drinkable but wouldn't be my first or second choice."
"O: Overall, a decent IPA. Far from great, but solid nonetheless. The fact that it comes in cans now makes it a good option to take to a friend's."
"sixer picked up in Ft. Collins for the trip out into the wastelands, was pretty surprised to have not rated it in the past"
"Light brown/amber with a thick white head. Faint aroma is possibly a bit funky, maybe fruity....hard to tell. As time went on, the aroma became a bit more pronounced, floral with some maltiness. Wow!! Taste is great and wonderfully balanced. Starts mild with some fruityness, then a nice balance of fruit, slight citrus and malt, finishing up with some dry bitterness. Very well done, everything melds well, the tastes all complimenting each other. Very light on the palate, especially at first. Very drinkable and overall a wonderful beer if you want flavor without any one flavor overwhelming the other."
"I've been on an Avery kick recently but this IPA pales in comparison to it's bigger brothers and most local selections. Pretty standard fare."
"D: Super easy drinking and I love that they are canning now. Really makes so much sense since their stuff gets here 6 months after it is bottled. A nice easy drinking IPA. Good everyday drinker."
"Mouthfeel. Medium bodied with a dry finish."
"The CPJ"
"I'll definitely buy this beer in bottle after tasting it on tap."
"Drinkability: A pretty standard American IPA here. It's good and certainly very enjoyable but, honestly, there's nothing here to make it stand out from most other above-average American IPAs. Fairly drinkable and sessionable and certainly worth a try..."
"Not a bad IPA really... A good selection when some of the powerhouses aren't available..."
"Golden color similar to a Pale Lager. Really nice 1 inch head that dissipated down to about 1/4 inch and stayed that way to the finish. Excellent lacing throughout. The smell was a balance of honey, malt, and sweet hops. The flavor had sweet, citrusy hops at the start with a creamy malt backbone in the middle, finishing with a nice bitter hop edge. Overall, I found this beer to be highly drinkable, and will seek it out again. The fact it comes in cans makes it truly portable."
"Poured into my affligem chalice. Nice deep gold color. Quickly fled my head by laced my face. Smell is piney and citrus but not much for malt aroma. Taste is splendid well worth the wait. I ordered and waited about 12 days to try! Mouthfeel is very good. Slight carbonation and medium bodied. Paired with a short Cuban, cigar that is. Has session potential. Will drink hard, drink fast, and drink often. Cheers."
"Drink- I was expecting a lot more from this but it was still pretty good."
"From a 12oz can. Pours a very thin looking light golden color, with a one finger head that has good retention and lacing. Bitter citrus hops in the aroma with a lot of grapefruit, a bit of grainy malt. Bitter floral hops hit the palate first, with some buttery biscuit malt and a deep bitter aftertaste. A bit light in the body and aftertaste, good balance in the carbonation. Easily drinkable, the medium ABV and mellow taste help."
" Grade B+ Purchased at Stony's-$10.99 6pack"
"Good drinkability, this is a solid IPA that seems to fly under the radar."
"Certainly a strong IPA, though not one of my favorites."
"Avery IPA pours out a very bright gold and that's it concerning color, a nice bright white frothy, dense inch of foam that comes down to a cap, minimal lacing. The smell is weak, this smells like a two month old pale ale, malt, grass, light citrus. The taste really revs things up though, a nice change. Citrus, some pine, tangerine, pale malt, not to much, this is quite nice. Feel is a sharp bitter towards the end, light bodied a little too much carbed but not over bitey. A nice IPA and one of the better Avery beers I've had. Adam just needs to add some more aroma hops, that's all."
"D. The satisfying taste and medium body feel makes this an enjoyable beer to drink when in the mood for an IPA."
"This is a good IPA and one worth trying."
"Light orange with a white head. The aroma is grassy and citrus hops with a little bit of biscuit malt mixed in. A well-balanced aroma. The flavor is caramel malt with some orange citrus and grassy notes mixed in. Balanced flavor with low bitterness. The beer is a very easy drinker. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Not overblown, this one can probably be enjoyed over multiple pints."
"Taste-Big dose of hops, juicy and bitter grapefruit, long, lingering hoppy finish. Damn fine and tasty out of a can. Excellent portability for camping, fishing, boating, etc."
"D: Easy drinking, tasty single IPA"
"This is a quite drinkable, even sessionable IPA, but not one of my favorites. It is solid all around, but nothing really stands out to me. Good, not great."
"Pours a slightly clear light amber color with a thick white head and very little lacing. Smells of resinous hops and a little citrus and some floral notes. Tastes of bitter hops with a pine flavor and a little citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"On tap at Stoney's in DC. Poured into pint glass. Pours pale gold with a long lasting, big fluffy white head. Really awesome lacing. Nose is floral and citrus hops with a little malt/ corn smell. Taste is hops with a hint of malt and a nice bitter/malty aftertaste. Overall the hops dominate but it's not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect for the style."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with an above average level of carbonation. This would be very drinkable due to it's lighter mouthfeel and great flavors, but the odd aftertaste takes away from that. Otherwise, I could drink this all day."
"Translucent orange base with one finger white bubbly head. Head retention was very short, but a nice layer of sticky white lace remains. Typical IPA characteristics on the smell - some pine, lemon zest, and other citrus notes. Taste is similar to the nose with lingering pine notes. Mouth feel and drinkability remind me of a hoppy pilsner. A fairly light and refreshing IPA."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Nothing too impressive but definitely a beer flavorful enough to have a couple pints of."
"Drinkability. A decent drinker."
"Very drinkable. Not over hopped, and the bread and malt elements shine thru with just enough balance between sweet, toasty, and bitter. Very sessionable."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. good drinkability."
"No. Not ever again."
"Not my kind of flavor profile. Most IPAs I've had from reputable places are simply better than this one. My opinion only."
"Poured golden yellow with perfect clarity and a strong, rich, foamy white head. Good head retention as the foam slowly settled to a thick white head that left thick sticky lacings on the glass. Combination of citrus and floral hop aromas with a bready, malty undertone. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Floral and citrus hop flavors are pretty evenly matched in the front with a malty middle and relatively dry finish. A touch of pine hop bitterness at the end that tends to linger for a while which detracts a bit from the drinkability for me. The malty and hoppy flavors combine nicely to give this IPA some nice character."
"Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a dark yellow color, very little head and very little lacing. Smell- nothing much here. I'm afraid that the nice hops aroma that was once there is now gone. Taste- hops bitterness, some malt presence, and then an unpleasant bitter residue in the back of the throat. Pepper? Mouthfeel- avg. Drinkability- as I mentioned before, I let this one get past its prime and I take the blame for what I know happened here. I love Avery and know that this would otherwise be a great beer."
"D- If you have read my reviews before i am not a huge IPA fan but this is a nice one. I would say a top 7 IPA. I only drink the good IPA's a second time. i would buy a sixer anytime."
"Interested to find out more about this brewery and other beers they make that I have access too..."
"Smooth and crisp mouth feel and all and all a very drinkable ipa"
"D - Very high. Excellent American IPA. Very good, will be drinking this again soon. Maybe right now."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"Overall a very good go to IPA. Very good and just hoppy enough to keep you coming back for more, certainly for the price."
"Avoided Avery IPA in the past as there weren't bottle dates and it was generally a slow mover. Had to jump on the fresh arrival of the new cans and I must say I'm quite impressed. Also props to Avery for putting a date code on the bottom of the cans! I'll be back!"
"Overall this one stands out because it's so easy to drink. Great IPA from Avery!"
"The M&D are great as well. Very easy to drink and slightly thick, which makes it great to drink. Avery keep it up!!"
"This beer has a great hop taste to it. Very crisp and clean yet well balanced. Pours a light color with a quickly disappearing head. not much for lacing though. Some slight citrus notes but not overpowering like many other IPA's out there. The brewery boast that it's a beer brewed for hop heads by hop heads. While it is a very hop centered beer it's very well balanced as I said before. Not too overpowering. I probably wont be buying this one again though because i do prefer the overpowering hop flavor but this is definitely a good beer for those looking to get into hop heavy brews."
"It's definitely drinkable, but I usually like Imperial IPAs or those Double IPAs better. I know a lot of my friends don't like IPAs, so I don't think, for these people, this is drinkable."
"D - Easy going down, I could have a few of these without being overwhelmed. Then again that in and of itself states this isn't the greatest IPA I've had. Sometimes IPA's should be more memorable."
"Pretty easy to drink. Leaves me wanting another to be sure."
"D- I would have to say that this is in the class of IPA where one is enough. It is pleasant at first, but you know by the end your going to have had enough. Overall an average IPA that for me the hops dominated a bit too much."
"d - A pretty good IPA from Avery. The taste is a bit bitter and I prefer Maharaja (even though that's a DIPA), but would drink this again. Definitely worth checking out."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice creamy white head, very good head retention. Nice foam rings around the glass. The IPA is slightly hazy and has a apricot color. You get an average dose of hops that gives way to a slight note of citrus and finishes with a hoppy after taste. I would say this is a very average IPA. Not disappointed but not overly impressed. Prost!"
"Crisp initially then fades to a layered, matted mouthfeel. Warm and semidry. Relatively low to medium carbonation. Lingering bitterness. Well constructed and balanced but not a huge standout. A solid selection to be sure."
"Drinkability is good, this definitely is close to being a session IPA."
"D: Would definately do again"
"Re-tried some time later from the can. I now appreciate this IPA much more. I find it to be mellow enough to drink several, yet flavorful enough to keep me interested. The canned version seemed to please me more. One of the better canned IPAs I can easily obtain. Would like if it was a dollar or two cheaper, but this is a pretty sweet brew."
"This is an utterly fantastic, accessible, drinkable IPA. Liquid adult candy. Excellent."
"Goes down very easy but not the most exciting IPA around. Typical good quality from Avery. Maybe it's the new label, but they may have changed the recipe on this. I thought it was better before, but way too long ago for me to confirm."
"D: Goes down very easy but not the most exciting IPA around."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very nice drinking IPA overall. I particularly liked the little bit of tropical, pineapple, mango flavors I got out of it and would have liked even more. It had a very nice hoppiness to it though and I enjoyed it very much. Very solid beer overall."
"Very original for it style. Well balance IPA."
"D: I love IPA's, and this is a very good example of the style. Could definitely enjoy a second one right after I finish this guy if it was available."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Easy to drink and went well with some chipolte bbq wings."
"D: A well made IPA. Just nothing special when compared to all the other IPAs out there."
"D- easy to drink and im left wanting another one. at least one more. the alcohol is pretty well hidden and on the high side, so i can see this sneaking up on me. i feel this beer doesnt get the attention that it deserves."
"D Very much a drinkable beer. I am looking forward to having another."
"12 oz bottle. Pours bronze color with a lasting, foamy, white head, lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt and apple juice, some citrus hops come through while the beer warms up. Citrusy hops dominate the flavor with biscuit malt and vinous fruit provide some balance. Long, hoppy finish. Not my favorite IPA."
"I was really sad to see Avery's small presence at the GABF this year considering their success in Colorado."
"D - Well Avery seems to be the new brewery on my block. Offering some Pretty nice brews that are not so bad. Enjoyable!"
"A good IPA. Like that they put it in cans."
"This is just another great IPA. There's nothing special to recommend this over the multitude of other IPAs on the shelf, but there's nothing to fault it on either. Check it out."
"Overall: Not bad, but nothing special. A little sweet, but overall pretty balanced. This is a good summer standard and I think it would be a good introduction to crafts beer for BMC drinkers; maybe I'm just a little jaded by other more noteworthy brews?"
"Drinkability is just so darn good. This was a great beer buy, especially since we started getting Avery products in my neck of the woods. This will certain get to see some of my hard earned dollar."
"Avery has tweaked this recipe since I first started drinking this beer 3 years ago. It's still a really good IPA - a hophead's delight, but the hop profile is definitely different and I think I like the version from several years back a little better."
"Pours a medium amber-copper color with an off white head that leaves behind a tiny bit of lacing. Nose brings a good amount of citrus rind with a bit of citrus as well. Some amber and caramel malt in the background. Taste lays off the hop presence from the nose, bringing forward more balance and losing some of the nice hop integration that existed in the nose. Feel is medium with slight bitterness. Drinks pretty well and is one of their better non-sour offerings."
"Drinkability- I thought this was a very good IPA. It was so refreshing. I loved it. I will be trying to get more."
"D: Drank a 6'r while watching Monday night football and would have no objections of doing so again. Overall quality IPA (in the land of IPA's), easy drinker, well hopped and at 6.5% - definitely worth the eight bucks!"
"D: This was a decent IPA, but it doesn't quite stack up with some of the offerings I've become accustomed to here in Southern California."
"Very nice ipa."
"Avery pours a nice golden color with white head that clings to the glass. Fruity hop aroma with a hint of malt. The hop taste is there without the bitterness. Finishes with a hint of malt. The mouth feel while full is not overly heavy and is slightly crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. While not my favorite IPA this is a damn good beer after a long hard week."
"Would I buy more of it? - Definitely. This is some seriously hoppy stuff and the can preserves all those flavors so much better than a bottle."
"Im not a huge fan of the taste or smell, and could ask for more hoppy bitterness. Still a reasonably good beer"
"The flavor is where this beer let me down. Good hoppy IPA flavor in general, but muted and weak. It sort of tastes like it's overly carbonated, like you mixed a great IPA with a few ounces of tonic water. It does go down pretty smooth, and overall isn't horrible. Definitely wouldn't put it on my favorites list, but I would buy it again if I didn't see any better options."
"D - Tasty beer indeed. Would be a regular if available here."
"Avery IPA is a cloudy golden ale with a soft, dense, bubbly offwhite head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a green, hoppy aroma with notes of pine needles, pine resin and oranges. It has a slick medium body with a clean, silky finish. It's nice and bitter with a hint of sweetness. There's lots of pine and a hint of orange and grapefruit. It has a long, bitter, resiny aftertaste. It's a very solid Western IPA."
"A very decent IPA, in the upper echelon. Tastier on tap. Very drinkable. Good floral and resinous hops character."
"Pours clear orange in body with white head. Aroma of hop resin, citrus notes and grass. Tastes of hops, slight citrus, refreshingly bitter, grass, and evergreens. Light in body with light carbonation. A well-done IPA with an ABV that is hardly noticeable."
"Solid bitter IPA has perfect lacing, this one did surprise me."
"Overall: Solid IPA. Not the best in class but worth trying."
"Avery India Pale Ale 2010-B 12 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 69 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Lacy white foamy head. Clear bright orange gold color. Sweet floral NW aromatic hop front. Mildly creamy crisp delicate sweet smooth light Pale caramel dough citrus hop resin body. Clean balanced smooth mild hop spice refreshing end. Nice floral Rocky Mountain IPA. Sampled 12/5/2010. 6- Pack purchased for $9.99 @ The Ballard Market, Seattle on 7/14/2010."
"D: Although this is not one of the memorable IPAs, this is a fine brew nonetheless. They don't package sucky beers over at Avery."
"D-- Far more balanced than other IPA's out there. Not big and over the top but at times that is a good thing. More of an IPA you can drink 3-4 of and not get bored with. Well hidden ABV and just a good constructed IPA."
"I can honestly say that this is my favorite non-over the top IPA I've had yet. Excellent job Avery."
"picked up a six pack of this stuff cause I knew it was fresh, not necessarily because it was my fist pick. It is only fair to review a beer when it is fresh, I would bet that many beers here fail to hit the mark because of this, so beermakers, label your sh*t, and buy back old beer? (I end up buying more SA than I'd care to admit, cause I KNOW it will be fresh) So, may not always be possible, but would be a step in the right direction... I know, easier said than done, it is hard enough to just survive as a micro or craft brewer. Anyways, yes, pours a pale golden color, smells very citric, some floral hops and some faint malts. This is a very solid, yet middle ground IPA. It delivers that citric punch, not much pine, and a good baseline maltiness, reminiscent of the style. Faint alcohol in the nose....and somewhat heavy, for an IPA. Could even be an double IPA, and 6.5% abv, so drinkability, is wee bit heavy. What can I say, a solid entry, very true to the style of a west coast IPA, but not breaking too much ground in originality IMO. Pick this one up if you want a solid American hop fix, but take a chance on freshness, cause these are not bottle dated from what i can read."
"Gave this beer a shot while grilling some steak tip kabobs and I really enjoyed it. The color, head and aroma was what I expected for an American IPA. The taste was very good and overall the beer was very drinkable. I'm purposely not making specific comments because there was nothing special that jumped out at me. It was just a very enjoyable beer that I was free to enjoy without much thought."
"Overall, very full flavored and excellent balance. When I think of a good, aggressive American IPA, this beer has those characteristics. Could session a few of these for sure."
"A: Thick frothy head that slowly settles to reveal some spotty lacing along the interior of the glass, golden straw in color, lots of activity going on in the beer - 4.00, S: This is a pretty traditional American IPA that includes lots of nice citrus and pine aromas, there is also a light biscuity nose and a hint of grass in the background - 4.00, T: Distinct hop bitterness, substantial pine and grapefruit pith, mild sweetness and some spicy zest - 3.50, M: Mouth feel has a drying astringency to it, medium bodied - 3.50, D: A nicely crafted IPA, very drinkable and one I'd sample again, with no date on the bottle it's hard to know if I got this beer during its early days with the full hop effect - 3.75"
"Very drinkable though not my favorite in the style. Overall the beer is solid yet lacks in areas of personal preference. I could certainly drink a few of these but would probably reach for something else before too long. Solid beer and worth a taste."
"A very good beer and an excellent representation of the style. I have to admit it is better than I remember the first time."
"Creamy and smooth. Man, that bitterness sticks around. I could drink these all night. Great IPA."
"D-A little different for an IPA, which is nice sometimes. I'd like to try it again to make sure I what I had was fresh, because the mustiness in the nose is making me wonder."
"It has a bit of unadulterated bite. The hops are the main taste component and overpower everything. In this way it is out of balance, but nothing about that makes it a bad taste, just in your face."
"This is definitely a solid IPA, but I think there's some better options out there for hopheads."
"Served in a pint at Als via the beer gas mixture. Appears a crystal clear golden yellow color with a finger of creamy white head. Very solid retension with patchy lace clinging all over the glassware. Aroma is filled with a hop combo of citrus and herbal smells. Little bit of a grainy sweetness blends throughout. The taste of this brew is bitter with herbal hops upfront. Overall a light bodied brew that is modestly carbonated. Slightly crisp drying finish. Lingering aftertate of herbs and a biscuity grain character that imparts a bit of grassiness about the hops. Quite refreshing and drinkable."
"D-This beer has a great level of drinkability.If there was a little more to it,I would give it a 5.Overall,a great beer from a great brewery."
"F: FInishes pretty bitter and very slightly astringent. It's got lots more spicy and earthy hops with a little bit of the lingering citrus and orange, and even a little musty hop resins late (with the astringency). The finish is very long too, and is pretty dry."
"D: easy to drink - could have another. Haven't had a lot by Avery. Looking forward to trying one of their bigger beers in the future."
"This is overall a good beer. A kick back on the porch 6 pack type of beer in my opinion. Hoppy, but not as bitterly strong as I'd like. However, it is no doubt a good beer."
"d - solid ipa."
"Morey's Bottom Line: An above average, but not quite elite Ipa. Definitely worth a try. If you're a fan of Titan, I could see you enjoying this Ipa. I tend to like my Ipa's a little less earthy/malty."
"D: great taste, but I feel this is not the IPA I would be turning to often."
"This is a go to IPA."
"A reasonable IPA. It ticks all the boxes but isn't a stand out."
"D- Very easy to drink, after the 3rd one you tend to not care about the metallic finish and want more."
"Definitely a high IBU offering here from Avery. While I find the aggressiveness of the hops a little overbearing, I'm sure hopheads appreciate it."
"D - Moderate to low. 6.3 ABV is on the high end for an IPA and your mouth will shrivel up if you try to have more than 2 back to back from the IBU's."
"overall a decent ipa, nothing too spectacular, but still pretty tasty. i would buy this again, just maybe not right away."
"Pours a hazed burnt orange with adequate cap of frothy white head, leaving splotchy lacing. Scent is of earthy, piney hops with a touch of citrus, also present is a light carmely sweet malt. Taste brings a lightly bitter touch of piney and spicy hops, flavors of oranage linger behind and the backbone is a lightly sweet carmel taste with a touch of roasted nuts. medium bodied, slightly oily and dry on the toungue. A decent IPA that doesnt do anything remarkable or bad either."
"Good and solid, rather well balanced. Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp."
"DB- Not bad, a good balance of malt flavors and hop. Not impressive but still refreshing and worth the money."
"Overall a really nice example of a style that is almost over-saturated in today's market. This one has been around a while and I'm glad I finally got around to trying it. It probably won't be the last time either."
"D: Hop-forward and sweet, yet balance and smooth. If you like citrus and fruity IPA's this one is right up your alley."
"A solid ""IPA session"" from the Rockies for the IPA lover...A brilliant yellow golden clear color sits under a thin off white head. A light nectar citrus character fills the nose for the most part before this opens up to a sharp, tingly sweet mouthfeel that makes way toward a big and juicy bitter center. Good and easy to put away a few of these on a hot summer day, especially if you're an IPA guy or gal..."
"I wasn't sure if this one was outstanding or just simple. Maybe just simply outstanding? In the end, it was a good strong hop character in relation to the malts but seemed somewhat subdued in overall taste. It looks absolutely perfect and is very easy to drink so it's definitely nothing to avoid unless you like more balanced IPA's. It's a good hop fix beer while being refreshing."
"D: Very drinkable. Much like an English IPA."
"I could see myself enjoying this beer after a long day hiking in the rain-soaked Adirondacks, where nothing will be able to dry out except my mouth."
"Golden in color, with an orange tint and a thin white head that persisted for a few minutes after pouring. Aromas of lemon and other citrus, as well as hops, which had a certain funkiness to it (not unpleasant) that may be the earthiness that other reviewers noted. It drinks clean and dry, with relatively mild citrus hop flavors and some sweet maltiness in the background. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. This is a solid beer that tends away from the overt sticky sweetness that some IPAs possess."
"D: this isn't my favorite IPA. Perhaps I am not a fan of the particular hops used, but something just isn't working for me. And I'm sure its reasonably fresh considering it has the new packaging"
"D - had never heard of Avery and actually picked it up as part of a broken six-pack that I got at my local beer dispenser. I am both surprised and impressed. Will buy again should I come across it."
"Overall: Very good if it's an English IPA... If they're intending to compete with the best of the American IPAs, they've fallen very short. I would have this again, but I'm not in any hurry..."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"More of that in the taste, good pine resonation, almost sticky, very easy to drink, straight forward high hops, average bitterness beer. Not cheap, but compared to the other beers in the same quality, most of them are in 22oz'rs that you'll pay 7+ bucks for, or get a 6er for the same price."
"D: very refreshing. The light malt really balances the hops out. It is a bit of a session beer."
"To over-simplify, this beer is flowery and bitter. It isn't necessarily my favorite type of flavors for an IPA but still is a very good beer and a decent IPA. Two of these would be my max in one sitting, if that is any indication to its drinkability for someone who is not particularly fond of too flowery IPAs. Still, very good."
"D - Ive had many many IPA's and this one impressed me with it's potency, it's got such a great flowery hop punch for the ABV! I'll definitely buy this one again, very drinkable coming in at 6.3%. I definitely recommend this American IPA. Cheers!"
"D: This could very easily be enjoyed as a session beer."
"Fairly easy drinking with not too thick of a moutfeel but a nice tart finsih."
"drinkability - easy drinking, huge malt body detracts from IPA classification"
"Carbonation is fairly high and perhaps if allowed to die down a bit the beer would be more drinkable. As it is, with the dry, heavily bitter, spritzy nature it is only average to my palate."
"Picked up two singles on a whim. So glad I did. This one is a keeper. Orange with lacing in appearance. Smell/taste: citrusy/piny hops plus a big biscuity malt. I've not had an IPA with this much malt before, a nice surprise. I'll definitely try this again."
"I will for sure be picking a sixer of these sometime soon."
"D -I wouldn't complain if I had to drink this all night."
"Quite drinkable, some of the flavors can burn the tongue a bit but good."
"M/D: Great carbonation and a nice light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I thoroughly enjoyed this IPA and look forward to having another soon."
"d- multiple servings of this one could be handled with no problem. at a fair price point I would definitely consider grabbing a 6pk of this"
"For some reason, I didn't expect much out of this at all. I thought it would come closer to the 'suck' side of the spectrum, actually. It proved me completely wrong, and I can't think of a single reason not to buy this in the future, or to recommend it to you fine folks."
"D: Hoppy and tasty means it's quite drinkable. A solid offering from Avery, it's like a baby Maharaja. I'm surprised this isn't rated higher given the hop-head bias on the site, because this is definitely a great IPA."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, good example of the style,"
"Mouthfeel is full with carbonation but light with body thickness & malt. This is a great everyday IPA --- I think it is easily the match of other really good IPA like Stone IPA & Two-Hearted Ale, a bit less bitter than both but really full of flavor!"
"I would recommend giving this one a try if you want an IPA that wont put you out with more than one. Very drinkable and sessionable for an IPA"
"Perfect balance of hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with appropriate complimentary malt. I could drink this all day--if it wasn't $6.50 a glass."
"D: you can drink a bunch its a sessionable IPA that if your a big hop head you might find boring but still its a well crafted beer and you have to give its due. its good not great. make no mistake some beers these guys brew is great this aint one, but its good."
"Overall, a solid IPA. Didn't blow me away but I certainly wasn't disappointed by it either. Hit the spot I was looking for and I would have it again, though I don't expect I would seek it out specifically."
"drinks easy, but needs more hop flavor. i dont mind this here and there however it is not in my regular rotation. a bit more hop flavor would nudge out the strong malts."
"D - easy drinking. Nice IPA. Great flavor. Great blanace."
" glad I gave this one a second chance and I'm headed out for another 6er ASAP. Good Stuff."
"D: Very drinkable and sessionable IPA. Glad we can get this in AL now."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but take it slowly."
"very drinkable, nigh sessionable - could easily have 2-4 of these and still wake up in the morning. a solid ipa, but not a terribly exciting one."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thick and rich, very easy to drink if you're in the mood for a simple ipa."
"Notes: It sure is possible that this has been sitting at a beer graveyard for a bit long. If not this is a fair but a bit short IPA, which actually can be a gentle entry into the style, but does not feel very enticing as a US IPA."
"D - This is a very nice IPA. Looks great and smells even better, but it really shows its quality in the flavor. Pine hops dominate the first impression of the beer, but fade to a very nice, pithy grapefruit by the finish. There is a great deal of malt sweetness here, and this is really my only complaint. While the malt helps to balance out the strong hops, it is just a bit excessive and makes the hop character seems a little medicinal by the end of the bottle. I think a slightly dryer finish would probably allow the hops to shine even more and also make for a more drinkable beer."
"The beer is fairly drinkable, enough that I usually want two."
"Overall- me being a hop head for an american ipa to have this much malt going on they did a damn good job of it. the piney/ slightly citrus hops don't really dominate as most ipa's but this one really just joins hands with the malt and either of the two are left alone. i would highly recommend to any ipa fan to try this and especialy ones who aren't yet into the hop explosion category."
"D - Freshness is the key here; this seems to devolve rapidly after bottling. A fresh example, however, is delicious."
"Another nice beer from Avery, quickly becoming one on my favorites."
"Overall, not bad. Definitely a solid IPA but there are better ones out there."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't go back to this. It's a fairly standard piney IPA with a lot of hops and not much else to help it stand out."
"This was a nice and fairly well-balanced IPA. It poured bright cloudy orange with a little bit of white head. I loved the earthy pine nose and the taste was very earthy and piney as well...a slight bit of citrus/pine like a concolor fir. Medium-bodied, nice crisp finish. A good, solid IPA."
"D-this is not very good, too bitter for the flavors that are actually present, no carbonation at all. Syrupy and dry at the same time, it completely turns me off. I'm noping something happened to this bottle; but it looks fine and grabbed from a very good store"
"Tasty and light, this is a drinkable IPA for sure. The 6.3%ABV might get after you a bit if you drink too much, but it's certainly a good IPA that deserves to be consumed more than once in a sitting. Not the best IPA I've had, but it's miles ahead of others and a good representation of the style."
"The feel was very slick and left a dry chalky finish. The body was medium with mild yet sharp carbonation. Real good IPA."
"Overall, a simple enjoyable IPA. There really isn't anything special about this, but it's really good, something I wouldn't mind having around at all times. It's affordable, enjoyable and tastes great. A winner in my book."
"All-around a very good IPA. There's definitely hoppier out there, but this one's very well-balanced and even non-hopheads can enjoy more than one."
"D: Very easy drinking beer. I only grabbed a single but wish I grabbed an entire 6pack. This is a solid American IPA"
"Medium body with a smooth, creamy texture and fine carbonation. Citric hops up front with grapefruit standing out, followed by toasty malt, more hops with a decent bitterness, some pine and floral notes. Hints of tangerine and lemon, and something else - maybe faint pineapple.The finish includes grapefruit pith. Nice, solid IPA with plenty of hops - more hops than Stone IPA, maybe on a par with BJ's Piranha Pale Ale and Sierra Nevada Torpedo. Heavy foam sheeting on the glass."
"Very drinkable IPA. Nicely done. Shows a good IPA can be made without hammering the drinker over the head with hops."
"Got this at the saucer in Austin out of a cask. Pours with a golden color, nice fluffy head, and an opaque body. Smell was filled with hops, but wasn't nearly as much as I expected. Taste was also not near as hoppy as I expected, it was very smooth. This was my first beer from a cask, at the bar I got the explanation of what exactly that entails. I couldn't pinpoint exactly what differences there were. My guess is that the hoppiness of the beer was affected because the yeast was still fermentating, which is why it was so smooth."
"Cheers!"
"A clear pale golden color pour with a medium sized thick lasting foamy head , lots of jagged lacing left . Aroma of citrusy hops ,grapefruit some candy sugars and lightly toasted pale malts . Flavor is of resin and juicy citrus with a nice addition of the toasty malts , some sugary grapefruit and light pine notes , light to medium body , with a clean crisp mouthfeel , medium bitterness with a long finish , very drinkable and a very good IPA"
"D. Drinkable. Not a stand out but still, a solid sessionable IPA."
"D - A good first beer to start with from Avery. It's a good IPA in almost every regard. Straight forward but well balanced and refreshing. Would be a great summer or session beer."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Golden orange with decent white head that leaves some nice lacing. Fresh citrusy/piny hop notes. Bitter hops throughout with a bit of pineapple and grapefruit. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very refreshing. I could drink a bunch of these."
"Notes: I went into my local beer store and asked for an easy drinking IPA and I got what I asked for and more. This is now one of my favorite IPAs. Everything about it is awesome. I will need to try more of Avery's beers in the future."
"Overall this is a well-crafted American IPA from Avery and certainly one that I will revisit again. Noting earth-shattering, just a solid IPA. Recommended."
"Value: Not great."
"Expectations were high as it is an Avery IPA but once I tasted it - it fell very short of my expectation particularly after I compared it to other IPA's side by side."
"D: Great drinker, especially if one likes a light flavored, light bodied IPA. Would go great with a meal."
"D- Definitely a beer I could drink over and over no problem. Taste is brought out that much more when eaten with food. Up there as one of my favorites for just IPAs."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light. It goes down well and just seems pretty smooth. Is tab bit carbonated so it does have a slight fizz to it. Overall a really great IPA."
"Like I said, a solid drinking IPA that I would drink another of."
"This IPA has a light straw color, with a strong head and good lacing. The smell is defiantly hoppy but not over powering. The taste is defiantly very solid in the style, but some how seamed one dimensional to me, the mouth feel followed suite been good but not really note worthy. I would like to try another so it is drinkable. Good thing I have one more bottal."
"D - This is a solid IPA from Avery and a good IPA in general...this is a good one to keep around if it is readily available to you"
"overall, this was a very nice beer i enjoyed it"
"D - Extremely drinkable."
"Still looking for a can for my collection"
"Blind tasted this against Dogfish 60 Minute IPA, Racer 5 IPA, and Stone IPA to select my next keg. All from 6 packs. Avery IPA won for its balance of bitterness with citrus. A well-balanced beer. Racer 5 and Dogfish 60 both didn't do as well. Dogfish 60 surprisingly was too bitter--that was the dominant and only flavor. Racer 5 didn't have enough citrus to balance the bitter as well, but it was not as one-dimensional as Dogfish 60. I was surprised at Dogfish--maybe it was a bad 6 pack."
"I just love this IPA. The profile and progression just work really well for me personally. Simple and well done."
"At about 70 IBU's, this wonderfully dry IPA is light and crisp on the pallet. The color is golden. You can smell the hops. And as I said earlier, dry and crisp on the pallet. easy drinkability. To easy if you know what I mean. I recommend this Avery product to who ever is looking for this style of beverage."
"D: This is a well blended and highly drinkable IPA. I could sit with this one all night long."
"Had on tap at Flying Saucer Columbia, it went much better with pizza slice and definitely for hop lovers only. My friend thought it a bit bitter, but I think I will add this one to list of favorites."
"Very tasty but pleasingly palate destroying. This is the reason that Avery is highly regarded, even their year round beers are well down."
"D - Very good. An enjoyable IPA I would reach for again."
"Poured gently into a glass tumbler it produces a small, thin looking amber head that persists very well and leaves nice lacing. The color is amber. Grapefruit stands out in the aroma, and the taste is medium grapefruit hops. There is a medium maltiness with good carbonation that is kind to the mouth. This is a drinkable brew to which I'll be returning."
"Drinkability- This is a very deeply enjoyable flavored hoppy brew, its one because of the intense bitter finish i find it one you must sort of sip and flavor and not zoom through, to me where this excels again is in just how great the hop style avery puts out is, i absolutely love there unique hop flavor"
" Drinkability is good here also. Could make for an all night drinker. Every time I try this beer it seems to get better and better. Definitely a must for IPA lovers."
"Drink ability is good. Semi sessionable , not too bitter. Not the best Ipa I've had but still pretty good."
"First off, drinkability really high, I'm really feeling this beer. There is some slight sweetness in the front and a lot of nice citrus based hop bitterness in the back. A little light for an IPA, thin mouthfeel, but overall a great example. Definitely a repeat for me."
"Finish - A dry hoppy finish which is typical with a hint of the abv in there"
"Golden colored with off-white head. Interesting smell with pine and lemon peel coming through the nose. Some bitter citrus in the taste with a balanced malt backing. Enough hops to quench this hop heads palate and a nice thick mouthfeel. Finish lingers on the palate."
"Bittering and flavoring hops both are pretty prevalent in the taste of the beer. The lightness of the malt is refreshing and makes the beer feel weightless in the mouth and slides down the throat with ease. This is a fine brew and I find myself surprised that it has been around awhile and can hang with some of the bigger, west coast IPAs with ease."
"this is a very light/clear looking IPA it pours a golden pils like color with a white 1/2 head( i like my ipa,s a little darker/oranger)..the smell is pine and citrus malt,bready/biscuit smells and some hop smells but all were faint however...the taste is the same its crisp and has a piney biscuit/bread taste with a malt backbone but its faint..its a little bitter but easy to drink its pretty well balanced for what it is ..it just doesnt have enough of the traits of an IPA for me to rate this very high..i can drink a few of these no problem but their are so many more to reach for ..ill recommend trying but nothing great going on here"
"M/D Not much to have a description about here, just scores."
"Pours cloudy yellow with a thick foamy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell isn't very evident with my lack of a good nose. Taste isn't bad, but isn't very strong of any specific flavor. It's well balanced, and doesn't leave any bitter aftertaste. Which equals to a high drinkability for me. The mouthfeel is also good."
"Well...it hit up front with a big hop bitterness that carries with it a sweet malt taste. The hops a flowery without being overbearing about it, but until it warms, I guess that's all I'm going to get. I will say that the balance on this is nice, with just the right amount of hops and a solid sweet malt base. The mouth feel is good and a bit sticky, trailing behind on the tongue a little bit. Overall this is a good aIPA, not the best but very drinkable and all around tasty."
"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. The color is a slightly cloudy dark blond...kind of a light shade for an IPA. I'm used them a little more orangey. Thin head that fades fast, leaving a thinner layer of bubbly on top. A few areas of lace. The first thing I smell is lemons, which is good because I like lemons. Nice hop presence in the nose as well. The taste...wow...very bitter...almost like chewing on a lemon rind. The lemony bitterness dominates the hops that are trying to come though. It almost makes me want to grind my teeth. The taste needs more hops and better balance. It's a medium mouthfeel that goes down easy, aside from the bitter aftertaste. I'll finish the six pack but can't see myself buying this again, though I'd drink it if it were there."
"Overall, a good AIPA and another solid effort from Avery as usual. Recommend. Rotation: I like the flavor but as stated above I prefer a less aggressive bitter hop in my AIPA so this wouldn't make the normal rotation for 6 packs. Would have on-tap during my Colorado trips especially when visiting Avery's tasting room."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is very high. There's nothing bad about this, but it could be a little better. You could drink this all day. Its very agreeable, goes down smooth, very refreshing."
"Drinkability is good. Well balanced that finishes with a mild lingering bitterness. Low sweetness and no signs of ABV."
"In a fresh sample, the biscuity malt and the citrusy hops interplay well leaving a well balanced beer with a strong honey-like floral qualities that melds well with fruity hops and bready malts. I updated my ratings to reflect new observations."
"Poured from a bottle into an American pint glass. Hazy golden hue, with obvious evidence of carbonation. Very thin head which didn't lace very well. The smell was very dull, with an ever-so-subtle hint of citrus; orange in particular.The flavor was identical to the nose, except that the finish was bitter and very dry. The carbo feel was nice on the palate, but the dryness was near unbearable. Given the uninspiring nature of this beer, I wouldn't want more than one."
"as concerns the mouthfeel, it is overly-carbonated, as previously mentioned. the drinkability is surprisingly low for an ipa, because it is just that dull."
"Notes- this would be a solid session ipa save the strange and nasty nose."
"An ok American IPA, its balance skewed to the bitter/dry side of the coin."
"D-Really nice American IPA. Could maybe afford a little more malt character but overall a good beer."
"Overall I haven't had the regular IPA so I can't compare, however if it's anything like the beer I had they're both worth a shot."
"Drinkability: very poor; while the hops finish is quite nice, the lack of body and presence on the entry is simply unforgivable. Perhaps something was wrong with the tap at the pub, but if not, a seriously imbalanced drink."
"The smell is of hops and light citrus. The taste is light on booze even though its 6.3%. Good and bitter with a malt finish. A good IPA."
"Had it on tap about a year ago and really enjoyed it, but decided to review this one from the bottle. Poured into a standard pint glass, comes out a very light amber color. Has some decent clarity with a very slight haze. White head that went away fairly quickly, with a little lacing to the glass. Smell is very good, smell of hops, strong citrus, and a slight floral aroma as well. Taste is very good much like the smell, hops and citrus, mostly a grapefruit. Mouthfeel is good and clean with a slight bite from the citrus. Drinkability is good as well. A very solid IPA, I got it at a bar but would definitely get some for the house."
"Drink ability - Had to eat something with this to finish. Did not enjoy this by it self."
"This is another standard beer coming from a brewery that offers so many extreme brands. I had this the other day and liked it but didn't find it good enough to get over some of my other favorites. At 6.3 it's a little hot. Color and carbonation is good, taste is ok and drinkability is acceptable."
"Drinkability - Pretty average drinkability for a beer of its style."
"drinkability is good - this is a clean ipa that went down very fast - reminds me of SN topedo & Mojo"
"A decent IPA. Nothing special, but enjoyable. Not overly bitter like many beers of the style. Worth a try weather you like IPA's or not."
"Creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish. I could drink more than a few of these. Had this beer with a handful of Tamari almonds."
"In the mouth, the malt sticks around all over the tongue; thick and creamy and hella nice. It's a very nice, woody, pale IPA."
"Good and hoppy without being over the top."
"I loved the map on the label. I tried this beer on June 18, 2009 at 'The Beer Bistro' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy orange-gold with a rocky white head. The aroma was malt, hops, and pine. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was crisp, some malt, and a bitter grapefruit. Enjoyable."
"I had to drink this straight out of the bottle, I know that is terrible, but it happens sometime. That being said I can't comment on the appearance to much. The hop aroma coming out of the bottle was great, strong and full but not to spicy. The excellent hopiness continued into the taste but not with the same force as the aroma. Light malty flavors up front with a long smooth bitter aftertaste. It is bubbly and light on the tongue. Not a very complex IPA but a very drinkable one and I can say it is great out of the bottle on a hot day. Ill pick this up again."
"D: I could drink these all day; a nice light, but not too light, IPA -- with some good body to it as well! As others have commented, there's really not much to complain about with this beer -- it's a great IPA, all around! I'll definitely be drinking more of it!"
"Although this is a tasty, distinct and well-balanced IPA, it does have that rich, thick taste that reminded me of a Sam Adams Lager. It might be little too heavy for summertime chugging, but it is definitely a good way to start the evening."
"Avery I.P.A poured a golden crisp color; it had moderate foam: head was about an inch. It smelt moderately of grassy pine tasting hops. The carbonation is not over the top or overly flat; it has perfect carbonation for an American style IPA. The taste remained loyal to the smell; it was crisp and refreshing. This I.P.A had very mild malty bite, which allowed the flavors of the hops to be showcased. There was a slight citrus sourness followed by a moderate bite of hops. This belongs like Stone IPA in the ranks of America's best I.P.A's. I cannot find anything really to complain about, concerning the beer. This is an American IPA which does not try to be a double or imperial IPA; it is simply a simple nearly flawless IPA."
"D: overall a great ipa when you want it to be a session beer grab a six pack you'll be glad you did"
"Orange and cream colored body with a nice whipped eggshell head that leaves rings of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is nice and full with tons of centennial hops, lemon zest and faint toasted grain. The taste is nice pink grapefruit rind hops and peppery spice with just enough rich maltiness to balance perfectly. The feel is relatively light with a nice effervescent, seltzery carbonation that makes it a real treat to drink. A really good IPA doesn't need to be over the top on the hop end of the spectrum to be really good, and that is what we have here, a well made beer that hits the spot with a nearly perfect balance of flavors. A really refreshing ale."
"I really like this IPA. Nice golden color with a fluffy white head. Good lacing down the glass. Big hop aroma from this beer, mainly floral with hints of citrus. Flavor is big time floral hoppy with some malt sweetness. Nice smooth mouthfeel not too light and not heavy at all, seems just right for the style. Very easy to drink a few of these."
"This one was an interesting brew. The Smell is a bit citrus-like. The brew has a strong taste of hops. Color is goldenrod with a thick head on top. Has a crisp medium mouthfeel with a medium body. Overall it is a rather drinkable beer which would acompany a fish dinner nicely."
"D- I found these pretty easy to drink and enjoyable with a potent hop punch"
"Drinkability: This is quite drinkable in its way and is nice as a changeup beer, but is not something I'd have more than one of in an evening. Rather this is a beer to have with pizza or some other meal. However, I like it well enough that I will be returning to this one again. But be prepared, the continuing intense bitterness is both tasty and almost a bit overwhelming in its ongoing, unrelieved harshness."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a finger of white creamy head that dissolves into a fine layer around the glass. The Aroma has piney/grassy hops and some grapefruit. The flavor has a biting piney bitterness upfront with caramel malt down the stretch and ends up with a sweet bitterness. Its a medium bodied beer that a lightly carbonated. Its a nice change of pace from the typical NW citrus hop bombs but that doesn't mean I'd reach for it every time I saw it."
"J"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with clumpy offwhite head. Smell: feeling let down here, sweet caramel with whiffs of earthy and floral hops, ever so slight pine and candied citrus. Taste: lots of hops, floral, earthy, white grapefruit, medicinal in the finish. Sweet biscuity, caramel malt flavors in the background. This is almost really good, I'm thinking a little bit fresher might push it over the top. Will revisit."
"D - Overall, quite drinkable and refreshing. Pretty nice hop profile and not too sweet. I could definitely see myself drinking this one again."
"Dad brought a six-pack of these over during the move. Pours an amber color with a decent head. Smell is slightly citrusy and hoppy. Taste is hoppy, citrusy, bready and only slightly alcoholic. Moderate carbonation in the mouth. Very good drinkability and a solid IPA."
"D: A very nice IPA - not an overloaded hop bomb, but still quite robust in its own right. A nice interplay of hop flavors and an appealing mouthfeel make this a very tasty beer from Avery."
"I have no qualms with painfully bitter hop bombs, but without balance the beer suffers and becomes bland and boring."
"D: not a bad brew, I will reach for other IPA's next time. However, I will keep Avery IPA within reach. This one is a straight shooter"
" Drinkability is phenomenal. An IPA for the ages. Who says IPAs have to be balanced to be great? Buy as many as you can drink. A wonderful beer, maybe a new staple in my fridge."
"Golden color, poured in the yeasty bits so a bit cloudy at first. Bubbly, about 1/2 inch of white, foamy head. Citrusy, smells like the woods...piney. Taste is citrusy, bitter, dry. Leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Light mouthfeel, very drinkable. Not as fruity as I like my IPAs but overall, pretty good, will definitely drink again."
"Balanced but leaning to the hops, this is an exceptionally drinkable ale. Not exceptionally interesting, but very, very solid."
"Very Pale amber color with white pillowy head. This beer has great head retention. Smells of citrus with slight whiffs of malt underneath as well as piney notes. Taste is very well balanced. Citrusy and piney Pacific Northwest hops mingle with just enough malt and a nice amount of alcoholic warmth. Seems to have some toasty undertones as well. Very smooth for an American IPA with a subtle dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fuller than I expected, yet still wonderfully drinkable."
"very good beer. definitely worth trying if you like IPAs."
"The foam was light yellow wheat, smooth, puffy and lacey. The color was simply gold. The smell was of a wheaty aroma, fruity, hopy and bitter. The taste was very bitter with a hippy overtone and a small fruity undertone. Mouthfeel - heavy bitterness, light to medium-bodied. Drinkability - the bitterness was too dominate to taste the other ingredients."
"Pours an unusually cloudy pale orange color with a one finger large bubbly head. A ton of carbonation, lets off an exceptional citrus forward sweetness that I really enjoy. Surprisingly malty with a caramel toffee front and a really good, lightly bitter, bubbly hop infused finish. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and noticeably coating. Drinkability is off the charts, not the slightest alcohol bite and nowhere near overly hoppy. Hop heads may not agree but this is a very enjoyable IPA."
"D = Very drinkable. The hops don't weigh on you after one or two making this a great session IPA. Avery got this one right."
"Cracked a 12'r after a bunch of yard work. This IPA pours more like a pale ale than an IPA - a bit on the yellow side. Head is about a finger thick in my pils glass and it leave a bit of stringy lacing as it recedes. Taste is good, malts a re bit more present that I prefer, but the acidic and somewhat grapefruit-like hop aromas and bitter background do temper the malts. There are some other earlthy/grassy flavors going on also. Nose could be a bit more aromatic, but then again, I've been off calibration from all the hopped up imperial IPA I've consumed. This is a really easy drinking IPA, has a great mouth feel and a good reward for a hard days work."
"Not a bad IPA, I've had better and I've had worse."
"A very nice beer overall"
"It seems like this brew has all the right elements, but not the right execution of them. It has balance, it has character, and it has the right ingredients, but the real punch seems to be missing, which is pretty crucial to any IPA, even for non hopheads."
"Drink: A good IPA. Something to be savored and not consumed by quantity, but not many IPAs are. Gets better as it warms up."
"Pours gold with a white head. Smell is citrus/hops/grapefruit Taste is good, better then others, but nothing too special. Citrus, hops, and floral on the palate. Mouthfeel is lighter but exactly what to exect from an IPA. I would drink this beer again, and will do so!"
"This struck me as a run of the mill, quality IPA. It's definitely a good beer, but it didn't have any extraordinary qualities. It's a nice looking beer, slightly hazy, golden hue. The smell is pretty exactly what you'd expect from an IPA, Citric, piny hops with a malt undertone. Taste is the same. Very nice hoppy tartness with a bitter element on the finish. Enjoyable."
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. It has a good amount of hops and bitterness, enough for a hophead to enjoy. Still, it isn't overwhelming and I could easily down a few of these. A very enjoyable brew."
"On cask. A dark, slightly hazy gold with a white head. Smells very hoppy, though more herbal and floral than bitter. The aromas are actually almost spot-on pot. More malt comes out in the taste, though the herbal hoppiness is still dominant. Surprisingly well balanced and not overly bitter. Pretty standard cask ale body. Nice IPA."
"D - An enjoyable IPA that is worth having again."
"The taste is a bit drying, and doesn't have as much oily and estery juices from the hop as I would have liked. There is a leafy hop texture to the beer, it isn't as piney or grapefruit acerbic in character, but there is a nice balance with the bready malts. This is a well balanced beer with substance and texture. The medium bodiedness, the creamy biscuity malts, and the dry hop leaf really complement each other. I wish this had a touch more oily hop, but this is a really good IPA nonetheless. The mouthfeel is a tad drying and palate cleansing, the after taste is slight. The 6.3% ABV is not even noticeable. A worthy beer worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Funnily enough I just finished the best IPA from BC I have ever had (central city Red Racer IPA) and so I was kinda let down by this one(considering Averys rep). Poured fairly dark with a nose that suggested hops but was not over the top. The beer was not really that hoppy but once it warmed up and I considered the nice balance and the hops it did use I realized this was a drinking IPA that does not tear your face off with IBUs but rather lets the hops speak at their own pace. Nice beer but I did expect more hops"
"D: Not bad, pretty tasty IPA, would pick up a six pack of this if I found it in my area again."
"Enjoy"
"Maybe a tad too astringent due to the grapefruit bitterness, but it's still a real good IPA. There's a nice creaminess to the beer that makes it easy drinking."
"I love beers from Avery. This one is no exception. Nice citrus smell. Smooth and easy to drink with lots of grapefruit in the taste, and nice lingering bitter after taste. I love this easy to drink American IPA . Also a great session IPA. I think I'll have another."
"Pours a clear orange. Decent finger-width head on top. Excellent lacing rings with each sip. Smells of grapefruit and flowers. Nice citrus pop. Flavor is bitter, but pretty average. Nothing spectacular here. Mouthfeel is decent. Crisp, yet smooth. Not bad."
"Drinkability i'snt bad, tastes is a bit one dimensional easy to drink as it does not demand much from you but."
"A pretty solid version of the style. Not spectacular, but a good choice for an everyday ipa."
"From Bottle into Tulip. Poured hazy golden yellow with medium head which mostly diminishes but lingers with the lacing. Aroma of citrus, pine. Hoppy taste and to me quite dry and bitter, especially in the finish. But that is what they tell you to expect. Overal a good, well above-average American IPA - and a map to boot - Cheers!"
"This beer is totally rewarding with every sip and very true to style. If you're an American IPA lover you owe this one a try."
"This is a awesome IPA. Showed up with a big fluffy white head and coated the glass completely as I drank. Solid IPA characteristics throughout. Citrus and hops. I've never had a cask beer before, but I felt the beer was a little too flat and a little too warm for me to give it an outstanding mouthfeel rating. However, I really enjoyed it and will enjoy more in the future."
"Fairly large off-white head on top of a hazy dark yellow/light orange body. Good head retention. The aroma is very sweet and citric. Bit of a piney taste. Overall it's a very solid example of the style."
"D- Enjoyable IPA. Nothing over the top."
"Pours a light amber orange body, creamy white head somewhat lasting. hoppy grapefruit citrus taste. very bitter. green tasting. very harsh. drying taste. Sweet grapefruity taste. Grapefruity dry aroma, bitter. less harsh tasting as it warms, more palatable."
"This is a drinkable IPA--good hop finish with a bite."
"D: It has a bitter aftertaste and is pretty palette-killing. Probably would be a waste to have more than one."
"D: Quaffable, a good IPA."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. No bottled on/expires on date on the bottle but bought from busy beer store so I assume it's fresh. Pours a golden straw color with a half finger of white head. Lacing sticks all over the sides of the glass. Smell is floral and citrus hops, like oranges and grapefruit. Taste is citrus hops up front but die down quickly to light dry biscuit malts. Taste leaves the tongue quickly and makes me want another drink. Light dry mouthfeel that lightly parches the tongue. Good drinkabilty, I could drink this beer all day long. Not my first choice for an IPA but a solid offering from Avery that I will likely drink again."
"All I can say after drinking this is Wow! Really like what Avery has accomplished here with their IPA. I poured it into my tulip glass and a sturdy, thick light tan head formed above the dark orange brew. I have a weak nose, but not picking up much in the aroma catagory. Maybe a little of the hops goodness. How to describe the taste? The malt seems to have a slight caramel sweetness to it. The hops has this almost tobacco-like, leafy, herbal grassy quality. Maybe a little grapefruit peel in there as well. Liked the balance between the malt and the hops, with more malt than you'll find in most IPA's. Decent amount of malt gives it a slightly creamy mouth feel and it's a very smooth brew for all that's going on here. Look foreward to my next one."
"Overall, it is not the creme of the crop of IPAs but it is up there and a very nice offering."
"Drinkable, satisfying...give me another pint, please."
"Overall, a nice, simple IPA and I could easily drink a few of them."
"All in all I think this is one of the best I.P.A.'s I have ever head. And I dont think its a style that you would slam all night. Drinkability is average for me. I love I.P.A.'S but one of this calibur, I would do two maximum in a night. The strong hops, no matter how good just gets old one right after another. I would sit back and savor this one"
"Pours a pretty clear yellow/orange color.. nice head that stays consistent all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nice lacing too. Smell is very hoppy (moreso than most IPA's). Taste is very good.... balanced and bitter, but not too strong. One of the better IPAs I've had.. if this beer wasn't too pricey I'd have it a lot more often.. but alas it is, and I can get comprable IPA sixers for 4-5 dolalrs less."
"Lingering aftertaste has a bit of a sourness that wasn't the greatest, perhaps just unexpected. The aftertaste doesn't distract from the entire beer though and it is still a pretty decent IPA. Don't know if I'd recommend it to someone for their first IPA but it's a good beer."
"A murky golden color in the glass. This leaves plenty of lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is bittering hops. Taste is absolutely wonderful! Wonderful bitter hop taste. Plenty of juicy hop flavor and bitterness to balance it out. This is a very well done IPA. Among the best. Crisp and refreshing, definitely won't be the last that I have."
"overall: and okay IPA. Not worth the money, there are much better IPA's out there."
"I have had this beer a few times, but recently I had it on tap for the first time. This was the best I have found yet, but I am still not a huge fan of this beer. I think an average IPA (which is fine) is about right. But the aroma is what sticks out the most as this thing smells fantastic, with citrus and piney hops coming through. The taste comes through as mostly base malt, and not much else to round it out. Comes out pretty dry to me and as drinkable as it is, I just don't seek this one out often."
"On tap. Very nice, color. head, retains it to the end. My 1st go and not disappointed at all. Citrus, bitter, nicely balanced, hops a plenty, but not a hop bomb. One very well made IPA and will satisfy most everyone who likes a hoppy IPA with some balance to it. Definitely a first choice at the establishment I had it at today."
"Nikki"
"Good beer, questionable drinkability. Lots of different flavors, including some fruits and bread, and a lot of hop bitterness. Definitely worth drinking, but doesn't stand out."
"Pours somewhere in between yellow and amber and produced a massive head. Very strong hop smell with some malt. Malt actually hit me first, then I was quickly assaulted with a rush of hops that dominated the beer to the finish. The hop taste stays in the mouth well after the brew is gone. Definitely an IPA here. Carbonation is present, but not excessive. Drinkability is not the highest, like most other IPA's."
"Easy to enjoy. Bold flavor and tasty. Not a session beer but something to return to."
"D - I would drink one or a few more. Would I go out of my way to pick it up? No, but I wouldn't mind having again."
"Notes: No me gusta. It is too much of a one note beer."
"D: Fine, quite sessionable."
"Drink: A pretty good drink. Goes down pretty smooth."
"D: A must session beer for the hop lovers. This beer can hold its own!"
"M + D: Carbonation is a little soft, body feels a little weighty and muddy. Not a better part of the beer. As for drinkability, it is doable and certainly not a horrible beer - not a favourite, though."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable; while not much stands out about this particular IPA, would definitely have again. Can have a few without sacrificing sobriety."
"Not among the very top brews in it's category, but if you like IPAs this one is certainly worth a try."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love a good IPA and enjoy bitterness. That being said, I would not seek this beer to buy again. I find that it is fairly one dimension with the hop bitterness and the aroma complexity does not follow through in the taste. I think the lingering bitterness would be a put off to most people who don't enjoy that aspect of IPA's. It's also a turn off for people, like myself, who enjoy bitterness, but like some other flavors to go along with it."
"What a great IPA, the hops really shine through on this one with both the aroma and flavor. I would love to try this one freshly tapped. A superb example of the style up there with the best of them."
"D: A nicely hopped ipa that was very drinkable with sweet caramel and moderate alcohol making for a big experience."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a shaker. This IPA poured a golden amber with a light haze and a thin, lasting off-white head. Heavy, even rings of lace coated the glass. The aroma included pungent grapefruit, tropical fruits, a touch of white pepper, and small amount of caramel. The flavor consisted of grapefruit juice, spicy hops, and a trace of caramel malt. Quite bitter on the tongue, but still very drinkable. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied and had light carbonation. A well made, quaffable IPA. Not to shabby."
"Drinkability: A very refreshing IPA with bitter hops abound. No characteristic of this beer is overwhelming or over bearing, and at the same time nothing is overly complex. In terms of Avery's IPA, Simplicity is Golden."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"On top at the Pearl Street Pub. Pours a darker orange with an off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Smells mainly piney and hoppy, very much like columbus hops, and slightly citrusy. Tastes of columbus hops mostly, very piney, no lingering bitter effect. A solid IPA that's always drinkable."
"For an American IPA this one I will grab for again and again. Thank you Avery! The Lord bless the hop harvest."
"D - Alcohol is well hidden in the palate but definitely there. A pleasant sipping IPA."
"O- Taste is well rounded enough to enjoy a couple of them but at 6.3%, it's not quite a session beer either. Good hop flavor though and enjoyable."
"This is a solid ipa, nice and hoppy. A great representation of the style. I would recommend this one."
"very enjoyable, I wish it was more readily avail a, and I wish I could find it in small bottles more easily ( I dont think they sell it at my usually single beer place)"
"Has an astringent bitter mouth feel. The finish last a minute or two and is very refreshing."
"Good solid IPA here, if somewhat average. Lacking the extra something that makes a great IPA, but I would have another. A good balance of taste and drinkability."
"Okay, much better after the Redpoint. Golden pour with good carbonation and a big white head. Hops abound in the nose, grapefruit, orange, pine, but without resin. Smooth, yet bitter, taste with more pine and grapefruit. Some grassiness and malt in the finish. A true IPA that isn't an Imperial with the wrong label. Excellent beer."
"D - While the cask servings I've had are better than the regular on-tap serving its still a good IPA thats easy drinking worth a try"
"Pours a light, slightly cloudy golden color with a nice thick foamy off-white head that settles into a nice lacing. Has a slight hoppy aroma with hints of pine and citrus fruit. Medium bodied with a dry hoppy finish. Not as bitter or hoppy as I had hoped."
"Overall, Avery has a very solid IPA that I would most definitely buy again."
"The 6 pack is cheaper than most of the other beers in its class but it is by no means a cheaper tasting beer! I give it a thumbs up."
" ~ In my opinion this beer is drinkable if only for its taste. The look and aroma are just added features. However, the feel brings this IPA back down to size. I guess I'm saying its average on a drinkability scale but if the texture were at least average. I think we'd have a real solid choice."
"Pours a semi transparent gold with a three fingers tall head of dense foam that retains as long as any I've seen. Lots of lacing circles my pint glass,huge lacy curtains. The nose is fresh,lemony and sweet with citrus notes. Light biscuit notes are humbled by bold citrusy hops,subtle lemon and earthy greenery. The body is medium and near perfect carbonation is soft and creamy. A good amount of bitterness keeps things on track without being overwhelming or too aggressive. A very drinkable IPA with just the right amount of flavor and balance."
"D: At 6.3%, it's still a rather drinkable IPA. I would seek it out again."
"Even though IPA's are my style I enjoyed this one more than most. The aroma is strong with hop smells that include flowers as well as cedar and citrus. Some sweet malt smells as well. It is a dark golden color that is slightly hazy. The flavor is bitter as expected but does have a nice malt component as well. Finish is nice with toasted malt and hops."
"I was looking forward to a hoppy, American interpretation of an IPA. Perhaps I got an old bottle - this one may not have survived that long trip from England around Africa to India. I believe it has become malt heavy. It is very light for a 6.3 % ABV but not very sessionable."
"Ever so sippable, it seems like the cask version only amplifies the hops. Recommended."
"Notes from 5/27/04"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a good white head that stays until the end and laces nicely. Smells of big spiced hops. Taste the same, a very generic IPA to me, a slight sweetness on the end, but there is that initial hop bite. It would smooth out, but very typical nothing special here. Mouthfeel was ok and same with drinkability."
"The drinkability is there for sure. I could have several and might look for this again."
"poured 12 oz. bottle into pint glass nice golden color, very active carbanation, 1 1/2 finger white head, fair lacing. Not as hoppy smelling as I was expecting, some citrus. taste about the same as smells tangy finish, good fizzy mouthfeel that lasts a while. faily good drinkability, will drink again."
"D: A nice, safe IPA. I would happily drink this again."
"D - I'm giving it a 3.5 on drinkability because it's not a horrible beer to drink and is easy to swallow. It doesn't taste bad either, but is really missing my preferred hoppiness and also missing any distinct flavor. The flavor is very muttled together. Not a horrible beer, and would try it again in case I got a batch that doesn't fully represent it, but not my favorite either."
"This is something of an anomaly in that it appreciates a solid malt backbone but still brings an army of light breaking, citrus tinged hops. Terrific balance here and the mouthfeel holds every drop, with a chewy, stout like finish. Original, and delicious, this one is easy to drink and lots of fun to do so. Citrus and pine are plentiful but the malt hangs tough enough. Not for amateurs, but this is highly drinkable and worth a try."
"D, notes: A good serviceable go to IPA. Well balanced and highly sessionable."
"This is a very well balanced well rounded IPA. A very drinkable session IPA, with a nice floral and citrus presence. Nothing that will knock your socks offs, but at the time it was the only IPA the Diamond had on tap at the time, and figured id give it a try. Ale to Chief or Maharaja ill take over this one. Paired well with some soft irish cheddar"
"Pours a clear gold body with a two-finger head that quickly receeds and leaves lace patches. An earthy, strong and pungent (not in a bad way) hop smell, with citric fruits dominating and some dark fruits behing. Medium-bodied, this packs a hop punch over the taste buds but retains a smoothness to it even as it finshes dry. Some malty goodness in there, even though it is faint. Just a great IPA all around."
"Poured from 12 oz. Bottle to pint glass a coppery honey color with a minimal white head that reduced to a solid sheen that remained with heavy lacing. Smelled like grapefruit and hops with a mild hint of grass. Tastes fantastic. Citrus hops dominate the taste with just enough malt to coumter the bitterness. Very well balanced IPA with a medium feel and perfect carbonation. Has the solid flavor of an Imperial without the high APV. This is a very drinkable beer and I will be adding to my list of regular purchases."
"D - This is very drinkable because of it's balance."
"overall a great selection, avery does not disappoint."
"First bitterness, then a lovely sweetness that doesnt overbear, but only mellows the hops, and not in a bad way. Very bold flavors. Esters make their appearance. More full bodied than the appearance led on. Dry aftertaste that lasts. Almost 'sticky' in your mouth. I recommend trying this."
"Nice golden copper color with a white head of medium sized bubbles. Smells fruity and slightly earthy with definite pronounced hops. Tastes sweet with fruit like peaches, with a piney hop bitterness. It gets thicker and more syrupy on the tongue as it warms. This is a solid IPA! It's slightly metallic and harsh until it warms, so don't drink it straight out of a cold fridge."
"The nose on the beer is really floral hops with hints of pilsner type malts. The beer has a good finger head. The beer has a bit of carbonation and okay retention. It's a light copper colour. The beer is bitter and malty, but it has a nice floral hop taste to it. To expand a bit more on the flavour, the beer has a unique hop character that is pretty strong, but behind it is the malts, which almost give a nice toasty flavour to the beer. Extremely tasty IPA. The taste has a great balance between the three elements. A creamy feel on the mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable."
"D - Like I said, I love this IPA. It's a great example of what the style should be (according to me). It's an IPA and isn't trying to be anything else. I could easily turn this beer into a session beer."
"Yellow light-amber color. Brilliantly clear. Bold head. Nice retention and lacing down the glass. A very hoppy aroma of pine and grapefruit. Taste is hop-heavy and enjoyably bitter. Malt character is light, which is much appreciated. No complaints about mouthfeel. Here is one IPA that I will hold on to and continue to drink in the future. Really cool label showing the shipping routes from England to India. This is a great brew from Avery."
"mid body. good carbonation. pretty good aipa. i may buy this again. could drink more than a few."
"Excellent drinkability. Very nice brew."
"Poured orange and gold, like honey, slightly cloudy, slim light head; clingage on the glass. Smell of corn bread and grains mostly. Nice flavor, bread-like initially then some kick of hops, and grapefruit. The finish is somewhat dry. Overall, nice IPA, very refreshing and easy to drink. It reminds me more of a Pale Ale. Good Brew! Good Brewery!"
"Drinkability - not my favorite IPA but it went well with Trotta's pizza."
"Note: Take two, different keg, different day(Sept 09, 2008). Beer is flawed, unimpressive and rather weak. Comments above remain unchanged and will remain so until and unless a third occasion dictates otherwise."
"Golden colored with perhaps a hint of orange in there with a nice foamy head. Nice pine needle, citrus hop aroma. Bitter piney hop flavor with a touch of light malt that balances it nicely. Flavor seemed rather tame and easy drinking for the style. Smooth and actually pretty refreshing. This a solid IPA I'd have no problem going back to. In a taste test, not quite as good as the Clipper City Loose Cannon IPA."
"Another nice offering from Avery. Could see enjoying one of these every once in a while"
"Don't drink and review."
"This is my third Avery beer and their beers really seem to be hit or miss."
"Pours a surprisingly pale yellow color with a tint of orange. I took a quit swig of this before pouring and thought I was dealing with a deep orange amber color. Aroma is very nice. Rich caramel and malt aroma melds the smell with the taste so well. Flavor is rich, layer cake, tangy and floral hops. Slightly astringent in the finish lessens the enjoyability of this beer a bit. Somewhat disappointing there."
"One of my all time favorite IPAs and a beer I buy frequently."
"Of course, the head lived on throughout the quaff. What a beer, very smooth with a well-balanced body. I'll be seeking this one again."
"D: Pretty standard in my opinion, but there's nothing really wrong with it - good if you like a spicy, bitter-style IPA, but it just wasn't that outstanding in my book. Not bad though, and worth trying at least once."
"Crisp, classic IPA feel in the mouthfeel, and pretty easy to drink."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. While it's not exactly my favorite example of an IPA, it's still solidly made."
"Clear golden color with a nice white head that sticks around. Great aroma of piney hops, citrus, and grapefruit. Excellent hop flavor. I don't know what kinds of hops are used in this (Cascade, I guess), but they add a nice spiciness and a very pleasant bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little oily, with the perfect amount of carbonation. I'm a huge fan of IPAs, and this is just how I like them. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs.; very refreshing and highly drinkable. Definitely a great choice for any hophead."
"D: This brew is drinkable but I do believe that there are better IPA options out there. A slight disappointment as I did enjoy the Avery Maharaja."
"Mouthfeel was also decently thick."
"D: Good."
"This poured a clear light straw color with white head. It smelled like pine hops with a bit of citrus. It tasted like a blend of sweet citrus hops and bitter pine hops, with some honey malt as well. It was oily with no carbonation, and had a clean mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean beer with refined flavor. A very good IPA that would translate amazingly into an imperial IPA."
"Drinkability - This is my favorite standard IPA, slightly edging out Odell's. I could (and do on occasion) drink this all night long."
"Poured a lovely golden amber color with an inch worth of foam and nice lacing down the glass. I get some sweet caramel malt in the nose backed up by a big dose of citrusy piney hops. Taste is the same but reversed. Hop bitterness hits the tongue first, and then is smoothed out by the sweet malt. Nicely balanced and quite drinkable."
"Good job Avery, nice brew."
"Overall, a very drinkable IPA. Easy to drink. Sessionable."
"It's been a while since I've had the chance to enjoy some fresh American IPAs, and this is another winner. Cleaner, drier, and hoppier than anything avaiable north of the border. I know these types of beers are available in abundance down there, but you should really count yourselves lucky."
"D: A nice package in my first Avery offering. A solid IPA with a more earthy aroma and flavor profile."
"D - I could easily spend a night on this one. This is a re-review and I enjoyed this round much better than the last. Avery is starting to win me over."
"The mouthfeel makes this beer very drinkable. The bitterness is not overly intense, but bitter enough to be enjoyed by those who like hops but don't like it to beat their taste buds into submission."
"D = This is a hops forward American style IPA all the way and is easily enjoyable if your are in the mood for a good strong, assertive but not over the top IPA."
"This is an excellent IPA from Avery. I've passed this one up over and over again in favor of seasonals and such. This teaches me to start picking up more of the year round offerings instead of passing them by. Thanks again for a quality IPA Russ."
"Drinkability: This is a good IPA but not necessarily a great one. I'd take it above a lot of other beers of the style, but it's not a scratch on Sweetwater or Bridgeport, my two faves of that type."
"The other times I have had this beer it seemed overly sweet, this batch maybe was fresher and had a lot of perfectly bitter hop juiciness. A well crafted AIPA that is great as a session or go to IPA."
"M&D: Light to medium body. The light to moderate carbonation makes for a smooth mouthfeel. The bitter finish lingers a bit too long, nonetheless, this is on par for the style, nothing outstanding, but good. Skal."
"Overall Impression - Very drinkable beer. Nice hop presence through out. The bitterness doesn't ""kill"" your palate in the way many IPA's do. Great example of an IPA"
"All that combined with a pleasant mouthfeel makes for quite a drinkable brew."
"Smell is almost good. Piney hops are forefront and make this pleasant and floral. I just wish there was a little more to the aroma. Taste is a definition of American IPA. Nothing mememorable about it, but you would not be dissapointed by enjoying this one. Get this when you want to show people what an IPA is and you won't be let down. If you are a hop head looking for your next fix, this will do as well."
"D- Easy drinking IPA, surprised at the 6.3%. Nice example of the style, but nothing complex."
"O/ M - Strong aromas, fruity flavors. Light to med mouthfeel. Very bitter finish."
"M/D - Medium bodied and well carbonated. The aftertaste limits the drinkability though."
"pours a straw yellow from a 12oz bottle to a standard pint glass. dissipating to a half finger head with good lacing. smell is citrus and floral with a hint of sweet malt underlying. smells hoppy enough to be an IPA. taste is massive floral hop assault with a citrus tone good carbonation and a light body. mouth feel is just what you want it to be as an IPA. a very good IPA, it could use a tiny bit more body, but all in all a great IPA. I will be buying this again. good IPA for the hot summer. Cheers!"
"A very drinkable IPA. Not overhopped. Nice, Smooth and sessioable."
"Avery IPA pours a slightly hazy golden copper with a frothy white head. The aroma is sweet citrus, more orange than grapefruit, with hints of pine and some earthiness. The flavor is more citrusy hops upfront but not over the top on the bitterness. Sweet pale malt comes through, followed by solid bitterness that lingers after the beer is gone. This is a great American IPA for sure, tons of the ""C hops"" I love."
"The mouthfeel remains on the lighter side of medium(how I like it) with enough carbonation to keep it balanced. There is also a slight creaminess to the mouthfeel that I liked alot."
"A dark gold color with a tan head. The nose has a collection of citrus fruits, spicy hops and faint candy malts. Flavors of big powerful hops over a rich malt profile. A well balanced and tasty IPA. The body is medium with some hop oil to it. A nice example of the style. Goes quite well with some spicy curry."
"D - A nice balanced and drinkable IPA that is a good choice anytime. Not quite among the best in most stores' selections (Odell, Stone, Dogfish, etc. are tastier in my book), but still a nice beer nonetheless."
""
"Golden amber in color with a thin white head that falls to a ring, leaving some lacing down the glass. Smell is floral, perfume, and herbal up front with light citrus fruit underneath. Pretty unique. Taste is peppery hops and citric flavor coming after. Grapefruit, orange, but all of which are lighter/not as bold and up front as your typical IPA however. A hint of caramel sweetness to balance and then a nice biscuity malt flavor rides in for the finish. Mouthfeel isn't as lively or bitter as you'd expect. Light spicy bitterness and kind of slick on the tongue but not watery. I like this one more than the numbers may indicate. Almost sessionable."
"Just to make sure I wasn't being too harsh, I cracked open a Sweetwater IPA (my IPA standard) to try side-by-side comparison. Not even close. Sweetwater's looks and tastes better, with better mouthfeel."
"cheers."
"Poured from the bottle into a session glass. It is a golden orange color, lace head which sticks around for a while. The nose is Hoppy with pine and citrus notes, great if your a fan of hops and true to the style. The taste is hop forward good bite just enough malt, to balance it out. The mouthfeel is medium bodied a little chewy with a dry hop bitterness. Good beer if more available I would drink it more often."
"Drinkability- A very good IPA one that I would drink again."
"Drinkability- Smooth, easy drinking. A good everyday beer. I would buy a sixer."
"D - Solid IPA geared for hopheads."
"D - Very well balanced IPA, I'd certainly go for another. A decent drinker and certainly one to look for, reco!"
"Not a bad IPA from our friends at Avery. Pours a light auburn with a respectable head at first but dissapates quickly. I enjoyed this beer in a pint glass. Smells a mix between floral and oily hops. Taste the same with some mild grassy notes. Stings the tongue a bit."
"D- Very drinkable. Nice balance and quite tasty"
"Final thoughts - Very clean and refreshing ale."
"A very fine IPA that I will not mind enjoying again."
"Avery IPA is an easy drinker. I'm sure we'll session before summer's end."
"A nice clear amber color with solid frothy off-white head and fair lace. It has a neat musty grapefruit aroma and some medicinal sweetness, almost rootbeer and vanilla. Big grapefruit hop flavor jumps out in a heavenly smooth creamy body, near chewy feel. Still it's an excellent guzzle beer with big time good flavor. There's a mild dry finish. Some malt and caramel along with a bit of nutty goodness. Drinkable and delicious! Bravo."
"A better then average IPA that doesn't disappoint. It has all the basics but it doesn't go much further then that. A nice beer thats easy to drink and worth having a few on a mild spring night."
"Mouthfeel is right on. Not cloying and not excessively dry. Avery's IPA is a nice beer, however nothing new here. I'll try it again some day."
"Mouthfeel is spot on: full-bodied, rather soft on the tongue at first with a dry finish. Very easy to drink for an IPA. Sessionable, but not my favorite."
"The body is a bit big for style. There is an oily texture that is a bit off but ok. From the tap seems smoother and easier to drink. Overall very easy drinking beer but missing a few tangibles for me to be great."
"D: A thirst quencher. Good for a handful but not quite session worthy with its ABV."
"All and all a good choice - but I think other IPAs such as Mojo would come first. I wish Avery was more common in Iowa."
"D: I would drink plenty more. Much better than others in this style that may be more popular."
"Drinkability was quite good. This beer could have contained a bit more ""punch"" in the flavor department, yet it was enjoyable nevertheless. Definitely a sessionable IPA."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a big foamy head with good retention but no lacing. Aroma of dry bitter hops with minimal floral or citrus notes. Taste is also dominated by some dry bitter hops with some light caramel malt notes. Medium body with good carbonation. Not bad overall and pretty straight forward - I would have preferred more citrus notes and some floral notes but still enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: An ok IPA... its just a bit out of balance.."
"When I moved to Colorado and asked the locals what the best IPA in the state was, this is the beer that the majority of locals pointed me toward. Well, I've probably bought and finished off 5-6 6-packs of this brew over the years, and I think that it ranks right up there with the best. Great fresh hop aroma and taste with a lingering fresh hopped aftertaste. This is a very drinkable highly hopped beer, and I recommend it to all IPA drinkers."
"Drinkability is good, this is a tasty, fresh IPA, whose aroma in particular really benefits from the extra dry-hopping (although it didn't really change the original beer, just enhance)."
"Got this one under the name ""Hop Freaks Unite"" at the Berkley Front, assumed it'd be a solid one. It wasn't too bad at all. Poured a nice copper color with a good off-white pile of foam on top that left excellent lacing as it drained. Crystal clear. Definitely a nice looking brew. Nose was too mild, a touch of citrusy hops but not much else. Taste was a little better, although still a fairly subdued flavor. Citrus and fruity hops working fairly well with the very subtle caramel hops. Body was solid with good carbonation. Overall, not a bad one, although it might work better in my book as a pale ale rather than an IPA, just because the hops were so mild."
"From the tap, it had a clear amber appearance with a thin lacing. Overall, a sharp, hoppy malt aromas was the primary smells I feel. The taste had citrus sweetness supplementing the malty flavors. A great carbonation kept the drink from lacking it in its quality. Overall, a very good IPA."
"D. Very drinkable. A solid IPA that I hope will soon be more readily available."
"D'ability - A very drinkable IPA. Hop flavor prominent, but not distinctive. Lack of harsh ""pucker"" factor on the bitterness increases the drinking experience."
"D - Good, but would prefer other IPAs vs this guy."
"D: A very good IPA, not the best I've ever had but certainly not a bad option."
"Pours a nice orange-amber color with good head and nice lacing, although there was an extraordinary amount of carbonation (which I don't prefer). It has a nice scent, a very hoppy/bitter aroma with orange-citrus overtones; however, the aroma was very light. A nice hoppy flavor, perhaps a bit dry, but very nice nonetheless. Nothing overly distinct, though. It goes down fine, just a bit rough from the dryness. While it would not be my first IPA of choice, it goes well with the sampler pack from Avery and it would not be a waste what-so-ever."
"Nice beer."
"Final Statement: Decent IPA, not elite, but very good."
"Floral, malty aroma. Clear and golden with minimal white head that dissipated quickly. No lacing, but a few bubbles on sides of the glass. A good, balanced hop and malt flavor. Flavor and aftertase both had a lot of citric and floral overtones. Aftertaste also had a lingering bitterness. Medium-light carbonation and medium bodied."
"Overall, a great offering from Avery. I would recommend for any hop-lover."
"Nice fragrant hops from an amber pour with little head. Good malty, caramel backing matched very well with hops flavor and light lingering bitterness. An above average IPA for sure with a leaning towards hoppier end of the spectrum flavor to it. Need to try again, but good."
"Very drinkable, and recommended to fans of IPAs. Pretty typical of the style, and as sessionable as any 6.3% abv beers come. Ill be trying this one again, and hop for a fresher, more aromatic sample that would turn this good beer into a great one."
"Although perhaps not a memorable American IPA, still well done a worth a try."
"Thanks go out to barefootbrewer for this one that I acquired in a trade. Poured a nice deep golden color with orange hues and a nice white head that left decent lacing around glass. Aroma is hoppy with notes of grass, pine, and citrus. Flavor is the same, and is well-balanced with the hoppiness. This beer is nice and is not overdone. Very smooth and easy drinking. Good stuff."
"Overall, a big disappointment. Just beer with extra hops, no real character. Did not care at all for the very bitter, resiny taste, nor the gummy, almost mucousy mouthfeel. I have mixed feelings about IPAs in general, and this one did nothing to change my mind. Simply adding a bunch of hops to a beer does not generally improve it."
"this was much better than expected. appearance is deceiving, a clear gold with a nice, creamy white head and persistent lacing. aroma of cookie dough predominates with floral, sweet spice (cinammon?), honey, and light-colored fruits. overall a complex, sweet, but not overwhelming bouquet that is hard to put my finger on. taste is moderate sweet malts and moderate hop bitterness, quite well-balanced, i wavered with scoring this quite high as well/ nice smooth but lingering bitter finish. medium-bodied, almost luscious for this strength, creamy, and some lively drying carbonation."
"Overall... an OK beer. I would probably get it against because of its low cost, but I'm not going crazy over it."
"Poured out of a bottle into a Sam Imperial pilsner glass. Nice deep gold color with orange hues. Slightly cloudiness. Nice off white head that left good lacing throughout. Smells of clean, crisp hoppiness (citrus). Taste is good and crisp, not overly bitter, but strong hop flavor. You can really catch the clean hop finish. Very drinkable."
"This is a quite tame IPA, which makes it very very drinkable."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy yellow-gold in color with a little over a finger of off-white head that left some decent lacing. Aroma is mostly of hops, citrus (namely grapefruit) and pine aromas but a decent amount of maltyness to balance it out. Taste is quite good, lots of piney, citrusy hops in this one. However, it is still fairly balanced. The malts don't take a back seat and make sure that they make their presence known. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation. In terms of drinkability this was pretty good. It was balanced and enjoyable and had a hop forward flavor profile that didn't overwhelm my palate."
"This is a refreshing Am-IPA offering from Avery. None or very little with respect to pine notes, but this beer is a smooth and drinkable. Very refreshing. It would appeal to me more in warmer weather. Otherwise, not a lot of character here compared to the hoppier extreme beers I like, but that can be nice at time. I might try this again, depending on the other offerings at my beer bar. But it isn't on my list of favorites."
"Notes - This is one of the better IPAs I've tried recently - truly great stuff. The only thing preventing me from giving it a higher rating is the sheer quantity of great IPAs out there right now. Blind Pig this ain't, but it's a quality brew nonetheless and worth seeking out. Glad to see Avery distributing to California these days; I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far and I'll definitely be picking this up again."
"D - really nice; would definitely drink this all night or buy for home"
"D - Quite drinkable. Very bitter and not too sweet. Good for someone who prefers bitter/hoppy with very little sweetness and not too much depth in malt. A good beer for this style, though a little light for me personally."
"Pours a clear amber with some nice cream head. Airy hoppy nose that gives some pine characters. Smells like a forest of vibrant pine trees. Flavor is meaty with piney attributes. Just a robust overall flavor profile. Not much complexity to it. It just hits you and stays that way. Feel is good on the liquid. Nice bubble to it as well. Overall pretty drinkable. Not really a hop bomb, and not really a dud. It is what it is."
"The first brew I ever sampled from Avery was their White Rascal, and I loved it... this brew just about matches it, if not better... appearance was exceptonal... very cloudy and hazy with a nice frothy head whose unexpectedly light color slightly resembled a wheat beer or hefe... Smell was great, full of bittersweet hops combined with citrus and grapefruit... taste complemented the aroma, with a bitter-sweet finish combined with grapefruit, citrus, and hops... flavor was slightly sweeter than usual for an IPA, which I really liked... this is perhaps one of the best IPA's I've ever tried... a great brew, Definitely recommended..."
"Pours golden with an orange tint to it. Smells of citrusy hops which aren't quite as strong as most IPA's, but are definitely there. There's some faint spice underneath it all. Has a good one-finger off-white head that fades fairly quickly leaving an inconsistent lacing behind. Tastes of hops which aren't too brutal, but maybe not as powerful as other IPA's. That being said, they work well in this beer. There's some orange peel mixed in that has some subtle fruity sweetness to it. Mouth-feel is smooth with a bit of chalkiness left behind that grows more obvious after a few drinks. Overall not a bad IPA, but I would change a couple of things to make this one stand out from the pack a bit more, something Avery usually excels at."
"A little different from what I was expecting from Avery. I love Avery Maharaja with its heavy duty hops blast. This was a good beer, but not as hoppy as most IPAs. Pours a clear, dark gold color with a fairly small white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing. Smell is mild hops. Taste is what I would call ""floral"" hops and fairly sweet malt. Mouthfeel is ok, not watery but not full bodied either. Very crisp, the sweetness is not cloying or annoying in any way. Very pleasant and drinkable and nicely balanced but not a typical American IPA. As good a session beer as the 6.3 abv allows. Just not a hop-heads IPA."
"D - A little on the bitter side, but a good IPA. Could use some more malt to balance things out a bit, but otherwise, it's pretty solid."
"Smells of subtle sweetness with a floral bouquet of bitter hops. Nose is more hops than anything. The taste surprised me. Seems nothing like the nose in this beer. Starts off sweet and malty and gets fruity & citrusy hop flavors coming through afterwards, finishing pretty dry. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, and dry finish. I would rank this beer pretty drinkable. There are a good amount of IPA's that I would grab first but this one is definitely no slouch."
"Good starter beer to begin a night."
"Nothing wrong with this IPA. Amber colored with a one finger head and good lacing. Aroma is of citrus hops. Taste is not overly sweet a lot of hops come through maybe not as much as a double IPA but you can drink more of these without falling down. This is a beer you could drink all night and not lose interest. Enough complexity to keep your taste & olfactory buds working."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Just right. Nice and crisp w/ lively carbonation. All these qualities lead to a very nice beer. Not the best AIPA I've had, but it is a great one. Definitely in my top 20 at least. I will definitely try this one again and again."
"This is everything I like about IPA, and why I like IPA best. Simply put, this brew has a lot of fruit (nose and taste) but is also bitter (not overwhelmingly) without the alcohol of a double IPA, which makes it more drinkable. I'm not sure why this beer is not among the ranks of hyped IPAs. It's certainly one of my favorites."
"nice light color. gold meets amberish. very clear. white head with okay retention and okay lace. nose is hops like it should be. mostly citrusy -lemon with a touch of orange and some grapefruit in the background... also just enough malt for the hops to ride on. taste is the same... like a car with just enough gas to make it to the next filling station. medium body. smooth and slick with a hint of bite. goes down easy. if avery ipa was a girl ,i wouldn't kick her out of bed."
"I dont particularly enjoy the bitterness from this one and instead prefer a more simple IPA, but I do think that it is an interesting brew."
"D: Exceptional beer. One of the best American IPA's I've had. Will be buying this regularly (if I can find this in my neck of the woods!)"
"A tasty pale ale, this golden-reddish ale rests below a modest off-white head that laces the glass nicely. Citrus hops rise to the fore, with a good deal of bitter smooth taste. Impossible to miss the hops in this, a plus. The texture was overall smooth, but with a somewhat bitter and, dare I say, chalky mouthfeel that somewhat diminished my excitement. Still, a fine IPA well worth having, and again, a fine product from the wonderland of Avery."
"Had this on tap and it poured an orange color. There was a decent amount of creamy white head that really laced the glass nicely. It was a bit hazy in the glass. It smelled very strongly of hops. Quite citrusy and a little malty. The taste was real nice and malty sweet, just a bit more bitter than what I was expecting. It left a sweet aftertaste. Over all it was a really good beer and would have it again."
"Decent little IPA here. Pours a lager-like yellow, with very light head. Smell is very citrusy and biscuity. Nice lemony bite with a light malt backbone. A bit high in carbonation for me, but not disarmingly so. I would neither seek out nor avoid another one..."
"This beer pours a clear orange with a white, foamy head and smells hoppy and briney with hints of concord grape. The concord grape really comes through in between the two waves of hops (the second being noticably more intense than the first). Personally, I find this beer to be too hoppy...It would have been very nice without that second, stronger wave of hops. But still, not bad!"
"D- Good, but the flavour is one i'd tire of rapidly it it was all I had to drink. Definitely thirst quenching due to the crisp, drying mouthfeel and citrus flavour. Would be good in the heat."
"Pretty solid IPA, but from the makers of Maharaja I'm underhwelmed. Basically this lacks the robustness of flavor that makes a truly great IPA, in my opinion."
"This is a damn fine IPA from Avery. Very sessionable and enjoyable."
"Overall: A rock solid IPA with a big bold hop taste. It drinks rather smoothly and is rather enjoyable. I will be purchasing a sixer to enjoy during this Sunday's football games."
"The Avery IPA is light hazy goldish orangish in color. It has an awesome head that leaves good lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is floral and the taste is bitter up front and sweet on the back end. It was chewy to mouth and enjoyable. It has a nice abv that is masked conveniently. I would buy this one again."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable. The taste stays with you and stays satisfying."
"Bottom Line- Not my favortite Americal IPA, a little too malty for me but definitely one I will have again."
"Mmmm....smell is wonderful. Fresh citrus hops and a very floral, grassy texture to it as well. There is a bit of pine in the mix as well as a hint of soil or something earthy like that... The taste, is much more floral than the smell, but still citrusy. A medium body, moderately carbonated, kind of sticks in the mouth though. It's a good, refreshing beer, but there are much better IPAs out there, much better session beers too... My thoughts are conflicted on this one. It's good, just not very impressive."
"D - This was just too hoppy for me..I keep trying IPAs and nothing I've tried really stacks up to DFH 60 but it was good for the style and I'm sure many other would like it..just not for me"
"D- a solid IPA"
"It's been some time since I liked an IPA so much. The ale pours a orange hued gold. Crystal clear, with random carbonation trails. A thin bubbly cap with some lacing noted. Smell is a strong piney hop element. A very pleasant bitter aroma. Taste is more of the piney hops. Some sweetened grapefruit hits as well. A woody resin finish. Mouthfeel is clean and very astringent. I have found another sessionable, affordable IPA."
"D- One of those beers that I kept passing over, but I am glad that I finally tried it. I've had better IPA's (everyone has favorites), but this is a real stand-up guy."
"Highly drinkable for how bitter it was, not too heavy"
"D: Very refreshing! Love the hops! Definitely worth a try!"
"This IPA pours an orange color with a thick, and bubbly 2 inch white head. Head slowly fades into the background with a thin white layer of head that sticks around. Smell is grapefruit and a slight whiff of pine in the background. Mouthfeel is mostly grapefruit in the hops aroma and some malt balance. More balanced than a lot of other IPAs but the hop heads should rejoice at the wonderfully hoppy taste here for an IPA. Very smooth carbonation makes this a delicious IPA."
"This hopped-up ale pours a nice amber with a great head that stick to the glass as you go. Nice floral aroma but not much else to the smell. This beer is really hopped up, but not to a fault. Very bitter, but pretty smooth considering and goes down very clean. Not the most balanced IPA in my opinion, but that is hardly a draw back. Do yourself a favor and grab some of this brew if you need to satisfy a hop fix."
"Pours a rich golden color. The smell is somewhat faint, but pretty pleasant. One of the best tasting American IPA's, rich rich floral hop flavor as you first taste the brew, then the toasty malt, and finally the perfectly bitter finish. An exceptionally well rounded beer, however it is pretty strong, perhaps not the best choice for someone new to the style. I was also rather surprised that the beer has 69 IBU's, the beer doesn't taste overly hoppy at all."
"This is really up there in the AIPA category. A very satisfying brew."
"Pours a clear, rich golden color with a two inch pillowy head that gave way to big bubbles and lots of lacing. Aroma is piney and grassy hops with some grapefruit overtones. Slightly soapy. Taste is of light malt with a good floral/citrus hop character. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This is a very nice IPA. Flavors are not too strong, and remain well-balanced. Would enjoy again."
"D - This is decently drinkable, but not really my idea of a session brew. The grapefruit is a little bit too puckering for me to drink more than maybe two. Otherwise, this is a great IPA! I'll probably buy this again."
"D- A very refreshing IPA, not overly hopped, a very welcome taste."
"D- This is a great one to drink and has many hop personalities to it. Avery does a nice job at having some hop bitterness but accenting the hop flavor in this IPA. Its not nearly as delicious as the Maharaja but still decent none the less. One that I will probably revisit-definately worth a try."
"Great Beer. One of my Favorite IPAs on the market... Thought it had a great hoppy smell. I tend to like a lot of the Avery Brewing Brews. I think that they are a great small brewery and I hope that their IPA continues to catch on in the New England area."
"I will definitely buy Avery IPA again!"
"D: Goes down easy & would make a decent session beer (if 6.3% abv is not too high for you). No real complaints, it's a good beer that I'll happily drink again - but it's not one of my favorite IPAs."
"Again, this went wonderfully with my spicy chicken sub and I'll have it again. Great if you're a hophead looking for a quick fix."
"Anyway, certainly try it. I hope to track this down in a keg one of these days soon and see how it works there."
"D: A good IPA from Avery, I've had better, but a quality beer at a good price, and easy to find, I'm sold. Will please beginning IPA drinkers and hopheads alike."
"This is a decent IPA overall, but I can't see what makes this special. It is slightly flawed and harsh. Not enough to really complain about, but enough to keep it from greatness. The citrus does shine forth, especially in the nose. It does seem to be lacking something tying it together that would improve it. As it is, it's decent, but found myself going to another IPA after one of these, though a second would be fine too."
"Taste was bitter, citrusy hops, but is well balanced by the malt. Easy drinking and very crisp. Awesome beer, long lasting bitterness. Very sessionable."
"I had this on draft and was served a clear yellow pint with about ½ retentive head. The smell was of fresh hops and quite inviting. The taste was bitter initially from the hops, but there was a sweet malt backbone that held the flavors together. The mouthfeel was medium with a dry finish. This is an easy to drink IPA that was impressively hoppy, but not overbearing."
"India Pale Ale pours a light orange with a craggy off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is citrusy hops - grapefruit to be specific. There is a wonderful bitter grapefruit hop flavor that dominates this beer. The malt in the background is doing its job but never gets in the way of the hops. An excellent modern American interpretation of IPA."
"Body is medium to slightly thin. Good hopping can be to blame, wouldn't mind a little more insistent malt presence. Flavorful and easy to drink, perhaps a touch on the simple side."
"The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and the carbo is medium. It's not an over the top type of IPA but it's a solid example of the style and it would be a regular of mine if it was available locally. Good stuff."
"Overall, a very good IPA. It was a bit of a suprise, although Avery is quickly moving up my list of very good breweries. This can compete with most IPA's out there. Highly recommended."
"D - very good, highly drinkable IPA, mo' bitter is mo' better."
"O: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, excellent representation of style, decent kick, its flavorful enough that you can keep drinking for a long time without looking for something else. This is definitely a beer that I would stick with for a whole evening."
"Pours a clean pale yellow and a small white head, sticky lacing too. In the nose big grapefruity hops, and the same in the taste, but with a dry end. It has a malty body and leave a dryness in the mouth. Good beer, with a good hop presence. Smooth and easy to put down."
"I'm gonna get another one....Cheers"
"This is a perfectly drinkable beer, but is not really what I look for in the style. I do find it refreshing after getting off work on a day that saw a high of 101 F, but I don't think I'll need an IPA like this again unless it's being offered cheap at my local."
"D-This is a good IPA. I have been dissapointed with other Avery brews I have had but this one is excellent. This is one i would get again."
"Golden orange pour with a white head which leaves lace down the glass.Citrus and pine scents in the aroma. Nice balance of hops and malt in the flavor. Not extremely bitter, a good starter IPA for those who are wary of the hop. Citrus hop flavors are present in the beginning. Some sweetness and bread malt flavors break through in the middle, but the hops take over with a nice bitter finish. High marks for drinkability. This would make a wonderful session beer if I had more than one bottle."
"The best way to describe an Avery beer is smooth. Nothing is ever out of whack when drinking an Avery. This is a clean,not too hoppy,not too bitter IPA. This is the kind of beer to give someone just starting out on IPA's because it will not scare them away. Then they can move up to a Maharaja and find true inner peace."
" Overall I have to give this one pretty marks. It really was exactly what I wanted at that time and did not dissapoint at all. It was your classic west coast hop bomb of an IPA, and that is something that I just love. Definatly a winner from Avery, a damn fine finish brew."
"Pours a clear light ho-hum gold with noticeable carbonation, with a decent head and lacing. Strong aroma of grapefruity hops. The taste ensues with strong grapefruit bitterness upfront that eases a bit as it goes down. Good aftertaste that lingers..."
"The mouthfeel was light, which aids in the drinkability. The carbonation was tight and dialed in."
"First sighting of this draught in Central KY. The beer is as impressive as ever. Pours a bright copper / orange color with a decent chill haze that never went away and superb, frothy head retention that was just off from white, but stood firm to the bottom of the glass. The aromas are a mouth watering blend of toasted barley malt and citrus hops. Flavors are full and juicy, comprised of light caramel, bready, orange peel, lemon grass, and ruby red grapefruit. A touch of pine, yeast, and tartness rounded out the brew. The trick here is balance -- of course the hops shine, but not without keeping in check with the strong malt backbone, and creamy texture. The beer never wavered from fullness and richness, down to the the bottom of the glass. Fantastic experience with this one."
"A good session beer that I will pick up in more quantity when I can find it."
"Bitter hops up front, citrusy becoming herbal, and dry in the finish. As it warms, there's a cereal grain quality like puffed wheat or rice. Bleh. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel, that isn't balanced by the taste. One-dimensional bitterness becomes tiresome halfway through. Alcohol presence doesn't help either, and soon enough, water is needed to cleanse the palate."
"overall a great beer for a good price"
"D - All around a above average IPA. I really could knock a few of these back."
"The smell was pretty nice! fresh, citrusy, with a nice maltyness in the background. The taste...ehh, a bit on the fresh-hop side up front then a solid bitterness at the end of the palate. Perhaps too much. I believe that a tad more malt would balance this out nicely. It has a thinnish mouthfeel with a bit of prickliness on the toungue. Tangy and a lot of aroma hops going on here."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Very well rounded with a variety of hop and malt flavors. Recommended."
"overall, a good IPA. definitely traditional and definitely bitter. might not please everyone, but i liked it."
"in the glass. Another lovely Colorado IPA."
"Being a geographer I really like the bottle. Clear golden amber color with a very good head. Average lacing. The smell is very nice. Very hoppy. I'm not sure what type of hops but I like it. Taste is that of a solid American IPA. Not as complex as Dogfish head 60 min but just damn good. Finishes very clean."
"Id call this an IPA initiator. Its got a nice big hops flavor, but with a relatively mellow bitterness for the style. The hops are quite tasty with a tangy citrus backed with peach flavor. There isnt really any malt to speak off, but thats fine, the hops do well carrying this beer. Good appearance, ok aroma."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish amber color with a large off-white head with great retention and a lot of lacing. The aroma is a nice pale malt base with citrusy hops jumping out and making their presence known. The hops are right up front in the taste with some malt in the middle followed by a long hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is delightfully smooth and creamy. Wow, this is one hell of an IPA! Overall, this certainly is a great beer that will surely come to mind when I am in the mood for an IPA. Recommended."
"D - Okay. It is a medicore IPA. Very soapy tasting and out of the soap sector there isn't much going on. I will not bother with this one in the future."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangey amber with a one finger off white head. Aroma is primarily citrus with some pine definitely in the mix. Taste is very pleasant but mild citrus hops with some pine. Little resin. Rather thin and easy to drink. A very pleasant IPA that does a nice job of balancing the bitterness. Very sessionable IPA."
"The taste matches the aroma, but with a nice complimentary alcohol flavor even with the low ABV. Body is light and crisp and leaves a great lingering aftertaste of hops. Overall, this is a very tasty, very drinkable IPA. It's definately one of my favorite offerings from Avery, can't wait to try the Maharaja DIPA."
"This is a great ipa, i enjoy it alot and why its not extreme or over the top it is well balanced strong in its profile and accurate in its style. very good"
"Very appetizing finish though - keeps you yearing for the next sip. Nice."
"Bottle at ACME pizza and bar. Poured hazy golden orange with a nice retaining head. The aroma was typical; very hoppy, floral and citric. The taste was fairly bitter but nice. There is nothing special here that separates it from the others but its obviously solid. The mouthfeel is medium but fairly carbonated. The drinkability wasnt the best at first due to bitterness and doesnt get much easier throughout the rest of the 11 ounces."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation, and the drinkability is just great. My glass is almost empty, and I feel like I just barely started drinking it. I'm glad I can now get this in Council Bluffs, Iowa."
"Appearance was a clear golden color, unique for an IPA. White foamy head with lots of bubbles. Lacing is very sticky all over the entire glass. There is something different about the smell of this IPA. The citrus is there, the pine is there, the floral is there....but I think it has a smokey aspect to it, or maybe a hint of spice/herb. Taste is more powerful on the floral side than the citrus/pine side. I see a similarity in taste to the Harpoon IPA. But once again that smokey-ness comes through on the taste as well. This could be coming from the malt which helps the balance quite well. Carbonation is constant but minimal. Mouthfeel is dry but enjoyable. Drinkability is there, I really enjoy this brew. Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance. Avery has yet to disappoint me."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an orange-gold color with a thick, two fingered bubbly head. The smell is a nice bouquet of grassy/citrusy hops, a bit of spice and a touch of sweet malt. The taste is also quite hoppy, very well balanced though and only slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, very enjoyable. Overall I must say that this is an excellent IPA, not the most extreme mind you, but very well done and drinkable. As it says on the bottle ""yeah it is!"""
"Pours a light amber with a decent white head that fades to a thin cap that sticks around and leaves some pretty good lacing. The aroma is of cereal grain,light malt, and some floral hops. The taste is nice and balanced between the malt and hops. A littlemaltier than some ipas, but not sweet. The hops could be a little more pungent in this one, but its a quaffable brew,medium bodied and relatively refreshing."
"Overall, I can recommend this, but I also wouldn't rave over it."
"Definitely an enjoyable IPA -- nothing spectacular, but if given the opportunity I'd definitely check this out again. Good flavor and comes out seeming generally balanced."
"On-tap @ 69 Taps Pub & Eatery. It was served to me in a standard American bar pint glass. I thought they served a bit too cold, so I let it warm up just a bit. This Avery beer was a clear almost pale gold color with a nice 1 finger soft white pillowy head of foam that had excellent retention. It left behind some foamy rings, a small skim of foam, and tons and tons of white sticky lace around the glass. I thought the aroma was way too soft. It need to be more pungent. All it had was just a trace of grapefruit and a hint of citrus hops. And those only came out when it was warmed up. There was nothing when it was cold. It improved a great deal in the taste. It started off with a small hint of toasted malts and then went directly to a bare knuckle grapefruit punch to the tastebuds. After that I detected only a trace of citrus hops and a few citrus fruits and that's all folks. That grapefruit punch was just so strong that no other flavors could come out to shine by themselves. It had a slight aftertaste of grapefruit to it, but at that time, I could tell that the grapefruit gave everything it could give in the initial taste. Overall, a very nice slightly above average grapefruity IPA and it's something I would to like have again on-tap or in a bottle."
"The aroma is distinctive: both a sweet and spicy smell with a combination orange and grapefruitiness. The flavor is good and hoppy as an IPA should be. It is accompanied by a sweet maltiness and contains pine notes and spicy ginger in the mix. The mouthfeel is a light to medium body that has a real nice zing to it. An easy drinker."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Sierra Nevada shaker ""pint""glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with about two fingers of fluffy off-white foam. Moderate lacing through the first half of the glass, but it has since become virtually non-existent. Smells of fresh pine, citrus, and caramel malt. Tastes of pine, mildly bitter grapefruit, spicy pepper, followed by a decent malt backbone. Medium in both body and carbonation. Recommended."
"Beer poured a golden color with a nice white head that is well sustained and leaving generous lacing behind. Nose is a blast of resinous grapefruit hops. Taste is slightly malty up front and finishes full hop force with the Simcoe hops being predominate. Mouthfeel is fairly full and smooth for the style. Overall drinkability is good. This is a great beer to try for the hopheads out there!"
"I would pair this with cajun chicken primavera or perhaps a nice hotdog."
"Pours a very clear, light copper color with a thin head. Smell is not very strong - with grapefruit and floral hop notes present. Taste has a slight sweet grapefruit and caramel malt up front followed immediately by strong hop bitterness. There is little in the way of balance here as the hops dominate the finish. Nicely flavored overall, but lacking balance in my opinion."
"Overall an exceptional IPA. Very drinkable and a pretty close to perfection."
"As a side note, my aunt (who knows nothing about beer) got me a 6 pack of this for my birthday. I love when relatives actually care enough to go out and find good beer. It's so much better than getting a gift certificate."
"I decided to finally re-try this one after loving the Maharajah so much. The color was yellow with a rocky white head. The smell was weird and pungent. The taste was bitter and not in a good way like Ruination. I think I probably had an old batch but no way to tell. I would not buy this again and I would recommend people buy the Maharajah instead."
"OA, quite good. A nice find. A well-hopped regular IPA with a manageable ABV."
"Overall, this is a very nice American IPA, without the aggressive bitterness and citrus flavors of some other IPAs. Definitely a beer for hopheads like myself."
"The beer was served with a decent sized head that was lasting and left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by citrus hops over a pale malt backbone, it was somewhat weak, however. The taste was a great balance of fresh citrus and piney hops against a subtle malt backbone. The beer was nice and creamy on the palate. The alcohol was well hidden. This is not all that high on my list of IPAs, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Notes: I'm not sure how long this one has been in my cellar -- it ended up hidden behind some bigger bottles -- but it's probably been there at least 6 months. Not sure if this would be a big hop bomb fresh, but it was definitely enjoyable after a few months of aging. . . . My wife had a Stone IPA at the same time, and it was remarkable how similar they appeared, color-wise. If anything the Avery looked a little better (just a hint darker and with better head retention), but I liked the nose on the Stone more. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability- Overall a very solid choice."
"I'm picking up intense nodes of Columbus and Centennial hops, but there's at least two and maybe even three more in there. It's excellent, whatever the blend is."
"Avery's India Pale Ale poured a light, golden color and I was surprised to find some cloudiness to this beer. Head development was substantial with thick clumps of foam clinging to the sides of my pint glass. This beer is very hoppy, but exhibits the typical hop bouquet of an American IPA. Taste exhibits good hop biterness; not too powerful, but lingering just a bit too long on the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, also typical of the style. Overall, this is a good, solid IPA. Definitely one for hop lovers."
"Solid."
"Taste is pretty one dimensional. Bitterness is predominately piney and resiny and bites pretty hard. There's not much in the way of malt sweetness to balance out the hops, and the malt has a decidedly soapy awkwardness that takes this one down a notch on my scale. That's really about all there is to say about the flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a carbonation that's just about right. This is a sessionable IPA, but there's nothing here to lift this from the realm of good, average IPA into the realm of greatness."
"Pours a light orange with good head and lacing. As one could expect from an IPA, there are plenty of hops to go around. A little malt profile at the begining, piney notes, grapefruit, and a trademark lingering bitter finish. Pretty much another pleasent American IPA in a field of satisfying IPA's."
"Medium bodied, sticky mouthfeel. Hop bitternes in the finish. Mild. A nice IPA. This could cerainly be one of the regulars in my fridge. Drinkability is nice."
"Slightly thin on the palate without proper balance. It doesn't coat the mouth like other ipas that have more malts to fill out the body and provide more structure. Drinkability is a touch above average for an IPA though again unchallenged hop bitters lower the score a notch."
" An overall good IPA and pretty drinkable...I could have a few of these."
"Avery's IPA shows some very pleasant qualities, but is too unbalanced in taste and mouthfeel to be considered a very good American IPA. Nevertheless, it's not a bad idead to grab a six pack of this one to try."
"D - Taste is one dimensional, but it's a very nice taste."
"I found this beer to be drinkable."
"Notes: a good beer. You can't go wrong with this berer. It is moderately priced, for its chatracteristics, and a very good bargain."
"Mouthfeel was appropriate, and all-in-all, I thought this beer was OK, but not great."
"Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel,very pleasing,not as intense as a lot of IPA's out there,but very enjoyable,this is one I could drink all night."
"M&D - as another reviewer put it, one of the more drinkable IPA's, nto to overdone, we're not talking 120 min level here, but quite good, would not be a problem to knock back a few of these in a single session"
"DA: Not too bad fpr the stlye, easy enough to drink."
"Poured into a pint glass, it's a very nice opaque apricot color. This may sound pretentious, but it's accurate. Decent-looking one-finger head that settled down nicely and left a bit of lace on the glass as I drank it. Wow, the aroma is not at all what I was expecting (and who knows what that was). Very malty and sweet, I almost get a strawberry sensation from this smell. I really like it, but it's unlike most IPAs I've had. The flavor is also not like most IPAs. Heavy malt content here, and the hops don't really make a presence until the end (and even then they're a bit subdued). Slight citrus hints here as well, but mostly a very pleasant sweet maltiness is in charge. Sturdy mouthfeel for sure. A clever IPA from Avery, in my opinion. It's not phenomenal, and it's not a hop-head's dream come true, but it is a mighty fine beer on the whole. I could easily see making this part of my weekly repertoire if I lived in the Boulder area. But, since I don't, I'll have to pick it up sparingly from time to time here in DC. Still, a job well done by Avery here."
"Drinkability is quite good."
"D - This is a nice IPA. Very hoppy almost like a Double IPA."
"Overall - Not my favorite example of an IPA, although I could see how people could really get into this one."
"D-This is a fantastic IPA....right up there on the top tier of IPA's...very enjoyable brew.."
"This beer struck me as a bit average. It's drinkable, and session worthy, but just not the flavors I want for when I look for an American IPA."
"Mouthfeel is pretty much where it should be. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is high on this one, but I would like to see some more sweetness. This beer was just straight on hop bitterness (not necessarily bad). Would get again, but if I'm really craving an IPA, I would probably go with some other offerings in my area."
"Nice pouring full 2 finger head with stringy lace around the glass. Golden yellow with a brownish haze at the top. Nice flowery aroma definitely some hops in this ale. Swirling hops around my mouth leaves a sweet bitterness, but not overpowering. Well balanced between alcohol and bitterness. Mouthfeel is not thick but some chewyness. These efforst combine in an easy drinking IPA. I would like another! Damn singles! I broke my own rule to always buy two!"
"Clear orange, topped with a generous white head. Tremendous presentation, sheeting lace coating the glass. Big citrusy nose, with just enough malt backing it up. Nice hop profile. Clean and bright. The flavor is pretty straightforward. Toasty pale malts running about 60/40 with bright, punchy pacific northwest citrus hoppage. Just a bit of pear fruitiness, and floral hop notes. Maybe a little lighter feeling on the tongue, but it does make it drink a little easier. Very clean overall, making for a bright, assertive flavor. Bold, but not overly bitter. This is a great, great session beer with fantastic drinkability."
"This beer was shockingly good. Most Avery beer that I've had I found to be mediocre to pretty good but this by far takes the cake. Don't pass on this one hop heads."
"Cheers!"
"A very nice offering for the hoppier beer lover. Great option to pair with chicken curry. Warning: must like hops. A definite must try if you are a fan of the bitter IPAs."
"this beer should get higher marks if you ask me. very in your face, hoppy american ipa. nice."
"This is a nice Ipa. Nice hop flavor. Nothing outstanding and captivating. It's typical, yet very nice. It has a great head and nice retention. It has a nice hoppiness to it. It has a crispness to it as well. It was very easy for me to drink. A nice IPA. IPA styles have a lot of nice beers. This one is typical, but nice."
"D- This is a good, but very dry, IPA that isn't holding back at all with the hop profile. It could use a bit more malt, but it's still good. I just wonder if they could pack any more hops into the glass! Wow."
"Well balanced and good beer which I'll be getting more of."
"A super IPA if you like 'em citrusy."
"If you like a dry tasting IPA, then this is a beer worth trying."
"The mouthfeel was pleasant giving off a wet cut grassy taste and a manderin orange mixed with roasted barley. The finish was dry and had hints of walnuts, making you thirst for more sips. The head remained at least half inch all the way to the very end of this tasty American IPA. Thanks to Avery brewing ."
"Pours a very clear and quite brilliant light, goldish amber with a fluffy, small-bubbled head that eventually dissipates to a dusting. Big-time grapefruit aromas come out first off, along with toasty pale malts with a biscuity character. The malt notes come out much more strongly at higher temperatures. Tastewise, this is a classic American IPA, with citrusy bitterness up front, juicy, mouthfilling carbonation and even more robust sweet citrus flavors at the mid-palate, and grainy flavors and textures at the end. The finish is quite dry. Overall, this is a well-made, prototypical American IPA with all the strengths (hop flavors, aromatics) and weaknesses (little hop/malt balance) of the genre."
"Otherwise, the beer is excellent and nice interpretation of the style."
"Smell is a blast of citrus hops and a touch of malt. Taste is like grapefruit juice, except soapy Leaves a downright musky aftertaste. Feel is unremarkable, aside from the lingering bitterness. Drain pour."
"A good typical IPA. We have many great IPA's to choose from these days, and this is close... Thankfully i have two more to thoroughly test out."
"Drinkability: A pretty tasty ipa. Flavors are nice and raw , with a focus on the more citrusy (not so much orange though) tastes. None are too powerful , nicely made."
"Pours with a fairly small head. Lots of citrusy hop aroma in the nose. Pours a orangish-gold color with a lovely medium mouthfeel, almost chewy. Flavor of orangy-citrus hops with a nicely balanced malt backbone. Quite a tasty and enjoyable brew, nicely crafted."
"Clear dark gold (verging on light orange) in colour with strong carbonation. Huge C-hop aromas of pine, black pepper, and grapefruit. More of the same in the mouth, only that the citrus flavors are a little less specifically grapefruit, and there is a sweet buttered biscuit element that makes an appearance mid palate. The chunky bitterness gets smoothed out a bit by the somewhat sweet malts. Good stuff."
"Smoothness along with strong citrus hop contribution makes for a very enjoyable drinking experience"
"D- It is alright. I think the just pure grapefruit gives of a weird tang in aftertaste. Same one as the smell. Not to good. I am glad this one is a 12oz."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: No complaints about mouthfeel, drinkability is high."
"Pours a light orange, bordering on golden, color with a decent head. Appears to be lighter in color than other IPAs. Smell is a very strong floral scent. Taste is somewhat average, with mostly floral taste and bitterness. Not an overwhelming hoppy taste, refreshing and easy to drink."
"The pour results in a light golden body topped with a medium cream head. Lacing is intricate and attractive. Nose is piney and leathery, very nice indeed. Taste is again, piney, like few other IPA's. If I was forced to compare I'd say this brew used real pine while the others used pine alternative.There's also a veggie/leathery taste that brings to mind sweet sugary corn and hops. I can think of no other way to explain. Mouth is nice and low on carbonation. This is damn fine ... I'm really digging this."
"This pours a clear golden amber with a giant white foamy head. Very good lacing and head retention make this a very good looking beer. The smell is all about citrus hops. Grapefruit and tangerine are the most dominate hop aromas. The taste is a creamy hoppy bitter delight. Rich with hop flavor, citrus and bitterness, makes this very,very good. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing very well. A very good beer that I could have as a session beer. Nice job Avery."
"D - I could see this as a dinner/session beer paired with a good meal. Maybe 2 or three over the course of an evening. I bet this is really nice when really fresh, but my sample was probably past it's prime. Nice, traditional IPA."
"Pale golden color, but with a creamy white head leaving a pretty good lacing. Hints of caramel and pine sap in the smell, perhaps a bit of lemon and grapefruit. Nice piney hoppiness to this, with a solid malt base to boot. Finish is a little light, but still nice and hoppy. Average carbonation with a nice full body. Pretty solid beer here, worth trying for sure."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The appearance was mediocre but turned out to be the best attribute. Dark golden and clear. The smell was a little hoppy but nothing special. The taste in particular was nothing to write home about. It could've been much hoppier, and honestly there was little malt presence as well. The most understated IPA flavor yet for me. I cannot recommend."
"D- a good IPA if you plan on having more than, and a more than decent enough hop fix for any hop head"
"Pours a translucent gold color with a thin white head. Smell is mostly of bitter hops, and a bit of sweet fruit. Taste is good, much like the effervescence of a pilsner with a gentle kiss of hops. There is an amazing balance of malts and hops in this beer, so that neither one is overpowering and both are delightful."
"a nice crisp bitterness, even a little resiny, medium to light bodied, carbonation is a bit lacking for me, it almost is a bit too flat tasting. it coats decently enough, the bitterness is quite nice but it seems lacking in overall flavor punch.. something is missing. it is not bad or anything just very average."
"Overall impression is that if you are in the mood for an IPA and this is around, you will enjoy it. It definitely does what it sets out to do, deliver hops and bitterness."
"Overall: I like this beer, but it is kind of just middle of the road. It is by no means bad, but it is nothing exceptional either. It is worth trying."
"12 oz. bottle with an awesome label of an old-school eastern hemisphere map complete with trade routes. It pours a bright colg with some sediment/haze and a 2 finger off-white head that leaves nice rings/sheets of lace. Smells of white grapefruit and sweet malts and the flavor adds to this apricot, light orange peel, and a heavy malt presence that is eventually dominated by the assertive bitterness from the piney/leafy hops. The body is medium and smooth and leaves a nice medium finish. Overall a good IPA, but not outstanding."
"Into a pint glass, pours a golden orange with a thick white head and very nice and almost excessive lacing. Pretty agressive pine aroma, citrus and grapefruit, good hop nose. Oh, also, little malt. Meh. Same thing with the taste, malts playing, like, 4th fiddle to the hops. So, basically, hops hops hops, wooptie doo. I like a hop bomb every once in a while, and this is a good hop bomb. Though I wish there were a little more to the mouth. Either way, a great beer to drink, one I'll have again for sure."
"notes- and ok IPA but not the best ive had. Not a session IPA for me though many arnt. for the price i would rather buy dogfish head 60 minute IPA but thats just me. Good brew all around better than most"
"-Oelergud"
"Pours out to a medium orange color with a consistant foamy head that held at about 1/2 inch. Some lace was present, but mostly chunks of astray bubbles. Medium to medium high carbonation. Aromas of light floral hops and earthy spices. Some sweet cherry liquorice as well. Taste was medium bodied, what I would call a budding hop-heads intro to IPA's. A touch of sweet bready malt quickly gives way to bitter hops and clove like spices. Mildly lingering bitterness is noted. Mouthfeel was eagerly bubbly. Drinkability is good. A solid IPA for sessioning, although it doesn't offer much in originality or creativity. Worth trying."
"This IPA pours a dark yellow/copper body with a 11/2 finger white head. Carbonation was present in the body of this beer. The beer gave off a strong hoppy aroma that was close a pine tree smell. I could only pick up very little hints of malts in the smell. The taste was mainly of the pine tree-esque hops but like the smell there was a slight sweet spot in the middle of the taste. The beer was a thin beer that finished semi-dry. It had a little to much of the residual sugars for my liking of this style of beer. It wasn't bad but nothing that I would write home about."
"D - A nice quaffable IPA, won;t blow your mind but has a nice hoppy flavor and won't overwhelm."
"In my opinion, when a really bitter, hoppy brew is a success, it is so not by virtue of the hops alone, but the other balancing aspects as well. Avery's regular IPA seemed a bit out of balance. Looked great, a nice golden hue with frothy, clinging head and good retention. Smelled decent, though the characteristic IPA aroma seemed just a bit subdued. Taste was good and by comparison to many other weak, puny IPA's, this guy is great, but like I said before, the bitter hops seemed a bit out of balance (don't get me wrong, Stone's Ruination is one of my favorite beers). Interestingly enough, I seem to remember the Maharaja as being out of balance in terms of it's alcoholic traits. Here, there wasn't enough interest from the other characteristics. It surprised me and did not go that well with my Indian dinner. This one's right up there, but a few tiers beneath the top."
"Pours a clear light caramel color. Frothy plumes of white head reach a good inch with nice sustain and tracing. Aromas are heavy on American hops with lots of resinous pine and grapefruit. Flavor comes just shy of meeting the promise of the aroma. Hop flavor is aplenty with a decent malty sweet backbone, but the bitterness doesn't meet my demands. This is certainly above your run of the mill IPA's but it doesn't quite compete with the upper tiered ones. It's nice to open a single that can't be got in town, drinkability is excellent."
"Light copper in color this IPA poured out with a one-finger cap that disappated rather quickly; light lacing clings to the glass. Lots of citrus on the nose most predominately grapefruit. Flavors feature a touch of biscuity malt up front but the grapefruit bitterness of the hops soon take over for a bitter middle and end. Nothing over the top though. Nice graininess in the mouthfeel, with a medium, slightly resinous body. This is a straight up sessionable IPA, probably Avery's finest mainline beer."
"Redolant with ripe citrus character in the form of grapefruit underlined by a healthy malt sweetness, this is a nicely balanced IPA, that doesn't rely solely on scorching the tastebuds with bitterness. Avery is sometimes a hit or miss for me, but this is a definite hit. Nice hop character paired with plenty of malts."
"Poured from a bottle into tulip glass. Color was a clear gold, thick three-finger head with lots of lacing. Aroma was light citrusy hop, very restrained. Was very effervescent. Taste was excellent, mild hop character that doesn't overwhelm the palate. Well balanced with some malt character. Avery is very drinkable, what I would call an excellent 'session' IPA, goes down very easy without overwhelming the palate."
"Cheers!"
"Overall it's great and would make an excellent session beer, but it could use some more hoppiness and fruitiness."
"A solid offering. Very flavorful session IPA. I will definitely have another."
"A very tasty and drinkable IPA."
"The body of the brew is a gold-to-lighter-gold color; nice, big white head topping it off. Fair amount of lacing. The scent is dominated by floral hops, accompanied by sweet malts. The taste breaks down into a fairly standard IPA- meaning dank. Great mix of hops dominating, again alongside some sweet malt. Hints of alcohol spice. Fairly thin body. Overall, as with most IPAs, pretty damn good."
"This IPA pours a golden orange with a nice white head. Immediate aroma of citrus fruit, predominantly grapefruiit, that carries over into the taste. The citrus taste, combined with just the right amount of hoppy bitterness and a hint of malt and alcohol, makes this very drinkable, with a great finish. Im only dissapointed that I have not seen this in package stores, and will have to enjoy at Taco Mac for the time being. I could drink a lot of these on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, and goes down well. Very sessionable."
"Drinkability- Very nice, would make a great session beer with some cheddar and grapes."
"Nice malt taste and sweet citrus hops followed quickly by the strong bite of bitterness. Long lingering herbal bitterness. Very drinkable. Tasty IPA one of the better I've had in awhile."
"Overall- Although I didn't think this IPA wasn't anything special it had more flavor than alot of IPA's I've tried. Good try. Just not my cup of tea."
"M&D: Super-smooth without being undercarbonated. One of the most drinkable IPAs I have had the opportunity to sample."
"For me, this ale was the first that just shouted ""grapefruity hops"". Because I like this light, bright hop variety, I rate the drinkability very high; this brew could be my favorite IPA in a bottle. I would love to find this ale on tap. Do I have to plan a trip to Boulder to find it?"
"Drinkability: Not my favorite of the style, but sure, I could drink a few of these. Could be more flavor and complexity overall, but I definitely enjoyed it."
"This beer is a crisp clear amber color, 1 cm or so bubbly white head that lasted throughout. Floral, fruity smell but definitely balanced with pine and resin scents. The taste was not quite what I expected after trying Avery's Maharaja, I was looking for a citrusy hop bomb. There were a lot of hops in this don't get me wrong, but they were much more ""balanced"" with pine resin and floral hop flavors as well as some citrus characters, but nothing over the top. The malt is fairly prominent in this beer too, the sweet pale malt almost has an apricot taste too is. This is a solid IPA, but I feel there are better out there."
"Notes: Yeah...I like this brew. Its good, far from outstanding, and up against some serious competition."
"Medium body, light to moderate carbonation. Nice example of the style, mild to moderate at best as the hops don't jump out at you like some examples. Easily sessionable."
"Overall, this is a nice IPA. Not the best one I've ever had, but certainly one that I will drink from time to time."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow body with a slight orange/amber cast and a nice crisp white head. Hop aroma is thick and savory, heavy on pine and dark citrusy overtones. Smells like cascades, possibly some centennials in there. Ah! Finally a nice hoppy attack to the sip. Bitter and bubbly with a grapefruity followup. Bitter aspect lasts into the aftertaste and leaves a bit of a dirty impression. Still, the initial hop aroma and flavor were so crisp and fresh that this beer could keep me going for hours."
"Mouthfeel."
"Pours a golden amber with an everlasting cascade of snow-white foam that leaves a trail from top to bottom. Nose is dominated by piney hops, grapefruit with some alcohol in the finish. Taste is resinous and oiky with bitter, piney hops, a bit of citric acidity and a modest malty balance. Mouthfeel is medium but flattens rather expediently with the cascade of bubbles to the top. A solid IPA."
"I thought this was a good beer. Not extremely hoppy but not too far to the English IPA side either, kind of in the middle. Is refreshing and well balanced, recommended!"
"I enjoyed this one. For the most part it's a basic IPA, but there's a hint of additional spicy flavour here and there that makes it a bit different. I say try it if you can."
"This beer pours a bright red-orange color. The head is huge, billowy and bright white. The aroma screams of citrus with a hint of grass underneath. The taste is a nice balance of cirtus and grass. It is a bit more grassy than the aroma, and a bit more complex. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, and oh so smooth. The carbonation is just enough to cut through everything without going overboard and detracting from the flavor. Overall, this is a very fine IPA, and I will certainly buy it again."
"Beautiful 1.5"" white head with good lacing and head retention. Nose was very aromatic with grapefruit and pine hops. Flavor was hop accented with malt trying to come through to balance. Long ticklish bitter aftertaste. Drinkablity was excellent, I easily downed four of these ales, probably one too many. This is an excellent, very true to style IPA. Highly recommended!"
"Mouth feel is medium in body and moderately carbonated."
"I will revisit this again in the near future. Hats off to Avery for all the great stuff that they brew. Life is good!"
"Dthis is a great IPA. Easy to drink and could have a few more. I wrote this review after drinking 3 of the 6 I bought (over the course of 2 days) and I have to say this is one of my favorites."
"This is VERY drinkable and refreshing ... perfect summer session beer."
"Far and away my favourite Avery beer.... this is simply a wonderful IPA that can easily compete with HopDevil and 60min."
"I had this the same night I tried Dale's Pale Ale. Poured a copper color with a one finger head. Nice hop aroma. Flavor of hops further on the back, tasting of grapefruit. A bit oily up front, which made it smooth but not as enjoyable as Dale's hop bomb. Solid brew, but not the usual hop fix I expect from an IPA."
"The body is fairly thick and syrupy. Over the top. Yep, it's Avery. I wouldn't want to drink more than 2 of these in a session just because of those syrupy hops, though it's good in small doses."
"Poured a golden yellow hue with a thick pearl white head which didn't stick around too long. A fresh and inviting hop scent with floral/grassy/almost minty hints are present. Appears to be mildly carbonated, with a good balance on the hop side with mildly detectable light malts. Overall, a very smooth flavor that finishes clean. No overpowering hops here, but they clearly make their presence known. A(very) tasty brew here, and while nothing clearly stood out about it, I would definitely like to have easier access to this one. Recommended!"
"This is definitely out of the American IPA mold so folks who are used to the English style just realize that and you won't likely be bummed out..."
"mouthfeel is pretty light. its slightly watery in my opinion which is suprising considering its hazy appearance. all in all a good brew though, and very drinkable. nice light grapefruity IPA."
"I found this a ""OK"" IPA, i did like it but i think this one bottle will be enough for me tonight."
"Maybe I'm just going above and beyond my expectations for an IPA now that the Cap is Popped. Avery IPA is solid all around and a great selection for the style. It's not real exciting though or overly hoppy. Nice copper tone, a bit of sparkle on the tongue, little head. Will get this one again."
"Peaches? Is this #9 nope. Hmm... Peaches anyone else. Well it has a light body gives a good with head and lots of lace. I smell peaches and a little bit of feet and lots of yeast. No feet in the taste thankfully and the peaches flavor is tamped down by the emergence of alcohol and some sweetness from the malt. I am not sure what I make of this, but it is pretty good but not what I would call an IPA. Still an easy drinker with a midling mouthfeel."
"Pungent kind bud hoppy aroma. very light tea color with a large fluffy white head. Big citrusy hop flavors, but you can taste a lot of malty/grain flavors beneath that. Finishes with a bit of floral sweetness and then leaves a bitter aftertase. A nicely done basic IPA."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice drinking beer all around. A very well executed IPA."
"Others have described this one quite well... on the spicy side, not a hop monster... the bitter finish is a bit over done for my taste. Not amazing, not bad. This is how I've felt about most other Avery brews I've tried. I'll keep trying their stuff but revisits aren't too likely."
"Clear amber-nice lace. Extremely hoppy smell it burns slightly and has elements of pine and citrus. There is also a slightly rotting wood smell too. Pure hoppiness in taste- very puckerish mouthfeel. Exactly what a decent American IPA should taste like. Not extremely drinkable as it is just a tad too belchy."
"drinkability: ehh"
"A very enjoyable and drinkable IPA. This one hit the spot and had such a balance it could be had all night. Nothing poking thru too much, with the flavors all blended and contributing to complimenting each other."
"Recommended"
"Pours a clear golden color, some carbonation, small head, nice lacing through out the drink. Scents of hops, citrus, and pine. The taste is very nice of sweet, bitter flavor. Nice aftertaste. Not as bitter as other IPAs, but very nice. Medium body. Very drinkable. A nice offering from Avery. Would recommend."
"Light golden color with a thick foamy head that lumps up as is diminishes. Extensive thick lacing that clings to the glass. Smell of citrus and pine oils. Piney taste isn't as strong as the smell but still gives adequate ipa kick. Bitterness on the back end has a slight metalic note to it that is slightly unpleasant but not enough to ruin a good beer. A nice drinkable beer that is worth a try."
"This beer came a foggy dark gold with a dimpled foam rubber, slightly off white head that left some very nice lace. Smelled very piney with a bit of sweet nectarines. Tasted of a honey mandarin orange sweet malt with a surprisingly dry bite. Finished strongly of grapefruit rinds with a bit of bread dough. The duration of this dryness in the finish was alarming, but not entirely unpleasant. Hop burps revealed a fruitiness that I didnt detect elsewhere. The mouth feel was medium bodied with a light unobtrusive carbonation, but it left a bit of a film in my mouth on the finish. This is an immensely enjoyable beer, but the finish is a bit much in its dry potency and sticky residual film."
"This is a very balanced brew, not one for extreme hop heads to run out and buy but may be for the novice, also would be a good session beer."
"A tasty beer, would go great with cheese and crackers, but not really an IPA in my opinion."
"I first reviewed the Avery IPA a year ago, and I think either my taste buds have changed or their recipe has. While it pours a carbonated dark gold--and still very clear--it's much more flavorful now, with distinct grapefruit citrus at the front of the palate and an outstanding bready finish. Did I just miss this?"
"Sweet hoppy smell with carbonation with a backbone but not too much to bite. Great aftertaste leaving a sweet yet not overpowering bitter taste of a great beer. Kind of reminds me of my first ale homebrew but more hearty. An ideal brew to accompany any meal. I will be drinking more of this beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Recommend you give it a try."
"A pleasurable IPA. Worthy of purchasing a six-pack."
"Clear pale amber with a finger and a half of uneven creamy head sticking to the sides of the glass. Citrusy herbal hop nose witha hint of summer grass, not freshly mown. Malts are very light and bready, overlaid by assertively resinous and herbal hops. Perhaps a little more balance, a little more matl and a hint fo sweeteness would really aid this. The hops DO NO need to be subdued, but a little more malt backbone to support them would be nice. Moderately light body and light carbonation. Just some more malt would make this pick up a whole point on drinkability!"
"Thanks again, Avery!"
"Overall an overwhelmingly fun IPA to drink. More then one will be needed as its citrusy dry nature and clean, snappy drinkability won't be a problem as it glides down with ease. One of Avery's better beers."
"Very nice IPA, very easy to drink. An extremely good example of the style. Glad I have more than 1 in my possession!"
"A refreshing and very tasty IPA."
"A very good IPA..not quite standout caliber, but very typical of the American style, and fits nicely into what I'd like all IPAs to be. If it were available here, I'd drink this all the time. Find it, buy it..it's as simple as that."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, rolling, and very friendly in the mouth. Awesome burps without the aggression of a DIPA, as you might be familiar with... the ones that not only offend others but yourself as well. The most drinkable IPA I have tried yet, and I will be making this a staple in the fridge."
"Amber/orange in color, with thin but resilient head. Smells of bitter hops, floral and citrus. In the mouth, pine and a definite note of cedar join the citrus hops, but flowers still take first chair. Bittering hops are overwhelming. This is clearly a definitive example of not only an American IPA, but American hops as well. This is not a subtle beer. It shouts bitter and aggressive hops and it is excellent."
"This one pours a hazy, orange-bronze color with a nice long-lasting head. The smell is terrific. Loaded with citrus scents and a nice blend of bitter and floral hops, this one has the makings of a winner already. The taste is great. Strong hop density and an ass-kicking tart citrus flavor in the finish. Finishes a little dirty, that aftertaste just seems to linger and linger forever. A fair amount of carbonation and a medium-bodied texture make up the mouthfeel. Drinkability is good as well. The next time I pick this one off the shelf, I'm going to grab more than just one. Good beer."
"Overall this is a nice hoppy, yet creamy I.P.A. Very good citrus presence, and drinkable bitterness is there as well. A very sessionable beer on the whole."
"The beer feels quite smooth, with a subtle carbonation. Overall, a very solid representation of the style."
"Overall: I like this IPA. I think Avery, in general, gets knocked for their aggressiveness. If big hops are for you, then Avery IPA is a good choice. This one beer I wouldn't turn down."
"The color is golden copper with plenty of tiny bubbles for carbonation. The head is average-sized, but retains nicely. The aroma is of strong citris and floral hops, with a nice underlying malt sweetness. The hop flavors here are almost perfect. A sip starts with twangy citris hop that carries on strongly throughout leaving a wonderful, long-lasting finish. Midway through Avery IPA becomes sweeter as the tasty underlying malts make their presence felt. Bitterness seems to increase towards the finish along side a new dry hop flavor. This IPA is exactly what I want from the style, plenty of zesty hop flavor, with plenty of complexity, and an assertive malt presence for balance. This is one of my favorite IPAs to date."
"As the liquid entered the glass it presented itself as an orange amber, slightly cloudy beverage with a modest head that clung to the sides as it were glue. Scent is bread-like with a piney hoppiness. Taste is desert dry with only a background of maltiness. The finish is even drier, if possible, and makes one crave for the next taste. One of these is enough, but I did enjoy it."
"Medium-light bodied, goes down rather smooth. Slight sticky-sweet taste left behind each sip. Quite drinkable. I could handle a few of these. Lace clinging all over the pint glass. I'm looking forward to the rest of the six-pack."
"The taste was predominately hoppy but well balanced with malts. Aftertaste is mostly hops with a little bit of a bite. This beer would make a great session IPA, and I have a feeling that it will become one of my regulars. Highly recommended for any hop head."
"Give it a shot if you dig hops."
"Even though mine only had to travel from Colorad to Arizona, it was apparent this beer definitely could make the long journey from chilly England to sunny India. But like a young red wine, it definitely mellowed and opened up a minute or two after poured Its hop and alchol content make it as stirdy beer and excelent example of an IPA. Pours a deep yellow, with a decent white head that remained almost as long a the beer. Its aroma is slightly piney, feels effervescent in the mouth and finises with a bitter but floral hop flavor."
"Aroma of piney grapefruit from ample cascade hops. Medium body and dextrinous round mouthfeel. Hops and biscuit malt flavors vie with cascades covering the hops. Pure pleasure for the hop lover. Grapefruit pith with mandarin orange flavors abound. Dry finish starting with citrus then pine then fading to bitter."
"This brew is a lightly cloudy pale orange color with a thin off-white head. Sticky patches of lacing. Good amount of grapefruit and hops in the nose. Medium-bodied with a tart mandarin orange and hops flavor, along with a decent malt backbone. The finish is hoppy and lingering. Pretty impressive when its all said and done."
"Beer pours a crystal clear, golden amber body. There's a nice foamy off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Good hoppy nose, but not huge. slightly buttery, but not too much. Slight lemon aroma, lots of malt. Wow, lots of hop flavor! Not overly bitter, hops are nicely balanced between flavor and bitterness. Great feel in the mouth, not too slick, very refreshing. Very good IPA, definitely one to try."
"Super smooth and drinkable IPA here. This brew pulls off the IPA hat trick of combining strong hop flavor while avoiding harsh astringency and bitterness. A great all round beer."
"Tastes divine. Hoppy flavors nicely balanced with, perhaps dominating, the hop bitter and supported by an underlying sweet. Wonderful burp, iron and grapefruit pith. Second taste starts grapefruit pith with oranges. The swallow is all oranges with hop bitter and some co-humulone roughness. The oranges settle leaving a rough aftertaste in the back of the throat with a malt sweet persisting on the flat of my tongue, as well as a hint of grapefruit pith. Ha, and I thought this beer would be a quickie 3.8 session beer review. Okay, so the hops are oranges, grapefruit pith, a bit of iron, and some tangerine. Searching for esters I get very little, maybe some apricot. BTW, it's been at least 15 minutes (the beer is warmed) and there is still a half finger of head. What else to look for...malts. Malts are much beneath the hops but provide a sweetness that fill the beer. A hint of honey. Alcohol flavor and burn is absent. Md body, but really lusious and velvety in the mouth. Carbonation is md-heavy, a bit too much, IMO. Lacing on the inside of my glass is astounding. It's a sheet of white bubble plastered on the far side of my glass. Drinkable?...yes. I'm a beer explorer and just don't see the purpose of trying a beer a second time. Honestly, I suspect I'll stop into the brewery to pick up this beer on my way home from work enough to make it a semi-regular in my life. Thank goodness the brewery is on the road between work and home."
"A good solid IPA for sure. The beer looked great with a great fluffy white head on top of a nice light amber colored brew. The smell was quite hoppy and fruity as well, with nice pinnapple notes and a healthy dose of Cascade in there as well. The flavor reminded me alot of the local AleSmith IPA which I know very well. The beer had a great bite to it and it was balanced well with the malts, but it had a little too much bread-y flavor in the finnish for me. All in all I think it is a very strong IPA, but not that unique in the scheme of things."
"Incredibly light colored body for an IPA, more of a dark gold color, than a copper color than an IPA usually is. Head is nice and large, though, about 3/4", which fades slowly. Nice fruity/piney hop smell, which really ndominates the nose, spot on. Taste also has a considerable amount of hop presence, but does have just a tinge of the mleted plastic flavor that is in some IPAs, but not enough to take away from the pleasant flavor. Nice malty backbone, a very good example. Good mouthfeel, slightly metallic aftertaste."
"Drinkability- One of the more hoppier IPA's I've had. Has a decent enough amount of malt to be just considered balanced. One of the first beers I would go to if in the mood for a hop fix."
"Pours a medium copper color with a nice full white head. Smells of pine needles and citrus. Tastes citrusy, with a grapefruit prominence. Very similar to stone ipa and bells two hearted ale, yet lacking in the bite that those 2 have. Overall, an excellent ipa."
"For fans of citrusy hops, this one's a winner!"
"Overall, I dig this beer."
"Appearance is a transparent amber-red, with a short lived head. Aroma has a fruit cocktail of pineapple and sharp citrus, followed by pine and hops. Initial taste contains bitter hops that are delicious. Medium mouthfeel with just-right carbonation. Good job!"
"Pours a nice light orange color and makes a really thick frothy head. Aroma is light caramel malt, bit of citrus orange. Flavor is excessively bitter, very one sided, only subtle hints of what were suggested in the nose are available as the bitter bitter hops rue the day... it is actually kind of harsh and unpleasant. Medium body, leaves a slight coating on the palate. Sadly, the harsh characteristics in the flavor just don't do it for me. I'll take the Maharaja over this one 10 times out of 10."
"Yeah, it is ?? Something to get ya thinking about the hazy amber pour, good head and nice lacing. Yep, hop city dominated by floral, citrus and pine. Really pops you in the mouth on the taste too, along with some grassy notes. Had a somewhat sour aftertaste that I didnt care for  might be tough to make this a session brew. Medium bodied, sticky and well carbed."
"Pours a big foamy head that stays for the entire session. The floral hop aroma (cascade?) is blistful. You could smell this concoction for an hour. The taste unforunately is not on the same line. Though decent not mind blowing. There is a metallic undertone that deters from this brew. The color is magnificent; the golden copper hue is brilliant to the eye. A session IPA nontheless."
"12 ounce bottle. Clear light copper colored with a huge head. Clumps of foam stick to the side of the glass. Potent grapefruit hops in the aroma. The flavor is malty at first, but then turns extremely bitter. The hops are not just bitter, but plenty flavorful. The hops are a bit spicy in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium. This is a good IPA. Not merely intense, it's also got the flavor."
"This beer seems somewhat of a conundrum. The nose has that American, up-front dry hopped thing going on. Then, the drink is a nice, crisp bitterness, subdued and well supported by the maltiness. It's somewhere between English and American, leaning slightly towards American. Then again, I've been drinking alot of Stone lately."
"The mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation. I think this is a great IPA."
"Drinkability: Ahhh...this is my kind of IPA. A perfect balance of citrus hop and carmel sweetness. I know that this isn't a requirement for an IPA to taste this way but I sure love it when they do. Strongly recommended."
"Full, but not thick mouthfeel. One of the more sessionable IPAs."
"Wonderfull poorout with everlasting head and great bronze beercolor. Nose is a delicasy of hops; very aromatic and very good, wonderfull american styles but probably also some of Germany or Tjech. Taste is good having body, litle sweet, and citrussy that stays with quiet a bitter aftertaste. Great mouthfeel and yes if I hadmore in the fridge I certainly would go to get me another one!"
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head, laces around the glass. Smells of floral hops but the malty backbone is very detectable. Its likewise with the taste. Little bit of hops but I taste mostly malt, very rich, with a little smooth bitterness. This beer really coats the tongue, the carbonation is nice and its pretty fullbodied. A tasty brew, could be more hoppy but I enjoy it nonetheless."
"It's not a matter of balance that gives me pause here. I can appreciate uneveness. Rather, it's the herky-jerk transitions and sparse, almost faceless aroma that weight against this beer. It delivers in a staccato fashion, which is manageable when the components have more character, but here it's just muddled. That said, it's not totally without its merits. In spite of the stop-and-go delivery, it is nonetheless crisp, drying the palate nicely, as it should. I'll finish what's in my fridge, and I won't really mind doing it, but there will be no curtain call."
"Drinkability: Yes. I have the ability to drink, and yes I would drink these up till the cows come home. At which time, I would offer them one and pour myself another."
"Overall an excellent rendition of an IPA, somewhat balanced and quite drinkable."
"If you're in the mood for a good hoppy IPA, check this one out."
"Really a very nice session beer. Perfect balance of big malt and big hop. Sort of reminded me of a session beer version of stone ruination IPA. Another great standard from Avery."
"Believe it or not, this is my first Avery beer! A sixer of this was actually cheaper than a sixer of Alpha King and I'm in Indiana. This one poured a light orange/golden with a very nice frothy white head although a large percentage of the bubbles were soapy looking. Aroma is obviously hop-centric. I get a mix of citrus and pine. Taste is very crisp and clean with that nice edginess of hops. Some caramel tasting malt lies in the background. Good drinkability. This is not a blow the doors off type IPA but a session type IPA that matches up great with the BBQ chicken pizza that I'm having for dinner (yeah for college diets). I will be reviewing more Avery products in the future."
"Yellow-orange pour with a huge rocky head. One of the best heads I've ever coaxed out of an IPA, and it stuck around and left tons of lace as it slid down the glass. After that look, the rest of the beer was something of a comedown. The aroma was lightly hopped with lots of biscuity malts. The flavor itself is kind of weak for the style. All of the hallmarks are in there: grapefruity hops, solid malt backbone, and a little bite, but they're all pretty subdued and nothing really catches your imagination. Overall, a decent enough brew that won't destroy your palate, but there's easily dozens of American IPAs out there that are much more creative and interesting than this one."
"just my luck...found this on tap at the Union Brew House in Weymouth, MA the very next day. No need to review...just a nice coincidence for me."
"This one pours a standard yellow color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of a little caramel malt, but has a huge presence of dirty hops. Smells like shoes. The flavor has a bit more of the malt character, but that smelly hop flavor is there. I didn't care much for this one."
"Visiting this beer again after a while. Thaks to clvand0 for sharing. It pours a rather pale orange color with only a slight head on it. The nose is not necessarily good. Its got a little of the dirty old sock smell to it. I'm not so impressed here. The flavor is better than the nose would say, but I would put this as an APA over an IPA. It has a decent residual bitter on my tongue. The feel is fairly thick, with a minimal carbonation. This is definately not in my top IPA's. I really don't like the aroma on it."
" Mouthfeel is medium and finish is long and drenched in tangerine hops. I don't know why this beer doesn't get higher marks, it's awesome!"
"Wish I had another..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the clear golden brew. Head is resilient, with great lacing. Aroma is all pine and citrus. Taste is has a bit of a malt start, but that quickly is overpowered by the hops character, which seems to be more bitterness, and less the pine and citrus notes portended in the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit too to clunky with its hops character, in my mind, and drinkabilty suffers the same. But if you're in the MORE HOPS party, this will probably be more appreciated by you. Enjoyable, yes, but could be more so."
"A very clean golden amber ale. Has a big creamy white head with a pretty lace. Aroma is a very assertive hops both citrusy and spicey. The flavor starts out with the same assertive hops character. There is a dry hop finish that has a light hint of toasted malt to round out the flavor."
"The label of this bottle has a map of Europe and Asia, with a red line mapping the course from India to England. A single 12 oz bottle poured a clear gold and orange into my pint glass. Not much of a head at all though there is a white lacing. This IPA smells strong of hops and makes me realize it's been to long since I've drank an IPA. This one tastes more on the citrus side than the pine side of the IPA fence, a grapefruit flavor is most prominent. Carbonation is good, not too bubbly not too flat.I think I could put back a few of these no doubt. Avery puts out a quality IPA for sure."
"Very nice."
"Mediocre IPA, nothing really bad but certainly better examples available."
"Im Glad to see this brewer appearing in TN. I also enjoy the label depicting the long journey from England, around Africa to India. I poured the 12oz single into my trusty Sierra Nevada tumbler pint. The brew is perfectly clear, the body amber with a hint of straw color. The pour resulted in an aggressive, sticky, white head, nice strands of lace and great retention. The nose is great. The hops are green, juicy, leafy, citrussy, piney and sticky, the full compliment of a great IPA, these aromas are of course backed up with a respectable sweet malt backbone which combined with the hops is reminiscent of a ripe juicy cherry. Up front its lightly sweet and slick, quickly though the bitterness of the large dose of hops takes hold, not bitter enough to hurt you but assertive. In the finish the bitterness fully unfurls and is accompanied mainly by citrus flavors, but a nice dollop of pine sap as well which retains a lovely after-taste. Very well balanced, in that IPA kind of way. Is there alcohol in this? I sure cant taste it. Mouthfeel is good, but maybe a tad on the light side. No doubt this is a great IPA, glad to have it available around here!"
"Pours a light gold with a beautiful head and nice lacing. Smell is citrus with yeasty undertones...mmmm. Taste is initially sweet with the hops kicking in at mid-palate...finishing with a nice hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit light and not overly harsh. Smoothness of the brew makes it very drinkable. A nice IPA."
"A dark orangy amber color with nice head and lacing. Smell, unlike a lot of those west coast hop monsters, is more floral and sweet smelling. Nice grassy tones as well. Taste is much similar; very mellow, a tad sweet with nice malts backing up the hops. Definately hoppy though - hits you with a bitter slap towards the finish. Great smooth mouthfeel and I've never come across an IPA that isn't extremely drinkable, this one included."
"Edit: A quick check of the Avery website shows that the hop content is: Columbus, Styrian Goldings, and Centennial"
"Drinkability: Crisp and refreshing, a spry IPA for those who like their IBUs"
"Maybe that's why I find myself ordering this beer, over and over again."
"Lighter in color than many IPAs nowadays, it is a coppery gold hue with a hint of tawny influences. Really tiny bubbles raced towards the off-white head, this added a little life to the beer. The foam reached two fingers in height; it slowly faded to a rocky, soapy cap, a half finger in height. Lacing started before any liquid was removed, I always love to see that! Once I started drinking the beer subsequent lacing really flourished. Attractive. The nose is hoppy. Fairly raw with citrus acid infused with pine combs and spruce. Grapefruit rinds are secondary and these play with a sugary sweetness. Minimal malt influences, only hints of caramel, very weak throughout. Potency is solid, plenty of juice, suggestions of alcohol, kind of hot, raw too. I like the nose; it is no more extraordinary than many really good IPAs. Inviting. The palate is very enjoyable; upfront is a soft, sprucey influence with pine needles and some malt sweetness. The middle is hoppy, assertive but not out of whack, grapefruit rinds, lemon zest, leafy, kind of dry. Then the finish flashes quickly, a juicy burst of malt and acidic hops, some alcohol, some hints of mint leaves. Pleasant. The aftertaste is dry and bitter. This would really play nice with some sharp cheddar cheese or burgers. It is an IPA and the hops are the focal point, as well they should be, but its not some crazy, raw, hop bomb. It is a really well brewed American IPA. Once warm, a very lovely, sweetness develops but the hops, in turn, fade. Oh, well. Medium/medium-full in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is solid, while its nothing special it is very pleasant. Incredibly drinkable. A well crafted hoppy beer from Avery? Who knew they had it in them? Id gladly buy a six-pack, sit back, and quaff! I purchased a 12-ounce bottle in Brookfield, WI. Recommended. I want more."
"Fluffy, down pillow 1/7-inch head at start. Golden yellow hue with walkabout hallucinatory bubble flow; krystal-clear. Hop vine cut fresh with resin dripping flow to nose; just want to ball it up between my thumb and forefingers. Bitter crank of Bartleby the Scrivener hop bite that judders between my cavities, with just a touch of rounding, searching citrus juice to taste. Medium-sized body; would have at least one more pour, though the jacked hops definitely wear on the palate."
"Had on tap during the BBF post-party at Big City. Gold dubloon in color, it came topped with a white sticky head, that stayed in the glass as I drank it done. Aroma came across as slightly brassy, but mostly all citrus. Mouthfeel was decent, with prickly carbonation. Low malt, though present, my notes indicate there was some bitterness in the mostly citrus hop finish. Decent."
"I first had this beer earlier this fall while on vacation in Denver, Unfortunately, I didnt have the opportunity to make notes. When I saw this on display at Martys in Newton, MA I bought a six-pack immediately, and am enjoying a pint as I write this. This comes from the bottle a bright copper/gold. Thin cream colored head and just a light lace are left on the glass. Brewers from the Denver area seem to get the nose right on an IPA. This has a bright floral hop character with just a hint of citrus, maybe some pine. The taste has a delicate bitterness in the front accented by the floral characters that were on the nose. No real malt to speak of, nor is this beer accented by alcohol. It is truly defined by the hops used in the brew. It has a great silky smooth mouth feel, and I can drink may of these fine beers. I typically like an IPA with a bit more balance, but this hoppy brute can quickly change my mind."
"Pours out a golden orange color with a nice white head that settles to a strong collar within a few minutes. Leaves some pretty good lacing down the sides of the glass. Excellent clarity. Aroma is fairly complex with citrus, floral hops, and yeast notes. Taste is bursting with hop bitterness (reminescent of orange peel) and some nice mild malts for balance. Definitely characterized by the hops though. Mouthfeel is pretty good, but not the strongest characterization of this offering. Drinkability suffers ever so slightly due to the strong bitterness, but overall this is a very good beer that is definitely worth a try. True to the style, the hop bitterness dominates its character."
"On-Tap @ Big City. Orange with a fluffy white head that lasts. The aroma is very hoppy with some nice zesty citrus notes in the mix as well. The taste is very hoppy up front with some citrus flavors and some nice biscuity malt flavors on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and drinkability is good as well. A nice example."
"Woah, where did all that maltiness go? Some malt flavors up front, but the hops are the story here. BIG and bitter. Piney-bitter tidal wave that numbs the tongue. Medicinal and soothing. Big body, mouth-coating/puckering feel. Not that balanced (even for an IPA), but I dont mind."
"Light apricot color with a chunky inch high head of meringue. Big aroma of sweet citrusy hops - oranges and tangerines. Pungent flavor of oranges and grapefruit, with an orange peel and pine finish. Hoppy bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is round and smooth, fills the whole mouth. A little tingly in the finish. Orange peel bitterness and tingle rises up the back of my throat to my nose. Not too much malt, but a whole lot of citrus from all the citrus fruits all around this one. Thanks to Brent for sharing."
"It pours golden-orange with a thick white head, making for a promising opening. Things hold up fairly well in the smell, with citrusy hops dominating almost completely. The decline continues in earnest in the taste. Grapefruit hoppiness is strong and not well-supported by the weak malt backbone. The overall impression is just flat and a bit boring for an IPA. It also seems just a bit thin for an IPA. Maybe I have an inherent aversion to Avery products."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy at the start, with a short dry bitter finish. Drinkability is high, and overall a very enjoyable IPA."
"This is an excellent IPA. Pale copper/amber cross, clear with a nice soupy white head with a touch of yellow in the foam. The aroma is a very complex hop profile. Youve got pepper, citrus and pine all meshed together in a sinus-tingling mix. The flavor is fairly dry but manages to barely keep away from the all hop, no malt unbalancing of some IPAs. Theres still enough malt flavor in here to support the hops and bitterness despite it being very highly attenuated. Excellent IPA that excites the nose and tongue."
"This is a full-bodied cleansing experience in the mouth. It is slighty thick in texture and, of course, there is a lingering bitterness. I could drink a few of these. In fact, I bought a case to allow myself that pleasure."
"Another new brewery in Iowa. Beer store recommended the IPA. I can see why. This is a very nice drink. Pours dark gold with nice head and good lace. Citrusy nose. Nice and hoppy with a grapefruit flair. Very smooth mouthfeel with nice aftertaste. A very nice IPA"
"This is a very good India Pale Ale. I picked it up on a recent trip to North Carolina. Unfortunately it is not available in West Tennessee. I will have to ration the 3 remaining from the sixer."
"Dark and cloudy, looks kind of like unfiltered heavy apple cider. Strong hop taste but not overpowering, not too complex as you can't really taste much except the hops (maybe a wee bit of malt), smooth and drinkable however it hits you with a bit of a delayed aftertaste, heavily bitter. A good beer, except for...the smell. I'm sure it's just me, and I tried to stay objective on this, but the smell of these hops reminded me of a cat-piss stain we used to have in the corner of our living room in San Diego. Smells like ammonia, or as CheeseWheel put it ""an old man's couch after too many accidents."" Mouthfeel was great, more noticeable probably since I was holding my nose. I tried to shake this but just couldn't, it really detracted from my drinking experience but hopefully not yours, if you are a hop-head that picks this up and thinks it smells great you'll probably like it."
"Too much to have more than one of two probably, but strangely balanced in an extreme way."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head. The aroma is great. It has a nice floral hop scent laid over a complex pale malt, etc. foundation. The taste is awesome. It has a very powerful floral hop character. It overshadows it's pale malt core. It drinks easy and finishes with a very bitter dry hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine IPA. It's full of hops, just the way I like it."
"Unfortunately, the taste failed to live up to the promise in any way. All I could taste was bitterness. No malt flavors, no hop flavors, just bitterness. Extremely disappointing. I won't be ordering this again."
"Drinkability: Average IPA for my tastes. Lingering bitterness was surprising from what I heard was a good beer. Will have to try again..."
"The excellent balance makes for great drinkability. Solid IPA."
"Wierd beer. Poured very pale for an IPA. Almost a lemony yellow. No real head fromed after the pour. There was a slight lace, but it dissolved rather quickly. However, what was surprsing was that for its rather pale color, it was quite hoppy. Very bitter and biting. Also hints of citrus were hanging around the beer. My only complaint was that it was very cold when served and the flavors only improved as the beer warmed up. Not so much a fault of the brewer as the bar manager."
"Beautiful golden color with a nice ivory colored lace that follows to the end of the glass. With a floral/grapefruity flavor this beer is easily drinkable and something I could never tire of easily. A super hoppy and refreshing beer that carries flavor throughout.Has a bit of a skunky bite towards the end and a flavor that will stick with your palate for a bit. A great and light IPA."
"Pours a yellowish orange with a nice rich head that last through the whole glass. Leaves a nice froth lace on the glass at you drink it. Flavor hasa stong and sweet hop flavor with hints of raisin. As with a lot of IPAs the hop flavor drowns out any other noticable flavor. Drinks very smoothly for an IPA and leaves a pleasant after taste of the hop oils."
"Pours a golden orange with a nice big head that eventually falls to ring of foam with floaters that leaves a healthy dose of lacing. Aroma is mostly hops floral and touch of citrus grapefruity aroma thrown in. Taste is malt with a big hop flavor and a good hop bite. It is crisp and refreshing leaves a good coating on your tounge. This brew is all about hops mouthfeel is a good medium, a drinkable brew that hits the spot. One of the better regular IPA's I have had. If you haven't tried it pick up a sixer, you will not be disappointed."
"The taste is nice and very well balanced. Sweet and bitter meld themselves together into a perfect balance of flavor. Fruity with a sharp floral hoppy bite towards the end that continues through the finish. Solid body of malt holds the beer together. This is really a fabulous IPA. Highly drinkable and not too overbearing, or heavy. Really just right."
"Very drinkable and Very delicious. I just heard avery is moving into the nyc market, and hopefully they'll bring some of this here. I'd stock my fridge and put it next to the HSA and HopDevil."
"A fantastic IPA from Avery. A nice grapefruit hop that coats the mouth nicely. Quite good, and one I'd be glad to see again."
"Big, creamy, white, dense, bubbly head. Rocky collapse. Sticky lacing. Clear, amber beer with fine carbonation. Huge stinky hops in the nose. Some sour, nutty stuff, some ink and bread. Stinky hops persist through the front with rotten/burnt nuts and some grapefruit. Full middle, a little watery tasting, bitter. Nice roasted nutty, bitter finish. Not bad. I like the nuts in the finish, but they're a little ""off"" elsewhere. It's a little nicer and milkier when warm. A decent, hoppy beer, but there are too many better ones in the field."
"12 ounce bottle, pours light golden amber, healthy carbonation, white head and lucious well develped lacing. Full hoppy nose. Flavor profile starts with a full jolt of grainy, resiny hops, and leads to grapefruit,honey and melon. Very dry on the tongue, luxorious in the finish. A fine hoppy, dry, crisp and satisfying american IPA. Well done and Brew on ! Avery...ah what a brewery..."
"Wow, I have to say this is one of those beers that turns out to be just what you're looking for. Picked up a couple bottles in LA last week, now I'm wishing I'd picked up many more. Pours out a bronzey color, just a bit of orange tint, and capped with a very long lasting pure white head. Aroma is dripping with pine sap and grapefruit. Taste is bitter, bitter, and oh did I mention bitter? This IPA is a hophead's dream, with loads of fresh brutal piney hop flavor assaulting you from all directions. A few grapefruits bouncing around in there too. A decent amount of malt sweetness through the middle helps balance this one a bit, but my taste buds are already more than subdued by the hops. Very impressive, very drinkable IPA in my opinion, but very bold in the hop bitterness department."
"There is a ton going on in this beer, and I am still unsure if that is loud and brash, or simply a complex cornicopia of delicious aspects. I think its a little of both."
"Beer is good. Happy IPA beering."
"This is slightly different take on the American IPA style. Less crystal malt gives this beer a malt character I like, without the chewy sweetness found in a lot of American IPAs. The level of hopping is fairly standard for an American IPA, but comes off as a bit coarse in the intial attack and aftertaste."
"This beer holds a special place in my heart because my wife is happy when I bring it home. Good good stuff, and one of my favorite IPAs."
"Clear copper colored liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a while. There was a good amount of lace on the glass. Smell was very citrusy, grapefruit to be specific. Must be cascades in there I would think. Taste was a sweet, toasty malt followed by a good amount of hop bitterness. Nice and citrusy with a dry finish. Mouthfeel seemed a little thin, but the carbonation was right on. Overall, I thought this was a very good IPA. I am enjoying Avery products more and more. I would certainly have another one."
"This is a fantastic IPA. Flood of citrusy hops, with a good malt balance behind. Nice, good bite to it, but not at all overpowering or bitter like many IPA's can be. This is one of the best IPAs I have ever had, and I hope I remember to buy it again in 6-pack form."
"Clear amber appearance, just a bit creamy. Aroma is grapefruit & something else that I really don't care for (still trying to figure this out). Tastes crisp, citrusy, & almost too refreshing. Malts are definitely on the back burner in this one, but what is there is sweet & fruity. Medium bodied and dry with a great hop aftertaste. Damn good."
"Avery IPA: A very vigorous pour did not result in much head, and what it had was fairly lame, leaving very little lace. The beer appears to be very clear, with very minimal haze, and a light amber color. What it lacks in head, however, it more than makes up for in aroma. Wonderful hoppy aroma, very floral/citrus. The taste is very nice as well, extremely hoppy, with crisp snappy bites of hops, and a minimal understated note of malts laying a nice base. But this one is all about the hops, and is extremely flavorful. Very nice."
"Drinkable? Shee ... give me another one of those."
"This beer tastes great, and burps even better."
"12oz Bottle No Date.This IPA poured a clear golden color with a thick snow white head that sticks to the glass. Beautiful hop aroma that is fruity with notes of peaches and grapefruit. Body is smooth with a slick mouthfeel. The flavor is an absolutely delicious blend of hops and malt. Lots of citrus and a good dose of bittering hops make this a winner. If Avery would ever come to Florida, I would never thirst for a good brew."
"Flavor is at first spicy with a bright hop character like sandalwood. The malt body comes up in the middle with a soft approach that is just enough to cut through the bitter before a softer finish of hops break on to keep the tongue with just a touch of spice through for th next sip."
"Tried this for the first time in Arizona in a bottle (bought it at Sun Devil Liquor in Mesa) and then had it on tap at the Arizona Brew Festival. It tasted much different and a great deal better on tap. Then I found some here in Southern California in bottles but I'm not liking it all that much. It pours a very light amber-yellow in color. What strikes me about it is the bitterness. Not overwhelmingly bitter, but it does take a while for the malt to smooth it out. It does have a fairly complex taste, one that I'm unaccustomed to. Hmmm. Not too sure about this one."
"A very different IPA, compared with others that I've had. Pours a nice Yellow/Orange color, nice head, nice lacing and head retention. Smells slightly fruity. The taste is overpoweringly bitter. Not a grapefruit bitter, and not a floral bitter, but just bitter. Out of balance as well, no malt flavor comes though. Just, well bitter. Mouthfeel is okay, nothing special. As far as drinkablilty, I don't know if I will even finish this one, let alone as for another."
"The beer poured a light copper., very clear with a nice fluffy white head that lasted a fairly long time. The hops left a nice grassy aroma which was noticable but not so strong that it burns out the nostrils. The maltiness was present in the nose but at a low level. The grapefruit taste of the hops comes through loud and clear but does not completely overpower the malts. The malt sweetness acts as a counterpoint to the hop bitterness so that this beer is properly balanced IPA. This beer's body was a little light for style. The hops and sweetness do play on the roof of my mouth and the carbonation tingles my tongue. Overall, I would say this in one of the better IPAs I have drank. None of the ingredients kill the others. A fine beer."
"Poured with a golden amber body that displayed a slight chill haze. The head was initially about an inch thick and creamy, and settled down to a carpet of bubbles and left a good amount of lace going down. Lively carbonation was quite nice. The aroma was pretty mild for an IPA, with a floral, delicate hop smell that reminded me more of a Pilsner. Taste was very balanced with caramel malts, sweet and tart citric tones, and spicy to floral hop bitterness. It lacked the quintessential bite of an IPA, but was a very pleasant experience. Medium creamy mouthfeel with a dry aftertaste. An easy drinking IPA that has enough complexity to keep things interesting."
"It is medium bodied and very drinkable. Overall, an excellent IPA. It reminds me of Stone's Pale Ale, but I like this better."
"The taste is reliable. I definately am getting my hop fix here. Orange and other citrus flavors are very prominent. Clean and crisp but very thin in the mouth. This is a solid IPA."
" Avery has some of the best looking labels in the beer world, and this one is another attractive one. A very good, hoppy, westcoast style IPA that is very drinkable."
"The beer was dark golden in color and had a head that was bright white in color and left some really nice lacing. The flavor was a nice blend of hops and the aftertaste wasn't too bitter. The aroma was sort of a stinky feet hop aroma."
"The beer an unclouded amber to copper color as it sets in the glass, the head is mountainous in size, creamy in texture with the color a beauteous light tan, the lace a diaphanous skirt to hide the glasses charms. Nose is dominated by the hop floral spiciness, cotton candy sweet, malt laden and a magnificent treat for the olfactory senses, start is ambrosial, nice malt presence; the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is pesky in its acidity; the hops steal the show with their spiciness, droughty aftertaste that lingers on the palate, WOW! Another winner from this most magnificent brewery, that has climbed into my top three favorite breweries, right there with Stone and Alesmith, a must try for you hop heads and its now available here in bottles."
"i had to go four for drinkability nearly just because this is an anytime any place beer for anyone who likes india pale ale."
"Pours a hazed, orangy pilsener color with an off white head that's dissipating into fluff around the side of the pint. Grapefruity hop aroma mixed with some other vinous smells. Good domestic IPA, starts with a burst of malt sweetness followed by the drying factor of the hops finishing with another interplay of sweetness, like sweetened iced tea. Nicely effervescent and very drinkable. Shame I can't get this in my area. This beer's packed with flavor, yet maintaining an air of drinkability."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Update  Now two years later that I live in SoCal and can get this just about anywhere I thought Id give this another review, but boy oh boy this hasnt changed a bit. Its just as I wrote about it in 2004. Nice IPA."
"I think this is a very drinkable IPA that is very hoppy (in the nose and in the mouth) and is clearly not for everyone. It might be a little to sharp for some, but others will enjoy the experience."
"Other: This was called Avery Dry-Hopped IPA at the event, but does not merit a new entry."
"Avery's produced a real nice IPA here. It's got a bold, strong hops profile and the malt backbone does a fine job of keeping the flavors in balance. Very easy drinkability. A well-crafted IPA worth checking out."
"Overall Impression: YUM! Haven’t been blown away by many Avery products, but this is good! Mouthfeel is a bit too oily, but the body is good. Hops don’t knock the door down, but I enjoyed the restraint. This is a subdued, well-rounded IPA and worth a try. I’ll grab a sixer next time I see it, recommend you do the same."
"Overall: After the very disappointing White Rascal, this is more like it! The Avery IPA is a good drink. I have 4 bottles of this; I might just manage another in a minute. Whilst I would advise getting only a single of the White Rascal, I would certainly recommended investing in a 6-Pack of the IPA."
"I'm sure there are better American IPAs out there, but there probably aren't too many of them. Avery IPA is the real deal and makes me wish that it was available in my area of the country. The label shows the shipping route from England to India. Pretty cool considering the style."
"Poured very pale in color with a vast white head. Tons of lacing up and down the glass. Smell is really citrusy and quite bitter. Taste is similar but the hops seem to be the only thing in this beer. Where are the malts? The citrus taste can be akin to grapefruit and some herbal bitterness also comes to mind. Yeast leaves a faint drying to the end of this beer. But it just seems too unbalanced and the body is too weak. However it does go down easy and is quite quenching. All in all, an average IPA."
"ng"
"The clean finish and controlled hops flavor made for a very drinkable beer.."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable IPA, that is the standard hop heavy brew. If that's what you like, you'll enjoy this, if you want more malt try something else."
"Pours a light amber in appearance with a pillowy off-white, long-lasting head. Lively aroma primarily consists of citrus, grapefruit and malt with some piney and floral notes also. Medium-bodied. Nice balance between the bitterness and juicy hops. The grapefruit flavors really pop up front and are supported by a rather nice, yet sometimes subtle, malt backbone. Citrus flavors dominate the hop profile. Finishes with a citrusy fruitiness and a lingering hop bitterness. A pretty solid IPA."

"Appears in my pint a glowing hazed golden orange burst of sunshine with an overcast of cloudy white foam above it, leavng trails of speckled lacing with each sip. Aromatic qualities to be enjoyed come in the form of vinous hops that give off citrus tones with a mellow crisp malt profile not too bad at all. Taste however throws a curveball at me, much more pronounced grapefruit like characteristics with the finish containing almost no malt sweetness but the rind of a citrus fruit overly bitter in the finish lacking the balance I search for and adore. Mouthfeel: Spritzy medium bodied IPA, not bad. Drinkability: Gets shot down due to unbalance why does my mouth taste like I'm chewing on an orange peel this is pissing me off."
"Way too hoppy for me as I am not a hop head by any means. It poured a small sized ivory head with fine-small bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was clear with some carbonation observed and a golden hue. The nose was very hoppy as was the flavor which is of course very typical for an IPA. It left a lingering bitter aftertaste with a tingly and smooth mouthfeel and it was medium bodied. This IPA left a good lacing."
"Nice clear copper color that is crowned by a good lasting beige head. Aromas of citrus and hops waft from the glass as I pour it. A light grassy hay aroma (but only the good aspects), there is a decent amount of hop aroma to this beer. It is well carbonated, and gets quite lively when swirled in the glass. Great malt flavor that accompanies the hoppy flavor and bitterness. A malty sweet flavor with hints of biscuits and caramel malts. Quite a lingering bitterness in the finish. A good solid IPA, not quite over the top, which is good because you don't always want that. There is a ton of balanced flavors in this beer. Both the malt and hops are competing for attention, though the hops are the definite center piece. Definitely drink this beer on the warm side of cool, it allows more of the flavor to open up."
"Overall - A crushingly bitter beer from start to finish. Lots of hops character. I felt it could have used some more malt. A bit too lopsided in favor of hop bitterness, but still very tasty overall. Crunchy hard crisp and bold American hops are the order of the day for Avery's IPA. (hey, that rhymed)"
"Can you say HOPS??? this brew pours a nice rich golden color with a substantial head. Take one deep breath and the beautifully fragrant (pretty much flowery) hops are just bouncing up at your nose! The hops are equally present in the herbal/fruity taste. There is not alot more I can say about this brew, because it really is ALL about hops!!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a dry finish. Drinkability is only hurt by its intense dry and crisp finish, the hops bruised by tongue, i think."
"Drinkability: Quite a nice IPA. Could use some more malt to offer some balance, but overall, a super brew."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy golden orange color with a small creamy off white head that doesn't last long, minimal lacing. Citrusy and fruity aromas, nice sweet grapefruit and piney, hoppy flavors. Medium bodied with a nice soft creamy mouthfeel, very easy to drink as I finished this bottle in just a few minutes, great session beer."
"Pours with a rocky head that refuses to fade away. A golden colored IPA that pours with a big head and big burst of spicy hops. This beer is all about the hops. Hops, hops, hops I tell you! They dominate this beer from the aroma through to the long finish. Although the hops dominate, there's some crips malt flavor that slips through and the mouthfeel is full. Nice lacework as the beer disappears from my glass. A very bitter, lasting finish makes this beer one of my new favorite IPAs."
"Pours a golden color with a light orange tinge with a light but sticky head,aroma is on the malty/fruity side with some soapiness ans grassy hop aroma that lingers.A nice balanced flavors in this one definent zesty hopiness but a nice malt backbone keeping this very nicely balanced.Not an over the top IPA wich is very nice,a very good beer."
"The IPA poured a clear golded color with a hoppy flavor and nose. I thought it was very tasty."
"The beer itself poured a nice golden hue with very nice clarity. A nice rich head with tight bubbles capped the brew from start to finish. The aroma was light citrus and reed, somewhat limited by the foam on top. The taste was of a nice, clean ale, almost a pale with slight european malt flavors. Rich and chewy, but still light enough for the style. The hop start and finish are nice, just enough bitterness at the end to have made the voyage, and enough for me to make another voyage to the fridge for another. Excellent example of style."
"Thanks for the memories and thanks to my mom for bringing me the samples from AZ"
"This was my pick of a Saturday afternoon sampling. This beer came with a good look, taste, and aroma. The body is a clear mid amber with a half inch of off white head. The nose gave off a rather robust citrus sense that was very inviting on this warm day. The taste is a very smooth grapefruit that is just right between its tartness and drinkability, being tangy, but not mouth-puckering in this tart sense. A nice oliy feel accompanies this taste and the beer could last an afternoon. Very nice IPA."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear amber color with 1 finger of head and nice lacing. There is something floating around in the glass, but it doesn't look like yeast. It's small, thin, and flakey looking. I'm not too sure about that. The smell is delightful, rich in hops and citrus. I wish I could say the same about the taste. The malt and hops clash here, instead of coming together in harmony like they should. There is a bit of a grassy taste going on here, very dry as well. The mouthfeel is a little oily, not so strong. The drinkability is fairly nice though, at only 6%."
"Orange-gold color. Medium head. Aroma is citrusy. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are grapefruity and spicy. Hoppy, crisp and clean. A nice IPA. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This is a very good IPA. I will always be pleased to see this in my glass. It is reassuring to see a great IPA brewed in a standard 12 ounce bottle. Well done."
"Well, not really. But that may as well have been the case. It pours light, and it's got a nice, lingering white head (the lacing clung to the side of the glass through the whole beer). But the hallmark here is the huge citrus aroma and taste. An obviously hop-derived fruit/floral aroma makes way for a bitter grapefruit taste that really exemplifies the analogy that's used so often with IPAs. Very strong with hints of other hop characters -- scotch pine, herbal tea, flowers. A little grating to the senses though and a bit hard for non-hopheads to drink many in a row. Nonetheless, it's a solid and very drinkable brew."
"A dull orange with little head and no lacing, has a large based cascade hops aroma, some citrus on the nose as well. Taste dominated by hops, but not overpowered, blend of sweet grapefruit, some orange peel, and some malt undertones. Well rounded for an IPA, not overly hopped, but presence felt nicely. Creamy and tasty, above average IPA."
"Real humdinger of an IPA that I'd gladly return to, anytime."
"pours a golden copper color with a decent foamy white head. medium body from a low level of carbonation. i detected a muted fruitiness in the middle with a dry finish and pleasant bitterness. i enjoyed this one, and could probably drink more than a few of them."
"This beer poured a copper gold color and formed a foamy white head that left some lace as it subsided. There was a small amount of carbonation present. The aroma was of hops and citrus. The flavor was of hops and of what I would call citrus rind, which is a interesting characteristic of the hops that leads to slightly burnt/bitter finish."
"Drinkability: Just a slight penalty in my book for the persistent bitterness in the aftertaste. It really hung around and puckered me up. Overall, an very good beer, though not my favorite, and one that I would still drink frequently."
"This one pours a clear dark gold tinged orange with a pillowy head that has a moderate life span and settle to thin lacing on top. The nose is a piney spicy hops that are very strong. This heavily hopped IPA is just damn good. The mouthfeel is pillowy and soft which helps to balance the extreme hops. Very enjoyable and very complex flavors here. The hops are so strong you almost miss the sweet malt underneath."
"Pours a clear pale yellow/orange color with a small white head that lingers for quite a while. It has a strong powder-dry hop citrusy/lemony smell. Im not certain it is, but it smells like it. After first taste, I would nearly go out on a limb and say it is definitely dry-hopped IMO. The taste consists of hops, hops, and then tapers into hops. Then you can taste a little bit of a dry grapefruit flavor after the hops die down. But this is waaayyyy after! It is light bodied and finishes ultra-dry. You almost need a thirst quencher after each swallow because it leaves your palate so dry. Is there powder in here? Hop powder no less ;-) It is a serious IPA in the hop category, but it lacks in complexity. I love hops, but I like to taste other things too. Different! Cheers!"
"6.0% ABV"
"Pours a hazy light orange amber color with a large creamy and foamy white head with good retention that eventually fades into a bubbly and very sticky lace. Nose is strong floral hops with some citrus notes. Light to medium in body with the hop oils creating a bit of a slick (yet also a bit sticky) mouthfeel. Taste is bitter, bitter, bitter! Loads of raw hop leaf flavors, hop resins and tannins, and notes of grapefruit rind. Bone dry finish. This stuff is very addicting and would make a great session IPA."
"Per Avery website: 6% ABV and Columbus Hops."
"Golden orange in color with a touch of haze, modest but quite dense cloudtop head develops slowly but retains well. Carbonation is slight; lace is thick and broken. The aroma exhibits the expected strong grapefruit hop characteristic, with hints of malt beneath, although these are forcefully subdued by the hops. Taste begins with a momentary fruit sweetness, which is quickly vanquished by the intensely bitter grapefruit hop and pinesap flavors. Towards the finish the malt manages to assert itself for a moment, but is completely overwhelmed by a wave of intense bitterness, which lingers long beyond the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy. Although it is not to my taste, this is a well-crafted IPA which will doubtless appeal to hopheads."
"."
"Overall, a solid IPA. Although there are other IPA's I like better, this is a good one."
"Orange amber in color, it pours slightly hazy with a very nice head that displays excellent retention. No noticable carbonation trails in the beer give it a very rich appearance. As the head fades, it leaves a layer of foam typically found in malty brews. The aroma is very hoppy, with distinct citrus characteristics mixed with a hint of rose florals and a touch of sweetness that almost conjures up the image of bright pink bubble gum. On the tongue, the malt character of this beer is strong, with noticable sweetness evident through the balanced hoppiness. The finish is noticably bitter and very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very creamy, with minimal carbonation. The only astringency is from the liberal dose of hops. The drinakbility is excellent due to the balance of the flavor. This is no hop-heads IPA. It is one for the masses of ale lovers everywhere. A solid, everyday IPA that should become a staple in my liquid diet."
"A very enjoyable IPA. Pours out to a dark gold, almost amber color in the glass. Aroma is that of grapefruit. Mostly hops in the taste, as per the style, but remarkably balanced. Nice hoppy finish. This would be a good session IPA and a decent choice for someone looking to try the India Pale Ale style."
"Hmmm - an English or American style IPA? This one seemed to fall in the middle. More malty and a little less hoppy than the American version, but the hops were a little more pungent and busy than the English. Verdict - a mid-Atlantic IPA, and a tasty beer to boot. Good body and solid grapefruity, slightly floral hops. Very drinkable, and at 6% abv you can line a few of these up and still navigate afterward."
"Another nice big hoppy I.P.A., just the way I like 'em. Golden in color, a little hazy and slightly evervescent. Aggressive hop flavor and a little sour in the finish. Not big in the head or a big lace but a very nice citrus, floral aroma. A very, very fine example of the style from a highly repected brewery."
"WoW"
"This powerful IPA pours with a nice copper color and foamy white head. The huge spicy hop aroma is unmistakable, this is a hop head brew. The flavor is big, spicy with an aggressive bitterness and a nice malt infusion. The hops take top of the hill with this beer, though. The malt pretty much gets the hell out of the way. Very tasty."
"A new offering from the beer gods at the local liquor warehouse, and a pretty darn good IPA.  Clear golden color, better head than many and a fair amount of lace down the side of the glass.  Decidedly hoppy, but I didn't get the strong citrusy flavor that some reviewers have mentioned and which tends to turn me off.  The citrus that I sensed was well balanced with floral notes.  Good carbonation on top of all this yielded a very, very drinkable IPA.  Oh yeah, and I really liked the label, too."
"Cheers to mattmaples for the sample"
"An interesting IPA.  A very light brew in color.  The aroma is not as hoppy as I would have liked.  The flavor, on top of all that, the flavor is bitter and sharp.  Very, very interesting.  Still, I would try it again to see if I missed something.  Worth a glance if you are looking to try something different.  Prost!"
"Great golden color, good enough head for an ipa, wonderful citrisy hop aroma, and it tastes like your chewing on a grapefruit. I like it well enough luckily it isn't totally over the top on the hop bitterness (although it is on the flavor) not being a total hop head I still prefer the Lagunitas Maximus but this one rate very well in my book."
"Pours a clear golden with a nice creamy white head.  Smell is all hops, insane floral and citrus (grapefruit) aromas.  The first sip is like taking a big bite out of a grapefruit.  Insane hoppiness.  Very slight malt balance, but no actual malt flavors.  Super clean and dry finish and very drinkable.  Nice IPA.  A must for hop heads.  Insanely hopped.  Definitely very drinkable though and a great session brew as most of the beers in this style are."
"I really enjoy this IPA.  It's got a light amber hue and a classic Cascade hop profile all around.  The nose is all citrus, the flavor is citrusy and the bitterness is right on for an American IPA.  Although Cascades shine in this brew, the sometimes overbearing grapefruity nature of many AIPAs isn't present in this brew.  Avery hopped this one well. It could use a tad bit more malt and body, but that's just me.  I like malty IPAs.  Still-- I could drink this all day and be quite satisfied."
"Basically, slightly-above-average IPA. No surprises here. Not bad, but nothing super."
"Pours a clear golden color, with a decent white colored head. Good carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little sharp. On the nose the aroma is very hoppy, slight citrus, floral. On the palate the flavor is hoppy, pine, grapefruit like, citrus, bitterness. Overall drinkable though."
