So now that my long weekend has started, I decided to put Deviant Dale's to the test, and compare it to Dogfish Head Burton Baton, which was in my fridge. BB is a blend of Dogfish 90 Minute and an oak-aged old ale. Its oak-y characteristics create a taste similar to Deviant Dale's so I thought it'd be a good comparison. The two have a lot in common. BB has a more hop-forward profile and a more bitter edge, DD is sweeter. I've always liked BB a great deal. If the truth be known, I like DD better. At my local craft ale shop, they're the same price for a four-pack, but the BB four pack is four 12 oz. bottles, the DD four pack is four 16 oz. cans.","DeanWormer","Jul 02, 2014"

There's nothing too demonic about this, though - personally, G'Knight was far more intense and sweet. This still stands as a solid beer and shows that Oskar Blues really is among some of the great larger craft breweries out there.","magictacosinus","Mar 03, 2014"

Very sweet, floral, tropical, orange zest fruit on the front end if the palate, with smooth and evenly balanced malt nuance throughout the finish. Reminds me a little of Ballast Point Sculpin, which I really like. Similar profiles. Will gladly buy this one many times over. An excellent top tier DIPA, in my book.","JohnParadee","Dec 24, 2013"

The second time I was really digging all the earthy hops and even a hint of pine resin mixed into the brew. It was still a hop overload, but I was able to enjoy its assault on my palate. For an IPA this is definitely a gigantic hop bomb and won’t be for everyone.

Scents of citrus pith, grape fruit and some pine and juniper-like notes. Pretty much what is expected for an American IPA. Just as inviting and pleasing as always. Flavors of grapefruit, citrus pith, a bit of pine and malt sweetness. It's quite bitter, and quite piney and citrusy, and with the malt sweetness drinks almost like a DIPA, rather than an IPA. Quite good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Good for an IPA, makes it easy to drink. Overall this is a good American IPA.

I assumed it would be a stronger version of Dale's Pale Ale, but it's definitely an IPA style. At 8% I'd say it's more like a double IPA. It was served in a goblet. With it's deep orange color it looks like a million bucks. And the hoppy nose and sweet flavor do not disappoint. Also it is quite balanced. Most strong IPAs are overly bitter from the hop presence. This one is not.","thehooksman","Jul 26, 2013"

Pine, orange rind, grass, raw honey meld with a touch of toasted caramel malt. On the palate, the beer has a coating, oily aspect, but not to the degree that it is undesirable. Those hop oils contribute much of the flavor profile with grapefruit, pine, a hint of grass, but the malt is no slouch here. The slightly sweet caramel malt does its job by counteracting the hops for a tinge of balance. This is a nice beer. If this is a tweak of Dale's Pale Ale, it's a tweak in the right direction.","BeardedBoffin","Jun 27, 2013"

Then sweet citrus, orange some grapefruit comes in on the middle and then a little oil and bitter as it goes down resinous, piney, sweet and juicy. Mouthfeel is thin and sticky.

I don't know what could have went wrong here, but the shear potency of the pines, resins, and oils were just too much for me to handle. The heavy fusel alcohol burn didn't help the drinkability at all, either. Just a weird brew that I don't exactly understand the love for. I know that palates are indeed different, but mine can't be this far off, can it? Perhaps sometime in the future I'll give it another whirl and see if it was a possible bad batch, but if my cans were in spec, then I just don't "get" this brew.","tectactoe","Jun 03, 2013"

The retention and lacing were pretty solid on this. The smell of the beer was resin-like and piney, very floral and pungent with hops. The taste was sharp and bitter with a subtle malt sweetness in there as well with a biscuity toasted flavor as well. The mouthfeel was good, nicely carbonated and dry in the finish.

The aroma was subdued, making the flavor all that more of a pleasant surprise. This is a particularly rich and complex IPA. The hops take the lead, giving it a hearty grapefruit bite with piney notes, but those hops are all hung on a solid backbone of malt that creates an excellent balance. The alcohol is surprisingly low key, given an ABV of 8.0%. This also has a unusually (at least for an IPA) silky/creamy mouth feel cut by a refreshing level of carbonation. I've never seen this brew on shelves around here, but I will definitely be on the lookout for more.","LCB_Hostage","May 07, 2013"

Aroma is a nice soft whiff of citrusy orange with perhaps a little pineapple. 1st sip brings an initial hit of malt sweetness followed by orangey hops. A bit of pine and grapefruit appear in the middle and last on the swallow. The citrus/pine mix lingers after the swallow, but a hint of maltiness appears as well. As it warms, the hops become more dominant. Mouthe feel is medium heavy and somewhat fizzy. Overall, this is a well balanced and tasty IPA. It's not overdone, as many are,, and easily approachable by people like me who are put off by the 10 megaton hop bomb.","CJfromPhilly","Apr 19, 2013"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't overly bitter and it was fairly smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention and I think a pint can would be too much for me, splitting this is the way to go I feel that 8 ounces is about all I could handle. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty nice and the lacing was pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion, garlic, and roasted hop aromas and flavors, they weren't appealing to me and they felt out of place, but they really made this beer stick out from all the other American IPA's. I don't think I would buy this again, but I would like to see how some of my other craft beer drinking friends react to this beer, I'm pretty sure it's a love it or hate it type of thing, I wouldn't really recommend this beer but if you don't mind some onion and garlic in your beer this might be worth a try. All in all I thought this was one weird ass beer, I didn't find it to be undrinkable, but those onion, garlic, and burn hop aspects were a turn off for me, this just ins't the beer for me, but I could see how some people could like it. I appreciate the creativity from Oskar Blues with this beer, but it just didn't seem to flow together well and I'm still not sold on this brewery. This was a really weird beer, enough said. On a side note, i have have some hops growing in my garden and when i crush the hop cones between my fingers I get an aroma that is almost dead on with this beer, after looking it up I see that this beer has a good amount of Summit hops is in it, so i'm now thinking that there's a good chance that my unknown hops plants could be Summit hops, it's interesting.","StoutHunter","Mar 28, 2013"

Overall, this strikes me as a well done ipa and it's very unique. However, I do not like the "onion hop" flavor, or smell at all. I've been generous in the rating for aroma and smell because undoubtedly there are people who like it, but I'm not sure I'll be having this one again.","dougfur","Mar 26, 2013"

Super smooth, the bitterness hits early, but mellows out and really makes you want to drink the entire 4 pack. Another solid Oskar Blues production.","DesertRat","Mar 17, 2013"

4.28,6.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Bought at Highland Liquor Store in Birmingham in May 2012. Poured into a shaker a deep copper color like a brand new penny that allowed lot of lustrous light through rather easily. Topped with 3cm or so of big, frothy, white head that laced the glass very nicely. The smell was very resinous like hemp oil and a freshly cut grapefruit. Taste was very bitter, full of pine hops and oily grapefruit and maybe sour apple as well. Finishes long and bitter, and the alcohol definitely sneaks through. Very good beer overall. I think they're onto something with these IPAs in the can.","estlinska","Mar 16, 2013"

4.34,8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a dark, Baltic amber color that reflects dark light, and is clear as a bell. Smells out of the bag like fresh whole hops, the fragile florals and earthy garlic notes present--a real fresh/late hopped balance. Taste is balanced, not too sweet or dry, with light malts and fresh florals and notes not always present in heavily hopped beers. Really great here. Mouthfeel is as it should be. This is solid, and though pricey, I think worth every bit of coin spent on this.","Bitter_Echo","Mar 15, 2013"

The flavor is more malty and balanced then allot of big IPA's and sweet as the nose would suggest, but still has a good amount of hopping with a resin and piney hop profile. The mouthfeel is thick and boozy but good, and its is good and drinkable. Overall a good beer while not being the hoppyest of IPA's and it also drinks well out of the can. The price will lead me elsewhere in the future, and is the biggest detriment to this brew.","dickieb","Jan 23, 2013"

Although the freshness of my sample could be a consideration, I found this IPA to be top-notch. Not top-notch for a canned brew, but top-notch for an IPA. It is totally a west-coaster, so Dogfish drinkers would turn up their nose immediately, but it really is worth the 12-13 bucks I paid for a 4-pack. There is no way I could put away four of these in a session. I will be looking to purchase this one again soon, but I will make sure it is less than 100 days old.","HoppySailor","Dec 19, 2012"

Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, mango, floral, caramel, moderate pine, grass, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, caramel, bread, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, bread, orange rind, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor complexity with a nicely balanced malt backbone; with minimal cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! (though I would definitely place this as being a DIPA blindly) Great hop flavor complexity and malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering I will be getting again.","superspak","Dec 16, 2012"

4.37,8.7,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Close to three fingers of deep eggshell white foam, good mix of bubble sizes with moderate dimpling and extremely strong head retention, the lacing in turn impressive with broad, ultra-sticky streaks covering the glass sides. The liquid is is a cloudy coppery red color which takes on a more orange to yellow haze further from the glass center, while opaque still hard to see any bubbles within. The scents positively leap out of the glass into your nose from a good ten inches away with outsized white grapefruit, lemon orange citrus, pine sap, cocoa powder and then tropical pineapple, papaya to nectarine, peach fruit, noticeable grass and pepper kick to it as well, softens into honey and molasses, not an incredibly complex experience but plenty of intensity and verve. Full-bodied, the carbonation is soft and downy which creates more sticky, clingy texture as well as length rather than cleansing freshness. The chocolate, cocoa and vanilla maltiness more pronounced, piles more sweetness onto the pine, honey, caramel, sweet tea and at times cola bean accents. Curiously the grapefruit, lemon citrus pulls back into the whole here albeit no wallflower. Same for the peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple fruit, especially as it takes on a metallic, quinine like edge through the finish. Hides the alcoholic heat well, This is a “big boy” and arguably a double IPA in character. (Canned 9/6/12)","farrago","Dec 09, 2012"

Citrus and pine aromas waft towards my nose almost immediately after the can goes crack. Resinous pine and green onion dominates the aroma with quite a dankness that I could sniff all day dude. There's a sweet caramel and bread malt base in there, but it's so far down the rabbit hole that its hard to find. The flavor holds a bit more malt than the aroma suggested with a solid sweet caramel and simple syrup flavor up front. Pine, grapefruit, resin, green onion, and garlic flavored hops abound in the flavor but always provide a smooth bitterness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy resinous mouthfeel. Very flavorful beer with a lot going on here. Its a touch on the sweet side for my personal tastes, but I could drink this.","johnnnniee","Nov 16, 2012"

It pours a clear orange-amber topped by a finger of lightly dirty off-cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, orange zest, light caramel, and a broad hint of pine. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis still on the citrus zest, though the pine ensures a decent bitter bite in the background. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a lovely little IPA, one that's heavy on the hops without completely sacrificing balance.

4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ran into this at Delaney’s in New Haven. This pale ale looks clear and bronze with a thick egg shell colored head and lots of it staying behind to hug the tall pilsner glass. The nose picks up a beautiful citrus and toasted wheat bread yeast. Very pleasant stuff. The taste buds embrace a distinctively well constituted blend of grapefruit-orange citrus and grainy malt pine. Very impressive for an IPA, even more stunning for a pale ale. There’s a slight hint of alcohol but nothing that hurts this intense, delicious flavor. Body is nearly a full bodied brew with a fairly thick and syrupy hint to it, a midland carbonation keeps it fresh and drinkable. This is a beautiful grapefruit bread brew with a pale ale attraction for the hop masses. Bravo!","Durge","Sep 14, 2012"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Canned just a month ago. Pours an almost-clear amber color with a medium egg-white head. Scent is amazing on the hoppiness. Good amount of hops with some citrus and a bit of bready malt aromas. A light floral aroma, but more citrus. Taste is just tasty as hell. A great hop profile balanced with a bready malt profile, but not leaning toward an east-coast IPA. This beer keeps it west-coast qualities, while having a solid malt profile. Lovely bittering hops and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat chewy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this could easily pass for a DIPA, but it is very tasty regardless.","DovaliHops","Sep 04, 2012"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours amber with golden and orangish hues with a two finger off-white head. Pine, fresh cut grass, flora, and undertones of citrus on the nose. Sweet malt immediately joined by grapefruit rind and pine, returning to sweet malt, and then finishes dry with some sweetness gradually relenting to citrus rind and pine and hints of alcohol. The heaviest malt presence I've experienced in an IPA and certainly borders on DIPA territory. At the very heaviest edge of medium bodied, abundant carbonation, and very smooth. Truly surprising that an IPA with such a heavy malt presence can be so balanced and finish so dry.","chanokokoro","Aug 23, 2012"

Pours a semi-hazy copper with a solid, one inch, cream-colored head the slowly recedes - the perfect pour with the head reaching just to the lip of the glass. Nose suggests some tropical fruit notes off the pop; however, once in the glass, there is a very assertive caramel malt presence, followed by a slight earthiness. Taste follows nose - starts with some caramel sweetness with a little bit of light fruit interspersed and culminating in an earthy hops bittering that quickly drops off. There's also a little something medicinal happening in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a slightly oily texture and a crisp, even carbonation that leaves a residual prickle in the mouth between quaffs. This beer is definitely closer to a DIPA than an American IPA as it has that slightly barleywine-esque character. Pretty good, but doesn't warrant the pricetag in my opinion.","Jwale73","Aug 09, 2012"

I thought it was a Double IPA when I was drinking it and was surprised to find out it was just an IPA on BA, so it definitely straddles that fine line between the two styles. Since it is an IPA I would say it was one of the hoppier and more full bodied versions of the style I've had to date. I recommend hop heads trying this one!","thegodfather2701","Jul 23, 2012"

4.44,10.4,4,5,4.5,4,4," The beer pours straw yellow and piss like with a big thick and hay colored head. It’s a little darker and hazy at its center with a slight ambering, but pretty clean looking overall. This beer is probably meant for the can, but it looks pretty nice in a glass too. The head has a thick and long retention at almost three finger widths, and the lacing is long and circular like several mountain ranges running on top of each other on the glass. Its smell is excellent and floral, with good hits of pine and citrus hops on the nose, almost like the lovechild of an orange and a lemon, a very faint light sweet pale malting is found in the back, but overall this is just a really clean and hoppy smell that has me very excited for the taste. Speaking of taste, it does seem to deliver an interesting effect. I get a lot more sweet, almost-caramel malt than I expected. Nice citrus hops tingle with some slight pineyness. It almost tastes like pine sol and cleaning products, but that is not a horrible thing. The beer is very drinkable at eight percent, which is another plus. (It’s almost sessionable!) Drinking from the can you get more metallic flavor, which isn’t too surprising since it is a can… But the flavor melds well with the sweet hops to provide some excellent refreshing bite. This is a great “in the sun beer” and is nicely refreshing with a good kick of alcohol that is excellently masked in the taste. It has little to no carbonation on the tongue, which is a little odd, but it is also rather thick and almost syrupy and viscous on the tongue, which is really strange for an IPA, but definitely not a negative. The hops tingle on the tongue is nice and lightly biting, unlike some IPA’s. There is a lot of cloying on the top of the tongue with sticky goopy saliva that isn’t exactly wet. Saliva also runs on the sides of the tongue wetly though. Overall this is a cool and slightly different take on the IPA that I am totally game for. The thick creamy feel on the tongue and the perfect balance of sweet pale malts and hops work excellently, and the smell of this beer is amazing! Good beer that I would drink again, if not for the $15 pricing. Even with the steep price for 4 tall boys, though, I would consider it again.","Maxwell","Jul 06, 2012"

Served from can into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. “Let’s sling a little mud, girl” on the lip of the can. Sounds like a line I would use in the bedroom back in college, but I digress… Poured a dark yellow-orange with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, floral, and floral hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, wild onion, floral, and floral hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The flavor on this one was pretty complex and hoppy while still maintaining a nice refreshing aspect. Unfortunately however, the aroma on this one was quite reserved and didn’t jump out at me. I really had to work hard to pick up on the aspects of the things there as it was slightly on the weak side. Another good canned brew from Oskar Blues.

Mouthfeel was on the thin side, so much so that I felt as though I were drinking unsweetened iced tea. Until the kick occurred. Man, this had the punch of a Missouri mule on the finish. I sat back back in my chair, attempting to catch my breath when I heard my long-silent monkey on my back begin to chatter. "Hops!" he screeched incessantly and when I CANnot satiate him, he goes berserk. Sweat ran in rivulets down my face. My quivering hand reached again for the glass.

Here we go...pours a bright orange-copper with a dollop of stiff white foam. Yeah it's hoppy, but I'm not getting those bright and juicy pine and citrus notes I was expecting. Instead, it's a punch of dank herbs and grass (I guess it's those Columbus dry hops). Malt is surprisingly substantial with a chewy bready quality. Pungent, resinous hop goodness continues to linger on the palate after the first big gulp. A bit of chive or shallot creeps in as it warms.

Fresh hops and resin dominate along with hints of pine, tangerines, grapefruit, and caramel, with just a touch of green onion. The taste is in your face bold and mouth-puckering. The fresh, resiny hops are the stars. The grapefruit, orange rind, and pine are given just enough taming by the sweet caramel malt to make this one scary drinkable double. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, and the finish is hugely bitter, but that subtle malt sweetness makes for a perfect ending on one hell of a beer.

Medium bodied, slightly bubbly for style. Average dIPA with some good and bad points.","rfgetz","May 14, 2012"
3.82,-5,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy copper-orange with a fluffy off-white head that settles to a squat cap. Getting lots of resinous hop aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, peach, and tree sap. Very tropical and delicious, and it certainly lives up to it's "Deviant" reputation. The taste is a bit of a letdown from the nose, however. The caramel malt profile is just a touch too big for my liking, and hides all that fresh hop goodness a bit too much. I'm all about balance (sometimes), but this doesn't come across nearly as hoppy as it should. The hops I do get are delicious, with more peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. Mouthfeel is smooth and more then a bit sticky, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a solid DIPA with an amazing presentation, but it didn't quite live up to my hopes.","jsanford","May 13, 2012"

Nose is on the malty and piney side of the spectrum. The hops aren't very apparent, neither is any kind of prominent citrus. The taste is largely an extension of the nose. The malt profile is pretty dominant once more, with the hops fighting to survive. Pine finally shines through in what is a continued absence of any citrus or noteworthy hop profile. The mouthfeel has a lot of malt, caramel and some sweetness to it. The 8% ABV is a bit noticeable and provides some decent bite. Overall, this is a decent beer.

Color is a clear orange honey ambewith a few bubble trails. Aroma is hops, malt, used leather, musty, and musky. Flavor's much like nose with hop bitterness really standing out, a little malt sweetness, some carbonic tang. Body is good and full but the bitterness makes it a bit rough, carbonation is good.

4.1,2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a tall boy into a true pint, the beer is a ruby-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, yellowish head on the start that quickly settles into a half inch of bubbly foam. Aromas of wet, resiny, fresh hops throughout the nose, with cedar and subtle caramel highlights. Flavors are resiny and bitter hops on the forward tongue, with a subtle tart and tangy citrus blending that is slightly outbalanced. Roasting to the caramel, but any malt profile is quickly swallowed up by the hops presence. Very rich and resiny, this transitions to a bitter and slightly astringent hops aftertaste. The finish is slick and drying. Solid beer for the hop heads of the world. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Apr 11, 2012"

Sweet and toasted characteristics in the malt meet a bitter hop bite, alongside, some spicy yeast flavors makes this a worthy brew. The appearance might be one of the best aspects of this beer, with its copper color body, off white head and gorgeous lacing.

As the beer warms the dankness combines with the malt to turn into a caramelized onion flavor, very unique, I don't think I have ever got this from a beer before. As the beer warms to room temperature I get a strong oniony aroma that isn't as pleasant as it was when cold. The taste follows the same progression of the aroma. The mouthfeel is very good, dry and drinkable.

Fine lacing left bedhind between sips, I can't believe a DIPA like this comes out of a can. Aroma has a bit of garlic/onion notes going on with some earthy pine resin, minimal citrus pith but basically intense hops. A bit of caramel based breadiness in the nose as well, but it's hard to tell with an explosion of hops. Flavor is eqaully as hoppy with a nice riding malt sweetness, caramel base with flowing levels of hop bitterness and flavor. A nice citrus earthy pine resin ride of hops, that hides the booze nicely. Sweetness is kind of obsurd but it definitely balances out the hop bitterness. The only thing that starts to arise is the onion/garlic hop flavor that I don't really care for. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying big hop oils with some residual sugars noted in this one, carbonation moderate body is full. Overall enjoyable hop nose, a bit muted hop flavors with ample bitterness an 8% DIPA in a 16 ounce can if a do the math right that could equal: DRUNK.","WVbeergeek","Mar 14, 2012"

There is a body odor flavor on the hop profile and I am okay with it, but not really digging the flavor much. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a wet finish.

Given that it was somewhat of a lackluster pour, the amount of lacing left down the side of the glass is impressive. The nose is intensely citrusy, but in a nice change of pace pineapple seems to be the dominant aroma, with grapefruit notes relegated to a supporting role. There's a nice sturdy malt backbone right up front, a combination of biscuit and caramel flavors. The expected blast of bitterness washes over next, but in the name of what turns out to be a disappointingly weak hoppy payoff. The aforementioned citrus notes are once again present, but not nearly as potent as I might expect from a DIPA with a pungent nose and big dose of bitterness. The body is a bit lighter than I would have expected, but it works well and makes the the beer easier drinking. Carbonation is nice and lively, elevating what hop presence there is. I'm a fan of both Dale's Pale Ale, and Oskar Blues in general, so I did have high hopes for Deviant Dale's that ultimately weren't quite met.","axeman9182","May 02, 2011"
