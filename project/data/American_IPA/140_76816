3.94,1.3,3.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"From bottle to snifter. Yields a finger of light beige sudsy head, with poor retention and lighter lacing walls. Pale and darker orange with some amber. Not overly aromatic, but peppery rye is present immediately, followed by spiciness. Tastes quite piney, with rye lingering for a while after sipping. Some citrus notes, and sweet malted backbone. Feels medium bodied, and slightly slick. Medium/low carbonation and well balanced. Very pleasant beer with a beautiful rye finish. I thoroughly enjoy all SN beers and this is no exception. Will buy again.","sporklift87","Wednesday at 01:21 PM"

4.11,5.7,4,3.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with a large, cream colored head. It is amber in color and very murky. Small particles  are floating throughout the entire beer. Has slight spice aromas from the rye and citrus aromas from hops. Overall aroma is not too strong and is not very impressive. Initial taste is of a combination of grains and citrusy hops. Rye quickly follows and adds to the initial taste. After taste leaves a slight bitterness as IPAs usually do. Unlike most IPAs I have experienced, however, this one does not leave a dry finish in my mouth. Well done.","Myotus","Mar 30, 2015"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 12/4/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, spicy rye, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, spicy rye, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness and rye spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, spicy rye, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent rye IPA style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

4.07,4.6,3.75,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Pours in to a New Belgium tulip with a semi-transparent roasted orange color. The thin tan head lingers for a bit, then disappears with minimal retention and little appreciable lacing. The aroma is a balanced assortment of citrus, caramel sweetness and hints of dank earthy spice. The flavors follow suit, with a nice complex mix of delicious caramel, orange zest and peppery, earthy grain. The finish really highlights the inclusion of rye. Fairly balanced, with the bitterness held in check by the flavorful malts. The body of the beer is great. Juicy, moderate and satisfying, with a perfect level of carbonation. Very well done. Overall, the rye really adds some fantastic depth to the style. Carefully selected complimentary flavors and a keen sense of balance make this one a winner. Another score for Sierra Nevada. These guys really can't miss.","JohnnyI","Feb 09, 2015"

4,2.8,,,,,,"BOD 141/14.  Pours medium amber with a slight haze.  Normal head, lacing and retention.  Nice nose of caramel sweetness over citrus and pine notes with a touch of spice.  Light medium body, with a texture that borders upon creamy.  Normal carbonation level with light effervescence on the finish. Balanced flavor profile with a bit of complexity.  It begins with pine and citrus hop flavor which flows into caramel.  As the caramel sweetness fades, the rye asserts itself.  The finish is somewhat sharp with the rye and hop bitterness lingering.  A solid offering, but not in the league of GL's Rye of the Tiger or Founder's Red's Rye.","tillmac62","Aug 24, 2014"
3.5,-10,,,,,,"Happy, Happy, Happy. This is another great beer from Sierra Nevada. Pours a nice off brown color with a good head. The taste is great with hops, pine and some citrus together. This beer has the right amount of sweetness to balance everything out properly. The finish is of bitter hops, but is very pleasant and definitely a go to beer.

The rye gives it an earthy taste with a bit of sweet spice. It also balances nicely with the hops. It's bitter, but not overly so. It does give a nice tingle to the tongue.

At 6.6% some would argue it isn't a sessionable brew but I firmly disagree. An Oakland A's game and a Ruthless Rye or 6 is a great evening.","slackattack","May 30, 2014"

A lot of thought went into this and it shows well. Worth trying out, good showcase of the rye malt here. Refreshing as well as intriguing, one of the better rye beers i can remember having. Tart and spicy on the nose, flavourful and balanced body with a strong malt base, again more spicy than bitter, with a good finish to tie it together.","mick303","Feb 21, 2014"

Full bodied taste for the style there is just enough nuance to keep things interesting. The tug of war between malt / rye ""breadiness"" and hops is a draw. There is a bit of an aftertaste, but it's not unpleasant. This is an easy drinker and I could go for a couple more. Mouthfeel is spot on....creamy and rich. I picked this up as a single in a ""build your own six pack"" store and I'm wishing I would have grabbed a full 6 of these.

Too many IPAs these days are trying to appeal to the mass consumer, with their fruity/citrusy/floral overtones (don't get me wrong, I love me some ApriHop on occasion), but sometimes I want my IPA to feel like an IPA, one that goes well with a cigar, and puts some hair on your chest. And that's what this beer does.","CraigS119","Jan 23, 2014"

The flavor is bitter and dry throughout the rye provides a bitter starch(and peppery) taste that lingers. The hops are not very fruity or floral but dry and bitter and complement the rye nicely. Overall the beer came together very nicely and has a more pronounced rye presence than I've seen in the brews of some others breweries starting to use rye.","BearslikeBeers","Beers"

This pours a beautiful deep red color with a finger and a half of tan head that lasts throughout the drinking of the ale. The aroma is slightly hoppy but mostly strong with rye and malt. It Sips smooth and gloriously bitter but very dry. Possibly too dry for some. The flavor is earthy and heavy on the rye. Hops are present but not super forward. The finish is hoppier with pine and citrus present but still with a healthy amount of rye and malt underneath. Overall this is an excellent rye ipa and at a phenomenal cost. Pick one up while it's available. I'll look forward to trying again next year.","lochef81","Jan 14, 2014"

The beer pours a copper color with a medium head and pretty good retention. The smell is peppery, alcoholic, and spicy. The taste is also spicy (from the rye) with a solid malt backing but not a whole lot of the IPA flavors that I enjoy. The pepper from the rye seems to crush everything else. The thickness and carbonation are fine, but the rye creates an unpleasant aftertaste. Overall, I'm fairly new to rye beers and I understand that some of my complaints about this beer are simply a result of the rye, but perhaps there should be somewhat less of it. I really enjoyed Founder's Red Rye, but the taste here just didn't do it for me. By far this is the worst Sierra Nevada beer I've had.","DeFaz","Jan 11, 2014"

Full bodied and well-balanced and just really struck a positive chord with me. The rye and some heavy, breadlike malts give beer a spicy edge and keep the abundant pine/citric hop notes from taking over my tastebuds but leave enough so I know I'm drinking a strong IPA. There is this touch of sweetness I seem to get at times as well that makes the beer more interesting. Has a great finish that is crisp and dry and I really took a shine to this Sierra Nevada offering.","clayrock81","Jan 01, 2014"

The nose was spicier than a typical IPA with less of the citrus and pine hop and more of the rye spice. The taste was a peppery hops with the hoppy bitterness balanced by the spicy rye and some caramel to boot. The Ruthless Rye had a thin and spicy front that left a herbal bitter coating on my palate. While maybe not as complex as some rye IPA’s it is still a tasty tippable brew that was highly satisfying.","brurevu","Sep 03, 2013"

Bitterness hits you right away. Bitterness just gets stronger with the rye taste coming out at the end. The bitter aftertaste persists for a long time. Hopheads will like it just for the bitter aspect. Malty rye predominates the taste.  Very slight fruitiness at the with a smoother caramel like taste.  More impressed with this beer than last year.  I may have gotten a fresher batch this year, though.","jngrizzaffi","Aug 29, 2013"

Interestingly, the citrusy-peppery hop quality, the juicy crystal malts, and the well-tuned attenuation altogether give me an impression of a stronger type of Kentish Pale Ale brewed with Kentish citrusy hops and spicy Styrian Goldings even! This has to be my very first rye-related beer, and I’d say, well done!","wl0307","Jun 12, 2013"

The rye lends a strong peppery punch, and really is the backbone of this beer. The hops lend a fruit, floral aspect that really play fantastically off the rye. I enjoy everything about this beer, I am sad it is a seasonal. This is probably my new favorite of the rye beers that have come to market lately.","TastyTaste","Jun 11, 2013"
3.92,0.8,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Pours clear and copper with a half finger head that fell off to to a thin skin on top. Some lacing. Nose is mellow but distinct with rye and while the malt is light on the nose they seem to be put together well. Some floral hops come up lightly like straw. As it warmed there was a little honey quality to the hops. Taste is delectable. Grainy malt, spicy rye, some grapefruit, and piney hops. Everything in balance with a creamy, smooth, sticky, piney, bitter hop finish. This was a substantial rye IPA , easy to drink and a vigorous tonic at that!","utopiajane","Jun 10, 2013"

It leaves a chalky hungover taste in your mouth after you drink 10 and wake up without brushing your teeth, but that's the life of a true alcoholic.

Flavor is mild caramel malt, grassy and piney hops and a moderate dose of rye. The spiciness of the rye and bitterness of the hops predominate--I would have liked a bit more malt for some sweetness and balance. This is a beer that couldn't really decide what it wants to be--it needs more hops and rye to be a really aggressive rye IPA. Or it needs more caramel sweetness to be a more ""mainstream"" beer. Instead, they split the difference and the result, while good, is not as good as it could have been.","BeerRefugee","May 16, 2013"

Flavor is pronounced northwest coast hops, rye spice, slight grapefruit and excellent pine notes. Mouthfeel is of medium thickness with medium carbonation that makes it easy to drink.

The smell was full of citrus and resin and a little bit of sweet fruit on the back end. It smelled a lot like a bowl of hops resting in water; very fresh. The taste was not as sweet; very spicy like a rye beer, but the sweet malt sits there in the front with that spicy rye flavor on top. It was very tasty and had a nice bittering hop flavor. The hops flavor was backseat by far though. it was pretty fizzy overall with a pretty full mouthfeel, approaching the oiliness of a big IPA. Overall, this beer is pretty awesome overall. Well balanced between a classic IPA and a rye beer.","estlinska","Mar 12, 2013"

Aromas are earthy rye coupled with citric, grapefruity hops, and mild pine. It smells a bit light struck, as did the previous three from this 6-pack, but I've had this before and I'll just ignore it as artifact so to speak. Tastes are spicy rye, earth, biscuit, dank resious, grapefruity hop, pine; astringent on the finish. Thinner body, moderate carbonation, oily hop resins stick and linger on the palate while finishing dry. Overall, very good, but I remember enjoying it more last year.","barnzy78","Feb 26, 2013"

It is simple, straightforward, not overly complex, refreshing, but not lacking in flavor. Very drinkable and like I said, it is amazing with pizza. The color is simply gorgeous, a deep reddish amber, but perfectly transparent. Thick head and sticky lacing top it off. Some very fine particles of sediment can be seen suspended in the brew, likely the rye. Smell is mostly of the resinous hops, but has more bread and grain and less citrus and fruit than most IPAs. Taste is fairly standard for an IPA up front leaving behind some bread and malt on the back of the palate along with some mild rye flavor. Not tons of rye, but enough to keep you interested. Great beer, easy to find, and the price is right.","Samuel906","Feb 25, 2013"

Actually if I had to pick a thing that could set it apart, it would be the great balance between the malt and hops in both the aroma and the taste. This is a tasty and very drinkable beer, and I think Sierra Nevada picks the perfect time of year to release a beer like this. The little bit of spice from the rye is reminiscent of some holiday beers, but its grainy nature mixed with the nice hop bouquet has me feeling like spring is coming. Another nice beer from Sierra Nevada.","BlackBelt5112203","Feb 15, 2013"

It’s got a ton of flavor, and the rye malt offers a different dimension that might hook non-craft drinkers but also adds some nice variety to what most hopheads are probably accustomed to. It’s not the best rye beer I’ve had but it’s a very solid contender, and I’d recommend this to lots of folks. Keep up the good work Sierra Nevada, you guys are really killing it these days (see my reviews for Hoptimum, Narwhal, Torpedo, etc.).","fmccormi","Jan 26, 2013"

The beer gave off a good aroma, mainly with a very strong pine hop aroma with the rye in the background. There also appeared to be a hint of spice as well. The taste of the beer was more balanced than I thought it would be. A nice bready and rye with a slightly more dominate pine and citrus hop taste. The beer had a moderate feel to it, it was clean, creamy, and it left a nice dry and refreshing finish. Overall, another quality beer from this quality brewer.","PhillyStyle","Jan 22, 2013"

Tastes of earthy and piney hops and a tad of rye, but not too much. Would probably be stronger if fresh, but still very nice bite. Beer has good carbonation and a nice finish. Overall, a very good beer.","cyclonece09","Dec 03, 2012"

Taste is malty and spicy initially, rey fairly prominent, lightly sweet, floral hop and pine, some juicy citrus, pineapple with more rye in the finish. Medium carbonation and body, good feel.

The bitterness from the hops does kick in at the end along with the alcohol, which does remind you that you're drinking an IPA. It's much more malty and the rhy really comes out in the smell and the taste. The smell is strong. Toasted rhy bread, with some grassy crispness. If you want a serious IPA don't go for this, but if you're looking for something a little unique, this has it.","cambabeer","Jul 26, 2012"
4.49,15.4,3.5,4.5,5,4,4,"I employed an aggro pour so as to release the aromatics and at the same time, create so much tawny head that there was a cascading action at the junction between the foam and the liquid. My strategy was sound as I ended up with just better than two fingers of head that resembled the top of an ice cream cone, plus the kitchen smelled like I had sprayed air freshener. It smelled of pine, mint and black pepper and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium and the admixture of the rye and hops on the tongue was literally breathtaking. It tasted of pepper and fresh mint and was just beautiful! The heavy, sticky lacing that began to appear was going to need a hammer and chisel to remove. Finish was likewise dry and peppery-minty. Whew. What a way to open the day!","woodychandler","Jul 26, 2012"

Thin white head, with small bits of lacing. Really spicy aroma. Taste was pleasant with enough hops of front to stand out, but the spice from the rye added a nice balance. Mouthfeel was manageable. The 6.6 abv was not really noticeable. I found this beer to be tasty and refreshing, and a nice beer to enjoy on it's own.","morebeergood","Jun 03, 2012"

My nose was lit up as I took in the inviting smell of spice, citrus and oh those hops. Every sip you are required to savor the taste and enjoy the carbonation as is glides down your throat. I hope that Sierra Nevada decides to make this beer year round, as I have been sending them letters asking so. If you have not tried this beer I would recommend it ANY time you see it! I am glad to have had the pleasure to enjoy such a well crafted beer.","naharah","Jun 02, 2012"

Deep bronze hued liquid, clear with an orange to yellow tint at the glass bottom, the bubbles are tiny and spread wide, shines brightly. The rye gives the nose a pleasing rugged to raw feel, scrubs deeply, fairly herbal with grapefruit pith and unprocessed grains, rock salt, you only get the powdered chocolate as it warms, any flowers or fruit muted. Medium-bodied, muscular in feel, flexes more than flows, the carbonation isn’t aggressive nor creamy, just nudges things now and then. The orange, tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus starts out sweet and then yields to the herbaceousness, pine cone and rye. The peach, apricot, pineapple fruit speaks more clearly here. Light toastiness but not doughy nor bready per se. Hard to find a distinct flavor profile to the malts, at most basic milk chocolate.

While I expected this beer to be more bitter, I was surprised to be greeted by a sweet and noticeably malty start to the flavor, with a sweet citrus aspect too, but it did fade out with a good bitter hop finish. Although I do detect the 'graininess' of the Rye, I would like it to be more pronounced. The beer is a little sticky, coating the mouth well but it is rather light bodied.

One whiff makes the mouth water. It's medium bodied and quite smooth and lively in the mouth. The finish is dry and crunchy. It tastes nice and bitter with the main flavor being tangerine peel. After the swallow, there's a wave of rye whiskey flavor. The taste of bitter citrus is sustained for a while. There's a juiciness throughout, but not really any sweetness.

It pours a beautifully hazy red-copper color with a large head. The aroma is fantastic, there's a great amount of spicy rye balanced with a very unique herbal, yet aggressive hop that works fantastically with the rye. The taste is also fantastic, the rye contributes such a great spiciness and just a touch of sweetness. Those flavors blend perfectly with the very unique hop flavor this beer has - it's hop forward, but not the typical citrus or pine hop you'll find in an IPA. It's a bizarre, yet delicious very strong herbal and earthy hop that blends fantastically with the rye flavors. The mouthfeel is spot-on, and the drinkability is fantastic. It's probably the best rye beer I've had, hands-down. For this beer to be this affordable is just about unfair for the other beers on the shelf. Highly recommended.","shand","Mar 07, 2012"

Poured from my system to a pint glass the beer pours a perfectly clear dark copper color with a 2 finger white/cream colored head with excellent retention with lots of lacing remaining. The aroma is big with a lot of peppery spice, rye, citrus, and piney hop character. I enjoy the blend of spice from the rye and west coast hop tones. The flavor starts with the same intense rye pepper spice on the tongue. The hop character found in the nose comes through and again melds well with the spice. A foundation of caramel malt. Medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean with a lingering pepper hop on the tongue. Upper end of medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a really good representation of a Rye IPA. I'm enjoying it very much and would easily recommend.","hopfacebrew","Feb 29, 2012"

Lots of clingy, sticky lace. Good looking beer. Nose of piney/citrus crisp hops, a bit bready, a bit sweet. On the tongue it’s sharp and crisp with a medium-hoppy flavor that’s strong yet still could be enjoyed over the course of several servings. I hate to say peppery because that’s what it says on the bottle, but lo and behold, it is peppery indeed, in a refreshing, complementary way. Wheaty, sweet-ish malt backbone, dry bitter finish. Slightly astringent hints of alcohol. Mouth is crisp and moderately bubbly. Overall, a solid IPA, nothing spectacular. Nothing really stands out about this “rye” IPA to me; it could be any other competent IPA. Definitely worth a try, though.","jettjon","Feb 29, 2012"

Anyway, this stuff pours a deep amber topped by over a finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, lemon peel, rye spice, grass, and light flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spice really standing out quite nicely against the backdrop of grasses and citrus fruits (rinds and all, baby). It's similar to a rye-d-up version of SNPA. Nice. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice rye IPA, one that I wouldn't mind seeing year-round (though, 'til then, I'm more than happy to see this one in the Spring instead of that Glissade nonsense).","TMoney2591","Feb 19, 2012"

I'd say in terms of quality they are dead even, with this beer being a bit less in terms of strong flavor. I liked this quite a bit and am actually glad it doesn't wallop you over the head with hops power. The ""IPA"" part is under-expressed here, and again I'm glad this is not a hop bomb. Hops are present and slightly strong, but blended with the rye and the woodsy malt flavors the overall feel is more warm and spicy than the typical citrus/pine IPA onslaught.

Sierra Nevada knows what's up when it comes to aromatic hops. Love the nose on the one. Sharp green hops, citrus rind, with an herbal finish. The body lends itself well to this hybrid. Moderate depth and decent carbonation bolster up this spicy beer. The rye imparts a subtle smack of spicy twang, but nothing over the top. Lip-smacking juicy hops abound, as expected and hoped for. Another SN trademark. These characteristics meld very well together, leaving me sipping and gulping for more. Mild sweetness in the middle, but then rounded out with another smack of bitterness.

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours out a brownish copper color. Nice thick frothy head. One thing I noticed is that like their Torpedo IPA there is no thin layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle. The smell is of citric hops, and some tropical fruits. Now the taste is what throws me. Reminds me a heck of a lot of their other IPA Torpedo, and it makes me wish it were more like Celebration in that the dominating flavor profile are these wild tropical hops, some spicyness afforded by the rye and touch of black pepper. I was hoping for more grapefruity, piney hops like in Celebration. Not much pine, but lots of mango! Overall I think it is very good, I just think the choice of hops competes with the rye too much. I wish the rye could have shone through the hops a little more. I noticed on their website that some of the hops are simply described as ""experimental"". Now that is cool...Bravo hops are the bittering hops?? Anyway, the Citra hops make a grand appearance in this beer like them or not and this beer is complex and interesting from these west coast hops masters. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Overall a very good beer just not enough rye for me, i.e. Cane & Ebel. But for the record this is leaps and bounds better than Glissade which it replaces.

The nose has quite a prominent rye character, rather rustic, grainy, and spicy with white pepper (not caraway). This pairs very well with the pine and citrus that the hops bring to the table. The hops have a nice blend of bittering and flavor, though not quite as resiny as I'd like. Still, excellent. The palate opens with a blend of the rye flavors and the hops, rather excellently executed. Pleasing bitterness with a blend of citrus peel, pine and a little grapefruit, these flavors work very well with the peppery rye. All dark grain character appears to be quite fully fermented, lending a toasted grain flavor without any real sweetness. Drying on the finish with a blend of pine and rye, there's a little citrus sweetness to go with the pine resin. Medium light in body with creamy carbonation, this is expertly conditioned and is a treat on the palate. Highly recommended, this along with Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye define what a hoppy rye beer can be.","DefenCorps","Feb 04, 2012"

Minimal lacing around the glass, but you can for sure see the hop oil drizzling down from time to time. The smell was citrusy, not as much rye as some of the others I've had (Red's Rye, Hop Rod, etc.) but it was still there. Taste was of an average IPA for me, not much alcohol bite (6.60%) decent carbonation on this one. Overall it was more of an IPA with a hint of rye, but enjoyable and worth trying none the less.

An interesting and complex combination of rye bread, tangy citrus and light pine hop aromas that allow just a touch of maltiness to sneak through. Medium bodied with a thick smooth feel. Much like the aromas the flavors are complex and very unique. The first flavor that hit was like the first time I bit into a rye bread seed, a bit spicy and grainy. A combination of ripe citrus and light pine hop flavors followed with a sweet caramel malt backbone fighting through. The more I try beers with rye malt the more I wonder why it isn’t more common.

The smell is typical sierra nevada west coast hops with a touch of something a bit different, a peppery spice likely from the rye. The taste too is much like an IPA but a bit weak in terms of the bitterness. The malt base is relatively solid and again the rye comes through as a bit of extra spice. The body is thick and nicely filling while this beer finishes with a nice lingering spiciness that tends to build as it warms and the session goes on. Overall it is similar to other sierra nevada hop focused beers but as stated earlier a bit weak on the hop bitterness (especially for an IPA).

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"another great sierra seasonal. pours a gorgeous deep copper color with a lively white head fluffy as can be. smells fresh hops and spicy pumpernickel bread. flavor is quite hoppy, but its butter and sweet. resiny hops. also theres the rye coming in after the hops, sturdy but light on the tongue. mouthfeel is nice too, most rye beers turn my off by sitting in my gut, but this one is down easy, mucho sessionable. love the finish here, stands up well to pickled garlic and asiogo flatbread. even though sierra is expanding, their beer is still as good as any micro operation in the country. i pray it stays that way","StonedTrippin","Jan 26, 2012"

The aroma is more earthy then I was expecting, but I guess that's what the rye adds. There are notes of pine and citrus with spicy earthy aromas. The taste of the beer is also very earthy and spicy with a lingering bitterness on the finish. The carbonation is medium-high and perhaps bordering on too high, but is still quite drinkable due to its medium body. Good beer, glad I tried it, but wont go out of my way to seek it out again.","jamescain","Jan 26, 2012"

4.63,19,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured in to a pint glass. Wow, this looks fantastic. Thick, creamy white head with a generous amount of sticky lacing that just clings to the glass. The beer itself is a cooper/burgundy hue, with some fine bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The aroma is quite complex. Initially, I’m struck by the hop profile. Nice, grapefruit notes, followed quickly by a strong, yet balanced rye scent. As it warms, more tropical fruit notes make their presence known, and a caramel sweetness begins to take over. At times, the beer seems to take on a sweet tartness (kind of like the candy). As the beer approaches room temperature, it begins to take on a funky, musty, aroma. Maybe also a touch of simcoe like aroma as well. The taste, is crisp, with a strong hop punch at the start. Fresh hops on the tongue, followed by a lingering, drying bitterness. The rye also balances the brew nicely, providing more of a balance to the aggressive hoping. The abv is well concealed. Very nice. The mouth feel is medium bodied.

Aroma is of rye, a bit of peppery spice, and pine. Taste starts smooth, with the rye flavor. It glides across the tongue until I get to the strong pine hops. As I taste the pine hops I get a little jolt in my soft palate, a twinge of pepper, then it's back to the hop flavors, notably the citrus hops. Aftertaste is of the rye and pepper.

3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 47 degrees. Pours a translucent amber with a frothy, 1.5 inch cream-colored head that eventually settles into a thin consistent skim. Creamy, textured bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat forward - earthy/herbal/peppery/spicy with just a trace of citrus. Taste follows nose - this beer, has a very prominent herbal/spicy character almost akin to a rustic bread and a farmhouse cheese pairing. Once the spice resides, a residual biscuity quality expresses itself, finishing with a slightly bitter/earthy hops presence. Mouthfeel is very pleasant; medium-light in body with a lively, almost bright carbonation and just a touch of acidity. Overall, I think this is an interesting take on the style; something of an American IPA/Rye beer hybrid. Flavors are distinct and complex, albeit there is not much in the way of a hops presence. Also, I find that one in a sitting is enough in that the flavors are a bit too assertive for prolonged consumption. That said, I'm happy to see a major craft brewer take on a Rye beer - nice job SN.","Jwale73","Jan 20, 2012"

4.01,3.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall I thought that this was a good Rye Beer and it lives up to being labeled as a Rye IPA. This beer was heavy on the rye but it also had a lot of hops and I thought that added great balance and it helped draw some attention away from all that rye. I thought this beer had slightly above average drinkability, I might be down to have another one but after that I think the pretty intense flavors would start to wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, to me this beer was firing on all cylinders. What I liked least about this beer was that weird burnt plastic aroma, it wasn't that bad but it seemed like the only thing that was slightly out of place in this beer. I will for sure buy this beer again but to me this is a one a night kind of beer so a twelve pack may be too much, but I think a six pack would be just enough. If you are a Rye Beer fan I highly recommend this beer, but if you are a big IPA fan you may find the rye a little too dominating. This beer was a nice surprise from Sierra Nevada, there wasn't much hype surrounding this new release, but that may have been a good thing since highly hyped beers go within a day or two in my neck of the woods. The only other Rye Beer I have reviewed was Rich's Rye from Short's and I liked this beer much more, the hops complimented the Rye much more then it did in Rich's Rye, so this makes Ruthless Rye my favorite Rye Beer to date, good job Sierra Nevada this was one good Rye Beer is a welcomed addition to their solid lineup.","StoutHunter","Jan 19, 2012"
3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O- I believe this is my first rye based beer and it is a noticeable difference. The word ""earthy"" seemed to be used a lot in other reviews, but it definitely is dead on.

More resinous, piney hops than the Pale but not quite as in-your-face as Torpedo. Still has the similar hop-cocktail flavor of both, perhaps a similar mix of hops is used in all 3.

Pouring into a pint glass reveals a darker amber liquid, perfectly clear, with a small bubbly off-white head that recedes to a small ringlet. Very little carbonation to be seen. Aroma is grainy with a pronounced crisp hop scent. Taste is grainy, a bit skunky I think, but well within the threshold of tolerance, hop bitterness--pine and citrus notes--subdued malts, and a definite bready rye quality that comes in at least mid-palate. Quite bitter in the aftertaste; grapefruit pith. Fairly easy to drink. Pretty nice overall.","Rifugium","Jan 18, 2012"

Caraway seeds soaked in grapefruit juice is what i keep getting when i stick my nose in, impressed. The mouth is much the same very bready from the rye, and the piny, citrus hops just fill the body and the finish, a slight amount of booze sneaking its way in too. Medium bodied, semi tart/bitter, tons of fruit and rye characters throughout, finishes dry and begging for more.

Color wise bright ruby copper colored beer we need in this post holiday recovery mode for everybody. After drinking spiced ales with cinnamon, honey, and all spice for a month and a half, I fully praise Sierra Nevada for releasing this beer. Aroma has hints of pine and citrus with a spicy rye layer that definitely adds a layer of complexity to the mix. Flavor hits with a clashing layer of malt/rye versus earthy/pine hops, pretty intense here no bias noted, I'm a lover of both malts and hops. Easy to drink well balanced between the waves of piney/citrus hops and spicy rye malt, moderate carbonation slick oily hop textures going on. Overall a welcomed seasonal to mix up the ever changing lineup of Sierra Nevada, I'll be drinking more of this.","WVbeergeek","Jan 13, 2012"

Strands of sticky white lacing cling to the glass. Aroma is of lemon and orange citrus, rye, earthen hops, and some light floral notes. Tastes predominantly of rye and lemon zest, with ample citrus hop esters and pine resin coming through as well. Some orange and earthen grains finish it off. Mouthfeel is crisp, light on the tongue, and refreshing at first, but a small amount of the rye flavor seems to build up and linger after a bit.

3.92,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this is 2012 vintage. The beer is a crystal clear, crisp, bronze coloring with a tremendous, towering, big bubbled, foamy off-white head that has an unreal retention. It stays forever, it seems. Aromas are heavy roasted grain, a slight peppery spicing, and a subtle bouquet of citrus. Very well blended nose. The beer's flavors are burnt, with a toasted cereal taste to the forefront, followed by a slightly resiny hops presence that has a solid citrus tartness. There are peppery spicing notes all over the palate that tingle the tastebuds while you drink. There is a good transition into the aftertaste, which is heavy in roasty/toasty characteristics that are blended and balanced with a light citrus sweetness. The finish is slick, with a resiny feel left behind in mouth, and a slight peppery bite throughout the roof of the mouth. This is a tasty rye...good representation and blending of some very strong ingredients.","GarthDanielson","Jan 12, 2012"

There is just the smallest bits of white bubbles towards the edge of the glass that die when on the surface, lifeless beer, no stick. smell is rye malt to the max with some faint caramel and a spicy sense. Some piney resins come up to with more whiffs. Taste is even between the rye and the IPA. Rye comes first than a small hit of pined hops. Small traces of caramel throughout. feel is a bit thin, I would say bordering on thin. Carb comes and goes off of the tounge, leaving a resinous effect afterwards. Bitterness is not that large, the rye malt takes care of that. I can say that while this was a noble attempt, it just misses the mark for me.

Before, I either liked a beer or didn't, without regard for why. The first word that popped into my head after a couple of sips of the Rye was ""round", and the Coastal Fog was ""flat"" (not flat as in, no carbonation, just lacking complexity). Ruthless had a nice malt taste, which I'm still figuring out how to articulate, and just enough hops to keep me drinking it.

4.07,4.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Ruthless Rye is a fantastic IPA that hits the stride on the style while introducing the rye grains that seem to reinforce hop bitterness and flavor- each elevating the other. Moderate intesity allows for high level of drinkability which could be quite dangerous for an IPA lover like me.","BEERchitect","Jan 07, 2012"
2.92,-24.9,3.5,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"The aroma was great, but the flavor was ultimately too tart and feel too acidic. I can't see myself drinking more than one a night. There's just too much rye in there. It almost tastes like copper towards the end, and I'm not a huge fan of metallic tastes in my beer. This one coulda been a contender.","Philousa","Jan 07, 2012"
4.18,7.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and citrus. Taste is delicious. Citrus and hops up front, some rye and malts at the finish, very flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality beer worth seeking out.","tone77","Jan 07, 2012"
4.07,4.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a rye showcase which I think will make it a bit more polarizing than some of the other well known rye's, but I'm sold. A good beer by sierra even if it replaces a beer that imo should have been kept.","bobhits","Jan 06, 2012"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this Rye IPA on tap at the brewery before a meal in the restaurant. Nice coppery color, nice thick, long lasting head and pleasant grassy aroma. Not as bitter as other IPAs. I really enjoyed this beer. So much so I picked up a 6 pack in the gift shop for testing from the bottle.","marshrat63","Beers"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I just saw this for the first time today and had to give it a shot. I always love trying new Sierra brews. Pours a deep amber/copper color with a nice fluffy head. Aroma is a bit spicy, but mostly big citrus hops. A nice mix for sure. Taste is similar to other sierra pale/ipa's, but with a little extra bready spice from the rye malt. The hop character is quite nice mixed with the rye. Finishes with a good amount of bitterness, but not over the top. Mouthfeel is good for an IPA, has some substance to it. Overall this is very nice new offering from one of the most solid all around breweries around. I'm very rarely disappointed from SN, a very solid beer.","khumbard","Jan 06, 2012"

4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.25,"O: Almost everything about this beer seems beyond criticism. The only thing I found slightly objectionable was the high amount of grapefruit rind bitterness in relation to hoppy flavor in the aftertaste. It looks great and has exactly the mouthfeel, aroma and taste one should expect in a true rye IPA. A great choice for IPA lovers who want something a bit out of the main stream.","chinchill","Jan 04, 2012"

3.79,-2.6,5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O: Reminds me an awful lot like torpedo with lots of rye. A really interesting beer for sure. I don't know what I was expecting but it doesn't quite live up to it. Definitely not bad though.","tony223366","Jan 03, 2012"
4.42,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"  Pours a pretty golden amber color that's a shade usually seen around sunset. Not much in the way of head, but the carbonation is lively. Aroma of spicy rye malt and sharp, floral hops, with notes of grass and a light caramel sweetness. Palate is hop forward with a nice sharp, spicy note from the rye. The flavors become more balanced and mellow on the swallow, with a hint of orange peel and caramel malt helping to offset the considerable bitterness, which lingers for a while on the finish. Body is lively and a touch creamy, a great vehicle for the flavors on display here.","ElGordo","Jan 02, 2012"

If you like Torpedo or a SN devotee then you'll probably like this beer. If you are looking for something unique or groundbreaking then you'll be disappointed.","TheFlern","Dec 31, 2011"
3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"From a bottle in to a 16 oz pint glass. Very clear reddish copper. Thin off-white head with almost no lacing. Smells peppery with a hint of citrus. Grapefruit bitterness and earthy spices on the tongue, crisp with a dry finish. Should go great with the spicy ribs on the grill!","teksmeks","Dec 30, 2011"

4.18,7.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, an excellent new offering from Sierra. I know it's another ""IPA", but this is different. Reminds me of some of the Harvest beers, but with more graininess, and nice spicy rye notes. Very drinkable and enjoyable.","flexabull","0"

3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Saw an add for this in a beer mag and finally picked up a twelver at Safeway for $12.97. Not bad. On to the beer...sweet looking label. Comic-bookish and nice to look at as the consuming proceeds. Pours a nice amber color with a cream colored frothy head and nice lacing. The aroma is big-time rye oriented. Big rye blasts on each whiff and a slight rubber aroma also. Definitely malt in the background as well. The taste is more rye with a big rye/malt/hoppy bite throughout the buds. Slight citrus in the background. Grapefruit rind is what I'm getting. Bitter and dry aftertaste. Overall if you like Rye, the SN crew really lays it on here. The combo works for me though and I love the effort placed on this new beer. For the price it is very worthy. Nicely done.","kaseydad","0"
