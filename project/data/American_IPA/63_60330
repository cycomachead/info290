3.94,-7.1,3.75,4,4,3.5,4,"It pours just a shade lighter (and pinker) than copper, with light tan, sudsy head, leaving huge pillows of lace behind. Grapefruit and fainter orange citrus aromas at the fore, masking still-detectable caramel. Taste is not as fruity as either the aromas or the description would let on, but still more so than your average IPA. Much more piney and resinous on the palate, but bitterness is subdued at first, and citrus, as well as mango and rind still come into play. Sweet fruity character dissipates as it lingers, but hop bitterness doesn't really set in motion until the drink has been washed down your gullet for several seconds, giving your tongue time to aerate and warm. By then, it's almost like gagging on a metal spoon, but in a good way. A smooth, easy-drinking beverage with medium body and medium carbonation.","Libeertarian","Thursday at 11:14 PM"

Settles to a constant froth layer on top with quite a bit of lacing going on as well.  Smells of pine, grass, and citrus with a grapefruit/tangerine combo must up front.  Taste is of grapefuit, melon, grass, and pine.  Pretty heavy medium bodied brew with some hop bitterness  on the palate but balanced just right.  I found that even with some pretty high ratings already I think Fresh Squeezed lived up to my expectations.  Overall, an easy to drink ipa that is well balanced, flavorful, and yet pretty complex.","dpgoblejr","Wednesday at 05:33 PM"

Floral, fruity hop flavor with lingering oily resins on a bed of fresh grain.  Creamy melon, stone fruit, and berries.  Plush medium body.  Fruity, as expected - fruitier than I tend to prefer actually, but undoubtedly well-crafted.","wedge","Mar 24, 2015"

Hops are juicy. It sorta smells like a hop medley instead of any specific scents. Sweet citrus, some spicy hops and band aid. Some grassy aromas, too. It doesn't scream Citra and Mosaic hops. A bit of peach hop. I enjoy the flavor more. Actually far more balanced than the name leads me to believe. Candied citrus, hops with some spicy hops, more sweet/fruity hops, some pine and a notable amount of sugary, cara-bread malt. Finishes with medium bitterness. Moderate carbonation. Was expecting something a bit different. Still decent.

It poured a clear, deep amber with little head or lacing to follow. The aroma is slight and of citrus - not enticingly floral as some of the better American IPAs. Fresh hops tease the tongue but rapidly yield to an imposing malty presence. Hops linger slightly albeit eclipsed by a piquant quality: the mouthfeel of a peppery tripel without the saccharine richness of that genre. It's a unique American IPA with merits which will appeal to fans of saisons, Belgians, and casual IPA fans alike, but maybe not ideal for the dedicated hop-head, whose preferences - in fairness - my biases probably reflect. It strikes me as ideal for pairing with fish.","mdexter","Mar 01, 2015"

This is world class as far as a regular IPA goes. I used to compare every beer with this hop character to LT Limbo but now ill be comparing them to Fresh Squeezed. As it warms i literally taste tropical, stone, and citrus fruits individually all at once. Highly recommended","Bone53","Jan 21, 2015"

Nice lacing, all day long. Explosion of grapefruit, everything citrus, clean bitrerness, fantastic aromas. Grapefruit up front, super clean, balanced, right amount of bitterness, that hint of Mosaic, very hop forward, just a hint of biscuit. Medium mouthfeel, right on the $$$ for an IPA IMO! Clean is the name of the game! Lived up to my expectations and then some. Love Deschutes! Seek this out!","Mikus","Dec 25, 2014"

Citrus hops flavor matches the aroma, but it is well balanced by the malt presence. Not as bitter as expected for a west-coast IPA. The hops bitterness/citrus lingers in the aftertaste, but does not linger too long. I really like this one. More like a pale ale than a west coast style American IPA.

Scents of tropical fruit, with an overt presence of mango and pineapple, light grapefruit, light sweetly tart tangerine and orange, hints of pine resin, a nice presence of fruity esters of an indeterminate nature and light biscuity malt in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a very fruity IPA with a big hit of citrus and tropical fruit aromas and a little bit of malt. Very nice, bright and appealing. Flavor begins with medium-bitterness and a wonderful flavor of tropical fruit with notes of papaya and mango, juicy tangerine and bitter tangerine and orange peel. This moves into a middle with high bitterness and strong notes of grapefruit and tangerine peel, with a moderate presence of pine resin and medium-light tropical fruit and tangerine. Finish is dry with notes of grapefruit peel, pine resin, and indeterminate citrus peel. Aftertaste is pine resin, citrus peel and light grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a bright, fruity, citrus forward IPA that is wonderfully bitter and very well done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, creamy with a resinous finish and a medium-high carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a classic wonderful IPA that is quite easy to drink. Overall this is an excellent IPA with a bright, citrusy, fruity aroma and flavor that is quite appealing and a nice mouthfeel that is very eat to drink. A wonderful IPA.","Auraan","Nov 09, 2014"

That complex nose carries through to the palate where I got a smorgasboard of fruit flavors: lemon, lime, orange, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango. It was light and easy drinking and poured a deep amber with a white head. Really pleased this is now offered year round as it's a fantastic IPA with a lot of depth.

The downside to having the word 'fresh' on a label means in 20 years the label will remain, in spite of the changes within.  Kind of toffee, malty like taste, with muted orange flavours.  Tastes good, just no longer fresh.","patre_tim","Oct 21, 2014"

Bursting tropical grapefruit, pineapple and an unbelievably fresh orange and lemon zest aroma with a strong malty presence and hints of pine. Medium bodied with subtle, yet tangy carbonation through the middle. Fresh orange and lemon hop flavors up front followed grapefruit and pineapple into the middle. Tropical flavors transition briefly to a minty freshness and then to bitter pine hops at the end. Strong malty backbone throughout. Finished semi-dryly with a light lingering hop bitterness. An incredible display of hop aromas and flavors.","IronLover","Sep 02, 2014"

The beer smell has a very tropical note with hints of mango, light apple cider, and a bit of honey sweetness to take down the hoppiness a little bit. The beer taste is similar to the smell but with stronger notes than  and a bit more bitter and grapefruit hop note. The malt also comes out a little bit. The beer mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a medium body but on the heavier side with very light carbonation. Overall, a very good and tropical IPA. Totally worth drinking again.","HattedClassic","Sep 01, 2014"

The flavor starts with a straight shot of hop resin, floral hop components, lemongrass, honeycomb and tea leaf. There's a nutty caramel backbone and a bitter pine finish. Fairly light easy drinking IPA. I don't get a lot of the Citra, mostly Mosaic, and this is pretty fresh, so I can't give it much higher a score.","KYGunner","Aug 22, 2014"

All I know is that when I open this bottle and pour it into my favorite glass I can barely enjoy the damn thing for drinking it too fast! What a beautiful thing that has happened to the beer industry when I am the beneficiary of so many microbreweries producing product like never before. If you dont feel lucky about that then you arent a true beer lover. And if you don't love this beer, you dont drink enough of it to know. The aroma is divine, the initial taste is hop and citrus heaven and you will probably make that face or roll your eyes...you know, when something is so good you look at someone and dont care at all how you seem because you know the truth. That's what this beer is...THE TRUTH! I would love to find another beer that comes as close as this one does to being the perfect beer (maybe Little Sumpin) and if I find it, I'll let you know. In the meantime, kiss anyone who gives you this beer right on the mouth like Lydia Loveless would.","Boneswally","Jul 22, 2014"

Color is a fairly light orange-yellow with ample white head of intermediate persistence. I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this particular brew in Alberta and I will generally agree that the name is apt. This one is super juicy, with the nose and palate a veritable fruit bowl of citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime), blueberry (!), stone fruit (nectarines and cherries), blackberry, and tropical (pineapple, passion fruit). The malts are not terribly sweet and I might even be tasting a little grain, along with something more astringent in the fruit/medicinal realm (vitamin C tablet) and a nondescript sweetness that is perhaps somewhat odd ... Almost an artificial sweetner note which fortunately remains subtle. Apparently certain hops can yield this effect. Anyhow, there is also a little pine, mostly in the semi-dry finish. Despite the fruitiness there is a distinct impression of bitterness front to back. Interesting contrast that adds complexity. Alcohol discernable but appropriately so. All in all, this is a great Mosaic showcase, with some unique blueberry and strawberry flavors to complement the more typical Citra elements. Dare I say that it could be just a hair more malty? Anyhow, hope this sticks around these parts.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 21, 2014"

Fresh Squeezed IPA is damn near perfection in a 12oz. bottle. HUGE hop flavor that's perfectly balanced by malt presence, a mild mouthfeel that keeps this quaffable even in the heat of summer, and an ABV under 7%, which certainly makes this relatively sessionable and perfect for gameday or BBQs! If I were wearing a hat right now, I'd be tipping it to Deschutes. Truly a great beer.","ThePaintedGrey","Jun 26, 2014"

This is just such a nice representation of each of the hop profiles here, and they blended beautifully across their similarities. Fresh Squeezed proves that the west coast can make an IPA without trying to kill you with hop bitterness. They run in the other direction but again, we were nicely surprised to find how sweet this beer is upfront. By the end, however, you do get a lot more of the organic, dirty bitterness from the hops, making for a nice progression and an ultimately pleasing contrast. This guy disappeared so fast we almost had to crack another two to finish the review. Hell, we’ll crack another two anyway, because this is one fine beverage.","TheBrewo","May 30, 2014"

Cloudy coppery red-orange colored liquid, its semi-opacity makes it difficult to see many bubbles, overall bright in a metallic way. Sweetly juicy and dense nose comprised of pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus and pineapple, mango, nectarine, peach fruit, the pine is ultra-sappy as well, strong cocoa powder presence too, there seems to be a herbal bite under all the sweetness but who can really tell. Medium-bodied, a soft and frothy attack turns drier by the finish as the carbonation fades and here the herbaceousness comes out stronger. Chocolate, coconut, vanilla notes blend into that flavorful base of pine, grapefruit and nectarine, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, more confectionary here, pronounced maltiness. If there’s one area it comes up short it would be in thirst quenching refreshment, too gluey and heavy for that. That said, kudos for the powerful length of the primary flavors without it seeming tiringly redundant. Three bottles might be the most I could throw back in a sitting.","farrago","May 26, 2014"

Hops are fully up front in the flavor, bringing lots of tropical and citrus fruits. Malt body is very much present, giving off loads of caramel malts. Solid bitterness matches the sweetness.

The malt flavor is pretty subdued, especially compared to the Firestone, but the hops are very citrus forward in tasting, but not very obvious in the aroma. There's a hint of flowers or herbs and just slight bitterness in the aftertaste. This bottle was several months old, and I believe it is better consumed fresh.","joeworrall","Apr 26, 2014"

The yeast is relatively mild but adds a texture which is almost creamy or it could be the hop resins making the bitterness seem smoother as it gently fades toward a tangy yet mildly spicy finish.

Thought it was going to bigger from the reviews I read. Surprised how muted the citra was. The taste is a very drinkable amber ale with juicy fruity hop notes. Sweet line and maybe a tiny bit of tropical fruits are washed away by a toasted sticky sweet caramel background. The mouthfeel is the best part about this beer. It feels good in the mouth and on the tongue. Overall, it was decent at best...super drinkable. Not an in your face west coast style ipa.","djjacobsen","Mar 23, 2014"

Just a wonderful juicy beer. No other words can describe it. They better make this a six pack brew, or I'm gonna become poor really fast!

I was looking for something citra hopped or close to Zombie Dust( don't let anyone tell you there is a Zombie dust clone, It just doesn't exist) at my local Friar Tucks and this was recommended. Brought home a bomber bottle and was hooked. Fantastic smell, Sweet citrus and floral flavor with a nice piney aftertaste. No description will do it justice, just go try a bottle. Absolutely love this. Went out and bought the rest of their stock for the next few months. It's only a June-September seasonal so stock up while you can. you won't be disappointed. The only thing disappointing about this beer is that you will not be able to get more after you drink it all.","youknowmyname","Feb 10, 2014"

Sometimes I never understand why it takes so long for certain beers to make it to this market and it’s especially frustrating when it’s an IPA or something that needs to be consumed fresh. Thus by the time it made it to me its was a not so Fresh Squeezed IPA, but I figured it was still worth a taste. The brew poured a deep golden amber with a substantial head with very good lacing. The aroma was extremely bright and citrusy with lemons and grapefruit along with passionfruit and tropical fruit notes. All in all it was a great smelling IPA. The taste had an obvious citrus punch with some pine followed by the fruitiness. The hop profile was substantially bright and fresh, but I could imagine it would have been even stronger fresh. The slight hop fade allowed the strong bready caramel malt character to show through and it held all the hops together. Even so my palate was left with a nice bitter hop coating. The Fresh Squeezed IPA was a easy and smooth and a really wonderful IPA.","brurevu","Sep 30, 2013"

Aromas of tangerine, peach, pear, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pear, pineapple, orange zest, caramel, bread, toast, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Light earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, peach, pear, lemon zest, pineapple, orange zest, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop flavors; with a well balanced malt backbone and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 19, 2013"

It is sweet and bready for the style, but drinks pretty easily. While I enjoyed the huge fruit flavors here, it might be a bit simple and sweet if you need a palate crushing IPA or are looking for something to hold up to stronger food flavors.","spoony","Sep 14, 2013"

Nose was the hoppy citrus you would expect from the name. Taste followed, with citra hops dominant but nicely balanced with some nice, sweet malts. There wasn't much hint of alcohol nor was there a heavy, bitter aftertaste. Beer was medium body with decent carbonation. The lower ABV is a bonus, making this session able. I haven't bee the biggest fan of Deschutes but this will make me rethink that and I absolutely would come back to this beer.","regspeir","Sep 08, 2013"

The scent carried the wonderful aroma of citra hops....and it was fresh! The taste was a very well balanced IPA....there was very nice pine and citrus but they were escorted by a sweet caramelly malt which just made the beer fun to drink.

Taste is orange candies..seems sweet like marmalade, grapefruit pith, lemongrass, as I thought this seems to start sweet but really isn't cloying. Bitterness is mild throughout. Finish is dry and mostly clean. Body is lighter than medium probably could be called a bit watery, and it could be a little creamier. Overall, not sure what to make of this beer.

There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

Tastes are juicy and sweet with caramel, bready malt, mango (-and other tropical notes), more dank, wet hops, grapefruit, not overly bitter on the finish with exceptional balance, maybe a little on the sweeter side.

4.36,2.8,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark orange color with a hint of ruby. Has a finger length head of an off white color that dissipates fairly slowly and leaves a nice lacing. The citra hops really show through on the nose. Smells of tons of grapefruit, tangerine, papaya, mango, stone fruit. A little sweet breadiness in the background. Very juicy smell. Taste starts with dank grapefruit, mango, and other tropical fruits. Then get a nice crisp, bready sweetness from the malts that does not overpower the hop qualities at all, but complements them instead. Also get more stone fruit qualities. The finish comes more from the mosaic hops than the citra hops. Get tangerine, more grapefruit, some pine, some dank, herbal qualities as well. The sweetness from the malts stays throughout the finish and gently balances the very little bitterness imparted from the hops. Medium body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Pretty clean mouthfeel, which allows the juicy hops to shine. A really good ipa on the lighter side of the spectrum with two of my favorite hops. I would definitely get this again.","brewskis","Jul 06, 2013"

Finishes with citrus and citrus and piney hops, which are considerably restrained compared to the aroma. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The fruit notes are more noticeable than the malt or hops. An interesting sweet juicy take on an IPA, but I'd like a bit more herbal hops presence like the aroma.

Not surprisingly, tons of hoppy citrus notes on the nose: pineapple, citrus blossoms, tangerine, mandarin orange, kumquat Valencia orange, and hints of mango. The combined citrus present in the nose are also present in the taste, caramel malt balances this brew perfectly midpalate. Finishes with just the right amount of bitterness by way of hoppy orange rind accents. Fairly substantial malt backbone, medium bodied, slick, smooth with moderate carbonation. A fairly well-balanced IPA that delivers just the right amount of bitterness. Excellent use of citra and mosaic hops here.","chanokokoro","Jun 28, 2013"

Puffs up nicely and stick around for awhile, leaving plenty of lacing on the walls of the glass. The aroma is a mix of peachy mosaic and zesty citrus from the citra. There's also some mango, pineapple, blackberry and kiwi. Lots of tropical fruit, really. It's very fresh but a bit subdued. Based on the color, I was expecting more caramel malt flavor to pop up, but it's mostly just a background for the hops, and what's there blends in nicely. The taste has tons of hop flavor and nearly zero bland bitterness. It's just all fruity hops. Mild malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. The two hop varieties play very well together. Lots of light stone fruit, tropical fruit and citrus flavors. Hop flavors really coat the mouth in the finish. Mouthfeel is rather light. Some hop oiliness. Finishes pretty dry. Unsurprisingly, Deschutes did a fine job with this beer. It could just use a bit more punch to the aroma. Otherwise, it's rather excellent and exceedingly drinkable.

Malt character is minimal and is overshadowed by the hop nose. The palate is similar.  Excellent fruity hop flavors with a moderate hop bitterness, mildly oily and mildly pungent , there's peach, white grape and citrus flavors here.

There is also some dank earth and dirt, but the skunky MJ aroma is nearly overpowering and overwhelming. Flavors replicate the nose to some extent (obviously, the beer does not taste skunky), with just enought sweet malt to buoy the boatload of hoppy bitterness and pine. This is a very flavorful and dry IPA otherwise, with a long, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, with the beer showcasing a fairly long, almost mouthpuckeringly bitter finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though the huge, hoppy flavor profile was almost too much of a good thing. Still, it's hard not to be impressed with this totally over the top, in your face IPA.
