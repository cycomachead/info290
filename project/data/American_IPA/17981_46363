3.46,-19.2,4.5,3.5,3.25,4,3.25,"I spend a couple of months in Florida during the winter and the ABC folks down there do have a great selection.  I usually just pick up a few brands I haven't tried but this time I asked about what was popular down in Florida.  The guy told me this Jai Alai so I got a six pack.   As you can tell by the ratings - many rate it high.  Can't do it.  I found it oddly sweet and lacking a good hoppy flavor.  Rather flat in its carbonation as well.  So, in all fairness, let me say I like a strong IPA with a real hoppy bite.  I bought it in a can and usually don't do this.  I hope the difference isn't  that great.  Didn't finish the six pack.  But again, with a rating of 95+ I must be the oddball.  Good Luck.","HoppyADK","Wednesday at 04:22 PM"

This beer takes you there and its amazing, tough to say where it stacks on the top IPA list, it no doubt deserves consideration, I suppose a lot will be personal preference. For me this was especially zesty and tropical, pronounced grapefruit and melon notes, and especially bright. All together a showstopper.","mick303","Mar 10, 2015"

Malt and hop characteristics are well balanced and a hearty 7.5% ABV compliments this pairing.  Smells of tropical citrusy hops and has a clean finish, not too hoppy.  Overall taste is crisp and has notes of tropical fruits.  Overall a well balanced and fantastically executed IPA.  While both are world class IPAs I prefer it over Heady Topper, just sayin.","barfootbandit","Feb 06, 2015"

Taste comes remarkably close to the nose as citrus hops are present with hints of caramel  and pineapple.  Not a terribly bitter after taste and is fairly sweet.  A very nice IPA from an outstanding brewery.","RyBrew54","Feb 04, 2015"

The hops are citrusy but smooth and give none of the aggressive bitterness there's a mild malt note in the note as well as though vanilla or caramel.  The nose is amazingly balanced and has a touch of tropical fruit as well.  On the palate the carbonation is smooth, keeping the texture remarkably creamy. Flavors of citrus, pine, orange and a hint of honey drive the profile. There also a subtle spiciness. The balance of the entire experience is what makes this IPA special.  There are elements of malt that keep the hops from overtaking the beer, even on the finish, which has only a small amount of bitterness, but lots of flavor.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 29, 2014"

Initially the citrus (particularly grapefruit) flavors dominate but there is a quick transition to a rich malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and the finish begs for the next sip.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, peach, mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate amount of pine/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 22, 2014"

Spent two weeks getting to know this gem. Pours a dark honey with a half inch creamy head, and great lacing. A big nose of tropical fruit and hops. Taste is plenty of fruit, mango, pineapple, and tangerine, with a great hop presence and a nice bitter finish. A touch of caramel malt balance it out nicely. Not boozy, but full bodied. A truly great IPA that I will look forward to on my next trip to Florida. Room for some in my suitcase home for sure.","RobbDogg","Nov 21, 2014"

Presents with a  citrusy hop blast, with a pervasive and fruity sweetness; there are pine notes, but they are almost too subtle to mention. A refreshing and light mouthfeel, resulting in a session-beer-like drinkability. This is a unique IPA, and one at least in the top ten. I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.","JasW","Sep 28, 2014"

Even today, it is pretty solid. With its balanced flavor profile and lighter mouthfeel, I could definitely imagine myself drinking this all day long on a hot summer day.","Damian","Sep 12, 2014"

Nose has some major hop action.  Earthy, tobacco, grapefruit and a touch of tropical fruits.  Taste has brings big hop flavored to the front.  Grapefruit, tobacco, mango and papaya.  Some caramel and biscuity notes are there but they don't get near balancing the resinous hops.  Bitter on the finish and a nice grapefruit linger.  Medium body and sticky feel on the palate.  Somehow, this finds a way to crud pup and finish slightly dry.  Overall a fantastic IPA with a unique flavor all it's own.","HopBomb515","Sep 06, 2014"

Nice after taste with not too much bitterness. Overall this is a wonderful beer and folks who do not like IPA's will enjoy the beer!","Andyyyyyy","Aug 14, 2014"

Big fruity, tropical nose with lots of resiny hops along with hints of pine, caramel, tangerine and mango. The taste follows suit with mango, pine, and resiny hops up front along with hints of sweet caramel, peach marmalade, and subtle grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation and balance and a nice slightly syrupy, subtly bitter finish. Overall, this is one bold and flavorful IPA with huge drinkability.","beerdrifter","Aug 13, 2014"

Not to be ignored, the scent is reminiscent of a floral, bright IPA, but with subtle notes of something sweet and alluring... I've read ""caramel", but prefer to think it is the aroma of something brewed especially for fairies at play in the land of dreams and sweets and candy.","Jennymonster","Aug 01, 2014"

Refreshing and well balanced hop profile with a clean crisp finish. Does not linger on the tongue and only leaves you wanting to go back for another sip. Even when poured the beer exhibits a beautiful color and wonderful citrus (orange peel) aroma. A great tight head that lingers on the edge of the class tells me that someone has taken their time to get it right.","Brewsnpucks","Jul 30, 2014"

I was lucky enough to live so close to the Cigar City brewery, going to USF's Tampa campus, so I was able to try Jai Alai right from Cigar City's tap. This beer has a very full flavor, with the bitterness from the hops blending smoothly with notes of citrus and tropical fruits. I highly recommend this beer to those who love IPAs as well as those who are skeptical of the style.","jazzer","Jul 03, 2014"

I really looked forward to the tropical fruit aroma and of course citrusy smell / taste go a long way with me in an IPA anyway. maybe it was because this can was 2 months old but it was very hard for me to pick up any significant citrus and tropical fruit notes from start to end. Just sort of there is all. have to have when super fresh to do a proper comparison but I would say just pay attention to the canning / bottling dates when pursuing just like any other IPA.","bowzer4birdie","Jun 19, 2014"

This is a balanced IPA: piny and citrus in hop character and caramel and light malt to finish. If I were stranded on an island (with a refrigerator), and had to choose between Hop Nosh, One Claw, and Jai Alai, I would pick this one. Not only does the name invoke a sense of lazy (or survival-induced intense) afternoons, but the beer backs it up. Jai Alai!","PennFBarts","Jun 16, 2014"

It's definitely malty, so much so that you can smell the caramel coming through along with the tropical fruits of cascade and simcoe hops. There is also is a certain amount of bread-y or toastyness to the malt backbone. Overall good IPA. It used to be my favorite until I drank Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA. I've realized that I'm more of a west coast drinker than east coast over the past couple of months. Follow me on Twitter: miamibrewer305","miamibrewer","Jun 13, 2014"

4.49,4.9,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of an American IPA, it was just dominated by fruity hops and I didn't mind it one bit, sure it wasn't that balanced, but the hop profile was so nice that I didn't really think about it too much. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, fairly refreshing, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, If I had a bunch of these I would have no problem taking out a six pack throughout the day, especially on a warm summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was great and it was really juicy and fruity. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing about this beer that I disliked or would change, it's great just the way it is. I would recommend this to just about everyone, I think it lives up to being called a must try beer. I would for sure buy some if I ever saw it and if I knew it was fresh and I hope Cigar City makes it to Michigan one of theses days. All in all I was impressed with this beer and I was happy that It lived up to the hype, I now see why this beer is sought after, it's just a great beer with good drinkability, it's got a lot of appeal to it. So far this is up there as one of the best American IPA's I've had. This beer made for a great first impression for Cigar City and I would love to try more of their beers. Great job guys, this is one world class IPA, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Jun 11, 2014"

It has a fairly sweet and robust body and is more malt-forward than most, but the tropical flavors and the very green, grassy bitterness provide a nice counterpunch. In the end, everything comes together very nicely, leaving you with a beer that is better than the sum of its parts. There are a lot of IPAs out there, but few as unique as Cigar City Brewing's Jai Alai. Recommended. Cheers!","siege06nd","May 24, 2014"

I thought I might have had a couple of bad bottles or something. Now, hundreds of beers later, I can say with confidence that Jai Alai is not really what I'm looking for in an IPA. It smells great, but it's too sweet and too sticky. All of the wood-aged variants are a notable improvement.","angrybabboon","May 22, 2014"

The biggest defining factor was how the orange-citrus touch to it gave the hops a nice uplifting buzz. It balanced out the piney hops and left a warm lingering aftertaste. This makes Jai Alai the perfect summer drink for an IPA fan. I could imagine making multiple return trips to a cooler to crack one of these open! Great beer.","AlpacaAlpaca","May 20, 2014"

Its a great anytime IPA and has become really popular in South Florida and is almost always available. Nice opaque orange color , great mouthfeel, and tons of citrus hoppy flavor. Is great out of the can but I prefer in a glass to really appreciate the color and aroma of this IPA. Has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. I usually drink IPA's in the 9-10% abv range but this IPA stands up right next to them.","illMurray","May 02, 2014"

Taste follows the smell. Just loads of orange juice. A really great malt backbone too. I gotta say this is one of those beers you gotta drink fresh or else there's no point.

Aroma is sort of hoppy, tropical fruit mostly but its not as robust as I would like. Flavor is very hop heavy,tropical fruits buta strong alcohol component that is quite unpleasant. Very strong astringency. Not sure why Cigar City is so popular I wouldn't drink this again and I plan on giving away my remaining can.

The pour is a somewhat hazy orange copper color with little head but very nice lacing. The aroma is pure hops. Lots of pine and citrus accented by some mango and tropical fruits. The nose makes it hard to believe that this is a single ipa and not a double. The body is medium and a little chewy with lots of hop resin beautifully coating the mouth. The flavor is an awesomely fresh hop bomb with all the notes that the nose promised augmented by just enough malt to balance the beer yet lend it virtually no sweetness. I still feel like the flavor is closer to a dipa than a single. This is a damn good beer and one that I would definitely try if it is in your area.

I got a 6 pack as a present and I was surprised that I had never heard of Cigar City Brewing before (even though I work in a beer shop) When you pour the beer it has a very slightly opaque copper appearance with a fantastic foamy head. You can smell the hops, not overpowering but absolutely there. There are also some hints of a citrus and another smell I can't quite describe except to say it reminds me of fresh baked bread, but it is enticing. It is full bodied, but not to heavy. It found the right spot on the bell curve. The taste starts by hitting the salty and sweet taste buds then the hops hit the bitter receptors. However they made this combination it is amazing! Another great plus is a fantastic aftertaste and not overly carbonated. I would highly advise any IPA fans to try out Cigar City Jai Alai!","Matt_Stuart","Mar 12, 2014"

The suds fall back into the drink, making lacing difficult and sparse, going more for the mosaic look than the ring look. Pine and resin accompany an overwhelming citrus aroma: grapefruit and orange are the heavyweights. There is some biscuit behind it, but you have to look for it especially when it is freshly poured and the carbonation is going well. The biscuit comes out a little more in the flavor, cooked well with some doughy presence, it comes first, then lots of citrus and resin, followed by a strong bitterness, but it isn't overwhelming. The citrus is almost tart and balances the bitterness well. The hop flavors are enough to knock me off my chair, they're so prevalent. The feel is quite dry, the body on the light side. This beer is focused on hops a lot, but there is some maltiness to it as well, balancing it out very nicely. The hop bite is a little harsh in this, so I'd switch to another drink sooner than, say, a Stone IPA or Racer 5, but the flavor is more of an experience so it's a trade off.","Philousa","Mar 07, 2014"

4.03,-5.8,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Obviously I can't see the appearance but it tastes like a 4. Can't get a good smell but likely moderate fragrance with a major hop profile of citrus and flowers to get to another 4. I see a trend. The taste is the first metric that's palpable. Very hop forward with a moderate hop profile but decent smoothness. A little tingle. A dusty grain finish. Drink it if you can but I will likely try from a tap next.","macher0","Mar 07, 2014"

It's got that brutal kick upfront that takes you aback, an orangey/fruity middle, and the bitter follow-through that reminds you what a hell of an IPA it is that you're consuming. Jai Alai is not only a terrific beer, but also a great marquee of the Florida beer scene.","CraigS119","Mar 07, 2014"

On the nose, it smells of a combination of citrus fruits and caramel sweetness. Heavy on the hops though and it comes through on the first sip. Strong fruity flavors; both citrus and tropical. Leaves a nice aftertaste at the end of the sip. Bitterness is on par with all great IPAs. Really enjoyed this one and hope to have again soon!","ChrisL24481","Feb 22, 2014"

The really sweet malt, most noticeably on the front, and the tangy, resin-like bitterness from the hops on the back. Not necessarily balanced as other world-class IPAs, but still very pleasant. I really like how the sweetness comes through right from the start. Overall, this is a really enjoyable brew that I could see myself having a few of. A significant step above the Racer 5s and Hop Devils because of it's malt character and fresh flavor, but not well balanced or diverse to hang with the world class Plinys or Headys. A great beer that I would drink often if I had better access to it.","Zaso","Feb 19, 2014"

I drank one from the can and was very suprised and poured another into a glass and loved the way it looked and tasted. If this becomes a permanent presence in VA, I'll always have some in the fridge. If not, I'll always grab some when I'm down in Florida. It's nice when the rumors are true...","Mdez","Feb 08, 2014"

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The body was orange-amber in color, clear, and gently carbonated; forming a two finger thick head that proved very durable. The first thing hit me as the can was opened was the tropical citrus smell, and it intensified upon pouring. Bringing the glass under the nose revealed a ton of grapefruit, mandarin orange, bitter orange, and a hint of papaya. The taste was very hoppy, revealing layers of grapefruit, pine, hay, and some butterscotch. The finish was spicy and earthy, and the body felt quite sticky. This straddled a line between a regular IPA and a DIPA, and should probably be considered a double. I am so glad I bought two sixpacks, as this would keep me happy for a while.","rajendra82","Feb 07, 2014"

The aroma is an intoxicating burst of citrus hops. I get orange and mango notes. The front of the palate is like biting into a grapefruit. Intensely fresh hop flavor assaults your palate. This is quickly followed by a good malt backbone. That hop fades slowly away and beckons further sips. The mouth is moderately carbonated and the hops definitely prick the tastebuds.","Franziskaner","Feb 05, 2014"

Highly carbonated with the alcohol completely hidden. Medium bodied. Overall impression is this is an ipa with lots of flavor-big on those sticky pine like hops with high carbonation, a sticky lace and a sweet malt bill. Well made ipa. I prefer a more fruity, tropical hop bite with less bitterness but can see why it's so popular.","deebo","Feb 03, 2014"

In a recent trip through New England, I was fortune to pick up a case of the Heady, and thus I am impressed by the pleasant similarity here. Great Beer.","T-34-85","Jan 29, 2014"

I would have liked to go with an inverted Glug, but given that the CAN directs me to ""[p]our gently", I have no choice but to do so. The ex-Old Lady said it drove her nuts to see me employ an inverted Glug, but my response was that unless directed otherwise, that is how I roll. Mission accomplished! I still produced a dense finger of tawny head with decent retention, but great lacing forming as it fell. Color was a slightly-hazy coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17). Nose was citrusy, but not in the usual way for an AIPA. Instead, it was softer and more rounded at the edges, grapefruit and some malt as well as some fruity yeast-driven esters. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste evinced pine, grapefruit, wood (like oak) and even banana! Wild. I CAN imagine what all of the different modifications to this beer must be like. No wonder people are so crazy for this one. Finish was semi-dry thanks to all of the different flavors going on within this beer. It has to rank as a unique AIPA IMHO.","woodychandler","Jan 01, 2014"

The nose has big caramel, malty sweetness upfront with citrusy hops and a touch of biting booze making noise in the background. The taste is a super balance between assertive, citrusy hops and malt sweetness - there are no lingering unpleasantries. I don't remember the mouthfeel being so balanced and juicy when it was pumped through draught lines @ tgif in Orlando... but the beer's sweet, medium body pushes back hard against the potent, grapefruity hops and linger in harmony with utmost drinkability. I'm really impressed by this beer, though I've had it several times, and would definitely drink again.","ThePorterSorter","Dec 14, 2013"

While I know it's going to be citrusy, JA just has this X factor that I'm not experienced enough to put my finger on. Taste is the same way. It's like Cigar City took an amazing IPA and an amazing grapefruit juice and said, ""you will now be one"". Feel is great, carbed well, goes down smooth with the sightest hint of dryness after taste leaving me craving more. Easily one of my all time favorite IPAs, and one that I certainly hope makes its way to Indiana distribution so I don't have to travel/trade to enjoy.","roger617","Dec 06, 2013"

Personally I think the drinking experienced is enhanced a bit by the can design. The retro 70's green and orange screams ""juicy fruit"" and that's exactly what you get. If ya got it, drink it fast. I mistakenly shoved one can to the back of the fridge, and while it was still enjoyable, with a few months on it , Jai Alai is not the same beer.

Unlike most AIPA, this one is not overly bitter and extremely well balanced. the overly sharp hop bitterness that's associated with ipa's is balanced by the malt sweetness. In all honesty, YES i have had heady topper (family lives not far away i have it a lot) YES i have tried Gandhi bot the brewery is down the street. YES i have had pliney the pine bomb elder (i like that about pliney).

Splotchy lacing sticks to the sides with a frothy white head that receded to a thin ring. Dipping my nose into the glass reveals a huge citrus-forward aroma of oranges, grapefruit, and pleasant pine scent. It's nothing that you haven't smelled before in an IPA, just balanced perfectly to make you smile. The flavors mirror the smell with more pine on the finish. Medium-bodied and a little more viscous that I anticipated, but not in a bad way. This is very well-made juice and I hope that one day Cigar City makes it to VA. With this one being my first, I can guarantee it won't be my last. Cheers!","Cubatobaco","Nov 07, 2013"

The alcohol is also hidden exceptionally well (except for realizing you may be a tad tipsy while writing your review).

Wow it is fresh IPA and when you crack open a can during a hot Miami summer afternoon its dammmn good. I have had this stuff from the brewery in Tampa and it's great on tap too. They don't ship bottles of this stuff so if you find it in a bottle you're probably having it old as f##K. Anyways CCB always prints the date on the bottom of the can when it was made. So anything less than a month its gonna be awesome. It still taste good after 90 days but they don't like selling anything past 90 days so CCb is serious about putting a quality product. MUST DRINK.

The citrus doesn't have the same bite that it does fresh. It angers me a but when IPAs fall off that quickly, but this is still s great IPA.","DonFrap","Aug 16, 2013"

Prior to that I was a pretty undiscriminating beer drinker, choosing anything from Bud Light to Heineken to Sam Adams. It was a revelation to find a new type of beer with a really great taste. The thickness and smoothness of this beer combined with the tingling bitterness made an instant impression on me. Now I've taken every opportunity to try different beer varieties and IPAs remain my favorite, with Jai Alai being one of my top five or so.","StrangerTides","Aug 16, 2013"

Fresh tropical aroma of mandarin, mango, pineapple with some biscuity grain.  Juicy tropical flavors of mango, passionfruit, mandarin, and pineapple gush on the palate with biscuity and toasty grain. Nice moderate carbonation allows flavors to meld, finishes somewhat bitter but not overly.  Truly a unique IPA. I haven't had anything like this one before. Definitely gives a Florida feel with all the unique tropical notes. A must try if you get the opportunity.","barnzy78","Jul 21, 2013"

Lots of bready malt coat the palate upfront, with some grapefruit pith, lemon seed and tangerine rind in the mix as well. There's a bit of a peppery, earthy hop note on the finish, and I get some herbal hop resin, mint and white pepper as the finish fades. Still very good and drinkable, but far from the hop bomb that I've been expecting. I'm gonna have to go to Tampa.","notchucknorris","Jul 11, 2013"

Let me start off by saying that it is not as well-balanced, in my opinion, as Bell's Two-Hearted or Longhammer IPA; however, it is amazing for a hyper-hop brew. As others have mentioned, it is distinctively fruity, tasting like grapefruits and passion fruits. The malt is very light without being unnoticeable, and the high alcohol-content is masked by some kind of . . . voodoo sacrifice? It is beautiful, truly. It is not the best . . . but perhaps among the best of the IPA's.","schnauzeborne","Jul 08, 2013"

Bitter mango and pineapple, dank and dirty grapefruit peel, refreshing sweetness in the end. The feel is quality as well with medium body, easy to drink, especially on the beach.

Mine had lots of floaties in it, but from other reviewers comments I guess that's to be expected since it was not kept cold. It was brought to me from Tampa by a friend. As far as I know it didn't adversely affect the taste though (first one, so how could I know). This is not a one dimensional beer as I think is often the case with a lot of IPA. Jai Alai is much more balanced, with a healthy malt presence. It also has a much thicker mouth-feel than your standard IPA. A fantastic brew that I hope returns to Georgia very soon. Floridians should not be allowed to keep this to themselves (blatant jealousy intended).","MonkeyboyATL","Jun 27, 2013"

Appearance and Smell reel you in right away that this is gonna be a damn good IPA than you taste it and BAM hoppy as hell followed by a subtle sweetness only the subtleness of the sweetness becomes less subtle the more you drink. I'm not complaining very very enjoyable just the more you drink the more it morphs into DIPA territory. Damn find beer and I cannot wait until CCB can maintain the demand for its home state and this native Floridian can enjoy his home states best when CCB decides to come back to the ATL.","Jekyll","Jun 09, 2013"

I had this beer many times when I lived in FL and was never too impressed, but revisiting it now for the first time in a year or two and I liked it more than I remembered. Maybe the canning has allowed it to hit distro fresher than before (or maybe I was just drinking unfresh bottles/drafts back them). Either way, not mind blowing, but well above average, and an enjoyable beer that I will certainly drink again.","zac16125","Apr 27, 2013"

I have sat on this for a little while (canned Jan 15 2013) but it still tastes rather fresh. The appearance may have suffered, but I can't be sure whether this is due to sitting in the fridge or not. It's a nice golden amber color, but has a lot of unpleasant looking sediment... and I mean worse than Heady Topper. Anyway, not a big deal at all though. The lacing is fantastic from the bubbly white head. Good amount of carbonation. The aroma is fruity, tangy, and juicy. When drank, the taste is no let down compared to the very pleasing aroma... although it is more bitter than the smell suggests. Sharp and resinous. The fade lingers for the finish, and is medium to full bodied... excellent. Overall, this IPA is up there with the best of 'em!","Neorebel","Apr 13, 2013"

4.23,-1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours a ruddy copper orange color with a nice rocky head of smaller bubbles. The head leaves behind a lovely sticky sheet of lacing that forms a ring with some nice stalactites running from it. In the body, the beer is very clean and light, and completely clear of particles. On the nose, the beer smells of tropical pine trees with a touch of mango citrus. The beer smells even better from the can, where the citrus is amped up into pineapple range while the pine amplifies as well into dank resinous hops. The hops are big but not overpowering, and really quite inviting. The malt base behind it is warm and bready with a terrific yet subtle rye spice. On the tongue, the beer tastes bittersweet with a nice warming heat from the spice flavor. The flavors begin as bready spice, which builds into bitter pine and grapefruit flavors with a touch of pineapple. The finish is strong with bitters which move towards medicinal in flavor with a nice little hiccup of spice to close out the finish. The aftertaste also tingles with spice and bitter pine. This is not an in-your-face IPA flavor, and certainly not a big double IPA, but it is delicious and still fills my bitter-thirst. The nuances between the hops and the generic spice flavor continue to unfold different flavors on the tongue, and really make this beer fun to drink. In the can, this beer’s fruit flavors are intensified and made crisper while the spice is diminished. I get a lot of juicy pine and orange citrus hops with a touch of cool mint at the back of the throat. On the mouth, the beer feels medium creamy in carbonation with just a touch of tingle. The beer’s body feels medium light on the tongue, and the mouth is left properly dry and a touch sticky. Alcohol is present only as a soft tingle in the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a damn fine IPA that stands out by being different. I love the spice and I love the mixture of the hops with the spice. This is a terrific in-the-can beer, and this is a terrific out of the can beer. It is my first taste of Cigar City, and I have to say that I’ve enjoyed it, they pack a hell of a lot of flavor into it, and they hide the alcohol brilliantly. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Apr 02, 2013"

Nose is nicely enticing with some candied fruits, fresh fruits, and an herbal/grassy presence. On the palate there's a big juicy fruit hop quality right away with plenty of tartness, some decent malt balance, and a very good body. Savory, rewarding, and drinkable.

You can smell the tropical aromas jump out at you as you begin to take a sip. Smells of grapefruit and pineapple jump at you. The initial citrus flavors invade your pallet with a crisp hoppy finish towards the end.

I'm getting a ton of citrus, pineapple, mango and slight canned peachy goodness! Taste is right there with the nose, this is a perfect beach beer after a long day of surfing.

Still enjoying this immensely, but this could be close to perfect with more hops to lend to the aroma and flavor. I compare this to Lagunitas Sucks - both have impressive malt backgrounds and similar ABVs and mouthfeels, but Sucks is just better hopped. Again, still really enjoyed this, just not in my top 5.","MCain04","Mar 06, 2013"

I've had a couple of others, and I'd rank this one above them. It's light feeling, fresh, and the smell and taste stay throughout the entire process. When I'm in the mood to revisit, this one will definitely be on my mind.","JackMcAwesome","Mar 06, 2013"

Overall, I really like this beer because it is a breath of fresh air in the craft beer scene where IPAs tend to try to ""out-hop"" each other. I can imagine sitting back and rolling through a sixer of these on a beautfiul spring afternoon. This is my kind of beer.","Jake_Ramrod","Mar 05, 2013"

I could not have asked for a better sixpack for cold weather drinking on the Furthur lot this weekend. truly one of the few beers that lives up to the hype, this is a gem.","StonedTrippin","Feb 24, 2013"

I have to say that I don't love them all but Jai Alai Is my kind of IPA. The color is very golden and pure. The aroma is a terrific citrus smell with the familiar pine presence as well. The taste follows the nose with a up front citrus presence followed by the hops to back it up. Just the right amount of hops without getting out of control but enough to keep the hop heads happy. Excellent balance with the 7% abv completely hidden and all you can think about is popping another beer. Overall this is an excellent IPA and is now part of my regular rotation. I only wish it were a little less expensive.","ELS","Feb 23, 2013"

Maybe it's the fact that people down in Florida don't have many good craft breweries to choose from, but I think this beer is a bit overrated. After having this for the first time it wasn't one of those beers that I had to tell my friends about or something that I would seek out to share with a fellow beer geek. When I think of the single IPA's that made me want to share them with everybody I know (Alpine Nelson, Fat Head, Kern River Just Outstanding) it just doesn't fall into that same category...it's somewhere in the second tier. It's a good IPA, but there are tons of good IPA's out there...so don't go out of your way to find this, but definitely try it if it's readily available to you.","Dirte1096","Feb 22, 2013"

While i am writing this i already know how i want to score this but the ""bros"" 100 for this beer is amazing to me. As far as i know they havent given us sixes to rate with. This beer is nowhere near heady, pliny, anything by alpine, sucks, columbus ipa and the list goes on. Really, if 100 is perfection its unfair to rate this beer that high but it is a good beer; but i digress. The nose brings caramel malts, lime rind and honestly not much else this is very malt forward and struggle to find any tropical qualities to this beer (i love cigar city and have many of their beers i am just struggling to see why this is rated so high). Mouth brings a slightly herbal twinge, cat piss and some light shades of citrus - beginning to think my less than a month old can is past its prime (this is the second one i opened and both are consistent).

Drinkability was good, but as a penalty for not reading the can first, my last pour came with a huge amount of floaty yeast chunks. Ooopsie. Overall, a very nice take on the style, if this were local to me, it would be in my regular rotation for sure. A must try if you see it, and probably worth trading for to try.","beertunes","Jan 22, 2013"

The foam left lacing on the glass, demonstrating some retention. The nose was a big citrus hop aroma, an array of citrus fruit were present. In the initial taste one detects notes of ginger, grapefruit, papaya, guava, and a certain degree of earthiness. After the initial pour, the carbonation mellowed pretty quickly. This allowed the fruit to linger nicely on the tongue, giving the impression of citrus fruit skin. In the aftertaste, one detects grapefruit and pineapple continuing. A mild warming sensation lingers on the back of the throat. A very well produced American IPA with a diverse palate.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 20, 2013"

Flavor follows suit but the citric is more upfront and is both juicy and sweet and some tropical fruits are also there. A touch of bitterness in the finish. A medium to light body, nice activity. Overall, this is a great IPA and right up there with Odell's IPA, Bell's Two Hearted, Brew Kettle's White Rajah for favorites of this style.","denver10","Jan 09, 2013"

My only real complaint is with the head, which could be thicker, chewier, and lacier, but that’s just me. This is a top-tier American IPA in my opinion, and certainly for the price it’s hard to beat.

Flavor follows with beautifully tropical citrus notes, and a nice hit of bitter pine on the back end. Supported by plenty of malts, and no hint of the abv here. Light and airy, high carbonation, slick, and beautiful. Awesome beer to have regularly.","BMMillsy","Oct 02, 2012"

Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight yeast, hint of dough, slight floral, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. The mouth feel is great for a strong IPA. The hops are bold, but there is enough malt and citrus to balance the flavor and not let the hops become overpowering.

Smell is rich in malt and hops alike, with gobs of caramel weighing down a piney citric hoppiness. Flavor is along the lines of your typical ’balanced’ IPA, plenty of crystal and caramel malt notes with a complementary hop profile instead of a showcase. Nice big bitterness in the finish, with a chewy mouthfeel that dries out well. A perfectly adequate IPA but I’m left wanting more hops.","illidurit","Jan 31, 2012"
4.33,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy deep Orange/copper with amber hues and an off-white head. Huge aroma of pine and citrus hops with some sweet malt and caramel. Taste is a citrus hop bomb that has a hint of tropical fruit with a touch of pine and grassy hops coming through in the finish with a touch of sweet malt and caramel. Medium mouth feel with a moderate to strong amount of bitternees and well hidden alcohol. Freakin delicious. This reminds me more of a Double IPA, full flavor.","beergod1","Jan 30, 2012"

There were a few little metallic notes that crept in here and there - I think that this would be more pronounced if you were sipping slowly, writing a review for some website. Bottle was shipped from Florida, so that may have affected it. All in all, quite glad I got to try this. Definitely recommended!","olfolxholme","Jan 17, 2012"
4.25,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"OVERALL: This is really, really good. One of the better IPAs out there, and it throws a lot of flavor at you while keeping the ABV to a modest 7.5%. Could have the flavor profile of a double IPA in that regard. Another quality brew for Cigar City, this is definitely one I could drink regularly. Recommended.","Jeffo","Jan 17, 2012"

The taste is slightly sweet caramel with tons of orange and decent pine. Tropical fruits are also coming through as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is perfect for the style.

4.08,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: I gotta say, this reminds me a lot of Three Floyd’s IPAs: Alpha King especially. It’s mostly about that peppery hop bitterness, which isn’t my favorite hop taste; however, they pull off these bitters quite well (seriously, this is legendary balance). I really can’t think of a better dinner beer for Mexican food, seeing as it’s hoppy, but not too hoppy to make spicy food unbearably intense. At this rate, I’ll be loving their White Oak version – and, thanks again to Chris, I have one in my fridge at this very moment! Great…a bit of woody complexity would do wonders for this palate.","BarryMFBurton","Oct 23, 2011"

I'm already looking forward to the next time I have an opportunity to have some of this beer.","QuantumPint","Oct 22, 2011"
3.92,-8.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"About a finger’s worth of off-white foam, not especially frothy and the retention is average at best, the lacing comes in solid sheets but little stickiness. Murky orange-amber in color with more of a brown than red cast, solid glow throughout, not too many bubbles visible. Sweetly hoppy nose of pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, pineapple, nectarine, apple fruit and flowers, does show a piney resinous to cut grass and herbaceous side, peppery too, powerful lift and staying power. Full-bodied and close to thick, coats the palate and heavy on the tongue. The carbonation has more fluff than prickle but not that strong in either sense. Dry on the whole, the orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus dominant yet without sweetness. More biscuit, bread here with a touch of honey. The florality very pretty and spreads through the finish. More bite than juice in the peach, apricot, nectarine fruit, falls short of tropical. Very consistent presentation and very good balance, perhaps not that complex but easy to enjoy and doesn’t unnecessarily seek to push the envelope.","farrago","Oct 22, 2011"

4.05,-5.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"One is greeted by a hazy orange/copper body resting beneath a voluptuous white head that dissipates a little too quickly, but leaves ample sticky lacing in its place. Smells of piney hops, flowers, rich citrus, and some faint dark fruits in front of an even fainter malt background. Taste begins with a hop assault but quickly mellows into a smooth caramel flavor rounded out by loads of citrus (grapefruit, orange, and lots of lemon). A oaky, wood flavor also makes itself known throughout the drink. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, and finishes very well.

Frothy white head slowly dissipates to a cap and leaves moderate lacing in its wake. Smells yeasty, earthy and citrusy, pine and resin mixed with a fair amount of caramel. Taste is sweet caramel malt up front followed by an earthy piney resinous taste. Hints of citrus follow then a fairly dry finish that leaves a bitter hop bite on the palette. Medium body and carbonation level with a resinous bitter mouthfeel. I liked this one, but nothing about it knocked my socks off. I really wanted more hops in here. I got this bottle in trade and with no bottle dating I have no idea how fresh this sample is. Maybe one day I will get to try a version at the source.","johnnnniee","Aug 19, 2011"

In fact, I drank through 2 six packs before reviewing one, because for me it was hard to nail down the flavors here, as they were changeable and fleeting, but oh so tasty. A nice pour, orange amber with a head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. Very citrusy with a nice bitterness throughout, but it's hard to place the particular citrus flavors and aromas. A bit of orange, grapefruit, and tangerine, and some carambola comes through for me as well. A veritable fruit salad here. There is a touch of woodiness and a little bit of a sour zing, but it all seems to belong. The malt is very well integrated and merely provides a sweet counterpoint to the fruit notes. Very smooth, and not chewy at all. At the finish there are some additional light notes of coconut that help add a little creaminess to the bitter undercurrent and fruity topnotes. A very nice package indeed- a great IPA/","Georgiabeer","Aug 16, 2011"

Malt base is maybe a tad too sweet for my taste though very solid with no watery notes. Boyd is full with limited filtration and great carbonation.

Herbal and floral notes develop through the middle. Finishes with a very pleasant grapefruit bitterness that lingers for a while in the aftertaste. Very unique- would be immediately recognizable.

Getting a lot of yeasty malt and caramel sweetness in the nose. Sweet forward with the hops coming through in the middle. A bit bubble gummy in the middle, with something strangely like a Belgian character just before the hops rush in toward a dry, bitter finish. Good carbonation and a slightly resiny, drinkable mouthfeel. I realize now that I've been drinking much more hop forward beers lately and this is more complex and a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice to know this is from my neck of the woods. Good.","jgurley","Jul 23, 2011"

I love the places that this beer is going, especially with light bodied (but still carbonated) IPA. This is getting all the flavor I need in an IPA, with some interesting contrast -- PLUS a refreshing drinking experience.

Apricots and sweet grapefruit come to mind along with caramel and malty notes. There is a nice hop bitterness up front with caramel malt taste in the middle that almost reminds me of a marzen (crazy). It ends with some tropical fruit and earthy tones with tobacco and pine at the very end. Tobacco lingers on my palate for a good while after the last sip of this beer. Perfect balance in my opinion and the fact I can't buy this in my state makes it taste even better. This is a great beer to add to any ipa lovers lineup.","tetu","Jul 15, 2011"

There is quite a bit of flavor going on here, and the body is medium-heavy.

I get big simcoe and pretty big, sweet malt. The taste is big, sugar malt balancing a nice hop flavor. There is a definite simcoe presence (which I firmly believe makes an ipa taste horrible when old), but this beer is evidently fresh. More sweet than hoppy, this really drinks like a lower ABV DIPA. There is a touch of piney-hop flavor that I think brings this beer around and elevates it from an average IPA. Mouthfeel is sugary and thick (for the style) hanging on the tongue. Overall, I actually really enjoy this beer, but when I break it down it sounds less positive than it is. This is a good one and really nice to try next to the cigar box one (5 nose!) and the white oak one. In fact, this beer comes off like it was designed to be put in barrels.

Taste is sweet resin from the start; caramel malt is more pronounced here, and the pineapple flavor of the citrus hops really stands out. Nice bitter aftertaste from the hops balances things out. Thin, smooth body with medium to high carbonation. Overall, a solid sessionable IPA.","CuriousMonk","May 19, 2011"

A very nicely done American IPA - emphasis on fruity/citrus hops, with a well-moderated bittering throughout and a clean, hoppy finish. A touch of sweetness toward the end is pleasant.

The nose is sweet biscuity malt and citrus. Taste is orange and mango hoppiness backed up by a very nice pale malt backbone. There is a pleasant bitterness that is well balanced by the malt making this an easy drinking and refreshing IPA. Not over the top bitter like many IPAs that I enjoy immensely, but a very solid take on the style and one I'd have again if it was local. Recommended.","Sideswipe","May 15, 2011"

The head retention here was particularly unique I found, as this creamy 'mocha'-style head remained, and almost looked like a batter because of how thick and dense it was. Nose has lots of tropical notes, pineapple and mango come to mind initially. Sweet, with some light caramel as well. Taste has more orange and mango, with a nice malt profile to support it. Malt base adds to a great full mouthfeel and a moderate bitterness that's almost fruity in nature; juicy and real tropical fruitiness to be found throughout. Medium to full mouthfeel, a solid but not substantial bitterness and fantastic drinkability for the alcohol. Thank God for the rest of this 6 pack.","liamt07","May 13, 2011"

Excellent example of the style. Poured a beatiful coppery/golden hue with great foamy head and retention to the last sip. Aroma gave me chills, as I felt as though I'd been dropped in a pine thicket, or grapefruit grove. Taste is earthy, piney, citrusy, with just a hint of malt sweetness to balance it out.

This brew pours a deep copper with a medium head of bone color. Lacing is top notch, excellent. Smell is enticing, to say the least, with great attributes being sweet, fruity, spicy HOPPINESS! The taste is clean and fresh with huge floral hoppy notes. Its bitter but the best kind of bitter. I liken it to wasabi(the heat is intense but leaves quick without a trace). Doesn't linger around on the palate like some other well known IPAs. Feel is incredibly smooth, refreshing with a perfect light carbonation. I can't say enough about this beer, easily the best IPA I've had to date. Highly recommended to anyone who likes hops and even those who don't.","RashyGrillCook","May 02, 2011"

I'm fortunately missing a lot of the sweetness that a lot of people have noted. Mild caramel backbone with big citrus and piney hops in the forefront. The taste has a bit more of a sweet presence than in the aroma. The hop profile is the same combo of citrus and pine.

Incredibly refreshing citrus/grapefruit hop character with a little bit of pine; perfect bitterness. The hops are perfectly balanced with the malt flavors; it avoids pushing over in the hop bomb type of brew.

3.72,-13.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,3,"D: Understanding the many varietal beers of Cigar City Brewing involves getting to know the base beers--this being one--that do the heavy lifting in many of the recipes. Jai Alai IPA is an aggressive example of the style, and its standing somewhere between the typical IPA and DIPA is surely by design. Sweetness is cloying early and wherever sweetness appears, so does astringency. This beer is cleanest and most enjoyable in the middle, where some dryness is allowed in while astringency takes a back seat. It reminds the drinker of its immensity and importance with every sip, but it also has the palate-fatiguing potential of a strong ale. While it may not be the best choice for an approachable, everyday IPA, it does suggest at Cigar City's ability to one day brew a big and impressive APA.","beagle75","Apr 02, 2011"

More earthy, spicy hops notes and caramel sweetness as it warmed. Nice balance for an IPA, plenty of hop flavour (still very citrusy, but with more pine than the aroma) and sturdy bitterness tempered by caramel/crackery malt.

Cigar City's website mentions nothing, and neither does BA. However, I certainly can detect subtle hints of what can be described as woody and oaky characteristics in this brew. If it isn't oak, then either my palate is off and/or these hops are more complex then I give them credit for. Either way, I really enjoyed this beer and wish it were available in Chicago.

This is a solid IPA.","washburnkid","Mar 05, 2011"

That's usually rigged, but how do you rig a bottle of brew? it is good or it isn't. On that note, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew has a nice citrus hop note with some arid maltiness. On the pour its a slightly cloudy yellow with a big beige head On the taste this brew is big citrus , starting with a tinge of grapefruit, moving quickly into orange then very quickly into banana then finishes big into a high test licorice . The AC stands out big on the finish but it is very smooth. This is almost like a reverse shot with a chaser, or a pain in the ass with a 151 floater. Extremely unique. Mouthfeel is like silk. I'm drinking this brew at about 62 degrees in a 68 degree climate. Incredible! I see what all the rage is.","mooseisloose","Mar 04, 2011"

Something else coming through, can't put my finger on it. Very resiny, oily, citrus component comes through as a sour bitter grapefruit. Has a touch of sweetness at the end.

Tropical and pine hops dominate, also a bit of floral hops, bready malt and alcohol present in the nose. Taste is what you'd expect from the nose. Big citrus hops, a little sweetness from the tropical fruits mix well with bittering pine hops. A little bready malt sweetness on the back end. Pine hops linger a bit into the aftertaste.","uustal","Feb 14, 2011"

Hints of hoppy pineyness coupled with citrus and slight orange flavors mingle nicely with caramel malt and a very minimal alcohol flavor(extremely well balanced for its 7.5 ABV profile). Lasting head about 2.5 fingers leaving significant lacing on a pint glass. Very drinkable IPA, can't wait to try more of their offerings.","eloudy","Feb 12, 2011"

This beer was a tad foamy out of the bottle, but once i let the gas escape it settled down and poured a nice finger of ecru foam on an amber body. It's much darker than most IPAs that are out there. The smell of this beer is pretty good mostly there is some pale and caramel malts backed up by a strong lemon scent. The flavor of this beer has much of the bittering hops in it, but the flavoring hops seem to not be as present, if they were ever there. There is a deal of barley husk/toasted malt and toffee to go with the minor citrus flavor and there is a distinct bitterness to this beer that might even be off putting to some not acclimated to the style. This is still a good beer to drink though perhaps a tad aggressive on the carbonation.","Vdubb86","Feb 09, 2011"

This is a thoroughly enjoyable IPA and the perfect night cap after driving a total of 3 hours on the road and spending 12 hours helping brew a double batch of beer on the CCB pilot system; I am so happily satisfied right now.","Gueuzedude","Jan 31, 2011"

4.5,5.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This ale puts its foot on the border of IPA and Impy IPA, a blurring of the lines. Clear copper hue, impressive lacing but coming from a highly hopped beer ... not a surprise. Big hop stink, heavy citric of ruby red grapefruit and tangerines ... faintly catty with some taffy undertones. Hops smack down hard, though some caramel and biscuity flavors from the malt appear; aside from that, it is a full-on palate bashing of citric, earthy pine, tobacco and wild herbs with a tropical fruitiness to compliment. Seriously epic beer, we can only hope a pint of it is waiting for us at the gates of hop heaven.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 21, 2011"

Everything that I like in a barleywine only at a lower level. This is a great IPA. Medium bodied and light to medium carbonation levels make this very drinkable.

The taste is good as well. It has a nice bitter hop punch up front along with a well balanced malt profile. It's an east coast IPA with west coast hops. The mouthfeel is fine.

Sweet pineapple surfaces briefly in each sip, cutting through the bitterness, and addind considerable more interest to the profile.

2.86,-33.2,4,3,2.5,4,2.5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a dark amber peach with a massive 3 inch head that leaves some seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. It's like the lacing creates curtains all the way down the sides of the glass. That's some serious lacing. The aroma is, well, hoppy. There is a slight bit of tropical fruit a bit of pine and just a hint of flowers but nothing to distinctive. More then anything, it just smells medicinally bitter. Almost like hops dusted with aspirin. The flavor is big hops, but once again rather nondescript and still there is that medicinal aspect to it. Citrus hops show bits of tangerine and a little lemon peal. Slight bit of pine, a little caramel and pale malts. Big medicinal bitterness. It really is a bit off putting. I think it kind of drowns out pretty much everything else. The mouthfeel is light with a crisp carbonation. It finished nice and dry, just like I want it to, but unfortunately that medicinal bitterness is just overpowering. Man, I understand there are people who really like that flavor but for me, its just to overpowering.","hwwty4","Sep 27, 2010"

Aroma of sweet malts, bready yeast and grassy, earthy hops with hints of pineapple. This was brewed about a month ago and the hops have taken a back seat a bit but that just leads to a nice balance overall.

4,-6.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a COAST imperial pint. Poured a hazy red-yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to minimal quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, sweet hops, citrus, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of intense malt upfront that subsided to allow a subtle hop character to come through that intensified as it sat on the palate, and was ended off with a sweet citrus note upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice and smooth IPA. As stated by Jeff (PDXHops) there was no date on the bottle that I could find to confirm freshness. The hop character of this brew was definitely present, but it was not the star of the show. This was a very nicely balanced IPA however that was quite enjoy to drink with dinner. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity.

4.18,-2.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This was one of the first CCB beers I really enjoyed. Fairly unique for an AIPA, occasionally reminding me of the chewy bread and caramel malt forward body of an aged Imperial Amber except with fresh citrus hops. Color is a darker and cloudier rust amber with a dark cream colored head that never fades away and leaves ample streaks and webs of lacing. Aroma and flavor are both fairly sweet with strong caramel malt backbone and a resiny citrus hop bite. Body is lighter side of medium with moderate carbonation, thin for the style, but works very well with the strong sweetness in the flavor. Not my favorite IPA, but recommended for not just being another face in the crowd.","yourefragile","Sep 01, 2010"
4.33,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"This was an interesting IPA. It mores much cloudier and darker than other IPA's. The color was a golden mahogany with a small off-white head. The remnants of this head stayed throughout the entirety of the glass. Smells really sweet with nuttiness and rich bread. The hops are definitely there, but in a somewhat subdued citrus note. Really fruity with the hops once it hits your mouth. Tastes range from grapefruit to lemon in this department. Then the sweetness hits. You really get a full dose of bready caramel malts on the back-end of this. This is probably the thickest IPA I've had. It really drinks much bigger than a typical IPA...more so than even some DIPA's I've encountered. I really like this beer. It's certainly big for the style, but quite good nonetheless.","alkemy","Aug 31, 2010"

The aroma is sweet orange and grapefruit with pine undercurrents. Very solid. The flavor offers strong grapefruit sweetness and grain malt goodness. Considering the ABV, this is very drinkable. It's got a rye touch that bleeds into wheat and citrus. It's medium bodied with a moderately crisp carbonation feel. It's almost syrupy but not quite, with plenty of citrus sweetness with slightly syrupy breadiness. Plenty drinkable for the ABV. Quite a memorable IPA with very good drinkability! Nice.","Durge","Aug 07, 2010"
4.15,-3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a darker hue than most other IPAs, bordering on a rich, honeyed gold, with plentiful pinpoint bubbles coalescing up to a fluffy, creamy head. Smells sharply herbal without much tropical fruit or citrus. Seems to follow the 'house hop' character of many of Cigar's brews. Note this is in no way a bad thing, but I have noticed a similar hop profile to many of their beers. There seems to be almost a hint of eucalyptus in the aroma. The flavor coincides with the nose and offers up a robust hop profile that leans heavily on the piney, earthy, herbal side as opposed to grapefruity, citrusy, fruity character of say, Lagunitas or Two Hearted. Different and no less delicious. There is also a well measured malt character lending balancing substance without over-stepping to sweetness. A long, lingering, drying bitterness wraps up the package nicely. A tasty surprise on my trip in the south. Cheers.","cthulu81","Aug 06, 2010"

Tasted like a standard west coast IPA; undistinguishable if you ask me. Average mouthfeel, amber color, carbonation, bitterness, underwhelming aroma, and not enough sweetness to balance it.

3.93,-8.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Served up a slightly hazy orange amber with a very whipped looking slightly off-white head that leaves decent lace. The aroma is much less hop-centric than many of the IPAs I have had recently. The hop character in the nose is quite nice, with notes of candied orange, mango and peach. There is also a very strong caramel malt presence and plenty of sweetness in the aroma. One sip and I can tell this is not a west coast style IPA. It is hard to say this is balanced, because even when compared to Midwest and East Coast versions, it would appear quite malty. Flavors include orange, grapefruit, apricot, spice, brown sugar toast, and toffee. It also carries a decent amount of alcoholic kick that would seem more in place if it were a double. As I sip this it is like the malt and hops battle for supremacy, each trying to shine. This not necessarily a bad thing. The mouthfeel however, is free from all criticism in that it is smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and an amazing finish that is neither drying nor cloying. The aftertaste is also a great aspect of this beer, in that it really brings out some of the hop flavors that the malty body obscures. As far as drinkability, this is not the best IPA I have had in that department, but it does go down fairly well, especially for being closer to a double in power. This is a very good beer, but it is not necessarily the type of IPA I would most want to spend an evening with.","zoso1967","Jul 25, 2010"

And I mean that in a good way. From the hazy maltiness below, a gator of ruby grapefruit snaps at my nose, joined by some piney snappers, who dredge up some water lilies as they jump; I enjoy the florality, but the soup in the boat just leaves me with wet clothes. At least my cooler's still safe. Just for the sake of vengeance, I dive in bedecked in a fully-working model of my own tongue. (I used to shop at Sharper Image...a lot...) Once fully immersed, it's immediately evident from my instruments that more tasty creatures lurk beneath the surface: Schools of caramel and toffee glide lazily about; more snappers dart to and fro, some taking daring little bites at Y.H.N.; and that original grapefruity gator's got himself some comp'ny, a tangello- and and orange-zest-resembling set o' luggage. Clearly intimidated by my lingual armour (it's British), these aquatic beasts pose no threat, but rather swim about for my amusement. All animals bow to man!! Back in the boat and back in my civvies, I find I don't need to wring all that much sludge from my suit. Instead, the murk's moderate body (listen to me, making it sound like a beer or something!), refreshingly dry finish, and what I assume to be natural and normal carbonation (hey, I've never been in a friggin' swamp before) coat only slightly before lithely gliding right off.

Bitter herbal hops dominate as by palate slowly recovers into the full bodied malt that really takes up the back half of this flavor profile. The sweeter hop flavors, grapefruit etc., come across mildly and still in a very bitter way. Overall this is a very well made IPA with a big bold flavor for something that's not a DIPA, but at the same time it never even comes close to being a DIPA.

There is also a fresh grassy flavor as well. The hop profile is supported by a fairly sweet malt, perhaps with some brown sugar notes. The body is light to moderate with tingly carbonation, not that strong, has some nice balance but does finish with a hoppy bitterness. Another very good cigar city brew.

A nice clean crisp medium body with some bitterness in the end. The alcohol peeks through just a bit and the finish has some mango slices.

2.38,-44.4,3,2.5,2,2,3,"Wow. Am i surprised by all the positive feedback on this beer. I found it to be worse than unmemorable. The flavor was too strong for a standard ipa, very alcohol tasting and not enough sweetness or bitterness to balance it. Aroma was nothing special and the mouthfeel was average. Color is a typical amber. There's not much I can say about this beer.","david18","Sep 26, 2009"
4.72,10.3,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Golden Copper in color, nice head reduced to bumpy cratered cap. Nice aromas of dark citrus fruits dancing with nice sweet malt. Taste follows aromas, hop forward taste with balanced caramel and toffee support. Mouthfeel is a medium+ body supported by medium level carbonation.","unclejimbay","Sep 25, 2009"
4.71,10,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Floridians should be very proud to have a brewery like Cigar City and I'm very happy that my buddy NutBrown was able to send me this wonderful tap offering from the great state of New York. This is an amazing brew!","Bitterbill","Sep 24, 2009"
3.88,-9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"All in all, a very solid effort from these Tampa guys. Lots of hype for the new kids on the block, with a darn good IPA. I give them credit for crafting an IPA different than most you would find brewed in the Southeast.","RustyDiamond","Sep 23, 2009"
4.12,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Well balanced and, if anything, a bit on the malty side despite the big hop aroma. Very drinkable, this combines a great hop character with rich, thick malt and almost comes across as an east coast DIPA like DFH 90min.","nickfl","Sep 18, 2009"

3.43,-19.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Had this one a couple of times thanks to mfielden; thanks Mark. Dark amber color with a thick white head that retains well. Toasted grain and caramel aroma. Moderately hoppy nose, but leaning toward the malty side; the hops have a resiny, citrusy character with a touch of tropical fruit. The taste is decidedly East Coast, very balanced between caramel malts and citrusy hops, with malts taking precedence slightly. Mango and grapefruit hop flavors appear mid-palate, but never truly shine due to the heavy malt backbone. Bittersweet in the finish. Solid stuff, but not my favorite take on the style.","largadeer","Jun 23, 2009"

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D and overall impression: Huge marks on drinkability here. 7.5% ABV can get dangerous, but this is sessionable. I really like this beer. I little heavier than most IPA's but the taste is soooo refreshing. I can't wait to review the ceadr and flora versions of this one. Kudos to Wanye and Joey for crafting a very fine beer.

4.6,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Another beer I had on tap a few times in Tampa, even had notes, but am having to finish this growler off before its no good. Previous tastes made me feel very strongly about this IPA. Pours a burnt orange color with a solid 1 1/2 finger head. Nice sticky lacing left on the glass after a few sips. A real pleasant floral hop aroma, some nice pine and a little less bitter grapefruit citrus hints too. A solid bitterness in the taste, much more pine based than the hop aroma would lead one to believe. Well balanced though. I am normally more of a fan of the stronger citrus hop taste, but this pine works very well. Fair carbonization helps lighten up this rather strong & dense IPA. A very smooth drinker, easily a sessionable IPA for me. Obviously freshness of hops is key to IPAs, and this growler was poured at the brewery a few days ago, but wow, I wish we had this locally, I'd buy it all the time.","bhalter8","Jun 04, 2009"
4,-6.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy golden orange with a two-finger head that dies quickly but leaves some lace. A heavier than usual smell of citric and floral hops; hints of grape and heavier fruits. Medium-bodied and smooth, but great hop presence w/ both the citric fruit flavors as well as a great dry backbite. Decent malts tucked in as well, but what surprised me was the higher-than-usual ABV. They really hide it here and it creeps in a little on the end, but I give Kudos. Glad I saw it on bottle or else I'd think this was a session IPA and get a little crushed.","clayrock81","May 23, 2009"
3.88,-9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Many thanks to Gillard for sending me some stuff from this brewery, which I have been looking forward to trying for quite some time. This came in a large swing top bottle. Color is a dark orange, close to copper, with a sizable white head. Hints of pine and grapefruit in the smell; which never become too heavy. Resiny hops that taste like a combination grapefruit and tree sap are balanced out by a larger than expected malt presence. Despite the somewhat high alcohol level, this has been a session beer for me; at least for tonight. Jai Alai is a really respectable IPA from Cigar City. It reminds me somewhat of Victory's HopDevil IPA, which is also a really great, balanced version of the style. I look forward to seeing what else this brewery has under their belt in the future. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 18, 2009"
4.25,-0.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Had this on tap at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours hazy orange with a nice creamy head, definite carbonation (bordering on more than I would like). Upfront hops, slight citrus and a nice pine scent. Decent hop bite with a good malt backing, very balanced. Drinkability is high. Perfect for a summer afternoon, and I will definitely be on the look out for more of it. Looking forward to an increase in distribution as the popularity of Cigar City increases in the Bay Area.","sls0210","May 15, 2009"
4.56,6.5,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,5," Okay, now that i know it's 7.50%, it is right at what i expected. A strong IPA that could have been classified as an Impy IPA. Very Very fresh. The freshest IPA i have ever had. Thank you, Cigar City.","JAA","May 12, 2009"
4.67,9.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to the waiter at Mr Dunderbak's in Tampa for recommending this wonderful beer. In a pint glass the beer was a slightly hazy cherry amber color. It had a medium-sized white head and some specks of lacing. Very nice floral and citrus aroma. Hops came through well in the taste, mostly grapefruit, but also a bit of pine. Very well-balanced with malt. This is a well-brewed beer. Wish I could get it here in Maine.","lordofthewiens","May 06, 2009"
4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Great usage of hops, and although that is to be expected for an IPA, the brewers at Cigar City really knew what they were doing with this beer. Lots of piny, leafy, fresh hops in the mix, balanced by a solid backbone of caramel and biscuit. Lingering hoppiness rounds out a medium body with a good carbonation level. Jai Ali drinks nicely, and measures up to many of the other top-notch IPA's out there. Would gladly have again.","wagenvolks","May 03, 2009"
4.26,-0.5,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to markwise for the 32oz growler. My first taste from the CCB and I must say I'm hooked! Dark hazy amber pour with a thick off white head and spotty lace. Color is a little too dark for an IPA. Caramel and citrus on the nose. Nice resinous body & great balance. Earthy resinous hops with a twist caramel malts. Long bitter finish.","ucusty","May 01, 2009"
4.47,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Vine and Barley in Port St. Lucie. Pours a nice orange tan color with a bit of head, leaves a ton of lac eon the glass. Smell is of citrus and outdoor freshness. Taste is where this is at, leaves pine, orange, tangerine the flavor is all there with a nice overall bitter aftertaste. This is an amazing IPA and it grealy exceeded what I was thinking it was going to taste like. Finally we get an amazing Florida IPA.","gunnerman","Apr 25, 2009"

The aroma is loaded with lots of pine and citric hops and some malt as well. The taste picks up right where the aroma left off with a big dose of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA that is highly recommended! Well done Cigar City!","cjgator3","Apr 11, 2009"
