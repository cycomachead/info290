"Malty more than floral. Slightly boozy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most complex nose of any IPA I've ever had. This beer is boozy almost like a double, and has an overwhelming amount of floral, pine and citrus hops. A must try for any hophead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Long finish."

"Nice ipa with an interesting reddish hue when poured."

"pretty good IPA... not as good as their other stuff"
""
""
"Can poured into nonic. Clear copper with two finger head that lingers and leaves lacing all the way down. Pine resin aroma with citrus and tropical fruits. Some dank notes and boozy bread too. Solid citrus hop bitterness on the tongue with good malt sweetness in support. Sticky but crisp mouthfeel with average carbonation and mediun-full body."
""
"On tap at great lost bear. Flabby and odd. Sort of like the new Ballantine, without the woody intrigue and over the top bitterness. Ho hum."
""
""
"Pretty good, nice hop to malt balance."
""
"Ten Fidy was delicious. This however, was not."
""
""
""
"Good but at this point it's pretty old because I failed to look at the can on date before purchase.  That being said, I'll give it a fair shake.  Pours a deep amber.  Aroma is malt and caramel.  Taste is malt heavy with a small amount of hops. Mouthfeel is medium tobthick.  Overall a decent beer that I would love to try fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O (3.75) - I don't know what it is about OB, but their beers are just off to me.  I mean, I don't mind it, but I don't know if I like it as much as others."
""
""
"This one is a little frustrating...I like Oskar Blues, but both Dale's Pale Ale and Deviant Dale's were dissapointing.  This one drinks ok, but may land slightly above average for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love that it's a tall boy...wish there was more of a hop kick. Tasty beverage"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More of a malty than hippy IPA, but very drinkable and quite tasty."
""
""
"O: Very solid, very dank IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O-  Not bad, but was expecting a little more due to the fact of how much I enjoyed Dale's Pale Ale."
"It's a very good American IPA."
""
""
""
"16 oz can poured into a tall tulip glass.  A beautiful clear amber color with a huge frothy head that slowly dissipates and leaves some lace.  Smell is piney and dank with a little floral herbs.  Reminds me of Cannabis.  Taste is nicely balanced between big sweet malt, dank floral hoppiness, and bracing bitterness.  Mouth feel is a bit thick, nicely carbed, and slightly oily.  Overall, a good AIPA."
""
""
"Part of my beer ratings go as such: ""Would I drink it again tomorrow?"" For Deviant Dale's I say tomorrow and every day after. Seriously tho, it's what an IPA should be: crisp, refreshing, soothingly bitter, better w/ each sip."
""
""
""
"For a strong ipa it went down like a session beer. Aroma-some piney notes, orange peel, grapefruit, some onion/garlic bitterness. Taste was a real surprise. Great mild beer. Citrus after taste. No bitterness at all."
"Not much surprising to offer. You know what a strong IPA is like. The characteristics are all here. Simply speaking, I had this on tap, it's one of the best IPA's I've had to date. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid IPA and a little different than most I'm used to as it lacks a lot of the fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was really good, and it surprised me because the pale ale was just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty descent IPA, big hoppy brew with a good a good kick."
""
""
"Very very bitter. I don't know if it's the malts or what. It's pretty harsh. It's like a crappier stone ipa"
"Not my favorite IPA. If you like citrusy IPA's stay away. ABV hidden well. I could see it paired with offal, like liver and onions. I give it a 82/100."
""
"Gotta try this again.  You had it on tap at Mason Lounge, but it wasn't an environment conducive getting a solid impression from it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O = A deliciously potent IPA, one that I highly recommend."
""
"So smooth & balanced. Very nice. Can't taste the 8%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer. Period. If you're thinking about getting it... do it. I feel torn between this and G'Night. They are very evenly matched. I appreciate the pint can. One of these guys after work and you're good to go. If I could always find it at $10 a 4, I'd make it a regular."
""
""
""
""
"Deep golden brown in color with lots of minuscule sediment suspended within the body.   Brussels lacing.  There's easily a bit over an inch of tightly packed beige foam on top.  Nice aroma of herbal hops and light malt is present.  The flavor is moderately pungent herbal hops and delicate light malt.  The body is a touch chewy and moderately carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a really nice IPA right on the cusp of being a double - runs darker in color than the typical IPA, but retains a crisp profile of hops with a slightly toasty malt profile for balance"
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not enjoy this beer at all. The bitterness is incredibly unpleasant, and contributes  to a horrible flavor. I got a four pack, would not buy it again. I ended up giving the last one away because the beer was so bad..."

"A bitter IPA on a maltier body, this felt more of a DIPA to me. I hope had more of the citrus character of their APA, which is a reference to me. That said it is still well crafted."

"Dark cloudy burnt orange color. Poured with a decent head leaving a good lacing while dissipating. Lots of citrus aroma from this one. An undertone of earthyness in the aroma. Very fruity flavors. Nice and bitter. Lots of grapefruit and maybe some pineapple taste. Yummy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid IPA, just a little pricey.  Won't be dying to buy another 4-pack soon."
""
"Pours an dark orange with a large lasting beige head, mild lacing. Aroma of caramel malt earthy pine hops, citrus and orange peel esters. Taste same as aroma with some sweet mild marmalade flavor, malty and mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, smooth, has a nice combination of sweet and bitterness. The finish is a combination caramel malt, orange and marmalade flavors with some earthy pine hops for balance. Brew goes down easy. Overall a very well made and nicely balance brew."

"O: Great overall beer. All of the parts play well together. Only a slight hint of the 8% ABV. This beer is complex and has lots of flavors going on. Also the bitterness is kept in check - which I like."

"Big enough to drink a tad slower and bold enough to help that happen. Good but not great. Probably a bit better as a winter beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very well done IPA. Definite deviant nature, and yet middle ground enough to be drunken repeatedly. Drank in Indian Land, SC, July 9th, 2013."

"P.S. I reviewed this on July 2nd, checked my leave time balance, and decided that I should take the 3rd off. So now that my long weekend has started, I decided to put Deviant Dale's to the test, and compare it to Dogfish Head Burton Baton, which was in my fridge. BB is a blend of Dogfish 90 Minute and an oak-aged old ale. Its oak-y characteristics create a taste similar to Deviant Dale's so I thought it'd be a good comparison. The two have a lot in common. BB has a more hop-forward profile and a more bitter edge, DD is sweeter. I've always liked BB a great deal. If the truth be known, I like DD better. At my local craft ale shop, they're the same price for a four-pack, but the BB four pack is four 12 oz. bottles, the DD four pack is four 16 oz. cans."

"Drinkability: This is a go-to beer if I'm looking for portability, taste, and quality. Thanks Dales for using a pint can! A nice variation of the IPA style."

"The fruity notes are bold for a single IPA. Frankly, at 8% this is really a DIPA in disguise. I’m not complaining!"

"Overall: I love the taste. This is definitely a one-timer though. It's so heavy but definitely enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is complex and bold, rich in hops and malt. A strong IPA that pushes towards a DIPA. Very enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer medium bodied and pretty smooth even though there is some push here and there with the bitterness making it feel like it could be a little unmanageable. It has a good drinkable feel and goes down easy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Everything about this beer is different and unusual, and I really enjoyed it. Call me crazy, but almost a cross between an old ale and an IPA. Definitely one of the sweetest IPA's I've ever had, and the mouth feel is DIPA/IIPA all the way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Served from a can into a room temp pint glass. Pours a golden caramel color with a frothy head. Strong nose of black pepper and sweet onion. Taste is very forward with floral and earthy characteristics. Bitterness is noticeable but doesn't linger. Overall this is a good ipa, but the sweet onion is overpowering"
""
"A must try, I'd like to keep one always around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is easily one of my favorite DIPAs. The balance is fantastic, the flavors suit me to a ""T", and everything seems to fit just right. I see a lot more excuses for crossing the state line now that this is available one state over. Not only worth seeking out, you should make it a point to do so."
"O: Overall a really well-executed high gravity IPA."
""
""
""
"Beer pours a clear amber. Beige head with nice lacing. Aroma is piney and resinous. Taste follows the nose. Some malt up front with a powerful hop finish: pine, pot, and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is good. A bit heavy but not in a bad way. This is a big, substantial beer with some serious piney hops. Overall, an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o.a. 8.5 outta 10 on beerlover's rating scale, I would definitely buy this again, may have even rateded higher if I hadn't had so many good pale ales and india pales lately!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Just off the top of my head, one of the three or four best IPAs I've had. Not quite as sweet as Zombie Dust or Pliny the Elder, but this beer is right up there. Easy to drink despite solid bitterness and a good amount of alcohol. The tall boy can is just a bonus."

"Deviant Dale's IPA is a supercharged hop-bomb with just enough malt support to keep from mistaking the beer for alcoholic fruit juice. Its exquisite balance and drinkability is a welcome rarity."
""
""
""
""
"This is a throwback to some of the older IPA recipes that hang around, and in the environment of palate destroying astringent bitter beers, it's very welcome overall in my glass. I do wish that it weren't as malty for an IPA, but I can't complain too much with the delightful citrus notes that stick around. There's nothing too demonic about this, though - personally, G'Knight was far more intense and sweet. This still stands as a solid beer and shows that Oskar Blues really is among some of the great larger craft breweries out there."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. Glad to have Oscar Blues back in Nevada"

"Not a world beating IPA, but I definitely enjoyed it. It's for the true hop heads the like the bitterness bite in their beer."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Not as good as the original, but still tasty and quite strong."
""
"A very well done IPA. Big hop character, with a large malt backbone as well."

"Overall - don't let the can fool you. This is a good brew. Not in my top 10 but certainly a serviceable brew that I can see purchasing again."
""
""
""
""
"Apricot-orange brew with a big foamy head that recedes slowly with ample lacing. Smells delicious. Apricots, citrus, mango. Tropical. Taste has notes of pine resin, ruby red grapefruit pith, a bit floral. Moderate bitterness but with an ample malt backbone. It's tasty and juicy, but where did those tropical notes go? Medium body with creamy mouthfeel. Holds together well and leaves the palate wet and quenched."

""
"O-This was an outstanding beer that I feel I could drink all night"
""
"O: Taste was a bit of a letdown, as the nose was tropical, and the taste was lacking in that respect."
""
"O. Overall this beer belongs alongside all Oskar Blues great beers !! KILLS DUDE"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Comes across as a somewhat typical IPA but one on the sweeter side of the spectrum. Still quite delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Worth every penny, truly a great IPA to sit and enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, quite a nice IPA, and nice to have it in a can."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best IPA's I've had in a while. Great showing from a great brewer."
""
"Almost perfect and very probably the best beer I've ever tried (thankfully it has at least limited UK distribution into the bargain). Phenomenal with an amazing taste. I'll be picking this up again the next time I see it anywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like the regular Dale's at least as much though this is also a welcome addition to the lineup"
""
""
"Malty presence with balanced hop flavor and bitterness, but the bitterness does linger in the finish. Perhaps a little grassy in the end, but still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"T- Pine, bitter, sweetness of mild tropical fruit. Very pine driven."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a great hoppy red. I think this one was a little old but it was just as good as i when i had it a few months back when it was fresher."
""
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me a bit of Sixpoint Resin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final thoughts - $16 a 4 pack is silly, loving the 8% abv. Worth a go (or two) for sure"
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Wow, a nice surprise out of the can. Opaque golden orange appearance in the glass, albeit minimal head and quickly dissipating lacing, notwithstanding ample tiny bubbles. Great smell of pine, grapefruit, pineapple resin on the nose. Very sweet, floral, tropical, orange zest fruit on the front end if the palate, with smooth and evenly balanced malt nuance throughout the finish. Reminds me a little of Ballast Point Sculpin, which I really like. Similar profiles. Will gladly buy this one many times over. An excellent top tier DIPA, in my book."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This is a solid beer even if it's not one of my favorites by Oskar Blues, but if OB is a mainstay in your fridge, it might be nice to alternate this in every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Was $12.49 for the 4 pack at HEB in Cedar Park, a bit expensive for a can of beer but was a great can of Beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 16 oz can into a champaign flute. The ale has a lovely honey-golden color and an amazing turbid yeasty appearance. Nice head, good lacing. The aroma is deep, rich, and complex, hops, yeast, malt. The flavor is an amazing in-your-face complex mix of hops, malt, pine and grain. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an outstanding IPA, one of my all-time favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bam! Hops front to back, very intense. Tallboy can presence is a plus for us, so thankfully it delivered—not that we were worried. Very well done. Sip to sip, it becomes more drinkable. A lot of talk about this beer, and it certainly lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
"Beautiful."
""
""
""
"O/D - The age definitely took away from this. You can tell it's a solid, resinous, hoppy DIPA though, just a bit old. Tasty though."
""
""
"O - A solid IPA without being anything special. These hop driven beers just all blend into one for me and its very rare to find anything different."
""
"O- This is a good beer. The flavors blend very well, yet stay sort of separate... Nicely balanced. One of the sweetest IPAs I've ever had AND one of the most bitter at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a side note my glass has about a third left and the head has finally settled to a biscuity island floating above the India Pale Ale Ocean."
""
""
""

"Overall this is a great sort of hybrid IPA/DIPA style. Everyone should try it."

"The taste is outstanding. Nice bitter hops, combined with sweet caramel. Mouth feel is thick and indulgent. One of the best pale ales I've ever had. That caramel flavor is like nothing I've ever had. It's like beer candy. I'm totally impressed with Oskar Blues, and will be sampling all they have to offer."
"A pretty hard follow-up to Dale's Pale Ale, but OB's is more than capable of following through - their obviously deviant nature aiding and abetting to no end. Tasty, heady, and enjoyable as hell to sip or slurp, all dependent on situation. Were that I could procure this on my home turf, at the very least to help recreate my GBAF 2013 experience."
""
"Pours a nice orange clear hue with good creamy head. Smells like pine and grapefruit with pineapple and candy sugar. Malty for an IPA, but very nice. Grapefruit is thr prominent flavor with some caramel malt flavor and a bit of lingering pine. Slick on the tongue and a little heavy. Good beer."
""
"O- a big flavor IPA that doesn't overwhelm"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With the claimed 8% but a single IPA classification; this one's really in no man's land. I'd say the dry finish pushes it a little closer to single IPA and justifies the classification. Really interesting, spicy IPA."

"This is a little more dank and herbal / pine focused than I prefer in a hop bomb (I prefer them to be fruit-hop balanced), but this will definitely hit the spot for the hop heads out there (including me). If you are particularly sensitive to the chive / garlic / onion note found in some hops, then this may not be the beer for you; it doesn’t have too much of that character though, as I am able to enjoy it. It is likely that the aroma has dropped off a bit in the month and a half since this has been bottled, but the flavor is still scathingly hoppy."
""
""
""

"Overall good beer for a beer. Good beer for oskar blues, but I'm accustomed to them making amazing beer."
""

""
""
""
""
"This was one of my first wow beers.  Over time, it's come down a bit, but is still a very enjoyable beer.  I think this keg is probably fairly new; I have had some cans with a bit of age on them and the sweetness seemed to come out more.  This may be one to check the dates on before trying."
""
""
""
"O: Recommended IPA, especially if high hop aroma and flavor is sought without extreme bitterness."
""
""
""
"it's not cheap, a four pack of 16 oz. cans is $13, but it's well crafted enough to be worth it."
""
""
"Rich and full mouthfeel, finishes tingly, carbonation burps. Great beer."
""
"I am surprised it is an IPA and not a Double IPA as it has a very smack you in the head Hop presence and fairly high abv for an IPA. On my first try it had a very dank and earthy hopiness that was a bit overwhelming. There was also a hint of blue cheese that turned me off a bit. Not to be discouraged I gave it another shot. The second time I was really digging all the earthy hops and even a hint of pine resin mixed into the brew. It was still a hop overload, but I was able to enjoy its assault on my palate. For an IPA this is definitely a gigantic hop bomb and won’t be for everyone. I was able to find my own personal love for Deviant Dale’s but can understand the love/hate relationship people have with it."

"Overall - 4.25 - Like the other Oscar Blues beers, it's awesome that this comes in a can, especially a tall boy! Brings me back to the days of Natty Light. It really is a great beer, but the price is what drags the overall score down for me. I just hate paying 12-13 bucks for a 4 pack of beer that's comparable to so many beers that cost 60% of what this costs. Oh well."

"D- This is a huge beer that coats the tongue and stays there. Not an everyday drinker but I enjoyed it."
""
" Upfront pine notes, spicy. Nice bite to it with a bitter and medium dryness type of finish. Sme people talk about a creamy mouthfeel but I disagree and get a more carbonated and medium thickness.. The old favorite HT, Pliny, Gandhi, MW, Flower power better but this is quite good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A good IPA."
"Overall- Solid beer, good IPA. Worth a try. Won't change your world but is a quite accessible IPA that borders on being a DIPA. Funny how Oskar Blues is coy in regard to how they designate their beers. Dale's seems like an IPA and Deviant seems close to a DIPA. But I don't care as long as they make good beer."

"Poured a vibrant orange with a half-finger white head that dissipated to a ring of white foam. Looks nice, but standard. It's an IPA look for sure. Scents of citrus pith, grape fruit and some pine and juniper-like notes. Pretty much what is expected for an American IPA. Just as inviting and pleasing as always. Flavors of grapefruit, citrus pith, a bit of pine and malt sweetness. It's quite bitter, and quite piney and citrusy, and with the malt sweetness drinks almost like a DIPA, rather than an IPA. Quite good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Good for an IPA, makes it easy to drink. Overall this is a good American IPA. Quite strong in the flavor department and very assertive, it showcases all the qualities I look for in an American IPA"

"This is the first time I have had this beer in cans. Served in a 16 oz 4 pack this is a lot of beer to drink on a day trip to the mountains or park. Oscar Blues has been doing cans for years so they have to figure they know how to do it right. Sitting around a campfire after a big adventure this beer is hard to beat but with its thick sweetness probably not the best beer to start an all day journey outside with."

"Like a double IPA version of the Dales Pale Ale. Same sweet and rich full body flavor with twice the punch. This can be felt not only in the increased alcohol content but also in its more powerful and floral hopiness.its a good beer and ill drink it again."

"O: A very nice IPA with plenty of dank, citrusy hops. Fairly easy to drink, but deceivingly bitter and hoppy towards the end. The 8% goes down too easily. Quite pricey at $14 for a 4-pack, but it's nice to have every once and a while"
""
""
""
"Just happened to see this on tap at the local Mellow Mushroom. Couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it. I assumed it would be a stronger version of Dale's Pale Ale, but it's definitely an IPA style. At 8% I'd say it's more like a double IPA. It was served in a goblet. With it's deep orange color it looks like a million bucks. And the hoppy nose and sweet flavor do not disappoint. Also it is quite balanced. Most strong IPAs are overly bitter from the hop presence. This one is not."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nicely done IPA bordering on a IIPA. Oskar Blues continues to impress me."
"The taste showcases more of the woodsy hop flavors like pine, bark, grass, moss and cannabis. Some onion, cilantro, biscuit and malt hold the end of the taste. Not my favorite array of flavors but certainly diverse and strong is Deviant Dale."
""
""
""
""
"O - While this is a thinner IPA than I prefer, the strong spicy hops win me over. Definitely a good beer to bring to a barbecue especially if you're looking to get a bit tipsy!"

"Overall: Picked up a single in Wiscoland. Can was about 2 months old, so not too old. Not too impressed with this one, gives some odd onion/dirt hop flavor that I don't like, plus feels a bit too thick. I'll stick with regular Dale's or Old Chub for Oskar Blues."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I put off this beer for a while after hearing about the “garlic/onion” profile with the hop flavors, but I really enjoyed this beer. Definitely not a starter's IPA, and borderline DIPA/IIPA. Still drinkable, but enough complexity to satisfy just about any hophead. Absolutely recommended."

"Oscar blues has produced a seriously world class pale ale. But I'm afraid the deviant is a beer that's just trying a bit too hard."

"Poured a seethru auburn brown/copper with one finer offwhite head that left a lace ring down glass whole time. Piney and grapelike hop aroma dominates my nose and the same can be said for the tongue. Hop bomb that balances itself with a little sticky malt sweetness so it's not nuking my tastebuds. Chewey medium bodied beer that is a sipper for sure as the hops and alcohol give off a biting finish in a good way."
""
"O- loved it. From the start to the end it did not let me down. With that being said, its better in the 48-58 degree range. Easier to drink than some, but not one to chug. Warming on the way down, but not too much alcohol presence even being 8%. Would love to have a few more down the road, but it won't take a place in my stable of go to beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know what it is. Ten Fidy is one of my favorite stouts and one of the best beers available in a can so I really want to like Dale's and this along with it, but a few times now I've been disappointed. Not likely to buy it again."

"The beer pours from the 16 ounce can, an orange-laced amber color with a decent cap of foam. The foam sticks and slides down the glass. Hops jump from the aroma. Pine, orange rind, grass, raw honey meld with a touch of toasted caramel malt. On the palate, the beer has a coating, oily aspect, but not to the degree that it is undesirable. Those hop oils contribute much of the flavor profile with grapefruit, pine, a hint of grass, but the malt is no slouch here. The slightly sweet caramel malt does its job by counteracting the hops for a tinge of balance. This is a nice beer. If this is a tweak of Dale's Pale Ale, it's a tweak in the right direction."

"O. Overall I enjoyed this brew....I'd like to try some fresh as this was approx. 10 months old. Seems to age very well, no skunkiness whatsoever. A good sipping beer."

"O - This IPA is definitely a unique IPA in comparison to others that I have had. It is real earthy and piney with some of the other aspects mention which make it worth trying on those aspects alone not to mention the awesome mouth feel and beautiful look it has. A must try for a hop head looking for a new hop aroma other then the typical west coast citrus hop bomb, Cheers!"

"Full bodied IPA with crisp dry finish. The finish could be smoother and leaves a harsh taste to the non hop head. Not the sessionial beer that one might be looking for but not the pallet wrecker like some big bodied IPA's. Good single serving beer overall!"

"Super nice IPA, bordering in a double. A definite sipper and worth savoring every drop. One of my new favorites."

"Pours clear and copper with a little orangey hue. A thin head of soapy foam that fell fast to some really gorgeous lace. Left a ring and thin skin that never faded. Nose is peachy. Literally, sweet like a peach with a hint of resin in the nose. Caramel malt, bread lightly floral and pine. Taste is malt forward and I love that. Then sweet citrus, orange some grapefruit comes in on the middle and then a little oil and bitter as it goes down resinous, piney, sweet and juicy. Mouthfeel is thin and sticky. The one weird thing about it was that as it warmed it took on an oniony garlic like taste. I wasn’t sure if that was intended. This was a really great IPA that was clean and refreshing."

"Yet another solid IPA enjoyed by someone who isn't really big on this style. Lots of grapefruit flavors and other citrus, smooth and creamy, pretty hoppy, and easy going down. Tastes best when it's cold and fresh out of the can. You certainly feel this more toward the end, but still good. This is a well-made beer that packs a pretty big hop punch. Yet, satisfying and not overly bitter to me. I enjoyed this a lot."
""
"O: Really a nice hoppy, somewhat harsh, boozy, fruity DIPA; I like"
"O: This is a unique IPA for me, haven't had any beers with floral flavors in it but it mixes well, it's a solid IPA and would definitely recommend trying it if you see it"
"O: 4.5"

"Blah, I was sorely let down by this one, especially after having tried and liked the Pale Ale. I don't know what could have went wrong here, but the shear potency of the pines, resins, and oils were just too much for me to handle. The heavy fusel alcohol burn didn't help the drinkability at all, either. Just a weird brew that I don't exactly understand the love for. I know that palates are indeed different, but mine can't be this far off, can it? Perhaps sometime in the future I'll give it another whirl and see if it was a possible bad batch, but if my cans were in spec, then I just don't ""get"" this brew."

"Had this a while ago, not sure how I never gave it a review. The beer poured out as a hazy golden color with a nice foamy white head on top. The retention and lacing were pretty solid on this. The smell of the beer was resin-like and piney, very floral and pungent with hops. The taste was sharp and bitter with a subtle malt sweetness in there as well with a biscuity toasted flavor as well. The mouthfeel was good, nicely carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall it's a really good IPA."
""
""
""
""
"It's more of an Imperial IPA in my book, and a very good one at that. But G'Knight is better, so when I feel like a splurge on a signature beer from Oskar Blues, it will be a TenFidy (one of the best brews period) or the outstanding G'Knight."

"I got a tall boy of Deviant Dale's in a blind mix carton recently and what a nice find. Pours deep, rusty amber with a thick 2-finger head that lasts all night. The aroma was subdued, making the flavor all that more of a pleasant surprise. This is a particularly rich and complex IPA. The hops take the lead, giving it a hearty grapefruit bite with piney notes, but those hops are all hung on a solid backbone of malt that creates an excellent balance. The alcohol is surprisingly low key, given an ABV of 8.0%. This also has a unusually (at least for an IPA) silky/creamy mouth feel cut by a refreshing level of carbonation. I've never seen this brew on shelves around here, but I will definitely be on the lookout for more."

"D- An enjoyable IPA, it comes in a can, even better it comes in a tallboy."

"O: A nice IPA. Definitely a big beer, but the flavors compliment each other nicely, rather than compete. Good piney hops and toasted cereal make this a beer that is definitely worth drinking."
"Overall - Sure feels like a DIPA here, surprised of the categorization as an AIPA that is this raw, but it might explain the breadiness versus a thinner, fruitier version of this brew. I would recommend!"
""
""
""
""
"much better versions of this style out there"
""
"O: A really solid IPA. Something that I could see myself drinking regularly, especially throughout the summer when sitting outside. I wouldn't put it in the elite IPA category, but really good nonetheless."
""
""
"Pours from the 16 oz. can a coppery orange color with a fluffy, off white 2-finger head. Light carbonation, very few bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is a nice soft whiff of citrusy orange with perhaps a little pineapple. 1st sip brings an initial hit of malt sweetness followed by orangey hops. A bit of pine and grapefruit appear in the middle and last on the swallow. The citrus/pine mix lingers after the swallow, but a hint of maltiness appears as well. As it warms, the hops become more dominant. Mouthe feel is medium heavy and somewhat fizzy. Overall, this is a well balanced and tasty IPA. It's not overdone, as many are,, and easily approachable by people like me who are put off by the 10 megaton hop bomb."

"This is a beer to be drunk by professionals: no lager lovers need apply as this will have them sprawled over a tree trunk squealing like a pig. Did you say deviant? Should you partake of this, it will be the last beer of the day."
""
""
"All told, this is a solid IIPA, yet not inexpensive either. Absolutely enjoyable, but not the juicy citrus bomb others deliver for less money. Tasting Dale's Deviant IPA makes me appreciate the true greatness Heady Topper achieves and that Vermont is a great place to be for hop zombies!"

"Need to try this again fresher. Really enjoyed it at older than optimal, suspect I'd like it even more when fresh. Too pricey though. Better IPAs for substantially lower cost out there."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent IPA, especially if you've gone awhile without a big beer and want something to spend some serious time with. The overbearing sweetness is the only real downfall, and even that has it's charm when you're in the mood. It's a beer that's meant to take a while to drink, and not one for quick knockbacks."

"All in all I wasn't a big fan of this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of an American IPA, the hop profile was so weird and unique in this beer, I have never had anything that tastes like it and I think it's either a love or hate type of thing, my brother seems to like it, but I don't feel the same way. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't overly bitter and it was fairly smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention and I think a pint can would be too much for me, splitting this is the way to go I feel that 8 ounces is about all I could handle. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty nice and the lacing was pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion, garlic, and roasted hop aromas and flavors, they weren't appealing to me and they felt out of place, but they really made this beer stick out from all the other American IPA's. I don't think I would buy this again, but I would like to see how some of my other craft beer drinking friends react to this beer, I'm pretty sure it's a love it or hate it type of thing, I wouldn't really recommend this beer but if you don't mind some onion and garlic in your beer this might be worth a try. All in all I thought this was one weird ass beer, I didn't find it to be undrinkable, but those onion, garlic, and burn hop aspects were a turn off for me, this just ins't the beer for me, but I could see how some people could like it. I appreciate the creativity from Oskar Blues with this beer, but it just didn't seem to flow together well and I'm still not sold on this brewery. This was a really weird beer, enough said. On a side note, i have have some hops growing in my garden and when i crush the hop cones between my fingers I get an aroma that is almost dead on with this beer, after looking it up I see that this beer has a good amount of Summit hops is in it, so i'm now thinking that there's a good chance that my unknown hops plants could be Summit hops, it's interesting."
"Overall (4.00) – This is a solid 4 in my book. Its a very satisfying yest not outstanding IPA with interesting malt character. As much as I hate to say it, the closest thing I can attribute to the smell, is weed. For a beer that just randomly walked through the door, I couldn't ask for more."
""
""
"Overall, Deviant Dale’s is a pretty unique IPA, considering not too many beers (to my knowledge) use Summit hops. It’s a BIG IPA as far as the bitterness goes as well, and I don’t see many people drinking too many of these at once. No doubt a tasty beer, but one I’d not have regularly."
""
"This beer pours a nice caramely color, quite clear and with a really nice head that's delightfully creamy. The smell is pretty hoppy, but dominated by one kind of hop that has a pronounced ""oniony"" flavor to it. The taste is similar, but more oniony. Mouthfeel is nice. Overall, this strikes me as a well done ipa and it's very unique. However, I do not like the ""onion hop"" flavor, or smell at all. I've been generous in the rating for aroma and smell because undoubtedly there are people who like it, but I'm not sure I'll be having this one again."
""

"The mouthfeel is mediciny which is the main contributor to its low overall score."

"I really was pumped to try this beer I absolutely love their Ten Fidy. I loved the aftertaste of this IPA, it had a balance that I have yet to equal in any other IPA. Super smooth, the bitterness hits early, but mellows out and really makes you want to drink the entire 4 pack. Another solid Oskar Blues production."
"Overall - The smell and taste are pretty juicy and not over the top bitter. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy but it still has decent drinkability. Great offering from Oskar Blues that is just what I want in an India pale ale! Being readily available, this just may become my go to IPA."

"Bought at Highland Liquor Store in Birmingham in May 2012. Poured into a shaker a deep copper color like a brand new penny that allowed lot of lustrous light through rather easily. Topped with 3cm or so of big, frothy, white head that laced the glass very nicely. The smell was very resinous like hemp oil and a freshly cut grapefruit. Taste was very bitter, full of pine hops and oily grapefruit and maybe sour apple as well. Finishes long and bitter, and the alcohol definitely sneaks through. Very good beer overall. I think they're onto something with these IPAs in the can."
""
"O- Incredibly dank and piney. Really interesting hop profile, massive hoppiness and a huge malt backbone. Very bold flavors and great mouthfeel. Tastes like a super hopped up barleywine or more balanced Double IPA."
"Pours a dark, Baltic amber color that reflects dark light, and is clear as a bell. Smells out of the bag like fresh whole hops, the fragile florals and earthy garlic notes present--a real fresh/late hopped balance. Taste is balanced, not too sweet or dry, with light malts and fresh florals and notes not always present in heavily hopped beers. Really great here. Mouthfeel is as it should be. This is solid, and though pricey, I think worth every bit of coin spent on this."

""
"I had this beer on tap at the Alehouse in Redding, CA. The first thing that really hits you is the hop aroma. Very on the dank side. Strong citrus, floral, piney, lots of different hop blends. The flavor was very hoppy as well. This pint was enjoyable, however just a little to hop forward for me. The overall appearance of the beer was good and it is definately a beer that I would enjoy drinking again, Great job Oskar Blues! I love the can tap handles:)"

"Overall- A good, not great, IPA. I can't get past the very spicy nature of it. That is just not my cup of tea (beer). I am a huge Dale's Pale Ale Fan so this dissapointed me a bit. I can't knock the hustle though( Oskar Blues will stay on my radar). Happy Drinking!"

"It's been a while since I've had this beer. It has a nice copper color with a nice frothy head with a touch of gold color on it. The nose really pops out at you with subtle notes of pine and lemon grass. The mouth feel is quite resinous but not as well balanced. This beer lingers which is know surprise coming from Oskar Blues. If you like your hops and the outdoors this is a damn good canned IPA"

"O – Tremendous IPA, another strong offering from OB. This one isn't as overbearing as some of their brews, but it shows a tremendous hop profile, and has a good amount of malt to balance it all out without being too sweet or sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
"While this is a tasty beer, I don’t feel like I can call it an IPA. It seems like what a Dale’s Pale would taste like if both the hop and malt content were boosted. It’s extremely drinkable, but the drinker needs to keep in mind it’s relatively high alcohol percentage."

"O - Overall I liked this quite a bit. I know OB has quite a fan base out there, but I'm quite satisfied by some of their brews, and underwhelmed by others. This may be my favorite OB, with TenFidy and the Gubna pulling up the rear."

"Bottom Line: it surprises me this is not rated much higher."

"Overall a good IPA, but a little too caramelly for my taste. Seems like most of the Colorado IPAs I've had lean toward a heavier, more caramelly profile."
"Final Thoughts: Knowing full well the age of this IPA I'm grading a little above what I actually think of it. At about $15 a four pack it was a huge rip off and unfortunately the purchaser didn't think to look at the canned on date before getting it as a gift for me. However, there are very small moments of greatness in the flavor that make it clear that this IPA would be very good fresh. Would I drink it again? Yes, give me a fresh can any day."

"I really like IPAs like this. Its a very unique flavor profile a great change of pace as it doesnt beat you over the head with bitterness. A awesome beer. A new favorite :)"
"Pours a really nice looking reddish amber in color with a smaller off white head and very good lacing. The smell is fairly sweet and malty with just a tad of citrus hops peaking through. The flavor is more malty and balanced then allot of big IPA's and sweet as the nose would suggest, but still has a good amount of hopping with a resin and piney hop profile. The mouthfeel is thick and boozy but good, and its is good and drinkable. Overall a good beer while not being the hoppyest of IPA's and it also drinks well out of the can. The price will lead me elsewhere in the future, and is the biggest detriment to this brew."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 88"
"Taste follows with a smooth floral/ slightly caramel almost nutty malty sweet with pine. Then emerging is big fruity hop flavor. Grapefruit bitterness, big blood orange sweetness with a touch of mango. Turns slightly dry finish, toasty/hay-like layer laces the palate with some sweetness of malt and hop layered on top. A great brew! More to the malty side of DIPA, yet balanced very well. definitely will buy again."
" I just mention so readers know where my taste lies."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper orange with a nice white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is pine and citrus. The taste is like the smell, Citrus and Pine hops and Grapefruit. A malt backbone that balances it out. The bitterness is just right for this brew. I was recommend this one and I will now do the same."

"Overall / Drinkability: Quite nice - very impressive and very hoppy, but not so bitter that it smacks you around and leaves you wanting to stop at one. This one is dangerous....I really want another but at 8% ABV I know better, and yet, it wouldn't take too much arm twisting for me to open another 16oz can at which point I know I'm doomed and laughing it off for the rest of the evening. So very drinkable. A great American IPA."

"Very good ipa, sets its self apart by the pungent oily hops, sweet malt and the high abv for being a single. Very easy to take down, not as punchy in the hops as it could be with the sweet malt, some pale ales are hoppier than this. Suits the can well, as well as the Colorado cold."
""
"O. A well balanced beer which is drinks way easier than a beer of this abv should. I will not hesitate to buy this again."

"O. Good beer. Nice balance. If it wasnt for the 8% it would be pretty easy to put down a large quantity of these. Not a very hoppy flavor, but there is plenty of those beers to go around."

"Expected more hop character from this one. There's a decent bang initially, but the malt really reigns it in."
"O: it's not a bad dipa but its doesn't have a lot of hop flavor compared to the smell. It's a bit to malty for me and I wouldn't describe it as valences definitely not my style dipa but its not bad either"

"O- Stunningly bitter... of course, it IS rated at 85 IBU, so you know that going in. Although the freshness of my sample could be a consideration, I found this IPA to be top-notch. Not top-notch for a canned brew, but top-notch for an IPA. It is totally a west-coaster, so Dogfish drinkers would turn up their nose immediately, but it really is worth the 12-13 bucks I paid for a 4-pack. There is no way I could put away four of these in a session. I will be looking to purchase this one again soon, but I will make sure it is less than 100 days old."

"16 ounce can into tulip glass; canned on 10/16/2012, ""iapprovethismessage"" slogan. Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, mango, floral, caramel, moderate pine, grass, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, caramel, bread, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, bread, orange rind, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor complexity with a nicely balanced malt backbone; with minimal cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! (though I would definitely place this as being a DIPA blindly) Great hop flavor complexity and malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering I will be getting again."

"Head is still a good one finger after five minutes. taste is citrus and leather with a substantial amount of malts. I don't care how this is classified you should try it!"
""
"Overall: A very good American style IPA. Very big hop taste. It seems closer to a imperial IPA than a regular one. Its everything you would expect from a good hoppy beer."
""
""
""

"Close to three fingers of deep eggshell white foam, good mix of bubble sizes with moderate dimpling and extremely strong head retention, the lacing in turn impressive with broad, ultra-sticky streaks covering the glass sides. The liquid is is a cloudy coppery red color which takes on a more orange to yellow haze further from the glass center, while opaque still hard to see any bubbles within. The scents positively leap out of the glass into your nose from a good ten inches away with outsized white grapefruit, lemon orange citrus, pine sap, cocoa powder and then tropical pineapple, papaya to nectarine, peach fruit, noticeable grass and pepper kick to it as well, softens into honey and molasses, not an incredibly complex experience but plenty of intensity and verve. Full-bodied, the carbonation is soft and downy which creates more sticky, clingy texture as well as length rather than cleansing freshness. The chocolate, cocoa and vanilla maltiness more pronounced, piles more sweetness onto the pine, honey, caramel, sweet tea and at times cola bean accents. Curiously the grapefruit, lemon citrus pulls back into the whole here albeit no wallflower. Same for the peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple fruit, especially as it takes on a metallic, quinine like edge through the finish. Hides the alcoholic heat well, This is a “big boy” and arguably a double IPA in character. (Canned 9/6/12)"

""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the explosion of piney hops in the aroma and following taste. This made for a highly refreshing, and uniquely hoppy beverage. There was a hearty malty backbone, with caramel sugars, along with a very prominent lemon tea quality, making for another interesting twist to mix with such a strong hop varietal. The feel was also notable, with soft slurp and continued creaminess to the last drop. This guy will truly hit the spot."
"O: Needless to say, I was totally satisfied with this outing. Kudos, Oskar Blues!"

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge yellow white head that takes forever to recede and gets some stick on with the sides of the glass. Citrus and pine aromas waft towards my nose almost immediately after the can goes crack. Resinous pine and green onion dominates the aroma with quite a dankness that I could sniff all day dude. There's a sweet caramel and bread malt base in there, but it's so far down the rabbit hole that its hard to find. The flavor holds a bit more malt than the aroma suggested with a solid sweet caramel and simple syrup flavor up front. Pine, grapefruit, resin, green onion, and garlic flavored hops abound in the flavor but always provide a smooth bitterness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy resinous mouthfeel. Very flavorful beer with a lot going on here. Its a touch on the sweet side for my personal tastes, but I could drink this."
"O - It reminds me of a Christmas tree in smell and taste. I haven't have an IPA this piney in a long time. This is interesting to drink, but I prefer the citrus IPA's of Michigan and Ohio."

"On tap. Pours a slightly hazy golden copper with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a lot of piney hops, quite a bit of dankness, a little bit of orange, and some caramel. Initial taste has a light sweetness with lots of dank hops, some pine, and a bit of caramel. Quite dry overall. The finish is quite bitter with some lingering pine. Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Perhaps a bit too bitter."
"O- a pleasing offer from OB, reminds me more of a DIPA more than a IPA... way more malt forward"

"O: Overall a decent Ipa that I will re-visit when I want a slightly malty one."
"My demo can of this a couple months ago really impressed me, so I figured I'd check it out on tap whilst 'twas possible still. W00t. It pours a clear orange-amber topped by a finger of lightly dirty off-cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, orange zest, light caramel, and a broad hint of pine. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis still on the citrus zest, though the pine ensures a decent bitter bite in the background. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a lovely little IPA, one that's heavy on the hops without completely sacrificing balance. Good times."

"16 ounce can, canned on 10/05/12. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear burnt orange color with about an inch and a half frothy white head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy (pineapple, tropical fruit, grapefruit) and pine hops, and some caramel malt. It tastes mostly like pine hops, along with some citrusy hops and bready and caramel malt. There's a nice lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and creamy with low/moderate carbonation. It's a solid brew, but it's pricey at $12.99 a 4 pack."

I love OB products, but I don't see how this needs to retail at the price it does. It's good, but I can't see the upcharge vs similar offerings of nearly identical gravities and hop levels that other fine brewers put out there."

"O - I like this beer because it is strong as fuck and gets the job done, however it is definitely not worth the price. A 4-pack of 16oz cans goes for about $14 where I live. I'm sure I will buy it again once more down the road, but definitely not anytime soon."

"Ran into this at Delaney’s in New Haven. This pale ale looks clear and bronze with a thick egg shell colored head and lots of it staying behind to hug the tall pilsner glass. The nose picks up a beautiful citrus and toasted wheat bread yeast. Very pleasant stuff. The taste buds embrace a distinctively well constituted blend of grapefruit-orange citrus and grainy malt pine. Very impressive for an IPA, even more stunning for a pale ale. There’s a slight hint of alcohol but nothing that hurts this intense, delicious flavor. Body is nearly a full bodied brew with a fairly thick and syrupy hint to it, a midland carbonation keeps it fresh and drinkable. This is a beautiful grapefruit bread brew with a pale ale attraction for the hop masses. Bravo!"

"O: Its probably not fair that I am judging a DIPA that is almost 5 months old, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I will be looking forward to the release of this next spring so I can compare a fresh bottle to this review.  "
"Overall, a pretty good beer. The visuals were the best part of this beer. I wish there was a little more hop flavor to tear down the immense amount of pine. I found the hop flavor and bitterness is somewhat one dimensional."

"O: Good, but not my preference for hop flavor profile."
"Everything an IPA should be and then some.."

"Canned just a month ago. Pours an almost-clear amber color with a medium egg-white head. Scent is amazing on the hoppiness. Good amount of hops with some citrus and a bit of bready malt aromas. A light floral aroma, but more citrus. Taste is just tasty as hell. A great hop profile balanced with a bready malt profile, but not leaning toward an east-coast IPA. This beer keeps it west-coast qualities, while having a solid malt profile. Lovely bittering hops and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat chewy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this could easily pass for a DIPA, but it is very tasty regardless."
""
""
"Very nice ""extra"" IPA, recomended!"
""
"O - I can't blame this on freshness as its not even three weeks old. Its a very savory and danky beer. I can't even tote this one to taste buds either because the alcohol presence makes for one unbalanced beer."
"O: A very good IPA, I really like the malt/hops combination, they really work together here. A very dangerous beer, there is no hint of 8% alcohol and I could easily reach for a 2nd tall boy. I think Gordon is still my favorite, but Deviant Dale's is a very close second. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - would like to try the regular Dale's to compare to this. It is a middle grounbd IPA; profiled close to an imperial IPA but not quite as robust as that style. Was worth trying."

"Pours amber with golden and orangish hues with a two finger off-white head. Pine, fresh cut grass, flora, and undertones of citrus on the nose. Sweet malt immediately joined by grapefruit rind and pine, returning to sweet malt, and then finishes dry with some sweetness gradually relenting to citrus rind and pine and hints of alcohol. The heaviest malt presence I've experienced in an IPA and certainly borders on DIPA territory. At the very heaviest edge of medium bodied, abundant carbonation, and very smooth. Truly surprising that an IPA with such a heavy malt presence can be so balanced and finish so dry."
"This is similar to many other IPAs I've had. Although it doesn't really stand out, it's still good just the same."

"pour is amber orange with a tight yellowish white head. The nose is extremely citric. Some biscuity malty undertones. The taste has more resigny hops, still lots of citrus and light biscuity malt undertone. Medium body, well carbonated, a touch oily."
""
"Enjoyed on tap at The Thirsty Moose. Hits the spot, a good IPA with big hop aroma. Fruity,Juicy flavour. Cloudy orange wih a good mouthfeel as understated carbonation and malty backbone.By the end of it,with earthiness ,becomes a sipper as a 1.5 IPA."
""
"Overall - This is all about the floral hops - and as such this could be considered a ""one trick pony", but it is a trick that I really enjoy, and one that is done extremely well here. Alcohol is completely hidden, and with such an easy drinkability and 16oz cans @ 8%, this could ""plow"" the unsuspecting - handle with care, and enjoy ;o)"
""
""
"Overall this was really good."
""
"overall: great IPA, love the fact that it's in a pint pounder, hops are well used and abv is not too high and not too low."
""
"This brewer is infamous for always using cans and though that's thought of as lower class the truth is it keeps the beer fresher than bottles. I can definitively say this sample is the best IPA I've had packaged in a can (but yeah I did pour it into a glass)."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are many more hoppy IPA’s that I would choose before this one."
"Medium body, soft carbonation is nice, but a bit more would help clean things up a bit. Alcohol is well hidden. Nice beer."
"This has quickly become one of my favorite IPA's. Solid hop-forward. Lots of pine resin and bitterness that starts up front and goes long after the finish. Great job Oskar Blues!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, it's an above-average IPA, but nothing to really write home about. Indeed a bitter beer, but lacking either a balanced malty base, or floral/fruity notes."
"Overall: This is a dangerously drinkable high-ABV IPA."
""
"Overall, a very drinkable double-IPA. Despite a large amount of hops and malt, it's all held in a balance that's not tiring. You can drink a lot of this, but you'll be in trouble if you do."
""
"16oz. can served in a nonic. Pours a semi-hazy copper with a solid, one inch, cream-colored head the slowly recedes - the perfect pour with the head reaching just to the lip of the glass. Nose suggests some tropical fruit notes off the pop; however, once in the glass, there is a very assertive caramel malt presence, followed by a slight earthiness. Taste follows nose - starts with some caramel sweetness with a little bit of light fruit interspersed and culminating in an earthy hops bittering that quickly drops off. There's also a little something medicinal happening in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a slightly oily texture and a crisp, even carbonation that leaves a residual prickle in the mouth between quaffs. This beer is definitely closer to a DIPA than an American IPA as it has that slightly barleywine-esque character. Pretty good, but doesn't warrant the pricetag in my opinion."

"Nice carbontion and smooth for a DIPA. Def not a standard IPA. Really liked this and its earthy herbal hoppiness. One downside is the price. I get an employee discount but a four pack runs 13.85 for 16oz cans retail. They are tall boys but the price point is still a little off as I think all Oskar Blues products are. As a store we only received 1 case so I had to pull the trigger. Might try and grab one more just to have."

"this is an excellent example of a dipa and hard to believe it came in a can! very ""up in yo face"" but delicious. now i wanna go listen to curtis plum.."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a complex hop character balanced by malt sweetness.  Blast of earthy hops up front that provide a nice dry bitterness that is quickly checked by citrus and tropical fruit sweetness.  Hints of grapefruit, orange peel and mango with caramel malt, toffee and subtle nutiness adding sweetness for balance.  Subtle biscuit/graham cracker presence with a dry finish.  Well balanced and easy drinking but the hops still dominate."

"This beer pours a light bodied dark gold in color with a white, soapy two finger head. Tense is very balanced. It's a little piney with smooth and slightly sweet amber malts. The nose says that this one will be approachable. The flavors are dry and piny with a moderate hoppiness. There is also a nice level of sweet malt which cancels out any bitterness. I like it. The 8% isn't anywhere to be seen. It drinks light in body and very smooth. It's perfectly built for a can. This was a nice DIPA and is worth trying. It's nothing crazy but solid all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very, very good beer. I thought it was a Double IPA when I was drinking it and was surprised to find out it was just an IPA on BA, so it definitely straddles that fine line between the two styles. Since it is an IPA I would say it was one of the hoppier and more full bodied versions of the style I've had to date. I recommend hop heads trying this one!"
""
"Delicious brew. nice IPA with tons of hops and good supporting malt notes. The hops are equally a balanced between the pine and the citrus. Definitely a CO IPA. (4.0)"
"Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth and easy drinking IPA that is not overpowering a person with hops but with enough yet to keep your whistle wet and want more."
"I reviewed this on youtube/thebrureview"

"D: This was a nice IPA with solid scent and taste and body. The finish wasn't necessarily smooth, but it was clean enough, so the beer was pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable but not quite exceptional."

"O - my favorite of Oskar Blues' hoppy canned offerings. Solid change up from the more tropical/citrusy IPAs I've had lately."
"O: Absolutely a hop bomb, however It feels pretty unbalanced. You shouldn't go looking for an even tasting beer experience with this. Tasty and definitely will have it's following, but not one of the greats."
"Pours almost copper in color, usually a bad sign for IPAs (for me, anyway). Luckily, my fears are proven unfounded. Great pine and grapefruit peel aroma with lots of herbal notes to it as well. Some malt sweetness and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is very heavy on the hop character. Big bitterness all the way through, but really nice pine and herbal hop flavors and a moderate citrus quality. The sweetness is moderate and held in check."

"O: A very flavorful and fairly smooth and balanced ipa. Worth checking out for sure."
"The only drawback is that the four pack of tallboys isn't cheap. I think it would have been ideal if somehow Oskar would drop down the price a bit so I can buy it a bit more often."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink because it has a good balance between the malts and the hops (there bitterness isn’t that strong compared to other beers of this strength) and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Will definitely need to try fresher and possibly revisit my scores here."
"Can: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of floral and bitter hops with light pine notes is quite interesting. Taste is dominated by floral bitter hoppy notes with some light pine notes and clean semi-dry caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation and alcohol is well hidden. Not bad but I was expecting an even bigger hops assault."
"It gets an extra half a point for being in a can - next time I want some big, potent IPA in a can for the river this may well find it's way in to my cooler along side the Dale's Pale, Torpedo, and Brew Free or Die."

"Deviant Dales IPA pours a cloudy copper color, with a nice frothy head. There is a strong hoppy aroma, nothing else: Simple. The taste is simple as well, very hoppy, strong floral notes. A bit harsh, but very enjoyable, and good strong full taste. Overall a simple not fancy IPA, what more can you ask for."
"citrus and pine. Mildly astringent mouth feel which persists."
" The beer pours straw yellow and piss like with a big thick and hay colored head. It’s a little darker and hazy at its center with a slight ambering, but pretty clean looking overall. This beer is probably meant for the can, but it looks pretty nice in a glass too. The head has a thick and long retention at almost three finger widths, and the lacing is long and circular like several mountain ranges running on top of each other on the glass. Its smell is excellent and floral, with good hits of pine and citrus hops on the nose, almost like the lovechild of an orange and a lemon, a very faint light sweet pale malting is found in the back, but overall this is just a really clean and hoppy smell that has me very excited for the taste. Speaking of taste, it does seem to deliver an interesting effect. I get a lot more sweet, almost-caramel malt than I expected. Nice citrus hops tingle with some slight pineyness. It almost tastes like pine sol and cleaning products, but that is not a horrible thing. The beer is very drinkable at eight percent, which is another plus. (It’s almost sessionable!) Drinking from the can you get more metallic flavor, which isn’t too surprising since it is a can… But the flavor melds well with the sweet hops to provide some excellent refreshing bite. This is a great “in the sun beer” and is nicely refreshing with a good kick of alcohol that is excellently masked in the taste. It has little to no carbonation on the tongue, which is a little odd, but it is also rather thick and almost syrupy and viscous on the tongue, which is really strange for an IPA, but definitely not a negative. The hops tingle on the tongue is nice and lightly biting, unlike some IPA’s. There is a lot of cloying on the top of the tongue with sticky goopy saliva that isn’t exactly wet. Saliva also runs on the sides of the tongue wetly though. Overall this is a cool and slightly different take on the IPA that I am totally game for. The thick creamy feel on the tongue and the perfect balance of sweet pale malts and hops work excellently, and the smell of this beer is amazing! Good beer that I would drink again, if not for the $15 pricing. Even with the steep price for 4 tall boys, though, I would consider it again."

"Deviant Dale's has a medium-bodied mouthfeel. The carbonation level is pretty smooth, even considering how active the head is. Overall, this is an above-average IPA. I'm glad that it is in 16oz. cans, but I do think that it is slightly overpriced as well. Either way, you can't go wrong taking a 4-pack of this out with you fishing or to a cookout or etc. It was a fine 4th of July beer for me."
""
"O: Easy drinking in a nice can."
"D/O: Bold but rough, this beer is typical of those offered by Oskar Blues. Flavors give the impression of a great deal of late hop additions to the boil but not so much dry-hopping. While it isn't a spectacular IPA, it does take home the gold for head retention--possibly the best yet encountered. Otherwise, it reminds of Stone's Arrogant Bastard--a lot."
""

"Overall: yeah, pretty solid DIPA and happy to see it in a can. Canned version seems better than draft and this beer was canned on 4/23/12. Enjoying more in the future."

"Mouthfeel is milder then the nose but on par with the taste. The hops pinch but don't dominate and are balanced by a sweet chew of the grains. The carbonation is enough to be present but not really enough to sizzle. This is a good IPA that is nicely canned for those pool days or other outdoor activities. A great find and a tasty beverage, this one is for sure worth checking out."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a healthy three finger light brown head with good retention and great lacing. Looks nice. Great aroma of pineapple and citrus hops, light fruit. A mild hop body supports the complexly flavored dominant hops. Strong pineapple, pine, citrus and other tropical fruit flavors. Creamy body adds to the overall positive impression. This is well integrated and balanced with great aroma and interesting flavors. A great IPA."
"O: Not a bad beer but I think I'd rather have plain ole Dale's Pale Ale instead."
"Really solid. Will look for this again on my next trip north of the border (WI)."

"O: 4/5. Probably couldn't give it any higher, even with more tastings. The jumbled smell and flavor isn't my cup-of-beer. I like hop bombs. I love the citrus IPAs, but this one just kind of jumbles them all together into an above average, not spectacular IPA. Paying $3.50 for a pint can was not worth it, but if I could get it for 7.99 for a six pack like a Sierra Nevada, I would consider buying it again."
"Overall, very well done. Very aggressive with the hops, but balanced well in malt body."
"Overall: Heavily hopped DIPA as it should be. Not too boozy, right amount of malt and bouquet of hop flavors/aromas."
"Overall, this beer is a beast! I wish I had my growler on hand to fill it with this. Might have to pick up a couple tall boy cans of it. It's highly drinkable, but sneaks up on you very fast cuz it's 8% abv and easy to put down fast."
""
""
"Overall - Best beer I've had in a while. A little pricey but the ABV is high. Highly recommend shoplifting if possible. I would call this the Heady Topper Light. Great beer."
""
"O. I very much enjoy this beer. Will purchase again, perhaps a bit fresher next time."
"O: Overall good flavor bitterness with a good malt support. Nice lingering bitterness, and complexity. Only bad thing was the hint of soapiness that occurred in the flavor, not sure if just a bad batch or a common problem. A good solid ipa, but sits on the fence with me overall as a dipa."

"4/3/3/3.5/3"
"Pours a very dark but clear amber red with a decent amount of carbination. Smells very hoppy with some pine in there as well, very nice. Tastes nicely bitter with some citrus and floral hops coming through in the finish. Nice mouthfeel and the 8% alcohol is well hidden. A good ipa over all and I enjoy Oskar Blues beers a lot."

"O- I dunno, I'm not a huge fan of OB...this is just OK"

"Cheers"
"Fuck, this is Dale Squared. Shit. I love it."
"Strong, hoppy aroma has a firm underpinning of sour citrus, equal parts grapefruit and orange. It pours a clear coppery amber with a thick, fluffy and rather persistent ivory head. Flavor is not just hoppy, but downright evergreen with a grapefruit undertone, rather bitter but not fiercely so. Texture has firm body and a good amount of fizz. Pack this one in!"

"For a canned beer this is simply wonderful. It has the typical Oskar Blues Malt=Hops-Yeast taste profile similar to Dales Pale Ale but simply bumped up a few notches in alcohol, malt and hop bitterness. Color is deep gold. Aroma is somewhat earthy. Simply a wonderful beer. I could drink this all day out on the golf course."
"Bitterness is firmly present but not tongue-splitting. A great all-around DIPA. A bit pricy at $14.99 for a 4 pack of tall boys, but certainly worth trying if you haven't."
""
""
"Overall - At first I wasn't crazy about the odd herbal/anise notes in the flavour, but it grew on me as I progressed through my glass. The alcohol was well hidden and although the beer is a tad on the sweet side, it's very drinkable."
"Overall: Deviant Dale’s lives up to the hype. This might be the best widely available IPA I’ve found and I like the tallboy can. I have a feeling a few of these will find their way into my backpack for a few long hikes this summer."

"O - Overall a damn good pint of beer. Surprised to see the rating under 4.0, but then again Dale's Pale is criminally underrated as it is. This is one of my favorite IPAs, unfortunately it is very expensive at $4 a can. Then again that's a lot less than beers like Ruination cost for me, so I'll take it. This beer is up there with a lot of the good DIPAs, such as Hop Stoopid."
"O- This is special. I already love Dale. This is like Dale on Steroids. Never tried Steroids, but maybe I should."
""
""
""
"Overall I was eager to try this and more than happy to consume. For the price I will definitely be paying a buck or two more for Ten Fidy and passing on this. This was decent but nothing more. Still love the regular Dale's better than this naughty one."
""
"Leafy, grassy hop bitterness up front. Becomes more herbal, as fruity, sweetish malt fills in. Slightly boozy. Tropical fruit hop notes near the finish (pineapple, mango). Finish is a little drier, with a healthy dose of resinous, ganja-y hop flavor. Lingering butterscotch. Tongue numbing. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Nice!"

""
"O: Not impressed with this OB BREW, it was very wild tasting for an ipa."
"This is an intensely hoppy beer. It has a very strong citrusy character that is immediately countered with a strong floral, piny, bitter hop finish. The malt is bready, but doesn't last long in the hop blitzkrieg. If you're a hop head, you'll like this."

"Big thanks goes out to pmoney for sending me this one as an extra in a recent glassware trade! Served from can into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. “Let’s sling a little mud, girl” on the lip of the can. Sounds like a line I would use in the bedroom back in college, but I digress… Poured a dark yellow-orange with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, floral, and floral hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, wild onion, floral, and floral hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The flavor on this one was pretty complex and hoppy while still maintaining a nice refreshing aspect. Unfortunately however, the aroma on this one was quite reserved and didn’t jump out at me. I really had to work hard to pick up on the aspects of the things there as it was slightly on the weak side. Another good canned brew from Oskar Blues. Can’t wait to see what they have coming up next."
""
"D - The hop aroma is the standout aspect of this brew, it is pungent and more than capable of standing up to the heavy malt. The flavor is much of the same, but the malt sweetness manages to dominate a little more here and is almost to the point of being cloying towards the end of the can. It reminds me a bit of Hopslam, but with a slightly weaker hop flavor profile."
"This beer pours out an amber color with three fingers of head. The aroma is very hoppy. Lots of pine, grapefruit, and general dankness. There's just the slightest amount of malt behind it. The taste is also very hoppy, with the heavy citrus, grapefruit, and pine flavors instantly assaulting. There's some caramel malts present, but the hops are really the star of the show. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied and well-carbonated, and the drinkablity is very good. Overall, this is an excellent double IPA that provides an excellent hop flavor."
"O - A decent DIPA, but not on the level of some of the top-notch beers for the style. I'd drink again, but there's too many other awesome DIPA's out there to go crazy over this one. Decent."
""
"Pours a mostly clear solid orange w/ red tint and two fingers thick cream colored head that settles to a half inch and leaves a few thick bands of lace along the way. Smell: pineapple and grapefruit rind, caramel and biscuit-ish-ness in the back. Taste: sweetened citrus and leafiness upfront then into spicy, acidic pineapple, sugary medium body eventually drying out in a more-than-a-little-boozy, hop soaked finish. Canned 5/15/2012. Smash Into Forehead instruction disregarded, this time."
""
""
"O: Pretty good drinkability. I like this a lot better than Dale's Pale Ale."
""
"Just as heady topper does as well. Also happy and pleased that they ship quickly and I can get a fresh can less than a month old in NH."
""
"Pours a clear caramel with a thick, foamy, thumb and a half width cream colored head. Nice lacing. A nice aroma mixing some pine, orange rind, and sweet malt. Flavor is a largely a pine resin flowing into some sweet malt combo. A little citrus hides in there too though. Aftertaste is a healthy dose of bitter. A nice creamy, medium bodied. Overall, a nice brew. The malt definitely plays a much stronger role in the can than on the tap and I do believe I liked that. Definitely a very dank beer still, a little too bitter for me to love it, but still one I enjoy."
""
""
"Verdict: This is a solid example of the India Pale Ale from Oskar Blues and a significant improvement from Gubna. The flavors are nice and complex, but approachable and enjoyable for anyone looking for a hop forward beer, but not an out and out hop bomb, I can see this being one of the next big hoppy beers in America, right alongside Sierra Nevada's Torpedo and New Belgium's Ranger IPA."
"Overall this beer is awesome. If the beer was a lighter than 8% and wasn't quite as heavy in the mouth, I'd really be able to give it higher props. But as far as IPA's go, it's a winner!"
""
"A well put together DIPA, but not very cheap. Would buy again if in the right mood"
"D - A solid, but unremarkable DIPA... There is nothing wrong with this beer per se, but there is nothing that really reaches out or grabs you either... Some good hop flavor and a good appearance, but not much more..."

"Ok Stros- I have laid down my worthy offering. Time to produce!"

"O- Just falls short in two most important criteria: smell and taste. Perhaps my lest favorite brew from Oskar Blues to date."
"Um, freaking awesome. Hoppy, not overly bitter. So many flavors. Rivals but doesn't surpass ghandi-bot! Hides it's alcohol pretty well"
""
""
""
"Bright copper orange in color and a bit of chill haze to start but decent clarity overall. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly dissipated but left wet lacings on the glass. Citrus and ripe orange aromas with a hint of sweet malt beneath. Aromas a little lighter than expected for a DIPA. On the lighter side of medium bodies with rich, subdued carbonation. This DIPA was all about the hop flavor smack. Pungent citrus hop flavors overwhelm the taste buds out of the gate. Sweet caramel malt flavors peek through toward the end. Finishes smoothly with a delayed funky pine and citru bitterness."
"This was a very good IPA/DIPA. I enjoyed it much more than Gubna and I'm glad OB is rocking this brew."

"O- Meh, looks ok, smells ok, tastes ok, but it's not for me. It's not a bad beer by any means but it does little to excite me. Did not finish."

"Overall: My goal is when I leave the bar is to pick this up hopefully in a six-pack, it is definitely worth a keeper in your fridge. Absolutely no complaints here, Salud!"
"Oh, yeah, this was gonna be rad! I had just choked down a CAN o' crap and this was just what the doctor ordered. It began with a massive two fingers of tawny head, but I kept refilling the glass as it subsided until I had less than a finger remaining. What I was left with was a glass full of a deep-amber liquid with NE-quality clarity. Nose was simply dank - sticky, grassy, minty, much like my garden. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, so much so that I felt as though I were drinking unsweetened iced tea. Until the kick occurred. Man, this had the punch of a Missouri mule on the finish. I sat back back in my chair, attempting to catch my breath when I heard my long-silent monkey on my back begin to chatter. ""Hops!"" he screeched incessantly and when I CANnot satiate him, he goes berserk. Sweat ran in rivulets down my face. My quivering hand reached again for the glass. Beer slopped over the sides of the glass as I lifted it to my lips. One sip and I was a man again! I dialed up the Old Lady so that she could partake in the action. Who needs Viagra with this beer?!? Actually, who needs Viagra with my Old Lady? At any rate, the finish was breathtaking, very minty, and the sticky lacing was going to need a jackhammer to remove it. Not bad."
""
"Just the kind of DIPA I like - big and balanced. Both the hops and the malts are cranked up high, but they balance each other out well. I like this beer a lot."

""
""

"The big danky onion hops can be a hit or miss, this one for me is definitely a hit. This beer in tallboy cans is a great idea, but like all Oskar Blues, I just wish they weren't so expensive."
""
"Pours a cloudy, copper orange color with a thick foamy head. Scent is hoppy with hints of citrus and some bready tones. This first sip is just pure greatness. It's smooth, crisp, refreshing, and so tasty. The bread and citrus flavors hit my taste buds first as it finish with a crisp dry after taste. Well done Oscar Blues!"
"o- Well rounded and a very fine example of a great DIPA. This would rank with Sculpin, Hop Wollop, and Mahajara, but not quite Pliny or Hopslam."

"High C"
"Overall – A pretty good IPA. It has a nice look, nose, and feel. While the majority of the taste is good, the bitterness left on the tongue at the end is not one I love (although some may enjoy the particular bitter)."
""
""
""
""
"Another one on-tap at the Tasty Weasel. I've never enjoyed the summit-laced Gubna so I'm hoping the hopping in Deviant Dale's is more akin to Dale's Pale Ale. Here we go...pours a bright orange-copper with a dollop of stiff white foam. Yeah it's hoppy, but I'm not getting those bright and juicy pine and citrus notes I was expecting. Instead, it's a punch of dank herbs and grass (I guess it's those Columbus dry hops). Malt is surprisingly substantial with a chewy bready quality. Pungent, resinous hop goodness continues to linger on the palate after the first big gulp. A bit of chive or shallot creeps in as it warms. Reallly good, if I could pick up a pack of tallboys occasionally I would, but there are certainly others in this category that I would go to first."
"Mouthfeel is medium for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer. I really liked the tropical fruit notes to it, but the range of hoppy flavors to it was also nice. Very flavorful and drinkable beer overall. I ended up liking this one a lot more then I thought I would going in."
"The palate opens pretty bitter, nicely so, with pine resins, grapefruit zest and a comparatively lower amount of onion than on the nose. There is a moderate weed-like dankness to the palate as well. Thanks to its youth, this beer doesn't taste too sweet, despite the mild caramel flavor present. Drying and bitter on the finish, this particular aspect is a little disappointing in that it's not really resiny enough, and does feel a little watery at times too. Alcohol is noticeable, but is pleasant. Pretty solid stuff, I'd drink this again with no hesitation."
""
""
""
"O: I love a good ipa and have developed a taste for them the last six months or so. This one was just not my cup of tea. Hops to me were very chemically if that makes sense and I could not get over the pinesol nose and taste. A bit of a let down in my opinion."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer. Better than your average IPA. A mix between an East Coast IPA and a West Coast IPA. Also, not really getting the onion and garlic flavor some suggest. If it's anywhere, then it's long in the aftertaste, but doesn't affect the beer-drinking experience."
""
""
""
"Picked this up while at a conference in Denver. Gorgeous clear copper-amber pour with a huge three finger off-white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is huge and resiny and exactly what an Imperial IPA should smell like. Fresh hops and resin dominate along with hints of pine, tangerines, grapefruit, and caramel, with just a touch of green onion. The taste is in your face bold and mouth-puckering. The fresh, resiny hops are the stars. The grapefruit, orange rind, and pine are given just enough taming by the sweet caramel malt to make this one scary drinkable double. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, and the finish is hugely bitter, but that subtle malt sweetness makes for a perfect ending on one hell of a beer. This absolutely ranks right up there with Pliny, Hopslam, and Dreadnaught. And it's in a can! Well done!"
"Really quite amazing, one of the better DIPAs i've had. Great showcase for Columbus hops."
"O) Glad I got to try this brew. A pretty solid offering, and I'm sure a number of folks here will absolutely love it. It just doesn't do much for me. I find this hop profile more distracting than enjoyable."

"(Overall) Not my ideal DIPA, a bit too spicy and not enough emphasis on the hop character. It's good for what it is, just depends on your personal tastes. 3"
"The flavor is exactly what an IPA should be. The beer starts bitter, earthy and almost creamy. The hops keep on coming with tropical flavors of passion fruit, star fruit, grapefruit and lemon. The finish is both sweet and fruity and the front of the tongue and bitter on the back. Absolutely delicious."
""
"Tall Boy poured into pint glass. The appearance is a crystal clear gold with bone white foamy head. Great retention and terrific lacing. The aroma is hop forwards with lemon, grapefruit, and citrus along with bread, caramel, and a slight hint of onion in the back. The taste starts with a bit more of the onion character that I picked up on the nose with a slightly savory quality. The bitterness is restrained, however, the hops do provide a ton in the way of flavor. there is a sturdy malt backbone that primarily bring grainy bread to the surface. This beer packs a flavorful punch. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy with low carbonation. Overall, this beer has a ton of flavor, but some of the hop character is not what I would call delicious."
""
"As clean as it looks, the mouthfeel is a little grungy and unbalanced. Like I said before the hops strongly overpower the malts and it's a little oily. Reasonably drinkable for a DIPA, Oskar Blues is good for that. Nothing really not too like here, just nothing to really love. Curious to sit on one for a couple months to see how it fairs."
"Its a bit more thin than I expected, I would say a medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Defiantly not a session beer, but very smooth. I really like this, its a good example of an IPA."
""
"Pours a copper tinted amber color, big plume of off white head, good sticky lacing. First note in the nose was grassy and piney hops, quite malty with bread notes, light toast, light caramel. Taste a little more hoppy than nose had me believe, mostly piney and grassy, light floral and orange rind, malt backbone firm and lightly sweet, light caramel and bread, faint toast, notable yeast presence. Medium bodied, slightly bubbly for style. Average dIPA with some good and bad points."
"Pours a hazy copper-orange with a fluffy off-white head that settles to a squat cap. Getting lots of resinous hop aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, peach, and tree sap. Very tropical and delicious, and it certainly lives up to it's ""Deviant"" reputation. The taste is a bit of a letdown from the nose, however. The caramel malt profile is just a touch too big for my liking, and hides all that fresh hop goodness a bit too much. I'm all about balance (sometimes), but this doesn't come across nearly as hoppy as it should. The hops I do get are delicious, with more peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. Mouthfeel is smooth and more then a bit sticky, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a solid DIPA with an amazing presentation, but it didn't quite live up to my hopes."
"Overall: A good, solid DIPA. The tallboys make it all the more enjoyable. Recommended for people that enjoy dank, oniony hop profiles."
""
""
"O: An excellent (double?) IPA. A bit resiny at time, but the pleasant fruit character of the beer helps ameliorate any negative effects. Recommended. Would and will drink again."
""
"Overall: A very unique and very intense IPA, not for the faint hearted. Anyone who is looking for a hoppy beer that is different from the classic west coast or east coast styles, give this a shot, the hop character is far from traditional. Oskar blues deserves some credit for making such a unique ale in such a popular style. As good as the style gets in my opinion."
"O- Over I enjoyed this brew very much. This is my first beer from Oskar Blues and I look forward to trying Dale's and Ten Fidy."
"O: May be a new top 10 beer overall. Amazing."

""
""
"O- I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be an Imperial version of Dale's Pale Ale. Now, it's been a while since I've had Dale's Pale, but, to me, they do not even resemble each other. Not necessarily bad, just sayin'. Either way, I honestly did not like this beer as much as I thought I was going to. Will definitely buy again to split with friends to see if they pick up on the same garlicky type hops. For me, once that came into play, it seemed to dominate anything else that tried to step to it."
"This is medium bodied but drinks really well; this is refreshing. I am loving this one!"
"O: A solid DIPA, the price is actually very good in comparison to what is out there. Citrus rind for days, if you like that, you'll love this beer. For me, it's not my favourite hop profile, but it's certainly another enjoyable effort from Oskar Blues. It's a beer that grew on me quite a bit as I finished the pint."
""
""
"Pleasant, but far from elite. The onion is kept in check, but still not overly pleasant and the malt backbone is a little too big for my taste."
""
"Not a bad IIPA, but it comes across very ponderous. Could use a sense of lightness. I'll stick with Dale's Pale Ale."
""
""
"Pours beautifully, rich and thick head, copper with a haze. Fades somewhat over time leaving less lace than one would expect. The alcohol profile surprises me. Not the booziness of some IIPAs you'd expect, but definitely present up front and in the finish, and in the aroma. Piney bitterness leaning toward the dry side. A bit of back of the throat harshness at the finish. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body."
""
""
"O - Decent offering from Oscar Blues. Definitely not my favorite and definitely not my least favorite. I think they could have done a little bitter with this recipe but all in all not bad in the highly competitive IIPA category."
""
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a beige color with a 1 inch head. Smell is citrus and very hoppy. Taste is hops up front, very bitter, citrus kicking in later, more bitterness, alcohol is well hidden. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall should satisfy any hop head."
""
""
""
""
""
"Like cilantro, Summit hops seem to be a love-it-or-hate-it thing, but Deviant Dale's is multifaceted enough to pull it off nicely."
""
"I liked this one. Nothing shocking, but good on all fronts. A drinkable, fresh, and approachable IPA. The booze puts this one at an almost DIPA level. Not my fav but I'll certainly purchase again."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbobation. A nice ipa here that isnt holding back on the hoppiness. The bitterness is quite one-sided keeping this from being balanced in a way id prefer but overall this is solid. The alcohol is quite bold if you want to be picky. If you havent had this yet, you need to give it a go."

"O - good beer. I wish it was drier but still ridiculously drinkable."
"Enormous flavor and arresting hoppiness. Oskar Blues nailed it down. 4.5"

""
""
""
""
"O: While I did enjoy this beer, I must admit that, as a fan of Dale's and Oskar Blues in general, I was a bit disappointed. This beer goes past being hop forward - it's practically just hop water. I got zilch from the malt, which a beer with this kind of hop presence really needs. While I will certainly give this another try in the near future, I believe I will be sticking with Dale's (the standard one)."
""
"Poured from the can a deep rich copper color with a large fluffy off white head atop into an imperial nonic.Sharp grassy and piney hops in the nose,alot like Gubna,I actually picked up some sweet onion in there like the Gubna.Herbal and big grassy hops over top of a toffee based malt base,the hops are the main component but again it reminds me too much of GUBNA wich is not a really bad thing.Love the looks love the hop profile,it's a really good beer but it is alot like the GUBNA,whatever it is it's a really good DIPA."
"O - a good example of the style."
"I guess I am one of those unfortunate drinkers that this hop variety does not appeal to. It is nicely crafted and has some very good aspects, but to this drinker it is not particularly easy drinking."

"O: It's hard for me to remain neutral, as ""Dale's"" is one of my favorite, all-occasion, go-to beers. This is a great way to take it: similar to Dale's but with some serious DIPA characteristics that makes it compete. An overall good beer, that's definitely worth a look-see."

"A very solid beer here. It reminds me of a higher octane Furious. It's just not as drinkable with how warm it feels. Overall, very well done."
"Pours a pretty deep amber color with a very strong head with thick lacing. Smell is a fresh, crisp hoppy aroma that doesn't impress really. Actually the standard smell is a good thing, right in line with what I expect from an IPA. Not too much malt. Taste is extremely straightforward: hops. These hops are crisp and refined, very precisely calculated in my opinion. Mouthfeel is fine. Overall a great IPA."

"O - Delightful and delicious. Taste is beyond this world. Wish the mouthfeel was closer to medium bodied so I could drink more without feeling weighed down. You've gotta check this beer out."

"A very respectable IIPA. A little one-dimensional in the malt department, but great overall work on the hops. Hides the relatively high ABV pretty well. Wouldn't quite use this as a session brew, but I wouldn't turn down knockin' a couple back at any one time..."

"D: another good hoppy brew from the folks over at oskar blues. kinda wish i bought all four in the pack instead of just a single, but that was a lesson learned the hard way. nice to have all this flavor without the walloping ABV."
"Poured from a can into a nonic pint. Dark-straw colored, minimal head. The smell is of citrus hops. The floral qualities are not there on the taste; just some good hop bitterness and a solid malt backbone. A good beer to enjoy on a humid mid-Atlantic evening, with spicy food."

"Cost: $3.99 for a 16 oz can or $12 for a four pack."

"Reddish in body with giant white head that sits on top. Aroma of hop resin, citrus juice, wet grass, and some caramel nuttiness. Strong flavors of wet grass, slick hop bitterness, nuttiness, hop spice, some booze, and deep citrus with rind. Heavy in body with medium carbonation. A heavy hitter that's big and tasty."
""
"Pours an orange color with small white head. Nose is fruits and hops. Oranges, grapefruit and earthy notes. Taste is similar to the nose. Fruits and pine up front with a hop finish. Decent tasting brew. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this was decent. Nothing spectacular."
"Overall this was a nicely done DIPA. Good amounts of sweetness with a very hop-forward profile."
""
""
""
"This amazing dry hopped version of Dales Pale Ale really brings out the aroma and taste of the hops. Its aroma has scents of bitter orange and citrus and the taste has a powerful astringent sensation of pine reason with a bitter hoppy finish. They took a great beer, and made it even better. This is now in my top 5 favorite beers. I first had it on-tap in Lyons, but now they sell it in the can too."
""
""

"Tasty, complex, a sipper. Decent, but lack of drinkability loses it some points."

"T: Definitely a sweeter IPA. Lots of sweet citrus hops and some caramel malts. A touch of resin on the finish. Not bad at all."
""
""
"O: It's a good beer and bordering on very good. Drinkable for 8%. But at the price point for a 16oz can? Don't know if I'll grab this one again."
"Overall this is an above average DIPA, but given the price point and tall boy format (which i loathe) it is not one I will be returning to. It's not nearly as awful as Gubna, but it doesn't come close to touching their pils or Ten Fidy in terms of making great examples of the style."
""
"Overall, Extra IPAs or IPAs are one of my favorites, but like a Jimmy Rollins at-bat it is a frustrating style to enjoy (Phils fans will understand what I mean). If I had to sum it up, Hop Wallop is perfect example of what Deviant Dale's SHOULD have aimed for."
""
"The taste was not what I hoped for based on the aroma. The first thing that hit me was diesel fuel. Very malty balanced with funky hops. Very flavorful, but not really great tasting. Medium bodied. Finishes semi-dry. I really enjoyed regular Dale's Pale Ale but this one is not high on my list."
"i enjoyed this a lot, really nothing like dales pale ale, but this has a nice range of many different hop flavors, lots of dank. reminds me a bit of nugget nectar."

"This is my first Oskar Blues offering and I'm happy I got it even though I paid an arm for it at $5 for a can in Philly. I can't get it where I am so I'm ok with it. Definitely lots of what I like, lots of fruity aromas and flavors. Its rich because of the mouth-feel but a nice drink."

"M/O - Medium body that has the right viscosity for the style. Maybe slightly under-carbed but that allows a lot of the alpha acids to come through more making the beer much more ripe. Aftertaste lasts a little while but doesn't stick to the palate. ABV is just right and makes it easy to drink. Very enjoyable."
"O-An above-average IPA for those who prefer citrus notes and low carbonation."
""
""
""
"Drink- Only qualm I have is drinking this too quickly. Needs to be cold because allowed to warm it breaks down a bit and loses something in the feel and aroma"
"I might not want to plunk down $14-16 for a four pack but I think I'd be happy to pick up a single from time to time. A tasty and satisfying dose of hops."
""
""
""
"The Deviant was a very pleasant surprise. If anyone has had Gandhi Bot and got blown away by how much better it is than Sea Hag, you get the picture. Highly recommend this for the Hophead, although the ABV is up there I would say I could be happy having a bit of a session with this."
""
""
"VERY GOOD, GIVE IT A GO!"
""
"The hop profile of this beer is nothing short of entertaining. There are so many things going on here. While I do not particularly love some of these aspects, I think it's interesting. It's worth a try, but it's not a top-tier DIPA. Too much competition..."
"Slightly pricey, but a great DPA/IPA. Lots of delicious flavors and pretty easy drinking for the ABV. I had a can of this while walking around the San Francisco Zoo, and it was perfect."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Its a good DIPA, resiny, and sweet with good body and bitterness. A bit tougher to drink for me than the Palate Wrecker I had last night."
"Overall, a good but not amazing beer. I'll see what some age on the other three cans does for this beer."
""
"O: Amazingly great smell and taste to this beer with a wonderful complexity. I really enjoyed this beer but it is more of a sipping beer than a session beer. The hops are intense but I really like it."
"O: a pretty big beer that fits the bill for everything you’d expect out of an IPA... and more; not the most drinkable of ales (in terms of volume) but real tasty and fulfilling; the 16oz can is the perfect, one sitting amount."
""
""
"From a 16 ounce can....pours a nice clear amber with a thick white head that sticks around. Little if any sediment whatsoever. The lacing is pretty phenomenal. Both citrus and floral hops dominate the nose. The taste is nothing unique, a typical IPA, but a very clean one and well balanced. There's a solid malt backbone with notes of grapefruit and caramel. Solid brew."
""
"Overall. A big dipa for sure."
"O - An impressive, well rounded double IPA from Oskar Blues. Waves of huge, resinous hops in every sip. Immensely pleasurable and drinkable. I don't know what else to say, this is just an incredible beer."
""
""
"O: Another great DIPA in cans, very enjoyable and very hoppy. Not much else to say here other than this is great stuff."
"O: A good IPA with some notable shortcomings, first off a lack of crispness, second a slightly thin flavor profile. If you are someone who enjoys the bright, sweet, citrusy IPAs, this probably isn't the one for you. Very grassy and herbal with definite traces of onion, though not over the top. Glad to have tried it, but I'd probably reach for a more drinkable IPA before ticking this one again."
"overall - great to have such a killer IPA in a tallboy"
"16oz Tallboy canned on 04-09-12 ""Your Hoptometrist."" Pours a semi translucent reddish amber color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of pine, tropical fruits, resin, and onions. Flavor is piney and resinous hops with some onion. Decent amount of malt flavor. Piney, resinous hop finish. Maybe a bit floral. Nice balance of bitterness and malts. This beer was limited to 1 can per customer. Its not worth that sort of trouble but it is a good Imperial Ipa. Certainly tastes like a combination of Dale's Pale Ale and Gubna. Worth having again."
"O- Overall, Deviant Dale's is a really solid IPA. Glad to try another solid brew from Oskar Blues."
"The pour develops into a beautiful pour crowned by a thick tan head. The head gives way to rings of lace telling you just what a special beer this is. The hop oils and tannins can be seen with each tilt of the glass. The mouthfeel is satifying and leads into an aftertaste that lingers well, as long as you like hops. This is definitely a beer for the hophead community but a nice place to visit for the rest of the beer community."
"This is definately a good beer. It is outside of what I would normally consider a very good IIPA, but they really pull this together nicely. Certainly worth a try at least once, but probably more..."
"Having sampled this a few times since, I can say that I've grown a bit more fond of Deviant Dale's. I think my hopes were too high, and that what I wanted this beer to be vs. what it actually is affected my score. Therefore I'm bumping it a bit, and hoping that with time, Oskar Blues may tweek this a bit, and turn it into what could be a mighty fine double hop bomb."
""
"O-A solid DIPA, I didn't get as much bitterness as I'd hoped though."
""
"Highly recommended for extreme hop heads."
""
""
""
""
"A good DIPA, maybe even a great one. Something lacking though... I think it needs to be dryer, and perhaps some more umph to the fruit flavors (they help, but they're also a little afterthought-y). Will buy again though if this becomes year round or more available."
"A decent DIPA but nothing new. The hops were not as bold and flavorful as a beer like this deserves. Stil, a tasty brew nevertheless!"
"A pretty good beer but not my favorite type of IPA. Nice pour with a inviting dark amber color with a nice off white head. Smell was pretty malty and dark with less hops than I was expecting. Taste had a musty malty flavor that was a bit off putting before the hops kicked in and saved the day, but still a bit too much malt for my taste. mouthfeel was thick and not too inviting. Overall a decent IPA but not one I'd rush out to get again."
""
""
""
""
"O: More of an Imperial Red than an 1.5 IPA or whatever you want to consider it. Hop flavors are big, but the lot of maltiness and spice too. Would prefer slightly bigger hop flavors/extraction, but it is well balanced, not a DIPA hop fix though. More for beer drinkers, not hop heads. Worth trying, a bit overpriced IMO."
"Overall (4.0): Fours across the board, man. This is a solid DIPA that doesn’t necessarily bring anything new to the field but doesn’t disappoint in anyway, also. The only thing I will say is that if you are sensitive to vegetal / onion-garlic notes in your hop profile, this beer may not be for you. Still, a very solid brew, though it could be a little less expensive. Ah well, c’est la vie, right? Glad to have tried."

"Awesome IPA, very smooth but hits a little hard. At 8% it is closer to an imperial. This will be a staple for me."
""
"This is a great IPA. If you like Dales Pale Ale – you have to try this one."
""
"Overall: The beer possesses an admirable aroma but I found the flavor not only lacking, but also somewhat unpleasant. Think of brushing your teeth and then drinking a glass of orange juice."
""
""
"O I love me a sweet DIPA, but this is overboard, the sweetness is almost sugary, not much malt flavor, not good bitterness to balance things out"
"O: Rather unique DIPA utilizing grapefruit and pine with undercurrents of toffee. Big, assertive and highly bitter. It's like a mix between Gubna and Gordon (G'Knight) with the consistency of Ten Fidy. It's very loud and boisterous. I'd much rather prefer a classier DIPA."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA, though it should be noted again that the strength of the hops is not going to appeal to the novice, or perhaps even the intermediate drinker. It also says much that the hops are strong enough that, when the beer is consumed on an empty stomach, they can induce a slight belly burn, much like a liquor."
""
""
"Overall, a very nice IPA. I've heard it described as a mix of Dale's and Gubna. It's definitely not as over the top Summit as Gubna."
"Feel is a bold medium with a slight syrupy feel. Reminds me of a lighter version of the sixpoint resin, yet Dales is smoother. It gets sweeter as time goes on, so drink it up quick. I like this, but i like regular dales better. Hopefully a fresher batch hits the market and I get tho try it again."

"Poured from a tallboy can into a Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a brilliant, transparent amber with a 2-3 finger foam crown at the top. Nose is on the malty and piney side of the spectrum. The hops aren't very apparent, neither is any kind of prominent citrus. The taste is largely an extension of the nose. The malt profile is pretty dominant once more, with the hops fighting to survive. Pine finally shines through in what is a continued absence of any citrus or noteworthy hop profile. The mouthfeel has a lot of malt, caramel and some sweetness to it. The 8% ABV is a bit noticeable and provides some decent bite. Overall, this is a decent beer. I'd have it again, but I wouldn't seek it out by any means, and can think of several IPA/DIPA's that I would choose off a draft list prior to this one."
""
""
""
"overall - easy drinking, very tasty. hard to put down."
""
"D/O: Highly drinkable, and overall very enjoyable. My only (minor) criticism might be that as I worked my way through this 16-ounce can, the sweetness wore on me just a touch. That said, I'd gladly crack a 2nd can open immediately after polishing this one off."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky, dry and lingering on the tongue. This is pretty tasty, although the flavors can be a bit extreme at points. I can see where people are getting the ""onion"" or ""garlic"" notions, but I don't really agree that it's the entire profile."
""
"Very good, but not one of my favs from them. Served at a good temperature with a large, foamy, light tan to cream colored head that slowly settles and plenty of lace. Color is a clear orange honey ambewith a few bubble trails. Aroma is hops, malt, used leather, musty, and musky. Flavor's much like nose with hop bitterness really standing out, a little malt sweetness, some carbonic tang. Body is good and full but the bitterness makes it a bit rough, carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor and body and lasts a long time. Nice to try, but for me, one and done."
"If you like your DIPAs in more of the bold style, with lots of sharp bitterness, pine, and spiciness, then you’ll probably like this one. Personally, it really isn’t my thing (especially when the alcohol really amps things up like it does here) but I will say that things did start to balance and smooth out more as I neared the end of the glass and the freshness did help carry this through to the end for me. This wasn’t really quite what I was expecting out of this beer but I can respect it for what it is."
"Real nice taste, goes down easy (almost too easy), hides the ABV and most definitely worth trying out – another winner from Oskar Blues. Says IPA on the can, listed as a DIPA on BA, whatever…it’s a damn tasty beer so go drink one."
"music: HumanMeshDance - thesecretnumbertwelve"
"O - This is a solid DIPA. Again, I had hoptimum earlier today, and that was FANTASTIC. This beer held its own against it, but in the end I think hoptimum is the victor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty solid beer. It is definitely better than the onionfest Gubna is for my palate."
""
"Pours a deep copper color, soapy head leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma of pine, herbs, citrus and tropical fruit. In the taste, very citrusy, with some pineapple and citrus flavors working well together. Alcohol has a presence but not too overbearing. Malt body gives off a caramel and toffee like flavor. Still, very hoppy like most double ipas, I can see why this won a medal (gold?) at the GABF this year. Very solid IPA with great flavor."
"Dales pale pours with some nice head with some good retention over a clouded golden beer. There is some sticky yet sparse lacing on the glass. Aroma is nicely tropical, mildly sweet, with some nice grapefruit. Not aggressively bitter, but lots of tropical and grapefruit rind. A bit on the sweet side for me, more of a fruity sweetness than a caramel sweetness, but definitely very nice and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is nice, a bit undercarbonated for my liking though."
"Love Oskar Blues' stuff, got a chance to try this one at a new, local bar in Baltimore as part of their 2 for $6 happy hour.. can't beat that. Great hoppy aroma, nice appearance in the glass with a fluffy, white head. Taste is definitely hop heavy, maybe a bit too much. If you like bitterness and in-your-face summit hops, this is the beer for you. Luckily, I do enjoy this and this beer was very drinkable and smooth, although a bit more balance would have made this a good beer to an excellent beer. Worthy of a try for sure."
"Overall kind of on the fence with this one. It was a good beer worth at least an above average score but for the price I can think of way better DIPA's despite of them not being in a pounder can."
""
""
"O- Good tasting IPA, big summit hops all over, sometimes over veggie. Not a bad choice, but a bad price however, expensive ticket for the trip."
"The flavor delivers on the aroma's promise of pungent hops and tropical notes, but adds a hefty dose of resinous bitterness to the back-end. Booze is evident, sticky and sharp on the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and a little heavy with some syrupy traits. Spot-on carbonation level, though. Overall, Deviant is a tasty IIPA from Oskar Blues. Not exactly the most drinkable example of the style, but it's still very good."
"O: Good stuff. I wouldn't call it a world class DIPA, but it's solid."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly gritty, slightly thick, quite pleasant. Overall, I'm quite happy with this beer."
"The flavor matches the smell, but with more astringent bitterness. Full bodied with an adequate level of carbonation. The hop bitterness is strong enough to cover the 8% abv."
""
"For a supposed hop-bomb, the beer was had a nicely balanced body, even and relatively smooth, with a nice flavorful finish that lingered just enough. Drinkability was very good for a big, hoppy beer, I could see having a couple. Overall, a pretty good beer, very nice but still, I think G'Knight is still my favorite OB brew. My biggest complaint with DD was the 16oz can. I much prefer the 12oz cans, I think it's a better serving size. Plus, I can hide a 12oz in my hand and use for a ""walk-around"" beer, which I can't with the tall boy. That aside, this beer is most certainly worth your time."
""
"Immediately upon popping this one open, I got a huge whiff of oily hops. The flavor profile carries much of the same character with a steady hop tone to it that leans towards earthy with some woody kind of tones (in a stick and twig kind of way, not a barrel one). It's good and nice enough, but it just doesn't do it for me, really. I can think of many other double IPAs that interest me more than this one."
""
""
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass, bottled on 3-30-12 (fresh and looks good, I can't wait). This pours a massive tan head small packed bubbles which has good retention and leaves a thick lacing, the color is a golden brown. The smell is full of pine and grapefruit hops, a little caramel. The feel is medium with a mouth coating resin. The taste is pretty good, more caramel that I was expecting, decent load of hops, a little grapefruit, a touch of onion(?)."
""
""
""
"Based on my two experiences with this relatively new brew, I think it's a fine worthy IPA. I'll give it some time. Perhaps this one will grow on me as much as the other OB's offerings."
""
"O- a good DIPA I will come back to. I was just hoping for a hopfest without the caramel flavor"
"o: good DIPA, definitely worthy of a camping trip since its in a can. A little disappointing with the lacing but just a small gripe. I would surely revisit this someday."
"O - A good DIPA but not in the upper echelon."
"Obviously very hoppy with loads of raw hop cone goodness. Works for me, but I'm glad I bought just the single as it does wear the palate down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, some serious dank hops on the nose (Columbus?). Taste follows through with grassy, funky hops galore. Does not seem like 8% at all. Very, very dry, which is unusual for DIPAs these days-- this is no hoppy barleywine. Pretty great stuff-- a nice take on the DIPA from Oskar Blues."
""
"Poured from a tall boy into a true pint, the beer is a ruby-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, yellowish head on the start that quickly settles into a half inch of bubbly foam. Aromas of wet, resiny, fresh hops throughout the nose, with cedar and subtle caramel highlights. Flavors are resiny and bitter hops on the forward tongue, with a subtle tart and tangy citrus blending that is slightly outbalanced. Roasting to the caramel, but any malt profile is quickly swallowed up by the hops presence. Very rich and resiny, this transitions to a bitter and slightly astringent hops aftertaste. The finish is slick and drying. Solid beer for the hop heads of the world. Very tasty."
""
"Overall, a nice imperial IPA. Very easy drinking. Sweet and toasted characteristics in the malt meet a bitter hop bite, alongside, some spicy yeast flavors makes this a worthy brew. The appearance might be one of the best aspects of this beer, with its copper color body, off white head and gorgeous lacing. This brew is probably more of a gem on tap than in a can."
""
""
""
"O - I won't be buying this again. It's not bad, but the price (at least at my local bottle shop) is too high for a beer I consider to be average/slightly above average. Just not my style of DIPA, but I would still recommend trying it once to see if you enjoy it."
""
""
""
"A very good DIPA and definitely worth a try. Highly, highly recommended."
""
""
"O: ""Deviant"" is a great descriptor of the hop profile on this beer. This stuff is just dirty."
"O: Very nice looking. Good aroma. More malt flavor up front than expected from the nose. Well crafted. Somewhat puzzling and upside-down compared to most contemporary IPAs and Imp. IPAs, in my experience -- interesting. Very rich and easy to drink."
""
"O: I like it. Very pleasant and enjoyable. Everything comes together great in this. I would gauge this as somewhere between a regular IPA and double IPA... Plenty of hoppy goodness double or not."
""
"Overall-Had I not had the one can that deviated I would provide a higher overall rating. With the price of this at $13.99/4 pack it is pretty well-priced. Also, as far as NYS there aren't alot of other above-average IPAs available in cans that are available in my local bottle shops."
""
"I wish there was a value section, as within two days I paid $16 for a 4pk here and $10 for a 4pk of Hoptimum. Deviant Dale's is great, but I am hesitant to return at this price point. A great beer with a solid price limitation to less well-off beer geeks."
"O- This is right at my limit for bitter hops. Like it. ABV creeps up on ya."
""
""
"O: This is definitely targeted at hopheads, but the lingering bitterness is complimented well by the malt backbone that didn't show itself in the aroma, making it somewhat drinkable."
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice for the style, nice hop and malt balance, decent bitterness, juicy, drinkable with a slight booze warmth and malt base. Especially in a tall boy can."
"Overall, I had higher hopes for this. I dig my citrus bombs and this is not that. A decent double from Oscar's, but nothing special."
"This is a pretty good beer. If you come across it, then pick it up. I would say that it is a little unlike the other doubles out there."
""
""
"Solid beer, I'm glad its going to be a regular addition to their already solid line-up."
"O: very refreshing with the bitterness and mouthfeel. I like it, but don't love it. There are plenty better IPAs to grab over this, but the canning is cool. For a double, Oskar Blues has better balanced IPAs."
"This beer is full of flavor with hops dominating. There's enough sweetness to keep the hops in check. Fairly easy drinking, but savoring each sip is the way to go."
"One sentence summary: this beer is what Gubna should have been. This is a much more enjoyable beer and not a complete onion bomb."
"O- This is an above average DIPA. However at $4.59 a can, I am one and done. There are lots of DIPAs at a much better price point."
""
""
"O: Not to shabby but the oniony taste really gets to me and diminishes my ability to finish the tall boy can"
"Decent little beer. Can says this is an American Style IPA, but it’s a DPA all the way. Big, bold and brash. That’s what they wanted and they got it. Worth a try."
"O- good beer definitely a funky one."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. Maybe a little too heavy on the hops - never thought I'd say that by the way."
""
""
"I am so happy. Hoptimum AND deviant in their fridge, life is good. 16 oz can! Poured a beautiful orange copper color with a one inch head. Lacing is very fine, highly detailed. Aroma is a sharp citrus and pine hop blast. Theres a bit of the GUBNA onion hops that gross me out. Thankfully just a hint. Flavor is hop juiciness. This is pleasantly VERY bitter, but the malt helps. Slight yeastiness that bready IPAS have. Alcohol isn't amazingly hidden here. Feel is oily with good carbonation. There is a lot going on here, tasty."
"Overall: This is a really interesting beer. It's price point puts it out of my reach as a regular stay in my fridge but I'll definitely search it out again. The more I get into the glass the more I'm enjoying it. It would possibly be a bit better if the flavors melded together more but as it stands it's similar to eating a casserole an ingredient at a time."
"D - Wonderful aroma. Not big fan of overly sweet or bitter ipa's. I think this would be phenomenal if the bitterness was toned down just a bit to not take away from the wonderful resiny hop flavors. Thought this might be a scaled up Dale's but doesn't taste anything like Dale's."
"Beer does not live up to the aroma, it is a little grassy and vegetal, oddly bitter and not very enjoyable. Not a repeat."
""
"Overall, this exceeded my expectations. A very good DIPA. I would have a tough time picking this or Torpedo."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very solid IPA. Looks and smells great with a very complex hop profile in the aroma. It isn’t as much of a hop-bomb as I expected it to be taste-wise, but still very good. It has a nice, very bitter finish and it hides the 8% ABV extremely well. Definitely a beer that I’d come back to."
""
"O: All in all, after smelling this one, I was thinking it would go the way of Heady Topper, but no luck. The smell is way better than the taste. Not that it's a bad beer, but just not a great beer. Good to try if you like a really sharp hop bite."
""
"Poured sixteen oz can into a 13 oz tulip, canned on March 22. Pours a clear reddish orange, with a one inch sticky white head with lots of lacing. Smell is pineapple, tangerine, hints of garlic, pine, and grapefruit. Taste is large tangerine, pine, garlic, and grapefruit, smooth in the beginning, with bitterness in the finish. Body medium large, with plenty of life, not overly dry, and very drinkable. This is a great beer, like its little brother."
"o - Overall a pretty good beer. Very nice hoppy nose, though the taste is't as great. I think I prefer this to Gubna, but prefer Dale's Pale Ale to them both. Worth checking out though and would have it again."
""
"Would like to revisit on a first beer of night review for more exact tastes and more distinct smells but enjoyed thoroughly as first ipa of night!"
""
""
"$8 for the pint, which I didn't think was bad at all. Very, very good beer. Best Oskar Blues beer I've had. Just so many hops, but the cask lenses a nice balance. I recommend you track this down. 4.5"
""
""
""
"Thank you, Oskar Blues! This is my favorite IPA!"
"O: Great hop forward brew, pretty straight forward, could stand to be a little smoother"
""
"Pours a dark golden orange with a retentive fluffy white head; ample lacing. Very nice aroma with strong punch of citrus and tropical fruit hops, very fresh and juicy with minimal malt presence. Flavor falls on its face with an overly bitter body, boozy finish and strong malt backbone. Blech. Well carbonated, medium body with a hot finish. Started off well from the nose, but fell apart quickly."
""
""
""
"The nose was really nice, but the rest of the beer was ""just"" pretty good."
"O - I don't think I've ever used ""resinous"" in a review like I have with this one. It's assertive, bold, and is definitely brewed with the hop heads in mind."
"O - This beer finally reached my area today and I wasted no time picking up a fresh tall boy. I was impressed by the complex hop profile. Although the hops and bitterness dominate the flavor, there are some tropicals and malt in there to give it just enough sweetness to keep it from being overwhelming. I really enjoyed this beer and I will probably get it again, but at over $4/can at my local shop, I won't get it too often."
"Overall: Unique to say the least. The hop profile is definitely an acquired taste, and didn't really work for me in the long run. Well-crafted and surprisingly well balanced."
""
"O: A- from me on this one. I really enjoyed it."
""
"Pours a slightly opaque bright orange gold with 1 finger of of white head. The aroma is uniquely hoppy. There is some bright citrus up front (poured from fridge at 38F) with a little bit of ""dankness"" behind the citrus. As the beer warms the dankness combines with the malt to turn into a caramelized onion flavor, very unique, I don't think I have ever got this from a beer before. As the beer warms to room temperature I get a strong oniony aroma that isn't as pleasant as it was when cold. The taste follows the same progression of the aroma. The mouthfeel is very good, dry and drinkable. Overall, this is a very unique IPA, I like the dankness but as the beer warmed it got a bit too oniony for me, still good though."
""
""
"Notes: Sure enough, this is for the hoppy palate, and it has a sturdy malty structure over the unforgiving resinous sense. I may prefer their Gordon, maybe even their Gubna on occasion. But this Columbus dry-hopping is quite solid. And in any event, for such a compact straight offering I feel it works, at least better than other recent similar offerings in pretense, and this is a real tall boy. So…"
""
""
"O - I think I like G'night a bit better, but this is really good."
"Overall another drinkable and enjoyable double IPA. I would prefer Gubna or G'Knight though. I like the tall cans and this beer smelled amazing."
"O: This is a good example of a DIPA: Big, bold, robust, and flavorful. Very much drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid IIPA that I will definitely it up again. Really like the fact that it comes in tall boy cans."
""
""
"M: Rich and big, perhaps a little too big. The double hopping keeps the bite at the forefront - a good beer for a hophead."
""
"O - This well-sealed growler was poured 40 minutes ago. Tastes the same as it did on-tap. This is a very enjoyable and bold tasting brew. If you don't like the onion/garlic taste, this may not grab you."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small hop but a bit lacking. In the taste, mellow hops and a small hop presence. A small alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small citrus and alcohol like aftertaste. Actually kind of lame, small hps and more boozy, eh!"
""
"What a beer to stumble into trying at 1015 am!"
"Overall one of the best IPA's I've had in a while."
""
""
"Great brew. In a tall-boy to boot! Highly flavored and very drinkable. A very worthy brew."
"Light orange and pretty clear with a small white head. The smell is certainly the best aspect of the beer. Dank hops and resin. Really nice. The taste is quite good, though it does not match the aroma. Overall, pretty good. Would definitely have again."
"O - Ok, another ridicoulous beer from Stone. Love it!"
""
"The beer pours an orange-copper color with a medium-sized white head. The aroma is full of resinous pine with a little bit of orange citrus and a little bit of bread mixed in. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of dank resinous notes, as well as some orange and some strong pine notes. There is a little bit of bread and toffee, but this one is all about the hops. Medium bitterness. Medium to full mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

""
"Update: I drank one of these right around the three month mark, and it was a completely different beer. That sweet onion taste that many people note is definitely there. I found it a bit off-putting. My opinion of this beer dropped significantly the second time I had it. It's still very good, but I rescind my proclamation of its superiority to Heady Topper. Make sure to get this one as fresh as possible."

"Overall this is a good IPA. It really is like an upped version of Dale's."

"O: Liked it, but didn't love it. Was hoping for much more citrus character, the vegetal/dankness just isn't really my favorite."

"Overall: this is a tasty DIPA that I would gladly drink again. Perhaps not 100% original in concept, but well executed and flavorful."
""
"Overall: another tasty though not outstanding dipa."
"just poured from a 16 fluid ounce can... into a traditional guinness style pint glass... a nice head is obtained by vigorously pouring the last 3rd of the can...decent lacing with lots of citrus and grapefruit in the nose... the taste is eveything you would yearn for in an IPA and more.... leaving your mouth just dry enough to crave more of this deviant, deviant ale.... at this point the only thing the finish is telling me is to open another can.... WOW!!! all this and not to mention from a CAN! this has certaninly changed my opinions on cans...Enjoy.."
"Poured from a can dated 2/22/12. Poured into Burnt Hickory Brewery sorta pint glass. Nice frothy off white head, orange amber color. Solid chunky lacing The smell is a delicious combination of grapefruit and pungent dank hops. Mouthfeel is medium body, taste is a hop explosion with equal parts dank pine and grapefruity citrus with solid malty munich backbone, virtually nonexistant caramel, just the way I like it. After the Kern Just Outstanding and Alpine Nelson, this is the best IPA I've tried this month. Highly recommended."
"O-very average. I would take a Dale's pale ale any day over this. I didn't enjoy the flavor of this one alot. Not very bitter, and had more of a hop/malt flavor that wasn't that pleasant."
""
"O: Holy sour bitch face. This one sour Payton Manning trading bomb down field. It puts Ruination to shame here. Only Only Only for DIPA hop monster lovers! Anyone else would hate it. YUM YUM YUM"

"16 oz can from Bottleworks in San Diego. Dated 02/24/12 on the bottom, which is nice to see on a can."
""
"The medium body let's the flavors really stick to the palate while still remaining surprisingly smooth and drinkable. The carbonation is almost unnoticeable until the swallow, where this beer suddenly becomes rather crisp."
"A very good showcase of hops. Can't wait to pop my can of this as soon as we get some decent disc weather."
""
"o - another stellar beer from oskar blues. love this in 16oz cans too."

""
"Pours a clear copper color with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A latticework of small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of herbal and vegetal hops. There is a slight onion/garlic aroma but nothing like Gubna. Taste is of herbal and vegetal hops with a slight malt presence. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good IPA but the vegetal hop aromas and flavors aren't my cup of tea."
"O - A pretty solid offering from Oskar. I love the trend towards tall boy cans. This one will appeal to those that are looking for tongue numbing bitterness. But it lacks the balancing juicy fruit hop flavors that make the best DIPAs stand out. Worth trying."
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer, but too bitter and w/ a lousy aftertaste. A bit disappointed in this one."
"Hope to be able to enjoy cans of this one...cans coming to the east coast??"
"overall: tasty stuff, as expected from ole oskar"
"-Cheers!"

"There's alot of fresh dank DIPA out there with this and Hoptimum pretty widely available. Pours a beautiful, pale copper color with a bright khaki nicely formed head. Fine lacing left bedhind between sips, I can't believe a DIPA like this comes out of a can. Aroma has a bit of garlic/onion notes going on with some earthy pine resin, minimal citrus pith but basically intense hops. A bit of caramel based breadiness in the nose as well, but it's hard to tell with an explosion of hops. Flavor is eqaully as hoppy with a nice riding malt sweetness, caramel base with flowing levels of hop bitterness and flavor. A nice citrus earthy pine resin ride of hops, that hides the booze nicely. Sweetness is kind of obsurd but it definitely balances out the hop bitterness. The only thing that starts to arise is the onion/garlic hop flavor that I don't really care for. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying big hop oils with some residual sugars noted in this one, carbonation moderate body is full. Overall enjoyable hop nose, a bit muted hop flavors with ample bitterness an 8% DIPA in a 16 ounce can if a do the math right that could equal: DRUNK."

"O-i was so excited to finally try something different from oskar blues. i wanted to drink this out of the can but i couldn't bring myself to do it, since it was my first tasting. its a really good IPA, not something i'd mind having again. actually i wouldn't mind having a few of these. as far as oskar blues beers go, i'd say its one of my least favorite though"
"Pours amber with a little off white soapy head. Smells of weed, onion, catty with some musk. Really a masculine, if you will, nose. REsiny, grapefruit, onion again, really surprised at how I can taste the alcohol through this hop onslaught. Really a ton of hops here and a good dose of sweet malts. There is a body odor flavor on the hop profile and I am okay with it, but not really digging the flavor much. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a wet finish. This is a big beer certainly, but a little too far into the resin, onion, veggie, B.O. profiles for me. Probably the first big miss I've had from Oskar Blues."

"Overall: A tad too much alcohol present, and heavy. Despite those negatives, a dank and piney DIPA that is flavorful."
"8% ABV is great. Though not the biggest in size, size ain't everything, and this has a very good tongue if you like big IPA's."
"o - overall, started off really digging this and thinking i found my new local go-to ipa (esp since they actually date the cans), but in the end, it is a bit on the thick/syrupy side. the hop profile is nice and sticky and follows through on the flavor, but in the end, ipas are pretty competitive style and this one is pretty good...not great or amazing, pretty good. i'd be happy to have this again. thanks oskar blues...appreciate it."
"While this beer isn't terrible, I just thought the alcohol was way too noticeable, especially for a beer with only 8% abv."

"Deviant Dale's pours a copper-orange, with a billowy, white head that eventually settles down to provide thick lace. A BIG hoppy nose is bursting through the can, hints of citrus and grapefruit can be attributed to the use of Columbus hops in dry-hopping, with slight whiffs of bready malt and pine peaking through from time to time. Piney hop flavors are exceptionally well-balanced by sweet, bready malt flavors. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, this brew weighs in at 8%, but hides it well. A GREAT addition to the ""canarchy"" that is Oskar Blues."
"Dale’s Evil Brother? Or probably more like Dale’s and Gubna’s love child. A serious hop assault, somewhere between an IPA and DIPA. Super dank and resinous. The aroma on this is just ridiculous..."
""
""
"Overall: Can I just have a Dale's Pale instead? Oooh, or a Gordon?? If anybody wants the last couple ounces of this, then knock yourselves out."
""
"O: A pretty good IPA for the hop heads. There's definitely no holding back on the hops."
"Overall - if you like dales pale ale, but want more hops this is for you. Its sweet, yet bitter and easy to enjoy. Lots of hops but a nice balance of malts and sugars make this a great beer. Hopheads will enjoy, as will pale ale fans looking for something more extreme."
"Clear red-amber color, good head. I knew after the first whiff of this beer that it did not have a hop profile I was going to like. It smelled sort of like summit hops or maybe columbus adn made me instantly think of pepper and onions. It reminded me a lot of Gubna and Green Flash Imperial IPA. Flavor followed suit, added a chewy maltiness and was no good. I'm sorry I didn't like Gubna and I don;t like this at all. I'll stick to Gordon, Dale's Pale, and Mama's."
"Good beer for hop heads"
""
"O: I could see myself drinking this as a regular IPA. Enough said."

"Very nice and very smooth. Again, the hoppiness wasn't as much as I expected, but still a very awesome brew."
""
"This beer is a pine/grapefruit bomb with tropical fruit backing. It is utterly unbalanced and harshly astringent. The high alpha-acid hops and carbonation need to be toned back. As it stands, it is hard to down half of one of the tall boys. A rare miss from OB for me."
""
""
""
"I definitely enjoyed this one, but I just can't see myself having much more than a single can. It's just so massively bitter and resinous. Tasty if not seriously drinkable."
"this just came out from what i hear. pours from a tallboy into a schooner an orange color, perfectly transparent, white lace hanging on the edges. smells yummy, big fresh aromatic spruce tree like hops. flavor is hoppy without being bitter or sweet, its very well balanced by its malt profile, a lot like its little brother. i like this beer a lot, something unique from most double ipas. must be the hop variety. feel is brightly carbonated with a medium body and a noticable alcoholic burn at the end. a little harsh there, but it reminds me what im drinking, which i appreciate. as a big ipa, its a new twist, but i still prefer dales. worth a shot"
""
"Taste is a really nice blend of malts with the citrus pine hops. Its one of those chewy brews. Really well balanced and the alcohol is hidden very well. This could be a session brew with no problem. Overall, I really like this one, possibly one of my favorite of Oskar Blues ive had to date."
"O - One I look forward to drinking more. Overall a good addition to the category. Comparable price/quality to other good DIPA offerings."
""
"O- an awesome brew, the way it was described to me, before it's release was a double dry hopped sales pale ale, and there is plenty of dry hopping here, one of my favorites from Oskar blues for sure!!"
"o-this def an IPA but I feel as if it could benefit from a little more malt and a little more alcohol. Although this claims to be 8.5 % the can only says 8%. I would not classify this as a double though because it does not have nearly enough malt. All in all this is a fantastic beer and truly take you to the ""Deviant"" side of Dales"
"One of the best Oskar Blues I've had yet. Right up there with Ten Fidy in quality. This is a truly worthy imperial IPA that compares favorably to Devil Dancer or Hop Dam. Highly recommended- I'll definately be looking for more of this. "
"This was an excellent IPA and I would recommend it to anyone that loves this style."

"O - Good DIPA...citrus and tropical fruity hop lovers will enjoy this. This is a DIPA that really has a ton of hop flavor to it. Definitely solid all the way, however probably lacks just enough to keep this out of the upper echelons of the style."
"O: A tasty Brew, but doesn't really stand out as very memorable. Very drinkable, but it lacks that dry bitter bite I look for in my DIPAs. I'd definitely give it another shot though if given the chance."
"Overall I can see why this beer wins medals. Over the top and really really hoppy."

"O- A truly excellent beer. Similiar to Pliny IMO. It's hard to nit pick this beer, I just wish they would can this one!"
"Hopheads, enjoy."
"O - Seems ok. From what I understand this is a ramped up variation of Dale's Pale. For that, it delivers. It's got a more rich feel to it and the alcohol content is very well hidden. But, there are far better imperial IPAs out there. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to seek this out again."
"Pours an amber orange with a massive amount of off white foam. Several fingers thick. Smells of slight citrus and fruit with a heavy malt backbone. So heavy in fact it is the flavor profile to me. Malt flavor profile = garbage and drain pour. I can't do them. I try and I try, but they are flat out awful. Sweet caramel that richly coats your tongue. It gets stuck in the back of my throat and I want to gag. Horrible beer flat out."
"Deviant Dale's pours a fairly translucent orange, with a little bit of white foam capping the beer. Given that it was somewhat of a lackluster pour, the amount of lacing left down the side of the glass is impressive. The nose is intensely citrusy, but in a nice change of pace pineapple seems to be the dominant aroma, with grapefruit notes relegated to a supporting role. There's a nice sturdy malt backbone right up front, a combination of biscuit and caramel flavors. The expected blast of bitterness washes over next, but in the name of what turns out to be a disappointingly weak hoppy payoff. The aforementioned citrus notes are once again present, but not nearly as potent as I might expect from a DIPA with a pungent nose and big dose of bitterness. The body is a bit lighter than I would have expected, but it works well and makes the the beer easier drinking. Carbonation is nice and lively, elevating what hop presence there is. I'm a fan of both Dale's Pale Ale, and Oskar Blues in general, so I did have high hopes for Deviant Dale's that ultimately weren't quite met."
"Overall: This is a very good beer, the bitterness is definitely the dominant flavor. There was a little too much alcohol in the finish for my liking. I would have it again."
"On tap at Bierkraft and at The Gate, good work bringing your A game to BK, OB. This is an excellent and smooth IPA, didn't realize the ABV is 8.5% if that is indeed true. Doesn't drink like it at all. More like a 7 with fatty hops blasting their goods. Quick solid bitter gives way to the malt, but the hops popping off stole the story"
"DRINKABILITY: Overall, the Deviant Dale's actually does not sit too heavy and at 8.5% it is not too boozy for a DIPA. I had a couple, but certainly would have been open to having more if time had permitted."
"When I first heard about this one, I thought it might have been some soured barrel aged version of Dale's. This was, however, not the case. Had this one on tap at one of the Old Chicago locations north of Denver (wasnt driving or paying attention). Served in a large pewter mug (I felt like Paul Revere) so I have no idea what it looked like. Big hops, great initially, though they became too much after a while. Pretty good, but nothing worth going out of the way for."
"If anyone from Oskar Blues reads this please, please can this... I will buy it, often and in large quantity."
"Overall this is an excellent beer."
