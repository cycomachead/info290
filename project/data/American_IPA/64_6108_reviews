"A clear golden pour with a thin fizzy head that all but disappears leving a skim of tiny fizz. The smell is of faint hops, and malt. A well balanced IPA, featuring a bit of citrus hops, some noticeable malt, and a bit of grass. More malt than my ideal, but so well balanced I have to be impressed. Very solid."

"O: The hops are exceptionally well done in this beer."

"Pours a clear gold color with a small white kinda fizzy head. Has a generic hop smell with some grassy, earthy tones and a hint of citrus, also there was a little bit of a malty aroma. Taste reflects this aswell, but what kind of stood out to me was how noticeable the malt was, also the alcohol was fairly noticeable. It was fairly light, and pretty drinkable. It was pretty good, but fairly different than the IPAs I have been drinking lately. Honestly after reading other reviews I might have drank it a little too cold."
""
""
""
"A delicious IPA. Not overpowering and very drinkable. Crisp and clean."
""
""
"Deep gold pour with frothy white head and tons of lacing. Grapefruit and grass aroma. Subdued grass and citrus flavors; lemon grassy finish. Lite mouthfeel, very crisp, with a citrusy tongue coating. Excellent lite IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great taste And after taste"
""
""
"Fresh nose with citrus, mixed with a grassy field after a spring rain.  Hoppy on the palette and strong.  Finishes with gusto like a real IPA should."
""
""
"Like others who have said, very easy drinking and consistently good. For those who want to have a good time but don't want to refrain from knocking some cold ones back. A prime choice, cheers."
""
"Very easy drinking IPA. Nice bitter notes"
""
"Carbonation is lively, and there's enough malt to balance out the hops.   Substantial but not heavy."

"Slight citrus with strong pine taste with a most pleasurable feel. Went down smooth with a great feeling. Totally loved this beer"
"Overall- An excellent beer, I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"A solid, easily accessible IPA.  Has a great bouquet of sweet tropical fruit and pineapple.  Taste is mainly tart grapefruit flavors, but has a mild sweetness on the finish for some balance.  The taste is pretty typical of a quality IPA.  Overall good, but nothing special."
""
""
""
"If you are looking for an IPA that is more on the mellow side versus other IPAs this one is for you. I like my IPAs strong with a big, hoppy bite and a pungent nose. This IPA is good but not great. Kind of bland in the context of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium, nicely carbonated, not as dry as most ipas"
"AT: A well balanced IPA and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full flavored and bitter. I wish it were more full in texture."

"I finished a Founders Centennial before imbibing on this one. It was my first 60 Minute. Looked great. Poured a clean, dark amber. Promising. Didn't like the taste one bit. No comparison to the complex, yet balanced and strong taste of a Centennial. I realize they're two totally different beers. A Bentley GTC is a different car than a Chrysler 300. I don't see myself ever buying this one again."
""
"this was the worst beer i have ever tasted ...."
""
"I had this beer the other day in the good ol Hooier State, and I think that was the major problem. The hops did not explode at me like I thought they would. I am going to try it again in the future a bit closer to Delaware to get the full  experience."
""
"Overall a good IPA, but it didn't impress me like I had hoped. Smell, and more importantly, taste are both a bit lacking in my opinion. Very drinkable. I feel like I could sit and enjoy several of these, unlike some other IPA's. I just feel like it's missing something. Maybe the 90 minute IPA will be more up my alley."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at DFH Fairfax, VA. Amber pour with thick white foam that sticks. Piney and resinous with a flash of orange. Nice bitterness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours gold-brown with thin, clingy off-white head. Aroma is citrus and malt, not as pungent as I’d expected. Same with the flavor - this is definitely session beer. Tasty for sure, but not terribly interesting."
""
"Very smooth, not too hoppy for the average beer drinkers. I will definitely be having another one or two of these soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another great IPA from DFH and one that is lower in alcohol than many of its brethren without sacrificing body or flavor. Delicious beer, though I admittedly like 90 Minute more."
""
""
""
"Don't like the finish reminds me of Fat Tire"
"Good. Quite hoppy but not as bitter as expected. I was looking for a little more sweetness. But overall very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall: My least favorite of all DFH IPA's. Still overall decent."
""
""
""

""
""
"great starter beer for any craft newbie"
""
""
"Overall: A classic that I'm finally getting around to reviewing. Certainly a contrast to today's IPAs but it still holds up to them, and could be considered a gold standard like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is for APAs"

"Was a bit apprehensive about this but tried it at the request of a friend in Belfast who had never had it and wanted a review.  Well I'm glad I did. Really solid IPA character but not overly hoppy.   Bright color, small bubble foamy head.  Can't wait to have it again."

"Maybe its that my mood today is so so and i ordered this with dinner for $6 instwad if just geabbing a sixer on the way home. I wouldnt have a problem knocki.g 5 more back as its quite drinkable. Its rather sweet with a big malt presence, which i enjoy. But so many glowing reviews on here! Its good, nothing exceptional. i can think of four or five ipa's off the top of my head from Chicago breweries that id choose over this any and everyday. If its the only beer available like twas the case today i would gladly drink it. If you havent had it id recommend trying it. But i dont really see myself picking this up. Though it is, no doubt, a gighly drinkable sweet malty hoppy balanced brew."

"full not too heavy mouthfeel"

"Overall: I did not expect Dogfish Head to disappoint, and it didn't.  I have a lot of respect for those who attempt to recreate beers of the distant past.  Anthropological geniuses!  This is a very, very solid IPA indeed!"

"Good but not a great beer"
"patriots suck!"
"Poured a clear amber body with three fingers of foamy, thick white head that receded slowly to a ring of lacing. It looks like a rather nice IPA, quite enticing. Scents of citrus zest upfront quickly leading into vegetal, earthy, dank hops, light pine resin, hints of juniper berry and sour, wild red berries, floral hop aromas and a distinct backbone of bready, biscuit-like malt with some light sweetness. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice, rather complex IPA done in the East Coast style with less overt pine, citrus and none of the tropical fruit seen in West Coast examples. This makes it pleasantly balanced yet still quite hoppy and very nice. Flavor begins with medium-high bitterness, beginning with flavors of citrus zest and light amounts of pine resin before moving into bitter, earthy, dank, herbal hop flavors. Middle is high in bitterness with a pronounced floral character, with notes of citrus blossom and jasmine. Finish is high in bitterness with notes of pine resin, bitter herbal hops and light notes of floral hops, again mostly citrus blossom. Light berry-like notes appear in the middle and even less on the finish. A lightly sweet and bready malt backbone is discernible throughout, continuing into the aftertaste. The aftertaste begins with a light bready malt flavor that quickly gives way to bitter hop flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely hoppy IPA that has a nice level of bitterness, but also a good depth and complexity of floral, fruity, herbal and resinous flavors to make it intriguing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, oily, resinous slickness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good IPA, classic and true to style. Overall this is a fantastic American IPA. It keeps away from the overwhelming maltiness that damages some East Coast examples, keeping hop character high, all the while maintaining a distinct identity from the West Coast hop bombs. A balanced and well executed beer on all counts and quite worth the price point."

"Excellent IPA, definitely one of my favorites. A lot more drinkable than a lot of IPA's with an aftertaste that is smooth with a subtle hoppy bite and not overbearing. The mouth full is also not too sticky like a lot of IPA's"
""
""
"Crisp, drinkable, a pretty darn good (Not Great) IPA.  I believe that I could have another one of these.  And that's saying something, because I'm not a huge IPA guy.  The IPA is just one of a hundred beer styles.  Why the IPA has become the big craft beer thing is beyond me."

""
""

"This is a great IPA.  Smooth, fragrant and delicious."
"Overall: this brew lives up to its style, a very good IPA that you can session, would like a pizza to go with a few of these. Would definitley recommend and will be seeing this brew again soon"
""
""
""
"Wonderful beer, very enjoyable"
""

"Can never go wrong with a dogfish!"
"Great IPA, appropriately bitter and tons of citrus and hops"
""
""
""
"Excellent IPA. Consistently good from the bottle, I have had a batch or two taste slightly off at some pubs, but I'll blame that on poor lines. One of the best in the genre."
""
"What a fantastic beer! Slightly less intense than the 90 and 120 minutes, yet strong enough for hop heads to get their fix. It pours a light copper with a modest sized head that retains as a soapy, creamy and frothy looking lace. The aroma is great; malt sweetness, some cocoa and especially floral hops. It almost smells like a perfume! Taste has a strong malt backbone to balance off the hops intensity. The finish is dry and bitter. Amazing feel; creamy, crisp, refreshing and unbelievably drinkable. DFH is the best!!"

""
"This is my winter season go to beer if I am tired of stouts and porters. This IPA has such a consistent reputation of being a standout IPA! It is super clean and crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice lighter tasting ipa. First hit with a citrus and hop flavor followed by a good malty finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Just one of my favorites. I'll choose something cheaper off the shelf; but it's one of my first choices in a bar."

""
"Wish I had tried it before"
""

"Nice hoppy taste and good feel"
""

"A very solid IPA.  An old standby for me."
"tastes like coors light/keystone ice ipa. like  woodsy ""darker"" tasting ipa. wouldnt buy again. not a bad brew, just my taste."
"Great Ale! Nice hoppy flavor but not too fruity!"
"One of Terry and George's neighbors is a man who married a Korean woman.  Her 22 year old niece was visiting, and she came to the party.  She was a little shy and didn't know anyone.  Terry's daughters were all busy with their friends so I basically had the undivided attention of this ""adorkable"" little Korean science geek.  So add that to the great IPA taste of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, and the answer to the equation is the best party ever."
"Doesn't live up to the hype for my tasting buds"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would seek this one out and purchase again. Although, being that it is not easily accessible in my area, I will find something a bit easier to find but with similar flavor. Delicious nonetheless though."
"Eh. Hype is not always reality. Good but not what I expected from the raving reviews on this highly reputable website."

"Nice 6% IPA with a lot of flavor. The hops are kind of masked by a slightly bready malt overtone. I like this beer at a slightly lower than ambient temperature to really enjoy the body and bite that is masked at too cool a serving temperature."

"Reminds me a lot of Torpedo, actually. Pretty darn floral... Some Rose Petals on the nose.  Thinner than 90 Minute, more traditional tasting IPA (when compared to 90 Min) Nice dry finish, with a malty sweetness undertone throughout.  A little but of orange on the nose, but predominately, floral, earthy, and piney hops.  It's really balanced.... great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just picked this up on a whim. Definitely glad I did, because this is now one of my favorite IPAs. Really smooth and damn refreshing. Not the ""after mowing the lawn"" refreshing but the after a long day of work refreshing. The flavor is solid and doesn't overdo it on the hops making it an easy back to back beer after a long day. Or really, any time you want a tasty quality beverage. Will definitely be buying this again."

"O – After drinking enough of the 90 Minute, you forget how tasty, smooth, and session-worthy the 60 Minute really is.  An excellent pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this a few times, but forgot how good it is.  It pours a gold color with a nice head and lacing.  Nose is orange and grapefruit with some malt sweetness.  Flavor is very balanced- great mix of orange and caramel malt with a mild bitter finish.  Very juicy and delicious."

"I've always been partial to Dogfish Head, this is one of the first true craft beers I ever had, and there's some nostalgia to that. The color is light for an IPA, which is surprising given all the flavor. The flavor definitely is citrusy off the bat, with significant malt on the back end."

"Noticed the 60 Minute IPA is continuously hopped -- more than 60 hop additions over a 60-minute boil!! IT BREWED with slew of great Northwest hops. A powerful but balanced East Coast IPA with a lot of citrusy hop character, it's the session beer for hardcore enthusiasts! GOOD wish more lager!! Best but I like other!!!"
"Overall:  One of the best IPA's that I have tasted and I could drink it everyday!"

"Great take on an IPA. For me, it is everything you love about IPAs tied into one. The taste is balanced with flavors of citrus, pine/grass and rush of other hoppy flavors. This is probably my favorite IPA and I wasn't expecting it to be. Would highly suggest everyone try it if it is in your state!"

"An amazing IPA. Pours a hazy yellow with a fizzy head that trails the glass. The smell is full of floral and grapefruit scents from the hops and a bit of sweetness from the alcohol. The taste was full of hop flavor but with a nice balance which ended in a semi-sweet crisp finish that was very refreshing. A classic by my standards and a must try for those getting into craft beer."

"I will always keep Dogfish Head's 60-minute in mind when I am looking for an excellent and non-abolishing American IPA. It has a gorgeous, deep orange-gold body and great head retention with sticky lacing throughout. The aroma is sensually floral and citrusy but reminded me of catching wafts of fresh-baked cookies from three rooms away at home: nostalgia in a bottle. Highly drinkable, it is easy going down with a strong, clean day-on-the-lake finish and satisfyingly bitter aftertaste that sticks around."

"Classic IPA"
""
""
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready, slightly caramel malt, grassy hops with light pine, citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is dominated by resiny pine and citrus hops with a bit of hay, citrus rind and mild malt. Finishes with well balanced citrus and resinous piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This was one of my breakthrough IPAs back in the day and I approached this bottle with a little trepidation. There have been some awesome IPAs produced in the interim, and I am frequently slightly underwhelmed by East Coast IPAs now, preferring the West Coast hop varieties. No need to worry, this has held up well, still an excellent flavor blend of hops, nice assertive hop bitterness and a neutral, but supportive malt body. One of the classic IPAs. Off the market in my area for a long time and welcome back."

"I am typically a lager drinker but this is my go-to when I am ready for some hop bitterness...The beer pours with a perfect head and solid carbonation; the slight chill haze wore off as the beer warmed in the glass. I think this beer is actually smoother and more drinkable as it moves from fridge temp to cellar temp to room temp. Refreshing, super-smooth, nicely balanced and a tangy hop finish that leads you to the next swig. I think the Dogfish Head guys are superb, all of their beers are well engineered and show off their creativity and professionalism."

"Poured from bottle to frosted pint glass. Pours a nice yellow to golden color with about a finger or so of foam that laces the glass nicely. Smells first of bread and malt, but subtle notes of citrus (lemon mostly) come through at the end. Taste is of the malt/breadiness at firSt, but a piney/citrusy taste dominates at the end as with most IPAs the taste is a bit better than the aroma in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a perfect crisp carbonation. Overall it is a great beer, but I prefer the 90 minute much more!"

"Living on the West Coast, IPA's are king.  Unfortunately, the majority of IPA's here do nothing but destroy the palate, leaving people unable to enjoy what lies beneath the hops.  This beer does an exemplary job of allowing you to taste everything the beer has to offer without drowning you with hops.  One of the few IPA's that can be drank as an everyday beer (or session beer as it's called)."

"Dogfish hits it out of the park again. Great pour with a good solid head that hangs around for a little bit. Flavor is a little citrusy and hoppy with a touch of maltiness(are these words real?, lol). The carbonation is average and the finish is clean and crisp.."

"I've had both draft and bottle. An easy go to IIPA in my area (Maryland). Hops!  Ahhh the Hops on this one!  Beautiful on the nose!  Heads up nice. Mouthfeel , not thick but stays well. Piney, resiney and flavorful with some fruit hints in there as well!  Finishes with a bite but not too bitter!  This IIPA has nuts!  I love it. Go ahead...bang on your chest after a couple of these!  Thanks Sam!"

"Overall: this is my first Dogfish Head IPA, and it doesn't disappoint. Well combined and true to the American IPA, just a bit crisper and cleaner than some others. It is still hard to justify the price, with the best I found being AU$140 a case of 24 x 355mL."

"A good ipa but nothing too special. After living in Colorado for over five years I have found Titan IPA by Great Divide along with Hoppy Boy IPA by Twisted Pine to be superior in overall taste and smell. I would recommend drinking the 90 minute by Dogfish and allowing the beauty of the beer to transform your day or night!"

"A great sessionable hoppy IPA. Very excellent citrusy, yet lemony note, has good hoppy notes with some peach notes and malty, sweet character to balance it. Rich, complex, and hoppy. Not too hoppy to be an easy session IPA for hop fanatics. A good Dogfish Head brew. Very solid. I drank this in bottles. And it is easily available in Tennessee outside liquor stores, so can be had more places. I like DFH 90 minute ale even better, but this is a better brew to drink often. I recommend it to every IPA fanatic. Well balanced for a big ale."

"First off I want to point out that it is possible that the kegs I drank this from may not have been at optimal freshness. I had this at a bar in JFK airport in NY, and then later that night at the bar at the Hilton in Florida. Poured beautiful and golden brown from the tap, with a thick and creamy 2 finger head. The lacing on the glass was incredible and was still present when our server took the empty glass. The aroma I experienced was of muted pine and sweet malt. As for taste, I wasn't overly impressed; mostly sweet bready malts with some piney hop flavors. Overall I found a severe lack of hop flavor and an overwhelming malt presence, not the sort of balance I expected given all the hype surrounding this beer. Again I believe freshness may have played a part and I'll have to examine further and update!"

"Dark golden color.. head that sticks around leaving a spotty lace.. smell is pine, grass sweet fruit and a slight toast... the taste clean pale malt and soft water.. the hops come on gently with grass, hay and a peach and grapefruit finish.. the mouthfeel is so smooth hardly any bubble bite.. pretty nice ipa.. thought it would be much more bitter.. still good."

"This is a classic hoppy (but not super hoppy) IPA. Crisp, clean hoppy bitterness, with distinct carbonation. As other reviewers have noted, this is more sessionable than the 90 min IPA, but less assertive/exciting. Also, the faint citrus sweetness, and noticeable malt backbone, give this beer character but also somewhat detract from the purity of the IPA. This is a fine beer but not my go-to IPA or the best that Dogfish has to offer."

"Overall: I prefer the 90-Minute Imperial IPA bt Dogfish Head, but this one is just as tasty and more sessionable at the 6.0 ABV. I find this one more often than the 90-minute in my are, so I drink it more often. Both are world class beers!"

"I was bios when I first had this beer.. This was one of the first IPAs I had... When I first had this beer I thought it was beer then the 90 minute but since I've been on a beer fest... This beer doesn't have a great punch to it... Not as hoppy as I thought.. Still a beer I like to sip on here and there.. It has a dark golden look to it.. Not to much of a hoppy smell... It's a solid beer."

"O: I keep overlooking this beer as a sort of 'protest' against DFH's wont to create moon dust and wasabi beers, but among the plethora of balanced east-coast IPAs, this one is pretty damn good. Personally, the hop/malt balance is skewed too much to the latter for me. But I can't deny this is a fantastic IPA to cut your teeth on (I should know - a bought a case of this stuff 3 years ago just for that intent)."

"Super fresh, packaged 8/22/14. Poured into my Deschutes pint. Clear amber with an awesome carbonation. About a finger (quickly down to virtually no head), though. Nice look overall. Clean citrus (lemon, grapefruit), some pine, and a nice bitter nose. Nice balance to the taste. Clean bitterness, floral and pine notes, and just an overall freshness. Clean aftertaste, medium to light mouthfeel, and quite refreshing. Overall, balanced, hoppy, what a great deal for a 6er under 10 bucks. This will be an occasional fridge visitor when I find dates this good!"

The overall aspects of this beer are great, but I am left with more pronounced flavors to be desired. If this were labeled as a pale ale, I would've given a higher score. However, this is a good sessionable AIPA."

"dogfish 60, in a pint glasss. appearance is pretty clear golden with lots of bubbles. aroma is hoppy, mainly piney with hints of orange. flavor is a little winey and bitter, hoppy but not harsh. its elegantly flavored. mellow for an American ipa, less intense"

"O: Dogfish Head has definitely set the standard for what an IPA should be. This beer is consistently outstanding all across the board, with no aspects of it truly outshining another. It's just pure, unadulterated hoppy greatness that drinks smooth and always satisfies. This brew has unmatched staying power."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a balanced smooth and foamy (50% each) mouthfeel. This works for this beer and in the style as a whole: enough carbonation to move the beer across the palate, but not too much to undermine the sweetness and flavors of the beer. Closes dry, with medium-high stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

Well carbonated with excellent mouthfeel for abv. Moderate - high bitterness that lingers. Solid IPA, though expected much more bouquet."

"I make it a point to try all of the dogfish brewery flavors anywhere I see them. they have mastered the craft of brewing beer. the 60 min ipa is the one ipa that I always go to when I'm out drinking. it's very smooth tasting with just enough hop. it gives you a nice feeling and very generously priced at most places that I have had it."

"Pours dark gold with an off white head. Aroma is sweat and fruity, a touch minerally and some grain. Flavor is some fruit, minerals, and grains with some pine. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, decent beer but not really one that had me reaching for 2nds. Was happy to find it at the Casino though to enjoy while watching some football."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Pretty good beer with an average taste and aroma out of a bottle. I feel like this one would be a treat to have on tap though. It was a welcomed bitterness but it didn't knock me out of the ballpark by any means. Nice drinkable beer with a decent mouthfeel reminding me of Peak Organic's IPA. However, it seems to be a bit pricey at 10 -12 dollars at vendors in Maine."

""
""
""
""
"O: I like this a lot I could drink it a ll day. Its a solid IPA and a good price."
""

"This is everything one could ever want from a session IPA. The color is a beautiful golden amber. The head is plentiful. The aroma alluring. And the flavor....hoppy, balanced, and smooth. Bitterness is not overwhelming but very enjoyable. Sips refreshing and bright. Overall everything a basic IPA should be. However, if you truly want to experience IPA nirvana....take the money you'd spend on a 6 of this and get the 4 of 90 minute. You won't regret either choice. But you'll only relish in the latter."

"On tap at The Black Sheep. Pours a clear amber color with an inch of thick white head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is piney with some orange zest and lemon. Some spicy hops as well. The taste is bready with some spicy hop notes. Pine hops more towards the middle with some light caramel malts. A hint of lemon. Lots of carbonation with a light body and slick mouthfeel. I was shocked to see that I had never gotten around to reviewing this beer, although I've had it a ton of times. Overall, its a good go-to beer that can be found on tap in most places."

"I thought I knew may favorite IPA then I discovered Dogfish head 60 minute IPA. I first had it on draft and I was surprised at the perfect balance of bitterness and floral notes with a modest ABV% for an IPA of course. It is a everyday IPA that is my new go to beer when I'm in the mood to just drink some beer! This high hop concoction is the perfect pairing with spicy food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a widely available option that never dissapoints. Well done Sam."
""
""
"While I may be a little biased since dogfish is my favorite brewery, the 60 minute is a quality brew. This is my go to beer for an everyday IPA. Pure smoothness with a great finish. Not too hoppy but definitely doesn't skimp on the hop. Great beer that I drink regularly compared to most craft beers that I try."
""
""
""
"This is the first IPA that I found myself liking, and it opened the floodgates. Years later of venturing off into various types of IPA's I found myself giving this a shot again. In many ways this is the archtype of an IPA- not too hoppy, and very well rounded. It doesn't have the luxurious mouthfeel of ""Sierra Nevada - Torpedo", or the full on punch in the face of ""Ithaca Brewing - Flower Power"" - but it damn sure is hearty and satisfying in its beautiful golden/bronze glory. Never a bad choice."

"A lighter color IPA that golden orange with a nice 3/4"" head when poured in a frosty mug. Crisp hoppy lemony alchohol smell that is not as pleasant as some IPA's, but not overpowering and easy to get past to take the first sip. Definitely an IPA as it hits your tounge wit a bitter bite that finishes with fermented lemony aftertaste. Slightly thin that make drinking easy on a sunny afternoon. Not my favorite, and not the quality nor value I was hoping to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the thinner side, as it needs to be for a session IPA, and the carbonation keeps this crisp without going overboard. Overall, this is easily one of the most drinkable IPAs one can find while still offering an impressive flavor profile. This really is a beer that one could drink any day of the year and not be disappointed. Again, this isn't supposed to compete with the 120 minute IPA for hop flavor, but instead is supposed to offer a great alternative for someone looking for a session beer, and this succeeds wonderfully."
""
""
""
""
""
"My gateway IPA. The IPA poured a golden orange with an off white head. There were plenty of citrus notes in the aroma that followed through to the taste. The hoppy flavors were well balanced with a malty backbone which could explain my ease into this IPA. The citrusy hops began my passion and the creamy mouthfeel kept me coming back. After trying many other IPA's I still find the Dogfish 60 Minute IPA is a great IPA and perfect standard bearer for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Still excellent with some age on it, very easy drinking, hard to imagine a better IPA on a hot summer day, but it's no slouch in the Fall either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from bottle to pub glass. Color and clearity is spot on with style guidelines. Scent drown is of bitter flowers. Flavor packed in every ounce. Pale malt taste over taken by hop strength. Everything about this brew is top quality. Very aromatic. Well balanced ingredient usage. Watch for tempature to flavor change."

"I tried the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA for the first time this weekend. I found that it lives up to the hype. It has a strong, bold flavor, with a bit of grapefruit bitterness. The appearance was rich, the taste forceful, and the feel deep and profound. Rich depth and bitter edge make this an ideal choice for one's regular beer. I found the taste strong without being overpowering: strong, edgy bitterness with a bit of citrus, but multi-faceted and balanced. I'm anxious to try the 90 and 120 on another occasion. My score is 92 for this one. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nicely balanced IPA. The hops have just the right level of bitterness to counteract the sweetness of the malts. Not for the diehard hopheads but a fantastic example of the style"

"o: its good, its balanced, but its not as good as 90 min. its harmonized well, but just missing that little extra. a good weeknight beer"

"o- this is a good IPA, but i was honestly expecting more after having the 90 minute IPA. There is a good deal of bitterness typical with an IPA, but an unusual sweet maltyness which i would be lying if i said was not the most enjoyable part of this beer. I feel like a little more citrus would have complimented this beer more, the carbonation is a bit overwhelming. However, a good IPA none the less."
"O - A great beer for the warmer months. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Another winner from Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer stands the test of time. Love it."
"The definitive meh but often lauded East Coast IPA. Looks very nice, though head is weak. Balanced but with very little character or hop taste. An IPA for those who are new to craft beer and/or don't like IPAs. Insipid. Boring. Safe. Blah."

"Pours a darker-straw color, very clear, kind of weak head, but it's there. Smell is nice, herbal hops, with a bit of skunk. Taste is similar. Nice hoppy flavor, but not over-stated! Mouthfeel is good. All in all, a solid, tasty IPA that's readily available for a decent price. Having had a bunch of this stuff though, I'd say it's only worth buying when it's fresh. It falls off pretty quickly and there's a lot of old 60 min sitting around out there... Thankfully they have easy to read bottling dates."

"Diffidently not for the go out and get drunk type. This beer should be savored on a laid back day off from work. Different refreshing taste that stands out, that i absolutely love . I guess the only thing that keeps me from rating this beer higher is the sweetness it has to it. But almost has the taste of grapefruit."

"DATE TASTED: August 17, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... OCCASION: a good Saturday night, plain and simple... APPEARANCE: active body sports a tan orange tint and a creamy white head that laces decoratively--attractive... AROMA: complex citrus with plum, spices (vanilla and pepper), toffee/caramel malts and that classic DFH yeast strain...PALATE: full-bodied, viciously arresting the teeth and tongue; warming but inviting ...TASTE: ridiculously robust bubblegum and toffee blend with hops and spices to produce an IPA with depth and drinkability--a victory... OVERALL: such exquisite balance--much like the 120, but with less punch and more possibility for multiple bottles in a night's enjoyment--could almost be one of the twelve I'd leave to the desert island with..."

"This one is very easy to drink, light bodied, there is a bit of dryness in the finish. I prefer the 60 to the 90 all day long. This is one of the better east coast IPAs on the market and available just about everywhere. Priced a little high per sixer but its within reason. This is one ill drink but only every once in awhile."

"Brilliant gold colored with a haziness about it that doesn't let much light through. Minimal head with some Brussels lace on my glass. Mild pine like hop aroma is enticing. The flavor is a sharp burst of Pacific pine flavored hops backed up with some light malt. The finish is a late bite of hop flavor prickling my taste buds. Slightly sticky mouthfeel."
"I recently tried this beer in Florida and it is a great beer for Hops enthusiasts. The citrus and slightly floral aroma let me know what I was in for. At first sip, it seems like it will be a bitter beer, but it mellows out as the drinking continues. I had this beer with seafood on the Gulf of Mexico and couldn't have been a better experience."

"Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: So sessionable, it was almost disappointing. This beer reminded me more of an amber ale than an IPA. The Bronx Pale Ale I had before it was considerably more hoppy, in terms of both smell and taste. Still a fine beer, but certainly not what I was looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer I've had many times, and finally got around to reviiewing. I must admit, I appreciate it much more now than I did in earlier years. I love DFH 90, and always viewed 60 as a poorer relation. Now I realize they both have their place, and merits."
""

""
""

"O - I would definitely seek this out again. I've had a fair number of IPAs in the past few months, and this might be one of my favorites. I definitely need to get my hands on some 90 minute, and eventually some 120 minute. It's taken me too long to try this beer, as it is one of the most popular craft selections. Highly recommend."
"O: Great beer for hardcore beer lovers and people just starting to expand their beer horizons. The subtle bitterness would allow this beer to be a good introduction into the IPA styles. Very well balanced and smooth."
""
""
"Maybe after a few more beer reviews i'll try it again and see if my views have changed."
""
"Comfortable, easy going and supple. This drinks gently but with plenty of hop qualities and a terrific balance. Smooth and lively without any harshness or aggressive bitter. Dogfish Head has made a delicate IPA."

"Pours hazy, golden color. Very thick foamyhead that evaporated quickly. Excellent lacing on the side of the glass that was still there after finishing the beer. Piney, bready, citrus smells permeate. Hop bitterness throughout entire sip. Piney, citrus flavor with good hoppy aftertaste. Bitterness persists on the back of the tongue."
"O: A refreshing IPA; nicely balanced. Must try. East coaster. Solid IPA - citrusy, tingly, good example of the style, good introduction.  Not my favorite."

"It's an interesting approach. I wished for more on the palate, but I liked the fact that while the hops are very much in the beer, they are not muscling everything else out of the nose and even on the palate, where they do take over, they are not at a volume that is overpowering to the senses."
""
""
""
"Fantastic IPA! Excellent for a beginner ofthe IPA style. Great light amber color. Hoppy flavor and aftertaste but disapates quickly. Habe heard nothing but great things about Dogfish Head. This was my first beer by Dogfish not my last! Looking forward to the 90, 75, & 120 minute IPA!"
""
""

""
""

"This is a very good regular offering in the IPA world. In contrast to many of the creative-beyond-reason products coming out of this brewery, the 60 minute is a consistent classic that I'll return to regularly. Despite some component deficits, this is a very enjoyable craft."

"The taste is where the hops take off. I get a wonderful sweetness with the first sip but then it quickly evolves into a piney, floral hop bitterness that ends a tad on the dry side. I can see why this one gets such high ratings. It is exquisite."
""
""
""
""
"I've had a lot of this one this week in Rehoboth. Smells great. Hops come through on the nose. Taste is where I sometimes get a slight background smoky character alongside the citrus hops, but not every time. Mouth feel is very creamy. Overall an excellent IPA and, surprisingly from DFH, low in abv for the style."

I did consider this brew to be incomplete, because of the appearance and the bouquet. However, it is an excellent tasting IPA (my overall score notwithstanding) and is definitely worth picking up if you have not trie it previously."
""
""
""
""
"O- I actually prefer this in a lot of ways to the dfh 90 min - I love that the green hoppiness stays with me until the end this beer just makes me want to grill fish and sit outside. I'm also a huge fan of its intenseness coming with a relatively low abv for an ipa. well done dogfish."

"Pours pale copper crystal clear. Foamy white head dissipates to a nice lacy cap. Floral aroma with slight pine and biscuity malt. Floral hops, pine and grapefruit in the flavor balanced perfectly by malt backbone. Smooth mouthfeel with nice carbonation. The hops assert themselves without slapping you in the face like too many IPAs. An outstandingly balanced east-coast IPA that should be in every IPA lovers rotation."
""
"O - the first time I had 60 minute i fell in love with its balance all while getting a quick hop fix. It's a true classic from DFH and really sets the tone for what their style is all about. A good intro into the world of unique Dogfish brews. It's a must try for any craft beer lover and one you'll have again and again."

"overall: A great IPA from one of my favorite breweries, it's a well balanced highly drinkable IPA, nothing too special, but that's not the point with this one. They just wanted to make a really good all around beer that anyone can enjoy. Personally, I will almost always buy the 90 minute, but I guess that's just me being a hophead."

"This beer doesn't seem to be as good as when I first tried it. Maybe it's my expectations for an IPA. It pairs very well with food, and makes a very solid choice for an every day IPA or a substitute for light lagers, but ultimately, there are tastier IPAs out there."

"O: A very well balanced beer. This is surprisingly one of Dogfish Head’s and the market’s less hop forward IPA’s these day but that allows the malt body to be appreciated as well. Has been and will continue to be an East Coast favorite."

"60 Minute IPA is a hazy, light amber color with about a half inch of foam, clnging nicely to the glass. Very carbonated, with no pieces of sediment visible. The aroma evokes the scent of sweet baked goods, along with a pleasing pine fragrance. With a sip, I find it toasty, bready, as well as nutty, buttery, and sweet. The lemon/citrus hop flavors come in and initially are not too bitter...until the finish kicks in with a harsher and dryer wave washing over the palate. It's a medium feeling beer and totally drinkable. An iconic IPA, this is one of the beers that made me fall in love with the style and craft beer in general. For fans of the style with a bit of a malt balance, it's the 'all day' IPA before Founders coined the term."

"Overall, one of the best introductory IPA's I've had. I recommend this to people who are just starting out as it highlights the style very well yet it is still good enough that I partake when possible. Another great DFH."

"Lately, I've been on a Dogfish Head kick and this one was next in line. I started with their 90 Minute IPA, so I had similar expectations with this one. This is a good beer and it introduced some flavors I had not yet experienced. For an IPA, this has a floral and citrus sweetness that is well balanced with the slight hop bitterness. It's not a complicated beer. No, it's a good spring beer. Its taste reminds me of fresh cut grass and budding flowers. This one is worth a shot, but Dogfish Head certainly has better."
""
"Overall this is one of the greats, I recommend this beer for anyone including those who tend to stray from IPAs. I recommend pulling a bottle out and letting it sit on the counter for 15 - 30 minutes, pour into a glass at room temperature and enjoy. For about $10 - $12 bucks for a six pack you cant go wrong. This is a perfect beer for beginner craft beer drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Light body keeps this quite drinkable and hop progression is interesting, but not overpowering. The evolution of the hop flavors with the malt (a back and forth of sorts) makes this beer quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I truly love this beer. This is the beer that really got me into craft beers. I love that it's as hoppy and assertive as it is, but is in my opinion the most sessionable beer in it's category. This beer made me into the hop fanatic that I am today, and I'm really grateful I decided to try it all those years ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While I prefer the 90 minute IPA, this one is no slouch. This would be a great beer to drink while playing cards with your buds. Some might think this is basically the ""light"" version of DFH's minute series, but I see this brew as standing alone from the others. It is nothing like the others as a matter of fact...and it's unique flavors and characteristics, while not as pronounced or ""in your face"" as your typical IPA manages to blend into an extremely well crafted beer!"
""
""
"O: Decent brew at best. Lacking a bit of hops all around."
""
""
""
"No, I don't work for DFH, but calling it IPA for beginners is dumb."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Satisfying ipa I've drank for years. Not outstanding but a good ipa. Not overpowering, could be a nice start to trying ipas."

"O- AMEN! MY FAVORITE IPA TO DATE HAS RISEN! I love bell's two hearted. summit's saga ipa is in my heart forever. stone's ipa is amazing. but NOTHING has hit me like this one the first glass. It's an herbal aroma, which is such a change up. I'm a little burned out on citrus. The flavor blends, from citrus, to herbal, to malty sweetness. It's sessionable in the ABV and mouthfeel. I'm happy to call this my favorite IPA. Cheers."

"Very disappointed in this one. Weird toasty biscuit malt, non descript hop bitterness. Highly over rated. This is more along the lines of an english ipa. it may have stood out 10 years ago but is very average with all the huge American ipa's out there now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is just a good beer, but not a great beer in my opinion. It's like I'm waiting for flavor that just never hits me. I love you dogfish head, but this is not your finest work. Worth a try but not exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is their flagship, and it shows that they can both brew normal, simple kick-ass beers and brew big weird awesome beers. Sometimes I just want to taste raw hops in their simplest form, and that's 60 Minute."

"Pours a light copper with a thin layer of head. There are grapefruit and hoppy notes in the nose. Good body for a single IPA. Not quite malt forward, but one can certainly taste the malts in this offering. There is a pleasantly hoppy finish to this one. One of the best single IPAs out there."
""
""
"Dogfish Head might be the best brewer in the U.S. Although I prefer the 90 minute IPA, this is an excellent IPA that would rival most brewer's best offering. Top-notch ingredients shine through, leading to a balanced IPA with a surprisingly sharp hop character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was disappointed by this beer. I feel like no hops came through whatsoever, and it was mostly a malty taste. Definitely lacked some complexity due to the lack of hops. Don't get me wrong it's a great beer, but it's lacking some characteristics that would make it amazing."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 1/23/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, lemon, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, lemon, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a nice malt balance that isn’t too strong; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA. Very well balanced, yet still hoppy; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- good beer from dogfish, its a good go to ipa for a nice sunny day....im more of a fan of the 90 minute but if you can get the 60 minute anywhere pick it up and try it"
""
"Not to say this is a bad beer, but, also cannot say that this would be my go to IPA or one that I would purchase again."
""
"I know that many look at this as the ""standard"" for ipa, but I must admit with so many other delicious micro brews out there, this would not be my choice. I think it is clear that many others have surpassed this take on IPA. I must admit that on tap was a much better review than in bottle."
""
""

"O- Very surprised to say that this would definitely not be my IPA of choice, especially given the great amount of IPA's that I can easily obtain in my area. Still good though."

"Love dogfish!! This beer didn't disappoint. Easy IPA that goes down smooth. Would recommend to anyone IPA lover or not. Quality beer once again.

"Update: December 2012. Just tapped a 3 week old keg at home of the 60 Minute IPA. This is still a classic fantastically hoppy IPA that is just so damn drinkable and enjoyable. This beer more than any is all about the freshness. I don't get this often anymore as Sam C. has jacked his prices up beyond reasonable (keg anyway), but every once and awhile I get a hankering for it. Put the price aside, the beer NEVER disappoints."

"This beer is a great IPA, plain and simple. Nothing too fancy or wacky, but executed superbly. At 6% ABV, it might be slightly high to session, but if you're feeling frisky - go for it. One of the first beers I recommend to my friends who are new to IPAs (and usually the world of craft beer), right before I bump them up to Two Hearted."

I've had a couple other DFH and I was starting to convert to a fan, but this one made me a believer. A really great example of balance in a style that frequently sees beers reaching to make an impact."

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with an eggshell colored head that gives off a green hue. A lot of toasted malt on the nose. Sweet, rich toffee. Some grassy notes. Malty presence in the flavor with lemongrass breaking through. Guinness sud rings remain on the glass as the beer is drunk. Mouthfeel if very pleasant. Full bodied, wet, with just the right amount of hop burn and carbonation. Very drinkable and appealing. I can see why this is the flagship. Very solid."

"One of my favorite IPA's. Has a good amount of hoppiness with a nice citrus/grapefruit flavor, but is balanced nicely with toasted malts that make it go down oh so easy. Looks good, smells good, and tastes good. I can't decide if I like the 90 minute or the 60 minute better, but the good thing about this one is I can drink a few more of them!"

"This is a quintessential east coast IPA. Just a touch of haze in a basically clear classic golden amber brew. A goodly amount of lace from the finger and a half head. A gentle fade leaves a frothy covering that stays throughout. Smell is full of grapefruit and citrus with a healthy amount of sweet pine and caramel malt. A light dough and yeast. A touch of tropical fruit gives a nice flourish. Taste is superb it follows the nose and gives a big hop entrance. Hop oil and grapefruit skin. A lovely astringent quality that keeps it very dry even as the healthy malt core shows up to balance and give counter to the hop parade. Just enough toasted grains and doughy breadiness to put meat on the bone. The tropical notes are just a touch bigger making the beer juicy and deliciously flavorful. The finish is smooth and malty at first with the hop oil blossoming on the back end, coating my throat and mouth in that sequence. Feel is supple and crisp with a lively carbonation that is spot on. Weight is a sublime compliment and makes this a session ale supreme even at the slightly higher abv. One of the best A IPAs I've had and that's all there is to it."
""
""

"O - Nice east coast styled IPA in my opinion. This one is really enjoyable with a lot flavors going one and definitely pleases as I drink it. Not over the top but really solid brew from DFH that I can see myself picking up again. Cheers."

"This stuff is just wicked. It poors a full golden color with a small immaculate white head, awesome retention, and incredible lacing. The smell is the expected citrus with notes of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is just right, not thick and not thin. The taste follows the nose. I get that familiar grapefruitiness up front followed by those incredible hops on the finish with a satisfying aftertaste. Buy this stuff and enjoy if you have never had it."

"another on of the mix six beers i picked up. almost forgot about the last two.poured into a new sam adams pint . orange in color with a nice thick fluffy head . after pouring a wonderful hoppy aroma and a bit of citrus. wonderful body to it. been a while since i had a nice hoppy beer like this. wonderfull beer from the nice folks down in delaware."

"O - It's not bad in the bottle but it does taste a lot better on tap. For an IPA I'd much rather have the 90 minute."

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of bready and caramel malt with a solid hit of citrusy old school hop aroma. The flavor is malty as advertised and cut with lots of grapefruity citrus and a bit of pine. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Still a solid beer, but I fear that I've wrecked my palette with so many double ipa's that this no longer does it for me."

"This is not a fantastic IPA (by today's standards), and it's not my favorite beer from Dogfish Head. But it's consistently tasty, drinkable, and interesting. I'm glad I finally sat down to review this."

"I've had this particular brew quite a few times, because I enjoy almost everything out of the Dogfish Head Brewery, and this is what started it all.... Though it's the bottom feeder out of their more common brews, it's an easy drink.... As I pour a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it develops a healthy, but lighter bubbly, head.... As you drink it, it leaves a few trails.... Not too many.... It has a light golden and almost orange appearance.... The nose of the beer has bready and yeasty notes with slight citrus.... The taste of the beer matches the nose.... It has a mostly yeasty and hoppy taste with slight citrus notes.... It leaves a very light, but pleasant aftertaste on your palate.... Always a good choice, even though most of Dogfish Head's brews are better."

"Final Thoughts: DFH's slogan is ""Off-centered ales for off-centered people."" While I understand what they mean, it's worth noting that there is nothing ""off-centered"" about this beer. It is supremely balanced. I usually tend to enjoy West Coast IPAs more, but the piney/roasty qualities in this East Coast IPA make it memorable. If DFH was distributed where I live, it would be a mainstay in my fridge."

""

""

"O - I have always enjoyed this beer, but it has become a staple in my fridge since moving to Delaware. Remarkable balance of full flavor and drinkability. Some may disagree, but I consider 60 minute to be light enough to be considered a session beer. The grapefruit flavor and bitterness make this one of my favorite year-round, readily accessible, single IPA's,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Surprisingly smooth and easy-drinking for an American IPA, but I expected a bolder hops flavor--the beer I tried leaned more toward malty sweetness than the aggressive hops I expected."

"Notes: I've never been a huge fan of these IPAs (a little too sweet and malty although I don't mind 120 for it being so different). Not too hoppy and has that caramel sweetness. Ok, and one I could drink now and then, but nothing I'd regularly get. Good choice for a so-so bar."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a sparkling gold with 1 finger head and lasting lace. The aroma is of grapefruit, lemon, and dough. The flavor has caramel and sweet malt notes with grapefruit and a mild hoppy bitterness. As it warms it all fades except the bitterness which leaves a mild aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is a decent brew, recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from 12oz bottle into a mug. Crystal clear, honey-colored yellow-orange with a thick foamy white head that leaves lots of lacing all over the glass. Smell is amazing; fresh flowers, citrus fruits and pine. Taste is smooth, with a great bitter hop finish that lingers on the back of your tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, it works well with the taste. Overall, this is my favorite regular IPA...beyond this point, only Imperial IPAs roam."

""

"60 minute pours a light bodied polished bronze in color with a two finger, very soapy bright white head. It sticks to the glass the way an IPA should. The nose is very hop forward yet balanced enough. There are citrusy and piney aromatics as well as enough caramel malt sweetness to not overpower you with hops. The flavors follow the same flavor profiles. There is plenty of malt to provide a sweetness that pairs well with the citrus and pine. It isn't overly dry either. It drinks lighter in body and in my opinion, is very sessionable. I've had this beer a million times but I can't turn it down. This is an all time favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful clear apple juice and piss color. It sits in the glass as golden with a little bit of orange and red tints. There is a light but steady stream of carbonation from the bottom and a gorgeous eggshell white head forms with big soapy bubbles that mellow into a half a finger’s width. The beer smells light and citrus/apple sweet with a nice faint tingle of grapefruit in the back of the smell and a solid pale malt backbone strongly running throughout the smell that gives it a biscuit-feel. The beer tastes wonderfully balanced with citrus bitters and bready malts. The taste is a little sweet and leaves a very sweet bitter-syrup feel in the mouth. The mouthfeel is quite velvety with the carbonation and a nice thinly oozing gel to the beer. It leaves the mouth very clean with a slight sheen of saliva and a dry feeling towards the back of the throat. Overall I may be a little bias to this beer. This was my introduction to a great IPA and will always have a special place in my heart. It is a very solid example of the style, and a wonderful introduction to hops and bitterness for anyone that is new to the craft beer world."

"O: I am admittedly a big fan of Dogfish Head beers in general and have enjoyed their 60 Minute (and 90 Minute) IPAs a number of times in the past. A couple weeks ago, I tried and reviewed their hybrid DIPA, 'Burton Baton' and my life was permanently, irrevocably changed. While it's not exactly fair to compare a 6% IPA like 60 Minute with a 10%, 70 IBU DIPA like Burton Baton, it's inevitable that my phenomenal recent experience with that beer will color my opinion of this one just a bit...thus my overall rating of 'only' 4.0. But in the world of 5 - 8% ABV India Pale Ales, 60 Minute IPA definitely stands on its own. :)"
""
""
""
""
"It pours nicely. Nice head and a nice IPA smell with a very apparent hops aroma (obviously). Upon tasting it you notice that there is a lot of carbonation and it has quite a good mouth feel. The flavor is strong in hops, and if you really like IPAs you will love this. It's bitter, and does not favor to my taste buds however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still bubbles a while after this tap pour. Golden in color and clear. Bead perisists nicely. Smell is hoppy and somehow distinctively Dogfish. Taste has maple syrup on the back end along with the tangy hops. For a hop lover this is a great session IPAD - a tad strong for session but mild for this style. An excellent beer!"

"O: For this being my first Dogfish Head, I came in with high expectations based on other reviews of this brewery. I can say that I wasnt disappointed. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but a very good version of the style. Cant wait to try some more from Dogfish Head, especially the 120 Min IPA which I will drink all 4 in succession!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ""60 minute"" part of the name comes from the fact that this brew is ""continuously hopped"" with Northwest Hops for an entire 60 minute boiling cycle. Dogfish Head also makes 90 & 120 minute IPAs as well. They are both heavier on the malt flavor, and the 120 minute is not available year round. I highly recommend this beer. Happy drinking!"
""
""
"M - Thin-to-medium body. Carbonation is strong, but not overbearing. Finish is dry and incredibly clean. Hot-damn I wish this was distributed in Iowa! One of the most drinkable beers I've had in recent memory."
""
""
""
"As soon as I pour it, I can already smell the citrus aroma. It has an amber body with a simple white head. As I take a real sniff of the beer, the citrus hops are in front with the malt behind. The hops are tasty without being overbearing. It's well carbonated and has a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice but a little bit watery. A well-done IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark gold into a pint glass, cream colored head and fine lacing. Scent of granny smith apples, citrus, and hops. Taste follows head with notes of grapefruit, apples, and hops, though it has a smooth buttery sort of a toffee-like note too, nice addition. Mouthfeel is thick for an IPA, and overall the brew goes down very smooth. Overall a solid IPA, nothing spectacular though certainly nothing lacking."

"Pours a clear and rustic yellow golden color under a dense white cap of foam. A great migration of carbon bubbles supports a thorough head. A crisp aroma of freshly grated lemon rind zest hints at the citrusy hops in waiting... Refined and delicious bitter and sweet citrusy waves quench the palate with a marvelous balance of hops and (possibly) pale malt. Classic DFH character for the masses of the IPA curious and ""off centered"" brethren alike. I've been on a hoptastic voyage with DFH 75, 90, and 120 min for the past couple of years and noticed that it had been too long since I'd poured a 60...Glad I did. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a hop devil pint glass. This is definitely one of the lighter colored, more unassuming IPAs by appearance, almost fooling me as a lager in appearance. Smooth, light, and citrusy in smell and almost a pleasant floral aroma. This ipa is one of the more pleasant to the palate and very session able!"
""
""
""
"Pours clear as a bell yellow, somewhat tannicky (sic) orange, with moderate head and plenty of patchy lacing. Malt nose first (interestingly), then only moderately bitterness afterwards, not much hoppiness up front too (inflect sorrow here). Some roasted notes along with the malts and bitterness is not well sustained as I would have expected from an IPA. Carbonation moderate and refreshingly scrubbing, slightly dry-ish and thin-ish. A well regarded brew, but not this bottle, I think representative of IPA I like...not much complexity in the hops... I guess I wanted more citrus and pine bitterness up front. I'd be happy to have one at the picnic, but it wouldn't be my contribution."

"Top level IPA here. Pours golden color with a big frothy white head and lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma of pine, lemon peel, sweet pale malts backing. Flavor follows with a nice up front bitter, lemon rinds, a little pine, and a sweet crisp citrus finish. Medium light mouthfeel, medium heavy carbonation, and very crisp on the finish. A nice representation of the style and one that I could keep coming back to."

"Overall: when it comes to ""go to"" IPA this is my number one with no questions asked. There isn't much you can ask for when drinking 60 it isn't made to impress it is made to satisfy, Salud!"
""
""
""
"This beer has a nice smell, I pick up the caramel malts as well as some fruity hop aromas on the nose, mainly orange zest. Yet it lacks something in the taste department. It's just a bit wattery tasting and a little too malty sweet for an IPA. When I drink an IPA I like just a touch of malt to balance out the hop bitterness, not a touch of hop bitterness to balance out the malt. It's not an awful beer by any means, but not quite worthy of such high praise. Funny thing is that I really used to like this one, now I just feel there are better options out there as far as IPA's go."

"This is one of the best balanced, smoothest beers I've had. Very VERY well crafted by the folks at dogfish head and absolutely worthy of the reputation that has been garnered. Quite drinkable; appropriately carbonated and immensely smoothe and sessionable for a beer that is 6% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you're a hophead, I'd say go elsewhere. This is better for a more all around beer drinker. Unoffensive, smooth, yet got enough hop flavor to swing its own weight as an IPA. Not bad."

"I prefer the cheap RED HOOK ipa Long Hammer over this beer. I love me some Dogfish but the 60 Ipa has a nasty after taste to me. It's def a pale ale and tastes like one. I think I even prefer the Sierra Nevada over this Dogfish :( Very disappointing and I have tasted better beers with an IBU of 60 or above. Two thumbs down :("
""
"I will gte Goose Island or Fullers instead."
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of the East coast style IPA. I love these for there balance and more old world hop profile. Well done DFH, now really wanting to try the 90 min. Wish we got this stuff here in MN, it would be more than welcome. Recommended to any fan of IPAs. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Not that bitter at entry. Brighter tastes at the beginning, with some citrus. Very effervescent. Hops are balanced with a malty sweetness at mid-palate. The finish leaves a medium amount of herbal bitterness and tang on the tongue. Leaves kind of a watery impression overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good IPA not because it is a hops explosion, rather because it is a complimentary blend of many hops flavors without much bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This Dogfish Head classic is definitely more on the bitter side compared to that of its predecessor, the 90 Minute. It is considerably less malty and a little bit more on the dry side. Having tasted both the Squall and the 90 numerous times, this bottle definitely offers stark differences that allow it to go a long way in making this stand out to a hardcore Hop-Head. For more bite and less malt, I would highly recommend the 60 Minute over the 90 Minute IPA. Dogfish does it again!"

"Big citrus flavor hits the mouth up front while bitter grapefruit and sweet orange dance in harmony. There is a cool refreshing mouth feel of grapefruit flesh - very nice. Malty bread notes follow in a nice balance. Then it finishes with a dry nutty/herbal punch. An excellent beer with lots going on. When paired with spicy foods more sweet notes come out. When paired with sweet foods more bitter notes come out. This seems to have layers of bitterness that come out at different times."

"Pours a cloudy orange color with a large white head and lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrusy and floral, perhaps some grapefruit and pine as well. Taste starts off with sweet grapefruit followed by caramel malts and ends with a spicy bitterness. Finishes dry. Medium bodied and smooth."

"Pours a clear, light amber color with a bubbly cream colored head. The scent of hops is strong with this beer, just as expected. The taste is smooth, refreshing, and deliciously hoppy. Other than the hops, there is a great blend of citrus and oaky flavors. Has nice bready after taste that leaves a good wet feeling opposed to a dry finish.

"I just LOVE Dogfish Head beer. This is truly heaven in a bottle. This is not one of those over-the-top IPA's where all you get is bitterness where a brewery creates the high IBU count at the cost of other characteristics. This is a very nice balanced IPA. Pours a nice golden color with LOTS of head and lacing. If you like Bell's Two Hearted you are going to absolutely love this one. I live in Iowa and unfortunately can't get this one here so when I stop in Illinois at Binny's, I am sure to stock up on this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

"Golden pale and crystal clear. Fluffy white head sticks around a while. Aroma is a bouquet of grapefruit, orange, pinapple. Bitterness really hits with the first sip, but its not overpowering. Just right. This is the IPA benchmark. Smooth malt perfectly balanced with pungent american hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden color with bits of yeasties floating about. Nice milk froth head, superb lacing, and copious amounts of carbonation. Very mild aroma of hops and pine.

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice light amber with a 2 finger white head that dissipates slowly leaving a small head with nice lacing. Smells of flowery hops and light malt, a little weak, but not too bad. Tastes of earthy and slight citrus hops dominates, light malt, and the balance is great for an IPA. It is a nice medium body with perfect carbonation and very sessionable. Overall, a very good IPA. One that should be a standby for all hopheads."

"O: This is a quintessential American IPA and one that really got me into better beers several years ago. The beer is not extremely flavorful or bold but nails the style quite well. I much prefer the slightly ballsier 90 min IPA but I do drink this one more often. A classic brew and one of the best ubiquitous IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""

"O- Although I feel Indian Brown Ale is the unsung flagship brew from Dogfish Head, 60 Minute IPA is awesome and can clearly see its strong following. Assuming you get it fresh (within 90-110 days of ""bottled on"" date), then you are sure to quaff a delectable brew. As soon as a fresh batch arrives, you can bet that I have a 6'er in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorite IPA's, this one will not disappoint. It's very well done, and a great beer for anyone interested in the style (who isn't?). While there are plenty out there that offer more bite, this one is a perfect ""everyday"" IPA."

"Poured a clear, pale amber into a pint glass. There was a two finger creamy, off white head. There was a lot of visible carbonation. A moderate amount of hoppiness with a little bit of malt sweetness on the nose. I noticed notes of grass, caramel and pear. This is a clean tasting bear, with a decent amount of hoppiness, mostly on the backend. A little citrus. This bear had good carbonation and decent mouthfeel. Overall I was a little disappointed by this beer, although a good example of an IPA there was nothing that really stood out to me as a true strong point."
""
""
""
""
"Mildly carbonated and crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice copper color with an average white head that lasted but left no lacing. Great hop smells of lemon, grapefruit, and flowers. Light sniff of malts. Great IPA taste with grapefruit, spice, and fruits that left a nice bitter tingle. Smooth medium body."

"O- DFH really knows how to make IPAs. The 60 isn't nearly as strong or sweet as their 90 or 120 (reviewing after having both about a hour before), but has a nice balance between the flavors. Not the most spiced or hopped IPA I've had, but a nice balance between all the flavors that is easily drinkable. Definitely recommended, not my favorite IPA but definitely up there."

""
""

""

"O - Solid beer, I wouldn't rule out buying a dinner six pack of this."

The pour was great highly carbonated nice 1 inch lace, smell is of citrus notes out of this world The taste I will say nothing I will let it speak for itself. Mouthfeel is WOW!! Overall please try this brew if you can it is amazing!!!:)"

"T: A lot of hop bitterness, but the hop flavor doesn't have a ton of depth. A lot of pine hop bitterness and biscuity malt. A pretty solid IPA, just not as interesting as a lot of others out there."

"O: I enjoyed this beer. It is really refreshing and there is apsolutely nothing unpleasant about it. I would, however, like the taste to be a little more centered around the hops. The toastiness was the main flavor component in my opinion."

"O: very enjoyable IPA. Next time I'll buy a 6 pack"

"O: Balance. The idea of continual hopping is to preserve the hop flavor while preventing the hop astringency. Sam does a swell job with this one. Anxious to try the 90 and 120."
"Pours a light clear light copper/orange with a 2 finger head and a fair amount of head and retention. Slight grapefruit, mango and peach on the nose, with a nice caramel malt backbone. Citrus and malt bang on the tongue, grassy and earth with a nice bitter finish. Light to medium on body, medium carbonation that gives a tingly champagne feel, that ends sweet and bitter. Overall DFH 60 is a typical ""East Coast"" IPA, its big on malt even when fresh, and has nice hop characteristics to boot. Good beer, always available, but not knocking any socks off."

"This is a nicely balanced IPA. It is a pretty copper color with a light tan head. Nice hoppy and caramel smell. The taste is a little piney, with a malt hoppiness and a touch of sweetness. It has a good mouthfeel and all in all is a very drinkable IPA."

"Based on the reviews here, I was expecting this to be a little better. To me, it's just your average craft IPA, although I thought the nutty start was a nice touch. I'm not a huge fan of piney beers though (I tend to prefer black lagers with smokey nutty flavors), not sure why I hoped this would be different. It's a solid IPA, a little on the expensive side, but perhaps I was just expecting a little too much from the hype."

"O - This is a very nice IPA offering from Dogfish Head. The flavor brings a nice profile of floral and grassy hops that I don't get enough of in many other IPA's. The drinkability is very high with this beer, which is pretty sessionable for an IPA considering its 6% ABV. Although this particular beer isn't my favorite IPA, it really is a great example and interpretation of the style nonethess."

""

"Well, damn I can't knock 60 minute at all. A very solid though not impressive of distinct IPA. If you've bored with the 5-10 easy to get cheap/cheaper IPAs on the shelves, mix it up with a 60 minute. I have a feeling every 2-3 years I might have to come back to this one."

"Overall: This is a great IPA, it has a very unique character. It may be on the light side in terms of alcohol level and color, but it delivers on all fronts in grand IPA form. It is incredible that there is only 6% abv on such a hoppy and full bodied beer. Absolutely sessionable, and absolutely a hophead pleaser."

"O: A fairly standard IPA for me. Just north of average, but good nonetheless."

"O - Its a great example of the east coast IPA. The hops and malts are nice and balanced and I could actually session this beer. Its not the best out there, but its really damn good. This beer is one of my favorites, even when its a month old. After messing around with sam adam sampler packs, this was the beer that drove the nail into the craft coffin for me.

"Overall: This one surprised me, perhaps because I have been tasting a lot of DIPAs lately but this beer seemed rather subdued for the style. A light and bitter IPA with a surprisingly prominent malt (super hopped amber ale?). A well balanced IPA that doesn't really stand out in the extreme playground that is IPAs."

"Didn't know what to expect at first, figured it would be really hoppy. Certainly don't need to drink a lot of these to get the job done. Pours out a dark color and is obviously a heave beer. Had a good taste to it though and didn't leave a bitter taste in your mouth after. Was pretty impressed."

"the ale heard 'round the world! famous for a reason the 60 minute is a delicious concotion of hop additions and pale malts. smells very earthy and organic, elemental for a beer, more than the sum of its parts, but definitely not distinct from them. taste more like a west coast ipa, but made in deleware. huge hop profile in the flavor, but not to the point of being overwhelming. its highly drinkable and belongs next to the very best single american ipas on the market. has a fuller body and robust carbonation, which also make it memorable. bready hoppy finish sparkling with gusto make this beer one of the alltime classics. worthy of its high praise"

"Rather than state why I love this beer so much, which I obviously do, I'll simply say this: PLEASE BRING IT BACK TO TENNESSEE! Pulling out inventory this summer was a dark day in the state's history. I've struggled to find any IPA that matches Dogfish 60's taste, aroma and overall drinkability."
""
"A quality IPA, best served ice cold in a pint glass. Good color, crisp head. Hoppy, but not too hoppy. Served at our Christmas party annually - well received by even the not so sophisticated beer drinkers. The ABV doesn't overwhelm you. You rarely pour a bad 60 Minute IPA!"

"First impressions.. fruity whiff upon opening, bleachy smell up close.. not bad though. Tastes a bit like peach, slightly sweet, very smooth. Not too bitter at all. I'm not a huge hophead, so don't normally go after IPA's but I would make an exception for this one. It's the best IPA I've tried so far."
""
"M: very straight bitter sensation nothing too complex with almost no sweetness since the start to the end is bitterness and with a lasting ending."
""
""
""
""
"I had this very popular IPA long ago and forgot about it, then revisited it the other day and I am glad I did. It reminds me that there is hope in the beer world. Beers that are popular with the masses are for a reason, and not just because of all the hype. This is unique balance of toasty maltiness blend with a fine wave of bitterness to make it something special. Very good sessionable IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad IPA, but I won't buy this again. I realize it's no IIPA, but it's a little bland for the price. For just a few bits more, I'm sure there are far better IPAs available in your area (personally, I'd opt for Bells Two-Hearted Ale or Founders Centennial)."

"Overall, this is an excellent IPA, and while it's big brother--Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA--has been called ""perhaps the best IPA in America," 60 Minute IPA offers many of the same flavors at a lower cost per bottle, and is likely far more accessible to someone unfamiliar with strong IPAs. As a whole the beer is well-crafted and delicious, and should be on any hop-head's ""must try"" list."

"this is a standard bearer of a beer. If you want to know what an american IPA is all about, a dogfish 60 is a perfect example"
"On the east coast this is a very easy ""get."" Pick up a six pack next time you are out. Do it as a favor to Sam for all his effort."
"Dogfish, as noted by about 2,000 other beer reviewers, totally nailed this one. Nothing new to report here. If you haven't already, buy, barter, or trade to check this one out."
"O: This is a fantastic IPA. The citrus, pine, and malt play off of each other perfectly. 60 min is the quintessential east coast IPA."
"A classic east coast IPA that is still deliciously hoppy. So it doesn't shave tastebuds off your tongue, so what? A solid IPA nonetheless."
"Very interesting taking on an IPA, and it's interesting to get further acquainted with the East Coast style. I do find myself craving some more hop aromatics to accompany the bitterness."
"Overall: I've probably had this at least a hundred times, usually on draft, and generally enjoyed it. Last few times I've bought it, I didnt care for it much because of the grainy smell/flavor I've noted above. I assumed it was old beer, but this six pack is fresh and its got the same problem. I guess I dont like this beer too much."
"Excellent beer for $9 per 6 pack. If I see this one fresh, I'll be grabbing it again!"
"Classic IPA"
"O-- My favorite DFH beer. Not the sexiest or all that crazy in the DFH sense but this is just a solid, easy to drink IPA. Well balanced and the right touches of bitterness to keep me interested and wanting more. Solid, solid beer."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Lighter bodied with moderate carbonation; fairly smooth drinking but not outstanding. Overall, this is a very solid IPA, one of the classics. Not mind blowing, but good and something I would love to have access to full time."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it's a great beer and a classic American version of the style. I especially love the aroma. It's not the best of the style, but it's a great everyday drinking, affordable and delicious beer overall."
"O: One of my favorite IPA's. I would recommend this to any hop head as it is much more hoppier than the 90 and 120, with a little less bite."
"o - my type of IPA - balanced flavors!"
"What a difference fresh makes! DFH 60 wasn’t my first IPA or the beer that taught me to love hops or anything like that, but it is the beer that taught me the importance of checking for a bottled-by date. And with good reason. From the tap—which I can only assume/hope makes it fresh—this comes out a wonderful golden-amber color that’s just hoppy, crisp and floral to the nose and palate. It’s a solidly delicious IPA—but get it fresh, fresh, fresh. Otherwise you’re paying for the brand, not the quality beverage inside those bottles."
"I think this is a very solid beer. It's not as heavy as some of the other dogfish head beers, so it should be no problem putting away the whole 6 pack if you wanted too. The only thing I don't like is the low alcohol content. The 90 min may only come in a 4 pack, but that's all you need at 9 % for each. I think the 60 min is a good beer, and is very nice especially if your trying to drink something lighter."
"O- Not as much abv as many in the field. always enjoyable. It seems to be on the shelf of any beer aisle I go down."

"A lot of people are passionately for or against DFH. I feel that some of their beers are good and some are just misses. I don’t give a Schlitz for this particular brew."
"O: Extremely drinkable and well crafted with some nice flavors. Often overlooked (by me, at least) due to its ubiquity, I can see having this in the regular rotation."
"This IPA was amazing. I think I would like this brew slightly warmed up to get more pine out of it. It's not too powerful that one will knock you out, but if I had a whole six-pack of this I would consider drinking them all in one sitting. Dogfish Head simply does not disappoint."
"O - This is a nice American IPA. Thie pretty much started the whole big time craft beer scene as far as IPAs go. That being said, nowadays there are better American IPAs out there."
"Very clean throughout, mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Goes down smooth with accompanied by the cooling sensation of the hops. Very nice IPA. Now I just have to try and Great Divides Titan IPA side by side to see which I prefer."
"O: A regular in my fridge. Always has been, always will be."
"D - Great hop flavor and bitterness without burning my tastebuds off. Dangerously drinkable."
"Easy drinking and very flavorful IPA. Lives up to all the hype surrounding DFH IPA's. Perfect sessions ale and a must-try for every hop head. Enough said....just go ahead and enjoy it."
"Overall: By far my favorite IPA. Not too much carbonation so that the flavors come through nicely. I like this beer and will definitely be buying it again. yum!"
"O- One of the best single IPAs I have had. Distinctive IPA."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a dark yellow, with a sticky white head, plenty of lacing. Smell is peach, pineapple, mango, grass, and pine. Taste is all that, the finish is grassy. Very easy to drink, with plenty of life. This is a very good a IPA and easy to get your hands on. Date on this one, bottled on 9/23/11 fresh, thanks DFH."
"On draft at the Coffee District. Just a solid IPA, would recommend this beer to any IPA drinker. Nice lacing. Aroma is of rich, fruity hops - citrus, grapefruit, and mango. Caramel malt comes through a bit along with some breadiness - kind of bread crust-like. Flavor is of clementine, lemon, and grapefruit with some pine. The malt is lighter than in the aroma - mainly caramel malt and light toast. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pleasantly sweet with a pronounced hop bitterness at the end. Lingering, bitter finish with a touch of resin that avoids being unpleasant. Overall a really great IPA that is solid and repeatable."
"I'm not an IPA person for the most part, but this is one IPA that I'll always reach for. Go buy a pint, 6 pk, or a case... it's a keeper"
"Verdict: All around well made beer. It won’t knock your socks off but makes for a really great beer that is widely available. Definitely worth getting."
"I couldn't taste the alcohol in this and even though it's not a true session beer, this would be easy to enjoy multiple time in one sitting. This isn't like its West Coast counterparts but if I had never tried an IPA before, this would be the one I'd ideally start with. It wasn't metallic, too dry, or enough to knock me into next week. Understated can be great and his beer is proof of that. Why haven't you seen it for yourself?"
"i wonder what happened to my old review for this? oh well. this was a pleasure to try again and it makes me wonder why i don't buy this stuff more often. this just goes to show you that you don't need a be a hyped up, small-time craft brewery to put out a good quality IPA in large quantities. recommended."
"This is a very good IPA. A bit overpriced in my opinion, but certainly a beer you'd go back to again."
"O - A refreshing, balanced IPA. Good example of the style without any harshness."
"Overall a nice beer. Like I said before, a good introductory IPA, not very bitter or intense. However the aroma and taste indicate a good amount of citrus and floral. Thank you dry hopping."
"O: great IPA, can't believe I've never had this one. It's so readily available that I pass it up every time. Would be great to just drink and sit out on the porch."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma, but the flavor is at least somewhat balanced, with the complex combination of spicy, citrusy (orange), and must hop characteristics being complemented by a noticeable biscuity malt base. Overall, its as advertised a very good IPA."
"Overall: This is a very good go to IPA. Always nice to see this at a sports bar. Smooth with a very good bitterness level."
"Overall: Wonderful. Well balanced. Malts upfront followed by citrus hops. No lingering bitterness whatsoever."
"O - A beautifully made beer. Just wish there were more aromatic hops is all. It is a great beer on a hot day like today. I think everybody can enjoy this beer. As terrible as it sounds, I think you could drink this beer from the bottle and it wouldn't hurt the experience too much. This could be my go to beer where I can't decant."
"Overall: This is the perfect beer for any occasion and mood. It has a nice color and it's not too light or too bitter on the palate. Great for just relaxing on the couch with the wife or for a party. I believe most people would enjoy it no matter if they like IPA's or not. This is my go to beer without a doubt. Cheers!"
"O: I really like it. Sufficiently different from the 90 Minute as to allow the drinker to forget that the 60 is an inferior brew. Spicy and delicious. Recommended. Deserved Dogfish Head's flagship."
" Overall A solid IPA.Great on a hot day in the 114 degree heat Of Vegas. Could down a sixer no prob!"
"Dogfish 60 min is a great IPA. Now it's pretty much a classic for IPA's. Hoppy with spice and citrus flavors and a nice copper color. The beer is just so drinkable. 6% abv is perfect for this style. I must say though, I miss the Shelter Pale ale. There's nothing like a lower alcohol highly hopped beer!"
"D - A fine American IPA. It is well balanced and highly drinkable. I wouldn't mind coming back to this one again and again."
"Overall this is a pretty standard for the style, but nothing that I would purchase in large quantity. Very drinkable, but just not quite what I look for in a good IPA."
"Another tasty IPA from Dogfish head, pours, an opaque amber color with a persistent white head. The nose is fairly typical of IPAs from this brewer with hints of citrus and spice. The taste is solid malty, hoppy, and sweet. The 60 minute does have a little bitterness to it that lends it some bite (unlike the 90 and 120 minute IPAs from Dogfish). Overall a good beer well worth drinking."
"Overall: an excellent citrus and pine hopped ipa. One of my favorites."
"O: This is a great IPA. I love it. Love it. love it. And...I make sure all my friends get one whenever they are in an area that carries it, as we don't get it in TN."
"O: a great IPA, one of the classics, highly drinakbale and has come to define the style as the standard by which other IPAs are held. just an overall well rounded brew that hits high on each level"
"Again, it's not bad but it's also not worth really seeking out. Try it and measure it against your IPA favorites. I did and found it came out squarely in the 2nd tier."
"Overall- I like this beer, but prefer the 90 minute."
"60 Minute is respectable, and would have gotten a better review from me back in 2006... but times change, the bar is raised, and now it's simply a quirky, well-put together IPA that isn't exactly my cup of ale."
"Orange-copper color with a large, fluffy off-white head and good lacing. Aroma is strong grassy, herbal and citrus hops. Bitter hop flavor is nice, but very drying. Definitely some pine in there too. This beer is more powerful than the 60 IBUs indicate. Not as refined as the 90 minute, by any means. Much more of an ""in your face"" style. I prefer something with a little more malt backbone, but if you’re really into hops this is a very good beer."
"very balanced ipa. im not a fan of malt but this baby has a perfect balance of hops and malts. just as the hops hit you the malts pull back and give great balance. at 6% very easy to throw a few back! great intro ipa to break people into the style. sam should be damn proud of this one. bought case 9/3 bottled on 8/17. very fresh."
"O - A really good IPA."
"O - Overall... I really expect more outta this ipa, almost like a IPA light. I don't know, but is this really how east coast ipa is? I sure hope not. Please add more aroma and bittering hops. Does this style have only a single hop variation?"
"This is, in my opinion, one of the best AIPAs out there. As such, it is a great benchmark by which to judge other beers in this category. The mouthfeel is practically perfect and the flavors and aroma are well-balanced, complex, and delicious. There really aren't too many beers, not to mention AIPAs, that are this well crafted."
"Amazing beer from DFH. Dark golden color with a nice off white head that stuck around longer than I expected. Loved the aroma on this one, lots of hops and grapefruit. The taste was about the same, great. I was surprised to find that it wasn't extremely bitter but had a lot of citrus flavor to it. Obviously one of my favorite beers."
"This beer finishes with a dry aftertaste with a light bit of the citrus coming through this medium bodied beer with a pretty good mouthfeel to it also."
"Poured from 12oz bottle with bottled on 8/9/11 on the side into pint glass. Pours clear copper with a small white head great lacing. Smells of big citrusy hops. Tastes of huge hops, grapefruit and mandarin oranges come to mind with a nice malty finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation are pretty good for a session beer. Overall great beer I could drink a few of these back to back."
"Overall: An amazing IPA. 90 minute IPA is still one of my all-time favorites, but this is the lesser overwhelming brother of that beer due to it's lower ABV and hoppiness - which makes it something that can be drunk more often rather than from time to time as a treat. Great stuff once again from Dogfish Head."
"D: one of my favorite east coast AIPA's. a very drinkable go-to that is easy to find where im from. glad im finally writing a review for this sucker!"
"O-an excellent IPA with nice balance and finish"
"Overall this is a very solid IPA, refreshing, crisp with a bitter bite."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass, The head was low, and quickly dissipated. In natural light, the beer has a golden to light amber hue. An immediate hop aroma greets you after pouring, but seems to back off after the first sip or two, a good amount of bitterness on the tongue, decent carbonation, very little lacing. Behind the bitterness, there is a interesting malt character, something I would expect from a darker member of this style. Overall, I think this is a good IPA."
"This is a commendable beer because it's been around for a while, tastes great, and I think it would please both the beer geek and the beer novice. One of the better east coast IPAs, and a must try for any enthusiast. A true classic."
"Cheers"
"O- Impressed with it and will have another!"
"Pours light golden with nice light wide head. Very hoppy aroma, but not overpowering. Taste is pretty smooth, hops seem to fade as the beer warms, a little bit of citrus in the background, perhaps. Crisp and well-carbonated, seems to fall somewhere between a sipper and a guzzler. Good drink, goes great with Indian food."
"Darkish golden pour with a thin white head. Aroma is loaded with citrus and pine hops, with some sweet, fruity overtones. Tastes slightly sweet at first, with orange, lemon, and grapefruit flavors. Finishes somewhat dry and bitter, with a nice pine and citrus kick. Good mouthfeel and carbonation."
"O: Excellent go to IPA of choice. One of my favorites."
"O - My go to for AIPA, a true classic"
"Update: I visited the brewery in summer 2012. It's a recommended destination for those who go to the Delaware beachers. Ont he tour, I learned that the 75 is essentially a blend of the 60 and 90."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma, but the flavor is at least somewhat balanced, with the complex combination of spicy, citrusy (orange), and must hop characteristics being complemented by a noticeable biscuity malt base. The light, active carbonation cuts through the bitterness and helps this one go down quite easily. Overall, although ""balanced' compared to many hop-bomb IPAs, this beer still has an enjoyable, striking, complex bitterness, and it rightfully sits as a gold standard among IPAs being produced on the East coast."
"Poured on-tap into a pint glass, the beer is a bright orange-gold color with a thin, filmy layer of head. Good aromas of wet hops, slightly sweet and resinous. The beer's flavor is a sweet caramel malt backbone with a heavy dose of pepper-spiced hops and grapefruit balance. The aftertaste is citrus tart and hops bitter, again very well balanced. The finish is crisp and dry. It leaves the palate extremely clean, and is an extremely well put together brew. Very tasty."
"O - Overall this is an excellent example of an American IPA. Not fancy or frilly, but unique. I like to say that this IPA gives you everything you expect from an IPA and more. Highly recommend."
"I declare 60-Min a classic deserving its own statue like Rocky has in Philly. But with beer, and no marbles in its mouth."
"O - One of my go to beers. Great sessionable beer that really refreshes you when you need it. Will always go back to this one."
"O- An IPA that packs that bitterness but also lots of maltiness. Not my favorite IPA, lacks the sweetness I would like in a maltier IPA, but still a nice beer with a very nice mouthfeel."
"O: kind of disappointing after enjoying 90 minute many times. Will pass on it in the future. Bottled 3 weeks prior to tasting and should not have lost it's flavor this soon"
"O: I've had this many times, it's as good as I remember it. Not my favorite IPA but a very good example of the style."
"O- Such a well balanced beer. I love the dogfish head IPA's because they are able to give you all the hop flavor while still making the beer perfectly balanced and extremely drinkable. Awesome IPA"
"T: good biterness, biscuit falvour, earthy on mouth, semi crisping on tongue"
"O: I don't get this one. It's a fairly fresh bottle that has been stored in a fridge. It's basically a poorly made IPA in my eyes. No malt character what so ever. The hops seem old and almost bad (not much good flavor out of it), unpleasant esters, and way too noticeable alcohol. I'm seriously confused how this gets such great marks. I was hugely disappointed in my first homebrew (red IPA) and this is honestly no better!"
"Medium bodied with a nice sticky texture. Finishes only somewhat dry with the bitterness holding up all the way through. A fine beer from DFH and quite the sessionable IPA."
"The IPA that got me into this whole craft beer money drainer. The color is a light amber orange, a little bit of head that goes down to nothing almost. Fair amount of lacing but nothing too extreme. The nose is outstanding. Floral and fruits notes. Little to no malt present. The taste is what gets me. Creamy mouthfeel. A little sweet with a rush of hops and malt. Almost perfect balance. My favorite single IPA that I can get in Georgia. Well done DFH."
"Finally got my order filled for my keg and the wait was worth it. This is one of the best east coast american IPAs I've had. Nice color, great foam and a taste and quality delivered by few beers I've had. My biggest issue is with getting my orders filled timely and you can't back order"
"I had this on 06-02-11, six weeks old, which I prefer an ipa to be 3 to 4 weeks old. This one may have been a little past prime but still very enjoyable."
"O - Overall this beer is very good, a bit heavier for an IPA at 6%"
"Not my favorite IPA from DFH, but that's because I prefer their more intense DIPAs. Overall, this is a decent beer; one that I come back to time and time again."
"Anyway, solid, and safe beer to order if you don't see an IPA that you like (or with a date on it for that matter). Solid A to lower A rating."
"O: Not my favorite...but still something I could drink a few of. A unique IPA to say the least, with a crisp bitterness and a nice sweet woody malt backbone."
"When poured into a glass, it has a nice copper color body with a 2 inch white creamy head, that hangs around for a while. The smell is very nice of hops. The taste starts off nice of hops then the well balance of malt come in last. This has a great mouth feel, good carbonation and smooth on the tongue. Overall this is a dam good beer."
"It pours a rich amber body with a creamy white head. The smell is of resinous hops. The taste is much more. It starts out with a bright candy hop up front then blends into a light biscuit malt taste going down. Unique in its own right among IPAs for this flavor profile, I love it. It is extremely drinkable and it pairs well with almost any food. A staple in my fridge."
"Note: Reviewed and enjoyed on 4/21/2008."
"A very enjoyable beer that goes down easy, and to me is a perfect session beer. A high recommendation for this classic IPA. Really easy to drink, moderate ABV, and excellent flavor, so grab a few."
"Pours a nice clear light golden color with a 2 finger head, okay retention and it leaves a decent lacing. The smell is a combination of hops and malts, the hops definitely don't overpower the malts. The feel is medium nice carbonation. The taste is good, a little bitter up front followed by a wave of malts and then an nice bitter after flavor. As it warms up a bit there is a definite alcohol flavor. Overall a good IPA, nice amount of hops and use of malts, I still prefer the over hopped stuff. (Oddly I prefer the Indian Brown Ale, if I'm drinking DFH which is even sweeter, so maybe I'm a hypocrite)."
"o-this is a beautiful example of an ipa. I can't wait to try the 90 and 120 minute."
"60 min is medium-light bodied, refreshing, and delicious."
"O - The low ABV, light body, and the decent balance of sweet and bitter make this a good quality beer. It is fairly accessible to most people but will still please the enthusiasts out there."
"The appearance of this beer was golden with good lacing and a decent head. the smell was pine, fresh, and the forest. Loved it. Initial taste matched the smell as the best IPA I've yet had. Great balance of hops without being super bitter despite the crazy amount of hops used during brewing, fermentation, and so on. Closest beer to perfect I've ever had! Well done DFH!"
"A lovable beer that offers exceptional drinkability"
"D: One of my favorite offerings from DFH. Easy to have more than one. Highly recommended to those that have yet to try this brew."
"Prosit!!"
"I have had this beer a bunch of times, but not in quite a while, and this is the first time I have evaluated it. Pours a clear yellow golden color with a very frothy two finger head that leaves a bit on the glass as it goes down. Citrusy hops on the nose along with a bit of fruit from the malt. Flavor follows suit with a nice dry finish and substantial bit of hop bitterness, but not over the top. I like the fact that this beer is only 6% and on the low end of most American IPA's these days. I think this is what is keeping it dry on the palate as well. Great example of an American IPA."
"O: I've had this beer many times, but ever since the Brewmaster program, I can't seem to get any fresh. It's like my market is buying up old stuff. Can't hate too much, as I've loved this beer many times in the past, and hope to review this again once I have something fresh."
"O: Great beer. Staple for any fridge!"
"O: A decent IPA. Flavor profile similar to Sierra Nevada, yet more bitter and thinner. A solid B - B+. Nice enough brew, but doesn't quite make my rotation. No comparison with heavyweights like Stone's offerings."
"Overall: I haven't had an IPA in a couple of years because I disliked them. I decided to try one again because I've developed a bit more taste for beer recently. I've gotta say that this beer has won me over. I'll definitely be drinking IPA's now."
"O-I do enjoy this. I am still trying to get used to the burnt/toasted taste to it. But overall this is one of the better beers a have drank. Not one I could drink for hours at a time, but definitely one I can enjoy one or two of."
"It is a clean, crisp, easy beer to drink and I will definatly throw it in the rotation again and pick it up from time to time."
"O - Quality product with a lot of character."
"A soon to be classic. Those looking to introduce their buddies to a readily available craft beer should look no further."
"This beer pours a light light orange color with a fluffy white head by lasts. The smell is wonderful pine and citrus hops with a sling malty finish. The flavor follows suit with a nice combo o hop flavors up front followed by a nice hop bitterness and finished with a light malt flavor to bring it all back in. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with good carbonation. Overall one of my favorite American ipas"
"Syrupy yet with lasting bitterness, really clings to the tongue. Delicious. I could drink this all day."
"Overall, simply divine IPA. I like this one more than the 90 as it's less sweet and sugary. In Stone's league for my favorite IPA."
"Taste is strong citrus, with hints of orange peel. This is an IPA that has very little bitterness, yet remains smooth and well-hopped. A beauty."
"overall: get this fresh as its vastly different and much better when consumed. this is a staple at my house and while it may not be the best IPA out there it can certainly hold its own in saying it's one of the better ones."
"O - This is a great sessionable IPA. Definitely my go to when I want to drink a lot. An overall amazing IPA for me."
"O - I have always enjoyed 60min, just not as much as 90min. It is light and easy drinking. When fresh like this one, it is very hard to beat."
"O: Good example of the style."
"O-When I first had this beer I loved it, I have since had a bunch of IPAs and while this is decent it isn't the best the world has to offer."
"O: Great beer, really only lacking in the aroma category."
"D: Balanced enough to drink the six pack, but not one of my favorite IPAs"
"At Hollywood Studios in Disney and was having dinner at the italian joint tucked back in the corner for dinner. Had a 60min Dogfish Head IPA that was quite good. The color was a pale amber with a thin almost non-exisitent head. The smell was not what I expected...a little weak...thought there would have been more. The taste however was really good. Hints of pine and citrus tickle the tongue. A nice malt flavor helped to balance this beer. This beer is very easy on the buds and could definitely session this beer. Worth a shot!!!"
"Caught this one a little old but the flavors and balance are there. Felt much like a highly hopped ESB, and while not my favorite style the lemon and light grape characteristics set this one apart. Without them this is just another balanced IPA."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and easy to drink. Overall not my favorite IPA but not bad."
"O. A classic brew from Dogfish Head, this and Founder's Breakfast Stout really got me going in the craft beer world, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I like it's older brother 90 better, but 60 is an excellent beer and a good representation of the style. It's also one of the ones I recommend to those just beginning to shy away from macro brews in search of better beer."
"Deep golden, poured a nice generous 1.5 inch head into my Ikea 12 oz tumbler. Smell is wonderful herbaceuos, piney, glorious hops. Head definitely lingers. The taste is a bit sweet for me, must be the malty aftertaste but nevertheless I would never push this beer out of my bed. A few more swigs and tastes reveals a dark seedy underside of bitterness in this beer. I not the fairly generous lacing. Definitely a medium bodied IPA, very rich frothy foam sticks around. Overall a very good example of an East Coast American IPA and explains why Dog Fish Head continues to be successful. Cheers."
"Overall it's a hit, as usual for most of DFH's offerings."
"O: many other reviewers have said Dogfish 60 minute is a beer to keep in the fridge at all times, and I concur. I like it better than the 90-minute, actually, because of it's extraordinary drinkability and lower price; similar in character to Smuttynose ""Finest Kind," IPA, and that's good! I give a slight edge to Dogfish 60 though."
"Overall: Excellent IPA. Maybe not the best of the best, but this is most definitely a staple of the style and cannot be overlooked. Refreshing, chock full of good flavor, and most definitely a keeper in the fridge if you can get a hold of it and are a fan of the IPA style."
"O: Wonderful continually hopped IPA. This was my second time drinking this beer and I was much more impressed this time. This is something I would like to have in my fridge at all times."
"This is a nice IPA that isn't powerful. The flavor balance is very good."
"PS - I have read where a lot of people enjoy the 90 minute better than this beer yet I found this one much more tasty. The 90 minute is much thicker and malt forward, it comes off almost too sweet. The 60 minute is perfectly balanced and actually tastes like an IPA."
"60 Minute pours a nice golden color with a couple fingers of white head. The nose offers some pungent hop aromas that are pretty fresh smelling. The taste is light grapefruit, apricot, and some malts that create a nice nutty finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a dry finish. Overall, this is an all around, any time, any day, IPA."
"Overall: Perfectly ""good."" Not mind-blowing, but definitely worth the price tag."
"Overall: This is really the gold standard in my opinion for East Coast American IPAs. While the West Coast produces great hop bombs, DFH has made a very sessionable, drinkable IPA with great hops flavors. A classic and one of my favorites."
"Overall, a very easy bitter drinker."
"All around this one has a really bready and biscuity nature to it compared to alot of IPAs. This one has both resinous and citrus hops characteristics in it and finishes on the dryer side, but the bready aspect stays fairly prominant throughout. Not very bitter as far as IPAs go these days, i have had a few Pale Ales that are just as bitter and hoppy. Kinda questioning the bottles age, but i have had this one many many times before and never fell in love with it."
"This beer accomplishes a very fine balance that is perfect to me, bitter, citrusy, clean with a slight sweetness to balance the hops."
"O: Very good IPA overall. The glass is laced with foam. One of my go to beers."
"Color is a nice golden orange with a modest but fairly short-lived head. Scents of grapefruit, pear, and pine stand out; a very pleasant smell. The taste is much like the scent, with a subtle grapefruit and pear up front, but with a big bite of piney bitterness toward the finish. The pine really dominates the flavor, perhaps a bit too much so for my tastes. Finish is very dry. Not the best IPA I've had lately, but an all around good one."
"Light golden color, big bubbly white head. Aromas are light as well, with a good hop presence. Flavor is crisp and clean, light malt front with a big piney hop finish. Pleasant bitterness. Every time I drink this beer, it seems less hoppy, don't know if its my palate changing or the beer. A solid standby in my fridge, and always fresh since it sells out weekly at all of my local shops."
"Overall-Very good IPA, not my favorite, but very refreshing and drinkable. Will never turn one down."
"O - I rated this both on the experience last night and prior tastings. I would have had to give it a lower rating based on last night, but having poured it into a glass from a fresh bottle in the past, I was able to rate it accordingly. This is a great beer, and not to be passed up."
"overall - up until now, i haven't been super crazy about IPA's. then again, i also haven't had a lot of experience with them, so maybe i'm just getting more used to the bitterness. either way, this beer is damn delicious. i think i just became a hophead. i almost wish this was MORE bitter. the flavor was great, it was really well balanced...i might have found a new favorite."
"O-Although i did enjoy this beer, it definitely was not my favorite IPA. But that still does not mean it is worth drinking it is still a very good beer, i just would pick other IPA's."
"O: Plain and simple, I love this beer"
"Overall: I'm not typically one who enjoys citrusy beers, but I really, really like the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. The citrus is present but not overwhelming. The same goes for the hops. It's a very enjoyable, drinkable beer, and it's one I enjoy more each time I drink it."
"The more I drink it, the more I like it."
"The 60 minute is a true golden color and has a fluffy head and laces in the glass very nicely. It's appearance is a strong point. The smell is a little mild but brings a nice floral character. It has a strong bitterness with a fine emphasis on hops and a fair blend of malt that pinches the cheeks a bit in the mouth and scores well for me as an IPA. This is another great beer from Dogfish. I'll be picking this up again soon."
"Very solid IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
"Overall: This is a great IPA and a personal favorite of mine, and adds an interesting, distinctly Dogfish Head twist on the IPA style."
"D: A tasty IPA which is bitter but not oppressive, delicious and enjoyable all around."
"Overall, a well-crafted IPA."
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a nice off-white head. Floral and piney hops hit your nose right away. Mild and pleasant on the tongue, with the notes of the aroma following right through in the taste. Not too sweet, not too bitter for an IPA. Organic notes complimented with light, fresh fruit in the background. Perfectly smooth mouthfeel with a crisp bitterness left on the palate afterward. Highly drinkable. This is one of the beers that started me on my journey into craft beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and citrus. Taste is very hoppy, citrus is present, malts are not, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a solid brew."
"Overall, this is just a great go-to IPA. When in doubt just buy it and have peace of mind."
"An easy drinking and tasty IPA; I wish it packed a bit more punch in the flavor department, but all in a all a very accessible and easy drinking IPA."
"Overall: I like this beer a lot. It is easy to drink, and tastes great. I pretty much love Dogfish Head."
"O- Slightly disappointed in this one, it just didn't have a standout feature for me, and wasn't memorable at all. It's not a bad beer, but it won't be one that I'll be going back to. Too many other good options out there."
"This is a great English IPA. The mouth starts with a nice carbonation that reveals the grassy and citrus hop taste. The malt taste starts at the beginning but subsides when the carbonation build. After the hops are revealed the malt comes back in to let you know that this is a well balanced and not bitter IPA very nice."
"O: A very refreshing beer."
"O: Good, soild IPA, but I think a lot of breweries have improved the style since this recipe was first bottled. Pesonally, I like IPA's to be more robust in hop oils."
"Super easy to drink. Pairs well with food, esp spciy, because it has a more balance profile. Would love to have fresh on tap because beer does suffer with age relatively quickly."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Good body (always a fine quality for beers and other things), nice bubbly head, and plenty o' lacing. Nose is good sourdough bread with plenty of pine and a little savory. Flavor is not complex, but does have a decent bready flavor, not overwhelmed by the hop bite. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The 60 minute pours light amber with persistent white head. The aroma is very subtle, not too complex or outstanding. The taste is suprisingly complex with nice earthy notes, toasty malts, and lots of hops. Balanced bittereness, alcohol and sweet malty. This beer is much better put together than their stupid show."
"Overall another great Dogfish brew. It pretty much takes the brilliant 90 and adds a bit more sessionability."
"Overall - Great beer, nice sessionable IPA. No wonder this can't stay on the shelves."
"O- A very enjoyable yet unique IPA. It's not as bitter as others due to the orangey taste at the beginning, but it is refreshing and very drinkable."
"O - One of the best IPAs out there, it's near perfect in every regard. Great drinkability!"
"Right off the bat I felt this beer was not an IPA. It was a little too light for me. I figured this craft brew to be a little edgy, but turned out its a little beginner. Don't get me wrong this beer is incredibly drinkable, very refreshing, but 90 Minute is the way to go. Fasho. Also as a session beer its a little pricey, personally I would be happy with some Torpedo or Ranger. Not dissing the beer just saying the hype behind DFH should be they're 90, however if someone asked what a good introduction to craft IPA's would be, I would recommend this, especially for people who aren't that into hops. The 90 is another great non-hophead beer due to its insane malt and hop balance. I would imagine the 75 is somewhere in between(Obviously), which makes me eager to try it. Pick this one up along with the 90, maybe try a side-by-side? Stay thirsty my friends."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing up front but is milky smooth on the back end, great from start to finish."
"O: This is tasty, easy to find, and consistent."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Very well balanced and easy to drink. A perfect beer for a hot summer evening. While a few aspects are fairly average, the beer as a whole is very solid and I'll be sure to try and keep this one in stock. If you're new to IPAs I highly recommend making this one to start with as it has a wonderful yet slight bitterness with a strong malt presence without being overly sweet."
"O - Once again; DFH continues to disappoint. I really want to find something of theirs that I like as I feel rather lonely as one of the few who just dislikes their stuff. But; my palate is the judge and does not deceive me. This was just not enjoyable at all. I dumped it halfway through and opted for a Goose Island IPA instead, to satisfy my IPA fix."
"Drinkability. Great IPA. Hops are showcased with just enough malt. Could drink a few of these pretty quickly."
"I do like a beer with a little more kick than this and new with only 6 abv it wasn't going to provide totally what I was looking for."
"I know I've had this beer in the past and it was outstanding. I'm just going to chalk this one up as a bad bottle."
"Worthy!"
"Food Pairing: Pork, Brie, Chicken, Spicy Foods, Lamb, Burgers, Tofu, Seitan, Temph, Risotto"
"Ending notes: An excellent IPA. What an easy drinker! Goes down so easily. I will definitely have this again. Very sessionable. Well done, DFH!"
"O: Liked this one a lot. Very floral, herbal and citric brew. Liked the amount of balance to the hops. Drank two and could have had one more."
"O - A great IPA. That's all there is to it. Great work DFH."
"Overall Drinkability - One of the best IPAs I've had so far. Definitely will be the go-to IPA until I find something better."
"Very flavorful and aromatic brew from Dogfish Head. This beer is a nice golden color, with a very nice head. The hops are very citrusy and have a crisp bite to them. This beer is probably one of the best Ipa's in America. The mouthfeel is medium and highly drinkable. The aftertaste is bitter and dry, it keeps you in the beer and wanting more. Really great beer though."
"Overall one of the better beers on my list."
"A stand out brew. Not a typical C hopped IPA. A subtle but purposed IPA. Bold but different. Good body with a clean finish. What more could you ask for?"
"D: Fantastic brew made for a great summer day or a reward for a hard days work. While big and bitter this thing is so well balanced it's scary."
"Purely an American creation. Huge IPA bitterness and flavor that is not balanced well with it's malt."
"Dogfish Head never seems to dissapoint. This IPA is another example of that. It pours an nice deep amber to border line brown, and the aroma really showcases the continuous hopping. The body and mouth feel are great. This beer is very luscious and almost creamy, with out being out of place for the style. It balances a sweet and malty body with an abundance of hops. Once I started this beer, I wasn't going to end my night on any other beer."
"One of the best IPAs around. Hands down. Pours a darkish amber color with an off the charts hoppy smell. White head that dissipates quickly. Slightly bitter sticky sweet taste, all those hops make this beer irresistible. This will most likely remain my go to beer to showcase the complexity and overall awesomeness of well-brewed craft beer. No wonder DFH is where they're at right now. Had it for the first time about a year ago and I keep coming back, on my third bottle right now from a sixer on my day off. Enjoying it. Aftertaste is pleasant, really good with any type of food. I can drink these all day."
"Overall this is really a great everyday drinking IPA and I think it represents the IPA style verywell, its not a double IPA. But the aroma and flavor really are steller"
"Overall a very good to excellent IPA that I will drink again and look for on-tap."
"Not a bad IPA, if you're into the malty stuff, which I generally am. I vastly prefer the more intense 90 Minute IPA, however."
"Overall, I like it. Could drink a few of them in an evening I think."
"had a very standard look for a pale ale. very aromatic ipa has strong scents of citrusy hops used in brewing. It did have a very nice hoppy taste to it but little to no unique malt character. average mouthfeel with a light body to it."
"Moderate carbonation. About 3/8 inch of ivory head that dissipates in about 30 seconds. Sparse suds remain when lacing stimulated or sipped. Most notable smells, in additional to low-moderate hops and medium malt, are pine, floral and citrus (perhaps grapefruit, orange and lemon). A relatively mild nose. Carbonation is great upon tasting. Medium body and moderate bitterness (think pale ale). Aftertaste of pine and mild hoppiness. An ideal, hoppy second stage aftertaste expected of top-tier classic IPAs. A delightfully refreshing beverage. Very drinkable. An IPA that is content to earn approval and respect over a session rather than at first sip."
"O - I had heard alot about this beer, and finally decided to try it. Honestly, it's one of the few beers that lives up to it's reputation. Most IPA's make the mistake of being way too hoppy. Not this one. It truly is a great beer, with great drinkability."
"Overall: The body of beer is medium light and the finish is crisp. This is a very good everyday IPA. The beer is well balanced , good flavors and very easy to drink. I would drink this beer on an everyday bases if I could get it."
"A good IPA, and a great go-to beer"
"A good example of of an IPA,if not the best, and an excellent flagship beer from DGFH . Fortunately,it's year-round and widely available."
"Good drinkability, tasty beer."
"This is a quaffable beer, which presents a problem when served one."
"I can't believe I didn't write a review about this earlier - missed it up until now. I have this often on tap or by bottle if 90 minute or other DFH beers are not offered. This is a classic craftbeer thats made DFH famous. From notes -- A: The pour is a clear light amber color with a thin white head which dissipates to a thin layer but leaves some nice sticky lacing. S: The nose is mildly hoppy with some pine and grapefruit. There's quite a bit of toasty, bready malt in the background as well. T: The flavor is more reminiscent of a pale ale than an IPA. The bitterness is there with some nice resinous pine quality, but not all that much in the way of citrus character. The malt is again toasty and fairly pronounced on the front end. M: The body is medium with a low to moderate level of carbonation and a lingering bitterness on the tongue. D: A sessionable and nogstalic IPA."
"thanks guys..cheers!"
"D-I had 90 min about 5 months ago and didn't care for it so i didn't think i would like 60 min soo much. BUT MAN WAS IT REFRESHING. Such a easy beer to drink but it also had great flavors and smells. Really like this beer and will get many times more!! But sadly will haft to trade for it as DFH just pulled out of Indiana"
"D - Very drinkable beer and unlike some other offerings from DFH, a low enough ABV to have as a session."
"Wonderful. A good strength at 6% ABV which brings out the flavours without adding too much of an alcohol taste to the mix. Strong flavours but not overpowering and the balance between the citrus sweetness and hop bitterness allows this to be a fine session beer for those that like a stronger tasting beer, or hops in particular."
"D- Good session beer for an IPA"
"drinkability - another fantastic ipa i wish i could drink every day. one of the more smooth ipa i had in a long time."
"D--Goes down fine for a pale ale, but just doesn't deliver as a great IPA."
"Good mouth on this as it's crisp when it needs to be, but still finishes smooth and clean. Wonderful flavors of bitter fresh hops, grapefruit, orange. Grassy finish. Absolute standard for a drinkable IPA. This beer never disappoints (even when I was in the mood for a completely different beer)."
"D- Very drinkable. A solid IPA, Not as good or outstanding as the 90 min, but again I do enjoy a solid DIPA more than a IPA. Nice quality brew that's well balanced."
"Nothing really reducing drinkability, but not something I would have too often."
"I think I still might like Two Hearted better, but this is a great IPA that I'll have again!"
"Pours amber color with a small head that dissipates to a fine lacing around the edge of the glass leaving a small patch in the middle of the brew. Quite a bit of citrus and pine notes with a bit of straw/grass that evens out the nose. Malt is present almost immediately with a nice amount pine-y hops. A bit of citrus is present in the taste as well. Feels great on the tongue. Definitely a malt texture and not too carbonated. Very drinkable, that's what's great about it. With a 6% abv you can drink a number of these."
"Drinkability - Great session beer I would stock my fridge with this any time, this is what I look for in an IPA."
"This is not an ipa, whatever style it is, not worth drinking."
"The CPJ"
"D-very drinkable. Done with drink in no time!"
"D: Very drinkable, I could easily finish off a six pack in a session. This is a great beer and I'm not sure why I haven't tried it much, much sooner."
"Drinkability - This brew seems like a combination of an IPA, a Belgian Strong Ale and a Pilsener. It's very well balanced, even, enjoyable and drinkable. It's very genuine and good. I like it. This could be a great introductory IPA. Worth a try for sure."
"In fairness, I cracked open a second bottle because I was so surprised at how bad this one was. This is my first time drinking it. The second one was a better, but my taste buds are annihilated so I am unable to review it. And yes, I am familiar enough with IPAs. While not a strict hop-head by any means, I do love me some hops. I am currently even growing 5 kinds of hops!"
"D - great drink. I'll be looking forward to having this again. a very good IPA."
"D - Still a great beer, light and refreshing as I think an IPA should be. Tangy hops don't kill you like some others."
"Crisp and not a hop bomb decently drinkable."
"M: Light, crisp mouthfeel with moderate bubbly carbonation. There is something oily about it also."
"Light bodied compared to other IPAs; good carbonation. Overall, very easy to drink IPA, you don't get ""hopped"" out after one."
"i heard alot of great things about this beer and it lived up to my expectations. im really looking forward to the 90min which i picked up a couple bottles as well."
"Light and crisp, the carbonation is pretty heavy but works well, the thick head that won't go away gives it a slight bit of creaminess. Incredibly drinkable, this is easily this beers strong suite. 60 minute is a flavorful, satisfying, well made brew that's a staple in my fridge"
"D - this is easily a sessionable beer."
"D- Pretty much your meat and potatoes of an IPA here. Beautiful bouquet on the nose, good flavors, and the mouthfeel and low abv make this easily drinkable. I enjoyed this more than the 90 minute."
"The 90 minute is my favorite of dogfish's IPAs, but this is difficult to beat for the price as far as I am concerned. While not my favorite IPA, it's tough to say anything is wrong with it."
"D: This is a hell of a drinking ale. I could knock back four or five of these with no problem. It makes it's ABV known, but it is a nice light feeling, not a heavy in your face punch."
"medium bodied with medium carbonation. very drinkable. personally i prefer the 90min."
"D:Could drink multiples in a setting (I drank 3), but doesnt have that wow factor that leaves you begging for more."
"Overall, this beer is great. I think it is one of the great American IPAs. Dogfish Head has been criticize as of late on this site and it is really unfounded criticism. They make great beers and are pushing the boundaries craft beer and deserve all the respect for doing so. I highly recommend this beer."
"Poured a transparent copper color with quite a bit of head. Smell gives off some caramel malts, a hint of citrus and some hopes. Citrusy and hoppy up front, slightly bitter on the finish. Very smooth and easy drinking beer. I really enjoyed this one. I'll definitely be looking for it again soon."
"Overall, it was an interesting IPA for me. I was a bit disappointed in it, overall, but I'm left wondering if my bottle was just weird. I'll probably try it again at some point."
"In general, a deliciously unique beer that has a lot of potential for food pairings, IMO. Relatively cheap (9.99 for a six) given its degree of complexity, and something that I'll be picking up again in the near future."
"D. Great IPA from DFH. I could easily sink a case of this beer."
"Wonderful character in this beer! Earthy, bitter, citrusy, and still not too heavy that you can only drink one - this is a beer to keep in the fridge at all times!"
"Very affordable at 7.99 a sixer at Total Wine in DE."
"D - Great flavor and hop character. The soft bitterness keeps you coming back for more."
"You have to see the movie ""Beer Wars", available on Netflix. The Dog Fish Head brewery is featured, and inspired me to try the 60 Minute IPA. Hoppa, Hoppa, Hoppa, this is a great IPA! The pour has a clairvoyant color and appropriate head. What aroma! The taste is smooth all the way through, the right light malt sweetness buried in a robust hop flavor. It's expensive, but worth it. One of the finest IPA's I have enjoyed."
"D - Although I love the beer, I will say this... After a few drinks, it starts to beg for more. I wanna have something more complex. But still a great beer and I will be looking forward to picking up some for my beer stock in the future."
"Like Two Hearted (which is better IMO), this is a beer I can keep in the fridge and have turned a few people onto craft brews with this beer."
"A good beer but far from my favorite offering from DFH."
"Yeah, I might drink one or two of these, but it doesn't wow me in a drink-all-night kind of way."
"D: Very smooth. May need to review the 90 minute next."
"Drinkability - awesome IPA for the hophead. I love IPA's and this one is always a staple in my fridge. I have no problem having one right after the other. The flavor doesn't get tiring. Delicious from the first sip to the last. A very solid offering from DFH!"
"I liked this beer, two of my bottles were a too carbonated, not sure what happened there, but they were undrinkable. I disregarded the duds and enjoyed the rest of the beers from my six pack. I look forward to soon trying this beer on tap."
"D - Extremely drinkable. The hop profile here is really nice, and the beer is super smooth and crisp. There is just enough malt in the taste and the aroma to provide a bit of balance to the hops."
"Overall a refreshing and sessionable IPA. It is not my favorite--I like big beers and the DFH 90 Minute IPA is pretty much the standard by which I judge big IPAs. Regardless this is a very affordable and drinkable craft brew that sets many people down the hophead path. Do not underestimate!"
"D: A good IPA, but not in 1st place among IPA's I have tried. I would order it again at a bar if it was available."
"It's certainly a mild IPA, and while the age on it may detract from the nose, it actually blends things rather nicely on the palate, leaving a smooth and pretty drinkable brew."
"Appearance is a coppery, light amber with a nice head and lacing. The smell consists of floral, grassy notes, with a touch of pine and grapefruit. The hops are prominent and intense without being harshly bitter...perfect for an IPA. The grapefruit flavor is very prominent, with a fresh lemongrass taste. Reminds me of freshly mown Spring grass! The carbonation seems just right...light, fresh mouthfeel. Light tasting enough to be very drinkable... Very nice beer, I would buy again when in the mood for an IPA."
"Drinkability: Definitely solid, but I would say I definitely prefer the 90 minute to it for the bigger and more robust flavors -- on the flip side, the lower ABV and slightly thinner body makes this one a bit more drinkable. Nice flavors, and as always, this would be an excellent beer on a hot summer day as it comes across as very refreshing."
"Taste is also of yeast, very dry and smooth, yet almost bitter. It almost has a licorice after taste. This beer is worth seeking out!"
"Simply a really good beer. Not as good as the 90 minute, but very enjoyable and at a better price."
"D- easy to drink, a pretty standard IPA, worth picking up"
"DFH's 90 minute IPA is however one of my favorite IPAs as it is loaded up with more of the same hop taste, making 60 minute look weak."
"overall: overall i liked this beer!! if there is a downside to it, its a bit pricey but at 13ish dollars it doesn't break the bank. I would recommend this beer to anyone! so drink up!"
"First time having this beer. I went out to find this beer to try. I like it I dont love it. Appearance is a nice light copper. Smells really nice, hops and fruit tones are there to be found. Taste is ok...there was just a small touch of bitterness in it. Mouthfeel was good and clean, not a lot of ""hang around"" on my palatte. This is very drinkable as I have polished off 3 already in a hour. Overall I would recommend it but its only in my personal top 15 maybe."
"D - Very drinkable. A beer that can be enjoyed in many occasions."
"If a foreinger came to the U.S. and said they wanted to try a good US made IPA, the Dogfishhead 60 minute might be the best option to provide for a perfectly flavored and balanced All American craft brewed IPA. Everything about this beer is what one would hope for when in the mood for an American IPA (lets not compare to doubles/imperials). To me this is the standard which most other IPA brewers strive for and only a small handful in this country really are on the level of Dogfish Head."
"A very clean, well balance beer that could be enjoyed over a long session."
"Pours a nice clear straw color, with a thick, white frothy head. The nose is citrusy and piney, very pleasant. The taste is the same as the nose with a nice bitterness at the end. Very light mouthfeel that lends itself to being a good session beer. Very nice."
"This has been and will probably continue to be my summer beer"
"I only got this beer because I've been watching the show Brew Masters on Discovery which features Dogfish Brewery. I was pleased to learn it's a really great beer. I'll be seeking this one out again."
"Slightly hazy amber color poured from a bottle into a plastic cup. The thin head dissipated very quickly. Bottled on 12/13/2010. Pleasant, citrusy hop aroma tending toward sweet rather than dry or resiny. On the palate there is a strong grapefruit flavor and firm, dry hoppiness with a medium to light mouthfeel."
"D- High drinkability. Very sweet malt profile makes it a tad sticky. At 6%, its also sessionable."
"DELICIOUS, GET SOME!"
"Floral American citrusy-hop smell. Nice choices of hop strains. Reminds my of some generously hop homebrewed IPAs I've had in the past. IPA's are definitely better fresh even though they were originally designed to last a long time. This one might be a touch old. Bitterness is nice and smooth. Alcohol content was quite surprising to me. I guessed absolutely no higher than 5%. Slightly acidic at the end, but I like that. Good beer, and from Delaware.. Wow."
"Overall: Definitely weaker than 90 Minute."
"Now is when we come to the unfortunate part of the review, when I tasted this, it tasted like coffee. My tastebuds gave me an angry look and accused me of lying when I promised them an IPA. I have heard others complain of this and I am not sure why it happens. So for now, my review will reflect this until I get another opportunity to try 60 minute again."
"D: Middle-of-the-road IPA that is easily drinkable at 6%"
"The mouthfeel is maybe a little thin, but otherwise satisfyingly sticky. The drinkability is absolutely superb, somehow, while being an absolute hop-bomb, the aftertaste isn't super bitter. It instead somehow manages to be refreshing. The lower ABV for the style probably helps a bit here. Dogfish really have a world class IPA with 60 Minute. It's just an absolutely solid brew available all over the place, and an excellent go-to IPA. Now, if only Dogfish's ""experimental"" brews could be this good..."
"Overall this is my favorite IPA. I've had Magic Hat's HIPA, Sierra Extra, but Dogfish really seems to grasp me when it comes to these kind of beers ."
"After every sip your mouth is left coated with hop resin, awesome. Bitterness on the sides of the tongue is a welcome feeling for this hop head. Goes down quickly. Average ABV and tons of hop flavor make this beer incredibly drinkable. An almost perfect IPA at this level of freshness."
"Not a bad IPA, it's good, but there are too many other IPAs brewed by Dogfish Head that better represent the brewery, IMO. But at the end of the day, it's a good beer."
"At only 6% I could enjoy a whole six pack in a night (as I did last night)."
"Nice thick mouthfeel that really lasts in your mouth. It really is a great IPA to drink and because it only comes in at 6% ABV you can enjoy a few."
"D: One of my favorite IPA's and a good introduction to what Dogfish Head brings to the table."
"D: Exceptional. Great session beer. Great smell, great taste, what more could you want?? I could drink this all day."
"Still a great beer, perfect for a beginner hop-head. Sadly, my tastes have changed significantly and this just doesn't give me that hop explosion I need. Luckily I always have 90 Minute!"
"Verdict: A fairly nice beverage, worth a shot. B+ (3.9)"
"This is a good IPA that I love on tap and it is pretty easy to put back quite a few. I definitely have a few times and plan to a few more times. A nice example of a balanced IPA."
"Drinkability: if you love big hop flavor, you'll love it. Dries out your mouth but leaves you wanting more."
"12oz bottle. Pours hazy bronze in color with a long lasting foamy head. Nose is delicious mix of spicy hops and citrus fruit. Spicy hops and grapefruit on the pallet nicely balanced by caramel malt. Finish is balanced in the beginning with the lingering hop bitterness in the end. The brew lacks an IPA style hoppy punch but very tasty and refreshing neverthereless."
"great session beer. if you want something a little more balanced go to stone ipa (which is great as well). This is just perfect for me though!"
"Overall, in my just over 21 year old beer venture, this is the best IPA I have had (may be the first I have really enjoyed, in fact). Now one of my favorites that I would recommend to any of my friends."
"PS Does anyone else feel the need to listen to Matisyahu when they review beer?"
"D: A really solid, go-to IPA. Not as overbearing as the extreme IPAs out there."
"D/O- I feel that drinkability may be this beer's greatest strength. Compared to some of the other IPAs I've had recently, this DFH 60 gets lost in the middle of the pack."
"A really well crafted and widely accessible beer. Definitely a good gateway beer and better on tap."
"Chad"
"D - I don't see one being able to throw these back one after the other. It's good to have 1 or 2, but I get tired of the strong bitterness after that and switch to a different beer."
"Drinkability - this is a crisp clear and clean IPA with just enough hops it's well balanced with light malt notes -Very drinkable."
"great drink ability here....def...a session type beer..."
"O: A very good example of the style as some IPA's tend to be focused more on hop character than overall balance. This one brings back the malt backbone that should always be present might seem overkill to west coast hopheads. I find it perfectly balanced."
"Drinkability- Easy beer for me to drink for me to drink because of the hop but can't say that for everyone. It has many characteristics to make it one of the best 60 minute IPA's I have ever had, would like to have again."
"This beer doesnt do much for me. Not bad just nothing special."
"All in all an excellent beer. Truly...visitors to my kitchen will open my fridge and behold this is what they'll find."
"M - smooth but crisp and dry, with somewhat higher carbonation than the typical bottled IPA."
"All in all a good beer. The hop characteristic is a bit higher than I usually go for, but my taste preference is evolving and I'm learning to love the wolf in the weeds. I will try Dogfish 90 the next time it's available at my local craft brew distributor."
"Poured into a Dogfish pint this beer looks amazing. The thickest creakiest head on a dark amber beer. The smell is like a blast of citrus and when you taste it, it's like eating the white membrane of a grapefruit. Excellent bitterness, outstanding beer, great body, great beer. Awesome."
"Pours a deep off golden color with a thick yellowish white head and a little lacing left over. Smells like old cat piss or something worse. However the taste is not too bad. Plenty of piny hops and a little malts in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is medium."
"Very drinkable- not over hopped, but enough to keep most hop heads happy without the bitterness that turns some off"
"Pours an amber color with a big time hop profile but with a solid malt backbone also lingering. Piney citrus taste prevails, but it also tastes more nutty and malty than a lot of other IPA's, but it has a nice balance. Overall this a solid beer, a staple that is almost always in my fridge"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint. Nice amber color and two finger head. Piney hops with a touch of grapefruit. Medium mouthfeel and easy drinkability make this a sold basic choice. This is one of the first craft brews people here in Central PA try and realize what they're missing."
"One finger almost creamy white head small bubbles, fairly quick dissipation with good amount of lacing retained. Golden amber clear body, multiple streams of carbonation rising quickly to surface. Fairly fruity nose, more tropical than citrus but both are present up front, with some caramel and dryish malts in the middle. Taste mirrors the nose but the hops appear soon after initial taste, fairly bitter, resiny, but balanced with enough sweetness to maintain tastiness. Medium mouthfeel, above average effervescence. Real drinkable and tres tasty. Upon reflection I prefer this to the 90 minute, which the last few times I've had it has come across a fairly boozy. 60 minute is more balanced, and easier on my pour liver. I thought this was very tasty, certainly can stand side by side with PNW's best IPAs. IMHO, one of Dogfish Head's best beers. I will most certainly drink this again. Highly recommended."
"Beautiful colour, brilliant nose, and a super-hoppy flavour that is both complex and balanced enough to be enjoyable, while being hop-centric enough to excite a ""hop head"". Lovely."
"D - An all-round well crafted beer. The mouthfeel won it for me."
"D= Easy drinking, definitely one of the high points of this beer."
"With its balanced flavor and superior drinkability, 60 Minute is one of the classic American IPAs. Try to find it fresh!"
"Overall - A very nice IPA. I love the 90 minute, but I can't have 2 or 3 of them. This is a more realistic beer. Don't get me started about the 120. It is more of a circus freak than an enjoyable beer."
"This is a good beer put out by DFH, it is their ""flagship"" beer so try it if you haven't already."
"A very good IPA which would make a welcome addition to any fridge. Not my fav IPA, but def a very good choice for an everyday fridge beer."
"Pours a very clear golden color with one finger of white foamy head. The aroma is amazing with strong fruity hops and maybe even a hint of coffee... Although I may be crazy. The taste is the only weakness with this beer. You can taste the alcohol, but it's still has a nice balance of hops and malt to it. Mouthfeel is good with plenty of carbonation. Overall a good beer to have around."
"Drinkabilty - If you're like me and cant stand the 90 minute ipa, then give this a shot. Its pretty smooth and hoppy. At 6% you can have a few without any problems. I would drink this again but there are better ipa's out there. So far this is the best dogfish head beer ive had."
"Almost perfect!"
"This might be my favorite beer. The 90 is hoppier (obviously) but the high alcohol content makes it a bit more dangerous to drink more than a few. You can really get into this beer and enjoy it all night long."
"Drinkability is exceptional, i'll drink this one all day long."
"Drinkabilty is 100% give me another. This is the American IPA I judge and benchmark all IPAs by."
"D: This is a great IPA. Hoppy yet balanced, and extremely drinkable. Another solid offering from Dogfish head."
"I'd say the bottle date is fairly fresh. Split between two snifters, shared with family member. Pours a pure apple juice color, 1-finger head that reduces to a nice thin film, better-than-average lacing. Aroma of some grapefruit, pineapple, and slight aroma of fir tree. The hops are pleasant and light on the nose. Taste of pine and citrus hops are balanced with some bread-like malt. Extremely drinkable and easy on the palate. Nice light malty aftertaste. Excellent beer."
"Overall, the 60 Minute IPA is worth a try. If you're looking for a sessionable IPA or have yet to try an IPA, the 60 Minute is the way to go. I prefer the 90 Minute IPA."
"Overall it was a nice ipa one of my favorite thus far but not perfect."
"D: Great crafted beer. Can definitely drink this all night without any complaints. great beer!"
"D- Great non-offensive IPA"
"Although hops are up front the malts, citrus and sweet notes keep this a nicely balanced brew...very nice!"
"D- it's just a solid go to in the clutch would never turn it down easy drinker. loved it."
"I really liked this one. It didn't have the citrus character I'd expected but it was still very good. I could see myself going back for this one."
"D - Its super drinkable, but im having a hard time calling this an ipa."
"Pours a deep golden amber bronzish color. Slighly hazy. Huge creamy off-white head and beautiful lacing. The smell is a nice herbal pine with plenty of grapefruit and other citrus. It smells like a good IPA which is a very good thing. Very clean and fresh hop and pine flavors compine right off the bat with a sweet earhy bready malt base. I can tell this is a very fresh bottle. More sweet bready somewhat toasted flavors come our in the middle. It finishes with a sweet citric grapefruit and a beutifully clean bitter herbal bite. The body is a little lighter than some of the other IPA's I think. I kind of like that. That along with the blanced sweetness and clean bitterness and overall great fresh hop taste of this beer makes it incredibly drinkable. I did the whole six pack in an afternooon fairly easily. I love IPA's and I can't believe I've left one this good sit on the shelf until now. Is the 120 minute really double the flavor and body of this? That sounds scary as hell."
"This beer is high on the drinkability scale."
"Can't go wrong with this. Would go back for more if I were closer."
"D: Easy all night drinker for sure."
"D: Very good taste and feel."
"Overall Rating- This beer is a top notch APA. Although weak in color and smell this beer has a taste that out shines its weaknesses. Taste for me is the most important quality in a beer. I also love the fact that this beer is bottle conditioned old school style. Out of 100 I would give this beer a 88 and would say that it keeps up with the best of this style of beer. Its no Odell but its damn good anyway"
"Overall: I understand balance is key in this brew, but I drink IPAs because I like the taste of IPAs. This beer is way to one-note and forgettable to rave about. There are just too many other much better IPAs in this country."
"D - Love the balance of flavors in this one, so in that respects its very drinkable. I believe i'll have another.."
"This beer doesn't leave me wanting for anything. Not really a strong IPA character; but as an overall session beer, the best I've ever had. Sam should consider doing a batch of this guy with some Belgian yeast. THAT may be the only way to impove this impressive go-to beer. However, if you're looking for something extreme, go elsewhere."
"Mouthfeel: Medium mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. Just a solid and well balanced IPA."
"Drinkability is average... it tastes like a 6%... good enough to have a few"
"D: Very easy to drink, nice for a hot summer day or a spring/fall evening by the fire pit."
"Pours a thick hazy golden brown with 1/2"" white head but is trasparent enough to see through the glass...sort of. Might be thick due to hanging out in the back of my fridge where it is colder. Smells spicy and hoppy kinda sweet too. Soft bread or malt undertones in nosing it again. Complex. Nice hop character seems to engage on different levels. Lacing quickly races back to beer. Great taste well rounded nice IPA. i really engoy this beer, drink it often. Offers nice hoppy character whithout being over hopped. Well rounded and balanced."
"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the orange citrus with some bready malt and piney hops mixed in. The flavor is reminiscent of orange juice. There is a ton of hop flavor, but the bready malt balances out the bitterness and keeps the beer very well balanced. I also get some pine notes in the flavor as the beer warms. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An American classic that everyone should try."
"Overall, this quintessential American IPA has been a long favorite of ours. The best thing about it is how the hop character comes through strongly, while simultaneously remaining well balanced, soft, and delicious."
"D - Exceptional. A solid IPA that is easy to drink."
"Not a lot of head on this pour, about one finger of white foam, with some lace with little cling. Color is a 8 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Aronas of citrus, malts, and hops. Flavors I taste are lemon, lime, orange peel, some oats, and hops. Some hearty body in the mouth, feels really good going down. Another good brew from Dogfish Head, I will drink another at a later date and give my friends a heads up if they want a good brew."
"Pours a nice copper color, with a small white head. Aroma of piney earthy hops, malt and caramel. Taste is earthy hops, malt and caramel with some bitterness. Palate is nice medium body, good carbonation, crisp mouth feel. Finish is earthy hops, sweet malt and caramel with a good amount of bitterness to add some balance. Ovrall a nicely balanced and easy drinking IPA."
"M and D - dry, a little bitter. Very pine, hoppy. A little malty. Good IPA."
"D: It's very easy to drink this beer and the low alcohol content makes it very sessionable."
"60 Minute IPA is, at 6%, an extremely sessionable IPA. It's one of my good to beers when autumn weekends roll around."
"Drink- Pretty good sessionable IPA. Not my favorite but pretty good."
"D - extremely drinkable beer. nice flavor, not too intense, good kick and only a little bitter."
"Drinkability was good, especially as the brew warmed a bit the flavor came through much better. Very good and will try again."
"D-well its not that awful of a drinker but there are too many other things i'd rather be drinking that cost less or have a similar abv, i wouldn't get a 2nd one"
"First time ever having this beer. Coming from someone who is in college and doesn't often drink great beer, this beer is a must have! Best I have had. Will drink again. I have 5 more and I will cry when they are gone. Go to your nearest store and get yourself a drink!"
"Well balanced carbonation and medium body makes it go down fairly easy. Not too much alcohol either."
"This is my everyday drinking IPA. It's not too hoppy but still around 60+ IBUs. It's only 6% so you can drink one with dinner and not feel it hard. It's got a clean head, strong enough to float a cap, a pleasant smell, and a smooth taste without being too dry or overly bitter. In short, the restraint shown by this beer is worthy of greater respect than the ratings here; it's much better than the 90 or 120 in the sense that you can enjoy it with others who aren't massive hopheads."
"D- Its DFH's flagship beer and is drinkable but not their best."
"The apperance is a yellow oragnish tint. I guess you could call it a copper color. The beer pours with a frothy white head. The aroma smells like citrus hops. The beer starts sweet but quickly changes to a citrus flavor and hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light, with a fizzy, almost hot carbonation. For an American IPA I would say this is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability- This is a great beer, I can enjoy a few of these over a course of a night and not do too much damage to my palate. Definitly one of my favorite beers. A huge eye opener into the world of IPA's and craft beers."
"Cheers!"
"D- Moderate. I just don't dig the hops. Not for me. Doesn't hold a candle to Smuttynose FinestKind, and I can't see myself buying this unless it was on tap and I was hard up for choices. A good beer, not for me."
"D: This is a very good IPA and is a great choice when looking to session. On draft it is smooth and really has a nice freshness to it."
"D - At first, I was incredibly shocked by the taste - hop overload; smooth; definitely a unique experience; I could finish a couple of these in 60 minutes or less; great beer - Highly Recommended!"
"And you can drink them in well under 60 minutes."
"D_Superb. Very favorable , session-able IPA."
"Also I noted upon drinking left a beautifully heavy lacing on my glass."
"D: a fine and not too complex IPA, very smooth with plenty of hoppiness but not too bitter...very easy to drink, a great representation of the style and ranks up there with DFH 90 minute"
"Mouthfeel/Drink-ability - Refreshing, maybe if I got a newer bottle it would be hoppier."
"D - First experience with this beer was rather pleasant. A solid IPA, not overwhelming in anyway. Not overly hoppy, not overly malty in imho. A real sessionable IPA. Would have no problem polishing off multiple bottles."
"M/D - Quite smooth. The carbonation is good and the body feels medium. Drinkability is great, I see no reason why someone wouldn't enjoy having a few of these."
"Overall this is a very good beer. This will, without a doubt, be in my regular rotation."
"Fairly aggressive pour yields a golden amber color, with a solid inch of head with little retention, and leaving some nice lacing. Earthy and citrus hop aromas coming from my pint glass, as well as some malty sweetness. Taste follows right along with the nose, piney / fruity hops with just a touch of malt underneath it all. Real nice finish, and quite drinkable. Much more hop forward than 90 Minute IMO, which makes it alot more desirable to my palate."
"Wow! I have had this beer before from bottles, but finally had on-tap. Its a great golden orange with a giant sticky white head that last a long time. Aroma is awesome. Super piney and clean. Great smell of juicy hop oil and citrus. Taste follows, Great burst of grapefruit and clean hops fill your mouth. Yet its not a hop bomb. Its very well balanced, which makes it a very easy IPA to drink. Just a great example of this style."
"D: I am not sure how, but the 60 minute IPA formula is just quaff-ably different from most standard IPA's. I has its own thing and it's a tasty beer"
"D - highly drinkable, great refreshing beer very good IPA. Overall nowhere near as hoppy/spicy as Victory HopDevil or Stone IPA. More on par with a Harpoon IPA. A good summer beer to kick back relax and pound a few."
"Drinkability: This was my first IPA and I thought it was pretty good. It was a little earthy and bitter for me at first but it really grew on my as I finished it. I would have to be in the mood but would definitely try again."
"D: A drinkable IPA. Unique in flavor. Will pick up again but have others I will pick up first."
"Bottled on 10/5/10. Pours a bright golden light amber with a small creamy white head that sits at a ring. Nice lacing. Smell is piney hops, sweet malts, and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste is mostly pine balanced with a bit of bready malt flavor. Mouthfeel is light body and medium carbonation. Drinks more like an APA, but still very drinkable, get this one while its fresh."
"Slainte!"
"D: Very drinkable IPA. A session beer that has a nice tasteful craft quality to it at the same time."
"Definitely worth having again, but can't see sessioning with this one."
"drinkability: very drinkable for a basic IPA, drinkable for someone not wanting something overly hopped yet has the elements it needs and a decent abv, definite go-to beer for the style."
"One finger white head fades too a ring-although in a mason jar- clear copper color.  Hoppy, duh, juicy piney fresh citric hops.  Taste follows, bitter finish, piney.  Nice amount of crystal malt.  Drinks well, bubbly and clean, a little strong for a session beer but you get the picture."
"This is a fantastic solid beer. A lot of times DFH goes overboard and creates beers that are just hard to swallow, but this one is one of the most approachable. The hops are earthy and the malt is toasty and rich. This is one of my favorite IPAs, and I will be sure to have it many times in the future."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a small head that doesn't dissipate too fast. The head sticks to the glass just a little bit. It smells of citrus hops and maybe some caramel or toffee. The hops are not all that present, but are definitely there. Caramel malt notes as well. Medium carbonation and light bodied. It goes down pretty smooth. This IPA is a little on the light and malty side for me. I still think its pretty good and I would drink it again, but I'd rather have a 90 minute."
"I tend to like an IPA with just a bit of maltiness to it and Dogfish head does just that. It still showcases the hops inherent to the style yet is also has the bready, heartier qualities that I tend to want more of in a beer as fall approaches."
"The carmel malt of the beer is to much. I mean come on. When I went in for the first sip, i felt like i was about to drink a carmel candy. The after taste followed suit. Its an average IPA that I really tried to like."
"We're starting off with the 60 minute IPA. Let me just say that, while the label is okay, I really like the copper cap with the Dogfish Head logo. It's simple, understated, and quite nice. (I know it's weird to comment on a cap, but this one stood out, at least for me.) This is just a 12 ounce bottle out of a six pack poured into a rudimentary (though functional) tumbler. It pours a light gold, lighter than I was expecting, with a nice crowning head. Solid head retention out of this one. Good clarity as well. Crisp citrus hop aroma dominates the nose. Initial taste is surprising. I know this is an IPA but it's got a higher level of bitterness that I was anticipating, which isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel on this is smooth, almost slick. It can just catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it. Taste is very much hop-forward. Dogfish Head likes to say that this is an East Coast IPA but I don't know if I agree. It certainly has west-coast leanings, both with the hop profile and bitterness levels. This thing is like a tidal wave. Hops crash into your taste buds, with waves of pine, citrus and grapefruit hitting first. As the tide of hops recedes, solid biscuity and light caramel malt sweetness finishes things up. As IPAs go, this is somewhere above ordinary, bordering on the extraordinary. If I had reliable access to this beer I'd probably pick it up all the time as my IPA of choice. Very nice offering and a steady example of the American IPA style."
"d: This beer is very dry on the palate and finishes very crisply. The taste associated with the bitterness may drive some people away but I am personally a fan."
"D- The one thing I usually don't like about east coast IPA's is the malts that tend to be over the top. Dogfish Head sadly is one of those breweries that do it. I think that the beer itself is good and might be sessionable to the right person. Sadly, this beer is not one for me."
"The body is on the light side of medium, with mild carbonation. It's definitely easy to drink, as I could drink it all night. But it's no heavy hitter, but I suppose that's where the 90 & 120 Minute come in...."
"I've had this beer before when I really wasn't an IPA fan, but now that I'm growing a taste for the hop-load I'm going to review it. The DFH 60 minute pours a slightly hazy copper orange color, finger of puffy white foam, and some beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma as would be expected is strongly of hops, specifically piny and citrus aroma. There is also the detection of caramel malts making an appearance on the nostril, but they are not necessarily in balance. The flavors of hops and malt however are in balance. During the initial sips there is a tangy bitterness on the palate that grows on the tongue the more you consume the beer. That is a bit too bitter still for my liking, but overall it is a fine drinking beer and something that is quite pleasant for an IPA."
"One of the most interesting IPAs I have had. The piney hops come through along with the thirst quenching mouthfeel. Clear orange appearance with white lacey head. Spicy, piney, and tasty on a nice summer night. Could take down a sixer without thinking about it. One of my go to's in the throughout the year."
"This is one of the beers that got me interested in Craft. It's nice to go back and revisit the old standards. It is so easy to get caught up in seeking out the next big thing, that sometimes we forget just how good the classics are."
"I do like it a lot and will go there again..."
"Notes-I know this is a staple IPA, but I had forgotten how good this was. This was bottled a mere two weeks ago, and I don't think I'll ever be able to drink one more than two months old or so ever again."
"D: This is easily at least an A- beer on draft. The next time I am at the Alehouse (which I go at least once a month), I want to revisit this brew and update this review."
"I've only had one of these, but after more experience with it I can see it becoming one of my favorites, even a fridge-staple!"
"Drinkability: Very good. It's not the best, but it's very good and it's something I could see being a mainstay in my refrigerator."
"I can't believe I haven't entered a review for this one yet. Well, now's as good a time as any, I s'pose. It pours a clear golden amber topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, mandarin oranges, honeydew, and sweet, sweet caramel. The taste is heavier on the pine, but the fruitier hoppy notes remain, joined with the aforementioned pine in a joint domination of the sweet caramel beneath. Imagine the mutants in Futurama. The body is a heavy light/very light medium, with a light carbonation and a finish that really seems like it wants to be dry. Overall, a very nice hop-forward IPA, as good this time as it has been in the past."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, makes u wanna come back over and over again and explore the diffrent subtleties of the hops and also the backround flavors."
"D- I remember my first one of these before I was familiar with IPAs. It was so intense and I couldn't decide whether I liked all the bitterness or not, or all the bite I thought it had. Now I find myself thinking of this as being considerably smooth and easy to down. I almost wish it had more kick now like it did the first time."
"Very drinkable IPA without to much bitternes and harshness"
"Super drinkable, and a legendary east coast IPA that deserves all the hype. I have to get one of these every few months, and usually end up drinking more than one. This is a great beer to quaff at cookouts, when watching a game, or even having an ugly sweater party. A true classic."
"d- i very much enjoy this beer and will grab it again some other time, its a good beer for enthusiasts and beginners in the ipa world"
"D: Goes down easy. This would be my go to IPA if we could get it in MN... Hopefully one day soon."
"D- I remember when I first had this beer. It was way back before I found BA. I thought it was pretty aggressive and bitter. I actually had a hard time drinking it. Now it goes down super easy and isnt bitter to me at all."
"I like it. I'd recommend it."
"This has pretty much everything I look for in an American IPA though it could have had more head. Still, nice lacing. A gorgeous wheaty golden color, not quite clear enough to watch TV through but still a great clarity and consistency of color. A strange scent and taste of peach that I wasn't expecting. I've had this before and never got the peach accents until this reviewing. A bit more carbonation in the mouth than I expect, but it works pretty well to balance out the strong hoppy flavors. There's a reason or ten that this is a favorite in the IPA sphere."
"This was a pretty good IPA, there was good flavor and it was refreshing and pretty light making it very easy to drink."
"D: At 6%, this is an easy beer to drink. Funny how time and experience changes things though; this beer isn't nearly as hoppy as I remember."
"D: It's easy to see why this is DFH's best selling beer. It goes down easy and is immensely drinkable."
"Very drinkable and low enough ABV to have more than one."
"D: Good drinker. Very flavorful. A good IPA to compare others to."
"Add a new favorite IPA to the list."
"Top notch beer it's balanced one of the best."
"Thank you Dogfish Head for date coding your beers! This one was brewed on 8/11/10, about a month and a half ago. Pours out a deep gold, somewhat thin head and with decent carbonation. Looks like an average IPA to my eyes. The smell is of hops hops and more hops. I've always said, Dogfish Head uses some wild ass hops in their beers and this is no exception. (Also call me crazy, in my clean glass I got a weird wet dog smell.) Gosh, what the heck are these hops that make it taste so different, almost like some kinda tropical fruit? Not so much piney, but more pineapple! Let me tell you, it is different. And, it is good. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, this is a rich beer, but not too much cause it is pretty darn drinkable. There is some maltiness in there but for the style it doesn't stick out much, which is about how I expect it."
"This brew pours a light golden hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and sporadic lacing here and there,the smell consists of aromas of hay,sweet pineapple and sweet caramel,it has a rather nice mouthfeel which is thicker than it looks and really coats the mouth with tastes of pineapple,citrus,caramel candy and finishes with a bittersweet finish almost like sugar on lemons but i find it finishes more sweet than bitter and overall its a really nice easy drop to drink."
"D: The biggest problem with this beer, is that it's not as good as the 90-minute IPA. Seriously, that's pretty much the only problem with it."
"Over all i loved this beer. Still new to the world of craft brewing, but this is one of my favorites so far. Can't wait to try the 90 minute IPA."
"D- perfect american IPA your go to one , youll never tire of this."
"D- Well Let see how the 90min taste. Should be much stronger. This is a very easy IPA to start for newbies. Since I been drinking a few IPA's this is a let down for me. Wont be my goto IPA by any means."
"This is one of those beers that you dont ever forget. As soon as i opened the bottle the first scent that i detected was not beer, but hops. it smelled like i had a handful of fresh Cascade hops, not a beer. And then came the first sip..it even tasted exactly like hops. This is by far the hoppiest beer that i have ever had and it isnt the regular type of hoppiness. its a fresh zesty hoppiness as opposed to the regular bitter undertone that other beers have. The maltiness was also at a careful balance, but nothing compares to those hops!"
"It does have a sense of stong alcohol but the brewery made a fine example of a sessionable 6% beer. I would (and have) gladly crack another."
"All in all Dogfish Head is worth all the hype especially if you know the difference between a craft beer and a fizzy yellow beer. If you know the difference than you would know that this is some really good stuff. Again great job Sam."
"The key word for this beer is balance. All the elements are in harmony, working with each other to make a beer that is both interesting for the advocate, but simple and welcoming to the average beer drinker. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't enjoy this beer. It's bitter while being sweet, it's light and crisp while being creamy and robust. This is a real winner."
"12oz. Bottle Poured a perfectly clear straw gold with a 1 finger eggshell white head. It diminished slightly to a half finger and got nice and creamy. Looks more like a pilsner than an IPA. A ton of carbonation coming up from all over the glass. The head stuck on here throughout. Stayed nice and creamy. Smells very grassy. This grassy/earthiness is followed by a small touch of citric hops towards the end. The strong grass is slightly off putting but as it warms it mellows and there's more citrus coming forward. As it warms more I can smell the caramel maltines coming through as well. Taste is good. Different than what I thought it'd be from the smell. There's a good hop bite up front followed by a piney bitterness that makes its appearence during the swallow. A very solid malt backbone lasts throughout the drink to balance everything nicely. Every now and then I can pick up some alcohol in my nose and throat. The mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied. Coats the mouth with every sip. Drinkability is up there. It's easy drinking. Good mouthfeel and balanced."
"This is not a good beer to convert a bud miller coors type, however if you are into IPA's and craft beers, not trying this brew would be doing a disservice to yourself and your tastebuds!"
"D-About as drinkable as they come, I kind of go back and forth whether this is overrated or sublimely solid and worth the hype, perhaps somewhere in the middle"
"This being my first review - I wanted to start with this exceptional brew. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Golden honey colored with a one finger off white head. Smells floral, citrusy and piney. Initially a little intimidating. Upon tasting this brew it is very balanced. I enjoyed the strong hop flavor, but finishes smooth with a sweet malt character. A truly balanced and refreshing taste. This is the best IPA I,ve ever tasted! I definately recommend this to anyone who loves IPA or is trying IPA for the first time. It is a great session beer that can be enjoyed over and over again!"
"Highly drinkable. Easy drinking, has a nice hoppy flavor, well balanced. Just an awesome IPA."
"D - A good friend of mine brought a case to share for my birthday without notice. I was knocking them back one after another as if I wasn't able to find these anywhere else. If you love an IPA, and you enjoy belgian styles as well, this is a brew you'll find solace in."
"I'll pass on this next time. I hear a lot about this beer, and I am guessing it gets high marks from others on this site (I don't read ratings before reviewing), but it seems like a lot of hype to me."
"This beer pours crystal clear. It has a perfectly golden brass color and the white head hangs out around one finger thick. The nose has a lot of citrus grassy notes with some tart bitterness. It drinks a little tight with bittering hops at first, after that it opens up to a softer more floral taste. The finish is very mild and easy but there is some sour lemon that makes me thirsty for more. Some of the tart and sour notes distracts from the drinkability but with every sip my palate seems to expect it making it easier. I wish I had a second bottle."
"This is an exceptionally smooth IPA. It's not as hoppy as the 90 Minute or other heavier beers, but it is nicely balanced. It's very manageable and pairs greatly with hot wings. This has become my standard for good beers. When all else fails, the 60 Minute is a reliable, all around good brew. Hoppy, but not overbearing."
"D- hell I've over looked this beer for years, had it tons of times just not one of those beer I tend to go with. Maybe ill have to rethink that. Tasty and nicely hopped."
"D: probably too drinkable, very clean, easy to drink ipa. can't go wrong ""sessioning"" this beer."
"I think this is it for IPA's in all categories..."
"Drinkability - exceedingly drinkable and very refreshing. A standby IPA that I always enjoy"
"D: I was underwhelmed by this beer. I'm sure it's better fresh on tap (I hope). I like their 90min better but I may be comparing apples to oranges. Still very drinkable and not a bad IPA. Someday I'll give this a second look and update my score. Thanks again Mark, this is not your fault."
"A decently drinkable brew, I've always considered this to be DFH's session IPA. For a more serious and enjoyable IPA experience, I'd recommend their 90 minute."
"Overall a nicely done american IPA but i would tone down the bitterness to make it more drinkable."
"D - oh hell ya. I'll put this baby in my rotation now."
"Overall: Very solid IPA overall. Not my favorite in the style, but a very good beer which is widely available."
"perfect representation of the style."
"Is Dogfish Head subcontracting their beers regionally? That might explain why this IPA, which I've enjoyed greatly in the past, is kind of mundane now. This is the second time in the past month that I've purchased a 6 pack. Both times it was disappointing. If it were one time I'd dismiss it as possibly long shelf life or ?...but when I buy 2 in the course of a month or so and neither is distintive I feel like there's either a major QC problem or simply...it's not that good!"
"D-hop centered beer with a good malt presence, mellow and tasty with plenty of hops. very drinkable and refreshing IPA, much better than I remember."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation and has a very crisp feeling. It is fairly drinkable as well, goes down easily and is something I can go back to repeatedly."
"Not too much to add here since the other reviews have been pretty comprehensive. But the one thing that stands out is how it starts pretty ordinary but then transfers, about halfway through, into a hoppy explosion which fills out and fills out everywhere like some sort of upside down mushroom cloud. The best beer finale I've had in a long long time. Fannytastic."
"one of my favorites. still probably won't top Goose Island as my favorite IPA, but this is undoubtedly a strong second"
"OVERALL: This brew is in limbo between APA and IPA, meaning it could be either a stronger and impressive former or an average latter. This one tastes a little better than average for the style, but it's still not a stand out example. Oddly enough, I think this was my favorite, or at least the best example of its style, out of the three brews in the Minute series. A solid brew to have in Ontario for sure, and one that's really refreshing served cold on a hot day by the pool. I'll be making this, along with Flying Monkey's Hoptical Illusion, one of my staple pales while visiting back home."
"I definitely enjoyed several of these while at the bar, the flavor is complex but generally subtle and nicely balanced."
"Always a great standby...I love this beer!"
"Has a very crisp and somewhat bitter front. A bready backing throughout the sip, and finishing with malt overtones."
"Right on point with the overall hop characteristics of the beer, the finish is crisp, dry, and quenching. It's perfect with food because with every sip it scrubs your palate clean, leaving you even more prepared for your next bite of that pesto pasta. It's dry and satisfying all at the same time, and seems to leave my mouth watering a bit. It's really a chef's dream, and mine! The Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is a Game Changing Beer."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Extremely drinkable, very clean and crisp. This is one of my beer fridge staples, something I never have a problem reaching for."
"Great color: amber with some reddish notes. I get the hoppiness and malt with the aroma and it translates nicely when sipped. The mouthfeel is a light carbonation with an aftertaste that stays on the palate. Though this aftertaste is desirable I do not feel that the drinkability was as good as I would have liked it to be."
"My first sip gave off a similar flavor to the nose. I enjoyed the flavor almost as much as I did the nose, but I do feel as though the mouth feel was a bit off from the thick nose. The wonderful hoppyness of this beer reminded me why I really love IPA's. A truly wonderful beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle and served in a Chimay chalice. Plenty of head and a fair amount of lacing. The taste is as close to Orval as an American offering can be in my opinion. A fair amount of astringent flavor but still pleasant. Way more complex than most offerings here. A darn good beer."
"You simply can't go wrong with this beer, especially when it's fresh. A readily accessible and easy staple for the fridge."
"Bottle purchased from The Beer Emporium, Sandbach. Appearance was clear and fresh looking, slight head soon gave way to minimal lacing. Aromas of citrus fruit and faint malt hit the nose. Gave a good dryish fruity hop taste with definite malt prescence. Low level carbonation and a smooth feel was pleasant on the mouth. A good standard IPA, well balanced, definitely try another one - or two."
"D - Very solid IPA. Very underrated. I normally pass it over for something I haven't tried, but when I do get them I'm always satisfied! Wouldn't expect anything less from DFH."
"To me, the 60minute is much more delicious than the 90 minute and the 120 minute. Regarding this brewery, bigger is not better."
"Pours a golden amber with a healthy head that leaves behind a solid amount of lacing on my glass. Nose is mostly fruity hop scents with a touch of caramel that suggests an underlying malt character. Taste is fairly balanced for an IPA, although there are a lot of citrus hop notes that definitely push the hops over the top of the malts. The hop character is mostly in flavor as the bitterness is tempered slightly by a solid malt backbone. Very tasty and complex IPA that, while not as tongue-ripping bitter as some of my favorite IPAs, manages to hold its own. Very sessionable as well."
"I would have liked to have another one (or two) after trying this bottle. It is definitely going to have a place in my fridge."
"Highly recommended if you love hoppy IPAs"
"Copper orange in color witha deep haze. Thin white head that leaves wisps of foam that add to the wet lacings on the glass. Bold citrusy hop aroma that includes orange and tropical fruit, but not too intense that ahint of malt character can't sneak though. tangy, citusy feel on the tongue with lively carbonation. Floral, citrus hop character in the beginning with a brief sweet maltiness in the middle followed by a crisp tangy, hoppy ending. Very drinkable."
"D: very accessible; one could return again and again"
"D: A stadadrd when on draft at my nieghborhood pub."
"This is a very drinkable IPA, well balanced but still a great hop character, never hurts the palate like some of the hoppier IPAs I've had. Great go to beer."
"I think this is the good standard that IPA can be judged on. Nice body, never too bright or too hoppy. Lots of flavor that isn't drowned is the hops or bitterness. My wife hates IPAs and has enjoyed this before. I just don't tell her she's having an IPA. Can definitly drink this all day."
"This is the first time that I have had this IPA from the bottle, and also the first time after eating. I like the aroma of this beer with its floral notes keeping it from being too sharp. The taste is strong and hoppy with a little bit on the astringent side, leaving me with a mouth feel like I just used Listerine. I do believe this is a very good sipping beer for sitting by the fire on a cool spring/autumn/winter evening. Not for a warm and humid day in midsummer. I think this would also compliment a steak very well. Overall, I enjoyed this though it is a bit to strong in character for me to have more than one."
"The beer is of medium complexity and very drinkable. Would definitely recommend."
"Prost!!"
"D - This is a classic IPA. The aroma is excellent and it is easily the best aspect of the beer. The flavor is nice as well but the malt, while dry, gets cloying from the singed toast notes. This is one of those beers that has been so ubiquitous for so long that I tend to take it for granted. I don't usually think about ordering it when I see it in a bar and I just assumed that I had already reviewed it until I checked. It has been a nice experience to be reminded just how good this beer is."
"The aroma is a great hoppy and citrusy aroma. A good IPA really lets you get a good taste of the hops that make up beer. It has sort of dark yellowy and golden color. A really nice color. The taste is just like the aroma full of hop and citrus. Medium to full mouthfeel and very filling. I didn't have anything to eat with this beer but Ill bet it goes well with some food."
"Extremely well balanced, the hops, ABV%, etc. Other than being more costly, there are no real drawbacks to this fine brew."
"A tasty beer with enough going on to keep me happy. It's just not quite an IPA anymore after 3 months."
"Would absolutely have another. Very good beer...lives up to its reputation."
"D: Very easy to drink and very tasty to boot."
"O: Outstanding."
"very drinkable, nigh sessionable. could easily have a few of these in a sitting. a very solid brew and one of my go to ipa's."
"I know there are better IPAs, but there's a soft spot for me for DFH 60, as my introduction to good beer. I'll keep a few on hand throughout the rest of the summer."
"-notes from 01/07"
"Draft, City Beer Store. Good IPA. I like this more than expected. It has a nice honey, citrus and pine aroma. Good looking beer - medium gold with a healthy white cap. The taste has a bit of malt extract flavor but is otherwise pleasing. It's fairly dry which is a nice change of pace for DFH. Not quite enough bitter bite in the finish. It could use a bit more hops, though they're certainly present and I'm probably being a bit of an IPA snob by saying that. Mouth feel is unobjectionable. Nice IPA. This is one of my favorites from DFH."
"o- a top 10 beer for me when served fresh and out of a proper tap into a proper glass, great affordability, and availablity really worthy of go-to status... rockstar"
"really good drinkability, goes down really easy, but still has a mouthfull of flavor. a really good beer to session anytime of year. ive had this plenty of times before, kind of a staple brew for me, but the first time ive had a chance to review it. highly recommended from me, everyone should try this."
"I've had many DFH 60 minutes but I apparently never reviewed it before. Highly drinkable and an excellent overall IPA. Definitely recommended!"
"F: Finishes somewhat bitter, it peaks at almost the perfect level of bitterness. Little grassy, touch of fruity and almost piney hops. A slight malt presence remains but by now its mostly dry. A nice finish with a crisp edge and good bitterness. No real flaws."
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. This is basically the classic IPA in my book. While the 90 and 120 Minutes and countless other IPAs are intentionally overhopped, DFH 60 is straight and simple by comparison, yet still has enough complexities to amuse and be extremely enjoyable. Will always be one of my favorites, no problem at all finishing one of these off."
"D: quite nice, this is an IPA I could drink multiple times in an evening."
"Had this on tap in Erie PA. @ The Sandbar by the Peninsula. 91 degrees, and IPA was SCREAMING my name. Pours a very clear amber. Small head but great, fluffy lacing. Aromas of piney hops, with a little bit of malt in the background. Flavor is concentrated; lots of malty sweetness on the finish, quickly followed by fairly intense hoppy bitterness. Medium-weight in the mouth. Finish is pleasant, not too long but beckons another sip. I really enjoyed it....again. I can't believe I havn't rated Dogfish Head yet, I tried 8 or 10 of the beers. Time to get drinking."
"Mild grapefruit aroma. Moderate carbonation and a slightly thin mouthfeel. Flavor profile felt a little flat at first, but this improved as the beer warmed. Dry, not too sweet taste of grapefruit, grass, and a toasty hay-like bitterness. Definitely a contrast from Dogfish's many other boldly flavored brews; this one was a little more subtle and really grew on me as I sipped."
"Drink ability: One of the more drinkable IPA's I've tasted. It's less on the bitter side meaning my taste buds won't get sick of it easily. Would be able to go through a six pack without wanting to taste something else. This is easily one of my favorite beers I've tried this summer and will continue to go to it as a drink of choice in the future."
"Taste is excellent grapefruit is heavily present in the taste. With light carbonated mouthfeel and a solid hop backbone makes this 6.0 % ale feel like its bother 90 minute, or any other double ipa."
"Overall one of my favorite all time brews. Complex yet drinkable, the flagship Dogfish brew, and I worship at Sam's beer altar."
"Notes: An idea IPA to have around, very drinkable and very flavourful. With it being bottle conditioned I'll have to try to make this a regular in my fridge. Unfortunately, it is not available in SC and I'm drinking it in PA. I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THIS FRESH!!!! WOW, a year old and it is still this good!"
"Pours an orange-amber with a lacing off-white head. Slight citrus and floral aroma. Great hop and malt balance for an IPA. Taste starts off with a nice, but not overly strong, dose of hops. You can tell they blended quite a few different kinds. Citrus, grapefruit, orange, floral, pine and earthy hops all combine with no one dominant flavor shining through. The hops are balanced out by a sweet, toasty, caramel, bready malt which brings the flavor around nicely."
"D - Very drinkable for an IPA, and with the 6% ABV you could kick back and take down a few over the days end. I liked it's interesting charred wood like flavor, but nothing wowed me about it, I'd have it again but nothing worth seeking out to me. I'm glad I finally tried this one though. Cheers!"
"I can see why this IPA is popular, it has a little aspect of everyone's favorite IPA. Bitter, floral, juicy, ect. At 6% abv and with its light mouthfeel i could easily session this beer."
"D- Very drikable for the style, 3 or 4 in a row would be easy and quite enjoyable (if you're an IPA fan)."
"It's far more of a universal hoppy Ale than their more famous 90+ Minute Ales which tend to have some liquor tones."
"Pours a light copper bordering on orange color. Minimal lacing. Smell is grassy, little citrus, some pine balanced with a subdued breadiness. Taste has a prominent hop, but one that blends nicely in the malt. Grapefruit notes. Comes full circle for a really nicely balanced yet hoppy beer. Drinkable IPA. Good work."
"Light orange color. Very clear. Medium head. Good retention. Aroma was crisp, fresh citrus with grassy notes; some nice caramel malt with some biscuity overtones. Flavor was well balanced and crisp. Middle-of-the-road bitterness. bitterness balanced by caramel. Mouthfeel was soft with low carbonation. Very good, but more of a session beer. This is not a put down. I have had too many ""extreme"" beers that fill the novelty niche. This one is comfortable and drinkable. Can I have another, please."
"D: Despite some flaws, this is still one i could put a few back of in an evening"
"D- This is a very good beer that is easy to drink, but can be easily over looked in the DFH line up."
"This beer pours beautifully, however the head can overtake the glass if not poured slowly enough. The beer has a dark amber color to it, with a fair amount of carbonation. The was not my favorite part of the experience, it has a strong urea scent to it which I didn't care for, but that was more than compensated by the taste. The taste is very rich and deep, with different hops tones throughout. It has a beautiful well rounded finish, and overall is a very pleasant experience."
"Mouthfeel- Medium-full body and medium-high carbonation."
"Pours a rich amber with a nice white head that laces fantastically down the glass. There is substantial hop aroma leaning more towards the earthy side with a sweet caramel tone underneath. The beer has a sweet malty body with notes of toffee with an enjoyable, yet compared to many IPAs I have had, light bitterness with earthy flavours coming from the bitterness which does not linger nearly as long as expected. Carbonation is strong, though not overly so. Over a single beer though this migrated from hoppy & quite nice to cloying. By the end of one beer I could not contemplate another due to the strong sweet finish. Maybe I am a West Coast IPA sorta guy."
"Pours enticingly carbonated, decent head retention. Color is ultra-clear mellow gold. Smells like dashing hops with a little bit of funk and candy-like, sugary overtones. A satisfying amount of bitterness on the taste, that of the American IPA - grainy, sweet and undeniably hoppy. Nicely complex. Finishes buttery. Good drinkability."
"D - could definitely enjoy several of these, the flavours are complex but generally subtle and nicely balaced, too bad I only bought a single..."
"D: One good thing about living in the mid-Atlantic is how widespread this beer is here. It packs a bit too much punch to be considered a session beer, but you can definitely have more than one in a sitting. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel may be suffering from the carbonation-explosion; a little flat and thin."
"D - Very drinkable IPA, sweet tasting blended well with a slight hop bitterness. Yet it had a great finish. Very nice brew that I would for sure get again and of course I would highly recommend"
"D - Highly refreshing and drinkable due to the smoothness on the finish (5)"
"Looks golden with an amber tint. Piney & citrus hop aroma with a hint of vanilla. Tastes bitter by nature, but isn't that the point? Excellent in that the hops are the primary show stopper. The malts do balance the hop profile quite nicely. Great carbonation. Great session IPA. While I prefer the 90-minute more, this one is right up there."
"This isn't my favorite IPA but it's definitely one of my solid ""go to"" IPAs. You know what you get when you pick up a sixer of this. To boot, it's widely available which makes this brew attractive. Pretty much a solid, but not out of this world, IPA all around."
"Drinkability - I could drink an entire 6 pack. Its a good combination between hops and malt, but the hops take precedence over the malt but not too excessive which is hard to find."
"Comments: A fine beer!"
"Excellent mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability. It's no wonder this is looked at as an example for others to compare."
"Overall, a really good moderately bitter AIPA . Highly recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - good BHT so will make the hops rotation for sure [O;Y;BHT]"
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a nice golden copper with a one-finger white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of mild hops and malt. The flavor is of roasty hops, with a malt aftertaste with just a hint of fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very smooth IPA without the 'in your face' flavors. This makes it quite drinkable and refreshing. I will be buying more of this in the near future."
"D - Very drinkable IPA with a good balance of flavor."
"Probably my favorite American IPA. Perhaps the only IPA I could session with reckless abandon. Haven't had another like it."
"Drinkability: Quite nice - seems like this would go very well with a meal but in this case (drinking it alone) I'm very happy with it."
"An enjoyable IPA that goes down smooth. Slightly on the sweet side for an IPA, and the almost nitro-feel is a bit odd, but still a really nice solid IPA. I'd probably opt for something else in the future (90 Minute is just as easy to find), but still a good one."
"This is my idea of a session brew. I could drink this all the time and if it was available back in Oklahoma, It would be a go-to beer."
"This is such a classic IPA, I can't believe I had never reviewed it. This is a staple IPA with great accessability, decent value, respecable abv, and relatively user friendly in the world of ipas."
"drinkability- i could drink a sixer of these no problem."
"Regular shaker glass with a smallish foamy head with good retention. Pale copper in color that is to style. Smells pretty good with strong citrus hops and a little biscuit aroma from the malts. Hop flavour is quite fresh and abundant. A nice mix of grapefruit and a more subtle earthy flavour. Nice balance of bready malts makes it very drinkable. Has a nice mouthfeel to it. Fluid on the tongue with a dry and bitter finish. Alcohol level is right where is should be for the style and doesn't come through in the palate. Overall, a very good AIPA."
"Mouthfeel is good, full yet refreshing, goes down smooth but not watery at all. Very nice IPA."
"Pale golden color, with sensational clarity and head retention. Bready malts up front in the nose, unusually so for an IPA. The taste is floral and grapefruity hops, hints of pine, with tones of chocolate malt, and a tingly bitter finish. This is more of a ""session"" IPA, for me. It's not gonna blow you away, unless you're one of the people it blows away."
"For some reason I haven't tried this even though I've had a lot of dogfish head's other offerings. I'm not disappointed."
"D - was one of the few craft beers available at disneyworld at full service restaurants as well as a regular resort beer. This is good stuff and is very drinkable !!!"
"beer does not keep a head"
"Pours a golden amber with a 2-finger head which dissapates to a thin film. Lacing isn't heavy but present throughout. Nose is floral, a mild hop smell of grapefruit, resin and grass. Mouthfeel is light to medium with carbonation evident. Taste is, at first, some citrus bitterness, then some malt sweetness kicks in - caramel, brown sugar, bread. Finish is some mild leafy bitterness. I wouldn't say this is a perfectly balanced brew but it is refreshing. For the price, ABV and availability, this is a go-to beer for me often."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It has a nice, deep golden color, with a solid, rocky, foaming head. The aroma is strong hops, pine and zest from the northwest varities that are used, with interlaced citrus notes (some say oranges, I think lemon). It has a firm and warming mouthfeel. The flavor profile on this I.P.A. is admirable due to its balance. There is a solid malt background here to compliment the hops. On the other end the warrior hops they use give it a nice, powerful bitterness that at the same time is so clean it's amazing. The amarillo and whatever their ""mystery"" hop is remind me of cascade on steroids. There is pine zest a plenty to take your palate on tree climb. Dogfish Head describes this as a ""sessionable"" I.P.A., which brings a smile to my face. In its own, Sam Calagione inspired way it is just that."
"Can I call it an average US IPA?"
"Superb."
"D: High drinkability. A solid beer. Easy to toss back a few of these."
"First time I've had 60 Minute in quite a while, glad I jumped on this fresh batch, very nice."
"overall, this was a fantastic beer. it poured golden amber and smelled of citrus. as the beer warmed, it smelled very sugary as well as a strong note of citrus. tasted clean and smooth, left a hint flavor after finished. i enjoyed this it, very refreshing on a warm evening"
"d - 60 Minute is a pretty good IPA. Has some nice pine and citrus hops and a little bit of bitterness. Have had many times and will definitely have again; a standard go to IPA."
"Great tickly nose, complex, bitter withour being spiteful.Long clean finish Wonderful drinkability. Keep them coming DFH!"
"D: While this doesn't possess the bitterness that I tend to look for in an IPA, the interesting flavor profile, full-bodied lightness, and satisfying yet pallet-saving, layered hop bitterness make this very drinkable. Definitely would drink again. - AB"
"Drinkability: Not a truly exceptional taste, but the smooth and creamy mouthfeel complements the taste so well, vastly increasing the drinkability. A long time standby, I am glad I finally reviewed it."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and slick."
"Mouthfeel is nice and bitterness isn't overwhelming. Overall it's pretty great."
"Like many people, this was one of the beers that introduced me to the American, specifically, East Coast style American IPA. Tasty stuff."
"A pint that I will have difficulty finishing. I've had better IPAs and I have to admit that I am disappointed as I've heard great things about this IPA and expect better from DFH. Again, I may be missing their intent and this may be exactly what they were going for."
"Drinkability: Personally I wouldn't have more than one of these at a time, If That."
"D - Very drinkable overall but it is pretty filling. Even though it is only 6% ABV, I don't know if I'd session with it. Very well-hopped. I look forward to buying this frequent and often as a cheaper alternative to 90 minute. This beer is hardly a step down from 90 minute, and altogether more drinkable."
"I can't think of many instances when I'd go for this over a HopDevil or a Hercules Double IPA, but I like this, especially if I wanted something hoppy but not too strong to make a night out of."
"D: Awesome. I basically sessioned this one."
"D: Excellent take on the American IPA. Very original and on the extreme right edge of what I consider the East Coast IPA."
"Could definitely drink a few of these with no problem. Great IPA!"
"D: pretty decent brew from DFH. I think I like this better than the 90min."
"Dogfish 60 minute IPA pours a copper color, with a small head. It smells bitter, and full of hops. It is very flavorfull, very bitter, and full of hops. After one I could always go for another. Overall a great beer, and must have, the only reason I didnt give it perfect scores is because the 90 minute IPA is even better."
"D: Very flavorful and relatively balanced IPA. Easy to quaff a few of these. Good to come back to."
"M/D - Medium to high body matches the intensity of the flavor and warns that despite it's great drinkability that this brew packs a punch."
"Overall - A excellent, straightforward, hoppy IPA... definitely recommended..."
"Drinkability - A very sessionable IPA with a hop-heavy flavor profile (without being a hop bomb) that still retains some balance. Refreshing, easy to drink, and a taste that never gets old."
"one wonderful and delicious brew, this is one great tasting beverage."
"D - About as good as it gets for an IPA. Could drink a few of these at a time easily."
"D-overall this beer is extremly drinkable delicious, not too heavy, and a low enough abv to enjoy it all night"
"D - Yeah my love for dogfish head is growing. I could see picking up a sixer someday."
"D- A nicely hopped refreshing IPA with a delicate malt note to even out the bitter quality. Doesnt quite look the part but very tasty and sessionable, but maybe not at the abv obviously."
"This is a really solid IPA, one I could drink regularly and one I'm glad the LCBO has the sense to stock (though it almost seems like that might have been an accident amongst so many mediocre offerings). I could session this if I was having a hops craving, otherwise a couple would go down just fine."
"The mouthfeel is great as well, nice and crisp. Very very drinkable beer--I'll have to try the 90-minute soon."
"I prefer the 90-minute, but this is a great 'starter' IPA."
"Great beer. Fantastic beer. Great example of an IPA."
"This is easily becoming my favorite summer beer, I hope to try the 90 Minute IPA next, and see how it holds up against this lovely grapefruit-laden IPA here."
"Drinkability: The most drinkable beer I have yet had. nuff said."
"A good product. Not a must try though."
"hobs taste grew stronger and stronger throughout the duration of the beer"
"It's not bad for a hefty hop fix, but drinkability depends on how much I'm craving hops, and I wasn't feeling it today. Overall, it's still fairly balanced, but certainly provides that strong hop flavor when you want it."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Like I said...righ now it's my go-to and since i'm from MD, and spend time in OC, DFH brew-pub is right up the street so there's a ""locals"" vibe to it."
"Drinkability - Pretty sessionable. I actually may pick up a six pack of these in the future (bought a single)."
"Seems like a fairly simple drinking IPA, maybe a better entry-level beer for someone newer to craft brew."
"I'm glad I only bought one 12 oz."
"D: Very good drinkability, but they said that too much of a good thing, can be a bad thing. I doubt they were referring to this beer, though. Very tasty, very refreshing, just a pleasure to the palate."
"Poured a muted copper from a bottle into standard pint glass. Has a thin hearty head with extensive lacing. Very well rounded IPA. The hops are pronounced, but not at the expense of subtlety. This results in an agreeable flavor that avoids the trap of overstayed aftertastes that I feel too many IPA's have. Drinkability is well above average, and the body is a lot lighter than you'd expect from an IPA. Another thing it does well is avoid the extra stickyness (in the finish) that you get from an IPA. Basically this beer is everything I like about an IPA, with all the stuff I normally don't like in an IPA taken out. Really enjoyed it. If your're in the mood for a nice hearty (while heady) IPA, then pick this up asap."
"D. Give me another cause I'm almost done with this one."
"D- A very good IPA in my opinion, could drink many of these, different hop presence than i expected out of Dogfish as many of their beers are know for being very strong (as I love) but still a very good beer."
"Pours a nice amber color, with a decent cap of white foam. Aromas of piney/citrusy hops. On the palate, I get more of the above (although nowhere near that of the west coast IPAs I love) along with a bit of malt sweetness. Nothing special, but a good beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden orange with a medium white head. Smell is lemon zest and ripened fruit. Taste is light in malt flavor, high in herbal piney hops. Very hop forward compared to the 90 minute ipa. Mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation. Drinkabilty is good I would get this again. A good ipa but not my favorite, I prefer more citrus flavors."
"D: Very drinkable. Went down easy. It would very possible to keep drinking it all night."
"D: A very drinkable IPA. The flavors are subtle yet delicious. Making this beer easy to drink but very enjoyable."
"D: A very drinkable IPA that I wish I could get more easily; a nice variation on the style"
"One of the top IPAs for me. Fresher the better. Good beer to get a buddy to enjoy try and IPA for the first time. Not overwhelming just outstanding."
"D - Very session able. Not aggressive in the least bit. A quality ""starter ipa."""
"pours a slightly hazed apple juice yellow with a nice white two finger resting gently on top leaving ok lace after dissipation. the smell is citrusy and fruity with a lot of fresh floral notes surrounded by pine and citrus hops mostly and sugary sweetness. the taste starts with a tart sweetness engulfed in resiny pine hops throughout and a pleasant bitter finish that lingers nicely. faint malt as it warms. a solid sixer and definitely a go to beer if in a beer decision dilemma."
"Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect but this was less than my expectation. Maybe I've had too many west-coast versions lately but this just doesn't seem to have the freshness that I expect in the style. I wouldn't hesitate to give this beer another try but I would assure it has less than two months on it. This one was past it's prime."
"The flavor is well balanced malt and hops with the edge going to the hops. It's light but flavorful with a crisp clean finish. A bit of herbal hops come through in the end but the finish is still clean. The mouth feel on this brew is fine. Not too thin but would benefit from a bit more body. While not really a session beer, I find it an excellent session value."
"D - The light body and sweet malts really give it a great drinkability. Nothing overpowering, well balanced, pleasant to drink."
"this beer is fantastic. not quite as fantastic as the 90 minute but none the less this is a great beer. pours a clear copper color with not too much head and a good bit of carbonation. The smell wasn't quite as potent as i thought it would be. Although the taste and the flavor ceretainly were. i would say that as far as the price and availability you can't get much better for your money."
"I love this beer. A great all around IPA, and something that I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Dogfish Head. Something that goes well with spicy foods, and my favorite experience with this has to be when I had hot wings with a bottle. Great hoppy flavor with pine strength all the way through, it's not the most drinkable but such a great example of how IPA's are supposed to be made: with tons of hoppy flavor."
"D- this is the IPA's of American IPA's. The discipline and attention to detail, creates a beer that displays what crafted beers are all about. I would recommend this brew in two ways... 1. An intro to great crafted IPA's 2. A drinkable craft session. Great job DFH"
"Drinkability is very good on this one. Relatively low ABV and a very interesting IPA that makes me curious to try again. Much better than the 90 Minute, as it's more balanced."
"D- Great session beer, great beer to have on hand."
"Pours an amber body with lots of carbonation and a foamy white head. Lots of c-hops as expected, grapefruit and pine. There is a light buttery cake undertone in the aroma. Tons of bitterness from the hops and a subtle caramel base. Not as balanced as the 90 minutes, but still very drinkable."
"M, D- The 60 Minute hits the palate with enough structure to be substantial, but not so much as to be overbearing; this beer is refreshing and satisfying at the same time. I think this is a true case of exceptional drinkability when enjoyed from the tap, where every sip tempts you to have another. Great stuff!"
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer is golden orange with streams of carbonation rising. It's very clear in appearance. There is a thin head made of white foam and soap bubbles sitting on top. There is a great fresh hop aroma with some bitter hop oils mixed in as well. It's very appealing. The taste has sweet hops up front, followed by that great DFH hop bitterness. The aftertaste is also bitter, but not too strong. This is an ideal IPA. It has a light to medium body with good levels of carbonation and some mouth coating. It feels above average, but not exceptional. I find this beer to be so drinkable. It's a great go-to hoppy beer that is easily accessible. It seems criminal I don't have a case in my cellar for easy access."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I have not reviewed it because I guess I was afraid that it would be so bitter that it would be hard to drink. It actually has some malt balance, while being different from the 90Min IPA. I am pretty pleased with this beer overall though I am not a hop-head. I would drink it again...so there you go."
"Nice lacing in the glass. This is an all-around good beer; looking forward to another."
"I typically don't drink IPAs, but after reading other reviews about this beer, I gave it a try and really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this one."
"Drinkability- This is one of my favorite IPAs at the moment. It goes down well but not chugable which means it is perfect. I like beers that you can sip and enjoy. The alcohol doesn't seem to be an issue with this beer. All in all a good beer worthy of try. I look forward to trying some of DFHs other offerings."
"I would drink this again but its probably not my top 5 favorite beers."
"D - I can sit back with these all afternoon. Got a few different beers for the first round of the NCAA's for myself and a few friends, this one went over very well, I ended up going back to this for most of the day."
"Mouthfeel - A bit dry finish, medium/light body and crisp."
"Side note: all of the regular Dogfish Head IPAs (60, 90, 120 minute) are brewed using a unique continual hopping process during a boil that lasts for as long as each beer's name implies. This provides a very unique and instantly recognizable hop flavor to the Dogfish beers. This method is actually patented by the brewery creating a flavor that no other brewery can directly match. I could also include the 75 minute and Burton Baton though both are blends that include some of the aforementioned beers."
"D- This is pretty great. I've always heard that DFH has made a great IPA, and I'm a fullblown believer now. Can't wait to try 90 & 120 minute"
"IPA FOR GROWN-UPS :) !!!"
"D - This was a very refreshing and easy drinking beer. I am not a huge fan of IPAs but this was something I would buy again."
"D: this IPA is very well balanced and makes for a nice sessionable brew."
"This beer poured a nice cloudy amber with an initial two finger width head. Later settling to a half finger width head. Additionally, there was some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was hops and citrus. The initial taste was that of hops, citrus and possibly some floral notes. This seemed like a somewhat light to medium (more light than medium) bodied brew. This is definitely a great tasting IPA and one of my favorites."
"D: I enjoy this beer. Easy drinking all around."
"D: Pretty sessionable beer I think. Not my personal favorite IPA but I'll probably pick this up again."
"(d) As far as drinkability goes it's hard to tell. I've had other IPA's that pair well with food, but this is one of the highest quality that I would return to over and over during a meal. Great. (4/5)"
"This is a very easy drinking, pleasant IPA for any occasion. I would like a little more hop character. I do love the very different red grape tones in this. Definitely not what you would expect from a beer."
"Finally found a pale ale I liked (Dale's), so decided to try another. Wasn't impressed with this one. A little hoppy but nothing special about the taste. Fairly drinkable but maybe a little too carbonated for my taste. Maybe I'll just stick to Dale's for now."
"Great stuff. This is my first experience with Dogfish Head, believe it or not. I plan on starting my climb up the ladder, from 60 to 75 to 90 to 120. I think this is a phenomenal bottom rung."
"Overall impression: Old bottle or just not to my taste? I suppose I'll try it again to make sure it wasn't the former, but this was pretty disappointing to me."
"In other words...TRY IT!"
"D - Drinks like nice pale ale, simple and balanced IPA."
"While very drinkable and enjoyable, in my opinion it lacks in any stand-out qualities. It does leave me looking forward to trying the 90 and 120 min. offerings though."
"D - not heavy or stifling as some IPAs can be. The mouthfeel is very good with no bitter/parched finish."
"Cheers Ya'll"
"O: No match for the Mid/west IPAs, no match at all."
"Slainte."
"Heavy! Puts the ""ale"" in IPA. Big malts make it definitely East Coast. Not an everyday beer, but some real complexity here."
"Pours very light golden orange, small sudsy white head. Retains well and leaves some lacing. Good smell, citrus, a little tropical fruit and a slight bready scent. Taste is faint, but good. Light citrus, apricot, and a light tropical zest to it. Floral hops with a slightly bready finish. Taste suffers as it warms up however. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but helps but the highlight of the beer which is drinkability. Kind of falls in the same category as SN Pale Ale - well-liked and accessible for the masses, easy to drink and but also quite tasty. I'm noticing it becoming more and more commonplace in bars which is good. A great beginner IPA."
"Extremely drinkable, I have to say the beer is night and day on draught and in bottle, but I have had eight month old bottles that exhibit really interesting notes. I prefer it fresh and on draught, but a solid IPA."
"I'd drink this all the time if it cost $3 less per six-pack. Even at its current price, I'm honored when I feel rich enough to get it on my IPA rack in kitchen fridge."
"D - Good, but the bitterness adds up quick on this one."
"Overall- this to me is a good starter ipa but not really a hop head's ipa. the malt just comes out alil to much and the hops could be alil more attacking but whatever... i would put this in a great beer classic category but just not a hoppy ipa for me. pick up a 6 if you haven't tried it. you won't be upset."
"I think this was the first IPA I ever had when I first started to get into beer. Plus its one of the few American IPA's we can get in Ontario, and I typically compare every IPA to this as my baseline for what I want in a single IPA."
"The citrusy smell of hops was perhaps the best part of the experience. The bitterness was nicely balance and was not over powering. Definitely a nice relaxed Dogfish beer to have with a larger group."
"D: As I mentioned, this is quite similar to a pale ale and as such, is quite easy to drink. Certainly one of the tamer DFH offerings, but sometimes that's a good thing."
"This beer not only made the American IPA my favourite style, but also really opened my eyes to the craft beer industry. I'm a bit disappointed that it turned out not as good as I remembered it to be, but I'm sure I was a bit nostalgic about it from the time I first had it to now. Still none the less an excellent American IPA, and one that I'll be happy to buy time and time again."
"Drinkability - This is a smooth, tasty East Coast IPA that the average beer drinker and the craft brew fan might find common ground."
"D - This was a good IPA. The hops are almost too much though as the bitterness took something away from the drinkability of this one for me."
"D: I'm not sure about this one, the alcohol content is solid, but the problem with this is the fact that it can fill you up rather quickly. If your trying to go all night i wouldn't recommend this craft. However if your going for just a couple of brews, I would recommend this one in a heartbeat."
"D/M- very nice and smoth IPA. Wonderful velvety texture and smooth finish."
"goes well in spaghetti sauce"
"Overall great fairly easy drinking (session-able) ipa with enough hop aroma and subtle complexity to keep it interesting."
"D- I could easily drink more than one of these, that's impressive since I am not a huge IPA fan."
"Overall, it is a pretty solid beer, and a decent IPA. It's good, yes, but I think it is a little overhyped."
"I will try the 120 next, maybe that is the ticket, but the 60 minute is just above average for me, esp. at $9.99 for 6. Needs more."
"This is a great IPA. I should disclaim that I've grown to be somewhat of a DFH ""fanboi," and I think that this beer is illustrative of the fact that their product lines deal in varying degrees of perfection. One of these days I'm going to hit the 60, 90, and 120 in chronological progression because I think each is the perfect preface to the next."
"A drinkable IPA, not as intense as others, but one I would have again."
"As good as any IPA that I ever have. Everything about it is the quintessential IPA. Really good hop aroma, great hop flavor, perfect color; just a great ipa from every point. I had this on a very hot day and it was a little strong for that but this is a never-miss IPA."
"Pours a orange-yellow hue with a thick white fluffy head. Aroma has mixes of citrus, spice, and grain. Taste pretty much follows the aroma only the spice part is a little bit stronger. Good thickness and carbonation; not too much alcohol in the taste, so it could be an anytime beer. Although for an IPA, I expected a slightly higher alcohol %."
"F.T.- This is one of the best beers that Ive had, but I scored it low because I dont find the taste and mouth-feel true to the style."
"D: Lower ABV combined with an excellent taste, easy to put several down."
"M/D- good mouthfeel, light-medium bodied. perfect for this beer. this is my session IPA when im in the mood to drink more than 1 or 2 IPAS."
"Homing in on taste specifically, the 60-minute simply does not offer the depth and nuance of flavors that the 90-minute offers. Both the hop and malt profiles are substantially more subdued. The taste is still balanced, mildy sweet with a fair amount of citrus. Some very slight bready yeastiness as well."
"D- good, but nothing spectacular"
"d - this is the IPA i keep in my fridge most of the time. one of my favorite brews. cheers!"
"D: Strange beer but I like the combination. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style and while the nose is a bit lacking (I'm expecting a little more over the top and... *sniffable) the flavor is not. Glad this one is a local as I'm sure I'll be revisiting it soon."
"Drinkability, I deduct some points for the high cost of this beer. If its price was $7 instead of 9-10, I'm all about giving it a higher drinkability. But alas, no."
"D- Solid IPA, but there are many better. The other DFH IPAs are great, so I think DFH could do a little better on this one"
"Overall, this is a pretty average IPA and a bit disappointing after the excellent 90 Minute I drank last night. It does a good job of being thick-bodied, but the taste just doesn't match up to the texture as it's just too light on the flavor. This would be a good IPA for someone who's not a huge hophead, but let's face it, you drink IPA's because you love hops. I'm probably being a little harsh on this beer as it's not the freshest example, and I would definitely have another one to compare."
"Final Thought: Absolutely blown away, Best in class! Even liked it a touch better than Big Brother (90 min)."
"Flavorful and very drinkable, but not outstanding considering the intense competition in IPA's."
"this used to be a favorite of mine years ago but over the years, i've tried a lot of IPA's. this is good, easy to approach, but lacks that big hop flavor i look for in an IPA. it is balanced, decent ABV, light and easy.... very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not for me. I have had this in the past and it was fantastic. This was an off batch for sure."
"The hops have a nice progression and stay on the palate from the flavoring all the way through the bittering finish. There is a strong and earthy malt presence that is making me think maris otter malt? Regardless, this is a very approachable and easy to drink IPA that is well balanced. Beware...a sixer of this can disappear from the fridge astonishingly fast."
"D - very smooth drinking overall"
"One could definitely assume a bit of roasted malt in this brew, something I've rarely pulled from IPA's. Malts all together are typically absent from IPA's according to my tastebuds."
"Great drinkability due to the perfect balance. At 6% this could be the perfect session IPA."
"D: Solid IPA, very drinkable."
"D: Easy IPA to drink, good stuff."
"Once served in a pint glass. Look: Light orange color, thin foamy head that never goes away and low lacing; Smell: Scented with pine and floral hops mainly, some citric hops too; Taste: Pine and floral hops, biscuity malt, the finish have citric hops and low alcohol; Mouthfeel: Dry, itchy and acidity on the tongue, high bitterness, between medium to robust body, low carbonation; Drinkability: I don't like the alcohol taste, isn't the best IPA i've tried, but still pretty good. Hold on Salvador Cabañas!"
"D: Goes down smooth, could drink these all night."
"Extremly smooth with just a tiny bite, that is just right for what it is. Slightly tacky but very enjoyable. Extremly drinkable. Not many words to describe this is just a plain good IPA."
"Cheers!"
"The body is moderately thick, slickly coating the tongue, which works great alongside the rich caramel malty flavours. Carbonation is a little on the high side though."
"D: It's hard to rate this properly b/c it's from an old batch, but what can I do. If I had a fresh bottle I could see this being good, but as it stands it lacks in every category and isn't pleasant to know that I spent a lot of money on this."
"Drinkability: Very"
"Good carbonation and mouthfeel for an IPA - this is not overdone as an IPA, but it is good stuff. A good model ipa for the style."
"This is a great drinking beer. Awesome for food pairings and it goes down smooth and easy."
"Poured from a bottle with 11/24/09 bottled on date. Poured into my glass with very pronounced carbonation. About 2 inches of thick fluffy white head. Appears a beautiful orange-like copper color. Citrus and pine hops punch out in both flavor and smell. Very, Very drinkable in my mind. I could easily drink a sixer of these."
"Great beer. I have bought this many times and will never pass up the opportunity to drink one."
"Overall - Good beer for when I am in the mood for a thinner IPA to drink ""more than one"". Watch to ABV however as after a few it adds up."
"Drinkability: More of a slower drinking beer but probably just because of the hoppiness. Doesnt ruin your palate however, and the abv isn't too excessive so its drinkability isnt bad."
"D: Decent beer, goes down easily, it didn't amaze or remotely wow me, but a good offering of the style."
"Highly drinkable. It's a bit difficult to drink just one. I could definitely see this as becoming a ""go-to beer"" for me."
"Drinkability: Not as hoppy as I had imagined; this, in my opinion, makes it all the more drinkable. That being said, I wouldn't count this as a session beer in my own repertoire."
"A nice beer to have with a burger or a strong dinner. Although I finished it in 10 minutes, it might take someone new to IPA's a full hour."
"Taste was similar. This is an easy to drink IPA, nothing wild or crazy, just an easy to drink, very solid IPA. Quite enjoyable."
"Like a step up in the hop department from SN Pale Ale. Great session brew, similar to SN Celebration with a less complex nose but a better, fuller mouthfeel."
"A go-to brew of mine that I somehow have neglected to review. Pours a orangy copper color with a small white head that leaves a touch of lacing. Nose is slightly spicy citrus hoppiness with a nice caramel malt backbone. A very stereotypical - if good - nose. Flavor is similar, a very light ""sprightly"" IPA. Citrus and fruitiness are the dominant flavors, and dirty hops as well. Biting hops on the tongue, especially as it warms up. Body is light with busy carbonation to keep things in line with the lighter hop feel to this beer. Overall, a nice IPA although I prefer it on tap. Probably not quite as good as the Hop Devil which is the alternative ""local"" IPA that I'd go to."
"Its a nice beer, but a bit too sweet for me. I think it would be best suited for a hot summer day. With the IPA market the way it is I cannot see myself buying this beer again."
"I poured the bottle in a dog fish head, special 60 minute offcentered ales for offcehtered people glass. it had about a two inch head, and on the way down it had lacing, I haven't done a lot of study on what the lacing means, but it had it. the appearance was like a bronze gold color which is good which indicates a nice malt hop balance. It was in the fridge for a long time so in the beginning the flavors was kind of stuck but as the beer begin to warm the flavors became more apparent, i began to taste the malts a littel bit more and the creaminess came thru. the mouthfeel was smooth. and after one and a half beers i felt a nice buzz with no food on my stomach. I bought a case of it for 37.00 for new years eve for non micro beer drinkers."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a half inch head that leaves ample lacing. The appearance is light amber and clear. The aroma is of strong grapefruit hops. The taste is stongly bitter and dry. They feel is medium bodied with a clean finish. This is an excellent and enjoyable IPA."
"Verdict: Though this is a very nice, well balanced IPA, it falls shy of perfection for me in that it doesn't scream ""you better have another one of me in the fridge or you'll regret it."" The hops are nice with a bit of citrus, and the malt is present but in balance. Better than a great many IPAs on the market, and worth a shot, but I'm still searching for my holy grail."
"poured form bottle to pint glass color of honey not much of a head and it quickly diminished to just a small amount of lace. this one was straight forward malt and hops. nicely balanced ipa with a dry finish. hops do not over power the malt this one is refreshing could make a session of this beer it goes down smooth."
"Note quite as strong of an IPA as I am accustomed to but well done. Balance is much appreciated in a style that is so often not."
"I am mostly sure it is the age although I must say for a regular IPA it does hold up over time. I repeat again this stuff is exceptional when you know it is fresh. This was a secret santa gift and the person knows nothing of fresh beer and all is well."
"Another excellent example of what Dogfish can do."
"I like this and look forward to trying other beers from Dogfish Head."
"D- I usually like my IPA's with a little more bite to them, but the balance in this beer works so well. I could see this as a great introductory beer for someone just getting into craft beers."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into room temp. pint glass. Gold somehwat cloudy in appearance. Decent head that dissipates quickly, minimal lacing, Hoppy smell with some citrus notes and slight alcohol. Taste hits first with strong bit of hops and citrus with malt backbone and sweet finish. Medium body and good drinkability."
"D - Very good IPA but too bitter for me to have more than one."
"D: I could throw these back all day. I finely crafted AIPA, but not quite as good as it's 90 minute big bro."
" This ale screams American IPA, the smell hits you with floral citrus hops and a bit funky too. 60 min pours beautifully, comes to a rest with gorgeous off white head and leaves sticky traces of its decent down the glass. First taste will take you to the pulse of the American Dream where you will not need Hunter S Thompson could go on for days about how all Americans should stock their fridges with this one. Do you want sweet malt taste.. check! Do you require Hophead bitterness... look no further. This brew was a favorite of mine before all those west coast ales started to push boundaries of my pallet with 7% + ABV.This brew can be a gateway beer for your non craft brew pals. It prides me to see this one on draft in my favorite watering holes. I am not sure if i would be checking this site out daily if not for stumbling on this brew pub in 1998 in Rehoboth DE. This ale sums up the flavor of fine craft brewing in America today."
"An excellent IPA, and an all-around fantastic drinker."
"Goldish amber color that leaves a decent head that in turn leaves some lacing. The smell is very hoppy with some citrus notes and slight alcohol. The taste hits first with a strong bit of hops. Not as much as many other IPAs but just the right amount for this beer. Its followed by a sweetness and a malt backbone. Medium bodied and good drinkability. IPAs are my favorite style, and this just might be my favorite IPA, or at least one of them."
"Pours a light copper color with a medium white head. Strong aroma of citrusy hops and grass. Lots of hops in the taste although it is not extremely bitter. There's some malt and honey in the flavor as well. Medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. Overall this is excellent, one of the better IPAs I've tried."
"D- Pretty balanced beer with no one flavor really sticking out. I really couldn't have more than two of these, there is something sweet about it and kinda gets to me after a couple."
"If you love IPAs, this is a must have. Lighter then the 90 min IPA, and less potent then both the 90 min and the 120 min, this is a wonderful start into the world of Dogfish Head beers... which happen to be one of my favorite. Once you have had this one, make sure to hit up the 90 min IPA as well!"
"D- Super versitile brew that is easy to drink, and could go well with any casual meal."
"This beer is a delight. It tastes like an ideal library: full of leather-bound books on mahogany shelves with a crackling fire on a crisp Autumn day."
"O: Very impressed, not usually a huge IPA fan but this one could change that. Great floral and pine notes give this beer a deep well balanced flavor to hold up to the bitterness."
"Overall- very tasty AIPA with loads of hop flavor that is well balanced by a firm malty backbone. Not as big as the 90 or 120 but bright hop flavors more prominent as a result! Excellent example of the style that would pair nicely with funky cheeses, a black and bleu burger, or some spicy chili!"
"I haven't had one of these in probably 4 years and can't recall if this one always had the roast flavor. I'll have to try it fresh on tap before reserving final judgment."
"This is an easily drinkable, highly refreshing IPA, and I could definitely put a way several of these without it growing old, especially on a hot day."
"Overall: 60 Minute is a good beer, nice balance, easy to drink, just wish there was more it. Worth a try."
"Supple mouthfeel in my oppinion. I would build a shrine for the 90 minute (and can't wait to try the expensive 120-minute). Aroma: Ahh there they are! What I have been waiting on - hops.. grapefruit, some slight pine, banana & lemon, my mouth is watering."
"I could drink a handful of these. Expecially when fresh"
"A fine beer, balanced and subtle, leaving the American hops to do their thing without being overpoweringly bitter. That said, this is American IPA light in my opinion and though it's good, you have to give the 90 or 120 minute IPA flagship status out of Dogfish Head."
"D: Drinking very well. Could drink this any time. I was very pleasantly suprised by this beer. Definitely my favorate Dogfish Head beer to date."
"Overall: Prefer this over the 120 and 90 minute IPA produced from DFH and something I'll be enjoying again soon. A must try. Cheers!"
"Libation: I'll preface this by saying that I tried this because I liked the DFH 90 Minute IPA. This brew is good, but I don't appreciate it as much as the 90. This is just a bit less complex and a bit too bitter for the flavor. That said, a solid IPA by any measure."
"famous for a reason, unpretentious by nature, drink when you want a real and balanced IPA. IPA's don't have to rip your mouth up to be full of flavor and this beer proves it."
"Pretty light session character to this IPA. Has a nice aroma with yellow cake batter, spruce, pineapple syrup and oranges. The taste could be bigger, sprucy, not much pine flavor, citrus flavors like light orange and lemon peel. The mouthfeel score was close to being bumped up, the head retained at a half finger until it was gone, carbonation was just right. Sessionable for sure but there are much better options IMO. Not as good as their other IPA's."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - If I could get it in Albuquerque, would be a regular purchase."
"Drink: Dangerously drinkable, great fruity flavor and evenhanded hops."
"I have had this beer many times but they just started showing up as singles in the government liqour store. Great IPA with really nice balance and plenty of hops. I could drink this all night. Not as complex as say Ballast Point but still a top notch IPA with great drinkability and balance"
"If you want a SOLID IPA from Dogfish Head, go with their 90 Minute, not this one."
"I still prefer the 90 Minute to this one as it has more fruity/malty flavors and isn't all hops. This would be good if you wanted something to drink while at a bar watching a game and didn't want to get bombed quickly."
"Medium bodieed, with some nice carbonation Very nice mouthfeel. Beer was hoppy, but teh earthy tones and the grapefruit were not off putting at all. Very nice beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. A clear gold with a 2 finger sticky white head. It has a real deep pine aroma. The taste follows the nose. The finish lingers with a pleasant piney resin on the tongue. The beer is medium bodied, well carbonated and very smooth."
"overall a sold ipa..nothing to over the top but satisfies the hop craving for now..however there is a strange acrid taste in this brew i get every time i drink ...its not off putting but strange and i dont know what it is.."
"Wow!!! This is definitely one of my favorite IPA's. I've been drinking a lot of good ones lately, and I keep coming back to the 60 min IPA. This beer has the perfect balance of hopiness/maltiness for my taste. Very drinkable, and a great session beer. This along with the Stone IPA are two of my favorties. Looking forward to drinking more of these!"
"D- Definitly a session beer that can and will take you where you want to be with a style that is untouched and perfect for any occation... pricey at 11 buck a twelve pack though."
"D: A nice IPA that you could drink a few of."
"Overall, great beer. Very drinkable and wouldn't sour your palet if you drank 3-4 during a good session. Will definitely drink again."
"Overall I find this beer to be one of the best American IPAs and perhaps the best on the east coast. I must say however, that this beer is best enjoyed as fresh as possible as age truly detracts from the delicious hop flavor and overall balance. Highly recommended."
"From a 12oz bottle into a pint glass pours a clear golden color with a thick off white head with good head retention. Taste is mostly of floral piney hops. Taste is sweeter than most IPA's I've had but it is well balanced and delicious. Drinkability is good, I could drink quite a few of these!"
"Dogfish Head's 60 minute is a great example of the American interpretation of this classic style. It pours amber in a pint glass and fills with citrus and pine aroma....Plenty of delicious hops (Warrior and Amarillo, I think), but balanced enough with malt to provide a ""session beer"" quality. Truly a classic and must have for any beer drinker."
"Solid gateway IPA that's interesting enough for the seasoned beer drinker as well. A great effort once again from Dogfish."
"Overall it's a nice beer. Not enough malt to be very noticeable, but enough to balance the bitterness. Has a nice finish. Very estery for an American IPA. Good mouthfeel and tasty balanced finish make it very drinkable."
"Drinkability- Excellent, I could definately go for another. My only qualm here is 6.0 abv makes it a little too strong for a session beer."
"The taste follows the nose quite closely with a bit more focus on the hops. Dries out a little bit more than expected as well. There's good weight here, not too chewy or thin. Great one to quaff."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable indeed. This would make a great session IPA."
"D- Pretty nice IPA. Fairly balanced for an IPA, but very drinkable."
"This american IPA will get your attention. I first tried this after Dogfish Head 990 IPA got my attention. This is more affordable that the 90 IPA and contains about 6 % ABV. Get the great flavor of DFH IPA without the price. Pours a golden color with little head. Smooth and not as rich as the 90 Minute IPA. Would recommend as a beer if your down a few bucks."
"D : Would love to do it anywhere, leaves you wanting for more"
"The beer is a brilliant pale golden orange in colour. Three fingers of dense off-white head is well retained and leaves a little lace behind. Loads of visible carbonation. Smells of pine with notes of caramel and biscuits in the background. Tastes of grapefruit and pine, with a toasty caramel malt backbone. There's a hint of oranges in the finish. Medium-high bitterness. Good length to the bitterness. Medium-light bodied with lively carbonation, it feels light and refreshing but not watery or thin. I just wish it wasn't so expensive here in Ontario. I'd make this a staple in my fridge if I could afford to."
"I could drink these all night, it's a very tasty IPA that's very well balanced. I'm glad I got a 6 pack, this will definitely be a staple in my beer repertoire."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA. Worthy of its reputation."
"Very drinkable love to get a case of this once every two months or so. It is also my go to beer when I have someone over that doesn't drink crafts. I usually makes a beleiver out of people."
"If you want to try this beer in your area, find a place that has it on tap or sells single bottles, but don't buy a six-pack like I did."
"12oz Bottle. Pours a very yellow clear colour. Hop bites up front, but they fade quickly. Very average IPA IMO, then again its one of only two IPAs I can get here in Ontario. So its lost its appeal with me and my average review could be due to having too much of this beer in the past due to lack of options. Pretty good beer overall, but there is much better out there."
"Medium body, with little but adequate carbonation. The sweetness lingers a bit longer than I would like."
"This was very similar to many West Coast IPAs, particularly Stone IPA. I am glad I gave this another try. The first one I had a couple of months ago was far too bitter and unbalanced. Not sure if this typical of the East Coast IPA style, but it was good. Probably won't buy often since other, West Coast, IPAs I like better are more affordable."
"This IPA goes down so easy, and is very refreshing. Seems like it would be a pretty good session ale."
"Drinkability is great!! A very pleasant brew that goes down easy. It would make a very nice session beer. I would say I'd like a little more bite but all in all very good brew."
"well worth a try I just hope you can find it cheaper where you live because here in Calgary it's over 20$ a 6 pack."
"12 oz bottle dating 2/19/09. Its been sitting in the fridge for a few months though. Has a copper color and white head. Hops dominate most of the aroma and I wasn't able to get much else. This beer has a lot more body than most IPAs, much like some out of the west coast. Surprised this one is only 6% abv. Drinkability is good, but I'd be content just having one of these in a sitting."
"Overall, this an easy-drinking, well balanced AIPA that packs a good amount of hops and malt but isn't as heavy as it's big brother, the 90 - making it far more sessionable. I was expecting alot from this beer and I think it delivered."
"As far as IPAs go, this is incredibly drinkable. The 6% ABV technically disqualifies this from the ""session beer"" category, but I find myself making a session out of this one more often than I'd like to admit. The malt is more apparent than a traditional IPA, so if you prefer straight-up hop bombs you're probably best off looking elsewhere, but personally I'm a big fan of the balance on this one."
"Mouthfeel is just how I like it for an IPA. Moderate carbonation, lingering bitterness, and a bit of strength. This isn't the most exotic IPA there is, but it has a lot of character and feels just right whenever I have it."
"Bitterness is not what I expected. Really smooth, almost no aftertaste. This is usually difficult to achieve with an American IPA since bitterness is centered at the back of the tongue. The bitterness in this beer is well balanced for sure. Nicely cut with the midpalate flavors. Mouthfeel is fine and as expected. Drinkability is high, especially for an IPA. One of my favorite AIPA."
"D: A nice, easy drinking IPA which leaves you satisfied. Not many flaws or wows to this brew, just solid overall. Still the high expectations set by 90 min and Indian Brown make this a bit of a disappointment. More of a solid standby than a must try, stick with 90 min if you're looking for the best of DFH."
"Golden-orange with a nice, egg shell colored head that's long lasting and sticks neatly to the glass. Strong hoppy aroma with a bitter citrus smell in the forefront and a nice backing of pine. The flavor shows an abundant hop flavor with plenty of citrus and pine but with a nice balancing of malt. Still, the hop is king but doesn't overpower the drink. A nice, light refreshing feel with a great bracing bitterness that is kept in check by the malt. This is a beer that should be a must have for any bar/restaurant. I had it with a spicy jerk chicken sandwich and it worked perfectly. Great for spicy dishes."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. Nice hoppy aroma and golden color. Tastes much lighter than most IPAs and the end of the taste is not as bitter as I would've expected and so is a very drinkable IPA. I would recommend, especially if you're trying to sneak an IPA into the repertoire of a BMC drinker."
"Nice hoppy beer. If you're new to Dogfish Head, I recommend trying this one first. It has the all around base of what their beers are like. Nice for just sitting around and taking your time drinking. The smell draws you in, and the taste is just as good."
"D: This is a good IPA, for sure. I'd like a bit more of a hop character that isn't simply bitter, but those are my tastes so I won't judge on that. I look forward to having some more!"
"Balance could probably be a bit better, and the slightly grassy nature of the hop character is a negative, but overall not a bad effort. Probably would not be my first choice for an IPA, however it is a reasonably good effort."
"Notes: Nice IPA, although I'm quite a bit hooked up by the way Dogfish goes about brewing, this one while good is not a favorite from their line up. Good US IPA that lacks a bit of melody to make it to the next level in this style. Reminds me a bit of how some PAs borderline the light IPAs and viceversa."
"I liked this quite a bit. Not as big as the 90 minute but the 90 kind of makes me woozy with the intensity of the flavors and abv. I noticed the bitterness of the hops in the finish much more than the 90, the 60 didn't seem to have as much malt to balance out the hops. Not as much coffee as the 90 either. Good go-to beer as I've seen this in lots of stores."
"This brew has a golden color with an off white head that is about 1/2 in with an aggressive pour. It settles into a creamy cap with decent lacing. The aroma is great hop goodness. Floral, some slight citrus, and a little malt as well. The taste is bold, crisp, has some sweetness in the front and a mild bitter bite in the finish. This is a brew that I could just sit and drink all afternoon. Great choice and will enjoy again."
"D - excellent definately one of the best AIPAs i've ever had. i could drink a sixer in no-time flat."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- This beer makes me want another, just balln' outrageous!"
"d: really great. Drink all you can!"
"Poured an amber color with a moderate head that faded to skin. The aroma was citrus light. The taste citrusy with a tiny sweet element and a bitter aftertaste. The feel was light bodied with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This is not an extreme beer, not the most bitter, sweet, hoppy, malty. Not the most, or anything near the most, of anything. This is a good, workman-like IPA that could easily be your everyday go to beer."
"D-not as good as some of the other DFH offerings, but is a good starter beer for those just starting to dabble in the world of IPA's. definately gets you ready for some of the other more robust IPA's that are out there."
"Taste-Nice, easy hops and citrus notes up front, then a lingering bitter finish but pretty clean and smooth. Very drinkable and balanced, would make a nice session and a great everyday IPA"
"+ initially, i was not impressed with this beer, but after a couple of tastings (including a side by side with a torpedo), i have grown to like it much more. it may even be one of my favorite IPAs."
"Drinkability: high, very high, its sweet and tasty, its not too heavy--not too light. I could drink this all the time and not get sick of it. It's a great IPA and it deserves the attention it gets."
"Overall: It's a dogfish, need I say more. Not as complex as its bigger brothers but its a full fledged staple for an IPA that drinks like a regular pale."
"Drinkability: Not necessarily the best IPA out there, but certainly one of the more drinkable. It doesn't have quite enough hops to turn off newer drinkers, but has enough to satisfy many a BA. A surprisingly sessionable IPA."
"Had at PNC Park, Labor Day, Monday, Sept 7th, 2009. Cubs beat the Pirates 4-2!"
"Very enjoyable and very drinkable. Does not strike me as an IPA. Oh well. Delicious, nonetheless."
"This is an essential Am. Ipa. It has a delicate balance of hop bitterness and roasted malt smoothness. I drink it often and each time I do i think it tastes more like coffee than the last time. But it still has great bitter citrus kick and goes down easy. Highly recommended."
"Easy drinkability."
"60 Minute is a good everyday IPA (yawn), and a good introduction to the style, because, or in spite of the fact, that it lacks depth."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0908-Tim"
" ~ I will certainly recommend this brew to my friends and will without a doubt enjoy many more in the future."
"A delicious IPA and a good one for people who aren't big hop heads. Dogfish Head always makes good beers so this is no surprise. Probably an excellent session beer although slightly stronger than what you normally want from a sesh."
"Poured a nice deep golden color, w/ much clarity. This stuff always impresses me, bursting w/ hop flavor like most American IPA's but has a nice sweet malty backbone as well. Also different in that, it doesn't rely on ""c" hops for its flavor, and has more yeat character than similar brews. Perfectly balanced between the malt and the hops. I'll always order this if its available on tap."
" Taste is very solid, nice malty backbone. A bit surprising how light the hop flavor is given the strong nose. A little low on carbonation. What keeps coming through for me is the maltiness. It makes this a very session-able IPA. Not a hopheads dream, but good for an initial step into IPAs."
"Notes: very drinkable, great single ipa, maybe the best east coast ipa I've had - near the top of dogfish beers"
"All that said, this is a supremely drinkable IPA which perhaps leans more to an APA. You could easily pair this with just about any meal and drink it all evening, enjoying that it's a nice craft brew."
"d: I've come to like this a lot more than the 90 minute which can sometimes be too sweet. Often found on-tap at restaurants with otherwise mediocre beer selections. Gotta love that."
"Cheers!"
"D: 60 Minute is quite drinkable. It's almost a session beer by my standards."
"Jordan."
"nice thick choppy head it bit my nose on my first sip it had a nice hoppy aroma the taste was a kick in the face at first then mellowed out rich malty flavor and finished very rough with a hop bite you can feel in the back of your mouth stays with you for awhile"
"Creamy and smooth for an ipa. Nice amount of carbonation. Dry finish very straightforward IPA."
"Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is a clear golden ale with a thin, dense, white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a full floral hop aroma with a touch of citrus. It smells bold and fresh. It's medium bodied and very smooth. It has a slightly sticky finish, but it has a very clean feel overall. It's slightly sweet and the bitterness is appropriate. It tastes resiny, leafy and floral. It's well balanced and makes for an engaging drink."
"D: A good IPA. I still favor the 90 as it has all of the balance of this IPA but with a bit more of a hop bite that holds your attention. There were times when I was drinking this that I forgot this was an IPA."
"D- great ipa. not quite as hoppy as some but I like the smoothness that the rich malt brings. great to have around for the summer."
"Aroma is surprisingly light compared to out if bottle. Hoppy and good but much lighter it seems. Doesn't have the same hop punch. Taste is a fresh floral hop. Not much fruit though I suppose you could see some sort of tart with a pinch of grapefruit flavor in there but it's mostly floral (and delicious). Mouth is like in the bottle lighter and easy to drink, not watery though. Very easy to quaff and certainly delicious."
"D - Could drink this IPA all night. really quit tasty."
"D - good beer, but I usually only want one before I want to switch it up. If it was a little less sweet then I could easily drink it all night."
"This is a tasty IPA in a more interesting form than most I;ve experienced."
"This is a very nice IPA. I would recommend this to someone who is working their way into the IPA style. It has good IPA characteristics, but is manageable to someone coming from different brews or BMCs."
"D- There will be no problem finishing this one if you enjoy an IPA."
"The appearance is rather average looking. Golden hued with a tint of orange. A tiny wisp of head. The arome is pleasant. Hop bitterness rounded out with a nice malt sweetness.The flavor is bitter hops but, not overbarring at all. The malt shines through to smooth things out very nicely. I was expecting alot more hop bitter. Medium bodied with expected carbonation. This is so easy on the pallate it's nuts. Crisp refreshing and so drinkable."
"I've found this to be quite drinkable on draft - will usually knock down 2-3 in an evening without getting tired of it."
"Drinkability: Drinkable in mass quantities"
"Pours a mostly clear yellow-orange with two finger white head, spotty lacing. Smell: sort of a musty toasted malt with leafy hop and a touch of alcohol. Taste: grapefruit and lemon and a bit of earthiness over a slightly sweet, husky pale (and a pinch or two of caramel) base. Mouthfeel: soft, medium bodied, with a drying sweet finish. First one of these in 5 years or so, I think this is DFH giving the finger to west coast IPAs, and it's good! but it's not what I'm looking for in an IPA."
"IPAs have never been my thing, but this stuff is pretty damn good. Not obscenely bitter, well-balanced, deliciously foamy texture... a keeper for sure."
"D: Could have two or three bottles in a night. Definitely a favorite that I could enjoy multiple times in a week."
"Citrus and floral aroma with an appearance in the glass of sparkling orange, topped by a frothy white foam head. There is a pleasant hop and malt balance in flavor, not nearly overbearing. Despite the somewhat effervescent appearance, this beer has an almost creamy feel in the mouth, a welcomed surprise. Overall it is a very good beer, an excellent choice for pairing with food as it stands up to strong flavors."
"appearance is an average aipa. golden in color with small head, minimal lacing. smells of strong bitter hops and tastes of it too. also notes of pine on the tongue. mouthfeel is average, had to knock off a half a point due to the strong bitterness and strength of the hops. maybe i need to have another one at a different time and edit my review but imo this was not a very well balanced aipa. i prefer the 90 min over this. still not bad if you prefer the hoppier/ bitter side of aipa's."
"Great session beer for the summer!"
"d- super drinkable, i'll buy again, kinda thought the alcohol content would be a little higher but i didn't mind the 6% at all, totally could be sessioned."
"A fairly typical IPA. Lots for pine and citrus going on as you would expect. The taste is very smooth and while the hops are present, it is not overwhelming. This beer is very easy to drink and paired well with food. This could easily be a session beer."
"This brew is a very unoffensive IPA, most non hop lovers would really dig this one. This is a very drinkable brew. Stellar, and a case worthy brew."
"The separate characters of the bittering, aroma and dry hops are indistinguishable, and pass smoothly from one note to the next in the palate. Even the flavors of the different hops used are transposed. And unlike many other IPAs, which tend to be all oars and no boat, this IPA has a very strong but silent ""beer"" foundation with toasty and malty flavors which holds all 60-minutes of hops together. This beer sets a new bar, and sets it high."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer and not too heavily hopped, which would make it popular at gatherings..."
"The body is light-medium, and a bit creamy. Plenty of carbonation to go around... almost too much; dries out your mouth."
"Mouthfeel is the best part of an otherwise ""okay"" beer. The malty sweetness and big brewery type of carbonation let this one tickle the tongue and cheeks. The aftertaste, however, leaves something to desire...like hop. I'm not always looking for a hop monster to rip my teeth apart when I reach for an IPA, but I do expect to feel some hop goodness. I don't, really. Though I like the citrusy touch more characteristic of West Coasters (and Two-Hearted), I don't always have to have that either. With the 60min, I'm nevertheless looking for something that's simply not here. Not only is it not a great beer, it's not a good beer. Even within a beer collection that includes something for everyone, there's no place for this 60min IPA."
"D: This makes me want to keep drinking IPA's. Dogfish Head has done this one right. I have already graduated myself to the 90 minute version and I hope to get my hands on the 75 minute and 120 minute varieties."
"Overall, I'd give it a 'ho-hum.' Acceptable, tasty, but I've had better. Given the price of this stuff around here, I'm not inclined to buy this again."
"Overall, a delicious beer, and I will remember it as my gateway into craft beers."
"It's a good beer to have with food."
"From the bottle it pours a pale copper/pale gold color with a small white head that reduces to almost nothing but sticks around for a while leaving lacing down the glass. The smell is hops, mainly citrusy. Nothing to amazing but a little above average. Taste is similar. Citrus hops mainly is all I pick up. The taste is nothing I would get to excited about but it's pretty refreshing and pretty drinkable. A lower ABV and pretty drinkable and nothing to hoppy I think this is a good one to start a new craft drinker off with in the IPA category. For me I enjoy this one but I'd rather have a 90 minute or another stronger more hoppier IPA but this one is still good. Easy to drink and refreshing I have no problem with this one at all, a great beer from a great brewery."
"D - An excellent IPA that will be a regular in this house."
"Pours an amber color with a nice creamy two finger head that stays around and produces good lacing. The aroma is of hops and earth tones. The taste is of hops and earth tones with a hint of malt to balance it out. The beer is hoppy on the front end and malty on the back end. The mouthfeel is dry. The overall drinkability is above average. It is a stronger hop taste than some IPA's in taste which could try off some drinkers."
"When poured into glass, the foam was wheat in color/almost white, thick and foamy, creamy, didn't dissapate but hung on till the end. The color was dark golden yellow/ light amber. The smell was rich and aromatic, a little sweet and bitter, almost a malty characteristic of raisons and chocolate, even a roasted wood. It kind of surprised me - an amber ipa with a very rich complex deep smell/ almost contrastic. The taste was deep and complex, bitter, malty overtones with a good amount of hops and wheat. Mouthfeel -medium-bodied. Drinkability - very deep rich feel of beer with a color that masks the identity of the true taste."
"Pours a nice golden color and the head remains throughout. The aroma is of fruit and has a nice floral bouqet. The flavor is also of floral hops and is a bit earthy. This beer has a nice big flavor but is not overly bitter. The beer is very balanced and is a terrific IPA."
"I really like this beer and was very pleasantly surprised at the balance and the smoothness."
"Pours clear and golden with medium carbonation, white/tan head. Smells like hops all the way, pine/citrus. Tastes of sweetness and hops, nothing extremely complex. Medium mouthfeel, not too heavy or too light, pretty much spot on for an IPA. Drank the whole six pack so the drinkability was pretty awesome, although after a few the hops start to get to you as with any IPA. Good, solid IPA."
"Definitely worth drinking. Mild for an IPA, but well balanced for great drinkability, I couldn't stop at just one. I had to experience it all over again. A couple times."
"the flavor on the other hand had a bit more to it. The beer started with a sweetness followed by an heavy bitterness. Not overwhelming, and a good mix. the two contrasting feels balanced out to a good drink"
"I would like to get my hands on a fresher bottle of this, because I definitely feel like the hops have mellowed out a bit. Was not as hoppy or bitter as some of the other reviews seem to denote, but was enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Not overly bitter, not overly high in alcohol. but lacking just a tad."
"Not a bad IPA, but I think I would enjoy this one a lot more if it was extremely fresh. I will definitely re-evaluate this one if I get to try it fresher. Solid IPA."
"Easily accessible and always tasty... A very reliable go to.."
"Easy to drink IPA. Would love some more citrus, but this is still solid. I could do several of these."
"taste is crisp, nicely bitter, grain, hops, malt, a touch of grapefruit, earth, some spice, some malt in the back, citrus, some roasted nuts, and some caramel, ends dry and bitter."
"Drink is good could be better but I did polish of a six pack of this and could of had more but the lingerie hop taste just kind of made me give in."
"Overall: Not sure if this was slightly worn out from the long journey from Delaware to Vancouver, but this was not as hoppy strong as I thought it would be. Average."
"Greater than the sum of its parts, better than many IPA's out there, yet still noticably the younger sibling to the ramped up yet equally balanced 90 Minute IPA, even at 6% abv. this could still be a great cheater session beer. A great intro for the uninitiated to the style as well, let alone to for a well dressed baby step into appreciating hops in an unintimidating manner."
"This is a fantastic pale ale. I've heard good things about Dogfish and I'm glad I picked this 6 pack up."
"12 oz bottle Pours a clear copper with a great white head that produces excellent lacing and is lasting. Strong aroma of spruce and some earthy tones and maybe some coffee malts. Has a lively carbonation, with an oily texture. A decent flavor with good hoppiness. A good bitter finish. This all blends togather nicely. Not as powerful as the 90 min. but still darn good."
" WEST COAST IPA BY GREEN FLASH!!!-- if your a hop head,.. this is the epitomy of the style. (IMO)"
"Drinkability: very good beer. one of my favorites."
"Great beer. This would be a good beer to introduce someone to the flavor of hops without overwhelming."
"Notes: One thing is for sure, I like this a whole hell-of-a-lot better than it's bigger brother, the 90 minute IPA (which I thought was just way too sweet and malty). This one is much more bitter from the alpha acids and doesn't have too much of them pesky malts to get in the way. I do wish the lemony flavors didn't smother the other flavors so much, but this would make a good session beer, nonetheless. Very solid IPA"
"Poured with a medium-sized, off-white head that diminished slightly, but hung around at a smaller size. Good carbonation and a nice, dark-orange color with medium haziness. Smelled quite hoppy, with some hints of citrus as well. Great on the palate, with a medium, slightly oily body. Fantastic taste - hoppy but not overpowering, with citrus present. Long-lasting, bitter finish. An excellent IPA."
"(D)- A great AIPA that can be put away one after another. Granted, this one was a few months old, but it was really well balanced! Great summer/fall beer due to its crisp/ refreshing taste and flavors. At 6% abv, this is an easy one for sure."
"Who knows what was wrong with my taste buds last night? I am just glad that I gave this beer another try. Highly recommended."
"Pretty aggressive for a standard IPA. For me, it's not the IPA I'd reach for first. However, for those who want a really powerful IPA...this is for you."
"12 ounce bottle (not bottle conditioned as in the picture), bottled on date inked on neck. Poured a yellow gold color, slightly hazy, bubbly thick white head. Foam lasts throughout the glass and leaves some thin lace. Lots of hops aromas, grassy, floral, citrusy. Alot of malt balances the hop flavors, and there is a good amount of bitterness. Citric, floral, and leafy/grassy hops. Dry bitterness to finish. Smooth, medium body, not overly harsh. The alcohol is well hidden, very good drinkability. Well worth trying! Nice to have this one available in Alberta."
"Poured a serious golden color with a great head that really hung around and laced the glass entirely. The aroma was straight up hops with nothing else much to it. The taste was an extremly clean IPA that was light and cramed with hops. The brew it's self was great and totally changed my mind on the 60 min itself. The mouthfeel was a little rough as to the amount of Hops but was not bad as to kill the taste buds. Drinkability is high as the alcohol is low only issue would be the strong hops killing your throat. This is a great brew and would be happy to serve to guests in the house."
"Wonderful earthy hop aroma. Thick, rocky, head with good retention. Dark copper appearance. Dark malt flavor w/ a balanced hop bitterness. Very earthy. A complex IPA with a earthy hop aroma, malt sweetness on a clean finish. A little heavy for a session beer, but I'd definitely drink a few with friends."
"Drinkability: One of the most thirst quenching IPAs even if (or because) it has less intensity."
"Taste: There is not a very strong hopped bitter taste, it is actually almost a toasted bitterness to it. Very nice taste with nothing overpowering."
"Received this as a gift from a friend who came to visit. This and other items I received from other brewers had a bottled data of February. Everything else I have tried has been fine, but this one is below average, odd given the overall average score here."
"A good brew. Great choice with a roasted chicken pizza. A worthwhile brew. Good crossover to help the masses realize what else is out there."
"This is a ""go to beer"" for hopheads and simple beer lovers alike. Clearly a strength in the DFH line and a beer likely to please most."
"this is a great IPA one the best out there ,if you get the chance to have this brew don't pass it up. I'll go back to this one often."
"Drinkable: very drinkable - I could session - I highly recommend"
"Review from notes. Pours with a quarter inch of foam and is a nice amber color. The smell is all citrus, with grapefruit dominating with some hints of pine too. The taste is bitter, not strong, but enduring. Bitterness is well balanced against a malty sweetness that comes to the palate. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, and leaves the tongue tingling a bit. A good coating type of mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty high, but the bitterness might be a downer after a bit."
"Great all around IPA, probably the beer responsible for my enjoyment of the style. Highly drinkable -> one of those beers you drink until you run out or pass out."
"Drinks very smoothly, lives in the realm of sessionably drinkable."
"Pours yellowish golden and clear. Fantastic IPA. Poured up a real nice frothy head with long standing wide residual ring. Smells great, almost abbey like with hops. It tastes, well... Good... Not overly hoppie like many IPAs, but none the less an IPA with tastie hops, seemed well balanced to me with a ""hoppy ending"". Great mouthfeel, somewhat complex with all sorts of great tastes. Not sure what kind of hops were used, but a good balance of hops and malt. Tastie to the last drop. Easy to drink, not so easy that you'd want to drink a 6-er, I mean 4-er, but one or two. Great IPA."
"J"
"This is a funny beer; it doesn't seem to fit traditional categories. If you want an American IPA - that BIG HOP FLAVA - you're not going to get it here. This beer seems subtle, delicate, wispy, ethereal. Not as flowery as the 90 Minute, and in some ways better, more earthy and grounded. I get a lot of coffee scents and flavours in the 60. Also sweet bready hops and bitter grassy malt. Or do I mean the other way around? This beer is so damned balanced that its qualities are hard to pick apart. It's never going to be a favourite of mine, but it really is exceptional in a way that's hard to pin down. Greater than the sum of its parts? Repays repeated tasting? One way or another it's gonna find you, it's gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha? All of the above."
"I would say its medium-bodied and pretty drinkable -"
"Even as a fan of Double IPA's, I believe 60 minute is flat out a superior beer to DFH 90 minute, and would consider the 60 minute a go-to brew."
"D: Quite easy to drink. Good beer overall. A good IPA."
"Another standby for this IPA man. Poured a straw/amber and a bit cloudy. The head was a couple fingers thick, white and reduced to 1/4 after a few sips. The smell is a little citrusy and piney with a nice malty caramel malt balance. The taste is floral, more pine than citrus like most DFH PAs. The mouthfeel is appropriately crisp with just the right carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, a session IPA if I ever had one."
"You'll enjoy this one from dogfish...yes, the 90 minute is better (can't wait for the 120)...The taste is the best part of this beer, which to me is the most important..."
"overall i can't say i didn't like it but i'm not sure i'd buy this again for a while, but i'm definitely willing to give it another try someday."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye=Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min=AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"this is my go to beer if i have no ideas of what else to drink/buy. always have some in the fridge"
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a light golden color with a white head and produces good lacing in the glass. First aroma is soapy, almost like a cleaning product. (It's not my glass because I've been rinsing it with tap water and not using soap) Light bodied with an initial spicy flavor from the carbonation, then sweet and toasty malt character makes an appearance, followed by a long piney hop taste. Good balance between malt and hops. An extremely sessionable beer."
"D- Very drinkable, definitely an IPA to session on for any hophead."
"Overall a very refreshing and drinkable IPA."
"The beer is bursting with flavor and is what I would consider to be a classic American IPA. I'm not sure I would session this, but that's only because I want to enjoy every sip as much as the first one."
"Drinkability: For the money I could find a better I.P.A. The unpleasent bitterness kind of lingers. I find myself taking another just to try and wash it away. The style of this is right on. But the hops employed on this one are not my cup of tea."
"I would say this is a less extreme version of the 90 Min. it has many of the same qualities with the bitter hop and sweet malt, but it punches you in the face a lot less. and that may not be a good thing."
"Once again, DFH delivers."
"D: Goes down very smooth. I would recommend against having more than 2 bottles at a time, but this is a wonderful IPA!"
"The brew pours a deep yellow with some hints of amber. Head is a bit week and quickly subsides. Only a few wispy rings of lace are left behind. Nose is a bit faint and a somewhat grassy. Flavor follows nose and although the flavor is decent, the grassy tones tend to dominate. Malt backbone is also a bit weak for the grassy flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit slimy, if that makes sense and the carbonation could be a bit greater. Overall the beer is just OK for me."
"Grabbed a pint on tap at O'Leary's on Beacon Street. Orange color with a hint of yellow. Nice white head. Good amount of carbonation. Smell was a bit peppery. Taste was quite pleasing for a non-IPA lover. There were hops, sure, but it did not overwhelm the beer. There was also a nice grapefruit aspect to the flavor that made it quite refreshing. This is one of the first IPAs that I have had in a while that I would consider having a second. Smooth going down and very easy to drink. This DFH beer is an IPA for the masses."
"A great example of an American IPA."
"Drinkable, and extremely enjoyable. Don't usually do this for a review, but the sixer went down nicely."
"Drinkability: This is a nice solid IPA, worth drinking and worth returning to in the future."
"There's really nothing about it that makes me want to drink it, but I definitely could."
"I liked this. It was a pretty basic and generic IPA and I would definately buy it again. The only drawback is that it was a bit ho hum. Reminds me very much of Sierra Nevada, and there is nothing wrong with that."
"Drinkability - one of these at a time is fine. I could do 2. Definitely enjoyable, I just don't want to get messed up on a bunch of these, which I know I would because even at 6% I could pound away on these."
"An IPA filled with flavor and drinkability."
"I'd rate the drinkability high on this one, taste is good and the low alcohol content make it easy to handle a couple, should you choose to do so."
"If you want to be introduced to IPAs, the 60 is definitely a way to start."
"D- Outstanding! I could drink a sixer of these and not have to worry about driving drunk because I wouldn't be able to find my car!"
"Pours a pretty golden straw color with a pretty tight head. Smells sticky, citrusy, piney, did I say sticky? Tastes super bitter and piny, just a lovely crisp bite. Its a perfect IPA really. Mouthfeel is a great amount of body that balances the bitterness and lends to the crisp bite. I would drink this all day every day if it wouldn't kill me."
"this beer is as drinkable as an IPA of its quality can be. Almost sessionable."
"This is a great and easily sessionable beer and let's just say it's an IPA, but it's an off-centered IPA as it was intended to be, and no bad thing."
"D- great balance, this is great, stands out from usual IPA's but that's very good..great IPA!!!"
"M & D - For an IPA, it is very easy to drink, with its low carbonation and smooth mouth feeling."
"Very nice beer. If it were cheaper and more widely available I'd make it my fall back beer."
"Quite a good beer. No big risks or overdone flavors, but a solid IPA."
"D- Good, although I am worried I got a bad/aged bottle..."
"I am glad this beer is finally available in California, it will become one of the IPAs I regularly drink in the warmer months of the year, all the good things I have heard about it are true, it is amazingly balanced and an awesome but simple beer overall, recommended"
" A full bodied, chewy, mouth-filling beer. A great IPA and a real pleasure to drink. Great brew by Dogfish Head."
"Best IPA for the price, in my opinion."
"Great IPA, overall."
"A regular in my fridge."
"I think this one is more subtle than the 90 minute. Of course it would be they are pretty much different styles of IPA."
"It's a nice mellow IPA. Color is right on par for what you would expect. Decent head when I poured it out, no lacing though. Some slight hints of caramel. Over all it's pretty well rounded, I could drink a few of these. I really didn't think that it lived up to all the hype though. I much prefer an IPA that kicks my ass such as Stone's IPA. Great beer but not spectacular."
"NOTE: cold accentuates the tongue's reception of bitter flavors, so if the bitter hoppyness of a beer seems overwhelming at first, let it warm to about 50 degrees and resample. enjoy!"
"Drinkability- SImply incredible such a great balanced and delicious IPA, i think for me since i was lucky to find this beer way under priced some where this will be my go to session IPA for a while, its just so good so balanced, doesnt try to knock you out with hops though brings alot with plenty of balance, great beer by dogfish"
"Ok IPA, not something I would pick up again though."
"Mouthfeel is slick with smooth carbonation. Very nice IPA"
"This beer has a nice medium feel to this beer. A very smooth feel to this beer and does not have that harsh aftertaste that some hoppy beers do."
"Slowly, 60 minute is becoming one of my favorite IPA's. None of the flavors dominate, rather they blend seamlessly together and work perfectly. Mouthfeel is medium with just the right amount of carbonation."
"D: Fairly nice all around. Formerly one of my go to IPAs."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop in Hazleton for $1.75. Poured into my Imperial pint glass and appears a crystal clear rich apricot color with about an inch of dense off white lingering foam. Smells and tastes of citrus fruits such as lemon, orange, and grapefruit, sweet caramel malts, bread/biscuits, and mildly resinous pine. Medium in both body and carbonation. Overall, a very well made IPA. Check it out if you see it around."
"D- Great drinkability have pounded many in a night and sitting ."
"Drinkability: Wasn't too thrilled by this one. I could knock back several of them easily, but there are some many other better IPAs that I could say the same for. This is a good beer, but I won't be buying it again."
"Dogfish usually has great beer. I bought this lucky sixer @ wholefoods...i assume they keep up with their beer stock. tasted fine, i guess i'm just spoiled with californian IPAs. it did do the trick and gave a decent buzz...but came short o flavor compared to other IPAs. still, worth a try...i like it."
"Had it on tap while on vacation in Florida. To be honest I'm pretty new to the beer scene, well at least good beer. this was exceptional though. I'm always one to keep an open mind and exspand my horizons and this definitily opened a new world of beer loving to me."
"Before I start I should say I'm trying to find a bottled on date because I suspect this may not be the freshest. Pours clear and copper with thick, 2 finger, white head. Smell is terrible. I do get some intense piney/spruce hops and touch of caramel, I'm overwhelmed by a skunky smell. I really cant put my finger on it, but its not nice. Taste wasnt bad, but again I hope this was a bad batch. It had some nice hop bitterness, with a touch of citrus, and it had a good malt backbone, more of a dryer malt. But still, something just a little off. Mouthfeel was fine, but a less than appealing aftertaste left behind. Overall not the best. I bought a 6 pack and took me about 10 days to drink all of them, trust me...thats not normal. I kept a bottle to see if I can find a freshness date and will certainly re-review if I did get a bad bottle."
"Overall Impression: I very good beer, but it doesn't taste like an IPA nor a beer of 60 IBU. I still enjoyed drinking it and they are going down easy..."
"could easily have a few of these (and have in the past). a nice IPA which is easy to get and really tasty."
"Only ting I didn't rate a 4.5 on this brew was the appearance. I gave it a 4 as I would with any fine filtered IPA, but I really do enjoy an unfiltered IPA, or bottle conditioned. Other than that...4.5 across the board!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. It would be easy to drink several of these. I will need to pick up more of this next trip to Wisconsin."
"D: Insanely drinkable. One of the most smoothest IPAs I've had. Great balance, malt and hop flavors are nice, and very easy to drink. A very well made IPA."
"D: very nice and light, i like it"
"It's got a golden-honey color with a pencil-thin head. Smell is perfect with a nice hop sting in the nose. Where this beer really shines is its taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability, all are off the charts. I'm hard-pressed not to give this all 5's. It was very worthwhile for me to have sought this out. If your a fan of IPA's put this one at the top of your to-do list!"
"Overall, this was a really good IPA, not what i expected, this is my first DFH brew, and I was impressed. Way more balanced then I had expected going in, pleasantly suprised. I could drink several of these in a sitting."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appears a clear golden color with plenty of white, frothy head. The beer has good lacing and head retention. Smells are of grapefruit and piney hops, there's a bit of a sweet backbone to it, but the hop smell dominates. Taste is also dominated by the hops, as with most IPA's. Plenty of bitterness and citrusy tastes. Most of the taste is of grapefruits. Very smooth and very drinkable, plenty of carbonation. One of my favorite IPA's at this point."
"I hear tell that many Dogfish Head beers are underattenuated--I wonder if that's the macro ick that pervades this beer?"
"Still early days in my foray into IPAs, but that being said, the 60min IPA definitely feels like a good intro IPA.  It doesn't overdo the hop bitterness, and still lets you dissect its blend of sweet, spicy and herbal note."
"D - Very drinkable, now one of my favorite session beers, and being that they are selling it at all of my beer stops these days, I'm all set."
"D - Real easy to drink."
"Sorry, I want to jump on the bandwagon and love DFH, but this was disappointing."
"Final Thoughts: Having never had a IPA outside of Alexander Keith's (which I know isn't a good example of the style) I thought I'd give this stuff a try. If this is an A- beer for the style, then this style must not be for me. I drain poured this at the halfway mark it was so god awful. The only redeeming quality is the smell, and there is more to a beer then a nice aroma. There is no balance to this beer, the bitter and dry nature is out of control. It's very rare I have a beer that completely puts me off of a style, but this stuff does it. I'm more inclined to try another Japanese style beer sooner then another IPA because of this beer. Stay away unless you thrive on dry bitterness."
"D - Def could have a few of these in a row. I actually like it"
"I need to go break open a bottle of 90 min. to renew my confidence in this brewery. But they are 0 for 2 tonight."
"D - While 60-minute is a bit more drinkable than 90-minute overall, it's definitely not as aromatic or flavorful than its more hopped counterpart. However, this is a nicely balanced IPA that is quite easy to drink."
"For an IPA it is a lot smoother than a lot that I have had. A good starter IPA for those that are just getting into craft beers."
"Maybe underrated for its uniqueness but overrated for its overall flavor. The hop flavor does not linger, but the toasted malt flavor does. Both are good together but don't form anything exciting together. I guess I went into the review expecting more in the way of hop flavor and character and maybe a little more complexity or something that would stick out. In fact, this is just a really good simple IPA."
"it's a good beer but i think i can hold just one myself- getting hop-bombed over and over is a man's job and i'm in diapers so far."
"Good stuff from Dogfish Head. I'd love to try this beer when it's super fresh."
"This is almost a perfect beer for the style. I wish it had just a touch more balance with some malt but it's still a wonderful beer to have available at all times. Good job."
"D - Great on its own or with food (this is the kind of beer I wish they served at baseball games with your loaded-up hotdog). Definitely an outstanding session beer. One of the more versatile IPAs I've tasted."
"Overall a great beer. My first time trying a hoppy beer and I was not disappointed. I would and probably will purchase this again if I can find it at the LCBO again here in London."
"D Much better than the 90 min but I cannot have too many of these."
"D= Very high. Despite the fact that I don't think this is an ipa it is very delicious. Well rounded balanced beer."
"- Very good session brew.. easy to drink, not too dry!"
"great brew, always glad to have it when i come across it."
"D: This was definitely worth the hype. In a world with unbalanced IPAs, this brings you back to the middle. I really like how the hops and malts mingle. I really like some maltiness in my IPAs, this beer definitely does this. I hope I will find it on tap someday."
"Poured a hazy amber-golden color with a two finger head. Nose is somewhat fruity with floral hoppiness and the trace of a buttery smell. Taste is more maltiness than I was expecting but well hopped and tasty. Like a woody, uttery flower almost. Good IPA and well worth try!"
"D - I had to drink the pint I ordered rather fast, and it was exceptional. Though this has never been one of my favorite beers from the bottle (I actually much prefer the 90 Min) it was very rewarding on tap."
"Overall: Very drinkable AIPA!! Very sweet and smooth. The hops are pretty mellow considering the style."
"O: One of the most flavorable IPAs I have tried to date. I look forward to trying the 90-minute and 120-minute IPAs"
"Clear amber in colour with a half hearted, fluffy white head that quickly disappears; crisp, clean, hoppy aroma, very fresh; crisp, hoppy, bitter and refreshing taste that doesn't seem to be as sharp as a lot of the previous IPAs; bitter, hoppy aftertaste"
"Good easy drinking and well balanced. One of my favorite IPA's."
"Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed this offering from DFH"
"D - A very drinkable IPA. This one is probably preferable by the masses as you progress to the extremists with the 75, 90 and the 120 is for the bravest of souls."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of head. There is not a lot of aroma, some pine, citrus, and malt. It is not as hoppy as some I.P.A.'s. I thought it was a very drinkable beer. I'm not a huge I.P.A. fan, but I do crave them from time to time. I think overall it is a pretty good beer."
"Looks light amber/copper in color with off-white head. Hint of hops but nothing that overpowers me with smell. Light hops, distinct finish, which I enjoyed. I really enjoy this IPA and could easily drink this all day/night long. Prefer the 90 over the 60."
"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. This beer pours a yellowish/orange hue with a nice tight 1 finger head. The aroma consists of pine and citrus. The initial taste is very nice but for whatever reason I keep getting a weird aftertaste. While I enjoy most of the dogfish brews this is not one of my favorites. Perhaps I had a bad bottle. Will re-review when tried again."
"Overall: Decent carbonation but could use a bit more it's light-medium in body. Pretty drinkable."
"Overall - A nicely balanced IPA; tastes like it would go really well with food. Will likely buy a couple more of these and have them the next time I make a roast."
"I have been in the dark and not tried this beer till now. Way better than I expected."
"Overall, this is a nice AIPA but there are better out there for this price."
"These hopped-up I.P.A.s are getting more and more expensive so when I saw a 6 pack at Meijer for $8.49 I was all over it. Nice deep bronze color and a huge white head like ocean foam. The aroma is not as overpowering as many of the other I.P.A.s I've had. Much more subtle aromas of pine and citrus. Almost an earthy plant kind of smell. It tastes more malty than I had expected. Not to say that malty is one of the top characteristics of this beer, because it's not, it just has a sweeter type of malty taste than I expected. The flavor is very mild. I detect the bitterness from hops and the piney aftertaste and just barely a hint of citrus fruit. Nice almost creamy texture and medium body. Pretty easy drinking. The beer is now 3/4 gone and foam residue is stuck to the wall of the glass and refuses to dissappear. This is a pretty easy drinking six-percenter. A mild I.P.A.... In a good way."
"D- Nice brew but those bitter hops can take their toll on your taste buds if you want to have more than a couple."
"Golden honey blonde with a pure white head of suds that leave fine lace on the glass. Smells like citrus hop and cake batter with faint herbal notes. Tastes fresh and floral with fruity grapefruit and lemon zest and buttery grain. Medium bodied with a slippery resinous mouthfeel. Very refreshing, one of the best."
"Final Thoughts - I would definitely call this my standard IPA if it wasnt for the price. Great beer overall. Well worth the price, try this beer from the ingenous brewers known as Dogfish Head."
"A staple IPA to have around, to be certain. Not as complex as the 90 or 120 minute varieties, but a solid if not monster IPA in and of itself."
"Poured into a pint glass, I would describe the color as a slightly light amber. The scent is of grapefruit, orange, and pine...all the prereq's for a great IPA. I loved that the hops taste was balanced perfectly between the citrus and pine. It often seems that these two flavors tend to lean too far to one side. The beer leaves nice lacing, although I didn't realize it until the conclusion of my very short tasting. Although I could have just been thirsty, this beer went down quick! Taste was superbly balanced and easy to drink and with the lower ABV, I can see why Dogfish refers to it as ""the session beer for hardcore beer enthusiasts"""
"drinkability: classic IPA, perfect"
"The 60 Minute is my least favourite of Dogfish Head's hoppy trio and it has nothing to do with the fact this is a lower strength beer. Not entirely for subjective personal taste either, although that surely has a lot to do with it. It's because I've found a lot of inconsistency bottle to bottle and quite simply, I've come across many better crafted IPA's."
"D - This is a sessionable IPA, not going to blow you away with hops or complex flavors, but you will be able to drink several of these while watching a game"
"I'm not a huge IPA fan but this beer has opened my eyes a bit to how balanced one can be. Great job DFH just wish it were cheaper :S"
"I like the 90 minute better, but at $9.99 for a 6-pack when you pay the same price for only a 4-pack of 90 min. The 90 minute is better, but not so much better that I would give up two extra bottles for it."
"Love it. DFH is readily available on the east coast."
"D: Above average drinkability. Moderate ABV, clean, clear, not too terribly unbalanced, although it definitely leans more towards hop character than anything else."
"I'm going to re-review this beer, I've had quite a few of them since my first opinion on it, and I said then that I thought it was a grower: I can certainly confirm that suspicion now. I found it initially a bit of a strange beast, especially in the aroma, but it seems to have found its niche with me. I'm still impressed with the drinkability of this beer, it's clean and refreshing and I can knock a couple of them back with ease. Something about the smell and taste turned me off in my first review, but the clean, fresh hoppiness of this beer has become something I can certainly live with. It's not astonishing, but if I can get it I will certainly drink it, ideally without taking it too seriously. I still want to try the 90 Minute though!"
"D: Very astringent and palette killing despite not having the very present hops flavors I enjoy. Very strange for such a drinking experience to come from an IPA with such subdued hops. The malt does balance the aftertaste."
"D: I could see buying a few sixers of this, which was a great surprise considering I am not a fan on the style. But this is very very good. The IPA for people who don't like IPA..."
"I feel lucky that this was my first voyage into microbrewing, because it is a phenomenal beer. I've come a long way since I bought that first 6 pack, but it is still the standard for me. This is the best ~6% IPA on the market. No IPA matches it's drinkability while still being complex and aggressive. If you are a veteran of IPA's this offering might seem underwhelming, but in my opinion it is the definition of the style. If you don't like the 60m IPA then you will never like IPA."
"A solid IPA, but not the best out there. If you have the choice between 60 minute, and 90 minute, go for 90 minute."
"d-i'd session this, easily...but i would like to slalom and session this and two other PA/IPAs...just to train the tasting apparatus to hone in on the subtle differences. out of nowhere, i can see this making friends with manchego cheese and walnuts. but for now i am content to knock this out as it is. congrats DFH, again. i hope the 90 minute proves as astounding. or moreso..."
"Bottled on 12-11-08. Pour into Stella glass. Slight head diminishing to very thin head. Clear medium amber color. Okay, this aroma is not like I've encountered in my recent foray into APAs and IPAs. I do not like the smell! Yeasty to me. More ""woody"" aroma and bitter taste than the Libery Ale, Odell, Goose Island and Bridgeport IPAs. It gets better with each taste, but overall give me the other ones anyday. I read where someone said only get it on tap, that if bottled it gets bad - well this one is 2 1/2 months from bottled date, maybe that has something to do with my experience. Purchased room temperature from a store one week ago and it has bee in 38-40 degree fridge temperature since. I'd like to give a better rating, as I do enjoy beer, but this one is at the bottom of the category for me at this time. Maybe next time...Okay, let's move on to next time - a week later. Even worse - hated drinking it. If anyone reads this and works for the Delaware brewery, send me some stuff to change my mind or get the hell out of business. Sorry, but what a waste of my hard-earned $$$"
"D: totally easy to drink, with no alcohol perceived, solid flavor, etc"
"D - Easy to drink, as its thin and un-complex. However the taste just isn't there."
"I had a much better example at this beer at the Gaithersburg MD, Dogfish Head Restaurant (they don't brew there). My favorite was a hand mixed version of the 60 min and 90 min that I thought was outstanding."
"Taste is smooth. Just what you'd expect from a PA, but with more character due to the extra hops. A great session beer, I had finished 3 of these before I even knew it. This has made me very eager to try the DFH 90. I think this would also be great as an intro for someone curious about the IPA style."
"D - definitely not my favorite IPA. it's too bitter for my tastes."
"Mouthfeel is good - it's crisp as anything - but it did feel a little watery. Very refreshing, great carbonation. Extremely drinkable with the lower ABV. A great beer to either sit and enjoy or to session with, in my opinion."
"Easy to drink this one but the disappointing smell keeps this IPA well below the top tier."
"really enough has been said about this beer for everyone to get the idea. the only thing i'd like to note is that out of the bottle, this beer really only tastes great for a few days after bottling. it seems to go downhill very quickly after that. from a well maintained and clean tap line and served at the proper temperature, this is really an outstanding beer. in my opinion, worth it on tap and a pleasure every time, but the bottle imbiber should beware."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"The beer goes down easily, and is exceptionally tasty."
"A solid IPA that claims to be nothing but."
"D - 5.0- This is on of my favorite IPAs to date, balanced but hoppy and not to strong for sessions @ 6.0% ABV!"
"this is a great ipa with a low abv @ 6% for an ipa ... it pours a beautiful apricot color.. with outstanding lacing ...the smell is an oily hoppy floral malty citrus smell ..nice ...the taste is great its bready, doughy.malty all with a lingering oily hop taste nice.. it just slides down and you have soon finished and you want another.... i like ipas and this is in my top 10 ipa's..i like this ipa it is on the rotation."
"Taste is a combination of big, malty body, bread and biscuit, not overly sweet, combined with the firm pine and citrus hit of the hops at the end, though the bitterness waits to come on in the finish. Excellent, well balanced IPA -- went great with steak fajitas."
"D- Very drinkable and session worthy at a nice price. One of the more drinkable beers out of the DFH lineup. This is not as good as I thought it was 5+ years ago when i loved it. Perhaps my palette changed or the recipe has, or a bad bottle. Anyway give this one a go"
"D~ Solid. If you like hops then go buy a six pack of this beer as soon as you can. I enjoyed it."
"DM - was perfectly carbonated along with the balance made it more drinkable than I was expecting. A great beer and near session status."
"D - Aside from the bitterness this is a decent IPA. There are ones as good or better for cheaper in my area but it was still fun to try."
"12oz bottle poured into a Perfect Pour glass. Pours a nice huge white head with a lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The colour is an reddish-orange hue. Pine, pine and more pine did I say some pine and some grapefruit. Their is a slick oily feel from the hops that coats the tongue. This is a very nice classic IPA with enough malt backbone to balance out the piney hops."
"Taste is pleasant and slightly bitter yet not overwhelming in any regard. Rather viscous in feel and with an oily sweetness. A bit chalky in the finish and a bit dry. Overall offers a mild hop nose with moderate sweetness not unlike many an APA."
"D: A lower ABV, makes have more than one of this very tasty IPA enjoyable."
"D- A solid IPA that you can never go wrong with. I miss being in Maryland and getting this really fresh on tap."
"The best IPA I've had to date. The hops makes a huge presence, but the malt helps to balance this one out a good bit."
"Not heavy or light, just right with slickness, a very solid IPA for the money."
"A a clear golden color with a big white rocky head.Aroma is piny with oganges,spice and toasty grain,and this tiny hint of toffee or caramel. Flavor starts sweet and slides to a spicy citrus and floral end. A nice hoppy bitter finish,but not dry or sticky,yet a medium mouthfeel,just the right amount of carbonation. A very well crafted beer. Wish I had more."
"Medium bodied and refreshing. This is one fine IPA."
"I could drink a whole lot of these, but one is perfect with some spicy curry as well. I doubt I would choose to drink with this one without the appropriate food, but it seems to be one of those that you don't wanna stop drinking once you've gotten the right start"
"Unfortunately the best part about this was the appearance. I don't think I'll be buying this one again."
"Drinkability: I like this. It is different from most IPAs. It hits citrus without being bitter. I know it is high abv, but I could almost session this. This is a wonderfully drinkable beer. The best Dogfish I have had to date."
"Orangish brown with a thick tan head. The nose has a bouquet of fresh hops along with a solid malt profile. Well balanced flavor has sweet bready malts accompanied by bitter fruity hops. Medium to full body is well carbonated. A great brew from Dogfish and one of the better IPA's around."
"The IPA that introduced me into the style. The beer pours a lighter color than many other American IPAs, a clear gold that doesn't quite get to copper. The head is offwhite and leaves an impressive curtain of lacing. The smell is (surprise) citrus and not overpowering. The taste is outstanding, just what an IPA should be. Strong hop presence without killing the palate with bitterness. For this reason, the mouthfeel is very good. The drinkability is also great. I could drink these things all night."
"A beer to sit and enjoy. Well crafted with good flavor and is sharp but not overpowering."
"12 oz bottle Pours a clear gold with a touch of orange. Off-white head. Nose contains lots of citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon), with a light malty background. Flavor is much the same, with hints of floral hops and a touch of pine in the finish. Fairly bitter, but not so much that it ruins your palate. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic IPA."
"The taste is dry but refreshing. A very nice bite from the citrus and dry hops. Very clean sip and finish. Not a hop bomb, but hops trounce on every other aspect of this beer in a good way. Some nice lemon flavors are noticeable. All in all, an easy drink and would not hesitate to have again, and would love to try it on tap."
"The flavor is complex and satisfying. A very unique IPA one of my favorite refrigerator guests. They do not stay around very long though. Thanks DFH for this kick ass brew."
"On tap at Old Havana Cigar Co in Cartersville, GA. Poured into pint glass. Pale golden in color with an aroma of fresh hops. Thin off white head that quickly diminishes. Taste of mildly citrusy hops that give to a small malty character. Not high in ABV so it is easy to drink more than a few. Very good session beer. Not as strong as 90 min but still quite tasty. I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't had it before. Cheers"
"D= A classic American IPA with lots of hops and solid flavors throughout. Pairs well with smoked foods, pizza, barbecue, etc. Highly sessionable and very much recommended."
"A very good IPA and it's pretty much one of my standards at the bar."
"Overall: Dogfish Head has done an excellent job of distinguishing this IPA from others. The pronounced bitterness, beautiful biscuit/hop symmetry, and distinct citric finish make this an ideal session beer. At $14.95 a six pack, I'm glad I got my money's worth."
"The point is that I once put this beer on a pedestal, now i just return it for the five cents."
"D- The most drinkable Dogfish Head that I've had so far. I like the 90 minute's taste better, but this one is much easier to drink. A good session beer. Awesome IPA."
"D - Goes down easily. This is a good IPA to drink with food and not have to pay much attention to. I'll finish my sixer and then probably won't bother revisiting again."
"Cant wait to try the 90 minute."
"Nikki"
"Golden yellow color of excellent clarity, the clean white head comprised of tiny, swiftly dissolving bubbles. The nose has scrubbing, cleansing feel to it, coal tar, orange peel, sourdough bread, yeast, forest floor growth, the hops act more as a skeletal structure, leaving open spaces between the beams, for all the power it has at first sniff, graceful as it drifts off. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and much hoppier, however, with each additional sip you think it might actually pass for a pilsner. It's crisp, fresh and invigorating to drink, dries the mouth out in the way that makes you drink more. Tea leaf, tar, earth and grass, dried apples, oats, the carbonation quickens the pace and nowhere near overbearing. Nothing really sweet going on yet not bitter as a result, well-balanced. Goes down quickly."
"Thanks to Don H for this bottle and the other five new brews he brought to work for me."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with 1/4 inch of bright, white head with dense, tight bubbles. Head dissipated fairly quickly, but left strong, sticky lacing. A beautiful orange-gold color, absolutely beautiful beer. Not a lot of hop aroma, the aroma was slightly underwhelming. The flavor was much crisper and sharper than the aroma would indicate. Nice, round hop presence without being a tastebud killer. Average body for an IPA, not a lot of fullness, but also not watery. Very drinkable if you are inclined to session an IPA, this would be an excellent choice as this will not burn your tongue, and the lower alcohol will keep you vertical. A very good, reliable brew."
"(I don't knwo what the coffee flavor was about, I thought it might have been that my wife used my pint glass for coffee and just rinsed it clean or something; but the coffee notes were coming from the bottle as well. My previous review did not indicate coffee flavors... confusing.)"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a light amber with a finger and a half of frothy head. Smell is in your face hops. Very citrusy and piney smell. Taste is also very citrusy and piney with biscuitlike malts immediately backing it up. Also hints of peanut which I've never encountered before in an IPA. Good drinkability and a good example of an IPA."
"Maybe its the different hop character, maybe its the low 6.0 ABV, but it feel that this beer is holding something back. Next up, 90 minute."
"D-Very intriguing beer.Great taste,great smell.Has some good food pairing possibilities."
"Notes: perfect for introducing someone to IPAs. love DFH, but there are so many better IPAs than this."
"Drinkablity is through the roof on this IPA. More subdued than it's big brother 90min IPA, leaning more on a pilsner-like lightness with a hopped spike of Dogfish goodness. Extremely well balanced IPA,a wonderfully drinkable session brew"
"D: Is especially high for an IPA. I had a few down before I knew it."
"Over all I would say its a pretty good beer but am not sure how often I would want to drink it."
"Pours an amber golden color body, very fizzy. Has a huge head, white, good lacing, slowly diminishing. A very hoppy aroma, pale, and dry. Bitter taste, semi-sweet aftertaste, semi-pale, semi-bitter. Good balanced taste."
"Wow Wee! Many have attempted, and many have fell short. This brew is something special - 60min of one succulent hop being kicked around like a soccer ball. Simply delicious and nutty on the aroma. Some may pass it up and just say... ""It's ok, a little too hoppy for me"" - and that when I'm still taking a sniff and taking twice, who wants to get naughty with this brew? Nobody! Now - mind you, I've had it on tap at the Brewery in Rehobeth Beach and at the brewery in Milton, DE. Bottles are great! Draft will make you begging for more. Enjoy!"
"Mouthfeel: Overall, I've found my new favorite IPA. This one has everything I expected from DFH, a bold brew that is perfect to session compared to the 90min, which comes off a little sweet and over-hopped. If you want a sure fire hop treat this is for you! EXCELLENT!"
"still gets pretty good marks from me, real good but not profoundly good"
"Had a bottle of this last night. Pretty tasty stuff. The aroma is strange. Not bad, but different. Very distinct. The taste is excellent. Butter smooth, really nice hop flavor. Hoppy, but not overpowering in any manner. The malt character is excellent. Smooth, easy drinking sessionable IPA. I will buy this again for sure."
"One of my wife's favorite IPA's she just proclaimed so I will submit that comment as well. Can't argue with that :-)"
"Good IPA, not strong like most, but very balanced. A great one to try if you have never tried this style and would like to know what its about before getting into some of the more hoppy IPAs that turn many people away when they first try them."
"Taste has a bitter hop start with a smooth finish that leaves little after taste. Like the smell I seem to be getting a bit of a watery bourbon finish. Mouthfeel is ok, but I think this one might be a little too carbonated. Drinkablity is good, but I don't think I would put this one at the top of my IPA list."
"Someday I will purchase a 6 pack of this and enjoy more than 1. In the meantime, I will continue with my very expensive hobby of purchasing different varieties."
"Pours a clear amber color with 2 fingers of foamy off-white head. Average retention and some spotty lacing stick. Smells of earthy hops, sweet fruits, grains, caramel, biscuits, and a touch of pine and alcohol. Taste starts out with citrus notes and a touch of ripe fruits then a bready backbone with some caramel sweetness. Finish is very earthy with a mild pine resin notable as well. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and balanced with a pleasant bitterness that isn't too extreme but also not too weak. Easy to drink, refreshing, and enjoyable; quite sessionable."
"Drinkability is excellent. Would drink all day and not get tired of this beer. Perfection in a bottle, without the words Extreme or Imperial to be seen anywhere."
"D - Very drinkable and well-balanced IPA. I think this will be in the regular rotation when warmer weather comes along."
"D- A session beer by my definition. 6% ABV. So light and smooth that I could easily pound a few down."
"This is what an IPA should be all about. True blue hoppy though and through.... I loved the hops on this beer, but the enjoyment didn't stop there. A clean finish with an aftertaste that is out of this world. I always liked Dogfish, but this beer really confirmed my decision. I am not huge on IPA, but this beer really changed my feelings."
"Still, a good beer. Doubt I'd pay 12.99 for a six-pack or whatever they charge at my liquor store, though."
"Pretty drinkable."
"D - A pretty good IPA...DFH knows what they are doing...now I will have to try the 90 min."
"Thanks to bobsy for this one!"
"d: a really interesting fruity IPA that showcases a lot of different hop tastes"
"Future outlook: Would be a great brew for a long session of heavy summer drinking. I won't think twice about getting/drinking this again."
"Pours a transparent orange color with bubbly white head with an aroma of hops, citrus notes and a touch of vanilla extract. Amazingly smooth taste with notes of fruit and vanilla amongst the fresh hop background and mildly dry finish. A great session beer for an afternoon any time of year. It is light on the stomach as well as versatile in its ability to accompany many various foods. Recommended as one of the best session beers around without sacrificing taste."
"D - I bought this beer to get a good taste of what hops taste like since I'm new to beer and have been hitting the porter and stouts pretty heavy. This beer delivers on the hops and bitterness while not being overpowerful. I could drink a few of these. I look forward to more of dogheads offerings and stretching my hop palate."
"This was my first DFH beer. My only dissapointment of this beer was the head. Poured in a snifter, perhaps my pour was not aggressive enough. Overall, a fantastic IPA. I'd like to do a side by side tasting of this with the 90 minute."
"6/4/5/2/10 (2.7/5)"
"As far as the taste, it starts as a smooth hop taste followed by a almost heavy grapefruit like citrus. Real heavy and thick feel in the mouth, not bad though. Iv never been a fan of IPA's but this one wasn't to bad. To me this isn't a beer I could drink at anytime, but never the less this wasn't a bad beer at all."
"Verdict: When compared to the rest of the Dogfish Head stable, 60 Minute is certainly one of the least extreme offerings. But that's the point, DFH mean for 60 Minute IPA to be a balanced, very drinkable, yet still exciting and unique everyday beer. A terrific example of the American India Pale Ale style, and of beer in general. After this, I'm dying to try the four-pack of 90 Minute and single bottle of 120 Minute in my cellar."
"NOTE: This beer had been in my garage for awhile (this one was bottled on June 10 of this year), so it's possible that the age had mellowed out the hops. If and when I try a newer bottle, I might update this review. I'm guessing age did have an effect...but this was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Poured into a tulip glass"
"fucking love this beer, bring it on... I will def have this more"
"I'm not huge on IPA's, but if I were going to purchase one, this would be right around the top of my purchase list. This is a good, solid, yet unoffensive IPA."
"I much prefer other standard IPAs like Stone and Southern Tier."
"This one is tasty and easy drinking, so it is a good choice when you are going to have more than one. An all-around solid beer."
"D: This is very tasty and, honestly, a bit refreshing. It's still a boldly hopped American IPA, but it isn't as aggressively bitter as some of its counterparts. It's still complex and delicious."
"Drinkablility- Oh yeah baby. This is one of my go to beers. Well done!"
"Orange-gold pour with a bubbly white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Hearty aroma of pine and citrus, with some malt. Taste is nearly the same, with more grapfruit than resin. Good balance of hops with malt, but a little too sweet for my taste. Still, its a solid IPA."
"A great IPA. Definitely worth trying out!"
"This is a beer that I've been drinking for a while and it's one of my go to IPA's. But, now that I'm actually sitting down to write about why I like it better than other IPA's I'm having a hard time putting it into words. I always have some difficulty reviewing IPA's because I'm not too familiar with how different types of hops taste. I think my liking it so much has something to do with how balanced it is."
"D- It is a very drinkable beer. It is slightly bitter without overpowering the taste buds and not to filling. It pairs well with spicey foods or just on it's own. It's a good intro to those new to I.P.A.'s or those looking for a every day beer with some flavor. Cheers!"
"This is certainly a very different IPA than everything else out there. It works well but the harsh carbonation hurts it a bit. Wouldn't be my first three choices for IPAs but if you haven't had it yet I would recommend trying it at least once."
"This was a nice simple IPA. I wold recommend this to someone trying to learn about beer. This is not a wimpy beer but a bit simple for a strong IPA drinker. For the style of beer it was an impressive beer. Great color and aroma and a nice bittery bit. A very nice nightly beer."
"Highly drinkable, and more balanced than I expected."
"A nice gold color with a white head. There is good lacing as well. The nose is a nice hop. The flavor is slight bitter not much but slight. It's an ok flavor but there is a touch of an aftertaste. Overall a decent beer, there are better examples out there now."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a thick foamy white head. Aroma is dominated by citrus and floral hops. Excellently well-balanced quaffable IPA with enormous hop flavor and a nice malty backbone. Bitter throughout with a nice sweet malty balance and dry finish."
"I could easily plow through a six pack if I don't control myself."
"Was drinkable for an IPA, but being as this is my least favorite style of beer, that would limit what I would drink. Still, this is my favorite IPA."
"drinks VERY easily. a bit high to be a session beer but i can see myself polishing off a few of these in a night. now to get on the hunt to find some more."
"Definately going to a ""go to"" IPA. It poured a nice bright copper with just enough foam to satisfy those head retention freaks out there. Good malt balance and so far no bitter hoppy after taste that usually lingers with most IPA's. I have actually this beer on several occasions but am just now getting around to reviewing it. Cheers!"
"not usually much for IPA's but was given one and I liked it enough to finish it and will likely at some point when I'm feeling hoppy will seek out the others - 75 90 and 120..."
"Drinkability: Fairly high, great with a light and fatty meal such as wings or fried fish. Will have again."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, tastes good, nice mouthfeel. Recommended as an IPA"
"had a single bottle of this, found it to be a very worth while ipa. nice pale yellow flavor slightly into light amber. nice frothy head that is thing but sticks around. smells of a great ipa, floral scents as well as the strong aroma of hops; classic smell one looks for when sniffing out an ipa. taste is great, nice mouthfeel light but smooth; not too bubbly. nice buttery coat at first, finish dry with a good amount hops, just enough not to make it too bitter. drinkability i found to be great with this brew. i could see myeslf ordering these at bar all night, great flavor but nothing to much that really leaves too much of a trace on the palate. the alcohol is a bit high but drinking them all night certainly will leave someone having a good night; certainly doable."
"Enjoy."
"This is a very drinkable IPA, goes down so well. Good session brew, I think I'll have another."
"Wish this was available in St. Louis. Its a nice beer."
"Overall - Not bad. Nothing remarkable, but not bad. I look forward to their other IPAs, some time later."
"D - Nicely drinkable IPA, and a classic offierun from DFH."
"D - I could have these everyday. But it is dinner beer. It need something to balance the bitter."
"Overall, I have to say this has to be my favorite IPA."
"Overall this one never disappoints. Give it a shot if you haven't already."
"Thanks to NASH for the bottle!"
"One of the most drinkable IPA's I've enjoyed. Left me wanting more."
"It is a very floral and spicy beer. It is not simply overloaded with hops, but it does have quite a bit of hop presence to say the least. The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish. It starts crisp, and I would like it to stay that way, but the carbonation dies as soon as it hits your tongue. This is one I could have a few of."
"Very good IPA - its a amber blonde color with a nice head and nice lacing. There is something sharp in the smell that I don't like -- but its not in the taste - its tastes great. Mouthfeel isn't as full as I'd like - its a little thin, but good nonetheless. Easy and enjoyable drinker that has a lot of flavor. I like the Stone IPA the most, but this is quite good."
"Overall, a simple treat. This is not the ""wow"" beer that will blow you away. Look to the 90, 120, or something else if that's what you're after. But, if you're feeling like I was tonight, get a beer full of flavor, with minimal ABV that you can drink steady. I'm going to go enjoy another 60 minute IPA right now!"
"Very enjoyable and super easy to drink."
"D- I could drink this everyday...great example of an ipa"
"This is a very drinkable IPA, it is avaliable just about everywhere, pick it up, and enjoy!"
"To be perfectly honest, i could drink these like I use to pound Molson Canadian's."
"I really like where this beer is going. I have had the 120 minute and it was even better, but I have not formally reviewed it. This beer has a nice strong hop hit, but the hops are not the only flavor in the beer. There is a very good malt representation here, and it is nice."
"Drinkability: High. This is a nicely-priced, well-made IPA which is becoming available just about everywhere. Whether from the bottle or the tap, give DFH 60 minute a run. It won't disappoint."
"Recently revisited this Ale, after a fairly long layoff. Pours ok, the nose is a chocolate stout, bitter coffee, decent head. A very strange nose. the first hit on the taste buds is coffee, ending bitter like an IPA should. Half way thru the head is completely gone, no lacing at all, it looks like it's been sitting overnight, and went stale. After living off other IPA's , definitely a dissappointing brew. Advertised as a cask ale. I'll pass on this one in the future, the heavy coffee influence is definitely a turn off."
"The provincially-run LCBO has broadened its horizons lately and this is one more good American import that's finally easier to come by. Poured a shade or two lighter than bronze, clear with orange hilights after it settled into the glass, short lived off-white head. A ring remained and a bit of lacing, carbonation was fleeting. Swirling the ale brings back a thin, active surface film as well as bringing out a sharp citrus smell, almost lemon lime, big hoppy aroma. The hops are very apparent again in the mouth with a lively sharpness and mouthfeel and a dry, bitter finish. While I really like the hop presence, there's a dryness that takes away from the overall effect, not as well rounded as another recent import into these parts. But overall, do partake and enjoy, this is a huge world of difference from what passes for an IPA in Ontario. Thanks to the good folks in Delaware for taking the trouble to export your beer to these parts."
"D: A great beer to drink if you love IPA and are looking for a beer that you can drink in sessions. It's VERY easy to drink 4 of these in one session!"
"Goes down pretty smooth. The hops are present, but not overwhelming. Crisp feel in the mouth but a nice weight too. I could see having a few of these, I suppose, but I probably won't be racing out to the store to pick up a sixer."
"One of my favorite IPAs. Creamy, balanced, eminently drinkable, hops are not overwhelming and there are no picky or biting qualities; even the appearance of this beer is impressive. Bet this would be exquisite with bleu cheese..."
"a true golden color, completely transparant. there is one finger of head that settles down quickly. it smells bready and thick, but still rather mild. some piney hops and a sweet maltiness catch the nose too. it is smooth and bubbly, light hops, malty, and sweet. it finishes with a certain thickness to it."
"Tried a lot of other Dogfish Head's stuff, including the 90 minute IPA, but never this original one. A very bubbly orange color in the glass with a nice hoppy aroma. Taste is pretty good, ncie and hoppy but not overdone at all. Seems a little boring to me, which is surprising from DFH. Might crack into the top 5 IPA's I've had but it's close... It's a great beer but I was expecting better to be honest."
"D - Great IPA... Easy drinking... It's hoppy, but far from overdone... Solid, sip after sip... It should be noted that this brew also provides an incredibly solid value proposition..."
"D. This is a really good IPA. I could session this, alongside Stone and TwoHearted."
"This is a reference beer. One which others of the style will be judged against whether they want to or not. Drink up friends.. there's plenty to enjoy here."
"Intense, but flavorful beer that is way too easy to enjoy. Crisp and refreshing, a great beer to enjoy with friends"
"D: Very drinkable beer, especially for the hop heads out there."
"O- Very drinkable. One of my favorite IPA's and beers in general."
"Pours a pretty clear, vibrant oaky, amber with bright, clear highlights. Head puffs up to a creamy crown before surrendering to a small layer of foam. Smell is wonderful. Spicy, piney hops layered over mint, lemon zest, white pepper, fresh rosemerry, all barely balanced by a bready malt character. Taste is hops. Again, spicy, piney, peppery, layers of citrus, floral hops. Trying to pull in the hop reigns, some bready, crystal malt ties things together. Somewhat one deminsional in the hop / malt balance, but some wonderful hop flavors layers on each other. Mouthfeel is crisp and finishes dry. Wonderful IPA."
"D- This is a great beer with a great mouthfeel. It's not available in MN, but we know where to get it in WI and will continue to do so."
"d. Not bad! Very refreshing, light and crisp for a medium body IPA. Definitely not overly bitter hopping, there's an interesting balance of light citrus hop and light malts. Easy drinking, it's a good beer. The balance almost reminds of a strong pale, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I can easily drink a few at a time."
"D: The balance of flavor makes 60 Minute a readily drinkable IPA. I could definitely go with this as a session beer because it drinks more like a bigger pale ale than American hop-bomb IPA."
"An average mouthfeel and a very delecteble beer leaving me wanting more."
"D- a nice beer to introduce non craft beer drinkers to. very easy to have a couple of, and readily available."
"This is hands down one of my favorite beers! Poured from a 12oz bottle, Bottled on 09-02-08. just 3 weeks old. Aggresive pour into DFH tumbler produces a nice fluffy 1 inch head which disappears quickly but leaves behind some quality lacing on the glass. Tarnished brass /orangish color with a very pleasant nose. Grapefruit, pine & a touch ofcaramel/bready sweetness. Taste is sensational, Great balance of citrus fruits with an aggresive hoppiness which cleanses the palate dry and leaves a nice mouthwatering hoppy bitterness which has you craving for the next sip. Drinkable is sensational for an IPA, I could easily drink a few of these in a row. All around a top notch beer from DFH. Highly recommended!!"
" Drinkability is ideal. Get a case or two and consider this the staple of a well stocked fridge."
"Still one of the better IPA's east of the Mississippi."
"Overall and outstanding IPA. Look forward to seeing what else this ""new-Age"" brewery has to offer. If its anything like the 60 minute im pretty sure ill be hooked!"
"D: This is one of those beers you can sit down and drink all night long. It never gets boring even throughout a lengthy session. One of DFHs most approachable beers, and also one of the better IPAs on the market today. Love it!"
"After drinking an Unearthly last night, this seems more subdued than I remember. But if I pull some of these out in the upcoming malty beer season, I'll get my hop fix. Not a hard beer to drink a few of. Will buy again."
"Light amber pour with a generous white head of microbubbles. The head fades a little, but laces well. The aroma is excedingly fresh and leafy, like running through a forest and into a stand of pine trees. The flavour also burst with a leafy freshness, edged by notes of pine and grapefruit, and set against a caramel malt body. Medium-light mouthfeel makes this eminently drinkable, and a very solid IPA."
"Drinkability - I've sessioned this beer on numerous occasions and while it can get a little boozy, it's still a pleasure on the second or third pint. It's neither boring nor overwhelming -- perfect when you want more than one."
"nom nom nom"
"I have a problem with the whole ""continually hoppy"" thing. I feel like a beer should develop and be layered. I like nice hops that give way to nice malt or vice-versa. In this case, the hops dominate all the way through."
"Very good IPA. It is not as overwhelming as some, a more balanced refreshing taste than the more ""hop you to death"" philosophies other IPAs can espouse. Dark orange with a fruity hoppy taste and smell. Very clean and balanced. Could drink several of these."
"D: Decent, not the best IPA I've had, but one of the better ones I've tried. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of IPA's but this one is pleasant enough. I'd drink it again."
"A good IPA, not great, surpassed by plenty of others. Nonetheless, this is good and worth trying."
"Carbonation is perfect, body is fairly light (low end of the medium scale) and leaves a great taste in your mouth. With the relatively low alcohol content this beer is very easy to drink and for those with higher tolerances could even be considered sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable beer. One of my favorites for the summer."
"v: oz3 al3 3.725"
"Light bodied entry on the palate, candied malt sweetness up front, and the hops balance out nicely towards the end. Could easily be confused with a mere pale ale. Not very adventurous for an IPA. Perhaps that's why the 90 & 120 are on the shelf."
"Pair with- BBQ + other ""sweet"" spices"
"M/D - Medium bodied with a somewhat buttery feel later in the drink. Doesnt finish as strong as I would like, but still a very drinkable IPA."
"I picked up a sixer. Pours a clear, almost golden color into my pint glass. Slight carbonation and moderate head. Strong hop and pine aroma, with some citrus as well (grapefruit?). Smells like a good IPA should smell. The taste is much of the same...hoppy and fruity, but well balanced. Some bitterness finishes off the taste. Mouthfeel is light bodied and a little sticky. Goes down very well. One of my favorite IPA's and each time I drink it I am reminded why. It'll go well with the NFL game tonight."
"Every now and then, beer seems like old hat. Every beer seems the same and the excitement of trying a new beer is gone....then something as brilliant as 60 minute IPA comes along and reminds you that beer can be exciting and new. This was my first Dogfish Head brew, and I will have to try the other IPAs, as I've heard they are better. The dour mood I was in before this beer dissipated quickly, leaving just a smile on my face and joy in my heart. I still love beer and this brew reminded me of that."
"Pretty good drinkability, could see drinking this a lot. Something to fall back on in a bar that happens to have it on tap but nothing else really great, for sure."
"D: very drinkable. quaffable, even. always a favorite to revisit"
"To sum up, I expected more given the reviews. I urge everyone who can get it to try the Sweetwater IPA... it's a better-balanced IPA IMO, and I sure like being able to support my local brewer and still feel I'm getting a superior product!"
"Pours a dark golden haze, smell is bright and enthusiastically citrusy. Taste is also citrusy, quite flowery and pleasant. Mouthfeel is thick and balanced, gives a refreshing flavor to the palate. Drinkability is high even given the high ABV%. I can definitely see this being a repeat beer!"
"D- It being unbalanced would make it hard for me to enjoy more than one. I'm hoping that maybe I got a bad bottle. I'll have to try it again."
"Enjoyed this from bottle and tap with consistant notes. Great hop funk, flavors of the it's close hop cousin ;) that is sometimes associated with hopped beers. Pretty easy to drink and the alc is not noticable. Below the 90 in quality for me but enjoyable. Hope this makes it out west."
"I like this beer on a hot day. It has a lot of hops, and a clear golden, coppery color. The head is a bit weak. There is some citris in the nose and taste but it doesn't have quite as much complexity or fruit as some of the IPA's I like, but It's a good beer."
"Re-rate 4/28/08. Hmmm... not quite as good as I once thought. Color is clear copper, with a relatively thick off-white head. Some foamy lace forms on the side of the glass. Aroma is hops and some sweet fruits, most notably apricots but it's really toned down. The flavor is sweet citrus fruits and grapefruit hops. Pretty refreshing but doesn't have a strong hop profile for an IPA. A good everyday type of beer but it's a little too expensive for that."
"D: Could go for a few of these on a hot summer day, no doubt."
"D: Very nice session IPA. Not as bitter as many examples of the style, but I don't have problems with that."
"Great gold with orange highlights color. Crystal clear. Thick cream colored head eventually settles into a cap that showed great retention throughout the sample. Big floral and pine hop aroma with fruity hints. Medium carbonation yet smooth character and a creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of smooth malt up front, spices, citrus, and then hops, hops, hops. Well balanced Fantastic example of an IPA and very drinkable. Would be great as a counterpoint to spicy Indian food!"
"D: Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Final thoughts - The constant hopping approach has clearly offered a more complex bitterness sensation, but has taken away from the floral aroma of most IPAs. I'm a little late on the boat with Dogfish Head, but I am loving their offerings. I will certainly get this on tap whenever I can."
"mouthfeel is crisp, nicely carbonated, bitter, a great ipa with harsh hopping, very enjoyable."
"Dogfish Head usually impresses, but not tonight. While the 90 and 120 pack a nice punch, the 60 is lacking the unique and powerful flavor that DH imbues in most of their beers."
"Like a lot of similar, strong-tasting American IPAs this isn't for everyone and might be too much in beer. But for lovers of unique and pleasant IPAs this is a must try."
"Taste was big, herbal hops up front, with some grainier, malty notes hitting as the drink warms. Finish is somewhat bitter and rather dry, due in large part to the hops. The aftertaste mellows out nicely to a semi-dry bitter-sweetness."
"I first sampled this beer last night. It was drank from a pint glass with roughly a 1 1/2 inch head. It had a very earthy smell, with an excellent mouthfeel. It was a medium-dark amber color. Taste, obviously very hoppy, but not overwhelming. I am will certainly purchase this brew again."
"This is a very good example of an American IPA. It pours a very rich amber to almost light copper colour with a minimal head. I would suspect the lack of head came in part with the ""new"" tap system and maybe the glass wasn't totally clean. `Given my experience with IPA's I'll chalk it up to the pour and the glass. The smell is very rich and earthy hops, citrus and some pine. A slight hint of yeast hits the back of the nose and the malts are present. Flavor is very smooth starting with rich hoppy pine. The hops linger on the back of the mouth. Malts balance very well. The overall finish is slightly dry but not over powering. Flavor is full bodied and transitions well. In the mouth slight oilly residue is present but overall not intense. A very well balanced beer. At 6% abv it is ideal to have 2 pints."
"Bottom line: I wanted to compare these because of the difference in bottling and keg dates. I thought the bottle date would be superior to my tap date. WRONG! There is a month and half difference between bottle and keg dates and keg is far away the better tasting of the two."
"Drinkability is very good. This IPA has a ton of taste, but not a killer hop taste that wears on the tongue. I know from experience. The waitress had just dropped one of these off when I bit into the HOTTEST pepper I have ever tasted. I finished the 60 minute in front of me AND three others within 5 minutes because of the burn. I would like to give a bit of props to the waitress at Fire in Cleveland, OH for keeping them coming and saving my tongue."
"Very drinkable, but not what I remember from this beer. More malty than I thought."
"This was pretty good for the style. The hop bitterness made the drinkability low for me. It was tasty especially with the orange citrus background but it's nothing I'd really crave often. Refreshing in the end."
"D: very drinkable, definitely a staple type beer. and a good intro to the style."
"D: One of the most drinkable IPAs I've ever had."
"D- though the beer has its share of flavor, its not over bearing and very easy to drink. Though I am typically a bigger fan of double IPA's, this is one of the most enjoyable IPA's I've had in my short lived beer drinking history. a good beer plain and simple."
"Poured a dark, golden yellow with a thick off-white head that stayed. Turned into a nice laciness. The aroma was very good, easy on the nose even for an IPA. A lot of hops, but not overpowering. Well balanced hoppy flavor, a tad bit of bitterness but smooth and refreshing. Mouthfeel was good, light on the palate but had good texture. Drinkability is excellent, a good session beer. An excellent IPA."
"This is my favorite beer of all time. It has a rich deep copper color, nice thick head. The smell...heaven. It smells like resiny hops and to me coffee hints on a nice rich roast. First taste was amazing. Malty coffee, big hops but not too bitter. rich hop flavor is amazing. the only thing better than this beer, is to roll hops around in your mouth. Mouthfeel is heavy, but sooo drinkable. great effort once again dogfish head."
"Poured a bright orange color with a nice inch worth of foam that leaves some light lacing down the glass. Delightful orange/citrus aroma mixed with a little pine-forest. Interesting! Citrus flavors abound from the hops, balanced out by a nice malt sweetness. Bitterness is not overly present, but that's a good thing. Quite different than many other IPAs I've tried. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I could definitely put a few of these back in one sitting. Thanks to BA Greggy for this brew!"
"The Dogfish Head sixty minute India Pale ale is my favorite beer of all time. Its perfect for me in every way. I love the Label, the smell, the hop's. It is top notch for any IPA fans, if you havent tried it yet, please do so. It pours much like any beer, but anyone who loves to stick there nose in the pint glass before they drink will fall in love with the 60 minute IPA, as full flavored as IPA's are, I could drink this all night. Great job Dogfish head team."
"Finally got around to trying this bad boy - big mistake. Waiting that long that is. Beautiful dark gold color & big foamy a$$ head. Aroma is off the chart full of citrus, piny, resiny hop yumminess. Taste - wow, not too bitter but just packed with hop flavor. Drinkability? I can't wait to get some more. This thing totally rocks. I couldn't imagine how good a fresh one on tap would be. Do they sell this by the case???"
"D - Uber high. I could pair this with dozens of foods. Not a palate wrecker."
"Lighter than your standard IPA in color, its an aubern with yellow highlights and a nice frothy off white head that left some lace and stuck around decently. Nice mix of piney and citrus hops in the nose with a floral note as well, all backed by the smell of sweet malts. The taste is bitter pine and slightly sour citrus but both in a good way. Sweet malted backbone keeps it ballanced. Mouth feel is medium but does have some nice hop oil that helps the flavor stick on the finish. If DFH was trying to make a very drinkable IPA then they deffinately succeeded."
"D-Real tasty, easy to drink. Abv is just right for knocking back a few. Whats not to like?"
"M&D= Clean and crisp it cleanses the palate. Perfect for a session. At 6% abv, it won't knock your socks off but you can't knock back as many as you could if you were drinking a 'Lite' beer. Available almost anywhere, it's no wonder it's their #1 seller."
"Almost too easy to drink. Truly a great beer."
"On tap at J.P. Bullfeathers. Amber with small creamy head. Smell of pine, grass and malts. Smooth mouthfeel with sweet caramel malts and some orange peel. I get more floral hops as the beer warms up. Finishes dry amd bitter with the caramel sweetness disappearing at the end. This is like the East Coast version of Stone IPA."
"This is a beer which lends itself to easy drinkability. One of the best session beers I've ever had. Wish I could get this one here in Vegas."
"D: After a while this beer seems to take on an earthier woody kind of character, really hop forward IPA and does not dissapoint, wish it looked just a bit prettier but really we are talking about how the beer tastes so it does not matter that much. This beer is fantastic, I don't know why I'm trying not to like it. Highly drinkable and pairs excellently with a supreme pizza."
"The flavor is sweet caramel malt with pine, a bit of grapefruit (but more pine), and a nice sweeter citrus after-taste. Very pleasant. I could easy drink fifteen or twenty of these at a sitting (a long sitting). Nice lively mouthfeel, and very drinkable."
"D: This beer is a totally different monster than the 90. Both are great but this one has more of a hops profile where the 90 has more malt. Depends on what you are after. Still a great beer and easily drinkable."
"Went down pretty smooth with a decent aftertaste. The mouthfeel was alright. I would probably try this when again some day but I think Ill try the 90 minute or the 120 minute first."
"A very well crafted, well balanced IPA. Some IPAs are one-and-done for me -- not this one. I can easily put a few away. Very easy drinking here."
"I could drink this one all night long! Great session beer."
"Thanks to Dogfish Head for this one!"
"Pours a dark amber in color. Forms a nice inch high head on the pour and leaves some nice sticky lacing. Smell is all hops. Mostly of the piney variety, but some citrus there as well. Taste is more of the piney and it dominates the flavor. Pretty full on the mouthfeel as well. Good beer, but needs a little more of the ""juicy"" hops."
"Tonights pint of this beer will most likely be my last. I have had good pints of it before, but seriously, what happened to the minty/piney hop character of DFHs 60 minute IPA? Any trace was sadly gone. It was gone! Hence the above ratings. I have nothing more to say."
"Burp*"
"It pours a clear golden with a light head and decent lacing. It has a clean citrusy smell. The flavor is robust, grainy and floral, with an aggressive though not unpleasant mouthfeel that lets you know you've got a good beer in your mouth. This is a highly drinkable, if not exceptionally distinctive, IPA."
"Very, very drinkable which is certainly helped by the ABV being at a reasonable level. Excellent stuff."
"D - This is where this brew shines the brightest. For an IPA, and it is definitely that, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is significantly more drinkable than any other IPA I have had. Drinking the 60 Minute IPA all night long would not be a test of will power but a evening of satisfaction."
"After taking some initial tasting notes, I finished the beer while eating some spicy papadums. The beer holds up nicely to the spice."
"absolutely the most drinkable IPA I have ever experienced. If on;y this was available here in springfield. I guess I have more of an excuse to go back to texas. This would definitely be in my fridge all the time if available."
"The 6-0 is a solid IPA, but I expect the niner to be the one that really impresses me."
"Featuring outstanding drinkability borne of an excellent flavor profile and just-right carbonation, this beer is a superb and wonderfully hoppy example of my favorite style."
"T-I've only had the DFH 90 and 60 IPA's but i have to say that this brewery has got it right so far good piny/citrus flavor that leaves a nice bitterness in the back of your mouth from drink to drink. Medium body and incredibly drinkable beer this would be one i reached for time and time again if it was available in my area. Exceptionally Balanced"
"I like the hops and while it was sweet it was not too sweet. A good brew with good ABV."
"D- An easy drinker, reasonably moderate ABV with a full flavour. An excellent beer, and while I might tend to lean towards the 90 minute a little more, I'd take this any day."
"On tap at Union Brew House. Had this beer too many times to remember, but today I had one of the first pulls off the keg and it seemed ""different"". First thing- the smell- huge aromas of hops- piney and citrus finishing. Nice appearance, too- great fluffy head on a dark orange body. Taste is crisp and hopy. flavors include orangey hops, oily almost. Decent malt backbone to finish as well, but this is a hopheads IPA. Have to have another!"
"As always, consistently refreshing and one of my consistent goto beers for grilling on a nice day or even good for winter dinners. So smooth."
"Never going to be my favorite IPA, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a 6-pack when I'm unsure of what to drink."
"D- Great brew, easy to down like I previously mentioned."
"Overall: One of the refrigerator standbys, always a pleasure to see a 60 minute."
"D: I could definitely drink one of these with a good burger, and have another right after. Due to the richness, (and the alcohol content) I probably wouldn't want to drink too much, though."
"D - So easy to drink. It's very flavorful yet smooth and refreshing."
"This beer is very much my summertime beer of choice. If only it was more readily available in Mn, as I purchased this from Chicone's in Hudson."
"On tap for $5.75 at Yardhouse, this had better be good. In fact, it had better be outstanding for that price. Unfortunately, it's not. Color is a medium yellow with zero head, smells faintly of citrus. Tastes mildly of citrus, but just not a whole lot of flavor going on. The best I can say is that a weak-ass beer like this goes down easily when it's 110­° outside, which it is today. But overall, this beer is a huge disappointment after hearing all the hype about Dogfish. One of the weakest IPAs I've ever had. What the fuck?"
"The nose on the beer is mostly malts, but it has a hint of hops. The taste of this beer is actually quite different. There are not floral hops, it has a lot of almost roasty malts, but then hits you at the end with the bitterness. It's almost a bridge IPA, meaning it'd be a beer you'd give to a person to ween them onto hops. I personally would want more hop character, but this is obviously going for something different than most IPAs, which isn't so bad. It just isn't my thing. When I drink an IPA, I want the hops to fucking hit me in the face. The mouthfeel is quite standard with a bit of creaminess and a bit of carbonation. The drinkablility in this beer is pretty standard (for me)."
"I really love this beer. It's not as bold as the 90 Min and it's not as ridiculous as the 120 Min, but I think it's more balanced and better for it."
"A good starter IPA for someone new to trying the style and stepping up their appreciation of hops - not overpowering like some of the more extreme IPA/DIPAs that are on the market now. Could drink these all night."
"Drinkability: I think this a good starter for those trying to get into the style. Highly balanced and flavorful enough for the beginner and the hophead. One of the classics that doesn't seem to have lost anything in the years."
"D: No problem."
"M/D: Overall, this is a very good beer. Smooth, medium body and just a straight forward IPA. This is one that I will definitely be drinking more of."
"Pours a light copper/straw color with good carbonation that feeds a fine layer of foam. Smells of biscuity malts backed by a fair amount of hops. Smells like earthy UK hops, really well done. Seems light and sessionable until it is swallowed and the hops pour in. Its like an entirely different beer, pine comes out of nowhere. An amazing multi-dimensional beer. aftertaste is juicey and well lived. Taste becomes more biscuity/toasted/nutty as it warms. Fantastic."
"D - compared to the huge ipa's anymore this could easily be considered a session beer and for good reason. Perfect on a hot day."
"D. 60Min. is a good represention of it's style.A well balanced beer and very refreshing.All the right flavors that you would expect and easy too drink."
"great IPA with wonderful color, head, and aroma. this is how it should be done. the 60 minute ipa is a great beer that wasn't made to blow you out of the water like a lot of double and imperial ipas, and has a ton of malt taste and hop bitterness that are perfectly balanced. i almost felt like the color of the beer should have been darker for how full bodied this beer is. paired well with the steak i grilled up for dinner when i tried it. would definitely keep a case of this on reserve at all times."
"This is always in my fridge, and will be for a long time."
""
"This was a very good IPA. Served chilled in a pint glass. Poured a fine goldish color with a decent head and a thick white wall of lacing. Smells of citrus and floral hops with a bit of pine. Tastes not to overpowering as in an oily mouthfeel but nice floral hops and tart citrus notes. The fresh, on-tap quality gave it a smooth freshing taste and brought out a lot more flavor. Very quaffable."
"D: A little to out of balance for me to drink a bunch of these by itself but something that pairs well with food."
"Served in my Harpoon IPA glass. Poured a translucent orange-gold. Three-quarter inch off-white head with copious amounts of bubbles in solution rising from the bottom of the glass. Some webs of white lacing present during the tasting. Scent of hops and citrus fruit. Taste consistent with nose with a touch of grassiness also revealed. Flavors are well-balanced and taste is consistent throughout, with hops flavoring gradually peaking towards the end. Finish starts out slightly sweet, reveals a hint of grapefruit, then leaves a mild lingering astringency at the very end. Lively mouthfeel falls somewhere between thin- and medium-bodied, but very much style appropriate. Not too much carbonation burn. Very drinkable and crisp brew. I am not an IPA fan by any means, but I can see why this is one of DFH's flagship brews."
"Was somewhat thin for an IPA. Had a nice flavor but lacks depth. Very cloudy appearance. Average head. IPA is my favorite style of American beer and this was a little disappointing.Taste was good, but appearance could be improved. I think this beer is overated."
"A hop-packed experience here, to be sure."
"Taste: Citrusy up front with a gigantic bitter finish of pine. There is a doughy malt in the middle, but the focus on this is on the hops all the way. This is, in my opinion, more hoppy than the 90 minute, and less balanced, though it doesn't need to be. Te hops are allowed to shine without being too overpowering."
"D: Although continually hopped, a moderate bitterness lends itself to remarkable drinkability. This is one tasty India Pale Ale. Two dorsal fins up!"
"Overall - quite a good IPA for the beginner IPA drinker. The hop head would be satisfied although it does not pack as much flavor as the Hopdevil. Very good with a dinner or a snack."
"Smell from the bottle is a nice hop aroma. Pours very cleanly into a pint glass, leaving a nice bit of head at the top and a nice bronze hue. Out of the glass there is a nice hop taste that rolls through your mouth. Very good flavor and easy drinkability. This is your better than average IPA!"
"This is a really good beer, to put it simply."
"I ordered the 60 Minute IPA on tap at Fat Bobs Smokehouse in Buffalo NY. It has a nice golden color with orange highlights and a small white head that makes great lace on the glass. The aroma is full of piney hops with some floral and citrus notes as well. Like the aroma the flavor is strait up hops over a lightly toasted malt base. It has a medium bodied palate with a slightly oily texture. The bitterness of the hops lingers long into the finish making this a grate beer for hop lovers."
"I am huge fan of Dogfish Head's 90 minute IPA, and even the bottled 60 minute was good, but if you want to try this one, get it at a place that has it on tap!"
"A very drinkable IPA; bitter and loaded enough to please hopheads with enough sweet malt to provide seekers of balance. Excellent everyday IPA."
"D - This beer is very refreshing and tastes so good!"
"A very well balanced IPA."
"Poured a golden orange with a fingers worth of head into an oversized wine glass. Solid hoppy aroma that was what you would expect. Extremely drinkable beer that had a even hoppyness throughout, with slightly more sweetness to it than other IPAs. This is my go to beer when I want a tasty drinkable IPA."
"Poured into an American pint glass, it appears an attractive cloudy orange-amber, with two fingers of bubbly head, which disappears fairly quickly, leaving very little lacing on the glass. The nose is predominantly bready malt, with a pine hop aroma that was quite faint, most likely due to this bottle's age. The flavour allows more of a pine/citrus hop bitterness to come into play, balancing with the malt, which takes a step back. This beer has a very nice full body, and a subtle amount of carbonation. There is no noticeable warming from the slightly increased ABV, making it a very agreeable quaffer."
"This is great. I could drink this beer all day."
"sixer from Peace Street, bottled 3/31/08"
"D- This was my initial order of the evening as its a good pseudo-session beer (and it was still on my list) Would have liked to have had a full pint. At least its easiy getable in bottles around here."
"Pours an attractive amber/orange color that begs to be drank. Nice white head that lingers a while. Aroma is very pleasant blend of citrus and floral aromas. Taste is very well balanced between the malt and hops. Nice citrus flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth. This is a very tasty IPA. Good Stuff."
"Pours out a burnt orange color with a very nice thick, fluffy, white head that leaves tons of lace. The beer's aroma is heavily of hops with a lot of sweet fruitiness appearing as well. The taste is typical of Dogfish head (which is a great thing!)...they tend to make their beers sweeter and fruitier than the other beers of the given style. And that goes for the 60 Minute as well. It has hops and pine flavors up front but a sugary sweetness come through right away. Leaves your mouth a bit dry and wanting more. Great beer."
"overall, not what i remember. could be the keg, maybe the recipe is more english hops or lower alpha than before.. dunno. still a totally delicious beer, rather english character. highly recommended."
"Overall this is a good American IPA and a great go-to beer, though at $10 a six-pack I find it a little too expensive for everyday drinking. Instead, I would suggest Full Sail IPA."
"Quite drinkable in the long run. It can really be a session type ale, but coming in at 6% it might not be a good idea to imbibe on a few of these."
"Initial flavor is hops, but not overpoweringly so, as the sweet malt quickly follows to create a solid balance. Spicy bitter hops finish lingers pleasantly on the palate. Smooth mouthfeel makes for a very enjoyable beverage."
"Drinkability: I don't care it's over 5.5% ABV; this is a session IPA. Crisp and clean, inviting you back for gulp after gulp. Beautiful."
"An excellently crafted hop flavor. Rich and flavorful, though in no way overly bitter. No overwhelming aftertaste either. Floral and Earthy, with hints of citrus. Finish is dry and packs a piney bite."
"D - Very nicely done, a definite must try for everyone, even those who aren't fans of hoppy brews, as this IPA is very well balanced. An easy drinker and a tasty one at that."
"Very easy to drink and quite refreshing for an IPA. I will have to try this one right next to the 90 min and decide which one I like better."
"D: Very nice beer. The hops are there but not dominating but enough to satisfy the hopheads while not being enough to discourage the average beer drinker."
"Overall: This is a great session brew. I actually like the 90 minute better even to session, but that is not to slight this beer at all. It is a great drinking IPA that will match most out there in taste and drink ability. DFH makes wonderful brews and this is no exception. Most brewers would be happy to hang their hat on this one, yet DFH makes many other more exotic and limit pushing brews."
"D: An easy drinker, reasonably moderate ABV with a full flavour. An excellent beer, and while I might tend to lean towards the 90 minute a little more, I'd take this any day."
"This is one of my new favorite beers. It poured a butterscotch color with a frothy, thick head that laces beautifully. Its nose was woodsy to me with notes of malt and citrus. Its taste had the signature bitterness of an IPA, but was balanced very well with the beer's citrus and spice notes. Mouthfeel was great, highlighting a perfect amount of carbonation and dry taste up front, finishing with bitey toasty notes. I highly recommend this beer, and will definitely buy it again."
"D: Very Very good! This is my new ""go-to"" beer after a long hot day working outside!"
"Solid Effort."
"M&D: This is so far one of the smoothest, creamiest IPAs I have ever had. The carbonation is fine but plentiful which contributes to a lightness on the tongue. However there is a fantastic creamy texture that arises in the mouth that just makes this slide down so smooth! Love it! Would drink this anytime and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fresh hops."
"pours a light amber with a small off white head with a moderate lace retention. fruity and strong pine and citrus nose. slightly sweet biscuit malt, citrus, piney hop oil aftertaste. mouthfeel is light, carbonation ok. nice tasting but a session beer."
"Recommended!"
"This was another beer that I tried at a trade show. It had a nice deep tan color and a pleasant aroma. A nice head formed on the beer and it lasted through my drinking of it. It had a bit of a strong taste but not overpowering. It didn't have a pronounced hops/wheat/barley flavor, just a nice combination of them all. I do prefer the brewery's 90 minute IPA more so, but this pulled a close second."
"Well balanced, overall, but the 90 Minute IPA has a surprisingly surperior drinkability over this one."
"There is a real danger of this becoming my everyday beer, displacing homeboy Sweetwater 420. I'll have to try Sweetwater's IPA for comparison."
"Poured a light copper and seemed pretty bubbly. The hop smells was definitely apparent but not overly so. The taste was very, very great. It went down smooth, ended very hoppy, and had no bite. It was a very drinkable beer. I'd have to say that this and Bell's Two-Hearted are my two favorite IPAs. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D: Very good and damn sessionable. This is a reliable classic"
"Pours a clear orange/amber with good fluffy white head. Smell is of spicy hops. Taste follows with good spice hop flavors and some citrus. OK flavor but lacking in bitterness. Very smooth mouthfeel, a little thicker and maltier than I expected with such a marketing emphasis on the hops. Mostly good spice in here with the malts. Very Very drinkable IPA. A mediocre beer, I would like a little more bitterness though. Defenitely a future go to for a session beer when I am at a gas station in nowhere, AK."
"Drinkability- Very tasty beer, could be enjoyed back to back."
"Edit: did the person below me say ""Barilla spaghetti sauce jar"""
"D: Very nice guzzler-face. yes!!!"
"D: A spicy caramel sweetness and the huge citrusy/pine hopping is made easy due to the continous intervals used during the boil that makes this a well rounded and seemless transition of flavor from start to finish. Nice zesty hop zing."
"Both were approximately the same gold/amber color. The 60 smelled of floral hops. Upon taking a sip I found it to be a well-balanced standard IPA with a good dose of hop bitterness, but the flavor of hops really comes through well in the taste as well. There's a little citrus or grapefruit in there too. The 60 min IPA tastes a lot like the 90, just, less so. It's a really well balanced and a delicious beer overall."
"D - Overall a decent beer. I'm not widely experienced in IPAs and found this one to be a bit less bitter than others I've tried, which makes for an easy drink. The aftertaste lingers a bit too long for me though."
"Anyway between 60, 90 and 120 minute ipas, the 90 stands out as my favorite as it is more intense and flavorful then the 60 minute ipa, but the 120 minute ipa is almost too intense for everyday."
"Very drinkable. Excellent session beer. I could have several of these in a sitting."
"A god mouthfeel. This is a good IPA. Another quality beverage from DogFish Head."
"The color is a golden copper and very consistent between bottle and tap, spot on for traditional style. A whipped creamy white head forms after pouring and chases the beer down to the bottom of the glass. Truly a sign of a world class beer. A beautiful waltz occurs between the rich malt and the hops. Spicy citrus, earthy, and conifer hop elements all exist here. The finish leaves the palate clean, dry, and crying out for another taste."
"Drinkability = Pleasantly surprised at first. I'm not a big IPA fan, but found this to be nicely put together and refreshing. My main complaint is that, as the beer warmed up a little bit, an alcohol sort of sweetness became more noticeable and got in the way for my taste (their Raison d'Etre has a very similar taste/smell)."
"M- Nice, a bit thin, but hell this IS the definition of a session beer"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"One of Dogfish Head's best brews. Poured in a pint glass. The Beer is a pale golden color, with an aroma of piney hops. The mouthfeel is supurb and it finishes with a tangy bitterness. Just as good as the 90 min IPA, an excellent choice for the changing of the seasons."
"This poured a dark, clear amber with a descent head. It smelled of powerful hops. The flavor had a little yeast, no malt, and tons of hops up front and in the finish. One of the more bitter IPAs I've had recently, but it also had some other characteristics I couldn't quite place. Maybe a hint of orange? The texture was descent, and despite the bitterness it wasn't too difficult to drink. Overall very enjoyable."
"I could down a 6 of these real quick if not for the price.To me this is the best dogfish beer they make,all the rest can get in line. Obviosly a classic to have on hand during the summer when you have a quinching for grapefruit! Grab one of these to sample and you will not be disapointed."
"m: medium bodied beer with little carbonation noticeable in the mouth"
"Drinkability is high due to great flavors and only 6% ABV."
"poured a deep gold from a 12oz bottle in to my rogue dead guy ale pint glass :) (my fav pint glass) smell is citrus and floral. it smells really nice. taste is right up my alley. very hoppy, the hop structure is a lot different than any other IPA i have had. very piney and floral tasting hops. you can tell someone put a lot of work in on this Recipe. mouth feel is great, its not too malty with a lot of piney floral hop punch. nice bitter bite after too. the ABV is just right for me 6.0% i can sit around and drink a 6 pack of these without being totally hammered like i get with some IPA's. it is a very crisp bitterness. all in all i really like this beer. good job dogfish head....i love their indian brown ale too!"
"Overall, I would definitely pick up a six again, and enjoy it. One of the better IPAs out there."
"The beer has a nice amber hue with modest head which left a bit of lacing. The aroma is strong dose of citrus, piny, and flowery hops. The taste is also a big wallop of hops. The sweetness starts up front and gives way to increasing hoppiness as the beer moves toward the back. By the end the hops is powerful and flowery, but the initial sweetness provides the needed balance. The beer is juicy on the palate and pleasant. Overall a tasty IPA."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a brilliant pale gold. About a finger of fine bubbled head. Huge piney/citrusy hop aroma. The hops jump right out at you. Medium body. The hop flavor has a slight vegetal tang to it which dinged my rating a bit. Nice lacing on the glass. Could use a little more malt for me. Very drinkable."
"A golden body that was a tad cloudy with a decent head and good carbonation (this lead to some nice lacings). A citric and hoppy smell; a tad earthy even for a good balancing act. A full-bodied beer that has a light fruit taste, but mostly the hops and malt come out, mixing well for a semi-dry finish with a flavorful mouthfeel. Light in the hops compared to other IPAs, so no overdrying of the tongue/overpowering of the tastebuds that stronger IPAs might do. A nice beer to have a few of hanging around."
"I will drink again"
"Next target: 90 Minute IPA. April 2008."
"A very approachable IPA. Drinkability and flavor is there, and I would use this to introduce anyone to the style."
"Drinkability - I think this has got to be one of my more favorite IPA's. It's a quality brew that I wouldn't be afraid of the aftermath if I had a few. I'm sure the 90 and 120 are much more bitter and intense (and something I definitely need to try), but this is a beer I could see myself grabbing more often, as its great and not entirely challenging."
"D: A nice offering for DFH. I'd call this is a summer brew and fire up the grill."
"D - This may be the finest IPA I've ever had. It is easy drinking and delicious."
"Both in the bottle and in the glass, this beer was incredibly clear. It was sweeter and less hoppy than your average IPA, creating a slightly creamy, delicious effect. The aroma was fantastic towards the end of the glass (I drank this beer out of a wine glass) and the aftertaste was excellent. This is an excellent beer that would satisfy beer enthusiasts and possibly serve as a gateway beer for people who only drink domestic lagers."
"What hasn't been said about the DFH 60 Minute IPA? Considered one of the best east coast IPAs, and deservedly so, it marries sweet, caramel nutty malts and floral, piney, citrusy hoppy goodness about as perfectly as one could want. Bottoms up!"
"D-A fantastic example of one of my favorite types of beer. This is a great IPA."
"A fine IPA. It is not my favorite style, but I really enjoyed this beer. This is something I will revisit."
"Mouthfeel is a bit slick from all the hops, but otherwise is good. Carbonation cuts right through the sweet malt to make this one nice and refreshing. Drinkability is good for an IPA. I could drink these all night. Since this was one of, if not the first, craft beer that I had, it will always hold a special place in my heart. It is good and very enjoyable all around, but it is still just an american IPA. I love it, and probably always will, but it isn't going to blow the minds of those who have had dozens of IPAs before."
"For a beer that is a few months old it seems to have lost a lot of the hoppiness that other people rave about in this beer. Other IPAs seem to age a lot better. I better hurry up and drink the rest of the 6pak before it looses any more hop flavor."
"This is one of my favorites, it's about time I got around to reviewing it."
"The beer poured with a clear pale amber body and had a big white head that left lots of creamy rings of lacing. It smelled of american hops, but was a bit more muted than I would have expected. The taste was very smooth and admirably well-balanced for the style, with the signature Dogfish Head hop oil flavor not overpowering a pleasant blend of malts. I would get it again."
"Overall average: 3.8"
"D: This was a very drinkable IPA. It was medium bodied, well bananced and it had a modest ABV."
"wow what a great ipa, this one is good good good, bought this baby in a six pack and drank them all in about 48 hours. dogfish really know their ipa's, this one is by far my favorite of their 60, 90 and 120 min series. very drinkable, hoppy but not over the top, the dogfish is much more a dry bitter than the citrus that a lot of west coast ipas have. very good"
"D - well yeah this is a totally drinkable beer! I could easily knock back several (or more) of these in one sitting. Having had it so much it's not something I immediately seek to buy/order, but I'm glad I went back to it last night. Look forward to having again sooner than later"
"Cheers to xtacyturbo for the trade!"
"Ahh how the taste buds have changed through 2 solid years of Beer Advocacy. This is not just a good beer it is a great one. Hoppy Full of Flavor and lots of complexity. Drinkablity, my freinds and I order this by the pitcher now."
"D: This is one very easy to drink IPA. If you like hops, it's got you covered, but it won't scare anyone away. At each stage of the sip, there is something different offered. It's probably easy to get carried away, but it's just so charming and welcoming while being amply daring. This is definitely one to keep on hand."
"From the bottle into a pint glass. It was a nice clear orangish amber color. About an inch of off-white colored head that doesn't stay very long, but nice lacing is left behind while you drink. Nice citrusy and hoppy smell to it. It has a nice clean hoppy taste with a bite at the end. Might sound like all hops, but the malts provide a great backbone, which gives the brew great balance. Mouthfeel is clean with a medium body and appropriate carbonation. Drinkability: i always end up drinking more than one and try to keep it as a staple in my fridge."
"Rich amber pour with a surprisingly short lived white head in a tulip-ish glass. Smell was a soapy, clean, almost herbal or piney big hoppiness. Very fresh, clean tasting, and surprisingly restrained hops in the taste. Quite easy drinking, and even though it opens up and bitters slightly more as it warms, its still somewhat mild, and has a nice honey sweet malt backing. Very enjoyable, especially for such a widely available and reasonably priced IPA in the area. I will definitely get this again."
"D - a 6 pack is a must. This beer is just too good to have one."
"Pours from the bottle a bright, deep gold color with a thick, off white head. The head eventually diminishes to float just on the surface leaving lots of lacing down the glass. The smell is very pronounced, as I think it should be. It's full of pine and citrus notes that are lovely. The grapefruit aroma is complimented by an assertive malt profile followed by subtle yeasty notes. The taste is malty with alot of grapefruit and orange character and the bitterness smacks you in the face as it dances on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel has a medium body to it and rolls around the mouth with the carbonation leaving a slight sting wherever it lands. I love this beer and can't wait to try the 90 minute and 120 minute versions!"
"Overall, a very enjoyable IPA-- one of my favorite. I enjoyed the beer much more on draught than in a bottle, not that I disliked the bottle. On draught the citrus and pine notes come out a bit more through the hoppiness. Would absolutely drink again if it was on tap."
"Very drinkable, and reasonably priced as well. A solid IPA in all respects."
"d: Good drinking ipa, like the grapefruit notes. I think I prefer the 90 minute, but this one gets marks for drinkability and price. Maybe a little short of the elite ipa list, but still very good."
"A tad too hoppy for my likes but a good beer."
"D--Very drinkable. Great example of an IPA."
"This IPA is a solid staple and a great example of what the East Coast is capable of when it comes to IPAs."
"Overall, a very good IPA. Has a hard time living up to its big brother, the 90-minute, but is still an excellent brew from Dogfish Head."
"smooth with lively carbonation."
"What a pleasant surprise. This beer has plenty of complexity which makes it a pleasure to review. The beer pours a golden amber that is very clear. Unlike other reviewers comments, this beer had zero cloudiness or any yeasty residuals floating about ... none. There is some head and retention, mostly bubbly white that fades to the edges of the glass. The carbonation is modest. The smell is very nice. I'm getting nice fresh hops, hoppy resins and esters, piney notes, and sweetish malts to come. The aroma is enticing, but drink on. The taste is quite complex. It begins with some sweetish malts, some citrus, fruitiness in the apricot family. This quickly gets overtaken by a nice hop bite, slightly dry, resinous, with a grassiness imparted as well. There is an underlying sweetness to this beer that balances out the hop bite and this gives the beer its complexity. The beer is overall pretty medium bodied, modestly carbonated, but there is a throaty aftertaste that would lead one to believe there is more ABV than there actually is. This is a very fine beer well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"The mouthfeel was creamy making it a very drinkable beer."
"Taste is also controlled by the hops with some balance from the malt. Not as smooth though which ends up costing it for this IPA."
"Overall, a decent take on an IPA. A good everyday beer. Nothing too special, but just enough is there for you to appreciate it."
"Notes: If I had to stick a lable on this brew I'd slap on ""mild, balanced, and delicious."" If you're new to IPAs and you want to try one that defines the style, try this. And like I said before, this is an excellent session beer."
"D: I enjoyed this one a lot."
"The beer and brewery that put controlled hop chaos onto the market, and blazed a trail for American hopheads. A classic."
"The aftertaste is not too strong, and this thick concoction goes down smooth. Absolutely an IPA you can drink down easily ."
"Overall, a different kind of IPA, its goodness lies in its impeccable balance."
"D: I count on this as one of my great session beers, as it continually keeps the mouth alert when drinking more than one, and is a great tasting brew throughout an afternoon/evening."
"Pours a clear golden with an average head and some excellent lacing. The smell is piny bitter hops, and some hints of grainy malts. The taste again features the piny hops, but with hints of lemon and a fairly well balanced effort from the malts. The mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on for a heavy session beer. Defiantly an IPA i use to judge others against, balanced easy to come across, and one of my first."
"This beer is a clear, golden yellow color with a big fluffy white head that leaves loads of sticky lacing on the glass. The smell of citrus and floral hops is all you're gonna get when you sniff. The taste is absolutely one of the best IPA's out there, great hoppy flavors, subtlely balanced with malt. It's light bodied with crisp carbonation, and can very easily be sessioned."
"Hey DFH - what happened?!!!"
"This will clearly open your senses right at the first sip. It is going to be something you love or hate instantly. A great deal of flavor in this brew. I noticed a whole lot of hops with hints of grapefruit or something like that in both the taste and smell. Cask conditioned would be perfect for this brew."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel prevented the drinkability from being higher - the taste is outstanding but it isn't a beer I could drain right away. Overall, I like this beer and will definitely drink more but can't see this as being a session beer."
"Now cue my mom, c. 1987 describing me to a friend of hers as being ""the most jaded person [she had] ever met."" Har, redux!"
"Great mouth feel and good finish. I've been drinking this brew for over a year now. I've had it on tap as well as from the bottle, and it is consistently good."
"D- An excellent beer, low-ish ABV makes this one a great one to sample in multiples."
"D - This here is an awesome IPA great taste and not too crazy with the abv so you can drink it all night definitely worth a try"
"Overall... Mmmhmmm.... This brew went great with cheese... I sliced up some salsa jack for bottle #3 and they complemented eachother greatly. Can't wait to try the 90 minute and 120 minute IPA's"
"Pours a light amber gold with a monster head that is light tan in color. Hops with citrus edge, caramel, some earthy smoke on the nose. Flavor is slightly hoppy with a medium keeled robust body to it. Feel is good. Nice level of bubble. Thick with body from ingredients. Definitely drinkable. Wont go down as the all time best for the style, but its good. And good to go back to again."
"Not the best, but a very formiddable beer."
"This IPA is a classic and a real treat to have."
"My first-ever brew from the Dogfish Head company, and after hearing alot about their 60-minute and 120-minute IPA's, I must say I was very impressed with this sample... pours a copper-golden color with visible carbonation and an impressive foamy head present... smell is very hoppy and has a slight citrus aroma to it which I found to be very appealing... taste is dominated by hops and a lemon-like overtone which is a little different for an IPA... pours a lot lighter than I had anticipated... taste is rich and thick and a really good representation of an IPA - one of the better ones I've tried... really liked this brew and will probably try the 120 minute one pretty soon... awesome brew... Definitely recommended..."
"* had it again on tap and maybe this was a better batch. looked great with an incredibly fresh and zesty hop aroma"
"The color of the beer is a clearish amber. Hoppy and tropical are the words I would use the describe the taste of this beer. The balance between the malts and hops is good for an IPA, and it complimented my chicken sausage pizza."
"Notes: It had been awhile since I'd had a fresh bottle of DFH 60 Minute and it reminded me why I originally liked their stuff. This is a solid drinking IPA. Nice and flavorful, with hops the dominant trait, but not over the top. Reminded me in some ways of the Bear Republic Racer 5, so now I'm thinking I need to do a side-by-side for comparison's sake and maybe throw in a Stone IPA and Southern Tier IPA (other favorites of mine) as well."
"The taste is citrus and hops: mostly grapefruit with lots of bubbling on the nose. I have drank several of these and sometimes I detect a little smokiness. Also, this beer is just a tad astringent. Pretty drinkable. Very clean tasting. This turns out to be a very drinkable beer."
"definitely recommended. it is ""the continually hopped, super-fantastic india pale ale."""
"We had this on draught and after all the giddiness of double IPAs and 90/120 minute monsters, the 60 minute is comparatively ordinary. On draught it did not stand out against three other hoppy beers on offer (like Two Brothers Heavy Handed). I think the serving temperature, a bit below cellar, did not help in that respect. Clear pale walnut, notable hop character on the nose, did not do much on the palate, predominant bitterness lingering on the finish."
"D: This was the beer that began my road to becoming a hophead. It was unlike anything I had before, and it led me into the world of DFH beers, and eventually to the 90 minute and so-on. This is a great IPA, and a very drinkable one. One of DFH's finest standard ales."
"D - Great IPA. IPA's are not one of my favorite styles but this is definitely one I like."
"Poured a dark gold with a nice head that took a while before it faded away. The aroma was of Northwest hops - citrus & pine needles. It tasted very hoppy but well balanced with a bit of a roasty malt flavor. The mouthfeel is pleasant with a light malty feel to it. A must drink IPA!"
"Truly a great beer. I have recently emailed the brewmaster at Dogfish Head and told him that since I've ""discovered"" the 60 and 90 min IPA..That I've move the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale to the back of the fridge and eliminated Redhook ESB.. His response ? ""Bad for them, Good for us..Enjoy"" ! A local BBQ shack here in Hampton, VA always has 60 min IPA on Tap.. Awesome with BBQ.."
"I can't wait to get my hands on the 90 minute IPA."
"Notes: I'm adding this beer to my ""regular"" list and would definately recommend it to others."
"The flavor was real smooth and balanced between malt and hops. Good quality IPA. Body was medium/light and went down real smooth. The nose was distracting (despite its meager 6% abv) but other than that it was a real good beer."
"yellowish orange color and immediately vanishing head leaves a non impressive appearance.the smell, on the other hand, is friggen amazing. an explosion of citrusy, piney, grapefruity HOPS. dry hopping at its best. Taste is just a notch down, as the bitterness takes over. nowhere near to the point of puckering, though. medium bodied, medium carbonation. its all about the hops here. this beer is a staple american ipa to which i will continually return."
"Clear amber color with a modest head a decent lacing. Aroma of grapefruit hops that is nicely balanced by the malt for a very drinkable session beer. Also goes well with food. Mouth feel is full with good carbonation and I cant stop drinking them. A very nice everyday beer."
"Pours light copper big head that dissipates and laces nicely to the glass. Big aroma of hops and fresh herbal notes, taste is overwhelmingly the hops, very little bit of malt taste. Bitter aftertaste seems unbalanced in a good way. Exellent ale to have around if you want friends to understand what hops can bring to beer."
"Very light and refreshing. I can't believe its 6%. The smell is of very fresh hops and a great mouth feel. It is an amazing pale ale. It is very crisp and refreshing and gorgeous in a glass. The beer in the brewpub is so fresh its insane. Literally sometimes a couple of days to a couple of months to a couple of years."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a chalice. Poured a beautiful golden amber with a nice head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma was of hops, but with citrus and something that has been roasted. Taste was hoppy but not overpowering. Citrus came through but there was a really unexpected malty backbone that really balanced the beer. Mouthfeel is great; light and malty. Coats your mouth in the flavor. Drinkability is far beyond the 90 and the 120."
"D = A good, solid beer, but would probably pick another more distinctive IPA if I was only going to have one beer."
"This a just an all around, solid session beer. Pours a clear color and smells of grapefruit. Has a nice citrusy grapefruit taste as well, not overwhelming, but satisfying. The head is craggy and leaves a nice lacing down the glass. Very crisp and smooth with a nice drying finish. This one is a solid brew that I will be revisiting."
"D: Very good. I could drink several of these (and have in the past)."
"Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA pours a hazy amber-golden color with a two finger head. There is some head retention with a thin white lace throughout consumption. The smell is somewhat fruity with floral hoppiness and the trace of a buttery smell. The taste offers abundant herbal hops. There is more maltiness than I was expecting ( a plus for me), which offers a good balance. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I'm just getting into IPA's and this is certainly a good one. I think I need to compare with Dogfish Head's 90 and 120 during the same session to compare."
"I really enjoyed this beer along with the 90 minute...I personally found the 90 minute to be better constructed, however I have yet to try the 120 minute, just a matter of time"
"Overall a pretty nice, well balanced ipa. Lots of fresh hops, with an equally heavy malt profile that made this beer much sweeter, and less hoppy than expected. This is usally the first ""real"" ipa I recommend to friends, because it's not just hops in a glass..(mmmm, hops in a glass...). The label used to read ""bottle conditioned", but not this batch. Sad, because there's a definite drop in overall quality. It's still a great all around, well balanced ipa."
"Drinkability: Great, drinkable IPA. Well crafted and does its job without going over the top."
"The 60 minute pours a clear almost lager color with a quickly dissipating foam head. I did not see any freshness date on the bottle. The smell was a nice citrusy aroma. The taste was balanced with a cookie maltness on the backend. It was very thin for me in the mouth. Overall a good IPA."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite sessioners, I could drink this often and never grow tired of it."
"Crystal clear golden yellow with just a hint or red. Head is barely present, and then plain gone. By appearance, I wondered I grabbed a bottle with a leak and beer was nearly flat. Very nice left-coast hop aroma with a mellow topping of pine and citrus. Not overwhelming. Malt aroma in the far background. Like the aroma, the flavor is all about the hops, with the malt tethering the whole presentation to terra firma. The malt body really wants to make itself at home on your tonsils, but the hops now come to rescue and chase it off. Overall not a session beer, but that's not what an american IPA is about. For what it is it's quite drinkable, even if that means you stop at two or three instead of one."
"D- This is very drinkable and would be easy to session. More toned down and perhaps better balanced version than the 90 min."
"The hops get to be too much for me after about two of these. But when i am in the mood for an IPA without the punch of 90, this one suits me."
"Comments: A fine beer!"
"Final thoughts  Very smooth, clean, and refreshing. One of the best IPA experiences Ive ever had. This is an exceptional well crafted brew."
"Clear deeper-gold colored brew, small white head tops it. Caramel malts on the nose get dominated by a floral array of hops. Sweet caramel malt front, main event is nice bitter and floral hop. Medium mouth, creamy body. Very nice IPA, not a mega-hop monster, but it sounds like the 90 and 120 got that covered. Very nice."
"The beverage had a dark gold appearance when it was poured out. The smell was very strong. It had a sour, tangy and citrus odor that made the mouth water. Its taste was similar to the smell with a very refreshing crispness. The drink had a nice sting in the mouth from its ingredients. It was pretty light so it went down nice. Overall, a smooth, strong IPA with quite an aroma."
"the rep for a reason. If you can get some, then get some!"
"Pours an attractive amber/orange color that begs to be drank. Nice white head that lingers a while. Aroma is very pleasant blend of citrus and floral aromas. Taste is very well balanced between the malt and hops. Nice citrus flavors. Mouthfeel is very nice. This is a very sessionable IPA. Good Stuff."
"A great beer from DFH!!!!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied on the palate with appropriate levels of carbonation, it does not get in the way of the overall body or the flavor of this brew. The finish is semi-dry. This is a beer I'd definitely buy again. A really great brew, not quite as hoppy as 90 minute and definitely not as hoppy as 120 minute, it seems to me that this would be a ""crossover"" IPA for someone that was used to APAs but not really IPAs. Overall a great offering from DFH."
"Drinkability: I only got a single this time.... but the overall sensation of this ale warrents at least a sixer next time.... Recommended, solid beer."
"I think this might be my favorite IPA. Dogfish does this brand so well, and I hear the the other IPAs are incredible."
"I heard good things about this beer so I decided to pick up a bottle at the local Beerporium. After pouring it I was greeted by the pleasant smell that reminded me very much of malts. There was about a quarter of an inch head and it was a light brown color. There was a decent amount of lacing and the first taste I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting an overwhelming amount of hops and a bitter finish, but instead the taste is very smooth and has there was no unpleasant aftertaste. The hops are definitely there but not obtrusively so. I tend to favor beers with less hops but this one may enter my regular rotation. The carbonation was pleasant and maybe even a bit mild. As far as drinkability I'd probably be able to put back four or five, but I think I'd much rather just sit and enjoy them one at a time."
"Not too bad. It seems to be a very simple IPA. There's not a lot of complexity in the smell or taste. It's light feel is almost like a lager. I had higher expectations. This is like training wheels for IPAs."
"Great Beer!"
"Everything about this beer is clean, and wonderful. Appearance a brilliant gold, light champagne bubbles and a perfect head. The nose is stricken by honey-sweetness, crisp and hoppy. The standout feature of the taste is the clarity, honey & hops wash away without a trace. Remarkable... Mouthfeel is equally pristine, but not without richness. Beautiful IPA, not tremendously complex, but executed with great virtuosity."
"D: Smooth, but not too bitter."
"D: Pretty good for a medium bodied IPA like this; not my first choice for a long session, but great with meals or kicking back for a bit. Relatively high ABV could catch you off guard - you really can't tell from the taste."
"D: With a nice balance after the initial hop hit, and an easy drinking body, this brew gets high marks. This growler won't make it past the Bengals game."
"D- A malty IPA!!! DFH does some out-there beers, but there is a reason why their IPAs are the staple and come in 6-packs instead of 4-packs and are priced a little more reasonably. A malt-mouths IPA... brazen you say, but innovations like this are the reason why DFH s leading the craft beer revolution. Here's to the craft beer's golden age. THREE CHEERS!!"
"The taste is bitter but balanced with a sweet bread malt quality. Also has a yeasty fruity spice. Very drinkable glad to have some left."
"Drinkability- A good beer to sit back and enjoy."
"Golden copper beer pours clear with a small cap for a head. Immediate aroma is of whole hop cones. Taste is surprisingly fruity sweet. A wonderful peach flavor and aroma emerge from this brew to create one of the most drinkable IPA's in the American style. A mild alcohol warmth rounds out the experience. Wow, great brew and another hit from Dogfish Head."
"I can't believe it has taken me this long to taste this beer. It is a very solid IPA and one I will be drinking more of in the future."
"Drinkability - This was a damn good beer. I can't wait until we get this beer in the store!"
" As another reviewer mentioned, it's not a very complex beer but what else would you be seeking in such a strong IPA?"
"Very much a drinkable beer, and definitely worth picking up."
"I had some waiting for the Cape Mays-Lewes ferry (they had it on the ferry too) and then at the brew pub, of course. Go there. Do that. You won't regret it."
"This really is the consummate American IPA, with a large helping of American hops, but nothing that is overbearing or distracting. There are citrus and pine flavors to go along with the flowery notes. And, unlike their 90 minute (which is also good as a DIPA) the malt is not overpowering, but rather subtle, stern, and appreciated. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily. Finish is dry. I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Another great one from DFH."
"Drinkability- This is pretty tasty stuff but not really as hoppy as I was hoping. Its not quite on the same level as say Stone IPA, Two Hearted Ale, Inversion IPA or even Sweetgrass IPA (although its much closer to this then the aforementioned three). It is a good solid beer though that I did enjoy. Cant wait to try 90 and 120 minute!"
"I now live in Philadelphia and this beer is much better closer to the source. Hop character is much more pronounced. More orange rind and herbal/floral flavors and aromas than the bottle obtained in Oregon. Seems a little more bitter as well. Much better."
"D - I liked it so much I stopped on the way home and got 6 of it's bottled friends. This was a refreshing beer and I enjoyed every sip of it"
"Had this on-tap at Bodega in the Short North of Columbus, OH. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a clear golden yellow - very appealing. Nice white head with great retention through the whole pint. Bit of lacing on the glass. Aromas and flavors of citrus hops and honey. Mild bitterness in the finish. A bit woody. Overall, very well balanced. Good fizzy carbonation that helps the head. Very refreshing after a hot day of work. Nicely balanced. A very strong example of an American IPA."
"60 Minute pours a slightly hazy light copper to amber color with a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is nice oily hops not just the usual citrusy hoppiness either it is a bit deeper here pretty piney as a matter of fact, it is actually quite refreshing for an American IPA. The taste is interesting the bitterness is on the high side but the hop flavor is subdued and I'm really only getting a lot of hoppy oily flavor. The malt flavor may be just a bit too light for this beer but since the bitterness isn't such a quick punch to the mouth like many other IPAs it doesn't really leave you looking for more malt. Mouthfeel is better than decent almost syrupy thick surprisingly thick for an IPA but again it works in this case. For an IPA with bitterness this high this beer is also surprisingly drinkable like I've said before this is a different kind of IPA, different in a good way it makes me wish some more American brewers would mix it up a bit and bring us a bit more with their IPAs."
"Pours a clear golden amber with orange hue. Pearl frothy head that laces as it dies to a collar. Smells of citrus and grassy with a tiny bit of spice and lots of hops. Tastes of hops but mildly so. Grapefruit, orange rind and pine. Finishes bitter. Feels medium in the mouth. This is a refreshing brew. An intro to the delicious IPA series by Dogfishead."
"D: Excellent and no wonder it is a standard-bearer"
"The high reviews of hophead beers on BA are starting to swing me - I'm actually craving it more. DFH is a good way to satisfy that craving."
"I was able to find this brew along with the 90 and 120-minute IPAs at my neighborhood beer store. I thought I'd go with the 60 since I don't have too many IPAs under my belt, and didn't want to overwhelm myself and make a harsh judgment on IPAs based on a 120. Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass dark gold. Very attractive 1-inch head that fades rather quickly. Smells of very light hops and a hint of citrus, but not overwhelming the nostrils. Probably not the most appealing scented beer, but still calls to be drunk. The taste was a pleasant surprise. Light hops taste with some hints of citrus, and amazingly light on the palette. Medium-bodied and not too carbonated. Overall, wonderful beer and probably a great IPA to start off with. If these were more widely available around where I live, Magic Hat and Dogfish's IPA would have to contend for my brew of choice to session with."
"Eric"
"A good standard AIPA. Bright piney hops flavors combine with slightly carmel maltiness. But the hops are the real winners in this combination. Bitterness is great for style, though slightly too much for my mouth at this time. And while the lacing is great, the color is kinda yellow and doesn't give the best impression to my eyes. All in all a beer I would enjoy again, but would probably choose it's big brother beers first over it."
"I'm just not a fan of this drink like others are. Maybe I'm not a fan of IPA's in general....that being said this drink is somewhat enjoyable and goes down pretty well, I just don't like the taste I get which makes me shy away from the drink. I'll try the 90minute and give it a shot"
"This classic brew pours a solid orange with big-time citrus aromas hitting you with some hoppy pine sap smells also there. Taste is alive with hop oils and a little bit of citrus and pine needles. This brew is thick and in your face with a nice grapefruit-like aftertaste. This is a big beer, more drinkable than the 90-minute and 120-minute incarnations. This is a real American classic."
"The most important part of this ""continually hopped India Pale Ale"" made by the people who proudly claim that they make ""off centered ales for off centered people"" is how it tastes. I dunno what kind of weird experiments the Dogfish Head brewmasters out in Delaware are doing to their hops but I hope they keep doing it. GRAPEFRUIT!!! That's what I'm tasting? It's all about the hops here and they have have this total sour-n-sweet smack and a sharp and spicy yet somewhat clean finish. Tart yet sweet...Bitter yet sparkling. If you're one of those people who likes the balance and complexities between the hops and malt this may not be your thing but if you're not afraid of hoppy zing as I am but sometimes feel that a twist and turn needs to be thrown into the works every now and then this 6%er totally hits the spot."
"Overall, a very clean, drinkable IPA that lacks complexity, but scores high in its drinkability."
"D-This is an above average IPA, a great beer that can be sessioned. Very well balanced despite being well hopped."
"D: Smells way better than it tastes."
"Perfect drinkability and solid head retention on this one."
" Not my favorite IPA but worth a try nonetheless. Definitely one of the better ones out there."
"Nice medium body with average carbonation. Drying, slightly bitter aftertaste has me longing for another sip. These go down so easily, especially on-tap, that I can get into some trouble if I am not careful. Don't take my word for it, though, pick up a sixer for yourself."
"Great IPA. You can drink it like water and it's not expensive at all."
"Personal Rating: 80%"
"Light copper-yellow color with a 3-finger off-white head that really holds with some lacing. A nice hoppy aroma with light citrus highlights and a hint of banana I thought. The flavor is a beautiful hop/malt blend with a floral finish. A bit of alcohol noted and a fairly creamy feel. Very full bodied and flavored but so nicely blended that I think you could easily handle a few or more of these at a time."
"D - I like this beer. I've been on a bit of a beer journey lately, and I said ""I won't go back if I forget to review a beer."" For this beer I broke that rule, because I thought it deserved it. A nice solid example of a IPA."
"A good IPA, but not one that blows my socks off. All things considered, I'd rather have the 90 Min."
"A decent IPA, but I would rather have an Avery IPA or a HopDevil. When it comes to Dogfish Head, I will reach for the 90 Minute everytime."
"Pretty good IPA. Not over-the-top. I liked it."
"I tried this for the first time last summer, and it became one of my favorite beers, a status it retains even after I have tried many more. The 60 Minute pours a clear amber with a frothy head that sticks around, leaving lace all the way down the glass. To the nose, it betrays pine and citrus hops with traces of grain that are present as well in the taste. It's not too bitter like many IPAs, the hoppiness is more aromatic and at the edges of your palate rather than the donkey-punch many deliver. At the end a faint maltiness that blends well with the outdoorsy hops and it doesn't feel like you're left with IPA dragon-breath. It is clear and refreshing feeling in the mouth, light, it's not going to coat your mouth or anything, and at 6%, I could drink these all day and all night. Dogfish Head's staple IPA is my favorite example of the style."
"Served a nice crisp light amber with a thin diminishing head. Nice pine hops in the aroma with some citrus present as well. The taste is very well balanced with citrus dominating the hop profile. The beer is very refreshing and light for 6%. This is definitely one of the best widely available IPAs."
"Bought a 6 pack that was a month old (still generally fresh to me). The hops still have the same earthy/spicy character but the taste has a bit too much of a sweetness and gives off that grainy impression. For an IPA it's not something I'm gonna drink a lot."
"12 oz bottle. Have also had it on tap in Tallahassee. Pours a clear amber with light carbonation. The head is fizzy, a little over 1 cm in height, and off-white. The aroma is quite hoppy, a mix of citrus and herbs. The initial flavor is moderately bitter and yet a hint of sweetness. It finishes slightly bitter, from the amount of hops no doubt, and is short in duration. Great drinkability and one of my favorite IPA's."
"D: Easily drinkable, a very tasty well-made beer from Dogfish Head - please come back to CA."
"This was one of my early gateway brews into the IPA realm. I could drink the 60 Minute all night long. I have had the 90 and 120 Minute but still prefer the 60."
"D - There isn't a damn thing wrong with this beer. I expected it to be a bit more ""in your face"" given the outlandishness of DFH's other brews, but this is eminently drinkable and quite tasty, if a bit sweetish."
"D-"
"Drinkability is still somewhat diminished for me by the long bitterness of the aftertaste. I know that's exactly to style, but I would have to switch to something else before drinking a second one of these."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This IPA poured a clear golden amber color with a decent sized rocky head that slowly faded away. Some ok lacing was left behind. The aroma consisted of bright citrus and pine notes, followed by a hint of caramel. The flavor was an excellent balance of sweet fruit, caramel, and hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel was lightly resiny and medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated. Just right for an everyday beer. Not to over the top, but definately not boring. Another supurbly crafted brew from Dogfish Head."
"D - This beer is such a fantastic session beer. Except for those who are totally against bittering hops, it's a wonderfully drinkable beer. My favorite session beer."
"Aroma is very strong and delightfully hoppy, with a smoky or burnt undertone. It pours a beautiful golden-amber with a nice thick but not too persistent head. Flavor is very hoppy without being overly bitter; I detect a hint of smokiness. It goes down rough and sassy and leaves behind plenty of hop aftertaste."
"Awesome beer, one that's a staple in my fridge."
"D- a very smooth beer that tastes great and makes you want to go back and back, finished the bottle pretty quickly"
"Pours a white, DFH-like rocky head over a sparkling amber body. This brew is a flagship staple for DFH, and holds onto all the charactersistics of the brand. It has that wonderful, deeply citrusy, and lightly perfume hop nose, while providing in the nose, even, a notice to all, that balance is the key to this brew. The taste is on style, and complex enough to call it a great beer, but not not so much to pull away from the drinkability and mouthfeel factor. This is the beer, for an IPA guy or not, that you should have a case in the cooler, served well chilled IMO that everyone can appreciate. It is a greatly unobtrusive or oppresive IPA that can be had for a long night, or just with dinner. Sam really nailed this one down. I hope it never changes, as I firmly believe it can be a great gateway IPA for non-hopheads."
"Two Thumbs Up"
"Very tasty beer. Prominent hops flavor but not the head-busting hops blast you find with many IPAs. Pours a clear, copper/dark gold color. Small head hold up for a while and recedes to a covering of the glass. Some lacing. There is some sweet maltiness coming through but the main taste is mild but bitter hops. One reviewer used the phrase ""earthy hops"" and this really nails the taste!!!! A smooth, good tasting but mild IPA. Rich mouthfeel....very drinkable. I have had this one before but never got around to reviewing it. A nice beer for hop heads and non-hop heads alike."
"Pours a very pale copperish color. Thin white head. Smell is slightly citrusy and very herbal. The taste if full of herbal hops. This isn't a big IPA. Nice balance, clear herbal hop presence, medium body. Balanced beer, but the flavor is slightly off to me. Drinkability is very good for an IPA. Not too heavy on the alcohol or on the palate."
"About 9 bucks a six-pack"
"I loved the 90-minute and thought I would be disappointed with this, but was very pleasantly surprised. This beer has greater drinkability, and the cross of citrusy, almost apple fruit is well balanced with a big hoppiness and more malt than I was expecting in a Dogfish IPA. I love this beer, and I have given away more than I should, but sharing is a great part of enjoying a new discovery, right?"
"These guys know what they are doing and it shows in all catergories of what makes a beer stand above the rest."
"Pours a nice hazy orange-ish golden color. It has the aroma of citrus and HOPS! In the taste the hops are there, citrus and a little sweet. It has a sticky lacing to the glass, however I cannot say enough good stuff about this beer. I think it has to be a great standard IPA."
"It's medium-bodied and demonstrates decent complexity. A flavorful, hopped-brew that's drinable and not overwhelming."
"I thought I had reviewed this before, but I guess not. Easy to find locally. Pours a yellow color with a slight green tinge?? Smells better than it looks. Tastes even better, very hoppy, nice honey malt sweetness and finishes bitter again. Been a while since I had 60 minute, looks like I will have to buy it a lot more often."
"Brown bottle (12oz) from Park Slope Food Coop in Brooklyn. Solid. A great beer to have year round. You should always have these at hand. Pours reddish gold with a nice half inch head. Hops in the aromas, nice. Hops in the flavor, nice. Fresh and zesty. Great balance in flavor, smell and mouthfeel. Very easy to drink, great to session. 60 min. IPA is hard to beat."
"American IPA's are my favorite style and this one is definitely great but not top notch IMO. It's lacking the bite that I'm used to with IPA's. Will buy this one again though."
"This is a very smooth brew even with the large amount of hops; very balanced. I could have several of these and not get tired of it. Very well done. A rather different IPA and I would have to say one of my favorites."
"Highly recommended."
"Truly, a fantastic IPA. This is what I think of when I think IPA.... well made and well balanced. I love it because it isn't just a huge hop bomb. I love the hops, but save them for the DIPA's and barleywines. This is what a standard IPA should be in my mind. Granted, I do think that this was better in the past, and more recently seems to have picked up a bit of a metallic hop twang, but it's still a great everyday beer. DFH just doesn't disappoint. This is one beer that is well worth all the attention it gets."
"A bit thanks to elricorico for sharing. Great beer!"
" a very sessionable fellow"
"Pours out a clear golden color. Very small head. I belive this is probably from the hop oils as I think they inhibit large long lasting heads. Smell is great with lots of hops and citrus aromas. This beer is loaded with flavor. The first thing you taste is the hops then a grapefruit flavor followed by malts. Tastes good and warm. A very drinkable beer. This might be my favorite American IPA."
"I have a couple friends who are no doubt tired of hearing me sing the praises of all things Dogfish, so this review may surprise them. This would make a great lawnmower beer, but frankly, my repertoire has no need of a lawnmower beer. Its got a nice golden color and a good head, but not much taste for an IPA. Good, clean, hoppy finish, actually pretty refreshing. In reviewing another beer I said it's the beer Sam Adams wants to be; well, 60 Minute IPA is the beer Budweiser wants to be. So I'll recommend this to my friends who are near-hopelessly stuck in mainstream, but for those who are more savvy, it's pretty dull."
"Pours a light copper golden color with a decent white head that dissipated into a nice cap, not much lacing. The smell is a nice juicyfruit hop aroma. Has a nice fresh buddy hop taste, not as strong as your serious AIPAs, but gets its point across. It has a light feel but is not watery, has a creamy texture to it and finishes very well, overall a good balance. A nice buddy IPA that doesn't crush your tastebuds. It is a little weak compared to some of the other top rated AIPAs but that leads to a very drinkable brew."
"Note: I have had this many times before and never really thought about how balanced and un-hoppy it is. Of course, the last few IPA's I had were very hoppy."
"B'ham UK"
"Considering the wide range of beers coming out of DFH, this is their most ""typical"" beer. This is the one I'd give my Dad to try. Easy to drink, with nice hop flavor and aroma coming through, but not overpowering. Although I like the beer, I wouldn't buy a lot of it, I think Terminal Gravity IPA is tastier for the price. Good beer, though."
"this beer is a great one, atleast for the beginning. normally dogfish beers are pretty heavy and hard to grasp.. even the aprihop was alittle too much for me... but this one isnt overly bitter and actually easy to drink. the hop scent is definately there but actually really delicious. overall, if someone has nver had this and is frightened by ipa's try it out. it may open you up."
"This beer is a spin on the typical IPA found in your local liquor store. Dogfish brews the beer for 60 minutes (hence the name) and creates a good tasting beer with an above average alcohol content. 60 min brewing = 6.0 abv. While I do not like most IPA's, dogfish's distinct taste seperates them from the rest of the field with a non-IPA lover's IPA beer."
"This is a very godd IPA in my opinion. It poured a bright copper color with almost no head, yet left som lacing on the glass. Smelled strongly of hops and made it very attractive. The taste was very hop infused and lingered in my tounge for a long time, the alcohol content was also present in the taste but not to the point were it took away form the complexity of the beer itslef. I loved this beer although i prefer otherIPAs' to it but it was very drinkable."
"Wow - this is good! The hops weren't too pungent, just a subtle bitterness throughout. I can see why this is DFH's Flagship - it's a good intro to the craft world. I'd buy again, but it's too bad it's not available in Missouri (had to buy it in Chicago)."
"M/D: A tad too carbonated in my opinion, but very smooth and easy to drink."
"This beer truly is a nonpareil."
"This beer is very similar to the 90 minute IPA. The color is slightly lighter. This beer has a lighter taste with a lower IBU for sure. Overall a more drinkable (in succession) beer than the 90 minute due to milder overall mouthfeel. Very well crafted brew that is a better deal for the 6-pack than the 90 minute for the 4-pack."
"Nice light golden color. Subtle head, w/ a bit of lacing. Once I smelled this one it was all over. Floral hop aroma, no bullshit, just killer authentic hops. The taste was amazing! Yes, amazing! Hops were there, oh yeah they were there, but not crushing. I think any brewer can pull off a mouthful of greenery, but the malt in the back was a kiss on the cheek. This beer is a must pour for any fan of pale ales or IPA's. As a fan of IPA's this is the best I have had...enough said. If you haven't tried this beer, it should be on your trade list."
"It does not justify a low rating though. I like this brew."
"A nice American IPA with a different twist, meaning no cascade dominance. The hops were a bit harsher, which I liked, but were heavily floral and a sweet citrus, while still maintaining a good bitterness. There's a biscuit-like malt backbone that nice and appropriate for the style. Give it a try."
"Got a bottle of this the the other day at the bar and the worst thing about it was that the waitress totally snaked the label I got off of it when I was picking another beer. The body of the beer was a nice, dark amber color with a solid, off-white head. The retention did not impress em too muhc; it would reduce to a lacing, but a few swirls of the glass and I was back in business. The smell was fairly interesting; pretty hoppy with malty characteristics. The taste, though, was clearly that of an IPA. The hops were strong, up front, and very noticeable, squashing any thoughts of malts that I had before. The mouthfeel was also excellent; full-bodied and smooth always makes a good beer. For an IPA, this beer was very drinkable. The hops are not so prevalent that you feel like you are going to start having ulcers, but you can taste them a lot all the same. The mouthfeel, along with this great taste, makes this beer pretty solid and good tasting all the way around."
"In the bottle at Ruby Tuesdays of all places. A pleasant surprise on the menu. Pours a nice amber/gold with an ample white head. some lacing down the glass. Citrusy and floral hop aroma which translates to the taste as well. Hops are definitely what this beer is about, but some malt manages to sneak through in the flavor. A definite possibility as a session beer, especially compared to DFH's higher alcohol offerings."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white head, lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is more on the malty side, hoppy, citrusy, grapefruit, piney, and some caramel. The taste is awesome, but more on the malty side to me, hoppy, nice citrus taste. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice IPA, highly recommended."
"One a night is enough for me, though I really enjoy that one. Big thanks to my friend and coworker Jay who brought a sixer of this back for me from Chicago."
"Notes: a very strong IPA, definitely worth having in the fridge when you want that bitter taste."
"update..can not stop buying and consuming this beer."
"D: A well balanced IPA. Refreshingly clean and extremely sessionable. Recommended."
"This is an excellent style example, and a very solid brew."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light golden with quite a bit of carbonation. Somewhat light hop aroma, although this particular bottle was bottled nine months ago, if that makes any difference. The taste is not as knock-you-over hoppy as some other IPAs, but it is very nicely balanced. The hops do linger nicely in the aftertaste. It would be nice if Ontario's LCBO continued to stock this beer. They had it in stock for only a short while - it sold out immediately - and apparently they won't be stocking it again any time soon. That's good business sense for you!"
"Poured into a large mug a golden copper color with a big foamy white pillow top. The head lasted a while and left puffy lacing the entire glass. Smelled really clean with some hop character. Tasted like a burst of hops, very nice with some bitterness. Some mild pine and citrus. Very nice. I really like this beer and can enjoy it during dinner, swimming, yardwork, anything really. Great beer."
"Poured copper color with a 1 finger rocky head that mostly diminished. It still left a a fair amount of lacing behind. Heavy aroma of toasted grains upfront. Somewhere in the middle I got a hint of wet grass almost musky. Strange enough toward the end I smell dough and barnyard (don't ask). This light to medium body IPA was slightly bittersweet to start with a oily and salty middle that ended lively carbonated dry and bitter. Overall, I like this AIPA alot and will have plenty more. Give it DFH for another extreme beer (compare to other AIPA)."
"D- its addictive if you like hops but gets kind of boring towards the end."
"Poured a pure copper with good carbonation, a thick head, and good retention. It smells remarkably like its next biggest brother, but with a bit less sweetness but the same burst of hops. Of course it's hoppy in taste, but gives you enough to really enjoy but yet keeps it smooth and drinkable. Gotta have more!"
"Pours a beautiful gold color with a mild head with some lacing. smells distinctly of hops, but also of malt which for some ipa's is lacking, also a very strong pine scent is noticeable. Very full body in the mouth, almost thick, not as thick as the 90 minute, but still awesome. i strong tingling from the alcohol is first present then of course loads of hops and a slight malt aftertaste. i love the 90 minute, the 60 minute is very good, not quite as good, but still an awesome beer, i'm usually a fan of maltier beers but the past 2 dogfish head ipa's i've had make me want to try more"
"D: Not suprisingly, a darn fine IPA from dogfishhead, very well-balanced and delicious."
"Poured with an incredible amount of carbonation/foam. I could only pour half of the bottle and then had to let it settle before continuing. Ended up with a very thick head and lots of lace. The nose smells like hops but only in a general sense, I don't get hints of citrus or pine or other classic hop smells. The taste is obviously an american IPA, but the hops are not overpowering, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of malts here. There is a strong aftertaste, the hops are almost more apparent once you have swallowed (of course at that point it is just bitterness). This is a very nice IPA, hoppy and crisp, excellent for a summer day. I like this beer, but I think I would like a little more malt here."
"D: An good drinking IPA that retains a fair amount of hoppiness along with balance"
"Wanted to start going back and retrying some of my first reviews, figured I would start here. Poured a nice hazy amber with a big off white frothy pillow like head. Nice slow fade and good visible carbonation gave an always great look. Big citrus hop profile, orange, tangerice, pineapple express, mixed with a bit of a pine resin feel. Some decent malt balance to be found as it warmed. The flavor always hits the spot here again. This is just such a nice well rounded hopped up session beer. Just great all around and never really have a bad thing to say about it. Its the 90mins little brother and rightfully deserving of its spot next to it. Great Brew!"
"Outstanding American IPA, I would love to see this one coming to Nebraska."
"I've tried DFH beers before and never liked them. However, this one really hits the spot. I'll need to try more again."
"pours a clear light amber, almost blond color, ok head. citrus, pine, and a some dough in the nose. light/medium bodied, it starts with a medium honeyed malt sweetness up front immediately followed by a nice hop bitterness. a well-balanced ipa. softly carbonated with a drying, medium-long finish. on it's own i would compare this to great lake's burning river pale ale. i am definitely going to finish these off by mixing it half and half with a 90 minute (phenomenal) to make my own almost-sessionable 75 minute ipa."
"Burps out the nose are great. I see why all the hype -- an excellent specimen (and I'm not a hophead). There is a rough edge or two, otherwise this would be the pinnacle of the style. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for... I could drink plenty of these. Outstanding."
"Drinkability - I find this to be a highly drinkable ale. It is one of the hoppiest flagship ales I have tasted. Balance and drinkability are synonymous in my opinion. This has both a nice bitter quality and is able to be sipped and savored."
"All told, if you like your IPA's VERY intensely hoppy, then you have an excellent brew. Me, I thought it was just a little too much. I can't really imagine this with food -- it would be too offsetting, I think."
"Overall, this is one of the best IPAs available in my area to be sure (just to be fair- Avery, Bridgeport and Lagunitas are the others I consider to be the best 'well-rounded' IPAs in this market [not counting Live Oak Liberation which beats them all but is only available on tap here locally]), but Dogfish is not one of my daily drinkers."
"10k gold in color, the DFH 60 is lighter in color than you might expect, but does no fall short on flavor. Evergreen and pine dominate the nose with adequate malting making for an enjoyable brew. This IPA is well bittered and has a nose that exudes good hop character; not as flamboyant as say ""The Finest Kind"" but well tuned and finely delineated. A crisp, lean, and less flabby IPA that ensures real hop laden refreshment to those who need it and deserve it."
"What strikes me as fantastic about this beer is there is a great drinkability and blance that makes it easy to drink more than one, light enough on the alcohol to be refreshing, and it pairs really well with all types of food; chicken wings are a great pairing. Did I say refreshing? the bitterness of the hops makes its super nice; and the flavor of the hops, in my opinion , says that every little nuance is intentional. I have tried countless IPA's, and although some pride themselves on being more bitter or being ""imperially"" heavier in Alcohol, this IPA is effortlessly perfect, no gimmick- its only a noth above its higher ABV 90 minute brother, and only when you want to have more than one or pair it; if you only had one IPA ever to drink, go for the 90 minute sipper, its a trip."
"Wow! Superb beer.Pours with a nice large, textured, foamy head and lots of lace. Very fresh. Perfect interplay between the hops and malt. The freshness of the perfectly chosen hops to match these malts is the key. Swear to god. Bit of pine, tart fruit, very satsifying. Ultimate session beer. One sip must lead to another. Homer simpson beer - gladly kill everyone in the bar for another sweet drop of this beer."
"Same clear and nice sunshine yellow, topped by a foamy (but small) lacey white head. And nice pine and citrus in the aroma, which, not surprising, move into the quaff as a duck moves on top of a june bug. Medium bodied, crisp and dry finish, an easy drinker  very nice on tap at a decent price"
"Overall, this tastes like an IPA. Nothing spectacular, but it's a darn fine brew. I'll have to pay more attention to the labeling... gotta try the 90-minute IPA, too!"
"12 oz bottle, poured into an english pint glass. Pours a clear tan/brown with a thick creamy head that settles well. Smells musty, piney, woody. Tastes of a hop explosion, bitter, piney hops up front, followed by more of the same. Solid mouthfeel, creamy, but not thick. First sip is almost too much carbonation, but within a few minutes it mellows and becomes very well balanced. Very tasty. Not a beer I could sit down and have more than say 2 or 3 of at once, but a definite go to beer for a good flavorful, solid IPA"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful golden color. Small foamy white head. Steady rise of bubbles after poured. Smells faintly of fruit and honey. Just the slightest hint of hop bitterness. It's very well balanced, very flavorful. Easily drinkable, and the most sessionable of DFH IPA series."
"very pale beer with a big white head. smells like hops, tastes like hops. granted, they're good hops -- refreshing -- but there's just not a whole lot more to say. good quality ingredients, it seems, used to a completely unimaginative end. entirely drinkable; entirely uninteresting."
"Bottom line: This is one of my favourite IPAs of all time. I couldn't recommend it more!"
"Tasty offering this Dogfish, as always. Well balanced and not over-the-top. Easy to drink."
"OA, pretty good. A nice, relatively sessionable IPA. No where near as sweet as other DFH IPA/DIPA offerings (big + for me). I'll have to drink more of this. Only drawback is that I am not too wild about the earthy component of the aroma."
"Drinkablilty: a constant in my fridge a nice way to start up a tasting and get your taste buds up or wind down a night. love to see this offering on tap and it seems to be popping up more and more even at the most mundane of places."
"Surprisingly strong alcoholic bite for a 6.0 ABV. Hoppy organic & grain notes are present in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is dry, light and crisp with a BIG biting aftertaste of the finish. IPA-tastic. I'll be having this one again for sure."
"Krikey, these are easy to drink. I will definitely continue to cross the state line to acquire these."
"Pours a pale amber or burnished gold with a thin head. Smell is of fresh herbal,floral hops- very clean. Taste is very round and with a good degree of hop bitterness. There is a fruity, apple like background flavor that supports the bitterness. There is a little sweetness, but the hops are the star here as compared to the malty sweetness found in the 90 and 120 minutes. Almost has a gumball like taste at the finish just before the last hop bitterness kicks in. The mouthfeel is crisp, beautifully balanced and just the right weight. One of my favorite standard ipas, very drinkable."
"My only question is why does this deserve a 88% rating, it deserves a hell of lot more."
"The 60 Minute IPA pours surprisingly well for such an airy beer, developing a sturdy head with an even brassy tone throughout. The smell is light and airy, with strong undertones of citrus. It leaves a solid impression of the flavor yet to come. As promised, the hops are plentiful and are delivered to the palate without reservation. The bold nature of the hops makes for a beer that is a bit single minded in its makeup, but clearly delivers as attended. The citrus undertones carry over into the aftertaste. The beer feels a little high on carbonation as it is going down. Overall, a high quality exhibit of the style."
"Pours clear harvest gold color with no head, very minimal lace. The aroma is almost all hop; a blend of citric grapefruit and more earthy pine on a metallic mineral water background. The grapefruit notes are much more prevalent in the flavor. Quite refreshing with a big juicy hop fruitiness. Some pine tones in the finish, but the hop doesn't overwhelm and the beer remains sweet to the end. Despite the lack of head, the beer is decently carbonated, light, and really quenching. Very drinkable, but rather one-dimensional."
"Drinkability: Good, not a brew to slam but to enjoy and respect to it's fullist beers like this are ment to be enjoyed moderately like any other great brew, I will surely have more of these in the future."
"Unimpressive...can't wait to try the 90 minute."
"Drinkablility- After 2 or 3 of these you want to take it easy. Quite filling and quite rich."
"60 Minute IPA was yellow-orange in color with nice white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was mainly hops with a little malt in the backround. The taste was mainly hops with plenty of bitterness and a long dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall it was a nice IPA."
"Drinkability: I have to try this beer some other time when I am feeling a bit better and I havent eaten in a few hours. It lacks the raw ease of consumption that I wanted it to have."
"Clear orange pour with a thin, bubbly head that sticks a bit to the sides of the glass. Smell is piney hops with a hint of sweet maltiness coming through in the background. Taste is very strong pine hop, but with a nice malt sweetness backing that prevents the hops from being overbearing. Very drinkable with a clean finish. This is a nice IPA with just enough malt to keep balance and prevent from becoming a hop-bomb, though it still has a nice, refreshing pine hop crispness to it."
"Nice dark orange coloured ale. Clear with a small yet nice white bubbly head. Surprised how malty the aroma is, though there is a hop presence of course. Quite balanced actually though the hopping does tend to dominate in the end. Piney flavours mostly.But there is good strong malt body to this. Very nice and smooth on the palte, fairly glides over the tongue. Nice drinkable IPA more on the balanced side. But thats OK"
"and bought several bottles to sample along the way."
"App. - 4.5, Smell - 4.0, Taste - 4.0, Mouth - 3.5, Drink - 4.0"
"Drank very easy, this would be a nice IPA to session on. I believe this keg was about to blow"
"Hold that hammock steady. :)"
"Fresh from the kegerator to my pint glass. Goodness gracious. This is a very clear orange/amber beer. I can see right through it. Clear and clean. Produces a heavy looking two finger head which, over some time, dies down and leaves a nice melted-butter type lace on the sides of the glass. Beautifully fresh aroma of pine and citrus. This beer smells great. Not as strong a bouquet as the 90-Minute, but very pleasant. Tastes great too. Strong notes of pine again with grapefruit and an earthy bitter finish. Possesses a strong lingering aftertaste of piney hoppiness. Lip-smacking good. The mouthfeel holds up well. This could easily be a session beer. You could crack a bottle open after mowing the lawn, or you could serve it next to a nice orange-chicken dish. Would also work well with a smooth cheddar or a tangy blue cheese."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Beer goes down smooth and light. It does feel somewhat thin and insubstantial. More body would definitely be a good thing. Not bad at all though."
"Don't get me wrong -- it's not really bad beer. But it is nothing special either, and it was pricey. But hey, if you love those fluffy little pine cones, then this one is for you. . ."
"Very solid IPA. Looked just a touch darker than most IPA's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The smell is full of hops, very full of hops, and so is the taste. A strong, well balanced hop bitterness, hardly any malt taste, but it's an IPA. Very drinkable, a good beer to have when you want a few and you're not affraid of hop flavor."
"Overall a superb IPA. Sadly, at $13/sixer, this one will not be an everyday. If it were $9 or $10, though, it probably would be. Really a delicious beer for hopheads, and incredibly drinkable."
"One of my favorite IPA's. Pours a brilliant golden orange with a nice, fluffy head. Excellent smell of fresh hops that basically dominates completely. This is one of those IPA's that I just can't get enough of. I try to keep a few of these at all times when I need a hop fix. Crisp hops stunted slightly by malts and the hops come back once again. So damn fresh. Nice, smooth mouthfeel with a light to medium body. One of the more drinkable IPA's that I've had and a definite classic in my book."
"this is a very versatile beer. it is great as a session beer (when i am feeling a little frisky for hops); it is a beer that i often suggest when someone tells me that they want to know what ""hops"" are all about...it is very hop-forward, but not overwhelming; it is also a great starter if you are planning an evening of bigger and hoppier things"
"D - One of the best ""everyday"" IPAs I've had. It's not an assault on your mouth, it's just very, very good. It's got a great balance to it, and you could definitely drink quite a few of these. It's even better on tap if you can find it."
"Part of a series of beers that my brother-in-law had stored in a refrigerator, but gave up due to them moving. This particular beer is at least three years old. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a hazy orange, forming a thick 1 inch head, leaving light lacing along the glass. Very faint aroma, mostly of hops, and a little citrus. The taste is mostly hops, creating a very nice but mild citrus flavor. Not as intense as 90 minute IPA, but still tasty. The mouthfeel is medium, just right for an IPA. Overall, this is a very enjoyable, and easy to drink IPA. Not too much bite, but enough to know that your drinking a quality IPA."
"Overall- since I am a hop fan, I have heard Dogfish Head's name spoken with near reverence, while this is a perfectly fine beer there isn't much that leaps out at me, it is hoppy but one-dimensional, rash instead of smooth, and overly active on the way down. Nothing bad to say about it and I will certainly try it again but this time I am a little underwhelmed."
"Not over-carbonated with just a little creaminess to the texture. Totally drinkable and a definite keeper over the course of an evening. A no-frills take on the IPA from DFH executed deftly."
"I have not tried the 120...YET!"
"Nice, rounded body. Silky smooth on the tongue. Very refreshing, very drinkable."
"D - Overall a very enjoyable beer. Will have again."
"60 Minute IPA gives off aromas very piney and malty at the same time. A slight bit of grapefruit character too. Produces a bright white head, with a clear and copper body. The lacing lasts all the way through. Moderate amount of CO2 action. Nicely full of hops and biscuity flavors. Finishes with a spicyness typical of a good IPA. Feels very frothy and dry."
"Very easy drinking but nothing exciting. It would be a good one for newbies to craft brewed IPAs."
"Simply outstanding. A staple in my fridge from here on out."
"Very drinkable."
"The first sip reveals an average body and very fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is as expected with mild caramel notes briefly up front that give way to the resiny hops fairly quickly. The hops linger long after I swallow. the beer is smooth and clean and makes for an easy drinker. I am able to have several pints in a setting and not get bored. QUite nice brew all around."
"Drink-Ability: This brew is one of my favorite go to beers and I highly recommend it."
"Intense floral and piney aroma of hops, great-smelling IPA. The hops are agressive, floral, citrusy and bitter from start to finish, with just the right balance of malt in between. Pretty classic example of the style, completely successful. Great with the hearty well-made pub fare. 6% ABV is as close to a ""session beer"" as you can find at DFH...luckily you can walk back to most of the motels in town from the brewpub..."
"D- The copious quantity of hops involved in this beer makes it ever so slightly too bitter to really just drink one after another after another. On the other hand, if you're eating and drinking, this stuff is hard not to suck down!"
"Deep golden color with a thin but enduring head. Aromas very citrusy (orange, lemon) along with pine. Initial palate shows some honey sweetness and finishes with a pleasant tart grapefruit/citrus finish. Smooth mouthfeel which added to its overall enjoyment. A solid American IPA."
"One of my favorite IPA's. Pours a copper color with a decent size head. The aroma grabs you right away. Scents of grapefruit and freshly cut grass dominate. Hops hit the tongue immediately with a fruity front and a light spicey finish. Very enjoyable."
"The appearance and taste is excellent. Drinkability is tough here, if you want to knock back a six pack this is not your beer. If you want to sit down and enjoy a couple great beers, then by all means pick it up."
"This is a solid choice for an american IPA. Pours a pleasing golden, wonderful hop aroma is contained in the moderate sized head. The hops are floral and sweet, not like the Imperial IPA from Dogfish, but still very nice. The hops are spicy and crisp, not too tart. A quality malt presence to balance the hops. At six percent it is more sessionable than the 90 Min IPA but still not one to just pound. Try it."
"A ""sessionable"" IPA. Well-balanced with floral, citrusy hops staying ahead of the malt. Not aggressive or outstanding, but a nice, drinkable IPA."
"12oz. bottle pours a clear dark golden color with large white head slow bubbles and leaves spotty lacing around the glass. Smells of floral citrusy hops. Taste full of hops with some flavors of flowers and bitter unsweetened grapefruit also has a wet water like finish that cleans the palate. Mouth feel is light and refreshing. This IPA is very drinkable to me because of the more subtle flavors and the light feel makes it easy to have a few ."
"An amber to light orange color, with a off-white head, about a half inch thick that dissolves away quickly. At first scent a strong malt aroma hits the nose, then at the end a citrusy, piney scent comes in to take over till the end. The starts with the malt, but is soon overtaken by a dominant hop flavor; mostly a citrusy, grapefruit flavor. The hop flavor does linger on the palate for sometime. A medium bodied feel, that stays consistant all the way through each taste. A very good beer with stong flavor and a decent aroma, this would an excellent beer to introduce the IPA style to someone."
"clearly the most acessible of the dogfish head IPAs, this beer is a sterling example fo the style. can't wait to try ones with higher minutes."
"The Dogfish Head IPA pours a brilliant pale gold color with a large white head. The smell is certainly an enticing mix of floral (rose), hops and citrus fruit (grapefruit). It is a medium bodied beer with medium-high carbonation. The taste is a balance between pale malt and hop bitterness, with the hops clearly dominating. The finish is crisp with a lingering bitterness to remind you that you're drinking an IPA. A very pleasant beer that, as an IPA lover, I believe is one of the most enjoyable American IPAs on the market."
"Drinkability: Sessionable as hell."
"When the beer warms, taste is even more rounded and more balanced."
"First taste is a high red grapefruit zest but not overwhelming. When it hits the tip of the tongue and back of throat it has a bite to it and this beer keeps you smacking your lips for more. I can't gather what I taste other than a spicy peppery taste. This beer is very drinkable and after a few sips the spiciness goes away which isn't bad or good."
"Drinkability is fantastic, you probably want to sip it, but you don't want to stop either."
"A very drinkable beer that I would like to see available closer to home for me."
"Drinkability: It was good but I couldn't have it very often. The grapefruit notes would bring me back again."
"Super smooth, one of the best American IPAs I've ever tasted. ABV is low enough to enjoy a few of, so go right ahead!"
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer, easily quaffed. It's hard to think of many beers that are easier to drink, but also have something interesting about them. Comparable brews in style obviously include 2-hearted and Alpha-King. It's hard to go wrong with any of them."
"A soft hint of herbs and spice makes this brew finish well. This ipa was more mellow than I expected sorta like Bridgeport ipa. Great session ipa for any hophead."
"Beer appears to be somewhat drinkable...I could have 2-3 of these."
"I got this 23 oz. on-tap at Malones in Lexington, Va. It poured a nice light golden color with about two fingers of head. There was average lacing and good to fast retention. The smell was a good IPA smell and the taste wa a great IPA taste. The mouthfeel was a little stiff, but still super. An all around great beer."
"A very refreshing beer and drinkable as well. Not the best IPA i've tasted but a good one to try. A litte more maltiness would have been nice."
"Bottle courtesy of MuenchenerKindl."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, medium white head forms, settles pretty fast to a thin layer, some lace spots. Smell is malty, pine and floral, citrus hops, toffee, pleasant aroma. Taste is sweet and malty, fruits and caramel, some pine and citrus hops, little bit of floral, some alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Okay, but nothing special."
"Overall, a great tasting IPA, but falls just a bit short on taste complexity and palate to impress."
"As one could expect, it tastes like a toned down 90 minute. Another fine brew from DFH regardless."
"Poured this example from DFH into a tumbler. Golden color like apple juice with lively carbonation at first that fizzles out and takes the head with it leaving a thin ring around the edge. Smells up front of piney, citrusy hops and some roasty/toasty malts. Taste follows the nose with resiny grapefruit and what seems to me to be roasted malts. Lingering hop bite from this one. Mouthfeel was on lighter side but when kept in mouth for tasting was almost creamy. Drinkability was decent and a serious IPA for someone like me just coming around to this style. TONS mellower than Arrogant Bastard."
"Extremely drinkable."
"High flavor-to-weight ratio. I could see myself drinking this one regularly."
"maybe it's the name influencing me, but the smell and the taste reminded me of fish food at first blow. What followed was an extremely involved interlacing of flavours and textures. This beer demands that your palette spends some time with it and yet is not a poncy beer. This is a rubki's cube of flavour. Not a beer for the masses but not a superficial hollow trend chasing brew either. I can't fairly give a fair review of this one based on one bottle. I guess that is a review in and of itself."
"Yellow translucent body with thin offwhite head. Smells rather malty, caramel malty. Flavor is equally malty and hoppy. Caramelized malt initially, and hops sets in toward the finish. Medium bodied. Extremely tasty, and very well-balanced. Probably the best IPA I've ever had."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite session type beers. Not overpowering for those who are not hop-inclined, but still will make those who are happy."
"another tasting notes: mettalic taste still there but not as bad as before, I updated my ratings."
"D - This is a perfectly formulated, expertly executed American IPA. One of my go-to beers, now."
"Drinkability was very good, as this beer went down quite easily and would be a perfect match with a variety of foods. Furthermore, the alcohol was hardly noticeable in the taste but definitely managed to catch up with me by the beer's end."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Instant and reactive... the sizzling yet wonderfully restrained carbonation is just right for the bold, balls the the wall hop profile. This one really leaves its mark, even minutes after the swallow... this quells tonight's hop fix with finesse."
"Beautiful copper color with giant white cloud head. Sweet malty aroma that was spiced with hops. Flavor was rich, earthy malt with hops coming in at the middle and finished with a pleasant bitterness. Very balanced flavor without being too heavy. An excellent ale, I'm not sure it's a IPA but it is very tasty nonetheless. Drinkability is second to none."
"D: What else can I say that's good about this brew? I honestly can't think of anything not good to say about it. Honestly, I'm normally not a strong IPA drinker (yeah, go ahead, send me an e-mail telling me I'm a whimp), but this one was just awesome. They say in life ""it's the little things that make you happy"". As I stated above, it's the slight hint of malt that brilliantly blends with the hop flavors of this IPA to make a nearly perfect brew."
"Dvery good. A solid IPA that is worth going to again and again."
"This is the Dogfish Head flagship beer and a delicious one at that. It's has a biscuit-like hop character that separates it from the monsters made on the West Coast. This is distinctly East Coast and one of the best examples of it. The hops are mellowed out by a nutty backbone, but they are definitely present and quite sweet. Smooth tasting and quite drinkable."
"D- a very drinkable IPA, goes down very easily, tastes much better on tap, one of my personal faves on tap actually, an excellent session IPA if not for the price, dogfish head doesn't come cheaply in Az, would buy/drink/recomend any day"
"aftertaste is clean and fresh making this drinkable and sessionable."
"Very nice. Does not fit in with hop-crazed IPAs, standing out in a good way. Easy to see where the artfully balanced 90 Minute IPA comes from. Good stuff to keep on hand."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but perhaps a little overcarbonated. That could be the fault of the bar, though. Quite a drinkable IPA."
"Well, at first, I was not too impressed. I got a 6-pack of this for 10 bucks, and split it with a friend. The appearance was good. A nice clear, sort of dark amber, with a decent head. There was a hoppy aftertaste, which I did not dig at first, but the flavor was good. It was a little better when I just drank it down, than when I tried to taste it, if you know what I mean. The last couple of the 6 were better, but for 10 bucks, I have too many beers to try to go back and get more of this one right away."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a gold/orange color with a large white head. It smells like grassy and pine hops. The taste is mainly sweet malt and floral hops, with a hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium and slick, however I think it's a bit too carbonated for me. With that being said, the drinkability is good as this beer is smooth and goes down easy. It seems more like a regular pale ale than an IPA. It's still good, however I like the 90 Minute IPA better. But this is still a pretty drinkable beer."
"Sampled from a six gallon keg- on tap. One of the finest plain drinking beers I've had, but lacking in the depth or chewiness that I look for in an IPA, reminds me of Anchor Liberty. Great hop nose, breat hop after taste, with a little bit of body and that is pretty much it. A very good, but not great beer. Give me a Smuttynose or Ramstein IPA. Problem is I expected more."
"Cheers to you DFH!"
"d - this is a great beer and i could have another and another and..."
"Very drinkable. I put away a couple with a good cigar during tonight's Mets game."
"One of the smoothest beers in the arsenal. It is thick, but goes down the gullet like gangbusters. If you like hops, but don't like the bitter aftertaste, this is one you can order with confidence. Very very drinkable. The DFH guys really know how to do hops."
"Slainte!"
"Obviously not as strong at the 90 Minute, but still a good amount of punch from the hops. This is probably more of an every day style beer compared to the 90 Minute. Recommended."
"D: This tastes nothing, nothing like the 90 Minute. It also tastes nothing like an IPA, eschewing hop character for roasted malt flavors. It's strange, and although I liked it, I can't really give it high marks due to its bizarre derivations from its stated style."
"Pours a burnished golden amber with a tiny but sticky head. Very clear body -- this bottle is of the newer, unfiltered version of this ale. Great nose to this beer. Big, vibrant hops that contain citric acid and resin elements backed with some mint and caramel malts. On the palate, brash bitterness up front, with sweet malts coming through at the mid palate. The finish is very long, as chunky, dirty hops flavors sizzle on the tongue for a good thirty to sixty seconds between sips. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with sharp hop bitterness that braces the tongue. Not for the faint hearted. All in all, this is an utterly excellent IPA, close to perfect for the style. To my mind, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute outpaces the 90 Minute in its enjoyability, sessionability, and strength relative to style. Awesome."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Poured into tumbler, decent head, dissipates at medium speed and lingers on top. The foam left thin, but happy lacing. The color is a nice, orangey coppery amber. Smells almost buttery for some reason, this is most likely just my freak palate at the moment. There is some nice toffee, medium aromatic hops, a tinge of hay, fruit and some alcohol. Taste is crisp and clean, not dry like an English IPA. The bitter hops hit perfectly, and dissipate with out killing you (not that killing you with hops is ever bad), I get some sweetness, with toffee or chocolate at times, all is extremely well balance though. This for a long time has been one of my favorite staple IPAs simply because it wont kick you're ass with high ABV or its crazy hops, but you can drink so many and feel happy. This is not an IPA that will thrill you, but it will definitely please you. Honestly its worth keeping around, thanks again Dogfish head."
"What can I say about any Dogfish Head beer? It is a great beer just like all of the other one. I drank this from a bottle that someone gave to me. The beer is 6.0% and it is an IPA, even though it doesn't taste like a normal IPA. It is a nice weak beer that someone can drink a lot of, thus it is an easy beer to drink. I recommend drinking this beer and all of the Dogfish Head Beers."
"Highly drinkable because the hops aren't as overbearing as in some (especially after a couple). This doesn't destroy your taste buds. Seems like a perfect session beer."
"This is definetly my favorite IPA from Dogfish. I like it much better than the 90. Pours a dark-yellow color with very little head. not overly hoppy so it doesnt kill your mouth for other beers. A very drinkable 6% and you really cant taste any alcohol whatsoever. Could definetly sit down and to a session of these as apposed to the others from Dogfish."
"pours a light golden honey color with very little head. Nose is of sweet malt, some floral hops and alcohol. Strong floral hop taste in the flavor but it balanced out well with the malt sweetness. The alcohol is not as evident as I expected give the high ABV. Very smooth with a dry finish and a nice lingering bitter hop aftertaste. I think the high alcohol content will keep this from being a session beer, but I could definitely have another."
"Poured into a pint glass, very straw yellow in appearance with a white head that when drank quickly will stay the entire drink. Smell is very hoppy with that citrus flair that we love from DFH. Taste is amazing same just a slight bit weaker and softer than its big brother, goes down very smooth. Has that hop bitterness as well. I enjoy drinking this fine creation from DFH highly recommend."
"This style is usually a bit too hoppy for me, but after about half a glass - I was really enjoying it. Not sweet at all, very dry and hoppy. Bitter yes, but probably appropriate for this style. Definitely good with meat."
"This was my first taste of Dogfish Head, but it certainly won't be the last. A: A medium gold with a thin head and light lacing. S: Strong and pleasing hoppiness with a crisp finish on the nose. T: Very clean mildly malted start with a slight alcohol kick and hops galore to finish. It results in an unbelievably balanced clean finish with min to no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to med with proper coverage and body. D: Extremely drinkable but with 6% ABV prolonged sessions could be very pleasing/dangerous. I sampled a cask IPA @ Boscos brewpub in Nashville recently that is almost identical to 60 min. I am very impressed as IPAs are not my usual bag, but this one is just perfectly balanced."
"I love DFH beers, but this seems to be missing a good blend of hops throughout the taste that I have seen in other beers."
"DA: Not as Potent in the ABV department as some other DFH offerings, but very true to the style and one fine IPA. Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: I tried the xx minute beers in descending order, and each one had their own virtues and were a good represetative of their respective style. This fits the IPA mold, and is very good vs. the style."
"A good session beer that seems to be popping up all over. Always great when you're at a place that has only macro's, SamAdams, and oh yeah dogfish!! I prefer the 60 to the 90 for sessions, but the 90 to the 60 for an after dinner snack."
"Very easy drinking beer, a great treat for the end of the work day."
"This I think is Dogfish Heads best flagship beer because of its drinkabiity and how well ballanced it is. This beer looks like how many beers do, yellow in color, very clear, nice creamy white head and perfect carbonation were you see little bubbles rising from time to time. The aroma for this beer is just full of hops and is very floral. As for the taste there is a nice clean malt taste followed by a mild bitterness plenty of flavoring hops to make you smile. If im ever stuck on an IPA or just want something to sit back and enjoy this is my number one pic."
"Pours a light golden with a short-lasting head...smells grassy and hoppy with some lemon lingering in the background. I was expecting a similar taste to the 90 minute IPA, and it resembles that...but not as well-balanced. There's a hoppy kick, but it borders being a little too bitter for my taste. The 90 minute is by far supreme, but this is a nice choice if none is available."
"The 90 minutes seems more balanced with malt sweetness when compared to the 60. In my opinion the 60 has much more of a bitter bite to it."
"But actually 60min has a lot going for it. Appearance is it's weakest attribute, due to clear and pissy yellow color (although the head was poofy which is nice). The smell and taste are really good, more malty than you see from most IPA's. Nice and thick mouthfeel, this came through as a strongly above average and well balanced IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Excellent Beer. No conditioning sting. Yellow with orange tinge (reflected color.) Foaming head quickly dissapating. Somewhat pine aroma. Dry smoked oak flavor. Wonderfully hopped, beautifully bitter! This is how beer SHOULD taste! I cannot wait to get my hands on the other higly hopped IPAs..."
"*I must give thanks to my mother for bringing this back from Florida for me, as DFH is not distributed in Ga. as of my writing this review. Thanks, mom!"
"Overall a very drinkable AIPA. Very sessionable."
"I have found my new favorite IPA!"
" Overall, a solid, sessionable IPA although I'm still looking for a trademark product from Dogfish Head to go gaga over but haven't found it."
"Mouthfeel+ drinkability: Very crisp. I could drink this beer all night. VERY VERY sessionable. Won't destroy the palate for changes to lighter styles."
"My favorite beer style is definetly IPA and I found the 60 Minute IPA a tad overrated. The pour had a lot of head and the lacing was VERY sticky after the head coming down to one finger thickness. I'm not sure this is a good thing. After warming up I tasted more syrup'y citrus than the hops that I really like. I couldn't taste much malt or caramel like the other reviews. The 'born on date' was in April so I guess this was in the light too much or something. Maybe I need to try a bottle of the 90 to get the real deal IPA from Dogfish."
"D - Sam and Bryan....they are masters in my book of drinkable beers."
" All in all, it's not a bad ale but the only spectacular thing is the price"
"Pours an orange-brown color with a small head. Lots of hops smell. The taste is crisp and hoppy with some bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I had this on a hot day and it was refreshing and went down smooth. A decent beer to have on hand."
"D-Loved it! I will pick up more,I wanna try the 90 minute ipa Dogfish offers.I wonder what the difference is.I would love to find this on tap, I reccomend to anyone who drools over ipa's.Very good Dogfish!"
"I feel like this brew is lacking for an IPA. It pours a light orange/copper color. Thin off white head. Smells citrusy hops. Maybe some grapefruit and orange? Taste is kind of weak. It's not as full on as I was expecting and will keep on expecting out of a IPA. Not to bitter. Has a lighter citrus hop flavor. The aftertaste is a light bitter but not near strong. I feel like this could be a Pale Ale. Its right on the edge between a IPA and a PA. Overall good brew but is lacking for me. It does go down very easy though."
"Pours a golden amber with a nice thick head and good lacing. Almost as tasty as it's big brother the 90 min but it just doesn't quite do as well for a couple of reasons. First is the lower alcohol content...everyone wants more bang for their buck right? Second is the decrease in hop flavor...this one is just a little more watered down but overall I could drink this one more regularly because a more affordable price."
"Slàinte!"
"This is a delicious beer and a great example of what this style can be. It's often in my fridge, and yet somehow this is the first time I have reviewed it."
"Poured into a pint glass, beer has a nice head with lacing that loves to hang around. In appearance - clear golden colored brew, beautiful. It has a citrusy hop smell, with a taste to follow that actually has more of a malty taste than I would normally expect in an IPA. Medium body, with a creamy head. Overall, a good beer, very drinkable indeed. I would recommend trying this beer."
"Pours an orangey amber color with sticky white head that stuck all over the glass for the entire duration of the drink. Aroma is sweet malt and floral hops. Taste is delicious! Taste starts out sweet giving way to a nice bite from the hops. The sweet almost doughey malt does stand up well next to the hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy that just makes the mouth drool. Overall, this is an excellent brew. DFH did a superb job on this one!"
"This pours a very pale straw color, with a 1/4 inch white head that fades quickly, leaving a small amount of lace on the glass.The smell is of piney hops. The taste has elements of piney and citrussy hops, with a mild sweet malt backing, The hops are rightly dominant, but not overpoweringly so. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. I would love to taste this on tap sometime. Nice one!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, sessionable, but expensive."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Big head that was foamy and airy. The color is lighter than I remember on tap. It is deep golden with nice carbonation. The aroma is floral, citrusy, and faintly honey sweet. The taste is much the same, but the hops jump in the front, middle, and end. This will dull your taste buds after 1 or 2. As a hophead this is what you look for in an IPA! The hop bitterness is almost overpowering. The mouth is dulled from all of the assualt. I do have to say that the limit is three is an evening for me."
"Drinkability is top shelf, DFH nailed this one. MK"
" FEAR NOT THE HOPS!"
"It's smooth, well carbonated and very drinkable. Worth a try, as a great introduction to the style. Might let you down if you are a big hophead!"
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer, with great use of floral hops and just the right amount of bitterness. Nice malts carry the whole beer well. Will definitely drink this a whole lot more over the summer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a golden-orange, with thin off-white head and great lacing. Aroma was not real pronounced, but a very pleasant mix of citrus and floral. Taste was a continuation of this floral and citrus, but what I noticed immediatley was the dominance of the alcohol. While only 6%, this hit me from the initial sip, and carried on thru the entire glass. The finish is bitter, yet smooth, but most of all leaves a warming sensation from the alcohol. In addition to the 60 minute, I also have the 90- and 120- minute, and cant wait to try those when the time is right. This was my first DFH, and I am truly pleased."
"I believe this bottle is past it's prime, but is still good. Nothing compared to the fresh casks, that is when this beer really shines. I'd think it was alot better if I wasn't so spoiled on IPA's!!! Cheers"
"It has an appearance like beer. It smells nice, light citris. Taste is slight rough, but decent. Seems to have 2 kinds of hops, if that makes sense. One of the I like and the other I do not. No malt, which makes this pale in comparison to the 90 MIPA. Decent beer but nothing special. Mouthfeel is creamy, actually nice. Drinkability is so-so. It's never the beer I'm looking forward to."
"Bar pour on tap into a cold glass. Dark yellow with no bubbles beneath a 1-finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin sheet and good lacing. Noble? hops on the nose and sweet malt along with a light fruity smellpeaches or apricot. Taste is moderate hops up front, light malt, an apple juice or tea flavor. Finishes on a malty, moderately bitter hops flavor. Mouth is slightly creamy, full bodied without bubbles. Drinkability is very good. Id definitely recommend this excellent IPA."
"This is a drinkable beer. It lacks some of the fruity esters and citrus flavors of other IPAs, but a very drinkable beer and good representation of the style."
"Deep gold color with an almost amber hue. Has a nice thick white head that is initially a 1/2"" and tapers down down to a coating that lasts until the end. Smells strongly of hops but there are also hints of citrus. Not overwhelming. Very nice. Taste is of hops and maltiness. Finishes bitter. Nice mouthfeel, goes down easy and has a good amount of carbonation. A great IPA and an excellent session beer. If you like hops this is for you."
"Part of a Boombox case I bought recently for a concert tailgate. The 60 minute poured a golden color with a thick white head that runs away rather quickly and leaves behind a nice ring around the glass and solid lacing. The aroma is trademark DFH, a bouquet of hops with a touch of sweetness at the end. The taste is more of the same with a citrusy hop kick that runs through the mouth and pleases. There is also a strong malt character that balances this beer out well and helps to make this a very drinkable beer."
"D: Well I am in love with this IPA. I haven't had anything else out there quite like it, and it is something I can see myself drinking very often. I think this beer will have something for both the hopheads and the maltheads. This was my first beer by Dogfish Head and I'd definatly love to try more."
"Purchased in bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. IPAs are growing on me more and more, ever since I tried Two Brothers Heavy-Handed IPA. I recall that one being quite good, but I could drink DFH 60 Minute all day. I naturally expected strong piney/citrus flavors and more bitterness than I am used to in a beer, but it was all done very well. The aroma is mostly hops, of course. The bitterness that I expected to taste however, is prevalent, but suits the beer so well you dont even mind. The mouthfeel is more solid than I had anticipated, lending a feeling that you are really drinking a fine brew. This is so good, I am going to search out the next step (90 Minute)."
"Overall, a great IPA. If you want strong hops, this is the beer for you. A friend recommended it to me, and I'll be thanking him profusely later. This is a beer to be cherished and enjoyed."
"Dammit. It's happening to me. I tried to resist. But I am weak and the power is just too strong...I am turning into a hop-head. Is this the greatest beer on the market or what? It pours an (IPA) perfect, creamy head that lasts all the way down. Lacing to the bottom of the mug. THE SMELL: of course, hoppy. with some wonderful malt thrown in. some sweetness from burnt sugar (carmel?) and a hint of chocolate. a little citrus fruitiness, maybe some orange peel. Man....oh man. I love this brew. HOPSSS. HOPS. Dig the hops. I am not worthy..."
"This is an excellent american IPA. Pored from a 12 oz. bottle into a slightly chilled pint glass. Slightly cloudy appearance with heavy carbonation. Very pleasant smell of light hops. Wonderful crisp taste with a perfect amount of bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, very crisp and delicate. Highly drinkable, not strong or overpowering. A great everyday IPA."
"Not a favorite. I look forward to trying the 90 and 120 Minutes that I have purchased."
"Perfectly balanced mouthfeel. Grapefruit, with somewhat resiny hops, other citrus flavors, with a piney finish. Malt component balances bery nicely, with a good carbonated mouthfeel. Great session IPA."
"This is an excellent IPA. I poured it from the bottle into a pint glass and was pleased with the nice golden-amber color. Finger-thick head with nice lacing. Smell is really hoppy, with a hint of sweetness. Taste is absolutely perfect. You can definately taste the hops but it is not over powering. The balance of this beer is what makes it so good....not too hoppy but still plenty of flavor. Nice mouthfeel...again it is perfectly balanced, not too thick but not watery like some other IPAs out there. I can't say enough good things about this beer...I almost prefer it to the 90 minute IPA which has a much stronger flavor (the 90 minute is an excellent beer don't get me wrong, i just think it's too much for a pale ale) This is a great beer to get your bud light buddies off of the watered down stuff...."
"Taste is wonderfully hoppy yet balanced quite well by a good malt body. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is about as good as it goes for me. This beer is wonderful."
"Unfortunately this beer pales in comparison to the 90 minute IPA. However, it is still a solid drinkable beer. It is not as hoppy as some other IPAs and has no sweet aftertaste. However it is very smooth and drinkable and the 6% alcohol content alllows you to have a few on a hot summer day."
"This is a very good IPA. The copious hop bitterness is balanced by a sweetness that is not the least bit sticky. I like the way the grapefruit taste mixes with sweet taste of apricots and oranges. Very well-balanced, this beer is very nicely done."
"Medium amber in colour with average carbonation. The aromas are quite well balanced between the light crystal malts, and the citrus-spice element of the hops. Full in the mouth, with the malt (both crystal and a bit of toasted) leading the way. The hops were there in abundance, but not so much as to overwhelm things. A very classy and refined IPA, although not overly complex."
"My first of the 60, 90 and 120 IPA's of Dog Fish Head ... pours a medium yellow gold color with a slight cloudiness. Thin true white head with moderate size and retention. Nose is of hops, citrus, and a surprising amount of malt. The malt and hops are more in balance in the nose than I'd think for an IPA, though this is an American style. Palate is balanced as well, with the warm malts fighting for dominance over the pungeant, piney hops. A nice battle to host. Some citrus flavors linger and the beer finishes dry. Not thick in the mouth, but definitely a medium body. Adequate carbonation. Over all, I like this American IPA. Perhaps a touch malt dominant for me, but very drinkable none the less. Now, I'll need to sample the 90 and 120 varieties."
"So I've had a few of these and I think I've had a good chance to look at the beer from as many points of view as possible. To me this beer seems like the IPA fir stout lovers. The color is clear and amber with an off-white frothy head that lasts throughout the entire experience. Aroma is weak. Most IPAs have an aroma that just jumps at you, but with this you really have to look for it. What is there is a mix of hops and possibly roasted malt. The flavor follows this trend. For being an IPA, this just isn't cutting it for me in the hops department. I always thought dogfish head was a highly hopped brew, but the 60 minute just aint it. But I'm not going to rate it down just because it's not what I thought it was. The flavor starts with a mild hoppiness, and quickly is overtaken by what I percieved to be roasted malt. This is a very creative take on the IPA, but to me it is such an extreme changed that it doesn't really taste like an IPA anymore. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is decent. It's a tasty brew, but I don't think I would buy this again because it isn't as hoppy as I hoped it to be. Overall I think it's a tasty brew that tried to do something new. It pushed the boundries of IPA deeper into the malt direction (not the direction I want to see it go) but it is respectable for the brewer to brew what he thinks is best. In the end, I think this is a good brew. Don't go out looking for it, but if it's there sitting in the cooler, and you want something new, go for it."
"Drinkability: A great session beer, but if you're having it with other beers you should place this one towards the end of your session. Probably too bitter for most foods, but it would match well with spicy Thai or Indian or even Italian food."
"I was skeptical getting this instead of 90 Min DFH IPA. However, as part of BA, you just have to try them all. After crazy high expectations, this drink passed and then some. Definitely check 60 Min out."
"This full bodied ale presents a very cool looking orange hue. A light amber but certainly orange hued. Didn't pour with a great head, but that may be a result of the glass I am forced to use (more of a water/drinking glass). Aroma is a nice caramel, toasted malt with a slight American hop pineyness. Flavor is rich malt caramel, slightly toasted specialty malts, with a good amount of hop bitterness. The biggest flaw in this beer as I see it is that it feels thick in your mouth. Not really a summer beer because it is so heavy."
"Always a welcomed beer in my home."
"D - Entirely drinkable and extremely well balanced."
"A very good IPA that isn't available in Minnesota but luckily is usually around across the river in Wisconsin. A nice treat but a step down from the 90 Minute."
"flavor lacks complexity or presence. generically bitter with a weak, aspirin-like finish. light-medium body with a medium-high carbonation. very drinkable if uninterestingly so."
"I know the 90 minute is good but I prefer the 60."
"Beer poured a nice clear dark yellow... almost amber color. had a very nice head that kept a ring and laced well. had a decent smell. not too hoppy. kinda bitter smell. smelt like a good IPA. As for the taste. its a good example of its style I think. You can taste the hops a lot more than you can smell em. In fact, thats mostly what you can taste... and thats a good thing. Has a slight bitter after taste, but not excessive. has a nice mouth feel. perfect carbonation which helps spread the flovour. Could easily drink several of these in a row. one of my favourite IPAs I've tried so far."
" -drinkability: as stated above, I could only get through a couple of these before moving on to something not quite as intensely hopped. I will definitely have more of DFH 60 Minute."
"Quite simply, a great session IPA. Looks great: burnt orange with a sticky cream head. Smells great: sweet, creamy malt overpowered with fresh hops. Tastes great: Mmm. Awesome malt that was kicked in the butt with hops. Easy in the mouth and a treat to drink."
"Overall a great beer and the best beer I have haed out of a bottle. Only bummer is that it is not easily found in california, but that's what UPS is for. If you see this, try it you won't be dissappointed."
"Fruity hoppy smooth flavors, followed by a fresh hints of fruity esters, followed by a smooth caramel finish with a tints of spices"
"This is my go-to IPA when I can find it."
"Very intense hop aroma, somewhat of a citrusy smell. The appearance is a moderately to medium gold in color, high hop flavor is evident with citrusy overtones. Definate medium/high hop bitterness, but does not linger with aftertaste. Moderate to high carbonation with a medium tan color head that dissapates when drinking. A full bodied tasting beer, one of my favorites, will continue to drink this one."
"the beer pours a golden orange with the slightest hint of amber. The head is one shade off from bone white. This head sticks around well and laces nicely down the glass. There is a nice sweetness from the malts in the aroma but hops dominate with smells of lemon and grapefruit. The taste is also good. This beer comes out swinging with its punch of hop flavors. There is some lingering sweetness from the malts in the finish but this beer could do with a little more balance. It just doesnt accomplish that delicate balance that the great IPAs do like Victory's Hop Devil. The mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation and a good body. Overall extreamly highly drinkable. One of the best IPAs out there. Another beer I wish we had in SC."
"Pours a lively amber-orange color with a white foam head, and notable carbonation. Surprisingly clear, looks breathtaking. Smell is intense--did I mention it smells delicious? Taste is clean, first pale, then sweet, then an inoffensive juicy hop explosion. Notably less grapefruity than 90 minute, but not as different and tame in comparison from the 90 minute as I originally recall. This beer is similarly insane, and is nearly balanced for an IPA--even closer to this amazing achievement than the 90 minute. It starts malty and finishes hoppy, but the two transition so perfectly... The hops don't linger all that long, and leave no bitter aftertaste, which is delightful. Mouthfeel is heavy, and not over carbonated. Perfect for the style. Very drinkable for style. I stock this on occasion, but of note, I find it nearly impossible to find anything to drink this along side of. Wings and IPAs/hops are a good combination, but this bad boy is extremely floral, which tends to clash with 'IPA"" kind of foods on my palate."
"I enjoyed this one with Julia and a few other friends. Thanks Jules!"
"d - definately a great summer brew. not my favorite ipa, but definately better than most."
"drinkability - good but not great, this one has a more bitter aftertaste than i would like, it really lingers. i dont mind having these after ive already been drinking but starting off with one isnt that great imo. compared to all the ipa's ive had i would rank this one as average."
"This is a great session brew for to get you through those hot summer days. Flavor is more green than expected, but still smooth and creamy."
"This isn't my favorite IPA, I'm more partial to HopDevil and Stone IPA, but this is an excellent go-to beer with broad appeal, and is at the very least worth trying."
"D: Definitely a go-to beer, this one is sure to please in any situation. Smooth flavor and texture make this a fantastic session beer."
"D - high, smooth enough for those who aren't bitter lovers"
"Drinkability- great IPA with balance of flavor and hops"
"CheersBeers"
"**EDIT: My perception of this beer has changed the more craft brews I have tried, and while still a very good IPA it's not in my top tier any longer."
"Like all DFH stuff, this one comes off on the sweeter side. Feels big, with copious sweetness balanced against aggressive hoppiness. Nice enough, worth a six pack purchase every now and again."
"This used to be my favorite IPA. It's different now (since no longer being bottle conditioned) and I don't like it quite as much. The flavor isn't as smooth, deep and balanced -- it's harsher now. Still, it's a good, dependable beer. Tasty with dubliner cheddar."
"Much cleaner than the 90 minute, and more balanced. While I do love the 90, this would be a much more drinkable alternative if I planned on downing more than 1 or 2."
"Overall, a good beer. I'll have to let the rest stay in the fridge for a couple hours."
"Grapefruity flavors wrapped in a velvety smooth malt body. a little spice in there as well. Tasty."
"I really like this beer. Not as great as the 90 min., but much more of a regular IPA option. Give me a sixer of this for the night and I'm pretty happy, if not pretty tipsy."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable. The complexity and balance on the palate are quite pleasant and the drying finish leaves me wanting more--in only the best way."
"This is a pretty hoppy beer, but still very drinkable and so nicely balanced and not too strong so that you can definitely enjoy a couple."
"This is a good go-to IPA if you're not up for the more intense offerings out there. Strong balance of hops with the other elements. Super-quaffable, super-sessionable. Another great offering from the wizards at D.H."
"This ale is a very well balanced, well rounded out, easy drinking and satisfying IPA. This should be the new standard...and a standard ale on the local LCBO shelves."
"D: Awesome. I could session this... but then I'd probably regret it."
"D - Nice. I like it. Quite ""full flavoured"" but not overly bitter. Good sessionable beer."
"This is a fantastic session beer. Its hoppy enough but also well balanced. My only question is why is it crystal clear if its bottle conditioned? I guess you dont have to get sediment and haze from it."
"Light copper with a creamy head. Fresh herbs, sweet pine, and some sweet orange smells. Initial taste reveals citrus flavor with alittle sweet malt and finishes with a grassy, peppery bitterness. Mouthfeel is right on for the style, medium bodied witha crisp bitterness. Overall an enjoyable ipa."
"Smooth, creamy mouth that adds to the drinkability. All-in-all a well made easy drinker."
"Pours golden amber. Thin head, not much retention. Decent lace.Smell was not strong, but was nicely hoped. Body was light, with a smooth yet carbonated feel. Taste is hoped,but not overly bitter. This is a refreshing, well rounded IPA. I recommend this beer!"
"Overall I would recommend this to my friends and will look for it again myself."
"For a bottle conditioned beer, this is actually quite clear, a golden amber color, with about one inch of head. Floral hops take the lead, obviously, sweet buttery malts in the background. Taste is citric hops, a little oily in taste and mouth. But the hops aren't all that overpowering, with a sweet malt trying not to play second fiddle, and it works very well."
"To the brewers at Dogfish Head: Job well done."
"The pour of this beer is quite nice. An inch of head caps off this autumn hued brew. I smell the dreaded corn-like smell along with a hint of grapefruit. Taste is initially the corn taste I dislike, followed by a mingled pine and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, very nice. Lacing has followed my progress all the way down the glass. To be honest, I don't want another. It's ok. Nothing more. That corn taste just kills the beer for me. In a pinch I suppose I could tolerate it if I wanted some hops. Living out west though, that isn't likely to happen. A good IPA can be found almost everywhere."
"Bitter and tea-like on the taste. Very dry on the palate after swallowing. Big hops and some nice pine. A very good beer."
"Pours a pale copper with a lot of dancing carbonation. Head is a little over 2 fingers thick, with the top spotted with dimples in the foam. Leaves thick stalagtite/stalagmite lacing. Smells of toasted malts, some welcome diacetyl, and a grassy hop profile. Taste is of bready malts and grassy, herbal and citrusy hops. Some faint diacetyl as well. This beer seems a bit cloying overall and a touch grainy. The sweetness doesn't work too well, but some hop bitterness helps to bring it together. Mouthfeel is creamy and moderate in body. Slight oiliness from the hops. Solid drinkability overall, but the sweetness gets to me."
"D- maybe quite shocking to a drinker without prior run ins with intense hop flavors, but easily drinkable IPA. tasty."
"Another good beer from Dogfish head!!!"
"From what I had heard, I was expecting a hoppy beer, and that's what I got. It was a clear orange, nicely carbonated, with a medium white head.. It had a sweet, grainy odor, and a quite hoppy taste. It tasted fairly dry and astringent, but there was a little sweetness to it. A very nice, drinkable beer."
"If you like a hoppy IPA, this is the beer for you."
"A fabulous IPA and would reccomend to anyone who belongs to the HOP HEAD groups of the world! Hail to the Hops!"
"Drinkability : It goes down easy, but not entirely enjoyable. I will avoid this."
"Crisp, light to medium body, and very well balanced. Drinkability is good, and certainly one I could have a few of in a sitting."
"Pint poured at Wonder's Pub in Madison, WI. 60 Minute IPA pours out a partially cloudy orangish color. The aroma is fruity hops, with the malt in the background. There's enough malt flavor to back up the hoppiness, but then again the hoppiness is mild compared to the 90 minute. There's a decent hop flavor in this beer, but it is not especially bitter. The flavor is very fruity, with apricot and apples. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability. A good IPA, but what's the point when 90 minute is just as easy to get?"
"Pours a pale amber/gold with decent clarity. One and a half fingers of dense white head shows decent retention and excellent lacing. Moderate aroma of cascade and toasted amber malt. Mild toasty sweetness with the first sip, followed by a rush of solid bitterness but lacking in hop flavor. Some ghost-like cascade notes in the dry aftertaste, but overall dissapointing for an American IPA. The medium body and light carbonation give it a semi-smooth mouthfeel but it's also kind of boring. The stale finish becomes so dry it boarders on harsh and hurts the drinkability. This would be more interesting if it had a good hop flavor/aroma to go along with the poorly balanced bitterness."
"Does not pack the whallop of the 90 minute, but is still very tasteful. I could see myself sipping this in the summer at the beach."
"I'm not much of a hophead, but occassionally I get the urge. This is a good one to have around for those times."
"It's a very good beer. I'm trying to keep a supply laid in as one of my standbys. Recommended."
"The taste has a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue and screams of more hops. Some citrus is there but isn't very pronounced. It is a bit sharp in the taste and can be a bit much if you don't like hoppy beers. I usually have one or two and move onto something else. Hard to do a session of these. Overall a great beer though"
"Pours a golden amber with a nice 2 finger head that has average retention. Smells wonderful. Huge piney hop aroma. Taste is very flavorful. More of a piney hop flavor than a citrus one. Wonderful hop bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is oily. This is the perfect session IPA."
"A decent IPA. There was a creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. The beer is a light golden color. The smell is very citrus like. The taste is fairly bitter with a lingering hoppy taste. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a good bit of bitterness. The drinkability is good. I could drink these again. Not quite as good as it's big brother 90 minute but a respectable brew nonetheless."
"Here's to a beer that's got tons of potential and may be on its way to getting greater than great. Hopefully they'll continue to tinker with the recipe, and even until then, it's more than worth a try."
"Copper in color with a fairly large and frothy head. Very aromatically hoppy nose, showing the lemony/citrusy Amarillo and the floral Warrior along with a touch of malt, which hints of caramel and biscuits. Hops dominate the flavor providing a very fruity blend of apricot, orange, citrus fruits, lemon and a touch of wheat grass. The malt underneath shows a bit of biscuits and butter toffee, balancing fairly well. An undeniably great India Pale Ale."
"drinkability: i enjoyed this but i took me about 30 minutes to finish a 12 ounce bottle. and about another thirty to scrub off the glass because of all the lace. i will definitely buy this beer again, great for a sunny day"
"60 Minute is copper with plenty of carbonation. The off-white head is very large and fluffy. Aroma is of citrusy hop and an underlying biscuity malt. The overall smell is just a bit underwhelming for an IPA. Taste is of a tangy, citrussy hop, with notes of pineapple. Underlying malt is of caramel and biscuit. The different flavors mix nicely and are complexly layered. Bitterness is moderate. The overall taste of 60 Minute is unlike any IPA I've expirienced, which took about half a bottle to get used to. After I settled in, I found this to be one of the most flavorful and addictive IPAs in recent memory. Highly recommended."
"This is a *very* pleasant version of the style, the best session IPA I have found in the US. Smell and taste are very reminiscent of the B&T mentioned above. This is entirely too easy to drink."
"This one is a regular in my beer fridge and I always really enjoy that first spicy sip."
"The body has a medium feel and good carbonation round out a good beer. Overall this is a good beer for an IPA style. Although I prefer 90 Minute, 60 is still a very good beer."
"Golden amber with giant soapy white lather and sparse but persistent carbonation. How many citrus fruits are there? This one has aromas of all of them -- I'm picking up kumquat, grapefruit, lime and tangerine (piney rind) at the very least. Lacing clumps around the entire glass. All those citrusy hops I smelled are seriously restrained in the taste. Caramelly-toasty malt balance is assertively in effect. Refreshing peach-lemon flavors. Piney tangerine pith finish lingers long after the swallow. Juicy mouthfeel, thin-to-medium body. Quenching! Not the hop bomb I expected, but gaddam if this isn't one super-drinkable brew. From classic to extreme, from Belgian to beefy American, from populist to just plain weird, Dogfish Head's got it all. I'd be their bitch in a heartbeat."
"One the best session beers around, especially for hop heads. Appearance is a typical pale amber and very clear and clean. A nice off white head that sticks around. The hop nose is unbelievable. No matter where I get this on tap it seems they have it fresh from the brewery. Maybe they do since it's so good it probably doesn't sit around long. This beer introduced me to Amarillo hops. I was taken away by the citrusy hop flavor and had to do some research to find out at least one hop they used. The bitterness is not carried away like some IPA's either and it is balanced nicely with a sturdy malt base. Highly recommend!"
"it's a very different animal from the 90 minute. i seem to remember drinking that as kin to experiences i've had with eating grapefruit, but this is decidedly more limited in it citrus character...it's there but certainly not to the extent of the 90. in fact, none of the flavors or aromas are particularly dominant over the other...much better balance"
"Pours an opaque yellow with a fluffy white head. Good retention. Hop and Grapefruit aromas. Crisp bitterness to this beer. Very smooth going down. Very safe IPA for introducing people to the style. Easy to drink many and not become overhopped yourself."
"A lot of complex flavors - worth another."
"Heres to finding good beer in Lancaster PA :) Cheers!"
"Heads up Nicole (unless your under the tent!)"
"Drinkability - very drinkable easy to consume and constantly makes me want another it leaves a particularly delicious aftertaste definitely changed my opinions of IPAs."
"This is a damn fine IPA. Love the taste they imparted with the continous hopping. Not to strong , but definatly hoppy as a beatch."
"Golden, clear, with a frothy white head. Light grapefruit and pine aroma. A decent hop bite, more pine needles than citric grapefruit or lemon, but all are there. Mildly carbonated with a dry finish. Id like to see a little more malt in the mix, it would make for a really good IPA."
"D - I live on the west coast and picked up two 6-packs while I was on a business trip to Texas. I really wish I could find this in California. It really doesn't strike me as an IPA however. It's not as bitter as most of the other IPA's I've tried. Very sessionable. If this were an APA I would say it's outstanding. Even as an IPA it's still a solid beer. I would highly recommend this one if you get the chance. The next time I'm out there I'm trying this on tap and bringing back a case or two."
"Fairly tasty and easy to drink, but I think there are better IPAs out there."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin, but not necessarily a bad thing. A very drinkable IPA."
"A very fine standard IPA. Floral, citrusy, moderately bitter, and not so heavy that you can't keep drinking."
"Drinkability is tops, I crave the DFH 60 minute IPA. Luckily I can find it on tap close to home for about $3.50 a pint."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer pours a nice copper color, with a foamy head that settles quickly, providing spotty lacing. The smell of this brew is mainly hops, very piney also. As for the taste, hops dominate (not such a bad thing)! A little malt presence on the palate, but the hops completely overpower anything else one might detect, and as it warms, hops just become that much more dominant. Great carbonation and a somewhat light body make this beer very drinkable. A bit too hoppy for me, but still a great beer."
"This beer pours a nice orange with a big lingering head. The head really sticks around on this one, and the lacing sticks nicely to the glass. Perfect appearance for an IPA in my opinion. All I can smell is hops, strong pine and citrus. The taste again is all hops, a strong hop flavor, backed up by a nice bitterness. There is a sweet maltiness in the background but it just gets hammered by the hops. I'm not sure I could drink more then a couple of these in a sitting but damn is it a nice IPA."
"Obviously, I'm bummed out. If you like hops even a little, skip this and jump up to the 90 Minute. It's so much better, in my opinion."
"I'd drink this as a session finisher, not more than a couple at a time - it's a good hop fix, and a very respectable IPA."
"I love this IPA! It goes down very smooth. Very pleasant smelling.with a hint of floral. It has a lot of taste but is so easy to drink. It pours with small, thick head and drinks with a beatiful lacing down the side of the glass. If I had to pick one beer to drink the rest of my life, this would be it."
"Mouthfeel- An undeniable hop presence, but yet a good dose of malt as well. The balance of this beer was excellent. The bread dough malts and floral/citric hop bitterness was a great combo."
"An exceptionally good drinker here! Not over the top in bitterness this is just an extremely tasty strong APA to weak AIPA. Loads of spicy hops in not excessive quantities are what make this beer so good."
"D: Goes down very easily and is not very filling. If you get a sixer, you can make it disappear quite quickly. As far as I'm concerned this beer is extremely versatile. I can see myself pounding it away, because of its drinkability and enjoyable taste. I can also see myself enjoying it with a meal because it's not over-powering, but has enough flavor to compliment whatever you're eating. Overall it's a very good beer."
"-UF"
"Pours a nice amber with a thick head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Hints of citrus in the aroma. As expected, hops are in the forefront of the flavor. There is some grapefruit in the after taste and some astringency in there as well. Frankly, it's not bad, but I've had other IPA's that I liked better. That being said, this is quite drinkable and most definitely worth a try."
"Pours a crystal clear copper toned amber color with a thin white head that falls to light white lacing. Aroma is comprised of a blend of citrus, floral and evergreen/pine hops, slightly sweet nose. Smells absolutely outstanding, excellent hoppy aroma, exactly what I expect from an IPA. Taste is also hop-dominated, very fresh hop bitterness accompanies grapefruit and citrus flavors, along with grassy undertones present as well. Taste is very clean and refreshing, very quaffable beer. Light to medium body, lighter end of the carbonation spectrum. Very drinkable, hoppy as you want yet still only 6% abv, would make a nice session IPA. Will definitely seek out again."
"D - highly drinkable IPA. Reminds me a lot of Anchor Liberty Ale. Tastes like a classic American IPA."
"Yum."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here, but a damn good brew still. Body was kind of heavy, but not thick. The hop smell was excellent and enticing. Very drinkable. Top-notch."
"I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes IPAs."
"Exceptionally drinkable. A true ""go to"" beer when you need to refresh and recharge but still want to be able to savor the finer qualities in a good IPA."
"I'd started to get tired to IPAs and after not having one for a while picked up this one from Dogfish Head. Not as sharp a spice as other brews which makes it more drinkable, but being an IPA it is still handicapped in the drinkability catagory. Taste it one of the best I've had which a more mild tang and a clean finish. Smells good too. I like this beer."
"This IPA is worth all of the hype. This might be my favorite to date. Pick this one up if you get the chance."
"Big citrus hop aromal, with basketfulls of grapefruit and lemon. Hearty hoppy flavor with smooth malt undertone. Had a cold one today after playing hooky from work. Lingering bitterness in the mouth. Would love to have several with nachos or spicy queso. Smooth going and easily drinkable."
"Ad alto"
"This beer is not quite what I was expecting, but I dont mean that in a bad way. It is good in many ways and I think that it is an ideal example of an IPA. It is a good one to have aroundbut not for friends. For that price, they can drink the other stuff in the fridge."
"D: I could drink quite a few of these, not the best IPA I've had, but really not bad either."
"I'll try the 90 minute again. This time I'm sure it'll be more to my liking. Hops in the 60 minute are not strong enough!"
"I'd drink it again."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Mmmmm, nice citrus with a great bitter ending, sooo nice. This is very well suited amount of hops I would say. It's easy drinking and smooth, not too much carbonation, simply a treat."
"I'm glad I was able to try it and would drink it again in the future, but it's not going to replace The Two Hearted in my fridge anytime soon."
"D - I will have this again. I like this beer a lot, but here is how it is. One of these beers satisfied me. I could have easily gone and refilled my glass off of my friend's tap, but I chose not to do that. Why? Because I didn't want another beer right away. This is an IPA that is to be savored. It is not good to session because it has so much flavor. So drinkability? Above average."
"Pours with a 1 finger head of off-white foam consisting of loosely packed small bubbles with some moon craters on top. Slowly settles to a short collar leaving some lacing. Soft copper with golden highlights, and only a few lazy carbonation streams. The smell is bright green hops, piney with touches of citrus. The taste is of bold hops in the front, softening in the middle with finishes of malt sweetness, but still packing plenty of hops oil. Medium bodied with modest carbonation, this feels nice. Easily drinkable and sessionable. Not overwhelmingly hoppy so your palate wont be wrecked during the course of a night."
"I really like all of the dogfih head ipa's they all really fit into the american version very nicely. this beer could be enjoyed yearround and in any weather."
"Copper in color, well carbonated, with thick off-white head of even consistency. The aroma is, as one would expect, hoppy, but in a raw, cutting sort of way. The same, alas, is true of the flavor. Hops, hops and more hops (Malt, where are you?) with a highly acidic, grassy, and biting character. I'm a bit of a hop-head, and no fanatic about ""balance," but this beer is a bit out of whack. My second favorite of the series -- better than the 120, but nowhere near as pleasant as the 90."
"M & D: Mouthfeel on this sucker is very nice and smooth with a subtle bitter ending. Very complete beer. Drinkability is very high as its not too hoppy but not to light also. Love Dogfish head all around--Could drink them all day."
"Overall = Like the 90 minute, this is one of the better IPAs in the world. Outstanding drinkablity and taste. I could easily drink this in a session. Very strongly recommended. Right up there with Sierra Neveda's Celebration as my favorite IPA."
"poured it in a pint glass and didn't make much of a head. has a ver reddish color almost mahoganny. smells very malty with some spicyness. taste starts out with the malt then finishes with alot of citrus. i find it to be very similar to SNCA 2005. this is a very drinkable beer."
"This beer came a slightly red honey amber with a thin film of head. Smelled of sour nectarines and a slight caramel malt. Nice simple, yet assertive flavor with a light pasty honey malt and a smooth pineapple dryness. The simplicity of this brew allows the flavors to get along superbly. Mouth feel is medium bodied with light carbonation. This is a nice, straightforward beer. Very drinkable."
"mouthfeel is light and crisp. a little cottony from the hops, but all in all refreshing and very drinkable. I have to add i see this brew in the stores for the same price as harpoon IPA and sam adams and others like this and it is a bargain in comparison. something special for its pricerange."
"Years later, this beer still surprises me when I try it.  This has got to be the best widely available IPA coming off the East Coast."
"One of the better, smoother AIPAs out there. The appearance is nothing unusual for this style with a slightly orange hue and an off-white colored head that doesn't last. Aromas of hops, pairs, and oranges can be detected. The taste is filled with hops that outlast the malt profile, as might be expected for this style. Despite the bitterness, this beer is suprisingly smooth and refreshing with a crisp character closely resembling a pilsener. The beer leaves behind a nice roasted flavor and coats the tongue nicely. The flavor, moderate ABV, and smoothness of this beer allow it to be had multiple times."
"Notes: As my introduction to Dogfish Head, I am certainly intrigued. This is a perfect IPA to sit back and have one to experience a great beer, or just waste the night away with a few friends. Good luck removing this one of my list of favorite IPAs, and beers for that matter."
"Mouthfeel is spot on with just a hint of slickness noted on the rear section of the mouth's roof. Worthy of all of the praise that it has received...this brew is a definite winner!"
"12oz bottle sample, pours a very clear light copper color and makes a tight bubbled, thin white head. Aroma is crisp biscuit malts, light caramel, orange and grapefruit. Moderate peppered bitterness attacks the tastebuds with some pine and citrus fruit, earthy hop character which reminds me of colombus, hint of alcohol in the end. Crisp carbonation, light bodied and finishes dry. This is a rock solid sessionable IPA, I would buy this quite often if it were available in San Diego."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: The muts didn't go for this one, but I sure did."
"Delicious overall. Will take the rest of the six pack one at a time so as to be able to enjoy each bottle individually."
"Overall, a very good beer, and went well with my spicy lunch. Looking forward to trying some of its 'big brother' IPAs from DFH when I can find them!"
"drinkability 	= 5.0"
"Overall a great beer. i wish i could get this as an usual beer at the store, but as of now i can only have it as a treat. hope this one can come regularly in LA."
"Notes: One of my favorite beers to have around, it is good anytime and you can drink it with anything. Can't wait to try the 90 minute."
"Notes: A great beer to drink with friends; it's the perfect social lubricant. Not too alcoholic, and delicious. I thoroughly enjoy this beer every time I have it."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA. I could suck quiet a few of these down on any given day."
"Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied and is generously carbonated."
"Real good all the time + everywhere"
"Mmmboy there's some great hop flavors going on here. Excellent session IPA...I love this beer."
"Really enjoyed my first DFH 60 min. could drink a couple of these in a sitting"
"Drinkability: Questionable. Ultimately, I am unmoved by this offering and would rather opt for something a bit more fuller and more rounded in the future."
"Super bright amber orange/honey in color. When poured I got no head but the lacing was relatively sticky. Aroma was oily and of floral hops and bisuity malts. Taste was also of floral hops and the alcohol touches the back of the throat just slightly. Malts had a sourdough bread flavor which didn't seem quite balanced. Mouthfeel was a little course. Not a bad beer, but I'll try the 75, 90 or 120 Minute Ale the next time, maybe they'll be a little more balanced."
"This is very well-balanced and I could drink many of these in a row, which is quite unlike some IPAs."
"overall- the more i drink this, the more i like it. it has a nice raw hop bite to it, which i love. the taste is crisp and even refreshing. next time im going to side by side this with 90min and see how they stand against eachother. but from memory, i like the taste of the 60min better."
"Pours a light, clear amber with a finger of white fluffy head. Nose is a muted version of 90, piney floral hops balanced by sweet malt and a hint of light fruit. Taste is also subtle, with floral hops, grassy malt, and faint hints of pineapple and apricot. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is just a simple, easy-drinking IPA. I could throw back a sixer like water. Then again, I think I'd prefer to throw back a four...-er of 90 Min instead."
"The beer seemed a bit over-carbonated but man, what a pour!! produced a huge rocky head that lasts & lasts and when subsides leaves half its mass on the side of the glass (I didn't mean for that to rhyme, it just worked out that way.) The aroma is OK, its floral like perfume but not particularly citrusy or piney or any of those typically American hop descriptors. The flavor is really nice, well hopped of course with some fruitiness and assertive but not overwhelming bitterness. The malt base is there but not as well blended as some of the other IPAs I've had. The mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well. Very nice beer."
"Check out the 90 minute, especially on tap. That's where it's at."
"I can fully understand why this is DFH's flagship beer, even though it lives in the shadow of it's infamous older brother... 90 Minute."
"A good malty session brew IPA, this could become my Winter IPA of choice due to the larger malt profile and not being overly alcoholic."
"Notes: Another great DFH offering."
"Dogfish Head has it down to a science. GO GET SOME!"
"This always has been a very solid and standout IPA. Try it if you haven't, a must try for all hopheads."
"A clear amber looking beer with a two finger head.This has a piney hop aroma with a bit of spice that I couldn't pick out.The taste is very good.A very dry hop filled explosion with a slight creamy feel.A medium/light mouthfeel thats dry and leaves your mouth crisp and clean,very good.This does have a alcohol warming aftertaste.Dogfish Head has made a great beer.This could be an everyday beer."
"Drinkability  Superb. Im all over it. This ones not as easy to find here in Seattle. Get it if you find it!"
"I love IPA's and this one I could Definately drink all night. All in all and awsome beer. Props the the DFH Brewing Company."
"Pours golden amber in color with a creamy, sustained head. Aroma consists of malt, spicy hops and citrus. Full-bodied mouthfell, with sharp carbonation along the edges of the tongue. Malt and hop bitterness combine to form the initial taste. Not as overpowering as I was expecting. Juicy citrus hop bitterness midway through. Finished with a predominant bitterness that lingers at the top of the throat. This is really a full-flavored and enjoyable IPA. Better balanced than their 90 minute version."
"Some explanations for this review may be that the tap room might have TOO MANY beers and the stuff got old and stale."
"amber-orange with thin off white head. (I've had this on draft and the head is fluffy and amazing that way. beats the bottle any day.) smells of big aggressive hops; oily and herbal and floral and so appetizing. makes me want to gulp, it smells so good. taste is similarly hoppy and addictive. there's a big, yummy hop bite that smoothes out as you drink. just enough alcohol to notice, in a good way. drinkability: YES. I could drink these until it was no longer a good idea."
"This brew has a beautiful orange color to it. Very nice head with just the right amount of carbination to complement. One of the first things you notice with this brew is the very asertive hop aroma with nice citric/grassy/piney notes, Very crisp brew with a slight bitterness due to the hops and just a little hint of malts on the side. A very good IPA, overall!"
"Overall: A great offering from DFH. Nicely balanced and nice full flavors abound. A very impressive IPA. Definately a staple!"
"All in all I love DFH, and I love their 60 Minute, I always have a few bottles on hand for when I have a bad night. For the price and how good of a IPA this is, I always have a sixer sitting in my fridge."
"overall: smells and tastes wonderful. nice american ipa. will make an excellent session brew for just about anyone. i try not to, but i always try and compare this to the 90 minute. it's no 90 minute, but an excellent ipa none the less."
"Well carbonated amber color, with a thin white head that laces quite well. The aroma is quite strong; fresh and hoppy. The taste is a beautiful hoppy experience without being overpowering like some of the west coast IPA's. Hints of pine and pepper. Mouthfeel is impressive; almost an oil-like sensation (but in no way unpleasant). This would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability -- Quite drinkable. I could easily end up drinking too many on a nice quiet summer Sunday afternoon. I would recommend to any fan of the IPA style."
"Tap at Zeno's. This pours a golden amber with nice big head. Smell is sweet and citrusy. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of peach flavor at first which of course is followed by the hops- lots of nice citrus flavors going on here and a lingering bitterness. More balanced than your average IPA which isn't necessarily good or bad but it's different and I enjoyed it for a change. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied for an IPA maybe a little bit syrupy. Fairly drinkable. Not as sessionable for me as some other IPA's. This reminds me a lot of Dogfish's 90 Minute which is probably not too surprising. The most striking similarity is in the strong malt presence which I think really suits the more powerful 90 minute but is a little out of place here. Still this is a very tastey and enjoyable brew."
"Thumbs up."
"Pours a mid-dark golden color with a huge head that will lessen but doesnt totally disappear. This beer smells hoppy and of citrus reminds me of a southern tier brew that I had about a week ago. The taste is also hoppy with a taste of citrus. The mouthfeel has little carbonation and can be a little oily. A decent beer with a head will stick around thought the session. Give it a try."
"A very nice American IPA. Nice color and flavor. Small head. Not as hoppy as I would like but that is what the 90 minute IPA is for. Very drinkable. The one thing that I really liked about it is that it isn't packed full of cascade hops like a lot of IPA's are. Available in bottle also."
"Drinkability: as far as IPAs go, I enjoy this one. One of the better examples I have had overall."
"Mouthfeel is a good, foamy, bubbly, chewy texture. Feels really good. Quite drinkable, as I feel most good IPAs are. And at 6%, it's not toooo dangerous so you can down a few. A solid IPA, especially when you're in the mood for a balanced hop taste."
"Pours a semi-cloudy golden color with a small white head. The aroma is very grassy with faint citrus notes. The taste is as grassy as the aroma with a hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this brew is way to grassy for my likings. Grassy can be alright, but this brew is one dimensional and boring."
"Overall, because it is so well balanced and not as over-the-top as many American IPAs, I think this is extremely drinkable. If only I could find it on tap anywhere..."
"Drinkability: A refreshing IPA; nicely balanced"
"This is definitely a superior IPA and should defiinitely be considered a session brew for hop lovers."
"This'll definitely sate a hops craving."
"Overall, a paragon of craft beer. To think of this beer, then pull it off with such flavor, is fantastic. I want to try the 90 and 120 versions ASAP. If I could improve anything, it would be the foaminess of the head (though it excels at lacing). That's about it."
"A truly great beer."
"This is a beer that I would have no problem drinking several of at a time."
"IPAs are not my first choice in beer, but this one I will have again"
"This is one of the better IPA's ever. It pours typical of all great IPAs: copper to orange, off white dense head, good retention and lacing. Smells better though. Not all piney or grassy, and not too sweet or salty. High levels of IBU's give enough of a spicy, pine cone-ey, estery, and floral aromas to apease the most agressive hophead, but balanced nicely with subtle sweet notes. Tastes smoothly sweet of ripe fruits, citrus, barley sugar, and honey sweetness. Spicy hop flavor compound the sweetness, making it not only balanced, but easily drinkable. Spices show everything from nutmeg and cinnemon to corriander and pepper. Hop flavor brings out fruits of ripe oranges and pears. Finishes crisp and a lingering dryness that is not too harsh. leaves enough hop flavor without feeling hot, grainy, or overly bitter. Aftertaste is spicy and leaving me wanting another. This is even more easily drinkable than their 90 minute."
"Cheers..."
"All in all... a nice IPA.... I'd take the 90min any day though."
"This brew has a medium body that is welcome on the palate. Mouthfeel is oily and the aftertaste sticks around for a while. Bitter hop tinges are coupled well with the malts and mild citrus floral notes. Slightly piney finish. This brew really quenches the thirst. Quite tasty and refreshing. I think I'll have another."
"Nice golden/orange color. Small head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing. Medium level of carbonation bubbles. Cirtus smell that is not overpowering but nice. Taste is all hops with citrus and some piney notes. Medium body and nice carbonation level on the tongue. I downed about 6 of these playing poker the other night so it must be a drinkable beer."
"All in all, not impressed and not too inclined to try another one. I probably will at some point, hoping this may have been a bum bottle. I'll certainly still want to try the 90 minute to see what kind of similarities there are. If I'm looking for an IPA, though, there are dozens that would be higher up on my list..."
"Another great beer from Dogfish Head. Golden-orange hue with a nice white head. More sticky lacing than most IPAs. Tasty, nice hops, well balanced. Full, smooth body makes this a pleasure to swirl in your mouth. I could easily drink a session worth of these."
"Pours a nice golden color slightly tinted orange. Head was a 2 finger size with the pour and is lasting throughout. Nose is basically the malts and not much else. Taste is nicely balanced between the malts and the hops. It almost seems more like an ESB. Mouthfeel is good, very lively on the palate with a full finish. Overall drinkability is good, this is a good beer!"
"A late 4th of July tasting. Poured a slightly cloudy light orange color. Good white head put not overpowering, nicely carbonated. Head lasted throughout tasting with lacing. Hop smell put not overpowering. Great balanced smooth taste with citrus and hop finish. Overall a nice IPA that one could drink all day long. God bless American and those who fought for our freedoms. Thank you"
"I give this beer an A in hoppiness. The smell, the taste, the aftertaste all scream hops. The beer pours a soft white 1 finger head, which stayed the entire time I enjoyed it. It also laced quite a bit. The color is more of an orange or golden. The flavor was somewhat citrus, somewhat grassy. Great beer especially if your a hophead."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and overall a nice experience. I'm interested to try their 90 and 120 min IPAs now."
"Drinkability: Due to the thickness and extremes in both the malt and hop character, I have to say that this is average at best. Putting away more than a few of these may be difficult. Although it would most definitely be fun."
"12 oz bottle purchased by MABZ from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and shared with me a couple days later in June 2005. Thanks for sharing! Pours a two finger light cream-colored head that hangs around. Just a hint of cloudy to the bright and light rust yellow liquid. Aroma is very mild. Grassy citrusy with not very much malt. Taste is somewhat bitter and mildly citrusy. Not a hop monster, it's more of a pale ale than an IPA. Citrus is mild grapefruit with some orange. Fruit esters are apricot and pear. The end holds a cidery piney hop bite. The hoip bitter increased as the beer warmed, but there wasn't an increase in the malt to go with it. Md-light body with mild carbonation that put an acrid sting in the middle of my tongue. Nice burps, though. Co-ho and citrus."
"Beer pours a cloudy orange with a white head that is nice at first, then reduces to about an inch. The smell is sweet of citrus and fresh spring flowers, the lemon scent mixed with dewey melons was suprising, the hop are light and floral, a nice sweet smell. The taste is of roasted coffee and caramels, the hops are light and floral. Very suprised by the lightness of this beer. Very different from the 90 minute version, the subtle hints of hops were very suprising."
"Yes! It's been over a week since a drop of beer has touched my mouth and I was very excited to see this one available at a new local pub in town. Paid $3.25 for a bottle and was well worth every penny. Pours copper with a perfect head, nice lacing, and great carbonation. Could have a bit more bite on the tongue but mouthfeel is still very good. Once you begin to enjoy IPA's, this one would be a keeper."
"The smell is strong and good, but has more pine than I would like. Malt content seems a little low, although the overall taste is still good. The mouthfeel is solid and appealing."
"Overall, I'd say this is an excellent beer, but I could only give it higher marks if it weren't billed as an IPA. If it were billed as a regular pale ale, I'd rate it near the top. But putting it in the category of an IPA demands a certain hoppiness that just isn't present. That said, this is still an excellent beer, and comes highly recommended. Now if DFH would just get a California distributor already..."
"This beer pours golden, and leaves a white sticky lace on the glass. As I examine the clearity of the brew it looks flawless, my first smell is very hoppy, lemon, citrus, and a floural essence. As this brew hits the palate I taste brown sugar and orange rinds, this is a great session beer one that has alot of flavor and is well crafted. I love DFH and this brew didn't disappoint. This beer would pair well with a salty dish, such as a beer crackers (grilled pizza dough w/blue cheese and scallions) or another savory delight that has a bit of salt."
"Overall, a very good IPA (although a tad pricey). I liked this much better than the 90 Minute or the Aprihop."
"A solid American IPA."
"Very refreshing and a overall crisp and smooth taste. Not overpoweringly bitter or hoppy and not fruitty either. This might serve well as an intro-beer to the style for someone who has not had an IPA before, or who has not liked other IPA's. Very drinkable, and one I will drink again."
"Sample at the Mondiale 2005: Poured a clear amber color ale with a medium head with limited retention. Aroma of sweet and floral hops is quite enjoyable. Taste is sweeter then expected at first with the expected bitterness hitting more towards the end. Well balance IPA."
"I find that this beer is always in my fridge. I love this beer, and it is always available. Thanks dogfish for making a great beer."
"Finishes cleanly, with a little bit of hoppy aftertaste. An excellent beer for a hot summer night."
"Had this on tap, and it poured a deep golden color with only a thin whispy head---decent amount of lacing however. Smell is hop heaven---big piney resinous hops are he first thing you smell, with a little citrus and grapefruit detectable and a bready malt lingering faintly in the background. Taste is more of the same--very strong hops presense with a nice lingering bitterness that is nevertheless nicely balanced by the strong biscuity malts. Beer is medium bodied and has somewhat of a syrupy feel, coating your mouth with pleasant hop oil. Love this beer. Not as good tasting as the 120 minute, but much more of a session beer."
"12 oz. brown long-neck bottle with freshness date stamped into the side of front label."
"White one finger head upon pouring which hangs in there til the bottom where it finishes in a thin layer. Clear yellowish-orange body. Smell is of a nice blend of hops with hints of citrus, pine and resin but a little light. Good bitterness in the flavor where pines resin taste overplays a very slight citrusness. This beer is fairly well balanced with a good malt base to it. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy compared to other IPAs Ive had but definitely not thick or overly oily. Drinkability is excellent, a good flavored beer that doesnt sit too heavy."
"I could only drink one of these but I gotta give Dogfish Head props for keeping this beer from being a muddied, hoppy mess. I am going to pick up some more of these and cellar them to see how the hops mellow with age."
"Drinkamability: I could drinkamize these things all night or day. I cannot find anything that would detract from the drinkamability factor. Hops are well represented without crossing the line into crazy hopped territory. Mild and universally appealing."
"The brew was a little syrupy (which I don't mind), but packed a big citrus punch which gradually gave way to a slightly more acrid flavour. Considering this beer isn't from the NW, I'm suprised to say it is one of the most citrusy IPA's I've drunk. I like it."
"Pours a bright, clear copper color with a foamy white head that dissapates quickly, a nice lookin IPA. Smell is floral and citric hops with a dominating grapefruit smell that goes nicely with a bready malt background. The taste is fairly complex, you get a grapefruit hops flavor, a piney, resiny taste coating the mouth and a soft biscuity malt flavor that takes a backseat to the hops. The finish is crisp and creamy with a mild bitteress that belies the alcohol. Overall a nice IPA thats hoppy but not overly bitter. A drinkable and complex IPA, nicely done."
"Drinkability: One of the more drinkable IPAs I've had."
"Definitely the small brother of 90 Minute which I enjoyed more. Nonetheless, 60 Minute is less of a smack on the palate and the midsection and is more approachable in session. Mini Me gets big respect."
"The smell of this brew ruined it for me. I would guess it might have been light struck, or I would hope so for all the funk in the smell."
"Drinkability-I definately would recommend this beer as a great session beer, a great balance of powerfull hops and smooth drinkability."
"Drinkability: At 6.00% alcohol I could drink this mother all freakin night. Holler"
"This beer is a beautiful golden color. Its clearer than I though it would be, being bottle-conditioned. There is a nice, small head with a nice lace ring. This beer looks wonderful in the glass. The aroma is of very strong citrus and floral hops. The initial taste is an overpowering hop flavor. Its not overly bitter.There is malt flavor backing, but it is definitely in the background. This is the kind of beer that hopheads love. This is a good beer to pair with a meal."
"Fairly strong pungent grapefruit hop aroma. Thick dense off-white head fades quickly to a thick film leaving some thick strings of lace. Hazy dark straw colored beer shows little carbonation. Solid malt backbone with some chewy citrus hops riding on top. Finish is just bitter enough to let you know it's an IPA. Mouthfeel is soft and chewy (hops). A solid hoppy IPA that I could a bunch of."
"I've had the 90 Minute on several occasions but never managed to get the 60 Minute until now. 12 oz., bottle conditioned, with no month notched on the label. Pours a golden orange with a 2 finger, off white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, pine, pineapple/mango, malt breadiness, and yeast - the tropical hops dominate. There are lots of grapefruit/pine hop flavors along with pineapple, yeast, a touch of breadiness, and a big malt backbone. It is both sweet and fairly bitter at the same time. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and coats the mouth very well. It's fairly obvious that this is the little brother of the 90 Minute, but that is by no means an insult. Overall, a damn fine IPA."
"Nice orange golden color. Nice lacy head when poured out of bottle into glass. But what amazed me was the smell. Very hopped, but not overpowering. The smell adds to the actual taste. Nice bitterness and slight aftertaste. There is an initial floral taste and then a completely different bitter aftertaste. Nice complexity yet very drinkable. I consider this not a session beer, but instead an after dinner beer. A real treat!"
"Pours translucent orange-amber with a very foamy head, good retention. Robust carbonation. Smells of wheats and a nice mix of hops, some alcohol notes. Taste is very well balanced with toasty bready wheats and a full hops flavor that was not just bitter but had actual hops flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp as well. I'd definitely have this again."
"Drinkability- No way I could do this a session beer, but it's a great IPA for a change of pace if you want a really sweet IPA. Almost like a Pliny the Younger with less malt and 1/2 the alcohol. Thanks guys for the sample!"
"This was an enjoyable, mild IPA, and one I would recommend."
"As far as IPA's go, this one was sort of average."
"Overall a great IPA."
"Pizza of any kind with a white sauce goes real well with this selection. Try with even a mildly spicy food, perhaps some tuna tacos."
"Good medium mouthfeel that meets my expectations of the style. Despite its slight awkwardness, I would have a few more."
"Smooth dinner drink. Pine herbal aroma. Citrus, very nice IPA. Bitter but smoothed out with lots of sweetness and fruitiness.Aggressive carbonation tingling the tongue. Lace and wooden golden colour. very quaffable. Best of their minute-IPAs. Had a fresh bottle a year later and noticed creamy easy mouthfeel, late bitterness and overall balance."
"The beer pours a cloudless deep amber color with a monsterous creamy light tan head that declines slowly leaving a thick and clinging blanket of lace upon the glass. Nose has a marvelous hop floral spiciness with a sweet and somewhat earthy malt aroma, lime like in its crispness, fresh and so inviting it just makes your mouth water in anticipation, start is sweet and delightfully malted with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish delicately carbonated with the hops magnificent in their spicy bite, dry long lasting hop laden aftertaste lays easy on the palate, oh how happy we hopheads now that Dogfish Head is available in Arizona Woo Hoo!"
"The mouthfeel is light, carbonated, and smooth...very drinkable for an IPA."
"Drinkability is ok not a great IPA but not the worst either. I feel most of DFH minute IPA's are overated but I do like the Aprilhop :)"
"Drinkability: Highly sessionable for an IPA, because it has enough character to keep your tastebuds interested without frying them. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Although it is hop-oriented, it is still well balanced. Good."
"Taste: this beer is mostly hops (not surprisingly), but with a discernible maltiness in the background. However, I am kind of dumbfounded to find that I like this beer. It has a very alluring spiciness that goes down extremely well. I will be the first to admit I am not a hophead (I prefer my bitterness to come from roasted malt). However, this beer is the best IPA I have tasted so far."
"Drinkability is excellent on this, another solid offering from Dogfish Head!"
"Pours a beautiful clear orange-gold with 1/2 inch head that falls to about 1/8 inch leaving blobs of bubbles on my official DFH pint glass. If they made a hop-based soda pop it would smell like this. The odor could easily be confused with sweaty socks too. I bought a case of this in December and drank two sixers in the first week and I remember this beer being rough and raw like chewing hops right off the vine. I've had it cellaring for the last couple of months and opened a bottle tonight. The taste has definitely mellowed. (Or maybe I'm remembering the Burton Baton from last night.) The initial taste is mellow malt, then a alcohol coated hoppiness takes over without destroying the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to light with the bubbles feeling a bit too big with the alcohol bite. This is easy to drink, certainly more so than three months ago. I'll be trying it again in May to see if it mellows a bit more. I've got track down a 120 and see what I'm missing."
"This is a damn fine brew. I've been familiar with this one for a while, but really examining it for this review, I was impressed even more. All IPA lovers should celebrate this beer if at all possible."
"D- a good hop monster. I know there are bigger hop monsters but this is all hops with malt and alcohol only present to enhance the hops even more. It has my taste buds wanting to take a break but my brain keeps asking for more. Great beer."
"--Joey"
"Verdict: This the hoppiest beer I've tried so far, which isn't surprising considering that I spend more time drinking oatmeal stouts and brown ales than I do drinking IPAs. This is a nice, refreshing beer, though, and it would be an excellent choice as a session brew."
"This is a really good offering from DFH. I can see why this is basically their flagship beer. This will be great in the warmer weather. Keep this one in a glass, though. I tried one out of the bottle, and the hops just overpowered the taste. You have to let this beer breathe in a glass or mug to get the real experience. Thanks for braving the Texas market, guys! You have made a convert out of me, that's for sure."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, though the mouthfeel left much to be desired. I think it tastes great, I like an IPA that has a bold hop flavor to it. The appearance and aroma are fairly typical and nice, but not really all that standout-ish."
"The mouthfeel was ok...I prefer their 90 Minute. Drinkability is decent...I could have a few of these in a row w/out any effort."
"The flavor is smooth and easy. A very rich fruit taste at the front with an earthy hop hit in the after. Halfway down the glass, the hop flavors kick up quite a bit. A bit more effervescence would help the mouthfeel greatly, as well as help the poor head retention."
"(edit: usually tastes like cinnamon and hops to me, but the last time I bought it, tasted like a roasted cider with a bit of hops.)"
"Update  I originally reviewed this with an 05 sample so thought Id revisit it with a 2006 vintage. Its not as big in the mouth as I initially noted, but a very solid East Coasty IPA."
"Drinkability: Good. Session beer for hop head."
"A session beer for the hop head. This fine IPA pours absolutely crystal clear a modest head forms atop the rich straw color and leaves a lace that persists on the side of my pint glass. A fruity hop aroma that reminds me of the last time I put my head into a bag of freash whole hops. Hops, hops, and more hops. A great taste with enough malt to support the esters, this IPA has a great mouthfeel with a near perfect CO2 level. I can't believe I only bought one bottle. Next run I will make it six! Ummm . . no maybe twelve!"
"Overall: A very nice IPA that avoids a lot of the overwhelmingly fruity notes that sometimes annoy me, but by no means a new favorite. I've got 7 more from their sampler pack in my fridge, and I'm looking forward to drinking them."
"A Caveat Emptor: If you're drinking this beer heavily, be prepared for a punch much more than the 6% ABV would lead you to believe."
"BIG hops, BIG bite, BIG beer. Beautiful copper hue, big beautiful head, great mouthfeel. Could I have found a new favorite IPA? I think I'm in love!!! All around a great session beer!!! Highly reccommended, would love to try this on tap. Congratulations on a great IPA!"
"Overall Impression: For the hop level, I found it very refreshing and enjoyable. Drinkability is put off slightly by the intensity and heft, but this is a beer I will seek on a regular basis now that it has made a home here in Texas. Intense taste of hops without the pucker or burn; Sam and crew have done it again with a fine off the hook beer."
"Overall a great beer. There is some great flavor and aroma."
" Strange smell, average taste; the 90 minute is way better."
"12 ouncer with freshness dating notched onto the label. Pours fairly light amber, clear with a white head, tiny bubbles, showing respectable retention. leaves nice fine lacing. Nose is faintly of hops. Medium body, respectable hop package, Resiny, sticky and oily. Fairly well balance, with a mellow malt profile, providing a smooth ride to the finish. Nice, suprisingly understated brew for DFH. Good beginner DFH selection to turn on those without too much exposure to the other meaty brews that come out of Rehobeth Beach, De."
"This one of my favorite ipa's ( though not as good as it's 90 min big bro) which I will gladly consume whenever possible. It is, however, too hoppy to be a good session beer."
"poured cloudy orangish with a white head. aroma citrus like grapefruit, hops hints of yeast.flavor grapefruit with sugar on it, hops a touch of alcohol and a nice bitterness after taste. I did like the 90 min. better but this came in a close 2nd I am sure glad the fish finally swam to mich."
"Out of the bottle, this is a beautiful orangish color, with a white head that dissapates quikly. I detect a slight citrus nose, not unpleasant at all. On first drink, I realized this was a beer with a message, and the message is beware. If you don't like a hoppy beer, stay away. The flavor is all hops, with a hoppy aftertaste that seemed to disappear in a citrus fade."
"Drinkability: Hops are in high gear here. It suffers just a touch due to the hop bitterness. It worked for me though. Just make sure everything you want to taste is consumed before you hit this one."
"Poured out an amber colorwith a huge head. Lots of floaters in it hops maybe?Grapefruity type hop smell ,not too bad.Taste is hugely hops but not very balanced in my opinion.Missing something but unsure of what its missing.Id rather just skip over this one and go straight to the goods with their 90 minute ipa."
"Wow! I had heard good things about this beer, but I was still surprised at how good it was. Appearance - nice golden brown, typical IPA color, 1"" straw-colored head that lasts a good while and leaves lacing all around the glass. Smell - very good. Citrusy, maybe a hint of pine? Taste - ah, the pine really comes through here. After the first sip, I thought, ""man, this is like drinking a Christmas tree," but that description doesn't really do the beer justice. The piney taste is definitely there, but it's not overpowering by any means. It gives a unique character to the beer that is great in my book. Mouthfeel - good, but nothing special. Drinkability is pretty high, though the pineyness might be a turnoff for some. Overall I rate this beer very highly - it certainly won't be my last."
"Note #2: This beer's label states bottle-conditioned. The bottom of my bottle had absolutely NO yeast ring or sediment to be seen. I don't think it's bottle conditioned."
"Quite fine IPA. I like this lots better than the 90 minute, and infinitely more than the 120 minute. Very unique beer."
"This is my first beer of the night and the 12oz bottle pours a nice clear, copper color. The head is very thin and dissappears just as quickly. The smell of this beer is very nice, with a strong grapefruit and pine aroma. The smell of this beer is very fine for an IPA and makes you want the first sip. The first sip has a nice piney and mild citrus taste. I am a little dissappointed in the strength of the hop flavor in the beer. It has a nice taste in the beginning but does not hold up very well. The mouthfeel is also a bit on the thin side. The beer did have a nice hoppy finish. This is a very drinkable session beer.."
"It pours like a lager, very similar in color with a thin head that dissipitated and no lace. The aroma is of slight hops. And, not suprisingly, those hops follow into the flavor of the beer. The flavor has hints of unripe citrus that hit the tongue with the first sip and then follow through into the finish. The hops are slightly bitter, but as is appropriate for an IPA."
"Another great American IPA by DFH."
"This is very unique and good tasting beer, fairly well balanced, but with the edge goin to the hops which are very nice, good drinkability, quality stuff all the way!"
"Pours a clear, slightly orange gold under a one finger off-white head that settles quickly to patchy film but leaves very nice lacing. There's definite pine in the nose, but it is not overwhelming, and is accompanied by a hint of sweet bread. The mouth is quite well carbonated and fairly light-bodied. There's a definite malt presence as the taste experience opens, sweet and almost fruity. This is balanced by a raw pine bitterness that is pervasive but not excessive. The pine is a bit harsh, perhaps slightly unfinished. The raw, almost espresso bitter is dry, inviting another swig. This is a great introductory IPA."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA in my opinion. Hop bitterness doesn't overwhelm. In fact, let me finish this one off and go grab another. A fine brew indeed."
"Prosit!"
"Great beer here. I can now get a six pack regularly. This beer looks great not overly amber still pale enough with a decent lingering head. The smell is an offering of citrus blend and spicy hop notes. It has a beautiful body, not too heavy ass like some high hopped beers are but it acheives balance without needing extra body. The taste is of a perfect hop splash. The moderate alcohol content is slightly noticeable and the plate of malt flavor serves the hop bitterness up well to liven up your mouth. A very refreshing beer and drinking the whole 6'er in a night would be easy."
"Cheers"
"Biscuity malt, & fruity flavours, quickly give way to a full on hop assault. Its like eating a grapefruit thats been drenched in pine sap - and I like it! Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"I heartily recommend you treat yourself to a least a 6."
"This is a damn good pale ale (IPA). I love the taste of their beers. Similar to the Aprihop, but a bit more subtle. I could drink this all night. Smooth and tangy, Dogfish Head tastes like nothing else I've had. This is a nicely balanced brew. Not as overtly fruity or hoppy as some, but plenty of hops are there to balance the malt undertones. I would like to compare the 90 minute head to head to see the difference, but this has a good shot at becoming my #1 session IPA."
"Dinkability is great. This stuff goes down so nice, I could put these away all day. One of my favorite IPAs to date. DFH has done the world a great service with this beer. WOW!!!!"
"This is a VERY drinkable IPA. I'd consider this a session IPA. I plan of drinking more of this."
"This beer got me into IPA's. It is also the only beer that is ""good to the last drop"" in my opinion. In other words, the last sip is better than the first, usually its the other way around. I love this beer and so should you. Its got the taste of most IPA's then at the end gets flavor-full and sweet. It is great by itself or with a meal."
"Pours a clear amber with a white frothy head. Very nice lacing down the glass. Smells incredibly hoppy and acidic with fruit and floral undertones. Nice and pleasent smelling. Tastes just like a good, solid IPA should. Nice and hoppy at first with malts rounding it off on the finish. Very bitter without being overpowering. Very pleasant tasting. A great mouthfeel, very light without losing it's strength. A great, complex beer which would make a fabulous session brew. Definitly get your hands on this."
"I think it's a great beer. I definately would recommend it. I've been waiting for this beer to show up in one of my local stores for a long time now and I'm glad it did."
"Clean and clear golden amber color, dense white head that offers modest retentionand minimal lace. Big, beautiful citrus and floral bouquet with a hint of malt sweetness, pine, and herbal notes. Starts with a kiss of malt which gives way to a punch in the mouth of luscious grapefruit and tangerine hops with noticable floral marijuana accents. Every time I burp it's like I ate a big bud of some dank...This is a tasty brew served right outa the cellar. I drink a lot of these. Beer is good."
"beware old bottles on this one. my first 6pack was old, and i thought this beer a bit lackluster. i got a fresh one recently and it was a whole new beer. i even did a side by side, and the fresh was certainly different, in a nicer way."
" Outstanding example of the style, with a Dogfish Head twist. A great beer for those looking to really tastes hop flavors."
"The appearance is dark golden honey, with an average head and nice, sticky lacing. This beer smells phenomenal -- especially if you're a hop head. This must be what it's like to take a bath in hop oil-infused water. When you drink this puppy, the hops are omnipresent, but I don't find them to be completely overwhelming like so many other attempts at strong IPAs. The plentiful malt backbone really stands up to its acidic foe and takes it like a man. I taste pinenuts, orange doughnut, rosemary, and a very floral profile. I appreciate good IPAs, but I am not a hophead. As such, the long, lingering bitterness that haunts you after many over-the-top IPAs is not appealing to me. But this -- this I could drink all night."
"Pours a dark straw-yellow color with a nice head. Aroma was hoppy and pleasant but somewhat subdued. Not overpowering. The taste was less than stellar. All I could taste were the hops, and I didnt find them pleasant. Very similar flavor profile to a SNPA, which I dont care for either. If you it, you will like this one too. Other than the taste, this beer was fine. Its not a bad taste, it just doesnt sit well with me. I traded a Stone IPA for the DFH and I lost in the deal. Not a bad beer, but not one I will go out of the way to buy."
"This is a solid IPA. Had this one on tap at the Moan and Dove, great place by the way. Good foamy head, which laces ALL the way down the glass, very snowflakey, very nice. Smells citrusy, lots of hops, lots of pizazz. Taste is very hoppy as expected. So many hops that it tastes bitter, which I think is what DFH might have been going for and is what makes this beer more unique than the average IPA. Mouthfeel; this tastes like a dry wine or something of the sort, almost feel like I need a glass of water after this one. Very interesting indeed. This beer is a standard IPA, very drinkable, but with an intriguing extra bitter/dry kick."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not something I'd drive to Wisconsin for again..."
"Drinakbility is the one weakness. I am just not that much of a hop-head although Dogfish head is one of the better hoppy tasting beers readily available to me. Maybe I could have more than a couple - I don't know and I am not gonna try --at least tonight."
"Mouthfeel is sticky, medium-large bodied. I would drink this more often if it was available in either MN, or UT!"
"This has such a strong and distinctive taste that I think you'd burn out on it if you drank more than a few at a sitting. But gaw-damn, this is a great beer. One of my absolute favorite IPAs."
"OK OK Maybe now I see why this one is so highly regarded now that I have had the draft version ... Much much better than the bottled version !!"
"I was very impressed with the ""Randall"" and this beer, and look forward to trying it bottled as soon as I can find some and pick it up."
"Light mouthfeel, flavors the breath with hops. Immediate massive hops burps even with a small sample. Easily quaffable, the effect of the Randall is obvious and appreciated. A welcome departure from some of the overwhelming West Coast hop monsters."
"Drinkability: Good. I could have a couple and still not have my pallete shot to pieces. Nice middle of the road ABV, and a solid all around beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"12 oz. bottle that pours a reddish-golden color with a nice head that goes down to fine whitel lacing that remains present on side of glass. Aroma is of a pleasant hop with a slight floral scent. Taste has much more hoppiness then in aroma. Bitterness is present throughout taste especially coming through on the short crisp finish. Mouthful is that of an easy drinking beer."
"It has a decent mouthfeel and is not overly filling."
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with a nice big head from the 12oz bottle. The 1 inch head sticks around awhile. Smells of hops....pine and citrus scents come through. The first sip is all hops and damn is it good. Not too bitter and it even leaves a nice aftertaste. This is one of the first proper American IPA's I've tried and I like it alot. I'm a big fan of the hops and this brew definetly delivers. I'm excited to try the 90 and 120 minute versions after all I've read on here. Overall, this is a great brew....one I will look forward to coming back to in the future."
"This beer is extremely well put together though I would hesitate to classify it as a session beer."
"Pours deep, golden-orange with a nice two finger head. Nose is filled with hints of sweet hops and malt. The nose is a little deceiving when it comes to the hops, because the first taste is filled with that great hop flavor. As the beer began to warm caramel and citrus flavors filled the glass. The beer had a long, nicely bitter finish with strong flavors of grapefruits. An excellent beer."
"Edit: I think the flavor is not as weak as I thought last time I had it. I think the flavor renders this one very drinkable. The bitter hits hard upfront, but then fades, but doesn't completely die. This is a fine beer"
"I give it slightly lower scores for the appearance because the bottle says it is bottle conditioned. Quick question... where's the yeast? Is this false advertising? I bought a six-pack and the first two bottles have absolutely no yeast in them. The beers are perfectly clear and I swirled the remaining 1/6th of the beer and added it to my glass. Nothing. What's up with that?"
"Pours a three-fingered white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Very hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nothing like the 90 & 120 minute IPAs Dogfish has, this is a 'normal' IPA that is loaded with hops - hopheads line up for this one. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
" I really, really enjoy this IPA, it did not let me down one bit and I had high hopes for it. Big and hoppy, but with subtle nuances as well. Now, cant wait to try the other IPAs from DFH. Big ups jlervine for swinging through with this one!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"very good, but not one of the all time greats."
"Draught pours a clear golden copper color with a pretty short-lived light beige head. Medium to lower carbonation. There's a depth in the hop aroma that encompasses a grassy, botanical type aroma as well as some good, crystally homegrown. (Sorry for the non-beer suggestion, but hops are a genus cousin to marijuana, and the recognition is purely objective) Malt profile's a bit biscuity and sweet, but the dryness of the hop counterbalance this. It's wonderfully carfted, and a refreshing change of pace as opposed to other U.S. brewed IPAs. Unique hop profile that makes it wholly enjoyable in the American IPA style, it stands out."
"A very drinkable beer. Bitter, but in a pleasing way. Enough other flavors present to balance the hops."
"Final Words: From my description, this may seem kind of bland, but I promise you that this a great tasting brew. The first sip of every bottle immediately relaxes my whole body and mind. I think that it sets itself apart from other APA's and A-IPA's because of its full flavor and great balance. Not as intense as its 90- and 120-min cousins (or other bigger IPA's, for that matter) but an extremely well balanced, very hoppy, exceedingly enjoyable beer. I have to say that this is one of my all time favorites from my favorite style, and it's THE beer that got me into 'good' beer. Lacks the creativity of other DFH offerings, but is otherwise a pinnacle of microbrewery success."
"Note: This beer really surprised me. I'm not normally a hop-head, but for this beer, I found myself becoming one. This is a really unique beer and everyone should try it at least once. In fact, it left two other beers I tried later on the same night, tasting completely bland, and these were malty, bigger beers."
"I'm afraid in years to come we will look back on this recipe as a caricature, a fad. It is a good demonstration of one important beer ingredient - but not ""beer"" itself; no more than pepper is steak au poivre nor more than pepperoni is pizza."
"Id always been partial to the 90-minute version of DFH, but recent posts on this beer, made me come back to it. It pours clear gold to orange with a thick, rich white head. Small champagne bubbles rise from the bottom to renew the head, which settles pleasantly as a lace. The nose is amazing on this beer. Its like putting your face in a pile of hops. Rich floral/grass/pine aromas rise from the glass. Just a hint of grapefruit too. The taste is an explosion of hop taste. A tongue awakening of flower, pine, and grapefruit, a mild sweetness comes from the malt. This has a very slick mouth feel, and seems very drinkable. Im glad I picked up this 6 pack."
"This beer pours a golden orange with a nice foamy head. The lacing is quite intricate. The nose is all hops, with hints of caramel and sweet malt. The taste is all hops. It is hard to taste the malts that peek through in the nose. The beer is really good but one-dimensional. I would like to taste the malts a little more. The mouthfeel is a bit oily but still smooth and refreshing. The drinkability is great. I enjoy this IPA."
"One inch of dense, cream-colored foam tops the hazy, dark orange-amber liquid. There are some dark floaties in there buttressing the bottle conditioning claim. Lots of 'M's of lacing, like geese in shopping mall landscapes. Huge citrus/pine hops in the nose, some nuts below. The hops are reflected in the front, with pepper, nuts and grapefruit. A foamy middle is milky, and quite sweet. Delicious, fresh hops and tangy, ripe fruit in the finish. This is really, really tasty. A nice, sweet cream complements the fresh, bitter hops. Just a great, fresh, juicy, tasty IPA."
"This beer pours a copper hue with a medium sized white head that diminishes a little too quickly. The smell is very weak, maybe my nose is stuffed or something. Anyways, the aroma is really lacking which is weird considering how nice the 90 min smells. The taste has a nice hop consistency and hop complexity. Flavoring hops and bittering hops are both there. The flavored hops are mostly floral in taste. Malt seems a bit weak to me, there could definitely be some more malt here. The finish is very dry except for a pine needle hop flavor that lingers. All in all a good IPA, but there are better out there imo."
"Edit: Since this review, I still love this beer but have had others that are just as good if not better. Again, still a fave, but not what I once thought it was..."
"Pours with a golden body and light, thin head with all sorts of lace. The aroma is a nice blend of flowers and pine pitch, stronger than most IPAs without having any of the unpleasant ""cough syrup"" notes. Taste-wise, this beer is chock full of hops, but the hops comes through in an extraordinarily smooth manner, with some nice floral tastes, a soft bite, and a nice dry finish. My new benchmark for an IPA."
"This beer is really enjoyable. I picked up a sixer for 8 bucks alittle steep but worth it. After reading other reviews I decided to try it for myself. It had a great cloudy tanish color and the smell was nice. Light hoppiness and a smooth white head. The flavors in my mouth were refreshing and light in comparison to some other IPA's. At 6% abv it has a kick after a few. Nice all around flavor though not a very over powering aftertaste. I realy like that feirce hop bight and this beer was lacking it. Overall it is a good IPA enjoyable and drinkable. Next time I think I am going for the 120 Min IPA."
" This one tasted a little different from your typical I.P.A. There was'nt alot of oak or citrus aroma or flavor. I really liked it. It was different. Which is a good thing I think."
"Damn fine beer and my favorite IPA. Dogfish rocks."
"Another powerful offering from Dogfishead (I think they have shares in american hops companies). Really big and boisterous brew that can't leave you indifferent."
"I will definately be seeking this beer out again. Oh yeah...the price for each pint of this glorious nectar? $3.50. Can't beat that!"
"Wow! By far the best IPA I've ever sampled(pre Stone IPA). This beer manages to perfectly blend the sweet malts and bitter hops together into a wonderful flavor. Most IPA's I've had overwhelm you with the hops, which I don't care for. This is a masterpiece!!!"
"a great brew from a great brewery. pours out an amber color with a 1"" fuffy sticky white head. smell is hoppilicious with some citrus notes. Taste is awesome. one of the better ipas that i have had the pleasure of tasting. again very hoppy with some grapefruit in the back. slightly bitter aftertaste. great mouthfeel. I could drink these babies all night long. badass ipa."
"Was able to finally grab this brew at Mahars last night. The brew poured to an orange color with a nice white head that lasted for a while and broke down to a small amount of lacing. The aromas from this brew were very nice, a lot of citrus aromas that where highlighted with orange, grapefruit and then some floral tones. The taste mostly revolves around the hoppyness of the brew but you can notice enough of a malt flavor. The flavors scream hop compared to everything else going on, not the hoppiest IPA (AIPA) out there but is a fantastic representation. This is simply a very good beer and one that I am happy to have finally tried. Will be looking for this one again and hope to try it on tap soon."
"Overall: An all-around good American IPA. Recommended."
"wow, i'm impressed. i don't know if this was a fresh keg or what, but this one seemed light years better than i remember the bottled version being. imagine 90 minute without the solvent alcohol vapors and overload of sticky sweetness and barbaric hopiness, and this is what you have. balanced, with an original twist on the ipa flavor. excellent."
"Very palatable! Crisp and not heavy at all. Wonderfully refreshing especially on a warm summer afternoon."
"I guess there was no surprises that this was very hoppy, hugey piney/lychee/citrus characters. Malts aren't as evident as the hops...no surprises. Malts were nutty, lightly sticky. Lovely full flavour, rich, intense and with a dry bitter finish. Really well made and really tasty. classy, well made."
"Overall an outstanding IPA. With this category becoming saturated and somewhat predictable through the years, Dogfish finds a way to keep this ale unique and interesting. One of my favorite US hand crafted (bottled) IPA's to date."
"Pours out a cloudy orange color with a small head. One of the more cloudy IPA's I've seen yet. I could smell the beer as I was pouring it and expected a huge aroma, but when I put my nose up to it, it was suprisingly subtle. Very citrusy aroma, with a hint of fruit (some orange, peach, and grapefruit were present). Real smooth tasting. Slightly bitter, but well-balanced and not overpowering. This beer goes down very easily for a decently-strong IPA. Definitely recommended."
"A session IPA easy. Its nice to see Dogfish Head products now available in Michigan."
"The head was light and creamy, and left nice lace rings around the glass as I drank it. The bitterness came to the fore upon sipping, in a very good way. It was a nice, hoppy flavor, and yet quite smooth. A very good beer, and one I would have no problem drinking again. Good for sitting around the house and snacking on nachos or bagel bites."
"I typically prefer a larger malt backbone on an IPA, but the bitterness is so clean on this beer that I don't really miss it. It's refreshing. It'd easily go well with a snack or a pizza, and one could knock a few of these back with unconscious ease. It satisfies the hop craving without getting in the way. Every once in a while, while drinking it, you stop and think, ""This is a good beer."""
"Pale golden orange color, cloudy unfiltered body, creamy durable head, in other words the picture of a quality IPA stamped all over the pint glass. The aroma is bit fainter than most other IPA style beers, with the hops exhibiting a mellow soft character rather than an up front pine resin like aggressiveness. The taste is very bitter, bone dry, tart, and lemony, and backed by the pale and caramel malts displaying a faint butterscotch flavor. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, with a creamy effervescence. This is quite easy to drink. Thanks Foxman for the treat."
"60 Minute IPA pours a golden orange color with a nice fluffy white head that remained through most of the experience. Hops dominate the aroma with a backing of hints of citrus. Good hop flavor hits you first along with notes of pine and citric flavors. A bitter and fruity aftertaste follows the initial rush of hops. This has a medium creamy mouthfeel that fits the brew well. A good all around IPA that is very flavorfull and makes for a good sessionable brew that can still give a hophead his fix."
"I swear this beer tastes different everytime I try it. Seems much less hoppy now and a bit maltier and sweeter. This used to be my session beer, but I can barely drink 2 in a row now. Something has definitely changed in this beer from when it was first introduced. Maybe it's DFH's attempts to make this beer more balanced as that seems to be a common complaint - I can definitely smell more malt in the nose as well. The brash, bratty hoppiness that this beer used to have is what made it so appealing to me. Now it's as if the hop monster within has been tamed."
"Poured a deep luminous orange with a Sta-Puf head and a strong, sweet, kind of weedy floral aroma. Bitter yet surprisingly balanced hop and orange peel flavor with a nice crisp tongue-thickening mouthfeel and a good hoppy finish. Wasn't sure what to expect after the 90 and 120, definintely surprised by the drinkability, this stuff will own real estate in my fridge this summer."
"Pours a dark golden color with a thin white head that fades to about half a finger. Some flecks of yeast that settle to the bottom of the glass. Nose is full of spicy, piney hops, with some slight citrusy aromas as well. Taste is spicy and hoppy, with a malty/bitter finish - if I didn't know better I would say there was some wheat malt in this, since I get a little bit of tartness as well. Nice balance - am I really saying this about a Dogfish beer? A somewhat light mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable - an excellent session brew or as an accompaniment to food."
"Not as bitter as all that hop aroma and taste led me to expect."
"All in all a great, fresh tasting beer. Thanks to PSUDREW for the trade!"
"ng"
"Very nice IPA. Head is on the thin side, but it has a nice cloudy, unfiltered appearance, more like a wheat bear. Taste is sweet, hoppy, and a little bitter with some very subtle coffee flavors. A nice, complex IPA that has a new surprise on each sip. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Ok, so i bought more of this and get what everyone is speakign about. I must have had old bottles. the newer fresh 6er was creamy smooth, great mouthfeel and the hop flavors came through very nicely, and were very clean crisp and refreshing to say the least. my rating numbers will reflect this"
"I like this beer. If you're looking for a very sessionable IPA that still has good hop flavors and aroma, this could be your beer. Good stuff."
"A good session beer though, and highly recommended if you're a hophead."
"Pours a cloudy deep gold with minimal head. Wow - has a truly delicious citrusy hops aroma. Smelled this one about 8 times & complimented it twice. Absurdly fresh hop flavors everywhere. I'm loving it. Some acidity, all kinds of citrus. A full rich flavor with a nice dry bitter finish. A damn tasty IPA."
"Drinkability: Absolutely!"
"60 Minute IPA is a much better beer than my first DFH offering (Immort Ale), but that has a lot to do with my fondness for IPAs and for hops in general. This beer has a unique flavor and stakes out territory different than many other IPAs, but doesn't quite rise to the level of some of my favorites. Still though, it's enjoyable and I really am looking forward to trying its bigger brothers. Thanks to mikeys01 for the bottle."
"Pours a light bronze clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a little while. There is a good amount of lace on the glass. Smells slightly fruity and woodsy. Sweet beginning with a good amount of bitterness. Finish is somewhat fruity, but not very citrusy. Medium body, and carbonation seems appropriate. This is a pretty good IPA that I could easily enjoy several of at a sitting. Pretty solid!"
"Drinkability is very good. No nearly as good as it big brother, 90 minute, but still a hop heads delight and a quality brew from DFH."
"Slightly hazy, coppery-bronze hue with peachy/gold highlights, there is a modest amount of animation streaming upward to a white head that reached a finger in height. The retention was excellent; it slid to a foamy mess after a long moment. The subsequent lacing was rampant and very sticky. This is a lovely looking beer. The nose is hoppy like an IPA should be, the aromas are not forceful however and I like that. The hops seem to impart a mixture of good cheese and pine needles, spruce with a distant but bright note of citrus. Underneath the hops is a dull maltiness. I like the bouquet and find it inviting. However the potency is modest. On the palate the hops come across very oily, in a good way, lots of rinds and little in the way of flesh of grapefruit, there is a dry leafiness at the finish, spruce, pine needles, and more aged cheese (like Gouda?). The malt is noticeable just not very flavorful, hints of dry cookie/cracker notes with a touch of caramel. I absolutely love the arid finish, plus it has great length. Medium in body with a natural, caressing carbonation, the mouthfeel is very good and it seems a bit fuller that it really is, that is a nice touch. I bought a six-pack of this nectar in Fort Collins and I have loved every bottle Ive quaffed. Both DFH 60 & 90 Minute IPAs are fantastic beverages (120 IPA not so good) and I wish I could drink this one anytime I wanted. It is a shame I cant. This is well worthy trying, recommended."
"Overall Impression: This is the first and only of the XX-minute IPAs from DFH that I've tried. It's a luscious one. Great as an aperitif to get the tastebuds going. Though it has a hearty amount of hoppiness, it's not so much that you can't drink a few of them."
"I had tried the 90 minute before this and was very impressed so I bought a 6 of this. Although I enjoyed the 90 minute more, this is a well crafted brew. A hazy gold hue with hops scent present. Very nice aroma. This is a very drinkable IPA, not too bitter and the malts are just as present in the taste as the hops. If you prefer a little more bitter brew, try the 90 minute."
"This is an excellent IPA, but I could stand to have a lower bitterness to help the malts come to the forefront. It's quite unique in it's grain and hop choices. Still, I yearn for the infinitly more drinkable Two-Hearted as I drink this. Solid stuff."
" Very unique in flavor and aroma, in typical DFH style. I could survive for months with a few cases of the different DFH IPA's. This one is most drinkable, with its modest abv. Excellent beverage here!"
"After being impressed with the 90-minute, I am even more so with this. Easy to drink several of, my new favorite IPA."
"Taste: Ok, this is an IPA for sure. Bitter at first. Not too bitter, but just right. it's not over carbonated until the end, thats where the bubbles come up. i get hops and a little butter at the end. basically a hopped up, crisp version of the smell."
"12oz Bottle Packaged in Jan. I like the look of this IPA. A nearly clear gold with a huge snow white head that leaves lots of lacing and retains well. Has a fragrant hop aroma that is floral and slightly grassy with some fresh malt in the background. The body is medium and smooth with a slight chewiness. The flavor takes much from the aroma. Hoppy, bitter and slightly grassy with a malt that evens everything out. Leaves a lingering bitterness. Overall a very good and balanced IPA."
"Thanks to Budsboy for turning me on to this delightful brew."
"Drinkability: All day and all night. This beer practically begs to be paired with food, while possessing the character to stand clearly on it's own. One of my favorite IPA's to date."
"Drinkability: When I go out I'll have to try the new beers first, then have this one later, otherwise I won't want to stop drinking it and switch up!"
"This fine craft poured a deep orange with a decent pale head. The aroma of citrus and hops were present even before I had it in my hands. Took a drink and then another because I couldn't believe how good this is. Slight grapefruit and pine, hard hitting hops then a nice mellow caramel. Very tasty experience. The mouthfeel was slick and silky but fluffy enough to leave gracefully in time for another drink. I'm off to buy a sixer of this now."
"Dogfish Head could very well be ranked among the greatest craft breweries in the nation, but, with exception of the leagendary 90 minute and 120 minute, they have never remained consistant from batch to batch. This isn't always a bad thing, but It could be better. 60 minute IPA is one of the few beers they make that remains consistant almost every time. Its hazy orange amber colour and frothy white head is a standard that every brewer should try to achieve. Rich and beautiful. The smell of flowers rise from the glass like a spring garden, lush and full of life. The taste is of oranges and lemons with subtle hints of bitterness. It is a very well balaced beer. The hops, though they are strong and bitter to the taste, they are evenly balanced with a fitting amount of malt. It had a bit of a graininess going down that lost it some points. It could also have had a more robust taste. But they have the 90 minute for that."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs; and certainly even close to the top of my ale heap overall."
"The brew pours a pale orange ocher from the bottle, with a quickly diminishing head, but plenty of lace. The smell is sweet at first, and immediately hoppy, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors rounding it out. The piny part of the hops comes out too. The flavor of this beer is something quite beautiful. Its a perfect blend of hops, malt, citrus (lemon and grapefruit that I taste), with a subtle syrupy sweetness. The mouthfeel is something I ususally dont write that much about but this beer desreves it. It starts off with a warming bite to the back of the throat, which builds into a rising sour sweetness that grows up from the back of the mouth. It all ends with a return of the warming feeling to the throat, and leaves a nice piny aftertaste from the malts. Quite a beer."
"Dare I proclaim that this is the best IPA I've tasted? I will dare."
"I could sit and drink this beer all day. A beautiful amber color that poured a beautiful off white head which laced nicely down the glass. The hop presence is notable, but more on the nose than in the mouth. You will not be overwhelmed by the hop presence when you drink it, and I think that is what makes it so highly drinkable for the long haul. While it tingles the tongue going in, and has a very nice soft hop aftertaste, the flavor is not overpowering, and it makes you want another. And another. And another..."
"I've also had this beer on-tap and it brings out the aroma and hop flavoring VERY nicely. For that I bump it up another .5 on smell."
"As a hop head, this is a beer I can enjoy. If you shy away from heavily hopped beers, shy away from this one as it is nearly all bitter hop."
"Overall a fantastic beer and one of the top 10 IPA's in my book."
"Good stuff, this Dogfish. I'm encouaged to buy more from these fellows."
"I want to like this beer, and have an inkling that itd go great with some hearty food. Anyone have any ideas?"
"The beer pours a hazy yellowish orange color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is great. It has a very intense floral hop scent that penetrates deep. It is a thing of beauty. The taste is also great. It has a pale malt palate with some carapils malts for body, but the main focus is on the hopping. It is dominated with a floral hop character that is intense from the moment it hits your mouth to the moment it is swallowed. It has a nice bitterness to it and finishes refreshingly. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I'm almost sorry when I empty my glass. Another winner from Dogfish Head."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours out a very clear amber color, capped with a voluminous head consisting of tight white bubbles. Aroma is hoppy to the point of being almost frightening, a very interesting mix of piney hops and frsh mown grass, there's a certain sharpness to it that you don't find in most IPA's. Taste is drenched with acidic grapefruit hop flavor and a strong pine as well. There's something different in the nose and flavor that adds a certain herbal tang, that I'm still trying to put a finger on. Nice sweet malt flavor comes along mid-way through, but it cannot compete with the hops. You're left with a resounding bitterness that keeps going and going. Definitely another unique IPA from the Dogfish family, worth a try."
"From the first pour out of the glass I thought I might be in for a real treat. The copper hue shocked the wadden out of me. The smell, slightly fruity with a hint of evergreen. The thin head held on until the last sip. Now the taste, here is the big treat, a super hop bite at the start. Not too much so it burns, just the right bite. The finish is hoppy but clean. This is now my favorite IPA."
"*After burping a few times, that wood flavor really kicks in as an aftertaste. Just to let you know."
"Notes: An idea IPA to have around, very drinkable and very flavourful. With it being bottle conditioned Ill have to make this a regular in my fridge."
"good looking just slightly cloudy amber with a thick just off white head. clean piney herbal fresh hops smell. grapefruity, piney, citrusy refreshing hops flavors, almost lemony at times, not much malt balance, but it has a slight sweetness behind it that's hard to identify, maybe a it's a hint of caramel. meduim bodied and easy drinking. very enjoyable for a hophead, with a little complexity on the malt end this would be great."
"Hazy orange-copper color. Fairly low carbonation for an American-beer, which suits me to a T. Topped by a off white head. The aroma is pure hops at this point; notes of herbal-grass, orange, grapefruit, and a sharp note that I can't quite place. The beer is perhaps a bit cold at this point, so I let it warm up. The taste is nicely hoppy in all ways. It is packed with hop flavor and a nice sharp bitterness in the finish. Has a fair amount of alcohol in the finish for a 6%'er. Notes of grapefruit, and a strong flowery nectar type character are here from the hops. The hops seem to contribute some notes of pine & perhaps a hint of mint as well. This is one of those beers where your tongue just tingles from the level of hops used in making this beer. The beer is medium bodied & a bit malty sweet, which, helps to carry the hop flavor through this beer, though I think that a bit more maltiness would really help this beer to reach another level."
"I dare you to dislike this beer. you just can't. if you like beer at all this is a hit."
"Overall, great IPA."
"Can't really ask for more out of the appearance of an IPA. Perfect golden amber with a nice bit of haze to it. Very tempting. Lovely sent of Hop aroma upon first smell, again this beer just loves to be drunk. Taste does not dissapoint. Very distinctive DFH hop style, blended with just enough interesting sugars (Belgium perhaps?) to make it real interesting. This is not a complex IPA in the Avery 10 or Dreadnaught manner, but it is a very well executed ""simple"" IPA. This makes it very easy to drink it down all night long. Thank the beer gods that this beer is no longer a seasonal!!!"
"This is not the first DFH that I've had, but I've been away for a while trying other things. I decided to try the IPAs in order starting with the 60 minute and working up to the 120. The beer pours golden amber in color with a good sized head (about two inches) with a vigorous pour in a pint glass. The head is not real long lasting but the lacing is fantatic, off-white and traveling the lenght of the glass. The overwhelming aroma is that of hops. I am a hophead, and this was what I was looking for. There is a pine undertone. The taste is hop bitter with a slight pine flavor and an even smaller hint of citrus. This is a good one for hop lovers. It feels thick in the mouth with a hop and citrus tang. The carbonation is light. It is a drinkable beer, not the best IPA, but a solid entry in the market."
"Though it pours pretty into the glass, and smells great, the bottle I sampled was far too hoppy for me to be satisfied with it. There's a huge hop kick, with a really bitter aftertaste that doesn't seem to be balanced with any malts. It's like eating part of a hop pellet. It tastes nice what with the hopheadedness and all, but there's just not much else there. I can't detect much else beyond the citrusy sourness of the beer informed by the hops. Because of the high bitterness, I can't see myself drinking it continuously. Nevertheless, I do think it is an interesting experiment, a super-hoppy beer. Let's hope the other DFH's in the fridge turn out maltier."
"Nice cloudy orange real nice nose of piney and citrus hops. Good head and nice sagging lace on the english pint glass. First flavors are a sharp hop zing, pine, herbal and cutrus all mixed in a long and lasting hop side. Really nice malt body with bready and grainy notes. This beer finishes with a nice resinous pine hop flavor that is tart and lasting. Love this one."
"Pale amber coloured, minimal head, very hazy to the point of being cloudy - almost like a hefeweiss - which was not a result of a careless pour or a recently disturbed bottle; I think this may have been from the bottom of the fermenter. Aroma is flowery. Tastes strongly of hops but adequately balanced by malt; not infected as I may have presumed by looking at it. A nice beer which (at least in this instance) just looks bad."
"A little bit milder than 90 minute which is a standard in my inventory. Pours a bright yellow with a tight white head. Hop aroma is fragant and floral. Malt character is light with a nice spicy dry hop finish. Would pair nicely with a cariety of foods."
"Well out of all the ""minute"" IPA that those crazy cats down at DFH offer, this is the most balanced that they offer. There is a nice malt and hop dance and balanced offereed here. . The hop taste stands out, but there is a nice malt balance to back it up. It purs a nice dark amber color, and has little head, but leaves a nice little lace on the way down the glass. It is refereshing beer, and very drinkable, even a turn on for non-beer lovers you are looking to ocnvert, play it again sam...."
"This pours with little head at all and is an amber color. Doesn't look very carbonated at all. The smell of citrus, apple(?) and hops is very slight. I really had to inhale to get a good scent from this beer. Nothing overpowering here. Tastes hoppy and citrusy. The flavors are not as pronounced as I would expect from DFH. There is a definite hops aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. I would drink this again but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Who says theres nothing good in Delaware!"
"I have enjoyed dogfish head in the past, but after coming to the conclusion that dogfish head only makes elaborate specialty beers, I try this one. Bottom line is that there is nothing unique about this beer besides it being absolutely spectacular. Orange-gold in color with a thick white head. Piney aroma and taste with a very light malt character. Definately shows the skill that dogfish head had when it isn't covered up by insanely high alcohol or unique ingredients."
"This is a great medium beer for all occasions. All the flavors are pominent, but none overpowering. I get some mint, but only slightly adding to the refreshing nature of this beer. Amazing"
"To me, this beer is a sort of East Coast version of Three Floyd's Alpha King--a flattering comparison."
"white clinging lace over a slightly ruddy orange and barely cloudy liquid. just say yes to bubbles floating up, head retention and lace galore. shocking and strong scent, i don't even want to get close to this guy, stinky stinky. a load of hoppy scents. it actually reminded me of, among alot of other scents, of that green stuff they're going to legalize in my life time. i digress. the flavor has a slightly sweet start with orange and lemon and a bit of earth in the malt tones. this lasts for about a fifth of a second and then...kaplowee! the hops just start to take it all over. green and tart with sour, tart citrus, soapy and piney with some light woodiness. it dries up so much but it's hard to fully recover from that hop onslaught. the mouthfeel helps with some creaminess and bubbles that crisp up on the exit (from mouth towards belly) the drinkability i had to rate at 3 1/2 because it's really not for me all the time, there's alot of shit going on for me to have it more than once in a while."
"Again, it's not an equal balance, but fetching nonetheless. While it lacks the heft of its 90 Minute big brother, as well as the higher ABV, it stands well on its own merits. The hops are potent and refreshing, and while the malt is very present, it's not so strong that it makes drinking more than one or two a challenge. Emminently drinkable, it's a standby for me, with at least 2 sixers in the cooler most times, ready to deliver my hop fix. For all the presence this beer does have, it doesn't go overboard to haunt you the next day."
"Yes on tap in my basement.Peach slight hazy look. Nice thick white head on the pour, this then settles into a white marshmellow thick white sheen which laces well on the glass. Sweetish bitter hop nose. Flowery rich malt taste with a bitter hop bite in the finish. Slight fruit taste as well of peaches and a little pine tree. Sparkle on the tongue followed by slick smoothness. After swollowing the tongue dries rapidly.. A Wonderfully hoppy treat..."
"Taste is bright and lightly sweet with a pervasive hops bitterness. Tastes of freshly mown grass. Big hops throughout. Round hops aftertaste with a surprisingly light body. Somehow, the grassy flavored malt holds its own against the hops. Very smooth. Would actually be a good session beer for my tastes. A very nice, very different IPA."
"Cheers!"
"YUMBO! This may become my new favorite IPA. Especially on draft this beer takes on better charecteristics than the bottle and as it warms, the hop aroma intensifies. Very well done."
"Excellent IPA I would buy again..."
"Drinkability: Must be an off bottle or batch, as I remember this beer being much hoppier in the past. I like this beer. Try it when you can."
"On-tap at bukowski's. Delightful hazy orange copper color, dense thick head that leaves lacing after each sip. Smell is robust and of tons of hops and sugar. Taste is raw, piney and gin-like, but balanced surprisingly well by sweet malts. The sides of the glass are nearly encrusted in sugar by the end of my beer. One of the better IPA's I've had and despite the huge hop bite this guy's very drinkable."
"The draft came a cloudy pale yellow/copper. The head stood proud and laced the glass. The aroma was citrus and floral hops. The malt balance with the hops is well done and the medium body with citrus flavors melds into a bitter citrus finish. The drinkabilty is very good on this American IPA."
"The beer is copper with a small amount of lacing and some cloudiness. The smell is hoppy with some citrus deep down. The taste is hoppy with a slight malty finish - I didn't notice any smokiness myself and was glad for it. Really smooth beer in that high mid range ABV that I love. Drinkable, with a bit of a hoppy kick. This beer will make my regular rotation."
"Bottom line: This reminds me of some of the Sherlock's Home beers, which is a very good thing. A very good IPA."
"A big thanks goes to Pabobcat for the bottle!"
"Pours orange with gold trim. medium, tight bubbled lace, pretty retentive for an ipa. The nose is of fresh hops with an earthy tone underneath. Taste: hello hops. Definitely bold. Even a small taste will fill your mouth with bitterness. Although I can appreciate the fine hops, this beer does not seem very balanced. It is crisp, refreshing, interesting, drinkable. On the other hand, until I get hop fever, I will be looking for other flavors in my beer."
"Pours a nice light orange with a frothy head. Laces nicely on the glass, and the yeast suspends nicely in the beer. Floral hoppy nose with a mouthfeel that's a bit gentler than one would suspect from such an assertively hoppy beer. And I mean ASSERTIVE. Lots of hops up front, in the middle, and on the finish. Really good hops, at that. I've had 90 Minute before, but this is my first foray into the original. I'm an immediate fan, this is going to become a frequent purchase for me now."
"If you like hops till you drop it's for you, not me."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: Pours a light amber color with a medium off-white head. Fair lacing. Aroma of mellow hops and citrus. Medium-bodied and somewhat hoppy, but there really wasn't much else going on in the flavor. The aftertaste contains more of a hops bite than the beer provides initially. While pretty good I will go back to the higher-minute DFH beers."
"was able to taste this one beside both the 90 Minute and the 120 Minute. This is a pretty typical IPA. It's pretty dry with good malt backbone that's surprisingly dominated by the straw malt flavors I expect from pilsners and the like. The beer is hoppy, but not really surprisingly so. The body was a dark gold with a very faint copperish tint, and the head was an excellent white froth. The end didnt' have all that much bitterness."
"Cloudy bright orange hue, thin layer of head, decent lacing throughout. A fresh fruit and hops aroma easy to detect and quite pleasant on the nose. Up front, this is one great tasting beverage. Has an upfront dry malty base with a sticky, quenching dose of hops. Tons of flavors detected throughout; earthy, minty, grassy hop flavoring, simply incredible. Stays bitter, yet pleasantly dry throughout, medium bodied with a peppery/spicy finish. A classic, a staple, near-perfect-session-IPA, one wonderful and delicious brew."
"Straight 4's on this one,nice hazy orange color with a light sticky head,aroma is fruity and and lightly carammely.The taste is nicely balanced witha nice caramell backbone with some definent fruity/grassy hop in the forfront.A real nice quafable ale very tasty."
"In Stephen Beaumont's ""A Taste for Beer"" he includes a satirical bit about ""Beware the Hop-Head"" and speculates that hop-heads are a mutation of homo sapiens brought about by years of mega-brewery hops deprivation. He warns that a hop-head is marked by an adoration of all things hoppy, regardless of balance. Okay, I'm a mutant. Bring on the hops. This will be our national drink."
"This beer is not your traditionally hoppy beer. It tastes very unique. Must be the continual hopping. I also heard the hops are wrung out into the beer, I've seen little flecks of hops in the beer numerous times. The beer is kind of dry, but this might be the weird hop taste that gives me this impression. Really tasty."
"I love this beer! My favorite IPA so far in my quest for a ""most favorite beer of all."" Strong grapefruity, hoppy taste, and an aftertaste that is exceptional. The tastiest belch as well!!! WOW! The 60 Minute really does it for me, as opposed to the 90- and 120 Minute IPAs."
"It's all about the hops, baby - this one's loaded with a grapefruit rind and pine hop flavor that is sweet-tart-bitter almost to the point of being mouthwatering. There is some biscuity, slightly caramelly but dryish malt here, but the hops rule. Finishes bittersweet, with those bigass hops carrying through to the end. One of the best brews I've had from DFH, a fine example of an IPA."
"Initially I'm thinking this is too over the top, but after getting through half of it, I find it harder to keep from drinking it down. This is a powerfully tasty beer, you'd be spoiling yourself having it for a session, but that's one of the objectives here, finding great beers to spoil ourselves with, right?"
"Notes: Fun beer for IPA afficianados. Complexity in the hop flavor and aroma is nice."
"Drinkability...I'll have many of these..."
"Overall, a decent brew. 60 Min IPA doesn't beat you over the head with hops yet still has that hoppy bite that'll please hops-lovers."
"Cloudy light amber color, with visible setiment, quickly disappearing head. Strong hoppy fruity aroma,a taste with orange like aftertaste. Stayed bold right to the end. Makes me real curious about the 90 minute. Will recommend to my friends, especially the hopheads"
"Okay, this is the first this Dogfish style has been available in Ohio, even though it is lower proof than the other ones. This beer poured a very cloudy copper orange color(it did say bottle conditioned) with little carbonation and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. The aroma was heavy of hops, but not overpowering of one type, thereby being quite balanced. The flavor was of hops, with very little malt with a bit of a caramel aspect. The body was rather heavy/chewy for this style with the finish being astrigent yet a bit sweet. Not a bad style, maybe helped by the fact that Dogfish was doing less experimenting on this one, sometimes a good thing."
"On tap at the Great Lost Bear. Poured a yellow(in the more syrupy, lighter color catogory of IPA) and had a nice little foam white head not too much lace. Smelled sweet with a ton of grapefruit hop citrus and alcoholic peach. Taste was syrupy and heavy with tons of hops not too much malts, just a tiny touch of wheat towards the end. Loved the mouthfeel as it was velvet like. This is in the same vein as Stone IPA and Rogue I2PA in appearence and consistency, but perhaps a mite easier in the drinking catogory as it is much easier going. I would have no problem drink a bunch of these as the alcohol is not as bombastic as some of the other big IPAs. The first dogfish head I really liked."
"This IPA pours a nice gold color. A medium white head is at the end of the pour. Aromas of hops fill the air with hints of mild citrus and pine mixed in. Taste is a straight hop up front attack with a mild and I do mean mild malt flavor lingering around with an all hop finish were the citrus flavor comes in. There is a bit of a film that covers the mouth after the swallow. Nice body and easy to drink. I do admit I was expecting more from this IPA, but an above average IPA. No to find the others."
"great dry finish and crispy mouthfeel. i highly recommend this beer. even non-hopheads will like it."
"Medium orange color. Medium head. Aroma is citrusy hops. A fuller bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. The hops are very prominent and are definitely in the forefront taste wise, but its still a very well balanced beer. Nice big chewy hops. Smooth taste. Not as intense as the 90 minute IPA. Very nice IPA. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is fruity and then slightly bitter."
"Nice head that laces down the glass quite nicely. Hoppy (mint?) smell that was nice on the nose. Nicely bitter hop quality that lingers in the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel with a somewhat chewy quality. Not as good as Victory, but not bad at all. Quality offering that I recommend trying."
"Finally tracked this one down on the west coast and enjoyed it. It's orangish-gold with a big white head that leaves a slight layer on the top of the glass all the way down. The smell is interesting, a mix of hops, herbs, and malt. A nice sweetness comes through after it sits for a while. The mouthfeel is nice and chunky. At $5.99, this is quite a bargain."
"Taste was fruity and not as bitter as youd think as a big malt creates this beer. So, it comes across with a tiny sweet at first followed by a bitterness moderate in leafy flavor and parching in effect. A solid IPA in that the bitter doesnt send your mouth flying to handle crazy flavors shooting off. Overall, a simple taste with a fizzy action on the tongue, combined with the relatively thicker mouthfeel, is nice. For me, a very good IPA to have around, better to sniff than drink."
"Poured a nice, deep bronze/amber color with an plentiful pancake head that dissapated at a medium pace to a thin ever-present head. The aroma was rich with hops with a hint of what smelled like some sort of candy (butterscotch???) I noticed that when real cold, the taste was mostly of hops - a very highly hopped ale with plenty of chewy bitterness. However, when warmed up a bit this reminded me of a cross between an amber ale and a barleywine...wierd. Basically, when warmed a little bit, it starts of with a malty richness, and then gives way to a hop-powered bitter finish. Throughout the sip there is a steady candy/alcohol/earthy taste that compliments nicely and adds tons of character. A unique and lively brew with a nice kick - the previous reviewer must have had to have mislabeled brews."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. It just wasn't what I expected in an IPA."
"Overall, a solid IPA, but this one just doesn't hit the spot for me."
"This beer is very nice looking being a hazy pale amber with a nice white head that lastes a long time. The nose is hoppy and provides both citrus and earthy notes. I found the flavor to be a bit over powing with strong citrus grapefruit taste and well balanced . It seems to be over the top in its hop bite (and thats not a bad thing) and this carries into the aftertaste which is bitter and lasting. i think the hit there mark but this is not a n ipa for every body"
"Picked this up at the Harris Teeter in Charlotte (see my forum post)....what a pleasant surprise! This is the first Dogfish IPA I've tried. Poured nice and somewhat thick for an IPA, which I liked. Very little head on this one, the little that was there was ""lacy"". A nice honey/orange color in the glass, very inviting. The smell was strong and fruity. Citric came to mind when I smelled it. Very good drinkability, I could put down a few of these for sure. Has a very 'hoppy' taste, but its not too much. A very flavorful, refreshing brew that has only a slight alcohol warmth in the finish. I'll try the 90 minute next, and then (if I'm feeling brave) the 120 minute!"
"Poured with a light orange color and decent head, but was slightly cloudy with some sediment (this is a good thing). Nice hop nose, with some citrus. First few tastes showed a nice balance between the hops and malt, with the hops not being overpowering. Perfect carbonation, very refreshing for an IPA. A light malty taste lingers on the tongue. Slight lace forms on the glass with each taste, but doesn't hang around for long. This left me with a smile on my face, looking forward to trying the big brother 120 Minute IPA."
"First impressions are that the taste and mouthful doesn't measure up to the aroma. The aroma and the finish are super strong but the mouthful and taste seem to be missing something. Also, a little on the harsh side."
"Orange brew with a soapy, lingering, white head that's continuously revitalized with every movement of the glass. Aromas are a little from the hospital chest but a lot from the hop plant -- piney and strong. Understated maltiness that gets lost in the swamp of hop flavors -- a fairly potent and brutal hop assault overwhelms most of the complexities. A little creamy...medium bodied. Some of the ""lesser"" flavors -- some light citrus fruits -- came out to play as it warmed. But for the most part, this is a hop monster. The piney, sappy bitterness is the finishing note, and it lingers and lingers and lingers. It's twenty minutes after the last sip, and I can still feel the bitterness dripping from the back corners of my mouth."
"This beer is very nice looking being a hazy amber with a very nice off-white head that is very lasting creates great lace. The nose is hoppy and provides both citrus and floral notes. I found the flavor to be a bit distressing as the strong citrus grapefruit taste is quite raw and unbalanced. It seems to be over the top in its hop bite and this carries into the aftertaste which is bitter and lasting. There is also an astringency in the feel that is not pleasant. Not one of the best IPAs I've sampled."
"I would get this again, but didn't enjoy it as much right off as I did the 90 minute. Pat"
"For such a forboding name as 60 minute IPA, you'd think this beer was going to knock you down with hops. Amazingly it's quite mellow and easy drinking. Very hoppy, but not so in your face you can't drink it. Perfectly balanced and aged just right."
"Appearance would have scored higher being that it pours with a beautiful thick head and has a nice copper orange color. The head never dissipated and has champagne like carbonation keeping the head going but its flaw is that it has huge chunks of spent hops that float around in the carbonation that looks like their dancing in your glass because they never settle out to the bottom of the glass. This fish food look just doesnt do this beer justice. Smell is of hop and hops alone nothing bad but nonetheless not stellar because you cant smell the malt that you can taste. Tasted of nicely hops but was not overpowering in anyway for its series of hops infusions threw out the boil and some malt does shine threw albeit not much. Nice mouthful not creamy but not watery just right. I would definitely drink this beer again as it is very good ipa that really isnt extreme in very drinkable. Have one or two on a nice summer day to refresh with."
"A good beer, but not stellar. I'll be honest, I was expecting a little more here. Just a bit too green for my tastes."
"Notes: Blissfully distinct from your standard West Coast IPA (a style I love, btw). Reasonably well-balanced and quite drinkable; perhaps a bit too bitter for some."
"Overall a very nice unusual and flavorful ale. This is not your run of the mill American IPA (it has Dogfish Head written all over it). This IPA is about hops and nothing else. The malt is there only to support the hops and bring about a unique balance. Another one of the 100 or so must try once beers."
"There is a dark, golden color to the beer. Maybe there is a hint of orange to it. It is slightly cloudy. The head is sort of a taupe color, which didn't last long at all. Very potent hop aroma. Somewhat grapefruit-like. Really good hop bite to the taste, but yet they do not overpower you, even with the strength. Has some maltiness in the after-taste. Another great beer from these guys!"
"Finally got to try this when my Butcher friend told me it was at Trader Joe's. It poured a cloudy golden color, head was thick and lasted all the way down. Surprisingly, lacing was almost nil until the bottom part of the glass. Aroma was quite subtle. Taste profile was well balanced with hop notes being peppery rather than piney or grapefruit like. It sort of reminded me of Hop Devil. Nice mouthfeel and with the 6%abv this can be as Randy the Butcher said, a good session IPA. Very nice, but I think I like West Coasters better."
"Hazy honey color with floating particles. Off-white frothy head that dissipates very quickly, but leaves nice clingy lacing around the glass. Aroma is of floral hops, pine, and some sweet malt. Big hop flavor jumps right out. Not bitter, just big and smooth. Aftertaste is a bit piney, and a hop bitter lingers. Excellent mouthfeel, with high drinkability,"
"Overall an average IPA for the complex hop head drinker."
"A subdued relative of the 120- and 90-Minute IPAs by Dogfish Head, this is a hoppy brew in itself. The pour makes way for a deep, hazy copper liquid with a firm white head. The head sticks around for a while before settling into a small ring, leaving some lace down the glass. Aroma is like a pine forest. Notes of piney, citric, resinous hops explode at first. Very little malt can be detected in the nose. The first sip, however, shows that this IPA has more depth. The taste is definitely hoppy, full of notes of citrus and pine. A sturdy malt backbone, however, looms beneath, creating a nice balance that even a non-hophead can enjoy. Hops, though, definitely are the main event, and hop burps are prevalent long after imbibing. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but not overly so. This beer drinks fairly easily, as well. I'm glad the 60-Minute was introduced in six packs. I can certainly stand to enjoy some more."
"Orangey and lightly hazy appearance and sporting a very nice and frothy 1/2 inch head of medium duration and nice lacing properties. Resinous balsam aromas, slight sense of a light machine oil. Pithy flavors, stout piney and orangey Amarillo hops and some unfortunate phenols dominate the overall impression -- though not as huge as a Rogue Brutal Bitter. Ligher in tone and body. Malt balance is lacking, slight shortbread, but none of the malt of the 90 Minute Ale, which whacks back with sweetness. I can be in the mood for this at times, but too tipped toward Lysol for my normal IPA tastes."
"Despite the lack of overall flavor integration, this is still a well-done IPA."
"Thanks go out ot Marc77!"
"Pours a cloudy light orange/amber with a think white head. Nice lacing of the glass. Smells strongly of hops--citrusy and floral hop aromas primarily. This is matched in the taste which is dominated by a sweet grapefruit hop taste. Some malt flavors are also present. A taste of spicy hops lingers in the mouth, particularly in the dry finish. Rather complex tasting beer. Medium bodied and not particularly smooth, although still a very enjoyable beer."
"Smuggled two 12oz out curtoursy of a ""mixer sixer"". Poured a nice dark yellow with a robust head. It tasted crisp and hoppy, very hoppy but not a ""killer"" amount. It was a good blend, enticing my pallette while not running over it. A very good offering."
"Overall for me, this is an interesting beer for the hop quality alone. If anyone ever has a question as to what hop aroma and flavor is and how to detect it, point them to this beer and they will understand quick. The is no mistaking the hop flavors in this beer. They dominate it. This is the type of beer, tha for me, I would enjoy every now and then, but would'nt be a regular of mine. I really have to be in the mood for heavy hops to choose this thug."
"Very good American IPA. Certainly a big beer, and my first from Dogfish Head. I have to say, though, that in the future I will almost certainly go for the less expensive (by $3/sixer) and better (imho) Victory HopDevil."
"This is a wonderfully drinkable beer, despite the big body, probably due to its being balanced by a very fresh-tasting, crisp hoppiness. I think I'll have to get me some more of this soon!"
"Although this isn't an over-the-top beer in the way other DFH brews are, the 60 Minute IPA is surely one of the best standard IPAs put out by any brewery in the country."
"Wonderful hop aroma first off ! This is what I call an IPA.Cloudy gold in color with a great appearnace.Head retained much leaving some lacing.Creamy rolling mouthfeel that goes down easy.This was exceptional and had to be the second best IPA I've ever had.I could drink alot of these.Bitterness wasnt too much or prolonged.Strong smell of hops that was a pleasure to the nose.If you don't like alot of hops stay aweay from this one."
"Auburn hue, with dry hop derived polyphenol haze. Topped by a vanilla white, creamy, persistent head. Tattered lace remains. Pungent, bright, capricious wafts of chlorophyll laden spruce tips and tangerine zest are in the forefront aromawise, and are accompanied by a struggling contrast of light lovibond caramel malt. A delightful baleful of hops! Flavorwise, malt character is slightly more apparent, being comprised of a lightly honeyish, perfumed nature and serves to complement the dominant floral and resinous pine hop flavor well. Hop bitterness is surprisingly restrained, but since residual sweetness is minimal due to the high apparent attentuation, the overall character is dry. A tinge of bubblegum emerges mid palate, but is quickly tapered by a lingering suggestion of hopped rosewater. Lightly bodied, and mildly dextrinous, lending a crisp mouthfeel conducive to quaffability. Finishes clean, with fleeting bready base malt sweetness and muted citrus zest. A delicious, relatively well balanced IPA. Not overly assertive in hop bitterness, but redolent of American hop bouquet and rich in oily hop flavor. Unique and superbly drinkable."
"It poured a nice medium dark yellow with not a lot of foam. The smell is what warned me of what was to come. The aroma was like smelling a bunch of pitch on a pine tree. I had this kind of beer before. First taste told me that I had a heavy tasting pine tree. The first and last taste of this beer was like I was chewing on pine needles and pitch, combined. The second sip never reached my mouth, instead it was poured down the drain!"
"60 Minute is a wonderful session IPA (as Sam suggests), but without the real kick of the 90 Minute. Better than many IPAs, but oddly, not quite as complexa little bit is lacking in the mouthfeel and in the potential malt-based complexity. However, if youre looking to understand the flavor of hops (specifically Warrior, Amarillo and Mystery Hop X), then this is the quintessential starting place. 60 Minute is a lovely showcase of the reason that so many people drink better beerbehold the power of HOPS!"
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The 60 pours a copper/orange color that is just a little bit hazey. There is 1 finger of head that dies down a bit quickly, but there is good lacing. The only thing I can really detect from smell is hops. The smell is very potent. The taste isn't as hoppy as the smell. It has a good balance for an IPA, a bit of ginger in the taste. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy. Good drinkability too, and at only 6%, this is one IPA to enjoy several of in a night."
"The 60 minute IPA pours a hazy honey color, w/ a medium white head. The nose is chocked full of hops. On the six pack container was a note from DFH quoting Lew Bryson to the effect that this beer is the closest thing to a cask conditioned ale that you'll find in a bottle. Well, having gone to a cask conditioned (ie: 'real ale') fest yesterday, I'd have to agree. Beautiful hop flavor w/ a creamy finish makes this a world class IPA in my book. Also, this is the ultimate session beer."
"Appearance: Pours a hazy golden color with amber/orange highlights, the head is off-white in color with decent retention and good carbonation. On the nose the aroma of pine needles, citric, and fresh cut grass. On the palate the taste is sharp with citric bite, pine needles, highly hoppy, and some light fruity flavors as well. Nice IPA"
"Well, TJs Chapattis are absolutely crap  my Curry was absolutely superb (pat on back), and the DFH 60-min IPA was an excellent accompaniment to this Anglo-Ameri-Indian dish. Only $5.99 for 6 x 12fl.oz. Bottles  What a Bargain!! I better go and stock up because this baby is going to the fluid partner to my hot n spicy home-made Curries for some time to come."
"Hazy light copper color, creamy off white head, pine and citrus in the nose, resiny pine flavors, medium body has a crisp carbonated feel on the tongue, sharp bitterness in the finish, seems a little bit rough, not as good as I expected, still not bad."
"Pours a somewhat amber gold color. No head but nice lacing all the way down. Big,bold hop aroma-quite grassy. Big,upfront and bold hop flavor. While very bitter it doesnt make you pucker like mad. Nice malt sweetness blended into the hops. Great body-has a nice,velvety oiliness. A killer beer-an IPA on steroids."
"This beer pours a yellow/golden color with small head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma was a very citrusy and piney hop. Very strong hop aroma, but has a nice caramel malt backing. The flavor has that same citrus and pine hop flavor in it, but it's more mellowed, letting the malt character come through for a great balance. The finish is slightly bitter, but it also leaves a bit of caramel flavor around for the palate. This is a great American IPA. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I'm probably in the minority in that I haven't been wildly impressed with a few of Dogfish Head's products. However, this isn't one of them. Finally got a chance to try it and found it thoroughly enjoyable. Liked the hazy orange color and the firm head and found the smell to be both strong and pleasing. Best of all, the earthy, hoppy bite of the product was what I would expect from a top IPA yet that aspect of trhe flavor profile wasn't so dominant as to unbalance the product. No unusual aftertaste. Haven't yet had the 90 Minute IPA but it must be quite a product to outdo this one."
"Served up nicely with an orange haze look to it. Nice, white head. The aroma was incredible, as you can smell the hops, and a hint of fruit that to me resembles apricot or a citrus variety. The taste was very good. Has a bit of a kick to it, but also a smooth, hoppy fruit flavor going down. Carbonated, but also easy to drink. Just an all-around great beer with great characteristics and flavor. Highly reccommended. Enjoy!"
"pours a hazy orange with a healthy head that lasts for almost the entire duration of the beer. smells very earthy/bready. hops are obviously quite apparent in taste and smell. there are hints of alcohol in the taste as well. quite carbonated but also quite smooth at the same time. ipa's are generally among my least favourite brews but i quite enjoyed this one. a solid brew from a solid brewery."
"Pours a hazy light rust color with a thick and creamy white head that leaves spider webs of lace behind as it slowly recedes. Nose is fresh raw hops blended with some piney and citrusy medicinal aromas. Medium to full in body with a soft natural carbonation. Taste is raw hop leaf flavors and green grassy notes followed by a bit of grapefruit rind and hop tannins, and yet at no time are the hop flavors too overpowering. A very fine beer that would make for a great session IPA. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"
"Poured out a slightly cloudy golden orange color and was topped off with a creamy white head. Pungent grassy and floral in the aroma. Nice ""Earthiness"" to the beer. Strong bitterness matched up with a hidden malt sweetness. Getting some nice spicy, almost peppery flavors and the alcohol is well hidden here. A very good IPA and very drinkable."
"I was a little reluctant to try it, but I'm glad I did. It smelled like pine rosin and fresh pot(not that I would know what that smells like). The taste was complex. Had a bite to it, but it quickly died down into a piney taste. It covered my mouth pretty well and left no bad aftertaste. I wil lgo out and say this is by far the best IPA I've ever had. This is yet another great brew from the one of the best breweries ever!"

"This beer poured a golden color that was slightly opaque but carbonation was noticeable. The head that was created was white in color and the texture was creamy, sticky, thick, foamy, dense, and long lasting. It left good lace behind, spotty in areas but over all nice. The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh hop leaves (cascade I believe), floral hops, citrus, sweet malt, caramel, fresh grass, pine needles and a slight bread dough. Mostly hops but as the temperature rose slightly the other aromas became noticeable along with the hops. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of hops  slight bitter, floral, citrus  fresh and dried hop leaves, fresh cut grass on a warm thick Saturday morning, sweet malts, caramel, pine needles, lemons and grapefruits, alcohol and bread. The after tastes were of fresh hops and slightly bitter when first pulled from the fridge and tasted, it got progressively creamier and sweeter as it got warmer, but still hopped. I would say that the flavors of this beer are 94.5% hops and 5.5% everything else. If there be truth in labeling then this beer should be called 45 minute IPA because I swear it took 45 minutes for the hop taste to finally leave my tongue. Even when I exhaled I tasted hops. Amazing. Very good beer, another hit from DFH."
"Pours a deep golden amber color with a thick, creamy off white head. There is a bit of haziness with a few floaters in the beer as well, but it is bottle conditioned. The aroma is an absolutely tantalizing floral smell, backed by a nice malt sweetness. The taste is smooth, and suprisingly balanced. The first thing that I noticed was the malt backgorund, but it is supporting a heavy load of hops. Nice, even bitterness throughout with a bit of a piney-citrus note. A wisp of sweetness licks the tongue on the aftertaste, but the hops steal the show. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with perfect carbonation. The carbonation is integrated so well into the overall experience I had to think about the carbonation. I love when that happens. This beer is supremely drinkable, and I must get a lot more of this soon. An oustanding beer from DFH, perhaps my favorite of their offerings."
"Nothing subtle about this IPA, or for that matter, any Dogfish brew. Very close to the 120 sans the ridiculous alcohol kick. Deep cloudy gold with white foamy and fizzy head and some sticky doily type lace. The aroma is mostly strong hops with a bit of alcohol. A medium amount of sweet doughy malt and very highly hopped with strong metallic and grapefruit peel bitterness. An In-Your-Face-Strong, wild and raw tasting brew."
"Decent head, but beautiful color. A light orange/amber, and not too cloudy. Smells very hoppy. After smelling it long enough, you can image little bubbles floating into your nose and popping. the aroma lingers for a long time. tastes very complicated. a mite bit bitter."
"I was pulling for this one. It sounded interesting but this whole sharp ""green"" thing is just not appealing to me. Perhaps some more aging will improve the character of this one."
"'Thank you' goes out to Davo for sending me this one."
"After tasting a million other IPA's, this one reawakens the senses. The first thing I thought of when I first put this to my nose and lips was 'green'. It just reeks (literally) of green, grassy, spicy, minty, hops. Obviously, with a 60-min. addition, the whole spectrum of the hop is taken care of, bitterness, flavor, aroma, no gaps. I won't say it's nicely balanced, but there's enough going on otherwise to keep it going. A little yeast bite actually gets through , too. Nicely done, I'm going to get another..literally..right now.bye."
"The bottle pours a yellow-gold body with a light orange cast. It's quite hazy, but then again, it is bottle conditioned and loaded with hops. The case advertises that with the funny line, ""New Chunky Style""! There was no yeast left at the bottom of the bottle so I assume that with some longer cold storage it might clear a bit. It brings up a creamy off-white head which drops to a thin surface covering; holds well throughout the glass; and leaves some thin lace. But the aroma is brilliant! It's just like opening a large bag of fresh whole flower hops - pungent, grassy, floral, lightly minty and a touch citrusy. In the mouth it's medium body and fine, natural carbonation combine to gently caress the tongue before warming to become creamy and smooth. A rich malt balances the hop flavors nicely, and the bitterness is solid but well within reason. It starts with a bright note of lightly sweet, citric, floral, and leafy/grassy hops; followed by some more earthy/minty/resinous (but not quite piney) flavors as it crosses the palate; and finishes with an incredibly long-standing fresh hop flavor and a muted, drying bitterness that rises as the residual malts receed. Overall, it's quite soft and round, avoiding the brash character of many ""Imperial"" IPA's; and it's alcohol is also well concealed within it's big flavor and aroma. Very nicely done with a surprising amount of drinkability. Well worth trying!"
"Thanks to my man ElGuapo for the bottle."
"Drinkable, and extremely enjoyable. It was a little too intense for a few of my friends, but any hop head will love this one."
"Yes... I could drink this beer all night... if I didn't need more hops! Time to drink a 90 minute IPA?!"
"It is very floral and spicy. It is not simply overloaded with hops, but it does have quite a bit of hop presence to say the least. The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish. It starts crisp, and I would like it to stay that way, but the carbonation dies as soon as it hits your tongue. This is one I could have a few of, but it may be hard for anti-hopheads to handle. A fine brew in my book."
"Many thanks to the Almighty Shit for this sample. Thanks for the effort Senior."
"F."
"Golden amber with a nice head. Sooooooooooo smooooooooooth! Hoppy as an IPA should be. Not as over the top as the 90 minute. Very well balanced. A bit of a citrus bitter is in there with a nice dry malty taste. Certainly, any IPA fan should try this brew."
"Recommended, and my choice for a DFH flagship brew. I'll have to revisit this soon."
"My bottle was kept and served a little too cool so I had to let it sit for a bit. It started out pretty ugly. The beer itself was a very cloudy light amber orange, but the hazy lifted significantly as the beer warmed up. The head was coarse and quickly reduced to wisps. The first flavor that jumped out at my wasnt hop related but rather a faint smokiness. Besides that, there werent any surprises. Wood and grapefruit aromas dominate the nose as well as the palate. As one would expect, the hop bitterness is more restrained in this one and the emphasis is more on the other aspects of the H. lupulus. The role in the malt cut back as well. I think I like the 90 minute IPA better, because IMO this played more like a West Coast PA because of the thinner body and malt contribution."
"The most balanced out of the 60/90/120 Min. series, IMO."
"In ever lightly lacey head i sappealing, but I am thinking flavor and aroma all the way. A great beer to try, but beware. Hopheads only need apply. A very good brew. Prost!"
"If you like hoppy IPA's I highly recommend this one. I didn't find it as bitter as other brands and felt it was quite drinkable."
"Pour is slightly cloudy ornage golden, big pure-white head, strongly clinging lace. Aroma is citrus hops, slightly sweet maltiness, grassy, some herbal tones. Flavor is lightly malty to start, then some herbal/grassy notes, then bitter and citrus from the hops. Medium body, hints of spiciness, medium carbonation, and good lasting flavors."
"5/10/03: Much improved. Better head and smoother carbonation, with a much more harmonious flavor profile. Fruitier, maltier and much more enjoyable. As a bottle-conditioned ale, it'll probably be even better at 6 months. Obviously too green through initial 4 bottles."
"Nice golden yellow brew with a slight haze to it. Small white foamy head. Smell is very hoppy with a good whiff of barley in there. The citrous zing of the hops is definitely there, followed by the taste of freshly harvested grains. (wheat or barley? can't say i've ever tried either). This is very tasty considering the lower ABV, and I prefer this to the 90 minute IPA because you can put 'em down all night without getting wasted. There is more taste in this brew than any 6% beer i've had, making this the ultimate session brew. Good full mouthfeel, with a nice dry finish."
"Holy mother! This is hands down the best IPA I have ever had the peasure of drinking. While I was not very impressed with the 90 Minute IPA, the 60 Minute IPA is simply superb. Amazing pine hop smell that is possibly the best smelling beer ever. Nice orange creamy pour with a slight head. Beautiful hop taste that I believe is pretty bitter (although others do not find it very bitter). After tasting this, it will be hard to ever find another IPA as good. Also, I NEVER give a beer a 5 all the way around and this one gets it for sure. Perfect beer!"
"Who knows what was wrong with my taste buds last night? I am just glad that I gave this beer another try. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: So smooth and easy to drink. Very easy on the palate. No problems finishing this one. Not a disproportionately-hopped beer. Crisp and clean finish. Ranks just slightly behind its big brother."
"I have had the 90 minute IPA on cask and it is my favorite IPA in the world, so when I saw the little bro on cask at the Sharp Edge I couldn't turn it down. Appears a copper hue with a tannish biege, silky smooth head. Very nice full foam, with lace adhesion going in in my pint glass. The aroma is a full upfront floral hop aroma with citrus and pine tones, very nice malty complement going on here. A well balanced hop and malt combo make up this very refreshing appetizing session IPA. Very smooth on cask and not too hoppy, due to the fact that enough malt sweetness crashes upon the palate to tame the bitterness. A pronounced piney hop character, amazing offering from the folks at Dogfish Head. Smooth and creamy almost feels as smooth as if it were on nitro, with a medium to light body, a worthwhile beer!! Very smooth and drinkable welcome to paradise my fellow hopheads."
"Had this on tap at Chalkies recently... what a great IPA this is! Clear and copper with a thin but persistent white head. Leaves rings of lace all the way down the glass. Has a sweet citrusy aroma with some buscuit and caramel mixed in. Flavor begins sweet, a mixture of maltiness and sweet hop oil, then becomes fruity, with orange and grapefruit notes, and finishes bitter. The balance of flavors is exquisite. Medium body and carboantion... smooth and slightly oily mouthfeel. This might be as close as you can get to a session IPA."
"On tap, it's very different than bottled, bigger head, more aroma. Good golden, slightly orange color, and a good mouthfeel. A bit of a bite with the hops, but still not over powering. The finish for me was smooth and creamy, well balanced with a good hop aftertaste. Excellent beer."
