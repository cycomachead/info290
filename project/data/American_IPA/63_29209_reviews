"The second IPA I have had from Deschutes, and it definitely lives up to the expectations I had. It pours a cloudy, dark reddish amber color with a big frothy head. The smell has lots of pine, citrus, and some other fruityness i can really pinpoint, theres also quit a bit of malt aromas. The taste reflects this aswell, and has a fairly balanced taste, and it also has what I can only describe as spicy flavor to it. Overall a really tasty somewhat unique beer, I haven't had an IPA that has tasted anything like this one."

"O: A very drinkable IPA with a good balance between malt and hops."

"O: A fairly typical Northwestern IPA, but also a really strong representation of its style. This is the kind of IPA that is capable of reminding longtime fans of the style just how nice a clever balance of malt and hops can still be. Recommended to established fans of the style and IPA neophytes alike."
"Great citrus scent. Smooth drinking Ipa. Not quite Fresh Squeezed but still a very solid IPA"

"First sip at Deschutes Brewery 2011 with Guillermo."

"The best deschuttes ipa, and that's saying a lot."
""
""
""
"it's an ok ipa, too much malt not enough bitter bite for me. mild cat pee aroma."
"Good, not great APA.  Nice hop / malt balance.  Still doesn't quite meet expectations."
"3/7/15 (Bottle) - Nice copper beer with good texture and a rich white foam. Strong citrus and lemon scent, with noticeable hops aroma. Flavor is full and tart, crispand smooth texture and easy to drink. Overall good IPA offering."
""
"This is an IPA for the masses, but since it is from Deschutes, it is a bit better than average (just a bit). Deschutes, you can do better than this."
""
""
""
"A little too bitter at the end for me."
"Overall: I remembered having this from a Deschutes variety pack over the summer and liking it a lot. This one doesn't quite match the memory, but it is still a pretty solid IPA. If I had a complaint it is the  slightly off flavors towards the finish that combine with the bitterness. This sample was a bit past the best by date so I will have to try to find a fresher one to see if I feel any different about it."

"[poured from a bottle into a pint glass. poured first few ounces straight down to enhance the head, then let it sit a few minutes to settle, finally poured the rest down the side tilting the glass at a 45 degree angle]"
"Overall, this is probably our favorite year-round offering from Deschutes.  What is most striking is how “fragrant” everything is.  We keep coming back to that word, even when describing the flavoring.  It is either the translation itself, or the hop varietals themselves, that lend to this curious effect.  You feel almost like you’re breathing through your tongue, absorbing subtleties from the air.  They take all of the bitterness of the west coast and pack it into this tiny beer.  Again, this is especially visible through the flavoring, as you get this heavy, hard-hitting bitterness of hops that lingers forever.  It makes the mouth water.  This is funny, in a sense, because it seems all the hops here are dried, pellet form.  They taste just like those hops you get in the beginner brewer kits, but a bit more souped-up.  Maybe this beer is so approachable because it feels like the best beer you could ever make from those kits.  Like, you could do it yourself, if you reached your maximum potential of home brewing in this realm.  This is obviously a bizarre comparison, but something we thought of nonetheless.  This is fantastic, and should be considered a must-try for any true lover of the style."
""
"Overall: Nice hoppy, kind of strong beer. Not bad but not a go to beer. That is a personal opinion and taste."
""
""
""
"O: Despite the recovered fumble on the taste, overall this is a solid IPA and I look forward to trying it again in warmer months"

"Nice IPA.  My local wing place had it on draft.  Tall frosted mug.  This was a godsend compared to the Coors Light etc on the menu.  Not top tier, but good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very good brew. Just not the IPA's im used to. A bit to floral and outright fruity to make its way into my line-up. the amazing well balance between malts and hops (sweetness and bitterness) is unlike any other."

"Love the amount of hops in it. I get it every time I see it on tap."
"I'll still have to try a few more time to get the real story but seems very solid."
"This is a very middle of the road ipa and a good introduction to non craft drinkers. Its also the IPA that got me into IPA's."
""
""
"Solid IPA. Mother color is a deep, brownish Amber and the head is soapy and white.  Fresh and piney hop aroma, some background citrus.  Full bitterness and hop flavor in the taste...lots of intensity.  Malt is there, but is behind the hops.  Lingering finish.  Warming underneath, and the beer could sneak up on you.  Nice."
""
"OVERALL:  this is a very good IPA, it's more balanced than most but there is no mistaking this is an IPA, it's definitely sweeter on the front end than most and that really compliments the hops, this is my second beer from Deschutes and I'm really impressed so far, they make beer like I would make beer.....balanced.  I would buy this again without hesitation."

"The aroma of this beer, freshly poured into a pint glass, is delightful.  The coloring is a lovely amber, and the initial flavoring is strong and hoppy.  There is a bit of bite to it, not overpowering, but it stays with you for a spell.  It is very much a strong IPA, the only knock is the slightly bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""

"Floral, grapefruit, lemon and tangerine on the nose. It pours a deep amber color with a slight beige head. Medium bodied, it finished very clean which built anticipation for every sip of this lovely brew high. On the palate there were sweet crystal malts, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime slight pineapple and green apple. Those IBUs were balanced nicely and this was a fantastic IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Paired well with brauts at Gustavs at PDX."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, the only thing stopping me from giving this a 5 is that it is hard to say anything is perfect, especially since IPA's vary so much but this about as close to perfect an IPA that I have had; try it!"
""
""
""
""
"Heavy, full taste."
""
""
"O- Overall this is a decent IPA.  I really like bottle conditioned IPAs and the breadiness of the mouthfeel really comes through that."

""
""
"Strong and smooth semi-bitter IPA"
"Overall (3.9): Picked up the variety pack, and this was my first choice. This one definitely falls into the piney ipa category. Its tasty, but it was a little all over the place for me and the individual tastes didnt quite match each other. It is a good ipa, but not a great one. Looking forward to trying the rest of these beers in the variety pack"

"This IPA poured as a dark golden trending towards amber.  And if you know Ambyr you know that ain't all bad.  The head on it (the beer, not Ambyr) was firm and looked like dirty straw. This IPA has a good  flowery smell that you expect from an IPA.  The taste was very grassy - or maybe that was because i had just finished mowing the lawn. The bitterness stayed a bit too long for my taste so i marked this down on the feel and on taste."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- A pretty good IPA that tastes a lot more East Coast than West Coast.  Pretty big malt bill on this one and lots of citrusy sweetness and much lighter on hop bitterness for the style."
"D not to be Trifled with - this is a serious brew. @ 6.8 the buzz comes on quick"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a very good standard IPA.   Very much a ramped up version of Mirror Pond."
""
""
"O: Was worried the hops might have faded out of this bottle as this bottle is about a month past it's best by date. Nope! Big in your face IPA. I can only wonder how much stronger it is fresh."

"O:  Fantastic, approaching a DIPA in strength.  Reminds me of DHF 90, but, well, more refined than 90 min.  Really nice IPA."
"D: A decently complex IPA.  I like the strong hop notes, but others have done that with less bitterness. (3.5)"

"O - Nice complexity.  The fruit notes as well as the heavy body thew me off initially but they work well and the hop bitterness is balanced, mostly, by the sweetness.  3.75/5"

"Overall this beer really reminds me of when my friends and I would attempt to down Torpedoes in high school. I got that first initial super piney shock of hops on my first couple sips of this six pack, brought back a lot of memories. And to think now I knock these guys back no problem"
""
""
""
"Overall: A good IPA with just a hint of hop resin feel but not cloying.  Well balanced and will give hopheads their fix."

"Briefly... looks to die for - golden amber body, pillowy head, and more lace than on a Bride's dress. Muted aromas, but taste is better. More East coast than west with a nice malt backbone stopping it being a Citrus ' n' Pine fest. No dominant citrus flavour but quite dry overall. Solid effort if not outstanding."

"I really enjoyed this IPA. Descheutes Never let's me down with their beer. It has a nice honey golden color. Smell is of a hoppy nature but not overbearingly hoppy. I like my beers super hoppy which would make this one perfect for a none Double IPA sipper. Taste is nice when it hits the palate. Little floral note with a nice amount of bitterness. Smooth going down without the syrupy feel you get from some IPA's. Throughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely drink again!"

"Not quite as bitter as it could have been, feels a little heavy as well."
""
""
""
""
"Not much on bouquet and I'm not sure why as the rest of the beer is great. Nice head, lacing of foam down the glass, copper colored, good malt and not overly hoppy. A mild, slightly orange flavored hop. Again, good beer, can't go wrong, good quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Inversion IPA is another solid offering from Deschutes. The beer poured a clear copper with white head. The scent had fresh hops that were more floral leaning. The taste was a nice combination of floral, pine and citrus. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a solid beer and could be sessioned."

"Poured from a 12 oz into my snifter. Fresh by 10/30. Nice mahogany tone with a finger of slightly off-white head. Decent retention. Piny/grassy and very clean smelling. Nice note of citrus (mainly grapefruit) with a little bit of concentration. Off the top, nice bitterness, almost perfect bitterness... strong malt backbone and pine, pine, pine. Yum. Light to medium body, not oily or sticky, and a clean aftertaste. Overall, this drinks like a much bigger IPA. Fantastic standard setting IPA fro Deschutes."

"Final Word: Great flavors in this beer, but the strong hop presence in the finish makes it a bit too potently bitter for the drinker that doesn’t love hops. There’s a lot of citrus and malt character, so it still sits in much better balance than many IPAs, and isn’t an IPA that only hop heads can get into. However, you need to be pretty familiar with hoppy beers and hop flavors to enjoy this one, or else the intense, dry bitterness on the finish is going to turn you away. If you already love IPAs, this beer will definitely satisfy and is worth picking up if one of your favorites isn’t available. I’ve had better IPAs, but they are some of the best around, so this beer still sits high on the list."

"This IPA has left a huge impression on me. It veritably gushes with hop dankness."
""
"O: huh... this actually tastes like a pine forest, granite, crystal waters... bet it pairs well with Oregon... is there such thing as a ""Northwest IPA""? - just saying, this could be a benchmark for such a style... had this for the first time at the brewpub in Bend last year - second time having it here - think I'll have it some more!"

"The first sip of this beer brought me a lot of typical citrus notes from the hops. I experienced some slight sweetness from the malt which was followed by pine-bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied. The head was a off faint khaki color about an finger worth. It smelled of citrus, and slight bread notes from the malt. I purchased this on a whim after deciding to put back their obsidian stout which I like. I figured i'd try something else from the brewery. Overall, I am not disappointed. I can't say I would go out of my my way to get another sixer of this, but it will be on my mind when in a pinch, given that it was 7.99 at the store. I would recommend this to those who are looking for a session IPA that still want hops, but not too much and would rather not have a lower tier ipa (i.e. long hammer, etc.) The 6.8 abv puts it a slight notch above your standard session brew, so beware of that."

"almost clear copper color, with cream colored head. good head retention and lacing. aroma is hoppy, a mix of herbal and a little citrus. taste has a nice balance of bready malt flavor and bitter hop bite. starts a little sweet, finishes more dry. medium body and carbonation, slightly sticky feel."

"Went with a shaker pint glass on this one. Served into the glass out of the bottle. Color is amber to copper. Off-white head (picture aged paper). Very good clarity. Numerous bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The head had some rolling irregularities to it (not 100% uniform but not what I would call rocky). Aroma definitely had hops, but it was more delicate and less assertive that some IPA's I have had. That is not a criticism of this beer by any means. Very fresh, clean, fruit, hops smell. The head persisted thinly to the bottom of the glass. I think I know why they call this ""Inversion IPA"". Not a dry beer. The hops play the large role, but the maltiness is a close second (an inversion of what I am accustomed to). Lots of deep raisiny, plummy flavors, and in the finish (inhaling deeply after I put down the glass) I'm getting peach yogurt. Very interesting. The lacing in the glass was well banded showing everywhere I paused between sips. I will definitely come back to this one."

"Post Review Note: sampled Anderson Valley Spring Hornin 2 days after initial review, and liked better, so have downgraded overall accordingly. Post Post Note: having just had Loose Canon IPA right after the Spring Hornin (however skewed tastebuds may be), feel Inversion aftertaste the WORST of the 3."
""
""
"O - Even with a month left before Deschutes deems Inversion no longer satisfactory, I can't imagine what's in my bottle is what they intended the beer to taste like. While the beer isn't bad (and they do label it ""balanced"") it's not hop forward enough, especially in aroma. The building blocks are clearly there, just not quite put together yet, or should I say, they've fallen apart."

"Very full-flavoured stuff."

""
"Overall this is a very good IPA, and again, it is a great value. I do like more tropical-leaning IPA's with bigger malt (truly I prefer IIPA's), but I liked this and would get it again."

"12 oz. bottle from trade. Been wanting to try this one for a while now. Pours a beautiful clear amber red with a one finger off white and very creamy head. Looks like an amber. Aroma of pine, grapefruit, floral bouquets, some other orange citrus rind too. Flavor had a nice caramel and bready malt presence, a nice bit of bitter pine, some citrus character. Insanely drinkable and very nice, leaning more toward the APA style than IPA. Light to medium bodied, slightly resinous, with medium plus carbonation. A really nice every day type of beer that I would love to have available locally."

"So excited to finally be tasting Deschutes offerings. Thank you Ohio. This beautiful ale pours a rich reddish copper color with a substantial off white head that gives way to a nice film and handsome lacing. The aroma is hoppy and bitter with notes of pine, grass, tropical fruit, and citrus. This ale sips very smooth and easy (I could get in trouble with a sixer of these). The flavor is a spectacular blend of hops and malt. Slightly sweet on the front end and then crushingly bitter on the tail. This is a very underrated ipa that should be more recognized as the awesome ale that it is. Can't wait to try more from this brewery. If anyone from Deschutes is reading this; please come to Michigan soon."

"Overall - A overall nice beer. Its a little sweeter then your standard ipa. Smooth, easy to drink, a nice ipa for someone that wants some hops, but doesn't want all the bitter, bitey fruits, and wants a little caramel malt sweetness. Glad there now in ohio, I will drink this again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too bitter at the finish for my liking. The aroma was awesome, but the citrus fell through in the flavor. Malt support couldn't counter the bittering."
""
""
""
"This is a solid IPA. It's good and does what it's supposed to do. It might not be one that I'll dream about, but I can appreciate it."
""
"Inversion IPA has the balance that I more readily expect from Amber Ale but it has the drinkability of Pale. Regardless, its hop aroma, flavor and bitterness needs to be much more of stand-out character to really satisfy the taste for IPA."
""
"Overall, this first weekend of Deschutes in Ohio was nice. They may have been a tad overnhyped, but I think I will buy some of these again."

"First time I've had this stuff, my good pal Geoff Landgraf used to work in Bend, OR at Deschutes, I would get specialty releases monthly sent via beer mail. Now, fast forward to 1/24/14 Deschutes has launched in Ohio with their four main stays Inversion IPA, Black Butte Porter, Mirror Pond Pale Ale, and Red Chair Pacific Northwest Ale along with Hop Henge IPA one of their fantastic specialty releases. A fantastic introductory IPA that can be enjoyed by the masses and those in the know when it comes to hops. Complex drinkable and definitely hoppy enough to be one of the stand out IPAs from the Pacific Northwest. Abundant hops in this beautiful glowing amber body big billowing cream colored head leaves intricate speckled lacing on the sides of my glass. Aromatics give out hints of pine, citrus, with dank earthy hops. Flavor has a well crafted malt backbone hints of bready/caramel malts without hitting overt sticky sweetness. Really nice IPA, I'm ready to drink another bottle it's that type of beer. It will blown your mind how good a solid stable IPA can be and it's probably a majority of the reason this company has grown beyond the PNW to the state of Ohio along with the fact that I've never had a bad beer from them. Texture slightly resinous with hop oils and flowing carbonation carries the beer great over the palate. Overall, this works so well. I'm a fan of Inversion and every other hoppy ale from them that I've tried!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an old-school, balanced IPA and not a hop bomb. The flavor reminds me a little of Sierra Nevada's beers. There's that sharp, resiny hop flavor, lots of grapefruit, and a nice malty sweetness underneath. This beer would go well with many kinds of food. It could stand up to spicy foods and wouldn't overpower milder foods too badly."
""
""
"O - Good IPA and now in Ohio so I will surly try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O-this beer has an outstanding hop flavor and I enjoyed it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable IPA. I like the aroma of this beer the best. It is a little on the sweet side which balances the hops very nicely."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's okay, but it's a little syrupy for my IPA tastes. Also I think the hop flavor, while quite present, is 1-dimensional."
""
"This is one of my go to IPAs. Sipping one of these at their brewpub while hitch hiking through Bend was a highlight for me as a beer drinker. This was the beer in fact that got me into IPAs in the first place. Drink up! And do visit the brewpub if youre ever in or near Bend!"
""
""
""
"Very drinkable - a lot going for it and one that you could drink a lot of. Not the best IPA on the market but very soild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well balanced and tasty. It does have a homebrew quality to it ... meaning flavors arent as integrated as I would expect."
""
""
""
"Great beer overall, needed to have a few times before I really appreciated it, will have again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, fine stuff, but not remarkable in any way. Although this is being consumed prior to the BB, it is close. Might be that this would be better fresher - but Deschutes does not distribute to Ontario (generally), and beggars cannot be choosers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Inversion is just a joy to drink. The nose may be a bit on the light side, but the palate delivers everywhere it matters, balanced and clean, citrusy, not overly bitter. This is an IPA to contemplate life and the pursuit by."
""

"Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown, with a big, fluffy light tan head. Massive lacing that sticks to the glass as the beer travels down it. Really nice looking. Aromas of stone fruit and a bit of grass. Taste begins with a big dried apricot flavor, then some dark caramel, then some pine, and an herbal bitter finish. Rich mouthfeel. Overall a very good IPA, though I typically prefer IPA's to be drier."

"Got a six-pack of this and another of the excellent Obsidian stout (review to follow). Inversion is an orange to reddish amber brew with ample off-white bitter foam and a very rustic kind of vibe. Aroma is very sweet caramel malt and classic American hops (grapefruit citrus and twangy herbal notes). The taste is dominant tangerine citrus (not as much grapefruit) and a sweet malt backbone like gummy candy and caramel, with a little dark toast. Very smooth bitterness without harsh notes or strong pine, its resinous but more restrained than many other American IPAs. Some brown spice notes combine with the aforementioned flavors to create an effect like sweet orange spice tea. Little rank tropical flavor but there are earthy and grassy notes in the finish. The body is silky smooth and not terribly heavy. Overall picture is that of a sophisticated and cultured bitterness, with a decent weave of classic flavors and superb integration and balance. If you care, the recipe for this thinking man's ale appears in Mitch Steele's book on IPA. Check out the interesting mix of old school and cutting edge hop cultivars."

"Overall - Pretty good overall, interesting how it's hop forward as hell while still being heavy on the caramel malts. Not big into these particular malts, never was a big fan, but overall this isn't a bad beer, just their choice of recipe vs. my personal tastes."

"O: I like this beer and I wish I had another one. I will definitely have this one again. It is not overly piney or tastes too much like pine resin. It is easy to drink. I recommend it."

"Smell, color, stood out immediately. 1st taste, interesting, demanded a second. This beer keeps you engaged. Becoming enjoyable and wanting a second & a third. I was surprised. This one will be introduced to friends in Texas. Perfect for Sailors and those who want to sail."
"Medium bodied with a mildly coarse mouthfeel. Very resinous on the finish. Bitterness pushes the finish as it lingers."

"The Deschutes Inversion IPA poured with a nice amber body and full fluffy head. The aroma held tropical fruits and citrus hops that held into the initial taste. With the tropical fruits and citrus on the front and a palette coating pine bitterness on the back with a heavier malt profile that added a hint of sweetness. In the end the Inversion IPA was a refreshing and solid IPA."

"Poured a beautiful deep amber, with a finger and a half of fluffy, off-white head that stuck around. It looks fantastic. Scents of citrus and slight pine, but with a lot stronger a scent of malt. What I normally expect from an IPA, with a little bit more malt. Flavor is hoppy, with citrus, pine, some floral notes and a bit of a fruity character. There is a nice malt presence in the background, mostly caramel malt, though there is a nice bready flavor on the finish and in the aftertaste. Pretty on style for an IPA. Maybe a little too malty for my taste. The hops are present and quite good though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. It's pleasant and easy to drink. Slightly stickier than I like, but not unpleasantly so. Overall it's a pretty good IPA. Different from a lot of the West Coast IPAs I've tried, but similar in some ways. It's not bad, though I'm not sure I'd make it my go-to IPA."

"Amber in color with a super creamy off-white head that sticks around for the whole glass and throws off plenty of sticky lacing. Sharp raw herbs right from the get-go with a surprisingly hefty maltiness - toasted bread with a slather of caramel. Hops continue to smack around the palate despite the malt. Grapefruit pith, coarse herbal flavors, hopsack, earthiness, under-ripe strawberry, grassy bitterness. The 80 IBUs shows off in the long biter finish. Not the juicy citrus/pine bomb I was expecting, but more of an old school craft IPA with a focus on bitterness as much as hop flavor and aroma. A nice change of pace from what I've been drinking lately"

"O: I wouldn't call this a big brew, but it certainly packs a bit of a punch. Lots of unadulterated hop flavor that is paired with (and not masked by) some refreshing citrus zest and underlying sweetness. Drinks smooth and satisfying. This one is definitely deserving of praise, and I might just find myself picking up a six-pack of this before the warm summer nights are over."

"Overall: Very interesting IPA from one of my go to breweries. What exactly do we have here? In a world filled with a million IPA's this one is just different enough to stand out while sticking to the basics enough to still be comfortably part of the IPA style."
""
""
"Overall, this seems like a very standard IPA missing some hop flavors, but with an insistent bitterness. Not much for savoring a pint, but I defer to the hop fiends, and maybe freshness is everything on this one. From the 12 oz bottle bought at AJ's Fine Foods in Phoenix."

"The mouthfeel on this is medium bodied. Decently creamy. Dry finish."
"Color is a bright clear orange brown, very typical with a foamy white head and excellent lacing. Smells of bittering hops but balanced sweet malts with gram cracker and a touch of herbal tea. Taste is a bit hoppy, not palate wrecking but sweet and balanced enough to taste great. Body is excellent it balances the ABV which is up there with the big dogs. Overall I would consider getting it again it's a simple yet tasty IPA."

"O- Very good beer, not super hoppy or bitter well balanced with sweet malts, lots of dark fruits on the finish, very easy drinking beer, another very good Deschutes beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours orange-copper with a fair amount of lacing around the glass. There's a definite orange peel/citrus aroma, with some hints of fruity/bubblegum malt flavors. It's a prelude to the flavor profile, which primarily consists of orange peel and grapefruit with some grassy notes. It gradually fades to a dry, borderline metallic bitterness, but it is pleasant nonetheless. Fairly complex and somewhat heavy compared to other American IPAs."

"Overall: a robust West Coast IPA. with a relatively hefty malt component."

"Overall: I've always been a very bright hoppy fan, so this one really is not my style but is still a good brew. It certainly identifies itself as a malty heavy IPA, does not fall into the confusing middle ground."

"Overall I find this beer exceedingly attractive and would recommend it to anyone who likes hops. I personally have not liked hops in my craft beer adventure until this past 6 months or so. I am not a hop head and do not like extreme beers that are over the top hoppy. In saying that, I think if you only mildly like hops you may even like this beer! I am going to give this a solid 4 or better out of 5!"

"O - Loved this beer. Any fans of IPA should try this at one point. Deschutes never fails to deliver."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An above average, but not amazing, IPA. They should have calmed down on the roasted malts and gone with something a bit more pale. I'm sure they wanted to try something a little different, but a less overpowering malt base would let the great hops in this brew come forward a lot more. Still, quite a deal at $8 for a sixer. I would definitely buy this again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: This beer was good but not up there on my list as far as IPAs go. I feel there was too much caramelized malt presence that overshadowed what hop aroma/flavor there was."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a terrific IPA. Pours a nice copper with a thick, frothy head. Smells of citrus and floral hops. It initially tastes rich and smooth with a very malty front and a tasty array of citrusy hops. It leaves a more bitter aftertaste. Perfect amount of carbonation. The beer drinks easily but leaves a great taste in your mouth."

"not bad, but it's getting to the point where it's getting pretty hard to become impressed with this style. it's a pretty standard ipa with some nice gestures, but really doesn't stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A unique take on the style, where balance is more key than IBU's. Reminds me a bit of the Stone Levitation, but with considerable more hop aggressiveness... or the Red Chair, with less hop aggressiveness. One beer I could drink all night and not get tired of."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is clear with a copper / amber body and an inch of sticky, off white head. The aroma offers caramel malt, honey, toast, biscuits, pine. The flavor is sweet. Honey and pine flavors. A tasty brew, but atypical of an American IPA in that it is balanced rather than hop forward. Prominent malt and bread character throughout with pine and minimal bitterness. Hop presence is muted, especially when compared to its contemporaries. Medium bodied with a hint of alcohol. Pretty good."
"overall, this is a great brew. i was very surprised at the slight bitterness and sweet flavors. i cannot, however, determine if the lingering bitterness is an after-effect of this beer or the last one i drank (arrogant bastard) but it definitely lingers. makes me want to grab another quenching drink to wash away the bitterness. i really like it; gave it 4.5 across the board."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber. Minimal lacing. Thin cream head. Smells of alcohol and some pine notes with a slight citrus. Tastes really good. Ha ha more objectively, tastes of grapefruit, pine, lemon, and something else...ends bitter and alcoholic, but not so hoppy. Overall, a really good brew, unique too. Something i would recommend although slightly boozey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh. Not great, not bad. Glad I tried, but I probably wouldn't buy again."
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a beautiful dark burnt orange color with deep copper hues emanating from its sides. Its topped off with w thick dense head and slowly turns into a billowy cloud of bubbles surrounded by a thick wall of lacing. Hops, spiced apples along with some orange and apricot dominate the aroma. Bitter overtones are accompanied by a strong, but good tasting hop presence. Plenty of spices and lemon zest are also detectable. The aftertaste it bitter at first but then warms up and a slight grapefruit flavors takes over."

"O – Not hoppy like some other big West Coast IPA's. The NW nature comes through in the form of unique malt characteristics. Bitter hops try to balance but still is more malt dominant than others from the west coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: A 12oz bottle went WAY too fast. :-)"
""
""
"In a way, this may be the long lost cousin of SN's Celebration IPA, although it's far less strong, a little maltier, and easier to drink in a row than that one. If this is meant to be one of the first groundbreaking IPAs in American craft brewing, I can see that for sure. The malts are pretty delicious, but the hop oil does get pervasive, so at that point I would not necessarily introduce this to newbies with hops. Still a great pick, and up to par with Deschutes' standards for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep slightly hazy orangey color ale with a super large foamy head with great retention and some pretty good lacing. Aroma of pine and light citrus hops with some caramelized malt is pretty good. Taste is mostly dominated by floral pine and citrus notes with light fruity ester and a pretty solid caramel malt backbone. Bitterness level is about average with quite a bit of floral undertones. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Solid offering though I was expecting hops punch to be even more solid."

"This is one of my favorite IPA's from maybe my favorite brewery. Pours a medium dark copper with a 1"" head. Huge nose with lots of grapefruit and somewhat less orange. Very complex and well balanced - Deschutes has dry hopping down to a fine art. At 6.8% there is the expected defined alcohol warming - just as it should be with a big IPA. Very drinkable for 80 IBU with a note of carmel and a very subtle malt aftertaste. Exactly what I look for in an everyday beer - very hoppy but not so over-the-top that you can't drink 4 or 5 in one sitting. I'm happy to report I just loaded a 13.2 gallon keg of this into my man cave!!"

"A miss for me. Just another too-malty, dull-edged IPA that are everywhere in canada."

" good example of the style, perhaps an industry standard, balanced and drinkable without wrecking your palate. I'm so stoked to finally see Deschutes on the shelves in Alberta, its just getting ridiculous at this point here in the Foothills of Alberta I'm running out of beer money"

"Overall a very good IPA from Deschutes. Not really a big surprise."
"Inversion IPA has a rich amber hue with hints of ruby light. It poured with a tall head, beige that lingera a good while. Aroma is not as hop forward as I thought. Hops are light but refreshing but more malt sweetness comes through than hops. The taste is hoppy and bitter but no standout hop flavor, a mesh mash. I was thinking this would been like an WC IPA and that was my thinking but a good IPA none the less. The label and discrip. say NWIPA perhaps thats a bit different then a West coast, I don’t know. Anyway, it’s highly drinkable"

"Had this bottle in Maui. Amber colored with a slight orange tint. Poured with a thin head. Lacing lingered for a considerable time. Definite aroma of honey and pine. Hops come through strongly. The best thing about this beer is although the flavor was hoppy as you would want, it also carried some amount of malt to try and balance it. Semi-creamy mouthfeel. As a whole, an okay IPA but not out of this world."

"Overall, a well crafted, quality IPA."

"Pours darker than expected - hazy deep copper with a fluffy beige head that holds great retention and leaves all kinds of lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty, bready, caramel, faint tropical hop notes - might have been bolder hops on the nose if this was fresher? Tastes include lots of bready malt, brown bread crust, caramel, piny and spicy hop, pungent grapefruit rind, lingering bitterness with resiny pine oils sticking to the palate with some burnt caramel on the finish. Bitterness builds with each sip taken. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, medium body, with nice carbonation. This is definitely a quality IPA, but i think this is getting close to being past its prime. I want to try a fresh one sometime."
""
""
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American IPA poured a hazy copper color, darker then most AIPA's, produced a thick white head, featured excellent retention and left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was full of piney/citrus notes, malted grain and caramel were also present. Medium in body, this ale has a base of sweet toasted malted grain, caramel and an aggressive amount of hop addition. The mouthfeel is off the carts, one of the smoothest AIPA's that I have tried to date. Looking fwd to trying more offerings from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
"Wow - what a brew. I love American IPAs! A tsunami of hop notes assaults the palate, followed by a solid dose of malt. Fantastic aroma and a great flavour, though the dry bitterness perhaps outcompetes the aromatic notes. Too bad more Deschutes brews don't make their way over here. Excellent - grab one if you have the chance."
""
"O - I just kept thinking I was drinking a hoppy red ale rather than an IPA. I liked the beer nevertheless."
""
"I was really looking forward to this beer, the appearance was clean and highly carbonated; promising a great throat burn. A full glass of IPA always excites me as I anticipate a strong snout of herbal hops OR/AND the aftertaste of hops slapping your face like the Three Stooges. I got neither. I consummed the three bottles I had of it while mulling over the paradox of: an IPA without noticeable hops. By the third bottle I was obviously more forgiving - but in the end I would place this in the category of a nice ""Belgian Ale""."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid, if not different type of IPA that has a distinct fruity acidic character, but refreshing nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good and drinkable IPA. Powerful bitter taste, that is just a little out of proportion."
"O: a decent, strongly bitter IPA, that is faulted by the metallic note. Otherwise decent west coast style IPA."
""
"it;s a well made, hearty drink. i would like to drink it at the brewery or in northwest. i am here in a hot valley.... this IPA is more at home in cooler climes."
"O: an extremely unusual beverage, whether it be something discouraging the true taste as in dirty lines or maybe something else.. A bad keg? But if all is well and this is the beer even though it now sounds like im being harsh, I definitely would have again to see if the same result is present. And I look forward to bottled inversion. A beer that is perplexing to the pallet. And now im half way through the pint I want another! Try this beer! Deschutes always amazing"

"This amber-colored beer is nicely covered with a cap of foam. The pine and citrus come through strongly in the aroma. This is a nicely balanced ale. The caramel malt provides a strong backbone for the hops to ride through on. The hops contribute bitterness along with a nice dose of pine notes and citrus. This is a smooth and well made IPA. Kudos to Deschutes."

"Deschutes' Inversion IPA pours a hazy amber, with just under two fingers of off white foam. Head retention is decent, and thick rings of lacing are left behind, but the color is just a bit dark and murky for my taste. The nose has a little bit of caramel to it, followed by some flowery and citrusy notes. Those hop aromatics just don't jump out the glass the way they should in an IPA though. There's a little bit of caramel again at the front end of each sip. The bitterness that comes through next is plenty bold, but the hoppy finish fails to deliver. It's not quite as weak as the nose, but the grapefruit peel flavor is just not intense enough. The body isn't quite west coast dry, but it's not as sweet as some more malt forward interpretations of the style either. The carbonation though is just dull, it feels like the beer fizzles out by mid palate. I'm more than a little surprised by how lackluster I find this bottle of Inversion IPA, usually I'm very fond of Deschutes beers. It honestly just tastes old to me, I'm wondering if Deschutes isn't setting the ""best by"" date a bit too far out from the bottling date."
""
""

"Aroma is mild and hints of a fresh hop presence and a substantial malt body. Flavor is seriously big on hops. Citrus zest and dry. Very west coast / PNW kind of IPA. That said, this beer isn't particularly ""pale"" or otherwise grapefruity like a traditional American IPA. I'd go so far as to say this is more of a imperial red ale or American strong ale. While the flavors in this big beer are very enjoyable, and there's no detectable alcohol burn, IMO the total ABV hurts drinkability of this otherwise very refreshing brew. Which is sad because it's so tasty I'd really like it to become my go-to PNW high-IBU ale. I guess what I'm saying is this is a great beer and it's a shame it's not my new session IPA. Or maybe I'm just in the mood for something a little lighter today."
""
""
"Same flavors in the taste as the aroma. Picking up more pine especially in the finish. Those 80 IBUs lend themselves to a nice bitter bite. There is a big malt backbone present even in this fresh bottle. Fairly smooth with a lower level of carbonation and medium bodied."
""
""
""
"O: Gotta give it up to this brew. Where most IPAs focus on the hops. I feel this one focuses on the malts. Some would probably call this an English Style IPA, but that doesn't tell the whole story. This is a high-quality brew -- definitely recommend."
""
"This is an easy drinking IPA. It's fairly sweet and thicker on the malt side. Decent spicy tone to it. Not a real wide variety of character on the profile, but it's a pleasant drinker. Gotta love Deschuttes; and this is yet another reason to do so."
""
""
"Here's a great IPA! It's remarkably easy drinker despite it's huge hops. Some nice citric properties in the nose and a malty (maybe caramel?) backbone to smooth it out. One of our local bars keeps this beer as their resident IPA and for good reason. It's a perfect introductory IPA and it's still one an IPA nut can enjoy."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid IPA that I think I would enjoy a little more in the cooler months. It's not a very refreshing beer due to the body but it is still a quality brew. This could be a fantastic brew for football season and I plan on revisiting it to find out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Nice balance of flavors. Not what I typically go for in an IPA but I can appreciate this for what it is. A well done NW take on the style with a pronounced use of Crystal and Caramel malts. I think Deschutes does a good job of maintaining the balance and bringing the hop intensity. Definitely a beer I can step out of my comfort zone with and cozy up to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle pours a deep strong Amber with only a little foam. Smell is nice and mellow(not strong); smells malty, hoppy and citrussy all at once- synergy at its finest. Tastes a bit malty and citrussy initially for a split second than the hops just take over and strongly introduce themselves at which point the malt and citrus rebalance out the hops making it a pretty feng shui ipa. A quality well balanced beer by Deschutes."
""
""
""
"Deep, dark copper orange in color with a dense haze and viscous appearance. Poured with an off-white foam that reduced to a soapy cap and left thick sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Soft ripe citrusy aroma that is propped up by a sweet caramel malt backbone. Medium bodied with rich creamy feel and carbonation from the beginning to the end but thins at the finish. Pungent citrus hop flavors up front with pine hops to follow. Hop bitterness creates a tangy bite in the middle before an intense pine hop bitter finish. The caramel malty sweetness is overwhelmed for most of ride but shows signs of life beneath."
" The flavor is very good, lots of piney hop flavors swirling with mild floral and citrus ringd flavor with a good dose of grapefruit and mild toasted malt with a smidge of caramel to round it out and keep the astringent element at a minimal place with lots of dank and juicy hop flavor, this is very fresh tasting with a nice dry quality as it finishes with both herbal and light alcohol tinges. Overall I was really impressed with this based on the amount of hop flavor, it is very bitter too, but not over the top, just agressive enough to keep you coming back for more."

"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with nice head and lacing. Aroma is a nice blend of caramel malt with citrus and grassy hops. Taste is lemon, grapefruit, and blackberries - very bitter but still fairly well balanced by the toffee malt. If you took away half the IBU's I think you'd have a pretty decent amber. Medium mouthfeel with nice dry sticky finish that really asheses to the tongue. Overall a great Northwest IPA which pushes the limits of bitterness without becoming unbalanced."

"On tap, straight from the source. Pours a dark amber color with an inch of head. Some lacing. Aroma is citrus with a bit of floral hops. Taste is citrus hops at first, namely orange peel, and floral hops. Caramel malt flavors as well. Nicely carbonated. Not overly hoppy with the main flavors being the orange peel and floral. Overall, not bad, not great. Wouldnt turn one down but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."

"I was kind of expecting a West Coast hop bomb of sorts, but instead I received something that has more of a Midwest IPA mentality. And I approve heartily. This, along with others that I lump in that category (*cough* Two Hearted) is something I want to drink all day long. But I can't. Sadness."
"This beer is crisp and balanced. The hops are pronounced without being overpowering, and are surrounded by a fruity aroma with a delightful apricot finish. While I personally prefer less fruit aroma in my IPA, it is still a refreshing summer drink. The color is a rich amber, still clear enough to see through."
"O: Not bad overall - there's a strong finish to the beer at the end, which is difficult to decide whether I like or not. It's a quality beer, but there are more distinctive IPAs with a richer flavor profile that I'd choose given the chance."
""
""
""
"D - the hop character is allright, but it is overly pithy with a lingering acidic dryness that really isn't pleasant."
"O: Overall this a is pretty good IPA. The taste exceeded the smell in my opinion. The more I drank it the better the beer got....as it warmed up a bit I'm sure. Overall well balanced with a strong hop character that is balanced out well with the caramel malts. I'm glad I ran into this one on a trip to St. Louis."

"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a light beige head. lots of tiny bubbles rise from bottom to top, a visiually impressive beer. Smell is very hoppy with some caramel. Taste is very good citrus and floral hops with caramel malt, good hop bitterness good enough for any real hophead. Mouthfeel very smooth with mild carbonation, a little on the light side compared with some more heavy ipas which is not a bad thing. Overall a very good beer, very drinkable! i could drink this all day or any time of the year...not to heavy...not too light, just right."

"Add to the fact that this could've been easily screwed up and they made everything work so well...this is definitely worth a try, and I'd probably pick it up again despite my liking of Red Chair. Maybe alternate between the two, but I think Inversion could be good as a fall/winter beer to Red Chair's more spring/summery brightness. Its got a nice warm malt characteristic amid the hops."

"It is still within it's style though. I'd probably buy their Obsidian Stout instead however."

"An easy drinking sessionable IPA. Another good Deschutes creation."

"Nice brew with good caramel notes but an intense hop kick and well rounded flavors that all pop and stand well on their own. Good brew."
"Overall - An interesting take on the style. When I took it out of the fridge I had my hopes up for a fruity/juicy IPA so I was a little disappointed when I tasted it. It's still very good, just not what I was expecting."
"Review from 4/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear dark red orange amber. Half finger off-white head and light lacing. Sweet malt and light aromatic hop aroma. Flavor is sweet and caramel malt and moderate hops, aromatic hop bite on the finish moderated by the malt. A very pleasant IPA. The hops are not outstanding, but everything is done well and has a nice ratio of hops to malt. Definitely a repeater."
""
""

""
"Overall this is one fine classic American IPA from the Pacific NW. If you like IPAs, methinks you'll like this one. Good work, Deschutes. Keep it up!"
""
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a brilliant clear copper with a finger of white head. Not a whole lot going on in the aroma, a light hop presence. Fair amount of bitterness in the flavor though. Lighter side of medium bodied. Decent malt backbone with some caramel malt flavor. Nice drying finish from the hop. I was expecting more from this."
""
""
""
"Definitely one to revisit. Try it, especially if you're looking for a really drinkable IPA."
"Appropriate level of carbonation and certainly drinkable. I'm not a huge hophead or the biggest IPA fan in general (I've gotten myself to be able to appreciate the style more of late, but it's still not my first choice most of the time), but I feel that this is a very well crafted west coast IPA. I feel like Deschuttes is one of those breweries that meets that rare cross-section of widely available and extremely reliable, and Inversion is no diversion from that path. Definitely pick it up and give it a shot if you're curious. Or even if you aren't really. Just give it a shot, it'll probably win you over."
"Pours an amber ale with a solid sheet of linen foam and excellent clarity. Alcohol, grapefruit, mango and some lemon. This is a really, surprisingly pleasant nose here. Some hints of sweet malts in the background of the nose. Assertive bitterness with a balanced degree of english malt, this beer tastes like a sherbert. I dig it. Medium bodied with light on moderate carb and a wet finish. I stopped drinking this flagship a couple years ago because I found it too simple. Don't know if the recipe or I just changed, but good stuff - reminds me of Hop Henge 2012 (light version)"
"A dark amber with a thumbs width beige head. Nice lacing. A nice bready but sweet malt base paired with some pine and citric - orange and grapefruit - hops. Flavor matches the aroma pretty well with the malt base giving it an underlying sweetness and breadiness paired with the hops providng some resin and citrus. A slightly more than moderate prickly bitterness carries through the entire sip and into the aftertaste, the one aspect of this beer I like least. Its not smack you in the face aggressive bitter, its quite mild in that regard, but its strong because of its duration. Its there the entire time and the length enhances its effect on the taste buds. Not quite medium bodied but not thin either, active from carbonation. A pretty good, easy to drink IPA from Deschutes here. Generally not a huge IPA fan so I probably wont drink this one a whole lot but I definitely enjoyed this."
""
"EDIT/Re-review: Had this beer on tap at Ralph Englestad Arena on 3/2/2012, and the maltiness was still strong and the hops were still weak. (had it rated 4.5/3.5/3.5/3/3.5 - very similar)."

"A decent IPA but I prefer more hops in mine."

""
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Decidedly amber in color with a mountainous eggnog head. Lots of hops but lots of crystal malt in the aroma as well. Apples, grapefruit, caramel and iced tea. Flavor is the same but less hoppy. Tastes like malt and hop flavored iced tea. Crystal malt sucks in hoppy beers."

"Mouthwise, the hops trends towards your more rounded, fruiter fruits--apricots instead of orange--and while they're super flavorful they're not all that tonguerapey, which makes it so the caramel malt seems a lot bigger than what you'd normally expect from an IPA. First sip, I didn't like it too much. Though it tasted a little too uppity, little too British. Halfway through, I am goddamn amazed more IPAs don't taste like this."
""
""
"mouth feel: decent mouth feel, not a DIPA but darn good for a SIPA!"
""
"Pours a cloudy, amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight earthy malt, citrus, piny hops, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of piny hops, sweet malt, slight alcohol, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and feel."

"Poured a hazy amber color with a nice cap of white head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Citrus and pine hops on the nose, sweet malty base. Good mixture of intense citrusy / piney hops and sweet bready malts in the taste, big notes of fresh fruit in the finish with a lasting bitterness. Medium-bodied and pretty smooth for an IPA; very nice overall."
""
""
"Poured an orange/amber with a few fingers of offwhite head. Great density and a wall of lacing, complete clarity in the body. Nose is quite floral, with a good mix of citrus and tropical notes. Chewy and crunchy for lack of a better adjective, felt like I could smell the texture of the hops here (oddly?). Rich bready and sweet malt base, right on par with the hops. Taste has a bitter and resinous earthy and herbal hop quality, less fruitiness than the nose bust still some citrus and citrus rind. Some pine and general forest character. Sturdy malt base with a bit of earthiness. Less dense than the nose suggested. Bitter finish that lingers for some time, no alcohol to speak of which was nice for the ABV. Medium low carbonation. A nice IPA, that might have lost a bit with time but I'd love to revisit this fresh. Quite drinkable in spite of this though."
"Lots of win here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a hazy brown and had some good lacing to it. Scent of both mild citrusy and some piney hops. Very drinkable IPA with medium carbonation and really no distinguishing characteristics looking to grab the drinker's attention. I mean that as a compliment because this is definitely an IPA I'll come back to as highly drinkable and very accessible in the Pacific Northwest."
""
""
"Overall: One of the better Deschutes beers I've had. Their Black Butte Porter is amazing, this one is very good. A little unbalanced and very piney, which may be a turn-off to some. As an emerging Hophead, I like it. I'd drink a couple of these in a session."
"another winner from deschutes. this ipa is complex and drinkable. taste like a wide variety of hops blended together, i can pick up on a fruity hop as well as the sturdy piney hops. has a lighter feel due to the use of pale and crystal malts, which make this a really sessionable ipa, despite its higher abv. more subtle than many american india pale ales, this one stands out because it is much more than a bitter hop bomb. every beer i have had from these guys has been excellent."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light: generally I'd like a bit more body, yet I think I will reach for this when I want to wash away malt sweetness altogether. This is a no fooling bitter IPA."
"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Pours a hazy amber/copper color with a two finger white head that lasts nicely throughout the session. Smells nicely of orange, apricot, citrus, and pine with a faint bready caramel malt hidden deep underneath. Taste is sweet malt with plenty of citrus and pine bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Long lingering pine bitterness in a slightly sweet finish. Crisply carbonated, medium body with a sticky resinous mouthfeel. Very nice IPA."
"Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth for an IPA, likely due to the touch of sweet malts. Recommended!"
""
""
""
"First time for any brew from deschutes. Good look and smell. I think the aroma could have a nicer, more alpha strong smell to it. Nice carbonation. Small amout of fruits and citrus. Really nice and easy drinker. Light golden color. Ok balance to it. I heard great things about this brew while friends were in Vegas, maybe expected a little more. Overall I'm excited to see what else they have to offer. Def worth trying if you have available; but could find other, more well rounded brews."
"A pleasant and easy-to-drink IPA. Perhaps a bit too malty, without very much character, but still nice. Solid, but not my favorite offering from Deschutes."

"Pours a hazy copper color with a 3 inch puffy tan head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and citrus zest. Taste is of malt and citrus zest. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers aftre each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA that has a nice balance between the malt and the hops."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by Dec 7, 2011. This pours a nice Orange color with an off white head which leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of pine and citrus hops with a caramel on the back end. The feel is medium with a slight mouth coating bitterness. The taste is as it smells, not overly hoppy, but very good anyways. As always Deschutes delivers an above average beer."

"old beer, let's be honest. shit has been in my fridge for 3 months. i generally love this beer, review MAY NOT do it justice."
"O: A very nice American IPA but doesn't really stand up to the really big boys in the style like Racer 5 or Stone IPA."
"Certainly a fine IPA, but it's one that I think I would prefer very fresh. It's so well balanced that any amount of hop fading will tilt it in favor of the malts, I think. Good, not great."
"O: Pretty, pretty, pretty good. I’m not blown away, but this IPA can stand up against the (not the vast) majority of IPAs out there."
"Overall this is a truly great IPA, while not the best I've had, it's right up there. I think the hop profile is ambitious but a bit muddled. That's my only criticism. Very good beer. Cheers!"
"A solidly made IPA. Easy drinking, and very rewarding. A go to beer."
"O- this is a big bodied beer. Wish it had more hop freshness. Too alcoholic for my liking. But its bigness stands up well to big foods. I wish it had more of a bright, fresh character. It really tastes like more than 6.8%!"
"Not a bad beer at all. I wanted to rate it higher, but I had to go with my initial ratings. Not like the normal IPA’s I’m used to, more like an amber. Good beer, though."
"D - Probably one of the most drinkable IPA's I've had the pleasure of trying. Well built and tasty. Give this one a try."
"Overall: the changing flavors in this one flow very well. Very drinkable for an IPA"
"Mouth - A nice drinkable beer."
" Overall, just a very nice IPA that will be purchased regularly. Bravo."
"O- Though this is still within best by date, this would be a little better more fresh (obviously). Seems like it has some decent components, but its forgettable and more importantly I just gravitate towards the more citrus/fruity IPAs..."
"Pours out clear bronze/copper in color. Tremendous off-white head on this one. Excellent retention and getting tons of lacing. Beautiful. Loads of bitter grapefruit in the nose. Lots of pine and citrus with just a bit of a tropical back bone. Huge amounts of hops in the taste. Straight up piney bitterness with just enough malt profile to balance it out. Just a bit. Awesome hop fix right here. Mouth feel is is on par as well. Goes down smooth and has a pleasing oily finish. This is now my go to ipa when I need hops. One of the hoppiest beers Ive had to date."
"Overall, a well done IPA that will join my rotation."
"OVERALL: I am impressed. Of course, I loved The Abyss, but the only other beer I've had from Deschutes prior to this was Mirror Pond and I was not terribly impressed. So I did not know what to expect from this one. It turns out, I'm very happy I tried it and I look forward to my next one."
"Drinkability- I thought this was pretty good. I would have it again."
"Good for: boiling brats"
"O - Good IPA, A little different then my normal westcoast style, but this is a good example of what else you can do with an ipa. Nice and fully bitter, and has some nice hop tastes."
"O- A solid IPA, a must try for hopheads."
"O - A very solid, balanced IPA. Hoppy without being a hop bomb. Nice combination of hops varieties."
"A very good American IPA in my opinion-plenty of hop character with a solid, caramel malt backbone to support it. Delicious and refreshing."
"This offering by Deschutes is one of the more malt-forward, caramel tasting IPAs I've tried. The citrus notes are present but counterbalanced by a strong malt backbone and unexpected dense mouthfeel. Can usually find a sixer for $6-8 around Portland making it a pretty good deal."
"Dr: Very drinkable and affordable for the nice quality. Give her a spin, lads - even if you normally hate IPAs."
"Balance is under rated. This beer is balanced like no body's bidness, and that's good to see/taste. Sweet malty smell, almost barley wine-like. That disappears on the tongue, where bitter pine cones dominate. Old penny finish with the fizz lingering until the swallow. A little thinner than the the smell suggests, but that's OK. A double-bomb it ain't. Almost forgot....it's amber colored."
"This is a great IPA that has an English malt character with piney hops and is well balanced."
"This is not what American hop heads will be accustomed to; it's an IPA that won't grate the senses of an old-world purist. In typically American fashion it has more of everything, including hops to be sure, but in place of the bright citrus and bitter resins, it offers the mild temper and balance of an English offering. Strongly recommended if that's your thing."
"Overall I must say that this IPA was THE one that got me into the style some five or six years ago. I think that it's taste is in my rear view mirror and I don't drink this everyday anymore, but that doesn't mean it's not a great American IPA. I am so glad I decided to pick up a single bottle of this so that I could not only review it but revisit an old friend. I also want to commend Deschutes for being on the cutting edge for all of their brews."
"PP (Price Point) - $12.99 for a 12 pack in Idaho is a screaming good deal in my opinion. Do eeeet!"
"Ok IPA, pretty solid west coast style. Not one of Deschutes strongests."
"O: A good, balanced IPA that showcases a lot of earthiness and toasted malt."
"Overall- Decent IPA. Nothing spectacular about it though. I would prefer it to be a little ""cleaner"" tasting. 3.5/5"
"While this is an enjoyable beer, though not too exciting of an IPA. From what I experienced it seems as if it would be better identified as a pale ale."
"Overall: a solid ipa with good balance. There are some better ipas out there but there are a ton that are not this good."
"Decent hop profile that bucks the norm for a NW IPA, being neither very malty nor especially pine/grapefruit forward (though I expect C-hops are present), but more on the herbal end of the spectrum. Not bad, but far from my favorite offering from Deschutes."
"O - I prefer my IPA's to be really hoppy, and this is more of an English take that is probably hopped with American hops.. but this beer is in perfect balance and while a lot of people use that 'balanced' catch-phrase.. this beer really does have a solid mix of hop bitterness and malt backbone."
"O - Not much that stands out, and Deschutes is one of my favorites."
"O- all Deschutes beers are solid, and this is no different. I am sure I've had this on draught as well, and I remember saying it wasn't much of an IPA, which can be attributes to it's malts and balance overall."
"o - overall, very glad i got to try this beer and yet another reason why i wish that deschutes would distribute to my area. not the best ipa our there by any stretch of the immagination, but has that deschutes flavor which i am a fan of. kind of like a mirror mirror with hops...also a bit reminiscent of hop in the dark."
"O: A very solid IPA that wasn't too crazy/over the top, but still did IPA's justice by really getting the characteristics of an IPA down well. I can see the fruitiness being too much for some, but I thought it struck a good balance."
"I never drank much Deschutes over the years in favor of local Washington beers. That may be about to change. I could enjoy this one year-round."
"D - What can I say, very good brew"
"O: I am very impressed with this I.P.A. I am not typically a fan of hop-centric brews, but this one came off to me as a fairly balanced with notes of hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Not an overly complex beer by any means, but very, very solid, easy to drink (especially at 6.8% ABV) and entirely tasty. Deschutes, you continue to impress. Cheers!"
"Decent, but not exceptional beer. A little subdued versus some of the other American IPAs, but still solid."
"O: A good IPA, but does not particularly stand out amongst a sea of craft IPAs here on the west-coast."
"O- I've said before that I'm not a hophead, but this is a very nice beer to drink! Very well balanced, with lots of flavor, both bitter and modest malt sweetness. I can't honestly say that I'd be able to drink this all night, but I could enjoy a couple of bottles for sure. Good job!"
"Conclusion: Deschutes does it again. I have yet to taste a beer from this brewery that doesn't impress me in some way. This ties as the second best American IPA I have tried (with Titan from Great Divide)"
"o - a well-balanced, highly drinkable ipa that does not overwhelm with flavor complexity, but is still quite enjoyable."
"Pours a clear reddish copper with a nice head that lingers throughout. Aroma is citrus mellowed with rich caramel. Flavor is balanced for an IPA with grapefruity hops and malty sweet grains competing for the spotlight. This is not a hop bomb like some IPA's (not that there's anything wrong with that) but just a very well balanced, well constructed IPA that will remain part of my regular rotation as long is it is around. Nicely done Deschutes."
"Opinion: Well, I am not sure what to say. It may be my allergies, but I am not really all that fond of this beer. It may have some age on it, and this may be throwing off my perception of the balance, but I can't get over the bitter edge to this beer. I don't think that I have had a beer from Deschutes that I didn't like, but this is my first one. I believe that I can just expect this from a brewer in the NorthWest where hops are in abundance...but it is a shame that this beer doesn't have any better balance than it does. I will still drink the beer in my glass, but I won't be seeking this beer out in the future."
"D/O: Like an aging athlete trying to keep up with his younger, swifter peers, Inversion IPA struggles to extend itself past its malt-forward foundation and be something it is not. Although it is a well-rounded pale ale, it fails to project its hops assertively and in appealing fashion. It is outclassed by Red Chair, and is definitely not just a lower abv version of the remarkable Hop Henge."
"D: Good price, highly refreshing."
"Overall it is a pretty solid normal IPA. You get characteristics of DIPA without the alcohol, so you can have a few."
"This one pours a nice golden amber color with a finger of off white head. Webby lacing. The nose is faint, offering some caramel and light citrus notes. The taste is a bit more impressive, offering some bready sweet malt and some pine and citrus hop flavors. Although the balance isnt achieved here, it is quite drinkable and tasty with a creamy mouthfeel. Decent IPA."
"Pours a standard but very nice looking one and a half finger head, the head is slightly off white. The head has some small bubbles and some big bubbles, from the side the bubbles look a lot different, not very good though from the side. Excellent lacing throughout the beer. Carbonation looks just about perfect, maybe a touch less would be perfect, but pretty dang close. The body is a orangish-reddish color, very unique for an IPA really. Not very transparent, but I can see a few things on the other side. The head is now mostly gone, but it's retained a little bit, and it isn't going away so that's good. Overall the appearance is really good, I don't know if it deserves a 4.5, maybe it does, but I'm going to give it a 4. The smell is hoppy, malty and boozy. Right off the bat I can tell there will be a significant malt note and alcohol note in this beer, which is a little disappointing, because the malts should be on the lower side in an IPA, and the alcohol is always better when it's masked, regardless of the style. There is still a heavy hop smell in this beer, so I have no doubt it will be a quality brew, just a little disappointing by that heavy malt and alcohol. Other things I notice, it smells really clean and refreshing, not too complex though. It's a quality smell, so it gets a 4, but for sure nothing over that because of the malts and alcohol smell. Not very much flavor on this IPA, I'm shocked. I'm not drinking it ice cold, so there shouldn't be anything holding back on the flavor. I mean it's just really watery, maybe I have a bad bottle, I have another bottle, so I'll check to see if that one is the same, but wow. Somewhat malty, somewhat hoppy, pretty well balanced on those accounts. No alcohol on the flavor like I thought there would be, but overall the dominating factor is....water. Slightly crisp, but for the most part the carbonation is very low as well, I guess you can't judge a book by it's cover. I do pick up a little alcohol now, but it's not much, and it's not bad. Overall, it's just not very flavorful, I'm in awe. I mean it's not a bad flavor, and what I can taste is good, it's just way too light, especially considering it's 6.8%. Mouthfeel is big enough, it fills up your mouth enough to be a solid feel, but the carbonation, it's just way too low. Second strait beer where the carbonation has just been way low for my liking. I want to give this beer higher rating on the mouthfeel because the feel isn't that thin, it tastes watery, but it doesn't feel watery; but the carbonation just kills it for me. Overall on this beer I'm shocked at how flavorless it is, I mean really, WOW, I'm at the bottom of the glass now and not much has changed. It's still a good beer, it's well made, it's tastes good, just not a sufficient IPA. I don't know what more to say, not a terrible beer, it's a good beer, but most definitely not anything more than that."
"A decent IPA, but I prefer many more to this one. If I'm drinking Deschutes 6 packs, Obsidian Stout will be first and foremost on my list."
"A reddish amber color with a small tan head. Evenly laced during consumption. Pretty well balanced nose as pine and grass lead into a subtle toffee note. Smells like it will he thick. A little sticky in the mouth. Hops as used more for bitterness than taste. Again, hops/malt is equally spread as this is darker and tastes more like a hopped amber or ESB. Still, very drinkable and a present beer, just not a great IPA."
"Overall: I checked the Deschutes website and in this recipe uses a grain bill more similar to an English style IPA along with an English yeast strain. The hops are more American but I would certainly classify this as a solid English IPA. Nothing wrong with it, but then again it does not blow me out of the water."
"Drink isn't great. I'd love to try this and be ensured it's fresh. It's still drinkable and it's not bad...but it's completely off for the style and I have to rate it as such."
"O: Hey, it's a decent beer. I would take a bottle of this over BMC or other crap any day. But I expect more out of IPAs, and I could compile quite a list of IPAs I'd buy again before this one."
"This is a good blend. The smooth flavor and drinkability mask Inversion IPA's 6.8% alcohol very well."
"A nice beer, although getting outside the realms of a really good IPA. The sweetness is a bit too pronounced, leaving it more a beer to sip and ruminate over than one to drink with gay abandon."
"The nose clashes slightly with the taste here as far as hop profile goes and feels a bit heavy to be a session beer. Great amounts of bitterness and subtle fruit flavors surface from time to time. Slightly dank and dreary, a steady and heartfelt rainy day beer."
"Medium body, mildly carbonated. Not one of those knock you socks off IPA's, but overall rating bonus +0.5 points for being pleasant to drink."
"Overall Drinkability - Good beer but not very balanced. Strong aftertastes that lasts too long sort of kills it."
"This is a good northwest IPA. Not bright but firm in hop character. The body helps support the bitterness. A touch more citrus would be nice but I will go back to this for a regular fridge beer."
"Pours a bright amber with orange highlights that are surprisingly dark with a soft peach coloured head. There is plenty of chunky lacing around the glass as the foam slowly dissipates. The nose is a bit complex with rip orange and a subtle honey boozyness. This beer is surprising as it does not look or smell like an average IPA but is striking and smells delicious non the less. The taste is also complex with a strong malty presence up front more like a Scotch Ale. This is then followed immediately by a bitter orange then a floral blast. The mouthfeel is slightly dry and has a lingering burnt bitterness. This is a very complex beer and a mixture of many styles that makes it both delicious and intersting. Oh, and it has good retention and is almost 7%."
"The major inversion here is between the nose and the flavor, and I wish there was more connect. Still, it’s a decent IPA from one of the best producers of hoppy beers in the country right now."
"This was a very easy to drink beer and if I had not had other engagements elsewhere I'd have probably drank a few more."
"So, I make the most of it and enjoy them more sparingly."
"Deschutes Inversion IPA: This IPA is more of a Double IPA style. The head is off-white, and the body a deep dark color, more reminiscent of a Double. There is some hop to the aroma, but it is not strong. The flavor is very thick in malt all the way through, with a hoppy bitterness rising toward the end. Again, to me this is more of a Double IPA, and I prefer lighter IPA’s with more sparkle."
"(12oz. bottle). Deep copper color with beige head. Aroma of some caramelized sugar and some citrus. Malty initial flavor followed by hop bitterness and fizziness on the tongue. My preference for IPAs is Racer 5-more hops and less malt. Not a bad beer at all, however"
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, finishes tingly. Nice beer."
"Decent Beer."
"I wish there was a box you could just check to say youve had it."
"Overall a tasty brew. Solid IPA. Wouldn't seek it out but if you see a 6er, grab one."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with the dry finish being a nicely balanced ending. Stickiness is present at the start, but isn't very convincing. Drinkability is good thanks to the finish, and the flavors remain pleasant after multiple bottles of this. Solid in all departments, and a respectable IPA that isn't too expensive either."
"overall a treat to drink. hops are on parade and don't disappoint. recommended."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs that is under 1.50 a bottle. Great malt character and medium hopping for a very nice combination of sweet and bitter. I thought my friend from Portland was hyping it up, but no its damn good. I'd recommend for anyone who isnt crazy about hops to the max and want a more rounded spectrum."
"O: A damned fine I.P.A., hoppy but not hotly bitter. Full of sweet malts and smooth hops, mighty fine!"
"This is an IPA for old-school, hop lovers. Sure, there is a bit of balance here, but the hops are very dominant both in terms of flavor and bitterness. Funny thing is, this beer smells a lot more balanced than what it tastes like. All of that being said, overall, I am a big fan of this IPA. It's true to the style, even though it's flirting with the double IPA category, but quite simply, it's a well crafted beer that I will come back to."
"D/O- Overall a good to great IPA in my book. The mouth watering caramel hints really take center stage and leave you wanting more. Speaking of more...Deschutes come to IL!!"
"One inch tan head with large bubbles that dissipates to about 1/8 inch within two minutes. Patches of suds remain on the glass as the head slowly shrinks to the surface. Within five minutes the head is down to the surface. An amber-ish but quite red color. Relatively little carbonation to the eye. Nose is piney and malty; also hoppy with a medley of fruits lurking that I cannot peg down without help from the bottle (citrus). Brew is bitter on the palate. Nice, well-carbonated mouthfeel that goes down smoothly but a welcome coat lingers on the palate. Bitter, piney aftertaste. Bitterness lingers for several minutes. Very refreshing. A very nice american ipa. $8 for a six-pack of this is a bargain, indeed."
"Inversion is a perfect name for the beer. with the malt-forward and long bitterness at the end, this beer matches its claims. It has a bit more malt for my taste and almost strikes me as an amber; and while my bro loves amber and I can respect that, it just ain't my thing. For what it is it does it beautifully. I think we have an Amber IPA here, and it is at the top of its class."
"D: I have enjoyed quite a few of these, especially considering the low price. Another solid west coast cascadian from Deschutes."
"I am even more impressed how good this is beyond the freshness date, it's even a little more fruit subtle than its big grapefruit bomb on tap version. Great drinking beer."
"Final thought - $7.99 a sixer, is an awesome price for a beer with a nice ABV and even better taste. Wow."
"Another winner from Deschutes."
"Would certainly enjoy more, and I wouldn't figure for an IPA but this could grow on me."
"The taste was very hoppy at the onset but to my pleasure it stayed hoppy throughout. Malts showed up at the end to ensure a more full body. Over all the Inversion IPA had a good body to it. I prefer to have more of a balance in my pale ales in regards to counteracting the hops but the overt hoppiness is to be expected in an IPA so I won't complain too much. A good IPA here with a better than average body to it."
"T: Lots and lots of hops that hit your palette hard and bitter. They're balanced pretty will with some caramel malts and some undertones of bread and biscuit. Pretty solid IPA from Deschutes."
"Overall, a really good IPA from a great brewery. I still prefer the grapefruity IPA's to the bitter ones but I can see growing into this as my bitter palate continues to develop. High recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - still working up to this being a regular purchase so singles every now and then [O;Y]"
"M/D: Medium bodied and creamy. Overall very enjoyable. a solid beer I could keep in the fridge and drink anytime."
"D - A very worthy IPA and definitely a staple for any hop head. The dry bitterness on the mouthfeel was the only weakness in an otherwise quality offering."
"D - much more balance than many American IPA's make this very easy and tasty to drink, the more Deschutes I try the more they are becoming one of my favourite brewers"
"A very nice amber orange color although slightly cloudy die to much carbination. A tan/white head that really laced the glass. Nice grapefruit citrus taste. A nice malty front with the citrus and slight sweetness undertones. An easy hop ending that is smooth but lingering. I liked it over the regular mid priced craft beers from Oregon/Washington."
"D-This is a pretty classic-tasting IPA. I like it, and I'm glad that Deschutes has joined the lineup of beers available in Minnesota."
"Deschutes makes some good beer, and Inversion IPA falls into that category."
"D. Hops, for the sake of hops. I wanted more."
"drinkability is good and a great change of pace from the hopbombs i have been drinking lately"
"Pours a very hazy amber color with a medium-small off-white head. The scent is hoppy with a tad bit of malt. There is a quite a bit of citrus too (lemons, grapefruit, etc). Taste is initially caramel malt with some bitterness and light grassy and floral notes. Then I get a strong citrus profile with a strong lemon flavor. The grassy and floral flavors are also there. The finish is bitter with a delightful bite. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is high as the 6.8 ABV is quite nice. Wouldn't expect any less from Deschutes..."
"It's a very enjoyable and quality IPA. The alcohol is somewhat present, but doesn't detract. I'll definitely have this again."
"This will be in my fridge on a regular basis!"
"D- I found this one to be very easy to drink. Seems to be fairly simple and good."
"Medium bodied, slightly below average carbonation for the style. Finishes dry and bitter. This is a good IPA. Worth seeking out again."
"Drinkability is awesome, I wish I had bought more!"
"Mouthfeel is good. Smooth and crisp with a clean bubbly carbonation. I find it hard to really say much about this beer. Not that it's bad it's just that it's not special at all. A good solid drinker but nothing I'd recommend. In fact it's quite forgettable."
"D - A nice IPA that I'll buy again but I would expect something with a little more gusto from Deschutes."
"D-Very nice and drinkable beer. Worth getting again."
"D: booooring. This is definitely the most disappointing beer I've ever tried from Deschutes. I absolutely love everything else I've tried, but this is one bad apple. I really don't know what else to say, I definitely won't be letting this one effect my future tastings, but I won't be having this again."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a finger of white head that clings to the glass very well. Aroma is of malty sweetness and some hops, but not as much hops as I would expect. the taste follows the same suit, with a lot of malty sweetness and not as much hops as I would expect. The mouthfeel was quite harsh for my batch, way overcarbonated."
"D- A solid IPA that ranks among the better ones."
"White frothy head, dark copper body. Lots of cascade hops (herbal, grassy) and minor carmel sweetness in the nose. Taste has a very smooth tea-like bitterness with a candied orange sweetness backing it up. Some citrus pith and malt sweetness on the finish. Very drinkable smooth IPA."
"Drinkability: I believe this is my first beer from Deschutes. It's an easy beer to sip on, though until they distribute to Wisconsin I won't be able to try their offerings except through trades."
"Hop bite is a little too numbing to make this highly drinkable. Alcohol feels potent, too."
"Pours a slightly chill hazed deep copper color with a two finger white head that drops quickly to form a cap on top. Smells nicely of apricot, citrus, and pine with a faint bready caramel malt hidden deep underneath. Taste is sweet malt with plenty of citrus and pine bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Long lingering pine bitterness in a slightly sweet finish. Crisply carbonated, medium body with a sticky resinous mouthfeel. Great IPA that I wish I could get more often. I like a sweet malt backbone and not just bracingly bitter hops, this definitely fits the bill for my taste buds."
"Poured amber brown with brown highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. Piney hops were noticeable on the first whiff with caramel citrusy notes and a good sweet malt presence. The flavor was a little bit more sweet on the malts but did have piney hops alongside caramel citrusy accents. It did however have some earthiness with a good malt backbone. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, hoppy, piney, citrusy, bitter, and crisp finish. It drank good but wasn't as punchy on the hops as I thought it would be."
"Inversion has shown up in the Twin Cities, so I picked one up. Pretty good IPA, not mind blowing, but a nice balanced IPA with an interesting orange flavor and color. Worth a try."
"On cask at the brewpub in Portland. I had this last year on cask and I had been thinking about this for over a year. I had to order this right after the Black Butte XXII. Pours a bright orange colour with a finger of white head that doesn't dissipate at all. Nice rings of frothy lacing surround the pint glass. Lots of citrus hops wonderfully balanced with caramel malt. This isn't the most bitter IPA, but it may be one of the most delicious ones. Very smooth mouthfeel."
"D: This is an easy drinking, accessible IPA. I like it for what it is."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Good, not the best beer I have had from these guys, but good enough that you could drink more than one."
"a good beer, but not one of my favourites from deschutes or a great west coast IPA."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs. One of the main reason I have grown to love IPAs. Some good memories this past summer camping with this in hand."
"This beer is a deep amber with a thin head that leaves sticky lace all down the glass. A sweet grapefruit hops smell reaches you first with the malts expressing themselves as lightly toasted whole wheat bread. The taste follows the smell with the sweetness of the citrus turning decidedly bitter. That bitterness really dominates the finish, but it lingers just a bit before leaving abruptly, leaving you wanting the next gulp. Went very well with some left-over meat lovers' pizza."
"Overall a good brew out of the can. The alcohol presense gave it more of a DIPA feel. Worth trying."
"This beer pours a dark copper color with a hint of ruby. The aroma is very hop forward with loads of citrus and floral hops. The taste is massive floral and citrus hops with a hint of pine in the finish, bitter, but with a nice malt background to work against. An excellent American IPA."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a pretty flavorful and easy drinking IPA overall. it wasn't outstanding for the style, but a pretty solid beer overall."
"It's also right up there @ an unnoticeable 6.8%, making this a dangerous little 6er. All good in the hood."
"Taste is smooth, flavorful hops up front followed by a firm, semi-sweet malt middle and a lightly bitter finish of toast and lupulin. I usually like my IPAs with a light, grainy malt background to let the hops shine through...but this one the malts and the hops work together nicely and create a pretty complex range of flavors. Mouthfeel is very nice...smooth and creamy. This is a very well crafted IPA that seems to fly under the radar a bit due the malty balance it has. I like it."
"This beer has a slight sweetness, but is overall a hoppy - full-bodied delight. It is the most drinkable and tasty IPA I have come across thus far. It pours a nice, amber-brown and smells just as uniquely brilliant as it tastes. Great beer for all seasons."
"Overall: I wasn't very impressed initially. It seemed overly simple, but it started growing on me and by the time I had drained my glass I was ready to refill it."
"D- Pretty drinkable, although there are lots of IPA's I'd seek out before getting this one again. I'd like to see a better blend of hops. It was well balanced, I will give it that."
"Wonderful beyond words. I have tried many IPAs and for some reason this one ""takes the cake"" All of the points of a great IPA are here, but somewhere beneath the surface there is a wonderful rich flavor that I can't really explain. Is it the ""caramel"" that I detect? I am a Summit lover, and both their IPA, Pale Ale,and now Horizon Red Ale are really my favorites. But this is just that ""inch"" better. I would love to taste this one on tap."
"End result: I wish Deschutes was available in NJ. Quality example of the single American IPA."
"Middle in the hazy range, copper colored brew. Sturdy and fluffy cream colored head. Sticks to ze glass. Nice sticky hop scent, citrus and bitter. Hops in the taste are mostly bitter, light floral range as well. Nicely balanced sweet malt. Rounded out with a fairly present warming alcohol. Thin to mid mouth, A bit wet and pretty sharp. Very solid IPA."
"The last of my small Deschutes stockpile. It pours a semi-hazed light amber topped by a stolid finger or so of creamy ecru foam. The nose comprises a sweet caramel covered in a solid layer of understated citrus peel and even more understated pine. Nothing is overt, but at the same time nothing is truly weak, either. Very nice. The taste pumps the pine and especially the citrus (it seems like some ruby red grapefruit) up a notch, while the caramel remains as demure as the height of Victorian maidenhood. The grapefruit rind is a bit sharp, but doesn't go so far as to viscerally hurt. The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, though strangely hard with the grapefruit. The only thing knocking against the drinkability is the length of time the grapefruit peel hangs around the back of the throat, stabbing with a tiny arrowhead. It's still pretty good beyond that, though."
"Dechutes Inversion IPA pours a beautiful ruby red with a nice off-white head that lingers into a beautiful lacing. The aroma is distinctly grapefruity hops with a hint of caramelized malt. Bitterness and herbal hop flavor hits upfront in the flavor with more citrusy grapefruity goodness. Some dark fruity malt comes through briefly but the resiny, herbal bitterness covers it up and lingers."
"This is a very solid IPA, Deschutes has never disappointed me."
"The mouth is a little overcarbonated but not overbearingly so. All in all I'm a fan of Dechutes. This one was ok but not up to the standard I expected from them. You could pass me one at a party but I probably won't go out of my way to buy it."
"D= Not a bad beer but I would say this is my first dissapointment from deschutes. Not the best IPA for my money"
"Drank from Sam Adams pint glass. Light brown pour, but once in the glass turns more of a medium brown. Good head, and great lacing. Very floral hop aroma. The aroma sort of just hits you in the face. I'm not a big fan of IpA's , but I thought this one was pretty decent. I would probably buy this again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Absolutely nothing to complain about whatsoever. Modest in ABV at 6.8%, and I feel like I could drink a lot of these. Very tasty and satisfying overall."
"D - This is a really great IPA, and I would be more than happy to drink several of them! Goes down smooth, tastes great, and is of real quality, enjoy!"
"D- easy to drink even for malt fanatics. smooth and crisp"
"M/D: Medium body and good amount of carbonation. Hop oils linger a bit at the end. I prefer this style of IPA with a solid balance of hops and malt. Very drinkable."
"D: This one is definitely a keeper. It's going to be hard to keep a six pack in my fridge for a full week. A very well rounded IPA with it's caramel sweet that gets balanced by the pine/citrus hops."
"Best by 11/30/2010 according to the label."
"A tasty IPA. This is well built and refreshingly bitter."
"Grabbed this one in a mixed sixer at the Grand Canyon's market (shockingly good beer selection, that). Really enjoyed this one - placed it next to both the Full Sail and New Belgium IPAs and it came ahead in terms of complexity of flavor and aromas, and color as well. Not a straight forward hop bomb, but rather interestingly balanced with a nice malt backbone to balance out the bright, sprightly hops, with a nice variety of citrus and caramel flavors going on. Really a nice brew that I would definitely grab again."
"Overall- a good but not great IPA. Expected more from this venerable brewery. Still, this is a good beer."
"m/d-Medium body that leaves a well carbonated hoppy and bitter combination feel. A nice drinker that I enjoyed."
"Drinkability: This one is decent and a sipper. Not my favorite from the brewery, but solid."
"MF/DK: Very even keeled body and carbonation. Quite nice for the style. Good flavor = Good drinkability and this beer's got good flavor."
"It has that very distinct hoppiness which is familiar in the IPA style and when it hits your tongue it really explodes with that bitter and refreshing flavor. Superb beer."
"This is really just an average offering from a great brewery."
"D: Good drinkability. Very nicely balanced."
"this is one nice IPA. a bit different than many others out there and not overly hoppy where you want to stop drinking them, pretty perfect."
"D- A little too bitter and not as balanced as I would like. The malt makes the color super and makes for good mouthfeel but seems to fight with the hops rather than play nice together when it comes to taste."
"Delicious IPA variant that is heavy on the bitterness. The alcohol is well-hidden as well, making this a very sessionable beer."
"D- This one catches up to me after about one and a half. Just a little to sweet but with a good hop bite that tires my tongue."
"I can respect this beer from afar, but it simply was not for me. It was too dry and bitter, and not to my liking. I might give it another shot. For now I will be moving on. Others might find it interesting, so its probably worth a try."
"Drink: I have bought many of these in mixed deschutes 6 packs, and is a very very well rounded ipa."
"How does Deschutes get that great bright orange color? It's wonderful in both this beer and twilight. Anyway, the nose is nice with citrus and pine. The taste is a bitter pine with a residual sweetness. Ultimately, a bit bitter for the ultimate session beer, but otherwise the stars align."
"A generally well-balanced west coast IPA, if you're ok with all that fruity, floral, and herbal character, one pleasantly restrained on the bitterness. It sort of screams out 'Pacific NW forest' - if you were hiking through one, chewing on some Werther's, or the like. And I'm not sure entirely sure about any 'inversion' going on, IPA-wise, as is inferred by the label."
"D-If you want an IPA with some bite this fits the bill. I'd prefer something with a little more of a juicy hop flavor. Comes off as too one-sided on the bitterness for me. Bitter without good flavors.."
"D: Drinkable, but not exactly the refreshing qualities I want in my IPA."
"Pours a rather dark amber color with a two finger white head and light lacing. Lots of yeasties floating around in the glass, not much carbonation. Aroma is somewhat malty up front, but not sweet, more bready, toasty, and dry than anything else. Might be some light caramel back there, and hops are surprisingly low key considering this is an IPA, but what hops I do manage to get out of the smell are lightly piny. Hmm, this beer is hard to judge. It really has no IPA qualities to me. This tastes like an American Amber/Red Ale rather than IPA. It's very malty, again with the toast and bread, some light caramel, but not overly sweet. Hops are way in the background, and like the nose they largely consist of pine flavors, some herbaceous tinges, some citrus, with a short supply of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with very low carbonation. I don't get it. How is this an IPA? Where are the hops? Best before date is 10/5/10, so I know it's not super old. I'm sort of baffled. It's a good tasting beer, but nothing that i look for in an IPA. Review scores reflect style rather than overall taste."
"T - it starts malty and karate kicks your palate with a nice set of hops overall a good ipa from this awesome Brewery"
"overall: a go to beer for me good value well crafted and always consistently good."
"This beer pours a hazy amber-orange color. The head is a rocky one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit with a hint of pine resin. This beer smells more like grapefruit than anything I've ever encountered other than grapefruit itself. It is a very pleasing aroma, but lacks true complexity. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is a solid bitterness though out the sip, but the rest of the taste vanishes quicklly leaving no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent IPA, but its lack of complexity makes me yearn for a different beer."
"Taste is improving as it goes down. Lots of hops. Some malt and citrus rind in the finish. Not a super complex beer but very easy to drink and it is fresh. Mouth feel is a little creamy which is a contrast to the rind finish. A pretty nice IPA that is a little different than what I have been drinking lately."
"D: Very drinkable. Actually less hoppy than their famed pale, but with more body. Even for a stronger beer, it's quite sessionable. Will I buy it again? Yes, indeed. I had to after the bottom of my last six pack gave out and I lost every beer on the floor. This one has made up for that, now. An excellent brew."
"D: Nicely balanced, goes down easily, mild kick, this isn't a hop bomb but it is a nice, well balanced IPA."
"pours a beautiful very slight hazed copper color with a 1 finger head and tons of clinging lacing..this is a great looking ipa!!..smell is piney and floral in the hops with brown sugar malts and bread..the taste is crisp/bitter pine and citrus hop hit right at you but it is offset with brown sugar sweet malts and some baked bread its nicely balanced .. wow! this is a tasty ipa it starts crisp with bitter citrus hops then sweetness in the middle and finishes with crisp pure hops/malt..again its nicely balanced..mouth feel is medium its a solid ipa that lets you know that hops are here..its a drinkable one that is very crisp"
"Pretty good. Not as hoppy as I expect, very mild IPA."
"Excellent drinkability. A perfectly bitter IPA that I could drink all night."
"Pretty darn good and Deschutes has impressed me with their IPA offerings lately."
"D: Pretty good beer and for the price I'd buy it again. Isn't great but something good to have around."
"Verdict: Overall, Inversion is a decent little American IPA, though maybe just a little forgettable. It's balanced and drinkable, but the flavor profile is lacking in intensity and character."
"Overall, a decent ipa. The aroma is solid on this but the taste brings too much booze with it. It is a bigger ipa, but I still don't like the booze showing in a single ipa. One of these would be enough for me in a sitting."
"This is a mighty tasty ipa, I can see myself picking up quite a bit more of this."
"D: It is very tasty and not too filling. The alcohol isn't very up-front and really you could drink this IPA all night."
"This new-to-me Deschutes I've had since they've entered this market, and am I glad it's here. This one may be a staple of my summer imbibement."
"Drinkability: Fairly light, easy-to-drink IPA overall that has a touch of English with the floral spicy hops, even though it is all supposed to be American hops. Also, a little more caramel than a typical American IPA. Overall, that makes this a slightly different American IPA that is worth trying even if not one of my favorites."
"Pours a dark, reddish amber color with a thick head that held up for a long time. A lot of lacing is left on the glass. This is approaching Red Ale territory in color. Aroma is mostly hops with hints of orange, apricote, and pineapple. But the flavor is more balanced. Still fairly bitter with plenty of citrus/tropical fruit hop flavors, but there is a nice sweet caramel base. A little like Juicy Fruit. I think the malt brings out the flavors of the hops even more. The hop flavor just seems to go on and on. Finishes bitter with a pineapple and kiwi aftertaste. The body feels large enough to carry the bitterness but it is not so heavy as to hamper enjoyment during hot weather. Good carbonation. This is one of the better examples of an American IPA. It is not just a hop bomb so many will give it lower scores, but I love the attempt at balance."
"Drinkabillity is pretty good, not great, but pretty good."
"D: Not my favorite interpretation of the style, but very well done. I get this occasionally and will continue to do so."
"It is pretty drinkable though."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. A bit on the bitter side for me as IPA's go. Still a good beer."
"In short, this really is two beers in one. You get a sweet, balanced (almost English IPA) feel at first which is then completely replaced by an agressive American finish. For me, I really like having the best of both worlds. However, those put off by one style or the other may feel that this beer is a Jack of all trades while a master of none."
"Nothing less than what I would expect from Deschutes - a solid beer."
"Nice."
"Pours a nice amber color with an off white head. Not too strong of a smell from the hops. Good amount of malt and carbonation used and a little less hoppy than I'd like in an IPA. Overall good beer tastes good not one of my top favorite IPA's but it is good."
"BTW, the beer sampled is about 6 months out of date....no big deal here."
"Drinkability: I would definitely get again, especially when I am in the mood for a morr balanced IPA."
"Final Notes: This is my kind of IPA. Not too bitter and with enough malts to go around. I would effectively call this an IPA for malt-heads. Those that like super-hoppy IPAs better look elsewhere because you won't find that here. Stands up well to any flavorful meal."
"This bright copper-colored beer features a slow-to-form head, but once it does, it's dense and lasting. The nose is sharply resinous, and somewhat fruity. Though the malt is sweet underneath, hops appropriately dominate the flavor. They're more citrusy than the nose led me to expect, but there's also a nice spicy, basil-like quality to them. Light fruitiness closes out this very dry-fininshing beer. The body is full, but soft and creamy."
"D: Though this is a good looking beer with a smooth feel ,I kept finding myself turn to words like slight, moderate and light to modify descriptions. The ""Inversion"" seems to have left left this sweeter than average, lightly bitter IPA with a moderate to average flavor profile. While very drinkable I don't think I'll be seeking this one out in the future."
"Nice floral aroma of hops and citrus. Moderate carbonation and a nice full mouthfeel with plenty of hoppy bitterness that quickly fades into a brisk caramel finish. Very easy to sip, but the flavor impact isn't exactly overwhelming."
"I am a touch biased when it comes to Deschutes but it's difficult when you have a brewery that makes such great beer. Pours a great coppery hue with decent head and more lacing than expected. Has the coloring of a Hop Rod Rye or Union Jack. Not overpowering Hop and definitely malty. I like that I can have a few of these and not feel like a hop bomb went off in my mouth. Reminds me a little of an East Coast IPA with more focused on the malt and fruit complexities rather than just hop. Great texture and easy drinking are why this beer get's a great review in my book."
"Drinkability: A simple, tasty, easy drinking IPA. It has some nice flavor to it but isn't so over-the-top that you can enjoy a few of these in an evening. I recommend picking a few of these up if you can. Thanks again, John!"
"D- A very drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it. Not your typical IPA, but solid nonetheless."
"Bought this on a whim knowing nothing about it, which usually ends poorly, and was pleasantly surprised. Pours a dark copper with a decent sized off white head. Nicely balanced but definitely still an IPA. Finishes is a bit of candied sweetness. Best part of this may be the drinkability, finished the whole sixer and wasn;t even a little hungover the next day."
"Poured into a pint glass amber-orange with a thick frothy white head, great retention and lacing. I do not notice much of a nose on it. Slight hop aroma, but again it's hard to notice anything. The first to hit the tounge is a great hop hit with other floral flavors. There's a nice faint camel sweet aftertaste. This is a great session AIPA."
"Overall, another well made beer by Deschutes. Some people may be disappointed as this beer doesn't reach the the super high bitterness category, but it's still quite high and I think the hop character interplays with the prominent malt flavors very nicely. An interesting IPA that I like to include in my IPA rotation."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable west coast IPA that I would buy again."
"good ipa but compared to hop henge this is average"
"Overall its a good beer, I would recommend it."
"i have yet to be let down by the deschutes brewery."
"This is an excellent session worthy IPA. Balance is the key here. I am so glad that this is an easily accessable beer for me. A definate must try for any fan of the style."
"Medium body, easy drinking, lingering bitterness at the back, mild sweetness up front. Overall its a little weak. Second taste, I get why this is an IPA but its more like an APA to me. I'm being really critical lately. The bitterness grows, tastes good. I want more in the mid-palate or a LOT more in the back bitterness. I want to have to chew through my IPAs sometimes -- and if you aren't going to give me an IPA with 100 IBUs, attempt to balance the flavors with more interesting flavors. Put some biscuit malt in there...something anything. This beer is a fine, easily available and cheap IPA for the masses. I would recommend it."
"This is very unique in the IPA class. Although not usually what I look for in an IPA, it is smooth and has enough character to make it a good choice. Bonus points for having a name that describes the beer perfectly!"
"im likin the red chair better but to each his own ipa."
"overall another sold representation of a west coast ipa.."
"Another fun experiment from the laboratories of Ohoove this one is a cloudy rusty brown color with a nice off-white head and tremendous lacing. The aroma offers fruity hop edge with some mild alcohol overtone that sort of negates any favorable signs. The flavor comes on with a pretty clear match with the aroma. Grassy hops and wheaty malt. This is relatively thin and tinny with sharp hop bite but not greatly flavorful by my taste buds. It's close to mid-bodied with subtle carbonation. Drinkable enough and it improves as it warms. But a little disappointing."
"D: not bad. Seems more like a session beer in every regard."
"The body was a tad light, but not watery. Very smooth feel had just the right amount of carbonation and all ended up in a dry finish. Real good IPA from a real good brewery."
"D - This beer was different than what I expected, Ive never had anything like this one actually. I loved the layers of flavors & the outstanding balance of the flavor profile. I could easily enjoy 3pints of more of this delicious brew, It's not overly bitter & not to sweet either, making this one of the easiest drinking IPA's Ive ever had! This ones somewhere on the top of my list for IPA's! Definitely worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable for a moderate strength 6.8% IPA. Not sure if I could consume more than 3 or 4 of these in a sitting though I will attest that I could have had some palette fatigue as this beer was the last of the evening. Session IPA? Yes indeed."
"On the whole, not bad, but definitely not my favorite of Deschutes' offerings."
"D: Not super drinkable due to the strong alcohol taste (and abv). Admittedly disappointing, I am used to really enjoying Deschutes brews."
"Deschutes = quality, fo sho!"
"An enjoyable beer for the hop lover. Not one I would drink too many of with a 6.8% abv."
"Notes: Pretty nice, and not a bit disappointed as I was looking to try this one for a while. Maybe not extraordinary but very good nevertheless. I sure hope to have it again with a bit more tiime to enjoy it."
"D- Plenty easy to drink without distracting flavors"
"D: Very drinkable. Seems like a decent warm weather refreshing beer, but there's nothing pulling me back for another. Rather move on to something more interesting. It could even be a pale ale as opposed to an IPA."
"Pours a clear light reddish color body, with a good sized off-white color head, very lasting. Smells very hoppy and citrusy. Has a light taste, pale and a little dusty, light hops, and some citrus. Very tasty, refreshing and light."
"The bitterness punch of this beer is definitely palate fatiguing. In other words I doubt I could finish one back to back. With that being said, as far as hoppy IPA sippers go this can hold its own with some of the best."
"Pours orange, good lacing. Smell, nothing coming across beyond some mild herbalness. For how hoppy the taste can be, it doesn't come across in the aroma. The taste, can be all over the place. Sometimes, it is a delightful astringent bitterness with ample diverse hop quality. Other times, it fades quickly, is replaced with an almost wood and tobacco (maybe they slipped in some oaked tobacco barrels to age it in) denigration of the beer, hence why it suffers in my rating on the last two categories. Maybe these guys are blending not so good batches. Something happened that made this beer not as good as it used to be, but then again, Deschutes has been riding on their past success for a few years now."
"Overall a good hop forward west coast IPA."
"I'm guessing that the hops weren't as pronounced with this beer as they should have been because I drank it a few days after the ""Best by:"" date. I'll need to try a fresh bottle in the Spring of 2010."
"a unique american IPA in form. pretty textbook in appearance and nature. clean pour with a reasonable head. some lace. nose of hops. subdued citrus.. a tad earthy. palate is citrus that leads to a nice bitter. earthy finish... pear and sage. quite a good food beer. probably perfect for indian food."
"Overall impression: Solid NW IPA here."
"D- In spite of its weakness in the smell and mouthfeel, the overall picture is very nice. All in all it comes together quite nicely and is very drinkable."
"D- A fairly easy drinker. The lack of balance from beginning to end really cut into this beers score."
"A great IPA. Good level of hoppiness. Not one of those IPAs that stand alone with just massive levels of hops. This shows real elegance and power in a great package. Highly recommended."
"This is an easy drinking beer that has just enough flavor to keep you interested."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is astringent, sharp carbonated, and edgy. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is semi full. I really like this beer has a great hop flavor with a good malty back bone."
"Not bad, but pretty much the standard IPA. This is very solid though. Lots of hops for the hop heads. Not my favorite from Deschutes, but is worth a try."
"D: overall, a good beer. not quite up there as a favorite compared to other IPAs, but I certainly wouldn't refuse an Inversion if offered."
"D: Very drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable, indeed. A solid culmination of good qualities. This, I could drink time & time again. A good candidate for a session."
"4.0 D: Good beer. Would never turn it down. No flaws, lots of positives."
"Probably the third best IPA I have ever had. This beer is fantastic."
"D: One of my favorite IPAs... after doing a taste-test of 6-7 IPAs in a row, this was a perfect one to finish off with. Makes me ashamed to think of how it was only months ago that I avoided hoppy beers whenever possible, but extremely happy that I've finally turned around."
"drinkability: overall a decent IPA, and I would recommend."
"This is a good, no frills IPA. Sorry I ran out, but I might try something different next time."
"D: not as high as other IPA's I've had. A bit too much for me. Good beer but I didn't want a second right away"
"J"
"Drinkability- Pretty high up there. This could almost be a session beer for me."
"Quite surprised by this one since it had some age to it. It sat in my fridge for way too long and now I must search out some more."
"Mouthfeel is light and nice. Pretty drinkable, but not a ""sit and think about how awesome this beer is"" type of a beer. I could have a couple. I wouldn't turn one down. I wouldn't go looking for it."
"This is a good IPA and a great value. Deschutes' crowning achievement is the consistency of their brews. Nicely done."
"Inversion IPA is a good beer from a great brewery. It has a slight crisp citrusy aroma and is a deep cooper amber color. As an IPA fan there is a slight disappointment in the muted bitterness. You get a solid hit of bitterness as the beer enters the mouth, but it does not remain consistent throughout the mouth. However, where the bitterness leaves off the citrus flavors fill the entire mouth. The beer goes down easy and doesn't leave a harsh after taste. I definitely keep these around as I can't get Bridgeport's IPA in Nevada, and Inversion is a good sub."
"I am reviewing this right after a Red Chair, which did not impress and this one isn't doing much better. Looks good, very red with nice foam and tiered lacing. Not enough balance and not pleasant enough hop flavors. A little too grassy. Its really not a far cry from Red Chair in my opinion. Too dry, not enough classic hop flavor. I just have one of these, and I'm fine with that."
"This ale poured with about an inch of head which dissipated down to about half and stayed throughout. The color of this ale was darker amber then some IPA's. Smelled of pine, and tasted of hoppy pine. Solid taste and smell with a hearty piney finish! This is a nice IPA I plan on buying again."
"D- Not my favorite from Deschutes that I have had but overall a nice drinker. Something to calm the malt likers with."
"Pours amber with a rocky off-white head that slowly settles to a thin cap. Smells grassy and of bitter citrus, but also light and clean. The taste is also light, clean, and bright with citrus, followed by a short burst of sweet malt, some graininess, and then a nice lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth with a nice bite at the end. Quite drinkable, this is a nice sixpack beer."
"Semi-dry with a lingering bitterness that leaves you wanting more until about beer number 1 and a half."
"D- Easy drinking IPA that had a very balanced flavor."
"D: Very drinkable beer from Deschutes (as are most of their beers), goes down very easy and would be an excellent beer to relax with after a long day."
"taste is smooth and creamy, nice bitterness, grapefruit hops, citrus notes, touch of caramel, and some pine, ends bitter."
"D_A somewhat empty IPA in flavour and body. There really isn't much to it. This ends up being a vehicle for a bitter aftertaste without good hop flavour."
"Inversion IPA pours a surprisingly dark amber color that is similar to a reddish maple. Head size is just right, with nice density and lacing. The aroma is a sort of sappy smell that exudes a decent amount of piney hops along with a generous amount caramel malts. The hops don't really stand out like they should on an IPA. The taste is majorly defined by moderately bitter and sticky caramel malt character. It has the bitterness of a typical IPA, but very little pine and a barely noticeable floral quality A lot of tealike characteristics as it warms, especially in the midpalate and finish. Pretty much zero fruitiness. Very little showcasing of any hops, a very lackluster IPA. Medium-thick body and matching medium carbonation. A drinkable beer, but boring. Where are the hops? Deschutes is an amazing brewhouse that knows how to make a great IPA (Red Chair). It is a shame that their year-round IPA is so comparatively weak."
"More of a balanced IPA, and more herbal than the ones I prefer. A solid effort by Deschutes, though this might be my least favorite of the Deschutes beers. That should tell you how good their beers in general are."
"Pours a clear copper color with a finger of creamy off-white head that eventually develops into a nice layer atop the glass. The nose is filled with mostly citrus and piney hops with some sweet malt aromas. The flavor is bitter hops upfront with some malt and finishes sweet and strongly bitter with a slightly dry finish. The body is medium with a nice amount of carbonation. This is a good beer although it does come across a little hot."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a good beer. Watch out for the ABV. It will sneak up on you. This is a good beer to sit down and enjoy a couple."
"Easy drinker, kept reaching for sips quite frequently."
"D: As said before this beer is definitely one you could drink all night if you are in to the style at the moment. But be careful as the ABV is sneaky."
"Pours a beautiful with a sticky foamy head that laces down the glass. Smell is citrusy piny sticky caramely woody hops and malts. Taste is caramel, piny hops, citrusy hops, bitter and sweet all in one. Mouthfeel is a tad creamy and drinkability is huge for this brew."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a 6.8%, I'd have said it was a high-5 low-6 if asked blindly as it drinks so smoothly. That is both a benefit and a detriment, as I felt like the alcohol flavor was a little underutilized, but still, an easy-drinking, definitely sessionable beer."
"Overall a good session IPA."
"D: Not a bad beer by any means, would like to try it if I knew if it was fresh or not to see what I am getting myself into, but as for the six pack I have now, it's just an adequate beer overall."
"Pours ordinary amber with generous, meringue-like jiggly head that retains a thin layer down through the pint. Nose is very fruity with some candyish aromas in there too. On the palate there's a balance of sweet caramel malt with sharp citrusy hop flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Very drinkable."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It could have been a bit heavier but it was a nice combination of malts and hops, which made it well worth its while."
"D: Quite a nicely balanced IPA, and I certainly like that in the style. It could potentially start skirting on approaching DIPA territory very easily, but that's fine with me. I'd like to have this around from time to time as a bit of a regular rotation."
"This is a pretty big and bold IPA. A very healthy dose of citrusy hops flavors with generous amounts of malty notes to balance things out. A little bitter, but definitely passable in this aspect. Mouthfeel was a little heavier than anticipated. Somewhat sweet, but without overdoing it. It was indeed good, but I couldn't really see myself drinking more than one of these at a time."
"I like this beer, its an interesting take on the IPA and its complex, different flavor is a nice change every once in a while."
"A tasty beer, no doubt, but there are a few things that keep this from being in my fridge full time. A great one-bottle beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. This ale appears a hazed deep copper color with about an inch of thick off white foam. The head lasts till my glass is empty leaving behind a sticky lace in it's path. Smells and tastes of mildly resinous pine, citrus such as grapefruit and orange, toasted grains, and just the right amount of sweet malts to bring it all together. This IPA was medium bodied and amply carbonated. Happy to have had the chance to try this one. Check it out if you can."
"D- Very drinkable, despite slightly syrupy mouthfeel."
"Overall a pretty good IPA but not really what I expect (or crave) when I think of a hop-forward IPA."
"Have had other Deschutes beer all of which are good. This beer is solid but not outstanding"
"Overall Impression: The bitterness is prominent, while the hops aroma and flavor is not; a solid IPA worth drinking"
"A slow sipping IPA and one to savor. The assertive hop bitterness keeps telling you to take your time with this IPA. A nice product by Deschutes.."
"D: Refreshing. This is a solid IPA. Deschutes has yet to disappoint!"
"EDIT: In looking through other reviews a lot of people seem to think the hops are citrusy. Maybe there was something wrong with me that night. In reflection there may have been a slight citrus flavor. But I was practically raised in a forest of pine trees so I stand by my original opinion that it's mostly piney hops. ;-) To each their own. Cheers!"
"Booze is pretty well hidden and the bitterness is tolerable for a hop head."
"T: quite balanced. Nice hop presence, but not overpowering."
"D=Very drinkable, moderate alcohol"
"This is one of the better mass-quantity IPAs around... Great intensity and balance to the aromas and flavors, while being pretty affordable to boot! Highly recommended, yet another excellent beer from Deschutes."
"Drinkability - Solid IPA, but not quite what I would have expected. It goes down smooth, and doesn't hint at almost 7%."
"Overall this is a solid, balanced IPA that's incredibly easy to drink and is well worth a shot."
"D: Nice balance between malt and hops, very drinkable. Would like to have again."
"- Fairly drinkable.. but between a good sessional as their pale... or some other IPA's out there.. would and do pass this one up often."
"Pours a redish gold color with at foamy head. Not much lacing. Smells of hops, grapefruit and some cirtus. Taste starts out good and malty with a caramel flavor to kick this thing off. Follows up with some that hop attack that I come to expect from a good IPA. The only complaint I have is it s a bit on the watery side, but thats not too noticeable. Easily drinkable."
"Excellent IPA. I've had quite a few bottles of this particular IPA, since finding it for $7 per sixer. It's quite a bargain at that price point. It's a very solid IPA. Amber, red gold liquid sits below a frothy head that leaves a ton of lacing. The aroma is excellent. There are some great floral and citric hop notes with a solid caramel malt backbone. This backbone comes through to the flavor, but the hops aren't quite as full as they are in the aroma. It has a good feel, not incredible but solid. It's just a really solid IPA, a great way to get your hop fix for less than a buck and a quarter per beer. Deschutes makes some great beers. I tend to underestimate them for no particular reason. I don't know why. I can think of a great number of excellent beers that they make. Black Butte, alone, is one of my very favorite porters, and it's also affordable. Let's not even get into the fancy seasonal releases. Alright, here's how it should go: Inversion IPA is another great beer from the excellent Deschutes Brewery."
"You know, I like what Deschutes does with their staple IPA from a flavor standpoint. Herbal and earthy hops interwoven into a profile that is a bit complex and well balanced, leaving the bigger West Coast hop bombs flavors to their seasonals. I just wish that those flavors did a better job of convering up some of the heat in this, which definitely hurt the feel and drinkibility for me. Dial that ABV back a bit and I would have enjoyed this tons."
"D: I could probably drink a few of these. The astringency is present but not overwhelming. The alcohol is not immediately noticeable."
"A good inline session beer."
"This is a solid drinkable brew."
"This is an easy enough drinker and went well with my dinner."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little on the creamy side. Easy drinking but the flavors leave me wanting a little more."
"D: While not being the most sessionable IPA it is quite drinkable, three or four of these in a night would be an excellent session or game watching beer. Good IPA, would recommend to anybody looking for something a little more on the hoppy side."
"I'd highly recommend a tulip for this one as I think it brought out some of the more complex qualities that a tumbler could not."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with an inch of light tan head that left very nice, sticky lacing. An attractive Orangey/Amber color. Strong hop aroma with piney scent being strongest. Flavor is what was expected after experiencing the aroma. The pine flavors hit first with a nice citrus finish that lingers, but doesn't cling to the tongue. Very good body with a solid malt foundation. Very good drinkability, my palate tires quickly of most IPAs (2-3 and I'm usually ready to switch up), but I can drink several of these without suffering palate fatigue. An above average brew from a brewery that makes solid, dependable beers and rarely makes a misstep."
"Deep orange color with two fingers nice retention to head, nice lacing. Complex nose, you can sense the biscuity malt. Fairly bitter hops and citrus (grapefruit) upfront in taste, and biting alchohol and hops again in the finish. Very drinkable. One of the best IPAs brewed in Bend (props out to Ms. Cornett across town). Not the signature product from Deschutes, but a must include if you are attempting to come to terms with the depth and variety of one of NW's best craft breweries product line."
"D-Pretty highgiven the ABV"
"Drinkability was pretty good, this is one where you could session and completely ruin your tastebuds."
"D: Picked up a six-pack and will definitely enjoy the rest. A great, easy-to-drink example of the style."
"Pours a nice orange rusty color. Moderate head with medium size bubbles and descent lacing as the beer is consumed. Drinks very well for an IPA. The beer is well balanced with an obvious thick piney resin winning the palate, however, still drinkable with plenty of flavor."
"Nice hoppy aromas with citrus and pine. There is more malt in the flavor but hops dominate. Medium bodied with a long finish. With the abundance of carbonation and hops in a medium bodied beer drinkability is just okay."
"Drinkability- Not too complex, yet still tasty. A nice beer, and one could probably drink quite a few in a sitting, though not enough interest generated to warrant more than one at a time."
"6/4/6/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"A nice, solid IPA. Deschutes makes much better then this IMO, but all things considered, this is a beer I wouldn't hesitate to order again."
"I don't even smoke."
"A solid bitter english style IPA with just a hint of that good old PNW citrus hoping. Earthy and green, yet very finished feeling. A good change from the usual IPAs, although this one is a touch strong for a session brew, and not quite bold enough for a sipper. But pretty solid none the less. I think I need to revisit Inversion a bit more often."
"I know it says ""American IPA", but this is an American version of an English IPA, and a decent one at that. Pours clear gold with a puffy white head. Aroma is full of citrus and hops, which is strangely lacking in the taste. Lots of hops, but the of bitter variety. Nice malt balance. I prefer the west-coast IPA style, but this is okay."
"D-Very nice session IPA flavorwise, though a bit high in ABV for the flavor."
"It's a lovely thing."
"D: Very good, regularly drinking IPA."
"D: I had two pints, rather enjoyable to be honest."
"D - Solid, I could definitely down a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is not dilute by any means, but thinner than what I was expecting, and actually in this case less is more. Inversion becomes a sessionable quasi hop-crack."
"D: a staple for IPA's it has that hopped rawness to it. Nice beer! Just a few will do me fine it could be an all night drinker. What a ""good"" beer!"
"drinkability: good"
"M: Mouthfeel is thick and dry, I felt thirsty after drinking this one! Low to average carbonation and bitter at times."
"What can I say? There is many things I cannot stand about this beer. Firstly, the malt profile is astringent and very bitter. I just doesn't work for me. From a brewery that's usually top notch, this is a lackluster effort that tastes out of sink, and is not terribly drinkable."
"Thanks, riversideAK (from the other site), for the opportunity and to Schmittymack and cocoapuph for the chance to re-visit"
"Overall, very drinkable. Goes down easy and has a nice cleansing feel."
"D- Easy to drink, would be a good beer to start someone in on IPAs. The hop taste is light and nice."
"This was a really raw and unrefined version of an IPA. In fact, it was one of the most bitter version of the style I have tried. Although I found it a bit rough around the edges, hop heads may rejoice at this untamed beast of a beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little heavy, and for an IPA, it is something I could have done without."
"Not a bad choice, if available."
"picked up a six at Jackson Hole Wine on the way back to Rock Springs after hiking Static Mountain...best by date of 10/29/08 printed on the label"
"The mouthfeel is very nice with not to much bitterness from the hops. The carbonation does not last all that long. The hence causes the beer to be a VERY drinkable beer to me. Sadly I can't yet get this is Houston, but hopefully sometime soon! Nice work as always from the guys in Bend!"
"This was a pretty drinkable brew, rather easy to knock down a number of these at a sitting. I'll pay this one a visit again for sure."
"Appearance is orange amber with a thin head. Smell is hoppy, light fruit and sweet malt. Taste has right up front hops with grapefruit and light spice. Mouthfeel is medium with slick body and good carbonation. A good IPA, but one I wouldn't stick with all night."
"The drinkability is good, not a bad call, drinks a bit kike a small BW for those that like that style. Prosit, MK"
"Poured a brownish-red with big swells of carbonation which result in a 2 finger off white quickly fading head. Smells of potent citrusy hops. Very pleasant and tangy. Tastes of orange peel, hops, a bit of caramel and spice. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied, and expectedly bitter going down."
"D: Decent IPA. The hops sit at the back of the tongue of a while, but doesn't punch your face like a lot of other IPAs do. I could definitely drink a few of these though."
"Very nice - A solid, very drinkable, traditional American IPA - Thanks again, Bill!"
"d - pretty good. I think I'm not huge on IPAs right now."
"Served in my SA Sensory pint. Best by 11/7/08 stamped on the bottle. Poured a translucent copper-red with a one inch off-white head that quickly lost cohesion before eventually settling into a broken cap of foam and ringlets. Some spotty lacing present during the tasting. Floral hops and grapefruit evident in the nose. Taste consistent with nose, but grapefruit flavor is amplified, leaving a lingering bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light and also a little creamy; effervescence nicely balances out the mouthfeel. A little too bitter and astringent for my palate; however, I have to confess that IPAs are not my style of choice."
"Pours a beautiful thick foamy head. Initial aroma is great! Wonderful hop aromas. Creamy mouthfeel, sweet and nice body, I detect some vanilla tastes as well. This is a great bargain too, affordable and a true NW IPA. Hops dominate but are not over bearing. A definite winner for its category. I love this beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Full-bodied IPAs are awesome. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest, but with a little more fruity character. Not really built for hot summer days, but great any other time."
"D: Overall a great session brew. I hope I get a chance to have this on-tap someday."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip, pours a crisp bubbly orange with an abundant frothy head that leaves great lacing. Aroma is dominated by crisp citrus hops with sweet malts right behind. The taste was a nice balance between citrus hops and sweet biscuity caramel malts, hops linger in the background, leaving you wanting another sip. The beer is light, crisp and has just a slight alcohol presence. This is a decent IPA, one I would certainly buy on occasion were it available in my area."
"12 oz. bottl from a sixer."
"This is a great example of a first class IPA that screams PNW hops but is incredibly drinkable(even more so than Bridgeports IPA). This is a fairly high ABV regular IPA but it shows no heat and the finish is very smooth."
"D - a most enjoyable brew."
"The first taste picks up a big, biscuity-sweet caramel base. Hops are quick to assault the sides and back of the palate with piney, spicy hop oils...just the IPA I was looking for after a long flight. Mouthfeel is exceptional: crisp, medium-thin body with a perfect carbonation level and a lasting, hoppy bite that grabs hold and refuses to let go. All in all, I was happy with Inversion IPA. Although the aroma was a bit of a let-down, I'll be saving my second bottle to see how it performs in a ""real"" glass."
"Best before 8/05/08 clearly printed on the bottle, kudos to Deschutes for indicating the freshness on their bottles. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber color with a really nice off-white head. The aroma is sweet malt and hints of caramel with a lot of citrusy hops. The taste is a burst of citrus hops, with a malt backbone that takes a major backseat to the hops. I would like to have seen a little more malt in this one to provide more of a backbone for the strong grapefruit hop flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very nice texture. Ovearall, Inversion IPA is a great PNW IPA that is recommended. Another great brew from Deschutes."
"D - Good brew for the style, for sure. I maybe wouldnt want another back-to-back, but definitely enjoyable."
"A beautifull IPA. Inversion is a medium brown with a creamy tan head. Very good retention. The nose has a nice bouquet of floral and fruity hops all mellowed by scents of rich candy malts. I didn't find the taste quite as impressive. The malt structure is lacking a bit, but there are some good hop flavors going on. A medium body has heavy carbonation and takes a while to mellow out. A decent IPA."
"Easy to slug down. Great drinkability, with a solid mouthfeel for style: a little light in general, but I'm willing to sacrifice heft in order to showcase the hops. Well done."
"D - Pretty damn good. I'll drink this one again. Might even try to clone it brewing. Aroma could use a boost, it is a bit subdued. Worth seeking out. Another winner from Deschutes."
"D - This is a very good IPA. My first from Deschutes and I was quite impressed."
"Not as aggressively hoppy as i like my IPAs but you can tell that this is a well crafted beer."
"Drinkability is high. Good flavors and relatively low alcohol make this beer very easy to consume."
"Great West Coast IPA. Lots of breweries on the left side who produce great hop taste and this is one of them. I would have this again if I saw it."
"D - Good beer. Not the best IPA I have had, but is definitely quality stuff."
"Tried this one on tap in a pub in SF. Poured into a shaker pint, with little head (less than 1 finger). Amber with creamy head, very standard looking. The smell is the best thing about this beer, clean and fresh with piney, citrusy hops. Taste is just a bit more muddled, but does finish nice and bitter with a white grapefruit aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fine, but I am ranking the drinkability a bit low because something about the first half of the taste doesn't make me want another."
"Drinkability is decent on this one. I would definitely be able to drink a few more (if only I had easy access to Deschutes)."
"Mouthfeel varies from what I'd expect from appearance. More of a full to medium body, even a little grainy. Lighter carbonation."
"a smooth beer, not the best, not the worst, but I would drink it again"
"D - Pretty decent overall, a sixer of this goes down quite nicely. Not bad, I could do another anytime and would say this is one worth trying."
"I wasn't so sure of Inversion at first but it didn't take long for me to really start enjoying this beer. A really great, unique hoppiness combines with a great mouthfeel to make for a damn fine IPA. I'd love to be able to pick Inversion up around here."
"Nice honey color with a white head. Smells hoppy and citrusy but not overpowering. Taste is nice, bitter with good balance. This is a nice drinking IPA. It's a nice change from the slug you in the face bitter IPAs that are en vogue."
"Pours a dark yellow with an off-white head that leaves a thick layer of lacing. Smells of citrus, but the taste is just the slightest bit disappointing compared to what the aroma promises. A strong amount of bitter hops flavor, with a relatively mild citrus flavor compared to a San Diego IPA. It could really use a higher dose of citrus to balance out the aspirin taste. Still, the mildness stops it from being overwhelming as some IPAs can be, and as a result it's a very drinkable beer."
"A clear copper with sticky lacing. Floral and herbal dry hop presence, WITHOUT a blast of the notable PacNW big juicy citrus and pine. Incredibly drinkable, and like I said, my number one fallback beer. Great job Deschutes, keep up the good work :)"
"Clearly balanced toward the hops, but the malty sweetness is definitely present. Depending on the day or your mood, this could (has been in my past) a session-able beer (though it is a bit big to be a true session beer at 6.8%. The hop bitterness lingers for a good little while, you'll need to drink some water before being able to taste something else. After several years, this is still my go to everyday type single-IPA in a sixer (for a reasonable price even in Alaska)."
"This is a nicely crafted IPA that I could easily make a session out of. It's a nice hop fix with some malt backbone to balance. Alcohol does not provide an astringency like some other ipas have. Also, no off flavors or tannins."
"A great drinking IPA."
"d - this was surprisingly easy to drink although not particularly great tasting."
"Poured a clear orangey amber, head was thick and lacing very prevalent. Aroma was a bit of citrus. Taste was long and lingering yet at the same time a bit throttled down. Mouthfeel was good and balanced. Just right! Had a English feel which is fine by me. A very nice IPA and you can't go wrong here."
"D - It's a good beer. Reminds me a lot of SN pale ale."
"A final tear is shed that this beer is still not sold in Kansas before I go to the fridge to grab another. Supply be damned, this is great!"
"This was a pretty good IPA and I'd definitely make it a staple if I wasn't heading back east in a few months. The appearance was fantastic with a clear golden amber body and an abundant fluffy white head. The smell seemed predomminantly cascade or willamette hops, I couldn't tell exactly which. The taste was fairly standard for an IPA, but the hop profile was interesting and tasty. The mouthfeel was a little bit light bodied for me, and could have used some more umph, but it didn't detract from the drinkability. I would gladly get this regularly on-tap or in bottle form."
"The anticipation to try this release was well worth it. The ABV is well hidden and it's a balanced and well-rounded AIPA. If I lived out west I would buy a lot 6-packs."
"Medium in body and fairly smooth. Feels good on the tongue with some tingle. Gets a little chewy and feels bigger than it is. Great drinkability - there is some complexity, which can slow you down a bit. Solid no nonsense IPA."
"Drinks well, looks good."
"It produced a bug, rocky, off-tan head on the pour. The color was a slightly cloudy deep-amber. OMFG, was this intensely hoppy in the mouth! I love hops, but I almost coughed in astonishment, and that rarely happens. The neck label mentioned ""... layers of soft caramel notes", but they were barely evident on the finish and not at all in the mouth. The nose was likewise redolent with hops. The finish had the same intense citrus/hop flavor, but slightly tempered by the malt. Wow! It produced a beautiful, sticky lacing throughout. This is my favorite Deschutes product, bar none."
"Balanced bubbles and medium body make for a nice mouth feel and a decent finish. I'm going to have another after this one."
"d: A very generous JohnGalt1 tossed this delicious IPA in as an extra. I wish these guys were local."
"D- I think it's more drinkable than other IPAs, but still too much for me. Feels bigger than it is."
"A nice IPA from this great OR brewery in the classic west coast style."
"Pours hazy yellow with almost green tints. Great head that lasts awhile. The nose is very hoppy and somewhat sweet. At first taste, grapefruit hop flavors abound. slight malts on the finish and some slight spice flavors. Good mouthfeel, especially when it warms. Best warming ability of an IPA around. Drinkability is decent. A good offering from Deschutes, and a staple, standard IPA."
"Good IPA, and I LOVE Deschutes.... not my favorite PNW IPA, but close... not sure what is throwing me off (Chinook?). I am probably in the minority, but I liked Quale Springs more."
"This is a damn good IPA. Generally compared to other IPAs, this one has a slightly more subdued aroma, but has a great hop flavor (I think I must really like the particular bittering cultivar used) and a good balancing of malt. I would drink this on a regular basis if I had the opportunity; it's really good and I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability was better than some IPAs but not really a session beer."
"Really, really piney. Too much of a piney flavor, actually, that wears on the taste buds relatively quickly, lowering the drinkability. I don't know exactly what it is -- it may be the style of hops. It's different, and it's certainly interesting, but of relatively limited use in terms of flavor as far as I can tell. Not nearly as citrusy as the bottle claims and as most other 2IPAs."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a pretty enjoyable beer that I could drink for a while."
"It is a bit hard to rate this beer. I thought it a bit unique among the hundreds of IPAs out there (interesting mouthfeel and flavors), but I found it only slightly above average when it comes to how much I enjoyed it. A nice beer - and I'd recommend it probably more than my numeric ratings would indicate."
"Perfect carbonation, but a bit on the thick side. Very sessionable despite the alcohol content."
"Pours a nice shade of amber with nice, thick head with good retention. Dissolves for the most part but some manages to stick around for a while. Floaties? What? Lots of ""stuff"" in suspension in the drink. At first I thought it was bubbles until I realized they werent moving. Really wasnt too keen on that. Smell is strong of hops. I've heard the term ""floral"" applied to IPA smells and this is the first where I get a ""floral"" sense from it. Taste is great. Really a spectacular IPA. Nice and hoppy, bitter, with a dry aftertaste but what makes this so good and drinkable is that its not overpowering. Theres enough hops to make their point and not too many to distract from the beer. Nice smooth, crisp mouthfeel, easy going down. A very drinkable beer. Atfer the first I was left wanting another. Very impressive offering from Deschutes."
"D - A nice brew. Could session without tiring."
"D: Another great IPA to try, another good beer from Deschutes, this is a very good IPA, very tasty, need to buy a sixer of this before it disappears for the year, a great hop-based ale."
"Pours a cloudy deep orange-ish amber with an off white / tan head. Aromas of grapefruity hops and a small peppery dry malt. In the taste was all a grapefruity hop bitterness. A big malty mouthfeel and a bitter dry hop aftertaste. Big hops in the nose and the taste. A very good IPA."
"Recommended by bartender, not a bad choice, but when Pliny the Elder is a couple taps away from it, then that is a problem"
"Inversion comes with a cool view from Bend with a freshness date. The appearance is a cloudy amber with a healthy two finger head that leaves a sea foam on the side of the glass. The smell is hoppy and the tastes complex with multiple hop varieties. It is a fairly carbonated IPA with a sweet and mellow aftertaste. I grew up with Deschutes Brewery since the early 90's and their beers have always been a staple here in Portland."
"Pours a somewhat hazy medium copper hue with a nice two finger light khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a very nice lacing that lasts. Stickiness is amazing, how it should be for the style. Smell is like cocaine, I can't stop putting my nose up to it. Wait, I didn't say that...moving on. Huge dirty citrus and pine with a wonderful caramel background that tops this one off just right. Surprisingly the flavor begins with the sweet caramel malt that is quickly thrown aside by the a clean pine hop taste. Grapefruit emerges soon after followed by a bittering effect that leaves the mouth pretty dry, but not too much. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, different for this style but I like it. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Like I said, nothing like a solid West Coast IPA to end the night right. I'll definitely be looking for this beer in future trades. Give this one a try for sure."
"Good."
"Drinkability- The very first time I tried this beer it definitely wasnt my favorite IPA. Saying that though, one thing that I always did think was that this beer was super duper drinkable. Something about it is just good. It goes down super smooth and I really really enjoy it."
"Mouthfeel is exceptionally clean for a 6.5%+. A little briney and warm at times, but never sticky. Great aftertaste and smell make this a good drinker. The slightly acrid body eases up after the first half-glass, too."
"Pours a dark hazy copper with a huge head that dies slowly and laces all over the place throughout. Smells of citrus, rind, hops and sweet malt. Smells great and a little different from a traditional IPA. Tastes the same as it smells along with a lot of bitter grapefruit. Feels creamy and full in the mouth and is extremely drinkable. Deschutes has blown me away during this visit to Oregon and are churning out some great brews."
"That said, it's got a great medium body, and it drinks easy for close to a 7% ABV. I would love to find this on tap somewhere to compare, and I'll definitely be buying it again. It's certainly a big, interesting ale, just too piney for me."
"D: Overall a great IPA. I just wish we could get Deschutes beers where I am."
"Very nice ipa on the light side,extremely drinkable would be a good everyday drinker. Wish I could get this one local ordered it from Liquid Solutions. Would keep this on a hand if I could"
"Pours a hazy copper/amber color with a respectable head of foam. Small bits of yeast hover throughout. Strong pine cone-hop aroma. Bready caramel malts are overshadowed by a thick blanket of floral hops. Burnt/earthy flavor and an impressive hop bitterness in the finish. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Plenty of lasting bitterness in this one, and a solid IPA overall."
"Md body with some dextrinous thickness and modest carbonation. I found this beer to be 'heavy'. The beer sticks and the hops give a dark character. I'm a fan of grapefruit pithy beers, which sems to come off lighter and flightier, so this beer was hard for me to get into."
"Overall, a hop-head IPA without much balance, but good hop flavor and the bitterness will satisfy any lover of that little green flower."
"on edit: now that i am a total hop-head i looked back on this review and chuckled to myself...i drink primarily IPA's now and it is nice to see how tastes have changed...this is now one of my favorite IPA's that i have had on numerous occasions..."
"Got this bottle from CurlyGavzilla in Telluride. 'Best Before 7/25/07' on bottle. Pours a lovely orange/copper with thick white head. Nice, zesty hop nose. Sweet, then quickly detours to sharp, big hop flavor. Crisp, with a long hop finish. Well-balanced for a big hop beer."
"Not the most drinkable IPA in this form. One of few beers I have found that is better in a bottle than in cask. I'll buy it in a sixer and pass on the cask."
"This is one dangerously drinkable IPA. It has the robust taste of some DIPAs, but a (slightly) lower ABV, so in that regard, it's a good choice to satisfy you longing for a real hop punch without getting punch drunk!"
"Thanks to Noxious26 for the bottle!"
"Overall-Might be like watching a hyped up movie, but I was dissapointed in this beer based on the labels description. I really like mirror pond, but this one isn't that special."
"Stunning reddish-orange color, with generous head. Smell is nice, typical of the style in it's suggestions of citrus, caramel, and subtle pine. Taste is abundantly sweet & malty, with ample hops becoming evident in the finish. Mouth is creamy malt, zingy hop and just a little sticky. A highly drinkable example of an IPA."
"Thanks goes to JohnGalt1 for throwing this in as an extra."
"D: It would be hard for me to drink too much since it is so bitter."
"This beer pours a amber yellow with ample head that does not lace. Very present aroma that is common to this style of beer. Without a doubt one of the more balanced American IPAs that I have ever had. Very tasty without a great deal of bitterness from boiled hops. This probably gets most of its characteristics from dry-hopping and the strain of yeast used."
"D - Overall I would say it is very nice, sessionable and well balanced IPA. There was a touch of alcohol that started to show up by the end, but other then that, very nice indeed."
"D- It is pretty good. A bit to big of malt body for me and wrong blend of hops but still very tasty. I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these."
"D: Not bad but not totally working for me."
"D: Pretty good IPA, I think I like this a little better than when I tried it on tap. Still maybe a little too bitter on the aftertaste."
"If you're a hop head, this is the beer for you. If you aren't a hop head, it might be a little strong for you. Personally, I think it's unbalanced hop bitterness actually detracts from it's overall appeal. Although, the brewer obviously had extreme hop profile as a goal, and reached it."
"I had this beer on cask. It poured a deep amber with a thin head. The smell was nice, citrus zest, with a little toasted malt to back it up. The cask made this creamy smooth, excellent mouthfeel and very low carbonation. The caramel sweetness hits first, kind of unusual for an IPA, then the citrus hops layer over the sweetness very nicely. If you see this on cask, it is a must try."
"This beer has a very nice mouthfeel heavier than some. No carbonation bite. I remember this beer being more hop-foward, it seems more balanced than in the past. Still very nice brew."
"Other comments: Maybe I've just had one too many IPAs recently, but right now I'm thinking you really need to be in the mood for beers like this: another one of those ""flavor bombs""."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark red-orange in color, almost brown. The taste was really fruity but not citrus-like at all. The smell was crisp and fruity as well. I drank this very quickly. This is a really well built beer and at $6.50 a sixer it can't be beat. Easily my favorite from Deschutes."
"Pours a light orange color with thick dense head the leaves quickly. Citrus hops come through with a initial taste that I have to imagine what licking a pine tree must be like. Mouthfeel is thick and lucious. Drinkability is high and I think this is one of the better IPAs put there."
"Overall-This is one very good IPA. Will have to add to my upcoming Horizontal IPA tasting I will be hosting."
"Medium bodied with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Good drinkability."
"Good beer, I would take it far above other popular beers, yet I'm tainted towards the san diego big bitter hopness."
"Well balanced brew here. Has a moderate caramel malt backbone which smooths over the citrusy, fruity hops pop in the finish. Smooth medium-bodied feel and mid-range bitterness make this one easy-drinking IPA. Another solid effort by the folks at Deschutes."
"Bottle. Pours a red-golden-brown color. It has a thick long-lasting bubbly head with lots of lacing. Smell is of hops, but also some frutiy tones. Bitter hops at the front end of the taste and then even more bitter and hopsy in the aftertaste, which lingers for a while. The fruit-tones didn't seem to come out in the taste, which was mainly of hops."
"Very nice on tap and highly recommended for a session IPA."
"Drinkability- Wrong catagory if you ask me. Under another it would be a perfectly fine brew. Not bad tasting at all, just mislabeled IMO."
"Alright, tasting time. My first thought after my first swallow is that the taste is similar to the smell, somewhat muted. Definitely tasty and satisfying, a fine example of the style and another solid offering from an excellent brewery. After a few more drinks, I'm liking the taste even better. The NW hops are ample, but it is good without being over-the-top kick-ass bitter. Very smooth, nice mouthfeel and no trace of 6.8% abv, highly drinkable. The smell even opens up a bit as the beer warms in the glass. Yes, now, just before hitting that review button, I must bump the smell score up from 3.5 to 4.0 as it's really come around to reveal an ale with loads of depth and character. Overall quite good. I will get it again some day, and recommend it to my brother who is a newb and can't handle hop bombs."
"D - A decent IPA."
"Hazy amber with an off-white head, a bit dark for an IPA. Hoppy aroma with some caramel malt and citrus. Big caramel malt flavor, undertones of grapefruit and orange, and a long-lasting hoppy finish. Great creamy mouthfeel, medium carbonation. An more balanced IPA, and all around a solid beer."
"A delightful west coast IPA: a friend brought it back from Oregon, and I'd definitely buy it again."
"D: The ale is well-crafted. I could easily pound a few of these although the 6.8% could be a bit of a drawback. An excellent representation of the style."
"Man I love this IPA. Pours reddish amber with off white, creamy head with very pronounced lacing. Great floral/citrus aroma. Crisp mouthfeel, pronounced but not overwhelming hop flavor. This is my new favorite beer. With the fairly high ABV, 2 or 3 will make you feel pretty happy. Deschutes brews great stuff and this is definately one of the top five."
"Very small head, slighly cloudy amber in color, cloudiness could be due to the cold temperature, but after a few minutes hasnt cleared up any. Bit of a citrusy smell. Taste very bitter. Not quite what I look for in an IPA, but it's still good to enjoy slowly. 6.8% abv. Ahh... now I see on the bottle ""Best by 12/23/06"". I may have to find a fresher bottle, or perhaps get out to Bend and try it on tap."
"Overall: This beer is good. Not too much above average though. Nothing makes me think GREAT!"
"D: Another great example of the west coast ipa. Smooth, flavorful, well balanced, and bitter. An excellent brew that would be in my normal rotation if I could get it regularly. Thanks for the opportunity Brian!"
"Notes: I've got another bottle on hand, which i'll compare this sample to. If it differs greatly, i'll re-review. Special thanks to KingG for the sample."
"D: Definitely. This isn't my first time drinking this and there is a reason. Deschutes doesn't do anything spectacular with there IPA, but it is solid. Wont be the best IPA you'll ever have, but its definitely, worthy of a purchase."
"Drinkability/Notes: I sure am glad my bro-in-law brought some of this back with him from Denver for X-mas. A really well balanced IPA with plenty of citrusy hop character and caramel malt to offset the hops. Starts with a hoppy bang, the middle balances things out then ends with another hoppy bang. Wish this was available in my area on a regular basis. Not an over the top IPA but one that is relatively easy on the palate and easy to drink. I could easily make a session of these, howver, the 6.8% abv will sneek up on you. Overall, a really good IPA and on that I wouldn't hesitate buying again. Glad I have one more left. Seek and enjoy, highly recommended."
"Overall impression: Definitely skewed toward the hops - nice hoppy flavor without being too bitter. Drinkable, especially considering ABV."
"In my mind Deschutes is very underrated they brew a vast array of great styles and sadly alot of people in the midwest and east never have had the chance to try their wares... now enough of that on to the review.This poured an odd kinda hazed brownish orange with a nice tight one finger head that never totaly settles,well that Oregon hop profile really shows itself like I knew it would quite citrusy with lemon I think being predominant over top of caramelly biscuit dough malt its not all one dimensional.The hop dominates but it has character tea-like up front with a nice resiny,spruce like finish all the long a decent sized sweetish malt base holds its own thru to the finish.A nice hoppy quaffing IPA I would have never guess this was so high in alc its very drinkable,well done."
"Sharp, dry and crisp  finishing with a dollop of oily goodness. Yum Yum."
"Appearance is orange with a nice off white head that is very well sustained with outstanding lacing left behind. Nose is a nice fragrance of floral hops and malts. Taste is a bit of caramel malts that is followed by a blast of citrusy hops. This is not a beer for those who eschew hops in their beer. Mouthfeel is very good for the style, medium bodied and very lively on the palate. Drinkability is good. Definitely not a session beer but 2 or 3 is just about right. This is a must try for hopheads and those who enjoy Deschutes!"
"Overall, a very solid IPA from Deschutes."
"A medium plus body with some strength, very easy to drink and quite sessionable at that. Another tasty good drinker from the Pacific NW."
"Not a bad IPA, and definitely better than the previous bottled IPA from Deschutes. Still, I'd like to try this with a little bit better balance."
"Goes down fairly smooth, can't really drink many of these in a row as the hops just pummel you."
"Almost creamy, medium body with decent carbonation. Dry bitter finish. I wouldn't run out searching for this one, but I may grab it in a pinch."
"This was pretty good, but I don't think I'll be rushing out to buy it again anytime soon."
"I like this beer a lot, and its 75 IBUs makes it a step up from their former IPA, Quail Springs, which was somewhat underhopped. The beer is a nearly clear bright copper color with a two finger off white head that sticks around for a while and leaves significant lacing. The nose in this beer changes depending on the temperature. The beer was 55 degrees to begin with, and at that point the smell was all hops; crisp and piney. As the beer warmed toward 60, much more of the malt came out in its smell. For a bitter IPA, this is a balanced beer. The after taste is dominated by its long pine-citric hop finish, but while the beer is still on the palate caramelly malts abound. The mouthfeel is sharp and medium bodied. As much as I like this beer and love the IPA style, this one seems to suffer on the drinkability side. I spend a lot of time wanting Deschutes beers, but I seldom crave this one."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Mouthfeel is bitter without much of a sugary, ballsy malt balance that I was craving in this one."
"Overall, a damn fine IPA. Not as good as I remember it (but that was on tap in Seattle, so probably just a bit more fresh). Wish this was available in MD, so I could drink it routinely."
"Okay drinkability. The lack of any real flavor outside of its bitterness doesn't draw me to this too much. But its okay."
"D - Drinkable. A nice offering from Deschutes, would buy again."
"A good IPA, but only because the bite is strong. Otherwise I'd say it needs more flavor."
"Great offering from Deschutes. I will look for more of their brews."
"My 12oz brown bottle poured a nice cloudy orange/amber color with a thick 2 finger off white head. Aroma was very pleasing. I caught a whiff of pine with a strong citrus orange aroma and a bit floral. This one has got some bitter bite to it, damn. Almost a spicy hop bite in the beginning that tingles the tongue then it fades into a different kind of more dull bitterness that is not nearly as pleasant as the first, but still satifactory. There's a little ctirus in there, but all I really get is a hops piled on more hops. Mouthfeel is creamy at first with a very dry finish. Iversion is a good IPA but not one that stands out above others."
"Slick, soft mouthfeel is pleasantly hefty, yet quaffable. Very drinkable though the somewhat rough hop presence makes this one for hop-heads only. A much more interesting and enjoyable IPA that the previous Quail Springs offering. After many years, Deschutes continues to impress"
"A deep orange IPA with a decent off white head. Aroma is sweetish caramel malts with a zesty, orangey hop zing. The nose is citric hops, with a strong caramel malt presence. Theres a slight sweetness in this slightly fruity, malty ipa, but a firm bitterness balances it very well. Has a nice grapefruity aftertaste. Overall a beer to be reckoned with: strong, pretty big body, firmly bitter, and all this on a thick fruity malt backbone."
"Pretty, pretty brew with a dark mahogany body. Smell is of hops, citrus, and caramel. Taste is overwhelmed by bitter grapefruit, almost disarmingly so. Deschutes cranks out some good brews, most notably their Black Butte Porter, and this one is worthy of their line. All in all a decent IPA..."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a creamy lightly hop oily mouthfeel. The beer is slightly less than medium bodied. This is a very nicely hopped beer. This is a dam good IPA. This would be in my line up more often if I could get it regularly."
"The funky hops come through with the main flavor. Not as overtly ""complex"" as other IPAs out there with multifaceted hop profiles, very nice nonetheless. ""Kind"" aspect to it to me w/ hearty malt backbone. Oily, buttery thickness to the brew making it sit around in the mouth some. Lingered. Dangerously drinkable."
"D- nice to drink a IPA that has a place for malt flavor. One of the more interesting IPA's out there, definetly be back for this one."
"12 ounce bottle, with ""Best By"" dating given on the label. I allowed this one to sit out and warm up for about 30 minutes. Pours a nice burnt orange shade of amber. Supporting a dark eggshell, soft and loose head, slowly forming a thin film. Lacing is slippery but extensive. Nose is of lovely oily hops. This is a satisfyingly hoppy IPA, much better then the 3 or so last ones I've tried lately. Nice sturdy layers of malt underlay this bold and BA worthy brew. Healthy, grainy, oily hop crunch. Real Nice brew"
"Anyway, I find this beer looks great, smells great, but wasn't quite what I was hoping for from an IPA made by Deschutes. I was hoping for something a little more robust with more flavor but this turns out to be an average hoppy hoppy ipa with not much more than hoppy flavor happening to me. it tastes like some great hops, and it feels good in the mouth... I simply find it an average IPA. I've had much better this year."
"Dark, rich golden copper body with two fingers of solid, dense, khaki brown head. Very nice. Nose is full of sweet-edged toffee fruit malt and an equal heaping of sappy, fresh hops. Well-balanced aroma (for an IPA). Taste is huge maltiness up front; sweet, biscuity, caramelly, fruity, toasted and great. Sweetness peaks mid-palate, as tongue-numbing, piney, sappy hop bitterness takes over. I like this a lot! A bit maltier than most IPAs, especially from the PNW. Full-bodied, creamy feel. An excellent job, yet again, by Deschutes!"
"This is why I want to live in the PNW area. Outstanding IPA from Deschutes. Looking forward to trying the Black Butte next."
"Drinkability: very nice IPA here that everyone should enjoy. Easy drinking and flavor drives you to have more than one."
"If you like a hoppy, fresh, light and non peppery IPA, this is for you, Deschutes Brewery has another winner here with this seasonal."
"On tap at Vino's in Roseville. Amber colored with a slight orange tint. Poured with a two finger head. Lacing lingered for a considerable time. Definite aroma of citrus (orange?)and pine. Hops come through strongly. The best thing about this beers is although the flavor was very hoppy as you would want, it also carried a considerable amount of malt to balance it. Creamy mouthfeel. Really an excellent IPA."
"D: A terrific IPA. Enjoyable flavors, would be easy to enjoy another one of these."
"This beer poured a clear orangey amber, head was thick and lacing very prevalent. Aroma was restrained but there, smacked a bit of citrus. the finish was long and lingering yet at the same time a bit throttled down. Hoppier than the discontinued? Quail Springs but not as ramped up as moany other domestics. Had a English feel which is fine by me. A very nice IPA and you can't go wrong here."
"An almost nitro-looking white head sits atop a hazy orange body. The nose has grapefruit, pine, apricot, and sweet caramel. There must be something English in this, because it's quite hoppy and bitter, but not it that puckering way that's common to Pacific Northwest brews. Sticky-sweet malts are upfront followed by the grapefruit, orange, apricot, tangerine, and pine hop flavors. It went great with the burger I ate."
"Poured a deep copper color with a thick two finger head. Good lacing. Tremendous hop aroma. Very citrusy. A hophead's dream. Maybe a bit too hoppy since it is difficult to pick up the malt. The 6.8 ABV does not hide itself. A strong hop bite at the finish. Good example of the Northwest IPA style. Maybe a bit unbalanced to enjoy as a session ale. I drank this for the first time after brewing my first IPA. The hops from the brew session were lingering so I enjoyed this immensely."
"First thing that struck me on the first drink, was the creamy mouthfeel. I didn't expect that. It's not a bad thing, just caught me off guard. The hops definately are the first thing to jump out here, but they are subdued and quickly tamed by the malt back. Solid IPA, and another great offering from Deschutes."
"Drinkability  This is a big-bodied IPA that will fill you up in a hurry. I really enjoyed the harmonious mix of flavors and the heavy, slick mouthfeel."
"I'll seek this one out again."
"An excellent IPA that comes out at the right time to give us celebration ale drinkers something to keep us out of trouble."
"Drinkability: The body gives this a good drinkability, the taste does nothing to detract from that. Drinkability is quite good."
"I would recommend highly for the IPA fan whio likes seasonal and rich beers."
"Big hops from this beer! Very high IBU's but remarkable well balanced with a nice malty undertone. Copper to Red in appearance. Nice creamy tan head that forms an easy 2 fingers in a standard pint glass. Dry hopped for 7 days and you can really tell with the fresh herb nose that is readily present as soon as you stick your nose in it. Finishes clean with a bit of a zip. ABV in the upper 6's and you can taste the alcohol as well. A great seasonal for Deschutes. Nice job."
"Mouth: Very strong lasting hop flavor from the entrance through the swallow. There's an interesting herb flavor in the front that makes me think of a farm, like alfalfa, and in the back that herbiness takes on some mint qualities. Mouthfeel is excellent!"
"Nice half-inch creamy top, color is dark cloudy copper with some floating sediment. Fine lace. MIld aroma of pine-like hops and sweet citrus present. Sweet and orange-like, the nose is moderately strong and very pleasant. The taste is not what you'd expect, virtually none of the citrus sweetness in the smell comes through in the flavor. Sharp and sour up front, the malt is subdued, and the hop freshness has dissipated some also. I get a nutty taste in the finish with some bitterness, but mostly a light sour flavor toward the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a slight smoothness, not bad. I might drink another one of these, but considering the wide selection of IPA's out there I definitely have better choices."
"Very nice IPA. Of what I have sampled, this is the best IPA from Deschutes."
"Dark orange with an off white fluffy head. Nice citric hop bite in the nose with some underlying sweet caramel malts. A bit of pine as well. Bitter citric and pine hops upfront before the malty backbone brings some balance to the flavor. Lingering slightly dry hoppy finish thats a touch fruity. I really liked the bitterness here that is sometimes missing from IPAs. Good mouthfeel with a thick enough body and smooth going down. Easy drinking and plenty hoppy enough to satisfy me I could have had a few."
"Bottom line: Another solid offering from Deschutes that I hope makes its way to Casper for further ""testing"". :^)"
"I have been drinking this beer for about two weeks now and I am finding that if I have a fresh hop craving this just hits the spot. I highly recommend this beer, especially if you can get a fresh sample."
"A beer that looks near perfect but is slightly flawed in the glass. I could see buying this again if it was cheaper than my usual Pale Ale but I can't see buying this instead of my usual local craft beer. Worth a try but not anything super special."
"Overall, a well done IPA. It's a bit unbalanced, but nice if you're in the mood for a hop-bomb."
"Notes: Hmmmm I'm not quite sure if this deserves elite status but for now its damn good and well above average. Deschutes has some really nice offerings once you get done sampling the lot."
"Amber / copper body with a thick creamy head, settles a bit after a few minutes but leaves a nice lace. Smells deeply sweet, caramel/bready with citrusy and earthy hops. Aroma is deliciously balanced. The sweetness comes through huge in the taste, though, along with a heavy, syrupy mouthfeel. Hop taste is a bit dirty and bitter, definitely sour grapefruity but not a lot else going on. A bit too sour and bitter to drink very many."
"Thanks to beernut7 for this one."
"I forget just how good beer from this brewery really is. A quick review of my reviews reminds me that this is my 11th Deschutes beer and that I've only given one of them less than a 4.0 for flavor. I'm not sure I can say that about too many other breweries. Inversion is a beer that I would be bringing home by the case if I was fortunate enough to have ready access."
"a damn nice beer, well, just like everything deschutes does. iVery balanced, and equal in it's hoppy and maltiness."
"Pours a slightly rusty orangish color with above average lace for an IPA, and some small chunks floating in suspension that I really hope are hop pieces. Smell is gorgeous, citrus/resin aroma noticible from a couple feet away, floral notes as I get closer, and a hint of sweet malt upon close investigation. Tangy citrus flavors are right up front, with even a clovish spice to it. I don't think I've ever wanted to describe an IPA as having a creamy flavor, but this seems to fit that bill. Mouthfeel is nice, I like an IPA to be a little thicker, but for a moderate 6.8% ABV beer it still qualifies as quite good. Drinkability? I'm on my second and I could go for at least 3 more. A session IPA? This is my first encounter with Inversion, but I think it may become one fo my benchmarks for a well balanced non-extreme American IPA. I'm thinking I may want to keep a couple of these around to introduce non-hopheads to the style."
"Nice inch thick head floats atop the orange crimson body. Very pleasing to look at. Decent bit of lacing but not enough to complete the perfect score. Nose is pine that shoots like an arrow to the nose, mingled with a weird boiled cornlike veggie smell. Taste is once again pine, unsweetened sap, and grapefruit mixed with caramel. The hops certainly get center stage here, with no attempt at balance. Mouth is dense and lush with sparse carbonation acting like a masseuse. This would be a nice IPA to session with."
"This is very very quaffable...a wonderful thirst quencher."
"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a blurred orange-brown with a stupendous frothy light tan head, a magnificent crown to the body, after is slow demise, the resultant lace forms a tight skirt upon the glass. Noticed some little fernies floating in the beer also, yum I love that stuff. Nose has a magnificent hop floral aroma citrus like in its crispness, sweet malt, and fresh and mouthwatering this nose, start is sweet at the front, the grain profile perfection, and the top middling in its feel. Finish has a pleasing acidity, the hops, wham, they snap your taste buds to attention, with the aftertaste long and lingering, a real treat this beer, from one of the worlds best breweries, and a long time top five brewery in my book."
"This bottle comes courtesy of Loren01... pours a rather dark, but bright amber with head that initially impresses but fades rather quickly. Smell is pretty standard for an IPA, but pleasing nonetheless. Lots of citrus and doughy malt notes in there. As for the taste, the initial citrus sweetness of the beer switches in a snap to heightened bitterness that's powerful yet restrained. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with light carbonation. This is what an IPA used to be, before all the hops arms race that's resulted in so many double IPAs out there. This beer is hoppy, it's malty, but it's not so extreme in either characteristic that it can't be enjoyed as a session beer."
"drinkability: This could be a hop-head session brew on a hot, sunny day. Exceptional in some areas, nothing terrible. A solid 6'er purchase for a friendly summer BBQ."
"Nice brew from a fantastic brewery. Even without the eclat of Deschutes, this brew would be tasted a winner!"
"Drinks good, but the OTT hoppiness would prevent this this eclectic IPA being a session ale"
"This is a very solid, very drinkable IPA. While hop henge still pleases my pallete more, this beer proves to be flavorful without pushing the alcohol levels up over the 8% range. A good job producing, and - at this point - leveling an IPA with a marketing plan at large groups of people."
"D- This is old school ""micro-brew"". You have to love this raw beast, it brings back so many memories of what some of the IPA were like back in the 1990's. Inversion IPA is a must try, especially if you love hoppy beers. Paired well with a pressed German Ham and Swiss pannini."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with good carbonation. The bitter hops at the end make you that much more ready for the malt at the beginning of the next sip. After one bottle, I'm feeling it a bit, and so I think two or three would do me for the night. Tasty though, and a nice treat after a hard day at work."
"Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with suspended particles that appear to be the residual of dry-hopping. The pretty, creamy half-inch tan head sticks around for a while. Assertive aroma of floral, piney hops reaches out and grabs you. Palate is more of the same - aggressive piney hops, with a hint of grapefruit and grass in the background. A very light caramel malt tempers the hops oh-so slightly. Body is substantial and just a tad sticky. Truthfully, the hops get to be a bit much after a while, but this is still a tasty IPA, and a considerable step up from its predecessor, Quail Springs."
"I found this a delectable IPA,. very very drinkable for 6.8% alc.. I think it tasted a lot like the wonderful Horseridge IPA i tasted last year at the Bond Street pub"
"Final thoughts - I love hops as much as anyone, but I found that the fruity bodies of the hops in this beer transitioned to mouth-puckering bitterness a bit too quickly. YMMV."
