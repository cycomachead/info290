"From bottle to snifter. Yields a finger of light beige sudsy head, with poor retention and lighter lacing walls. Pale and darker orange with some amber. Not overly aromatic, but peppery rye is present immediately, followed by spiciness. Tastes quite piney, with rye lingering for a while after sipping. Some citrus notes, and sweet malted backbone. Feels medium bodied, and slightly slick. Medium/low carbonation and well balanced. Very pleasant beer with a beautiful rye finish. I thoroughly enjoy all SN beers and this is no exception. Will buy again."
"Beautiful Amber color. Malty aroma and taste. Nice and citrusy too."

"Good, all around tasting beer."
""
"Very tasty rye IPA. The best part for me is the mouth feel if I leave it linger for a bit; the time in the mouth gives time for the rye fullness to be noticed."
""
"Nice blend of hops and rye."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with a large, cream colored head. It is amber in color and very murky. Small particles  are floating throughout the entire beer. Has slight spice aromas from the rye and citrus aromas from hops. Overall aroma is not too strong and is not very impressive. Initial taste is of a combination of grains and citrusy hops. Rye quickly follows and adds to the initial taste. After taste leaves a slight bitterness as IPAs usually do. Unlike most IPAs I have experienced, however, this one does not leave a dry finish in my mouth. Well done."

"Brown foamy head.reddish brown color.Very nice lacing.slightly bitter but good..Prost"
""
"Feel and drinkability are spot on. It's smooth and balanced with flavors that hit hard and last for more than a min on the tongue. No booze or overwhelming bitterness. Great for my palate."
""
"Overall, an excellent Rye IPA. Smooth, hoppy flavor without the bitterness – more floral and well balanced."
"O: It has the hit of rye up front, shortly after a heavy ale, and ends with a solid IPA KICK. A definite easy drinker for IPA fan, but enough IPA to keep us coming back when we want less than a IPA/dipa."
""
""
""
""
"O: My first RyePA. Not bad flavors, but very similar to a lot of their other beers. Drinkability is high, and I would definitely get again, especially if it was on tap."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 12/4/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, spicy rye, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, spicy rye, light caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness and rye spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, spicy rye, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent rye IPA style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate rye/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"I little disclaimer, I actually REALLY enjoy this beer but something about Rye beer in general doesn't agree with me so I avoid it at all costs.  Hence the reason I affectionately refer to this beer as ""Ruthless Flatulence""."
""
"The rye balances nicely with the hops.  The hops are strong but not bitterly so.  The rye adds a nice depth to the taste at the end so it isn't all hops all the way."
""
"O - Strong, bold IPA, spicy with rye, but not unpleasantly so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not bad. Definitely can taste the rye. Had as part of sample pack. Would not buy this separately."

"Pours in to a New Belgium tulip with a semi-transparent roasted orange color. The thin tan head lingers for a bit, then disappears with minimal retention and little appreciable lacing. The aroma is a balanced assortment of citrus, caramel sweetness and hints of dank earthy spice. The flavors follow suit, with a nice complex mix of delicious caramel, orange zest and peppery, earthy grain. The finish really highlights the inclusion of rye. Fairly balanced, with the bitterness held in check by the flavorful malts. The body of the beer is great. Juicy, moderate and satisfying, with a perfect level of carbonation. Very well done. Overall, the rye really adds some fantastic depth to the style. Carefully selected complimentary flavors and a keen sense of balance make this one a winner. Another score for Sierra Nevada. These guys really can't miss."

"Nose of roasted malts, caramel, Rye, faint earthiness, spice. Taste Rye, spice, resin, citrus, sweet malt."

"Overall: I can hardly wait for this beer to come out every year, one of my favorite SN beers. The sum of the parts really add up well to come tougher in a great beer."
""
"Overall:  A nice IPA that balances the rye very well.  Hopefully this doesn't go away forever after this year."
""
"This was a surprise, I enjoyed this beer very much."
""
""
""

""
""
"patriots suck!"
"Love this beer, the peppery kick from the Rye adds another dimension to the IPA style."
"Pours a dark red clay color with off white head.  Aroma is citrus, slight bread and a bit of sweetness.  Taste is citrus, with rye bread and a bit of spice from the rye.  Mouthfeel is medium but dry.  Overall not my favorite fron SN, I think  because the rye dries it out to much for me."
""

"bold good flavor with a ting from the rye"
""
""
""

"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer.  Would go great with food and is a wonderful sessioner (trust me!).  One of the best -if not the best--rye beer on the market.  If you are wondering what a rye is like, start here and work your way down."
""
""
""
"There is no strong bite at the beginning of the sip. The beer gently transitions into a smooth, soft feel with no real offensive tastes. It's just plain pleasant. Great beer! Not really what I would associate with IPA"
""
"O: Really solid beer and well worth finding in the 4 way ipa pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good. Tastes like a peppery Torpedo, although as someone else said, I think last year's ruthless Rye had a bit more flavor profile than this year. Seems a little watery.  Still no complains. Excellent."
""
"Deep amber-red,  you can smell the grains and rye. Earthy, rich and smooth all in one. Black pepper spiciness. Very delicious IPA"
"Medium light body, crisp and clean. Alcohol is fairly present for the finish."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is what SN does best. A deeply hoppy is a with bold citrus touches and a hit of rye bitterness. Delicious."

"I think this beer is fantastic and it is included in my top 3 beers.  All of the ingredients used meld together to make a super pleasing flavor.  The only reason I did not give this one a '5' is because it is not available 365 days a year."

"BOD 141/14.  Pours medium amber with a slight haze.  Normal head, lacing and retention.  Nice nose of caramel sweetness over citrus and pine notes with a touch of spice.  Light medium body, with a texture that borders upon creamy.  Normal carbonation level with light effervescence on the finish. Balanced flavor profile with a bit of complexity.  It begins with pine and citrus hop flavor which flows into caramel.  As the caramel sweetness fades, the rye asserts itself.  The finish is somewhat sharp with the rye and hop bitterness lingering.  A solid offering, but not in the league of GL's Rye of the Tiger or Founder's Red's Rye."
"Happy, Happy, Happy. This is another great beer from Sierra Nevada. Pours a nice off brown color with a good head. The taste is great with hops, pine and some citrus together. This beer has the right amount of sweetness to balance everything out properly. The finish is of bitter hops, but is very pleasant and definitely a go to beer. I like it !!"

"Can't fault it. Just a bit expensive compared to other US imported beers and hard to find."
""
"your hop fix, like their Celebration Ale."
""
"This pours a semi-cloudy brown color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is slightly bitter with hops. The taste is big and bold with rye and hops flavors. It is smooth and flavorful with a grainy, hoppy finish leaving a bitter aftertaste."
""
""
"12 fl oz bottle. Medium gold-copper colour with a tall, dense, off-white head which persisted well and left some nice lacing. Aroma of pine, floral perfume and citrus. A nice combination of: medium sweetness, complementary bitterness and a spicy bite to finish. Medium bodied with a creamy smooth texture. These jokers know how to make a beer. Thoroughly enjoyable."

"Bottle from the Vineyard to start off the weekend. Poured copper coloured with substantial off white head. Didn't really pay too much attention to the aroma as I was too keen to taste it. Great mouthfeel with a good balance of hop and malt. Nice head retention and lacing. Definitely should have bought more!"

"Pours a deep copper with a decent foamy off-white head that stays for a bit. Nice lacing. Aroma of pine resin, hay and grainy malt. The rye gives it an earthy taste with a bit of sweet spice. It also balances nicely with the hops. It's bitter, but not overly so. It does give a nice tingle to the tongue. Medium mouth without a lot of carbonation. Definitely a solid beer as you would expect from SN."

"O: A good IPA. I'll probably try more rye-based beers in the future. I'll probably try one with less hops, though, so I can get more of a rye-taste (the hops masked it somewhat)."
""
""
"O- I personally love this beer and have a hard time passing it up when it is available. The rye just adds a little peppery bite that I find irresistible. At 6.6% some would argue it isn't a sessionable brew but I firmly disagree. An Oakland A's game and a Ruthless Rye or 6 is a great evening."

"O: One of those ""have to be in the mood for it"" beers. It is a beer I enjoy on colder, poor weather days where the spice and alcohol warmth acts as a pick me up, without knocking me out. Each time I have this beer it tends to be a one and done, not to be paired with other beers and definitely not to be sessioned. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys experimental IPAs, but would not go out of my way for."

"Well, I think they got the Ruthless Part right; the hops and the malt duke it out and implode with an ashen sort of bite, that keeps on biting on the backside of the taste. Had to try it, but won't try it again. I prefer an ipa with a very clean hoppy citrus taste, and all the tastes here are so mashed together, they get lost."
"O - An ok beer. Not hoppy enough really for an IPA in my opinoin at least. More malts are present than hops. Still very drinkable."
""
""
"I enjoyed this alot more on tap, had a 6pack of 2013 bottle version last year. Great lacing, as Im lookin at empty pint glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep ruddy amber with a big creamy white head. The head has great retention and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is lackluster, with some slight earthy hops and a little hint of the rye. The taste is a little bit better, mirroring and amplifying the aromas components. The mouthfeel is nice, a little heavier and mostly smooth with just a hint of bite from the hops as it finishes. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't go for it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer, one that I would love to find at a bar and order."
""
""
""
"O - This is yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. As easy as it is to overlook these guys and pass them off as old hat, they still know how to innovate and have plenty of surprises up their sleeves. This is my first rye and I like what I'm drinking so far. The combination of rye malt and hops is quite nice. Love the artwork."
""
""
""
""
"This offering pours a slightly used copper penny brown, with a prodigious off white head that has some serious staying power. The smell is bready, spicy and with a medium piney hops presence. The taste is a tangy mix of the rye and the hops with a solid malt backbone. It has a medium to robust mouthfeel. Overall a very good Rye IPA from the good folks at Sierra Nevada. If I'm not quite blown away, I am happily satisfied."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm a pretty big fan of the Rye IPA and this was a wonderful example of the style. I was most impressed by the aroma and mouthfeel but, as a whole, it was an awesome beer!"
""
""
"O - I was expecting more sharpness due to the rye but it was balanced out perfectly resulting in just a great IPA. At under 8 bucks a six pack at my Walmart this is a ""best buy"" for sure that I will be stocking up on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"the list is bold but basically this beer is so great only Kal-El would drink it. Where Kal-El is from is another story like the story of rye being infused into the malt of this singing brewed IPA, the Winston racer at the finish line, is that Messi with his fly eyes? I mean, this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's easy to take Sierra Nevada for granted in favor of the latest and greatest, but they just keep making excellent beers."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, just forgettable."
""
""
""
""
"This is not a session beer, but a work of art. To me, it evoked memories of a late summer's day spent outdoors, helping in the fields."
""
""
"The beer is well balanced with a good amount of American hops with a light pepper spice."
""
""
"not getting much smell but my sniffer is a little locked up with the pre-spring heat we're having today. but there definitely isn't much on the nose. taste is peppery and rye-like, indeed. an edgy bitterness and slightly dry. some citrus but I like the rye in this one compared to other rye brews. no carbonation to speak of and medium feel to it. very nice. probably one of my more favorite sierra Nevada offerings...."
""
""
""
"Overall- I like this a lot. It's very reminiscent of warm nights outside with friends, and makes me look forward to the transition into springtime. The pepperiness was the ultimate winning factor here though. It was the perfect amount, and makes the brew rememberable. Good job, Sierra Nevada, you don't disappoint."

"IPA? Not Really? RyePA -Yes. Not my favorite Sierra Nevada entry but if your a fan of putting rye in beer??? Then you will love this with pastrami. What is your next spice Sierra? coriander? Stick with what you do best - seasonal entries. Not sure I would buy this one. If you are into rye this is your guy."
""
""
"O- so far, Sierra Nevada hasn't let me down. This is definitely a very great brew. I would have no problems buying a six pack or suggesting this to friends and family."
"Sharp spicy bitterness starts and then develops into piney citrus hops with a bitter backbone. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been trying quite a few IPA's lately and although many of them are seriously great beers, I know I can always count on Sierra Nevada to give me what I am looking for. I am a huge Torpedo fan and I must say that I find the Ruthless Rye to be right up there with it and could definitely drink gallon after gallon of this stuff and be quite content, without the need to look elsewhere. Now, in my book, that is an excellent beer !!"
""
"O: When this comes to town, better believe I'll grab a 6'er. So good, I love rye anything and this does not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing Rye IPA! The color, smell, look...all say drink me. And then you do, greatness. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Perfect head that last most way throughout drinking, along with nice white bubble lacing. Great beer all around. Cheers! Side note, an odd but amazing food pairing is a nice cinnamon roll!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pleasant rye IPA, easy drinking"
""
"--- Smell develops really nicely, taste is smooth, with complex rye spiciness, I took awhile to warm to this, the acidity initially is quite dominant, but it really lives up to the typical SN complexity, balance and depth. A lot of thought went into this and it shows well. Worth trying out, good showcase of the rye malt here. Refreshing as well as intriguing, one of the better rye beers i can remember having. Tart and spicy on the nose, flavourful and balanced body with a strong malt base, again more spicy than bitter, with a good finish to tie it together."
""
""
""
""
"After having this beer in a bar, I bought a six pack and have been enjoying it at home. The smell is a bit coppery, but the beer itself tastes great--a hoppy, balanced, bread-like taste that is easy to drink and truly enjoyable. It's not the best beer that I've ever had--by far--but it is a solid beer that I'd seek out and have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy copper with thick lacy head this beer looks great. There's a faint smell of fresh baked bread on the nose so what's not to like there? Full bodied taste for the style there is just enough nuance to keep things interesting. The tug of war between malt / rye ""breadiness"" and hops is a draw. There is a bit of an aftertaste, but it's not unpleasant. This is an easy drinker and I could go for a couple more. Mouthfeel is spot on....creamy and rich. I picked this up as a single in a ""build your own six pack"" store and I'm wishing I would have grabbed a full 6 of these. Another good one from SN....not great, but VERY solid!"

"If someone were to make a high gravity bitter, only with rye, this is sort of how I would imagine it. The hop aromas and higher ABV give it a nice edge. I would buy this again."

"Overall, I found this to be a welcomed change to the beer aisle and a beer with plenty of complexity and balance. I love the use of rye malt and wouldn't hesitate to make a session of this."

"This IPA is a nice dark gold color with reddish brown hues, plenty of carbonation in its body and a light fluffy head accompanied by some thick lacing. The aroma is a bit light, but the hops do come through along with some grains and grassy smells. There are hints of grapefruit too. The bitterness hits your first and then mellows out into a nice semi sweet flavor, the hops a re well represented but not overpowering. The aftertaste is spot on for an IPA, the alcohol is present but not offensive. Over all I thought this a really good IPA."
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoy the malt-hop balance in this brew. The malt is sweet, but provides a nice spice from the rye and moderated well by citrus hop flavor. A very enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is dark copper with a lot of light tan tight head. Nose is mild, pine hops, light spice, dirty wheat and some bread crust. Taste is less bready, still mild pine hop with a light spice, touch of bread through the back on a smooth light body, decent carb and light abrupt bitterness in the finish."

"Not very bitter except at finish and even then it's slight. Citrus hint at first sip and then sweetens to a bread-like malty flavor with a little rye. Not bad and easy to drink. I would prefer more rye flavor but the low bitterness somewhat allows more flavors to be noticed. Recommended."

The aroma on this beer is nice and hoppy with the spicyness of the rye coming through. The rye gives a very unique malt backbone to this beer. It's great, as a IPA lover I am really enjoying this. Pick some up if you get a chance."

"O- I really like what this beer is trying to do. Too many IPAs these days are trying to appeal to the mass consumer, with their fruity/citrusy/floral overtones (don't get me wrong, I love me some ApriHop on occasion), but sometimes I want my IPA to feel like an IPA, one that goes well with a cigar, and puts some hair on your chest. And that's what this beer does."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured a rich amber with a large head that left a thick lace along the glass. The smell is very faint and hoppy. The flavor is bitter and dry throughout the rye provides a bitter starch(and peppery) taste that lingers. The hops are not very fruity or floral but dry and bitter and complement the rye nicely. Overall the beer came together very nicely and has a more pronounced rye presence than I've seen in the brews of some others breweries starting to use rye."

"Pretty darn hoppy with a nice rye bite to it. If you like west coast style IPA's(very prevalent hop flavors) you'll enjoy this brew. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but leaves the palate with a nice rye taste, real crisp. Enjoyed this brew with some spicy shrimp and veggies and it tasted great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance has a clear reddish brown color supporting a steady healthy head leaving nice lace. Smell of citric, malt and spicey hint of rye. Taste has a nice hit of the hops balanced with the sweetness of the malt and hint of rye. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Overall a nice twist on a IPA."
""
""
"O: A really nice and refreshing rye IPA that goes down maybe a bit too easily. If you like AIPA's or pale ales I would definitely recommend you try this."
""
"O-Overall, this is a nice beer by SN, not the best rye ipa out there but is good. Had hop rod rye just before this one and enjoyed it more."
"UPDATE !/21/14: Had the second bottle with dinner tonight and afterwards as I was finishing it was struck by the peppery spice flavor from the rye, which was more pronounced than on any other rye beer I have had yet. Definitely will buy a twelvepack next time I see it, which hopefully will be tomorrow. Already made room for it in the basement beer storage shelves."

"Overall- Love rye IPAs and I feel this could use some more hop presence to really bring it home. Look forward to this one every year and It doesn't blow you away but really hits all the marks to be solid and worth a 6 pack at least."

""
""

""
"Let's start by saying ""I love rye ipas"" and this is no exception. This pours a beautiful deep red color with a finger and a half of tan head that lasts throughout the drinking of the ale. The aroma is slightly hoppy but mostly strong with rye and malt. It Sips smooth and gloriously bitter but very dry. Possibly too dry for some. The flavor is earthy and heavy on the rye. Hops are present but not super forward. The finish is hoppier with pine and citrus present but still with a healthy amount of rye and malt underneath. Overall this is an excellent rye ipa and at a phenomenal cost. Pick one up while it's available. I'll look forward to trying again next year."
""
""
"I found this to be a nice change up from the standard Sierra IPA which is one of my go to beers. Beautiful color, medium head. Spicy on the tongue. This one of those beers that is very tasty, yet wouldn't drink more than a couple in a sitting. Still a great value beer at 14.99 for a 12 pack"
""
"If you want flavor and richness without the high alcohol and without a high price tag, check this out. One of my go-to beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After drinking a DIPA, I found this to be actually more intense, overwhelming, alcoholic, and difficult to drink. The beer pours a copper color with a medium head and pretty good retention. The smell is peppery, alcoholic, and spicy. The taste is also spicy (from the rye) with a solid malt backing but not a whole lot of the IPA flavors that I enjoy. The pepper from the rye seems to crush everything else. The thickness and carbonation are fine, but the rye creates an unpleasant aftertaste. Overall, I'm fairly new to rye beers and I understand that some of my complaints about this beer are simply a result of the rye, but perhaps there should be somewhat less of it. I really enjoyed Founder's Red Rye, but the taste here just didn't do it for me. By far this is the worst Sierra Nevada beer I've had."

"Smoothest IPA I've had, only because its a Rye . Its the second time I've bought it. Good introductory beer for someone looking to drink more than 4 beers. IPA's usually give you a not so pleasant after taste, but this one won't... Serve in a Tulip glass... Cheers!!!"
""
""
"I'm a fan. Sierra Nevada has another great beer with this. I'll drink plenty in the next few months."
"So this was another first for me . The beer poured a copper color with a finger width head. The smell is a nice balance of malt and hops. The rye really shines through in the taste and the flavor overall was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a reddish copper with great head and lace on top of an aroma that first strikes me as strong, piney, citric, the rye really comes out as well. Full bodied and well-balanced and just really struck a positive chord with me. The rye and some heavy, breadlike malts give beer a spicy edge and keep the abundant pine/citric hop notes from taking over my tastebuds but leave enough so I know I'm drinking a strong IPA. There is this touch of sweetness I seem to get at times as well that makes the beer more interesting. Has a great finish that is crisp and dry and I really took a shine to this Sierra Nevada offering."

"The Ruthless Rye IPA poured a deep copper with the typical Sierra Nevada overly effervescent head. The nose was spicier than a typical IPA with less of the citrus and pine hop and more of the rye spice. The taste was a peppery hops with the hoppy bitterness balanced by the spicy rye and some caramel to boot. The Ruthless Rye had a thin and spicy front that left a herbal bitter coating on my palate. While maybe not as complex as some rye IPA’s it is still a tasty tippable brew that was highly satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark, amber and cloudy. Thick foamy heady with superb lacing on side of glass. Strong piney/apple smell. Hints of citrus. Smooth malty taste. Bitterness hits you right away. Bitterness just gets stronger with the rye taste coming out at the end. The bitter aftertaste persists for a long time. Hopheads will like it just for the bitter aspect. Malty rye predominates the taste.  Very slight fruitiness at the with a smoother caramel like taste.  More impressed with this beer than last year.  I may have gotten a fresher batch this year, though."

"Shared a taster on-tap as part of four flights at the brewery; Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, Chico, USA. Then ordered a half pint later. Yum! As part of a six-week West Coast beer tour. I rate to taste, not to style. See my blog for more details: carbeers.wordpress.com"
""
"Mouthfeel & Overall: well-attenuated, dry-ish on the palate, the fizziness is not as sharp in the mouth as it appears in the eyes, medium-bodied, with an usual warming kick for the alc. level, and very very satisfying at the end of each sip; this American IPA, brewed using rye and whole cone hops on top of quality malts, has indeed an ""usual"" (which I can't explain, maybe just for the sake of saying something...!!) element to it, but not quite in the way as I expected really. Interestingly, the citrusy-peppery hop quality, the juicy crystal malts, and the well-tuned attenuation altogether give me an impression of a stronger type of Kentish Pale Ale brewed with Kentish citrusy hops and spicy Styrian Goldings even! This has to be my very first rye-related beer, and I’d say, well done!"
""
""
""
""
"Bitter and tropical fruit laced beer although it's definitely not a classic from Sierra Nevada.It is still a nice beer, just not their best offering."
"The body is dark copper, the head is pillowy and lively. The smell is all i should be, rye and hops. The rye lends a strong peppery punch, and really is the backbone of this beer. The hops lend a fruit, floral aspect that really play fantastically off the rye. I enjoy everything about this beer, I am sad it is a seasonal. This is probably my new favorite of the rye beers that have come to market lately."
"Pours clear and copper with a half finger head that fell off to to a thin skin on top. Some lacing. Nose is mellow but distinct with rye and while the malt is light on the nose they seem to be put together well. Some floral hops come up lightly like straw. As it warmed there was a little honey quality to the hops. Taste is delectable. Grainy malt, spicy rye, some grapefruit, and piney hops. Everything in balance with a creamy, smooth, sticky, piney, bitter hop finish. This was a substantial rye IPA , easy to drink and a vigorous tonic at that!"

"O: Torn between a 4 and 3.75 here. I feel like the total here is well balanced and more than a sum of its individual metrics, so I'm going with the 4. A pretty good beer, and one I think I'd enjoy a bit more with a bit more hoppiness. I'm not sure if the problem is age or if it's the beer, but I'm going to assume it's my fault/age. Still very drinkable, well balanced, and flavorful."

"Citrus hops and rye dominate the smell, and in taste are joined by barely enough caramel malt to give body and balance. The flavors I want and love in a rye pale are a little flat and flimsy, especially considering the lighter mouthfeel, but in terms of a balanced IPA this is as well done as any. The spicy taste of rye is apparent but I usually want more body to back it. The finish is clean and lightly bitter."
""
""
""
"I'd recommend for being a good beer, but not particularly impressive on any front."
""
"This beer always gives me the knarliest farts. They fucking stink too. The beer's good, and the 6.6% always leaves my liver working hard to make me sober enough to work the next morning. I like the fact that I can drink a bunch of it, fart enough to make my domain a gas chamber, then wake up and walk out of the room without noticing the deadly smell that the beer gave me. It leaves a chalky hungover taste in your mouth after you drink 10 and wake up without brushing your teeth, but that's the life of a true alcoholic. An alcoholic's beer if the ABV were a touch higher and the farts were a bit stinkier."
""

"Pours a light copper color. Moderate off-white head with good retention and moderate lacing. Medium rye and herbal hops in the aroma. Flavor is mild caramel malt, grassy and piney hops and a moderate dose of rye. The spiciness of the rye and bitterness of the hops predominate--I would have liked a bit more malt for some sweetness and balance. This is a beer that couldn't really decide what it wants to be--it needs more hops and rye to be a really aggressive rye IPA. Or it needs more caramel sweetness to be a more ""mainstream"" beer. Instead, they split the difference and the result, while good, is not as good as it could have been."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows the nose, too my slight dissapointment. Getting a good deal of great rye flavors, but missing the hops/citrus expected from a SN IPA. There is a bit of a citrus/resinous finish however. Mouthfeel is just a bit lighter than heavy, with medium/high carbonation, just the right amount of chewiness. In my opinion a very good beer, but not as much flavor as hoped on the IPA side of things."

"O: A really nice beer from SN (again). While it isn't a beer of the year candidate, it is very good and has plenty of complexity and subtlety built into the the hopping to keep it interesting. SN is masterful at providing a balanced yet interesting brew. This fits that bill very well."

"Poured this American IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear copper color, produced a very nice off white head, great retention and it left a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of spicy rye and piney hops. Medium in body, the foundation of this ale consisted of spicy rye and a decent amount of earthy hops. Overall the balance is a bit off, more spicy rye then bitter hops but a decent example of the style."
""

"Overall Drinkability: Not my favoriate rye, nor my favorite Sierra Nevada."

"Pours a golden/dark orange color with a frothy white head. Leaves a ton of lacing. Smells of citrus, a lot of lemon in there, and grain. Mouthfeel is similar, but the rye is very pronounced. A bit of spiciness in the finish. Overall, a pretty good IPA, but not even near the best out there."
""
""

"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a brownish orange colour. (Tasting notes aside, this has a really striking label.) The nose is an interesting mix of bright citrus fruits like tangerine and lemon and grain. The rye really comes through on the palate. There's a strong dark rye bread flavour with some citrus notes and a spicy,hoppy finish. Good carbonation."

The potency of the hops flavor is a tamer than some other IPAs, more citrusy, but still very good. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall: a good, not so complex IPA that would be a great option for someone getting their taste buds acquainted with hops forward brews at the next step up from a strong amber ale."

"O: when i saw this beer, i knew i would have to compare it with founders red's rye pa. while not as bold or original, this beer is completely satisfying and refreshing. the substitution of rye for predominant hops separates this beer from any other sierra nevada beer i've had."

"Poured a beautiful amber with a one finger off white head that receded quickly but left behind lacing down the glass. Scents of northwest coast hops and spicy rye. Flavor is pronounced northwest coast hops, rye spice, slight grapefruit and excellent pine notes. Mouthfeel is of medium thickness with medium carbonation that makes it easy to drink. It's a good IPA not the best of Sierra Nevada's many different seasonal IPA offerings, or even their year round, but it's a very good rye IPA."

"Ruthless Rye IPA is different than the typical IPA. It still has the all of the alcohol percentage and IBUs of a regular IPA but it finishes extremely dry, in a good way. Many people I've shared this beer with feel that it exudes a strong hint of Marijuana. Marijuana is the cousin of the hop so it is not that crazy of a description."

"The Verdict: Good stuff. It’s far from Sierra Nevada’s best, but it’s still better than the average rye brew. Smooth and complex, it’s hard to complain about, but rye IPAs aren’t for everyone."

"O- More of a rye pale ale to me than an IPA, but that's no knock on this beer, I like it a lot. The malts and rye and pepper flavors trump the 55 ibus to my taste, the abv is also just right for drinkability."
""
"This is an incredible beer. It has a unique flavor profile. It hits you hard with the hops and the rye. It finishes with a really nice dry aftertaste. It's a beer that you enjoy for a minute when you're done drinking. It is one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But Ruthless was definitely strong and flavorful, with perhaps more of a citrus hop punch, and a kick like Lagunitas' Hop Czar. Peppery, medium-bodied, a little chewy on the palate. It actually seemed a bit stronger than the abv shown here. Plenty to savor through an evening, with much more character than an ordinary Pilsner. Just not the sweetness or maltiness I detected in the other brand."
"*-Overall this is a very good IPA. Is it anywhere near my favorite, no. To me, this would work better as a fall IPA, not spring. I'd like something lighter in body and not quite as hop forward. I don't think this beer has a good malt-hop balance. But still, nice beer overall."
""
"Appearance is a somewhat cloudy copper with a hazy straw hue on the edges. There was a relatively thin layer of head that did not retain well, but left nice lacing anyway. I really didn't get rye notes in the nose; rather, mild hops come across. The spice of the rye really comes out front in the flavor profile. Dry bitterness provides a very enjoyable finish."

"O: Beautiful spicy rye IPA that is true to west coast traditions but nicely balanced as well."

"Plus, you gotta dig that label art."

""
"The final verdict is that this beer is incredible. I feel that Sierra Nevada makes really great beers that are accessible enough for novice beer drinkers, yet will please basically anyone that enjoys an amazing beer. Defiantly check this out if you haven't yet."
""
""
"Overall: I have had one other rye/IPA and I must tell you that that one was much better balanced. This seems to be an IPA ONLY with very little to no rye. Good beer however and I would buy it again but not often. If I want an IPA I would buy one! I wanted that balance with the rye."

"Ruthless Rye is decidedly flavorful and interesting, but the rye gets rapidly tiring. I've previously had it on a few occasions, and I've never been convinced that buying a sixer is a good idea. I'm finally reviewing it because I found a single. And while I do like this beer, I'm not in a rush to have another."
""
"O - Seems like I can't find a SN brew that I don't love. Well done. Easy drinking RyePA that blends similar hop profile and drinkability that the standard SN Pale ale with a bit of a twist. A definite try."
"Poured with 2 fingers of big foamy head full of tiny bubbles. Reddish brown color like a worn out copper pipe mixed with red licorice and lots of tight lacing. The smell was full of citrus and resin and a little bit of sweet fruit on the back end. It smelled a lot like a bowl of hops resting in water; very fresh. The taste was not as sweet; very spicy like a rye beer, but the sweet malt sits there in the front with that spicy rye flavor on top. It was very tasty and had a nice bittering hop flavor. The hops flavor was backseat by far though. it was pretty fizzy overall with a pretty full mouthfeel, approaching the oiliness of a big IPA. Overall, this beer is pretty awesome overall. Well balanced between a classic IPA and a rye beer."

"This is a must try beer if you have not done so."

"Final Thoughts: Ruthless Rye IPA would make a great aperitif. It really wakes up the taste buds and does a good job of providing a flavor that is as-advertised. Fans of rye beers should check this one out. Would I drink it again? Yes, but I would not seek it out."
""
"O: One of those beers that's greater than the sum of its parts. Stylistically, Sierra Nevada absolutely nailed this one. From the killer bottle art all the way to the rough, unpolished taste profile, Sierra Nevada did an excellent job in highlighting the rustic aspect of this oft derailed grain. Cheers to them."

"Dark amber to copper color with a moderate white head and moderate lacing. Scents are grapefruit with some mild malt in the background. Taste is a nice balance of sharp pine with sweet malt, with a touch of spicy rye and pepper. Nothing spectacular, just a tasty and all-around good beer."

"Pours a clear reddish amber with a huge light tan head that sticks to the glass impressively. Aromas of fresh pine cones, and a hint of pepper. Taste begins with some tart grain, followed by a smooth hint of vanilla, then some fresh bread. After that is a smooth resinous pinecone flavor that washes over. A quite clean finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall an excellent IPA. Not especially bitter, but with plenty of hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 - 12oz bottle, pours light copper and is topped with a fluffy, ivory head that holds excellent retention & leaves chunky lacing down the glass. Aromas are earthy rye coupled with citric, grapefruity hops, and mild pine. It smells a bit light struck, as did the previous three from this 6-pack, but I've had this before and I'll just ignore it as artifact so to speak. Tastes are spicy rye, earth, biscuit, dank resious, grapefruity hop, pine; astringent on the finish. Thinner body, moderate carbonation, oily hop resins stick and linger on the palate while finishing dry. Overall, very good, but I remember enjoying it more last year."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Extremely tasty brew that any hop head will love! I really like the spice character the rye imparts on this IPA. Excellent!! Classified as an American IPA at 6.6%. Consumed 2-16-13."
""
""
"O- A really nice RyePA with tons of that spicy rye character and nice floral hop character."
"I am re-reviewing this because it has grown on me. So much so that this is now one of my favorite beers, and a go to for me whenever I have pizza. It is simple, straightforward, not overly complex, refreshing, but not lacking in flavor. Very drinkable and like I said, it is amazing with pizza. The color is simply gorgeous, a deep reddish amber, but perfectly transparent. Thick head and sticky lacing top it off. Some very fine particles of sediment can be seen suspended in the brew, likely the rye. Smell is mostly of the resinous hops, but has more bread and grain and less citrus and fruit than most IPAs. Taste is fairly standard for an IPA up front leaving behind some bread and malt on the back of the palate along with some mild rye flavor. Not tons of rye, but enough to keep you interested. Great beer, easy to find, and the price is right."
""
"O-One of the better IPA's I've had. It is not too abrasive, which seems to be the problem with most IPA's in my opinion. This one is very subtle and forgiving and has no notes that kick you in the teeth."

"This was an ""OK"" beer from the Titan out west which didn't really surprise me. I found this beer to be very mild with taste and the Rye really doesn't shine through on this beer at all. IT was not a bad beer but it was not memorable either, the beer is worth giving a try though. They could have hopped this beer out a tad more and they should have added more rye especially since the Title of the beer states this beer is all about rye...???"

"Smells of resin and some citrus. A little zest as well. Body is a clear ruby bronze, thick fluffy white cloud like head. Sustains well. Just the right amount of malt sweetness. Clean bitterness with a touch of citrus making for a fresh taste. Body is well carbonated and velvety. Good overall IPA. Not a hop showoff by any means, just a well done enjoyable offering."

"I'm a big fan of Sierra Nevada and haven't tasted one I wouldn't buy again. I don't taste much of the pepper they describe in this one or know why this would be considered a ""transition to Spring"" as it says on the bottle. It tastes similar to their normal IPA, but with a little less flavor. Still a great beer (great head, color, smell), but wouldn't put it in front of their other IPAs because it doesn't have the same level of taste."
"overall i like it and will seek it out again next year"
""
""
"O: I don't care for the taste of this beer. The hop flavors are one dimentional and very pine resin laden. There is no substantial malt middle quallity to support this hop flavor, leaving the beer an unbalanced mess. No element of citrus flavors. The bottle has no date, so I don't know if it is just old or truly bad. There is a heavy element of spicy black pepper on the aftertaste that doesn't match well with the hop flavors presented. I've had much better rye based IPAs."

"Great amber color and beautiful floral hoppy nose. Spicy blend of hops well balanced and full bodied. Great lingering finish and clean.

"O – This is a tasty beer. Nothing really sticks out in particular that sets this apart from the pack, but it’s a great example of the style. Actually if I had to pick a thing that could set it apart, it would be the great balance between the malt and hops in both the aroma and the taste. This is a tasty and very drinkable beer, and I think Sierra Nevada picks the perfect time of year to release a beer like this. The little bit of spice from the rye is reminiscent of some holiday beers, but its grainy nature mixed with the nice hop bouquet has me feeling like spring is coming. Another nice beer from Sierra Nevada."

"Overall, this is a very nice rye IPA, and for the low ABV, it’s surprising how much flavor is in here. The notes are very nicely balanced, and the beer as a whole is surprisingly tasty and smooth, even over the course of several mouthfuls. The hops are especially nice, being full and rounded and heavy in oils, which helps boost the mouthfeel. Worth trying."

"pours a dark copper color with about a two finger tightly formed head and good amount of sticky lace. you can smell the hops there and there is a nice freshness to it. medium mouth feel and a crispy carbonation. strong hop taste some citric and spice notes but its all about the balance there are some bready and sweet notes also. i'm not a big hop head fan but enjoyed this beer a lot and would buy again."

"This beer pours up an amazing crystal clear deep copper with a nice light tan head about one finger in height, decent retention, and large amounts of delicate and elaborate lacing left on the side of the glass. The smell is very bready and earthy, with a little hint of spiciness. Taste is very satisfying with an initial citrus fruitness follwed by a soicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is neither thick nor thin, but nice and satisfying. If Sierra Nevada makes a bad beer I've yet to have one."

"O: Drinkable and delicious Rye IPA."
"Overall a good rye ale. It has similarities to other Sierra Nevada beers, probably due to the yeast. They're all well made ales and this no exception."
"Overall (4.0): This is a very solid, hop-forward rye beer. It’s got a ton of flavor, and the rye malt offers a different dimension that might hook non-craft drinkers but also adds some nice variety to what most hopheads are probably accustomed to. It’s not the best rye beer I’ve had but it’s a very solid contender, and I’d recommend this to lots of folks. Keep up the good work Sierra Nevada, you guys are really killing it these days (see my reviews for Hoptimum, Narwhal, Torpedo, etc.)."

""
"Overall: I like it; not having had many rye IPAs, not sure how this stacks up, but it is flavorful and pleasant."
""
"The beer appeared a nice, clear darkish orange with a huge off white, dense head, which settled into a rocky head that hung around for a long time. Some nice lacing. The beer gave off a good aroma, mainly with a very strong pine hop aroma with the rye in the background. There also appeared to be a hint of spice as well. The taste of the beer was more balanced than I thought it would be. A nice bready and rye with a slightly more dominate pine and citrus hop taste. The beer had a moderate feel to it, it was clean, creamy, and it left a nice dry and refreshing finish. Overall, another quality beer from this quality brewer."

"O: seems to have gotten some middling reviews, but I felt that the goal here was to brew a rye IPA, and I don't see any fail points - you can clearly and cleanly taste the rye grain and all its flavors, while the bittering piney hops of an IPA also present themselves well - I'd call it a win, and i hope my review reflects that..."

"This beer didn't disappoint, it poured a deep copper color with a very rich frothy head, long lasting lace clung for the entire 12 oz. serving.Smell of fresh grass, bread and citrus. Nice alchohol viscosity. Super malted, hoppy flavour with a hint of the rye. This I will try again."

"Overall: A very sessionable brew…it’s got nice peppery flavor that’s complimented perfectly by pale malts and cereal grains…I was surprised to see that the citrus flavor involved here comes from citra hops, which seems to be infecting every new or seasonal beer coming out right now…no sign of the 6.6% ABV, a credit to the brew’s dynamic flavor…this beer has grown on me since I opened it and I’m glad I have another in the fridge…I found the flavor to be more abundant and peppery as it warms…yum! (4/5)"

"It pours a slighlty hazy copper with a light tan head. Head retention is excellent and the lacing is very nice after the head flattens out a bit. It smells grainy and spicy with strong notes of pine and citrus. The taste is citrusy, piney and bitter. The finish is bitter with some nice peppery spice from the rye. It has a nice crisp clean mouthfeel with a bit too much carbonation for my liking. Highly recommended."
""

"Pours off copper in color with an inch head that has nice lacing. Pine smell with some spice. Hops up front that are pine and some citrus some bitterness.

"12oz bottle, not sure why I did not review this last year. Amber orange color, good head which is typical of Sierra Nevada beers, good lace. Smells slightly grainy with hints of citrus. More citrus in the flavor and the rye is distinct. Overall the flavors are solid yet subtle. This isn't a punch you in the face IPA. Not whole lot of bitterness, leans much more towards citrus with the hops. A solid beer but for my money I'd rather have Celebration."

"O: I enjoy this beer as a winter wonderland to temporarily replace Torpedo Extra IPA. The rye is fresh and clean, delivering a dry finish and leaves you wanting more...which is exactly what you can do when you finish the beer and its a mistake if you don't get another. Rivals Rich and Dans Rye IPA for me (had it fresh at the brewery) but doesnt quite live up to Hop Rod."

"I really like this beer and will drink quite alot of this over the next few months"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy light amber with a nice large foamy head. Smells of piney hops primarily, very inviting.

"I had the opportunity to try this beer on tap at Catch 22 in Merrillville, IN. Sierra Nevada definitely surprised me with this one. This beer gives good head and it has an ""in your face""-smooth flavor with a small craft feel. Keep it up Sierra Nevada!"

"Taste is spicy dried fruit & fruit candy up front, deep earthy bread character, lightly leaning to spicy-earthy bitterness with hint of citrus at finish. Light mineral throughout, but a bit too spicy-bitter, esp. in finish and with food, with a fusel alcoholic quality, all making it a bit rough and harsh despite some good elements."

"O: Overall a rye that delivers a strong and pronounced peppery punch, but the other rye aspects seem to be masked by the strong peppery nature and solvent like alcohol tones. Abv% feels a bit higher with a spicy dry drinkability that no doubt will limit this in numbers. 1-2 is fine with me."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark intimidating appearance, decent head, and slight lacing. Nose is mossy and piny, but very full. Flavor is basic, but very well done... thick, hearty, and biting. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"Hazy copper colour, one finger of off white head, lots of lace left behind here. Smell is spicy and hoppy, lots of pineapple and grapefruit, tropical fruits, nice malt in there as well and a little more of the rye spiciness. Taste is malty and spicy initially, rey fairly prominent, lightly sweet, floral hop and pine, some juicy citrus, pineapple with more rye in the finish. Medium carbonation and body, good feel. Really nicely done, even at past its prime this held up an enormous amount of hops and a really good flavour."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew is the awesome rye inclusions. These complement and mix beautifully with the earthy, piney, citric hop bouquet. While this is such a fantastically balanced beers, and the flavors so robust, it might be hard to drink more than one or two of these back to back, as it is easy to see how it could become overwhelming. This is a fantastic beer, and not to mention, it has one of the coolest labels we’ve seen in a long time."

"Seriously a good beer. It's not quite characteristic of a classic IPA, but that's ok. The bitterness from the hops does kick in at the end along with the alcohol, which does remind you that you're drinking an IPA. It's much more malty and the rhy really comes out in the smell and the taste. The smell is strong. Toasted rhy bread, with some grassy crispness. If you want a serious IPA don't go for this, but if you're looking for something a little unique, this has it."
"I employed an aggro pour so as to release the aromatics and at the same time, create so much tawny head that there was a cascading action at the junction between the foam and the liquid. My strategy was sound as I ended up with just better than two fingers of head that resembled the top of an ice cream cone, plus the kitchen smelled like I had sprayed air freshener. It smelled of pine, mint and black pepper and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium and the admixture of the rye and hops on the tongue was literally breathtaking. It tasted of pepper and fresh mint and was just beautiful! The heavy, sticky lacing that began to appear was going to need a hammer and chisel to remove. Finish was likewise dry and peppery-minty. Whew. What a way to open the day!"
"Another classic from Sierra Nevada. It's easy to drink, it's got decent alcohol, it's not very expensive. There's nothing not to like."

"Amber pour, fine bubbles, good lacing. Great smell, apricot, leather, a little almond, perhaps tangerine. Taste is very smooth, thick, tastes of fresh bread, almond, and only a hint of apricot despite the scent. I could easily knock back a few of these. Definitely an excellent value for the cash."

"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of medium spicy rye malt notes with some bitter and light citrusy hoppy notes. Taste is a very drinkable mix between some peppery and spicy rye malt notes with a bitter and light citrus hoppy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with no flaws though not as powerful as expected."

"D - Very drinkable. Good Rye IPA. Nice balance of flavors, could have used a touch more hops."

"Overall: I really liked this beer. Next year, I should compare it to their regular IPA to see if I can isolate the rye addition."

""
""
"O: A very nice Rye IPA that I wish I had more bottles of."
"This is a good brew. It has a nice bitterness and malty aftertaste. It is just a good clean brew."

"Ordered a bottle at West on Centre during a Sunday afternoon meet-up. Poured into a Harpoon IPA glass. Nice light brown color with slight orange highlights. Thin white head, with small bits of lacing. Really spicy aroma. Taste was pleasant with enough hops of front to stand out, but the spice from the rye added a nice balance. Mouthfeel was manageable. The 6.6 abv was not really noticeable. I found this beer to be tasty and refreshing, and a nice beer to enjoy on it's own."
"This is by far my favorite Rye I.P.A that I have tried so far. After I was pouring in into my pint glass the beer left a nice two inch head. My nose was lit up as I took in the inviting smell of spice, citrus and oh those hops. Every sip you are required to savor the taste and enjoy the carbonation as is glides down your throat. I hope that Sierra Nevada decides to make this beer year round, as I have been sending them letters asking so. If you have not tried this beer I would recommend it ANY time you see it! I am glad to have had the pleasure to enjoy such a well crafted beer."

"Overall: An excellent brew from Sierra Nevada. I'm rather happy to have it in my fridge right now!"

"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, high carbonation. Fruity, spicy, grainy, good bitterness and a pretty good mix of flavors. The rye works pretty well and adds a little bit of unexpected depth."

"A very drinkable beer, and one I wish I had more of right now. Tastiest beer I’ve drank all week"

"355ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Pours orangish deep amber in color & quite crystal clear appearance. White, close & creamy, lasting crown. Moderate mildy malt to the nose while intense citric hop with piney touch completes underneath the aroma profile. Slightly grainy & spicy flavor, subtle resiny notes.Gentle bitterness. Flavorful medium body, soft carbonation. Rye provides a funny dry finish rounded by smooth hoppiness .Fruity hues on the aftertaste. Well balanced, refreshing & drinkable. Expect an odd beer not just a regular American IPA."

"Cheers!"

"Overall: A well crafted rye IPA."

""
""
""
""
"O:  This really showcases the rye with a combination of well meshed flavor profiles. Nice and hoppy but smooth and easy to drink. Leaves your mouth wanting more. "
""
"A good (rye) IPA, but it 'suffers' from that Sierra Nevada affliction - that of characteristically damned (and equally heavenly) hoppy offerings. While it's a shame that it overrides the rye adjunct here, somehow that just doesn't bother me right now."
""
""
""
""
" Overall, I give it very high marks but, again, it's probably not for everyone."
""
"Beer pours a deep copper color with a thick cap of foam above. The aroma is floral hops, not much from the malt. On the palate, the malt, the bite of the rye and the bitterness of the hops meld to form a smooth drinking, balanced beer. The mouthfeel is thick from the grains. There is nothing ruthless about it, but it is a smooth drinkable brew."
""
""
""
"O: This was a nice offering, but I didn't think it was anything special. I hope someone comes in and knocks the socks off the Rye IPA deviation from the norm!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It is a perfectly and wonderfully vanilla beer that I felt as if I needed to drink colder and colder as I made my way through the six pack over a period of 2 weeks. Over all I would award a 3.5."
""
"O: An AIPA, with obvious rye to balance the American hops - acrually a great idea."
""
""
"In all a good exemplary rye IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's an ok rye pa. SN has done much better, though."
""
""
""
"M- A slight sharpness of the carbonation. A little more than I prefer. But it's countered very nicely by its richness (without being too much so). Not at all chewy, and not not of an aftertaste (good)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-- Pretty much beer my stand by beer for the last two months. Quite enjoy the beer as the rye really makes this work. Holds up better than other US IPA's that make the trip here. Good beer to have several of in a night."
""
"All flavors perfectly blended. Great."
""
""
"Very decent. It's certainly not what I expected. This is more of a rye beer and less of an IPA, but that's more exciting. It's different and interesting, and forms another different entry into the SN range."

""
""
""
""
"Overall a simply tasty beverage but i don't taste as much rye as I would like."

"Overall, a very nice ipa. I'm not the biggest fan of rye beers, but this has enough hop character to entertain my palate."
""
"O/D - Pretty neat. Lot's of flavour and not bad to sit and sip but the spicy rye was a bit much. Otherwise alright."
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, sweet malt, rye, hint of roasted malt, slight caramel malt, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of rye, hint of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of citrus, hops, and slight caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, great aroma, good feel, and good blend."
""
"O: I really like this beer. This might be the best Sierra Nevada beer out there. I'm digging it."
""
""
"O - This is my first Rye IPA, and I've got to say I really enjoyed it. It's quite similar to their Torpedo Extra IPA, but with a more peppery and bready side to it. I hope they make it a regular seasonal release."
""
"First sip reveals an average body and fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is briefly grainy caramel malt and then rolls to some bitter rindy hops and bit of black pepper. Finish is dry and lingering bitterness. No hints of any booze and a fairly smooth overall experience. Nice bitey brew."
""
"O - A solid drinkable IPA, but the rye aspect doesn't really seem ""ruthless"" to me."
"O: Great flavors, nice balance, and decently smooth, not a bad look and pretty fragrant as well"
""
""

"Well, hardly surprising this is a well made beer. Mouthfeel is spot on. Enough so that it's not watery but not too much that it gets heavy by the end. As for drinkability, it finishes clean enough that the rye doesn't build up and overload the palate with that spicy character. Drink it at a reasonable pace and just keep on drinking."
"Overall, one of SNs better efforts. May have travelled better than others I have tried."
""
"O: a really nice beverage and something i could drink more than once. appearance for me was the outstanding factor and looking at it made me want to drink it. nose a little on the average side but definitely not empty and taste is one that lingers. good beer all up."
"Overall: Probably the most rye beer I have had yet. But if classified as an IPA, it seems lacking compared to many others in the style. The good use of rye sets it apart from most, but does not necessarily make it better than them. Still a great beer."
""
""
""
"O- Very good beer. Big and complex, yet drinkable. Bargain at $14.99 for 12."
"with a nice bouncy head and a nice amber color it isn't to hoppy in smell. i was expecting more rye flavor but this beer doesn't dissapoint . for me this is another wonderful beer from the people at sierra nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice beer, not as hoppy as I expected but I don't hold that against it. For the price, pretty hard to beat this beer."
"Taste has a more malty presence than the nose would indicate, the rye definitely lends a bit more body to the beer, hop flavors are still quite evident with the citrus pine being the most prominent, light bitterness that doesn't overstay its welcome, very solid."
""
"Overall: Very nice beer, really enjoyable. It certainly competes with the Pale Ale and the Torpedo, which are both favourites of mine. It's really well balanced and I'd definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was not a big bitter beer and went down really easy. I would easily pick up a six pack of this next time it is in season."
""
"O: Yummy! Great balance of spicy rye malt notes with big in-your-face hop aroma and flavor, with a substantial hop bittering into finish. A hop bomb, but with enough malt to back it up."
"Overall / Drinkability: Other than the mouthfeel starting out good and ending up not so good, this is a pretty good AIPA. The rye doesn't stick out so much for me and as the beer warms up it loses a few things, but when first poured and still a bit cold, it's a very drinkable and smooth AIPA - hop forward with a good malt backbone. I wonder how this would be on tap....anyway, a good beer and worth trying."

"As I drank thus beer, I think I almost got used to it, that is the bitterness. Tasty enough overall. I wouldn t drink more than 1 at a time though. I would say that it is not Sierra' s best. Nonetheless it is an interesting brew, worth a try."
"I'm naturally interested in seeing just how ruthless this rye is. It's a nice hearty ale, yes. Good spiced tones (from the the I assume). Overall, this is a good beer, which I expect from Sierra Nevada. It's not blowing me away with some out there and unusual character, but it's a mighty tasty brew."
""
"Overall - I can actually taste a bit of the SN Pale Ale in this one. It's like they used the same recipe and threw in some more malts and rye. Regardless, this is a very good beer that I will buy again."
""
""
""
"O: I like what the rye adds to the hops. The two are synergistic making for an enjoyable brew."
""
""
"O: A pleasant, complex rye IPA: hoppy and grainy and man, that rye is good"
"A nice mix of a doughy, bready beer and an IPA. The rye really stands out in this beer and the mix of hops balances it nicely. A bright amber pour with a small white head. Nice lacing on my glass that sticks throughout. Aroma of malts, rye, and hops. Flavor is citrusy hops and rye bread. A really nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I have it a good grade. Great IPA and honestly, awesome fantasy label!"
""
"This medium bodied ale has a light malt and citrusy dry aftertaste ."
"Very nice offering."

"A perfect balance of bitterness and carbonation that bespoke and begged for long slow drinking"
""
""
"good little hop fix for a saturday afternoon. very fresh and drinkable."
"You get a little over a finger’s worth of very even foam, dense with a few islands of larger bubbles, wispy lacing without much stick, retention is average and unremarkable. Deep bronze hued liquid, clear with an orange to yellow tint at the glass bottom, the bubbles are tiny and spread wide, shines brightly. The rye gives the nose a pleasing rugged to raw feel, scrubs deeply, fairly herbal with grapefruit pith and unprocessed grains, rock salt, you only get the powdered chocolate as it warms, any flowers or fruit muted. Medium-bodied, muscular in feel, flexes more than flows, the carbonation isn’t aggressive nor creamy, just nudges things now and then. The orange, tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus starts out sweet and then yields to the herbaceousness, pine cone and rye. The peach, apricot, pineapple fruit speaks more clearly here. Light toastiness but not doughy nor bready per se. Hard to find a distinct flavor profile to the malts, at most basic milk chocolate. Solidly constructed yet unremarkable, which is not really a slam at all."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light-medium bodied with moderate fine carbonation, very nice. Overall, a decent, fairly unique IPA. Not quite the hop bomb I was expecting, but still decent."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice offering which well represents the rye in both the aroma and flavor which I find is usually faint in many other rye beers out there."
""
"Taste is quite hoppy with some malt, citrus and astringency. Pretty nice beer. The field is so crowded with the IPA offerings it is good but just does not stand out. Good drink though. Carbonation and mouth feel are quite good and overall worth stocking."
""
"Spicey rye and hop combo for a bitter cracker and earthy oarnge zest marmalade. The malt flavors thins from middle to the finish. The palate is resiny to start and thins out to the finish. Aftertaste is watery and bitter."
""
""
""
"Overall - Creativity scores big on this one, Sierra Nevada keeps it's best ideas in the think tank."
"A decent rye IPA, but I don't really feel the need to revisit this one anytime soon."
""
""
"Pours a nice caramelly reddish brown color with a really nice head. The head retains extremely well and leaves a nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose is full of piney hops with some spicy rye. Taste is citrusy up front that moves to some of the rye and cereal malts. Finishes with a nice punch of piney hops. Pretty solid RyePA. Good mouthfeel as it goes down. Overall, this is another solid beer from Sierra Nevada. They accomplish what they set out to do and delivered really well. Recommended!"
""
"Good job as always Sierra Nevada"
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been on a Belgian kick, so this is a nice change-up. Mild hops for an IPA. Per usual, the rye does a nice job of blending together with the citrus and pine hops. Definitely a nice refreshing spring seasonal."
""
""
"2nd tasting from bottle dated 58 days ago reveals big cracked pepper spice and pungent Seville orange. Much punchier, almost harsh, compared to first impressions."
""
""
""
"So, I normally love Ruthless. As far as I'm concerned this is a brilliant addition to the SN lineup, and a classic in its own right. In the cask, however, I LOVE this IPA! I had it at Bierkraft in Brooklyn, and was simply blown away by everything from the appearance to the taste. The light carbonation enhanced the malt flavors, and boosted the mouthfeel giving this Ruthless a bigger presence. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly impressed with this beer. I generally think of Sierra Nevada as the standard ""I just need a descent beer"" beer. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Nice malt and hop balance, and a great finish. I actually ended up buying a second 6pack, which is extremely uncommon for me. I think this might be my new ""everyday pale"""
""
""
""
"Overall, a quality beer, but not my personal choice when it comes to SN hoppy beers. If you're looking for a rye IPA though, or just curious, give it a shot."
"O.  Definatley an interesting beer and has done enough to make me try some other rye ipas, but felt overall this beer was a little unbalanced, alcohol taste a little overbearing. I will probably try thus beer again at some point as sierras beers are more affordable than a lot of USA to UK imports but wouldnt go out of my way to buy it over some of their other excellent beers"
""
"The rye manages a smooth, even keel while the hops drive the majority of the flavor impact...from an initial floral blast to a clean, herbal bitterness. Malts probably dont get enough credit in this beer and help provide a lightly sweet, toffee-ish backdrop that is both neutral and productive at the same time. Mouthfeel is on the thin side and a tad soapy, but those are mild complaints. One of the better rye beers I have had and a sixer didnt last too long in the fridge, another one might be soon to follow."
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and a bitter aftertaste with a dry finish. Oily and resinous. If you are in the mood to have a bitter beer, this one will do the job."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad brew, considering I don't really like IPA style and I have come back to this a second time says something at least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"poured a nice clean amber with about an inch of foamy off white head. very hop heavy aroma full of scents of grass, pine, citrus (grapefruit), and a grape like smell to it. the taste is very bold! bitter up front from the hops and very roasted taste from the rye, a chocolatey hint to it, and a bit of a raspberry/honey overtone in the roof of the mouth. medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. this is a nice session ale for any season."
""
""
""
"Great look with an orange amber hue and a thick foamy head. Extremely frothy lacing as the beer goes down. Aroma is welcoming, with grapefruit and resinous hop elements, and spicy rye. While I expected this beer to be more bitter, I was surprised to be greeted by a sweet and noticeably malty start to the flavor, with a sweet citrus aspect too, but it did fade out with a good bitter hop finish. Although I do detect the 'graininess' of the Rye, I would like it to be more pronounced. The beer is a little sticky, coating the mouth well but it is rather light bodied. Overall, this is good but Founders is still the reigning champion of Rye-P-As in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer for summer, was delicious with a plate of pulled pork BBQ. clean, light and grassy with a distinct flavor of rye."
""
""
""
"O - This is a real delicious beer that presents itself nicely and has a nice balance of sweetness up front leaving behind bitter remants. This was recommended to me by my local beer guy and I now recommend it to anybody reading this review."
""
""
"Very nice - a great blend of malt and aromatic hops. The rye flavour is distinct, despite only being a small portion of the malt bill. The citrus aroma is also pleasing - it pairs well with the malt whereas other hop types might have been antagonistic. Superb mouthfeel with incredibly smoothness. A lovely beer; grab one now if you can."
"This is a great IPA. Lots of hop nuance and great balance with malts. I highly recommend this quaffable stuff."
""
"The flavor has a lot of hops mixed with the rye. Exactly what you would expect from a rye IPA. Up front there is a dry earthy and oily hop flavor with rye bread and a hint of toasted malt. All the hops leaves the finish dry, bitter and satisfying."
"Overall, a very good IPA, probably because this bottle is very fresh. Would seek it to buy it again. Another very nice beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Could use a bit more carbonation."
""
""
""
"When I poured this beer, it has a nice copper body with not a lot of head to it. The smell has a nice hop and citrus smell to it. The taste has a nice bitter hop flavor up front. Also has a nice peppery taste to it, with a hint of rye. The mouth feel is nice with a weird after taste to it. Overall this is a really good beer and i would buy again."
""
"O: I think this beer is pretty good, I dunno if I would buy it again but if you like their pale ale and want to branch out this would be a good starting point. Also would be a great beer to slowly get into rye."
"O - A smooth drinking flavour packed IPA that loads you up with citrus hops and a pile of bitterness. Slightly reminiscent of the bitterness on an ESB, but strong on the citrus. I quite enjoyed this one."
""
""
"Overall: It's like they squeezed all the hop goodness out and used it for another beer. I like the rye aspect and taste, but the hop profile is much more English than American; bittering rather than flavoring. It's probably a personal preference, but I just don't enjoy this end of the hop spectrum. Maybe you will."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an rich amber color, with a big off white head that leaves nice lacing behind. The nose is weak, but has some floral hop notes followed by some malty tones. Has a smoothe taste beginning with a piney hop note followed by malty rye tones. Plesant, medium mouthfeel and carbonation refreshing. Overall a solid brew and worth picking up a six pack. I would like a little stronger rye presence, however it is still a very enjoyable beer and I will buy it again."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye is a perfectly clear and sparkling light copper ale with a dense, lumpy, creamy head that has pockets of large bubbles in it. The retention and lacing is outstanding. The juicy citrus hops speak loudly of tangerines and grapefruit while conversing about spicy rye and muttering something about caramel. One whiff makes the mouth water. It's medium bodied and quite smooth and lively in the mouth. The finish is dry and crunchy. It tastes nice and bitter with the main flavor being tangerine peel. After the swallow, there's a wave of rye whiskey flavor. The taste of bitter citrus is sustained for a while. There's a juiciness throughout, but not really any sweetness. Wow, I see why all my friends have been going nuts about this. It's a pretty manly pale ale. It's hard to stop at one pint."
""
""
"This poured out as a nice looking amber color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer has some nice hop aromas with the addition of the rye in there too. The taste of the beer had a pretty good balance of spicy rye with the fresh hop flavors. The mouthfeel of the beer was good, nice carbonation and drinkablity to it. Overall this beer wasn't too bad, I'd drink it again if I came across it and was in the mood to have it again."
""
""
""
"Nice, crisp rye flavor accompanied by a pretty aggressive hop profile. It's aggressive, but not overdone. I think hopheads must really like this beer. I wish it had a tiny bit more malt presence, but it's very good. The beer has a medium body and a really dry finish. If I was forced to compare this to my favorite rye beer (Founders Red's Rye), I would have to say this one comes up a bit short, but it's still excellent. I could drink this often and not get tired of it."
"Overall a great Rye IPA. Check it out if you get a chance."
"O: Maybe I'm just not in the right mood for this beer right now, or maybe it wasn't stored very well, but it doesn't do much for me. That said, there's nothing bad about it. I'd rather have a Righteous."

""
""
"Pours a deep copper with a generous white head that lasts for a long time and leaves good spider web lacing on the glass. The aroma is of grains, some citrus, and piney hops. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of roast present and keeping things in balance with solid hop bitterness. Palate is medium."
"Great IPA, that I highly recommend."
"O: A tasty IPA and a very nice rye beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Reddish-amberish with a small white head that quickly leaves the scene. Sweet and piney aroma, hops seemed kinda week. Taste started off a little sweet the rye kicked in towards the center alongside some pine. Flavor seemed kind of lacking overall, could have been an old faded bottle? Medium body but crisp with some activity from the carbonation. Overall, was not too impressed with this. Nothing about it stood out to me, though nothing about it made it bad. Just kind of meh."
"I really enjoy this, lots of interesting flavors that worked really well together for me. If you can find it I'd say it's worth a try."

"O: a bold direct ""masculine"" beer that would probably be better enjoyed with food."
"O: Despite a heavier mouthfeel than many IPAs, the bitterness lingers enough for me to think I could session this thing beer pretty well."

""
"Value: Great as usual with Sierra Nevada. At less than ten bucks a sixer, you can't go wrong. I like this one a little better than Terrapin Rye Pale Ale."

"Would give this a five overall, but it may just be that it's only the best rye I have had recently- and i haven't had many in close to a year."
""
"Pours a burnt copper hue with a two finger head and some lacing here and there,the smell is toffee,herbal piney hops and a touch of spice,the mouthfeel is just under medium bodied and has tastes of fruitcake,piney hops that are subdued a little from the rye but you still know your drinking an IPA and also a light touch of pepper and boiled candy with the finish being bitter and a touch spicy and overall its a nice Rye IPA and a nice session beer would drink again."
"O - I think I may have found a new favorite from Sierra Nevada."
"D: Not that there was ever any doubt, but this is a really nice rye IPA from Sierra Nevada. In many ways, it's similar to its other IPAs (which are excellent), but the rye does add a nice bready dimension to this beer. To my palate, rye really fits well with hoppy American styles. It's great to see it becoming more popular."
""
"Overall, a good rye IPA. I could go for more citrus/grapefruit hop flavor to balance with the malt and rye."
""
""
"O: One of my new favorite brews. The hops take the spotlight, but are perfectly balanced with the citrus flavors. It may be too bitter for some, but for others it will really hit the spot."
"O: For IPA fans you will like this beer. Lots of hoppy flavor. A clean , crisp drink."
""
"O - an excellent take on a rye/IPA."
""
"Strong aroma has a decided overtone of rye with hints of malt and hops and a subtle note of apple. It pours a clear, dark copper with a thick, fluffy, pale cream head that hangs around for a while. Rye flavor has a strong hoppy note and hints of malt and fruit, both apple and grapefruit. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has a good tingle to it."
""
"A damn decent hop bitterness that really compliments the sweet grains happens in the mouthfeel. There is also an exclamation point of rye dryness. A solid beer but not the best rye brew or IPA but that shouldn't stop you from trying it."
""
"This is a great beer. Color is a bit copper and a bit golden. Head is medium with pale and tan hues. Nose is an impeccable selection of hops and effervescent hints of roasted barley. Taste is straightforward hops. Very bitter, very dry, very good. Not much residual malt on the tongue. Mouthfeel is extremely crisp. Overall great brew, didn't expect any less from SN."
"Overall: Very good IPA, and an excellent example if a Rye IPA. This has become one of my favorite spring seasonals."
""
"Big rye flavor, just the way I like it with a good balance only hinting at its IPA character. The mouthfeel is a bit distracting in the drying linger. The rye, however is the star and stays around in only slightly diminishing strength throughout the entire glass."
""

""
""
""
"Edit: Have been enjoying more while getting through the six-pack."
""
""
"I was a bit skeptical about this one, but I'm glad I got it. Cheers!"
""
"Overall, the strong rye flavor brings this down a notch for me."
"O: Another well-crafted IPA from SN. The 6.6% ABV Ruthless Rye marries peppery and tangy rye malt sugars with floral, bitter and juicy American hops. More hallmark quality from the brewers in Chico."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed Sierra Nevada's take on the Rye-IPA. Definitely a hearty brew which is packed full of well-married flavors. I wouldn't bat an eyelash at buying a sixer."
""
""
""
"O: Really a very nice beer and one that I will enjoy a few more times this year while it is available in the area. I'm a fan of the rye spiciness with the IPA hops."
""
"Ah Sierra Nevada, always coming out with new beers and never letting me down. Always been a fan of the Rye style in beers so I was eager to try this one. A considerable amount of spiciness in the taste and a nice well balanced IPA. Packs quite a punch with a high ABV but the beer remains fairly smooth and has a nice mouthfeel. I'm usually a fan of most IPA's, and the rye is a nice touch.. really good beer and definitely worth trying."
""
"O: Very good, thirst-quenching IPA from Sierra Nevada"
"O. A very good tasting beer that is everything someone would expect from Sierra Nevada plus a whole lot more. Highly recommended."
""
""
"overall i would consider this another winner from those hop whores at SN. as a spring seasonal it breaks conventional wisdom and definitely is more interesting than the pale bock that preceded this concoction. if you like your beers spicy, this one is ruthless."
""
"Taste up front is bitter herb with a rye nuttiness, followed by bitter and sweet grapefruit, then a touch of biscuity malt towards the end, but it is fleeting and brief in the dry finish. This is hop dominated and lively in the mouth, with just a hint of malt to keep it from total chaos. An excellent IPA and a wonderful use of rye. Also, one few beers where I can detect a full fleshy grapefruit flavor with the sweet grapefruit notes as well as the bitter."
""
"O - There was a great deal of balance in this beer...the sweetness was kept in check as well as the addition of the rye...a very pleasant offering from the guys at Sierra Nevada"
"Another good mass beer from Sierra Nevada, give it a try if you see it at a decent price."

"I would pair it with a cubs game from the bleachers with a wrigley hot dog."
"Doing a rerate here, must have had a bad bottle last time. Pours a deep red amber color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma of rye spice and lots of piney hops, with maybe a hint of grapefruit in the background. Flavor has hop bitter up front, with a spicy dry finish and lots of caramel malt. Pretty easy drinking and a nice changeup with the additional spice from the rye. Medium high carbonation is a bit prickly."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is legit. It drinks incredibly well and for $1 a bottle you can't go wrong. Please SN, keep this fresh and keep this year round. This is a beer that will be seen in my fridge a lot."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye IPA: This brew was sampled on tap with friends and food. Copper in color, decent hoppy aroma and a thin head that laces well get things going. Smooth malt start and a bright hoppy finish make for a top notch IPA. The rye flavor makes its way into the middle, and works very well. I was skeptical, but give this Sierra Nevada product good marks. They make a high quality suite of IPA’s, the this rye offering is no exception."
""
""
"Glad that I remembered I hadn't reviewed this yet, I was working through my last bottle from the 12-pack I bought, and realized I was about to do something awful. It pours a beautifully hazy red-copper color with a large head. The aroma is fantastic, there's a great amount of spicy rye balanced with a very unique herbal, yet aggressive hop that works fantastically with the rye. The taste is also fantastic, the rye contributes such a great spiciness and just a touch of sweetness. Those flavors blend perfectly with the very unique hop flavor this beer has - it's hop forward, but not the typical citrus or pine hop you'll find in an IPA. It's a bizarre, yet delicious very strong herbal and earthy hop that blends fantastically with the rye flavors. The mouthfeel is spot-on, and the drinkability is fantastic. It's probably the best rye beer I've had, hands-down. For this beer to be this affordable is just about unfair for the other beers on the shelf. Highly recommended."
"Ruthless Rye is tasty, but far from the unmerciful hop and rye bomb the name implies. In fact, it could use a little more of both."
""
"Solid. Almost like torpedo with rye added. Really enjoyed this beer."
"A really decent rye beer. I find the rye really shining through in the aroma department, but it also does a fine job mixing with the more traditional malt and hop components in this brew. Refreshing with a nice touch of rye complexity to keep this beer interesting and enjoyable."
""
""
"Like everybody else I could go on and on about this ale. It's great, no doubt about it. My only question is, ""How do I really know what rye tastes like""? It would be nice if somebody brought out a ""simple"" rye beer or ale without all the hops just to let's know."
"A deep clear amber with a nice lasting beige head with good lacing on the pour. Aroma of caramel malt, earthy piney hops, rye, grains fills the senses with some subtle fruity citrus notes as it warms up. Taste is sweet caramel malt with some earthy, citrus hops, some spicy rye and grain notes. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast, rye, with some citrus notes ending with a lingering sweet bitter earthy rye hops taste. Not overly bitter a nice balance of bitter sweetness. Overall a very good and balanced any tasty brew."
"Cheers to SN for keeping it hoppy!"

"	It’s a bit odd to me that instead of a winter warmer, SN makes a seasonal winter IPA, only to be followed by a spring seasonal IPA. Ruthless is good, but with the brewery’s focus on IPAs, it better be."
""
""
"As a rye beer this gets high marks from me, as it is the first one where I have really known the rye is there and a defining characteristic. I also really like it because I like what Sierra Nevada does and this is classic Sierra Nevada."
""
"I had this beer out of a bottle and poured it into a glass. I have to say I was stunned when I had it. It has a great smell that has a nutty smell to it. You can smell the aroma hops at work. The taste is definitely strong and reminiscent of an IPA, but it has a strong rye favor. I can taste some spice in the beer, but over arching I can taste a pleasant conflict of orange and rye. It seems like such a simple blend, but definitely crafted perfectly. It has a smooth feel and leaves a strong sweet after taste. I would definitely suggest this beer anytime, and a good beer to give to friends."

"Overall: A nice dry rye ipa. Of the Sierra Nevada bitter ipas, this one is my favorite. Similar to other SN beers, but the rye shines here. Granted there are other rye IPAs and rye beers I would go to first, but I could see myself sipping on a couple of these."
""

"C-"

"Beer poured into a glass with a nice brownish tint. Amber in hue, with a hint of citrus and grainy malts for the aroma. Also a sweet, sugary sense to the aroma as well. Minimal frothy head, and sweet, but not bitter citrus and malts taste. The beer tastes very clean and refreshing. Not too heavy for a rye, and goes great with a steak. A very worthy effort from a mainstream brewer. This is outstanding."
"Overall, I like this beer a good deal. It's a welcome variation on the SNPA/Torpedo theme."
"Notes: This is not a typical I.P.A the breadiness sets it apart it's very tasty. Cheers."
"This is a great American IPA and will rise in popularity IMHO."

""
""
"OVERALL: I love Sierra Nevada and maybe I am grading this one on an unfair curve because of the high bar they have already set for themselves, but I was excited about this one and I am finding myself underwhelmed. Maybe since this was the first year there is still room for improvement in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a beer I'll be going to in the future but I'm glad I tried it. The hops are there but seem to play second fiddle to that bold peppery malt thing it has going on. "
"This isn't the grand slam I was hoping for, but I'll take a rye double into the corner any time. Very good rye that really pulls all the ingredients together into a spicy, hoppy, tasty whole. I'll come back to this one again, my favorite Sierra Nevada regular offering to date."
""
"O: This beer is very tasty has an interesting mix of piney, spicy and citrusy flavors."
""
""
"O: Definitely interesting, seems well crafted in that there's a lot of different flavors/notes going on. I just don't like the rye flavor I feel. The IPA part of it seems spot on. If you want a Rye IPA you wont be disappointed, even though I don't like it, I recommenced it, if that makes sense."
""
"I have to say, i was excited for this one, but it is probably one of my less favorite of the SN beers."

"M: Highly carbonated with a drying finish."

"overall - could use a bit more hops to balance out the rye but it does well once it warms up especially"

"The Rest: Lots o'hops and a unique malt profile make this one to check out. I don't think I'll have any issue finishing the sixer that I bought."
"o: Another reasonably priced, excellent IPA from SN. Love those guys."

"Picked up a sixtel at Lukas after hearing good things. I've had about the half the keg and feel comfortable reviewing now. Poured from my system to a pint glass the beer pours a perfectly clear dark copper color with a 2 finger white/cream colored head with excellent retention with lots of lacing remaining. The aroma is big with a lot of peppery spice, rye, citrus, and piney hop character. I enjoy the blend of spice from the rye and west coast hop tones. The flavor starts with the same intense rye pepper spice on the tongue. The hop character found in the nose comes through and again melds well with the spice. A foundation of caramel malt. Medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean with a lingering pepper hop on the tongue. Upper end of medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a really good representation of a Rye IPA. I'm enjoying it very much and would easily recommend."
""
""
""
"Definitely gonna buy at least another six pack of Ruthless Rye this season."

""

"From a 12 oz bottle with cryptic lot stamp into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!), this one’s a clear orange-amber color with lots of carbonation threads fueling a thick, creamy off-white head. Lots of clingy, sticky lace. Good looking beer. Nose of piney/citrus crisp hops, a bit bready, a bit sweet. On the tongue it’s sharp and crisp with a medium-hoppy flavor that’s strong yet still could be enjoyed over the course of several servings. I hate to say peppery because that’s what it says on the bottle, but lo and behold, it is peppery indeed, in a refreshing, complementary way. Wheaty, sweet-ish malt backbone, dry bitter finish. Slightly astringent hints of alcohol. Mouth is crisp and moderately bubbly. Overall, a solid IPA, nothing spectacular. Nothing really stands out about this “rye” IPA to me; it could be any other competent IPA. Definitely worth a try, though."
""
"O: I think SN hit another home run with this one. The rye character lends an interesting note. This is easily now one of my favorite SN beers. I would place this one next to Celebration, Pale Ale, and Bigfoot. Great effort - I dig this one a lot!"
""
""
"O: Not bad for a rye IPA, I was expecting a lot more from Sierra Nevada with this brew."
""
""
"Overall – very interesting and decent-tasting brew!"
"It hasn't been exactly a tumult this year. We've had several early starts to spring, in the dead of winter. But this is nice and well appreciated. I was almost ready to say that the rye malt overtakes the citrusy hop presence, but they re-emerged before I could type a word. It's a tasty, tidy tango, here's some peppery bready malt, here's your hops, cha, cha, cha…"
"O- A really nice offering from a brewery that fails to make a bad beer in my opinion. I much prefer this over Glissade. I will definitely buy this again."
"M&D - Sierra Nevada doesn't let you down, a layered and intriguing beer that makes you crave the next sip, balanced and drinkable, a superb beer"
"Overall - A good rye beer and a rather decent IPA. The combination make for a nice drinking beer."

"Cheers!"

"A decent beer. I probably wouldn't have guessed that rye was used. I feel it did add a slight peppery spice, but it could also be written off as hops I would think."
""
"This a nice drinkable example of a rye IPA that I'd definitely pick up regularly if it was available north of the border. Not ground breaking, but good flavor, balanced, and well-crafted overall."
""
"Nice minty and spicy kick from the rye with assortment of interesting hops. Very interesting and refreshing beer."
"O- A solid Rye IPA. Def worth a try and a 6 pack is very affordable. Another solid offering by SN."
""
""
"O -- This is a pleasant, nicely bitter IPA-style beer that balances the rye character well with bitter hops. I'm not usually a big fan of rye, but the balance with other flavors and aromas in this beer make it an interesting drink."
"I highly recommend trying this one, a really nice Rye IPA"
""
""

""

"Another good hoppy beer from SN, the rye does make its presence known with minty and spicy aromas and flavors. Put it on the list of good IPAs for future reference."
"This is my first Rye IPA and while it is very good, it is still very different from what I'm used to. Very nice hops characteristics and mouthfeel. The rye definitely has a very different aftertaste to it than a more commonly brewed IPA. Overall, a very good beer that I will drink again."
""
""
""
"Nice copper color, and the carbonation is just right. I will be looking foward to this realease every year now, very good."
"O - complex, robust, and generously hoppy, it's a hard one to pin down but that is a plus in this case, a very unique and tasty IPA"
"This was my first Rye IPA and because of this, I'm definitely gonna check out some more!"
"O-Very well balanced IPA. The rye is evident but not overwhelming, nice drinkable IPA"
"Pours a dark Cooper with an impressive off white head that slowly fades into a quarter inch cap. Lovely citrus aroma. Alternating citrus and pine flavors. Finishes with an unappealing roughness that is no doubt imparted by the rye. This is such a delightful beer! Probably would never have bought this beer, but had been curious about how it tastes. My neighbor brought some over and I'm pleased he did."
""
"If you're into rye, give this a buy. Especially if you're a fan of Sierra Nevada's Torpedo. I didn't expect to enjoy this beer so much, glad I picked it up!"
"COLOR DEEP RED	DRY HOPS CHINOOK, CITRA & EXPERIMENTAL HOPS"
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on February 8th, 2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with about an inch off-white head that sticks around a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like spicy (rye) and citrusy hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like spicy and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, with a bit of caramel and bready malt also noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little oily and is well carbonated. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, at $8.99 a 6-pack I'd certainly buy it again."
"character. Drinkability runs a little on the low side."
""
""
"All fans of IPA's and Sierra Nevada (Pale Ale & Torpedo) should not hesitate to pick this up while it's still available."
"(D)- Overall, another solid new IPA to the Sierra Nevada portfolio"
""
"O: Great rye tones and an excellent American IPA's if you want some boldness without being overwhelmed by too much hops and bitterness. Good balance of flavor for a combination of having to pace myself while drinking & still being very drinkable."
""
"D: low score here, this rich and thick brew is NOT to be guzzled. but it's GREAT!!!"
"Truly ruthless this beer needs to mellow out a little for me to enjoy it. I am all for complex beers with many different ingredient lending themselves to a well put together final product, but this beer is a bit too much. Pours Beautifully with a nice lasting two finger head. The aroma is very strong, smelling of pine and rye. The flavor is surprisingly potent for an amber beer, it would seem more suited to a darker beer. All in all this beer is like pouring half a bottle of cumin on your taco, Cumin is great but don't over do it."
"Overall, this is an interesting IPA. I like the daring ingredients. Risk takers deserve some credit for ingenuity. It won't be among my favorites but I would be willing to try it again. Just slightly above average overall. Perhaps it will grow on me as I move through the six pack but I have a funny feeling many reviewers have ""brewery goggles"" on this one - let's face it, if this was brewed by some rinky-dink Rhode Island brewery, well, you know what I am thinking..."
""
""
"I expected a stronger flavor but it was a mild IPA. Would be good for a hot summer day but a little light for this time of year and really does not give you the IBU fix for an IPA."
""
""
"My highest compliments to a beer well done!"
""
""
"Overall, I like it. It's a solid IPA and I like what the rye adds."
""
""
"Overall - The Rye/Pepper flavor is definitely a nice idea for IPAs, and it helps make for an interesting brew. With that said, those who don't like spicy flavors in their beers should avoid this. I'll admit I was a little skeptical buying this off a recommendation of a friend, but I'm glad I picked this up and Kudos to Sierra Nevada for making yet another solid beer!"
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer overall. It has a nice balance of malt and hops, and the complexity of the Rye mixed with the freshness of the hops makes the aroma one of the nicer attributes in this beer. All this said, I wouldn't consider it ""fantastic", so I won't have a problem drinking the one six-pack that I got, but I seriously doubt that I will be buying this again."
""
"O: Not what I was expecting from a Rye IPA, but still a very nice beer. Recommended. I might have another one after a period of time, but I wouldn't grab a six-pack unless it were to share."
""
""
"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours amber with an off-white, long lasting, foamy head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, bready malt and spices. The body is medium, very tangy. Citrusy, spicy hops, bready and caramel malt, some orange fruit fill the mouth. Delicious IPA."
"O: This is a fine American IPA and I like the spiciness that the rye lends to the flavor."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this beer seems to be just like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale with the extra rye IPA bitter bite to it."
""
""
"Aroma is hop-forward with a surprising honey element, along with the caramelized rye malts. The flavour is well balanced with a pleasantly bitter finish. The rye elements aren't overwhelming, which is ideal for my own personal preference, if not necessarily for the style..."
""
"A good reddish brown concoction lets a creamy head build and lace...Nice aromas of dandelions and cut grass. On the tongue it is mostly Weedy/piney hop esters. Leaves a nice bitter bite in the back of the mouth, a little spice from the alcohol lets you know the night is getting better. During the bitter onslaught there is an actual balance balance going on, with some rye pumpernickel malt flavors. Just something more to love about rye, it compliments both ends of the spectrum. Full bodied with a slick, stickiness. Hoppy, balanced and thick, quite enjoyable."
"this is definatly one of the better ryPA's ive had in awhile. maybe not as good as hop rod rye but still very enjoyable. the rye is right up front, which i like, still pretty hoppy. ill be buying this again."
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer. I like the mellowness of the bitters in this one and the sweet hints you get from the rye."
""
"O: Very heavy in the rye, which I appreciate, but would have liked a little more of the IPA to shine through. Still a solid beer from SN."
"Overall: Rye adds another dimension to your average IPA. One of the more rye forward beers I've had. Very tasty and highly drinkable."
"Can one be considered ""ruthful""? And, if so, what would one have to do to be so considered? Anyway, this stuff pours a deep amber topped by over a finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, lemon peel, rye spice, grass, and light flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spice really standing out quite nicely against the backdrop of grasses and citrus fruits (rinds and all, baby). It's similar to a rye-d-up version of SNPA. Nice. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice rye IPA, one that I wouldn't mind seeing year-round (though, 'til then, I'm more than happy to see this one in the Spring instead of that Glissade nonsense)."
"Yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. It's a testament to them in their production of flavorful and drinkable beers. Cheers!"
""
"Fix the body and this is a great beer. Despite its issues, I'm still glad I picked this up."
""
"O - I enjoyed the floral hops on this one, but to be honest the sweetness throws it off a bit as you continue working on the glass."
""
"Overall this is an above average beer. The carbonation comes out on the moderate side, and the body is medium-light. It is actually extremely drinkable, though I still wouldn't call it session able. A nice beer though."
""
""
"Reddish orange in color with an off-white, static, generous and fully froth. Citrus, vegetable oil and toasted grain to the nose. Tasted of rye, wheat, lemon oil and caramel. The balancing act is near perfect. Medium bodied with a smoothness that makes it feel lighter than it actually is. More consistent quality from the folks that have a lot of experience in that department."

"O- it's fine, but I don't know why Sierra Nevada decided they needed ANOTHER IPA in their lineup"
"O - Ruthless is an excellent American IPA. The rye compliments the hops nicely for a well-balanced and flavorful experience."
""
""
""
"This is yet again another top notch offering from Sierra Nevada. Love the mix here; case worthy."
"O: Overall I'd say this beer is not the most memorable rye you could have, but is by no means bad in any way. This beer lands somewhere tasty slightly above average for the category."
""
""
""
"O - I don't remember experiencing the combination of hops and rye until I tried this surprisingly good beer. The flavor is very unique, but also very enjoyable and balanced between the smoky rye, citrus hops, and subtle malts. I think more brewers should experiment with rye in their recipes, but in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy some more Ruthless Rye."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer. The rye is assertive, and is a fantastic compliment to the hop profile."
""
""
"If you like rye, this beer is for you as the brewer was not shy with it. It was very pronounced but really seemed to compliment the excellent IPA based beer rather than overpower it. Well done."
"Overall, I liked this a lot more than I expected to. With the nice flavor and SN's price range, I think I'll probably grab this beer fairly often. I'm not sure that I'd say this is the perfect rye beer, but it's pretty close to the perfect rye beer for me."

"O - This is a fine example of sipping on a well tamed grapefruit! Any IPA lover should certainly give this one a try."
""
""
"O- I bought a 6-pack that I do NOT intend to share with ""just anyone"". This is a VERY good beer."
"Pours deep amber with a finger length white head. There's an aroma of spiciness, grain, and citrus. The immediate flavors that hit the mouth are hops and malt. It's a little spicy in the finish. The rye flavor is definitely there. This is an interesting and well balanced IPA from Sierra Nevada. There is nice lacing left on the glass. The body is fairly light as is the carbonation. Overall, I'd say this beer is very solid and drinnkable."

"Overall not bad, I like ryePAs a lot and this is a good example of the style, could have been a little more bold in its flavors but nonetheless pleasant."
"This is my first Rye Beer so I can't really compare it to anything. However, an interesting beer. I'm enjoying every drink I take. For the amount of hops I pick up I would expect it to not be as smooth across the palate. I'll have no problem finishing the six pack and returning back for more."
""
"Almost like a hoppy amber, but the best rye pale U think I've had. Score one for the old guys. Very balanced, so many will not like, but I did."
""
"O- Ruthless rye is very rare as far as a rye ipa goes IMO. Great rye flavors that mesh well with the spicy and bitter hop taste. I will always come back for this one"
"As the beer warms up it gets a very earthy, infinitely rye like note and solid, brown-grain-bread character that becomes on par with the hop character. Because of the rye, this is definitely a very “dirty” IPA, and that is not a bad thing at all. It becomes quite a bit more complex. I could wish for some more citrus / fruit hop character, but the rye really accentuates the herbal / pine side of the hop character."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada has never failed in my eyes. Ruthless Rye upholds that expectation, but it's not part of the pantheon of SNPA, Bigfoot, and Torpedo."
"This beer is an amber-brown color with a thick off-white head. Nice clarity and lace. The aroma is grain and hops...not sure that I get rye in the smell as much as the taste, but it does have a grainy, husk-like scent. The hop aroma is fresh and resiny...pine and fresh-herb more than citric. Earthy, peppery, and very engaging. The rye character comes out more in the taste, which is also very bitter and hoppy. Some malt...toasted, light caramel. The whole package comes together nicely. Fuller in body than expected."
""
"It's a heavy hitting rye ale. Must enjoy punishing malt bill and hop profile to like it."
"OA: a good way to bring in spring, nice and refreshing while enjoying some good weather! and a grilled bbq chicken pizza."
"O - a nice spicy hoppy IPA"

"Overall, this was a severely disappointing beer. Thin, bad smell, bad taste just a poor excuse of a beer. I'm assuming most of the reviews are inflated due to it being an Sierra Nevada beer... Ruthless Rye, meet my drain."
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Just loved this one. Had two more on separate occasions and felt the same. The spicy kick of rye and piney/herbal hops combo just kills it for me. I am buying more and hoping it becomes a regular offering. I can see how this flavor combo is too much for some but for me it works."
"I could definitely see some people really loving this and it is a unique brew but it's just not for me."
"I was looking forward to this because I think rye is such a great compliment to many styles. Though there is none here. Just over barring bitterness. Good for the hop heads, but to me it feels a bit empty."

"Clear copper pour with a big Tan head that lasts forever and leaves a lot of lacing all the way to the end. A solid dose of hops in the aroma, fruity and citrusy with a nice amount of carbonation. Bold fruity hop flavor as well with citrus hop bitterness, light caramel sweetness especially when warmed up a bit, and a bigger hit of the spicy rye on the finish. Tasty!"
""
"Conclusion: This beer is aggressive and full flavored. Even at fridge temp it smacks with mouth with bold and untamed flavors. I can see people not being able to handle this as it doesn't taste like the thousands of other IPAs that have flooded the market, but in my opinion it is excellent. I love to see one of the rising ""craft giants"" (if there is such a thing) still turning out daring beers that risk criticism from the less courageous craft drinkers who can't think outside the box of ""West Coast IPA with minimal malt profile""."

"Medium bodied with a gentle carbonation that creates a smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish."

"O: The hops chosen and the rye character mix well. I'm almost sad that this is a winter seasonal because I'm sure it would be great on an early summer evening after a long day outside."

"O- I liked the fact at SN tried to market this beer with cool graphics. This beer is not very ruthless at all. The flavors are dull and this beer doesn't stand out to me as a good one from SN."
"I got a sixer of this when I got the last of the Celebration that I could, not a bad substitue I guess but with the exeption of the added rye, I don't find it all that different from a regular Sierra Nevada IPA."
""
"O: Wonderful variation on the IPA style that includes just the right amount of rye that i enjoy without dominating the entire flavor spectrum. "
""
""
"Another solid beer from Chico. A nice flavor profile and an ideal balance of hops and malt make this very drinkable. The rye really fills out the palate and mouthfeel giving this IPA a fair amount of complexity and presence. Finishes clean with a soft bitterness. Great choice at a good price."
"I'm mainly comparing this to Founder's Red Rye P.A. since it's the benchmark for the style, in my opinion. Ruthless Rye is not quite as good as Red Rye PA, but it's fairly close. This beer is a bit rough around the edges. I'd like for it to be more bright and citrusy as the label promises."

"5, 3.5, 4, 4, 4.5"
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer finishes clean and quells one's thirst. The body is just full enough to allow the flavors to come out without becoming sticky, which really helps the drinkability. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and does not detract from either the flavors or the experience."
"Pours a dark clear brown color with a two finger slightly off white head. The head gives way to decent lace up and down the glass. The aroma is of rye along with some citrus notes at the back end. The taste has a sweet malt backbone which gives way to a dry rye spiciness. The back end has a citrus up bite to it. Well balanced and round. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it was a solid ipa. It was nicely blended and well put together, an easy drink."
""
""
"D/O: This is a predominantly malt-focused pale ale, and its range is enhanced or extended by the strong rye presence. While rye seems to be emerging as the defining beer fad of 2012, its effective and fearless handling cannot be overstated here. Unlike most modern IPAs that rely on delicate and aromatic dry-hopped qualities to defile their sensory profile, this beer's malty focus pairs much more companionably with spicy foods."
""
""
"O: To be truly ruthless perhaps you have to be this smooth. Great balance. A nice suprise of an IPA."
"O: A solid offering from Sierra Nevada to be sure. The beer is well balanced, some sweetness, more bitterness. Nice and spicy, and worth a look"

""

"Maybe a tad unbalanced, but interesting and good for a little variety within the IPA world. I will probably be in the mood for another Ruthless Rye every so often."
""
"Amber colored with a small khaki head that recedes quickly, leaving fits of lace. Smell overall is rather faint but there are citrus and tropical elements noted. Taste opens up bitter with grapefruit elements, bitterness fades into a base of lightly sweet and biscuity malt with some bitterness lingering on the edges of the palate.  Mouthfeel is medium and holds together well. Carbonation is ample. Bitterness of grapefruit pith lingers on the finish, but isn't overpowering.  Solid offering.  Not at all fantastic and frankly not a great Rye beer, it's essentially one dimensional...but enjoyable."
""
"Recommended."
"This one took me by surprise. Not to many rye beers that have as much depth as this."
"O: A real solid new IPA, very tasty, very bitter but not overwhelmingly so."
""
""
"While this represents neither the best of rye or IPAs, it does do all of the big things right. I would have preferred a more explosive amount of rye, but as-is, this is just a solid, drinkable beer."
"Appearance is an amber/copper color with a nice froth. Smells of hops galore. Fruity undertone (cranberry?). A great amount of hops at first taste. Tons of character in this IPA, but a very smooth at the same time. The hints of rye are perfectly placed and not overpowering, and leaves a nice aftertaste. A fantastic spring IPA."
"O - A nice rye beer. Very hoppy but well balanced and a great complement to the grain make-up of this brew. Would suggest to anyone who enjoys hoppy beers and hasn't picked this one up yet. It's another solid offering from SN."
"That's a darn good beer - well-balanced hops, this distinctive tea, the spiciness of the rye."
"O: A pretty standard IPA with a nice touch of rye that isn't overpowering. Simple, drinkable and tasty. Can't go wrong."
"taste is almost similar to aroma. more toastiness though, the rye is inconspiculously absent. maybe it was there but i didnt get any of it"
"Overall- solid new offering from SN, Hopefully this sticks around through the summer. I'd love to have an ice cold one of these on a hot summer afternoon."
"Another great addition to the SN family. This is incredibly flavorful without wrecking the palate, although I think the peppery spice would probably wear me out before I finished a six pack."
""
""
"One of the best IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend."
"This beer pours a clear pale amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of spicy rye with caramel and grassy hops underneath. The taste is similar to the aroma with a nice firm bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I will certainly drink again."
""
""
""
"The Ruthless Rye IPA is a very good beer. The beer poured a amber/copper clear color with thine white head that left a spotty lace. The smell was piny spice and was very nice. The taste had a bit of bite to it, but came off the pallete very clean as most ryes do. The mouthfeel was a medium body beer with good carbonation. Overall a very good Rye IPA!"
"Mouthfeel is excellent- light to medium bodied with medium carbonation and a little hop oiliness. Definitely a good session beer given the pricetag- not an exceptional rye beer. Red's Rye PA is a better example of the style."
"Overall not bad, closer to American Rye Barleywine than an IPA, or more like DIPA without the abv although the amount if malts and syrupy sweetness make you think it is. The rye is OK but not as much as I was expecting, and the hops are good but get a bit heavy, as they were probably planning, but balanced with the big malts and sweetness so not too bad."
""
""
""
"I like this a lot, but then again, this is Sierra Nevada here, so I pretty much figured I would. Good to have an IPA that's not just a regular for a change."
"O - Rye lovers will definitely find this beer to match their tastes. Really forward in the flavor profile and not at all shy about it. Not quite as easy drinking as other Sierra Nevada IPA offerings, but very enjoyable in a different way. Don't think I'd have this as my everyday/go-to IPA, but now and then...a good beer to have."
""
""
""
"Very solid beer right here."
"Overall: Pretty darn good rye IPA"
"D - Pretty drinkable. I have had red ryes I like better. FUn try."
""
"That being said, this is not bad by any means. It is still a very good IPA - I just don't care for the rye flavor. Will pass in the future."
"O: SN hit the nail on the head. Amazing beer. What the style should be."
"O: Really nice example of a rye beer. I've only had a few but this is a style that has always impressed me. Really nice to drink."
""
""
"D- This beer suffers from an overbearing grass quality and the rye taste not shining through as much as it could. It looks beautiful but is just alright. Compared to the Founders Red Rye PA it is no where near as good."
"Overall another tasty offering from Sierra Nevada. Like the rye twist!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Is this well made?...Yes. Would I like to see SN step outside the box a little bit?....Most definitely. It's good, but not all that unique."
""
"O- I enjoyed it. Glad I decided to pick up a six pack of it."
"Maybe its the peppery taste of the rye, but the forward flavor of the hops seems to be in balance with the other flavors of this beer. I find that i'm actually enjoying an IPA. I'm glad i tried this, and i will get more."
"Overall I am a fan and will continue to drink it. However I have always enjoyed rye bread so that might explain my favorability. Wish it was year round."
""
"Taste is quite sharp, a nice strong bitterness with a earthy tone and some herbal vegital bits as well. Mouthfeel is a bit light but it's easy drinking and a good spring beer even though it doesn't feel anything like spring."
""
"Hops for days!"
""
""
"Drink- It's a fair offering. A bit thicker than most and a little one sided but it's a valid option for an intro Rye beer."
""
"I have to admit to passing this by quite a few times before finally picking up a six. I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of Celebration Ale, but most of Sierra Nevada's big releases have generally underwhelmed me. I was pretty impressed with the deft use of rye in this beer, when so many other rye beers fail to deliver on the promise. Poured a amber with an active head. Touch of sweetness balanced with firm hops bittering. The rye lends a distinctive peppery bite to the malt that is spot on."
""
""
"The rye is subtle but definitely present; this one is really well-balanced, relatively dry, and pleasant to sip. Very nice!"
"On second review and on the third bottle I had to re-rate it. It is so bitter at the end that I had to give it away. The bitterness would just not go away. blah"
"Drinkability: Solid stuff, and it does get me jonesing for spring. I am not sure if it makes for an ideal spring seasonal, though. IPA, it seems, is in season all the time."
""
""
"O: Wonderful rye and a wonderful IPA that when put together make a great beer. A bit too dry and and the rye can subtract a bit from the classic pine and citrus IPA players but other than that just great."
"Ruthless rye IPA pours a dark copper color, with a nice sized lacy head. There is a very nice dry hoppy aroma. There is a very nice hoppy taste, that finishes with a strong dry bitter flavor. The taste is very strong, but I would want another one of these. Overall this is a very good beer, a nice hoppy dry taste, there is something else in there that I cant put my finger on it, but a fantastic winter beer."
"Descent brew. Could use more balance. I think this style has been overdone and is losing its wow factor. Still pretty drinkable."
"O - This is a very nice rye IPA. Sierra Nevada does another good IPA."
""
"A very nice brew, one that, quality-wise, I'd stack up against SN's Bigfoot or Torpedo for the title of SN's best 12 oz brew they put out. A definite one to try if you can."
""
""
""
"Overall: As my first rye beer, this one is just great. It has the noticeable hoppyness of an IPA, but enough spicey rye to let you know that it's there. Delicious."
"- This beer kind of brings me back to their Anniversary Ale, which frankly pissed me off when they pulled it. This just seems to have a different sweetness and malt balance to it, but the hops are what brings me back. I read a bit of this beer before I finally purchased a bottle.. and am now surprised at some of the more negative reviews. This beer is damn good, and solid. I will be buying more for sure."
"12-oz bottle. Pours with a clear copper hued body and a large, lasting, just off-white head. Pretty decent retention with good lacing. Aromas are of spicy and citrusy. Lightly bready malt sweetness as well in the forefront. Floral and flowery with light esters. Medium grassy. Flavors are bready, grainy, lightly spicy with apricot notes. Notable rye rustic character. Crisp finish. Hops are strong, but mellowed by the rye and the sweetness of the malt. Hop flavors are piney and herbal. Good carbonation, medium bodied."
"Overall - This beer is decent/well crafted, but its a little too bitter and lacking in balancing flavor for me to like as much as some of the other Sierra Nevada offerings."
"Pours a dark amber with a one-finger pearl white head. Really nice lacing throughout. Aroma of pine, faint grapefruit and rye makes a late appearance. This is a perfectly drinkable IPA while maintaining a good level of bitterness. The flavor starts off with a bit of bready sweetness and some semi-sweet, but muted citrus notes. The spicy and bitter portion of this beer is next. Notes of pine, grass, spice, pepper and rye finish this one out. Quick bitter hop bursts, but the spicy rye kills the bitterness while adding a hint more sweetness before the finish and it ends clean and dry. Good use of the rye which makes this one a keeper."
""
"THis one is medium bodied and a little sticky. Leaves a lasting mild bitter."
""
""
"D- This is a really good drinkable beer. I still have Red's as the best, but this is very enjoyable. I'd like the rye to be a bit more prominent."
""
""
""
""
""
"But hey, I'm not complaining about the other 5 bottles waiting to be consumed."
""

""
"PS... Even though this is tasty, I’ll kind of miss Glissade, which I guess this is taking the place of..."
""
"Nice amber color. Thick, foamy white head that lasts. Smells: a little smoky, spicy, hoppy, pine. Tastes: caramel, spice, vanilla, malt, orange, hops. A very mellow flavor. Quite enjoyable. I guess the antecedent for this is Red's Rye PA from Founders, or maybe SN had done this first. I'd say in terms of quality they are dead even, with this beer being a bit less in terms of strong flavor. I liked this quite a bit and am actually glad it doesn't wallop you over the head with hops power. The ""IPA"" part is under-expressed here, and again I'm glad this is not a hop bomb. Hops are present and slightly strong, but blended with the rye and the woodsy malt flavors the overall feel is more warm and spicy than the typical citrus/pine IPA onslaught. Goes down very smooth and warming with a creamy mouthfeel. Could easily become a go-to medium bodied micro for me. Very nice beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer's temperment. It's windy here in AZ, and cooler than average, and this beer fits the mood of the day. Tumultuous is a good word."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and similar to the aroma with a dry, earthy hop presence that lingers over sweeter malts into a slight dry finish.  A bit hoppier than the nose suggested with some floral pine and hop oils along with some grapefruit and orange peel.  This is countered by sweet rye, caramel and toffee. Decent balance and easy to drink but a bit bland.  As it warms it becomes a little soapy and unpleasant.  "
""
""
"D- Very enjoyable beer, especially for the price!"
"O: Truth be told, it's only decent. I really wish this was a little more Rye and a little less IPA. Having said that, if you go into this expecting a straight-up IPA, you'll probably enjoy it more."
"Between the experimental hops they use in this beer, the malty rye bready taste and the spicyness from the rye and hops melding together makes this my favorite Sierra Nevada beer. Definitely too bad they don't have this as a year round beer."
"Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, with a medium body, light fizzy carbonation and an average feel overall that leaves a semi-dry bitter finish. Mild for an IPA, but still very refreshing and enjoyable. Another nice product from Sierra Nevada that I look forward to drinking again."
"O – Outstanding in all categories except maybe appearance, (could have used more head/lacing) I really enjoyed this. So well balanced that the taste buds don’t become bored or tired. I don’t personally find a lot of rye inspired ales, so this was a refreshing change. I wanted another when I was done, and I’ll be buying this again."
"That said, I could drink a fair amount of these. Also, it's nice to drink an IPA with such well developed and delicious malt character. Honestly, I would rather drink the Sierra Nevada seasonal that this beer replaced (Glissade), but I wouldn't turn this one down."
"Notes: Maybe a touch short of excellence but rather nice. Different styles and all but this is a great improvement over their Glissade in their rotation of seasonals, which I thought was rather weak. Sure that was a style that I typically don't find particularly attractive whereas I do love a well made rye brew. In any case this is a great addition to their rotation, and for my palate among the top two or three things they might offer on a regular basis."
"Ruthless Rye IPA, is definitely a great addition to Sierra Nevada's lineup. Although some may disagree, I'm happy to see it replace Glissade for their spring offering. Despite the fact that Ruthless is an IPA, the rye, and other darker malts, add a great amount of body and complexity."
"Overall I found this extremely enjoyable. Strong citrus flavors while keeping bitterness low. Kept the beer very drinkable. Rye added a nice touch as well."
""
""
"Thinner medium body, decent carbonation, feels a little watery and soft to me. I’m a fan of rye beers so I was looking forward to this but it fell a little flat for me. More rye spice and more hop flavor would really set it off nicely. For comparison’s sake, I had a Founders Red’s Rye after this and it blew it out of the water."
""
""
""
""
"Poured this into a pint glass. Pours a dark tawny brown, with faint ruby tints. Great rocky off-white head. Cascading sticky lace clings to the glass for dear life. Sierra Nevada knows what's up when it comes to aromatic hops. Love the nose on the one. Sharp green hops, citrus rind, with an herbal finish. The body lends itself well to this hybrid. Moderate depth and decent carbonation bolster up this spicy beer. The rye imparts a subtle smack of spicy twang, but nothing over the top. Lip-smacking juicy hops abound, as expected and hoped for. Another SN trademark. These characteristics meld very well together, leaving me sipping and gulping for more. Mild sweetness in the middle, but then rounded out with another smack of bitterness. Great beer. Hope to see this around year after year."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, green apple like rye and grainy. In the taste, sweet to dry rye, small green apple, and fresh pine like hops. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fresh hop in the aftertaste. Big rye, nice hops in the end, Nice and enjoyable."
""
"on second session, seemed a tad drier than wanted it, still good."
""
"O - This is quite a decent IPA and a huge step up from boring Glissade Golden Bock. A nice, spicy, hoppy beer that is perfect for the upcoming rainy trainsition to spring (what we mountain people call the ""mud season""). I'll definitely be getting more of this, very unique while being completely in the Sierra Nevada style."
""
""
"I generally enjoy beers with rye when done correctly and this was no exception. The rye brought a nice spice character to the beer that played very well with the citrus and earthy hop characteristics."
""
"Pours out a brownish copper color. Nice thick frothy head. One thing I noticed is that like their Torpedo IPA there is no thin layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle. The smell is of citric hops, and some tropical fruits. Now the taste is what throws me. Reminds me a heck of a lot of their other IPA Torpedo, and it makes me wish it were more like Celebration in that the dominating flavor profile are these wild tropical hops, some spicyness afforded by the rye and touch of black pepper. I was hoping for more grapefruity, piney hops like in Celebration. Not much pine, but lots of mango! Overall I think it is very good, I just think the choice of hops competes with the rye too much. I wish the rye could have shone through the hops a little more. I noticed on their website that some of the hops are simply described as ""experimental"". Now that is cool...Bravo hops are the bittering hops?? Anyway, the Citra hops make a grand appearance in this beer like them or not and this beer is complex and interesting from these west coast hops masters. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Overall a very good beer just not enough rye for me, i.e. Cane & Ebel. But for the record this is leaps and bounds better than Glissade which it replaces. That one just reminded me of a Euro Lager; light on flavor high on alcohol!"
"O-My overall impression is this is what a rye beer should be like. I'm sure it could be improved on a little, but I really enjoyed this one very much."
""
""
""
""
"I like the mix of hops and rye. Would try again."
"This is my first rye beer; it was interesting. Bready, citrusy, and pepper. A somewhat complex and hoppy taste."

"O - Haven't had many Ryes so I don't know how well this would stand to the competition but it wasn't my favorite beer."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad rye beer, but I prefer stronger more ""in your face rye"" and a heavier body. The stickiness of this really detracts from the taste. I'll stick to the many other Sierra brews that I love."
""
"Coppery with some sticky-looking lacing. Nose has the usual hops scents one expects from Sierra Nevada, but with a lot of stinky floral and rye overtones...floral almost the the point of a resinous cannibus bud smell. Hoppy, a little citrus (orange, grapefruit), pepper, and a lot of rye. Drinkable, but a touch of stickiness would leave me to hesitate to drink two in a row. Nice overall, but not the best in the genre, or from the brewery."
""
""
""
"O- A very enjoyable offering from the brewery. Similar to Founders' Red's Rye, just a little less rich. A perfect beer for spring."

"This is one slightly dark and spicy East Indian Girl. Pungent and memorable."
"Overall a really good beer would buy agian fore sure if i can find it."
"O: There was hardly any rye, much less ""ruthless"" as advertised. This is nothing more than an over-hopped IPA."
""
"Overall this is a very good rye ipa, not quite as tasty as hop rod rye but not far off."

"O: Very balanced and drinkable, it is yet another well-made, reasonably priced and widely available offering from a pioneering brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Clear reddish orange in body with off-white head that leaves great lacing. Smells of sharp rye, citrus rind, evergreen, and a hint of nuttiness. Impact: rye, citrus, slightly nutty, mint leaves, pepper and hop bitterness through it all. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavorful and warms the belly. An assault on the palate that works."
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting spin on a traditional IPA, Ruthless still has a large dose of bitter. Though the rye does add some spice and sour notes, the hops still rule over the flavor profile. Many might be surprise at the small, rather than large, addition the use of rye adds to the beer. Hop heads will still get their fix with Ruthless."
"The flavor matches the smell profile. This is a very dry beer--lip smacking. Plenty of earthiness in the malt. The hop bitterness is more pronounced and less ""grapefruity", more peppery."
""
""
"Pours a dark copper with an off white head. Decent lacing on the side of my snifter glass. The nose is rye, hops, spice and a little malt. The rye is in the forefront, and I dig it. The flavor is the same profile, with some fruit coming out as well. The hops/rye are out front on the taste. Feel is malt/hops battle, with a nice bite on the aftertaste. Overall, this is definitely one of the best rye beers I've had. Great job Sierra Nevada. Cheers."
"Another nice brew from SN."
""
"The mouthfeel was softly prickly with a medium body. Finishes rather smoothly. Incredibly drinkable beer."

""
"O: Very enjoyable beer. Very good IPA with a great integration of rye = a very good rye beer."
"A yellow copper color with a big heap of oatmeal colored fluff on top and great lacing. The aroma has a tart orange/grapefruit theme with some swampy malt funk, perhaps hints of the rye. Nice. The flavor is a nice combination of woodsy swamp hops and earthy malt. Crisp and pungent, it’s a bitter mouthful with a solid bready malt backbone. The hops are raw and outdoorsy, leafy good and it’s medium-light bodied for a solid hop treat. I think I can tell that there’s rye here but it’s an interesting, funkified version, and plenty good."
""
"Notes: moderate body and full of flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, but flavor makes up for it. Quite drinkable, and makes for a good Spring offering. I'm very happy they did away with Glissade and brewed a more exciting style. Not my favorite rye beer, but pretty solid overall."
""
""
""
"D - One of the better rye beers I have had. The rye is dominant but not overwhelming with a big hop kick."
""
"Pouring a clear deep reddish brown with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing, this is a very appealing beer. The nose has quite a prominent rye character, rather rustic, grainy, and spicy with white pepper (not caraway). This pairs very well with the pine and citrus that the hops bring to the table. The hops have a nice blend of bittering and flavor, though not quite as resiny as I'd like. Still, excellent. The palate opens with a blend of the rye flavors and the hops, rather excellently executed. Pleasing bitterness with a blend of citrus peel, pine and a little grapefruit, these flavors work very well with the peppery rye. All dark grain character appears to be quite fully fermented, lending a toasted grain flavor without any real sweetness. Drying on the finish with a blend of pine and rye, there's a little citrus sweetness to go with the pine resin. Medium light in body with creamy carbonation, this is expertly conditioned and is a treat on the palate. Highly recommended, this along with Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye define what a hoppy rye beer can be."
""
""
"Overall, a nice change from a standard IPA. I'm not sure how I think the vegetal character would keep it from being an IPA I go back to again and again, but it's definitely a unique and interesting beer."

"Aroma of grapefruit,/citrus. Spicy/peppery notes from the rye. Pours with a copper color, clear. Off white head laces on glass. First sip is a noticable bitterness along with the grapfruit notes. Spicy chararcter is notiable but plays a background in this beer. Would like to see a little more rye character. Bitterness is upfront malt is light and takes a back seat. First impression was not the best but as I finished the pint the mote I liked it."

"Poured a 2"" off-white head which took a while to dissipate. The body is a clear gold verging on amber. It smells like a medium IPA. Taste has slightly grapefruity hops and yes you do taste the slightly odd pepper and spice of rye. Seems a little salty to me, but all in all pretty good."

But it really seemed to me like nothing other than the standard SNPA using a lager yeast instead of their standard ale yeast. I really had to try to search for the rye character, and the scent and taste weren't very appealing to me otherwise. The body was ok, but not great. The finish wasn't great either, but it wasn't difficult to put back. I'll have to try this again to confirm my opinion, but it really wasn't enjoyable the first time around."

"EDIT: second bottle i opened was a bit more to what i was looking for. more lacing was left on the glass with a better head, and there was a much better hop presence"
"O: Very good beer, definitly one I will have again and highly recommend like all Sierra offerings"
"O - This has really good drinkability. The flavor is nice and it goes down really easily. I could have a few of these no problem. Overall, I think it is a really nice beer. The rye and hops compliment each other really well. I recommend trying this one out. I would definitely pick this up again."
"o - pretty good overall and enjoyable, though not my first pick in rye beers. definitely geared toward west coast ipa fans."
""
""
"Body is medium with an oily, slick texture. Carbonation level is probably right at medium as well, maybe less, but appropriate. Finish is quite dry, and the alcohol begins to show itself as it warms. This beer is drinkable enough, though, that warmth probably shouldn't be something to worry about. The rye + hops were right in my wheelhouse, so my glass will empty quickly when I drink this again."
"O: I'm not a fan of Torpedo, but am a big fan of the PA and Celebration. This was more on the offensive, Torpedo side IMO."
"O - I was excited to see a new seasonal offering from SN, as I usually enjoy their beers. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. An average rye beer that I will probably give another chance to see if my opinion improves. I like that Sierra Nevada is exploring new styles for large scale release, and hope that trend continues."
"Overall a very tasty spicy rye beer. Yet another winner from SN."
"O - Not my favorite Sierra Nevada, but an interesting change of pace."

"I really am having a hard time deciding on this beer, but I'm thinking it may be a little too rustic for me. The malts are weird, but the hops match the weirdness, I'm pretty torn on this one. It's above average, but not great. I will likely revisit just to creep the intrigue."

"I was left underwhelmed by the hops in this beer. It certainly wasn't bad but I think there are much better rye options and certainly much better pale ale options out there."

"Very nice Rye IPA. Has a bigger Rye presence than any I’ve had before with a nice dank hop note. Tasty stuff."
"All in all, still it IS Sierra Nevada, so its drinkable and not rubbish, but this could have and should have been a winner."
"Well crafted beer and a welcome seasonal, heavier body than expected but perfect for the season where you don't know what the weather will be like."
""
"This brewery never disappoints and grab some while you can and enjoy!"
"o - Overall I thought this was a very nice rye beer; one of the better ones I've had in a while. Lots of rye but still easy to drink, and not too spicey. Would like to have it again, and would pick up a 6er."
""
"Overall: quite a nice IPA. The rye is used subtly and to good effect. Kudos!"
"sorry to say the pour is my favorite part of this beer. massive three finger bone white head sits atop a clear copper colored body. excellent retention and lacing are noticed with this one. the nose detects hints of malts and hops with a little spice. taste is pretty hoppy, as expected with all s.n. beers. good citrus and pine flavors blend perfectly. a nice caramel presence is also appreciated, however it's hard to tell if the spice is from hops or rye. mouthfeel is typical of an ipa. medium to light body, good carbonation, oily and a long dry finish. the bad news that this is my fourth one from the sixer and they all have tasted soapy. i even drank them all on different days and out of different glasses. so my low rating would be duwe to the soap taste and lack of rye in the flavor profile. other than that it is a decent ipa."
"Overall its a very nice brew, think spicy rye notes seem to always blend well with hops, hard not to like this one."
""
""
"D - Another disappointment from SN. I find this one to be imbalanced, simple, and not one I'd have again. It's an average IPA at best, and I'm not sure what they were going for with the rye, but it's a miserable failure."
""
"A fresh bottle did the trick. I might add, this is a bit too dry for my liking. Rye malts pair well with some sweetness. Otherwise, this gives Founders Red's Rye PA a serious run for its money. Maybe even a notch up."
""
"I give two Schlitz about this new late winter seasonal. I'm loving this beer."
""
"Overall Impression- A Sierra Nevada classic! I knew exactly what was coming to me before I even ordered it. Great amount of rye and hops with nothing overpowering the other. I hope to see this out in bottle soon to enjoy!"
"O-Not as much rye as other Rye beers (GI Mild Winter, comes to mind) However the hop presence is great and this is a major improvement over Glissade."
""
""
""

"I love SN seasonal brews, especially Celebration. So, I saw this on the shelve at a local beer store and picked up a six-pack. Didn't know what to expect, since I've never seen or had a rye from SN. The appearance was a nice light copper, decent half inch tan foam head. Minimal lacing around the glass, but you can for sure see the hop oil drizzling down from time to time. The smell was citrusy, not as much rye as some of the others I've had (Red's Rye, Hop Rod, etc.) but it was still there. Taste was of an average IPA for me, not much alcohol bite (6.60%) decent carbonation on this one. Overall it was more of an IPA with a hint of rye, but enjoyable and worth trying none the less. When it comes to SN seasonal brews, I'll stick with the Celebration."
""
""
""
"An OK beer overall. It started out great until one place overran us."
""
"O- Quite a tasty beer from a style I am not too familiar of. Think I will enjoy this as the new seasonal."
"The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, perhaps even undercarbonated but smooth nonetheless. It works well with the session-candidate flavor profile. Overall, this is a fine beer. It pales in comparison to Founders Red's Rye when it comes to a hoppy rye beer in six-packs, but it is a tasty option that is distributed all over the country. You can't do wrong by picking up a six-pack or a 12-pack of Ruthless Rye for your next gathering. This might just be my Super Bowl beer next weekend."
"Overall another winner from Sierra Nevada. I'm just sad that it seems to have only been available for a couple of weeks here in Sarasota. IPA and rye fans, seek it out."
"O- Overall Ruthless Rye from Sierra Nevada is a great addition to their seasonal line up. It conjures up some great flavors and scents that remind me of some of my favorite IPA's, while it has a kicked up spice profile from the rye that makes it just this side of mysterious."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good, balanced Rye IPA. One of my favorite styles and this is a very good example. Will buy again."
"O: I believe Sierra Nevada really dosen't make any bad beers and this is just another example of that. Great Beer"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spot on prickly carbonation, and semi dry. Overall, this new product from Sierra Nevada is one of the more balanced examples of a rye infused IPA. Well rounded flavors and quite enjoyable."

"o- i wasn't expecting too much from this beer, but it gave me a nice surprise. this is an awesome beer, and i would buy again."
"O: Another solid line-up to the Sierra Nevada stable. I wish the appearance had a bit more oomph and the nose more of the rye, but the flavor and feel are good and for that I thank the brewers."
"Another home run by Sierra Nevada. I enjoyed this much more than last year's bock. This was affordable and full of flavor!"
"Clear and coppery with a thick yellow/beige cap. Good head retention, foamy lacing. Citrusy hop aroma, grassy and a bit spicy, slightly nutty and sugary malts. Sturdy pine resin bitterness, dry nuttiness, spicy and citrusy, a bit oily and grassy with some burnt sugar in the finish. Medium bodied, carbonation was a little creamy, light dryness from the grains, nice texture overall. A solid offering that's full of rye and hops. Recommended."
"Ruthless Rye is good, and a nice departure from most readily available IPAs; however, it's not as good as most of those, and this might not be fair, but it's no Hop Rod Rye."
""
"I am now a fan of rye beers. Ruthless Rye is inexpensive, well-balanced and, most important, tasty..."
"Verdict: A nice rye IPA from Sierra Nevada, not sure I’d say it’s better than Torpedo, but it’s got a nice mix of flavors that makes for a solid hoppy beer with a little something extra."
"Pours a clear copper with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention, and very nice lace. Aroma is of grassy hops and some sweeet malta. Body is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is a smooth balance of piney hops, and bready malts. Rich flavored, and quite enjoyable!"
"O- tasty ipa with a fair amount of rye,hops"
""
"awesome beer. recommended. i just hope they didn't replace Glissade with this. there aren't enough Helles Bocks anymore."
"Very nice IPA. The hops hide much the rye has to offer but that seems on par for the style."

"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with great head and lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine with sharp rye malt. Taste is lemon, grapefruit, and grass hops, and peppery rye (kind of salty as well). Medium body with dry finish. Very happy to have this new seasonal from Sierra Nevada."
"Tastes of those classic Sierra Nevada hops, mixed with pepper and of course rye. Complex flavor that needs to be sipped on awhile to figure out. Faily easy drinking ipa/rye brew. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"I first tasted the Ruthless Rye IPA in my home poured from a bottle into a freezing pint glass, good pour, head about a inch thick. I wasn't sure what to expect from this Rye IPA, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was hoppy, and got a smell and taste of Citrus, which in my opinion was a great blend. I've recently drank SN Torpedo and Celebration Ale, which I loved both and wasn't disappointed by the Ruthless Rye Ale at all. Excellent brew, I recommend strongly. I do think it tastes better from a cold(or very cold) pint glass."
"I enjoyed this, but I thinks Red's Rye is more to my taste, plus more drinkable"
""
""
""
"Good, not great. Maybe I like my rye in subtle doses."
"Smell devine. It reminds me of a good gin. You know how it is supposed to smell like. Hops devine is what I get in the nose once my 10 oz was poured. Taste is good. Little darker taste than a run of the mill IPA. It I a good stand alone beer but not a session beer. Sometimes higher Alc content beers still lend themselves to sessions or simply as I feel a desire for more. One is godd enough. But I usually want another SN Pale Ale"
""
"O: I enjoyed this one, seems a little lighter on the hoppy bitterness than some of the other SN IPA's, but overall is excellent and would buy again"
"O: This is good stuff; it grew on me as I worked my way down the glass. I think I like Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye a little better, but for the price ($8.89 a sixer at Olivers), this is real solid. And I think the rye makes this an appropriate Spring offering."
"Sierra Nevada did a nice job with Ruthless Rye IPA. It’s good stuff. I’m a fan of rye beer and this is definitely a good one. I think I would’ve preferred a stronger citrus hop presence, but it’s hard to find much fault. The focus is clearly on the rye and that’s not a bad thing at all. I like it. Easy recommendation."
"Overall this is a great example of a rye IPA. You cannot go wrong with this beer. Works great with spicy food. I just downed 3 with a bowl of Buffalo wings. A perfect pairing."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty beer, though I prefer Founders Red's Rye by a significant margin. Still, I would have this again."
"Picked up a bottle at Euro Market. There's a huge spicy aroma with both cracked rye and herbal citrus hops. The flavor and body are a little too light, but there's a rich grapefruit taste that comes out in the finish over mild rye bread. While I want a little more malt, Sierra Nevada did a great job balancing the rye flavor so that it's highlighted, but not too strong. Not perfect, but a pretty great rye beer."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a good beer that really showcased the rye flavors nicely. The hoppiness in it was good, but not outstanding. It was very drinkable and flavorful overall, and I really liked that the rye was a little bolder then most other Rye Ipa's. I really like rye flavors so this one worked pretty well for me."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"O: Another nice offering from SN. While I feel it lacks a bit in the aroma and flavoring hops (for an IPA), it does have a strong bitterness on the finish that goes with the rye malt, which is the center of the flavor for this beer. It might even be a bit too much, depending on how much you like a pepper/bitterness finish (I like it). Its worth a try!"
""
"Orangish-brown in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a stiff, rocky foam that never disappeared (do I drink too fast?) and left chunks of sticky foam on the glass. An interesting and complex combination of rye bread, tangy citrus and light pine hop aromas that allow just a touch of maltiness to sneak through. Medium bodied with a thick smooth feel. Much like the aromas the flavors are complex and very unique. The first flavor that hit was like the first time I bit into a rye bread seed, a bit spicy and grainy. A combination of ripe citrus and light pine hop flavors followed with a sweet caramel malt backbone fighting through. The more I try beers with rye malt the more I wonder why it isn’t more common. Finished semi-dry with a light spicy, pine hop bitterness."
""
"Nice beer from SN, but I'd take Torpedo and/or Celebration over this any day."
"D: Quite drinkable, though they could have toned down the peppery flavor to allow the hops to really come through more. Not to different from Sierra Nevada's other hoppy brews."
""
"O: I really like this especially after a month on mostly only drinking torpedo"
""
"O: Good rye ipa, but I've had better, the appearance maybe put my expectations a touch higher, still good"
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I think that the focus was a bit too much on the bittering hops, and that the rye almost takes a bit of a backseat. But it is new, and interesting, and tastes good!"
""
"Clear dark amber in color with a fairly thick off white head to start which falls somewhat quickly but laces nicely. The smell is typical sierra nevada west coast hops with a touch of something a bit different, a peppery spice likely from the rye. The taste too is much like an IPA but a bit weak in terms of the bitterness. The malt base is relatively solid and again the rye comes through as a bit of extra spice. The body is thick and nicely filling while this beer finishes with a nice lingering spiciness that tends to build as it warms and the session goes on. Overall it is similar to other sierra nevada hop focused beers but as stated earlier a bit weak on the hop bitterness (especially for an IPA). The rye carries throughout which makes it different but I think it could be better."
"Overall quite drinkable for my taste buds. I spent quite a bit of time drinking rye beer in the 90's, so this kind of takes me back. The appearance was the real highlight for me."
"O-Super nice beer. Make this baby year round please."
""
"It's funny how similar so many Sierra Nevada beers are, but just tweaked with this hop or that grain...Ruthless Rye is no different. It's got that basic S.N. vibe, but differs just enough from the pack to be worthy of its own name and label. It's hardly ruthless, and it's even a misleading name in that sense, but it is quite good and that's all that really matters, innit?"
"O: Again, different! Very tasty beer that seems to pop up in the most random places. If it comes to your small town, grab it. This is only my second rye IPA, but now I crave them. I'm on a hunt."
""
""
"Ruthless Rye is a hoppy beer with rye in the background. If you like Sierra Nevada's other hoppy beers, then you will dig this one if you like rye."
"O - A nice IPA, but it seems kinda lacking. I can't quite place what is wrong with it, but it definitely could be a bit better. I could see this being good on a hot day."
""
""
"This was a very crisp, hoppy IPA. Very drinkable."
"UPDATE!!!: I just read that this bear contains more hop oils than any other Sierra Nevada beer, and I totally agree. It smells like really dank POT. Hops are related to cannabis after all. Betcha didn't know that. BOOM!"
"O: This was a drain pour. The aromas and flavors are weird and the aftertaste keeps the nastiness going. I'd say this is a fail."
""
""
"overall: pretty abrasive version of the Rye-PA, good though"
""
"over all i give this a 4.0"
""
""
"O - I love this beer. Reminds me of the Lagunitas Sucks. Crisp, hoppy, strong citrus, delicious"
""
"Pours a gorgeous amber with thick creamy head. Nose is floral, herbal, and peppery. The rye certainly shines through nicely, giving it a pleasant hearty rye-grain taste with the assertive hop profile coming right in afterwards. Great balance and interplay of malt and hop flavors."
""
"12 oz single from ""Lifesource",Salem. OR. $1.59 I really dig the label on this one. Appearance? Slightly murky amber with a nice big frothy,thick eggshell white head. Aroma..slightly pungent hop,slight toasted cereal malt, spiciness that might be rye. Flavour again has the slightly pungent hop and a nice thick coffee/roasty malt and indeed a fair rye spice about it. OK mouth-feel though not out of the ordinary. A good beer but not stellar."
"another great sierra seasonal. pours a gorgeous deep copper color with a lively white head fluffy as can be. smells fresh hops and spicy pumpernickel bread. flavor is quite hoppy, but its butter and sweet. resiny hops. also theres the rye coming in after the hops, sturdy but light on the tongue. mouthfeel is nice too, most rye beers turn my off by sitting in my gut, but this one is down easy, mucho sessionable. love the finish here, stands up well to pickled garlic and asiogo flatbread. even though sierra is expanding, their beer is still as good as any micro operation in the country. i pray it stays that way"
"O- Wow, I'm in love. I am quite partial to rye beers as it it but this one is amazing. From presentation to taste it is both appealing and tasty. Would recommend highly."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O - Sierra Nevada strikes gold again! Behind the cutting edge band-wagon-jumping of rye beers, it's clear this beer was perfected before being unleashed into the market. Spectacular balance of aggressive hops, this review bottle went far too fast."
"O: Overall a delicious and refreshing beer. Missing Glissade? Not really."
"Overall this is a very well balanced brew, and the rye really ads some depth to the typical IPA offerings that SN pushes out."
""
"It pours a clear dark amber-brown with a creamy off white head about a finger thick that fades to a thin lacing. The aroma is more earthy then I was expecting, but I guess that's what the rye adds. There are notes of pine and citrus with spicy earthy aromas. The taste of the beer is also very earthy and spicy with a lingering bitterness on the finish. The carbonation is medium-high and perhaps bordering on too high, but is still quite drinkable due to its medium body. Good beer, glad I tried it, but wont go out of my way to seek it out again."
"On tap at the Dutch pours a nice amber capped by a foamy off white head with good retention. Nose is light pine and citrus, slight caramel malt. Taste is cutting pine and citrus underbalanced by slight malt and rye. Rye is good and refreshing with the pine. Medium bodied. Yum."
"O: Definitively earthy, herbal, spicy, hoppy and bitter. Decent Rye IPA from SN."
""
""
""
"Nice ruby appearance with a lacy head that doesn't stick around too long. Rich aroma full of earthy hops with a little bit of the rye that comes through the hops, very nice. Complex in taste, lots of hops that battle around with the rye in a good way. Lots of earthy hop notes that take over and don't let the rye flavors through as much as I'd like. A little on the thin side and doesn't last for too long. Overall really good, nice addition by SN."
""
"O: Another solid offering from SN. The Rye gives the classic West Coast IPA an interesting flavoring. Will drink again."
""
"A great beer from SN. So glad they replaced Glissade with this. Not as hoppy as the top Rye Beers, but just as good IMO. Glad I invested in a 6 pack. If it was year round I would definitely keep this regularly stocked in my fridge."
""
"Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a dark copper amber, half finger off-white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of herbal hops, a hint of citrus and light fruit. Interesting rich flavor of sweet malt and rye with citrus, a slight sourness and earthiness, probably from the rye. Sharp pleasant finish of hops and rye. I liked this flavor combination quite a bit. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Nicely done rye beer."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer and I think it can hang with the likes of Hop Rod Rye."
"O: I was expecting more from this, it's not very well balanced, but thankfully it is priced decently. Even so, I won't be buying it again, Hop Rod is a much better option."
""
""
""
"It will be interesting to see if this one becomes a ""keeper"" or not."
"Overall, Ruthless Rye gives us another quality brew from the great brewers at Sierra. Wasn't a big fan of Glissade myself so I'll happily take this as a replacement."
""
"O - I like this beer and I believe it will be well received in the brew pubs and stores all over. I am glad I came across this beer because this 12 pack was the last of this beer in the store."
"O - More intense on the rye the other similar brews. Quite spicy but well balanced, refreshing. definitely solid."
"Quite dry in the mouthfeel, this beer offers a blend of crispness in the front and smoothness from middle to lingering finish with neither taking preference."
""
"Pours orange in color with an off-white head. Starts off with a good citrus hop aroma. Lots of grapefruit and orange, just a bit of sweet malt. There is some nice rye and pine aroma, too. The flavor is a bit maltose than expected. Moderate sweetness with lots of rye, pine, and floral hops. Citrus peel adds a touch more bitterness. Medium body and carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - An interesting IPA to say the least. Sadly, I'm missing that hop profile that I so look forward to in a good IPA. Glad I tried it, but will not buy again."
""
"Overall a nice Rye IPA"
"Maybe the most rye-forward beer I've had thus far, not overtaken by the hops like some rye beers. It's not the greatest but it was good, wouldn't mind having it again, easy drinking."
"This is a good beer, and it uses rye very well. The hops compliment the smooth rye character nicely. For the price, I'll buy a lot of 12-packs of this."
"O- A really nice beer, very happy I picked up a six pack. Pretty much what you would expect from Sierra Nevada, definitely will pick this up again."
"As a touch of honey-like sweetness emerges, it becomes very gulpable. It's best to have another Ruthless Rye ready."
""
""
""
"Another slam dunk from Sierra. Such an engaging, but drinkable beer. At first I expected more hop character in the nose, as is typical with Sierra. But, the subltety of the hops really let the rye flavor shine. I find that some rye beers are overwhelming in the rye flavor. This was just enough to keep the beer interesting, but not too much to make it overwhelming. Spicy, but drinkable. Yeah Sierra!"

"Great debut for a great beer. I look forward to having this every year."

"Nice job SN, you done good."

"Overall, this is pleasant and tasty as a rye beer gets. What I really like about this beer is that it introduces the rye flavor to noobs and gets them prepared for what rye can offer to any style of brew. An interesting taste."
"Overall a nice refreshing IPA, another solid beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Not the most complex beer in the world, but the rye spices give what is a really good IPA that added umph that makes this beer very enjoyable. Definitely hop foraward and resiny, but the malts stand their own to make for a really well done beer. Worth the buy."
"Overall: a nice addition to SN's lineup. Rye in an IPA or PA makes a beer that much better. Enjoying more in the near future."
"overall - while i did enjoy this offering over SN last couple spring offerings(esb & glissade) i just do not see this sticking around more then maybe another year or two - there just isnt enough difference from their other ipas"
"The body was pumpkin colored, clear, and formed a two plus finger thick head, domed above the rim of the pint glass. The aroma was typical West Coast IPA with grapefruit, and pine, but with a touch of earthy mustiness. The taste was very citric off the bat, providing a grapefruit and tangerine blast. The rye touch was light and presented itself as a minty, herbal presence. The body was medium dense, and the finish was creamy, with a lingering herbal note. Very easy to drink beer."
"Enjoyed. Highly!"
"Overall, this is a grain-lover's beer, with great balance and some real bite."
""
"O- Rye beers aren't really my thing but this is quite enjoyable."
"Overall: i wasn't a fan at first, but I think it was because it was the first ale that I had that was brewed with rye. after having gone threw the six-pack, I would buy it again."
"Similar flavors, ample hop bitterness and complex bready malt sweetness. Finishes dry and bitter, almost a little bit chalky. Hint of citrus rind in there, that somehow seemed more prevalent in bottles sampled last week. It's got some nice malt complexity, and light lingering hop flavors of citrus and greenery. Overall it's good, would drink again but haven't seen it around on tap anywhere yet."
"Overall – Another solid beer from SN. Honestly wish it was a bit more bitter/hoppy."
"Although I tend not to be a huge Rye beer fan, this one is hoppy enough to keep my interest. Though still unlikely I'd purchase this one ahead of all time favorites Torpedo and/or SNPA"

"Recommended."

"M - Good carbonation, decent mouthfeel, but a thin beer with little substance to it."

"Served from bottle into a mug. Poured yellow-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, pine resin, spices, and subtle fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, spices, pine, pine hop, citrus hop, and subtle wheat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This brew definitely took on both the characteristics of a rye beer and an IPA. It was quite enjoyable and fairly easy to drink. A definite must try if you are a fan of hoppy and spicy brews."
""
"Fresh bottle from the Pizza Port bottle store. Hoppy aroma. Copper body with three-eighths of an inch of retained white head. An ale with rye that hits the spot. Lacy, fresh, session-able, citrus, pepper, fruit and lots of rye. A good hoppiness and edgy. Good drinkability."
"Overall I like this one a lot and will buy more; sad it replaces the SN Glissade golden bock though, as I liked that one as well...a tasty new brew that I will enjoy drinking often."
"O: Overall a very solid beer. I really enjoy Rye beers and definitely enjoyed this one. I definitely like the flavor profile of this beer, and how it encompassed the hops and malts very nicely. This beer was another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"D - There's a bit too much rye here and not quite enough IPA, at least for my tastes. I think I liked the Widmer a tick better, which came as a surprise."
""
""
""
"This is a top notch ale from a brewery that never lets you down. I'm just wondering, what if this was a hard to find, special release? If Three Floyds was the name on it I bet the rating would be sky high. Just imagine if your local brewery did something like this. You would be pretty amazed. But this is par for the course for Sierra Nevada and I suppose most folks will just think it's decent. As for me, I'm going to drink alot of this while it's available..."
""
""
"Overall very tasty and extremely sessionable for a beer nearing the 7% mark. The rye is slightly less noticeable than say Nelson IPA (Alpine Brewing) or Reef Rye (Ballast Point), but still there and tasty, pushing this IPA into a different class than a standard West Coast IPA. Definitely something different yet still carrying that signature flavor that makes Sierra Nevada one of the most consistently quality produced ales in the game."
""
"O: another great seasonal from SN. they remain one of my favorite breweries and this is an excellent addition to their seasonal line-up"

"O: Rye IPA's are usually a hit or miss with me. With that said, this hits me right in the middle. Nothing too bold, but does deliver some distinct flavors not commonly found in hoppy beers (which I like). A try it beer. Cheers!"

"Overall-whenever a rye beer is on a beer list, I gravitate towards it, I like this beer and will seek it out again, real drinability, with the quality I have come to expect from a SN, very simalar to their pale ale but with the rye flavor coming through."
"O - I'm not sold on this one. I'm usually a fan of Sierra Nevada. It doesn't quite stack up to the other rye beers I have had."
"Another solid pale ale offering from Sierra Nevada. They really know what they do best and it shows in their brews."
""
""
"Overall impression: A nicely done, classically SN rye IPA. All I would expect from SN's version of a rye beer. Plenty hoppy with nice malt accents to keep it interesting and round out the flavor profile. Well done."
""
"Overall: While not quite the taste onslaught of some other Rye IPAs (such as Founders Red Rye and the Summit India Rye Ale from two years back), this is extremely well balanced and immensely drinkable. The best ""Spring"" seasonal from Sierra Nevada yet."
"O - Overall, this was a very nice brew. If I understand correctly, this replaces Glissade as their spring seasonal, which is fine with me. Also, the artwork on the bottle is killer."
"I was reluctant to buy this at first as rye isn't too popular in the south for brew, bread, or liqueurs, but an inner voice kept up and I decided to try it. This beer broke my expectations. I expected the hops bitterness and the sourness of the rye to clash, but it didn't. I like IPA, and this beer doesn't quite deserve the moniker. I do like and recommend this beer. It's a cold day and this spicy beer made it more tolerable."
"Medium body, with ample carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Not a great deal of rye character. While this beer is good, it is very similar to several other SN beers."
"Amber in color with dense off-white head, lots of carbonation and decent head retention. Spicy, pine sap hops aroma with the characteristic sharpness of rye. Rather tame hoppiness for an IPA. Thankfully much more hops come through in the flavor with much stronger, more bitter pine notes and a medium to full body with moderate sweetness. It leaves a lingering, savory rye flavor on the tongue."

"O: Having faith in Sierra Nevada, I had high expectations for this beer. It wasn't as good as I had hoped, but I wouldn't turn it down if I had the opportunity to drink it again."

"O – It makes me happy that Sierra Nevada can produce good, affordable craft brews that can be found everywhere."
"Overall a nice new offering from these guys. Glad to see a widely available rye beer cause I love the stuff."
"Overall this beer represents better as a Rye Beer than an IPA, and I gather that's the intent given the tiny font of IPA on the label. Hop aromas do evolve and expand with warming but the Rye remains in charge."

"Poured in to a pint glass. Wow, this looks fantastic. Thick, creamy white head with a generous amount of sticky lacing that just clings to the glass. The beer itself is a cooper/burgundy hue, with some fine bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The aroma is quite complex. Initially, I’m struck by the hop profile. Nice, grapefruit notes, followed quickly by a strong, yet balanced rye scent. As it warms, more tropical fruit notes make their presence known, and a caramel sweetness begins to take over. At times, the beer seems to take on a sweet tartness (kind of like the candy). As the beer approaches room temperature, it begins to take on a funky, musty, aroma. Maybe also a touch of simcoe like aroma as well. The taste, is crisp, with a strong hop punch at the start. Fresh hops on the tongue, followed by a lingering, drying bitterness. The rye also balances the brew nicely, providing more of a balance to the aggressive hoping. The abv is well concealed. Very nice. The mouth feel is medium bodied. Overall, this beer is a must try for the IPA lover. If you’re not a fan f Rye beers, give this a try, it may change your mind."
"o-Overall this bad boy is a welcome addition. I love it and with this change of the seasonal I was happy. I have found some of the recent seasonal changes have been somewhat lackluster IMO."
""
"Overall this a good beer. Nice flavor and aroma. Mouthfeel was a little to leathery for my tastes."

"Overall: This beer is incredible for the $11.50/12 pk. The design on the bottle, the Sierra Nevada name, the price, and the fact this was right in the entryway made this the easiest trip to the liquor store ever."

"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice hop notes, and some rye. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some hoppyness, and some rye. Medium body, with a nice bitter/dry finish. Another very tasty brew from SN, but still very similar as their IPAs."

"O: I liked this alot. It was not overpowering in any one area. I would have like a bit more aroma, the smell seemed subdued, almost too mellow, it just didnt grab me. But again, this was a great beer, and I would totally drink it again."

"A great mouthfeel and very easy to drink, I like this one muchly and I'll be drinking this often. Well done, Sierra Nevada!"

"Very solid, will keep eye out for twelve packs."

"Overall- Gotta say I really liked this beer, pleasantly surprised how much I liked it, very refreshing unique IPA style. Well done Sierra Nevada, well done."
"Pours a light brown color, with 3/4 inch of dense head in my Sierra Nevada hop glass. Head recedes to a quarter inch of small dense bubbles. Aroma is of rye, a bit of peppery spice, and pine. Taste starts smooth, with the rye flavor. It glides across the tongue until I get to the strong pine hops. As I taste the pine hops I get a little jolt in my soft palate, a twinge of pepper, then it's back to the hop flavors, notably the citrus hops. Aftertaste is of the rye and pepper. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation is passive. This is a really solid beer, the heavy smoothness make it nice for the colder months, but it isn't lacking any hops."
"O: Sierra Nevada has knocked another one out of the part. This beer is so good and I love how different this beer is from their others. The flavors are so unique and just explode on the palate. Just amazing!"
"Overall: A very good new add to Sierra Nevada's lineup. Very spicy and bitter, so much so that it seems like a double IPA. That is a good thing to me."
""
""
""
"I like this but something about the combination of flavors just doesn't really work. The hops and rye seem bit too spicy or sharp somehow."

"Medium-bodied. Enough carbonation. Solid beer overall."

"O: Overall I would drink this over and over again, very satisfying and refreshing ."
"O - A good rye beer. Too bitter to be a regular for me, but good nonetheless"
"O: A good beer from Sierra Nevada, better than Glissade for sure, something to tide one over until Bigfoot hits."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 47 degrees. Pours a translucent amber with a frothy, 1.5 inch cream-colored head that eventually settles into a thin consistent skim. Creamy, textured bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat forward - earthy/herbal/peppery/spicy with just a trace of citrus. Taste follows nose - this beer, has a very prominent herbal/spicy character almost akin to a rustic bread and a farmhouse cheese pairing. Once the spice resides, a residual biscuity quality expresses itself, finishing with a slightly bitter/earthy hops presence. Mouthfeel is very pleasant; medium-light in body with a lively, almost bright carbonation and just a touch of acidity. Overall, I think this is an interesting take on the style; something of an American IPA/Rye beer hybrid. Flavors are distinct and complex, albeit there is not much in the way of a hops presence. Also, I find that one in a sitting is enough in that the flavors are a bit too assertive for prolonged consumption. That said, I'm happy to see a major craft brewer take on a Rye beer - nice job SN."

""
"Pours a crystal clear golden copper color with a good sized white head that persists and leaves much lace on the way down. Smells of garlic, green onion, and pepper mostly. There's a faint bready malt down there somewhere, but this one is all hops. Taste is more garlic and onion with a bit of spice and pepper. Little to no malt to be found. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice rye IPA but a bit vegetative for my tastes. I could drink these, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek these."
"My crystal ball is cloudy on whether this will go over big or not, so maybe spring 2012 will be your only chance to try this. I enjoyed mine with Wildspitz cheese, green olives and a baguette. I took a gamble and it worked out."

"Overall - A good, not great beer. I really enjoy it and glad i picked up a 12 pack and easily would do it again, i love sierra nevada."

"O- Im not huge into the rye beers as some, but this is good. Its not as good as the Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye, but I would drink this and the Founders Red's Rye PA again. Sierra Nevada knows how to make good beers...another winner by them."

"This a good beer, but not a great beer. I wanted it to excel in every way, but it just measured up to other rye beers out there."
"D - 6.6 Abv makes this a two-pinter, or a great. It's very tasty, digestible, and easy to drink. Score SN!"

"As a RYE IPA, it definitely delivers. This brew is great addition to any hop lovers or those whisky drinkers who are looking for a robust beer."
"VERY GOOD, GET SOME!"

"I was looking forward to this Rye IPA from SN. Don't get me worn, this is not a poor IPA but it doesn't stand up to other widely available IPAs. I followed this one with a Sweetwater IPA just to confirm my impressions. I would go with Sweetwater any day. The rest of the sixes is in the fridge and will be enjoyed but I won't go for a repeat."
"The flavor profile is nicely balanced, with a well-integrated mix of citrus hops and chewy, spicy rye. An unusual combination, but this works beautifully. This is one I may have to purchase again!"
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good Rye Beer and it lives up to being labeled as a Rye IPA. This beer was heavy on the rye but it also had a lot of hops and I thought that added great balance and it helped draw some attention away from all that rye. I thought this beer had slightly above average drinkability, I might be down to have another one but after that I think the pretty intense flavors would start to wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, to me this beer was firing on all cylinders. What I liked least about this beer was that weird burnt plastic aroma, it wasn't that bad but it seemed like the only thing that was slightly out of place in this beer. I will for sure buy this beer again but to me this is a one a night kind of beer so a twelve pack may be too much, but I think a six pack would be just enough. If you are a Rye Beer fan I highly recommend this beer, but if you are a big IPA fan you may find the rye a little too dominating. This beer was a nice surprise from Sierra Nevada, there wasn't much hype surrounding this new release, but that may have been a good thing since highly hyped beers go within a day or two in my neck of the woods. The only other Rye Beer I have reviewed was Rich's Rye from Short's and I liked this beer much more, the hops complimented the Rye much more then it did in Rich's Rye, so this makes Ruthless Rye my favorite Rye Beer to date, good job Sierra Nevada this was one good Rye Beer is a welcomed addition to their solid lineup."
"O- I believe this is my first rye based beer and it is a noticeable difference. The word ""earthy"" seemed to be used a lot in other reviews, but it definitely is dead on. Essentially a different take on their pale ale and torpedo, Ruthless is a solid beer but may be slightly polarizing with the rye flavor."
"O: This is a flavorful, well-balanced beer, but the rye flavor was subdued. Other than that, it drank like a mild session beer with added character. I know what Sierra Nevada can do with IPAs, and this is a great testament to that spirit."
"I'm a sucker for rye, and this one has an abundance of it. The other flavors play a second fiddle and provide for balance which is all I really need. Medium bodied nice mouthfeel. I really enjoy this beer. A good addition to the sierra line up."
"O: While I like certain elements very much, there's just that elusive spot-on, unmistakable home run that, well, Chimay (blue) or La Fin Du Monde provide for its style. That being said, this is an above average beer. No, its bona fide."
""
"Malt Character! You will rarely find an IPA with this malt presence, with a very full mouthfeel and insane lacing. It goes very well with the Rye PA style... the roasted earthy flavors that rye gives serve to bring it into some territory that stouts and browns typically occupy. These are malty types, so I think that this might be what makes a malty IPA click- the rye. A delicious, almost sessionable RIPA"
"O- A tasty well rounded beer. The nose is great and everything else is pretty well done."
"pours a reddish amber with an off-white head that holds and leaves rings of very pretty lace. nose is flowery whole-cone hops that smell to me like lemon flowers (if there was such a thing), a touch of rye and a hint of caramel. can't get over how real, pretty and lemony/citrusy the hop character is. taste is just what the nose led me to believe. citrusy hops with a bit of peppery rye flavor riding on a backbone of soft caramel. very well balanced and nicely done. medium body that isn't sweet and had no abd aftertastes, just maybe wished it was a tad drier. overall, another very very fine, accessible brew from sierra nevada."
""
"Overall: This is a really good rye beer. The spice, hops, and malt work together very well. I hope they continue to make this beer. I would definitely have more."
"O: This is a tasty beer and I have no complaints, other than wishing there had been a little more to the head. One of the driest rye beers I have had. Definitely worth a try."
"O: Overly hoppy, needs a little bottle aging to be enjoyable. I like Rye Squared by Terrapin better."
""
"An excellent rye-forward beer that has plenty of hop bitterness/pine/spice to make it interesting the whole time. Well done, which is not surprising, as it is SN."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It pours out a nice orange copper collor and settles with a nice size white head on top that measures roughly an 1"". The smell is of nice citrus hops but fairly mild. Slight bready aromas come through as well. Big Rye taste. it reminds me a lot of of Hop Rod Rye from Bear Republic. Man, I sure wish this stuff was around in the bottle when I used to stumble through the streets of Chico with a 6'er of Bigfoot, it might have been a little easier on me, but what's the fun in that? Solid beer, I tip my hat to SN once again."
"I do believe this has become my favorite rye beer, a spot formerly held by Great Divide Hoss. They were not shy with the rye! Another great beer from Sierra Nevada (though I will miss Glissade)."
""
""
""
"This is just another solid IPA from Sierra Nevada. The rye doesn't add much but enough to be noticeable. I prefer this as the spring beer versus their previous offerings, but I don't think it holds up to the other IPA offerings they have throughout the year."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a clear medium copper an one-finger off-white head along with lacing that lasts well throughout. Aroma is quite spicy like a rye beer should be and Earthy/piny hops are also present creating a nice balance. Flavor suggests a spicy rye taste and mild hops. Some bitterness is present throughout with piny hop flavors. Some caramel malt is there is well to prop up the hops. Medium mouthfeel and decent carbonation throughout. Quite an average but interesting rye-inspired IPA brew."
"O: It's Sierra Nevada. A Rye IPA done with class. Try it, it's beautiful!"
" Overall I love a good rye and this has it all -the finesse and flavor that coexist in a hoppy rye beer. It is smooth enough to be drinkable and bold enough to excite the palate, Kudos to Sierra Nevada."
"DOA"
"Upon pouring this beer left a fingers worth of a off white head and had reasonably good lacing. The color of this beer was perplexing, from different angles it had very different and unique colors. From table level it looked mahogany, from over top it looked slightly red and from an angle it looked more amber in color. Well, whatever color is was it had a beautiful aroma to it. Strong peppery notes mixed very well with sweet citrusy hop notes. From the first sip you can tell you're drinking a rye beer; the spiciness of the rye added a big kick to the malt and worked very well with this beers hop imparted bitterness. This beer finished very clean and dry on the palate, which left you wanting more."
"Overall I think this beer stands up to what ever this brewery has to offer. Drink it while you can."
"It's a good beer and fills in a gap left by the Anniversary Ale. I wouldn't hesitate to bring it to a party, but I won't be stocking it at home for myself. The taste just doesn't quite live up to the aroma."
"Bottle code 135011147. Taste is slightly spicy with a nice hop citrus presence. Pretty much delivers completely on the promise that is made on the bottle. Normally I don't put too much attention to the label as it is normally the liquid that matters the most but I really, really love the way that this label (and Celebration does this for me too) puts you in another place and transcends you before you even take the first sip. Genius. As for the liquid...crisp, clean, hoppy, spicy, delicious. It's from Sierra Nevada, what did you expect?"
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent reddish brown color with a half inch of head. Tons of lacing. Good amount of hops in the nose. Citrusy and floral with some grains. Taste is bitter hops with a floral finish. Some breadiness and grains. Not really getting much citrus like I did with the aroma, although there is some grapefruit. A bit of caramel as well but this beer is dominated by hops and bitterness. Big surprise, Sierra Nevada has made another great beer."

"I like this one; it's not super hoppy, but it allows the malt to show itself."

"Very impressed with this rye ale from Sierra Nevada. I haven't had much experience with rye ales at the time of writing this review , but i must say this one has to be one of my Favorites so far. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass and noticed a nice creamy head that leaves a wonderful lacing on the glass while drinking. The Two flavors that stood out the most to me were white pepper and grapefruit. The carbonation is perfect and has a great mouth texture. Can't go wrong with this Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye !!"
""
"O- This is a really good Pale Ale. It happens to also have a little rye in it. I would put the flavor profile somewhere between SA Pale Ale and Torpedo IPA. More resinous, piney hops than the Pale but not quite as in-your-face as Torpedo. Still has the similar hop-cocktail flavor of both, perhaps a similar mix of hops is used in all 3. The rye adds a touch of complexity but doesn't overpower the hops. This beer is made in the Sierra Nevada fashion; perfect amount of hoppiness and sweet malts as well as drinkability. Not bad for $7.99, either. Seek it out."
""
"The flavor focuses a bit too much on the rye and accompanying spice. Hop flavor is there, but comes through more as bitterness in the finish. Medium body and just a bit chewy. Dry and bitter. Drinkable, but probably not in large quantities. While I enjoy this one, it's not something I'd want to drink a bunch of, a la SNPA."
"O - Another great IPA from Sierra Nevada. BUY IT!"
"3.5 D: Tasty beer. I'm a big fan of rye and I like the smokiness that this beer has. It's a good combination."
"O: One of my favorite styles, I haven't had a bad rye beer...yet. Recommend picking this up."
""
"Broke one of these open to enjoy whilst producing a homebrew of my own. Pouring into a pint glass reveals a darker amber liquid, perfectly clear, with a small bubbly off-white head that recedes to a small ringlet. Very little carbonation to be seen. Aroma is grainy with a pronounced crisp hop scent. Taste is grainy, a bit skunky I think, but well within the threshold of tolerance, hop bitterness--pine and citrus notes--subdued malts, and a definite bready rye quality that comes in at least mid-palate. Quite bitter in the aftertaste; grapefruit pith. Fairly easy to drink. Pretty nice overall."
"Poured into a nonic a clear rich copper/bronze with a large blooming head that left a few broken rings of lace behind as it settled slowly.Not as assertive in the nose as I expected,it does have a decent shot of grapefruit-like hop aromas with some mild rye spice.Much fuller flavors with a nice mix of nutty malt mixed with spicy rye and a healthy dose of citric hops,well rounded.A very solid rye offering from SN wich frakly I expected,I could drink this all day."

"Poured into strait pint glass. Dark reddish brown with an orange glow. Awesome nose, lots of spice and rye. Taste has an admirable balance, not too bitter, the raw rye flavor shines through, a bit of sourness, cranberry. What a solid, drinkable brew. Not harsh, smooth, incredibly drinkable"

"Overall much better than I thought it'd be. I find a lot Sierra Nevada brews to be underwhelming. This one was much more impressive...as far as rye ipas go tho, I still haven't found anything that beats Red's Rye from Founder's and Cane and Ebel from Two Brothers."
""
"Overall, a really nicely done rye brew. I think I like the styles that lean a little more to the rye side, but this piney SN take is pretty damn good. The peppery spice mingling with the tart red grapefruit on the finish really makes it for me."
""
""
"O: another winner from Sierra Nevada. For the value, you can't really do much better if you are shopping for a hearty rye brew."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled late Dec 2011. This pours a slightly dark amber, large foamy tan head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of hops, pine, a little caramel and some rye. The feel Is medium. The taste is great a nice bitterness, an earthy nice after taste, love it."
""
"O: It is not a bad beer, but I don't feel that it is particularly well balanced. The carbonation is too high and leads to a bloated feeling pretty quick. There are lots of other IPAs I'd prefer."
"Notes: It's not a bad beer, though not anywhere close to the best rye beers. To tell the truth, I'd much prefer to have glissade back as the spring seasonal. Not sure why they made the decision to replace it, especially with something more on the radical side. I'm not sure this beer will be as widely appealing."
"O= Overall I enjoyed this beer wasn't to much to it but it still was a great beer and really enjoyed it."
""
"Pours a clear copper with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, and some herbal/pine hops. Taste is of malt and spicy/peppery rye up front with some very herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is an assertive spicy rye and herbal hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good rye beer with a very nice spicy and peppery flavor that I am enjoying. An awesome label to boot."
"O: A rather mild, but very drinkable, rye beer. Clean and crisp, with a nice balance of caramel malts, rye, and hop bitterness."
"Medium mouthfeel and no notice of the alcohol at all. This is another excellent offering from SN. Not sure is this will be a regular, but I hope so. I'll have it again."
"Nice copper shade, head dissipates rather quickly but leaves lacey skin of foam crisp finish, Rye is definitely there good carbonation didnt finish growlerill next day. Not sure about the ""Ruthless"" part but would definitely drink again given the opportunity."
"O- Decent for a rye IPA but nothing exceptional. This is what I have come to expect from SN...beers that are good but nothing special and don't tend to push the envelope, not that that is a bad thing but it just doesn't set them apart"
"Overall I found this to be a very enjoyable rye beer that goes down easily. It's no Red's Rye, but it is a beer that a would totally pick up a six pack of if I was in the mood for a rye beer."

"Again, a solid beer from Sierra Nevada. nothing out of line for the style, but a solid (very solid) example of a rye IPA. not as hoppy as many others of the style, with more of a rye flavor that works well."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with an off-white head. The rye really stands out in the aroma, but there is also a little bit of pine and some biscuit malt notes. The flavor also has a lot of rye in it. I also get some orange and pine from the hops, as well as a little bit of biscuit and bread from the malt which keeps the bitterness low to medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a nice burnt ruby red, crystal clear with a 2 finger frothy foam that thins to a slimy sticky film left all over the glass. First on the nose, the citrus from the hops grapefruit, mango, peaches, then the rye kicks in with a perfect bready balance. Caraway seeds soaked in grapefruit juice is what i keep getting when i stick my nose in, impressed. The mouth is much the same very bready from the rye, and the piny, citrus hops just fill the body and the finish, a slight amount of booze sneaking its way in too. Medium bodied, semi tart/bitter, tons of fruit and rye characters throughout, finishes dry and begging for more. This beer was quite impressive for me i have to admit, and has definitely changed the way i see rye beers, hope they make this a regular seasonal."
""
"D - A very nice brew here... Quite quaffable... The rye adds very nice depth and complexity to the textbook Sierra Nevada hoppiness... I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting... I will gladly invest in this brew in the future and highly everyone check out this very nice addition to the Sierra Nevada stable of fine brews..."

"Because Sierra Nevada is so widely available and so affordable it's easy to forget they make some of the best damn beer around."

"Overall a very nice beer from Sierra Nevada. One I will definitely pick up more of."
"O: Not as much of a peppery kick as I was hoping nor as hoppy as I was expecting. Nice first go around, Sierra Nevada, but next time add a dash more of everything."
"O: A nice, refreshing brew. Although its a nice changeup from the standard IPA, I would have enjoyed a little more hoppy characteristics"
"The body was nicely full, fuller than typical for an IPA, but still wasn't heavy or filling. Drinkability was good, I'll be having a couple when it goes on tap tomorrow. Overall, a pretty nice beer. Worth trying when you see it."
"O- Very solid brew. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. A good twist on an IPA."
"Taste-Spicy rye, big, bold hops, rather clean, dry finish. Nice flavor and balance, cries out for a spicy food match. Pepper steak or Teriaki would do nicely. Hop-head recommended."
"O - I was a little disappointed to learn that SN was dropping Glissade as their spring seasonal while releasing yet another IPA to take its place. IPAs are wonderful, but I liked the change of pace golden bock. While all their IPAs are indeed very good, Glissade gave me a different style. However After experiencing this I can say that this may be their best IPA outside the Harvest ales and Estate ale. I'll definitely miss the Glissade this year, but I welcome this Ruthless Rye IPA with open arms. Very tasty."
"I like this. It's not the best but I can see myself drinking it in place of some other micro."
"This is a beer for food. Chili, Nachos, BBQ, even a Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries. Plenty of flavor and character to work well with intense flavors."

"Pours a clear coppery amber, moderate cap of khaki tinted head, decent retention and sticky lacing. Scent brings notes of pine and citrus to the front, followed by a decent spice, notes of lightly sweet malt and a mineral like quality. Taste leads with a moderate splash of pine and citrus, fairly robust spice notes from the rye, minimal notes of malt. Very dry finish, slightly heavy on the palate, fuller side of medium bodied. A decent offering from Sierra that like mostly everything else they make is quite drinkable."

"O- Another excellent seasonal from SN, This is similar to their Torpedo but with a darker feel to it."

"Tons of rye to the nose. Immediately, I got hops on the palate. Then the rye followed through, lots of it, by the bottom of the glass thats what I was getting. The mouthfeel felt really good to me, with ample carbonation. A little too much rye for me by the end, but overall a very good offering from Sierra Nevada."
""
"Amber-brown with a slight white head that sticks to the glass. The smell is really piney with slight citrus notes. I also smell spearmint. The taste has piney hops and finishes nice and dry. It is naturally spicy. It passes by quickly. It has that familiar Sierra Nevada taste. Maybe from the yeast? Mouthfeel is light, dry and nicely carbonated. Overall, a tasty brew that finishes nice and clean. Love the label!"

"D - This really pales in comparison to Jester King's offering. The nose is extremely subtle and the taste doesn't offer a whole lot of interesting notes of spice, which was sort of the whole point of rye, right?"

"O - A quality rye IPA. Nothing spectacular but certainly representative of the characteristics of rye beers with no flaws to speak of. Definitely very drinkable, but maybe a little undeserving of the name ""Ruthless."" Still I'd recommend."
"Less refined and more potent than I was expectiving from Sierra Nevada. The rye is allowed to shine through in an unadulterated manner. Surprised to see purity of ingredients win out (if only slightly) over balance, making for a more novel if not daring brew than you might anticipate."
"overall it's a good beer but not superb."
"Overall pretty good tasting beer here."
"Overall: I like rye beers, and this one delivers on the big rye flavor. A good ABV for the style makes this a very easy beer to session with when I'm in the mood for a rye beer. Another winner from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, this was a nice beer but rather ordinary. I want more rye or more hops or something. It basically tastes like their standard pale ale or IPA with a little rye."
"The beer is clear and copper hued with a thick, lasting off white head that coats the pint glass with lacing. The aroma brings hops, pine, bread. Very bitter with lots of pine flavor. Hops are the initial flavor, followed by a robust malt bill. This is what I would consider to be a balanced IPA. This is typically not my preference for the style, but this brew is well done. Medium bodied. The aftertaste offers pine and rye bread. Overall, pretty good. Worth a try."
"All around great beer, but I was sad to see it replace Glissade. I suppose hops are in."
"O- I enjoyed this one as a good change up from a typical IPA. I'm a fan of rye whisky and I think the spiciness of this beer makes for an interesting drink. Bitterness is controlled well."
"This is a nice Rye IPA. I have had three of these, and I like it much better with each one. The flavors seemed a little muted in the first bottle, maybe my palate just needed to acclimate. Nice job, Sierra."

"If they keep this one around it should introduce new generations to rye beers. This is interesting enough to be a must-try beer, whether or not it turns out to be your idea of a rye. I think the mark of a good beer is one that reveals complexity as you savor it. I found myself raising the score as I sipped."

"Tasty, sessionable, and solid, but not a mindblower."
"Medium bodied with a good feel for carbonation. Very easy to drink and the alcohol doesn't come off as being harsh. Another great selection to Sierra Nevada."

"Very nice rye beer, and even a nice ipa while it's at it"
"Often with rye beers I have tried, the rye is not well represented, almost as if an after thought by the brewer. In this instance, the rye is prominently displayed in the flavor without becoming overbalanced. This dry and refreshing ale is dangerously drinkable at 6.6 ABV. I miss Glissade Bock, but I am very pleased with this one."
""
"Overall: This is my first 12 oz. bottle from a 12 pack. I have great respect for SN, but not sure this rye IPA is for me. I hope it grows on me."
""
""
""
"Definitely an interesting IPA, though I think there could be even more hop flavor while still retaining the rye character."
""
"overall I'm really liking this rye IPA... about to have 3 or 4 more and watch the brady/tebow bowl tonight :) super easy to drink for sure. similar to the ""rye hopper"" I tried from french broad a few weeks ago, but not as sweet... both excellent brews though. this is priced very reasonably here in NC ($8.99 for a 6er). I'll definitely buy this one again. well done Sierra."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 135012120. Sampled on January 14, 2012. It is an attractive looking beer with its medium to dark amber tone and foaming beige head. Hops are the first aroma on the nose followed by grains and a little citrus. The body falls into the medium range. The taste is really hopped up with grains and rye playing around with the palate and a sopur note of something akin to pineapple. It ends clean and crisp."
"Sierra’s new brew is a rye pale ale that’s a caramel-amber color with a billowy white foam topping. Its aroma is lightly hopped with grapefruit and some rye spice coming through. Full-flavored body with hops making their grand entry midpoint and tapering into a nice hoppy, resiny finish balanced by that good rye zestiness. I can’t complain that this one is going to be just about everywhere Sierra is. Try it."
"O: This beer has a few flaws, but the superb taste makes up for it my opinion. With some work in the other aspects, this could definitely become something special."
""
"Another solid beer from Sierra Nevada. The flavor was just a slight letdown compared to the great rye IPAs."
"I love rye ales and I love Sierra Nevada so it's no surprise this hits the spot. My only complaint is the nose is rather muted."
"I'll be ordering this one again for sure. So nice to see such a flavorful, hoppy beer in such a (relatively) low alcohol beer."
""
""
"O – Dug it. Easy to put down a few. Great flavors that compliment each other very well. If you like rye beer this is one to try."

"Rocky textured foaming tan head leaves only gas and beer residue between an inch of air and glass known as head space, it's beautiful. Color wise bright ruby copper colored beer we need in this post holiday recovery mode for everybody. After drinking spiced ales with cinnamon, honey, and all spice for a month and a half, I fully praise Sierra Nevada for releasing this beer. Aroma has hints of pine and citrus with a spicy rye layer that definitely adds a layer of complexity to the mix. Flavor hits with a clashing layer of malt/rye versus earthy/pine hops, pretty intense here no bias noted, I'm a lover of both malts and hops. Easy to drink well balanced between the waves of piney/citrus hops and spicy rye malt, moderate carbonation slick oily hop textures going on. Overall a welcomed seasonal to mix up the ever changing lineup of Sierra Nevada, I'll be drinking more of this."
"O: Enjoyable beer. If it weren't for Hopslam taking up my immediate budget I'd pick up a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great drinkable beer. It doesn't have as much rye as some of the other Rye IPAs and it uses the traditional Sierra Nevada hops that have made their beers famous. Its a very dependable beer from a very dependable company. I would recommend this beer to anyone. Especially those wanting another good IPA that isn't hard to find."
"Beer is medium in body with a mildly dry finish, moderate bitterness and a grainy aftertaste. The lead off is this mild spiciness from the malt and this nice body that fills out to a good hop presence, the aftertaste totally takes me out of the beer though. Not a fan of that. Otherwise it is a fine little IPA / rye beer."
""
""
"O- For the price, this is a great session beer. I hope it sticks around for a while."
""
"O: This is a great beer and very quaffable but would maybe enjoy more rye. It certainly isn't ""ruthless"" in its utilization of rye."
"O-a decent rye ale, but not in the league with Red's Rye and Hop Rod"
"Overall - A nice alternative to the standard IPA, the addition of Rye makes this beer stand apart from most of the average IPA's. I was hoping for more rye and less of Sierra Nevada's basic flavor profile which, I'll admit I'm not too keen on, but it's about what I expected. It has grown on me since my initial review."
"O - Well, I was afraid this beer was going to be too much like the beers I mentioned above, and it was. Other than the rye flavors and overall dryness of the beer, it wasn't much different. That being said it is enjoyable to me, and the price couldn't be better. I would say to just pick up a pack for yourself and see if it doesn't taste very similar to the Torpedo Extra or Celebration Ale."
"Good beer, but I prefer Northern Hemi, Estate, and Celebration a bit more."
"I cant say much more about the taste that hasn't already been said about the aroma. It's basically Celebration Ale with rye added. Carbonation seems to be just slightly higher than i'd like but makes for some good swirl action and head replenishment. Good beer overall but i may be suffering from Sierra Nevada fatigue."
"O - Another hoppy beer from SV that has excellent hop characteristics. Throughly enjoyed."
"I am now confident that a homebrew RyePA is in order."
"Clear copper with a nice, thick head of off-white foam crowing the top. Interesting blend of rye and hops in the nose...hops are floral with a resinous, oily edge. Lemon, pepper, pine, light melon, and a touch of sour. Flavor has a nice, dank hoppy bite to it. Spicy rye, peppery citrus, earthiness, spruce, and tea. Fat, oily mouthfeel...slick and smooth with a trailing bitterness. I like this. Sierra Nevada is usually good with the hops and this is no exception."
"Pours a dark copper color with garnet hues. A thin layer of off-white bubbles sits atop the liquid as head, but dissipates quickly to scattered patches. Strands of sticky white lacing cling to the glass. Aroma is of lemon and orange citrus, rye, earthen hops, and some light floral notes. Tastes predominantly of rye and lemon zest, with ample citrus hop esters and pine resin coming through as well. Some orange and earthen grains finish it off. Mouthfeel is crisp, light on the tongue, and refreshing at first, but a small amount of the rye flavor seems to build up and linger after a bit. Overall, a great showcase of rye and a solid beer all around. Will certainly be drinking a few more of these."
"Piny, Scotch tape hop bitterness right off the bat. Bready, spicy malt fills in. Grainy, winy notes as well. Maybe a bit of caramel flavor. Hops become peppery, rubbery, and finally citrus-y. Finish is dry, spicy, and bitter. Some lingering caramel-biscuit notes. Medium-bodied, with a nice creamy feel. Certainly a different type of hop-forward beer for SN, and a nice addition to the line-up (wasn't a huge fan of Glissade)."
""
"Overall, this beer is great. I know some people are disappointed that it replaced Glissade, but if you have the ability to create IPAs (I know this is technically a Rye Beer but its hoppy like an ipa) that taste this good, why not do it and make it available to the masses. I personally prefer it over Glissade and love it. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"Overall: I can absolutely understand the Torpedo comparisons, but is that the absolute worst thing in the world? This is almost a more drinkable (less alcoholic) Torpedo in my humble opinion. I will be consuming plenty of this over the coming months."
"One 12 pack is enough of this for me - vs. the 10 + 12 packs that I would have bought of Glissade."
"O: I really enjoyed this one. I'd probably give it an A- on the old scale. The price is right as well. Good work SN."
""
"O- I am really enjoying this beer particularly for the price point. $7.00 for the 6 pack. Well done I will pick another sixer of this beer up."
"O- Very nice offering from Sierra Nevada. I would absolutely pick up another sixer."
"Hey Glissade was good, but I'll take this over it any day. I'm a huge fan of rye IPA's, but with all of the rye coming through in this, I think I'm a bigger fan now. Rye and hops really do go hand in hand. Great brew!"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this is 2012 vintage. The beer is a crystal clear, crisp, bronze coloring with a tremendous, towering, big bubbled, foamy off-white head that has an unreal retention. It stays forever, it seems. Aromas are heavy roasted grain, a slight peppery spicing, and a subtle bouquet of citrus. Very well blended nose. The beer's flavors are burnt, with a toasted cereal taste to the forefront, followed by a slightly resiny hops presence that has a solid citrus tartness. There are peppery spicing notes all over the palate that tingle the tastebuds while you drink. There is a good transition into the aftertaste, which is heavy in roasty/toasty characteristics that are blended and balanced with a light citrus sweetness. The finish is slick, with a resiny feel left behind in mouth, and a slight peppery bite throughout the roof of the mouth. This is a tasty rye...good representation and blending of some very strong ingredients."
"O: On the whole, a solid, easy to drink beer."
"Copper, creamy head, nose of fresh hops grass and horse blanket, unsmoked pot, hay, deliciously unique aroma. Flavor is creamy, peppery, fresh hop, but not too intense. Full malt backbone. Light fruit and caramel, a unique IPA, very delicious, I'll drink quite a few more of these before summer. How this larger craft brewery keeps pounding out these awesome beers is beyond me."
"This is another great beer from SN. Rye beers seem to be far and few between; I'd say this one sets the standards as far as I'm concerned."
"Clear copper with brassy highlights and big rocky head of tan foam that slowly melts to soft peaks leaving scraps of lace on the glass. Pine resin and grapefruit rind with a decent whiff of spicy rye and toasted barley. Grainy and spicy malt with rye and a touch of tobacco leaf and mint. The hop flavors are nice and piney with a taste of candied citrus fruit but well balanced in the scheme of flavors going on here. The medium body feels about right for a 6% IPA and the carbonation is bright. A major improvement over the Glissade Bock in my opinion."
""
""
"Pretty damn good, one of the better rye beers out there."
"Overall: Another Sierra Nevada IPA with a twist of rye."
""
"O: good for a rye beer and an AIPA, I'll have this again whatever it is"
"This is a good beer overall. It will not dethrone Celebration or Torpedo but it is a nice maltied IPA that will help me get my hop fix in the cold winter and spring months. I will probably by a six pack of this before Spring ends and do a side by side with the other Sierra Nevada IPA's"
"Am I going crazy? I pick up anything new from SN - well, at least new to me and I have to say I'm not that impressed. I don't have a very deep palette but I can distinguish a crappy beer from a quality beer. I found this to be just 'average' at best. Somebody tell me I'm not going crazy."

"Ruthless Rye goes in the Sierra Nevada Tulip easy with not any cap or nothing. There is just the smallest bits of white bubbles towards the edge of the glass that die when on the surface, lifeless beer, no stick. smell is rye malt to the max with some faint caramel and a spicy sense. Some piney resins come up to with more whiffs. Taste is even between the rye and the IPA. Rye comes first than a small hit of pined hops. Small traces of caramel throughout. feel is a bit thin, I would say bordering on thin. Carb comes and goes off of the tounge, leaving a resinous effect afterwards. Bitterness is not that large, the rye malt takes care of that. I can say that while this was a noble attempt, it just misses the mark for me. I will try more bottles and a draft to see what's what though."
"O: At first I was a bit skeptical about having the Glissade go and letting this replace it, but I have definitely changed my mind. It has that typical SN IPA feel to it, yet the rye adds a nice kick to it and puts it on another level. Great job SN, keep those beers coming!"
""
"O- Overall another very solid hoppy brew from SN."
"This is a dry brew. A solid example of an American IPA with a rye touch. Another winner from Sierra Nevada!"
"O - Just another solid SN brew. After geeking out on highly sought after brews and whales for 3-4 years now, I can honestly say that SN is UNDER-RATED. Yeah...I said it."
""
"I'm new at this, so here goes. I liked the beer in general. I compared this beer with a Coastal Fog IPA and suddenly realized what the ""body"" of the beer refers to. Before, I either liked a beer or didn't, without regard for why. The first word that popped into my head after a couple of sips of the Rye was ""round", and the Coastal Fog was ""flat"" (not flat as in, no carbonation, just lacking complexity). Ruthless had a nice malt taste, which I'm still figuring out how to articulate, and just enough hops to keep me drinking it. I will say this; I don't know if it was the beer, but I had some pretty messed up dreams for the two nights I drank this beer."
"wow. just wow."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer. Not my favorite from Sierra Nevada but definitely a worthy attempt. Good Rye spice."
""
"It pours a really pretty sunset amber with almost no head lingering. As I smell the beer the first thing I notice is how crisp the hop smell is, lots of zesty citrus aromas with a similar to sprite aroma. I love the hop combination on this beer, not sure what the hops are but they are great. The rye is a great spicy backround note and lends a nice fresh loaf of bread note. The mouthfeel is the classic sierra nevada mouthfeel, chewy but not long lasting on the bitterness. Overall I really like this beer, it is crisp and clean while still intriguing to the palate. Cheers."
"Overall - What a amazing beer to come out after celebration ale. Its almost like they get your ready for hops with the citric bite of celebration. This brew is even more piney, bitter and bolder. This beer is ruthless on your tounge and palette. Im shocked at how hoppy this beer turned out. Might be a little much for some, but the addition of rye mixed with the hops really make this a intense yet flavorful and enjoyable beer. Welcome to the seasonal lineup, fantastic beer!"
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a clear bright orange red, with a fluffy off white head, with amazing retention, and bountiful lace. Smell is tangerine, pine, and some carmel. Taste is all of those, a little sweeter than the nose would let on. Body is on the large side for it's abv, a little dryer than I expected, and easy enough to drink. I must admit, I really was looking forward to this and it didn't blow my mind, but is a beautiful well crafts brew. Still I plan to drink many of these the next couple months. I was hoping it be equal to Founders Rye, that is the pinnacle in this style for me."
"Another good beer at a great price."
"Pours an almost-clear, dark amber color with a medium, white head. Scent is that typical SN hop aroma with some grassy notes and spicy rye aromas. Light malt aroma as well. Taste is initially earthy with some lovely bitter hop flavors. Then there's some nice rye spiciness and grassy, floral flavors. Finishes slightly malty with some hop resin bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slightly chewy, with a dry finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is another solid, highly drinkable beer from SN."
"O- I like this beer. Not sure about the ipa tag though. It's very different and very drinkable, want I want from an SN seasonal. It's not as bitter or as hoppy as I want my IPAs to be but as a random rye beer, this is quite enjoyable."

"O - Overall, this is a tasty offering from SN, which is no big surprise. Worth trying if given the chance."
"O: Good rye beer. I did not think I would like this beer very much, because imo most rye beers are very unbalanced, with one component overshadowing all the others. This is not the case with this beer. It is very well balanced, hops transition in to rye and malt, sweetness rounds everything out. Easy to drink. Good price. I will buy more of this beer."
""
"Like I (may have) said, a nice surprise. Not that I didn't expect a great showing from SN--they're, for my money, tops. It's just that I rarely (read: never) f*x with rye beers, so I guess I just didn't known what to expect. But as long as this baby's fresh, I'll keep buying her."
""
"The bitterness factor is high on this one, both from the hops and the rye. This could probably stand a touch more malt for balance, although the heavy carbonation helps mute the astringency somewhat. I expected a little more complexity but for the most part, what you see is what you get. This isn't a bad beer at all but because of the brewer, I am slightly disappointed and would pick Torpedo or Celebration over this any day of the week"
"A very consistent beer and a fine example of a rye IPA. Just what one may expect from SN."

"This is a wonderfully tasty, spicy, hoppy new beer from Sierra Nevada, and one of few that has really lived up to the hype from the first-gen independents for me in a while. Can't wait to try it on tap."

"O-I really enjoyed this one. Another very respectable beer from a very respectable brewery. I'll be picking up some more of this for sure."
"Will have again."
"Great price for a tasty IPA attempting to be a Rye-PA. I've had a few good RIPAs that put this one to shame, but it's sure better than SN's previous spring seasonal!"
""
"This is a great Rye IPA. Most beers that label themselves as such are either just IPAs with maybe a touch of some spice or just an amber ale with some good rye character. This beer pulls off being an IPA while showcasing the rye sufficiently. Well done."
"O/D-Pretty good. I don't even know if I really love Rye IPAs but perhaps I was expecting a bit more from this one. It isn't a disappointment. Still, its another solid addition to the juggernaut Sierra Nevada."
"O: Definitely a spicy rye lovers beer. The type of bitterness in the finish of this one may not be for everyone as this beer definitely isn’t a standard C-hop forward ipa, the rye adds a unique bitter dimension. Well done SN."
"This just arrived yesterday. It pours a very clean and bright true copper in color with a soapy one finger cream colored head. It smells of sweet caramel malts, honey, tree resin, and has a light spice to it. You could describe it as mellow. The flavors consist of caramel malt, toffee, light maple like resin, the hops are sharp and fresh. It's nice, light and drinkable. The rye makes for a smooth drinker. This is a nice IPA, as should be expected. The light spicyness due to the rye is welcome and makes this a welcome addition to their seasonal lineup."

"Edit: Holy crap, thats the first time I've ever had a review come back with a 0 rdev."
"Ruthless Rye is a fantastic IPA that hits the stride on the style while introducing the rye grains that seem to reinforce hop bitterness and flavor- each elevating the other. Moderate intesity allows for high level of drinkability which could be quite dangerous for an IPA lover like me."
"The aroma was great, but the flavor was ultimately too tart and feel too acidic. I can't see myself drinking more than one a night. There's just too much rye in there. It almost tastes like copper towards the end, and I'm not a huge fan of metallic tastes in my beer. This one coulda been a contender."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and citrus. Taste is delicious. Citrus and hops up front, some rye and malts at the finish, very flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality beer worth seeking out."
"This is a rye showcase which I think will make it a bit more polarizing than some of the other well known rye's, but I'm sold. A good beer by sierra even if it replaces a beer that imo should have been kept."
""
"Had this Rye IPA on tap at the brewery before a meal in the restaurant. Nice coppery color, nice thick, long lasting head and pleasant grassy aroma. Not as bitter as other IPAs. I really enjoyed this beer. So much so I picked up a 6 pack in the gift shop for testing from the bottle."
""
"I heard this beer is replacing the Glissade in SN's seasonal lineup. I enjoyed Glissade... but this one will be a nice addition to a style that, IMO, there just isn't enough of. Keep bringing it, SN... and I'll keep buying it. A very solid beer!"

"I just saw this for the first time today and had to give it a shot. I always love trying new Sierra brews. Pours a deep amber/copper color with a nice fluffy head. Aroma is a bit spicy, but mostly big citrus hops. A nice mix for sure. Taste is similar to other sierra pale/ipa's, but with a little extra bready spice from the rye malt. The hop character is quite nice mixed with the rye. Finishes with a good amount of bitterness, but not over the top. Mouthfeel is good for an IPA, has some substance to it. Overall this is very nice new offering from one of the most solid all around breweries around. I'm very rarely disappointed from SN, a very solid beer."
""
"O: Almost everything about this beer seems beyond criticism. The only thing I found slightly objectionable was the high amount of grapefruit rind bitterness in relation to hoppy flavor in the aftertaste. It looks great and has exactly the mouthfeel, aroma and taste one should expect in a true rye IPA. A great choice for IPA lovers who want something a bit out of the main stream."
""
"Overall it reminds me very much of Torpedo. Ruthless is a great tasting beer but does not differ much from Celebration and Torpedo."
"O: Reminds me an awful lot like torpedo with lots of rye. A really interesting beer for sure. I don't know what I was expecting but it doesn't quite live up to it. Definitely not bad though."
"  Pours a pretty golden amber color that's a shade usually seen around sunset. Not much in the way of head, but the carbonation is lively. Aroma of spicy rye malt and sharp, floral hops, with notes of grass and a light caramel sweetness. Palate is hop forward with a nice sharp, spicy note from the rye. The flavors become more balanced and mellow on the swallow, with a hint of orange peel and caramel malt helping to offset the considerable bitterness, which lingers for a while on the finish. Body is lively and a touch creamy, a great vehicle for the flavors on display here."
""
""
"T: Probably the beefiest IPA I've come across. Nice peppery hop bite upfront followed by a ton of rye, bready malt and some black pepper. I don't think I could drink a ton of this, but it was pretty tasty."
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Not special enough to be a strong seasonal release imo. Excellent price as always from SN. If you like Torpedo or a SN devotee then you'll probably like this beer. If you are looking for something unique or groundbreaking then you'll be disappointed."
"From a bottle in to a 16 oz pint glass. Very clear reddish copper. Thin off-white head with almost no lacing. Smells peppery with a hint of citrus. Grapefruit bitterness and earthy spices on the tongue, crisp with a dry finish. Should go great with the spicy ribs on the grill!"
""
"Overall this is a tasty beer and much better than I expected. I skipped buying the 12 pack of this until I tried it. I will be buying a 12 pack tomorrow for New Years consumption."
"Overall, an excellent new offering from Sierra. I know it's another ""IPA", but this is different. Reminds me of some of the Harvest beers, but with more graininess, and nice spicy rye notes. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability- I thought it was excellent. Sierra Nevada has done a wonderful job once again. Definitely will buy again!"
"Saw an add for this in a beer mag and finally picked up a twelver at Safeway for $12.97. Not bad. On to the beer...sweet looking label. Comic-bookish and nice to look at as the consuming proceeds. Pours a nice amber color with a cream colored frothy head and nice lacing. The aroma is big-time rye oriented. Big rye blasts on each whiff and a slight rubber aroma also. Definitely malt in the background as well. The taste is more rye with a big rye/malt/hoppy bite throughout the buds. Slight citrus in the background. Grapefruit rind is what I'm getting. Bitter and dry aftertaste. Overall if you like Rye, the SN crew really lays it on here. The combo works for me though and I love the effort placed on this new beer. For the price it is very worthy. Nicely done."
