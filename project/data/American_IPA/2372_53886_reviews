"Excellent. Not too hoppy despite its name. Just right."
""
""

""
""
"Great beer, just not as hopy as a would have thought."
""
""
""
"Solid American IPA. Liked this one and would have it again."
"I've had on draft and bottle. This time rating draft. It's good but doesn't rank among my favorite ipas"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, less heavy on the hops and more malt-centric."
"Underwhelming in a crowded ipa market. Hop profile is muddled; nothing cohesive about how hops were put together. Nose nothing special. Just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"7.3 AC, too strong, but taste fine"
""

"12 oz bottle.  Pours orange with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and biscuit malt.  Body is full and tangy.  Citrusy hops, bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long, dry, and grapefruity.  Delicious brew."
"O- a little malt dominant for an IPA, drinkable but would like a little more hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good IPA, but not hoppy enough.  High abv.  Good get drunk beer with moderate flavor."
""
""
""
"Malty, not very complex. Not much depth."
""
""
""
"Mediocre at best..  Malty, not too hoppy."
"Enjoy but a long after taste"
""
"The color is orangish copper, and contains swarms of sediment. The smell contains a hint of citrus, but not much else. The taste has a little pine and a lot of pepper, but not much else in the flavor department. Both the smell and the taste are pretty weak, especially for a name like Hopsecutioner and stating that the drinker will loss their hophead over it. I'm pretty disappointed in it. It's an ok drink, but I'll never get it again. It's one of my least favorite IPAs."
""
"Maybe I had an infected bottle, but unless someone one day hands me this beer, I will not be having it again."
""
""
""
"One of my first loves, hard to rate it worse"
""
""
""
""

"From bottle, took me to 4th of a six pack to figure out. Decent offering but definitely more malt than hops. Smells hoppy, initial taste is hops but malty takes over and lingers with a malty bite rather than a bitter finish. Almost in agreement with another review that called this a pale ale. Maybe my review would be different if I tasted blind and was told this was a pale ale. Worth a bottle but maybe no more unless you like a malt hop combo leaning toward the malt side."

"Good IPA for beginners. Wish it had more hops but overall very good beer"
"Okay Alright, could be better"

"Average brew. Wish it had more hops as it's called the hopsecutioner but they are there just not as much for a seasoned hop head."
""
""
""
"Pours a honey orange with a slight red tint and a thin white head.   Earthy, rye, and citrus hop musk.  Tastes of sweet citrus, rye, bready and pine.  Medium light body, nice moderate pine resin aftertaste.  Some lacing down the glass."
"very bitter, taste lingers. needed water between sips to get through it"
""
""
"Heavy & very filling IPA.  The malt profile is rich and the hops abundant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Always enjoy this brewer, but this one's a mid-pack IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, just thought it was a little underwhelming, probably won't seek this one out again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Not as hoppy as you would think, but an excellent beer nonetheless.  Very underrated on this website."
""
""
"Drinking a tall draught right now at Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd previously tried it from the bottle and wondered if it would taste different from the keg. The answer: no. Both times I've been disappointed. As a previous reviewer opined, the name is deceptive. This is not the hop bomb the name suggests. Not even close. It's not bad. Not bad at all. But it's utterly forgettable. A ""Hopsecutioner"" should never be forgettable."
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex IPA that is not overwhelmed by the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"1/3....pours bright amber, beautifully poured with a tiny head of white foam. Malty toffee nose. Hearty rich hoppy taste. Boozy, cough syrup taste. Quite heavy."
""
""
"Really enjoy this.  Smooth IPA with a great finish"
"F-slightly low on carbonation, but not far off"
""
""
""
"loved to smell and start but didn't like the aftertaste"
"Nicely done. Aroma is better than taste."

"An above average east coast IPA. Very tasty."

"I'm from Eugene Oregon. Not so much snobbish as particular. May be the same thing. Terrapins seems to be a fine brewer, but from my experience, to call something ""Hopsecutioner"" would mean something quite hoppy. Hoppy this is not. I've had black hole inducing puckers and fifty variations more hoppy than this (Hop Valley Alpha Centuri Binary, Stone Crime, Russian River Pliny The Elder, Bonyard Hop Venom etc. etc.). I give it a low rating for the poor naming. It matters ;)"

"I really liked the orange tinge to the brew, it added to the thick, white head that had really good staying power.  That's pretty much where the distinctive parts of the beer end.  The smell was basic IPA and the mouthfeel was mostly carbonated. I will say the taste was bold lightly citrusy, so kudos there.  Overall, it was a pretty good IPA but nothing really that made it stand out from the pack."

"Overall: this one is a bit dark and a bit sweet for what I look for in an IPA. a low bitterness almost makes it come off has a hoppy red ale really."

"Great dating on this 12-12-14. Should be fresh. 1/2 finger of white head on top of a pure golden snifter of gorgeous brew. Quite the looker. Piney and floral aromas coming through as well as the hint of some bitterness from the hops. Clear, ringing pine flavor up front, light bitterness, and the thought that a bit more bitterness would really help with the balance. Light mouthfeel, only slightly oily, but in my opinion pretty much spot on for what an IPA should 'feel' like. Just as expected, well crafted. This was quite good. Could hit the regular 'warm weather' rotation if this becomes a little easier to find in the area."

"Almost like an imperial or a double. Good Hop presence, but with a backbone.  Very Good. Reasonable price."

"A Nice malty IPA. The pronounced malt in this beer definitely helps balance the assertive hops. Has a lot of biscuit  and malt notes in the aroma and the taste as well. Good mouthfeel, and perfect carbonation. Overall a good beer but not great."

"12 oz bottle dated 10/2014 in a wide mouth glass.  Orange in color.  Thin head that dissipates quickly.  Hoppy smell with some herbs and citrus.  The taste is malty and herbal, with a hop taste that doesn't overpower or leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  Surprisingly light to medium bodied with some noticeable carbonation.  This is an excellent, refreshing beer."
"Overall:  Another solid offering from this brewery."

"I will admit, the interesting artwork of this ""hopsecutioner"" is what attracted me to the bottle, but what i found, was a above average IPA. While India pale ales are not normally my favorite, i did enjoy this ale from terrapin beer co. Its is a cloudy ale, thats appearance does not strike me one way or the other, but it has a strong and wonderful smell to it. The taste is above average, but i would not call it out stating, and the mouthfeel is pretty average. Overall i would say it is a beer worth picking up."
""

"A delicious headache in a glass. A simple go to beer, if its in the cooler and only other choice is a Sweetwater or bud light... You'd better believe you go for the hopsecutioner. But overall its easy to Drink and tastes good.... nothing that will make you say wow or want to write home about, but easy and good."
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, chill-hazed, copper coloring with a filmy, clingy, white head. Nose of resinous hops and tart grapefruit forward, with a tangy caramel backbone, and piney highlights. Great nose! Flavors are grapefruit and pineapple forward, with a tangy caramel and roasted backbone, peppery herbal notes, and piney resinous tones throughout. Smooth and balanced, on a light, smooth body. The aftertaste is tropical fruit, with a subtle bitter resin character. Smooth, resinous, slightly dry finish. Very tasty and very drinkable."

"Overall – Not a hop powerhouse for an IPA but rather easy drinking and fairly balanced overall. Even so the flavors are quite nice and produce a rather easy drinking and enjoyable brew overall."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, grapefruit juice, and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is fairly tasty, but I was expecting more hop qualities based on the name."
"A very tasty IPA, easy to drink. A pleasant alternative to DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I try to be average on most IPAs because they are not my go to beer. I also don't have a really discriminating hop palate, so I try to stay even on most of these."
""
"Tried super fresh, and papaya and mango notes really came out. Still not overly bitter. Like the toffee notes to the malt."

"I had this beer on tap in Atlanta. It pours a one finger lacy head and a beautiful orange color. Nose is citrus forward with a nice fresh bread undertone. Initial taste is grapefruit with a surprisingly mild hop burn on the backside. It certainly does not ""execute"" your taste buds. The mouthfeel and overall taste is thin compared to west coast IPA's like Pliny Elder or Lagunitas Maximus, which I believe it is trying to emulate. Overall, it is a good effort and if you like the style it's worth a try."

"Terrapin has not quite delivered on “Hopsecutioner”. Getting beyond the name, however, it is a relaxing beer. Perhaps my bottle is older, however, it’s difficult to say since the best by chart was blank."
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its appearance. The head is a nicely aesthetic cap, and retains wonderfully to the last drop, helping to keep up the air of an open invitation. The flavoring, although sweet, relatively clean, and heavily malted, does raise questions for something labeled “Hopsecutioner”. Unless they meant that they were killing the hops here, then maybe it would be appropriate. Joking aside, the grain does go overboard in both the aromatic and gustatory departments, marginalizing and underplaying the hops. For a DIPA, in comparison, that huge grain bill with the dog food wash and grit would be much more appropriate, and somewhat expected from an American producer. Although this beer seems to sell itself on reputation alone, they might be better pressed, if they ever find the need for rebranding, to call this one double/imperial in the future to justify the recipe. That said, this is not a bad beer, but also not something you want to coddle all night. Our biggest complaint is that it lacks a certain inherent freshness of hoppiness to it, which again, might be expectationally altered with a rebranding."

"Nice color on this one. Decent hop profile, though could use more kick. Malt shows through more than I would expect, or prefer really. Pretty easy drinking though. Nothing really mind blowing in the end, to be honest. Decent enough, and certainly well made."

"i find it hard to believe that the ratings are not higher on this beer...it stands up to Green Flash ,Sculpin and the like..too bad its not available he in MA,had to bring it back from GA... if you like stronger IPA's ..this is a must try....you will not be disappointed ..."

"BBD 5/14. Clear golden with a touch of amber pour. Nice head with lasting lacing. Very nice nose of citrus hops - grapefruit with a touch of lemon over a slight sweetness. Almost medium body with a mouthfeel that is almost slick. Low average carbonation level. The flavor profile is quite tasty and is hop flavor based, rather than bitterness oriented. It begins with citrus, mostly grapefruit, over a slight malt sweetness. It progresses to a nice low level burst of bitterness and grapefruit tartness. The finish is smooth over a bit of effervescence that is sweet, tart and has a lingering soft bitterness. Quite nice!"

"O: Maybe I thought the label was misleading a bit.. Hopesecutioner to me means hops galore, I kept taking sips to find what I was looking for and I never found it. My highest rating on this was appearance, I'd much rather have a higher rating on taste and smell. With that said its not a bad beer just not what I thought it was going to be."

"The pours a creamy off white head that quickly dissipates. The beer's color is a brownish orange instead of the usual amber variation. The beer is filtered and clear. The beer's smell is unusually malt forward with very little hops coming through. The malt's smell is caramel malt. The hops that do come out are an orange and floral smell but are covered by the heavy malt presence. The taste is very similar to the smell with a stronger caramel malt presence than the hops. After the beer warmed up a little bit, the hops emerge but barely. The hop taste becomes a grapefruit taste but is still dominated by the malts. The hops are not as strong as one would expect from an IPA. The beer is medium bodied but on the heavier side because of the malts. Also, very little carbonation. The IPA is okay but it is very unusual in that the malts have a much heavier presence than the hops. I probably won't pick this one up again because of the lack of hop flavor. Given the name, I expected more hops."

"Poured into a sam adams glass and a light, bubbly, off white head developed with little lacing and mild retention. Appearance was a hazy with a light amber to orange color. Had a nice citrus and flower aroma with nice hoppy notes. Had a very mild taste with cutrus and flower notes and a bitter hop finish, some slight caramel notes. Watery mouthfeel and a dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I really love this beer! The 6 hops and 4 malts mix together to form something super unique and addictive. Excellent balance. Will have this many more times to come."

"This is a good beer, but not what I would expect for an A-IPA. I think that it needs some more hop presence in its flavor profile. Otherwise appearance and MF are spot on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I admit to occasional wavering on reviews insofar as sometimes I rate them according to how I like them rather than how well they represent their intended style. That was the case here. As a hop bomb it falls way short, but as a tasty brew it is truly exceptional."
""
""
""
"This is not groundbreaking in the realm of IPAs, but what it is is drinkable. I only had one, but wanted more. Surprisingly drinkable when you think about the 7.3 abv as well."
""
"O: I'll give it one thing - it's drinkable. Very drinkable, even for a 7.3% IPA. It just doesn't have the most interesting flavor is all. If I had bought a 6 pack of this (which I didn't) I wouldn't have any trouble killing it."
"O- As a fan of West Coast floraly/Citrus IPA's, this IPA simply was not for me. For a name like ""Hopsecutioner"" I expected the hop presence to be a lot stronger but the malt flavor just over powered it for me. As a fan of super hoppy beers, I was somewhat deceived by the name. But for this east coast brew it wasn't BAD. I enjoyed this beer until that metal like taste hit me at the end. An OK beer. However, i will not be buying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good quaffable IPA, although the %abv puts it out of session range."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is decent. One of the most sessionable beers I've had recently. Maybe my palate is wrecked because of the Heady and other DIPAs I've had recently but this just doesn't satisfy the want for hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nicely balanced IPA that certainly finishes with that IPA bitter kick, especially emphasizing the citrus hops, but also containing a strong biscuit note with a slight amount of caramel that makes this a very delicious and balanced version of the typically highly unbalanced IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall 3.25: Good IPA, but it falls short of being anything special. There are several levels on which it is exceptional, but the problem present in the taste (i.e. the metallic taste) takes away from its overall enjoyment. There are so many IPAs out there, that this one really falls short and is just slightly above average."
""
""
""
"O - It certainly doesn't seem like a year-old bottle, so I have to assume this is a relatively fresh bottle that just doesn't live up to it's name."
"Overall: this is an underrated brew. It's nice and hoppy. I would definitely buy this again."
""

"Tastes way uneven, much heavier and more alcoholic than its ABV would lead you to expect. Pleasantly intense and fruity hoppy beginning moves quickly into an aggressively sweet, syrupy middle that lasts until the end and blots everything else out."

"Sweet floral hop aroma. Copper penny color. Fantastic clarity and effervescent carbonation. More of a pine like hop aroma on the nose. Very smooth mouthfeel considering the level of hop intensity. Good balance of piney hops and malt backbone on the palate. This is a well balanced beer."

"Served on tap at the EMORY Convention Center and Hotel Friday 24 May after a 2-day drive from Connecticut. Delicious and very satisfying. This would be my regular brew if not for Dogfish 60-minute IPA. Liked this Terrapin in the bottle, like it better on tap."

"A nice, aggressively hopped brew from the South. Almost would call this their attempt at a West Coast IPA. Though I wouldn't put it in my normal rotation (which I can't anyway being I live in CA, not GA), I would never turn one down if offered. Nice job Terrapin!"

"O: I honestly didn't care for this beer. I found it a very ""average"" IPA at best. I had always wanted to try this beer and had a friend stop in Georgia to grab it for me. The only saving grace is that it is VERY drinkable for it's ABV."
""
""
"Hopsecutioner is a nice ale. Not perfect, but if you like hoppy ales, this is a pretty good IPA. Nice bitter start, and it feels good on the mouth. Why do you like hoppy? You want flavor, right? Hopsecutioner has flavor, and it looks and smells like an IPA? Is it perfect? No, but this is a nice IPA. Alcohol is 7+%, so be aware."

""
""
""
""

"I absolutely love this beer. It is one of the best that Terrapin makes and I've tried many of their beers. This is an approachable IPA - not too much of a hop-blast to turn off those new to IPAs, but enough to keep me happy. Their other beer, kind of like DFH, are variations of hop-heavy brews, but this one is a pure, unadulterated, clean, drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice beer to pick up on the fly but not something I would personally go out of my way to seek out."
""
""
"O: the bottle description couldn't be more wrong in my opinion. as this one is very plain and doesn't give me that ""hophead"" feeling. i will say that the 7.3% is extremely well hidden and i find this one pretty drinkable. overall though, i want a beer to at least resemble its description, and i feel cheated on this one."

"O: I feel like there is either something wrong with these beers or with my palate today. I had this at a Terrapin event but it was just a sample. I remember it tasting better. Luckily, a friend gave this to me. Their Hopzilla is much better. Still not a bad IPA, but it is one of the lesser IPAs I have had."

"Overall glad I tried it fresh. It's crisp and tart, which is unique, but smell and flavor are not entirely there for me. Cheers."

"O - I'm sure this is a great IPA for some, but this hops profile does not agree with my palate. I cannot eat a bitter grapefruit, and this beer reminds me of that experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good, but not amazing, IPA. It hits all the right notes, without setting itself apart. I do think the name invites certain expectations that only an extraordinary DIPA could meet, but this is a solid IPA. I would grab a six-pack now and again."
""
"O - Glad I can at least make the trip to Jersey to get these guys. If its good enough for the Governor on Walking Dead it sgood enough for me."

"Overall: I am a west coast IPA snob so keep that in mind. This was crafted very well but the hop profile was weak. Could have used some late boil or dry hops to give it a nose and an identity. Quality beer just not enough hops for what it claims to be."
""
""
"From notes, 10/23/10. Good beer, but doesn’t really stand out in any way amongst IPAs. Aroma is kinda musty and a bit muted. Grapefruit rind, pineapples, grass, caramel, yeast. Taste is a little thin. The malt isn’t quite dry enough for a West Coast and not really round enough for a good maltier IPA. OK bitter bite in the finish. Appearance is a nice medium amber, transparent, with a creamy, off-white head. Overall, it was a bit of a letdown for me."
""
""
"Smell is rather boring for an ipa...generic hop and malt aroma. Taste is similar...very generic but I would give it a slight plus. Its good not great...but hits hard."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I am not saying that powerful hop bitterness is the only thing that makes for a quality IPA, but when a brewery is bold enough to call its beer Hopsecutioner, then it should deliver on that promise by producing a profound hop bite. This beer does not even come close to that goal."
"O - Good flavor. Not the best ipa but overall its a Good and well rounded beer."
""
""
""
""
"No hopsecutinor (not a hop bomb) but worth a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A well made DIPA but just not my cup of tea. Too sweet."
"O - All in all, a beer with an interesting and good flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this execution! A solid IPA that delivers floral and earthy notes with a sprinkle of citrus delicacy. A easy drinking brew that delivers flavor and quality. One to surely revisit time and time again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - it's drinkable and drinkable, but would not be my first choice when in the mood for a hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoy a good IPA from time to time, but my favorite beers tend to be more toward stouts, browns, etc. However, I really enjoyed this particular IPA. To date, my favorites are Torpedo and Ruthless Rye from Sierra Nevada, and this one, respectively. Definitely worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice spicy, peppery hop profile leads me to believe the type of hops were Central European. A decent IPA and easily drinkable even with the alcohol being a prominent role in the flavor department."
""
"O: Best By the third week of April? I really hope that was 2013. Disappointing, I was hoping for a head-slashing experience. One plus is the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
"O - To be honest, I was expecting more from this one. I hope that best by date was 2013...either way, solid and very balanced IPA."
""
""
""
""
"May be i am drinking this one too late or very fresh as it has enjoy by date of 2nd week of March. Since it does not mention year it could be either 2012 in which case i am late to the party. In the case of 2013, which is more likely since i picked it from a store in Atlanta, GA, this is an average IPA at its best. Very misleading packaging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK I like this quite a bit. The beer is disappearing fast. Something ragingly drinkable about this one. They've done a great job of blending everything together into a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts. Hard to tell the individual elements, but that's a good thing. It's very much a West Coast style, but not aggressive. Great fruity-hoppy-malty composite. Very professional work from Terrapin!"

"OVERALL: Not quite my style. Very hoppy for sure, but it's definitely on the grassy/piney side of the hop spectrum. The nose doesn't quite match what was to follow either. Still, this is a quality beer that I'd gladly drink again. Thanks again codysjb!"
""
""
""
"I've had this before, drinking from a bottle, but enjoying this from a glass brings it to a more memorable level. The smell on this is quite good; although smooth and sufficiently bitter the taste takes a backseat to the nose. Would love to try this on tap, in Spring, and reevaluate. Will purchase again regardless."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"This was a very solid IPA with the hop profile of an Imperial. It had nice balance and was very enjoyable brew."
""
""
"This pours a very hazy amber with almost no head, and minimal lacing. The nose is just about all fruit. I pick up apples, raisins, oranges, lemon, and some pine. Taste is a sweetness upfront kind of orange flavored, but the finish delivers a powerful hop bomb. Mouthfeel is nice with not much of an aftertaste. There are better IPAs, but this one is not bad. Taste is the strong suit and that's what matters most."
""
""

" Either way it's too bad and I am dissapointed."

"Overall: Glad it's in the growler because it's cheaper than getting a six pack. It's not bad, it'd probably be a better lawnmower beer. I think a slightly sweeter grain bill and some more flavorful and robust hops would make a world of difference."
"Drinkability is OK. It's clearly a strong, hoppy beer, but it lacks distinction. Easy to suck down for a hop head, it's a nice fix for me on vacation in the SE IPA wasteland, but I'll be happy to be back to the NW for a proper American IPA. In fairness of this critique, the hops taste a little stale, I'd be surprised if this is fresh and not a high turnover brew at the Orlando area grocery where I got it - unrefrigerated!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great example of an ""East Coast"" IPA. Highly recommended for an easy drinking IPA."
""
""
""

"O: This beer isn't that difficult to drink. Although the bitterness and hop flavors aren't quite as strong as some of the other beers in the style, it still has a nice amount of hop flavors."

"My first Terrapin beer when I moved to Florida. Pours a clear golden copper color with a one finger white head. Aroma of citrus, pine, light bitter grassiness. Flavor follows with a nice light citrus peel, sweet pale malts, a hint of pine and bitter on the way down. Smooth and crisp finish makes this extremely drinkable. Light bodied, with medium high carbonation. Solid brew."

"My pour netted me a massively thick, foamy tawny head that extended above the rim of the glass, resembling the top of an ice cream cone. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with minty hops. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was like spearmint or peppermint, really intense and cooling! Yum! The finish was dry, cool, minty, just the way I really prefer an AIPA. The sticky lacing that was left behind was going to require a jackhammer to remove. More, please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid IPA. Nice balance, good drinkability, and a nice hop character."

"This beer is nothing if not hoppy. Of the many breweries in the country, Terrapin handles hops some of the best. Of the many breweries in the south, Terrapin is one of the most known and respected. The beer is incredibly hoppy, but still drinkable. It is truly a triumph to Spike and the Terrapin crew."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark golden color with two finger foam head, lots of lace. Aroma had some fruit and floral hops. Taste started out slightly sweet and malty with a creamy feel then turned a bit dry with a floral bitterness that stuck around turning a bit sticky. Overall I liked it but it seemed to lack flavor up front and by the time the bitterness hits you its dry sticky and to late."
""
""
""

"drank this recently. i love ipas so and this is a great one. i would recommend this beer to any hop lovers. terrapin has never steered me wrong. although i cant find this at any bar around me. so i have to go to my local total wine to get a six pack but its worth it."
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a very drinkable beer, certainly not a session beer as the ABV is a little too high for that and the flavors are a little too intense. More well balanced than expected."
"The mouthfeel was medium in body with plenty of carbonation. I would pick this up again."
""
""
""

"A solid out of my region IPA that I was glad to get a chance to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a. 13 oz tulip glass, best bymid July. Pours a wonderful orange, with a one inch white that leaves nice lace. Smell is pine, tangerine, grass, carmel, and grapefruit. Taste is all of that, balanced nicely with some marijuana flavors in the finish. Body medium large, plenty of life, lush not dry, and very drinkable. Thanks again to friend Pat for bringing this treat from Florida for me. This is very a solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Found at World of Beers in Altamonte Springs, FL this IPA has a yellow amber color, clear and fairly quiet, with a very solid white head that sticks and leaves a hearty skin behind. The aroma has very light citrus, lemon wheat, not much else. Okay. The flavor follows with a bit stronger citrus hop and a bright malt biscuit backbone. I taste what seems like alcohol, which at 7.2 percent, it probably is. This edge seems to mask the hop qualities in my opinion and steels the IPA value I was looking for. Really makes it ordinary to me. This is medium-light bodied with a busy, small bubble carbonation that delivers a crisp feel. It ultimately turns entirely harsh and grassy to me and is more regrettable than memorable, but it’s not awful. Disappointing though. I don't think I had any problems with it in a bottle, but this one on tap has some issues."
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyed this beer with a friend, always the best way to do it."
""
"O: This was pretty good. Different, and tasty. I'd say if you haven't yet, give it a try! You might like it even more than I did."
""
""
"O-Easy drinking IPA. Not overpowering, could be a good intro beer to this style. And the second pour was better than the first, that's good."
""
""
"Overall it's not my go-to local IPA but it's quite serviceable. It isn't mind blowing but certainly worth a try if you get a chance."
""
"Overall: A no-nonsense IPA, with plenty of big, bold hop presence throughout. While not extremely complex, several different hop flavors combine with a subdued, but essential balancing light malt for a well-crafted, completely enjoyable beer. The 7.3% ABV is detectable, but the alcohol serves more as a flavor-blender than a flavor element unto itself."
""
"A well made IPA that may have been less balanced fresh from the brewery, as it stands it is a tasty brew that I consumed very quickly with no hint of the booze evident as I drained my glass."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden bordering on amber with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly into my glass. Smells of citrus and pine mostly with hints of caramel apricot and toffee. It took a couple of days to find this but yeah this is what I needed after days of macro only restaurants. Taste is sweet up front with bready toffee malts that quickly fade to citrus and pine. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous and sweet mouthfeel. Nice brew, it almost works in 85 degree weather too."

""
""
"O - With a name like Hopsecutioner, you gotta bring it! This one didn't seem to. Hopsadaisy more like. It was pretty easy drinking though, and would be pleasant enough as a sessioner."
"Pours a bright copper color with a 2 finger white head and decent lacing on the glass. Aromas are full of citrus fruits and hops. Pretty straight forward. Taste is light but enjoyable. Not overpowering but a nice sweetness with floral notes and a hop finish. Mouthfeel is fairly thin but well carbonated. Overall this is a decent session IPA. Could handle quite a few of these."
"For a beer that I wasn't entirely sure if I've had before, I figured I'd pick up what seemed to be a fresh bottle. I thought it would be an enjoyable IPA and a fun review. As for the IPA, I'm a bit disappointed. I should have picked up the past-expiration Rye Squared they had at the bottleshop instead. A lesson learned. 3.5"

"Clear copper colored with surprisingly small head. Not a lot of lacing. Smell has citrus, pine, and some grassy notes...but not a very strong smell at all. Again, surprised by that. (Maybe this bottle isn't very fresh?) Taste is bitter forward hops with piney-citrus notes. Finishes very clean. I like this beer a lot and would not turn it down, but somehow it was a little bit ""less"" than what I expected. To me, it seems very balanced (more of a pale ale), and not what I would consider a ""hophead"" beer. But, hey...pale ale's are my favorite style, so that's okay with me. A true ""hophead"" may want a bit more though."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of citrus and hops. Taste is good, big hops up front, lots of citrus, a good malt balance, considerable bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
""
"Good overall."
""
""
"O: A nice IPA from Terrapin, nothing to crazy, a good balance for an IPA."
"Ale pours a deep gold color with barely an inch of head. Some lacing down the pint glass. Pleasant aroma of tropical fruits, taste has a burst of hops balanced with malt. Finishes pleasantly bitter with smooth aftertaste with slight alcohol burn. Very smooth and drinkable at 7.3 ABV. Watch out it catches up with you!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a darker straw color with a small white head. Smells of hops, hops, hops, with nice malty tone. The hops give a little bit of a floral note which compliments the malty hint nicely. Tastes of hops, light malts, and a finish of hops. Carbonation seems right, smooth finish with a little hop bite. Overall, a good beer and IPA, one of the better ones out there."
"O: fair selection of a middle of the road American IPA. Dry hoppy goodness with not too much overall depth."
""
""
""
"Slightly darker than straw gold, foamy white head with excellent retention. Lots of bubbling carbonation. Nose is pine and light citrus. Taste has nice bitterness, citrus, and faint caramel. Improves with warmth. Medium bodied, finishes dry. Yum."
"This is quite similar to Bell's Two Hearted in profile, but not as good. A good IPA but not a great one, the malt sorta weirded me out."
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good IPA. I was pretty excited when I poured it and when I smelled it, but the taste leaved me asking for more. I also tasted more alcohol than I probably wanted to after the nose didn't suggest much. I would definitely drink it again, but it's not my favorite IPA."

""
"The beer is slightly hazy and appears a light orange hue. The white head stands in at around a half inch, leaving some decent lacing in its path. The aroma offers pine resin, alcohol, and a hint of citrus. The flavor brings a robust malt bill, as well as some piny hops, with subtle hints of citrus. Alcohol is a bit too present in both the aroma and flavor for my liking. Still, an enjoyable brew. The body is thicker than is customary for the style. A light bitterness lingers on the tongue between sips. Overall, decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of markwise poured into a pint glass. Deep orange bronze with a lovely, creamy head. The bottle says best enjoyed by the end of March. Aroma is less forgiving, with mainly wheat bread notes and a whisper of orangey hops. Flavor is just about the same. With a name like Hopsecutioner, you’ve got to bring the hops. This falls short in hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. The one thing this beer has going for it is a pillowy mouthfeel. Really soft and smooth going down."

"Pours a clear, bright Orange with a medium, tan head. Sticky lace. Aroma is very fresh, tropical fruit, and light bitter hops. Taste is Smooth, more of the tropical fruit, and a light pine hop, with a light to medium body. Very drinkable. Hard to believe it's 7.3% abv. With a name like Hopsecutioner, I expected this to be a lot more ""hoppy", but by the end of the glass, I was pretty happy with it. Not your typical IPA, but worth it."
""
"For my first Terrapin, I'm not overly impressed. The beer has a good nose but it doesn't translate nearly as well to the taste as I was hoping. Makes me wonder if I need to go check the date on the bottle."
"O - an average beer. i was really expecting a lot more for something called hopsecutioner, but all i got was a slightly hoppy very earthy beer :-/"

"D/O - Drinkability is high. As a self-proclaimed hop head and lover of West Coast-style IPAs, I typically prefer hop-bills that aren't as strong in my IPAs, but Terrapin really puts together something tasty here. Very drinkable for the ABV as well."

"Hopsecutioner has a very light taste to it - hard to believe it's 7.3% ABV. It has a nice balance of citrus-y hops (nothing too distinct) with the malt-y backbone, although I would have preferred the ratio weighted more towards the former. The finish is sweet and dry, with plenty of malts that hit the back of the tongue. It doesn't pack much punch in the finish though - it doesn't have much substance to ""chew on"" for a beer that touts the hops. Another reviewer mentioned it has a ""tea-like"" taste to it, and I think that's right on. It is very drinkable for a stronger IPA, though. This would be a good summer IPA, although I can't help but thinking that ""Hopsecutioner"" doesn't quite live up to their name. I'd like to check out more from Terrapin."

"O: Alright, Terrapin’s got my attention; I’d love to have access to this all the time. I don’t know if it’s the balanced flavors or the unique fruitiness, but it hits the spot. At any rate, the Schmaltz collaboration in my fridge looks even more exciting now."
"Color is orange to light amber. The off-white head is moderately sized but fades fairly quickly, with little lacing left behind. Fruity scents are nice but weak, giving the impression that this will be a pretty hoppy beer. It really isn't, for an IPA - malts are front and center; bready and nutty. There is a sweetness to it that is quite unique. A twinge of bitterness and citrus comes through in the finish. While the taste is good and balanced, I expect more of hops punch to rate it among the better IPAs."
"O - Nice IPA but seemed really close to DIPA territory. There are much better examples though."
"O: Hopsecutioner is a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer. If you're after a straight forward, bitter hopfest, this would be a good call."
"Would definitely go for this again"
"O- At first, I wasn't impressed by this one. But, once I broke it down and drank it from a glass rather than a bottle, I could fully appreciate it. Terrapin isn't in the forefront of the craft beer movement, but they're one of the major players for sure. Keep it up guys!"
"Pours a wonderfully clear sunset orange with a two finger head that sticks around. Aroma is mostly floral hops, citrus, and caramel. Smells tasty. Taste is citrus, light pine, oranges, and caramel. Slightly bitter but the malt balances it out masterfully. One of the most balanced IPAs that have passed through these lips. Very easy drinking and one that would be perfect for someone new to the style. Not a particularly complex or original IPA, but a delicious one. Good representation of an East Coast IPA."
"I've had this beer many times now, and when fresh it's a very nice beer. I was particularly pleased with this version in a cask served at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a generous head. The aromas are a very nice combination of sweet malt, citrusy hops, earthiness, and some drying woodiness from the cask. The taste is similar, with a light citrus and paraffin profile to start and then some sweet malt and woodiness. A little thinner than I'd like for it to really shine- particularly with the oak notes, but overall it's very nice."
"O: A highly balanced beer. For something called Hopsecutioner, I expected a hop-bomb, but there is a lot of malt in this beer. Never overpowering, but I'm not sure that I would have more than one."
"This is yet another brewery that delivers everything I would want from an American IPA. Strongly hopped yet still keeps some kind of balance."
"O - A solid IPA that I will drink happily anytime of the year."
"Flavor offers an orange creaminess with a light bitterness up front and a citric finish. Light touch of hazelnut lingers on the finish. Somewhat balanced and not as overpowering in the hops department as the name might suggest, and what I was looking for, yet pretty solid nonetheless. Feel is full, creamy at times, and easy on the palate, offering a light but steady carbonation. Overall a bit too malt forward for me, though surely not for others and worth a visit and perhaps a revisit should I stumble upon this one again."
"Overall a decent IPA, but disappointing for a beer with the name Hopsecutioner. Would drink it again if offered, but not something I'm going to seek out."
"Cheers"
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, nice kick, decent representation of style. Another decent brew out of Terrapin. This brewery has yet to disappoint."
"Pours a burnt gold with just a bit of head and a slight haze. Smells mild, a slight bitter hop note, some citrus and pine. Taste is a nice balance of hops and malt but a bit subdued. A lingering slightly dry and bitter finish is the best part. A nice beer overall, just slightly lacking in enough power to live up to the name."
"O--This is a good, not great, IPA. Terrapin is (if you haven't picked up on it) one of my favorite breweries. It reminds me of college days in Athens, GA. But I wish this had just a bit more to it. It's not a very complex IPA. I'd like a bit more hop-forward IPA whereas this seems to be a bit more fruit-forward. It's good, but not my favorite."
"VERY GOOD, ENJOY YOURSELF!"
"Overall, solid IPA, would love to see it on shelves in Texas one day, glad I brought it back with me"
"Solid and adequate IPA, not the best I've had but still very tasty."
"orange amber with creamy head. white foam retreats to the edges of the glass and waves of bubbles stick the sides of the glass. Super sticky head. Smell is of huge pine and hints of sweet. Initial blast to the palette of hop bitterness. first sip don't get much other than the bitter and it lingers throughout the brew. the palette goes numb and the rest of the drinking experience makes way to sweeter malt flavors. slight hints of roasted barley...smokey flavors peek up, almost like a mild tobacco flavor in the tail end. This beer, though, is no joke when it comes to bitterness. Huge hop presence lingers 100% of the time during this. More of an east coast style of IPA, getting little any fruit bitterness here, but overall very well balanced after the intial sip. Mouthfeel is medium with a huge stickiness factor. Covers the palette well and lingers for a good 10 minutes after done. Superb flavors, slight booze...great brew and sneaks up at +7%"
"Overall, enjoyable to drink. Nice IPA, not spectacular or noteworthy."
"Maybe I'm just not a fan of Terrapin beers. For something called Hopsecutioner this was definitely hoppy, but more toward the balanced side than the majority of IPA's. Even without the branding disappointment, there's not a ton of complex or overly great flavor notes out of this one. It's not awful and definitely drinkable, but it's run of the mill as far as IPA's."
"O: A very nice IPA, hop forward with only a bit of malt to keep things in check. Surprised it was 7.3%, if it were a bit lower could be a staple IPA in my fridge any day."
"Pours a clear, medium, orange-amber hue. A small head of ivory froth leaves sticky, thin webbing on the glass. The aroma explodes with dank hoppiness, showing loads of sticky pine resin, cannabis, dried grass, and juicy orange. Once the initial hop wave subsides, underlying notes of soft toffee and grain emerge. After the hop bomb nose, however, flavors just don’t measure up. There’s a strong and overwhelming graininess, almost like a stale cereal element, that tends to cloud or dull the resinous, grassy hop bite. It’s still quite bitter and hoppy, but that toasted grain just seems to get in the way. It’s almost like they were shooting for a west coast style and just got the malt bill wrong. Still pretty decent though. The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, perhaps getting a little thin at the end. Grassy hop burps are sure to ensue."
"Uncomplicated flavors make for easy drinking, one to consume when working around the home, or watching a sports event, you know when you really are paying more attention to something other than the brew but want a decent drink none the less. As noted above I could not determine the bottling date, but experience tells me that this was not the freshest example. If I retaste a fresher bottle I will edit these notes."
" Palate is hop-forward, with notes of grapefruit and a hint of grass. Pale malt emerges on the swallow, bringing a sweetness that helps balance the bitterness of the hops. The finish retains some major citrus character, with a lingering biscuit malt base. Body is full and a touch creamy, but not sticky, which is nice. A very tasty, assertive offering from a solid brewery."
"Overall this is a beer that I might recommend to someone that is new to IPAs. Not my cup of tea, but certainly not a bad beer. I won't seek this one out again, but if you want to buy me one, I definitely wouldn't turn my nose up at it."
"o: Good stuff bordering on DIPA territory. I'm becoming more and more of a Terrapin fan."
"Overall - This beer had a little bit of everything going on taste wise. If you are a fan of fruity/citrus IPA's than seek this one out for sure. It's not a hop bomb, but it has an above average amount of bitterness. I'd drink it again anytime."
"O - This is a very nice IPA from Terrapin. They seem to do a very nice job with their IPAs."
"Tap: Sad to say, but an old bottle was not to blame before. This is simply a bland IPA. I'm curious about the reasoning of building such a mild beer at such a sizeable ABV. Exceedingly tame aroma with gentle notions of pine, citric and tealike hops. Taste is similarly frustrating; this stuff is lacking in any defining characteristics. Primary aroma and flavor seems to be alcohol. Terrapin is very much hit and miss for me, and I'm afraid this has to go in the 'miss' category. Not so much horrible as horribly boring."
"It looked nice with one finger of head, with a little lace. The aroma was a nice lemon. The mouthfeel was smooth. This beer was hoppy but not quite as much as I prefer. Overall, I enjoy very much and continue to enjoy Terrapins efforts and growth."
"O: Not bad, but not the best. Again, I enjoy the Terrapin line up, and this is a pretty good IPA. 7.3 for an IPA is pretty solid, but not overly prevalent on the taste which is impressive..."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this offering. Not quite as bop heavy as I like my ipas but still a nice brew nevertheless."
"Deep copper with blonde highlights around the edges and a soft, creamy bleached sand colored head that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Tropical fruity hops and a nice toasty graininess in the nose. Nice hop flavors here, a pretty killer hop bill that is at once herbal, dank and piney with a sturdy malt backbone. Medium bodied and creamy with a long resinous hop finish. Hopsecutioner is just plain good, nothing amazing here but a fine brew."
"Overall Impression: With a name like this one, I was expecting an over-the-top hop flavor. What I got was a fairly balanced IPA, that was pretty drinkable. Overall, it was crisp and went down easily – good for a hot day like we had today. If I hadn’t been expecting a big hop flavor, I probably would have enjoyed this more for what it is – a pretty good, balanced, IPA."
"Overall: This is a nice east coast IPA example but the bitterness was too much for my taste."
"Good beer. Very straight forward IPA with a medium to somewhat above average hoppiness for style with pretty good balance."
"O - A very nice IPA, hope to be able to enjoy again."
"Overall, nice IPA but nothing too memorable."
"O- Hopsecutioner is a nice beer from Terrapin. Far from a world beater, but most are. I prefer it two Rye Squared."
"cheers."
"I love this IPA. It's probably one of my favorite (relatively) locally brewed IPAs."
"D - Very nice IPA. I really like the balance in this beer. The malty sweetness complements the hop bitterness. A beer I will certainly try again."
"Overall this is a wonderful East Coast example of an American IPA. Too many East Coast offerings concentrate on the malt and yeast bill, when they could just brew something like this. Wonderful IPA and thanks to McNuts for this extra!!"
"O- A solid IPA that is well balanced with a nice citrus hop profile backed up with a solid amount caramel malt. The one factor that hurts this beer for me is with the slight booziness that affects the mouthfeel and drinkability a bit. Still a good brew and definitely worth trying."
"Terrapin's Hopsecutioner is a very refreshing beer that is perfect on a hot summer day. The bitterness is not strong enough to satisfy a true hophead, but it compliments the flavors in the beer nicely."
"-Cheer"
"Overall a good malt driven IPA. Not the hop forward beer I was expecting however."
"While I was not a huge fan of the bottled incarnation last year, this one is very nice; I don't know whether it is due to batch variation, or a result of it being better on-tap, but I like it a whole lot more. Firstly, it has a great nose; tropically fruity with dank notes of cannabis. Tangerine, mango and lychee are suggested with some very piney bitterness; the taste is more of the same but perhaps lesser in intensity. The malt is sugar-cookie like, the feel is medium-bodied and toothy with a clean finish. Overall, this is really quite good ."
"This beer poured out as a clear copper color, with a thick white head on top. The lacing was pretty sticky leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a large amount of hops on the nose, as it should with a name like Hopsecutioner. The taste of the beer is citrusy, piney, and had a pretty good malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty slick and still well carbonated. Overall this beer was pretty enjoyable. I would drink it again for sure."
"I now have a reason to visit Georgia!"
"5.8/10"
"Thank you to Terrapin for making a great beer."
"O- Overall a very nice IPA and one I would pick up again when traveling to GA."
"MF- Nice full body, but crisp at the same time. Good amount of carbonation let the flavors coat the mouth and make it last."
"Overall - good solid everyday offering from a very solid brewery."
"D/O- Can an IPA be easy drinking at 7.3%abv? If so, put this one in that category. Nothing stands out flavor-wise but solid none-the-less."
"Typical hoppy taste that comes with India Pale Ales. My pension for the more mild wheat type beers leaves me unimpressed with this one. Could I pick this one out of a line up from Sierra Navada by taste? I don't think so. The more I drink of this the less it impresses me. I then poured it into a glass to open up the boquet. Once poured into the glass it had a sweeter smell, and a sweet initial taste followed by the hoppiness after taste. The one good thing this Georgian beer has going for it is that 7.3%ABV."
"Hopsecutioner is definitely good and definitely worth a try. I will certainly never forget it simply because of the label art. If this were labeled ""Tonberry Ale," it wouldn't be a stretch (except for copyright laws)."
"From notes. Tasted from a bottle obtained in a trade. The pour is clear amber orange with a medium head that quickly dissipates to leave a bit of bubbles on the top and around the collar. Nose is bitter orange and grapefruit hops with some bread malt and a hint of soy sauce. The flavors of this beer are very well balanced. The hops offer much more fruitiness than the nose would have suggested with more fresh citrus and even some tropical fruits coming through on the palate along with a very nice caramel and bread maltiness. The body is medium with a sticky texture, average carbonation and a nice long finish where the bitterness from the hops kicks in very nicely."
"D- Hopsecutioner is a good ipa that is completely tuned in to a malty ipa with a good hop presence. I would try again"
"You can't go wrong with this one. Definitely worth a try..."
"O - Pretty good, but a little 1 dimensional. Clean, dry, and refreshing, it holds its own against many other IPAs, but it really didn't wow me."
"O - Good or better from start to finish, really like this brew as a go to beer!"
"O: A solid IPA and seeing as this is my first Terrapin experience, I'll be gladly going back for more. A really nicely constructed beer and one I could easily kick back a sixer of in a session."
"Overall: A nice beer; it’s interesting. Can’t say I have ever had an American IPA that tastes like this before… Terrapin is a great brewery and this beer is a solid offering, but it is a bit rough around the edges. It’s an American IPA that wants to be a DIPA. Regardless, I still like the beer and would buy another 6 pack of this beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would happily have another."
"Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 3.5/5"
"Cheers to Terrapin! And back to my live action roleplay..."
"I thought it was a clean, crisp easy to drink beer with a medium amount of carbonation. I thought it was a good IPA and I would defiantly pick it up again if I ever had the chance to."
"O - Overall, if I had to pick a ""go to"" beer, this would be it. Will be a staple in my fridge for many years to come."
"-JH-"
"I am not a big IPA fan, but this was really good. The hops are not too overwhelming and the flavors mix together nicely. I will look for this again."
"May be a bit mild for those expecting something more bitter, but I have no complaints."
"Wierd label art with a sort of ""teenage mutant ninja turtle"" chopping hops in a guillotine. Bright copper with a small head that diminished quick and clung quite well. Nice mostley pine smell some citrus in the background. Taste is big hop (citrus and pine, but this time citrus dominating) and some mild sweetness. Malt does actually come through a bit. Had to check the ABV on this one when I felt some warmth. Alcohol taste is far from boozey and really adds to this one. Linger sticks around for a while. Carb is super sharp and mouth wateringly refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium making it pretty drinkable. I will seek this out again."
"The taste isn't quite as hoppy as I'd thought from the big nose full of American hops. The bitterness is nonetheless very pleasant. Citrusy notes, sweet malts, and a grainy texture round out this solid brew. The beer is medium bodied with a slick an grainy mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good. A pretty decent IPA."
"Not the best IPA I have had in the last month but I had no problems disposing of the six pack. Would do it again, especially if I saw it on tap."
"Solid IPA- on the hoppier side but nothing out of control. I would check this one out again."
"D- Overall this was an ok beer. I felt its flavors werent too complex or balanced. this just didn't have the wow factor for me. I love terrapin beers and will give this another try sometime. but my first thought was its ok."
"D Kinda watery honestly and that alcohol too. Overall not a big fan but hey better than a lot of other stuff. Just doesn't have anything special going on"
"Overall: This is a pretty good ipa. Aroma is ts high-point, flavor and mouthfeel are alright. If I was able to get this beer in Mass., I probably would pick it up ever once in a while, it is enjoyable and has nice drinkability."
"Light to medium mouthfeel, that drinks fairly easily. Overall, it's a solid IPA."
"I liked this beer but it's not one of my favorite IPAs. It could have used some more hops in my opinion."
"D - Nice Carbonation, well balanced. No bitter aftertaste."
"Overall, this was a very good beer. I'm starting to think that maybe it wasn't exactly very fresh even though it was before the best by date of the second week in August. Very flavorful and easy to drink. I would love to get my hands on some more"
"Amber copper color with thin creamy head that leaves sea foam lacing. The smell is of citrus and pine, grapefruit and orange, some caramel notes. The taste is mild, with pine and citrus riding on top pale and caramel malts. Simple, refreshing and easy to drink. Not over the top, but definitely on the hoppy side. Very nicely balanced and refreshing."
"O: A very solid IPA, I've heard good things about this beer, and all in all, I conquer. It's a little heavier on the hops than balanced, so I definitely recommend this to hop heads. Better than many imperial IPA's out there."
"D: A subtly hopped, balanced IPA. Nothing in your face about this. It is easy drinking. Drink it if available, but not sure I'd go out of the way to get it"
"A perfect summer pour."
"D: Hops take a center-stage, but aren't overwhelming. Alcohol is well-hidden, overall good East coast take on IPA."
"Overall, a pretty damn good IPA. A lot of bitterness while still incorporating a lot of good fruity and sweet tastes."
"Dare I say my personal favorite IPA?"
"O - Really enjoyed this one. It strays a fine line between an IPA and a DIPA. Glad I picked up a six but could only do one for each sitting."
"A fine IPA overall, though I'd prefer a slightly different balance of flavors. In any case, I'm glad to have tried it, and would probably have it again given the opportunity."
"Good stuff, easy drinking and nice on draft."
"cheers"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall a good IPA. Definitely in the upper half of my IPA range."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish on the beer is medium full. This a good IPA has a nice balance of flavors."
"D - The beer is a little boozy, so tough to drink more than 1 at a time. But very tasty none the less. As far as local brews, I like the Sweetwater IPA better. But good none the less."
"A very drinkable IPA. Nothing too over the top. Good balance overall. This a beer I will always revisit."
"Terrapin's Hopsecutioner, 12oz's into a 0.3L DollarTree Tulip (Yeah, we rich over here). Pours a delightful amber shade not typical for an IPA, with a 1/2"" bone white head. Smells of cascades without a doubt, floral and aromatic. For some reason this beer has a different level of hoppiness in the taste every time I try it. Tastes somewhat sweet this time around, with pale, light crystal, and a slight touch of biscuit malts making themselves known. On the swallow the aromatic cascades really march through causing quite a pleasant aftertaste. Bitterness is medium, and makes me wonder if they're substituting hops for this brew on a regular basis. I suspect galena or columbus are providing the IBU's for this brew but hey, I could be wrong. Standard IPA here this time around, maybe I'll grab one of the old bottles in the Jail Cell and see whats goin on with it. Overall, a usual from Terrapin's stable of brews, not the best, and definatly not the worst. $8.99 per 6pk @ Kroger makes this an affordable beer to bring home to the battle axe. =P Cheers!"
"O- A good, solid beer definitely drinkable. A nice uplifitng surprise."
"I'm confused by the labels: the Terrapin is almost a Teenage Mutant Ninja, but dressed as executioner. The country-boy Terrapin of the Rye ale: marketing is a little off to me, but what do I know. I'm not from Georgia but just passing through Atlanta. Label reports the beer was brewed at Flying Dog."
"D- Overall, a unique IPA. I've had only two Terrapin beers so far, but they both have a similar pleasant twang that seems to me to be the ""house character"" at this point. I have a few more Terrapin brews in my fridge, so I will soon find out if my assumption is correct."
"It had a good amount of carbonation which makes me think medium, and it was easy to get down. The after tase would keep me from buying a six pack, but I had no problem getting this one down."
"When I want a strong Hop IPA this is what I go to..."
"This is an excellent ale. Very liberal amounts of hops but also a competent malt balast. As 'balanced' as a proper American IPA can get."
" Bottom line: I like, I would buy/consume again, so it's good, but I expect more, particularly for a brew with a bad-ass name like Hopsecutioner."
"O/D - A very complex and interesting beer. Stronger abv, but overall well hidden. Not filling, somewhat easy drinking. More of a winter/cold beer than a summer."
"D: The first sip of this beer offers a minor shock to the palate as unconventional flavors rush to be tasted first. Once some opportunity to acclimate to this beer is had, it becomes very pleasant and interesting--just unorthodox by typical IPA standards. The candy sweetness is a highlight if one is in the mood for a sweet IPA, reminding of Alpine's Pure Hoppiness. Carbonation was perhaps the biggest issue outside of the unexpected flavor profile, with the lack of it causing the beer to dwell on the palate more heavily than it should. Since that could be due to mis-handling at the point of service, the shortcoming is not reflected detrimentally in the score here."
"O: This is good but unmemorable and certainly not worthy of the name ""Hopsecutioner."" It is similar to Anchor Liberty Ale in that it is between the IPA and APA styles."
"O- A very flavorful brew, drinkable considering the high ABV, and something I would like to have access to in my area. I will keep an eye out for it whenever I head south."
"Definitely want to try this again to see if it was maybe a case of a bad bottle."
"Having medium carbonation and body, along with having a wonderful balance between the bitterness of the hops and malt sweetness, make this beer very drinkable and easy to enjoy."
"Good beer, I like it. The aroma is somewhat unique which is cool"
"Overall, this was a very good IPA. I wish there was a 4.25 ranking, becasue I see I have it as half 4.0 and half 4.5."
"Overall this is a good beer to go all night with and enjoy all its charactoristics in mass quantities."
"This pours golden orange with a nice 1 1/2 fingers of head. The smell is rich with malt and citrus hops. The taste is malty, crisp and hoppy at first. There is a little bit of bitter booziness that follows. The alcohol taste in this is a negative for me since it is only a 7.3%...i've had many other beers with ABVs in that range that aren't as obvious. It also has some cereal flavors that I don't love. I would call this a medium body, and not my favorite IPA."
"The mouthfeel was good; I am enjoying this beer after a day of working in the yard, and loving it!"
"A good beer that is not overpowering in either hop bitterness or alcohol."
"O - Overall not a bad got to beer for the weekend if you are a hop fan(addict), but I would caution you, this is a session hopped beer, to be enjoyed over a good conversation, not one to start the night out on."
"O: A good solid drinker, but for a brewery that has the reputation Terrapin has, this IPA needs to be tweaked a bit...."
"Thumbs up."
"Taste is not as hop like as expected. Its there, but not strong enough to fit the name. With that said, this is an amazingly smooth beer! I wish I had access to this brew on a regular basis, another would be great! Cheers"
"Somewhat a local beer, being it is from Georgia. One finger pure white head of medium dense foam, leaving a good clinging lace. Color is a 11 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is almost pure grapefruit, but there are traces of orange, lime, and pine. Taste is clean and refreshing. Grapefruit, lemon peel, lime, orange, tangerine, and pine nut. If you like the flavor of hops, this brew is for you. Mouthfeel is a little lacking, quite full and creamy, but leaves a pretty dry feeling on my tongue and back of my soft palette. Yes I will buy this again and I am glad I bought the six pack."
"Great IPA - get it fresh as I intend to"
"This is an easy drinking beer that's fairly well balanced. I thought the aroma was odd, but the flavor is nice."
"Pours a medium copper color w/ an off white two finger head that quickly goes away. The smell is that of tropical fruit mostly. The taste is interesting. I get apricot, hops, orange, lemon, grapefruit.... but there's something missing. Maybe a little more malt, but that's my personal preference. Mouthfeel is good- pretty smooth finish, and aftertaste goes away fairly quickly. Drinkability is high- This one goes down pretty easy, and you could have 2 or 3 no problem in one session. A good, but not great IPA. Glad I tried this one out..."
"D: Very good IPA, enjoyed the hoppy feeling throughout. High alcohol volume, but drinks like a 4%."
"The hopsecutioner name is not deserving of this beer. It just does not deliver. The hops are there, but they aren't enough to slay even a semi-hop head like myself. I still think this beer is good, but compared to the hops in a bottle of West Coast IPA, this is laughable."
"D- Great brew and an easy drinker if you are a hop head! Hop heads rejoice, this is a great hoppy beer!"
"D: an average beer with tons of hops bitterness, but none of the floral citrus notes. Not well balanced. I would not buy this.f"
"Overall I think it is a decent beer but not true to the style it is said to represent. If you like your beer on the maltier side you could probably drink a few of these despite the alchohol content."
"D: I wish the aroma was better on this, but it's still a pretty good beer."
"my guess= an APA"
"Single, twelve-ounce copped from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield. Surprised to see this one there. A super-hopped IPA; classic aromatic aroma and taste bursting with orange peel, clementines, and tangerine nuances. Hopped-up to the max, with a noticeable floral presence as well. This is my rendition of a solid American IPA; high ABV yet alcohol well-masked. I liked this beer; rich, flavorful and satisfying. Great stuff. Recommended."
"D- Considering this bad boy is 7.3% alcohol, but drinks like 4.5%... VERY drinkable! I could put down 3 or 4 of these because they are so smooth, then get kicked in the face with a buzz. This is a great IPA on the lower end of the IBU scale in today's IPA race. What really appeals to me with this beer is that it is more of the floral/grassy type of IPA. I tend to like the citrus/fruity IPAs almost exclusively."
"D - this is a beer I have wanted to try for a while now. Really good earthy ipa that smells dense and tastes delicious. Another great one from Terrapin!"
"D-Well I went through 4 of these during trivia night so I'd say it's pretty drinkable, an exceptional beer, full of a couple surprises, that I'll definitely be having again."
"D: Although dry and slanting toward bitter over flavor or aroma hops, it's easy to quaff."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light but the beer isn't that easy to drink. Really sweet malt without a lot of balance from the hops presence. Overall, I think a pretty weak IPA and one that I would not pursue again. "
"Drinkability is good. It's crisp and clean and goes down smoothly. Balanced enough for multiple pints without the hops catching up with the palette. I'm actually surprised to see that ABV is 7.3% on this one because it sure doesn't drink like it."
"D: Not one of my favorites. If you really like hopsy APA's or IPA's, this might be right up your alley. It wasn't up mine."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, with very light carbonation and a medium body that leaves a slight bitter finish. High drinkability, as this is one easy beer to put down."
"Drinkability (3.5): This one isn't as good as I remember from the beer fest. It's just an average IPA and it could use some more body and character to the hop flavor. I could drink more than one of these, but it's a little high in alcohol so I probably wouldn't drink more given the quality."
"M - Thin bodied and decent carbonation."
"M/D - thick, almost like one of them x-treme beers, but not quite. Not tough to drink, but terrapin makes a lot of better beers and there are a lot of other ipas who hit my tastes better."
"D: Hops take a center-stage, but aren't overwhelming. Alcohol is well-hidden, overall good East coast take on IPA."
"umm. Wow. Not quite sure how to describe this one. It's like a watered down versuon of the Dogfish 60. Not even the 90, but the 60 . It's a fairly smooth for a 7.3% IPA, but not the best! If you're thinking of drinking this beer, go with a Dogfish 60 instead. If you're looking for a real high gravity IPA, with lots of flavor...go with the Dogfish 90."
"Drinkability is actually pretty good considering I could have this again for its fruit characteristics."
"Poured a golden color with a small head and lots of lacing. It smelled of piney hops but was not very distinct. Taste was sweet and then the wallop of hops that I expected. A very good taste, that lasts, but nothing much different from other good IPA's. I could drink at least 2 of these, but with the strong hop aftertaste, that would probably be it. Definitely a solid IPA."
"Overall a great IPA. I'm glad it's readily available here in the ATL."
"Both the mouthfeel and drinkability are good, there's nothing to really fault it for here on either of these aspects. A solid IPA that can be a very good value, I can get sixers of this for 8 bucks if I look hard enough. Very solid and rather delicious, although not standout in any way."
"D: Goes down pretty easily, but the lingering bitterness is a bit off-putting."
"Yes, you can smell those nice green resin hops that I just love to smell when I crack open an IPA. The smell vaguely reminds me of the Stone IPA. I can tell this is going to be good. Upon the first sip the sweetness of the nice roasted malt hits you up front and then the green apple, citrus, pine hop flavors come into play leaving a long nice bitter dry finish. I love the potent resin like effect some IPA's give. This reminds me of a West Coast IPA actually. You can tell they put some different strains of hops in here too not just one dimensional at all. It also reminds me of the Samuel Adams Latitude 48 which you can take as a good or bad thing but to me I like that beer very much so its a good thing. Very well crafted beer. This is my first Terrapin and now I would like to try all of their product line... that tells you something right there. The thing that sets this apart from the regular East Coast IPA's like Latitude is that it has that potent resin like finish as I said before with a nice hop bite... plus the alcohol is very well masked at 7.3 so this beer will give you a buzz. I actually like this better than some West Coasters and will now hold a spot as one my favorite beers."
"Not bad. Definitely better than most. Still, not quite on par with Bell's Two-Hearted Ale or Anderson Valley's Hop Ottin'."
"Poured out an orange-reddish amber with minor head and left minimal lacing. Smells pretty malty at first, hops make their way into the nose with some grapefruit, pine and a bit o citrus. Tastes very balanced. Nice and chewy on the palate, some sharp and spicy pine blends in with a touch of sweetness from the malts, aftertaste mingles the grapefruit and citrusy characteristics nicely, while the moderate carbonation level leaves a nice tingling sensation on the tongue. Just a touch of hoppy bitterness with each sip, body is fairly hefty on this one, no sign of alcohol that I could notice, even with the 7% + abv. A darn good IPA from the folks at Terrapin, drinkability is up there for sure."
"(Drinkability): This IPA is decent, but not amazing. The grapefruit flavor throws it off a bit me for me, but that said, it is completely drinkable and I wouldn't argue if someone placed a glass of it in front of me."
"Drinkability: Don't know how often I would go back to this one. That being said, I wouldn't complain if it were being served."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a very clear orange-golden color. No head, but given that it was on-tap, I can't fault the beer with any degree of certainty. An attractive beer in any case, good lacing as well. The smell is somewhat subdued, some fruity hops, not just confined to citrus fruitiness either. It hits the tongue with a nice varied hop fruitiness (grapefruit, maybe some lemon & apple), followed by some very subdued malt sweetness. Nothing lingers on the finish. It's very refreshing and dangerously drinkable, but a little underwhelming overall. It's pleasant, but not overly interesting or complex. Great entry-level or session IPA."
"Another terrific Terrapin beer."
"This is a very drinkable IPA. The hops are very apparent in the aroma, and it's surprisingly smooth. The 7.3 percent ABV can sneak up on you. I wish the flavor had been a bit more hoppy."
"For such a cool bottle label, it was a little disappointing. I have had better."
"Well, I suppose I expected a little more. Now granted this wasn't the freshest batch, I still don't think I'd be super impressed if it was fresh. I'm still looking forward to trying more from Terrapin. It's just that in the world of IPAs, there are too many better offerings."
"D- Highly drinkable. A great IPA"
"Drinkability: The bitterness is solid but it doesn't kill you. And the hops are bright but they don't overwhelm. There's just enough malt in the balance; and the alcohol is well-cloaked. Readily drinkable."
"backend, good example of the style"
"Verdict: A very good IPA and a great Terrapin product. I would recommend this to just about anybody."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a slightly creamy amount of carbonation."
"Poors a nice copper color with some sticky lacing, but very little head. Notes of pine and feint citrus come through in the nose. The flavor is well done with a large dose of bitter hops almost all the way through. The bitter is balanced by a touch of malt sweetness. Medium in body. Overall a solid IPA. I wish Terrapin distributed up north!"
"Overall a nice beer. I'm in NC trying to get a taste of brews I can't get in MN. Terrapin heen solid but nothing terribly impressive"
"Reviewed on 5/29/2010. 12 oz. bottle thanks to Tsotsi. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of caramel malt, floral hops, toasted malt, light citrus notes. Flavor of caramel malt, light hop oils, citrus. Tasty, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"American IPA's are a really good type of brew. This was a well pitched brew with a lot of great hop notes. I enjoyed this one for sure. Thanks to BeerFMAndy for this one."
"Recommended"
"For the hop heads this is a very refreshing beer. It is golden/ deep straw in color with a head between a quarter and half inch. Upon smelling I got noted of pine/grass and citrus. Great tasting hops with notes of grass and citrus. The bitterness is not overpowering and is balanced nicely with the other natural flavors of the hops. It is a smooth IPA with a great mouthfeel. This one is in my top 5 IPAs and I am always happy to come back to it whenever I get a chance."
"D-Creamy mouthfeel, but not too thick. Very drinkable. I'd drink two in one sitting, but then the 7.3 ABV would be enough. Would probably score higher, but just reviewed this directly after reviewing a DFH 90 minute IPA, which was so delicious and clearly a bit superior."
"i have a few more bottles so i might need to change this review"
"(Fidy)"
"D: Overall a decent IPA. Hard to discern this from the million others though."
"M - Much creamier then most great IPA's. Bitterness not of set, but opposed by a malt foundation that is defiantly noticeable. Nice carbonation supports this beers crisp finish. I enjoyed this beer at an ice cold serving temp, for me, perfect for a very serious IPA."
"The mouthfeel is thinner than expected and a little oily. At 7.3%, this is a well-balanced and exceedingly smoothy IPA that I could drink several of in a sitting."
"Overall, this is one incredibly well-balanced IPA. It has a few rough edges, but the balance is what makes it a heck of a drinker. What hinders drinkability, though, is the relatively high alcohol content, which at over 7% by volume is on the upper end of the spectrum, reaching almost for ""Imperial"" status. Still, this is certainly one of the more well-balanced IPAs in the Southeast, for certain."
"D- Like it. Don't love it. Don't hate it. Just like it. It is a solid beer from what I can enjoy from it. Almost run of the mill, but overcomes some set backs to shine a bit brighter than other IPAs out there. Comes in a bit more alcoholic than I'd like, which does seem to taint the edges of certain flavors. I wouldn't be averse to drinking this again, but I won't be searching it out any time soon."
"Mouthfeel left a bit to be desired - I think it could've benefited from just a bit more carbonation, but overall a more than solid beer, and something I would definitely drink again."
"D- this is tasty and drinkable for sure but in the vast sea of aipa in this world this one is more middle of the pack then a stand out. Ill look to try it on draft and hope for a fresher hop profile."
"D- this one was too bitter for me. But I hate to drop it down as it is as advertised...Hop Heads unite....this is your beer but not mine."
"I poured this 12oz bottle into a shaker pint. It poured a dark amber to copper with very little white head that didn't stick around. Decent, not great, slippery lacing. Smell is mostly citrus and pine, not overpowering. Well, like others have said, the name is misleading. Not the strong bittering hop flavor you would expect but is rather a bit sweet. The mouthfeel is thin and it doesn't feel well put together. It is easy enough to drink as it's not overly hoppy and it hides the ABV very well but it is just not well put together."
"D - A slightly understated but exceptionally well crafted American IPA... Well balanced and proof that IPAs do not need to be ""hop bombs..."" I could enjoy a couple of these and can easily see myself investing in a six pack every now and again..."
"Cheers!"
"The name oversells the hopping just a bit. A bit malty with a broad hops bittering that called to mind a more English IPA style than APA. Finish was just a bit dry with some lingering herbal notes. A nice enough beer, but falls a little short of the hop fix one anticipates."
"A good beer but nothing out of the ordinary."
"D - This beer looks and smell great but then sip into the realm of just being average good but not good enough to make me want to buy again"
"D: Not a world-beater, but it's a perfectly acceptable IPA."
"Although I am sensitive to the taste and smell of alcohol, I didn't detect the high ABV."
"Another great beer from Terrapin."
"pours a nice copper color with not much head but did have a fresh collar..smell is malts and lots of hoppy tropical fruits with a biscuit spice background..taste is hops of a tropical nature,,with a good bitter profile that is rounded out with spicy malt bread taste ..mout feel is medium plus with loads of flavor and just moderate carbonation..drank several of these last weekend..very good"
"Medium body, long bitter hop finish. Definitely for hop heads only here. I like this one. It was made for me, but I didn't lose my hop head over it, hopsecutioner. My hop head is still holding strong."
"not really a session beer...and not much lacing...if you want a session from these guys get the rye pale ale"
"D-Good stuff with a lovely building sweet orange taste that gets better and better with each sip. Tasty for sure, revise the malt bill to add some supportive body and this one could be a real winner."
"I am not big on IPAs or very ""hoppy"" beers, but the hopsecutioner, with its crisp and fruity taste is extremely refreshing. Very nice drinkability. Has a slight alcohol finish to it but actually blends well with the hoppy aftertaste. Pretty good taste considering my preference in beers."
"Drinkability- good finish. Having another now."
"D: If I had drank this a year or so ago I would have given it a higher score. I'm not IPA expert, but I know what I like. I like this one, but I've had so many better ones during my beer drinking adventure that this one is simple above average. The mouthfeel bothered me the most, but I did really like the flavor. Thanks again to a generous BA for hooking me up with this."
"D: Quite drinkable despite the surprisingly high ABV. Wouldn't mind if Terrapin was to come to North Texas."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but the sweetness get a bit cloying after a while."
"Pours a dark amber color with a slight frothy head which gives way to little or no lacing. The aroma is of piney hops with hints of citrus hops as well. The taste has a piney hop backbone with hints of citrus hop bite at the end. It is hard to get a malt taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is an easy drink nothing to make you dislike the beer. Its a solid IPA not the best not the worst, the hop bite is more subtle than some and a little smoother of a drink that most in class."
"Light amber and clear. Starts with a dense head that soon fades. Fair retention. Earthy aroma with some fruit sweetness. Noticeable carbonation up front. Some sweetness comes out in the middle, but mostly hoppy bitterness. Very strong bitter finish. Lots of hop bitterness with no distinct flavor. Medium mouthfeel."
"D- Like it. Don't love it. Don't hate it. Just like it. It is a solid beer from what I can enjoy from it. Almost run of the mill, but overcomes some set backs to shine a bit brighter than other IPAs out there. Comes in a bit more alcoholic than I'd like, which does seem to taint the edges of certain flavors. I wouldn't be averse to drinking this again, but I won't be searching it out any time soon."
"Draught @ The Mellow Mushroom Raleigh: This one pours a clear, slightly orangish color. There was a small white head on it that leaves some lacing. The aroma is mainly piney hops. Maybe some faint citrus also. The taste is pretty good. Mainly piney and with a fairly good amount of bitterness. Decent enough malt backbone to it. Nice!"
"this is definitely one decent american IPA i have had."
"Fairly high drinkability. You could knock back a few without much difficulty, no sense that this is in the 7% grouping of IPAs. Overall this is another solid offering from Terrapon. Nothing you have to rush out and try of necessarily seek out but definitely worth trying if you see it."
"D- Decent IPA with nothing offensive so it's quite easy to drink and revisit"
"Drinkability- this beer is extremely drinkable to me and despite fact its 7.3 percent would make a great session ipa becasue you could so easily drink a few of these and still be wanting another because its just so perfectly balanced, it gives you a good dosage of the hops you want with out choking out your tastebuds and making you have enough, its not the hoppiest but thats not a bad thing and its may not be the most complex ipa i have ever but in terms of drinkablity for they style i think its just about perfect"
"Later notes: Caramel malt sweetness became more prominent, things just sort of blend together, nothing outstanding. I ended up lowering taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability before finishing the glass."
"The mouthfeel is odd and strangely carbonated and this weird cloying sweetness and the feel of being sick pervades the experience. This is a fail for me."
"Pretty much your standard American IPA with a little less malt and an little more hops. It's a simple, well-crafted and solid offering from Terrapin."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is resinous medium. The beer goes dry at the end of the hops. The beer was drinkable and even repeatable but not Wow!"
"d- i definitely like this beer, worth a shot for hop fans"
"I'll drink this again if I come across it. Would go good with a hot sandwich and fires. But won't go out of my way for it."
"Overall I'm more and more impressed with this beer each time I have it, although the additional hops certainly have a positive effect. Well worth a shot if you see it around."
"(D)- A good beer. Enjoyable and goes down easy."
"Drinkabilty - Well, its so bland, you can slam these down, but at 7.5 it would sneek up on you. This is like a beginners ipa. Theres no way id buy this again when they make hopzilla."
"Pours a dark gold color with a decent head, but I've seen better on a IPA. The smell is ideal, exactly what I look for out of an IPA. Same for the taste, it is a delicious and intense hoppy flavor that really epitomizes the IPA category to me. It goes down smooth and is very crisp. As far as drinkability goes, this is terrific, especially for an IPA. One of the few IPAs I could drink for an entire night."
"All in all, this brew seems to me like the Sam Adams of hoppy beers. It's very, VERY tame for an IPA. If you are looking for this type of solution to an average IPA, then definitely give this one a try. For the hoppy, super dry IPA lover, don't even bother. This will severely disappoint you. Terrapin disappoints again."
"Bottle. Pours a nice clear golden red color with a slight white head that slowly settles. Fairly sweet smelling with a really nice hoppy background of citrus rind. Malt taste upfront follows by a nice sweet citrus type hop taste. Nicely balanced and really good."
"A solid beer. Would buy it again."
"D) A decent brew. I'd have another one without a second thought."
"D-the caramel comes out more as you drink, but the hops lose their magic...making it not very drinkable for me. I expected more out of a beer called the hopsecutioner"
"Drinkability:This beer is one of the more complex IPA's that I've had the pleasure of tasting. It's a hop bomb that's got a lot of flavor going for it."
"Drinkability: Fairly balanced and sessionable IPA."
"Appears a moderately hazy copper brown, with a couple fingers of head, excellent lace and relatively thin retention. Aroma is overwhelmingly dominated by grapefruit, with pineapple, lemon zest and a bit of pine playing a part. All of this is held together by the typical toffee malt. Taste here is relatively underwhelming, quick blast of the citrus from the hops and some bitterness lingering, but on the whole doesn't really impress. Would've liked to see the malt play a more important role in this. Mouthfeel is thin and somewhat watery, but still remains fairly drinkable given the alcohol content. A let down in my eyes."
"Overall: Solid IPA. Nothing I would actively seek out but worth trying if you see it."
"DB- A fairly malty IPA. I do enjoy the fairly flavorful hop profile but it doesn't make me jump out of my seat, it feels one-dimensional or something. I have heard this is really good on-tap but I won't be seeing that anytime soon North of the Border. The 'ecutioner' factor is more in the bitterness than the hop flavor, which should be reversed if this beer is truly a Hopsecutioner."
"D - Not a sessioner by any means, it's a great beer though. Another winner from Terrapin, Hopsecutioner is a tasty IPA treat. It also packs a little punch at just over 7% but goes down largely unnoticed until the damage is done."
"Yeah this is drinkable, and it's a pretty damn good American IPA, too. My only beef is that with that name, I expected my tongue to be guillotined with delicious hops. But I guess in the end Terrapin still has to appeal to the masses to make a profit. Either way, this beer is solid and you should probably pick some up if you see it around, especially if you're fairly local (like me) because it's reasonably priced for a good American IPA."
"probably the best IPA I've had yet. very high drinkability due to the great balanced taste."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, nice kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid IPA that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"This is another I've been waiting quite some time to sample. It's an amber/copper hue with bright orange notes. The head was a bit thin and didn't have a lot of staying power. For an IPA, there's an awful big malt note. The hops are there, but seem a bit subdued. It's mostly citrus with some mango. The taste follows the nose pretty close. Other than the 7.3 ABV, this would be a very sessionable beer. It's super-easy drinking and, dare I say, better than Commodore Perry. The difference being that this has more malts to balance that citrusy hop note. The name had me thinking (hoping) this would be a hop bomb, but it turned out to be a really balanced and easy drinking beverage."
"D: An everyday IPA."
"D: A great everyday, sessionable IPA. Quite an easy drinker."
"Wow, not a huge 'hop head' but this really is a well-made brew. Terrapin hit a home-run with this beer. Descent nose, not a whole lot going on, but taste and drinkability are unreal. Subtle hints of fruit and spice lead to a great smooth finish. Overall, I really liked it."
"First of all, I absolutely love the name of this beer. Pours a deep copper with a solid head. Features mostly pine flavors with a solid amount of citrus blended in. Very delicious bitterness that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The malt profile is consumed by the hops, but there is still a bit of breadiness that helps to bring out the hop flavors. Nothing envelope pushing, just a really solid, drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a nice burnt orange, with a two finger off white cap forming. Lacing and retention are both average, I really would have liked to have seen this beer stand out a little more in some way in the looks department. Nose is solid (if not a little weak), a little bit of maltiness and a pine dominated hop aroma (though I can also find a little bit of citrus in there). The malt level on this beer is very nice, a dollop of caramel up front leaves Hopsecutioner not quite as bone dry as a west coast, hop showcase IPA, but also not as sweet as say 60 Minute IPA and its east coast brethren. Unfortunately the hop aspect of this beer falls a bit short. There's a solid bitterness bite to the beer, but I think some more late/post boil hop additions are in order as I had a hard time really locking on to the pine and citrus flavors I was expecting based on the aroma. The nice malt backbone yields a similarly nice body to the beer, and the carbonation level is also spot on, above average but not overbearingly high. Despite the lack of hop flavor, the appreciable malt influence as well as a smooth bitterness made this extremely drinkable, definitely disappeared from my glass faster than I had anticipated. Hopsecutioner has the makings of a great IPA, walking the line between the east and west coast styles, but the lackluster hop flavor is just holding it back."
"A very nice IPA. I must say before this Terrapin my favorite IPA was from sweetwater but I like this one much better. It has a dark amber color with a lace that sticks to the glass. The smell very nice kind of a sweet smell but with a huge hops finish. The taste is great with a citrus hint on the hops but leads to a smooth mouthfeel which leads to a wonderful drinkability. I really enjoy this IPA."
"Overall this really is an excellent beer. I've had a lot better IPAs, but not many that were refreshing, yet satisfying like this one. Having had the Boom Shaka Lager, I have a feeling they based that brew off of a recipe very similar to this and just bottom fermented the brew."
"D - Very drinkable IPA, not an over powering hop presence but blended well with citrus. I recommend this brew and would for sure drink this one again!!"
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops and a sweet maltiness. In the taste, grapefruit citrus hops and a dryer maltiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry grapefruity aftertaste. Nice hops and good balance."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. Overall this was a very drinkable and maybe even underrated IPA from Terrapin. Next time I have access to a sixer of this, there's a good chance I'll be picking up some more."
"Overall I think this is a very decent IPA that comes close to being really good. A strong, solid offering."
"D - Nicely done, although I prefer a more pronounced hop profile in an IPA."
"Taste, very good, hoppy, heavy on the malt, although the color would lead one to believe otherwise. Alcohol is up front, but not too hot. Hops and bitterness are a tad underwhelming given the namesake. I really like this brewery though, everything I've had of theirs has been at worst, pretty good. Prolly should have drank this quicker, but again, given the name, I thought it would be a little sturdier."
"Very drinkable. I got a 6 pack and I'm glad I did."
"At Sona 13, in Morristown, NJ. Poured a golden-amber, with two fingers of white, good retention, and good lacing. Smelled of pine, bitter herbs, and some orange peel. The taste was very bitter dry at first, with a very good malty midpalate, and a semi-dry malty orange peel finish. Overall, not very complex, but very balanced. Not much carbonation visually, but there is a sneaky hint of carbo in the feel that makes the medium body a little more pleasant. Tasty and very sessionable, but my only knock was that the presence of sweetness in the finish got a little much by my third pint."
"12oz bottle split by a friend. Dark orange color with a hoppy smell, bitter aspirin too. The flavor was hoppy yet well balanced with a distinct maltiness to it. Interesting stuff and I'd like to get a couple more for further comparison purposes...Terrapin is always interesting."
"Pours cloudy orange-amber with white marshmallow head. Aroma of deep citrus, wet hops, soap, and faint mint. Great taste and full of hop bite. Citrus notes, slight hop resin, faint orange rind towards the finish and light, alcohol-soaked fruit towards the end as well. Thick in body with light carb. Full of flavor but surprisingly unintimidating. I was expecting much more of the alcohol to come through but it hides well behind the big flavor. Another round of applause for Terrapin. The Hopsecutioner is a contender."
"Poured a wonderful copper color with great head and excellent lacing. Wonderfully deep aroma, with a great thick malt backing and great bitterness in the nose; a lot of citrus, with some nice herbal hops as well. Wonderful taste, a great thick malty beer with a wonderful hard hit of hops at the end, lasting on the tongue; slight citrus, wonderful grassy hops. Went down exceptionally well."
"Not a bad pickup - a solid IPA. Worth a pick up for the label art alone..."
"Dried fruit and sweet potato stuffed anaheim with walnut cream sauce."
"D: Definitely good. I think I would like to try a fresher batch, but even now it is pretty good. I don't think it is going to topple a lot of other brewers IPA, but it is certainly good."
"Drinkability: A solid if not outstanding IPA that I could see myself picking up a sixer of, especially when visiting my folks down in GA. The abv% on this one is a little high for an IPA, all things considered, so it's not like I'd down the sixer by myself ... and it's also not the best IPA out of Georgia, but it is a solid runner up, one I'm glad to have tried, and one I'm sure I'll be having again."
"I remember enjoying this beer more when I've had it on tap in the past, but I found this go 'round to be completely underwhelming. Maybe the bottled version is inferior, or maybe it's just not as good as I recall. Either way, its not a bad beer, but there are so many good IPA's out there that this one doesn't do anything to separate itself from the pack."
"On tap at the Fox and Hound in Birmingham. Copper colored with two finger white head. Laced well. Smell is rather faint for hops some aroma, not much. Taste has definite citrus hops and bitterness. Feel is medium bodied with light carbonation and pretty smooth. Definite oiliness. Overall pretty good, but not overwhelming."
"D: Watery-smooth and good enough. As hoppy beers go, you can do better. As beers go, you can do much worse.]"
"D: I had this beer from the bottle once and wasn't real impressed. From the tap, it's better. Very drinkable for the a 7+% IPA. I will be having this again on draft."
"a beer named 'Hopsecutioner.'"
"Fluffy cotton colored head that fades a bit too fast. Smell is piney and floral which is something I usually don't get in IPA's. Nice sweet subtle tropical smell. Good amount of hop bitterness upfront. Actually more bitter than I expected as most IPA's really seem lacking in bitterness these days. It is followed up by a very mellow fruitiness with mostly bitterness. All in all a solid IPA that stands up to the big boys."
"If you need to introduce a novice to the style this is a good brew."
"Some orange colour and a crowning soapy off-white head. This is an IPA, it has hoppy aroma, it has the taste of tasty hops, amarillo, simcoe, and the California C's so that the citrus is there. Good drinkability. Hoppy but not an assault, and that's a plus. One for the East Coast."
"variety pack. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mainly citrusy hops (mostly tropical fruit, little bit of grapefruit), along with a bit of pine hops and sweet malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma. The bitter hop flavors are noticable, but they mix with the fruity hops flavors well so neither one overpowers the other. There's also a nice lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and enjoyable to drink. I liked this brew a lot, I'd buy this again."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D - Pretty easy to get down, would enjoy doing more, good but not great beer."
"I really like Hopsecutioner. At 7.3% abv, it's pretty easy to drink. That being said, it may be too balanced for some. Since it isn't too sweet & has a good bit of grit, it's the kind of balance I can work with. I reckon this would reckon this would really kill on tap."
"D: This beer is easy to drink as the ABV is not real noticeable. A worthy option!"
"D: Fantastic drinkability. I would definitely buy this year-round option if I had it available."
"While I appreciate those big hop bombs I prefer my IPAs with some balance. I could drink this anytime."
"Next review!"
"Bought a six pack. I am local so it was only 7.99. Pours honey dark and has a solid india pale ale taste. Reminds me of Dale's but not quite as good. Poured from the bottle into a glass. Good head and after a couple leaves you feeling great seeing as how it weighs in at 7.3. Will definitely be buying again."
"D - a bit too dry for me, decent flavor with some strong bitter finish, i would like to try it again"
"Drinkability is good, well balanced and packed with flavor. This is a big IPA though, and for all its qualities, that never gets lost. Very nice beer."
"Hopsecutioner failed to live up to its cute hop-centric name and the clever label claim that hopheads will rejoice and lose their hopheads. With that much hop-related self-promotion, this IPA should have shredded, but the flavor and feel were underwhelming."
"D= Easy drinker and easy to have more than one of these."
"This is a true hophead's IPA, and my first Terrapin beer did not disappointed!"
"D= Very drinkable. In fact, extremely drinkability and at 7.3% abv this is a dangerous beer. I really liked this beer a hell of a lot and if I had ready access to it I would drink it often."
"Well, this isn't the guy with the ax. Maybe the guy who reads the death sentence, or the guy who picks up the severed head afterwards. Solid, good tasting IPA, but it doesn't distinguish itself from a crowd of the same."
"Overall, this is a pretty boring ipa. Mostly you get is light pine. So maybe and I stress maybe, this would be a good introductory beer for someone who wants to get into piney hops because its very light."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable beer in that each sip leads naturally to another and I've finished the beer still wanting a bit more. I'd certainly be happy to have another and expect I'll probably do so next time I find one."
"drinkability: Nice and easy sipper. Surprisingly easy for a >7%er."
"Drinks easy, not a perfect mix of hops for me, but still a nice effort, a bit pricey a $10 a sixer IMO"
"I I"
"I enjoyed this but not sure I would have it again."
"More detailed notes pending my next time I get this brew."
"D: A moderately sessionable IPA. While it doesn't have all the complete characteristics of a great IPA, it has better sessionable drinkability than those superior tasting IPAs."
"D- pretty drinkable. Not overwhelming. The alcohol sneaks up on you though..watch it"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass served a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head that left slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is citrus hops with just a trace of malts. The taste is a great amount of crisp bitter citrus hops with just enough sweet malts to back them up. The beer is medium bodied with a nice carbonated smoothness. This is a very enjoyable IPA, one I'll have again and again!"
"Drinkability? Glad I got a sixer!"
"How many outfits does that wannabe-actor turtle own, anyway? This performance pours a clear tawny amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises hoppy citrus and florals, backed by a rather sweet caramel. It's like an art deco IPA scent: yeah, it's pretty, but very diagrammatic as well. The taste holds some strong notes of citrus hops, along with a nice bitterness and a light toffee backbone, less sweet than one would figure from the smell. The body is a very light medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Overall, not a bad hoppy IPA at all."
"The intesity and complexity of hops are outstanding. It's those pesky malts that keep the beer form displaying the hop dominance that it deserves."
"Drinkability: While hop bombs are not my favorite, this one is done extremely well. Spicy dry hopped flavors upfront meld into a well established malt backdrop."
"D - I'm going to enjoy the 2nd bottle just as much as I did the 1st."
"Overall, not a bad ipa. It is super bitter. Has a lot of juicy hop resin going on. It is relatively drinkable and I am glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability: This is easy to drink and enjoy; I like it. It's not quite what I thought it would be: with a name like 'Hopsecutioner', I expected this to be a lot bolder. But overlooking that, it's extremely enjoyable and well worth getting."
"This is another fine beer produced by Terrapin."
"this beer isn't rewriting the book on IPAs, in fact its pretty by the book. but that isn't a bad thing. IPA lovers will likely find a spot for this beer in their fridge. in fact its one of the few IPAs i would drink on a hot day. and this is perfect for that, no wonder the brewery is in georgia."
"While nothing extraordinary, this was nevertheless an easy to appreciate and enjoy IPA. Nice beer..."
"Great beer here."
"This is a pretty good IPA, although it's not my favorite hop profile in the world. The strange hop aromas/flavors are sort of in the vein of Gubna, although nowhere near as strong. A nice bitter IPA though that hit the spot and satisfied my hopfix for the night."
"Drinkability: A pretty extreme hop bomb. Bitter, in your face. Still I found myself enjoying the experience."
"Mouthfeel is solid. Good oily coating after this medium body passes through. I could see drinking a few of these in an evening."
"That being said, I was quite surprised to see how much alcohol was in this when I signed onto here. This felt like a session beer but now I know better - I could easily down a few in a sitting since this isn't terribly complex. This is an alright brew all around but with so many IPA's out there, this is only worth a try if you've never had it before."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, zesty, and herbal."
"I liked Hopsecutioner, and the hop profile was pretty good, but the malt provides a little too much toasty sweetness for my liking. It's a little bit hot also, but not a bad beer overall."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A solid Ipa, although it's not top notch in my opinion. Would buy again, but more of a once in a while beer for me."
"D: A decent drinking ipa that doesn't have much to hide. In the end a standard issue per style but does warrant good regards and makes for a decent sesson ipa. Fairly solid drinkability wise worthy of repeat."
"Poured a clearish gold body w/ frothy head that died quickly but left some lace. A decent smell of piney, citric hops and a hint of malt. It is an easy to drink IPA w/ a decent citric hoppiness and some sweet malts but the malts are even w/ the hops and I can't really pick them out. Has an alright dry finish but is rather weak if to be considered an IPA. An enjoyable beer but wouldn't get it if looking for a hop fix."
"Hopsecutioner is a very good IPA, hoppy, nicely bitter but not overwhelmingly so and very drinkable especially as it warms a bit at point I tend to start wanting to take bigger and bigger swallows!"
"This beer was better than I expected."
"Not that this was particular hyped up for me, but I'm disappointed. Terrapin makes some good beer, but this isn't my favorite."
"D - Has some good complexity and not your typical IPA, definitely recommended and easy drinking."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I've had better American IPAs, but it tastes good and I like to buy local, so I'll buy it again. The flavors weren't as expressive as I would have preferred"
"D: Easy to drink but boring for an IPA and over 7% hurts drinkability."
"D- The overall balance and lack of in your face hop bite makes this beer really drinkable. You can tell this is an east coast IPA because of the big malt presence and balance."
"Overall, good but not fantastic. Light flavor that isn't as hop forward as I would have hoped. Is one I will have again, great value, but not the most impressive."
"I'm always excited to try new to me beer from Terrapin Brewing. Hopsecutioner's a pretty IPA, but it's a little too balanced for my personal preference. I like it alright, but I do believe it needs more hops and less balance. That recipe would be right up my alley. Just sayin'. If you're into balanced, well-mannered IPAs, then this one might just be for you. It's definitely worth checking out...whatever your preference may be."
"Drinkability? It goes down pretty darn quick. Excellent quaffability."
"Bottle courtesy of mntlover. Pours a hazy amber hued body with a small offwhite head. Good retention and plenty of scattered lace around the glass. Aroma features citrusy grapefruit with pine and grassy hops. Just a hint of toasty caramel underneath. Medium body with lively carbonation. Taste is deinitely of an IPA. Assertive bitterness has some pungent grapefruit, pine, and an earthy grassiness. Barely a hint of caramel sweetness. Finishes bitter and earthy. A solid IPA, but I would prefer something with just a hint more sweetness, like a Sweetwater IPA from the same state."
"Overall this is a decent IPA. I really like the color of it and the citrus dominant taste. A little harsher bitterness would not hurt but it's good the way it is as well."
"D - Is this offered year-round? I've only seen it in the 12-pack sampler locally, but if I can find it again I'd be curious to compare it side by side, one after another against Sweetwater's IPA. This is a very close contender for my favorite craft IPA."
"Drinkability: One trait I truly love about the Terrapin Brewery is that they really know the hop amounts appropriate for each style incredibly well. With that being said, I would have to say this is the year-rounder I'm gonna be reaching for more than their other brews. Delicious, well-rounded but could be difficult to finish a 6 pack. Leave some in the fridge for tomorrow, it'll be alright."
"This is a balanced IPA for sure and the hop taste is a bit more complex in as much that the hops are not as one sided as in the nose. Sweet and floral mix nicely to deliver both hop sweetness AND bitterness. The malt comes at you with different flavors ranging from grainy, to grassy, and also with a sharp kind of rye spice. Overall not an in your face IPA but definitely a well made and interesting blend of flavors."
"Notes: Pretty good beer, although the flavor is a little bland. Easy to drink, alcohol is well concealed."
"Pours an appetizing dark translucent amber with a nice fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is quite hoppy, somewhat evergreen, and just a little fruity. Nice hoppy flavor is only slightly bitter and has hints of grapefruit and just a touch of sweetness. Smooth, fairly fizzy texture leaves a nice tingle behind."
"D - I guess I was expecting more from all the hype this one was bringing but then again their ""hoppy beers"" (Rye Squared and Pale Ale) haven't wowed me much...a decent IPA that I'd drink if it was laying around"
"The Pin is an up and coming brewery in my area in terms of distribution. This IPA was a great selection for a picnic. The subtle sweetness offset the Hoppiness perfectly. Will definitely be buying more for the Summer months ahead. The only problem (if you don't like high ABV) is the over 7.0 ABV."
"Hoppy! Tastes like a bag of earth farts. Weak after taste that dissapates but the initial taste is awesome, green, fresh, a bit sweet yet not wet, with a werthers origin--no werthers chocola--werthers original dropped in the bottom for malts. Good beer."
"Overall: A good IPA with some strong points (aroma & looks mostly) and a taste that keeps me engaged. I'd pick it up."
"Served from tap into standard pint. The appearance of this brew was a pale orange with a white two-finger head that lingered. This brew also had very nice lacing throughout. The aroma was dominated by hops but not overpowering. The flavor was pretty hoppy (as you would expect) with a slight malty note with a crisp hop finish. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall, this brew is hard to beat for the price and it's availability (around here that is). It also has just the right amount of hoppiness to satisfy a hop-head but not too overpowering to scare off newcomers to this style of beer. This is my personal favorite from this brewery."
"Happy to have this about. Quality ingredients and brewing. This doesn't quite make my top ten list of IPAs but that's a highly competitive list. Tasty times."
"His work completed, the hopsecutioner exits, making his way toward his next victim. If death by beer is my fate, there are some other IPA's I may prefer to slay me. But the hopsecutioner can stand proudly as someone I'll invite over again. He may not be all smiles, but he's good company, in his own way..."
"12 ouncer from a six pack purchased at Capones outside of Philly. ""Best if enjoyed by"" dating notched onto the side of the label. Pours lighter amber, with a subtle light golden orange hue. Leaves fine scattered lacing on the glass. The head is tight and solid, with retentive powers in evidence. Light fruity sweet, and mildly hoppy nose. More tropical fruit infused hops picked up, nice flowery and r. Flavorful and quite enjoyable IPA. Picking up further notes of biscuity malts, some quite drying graininess late. I like. Solid AIPA. Robust and heady sessioner"
"Pours an amber with a couple of fingers worth of head. Smell slight citrus hops. Tastes hoppy but balanced, very delicious. Good carbonation, but seems a bit thin. Very drinkable beer, not overly hoppy or bitter for this style, but balanced and drinkable."
"Drinkability is average/slightly better than average. Definitely some flavor here, nicely balanced but not enough to warrant downing a lot of this 7.2% beer"
"This is how I like my IPAs...balanced and yet super flavorful. I can't believe this one is not higher on the hype list. I so wish Terrapin would distribute to TX."
"Although the label and the name of this beer totally rule, this is one of those fantastic ""hop+"" puns that goes a little overboard in name but not flavor (like the even more misleading Hop-Ocalypse). Still, it's a very tasty little IPA that quenches and satisfies, and I can see drinking this one often if I had it available to me regularly."
"In a craft market that is choked with IPAs, I don't see myself reaching for this one ever again. There's better ones out there. Cheers."
"D- I think this ABV is getting high for a regular IPA. It makes it a little less sessionable. I dont want to get tipsy from two IPAs. That said, the alcohol is well hidden here and this is a very refreshing beer."
"Drinkability - while smoothness leaves something to be desired, this is a well balanced IPA (definitely an east coast style) and has a real nice flavor. I could do a case of these."
"F: A nice bitterness rises and slowly fades. It builds pretty well, and with that comes some dryness. A very slight malty presence on the finish. Some lingering orange peel, citrus, a little pine, and some chewy earthy hop tastes. WIth all that is a slight lingering creaminess."
"This is a very solid IPA. A pleasant surprise - I just picked this up randomly from the store. I'd get this again for sure."
"Definitely better than the bottle I reviewed way back when, but I have found that the IPA's are always better FRESH! It is fairly well-balanced with malts and hops in the fresh state, but still the flavor isn't anything special."
"D- goes down with ease but the aftertaste is a lil skunky. Good beer nonetheless though."
"I like this beer, it has a interesting taste and it's probably my favorite hoppy offering from Terrapin. Very drinkable, I'll take three please if in for the night. No alcohol taste although there is some perfume scent. I don't know why they named this Hopsecutioner though as it's not a kick your fucking ass IPA, maybe they should of stuck it on a double or something."
"Pours a copper color with a fluffy 2 finger head. Good retention, spotted lacing. Aroma is piney with a hint of toasted grain. Taste is very bitter with some pine and some grapefruit with a slightly noticeable alcohol finish. Not an unique flavor but is certainly an enjoyable palate. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation. Decent brew but there are so many better IPAs out there to spend your money on."
"D: Well, I enjoyed the brew. I certainly wasn't going to spit it out. But as with other Terrapin beers I've had, I'm not entirely impressed with this one either. The Hopsecutioner needs to do something to separate itself from the plethora of mundane American IPAs out there. Somehow Terrapin needs to do ""average"" a bit better."
"Medium body, flavors of this beer are a slight let down. Not too bitter, hop character falls a little flat. Its odd. Second, still not really liking it. Its a little high in alcohol too. I'm just kind of annoyed by this beer. I've had better IPAs, a lot."
"The balance follows through to taste with a lasting, nutty aftertaste and soft, rounded bitterness following the malty, citrus tinged initial sip. The texture is relaxed but holds the bitterness up brilliantly for some time. Overall, another strong effort from Terrapin."
"For the style, its pretty drinkable. Not overly hoppy by any means. Fairly balanced."
"Received as an extra in a trade. Pours from the bottle a clear orange/amber color, with a bit of off-white head. Good sweetness in the nose, along with some nice citrus/tropical fruits. Nice medium mouthfeel, with caramel malt, alcohol and a decent dose of hops. A solid effort."
"Drinkability overall is very good. 2 years ago I probably would have poured this out, but now I can't seem to get enough hops. I will def purchase this again when visiting an area that has it. (Thanks Bruisin Ales, Asheville, NC)"
"It has medium-carbonation and is medium-bodied, though it is more oily/slick than chewy. Some alcohol shows."
"Poured a nice golden/orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is pine hops, dry, little booze. Mouthfeel is pone, grass, little bit of booze. Mouthfeel has a nice clean, dry finish, not to much hop bite on the end, Pretty good overall."
"Overall Impression: This is a solid IPA. I liked it better than the Rye Pale Ale. The picture on the label reminds me of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! And just like the comic, this beer kicks ass!"
"Overall, I don't know if it was just a fresh keg or what, but this beer flavor wise blew me away. I know my review is going to be much higher than the average, but the beer I had deserves the credit. I am going to purchase some bottles of this beer to further investigate its deliciousness, because it was great. I highly recommend trying this beer."
"Drinkability: easy drinking IPA. A good sessionable beer everyone should give a try."
"Amber colored beer with some orange mixed in. Medium sized head with sparse spotty lacing. Intense hop aroma preludes an intense hop flavor. I likey very much! The hops cover the whole hop gamut from floral to earty, to fruity to pine. Yummy. Mildly acidic. Medium to full bodied and I had not idea this beer was 7+% abv until I came to review it. Very drinkable. Another ace in the hole by Terrapin."
"You get a finger of eggshell white foam, mostly dense with some larger bubbles interspersed, not deep enough to dimple, weak lacing. Light coppery orange color, transparent with a slight yellowing around the rims. There's a charcoal filter, metallic touch to the nose, not quite earthy, more leafy than citric, the green apple, pear, apricot scents attenuated, not sour or bitter but you struggle to find any sweeter element to provide balance in your nostrils. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, average carbonation and weight, pine and white grapefruit, orange citrus sweetens things some but the malts remain shadowy at best. A pinch of white pepper apparent. Meager apricot, peach, apple fruit. The grassiness and hoppy bite by far the strongest element, does stop short of reaching mouth puckering proportions. Still, dry and not especially lengthy through the finish. Basically, it's OK."
"very drinkable. sessionable. but would go better with a good brat, steak fries. mouthfeel needed more body. flavor delivers, but i wanted more. something 'special'...now that hop karma brown delivers as it should!"
"D: Not the most amazing IPA out there, but certainly serviceable. The flavors were better than the nose, which I generally find to be a good thing, but this wasn't quite the ""hop bomb"" that I'm used to."
"Dangerously drinkable. I often find that hoppy brews with this variety of hop character(balanced and not all citrus) take longer to deaden my palate and therefore takes longer for me to grow tired of them. A personal preference I suppose but certainly notable. This is one I would buy a case of."
"really enjoyed this beer. there was a unique sweetness between the hoppy beginning and bitter ending."
"Drinkability: Summer BBQ beer for sure. too bad the ABV is 7.2% because for that much alcohol i wish there was more flavor. Easy drinking but obviously not a session beer by abv standards."
"Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. Simple drinker. Not great, but a solid, crisp IPA."
"Drinkability: An all-around solid IPA that I'd certainly try again. Not your average IPA, but I like it a lot and would try it again in the future."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable enough not quite up to par with the better IPA's in my opinion but defiantly worth a try."
"I am not so sure I am on board with this beer."
"M/D- mouthfeel is somewhat thin for something of this abv. good carbonation for this style and very drinkable. i would like to see some more hops push though in the flavor though, a little lacking there."
"Mouthful is super clean and crisp, very smooth drinker. I would love to get a six pack for an evening of drinking."
"Notes: Great beer, doesn't overdo anything and keeps it drinkable."
"Good overall. Not a blast of hop bitterness. I'd have another one but probably cut off after that."
"D - Worth trying. If this were available in my area I would probably drink it from time to time."
"D: drinks smooth and easy due to lack of carbonation."
"the drinkability is about two to be safe if your driving. cheers!"
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark copper color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, citrus. The taste is hoppy, with some maltyness, nice touch of citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little IPA."
"Reviewed to ""Sounds of Decay"" by Katatonia"
"D: This was delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was tremendous."
"Very nice, I really enjoyed this beer, Terrapin is slowly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Their core beers are very nice and well crafted, and their side project beers offer lots of variety and show that there is no lack of creativity."
"D: I dont know if i would call this an American IPA, as i feel american IPAs are much more citrus and pine based, this reminded me more of the english style. It was very enjoyable overall and I am happy to have terrapin in NJ"
"D- Goes down easily, but the flavor is so mediocre that it doesn't really deserve a great score for ease alone."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another and recommend this to those seeking a unique hop profile with a decent malt profile. Worth the try if you have it at your local beer store/ bar."
"Very nice brew for a spring evening. I could drink a few of these in a sitting...maybe a 6-pack. Well done!"
"D: It doesn't feel like a 7%+ ale, a good IPA that squeezes a lot of hops into the bottle."
"Very drinkable beer, would drink again, and look forward to the second bottle I have down the road."
"Clear bronze color with a big frothy tan head. Streaky lace. Pine resin smell with a biscuit malty backbone. Pine resin takes over the taste. Nice bitterness on the finish. Oily mouthfeel on a medium to full bodied brew. Another in a long line of good IPA's. 5 years ago this would have stood out, now it just blends in with the crowd. I guess we are just getting spoiled. Would definately recomend and drink again if offered."
"Terrapin Rye Pale Ale (APA) and Rye Squared (DIPA) are my favorites from this brewery. Hopsecutioner is nothing to lose one's head over, but it's a more than solid ale that any American IPA lovin' hophead should seek out. Thanks to Mavajo for the bottle."
"D= Good IPA with a lighter lingering bitterness than some. Great hop flavors are thick and heady ask to be sipped agian and agian."
"Impression: A beer I would seek out again if it didn't involved a multi-day journey."
"I could probably have a bunch of these. Solid drinkability."
"D: A slightly too high ABV to be able to classify this as a good session but a casual beer drinker could probably put a few of these back. For the IPA lover, one or two of these will be more than enough before having something truly great."
" Overall the Hopsecutioner brings goodness to those in need of punishment."
"Pours a golden copper with medium frothy white head. Slow carbonation rising to the top with spots of lacing down the glass. Good smell of strong and piney resinous hops and a solid caramel malt backbone. Taste features both strong hops and malt but with a lack of good balance. There seems no method to the madness here. They are muddled together with neither shining or proving where they stand as a part of the beer itself. Hops win with an ever present bitterness but they are combined with an incessant sweetness that persists relentlessly at times. Finishes bitter and drying, though with a slight lack of carbonation, it seems a tad watery and nearly syrupy due to the competition with the malts all the same. Doesn't tickle my tongue or urge me to take the next sip. I'm normally a fan of almost anything Terrapin puts out there...this one is a bit of a miss."
"The beer is perfectly clear, a deep orange color, with a very nice head. It is a little thin, but it kind of sticks around. Decent looking. The smell is nice - mango, mint, tangerine, and pineapple come to mind. Resinous and floral, citric and fruity. I kind of like this hop profile. And you can smell a bit of sugar in there too, from the malt. Decent smelling. The flavor can best be characterized by it's balance. Which basically means, that it won't impress you, but it won't leave you bored and wanting something else. The hop profile comes in with a flavor of underripe mango - which provides a distinct bitterness and resinous taste - with some citrusy orange flavors. The malt is bready and a bit nutty, and just a little bit more sweet than I would like - I think that's kind of hurting the floral hoppiness in terms of flavor. But overall, I would say it's got a good balance between dryness and sweetness, and it's fruity enough, resinous enough to be a beer I like - and it is very clean in terms of yeast profile - the slight nuttiness, and low esters - which I really like, though I suppose it's not as complex for it. The body is a little thin, with a bit of carbonation, not bad, about average I would say in the mouthfeel. The drinkability is probably the best aspect of this, the balance really makes this something I could drink a few of, but probably not too many at 7.2%, but I wouldn't be embarrassed to ask for it again. I think it's solid, but something seems to be holding me back from loving it."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt base with some light crystal and Carapils malt as well. The hop aroma is good. It's citrusy and quite bitter, but not over the top like I was expecting. It's more of a balanced aroma. The taste is great! It's a smooth, well balanced IPA. The malt bill is really well done. It has a nice pale and Carapils malt flavor with a touch of crystal malts for some added complexity. The hops taste amazing. Again, they are well pronounced and quite bitter, but within range and not overly done. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed IPA. I love the balance and the exceptional drinkability."
"Overall this is a nice and straight forward American IPA from Terrapin and is certainly quite sessionable. Thanks Chris for including this in our trade!"
"Overall, this is a very nice beer, though it's not the best example of an IPA. I'm a big-time hop-head and I expect my IPA's, especially those containing the word ""hop"" in their names, to be hop-forward, bitter beers. This one is not, but that doesn't preclude it from being a really nice brew that is definitely worth a try."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is on the lower side here, I just couldn't get past the overuse of caramel malt. Overall, not very impressed with this one. I wish they would have dialed back the malt and let the hops take center stage, but oh well. Not one I'll be trying again anytime soon. Skal."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. Appeared a dark amber with a short white head. While this IPA did have a big, tasty citrus punch, it fell flat at first. It took a moment for anything more than the mellow caramel malt to come forward. The body and mouthfeel were on point, but it seemed like the hop additions could be improved."
"Notes: In the battle of Atlanta area IPA's this is definitely second to Sweetwater. It has very strong hop presence, but not much else. Since it is a new beer maybe some improvements will be made. It has promise, but needs a little tweaking to put it over the top."
"D - good, a gulper here."
"D: Overall a likable brew and will def order this one again."
"OK, but Two Hearted is the same price and a much better IPA. For a local IPA, I'll go with Sweetwater which is a better bang for the buck."
"D-this is a pretty solid ipa and goes down nicely. Well bittered at the finish to give a bitter hop presence but still extremely enjoyable."
"D - I may have this again. It's not too overpowering with hops but not weak enough to taste malt."
"Score: 4.498"
"A good IPA, but weak for the name it has"
"Poured a very clear amber. Nice head with great lacing. Smells of English hops and malt, not bad Taste is a little over bitter for me, which hurts drinkability. The bitterness is balanced alright with malt character, but I just think hop flavors are not super. That is me!"
"Poured a clear dark amber with thinnish offwhite head, nice lacing. Smell: citrus rind, musty minty herbal tea, a little tropical fruit. Taste: sweet, caramel, grainy, pine, dry citrus rind. Astringent lemon rind and pine motif, but more balanced than the name suggests. Pretty tasty and decently sessionable though. Best by July 2010."
"Slightly chewy medium body that is pretty hop forward with a decent amour of piny dry bitterness. The citrus and tropical notes from the aroma are very faint wint hints of pineapple, orange peel and mango. The hoppiness is cut mid palate by a very prominent malt backbone with lots of caramel and biscuit flavor. The malt character is a bit too strong for my liking but it's still decent and pretty quaffable."
"D- Very nice session beer for me at least. I could drink these with no problem. Nice beer for well..what it is. A good settle IPA."
"The feel is smooth, not too crisp with the carbonation. Pleasantly bitter which is matched well from the malty sweetness. In my opinion, this DIPA belongs up there with the best of them. Great balance, while still showing a huge, complex hop profile."
"Clear caramel color with thin tannish head that fades to wisps on the surface of the brew. Smells of caramel malt, some sweet syrupyness, a bit of herbal and citrus hoppiness. Not bad, just not too robust. Taste follows suit almost completely, with some biscuity malts, some nice piney notes, a bit of bitterness--overall not bad. MF is light-ish, though appropriate for the style. Drinkable, a good go-to IPA if it were cheaper... wish it were more of a ""Hopsecutioner," though."
"D: I'm a fan of balanced IPAs but can definitely appreciate those over-hopped, one sided creations also. However, this is not one of them. A slight sourness was present throughout the whole beer which made it taste out of the ordinary in a bad way. The mouthfeel, while appropriate for the style, doesn't help matters here, accentuating the slightly sour hop character. I'll skip this next time."
"D - I could see myself having a few of these. It's a good beer, but not great."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a great job by Terrapin. A really enjoyable and extremely drinkable IPA. I'm really glad I picked up a sixer and I'll be going back to get another for sure."
"drinkability: one of the best single IPAs out there."
"HV"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really liked this beer and will be buying it again. It had a lot in common in the flavor with some of the West Coast IPA's that have that sweet hoppiness to them. I really like that flavor and have been looking for one available to me that is similar. So far this one might come the closest. Terrapin has really impressed me this year with Hoppy Monster and now this one."
"This was pretty decent and I'm glad to see that Terrapin has jumped in with something a little more aggressive than their regular Pale Ale. There was a little too much sweetness in this to keep it well balanced but overall the body and drinkibility of this was right on. I'm not sure that I would call this a go-to IPA or anything but I surely wouldn't turn a pint of this down."
"Drinkability is about average. A decent IPA but nothing to blow your socks off. I could drink a few of these if i had them but i wouldn't search it out again."
"D: A really drinkable IPA which could still use an extra hops boost to make it elite."
"The beer is a little lighter feeling than expected but had good carbonation. Pretty enjoyable overall, easy to drink. For having an ABV of 7.2% I certainly expected there to be more an alcohol presence in the beer, but did not find one, so that was a pleasant surprise. This is a pretty solid, well done beer, certainly not my favorite IPA, but solid and one that I will defiantly go back to."
"D: Very enjoyable IPA. Not as big as a lot of what is out there now but I don't think they were going for that. I really enjoyed the more balanced IPA here and could easily drink a few of these despite the 7.2%"
"D- Overall, this is a great IPA. Not over the top in bitterness like some on the market, but just a well-crafted IPA that is highly drinkable."
"Pours yellow orange with a white head. The aroma is resiny hops with some pine. The flavor is resiny and piney hops with a good some good caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very good IPA with lots of hop flavor."
"d - good IPA but i've had a lot better. this one just didn't jump out at me."
"Even so, it was pretty decently textured and carbonated. Aside from the disappointing flavor, this beer was pretty standard for an IPA. The texture was spot on, but I couldn't see myself drinking this again."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice crispness."
"This poured a clear copper color with moderate off-white head. It smelled like pineapple and pine with some honey and orange. It tasted like pine and orange with some honey and pineapple hops. It was fairly thick with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly basic IPA taste, but it was very enjoyable and clean. It had great body too, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. Also, the one I tried was bottled 8 months ago, so it's probably better fresh. Right between an IPA and 2IPA, this could make for a good strong session beer, and is definitely worth trying at least once."
"Pour leaves thick lacing for the head. Color is a very light see-through caramel color. Smells refreshingly crisp and citrusy. Taste is nice and bitter. Not a lot of hop flavor in the finish; it's more of a hint of sweetness. Very drinkable beer. Could easily finish off a few of these if I wanted."
"Mouthfeel is also nice & full -- different from your standard IPA but readlly enjoyable."
"Drinkable, but not well balanced, which keeps this from being a great beer."
"For something north of 7%, this one goes down pretty easy."
"Amber-gold pour on this brew with a fomay white IPA head. Aroma is very nice lots of thick flavors: hops, brown sugar and a huge dose of citrus. Taste is a bit thinner than that, sort of sweet like an Oktoberfest brew before a nice citrsuy, hoppy twang takes over. A very solid entry into the over-filled IPA category. Not on the top tier, but it is unique and worth a try."
"This beer is great I've loved it since the first week it hit the taps in the Burgh at Fatheads it was the best beer of the evening in a night of drinking on the Southside which says volumes considering your options. Aroma has a great citrus peel bouquet with floral highlights with a slight tart sourdough bread malt character. Greeen with hops not as lively as the tap version I tasted at Fathead's but it was a bit fresher. I'm sure this one is coming around in their sampler packs but the label may just be the highlight. A hooded Terrapin pulling the rope on a guillotine with a hop plant poking through the gallows. Classic Georgia based hop imagery. Ample sweetness with vinous fresh hops citrus, herbs, and pine elements play nicely but the citrus/grapefruit tropical fruits really stand out what an amazing session IPA I'm glad to be lucky enough to live in driving distance to the Terrapin lineup great beers for sure. They need a cap that will represent them better than the plain shiny golden version. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils a nice all around hop monster that doesn't overbear the palate in anyway. Medium bodied mild carbonation which equates to a very nice drinking experience. Drinkability is pretty effortless a beer that I plan to catch again and again especially on tap."
"The drink is crisp and medium in body with an excellent tingle of carbonation. An exceptionally easy drinker given the 7.3% ABV, Hopsecutioner is a fine 'first-ever' IPA from the Terp."
"Great crisp body, but not overly so. Plenty of creamy depth to this as well. Good sharp bitter bite at the onset, but there is a subtle candy-like sweetness in there as well. The finish is bready and warming with the alcohol. No harsh bitter aftertaste. This is really good. The ABV is a bit high for a sessioner, but I could have this most anytime."
"At 7.2%, I'm not sure this is sessionable but I could definitely give it a shot... A nice solid IPA from Terrapin..."
"D: I find this incredibly solid. I've been hit-and-miss with Terrapin, but I like this one."
"D: Hopsecutioner is a highly drinkable IPA with a nice hop presence that's well balanced. Light in body, but heavier in alcohol, it's an easy way enjoy a standard to high ABV IPA in a sessionable (from a volume perspective) package. Props to Terrapin for making such a unique IPA."
"D - An exceptional American IPA w/ very good drinkability IMO. A nice balance between hops a still sturdy w/ malt. The abv is not very apparent, I could quaff several of these repeatedly - Kudos Terrapin!"
"Good drinking IPA, I'll probably grab some more."
"Drinkability is fine but it just feels that this slightly misses the mark and with some tweaks or just pumping up the hops volume could be a much better beer."
"Overall this was very solid and something I could see myself enjoying many times over."
"D: i would drink more than two of these beers if i wasn't hammered at that point."
"overall, while not quite as aggressive as i had expected, this is a very tasty concoction, and it'd be a great addition to Terrapin's year-round lineup. glad they bottled this in 6 packs instead of bombers."
"Poured a hazy golden amber with a very, very thin head. Where's the head here? Smells of dank resinous hops. Pine and citrus in the front but some nice floral hops in there as well. A nice balance between the two. Not really picking up any malt aromas to speak off. Taste similar to smell but kind of reversed. The juicy citrusy hops kick things off followed by a nice clean floral bitter finish. A slightly sweet malt backbone provide just a vague balance. Not very carbonated and kind of creamy in the mouth. The crisp bitter finish leaves me wanting more after each sip. Good effort from Terrapin."
"drinkability: good"
"d - Overall it was a good beer, but I was a little disappointed. I had heard great things about it and it just did not live up to my expectations. I think it is a good IPA but there are better things out there. I would definitely drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
"12 ounce bottle. Picked this up as part of my $10.99 mixed sixer at Krugel's Deli in Wilkes-Barre. Uncapped and poured into my shaker glass. The ale appears a super clear golden copper color with barely a finger of quickly fading off white foam. No lacing to speak of. Nose and flavors consist of caramel malt, bitter, bitter grapefruit pith and juice, resinous pine, toasted bread, citrus. Barely medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Decent stuff overall, but I think the guillotine blade needs a bit of a sharpening to make this truly stand out."
"Very clear, bronze colored body, and a nice looking head made for an attractive pour. The aroma was mellow for the style with grapefruit being the predominant smell. Tasted citric as well with not much of malt backbone. I was very surprised to read that the ABV was close to Stone Ruination territory, as I could not detect that at all. The body was light and slippery, and the finish short. This was somewhat blander than I had hoped for, but made for a fine session of drinking."
"CHEERS!!"
"Don't drink and review."
"Taste is, for me, very light on hops... very strong malt backbone, almost to the extent that it doesn't taste like a ipa... certainly a far cry from a west coast ipa as i have heard this beer referred to as. Due to the malt presence the mouthfeel is a little heavy, though not real strong sense of alcohol. Very light sense of carbonation. Not hard to drink, but my level of desire to drink more is pretty low... i like my ipa's crisp, citrusy, and intense in the hop profile, and this is pretty far removed from that. ."
"Poured into a standard pint a mix of a burnt orange-like and alighter amber shade,a thinner wispy head that was gone pretty quickly atop.Big grapefruit in the nose with some apricot,a toasted malt notes sticks out as well.A little prickly in the mouth wich surprised me a little,flavors are more of a rounded hop flavor than an in your face hop punch,grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors with a hint of leafy/mint,a toasted lightly sweet caramel base holds up into the finish.Really nice flavors with a different sort of hop profile,pretty good."
"Poured out of the bottle. Slightly hazy clear deep copper orange. Sticky, small white head. Nose is quality pine hops. Taste is a little bit one-noted, but it's a very good note. Lingering grassy hops. Good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"M + D: Medium body, though I find it to be a rather mediocre mouthfeel. It's nothing particularly wonderful... crisp, but not in the wildly refreshing way, a little oily, but not a nice and slick feel. Just straight forward, palatable, and fine. It's a pretty decent IPA, and certainly something I'd gladly order on draft or buy again... not among the greatest, perhaps, but good stuff nonetheless."
"D: Great drinkability, crisp and clean and refreshing. Very well made beer as usual from Terrapin."
"D - Nice hops and a good malt character. The hop aroma is quite well developed, thought the hop character in the finish is a little bit weaker. My only real criticism is that the finish is a bit watery, there just isn't quite enough malt or bitterness to make the beer fell as substantial as I want it to be. Nevertheless, it is well balanced and drinkable with a great hop character. I've been hoping for an IPA form Terrapin for a while now and this one is quite good."
"The only way I can describe this beer is... pretty good. No more, no less."
"D - I enjoyed this, but wouldn't seek it out again. The maltiness makes it a bit heavy for what I'm looking for in an IPA, especially given the lack of a robust hop profile that I was expecting."
"D - This is a solid, flavorful, easy to drink beer. I love its intent but it needs a bit more to measure up to Sweetwater IPA as the east coast's west coast IPA."
"This is a serviceable IPA with a muted hoppy quality on the front and back. Well balanced, but just not very memorable in light of the significant quantity of front line IPAs America can boast of."
"single from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville"
"Pours a light copper with some orange hints. The smell is quite hoppy at the offset, with the few citrus notes being dominated by more spicy and floral hops. The taste is similar with a bit of spice again coming from the hops. Mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied for an IPA without much of a hint of alcohol. Drinkability is quite high--an intriguing brew with a rather unique hop profile, almost reminding me of Ruination light."
"A decent IPA that started out strong, but the more I drank it the less impressed I became."
"D - Hopsecutioner is simply a tasty straight-up IPA that is well-balanced and flavorful. While it doesn't slay you with hops, it does have a pronounced hop character and pleasant flavor."
"This one is in the hoppy realm. It is bitterly hoppy without being over the top or out of whack. Nicely carbonated but finishes stark dry. Slighlty thin on the mouthfeel but I think the dryness is to blame for that. Not a bad beer. I actaully like it pretty well because I dig slightly-out-of-balance-towards-the-hops type beers."
"D: A wildly uneven beer that I would not want to try again."
"Great palate. Juicy, fruity (tangerines?) hops with just a bit of a piney bitterness to keep things in check. Not a monster of an IPA but real interesting. A joy to drink."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Pretty tasty too."
"I loved it and wish it was available where I live."
"A good IPA, but for this combination of hops, I would have preferred more of a malt presence. Regardless, Terrapin proves once again to me that they can brew a fine beer."
"Going down the hatch pretty easily so good marks for drinkability. Another solid offering from Terrapin. Not their best beer, but a very respectable effort."
"This fine beverage got me to enter my first review. I am for the most part a hop-head so of course am familiar with countless ipa's, this one is certainly in the top three in my book. It is a well balanced, dry, fresh hoppy beer (though it doesn't say it is dry hopped) It at worst will not disappoint any ipa drinker. One would never guess it comes from the ""south"" as it has the west coast taste we fellow hopheads love."
"This is a very solid IPA and one that I was suprised to taste since it comes from a southern brewery. I was expecting a more milder tasting IPA but this reminds me a lot of the IPA's that are produced on the west coast and for me that is a good thing. Very well balanced and easily drinkable, a nice addition to the Terrapin family and one that I would have again."
"overall a solid offering from terrapin...looking forward to the remaining five out of my sixer"
"D: I can absolutely drink this. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad. I think I just had higher expectations. It just doesn't come all the way together for me. The flavors need some work to mesh a bit better IMO. The look and smell make up for it a bit though. I just see this being a bit of a heart burn inducing beer after a few of them, but that may just be me. Still a good beer and I will be getting more in the future. Do I think it is better than Sweetwater's IPA? No."
"Aroma is a roundhouse of hops - very strong. Notes of pine. Didn't really catch much citrus. Considering the huge hoppiness in the nose, the taste is surprisingly balanced - not very bitter. The bitterness is there to be sure, but it's fairly light considering the style. Again, I picked up mostly pine in the nose - didn't get much citrus. Mouthfeel is average - nothing special...tingly carbonation, and not overly smooth/silky. Extremely drinkable - very easy drinking IPA."
"A very decent IPA. A little citrus on the nose, a little grapefruit bite on the tongue, pretty mild mannered.Not much of of head, but decent lacing. Not overly anything to be honest, but a very solid very drinkable IPA that anyone could enjoy. I'd buy it again sometimes the 2nd try yield more than the 1st try."
"It seems to me that this beer cannot decide what it wants to be. It isn't a hop bomb like a Stone beer and it doesn't have a strong enough hop/sweet malt mix to be a well balanced IPA (think Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA or Sweetwater IPA). I think that Terrapin should have kicked up the hops and the malt in this one. I will probably buy it again but I can think of 20 other IPA's that are superior."
"D: I have drank 3 so far tonight, and foresee myself drinking a few more. This is a great IPA and I am very happy to have another nice option when I have a hop craving."
"copper color with an off-white head that holds and leaves some big, splotchy lacing. nose is very nice. lots of wet grass, pine, flower, citrus (grapefruit mostly... like a tanegerine flavored pink one) some peach skin and a bit of sweet, biscuity malt that comes off like cara-crystal to me. taste isn't quite as good as the nose would suggest, but the signature terrapin tatses are there and this is definitely an ipa with it's own personality. really bitter up front and minerally in the finish. slick, medium body with low carbonation. good ipa. good effort from GA."
"The sweetness that backed so much of the aroma is replaced by hop oils that are equal parts flavorful and bitter. Pine, wet grass, citrus peel, and a hint of pungent herb all work their way across the palate, while the subdued maltiness adds notes of caramel toffee and honey-coated peanuts. Body is down-the-middle-medium, with a lowish carbonation level and a lingering hoppy finish that smacks with a few traces of residual sugars. A bit chewy, and ultimately dry, but still quite excellent. Overall, a delicious beer from Terrapin, and a long-overdue mainstream style worthy of their name. I must admit, the end result was worth it."
"D- Easy drinking due to the high malt balance."
"An ok IPA easy to drink and would be easy to session. I'd drink it again"
"Overall this tastes like something you would get at one of those generic chain brew pubs, they need to work on it."
"A very nice ipa that I enjoyed whilst watching the saints beat the falcons at 3 crow bar. Will try again."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is low to medium, alcohol is hidden well. Drinkability is good, pretty solid IPA."
"Drinkability: A fair amount of malts transition into a bright, delightful hop profile and punchy (without being overbearing or unnecessary) bitterness -- it's a good IPA. Terrapin can check off the India Pale Ale box on the ""to brew"" list."
"Overall, a well made beer, something I wouldnt mind drinking again though I'm not going to drive around to find it."
"(2 person review)"
"I won't mind going to the Hopsecutioner as long as I can drink this along the way!"
"D - way impressed with this, went so well with my spicey burrito and tomatillo salsa. will seek this out again."
"good beer, but still not great. enjoyable at least, will be welcome in my house"
"I had this on tap at Taco Mac Metropolis. The beer is clear and copper colored with an off-white wet-looking thin head (less than 1/2 finger). The beer smells hoppy, more in a bitter way than in a citrus or floral way. Same with the taste, bitter and a little spicy, not really all that pleasant an after-taste. Overall, this feels like a generic brewpub version an IPA, not bad but nothing special. When will I stop expecting more from Terrapin?"
