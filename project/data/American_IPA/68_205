3.25,-8.7,3.75,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a bright copper color with an ample two finger head of fine bubbles that fall quickly to leave a thin layer on top of the liquid.  The aroma is a bit subdued for an IPA as I only get some light citrus and floral character with a touch of sweet caramel.  The taste too is a bit below what I'd expect.  While there is a malty base of caramels and biscuit the hop presence is a bit light.  There is a good deal of bitterness but it comes without much in the way of hop flavor other than some floral tones.  This has a nice dose of tingly bitterness which combines nicely with a good dose of carbonation.  The body of the beer itself may be a little light however.  Overall its just ok or maybe even a little disappointing given my expectations for this.","fank2788","Apr 04, 2015"

The beer itself is a clear copper and there’s some sticky lacing left after each sip. The aroma consists of citrus and floral hops over top of caramel malt. Citrus juice and biscuit sweetness taste up front with floral and citrus peel bitterness in the middle which mixes with caramel malt in the finish. Medium-light body, a touch thick/resinous, a notch below moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 24, 2015"

Tropical fruits - particularly pineapple but also caramel fro the malted barley. The malted barley comes through strongly on the taste - a little too strong for me - which presents plenty of bitterness. Not much taste of alcohol considering it's over 7% and the hops are over powered by the Martinez. Lingers well in the mouth.

Smell was unimpressive and the weakest characteristic of the beer. Taste was crisp and yet juicy; lots of citrus and hops. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel was good, but not as good as something like 90 minute or Sculpin. Overall, this was a very enjoyable beer paired with awesome art (the bottle was placed over the fireplace as a trophy). Will pick this up again if I run across it.","Lionhearted1987","Aug 04, 2014"

A little vanilla and toffee peer through on the aroma. The body is light, almost too light. The flavor is malty with a little hoppy bitterness on the tail.

Nice nose of citrus over a light background of pine and biscuit or caramel malt. Medium bodied with a nice smooth mouthfeel - not quite slick. Well carbonated. The flavor profile is quite complex and very nice. It begins with a brief biscuit that progresses to slightly sweet, then effervesces into a tart grapefruit against a light pine. In the middle the bitterness takes the forefront against a lingering tartness. It finishes with a bit of sweetness over a tart bitterness that lingers. Not the usual IPA, but very nice.","tillmac62","Feb 12, 2014"

With that being said, I found this effort from Flying Dog to be somewhat lacking, especially in the flavor department.

Poured into Westbrook Brewing goblet, very impressive looking brew with a dark gold almost orange color to it. About a finger and a half of head from a fairly aggressive pour. Big hop smell instantly followed by a somewhat citrus aroma, grapefruit or mango maybe? Smells great. Very similar to the smell was the taste with big hops upfront with somewhat of a mild citrus flavor, wish there was a little more there honestly. Mouthfeel is average, somewhat thin I guess. Overall a good quality IPA, one of my favorites but also not the best I've had. I consistently keep this brew in the fridge just because it's sessionable, high quality, easy to find and because I love Maryland.","maxefforthop","Sep 26, 2013"

I love the bitterness of IPAs and this beer has it. The hops are not overwhelming but you can definetly tell its a IPA. I think that flying dogs style has great redrinkability as it is not overwhelmingly bitter like most other IPAs. The mouthfeel is great and this beer has a great bite. With 7.1 abv you can't really taste the alcohol but I like this in a IPA. I'm sick of seeing IPAs with 5% abv. Overall this is a great beer and it did not dissapoint.","JasonL","Jun 01, 2013"

I probably am done buying flying dog beer for awhile. it will take something really special to turn me back around on these guys, any suggestions?","StonedTrippin","May 29, 2013"

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Dogfish Head glass, the appearance was a clear medium amber with a minimal head, small amounts of lacing and not much head retention. The nose is very floral and bready, fairly nice. Taste is a sweet malt upfront followed by that distinctive citrus flavor that I love. Finish was bitter, but not overly so. This is a great beer for what it is, but hardly the stuff of legend.","Mojo","Apr 27, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and piney spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, pine, caramel, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, herbal, bread, pine resin, hop earthiness, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, citrus zest, floral, grass, herbal, light caramel, bread, hop earthiness, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Good balance and complexity of piney citrus hops, with a decent malt balance; and hardly any cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, very crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice IPA. Nicely balanced with lots of piney citrus hops; and very easy to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

It's decent, mind you, but I'm more into the big citrus flavors of a west coast IPA. This pours a nice looking light amber color, with a narrow creamy head. The nose has elements of floral hops and bready yeast, whereas the taste combines an earthy, grassy bitterness with a slightly sweet and malty finish. There are also subtle nuances of metal or minerals, which I find mildly off-putting.","ALBuff","Feb 10, 2013"

Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose smelled of winter snow in an evergreen forest - cool, minty and man, was my hops jones starting to act up. I had a Victory Hop Devil on the way home tonight and to follow it up with this was to invite trouble. I live for trouble, however, and dove in like the world was about to end. Mouthfeel was medium and the minty hops went to work scrubbing all of those weak, hanger-on taste buds off of my tongue. Phew! My mouth was alive like not in a long time and that snake was slithering around like he knew exactly where he was headed. Yeah, down my throat like a faithful friend. My eyes watered and I gasped for breath as it coiled around my neck with its intense dryness. Jeez-O, man, I've used antiperspirants that were less dry. I was ready for another hit, I mean, swallow and so I lifted the glass back up to my swollen lips ... This is NOT a beer for the faint of heart, but given my habit(s), I CAN shoot the works whenever the opportunity arises.

4.17,17.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, orange-copper coloring with a thin, fluffy, foamy, bright white head that quickly settles into a surface cling that also coats the glass. Aromas on a toffee backbone are very complex and blended very well. Hints of orange zest, with basil and oregano spicing, highlight a hops presence that is dynamic, while still providing the nose with the resiny and bitter character people come to expect from an IPA. Smells extremely tasty. Flavors are full and rich, and you get a mouthfull of toffee sweetness on the forward tongue followed quickly by a subtle resiny profile and a little stronger pepper and basil highlight that really balance everything well. Very spiced offering, with a strong malt component that is not usually seen in the IPA field. Borderline malt-bomb, but very tasty. The aftertaste has a great balance of the malt rich and sweetness, with a solid peppery tone that remains consistent from beginning to end. The aftertaste lightens up quickly as the beer approached the end of the palate, and the finish is slick, smooth, with a touch of drying and spicing. Very unique IPA, and the higher ABV never rears its head because it is held in check by the balance of the beer itself. I would seek this out again...this is a very solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Sep 29, 2012"

Smell orange, pine, grass, and some garlic undertones. Taste is dominated by grass and garlic, with some citrus. Body is medium, nice carbonation, more lush than dry, and very drinkable. This is a nice IPA, especially for fans of a little garlic flavor in IPAs. Two years ago this was one of the better IPAs N.H. could get and it is still solid.","SawDog505","Mar 16, 2012"

Faint aroma of hops and light malt, very muted. Taste of neutral malt and a moderate hop kick. Finishes with hoppy bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Hard to pick out anything noteable, but actually very nicely balanced and pleasant to drink. Would do quite nicely in a pinch.","LiquidAmber","Mar 14, 2012"

3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Off white head over an amber colored body. Decent clarity, so-so head retention and lacing. Smells like a blend of English yeast and American hops. Hops have a nice piney and citrus quality. What I assume is English yeast smells and tastes floral and fruity. Yeast left a mild sweetness which fits in well with the rest of the flavor. Bitterness is solid and suiting. Not lingering nor scorching. Medium body, with a resinous mouthfeel from hop content. I could go for some more flavoring hops, but this is very good beer. Also the respectable ABV is well hidden. Definitely my favorite Flying Dog brew I've had.","mlazzaro","Nov 17, 2011"

The aroma is predominately a musty hop character, but a little bit of lemon brightens the dull hop character and makes this one seem somewhat light and clean. The lemon comes through in the flavor as well, but there is also more of an herbal character, creating a nice, varied hop bitterness. There is also a subtle bready malt character that balances the flavor profile to some extent. The texture is somewhat resinous, but it finishes quite clean, making it easy to drink down.

3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste lacks much hop flavor, maybe some leafy greens but most of the hop effect is on the back end.

The beer lacks any sort of flow, or smooth characteristics. The label descriptions say it best ""...bite and attitude...like your psycho EX..."" yea, not bad - reminds of an old school IPA before all the rage was new hop varietals, dry hopping and juicy hop flavor.","twiggamortis420","Jun 19, 2011"

3.18,-10.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a light amber color that forms a thick white head. The head leaves sporadic lacing along the sides of the glass. Smells of bitter hops, malt, and grass. The hop profile I smell isn't the piney, citrus I prefer in a IPA. Almost smells more of English Hops. The taste falls into the same boat as the smell. The hops are very bitter, but the citrus and pine doesn't shine through. Has a very malty backbone that kind of throws the taste off a bit. This beer is well-carbonated.

Although the hops are not as ""in your face"" as I typically like my IPAs...it is a well-balanced beer. This bottle happens to be fairly fresh I might add. I could see this being an absolutely awful beer if it weren't though. There are some lovely pine flavors and floral notes along with nice bittering hops. There is a pleasant caramel malt presence as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a crisp finish. Strong bitter taste at the end. Drinkability is fairly high for the ABV. Overall, a solid IPA.

Flavor is chock full of very bitter hops at first and its a good start to the taste, but then it kind of just loses it shortly after. Not much complexity, just a crap ton of hops on the front of the palate and then not much on the back. Feels close to water in the mouth, not very creamy or crisp.

Good for an IPA in my humble opinion. Nice citrus finish with a little alcohol punch. Not overly complex, yet effective.

The flavor starts with some good hop and the right amount of a malt base, but then gets thin to the finish with a bitter aftertaste - not in a good way. In my book, there are better IPA's out there. Maybe I am biased, but when you buy a beer, you do buy the whole package, marketing and all.

3.43,-3.7,4.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours a medium amber with nice woody orange hues and a cream colored head that sticks around forever and leaves messy lace. The aroma is full on American IPA. It is predominantly pine, but with a good amount of grapefruit and citrus. It has a pretty classic C hop aroma, and a nice one at that. It also carries a sweet caramel malt aroma that gives the citrus a bit of a candied character. The hop profile is a bit different in the taste. Still plenty of pine, but the grapefruit is a bit more white than ruby red, with more pith than in the nose. There also is a bit more of a spicy herbal thing going on in the flavor and the malt is further in the background with some grainy astringency. Perhaps that is the real issue here. It just seems to be a bit unbalanced with the hops tipping the scale. The body is on the lighter side of medium with a bracingly bitter finish that is pretty sticky. This is a fairly drinkable IPA, if not a bit of a palate bruiser. As mentioned above, it has some balance issues, but is still a fairly solid offering.","zoso1967","Aug 12, 2010"

Snake Dog starts off sweet and toffee-rich with lots of pale and caramel malts, too. Decent balance of hops, but the bitterness is mild and in the ""Pale Ale"" IBU range. Finish falls flat, as the thin, under-carbonated body is sluggish and creamy on the back of the palate.

The off-white head leaves medium-thick lacing behind as I drink this one down. Smell is of nice, fresh hops. The hops are mostly citrus/fruity to me with some earthy ones in the background. The pale malts come through in the aroma a bit also. A well balanced aroma starts this beer off well. The only criticism is the aroma could be a bit stronger. Taste is good. The fruity, earth and citrus hops have less flavor than aroma but their bitterness is not missed. The bitterness is a bit too high in comparison to the hop flavors. The malts in the background come through well and help balance but the bitterness still dominates. Tone down the bitterness and this beer is much, much better. Mouthfeel is good for the style. Light to moderate body with medium carbonation and really no warming. Nothing wrong here but I would like a tiny bit more substance/creaminess. Drinkability is good. The price/ABV ratio is spectacular and the flavors are nice. The bitterness might get to me after 3-4 of these but it is still certainly sessionable.

Spruce, bitter orange and lemon peels with a ruby grapefruit character in there cleaning up towards the end.

Very clear gold/amber with a firm head. Good retention and lots of sticky lace. Smells like cannabis, a lot like cannabis, like really, really good cannabis. Very pungent. Checked out the website and its dry hopped with Columbus hops which the only way Ive ever been able to describe their aroma is that they smell like dank weed. Flavour starts out hoppy in that Columbus way. Kind of citrusy but not really, maybe a bit of pine but not quite, really hard to pin these hops down. Sweet crystal malt flavour in the middle, which becomes much more pronounced as the beer warms up, finished off by a well rounded bitterness that doesnt completley scrub away the sweet malt.

Lots of hoppines up front, but a noticable citrus taste comes through. Grapefruit, I believe. Tastes of pine as well, and a nice bitterness is there. A light to medium body.

The aroma was not strong or complex but it suggested a decent blend of citrus and malt. The taste was also not very intense, a midland mouthfeel, maybe even on the aqueous side, sort of a peppery sweet citrus with a bready malt accompaniment. Very decent, very drinkable, very nicely carbonated, delivering the necessary quota of citrus hops. But this was not one I would go searching for, just a solid standby for the IPA lover.","Durge","Jun 08, 2008"

3.63,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice copper color with a big head from a bit of a rough pour which resulted in a big pillow of foam with different density in some spots but it all died down quicker than expected to a small sheen on the top of the beer. Nose is pretty much expected, some citrus but also some floral notes along with some odd sour vegetal qualites that I can't put my finger on. There is no freshness date on the bottle and this left me wondering a bit although it didn't seem to come through in the taste. Pretty standard malt middle but the hops are a bit mixed, I can't quite decide where they are going with the hop bill and I'm still not sure if that is good or bad or somewhere in between. At times I almost think there are very light hints of noble or english but they seem to get smacked around with the typical american notes repeatedly after the fact. The finish has a what starts as a clean dryer bitterness but transitions to an odd lingering confusion of hops, slight esters?, and that vegetal taste that I had earlier determined hadn't shown up which in fact has in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but the beer is more drinkable than other 7% ale out there.","gwood","Jun 04, 2008"

Maybe cascade? might be a bad idea here, but followed this with a DFH 120 so even after cleaning the palette the following is what I'm getting. Hops hitting me heavy after a waff of carbonation rolls off my tongue, bitterness hits after that. Love smelling this between drinks, smells a little bitter after time, but I'm digging it. Getting some light wood flavors, harsh citrus notes, and bitters flaring on the sides of my tongue, but I almost think the carbonation is too strong. Defiantly getting a bitter aftertaste from the hops here. Overall I think the carbonation is too heavy after getting through it, might be because my tongue is dead from the 120, but I don't have another in the fridge to compare later.

3.78,6.2,4,3.5,4,3,4," Snake Dog IPA is the on the bitter-end of the brewery's core lineup of beer. As would be expected from an American IPA the hops are at the forefront of the beer, but Snake Dog offers quite a bit of sweet-malt and the hops end up being downright bashful in comparison to other IPA's on the shelves. The beer pours a lovely bright amber-orange and has a nice aroma of American citrusy hops with hits of stone fruit, or apricot. The beer is a thick full bodied drinker with a malt balance twinged with caramel sweetness more typical of an English beer than an American. The finish is big and full with a lingering sweetness that is pleasing to the palate. I like snake dog because it bucks the trend of thin-body hop bombs that are in vogue with American brewers. In the hands of an iconoclast, even the standard IPA can take a different direction.","manleyphoto","Feb 14, 2008"

I wa sexpecting a sharp, slightly harsh finish due to the high hop aroma, but I was suprised to find a very smooth mouthfeel and finish.

It has a sweet malt backbone to offset the bitter hop, perhaps a bit too malty as it quickly rids the hop flavor, still good though.

Aside from that, it's a rusty-orange color with a frothy little head. Seems to be some chill haze. Great lacing. The beer has a very soft malt presence with a kick of hops. I'm not too fond of these particular hops in large amounts, though (I guess as this is dry-hopped with columbus hops, that this must be them showing themselves). Flavors here are flat and dull. None of the brightness I like in pales (wether APA or IPA). Not much character in the malt at all neither. The hops come in and liven things up a bit, right before a tart twang hits me. Seems a bit out of place with such dull malt that this sourness would just pop up and sock me in the mouth. Contrary to the pretty active carbonation in the glass, this is a bit on the flat side. Kind of watery too. Overall this beer seems like an IPA Lite so in that sense, it is easily drunk. Aside from it's thirst-quenching properties, I'd rather have an IPA with more character. Hell, their regular pale has more character than this.","goochpunch","Mar 29, 2006"

Flavor is that intense piney hops flavor followed by some malty sweetness. Pretty middle of the road IPA, not bad, but nothing extrordinary. Nice to have in the fridge often though.

There is also sweetish malt presense, along with lemon and a slight grain husk, but primarily the hops run throughout, and rightly so.

The nose is all malt at first, rich buttery caramel malts, only now and then do I get a zesty whiff of citrus hops, the hops seem to be sleeping. Or hiding. Ah, there they are, in the flavour. Although present, the malt takes more of a back row presence in the flavour, providing support and a backbone to the ale. The hops in turn slide across the surface almost from front to back, yet mellowing out on the aftertaste. The taste as a whole is pretty mild for an IPA, like the curtain on the stage hasn't been lifted yet, and all we get are the muffled sounds of the activity behind it. Hey, we paid good money for these tickets, had to get a babysitter and pay exorbitantly for parking, we want to see some action! Mild at best is how the flavour can be described for this IPA. Well, no, here's a secret hint: when you drink it straight from the bottle you do get a nice zap from the hops, it's more accentuated that way. The mouthfeel is light, a bit more of a carbonated kick in the beginning, but as it sits it loses that edge. In the end, to my chagrin, this is somewhat of a disappointing IPA, it lacks the ooomph that is associated with the style.

It's slightly hazy golden body rests beneath a frothy head of off-white that holds fairly well and and leaves some nice splotchy lace about the glass. The nose delivers a caramelish and biscuity malt that's fluffed with leafy and mildly floral hops (seems like Fuggles to me), but regardless, it's very English in nature. The body is medium and it's soft and slightly creamy across the palate; again, very English in nature. The flavor is full and bold, with it's sweetish caramel malts dominating at first; followed by earthy, leafy, and even mineral-like hops towards the swallow and into the lingering finish. The bitterness is well-balanced, however, and once that initial note of sweet malt is reigned in it slowly waltzes to a long and dry hoppy finish.

Light orange colored beer, clear with very little carbonation bubbles. Floral and tea hops in the flavor, decent sweet malt base. Finish is a little bitter, nothing too much. Body isn't all that full, just thick enough to slap some flavor on your tongue. Gimme some damn hops!!! The only difference between this and the pale ale is the pale ale has more hops in the aroma, and the IPA is a bit more bitter in the finish.

It poured a cloudy orange copper color under a one finger off-white head with big bubbles, decent retention and nice lace. The nose is surprisingly mild, with just a hint of mild flowery hops. The mouth is medium-bodied and well carbonated. There's a touch of sour (orange?) and a bit of tinniness amongst all the flowers and bitterness.

Smell is mostly malts with a dryish biscuity caramel, touching some sweet fruitiness and floral attributes with the hops, but nothing strong enough to portray a hopped up IPA. Flavors aren't as hoppy as I like but its not a bad tasting beer overall. Its mostly malts with a biscuity dry caramel, a bit oxidized and plain, but comes across soflty enough, yet starchy as well, which doesn't help much. Hops are tame in its bitterness, just a bit of a bite but doesn't carry much character or length, just some slight floral and woody dryness floating around in the finish that has a fairly decent dryness thats mild and pleasing. Mixing in a bit more are another layer of the biscuity drying malts that has a whole grain touch. Feel is a bit harsh and scratchy in texture thats a bit chalky too just before the finish, other then that its medium in body and would be quite nice if it was smoother.

A gentle bitterness is released on the finish. The aftertaste retains some of the bitterness as wisps of light fruity and floral sweetness dance in and out. This is a smooth and malty IPA, seems more in the British Style than the American style. Mouthfeel is pretty solid, as there is a bit of lingering body to accompany the playful aftertaste. Drinakabilty is very good, and one of these will not last long. This is one of the better offerings from Flying Dog, along with the Road Dog.

The finish is long due to hoppy tongue coating but it might be due to the temperature i served it at (48 F).

3.94,10.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The label used to read :""Snakes down your throat like a loyal friend", a quote attributed to Anna Steadman, the illustrator's wife?, but the slogan is missing now. It remains a true endorsement, however. Hoppy, but not wildly so . Wonderfully soft and delicious palate. At times, I'm reminded of Anchor Liberty, but it's closer to Bass in smoothness and drinkability. Much less hoppy than many a MidWestern IPA. Ideal as a session beer.","feloniousmonk","Feb 20, 2003"
3.87,8.7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"This is a pretty good session IPA. My main complaint with this brew is that it does little to distinguish itself from Flying Dog's PA, Doggy Style. The hops profile is a bit different. Doggy Style is all citrus while this brew's hops are more piney and floral. But I expect IPA's to be bigger, bolder, fuller-bodied versions of PA's and this brew could easily be considered just another PA. Nevertheless it has a nice bitter bite that I find appealing. A touch of light caramel malt shows up in mid-palate, but this brew could use a bit more. It pours a light orange amber with a white head that maintains a cap and leaves scant rings of lace.","johnrobe","Feb 13, 2003"
4.12,15.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper color with a nice off-white head. The smell of pungent citrusy hops and light fresh baked bread malt notes make up the aroma. It smells quite nice! The taste mirrors the smell with a dry citrus hop bite and light malts with an earthy grain background. It is light-bodied and finishes crisp and dry. Pretty nicely done. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 08, 2003"
3.33,-6.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"this IPA pours out a cloudy, but bright golden color. a very white and somewhat thin head appears, leaving quite a bit of clinging lace. aroma of caramel malts and an above average piney hoppiness greets the nose. tastes of bready malts and a nice stinging IPA hoppiness. medium bodied....a distinct crispness asserts itself in the finish, followed by a plentiful bitter piney hop aftertaste. although bitter enough to provide IPA lovers a hop-head fix...the malt bill seems a bit lacking to back up and balance the bitter hop load. whatever this IPA is lacking in character, i still found it enjoyable and sufficiently hoppy and bitter in profile. an average IPA, but still tasty.","budgood1","Feb 05, 2003"

3.3,-7.3,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Note: Perhaps this is why the two Bottles of this beer I had just bought had two different labels. One with a red label that says Snake Dog IPA (India Pale Ale), the other, with the exact same Snake Dog picture, is grey/silver and just says Snake Dog Ale (India Pale Ale).

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It looks like most other IPAs and has a decent head that holds pretty nicely, leaving lace down the glass. The smell and taste of hops is quiten noticeable, but what's backing the hops is minimal. A slight grassy flavor detracts from the overall drinking experience. It's not a bad effort, but it's nothing special.","mickeymac","Nov 18, 2002"
3.6,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a medium amber color with a patchy but sticky white head. Definite spicy hops in the aroma along with biscuit-like and citrus notes. However, it is not as hoppy as the aroma would lead you to believe. In fact, it only has a medium level of hop bitterness mixed with a sweet malt flavor. It is a bit thin, but goes down smoothly, and would be a nice beer in the summer while outside grilling.","Morris729","Nov 17, 2002"
3.34,-6.2,3,4,3,3,3.5,"Middle of the road IPA. Hops were somewhat present in the aroma. Clear gold with a thin, short-lived head. Taste did seem slightly unbalanced. Hops flavor just didn't have the legs for which I was hoping. I would take the Fuller's or Sam Smith's over this if given a choice.","Dogbrick","Nov 06, 2002"

3.43,-3.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"A.deep gold colored brew poors from a high colored artful bottle. The head was nice but shortlived, faded quickly.It does leave a nice lace. Stronger hop over malt but not as strong as other IPA's, but thats a good-thing. I agree this is like a great pale-ale with muscle, a kicking muscle no-doubt. I enjoyed this-one with the grilled flavors of summer.","chilidog","Sep 13, 2002"
2.87,-19.4,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Color is bright golden, with a whitish, thin head that almost vanishes in a few minutes, but leaves some lace.  Aroma is of young leafy hops.  Nose is grainy, almost grassy.  Thin body, with leafy hop overtones that linger into a watery finish.  A touch of malt sweetness in the aftertaste.  I was a little disappointed in this beer.  It has good intentions but seems a little simplistic and unrefined.  Needs to be cleaner with a crisper finish, and the mouthfeel is pretty disorganized.","bcm119","Aug 24, 2002"
3.45,-3.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"pours a deep golden color with a thick off white head that fades a little too quickly but leaves a decent lacing on the glass.  Good malty aromas with some nice hoppiness in the background but there is an out of place musty smell hanging around in the background that drops this score a little.  Good bitterness throughout the brew with some nice biscuity malt showcased in the beginning of the brew.  The finish goes somewhat watery, however, and the whole brew suffers as a result.  This brew remains drinkable but is somewhat less desirable b/c of the watery finish.  Not a bad brew but there are so many better IPAs out there that I don't know why you would bother with this one.","Murph","Aug 12, 2002"
2.95,-17.1,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"The crystal - clear light copper hued brew is topped by a big bubbled, persistent one fingered head that leaves lace. The citrusy and mildly floral hop nose is accompanied by a touch of fruity esters and biscuit malt. Unfortunately, this brew is a bit lackluster flavorwise.  Hop bitterness is light for an AIPA, and gives way to malt flavors, but the malt profile isn't distinctive. Generic light caramel malt notes and a touch of toasty malt are perceptible. Hop flavor is lightly citric and certainly could be more pronounced.  As this brew warms butterscotch diacetyl becomes discernible.  Ehh.  Finishes w/ hop bitterness on the back of the tongue w/ a soapy hop flavor lingering.  Snake Dog could pass for a decent pale, but falls short if you're looking for an assertive IPA.  Not at all bad for the $4.99 I paid for six pack.  It'll be good July 4th drinking!","marc77","Jul 03, 2002"

3.5,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Malty aroma with hops, fruit and alcohol.  Hazy golden brown color with a decent head and a curtain of lace.  Wonderful flavor, malty sweetness initially, then hints of fruit, followed by bitter hop finish.  Alcohol is quite warming.  A very nicely done IPA.","Pegasus","May 10, 2002"
3.83,7.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Notes: The flavour is like a wave ... quick to come crashing in then slowly fading back out. Nice head retention. This is a great American IPA ... good doses of bicuity malt and hops with an sufficing alcoholic punch.","Jason","Mar 09, 2002"
2.7,-24.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"So, I did a ""face off"" between Snake Dog and the easily available (around here) Summit India.  Summit's IPA represents the ""post- modern blast of hops"" India made in the US that I'm used to and like.  As someone used to a rush of hop bitter/citrus, the Snake Dog was not there -- even almost heavy on the tongue and ""floral"" at the end (more like a mild Special Bitter, but not).  As an IPA, Snake Dog is mid-pack and only OK to me...","ADR","Feb 21, 2002"
3.5,-1.7,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Definate grain aromas with a hint of fresh hops.  A light and flufy white, practically weightless, head.  Nice looking slightly hazey amber.  Mellow malt character with an odd hoppy character.  The flavors are in conflict.  Confusing signals of citrus, flowers and a mouth puckering hops sensation is in the mix as well.  Not a bad beer, however, nothing to rave about.  Was expecting something more from the Flying Dog Brewery, instead we are given a second rate rendering of what could have been.  Think I.P.A. Light, would be a more fitting name.","Jordan","Feb 09, 2002"

4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Hops get down to business right away, with a somewhat raw, unrefined character that asserts itself  up front, rather than at the finish.  Not much in the way of floral or citrus in the hops, just a 'bite this hop cone"" bittering that is actually a nice change of pace from some other American style IPAs and perhaps more in line with the traditional English version.  Very drinkable.","Brent","Dec 21, 2001"
