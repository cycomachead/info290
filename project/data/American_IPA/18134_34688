3.71,13.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Tasting notes: Light colored, fizzy, thin-bodied. Some currant/gooseberry, peach, green grass, catty flavor notes. Sweet and recalls ginger soda, much like its ESB stablemate. Dry, crisp, moderately bitter finish. An old school American hop flavor but with the volume knob turned way down. I agree that its drinkable but could get cloying and dull rather quickly.","CalgaryFMC","Yesterday at 05:18 PM"

3,-8.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Bottled 02 Jun 2014. Thanks, Shri. A clear light orange with a dense white head that falls off leaving no lacing, this looks OK. The nose is dominated by cascade hops,grapefruity, chalky, pithy and with some candied citrus. Bitterness is noticeable. A little bit of crystal malt and cotton candy are present. The palate opens with a surprising bitterness, pungent, clean, resiny with grapefruit, pine, orange peel and a little floral character. The mid palate has a mild honey sweetness, a little cotton candy and a little dough. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer is medium light in body and crisply carbonated. Quite decent.","DefenCorps","Oct 25, 2014"

The taste however was very bitter, I don't feel that I'm experienced enough in the IPA category to properly judge, HOWEVER, the bitterness and aftertaste for me was not something I thoroughly enjoyed. I'll continue trying out various ipa's and rewrite a review if I feel I didn't do this one justice but I will say they put enough of a alcohol percentage in to it so that I didn't completely waste my money away!","Matt97m3","Jul 23, 2014"

However, I think this bomber cost around 4 bucks- for about a buck less, I could buy a 24 ounce bottle of Sierra Nevada pale ale, which may be a little lower in ABV but has about the same or better hop profile and has a superior taste overall. Still, I give this beer above average marks.","archyquaffer","Jun 16, 2014"

2.9,-11.3,3,3,2.75,3,3,"This ipa advertises itself as ""bold;"" perhaps they are referring to the fact that it is an ipa, it is not dark, and it does have a 6.2 abv. It advertises itself as heavily dry hopped, but that is simply not apparent in the front taste; in fact, the front taste is curiously absent. On the backside, you get your dryness and your hops, but not the satisfying bitter back a good hopped ipa will give you. On the other hand, despite the abv, this strikes me as a good session beer, where it's lack of full character is an advantage; it's really not so very bold. A decent value for the price, but not a beer that someone, looking for a new beer respect ""wow"" will savor without the question: ""Where's the beer?""","greentam2","Mar 14, 2014"

It does smell excellent. The taste is fair and balanced. Not really over the top hops but you do taste it some. The aftertaste stays with you, which I love. A little bland for an IPA, has very little malt sweetness. In the mouth its very refreshing no burn or bite. Overall, I enjoyed this blind purchase. I would by it again but the price is a factor in that. I give major points to year long availability, which this is. There are better and there are worse. Give it a try, you will not be let down.","mreatsum","Sep 22, 2013"

You can definitely smell the hops from the dry hopping of the brew, however I was very disappointed with the mouth feel and the taste. There was very little carbonation it the beer I had and it felt flat. The taste was average and had a slightly strange bitterness to it. Overall, I was not very happy with it and I am stuck with 5 more bottles. Maybe I'll try another one for the heck of it...","Juice-O","Sep 21, 2013"

It’s nothing particularly noteworthy, with a so-so appearance, a decent piney-citrusy aroma, and a taste that lacks the depth and character of a higher-caliber IPA. However, since I can get it readily at my local Rite-Aid for about a buck a bottle, it’s usually in my fridge - and I’m a-ok with that.","The_Feebler_Elf","Sep 13, 2013"

2.93,-10.4,3,3,2.75,3.25,3,"Drank directly from the can so no comment on appearance. Scent was pine resin and generic citrus. Standard IPA scent with nothing special, complex or stand out. Taste followed the nose, pine resin, citrus rind, grapefruit rind and a very slight grainy malt. Hop forward, but not in a complex way, it didn't seem to blend well. All the normal IPA flavors were there but in an almost abrasive way when combined with the malt. Mouthfeel was light bodied with moderate carbonation and an odd, almost creamy mouthfeel. A bit light for an IPA, on with the carbonation, but the creaminess was bizarre. It didn't make it difficult to drink or unpleasant in any way, but it was different. Overall this is a standard IPA, one that is maybe a bit too course and crude in it's flavor to really be considered a good IPA. All the right elements are present but they don't seem to mesh all that well. There are certainly better options in West Coast IPAs available.","Auraan","Sep 06, 2013"
3.52,7.6,3,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,"I like IPAs so I enjoyed this more than my circa 3.6 review would seem to suggest. It is, however, when compared to other IPAs, boring, routine, and dull. There was almost no head to speak of, but that could be just due to improper pouring by my waitress. Smell was grassy and hoppy. Taste was obviously hoppy but bland for an IPA. Worth having, but boring.","cambabeer","Sep 05, 2013"

It tastes hoppy, but it could just be love. As the Long Hammer gets warm it begins to sit in your mouth longer and longer between sips. Rain trickles down the window, I take another sip and reflect over what type of malt that went into the barrel and settle on a mixture of orange and lemon. There's ash in my beer.","SquidHead","Aug 27, 2013"

Very pleasant and pedestrian in every way; nice copper color, faintly hoppy bouquet that underwhelmes, and a flavor that is sweet and malty with a light taste of citrus and pine hops without being too bitter or assertive. More of an APA than an IPA, in fact I would argue that this is easier to drink than the more assertive APA's like Deschutes Mirror Pond or Widmir Alchemy Pale Ale. The problem here is that people go to an IPA to be slapped upside the face with hop flavor, a trait that this brew does not do.","Aaron_Ramson","Jul 28, 2013"

The overall impression is not that this is that bad, however for the style it seems a little tame. I would drink it again but don't recommend this if you are looking for a true American IPA with more bitterness than your average pale ale.","Slatetank","Jul 16, 2013"

Not to be biased or discriminate, as before I knew Red Hook was owned by Anheuser-Busch/InBev, I thought I tasted a hint of corn taste. I bet this was even better before they sold out, but i'm not gonna go there.","Roman5150","Jun 18, 2013"

For its price point and drinkability, it definitely ranks higher than your standard BMC/AAL, but if I'm grabbing an IPA, this isn't my first choice.

3.17,-3.1,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"well, it's a clear golden brew with a white head that dissappears almost as fast as you can pour it. Pine, citrus, and malt notes fight for dominance on the nose, although there is no clear victor. Malt definitely strikes me as the most prevelant flavor, although citrus is a close second, with the pine only becoming apparent in the finish. The finish is bittersweet. The carbonation is over the top, but it is counter-acted by a beautiful oily mouthfeel. I feel like I am becoming more scrupulous in my reviews, but maybe that is a good thing. This used to be one of my favorite brews, but now it's okay at best.","silverking","Jan 02, 2013"

Not hardly a bitter sustain Mouthfeel is nice and a bit dry and carbonation is way high adding to an overall creaminess.

This was a fresh CAN that had been refrigerated up until I bought it and directly after I got home following the two-hour trip. Upon settling, I employed the inverted Glug which netted me two fingers of tawny head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose smelled of minty, grassy hops and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the taste was purely hops in the mouth. It had a mostly peppermint taste, but there was a nice grassiness, also. Finish was dry and tasty with the hops lingering well after the swallow. I would definitely give this some cooler space, either at the beach or on Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually).","woodychandler","Aug 06, 2012"

My initial thoughts are that it's mislabeled, but given color isn't everything and it looks good, it gets the 4. Aromas are herbal hops, biscuit, faint citrus. Tastes are biscuity, herbal hops, grassy, sharply astringent, sharp cheddar cheese perhaps. This really tastes more like a pilsner than an IPA to me; and for a pilsner it's pretty good. For an IPA it's lacking some qualities I'd expect for the style. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium, smooth and dry.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of sweet malts and citrusy and piney hops. It's not a strong aroma, but it is a pleasing and inviting aroma. The taste follows the nose. There are sweet, bready malts accompanied by mild citrus and pine hop flavors. There's a mild bitter aftertaste, but this clears up relatively quickly. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. While there are better IPAs on the market, this one is certainly worth a try if you're exploring the style.","acevenom","May 28, 2012"

This beer gets surprisingly poor reviews and I think it's due to it being on the light side hop wise for the style. I understand that criticism but it has solid bitterness and it's creaminess and drinkability make it unique. It's the opposite of a Stone selection but has it's place in the beer pantheon as a lighter hopped, smoother IPA. Underrated in my opinion.","dfwprosportsjon","May 28, 2012"

However, the smell is great, with strong citrus (grapefruit) hops aromas and fair bit of pine as well. The taste is almost completely towards the bitter end of the spectrum with very little balance, but honestly that’s a quality that I like in IPAs. It’s very bitter. It’s also very dry. Overall, this is a pretty good American IPA. I would definitely buy this again.","Intrinsic","Mar 01, 2012"

I enjoyed the tangerine aspect of the flavor but I really had to strain to discern it.","tobelerone","Dec 15, 2011"

2.48,-24.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,2,"This beer pours a really clear golden amber color. It has about of a finger of pure white head resting on top. The head has okay retention, and it leaves behind no signs of lace on the glass. The nose is a bit faint, but it has a bit of caramel malt in the front. There is a nice piney hop aroma here as well. Also, I am getting some scents of orange peel and grapefruit. The taste starts off with a decent maltiness. There is a decent hop flavor/bitterness here as well. Also, I am getting some citrus flavor. The finish leaves some lingering piney hop bitterness on the palate. This has a body that is on the lighter side of medium, and it has decent carbonation, it goes down easy and has a pretty smooth feel to it. There is a pretty good bitter bite that accompanies this. There is decent drinkability here. It goes down easy, but it is a bit on the light side and the flavor is lacking a bit. It just kind of seems like a enteric version of an IPA. It isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. I'd drink this one again, but I wouldn't pay for it.","JizackFH","Dec 12, 2011"

The smell is mild in all aspects. Light citrus. Light pine. Light malt, somewhat bready. Just not much on the taste. Falls flat on all aspects. Didn't Redhook used to be a solid brewery? Man totally disappointed here. Not bad, just disappointed. Light bodied, plent of carbonation. Really, I'd much rather have the esb. Crazy, but I think it's more balanced.

I actually really like the malt side of things; clean, simple, but firm enough to hold up to some IBUs. The hopping is what needs work in this beer.

That medicinal bitterness tends to linger for a while in the aftertaste. A little salty as well, making for a weird mouthfeel. Some nice floral and citrus hop tastes hidden in there, but maybe there was a little too much dry-hopping or something because all of these seemed to be drowned out for the most part by the bitterness.

There's really not any complexity, and almost no harmony of these 4 pieces - they all happen separately, and are felt individually.

A strident bitterness pervades the finish something fierce. Balance be damned, apparently. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish.

That's not a bad thing, especially if it leads people to better beer. The issue I have is, it appears that they took a mild ale, did a little dry hopping and changed the name to cash in on the IPA bandwagon.

A solid brew, without a doubt (imagine if this was in 30 packs for cheap?!?!!) but hard for me to pull off the shelf when there are so many other brews available at a similar price point.

Pours a dark gold with a nice bubbling head with some decent retention. Much larger bubbles than I've seen in other beers. Aroma is of straw with some light citrus in the background. Some biscuit type cereal notes that are more characteristic of a lager than something billing itself as an IPA. The mouthfeel is disappointing. It's very flat and almost watery. There's little carbonation to the beer. Not a lot going when you taste the beer either - it's almost nondescript. There's light hop character of orange peel up front and mild cereal malt finishes. Some tulip style floral notes open up the more you drink it. Think of it as a very sessionable IPA, though it lacks the straight ahead hop profile characteristics I like in my IPAs.

The usual line about a big IPA ""going well with spicy food"" is just plain dumb; a big IPA can really only stand alone -- pairing it with loud food only gives your mouth too much to deal with.

Mouthfeel is carbonated and slick, again, bitterness is low due to more malt being present. Overall, I would consider this more of a Pale then an IPA, IPA's should be balanced but still have a decadent like hop profile, and this one falls way short of that.

Redhook is one of the pioneers in the craft brew movement, and they should be respected for that. They've been a successful pioneer because they're still accessible.

The beer looks alright, golden with a rocky off-white head. The aroma is long on hops but you can tell that things are out of whack. Malt contributes very little to the nose. This beer is in dire need of stronger, richer malt flavors. I don't know if it's the lack of malt or a problem with the hops, but the hops also lack richness and depth. They have some bitter citric flavor, but the bitterness overwhelms their richer qualities. This is not to say that there is no sweetness. In fact, there is some syrupy sweetness but it only makes the feel somewhat cloying rather than adding depth to the beer. The mouthfeel is somewhat astringent.

The malt starts the flavor out, and is very dominant at the front. Then strong flavors of citrus, pine, and earthy flavors come out, but it tastes like the don't belong together for some reason. It tastes like something is just off. The is medium as one would expect, thins out a bit, and then miraculously gains weight at the end, very inconsistant.

I agree with the reviewer who described the taste as soapy -- I especially get that in the weakly bitter finish. So, it doesn't quite live up to our expectations for IPA's -- in Redhook's defense, it's a moderately tasty beer that has become very affordable at the local supermarket (thanks to A-B), and is remarkably sessionable for a 6.5% pale ale.

The initial taste is of light malt, immediately followed by a bitter hoppiness that lingers through the rest of the taste. However after a few drinks, the bitterness is barely discernable.

In the right conditions a pleasant drinker. I have to say that I don't often have Redhook beers anymore. I never thought they were the best beers on the planet, but I feel they have lost a great deal of what charm they once had.

I could easily down a sixer of this in an afternoon. Not an over the top beer, but solid none the less.","rodrot","Jun 10, 2007"

3.45,5.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A firm pour into a half-liter mug offers up a voluminous pale tan head of very good duration and lacing. Pale golden in color and brilliant, no yeasty beasties here. Nose is positively delicate, with flowery hops affecting notes of white pepper, and light golden fruit implied by the biscuity, pale malt. A lightly crisp, tingling hop bite is my first sip impression, and it's a gentle one at that. It blends well with the malt, but isn't as spicey as the Pacific Northwest hop-bombs I'm accustomed to in the style, so color me surprised. Lighter in body and fairly light on the mouthfeel, too. I appreciated a mild sweetness here, but almost would've preferred a bit more body/sweetness/booze (and at 6.5% this beer is rather dangerously drinkable*). Pleasing floral hop aromatics and bitterness linger more in the manner of a Yankee rendition of a British IPA, which I also find interesting and worth noting. Very mild fruit and vegetal notes also impress themselves as this warms, and the dryness in the finish is definitely worth noting, but ultimately I'm left with the impression that this needs ""more of something"" in order to convince me. Don't get me wrong, as this is a stylistic departure from Ballard Bitter (or what used to be, anyway), but it's getting to the point where I need to be convinced by Redhook these days (am I the only person who feels that Copperhook and Sunrye just don't cut it?) I'm also left with the impression that if they ramped up the malts and hops on Long Hammer it could make for the basis of a well-balanced Imperial IPA, and in that sense I think they're on to something with this recipe. But you see where I say it's ""dangerously drinkable"" up above? ( * ) The main problem with this beer as it stands is I wouldn't want to have more than one in a sitting: it's almost like ""an American IPA for folks that *don't like* American IPAs", hence my impression of being unconvinced.

This could be more of a session beer then most of the other IPAs I have drank in my time. Not horrible, not great.

Behind this, there is a moderate caramel and toasty bread character with a hint of orangey and peppery hop. Smells nice, just not as bold as I want my AIPA's to be. Flavor starts as a very solid melanoidan infused toastyness, moving to more caramel sweetness with a light citrusy hop that transitions to a peppery hop, finishing with a moderate, but clean, bitterness. A slight metallic bite hits, but doesn't stay on too long. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Good balance and feels about right.

Nothing wrong with how it tastes, although it is very simple. So simple in fact, I'm bored trying to think of words to describe it. I would say it's an average, very drinkable pale ale; a good stepping-stone into the world of great IPAs like Bridgeport and Stone.","Gruntlumber","Sep 20, 2005"

It gives off a pleasent smell with hops and a bit of malt. I detect a bit of sugar as well as some fruit undertones. The taste is good, dry and crisp just as the style dictates. After a sip, my mouth is left wanting more and that's always a good thing. It quenches my thirst and goes well with light fare. A few of these are easy to handle. Overall, a good beer for it's style and readily available in the DC area.","jaluria","Sep 15, 2005"

Mild maltiness is also in the mix, especially noted in the finish. Bitterness is present, but not enough to totally ravage the palate.

Maybe a tiny touch of citrus as well... but very faint across the board. Taste is rather bland. Hops seem to dominate the flavor characteristics (as you would expect on an IPA), but it lacks the balance and complexity of the better beers in this class. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, but perhaps slightly overcarbonated. This seemed to give it a little bit of a mouthfeel that is too thin.

Not too shabby for a pale ale or a bitter, but not really in on par with most beers in the American IPA style. Mouthfeel is medium thick with a decent strength.

Nearly as pronounced as the aroma suggests, diacetyl carries through into flavor and dominates, overriding most malt presence with the exception of token biscuit character. Hop bitterness is thankfully left unhindered, but itself is too understated to provide much balance. Lightly bodied, with a butter influenced mouthfeel that is perceptibly oily. Diacetyl stresses and weighs heavily on the palate. Subdued non descript citrusy hop flavor. Suggestion of margarine and citrus zest emerge late. Finishes agreeably abrupt. Would you like some beer with your butter? Although the diacetyl manages to integrate well in their ESB, it is overbearing in Redhook IPA.

3.53,8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours without a huge head, but enough to entice the lips to join it. Some, but not a signifigant amount of lace stains the internal edges of the glass. Nice copper color with a scent that's hard to distinguish. Sort of hoppy, yet not real hoppy. Maybe a little bit of citrus, but not too citrusy. This beer had an unoverbearing flavor of hops in the taste also. This is one IPA that will play well in the minor leauges, but doesn't stand a chance with the big boy IPA's such as Bridgeport, Terminal Gravity, or Stone's Ruination.","sinistersteve","Sep 11, 2002"
2.87,-12.2,2.5,3,3,3,2.5,"This Redhook product has a problem.  It is not as good as a quality micro or craft beer.  It is unquestionably better than a macro.  So when should I drink it?  When do you ever want a second rate beer?  I guess that is why I hardly ever drink Redhook IPA.","bditty187","Sep 05, 2002"

4.03,23.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Re-review / 1 June 2007: The new double label is very nice; and it remains a ""delicate", really well-balanced and drinkable IPA. The head retention was much better, and it left a wide ring of lace at the outset of the glass. There's still a nice hit of citrusy in the nose, and I'm also picking up a bit of spiciness, and more citrus rind in the flavor. Very nicely done.","NeroFiddled","Jul 21, 2002"

3.35,2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a very clear light yellow with a 2 finger head that dissipates into lumpy leftovers and is in the midde of the road as far as the head lasting.  It has a smell of beer aged in wood barrels although I'm not sure this is what happens with this brew.  It has a mild hop bitterness on the nose that tastes similar to maybe the cascade hops used in some of Sierra Nevada's own brews. It finishes slightly dry as far as taste and mouthfeel towards the finish of each swallow.  Not a bad brew but not great.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 06, 2002"

2.97,-9.2,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Not a bad IPA, but not a distinguishable one either.  Pours a clear, filtered golden, looking like a macro lager.  Hops are present from start to finish, but don't blow you away.  A very average IPA.  IPA's are a style that most micros seem to do a good job on, so choose this if its the only thing around.","proc","May 17, 2002"
2.85,-12.8,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"From the bottle. Fresh and exceptionally clear. Chemical in its undertaste and body. A decent lemony attack, but a bland profile in all. My understanding is that they originally had a bitter called Ballard Bitter - which actually wasn't all that bitter, keeping in the tradition of British bitters. Then they dumped some hops in it and called it IPA. It's most likely been simplified in recent years. Not recommended since there are better American IPAs (and bitters, for that matter), and Redhook is capable of making superior brews (the well-known ESB, or the nourishing Rye, a personal favorite). I like my ales on the warmer side, but I think this one needs to be served very cold. It has that garbage-y ""beer"" smell - you know the one I mean; think of your apartment the morning after a big party.","Thrasher","Mar 08, 2002"
2.94,-10.1,2,3,3,3,3,"Clear yellow, slightly ambered.  Highly carbonated.  Head dissipates quickly.  Fruity on the nose.  Conflicting flavors of sweet malt, sharp bitterness, and something sour.  On one hand I want to give high marks on such a unique flavor, but on the other it seems like there isn't a 'flow' of flavor moving from one sensation to the next.  It's more like a scattered/random/jumbled mix of flavors.  Worthy of a taste test none the less.","Jordan","Dec 12, 2001"
