A well balanced IPA, featuring a bit of citrus hops, some noticeable malt, and a bit of grass. More malt than my ideal, but so well balanced I have to be impressed. Very solid.","RobbDogg","Wednesday at 02:52 PM"

Has a generic hop smell with some grassy, earthy tones and a hint of citrus, also there was a little bit of a malty aroma. Taste reflects this aswell, but what kind of stood out to me was how noticeable the malt was, also the alcohol was fairly noticeable. It was fairly light, and pretty drinkable. It was pretty good, but fairly different than the IPAs I have been drinking lately. Honestly after reading other reviews I might have drank it a little too cold.","Joe_Howard","Apr 02, 2015"

Its good, nothing exceptional. i can think of four or five ipa's off the top of my head from Chicago breweries that id choose over this any and everyday. If its the only beer available like twas the case today i would gladly drink it. If you havent had it id recommend trying it. But i dont really see myself picking this up.

4.39,7.3,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a clear amber body with three fingers of foamy, thick white head that receded slowly to a ring of lacing. It looks like a rather nice IPA, quite enticing. Scents of citrus zest upfront quickly leading into vegetal, earthy, dank hops, light pine resin, hints of juniper berry and sour, wild red berries, floral hop aromas and a distinct backbone of bready, biscuit-like malt with some light sweetness. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice, rather complex IPA done in the East Coast style with less overt pine, citrus and none of the tropical fruit seen in West Coast examples. This makes it pleasantly balanced yet still quite hoppy and very nice. Flavor begins with medium-high bitterness, beginning with flavors of citrus zest and light amounts of pine resin before moving into bitter, earthy, dank, herbal hop flavors. Middle is high in bitterness with a pronounced floral character, with notes of citrus blossom and jasmine. Finish is high in bitterness with notes of pine resin, bitter herbal hops and light notes of floral hops, again mostly citrus blossom. Light berry-like notes appear in the middle and even less on the finish. A lightly sweet and bready malt backbone is discernible throughout, continuing into the aftertaste. The aftertaste begins with a light bready malt flavor that quickly gives way to bitter hop flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely hoppy IPA that has a nice level of bitterness, but also a good depth and complexity of floral, fruity, herbal and resinous flavors to make it intriguing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, oily, resinous slickness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good IPA, classic and true to style. Overall this is a fantastic American IPA. It keeps away from the overwhelming maltiness that damages some East Coast examples, keeping hop character high, all the while maintaining a distinct identity from the West Coast hop bombs. A balanced and well executed beer on all counts and quite worth the price point.","Auraan","Jan 31, 2015"

It pours a light copper with a modest sized head that retains as a soapy, creamy and frothy looking lace. The aroma is great; malt sweetness, some cocoa and especially floral hops. It almost smells like a perfume! Taste has a strong malt backbone to balance off the hops intensity. The finish is dry and bitter. Amazing feel; creamy, crisp, refreshing and unbelievably drinkable.

Thinner than 90 Minute, more traditional tasting IPA (when compared to 90 Min) Nice dry finish, with a malty sweetness undertone throughout.  A little but of orange on the nose, but predominately, floral, earthy, and piney hops.  It's really balanced.... great beer.","DudeBeerYaBro","Nov 23, 2014"

Not the "after mowing the lawn" refreshing but the after a long day of work refreshing. The flavor is solid and doesn't overdo it on the hops making it an easy back to back beer after a long day. Or really, any time you want a tasty quality beverage. Will definitely be buying this again.","MrPilstout","Nov 22, 2014"

The taste was full of hop flavor but with a nice balance which ended in a semi-sweet crisp finish that was very refreshing. A classic by my standards and a must try for those getting into craft beer.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 13, 2014"

It has a gorgeous, deep orange-gold body and great head retention with sticky lacing throughout. The aroma is sensually floral and citrusy but reminded me of catching wafts of fresh-baked cookies from three rooms away at home: nostalgia in a bottle. Highly drinkable, it is easy going down with a strong, clean day-on-the-lake finish and satisfyingly bitter aftertaste that sticks around.","ob_carr","Sep 15, 2014"

4.11,0.5,,,,,,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready, slightly caramel malt, grassy hops with light pine, citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is dominated by resiny pine and citrus hops with a bit of hay, citrus rind and mild malt. Finishes with well balanced citrus and resinous piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This was one of my breakthrough IPAs back in the day and I approached this bottle with a little trepidation. There have been some awesome IPAs produced in the interim, and I am frequently slightly underwhelmed by East Coast IPAs now, preferring the West Coast hop varieties. No need to worry, this has held up well, still an excellent flavor blend of hops, nice assertive hop bitterness and a neutral, but supportive malt body. One of the classic IPAs. Off the market in my area for a long time and welcome back.","LiquidAmber","Sep 09, 2014"

4.25,3.9,,,,,,"I am typically a lager drinker but this is my go-to when I am ready for some hop bitterness...The beer pours with a perfect head and solid carbonation; the slight chill haze wore off as the beer warmed in the glass. I think this beer is actually smoother and more drinkable as it moves from fridge temp to cellar temp to room temp. Refreshing, super-smooth, nicely balanced and a tangy hop finish that leads you to the next swig. I think the Dogfish Head guys are superb, all of their beers are well engineered and show off their creativity and professionalism.","Reegze79","Aug 30, 2014"

4.25,3.9,,,,,,"Poured from bottle to frosted pint glass. Pours a nice yellow to golden color with about a finger or so of foam that laces the glass nicely. Smells first of bread and malt, but subtle notes of citrus (lemon mostly) come through at the end. Taste is of the malt/breadiness at firSt, but a piney/citrusy taste dominates at the end as with most IPAs the taste is a bit better than the aroma in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a perfect crisp carbonation. Overall it is a great beer, but I prefer the 90 minute much more!","anthony23cippy","Aug 30, 2014"

This beer does an exemplary job of allowing you to taste everything the beer has to offer without drowning you with hops.  One of the few IPA's that can be drank as an everyday beer (or session beer as it's called).","dannymo","Aug 24, 2014"

3.99,-2.4,4,3.75,4,4,4.25,"A great sessionable hoppy IPA. Very excellent citrusy, yet lemony note, has good hoppy notes with some peach notes and malty, sweet character to balance it. Rich, complex, and hoppy. Not too hoppy to be an easy session IPA for hop fanatics. A good Dogfish Head brew. Very solid. I drank this in bottles. And it is easily available in Tennessee outside liquor stores, so can be had more places. I like DFH 90 minute ale even better, but this is a better brew to drink often. I recommend it to every IPA fanatic. Well balanced for a big ale.","KentT","Jun 26, 2014"

I had this at a bar in JFK airport in NY, and then later that night at the bar at the Hilton in Florida. Poured beautiful and golden brown from the tap, with a thick and creamy 2 finger head. The lacing on the glass was incredible and was still present when our server took the empty glass. The aroma I experienced was of muted pine and sweet malt. As for taste, I wasn't overly impressed; mostly sweet bready malts with some piney hop flavors. Overall I found a severe lack of hop flavor and an overwhelming malt presence, not the sort of balance I expected given all the hype surrounding this beer. Again I believe freshness may have played a part and I'll have to examine further and update!","AngryPenguinBrewCo","Jun 24, 2014"

3.77,-7.8,3,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This is a classic hoppy (but not super hoppy) IPA. Crisp, clean hoppy bitterness, with distinct carbonation. As other reviewers have noted, this is more sessionable than the 90 min IPA, but less assertive/exciting. Also, the faint citrus sweetness, and noticeable malt backbone, give this beer character but also somewhat detract from the purity of the IPA. This is a fine beer but not my go-to IPA or the best that Dogfish has to offer.","AmyfaceNYC","May 25, 2014"

Personally, the hop/malt balance is skewed too much to the latter for me. But I can't deny this is a fantastic IPA to cut your teeth on (I should know - a bought a case of this stuff 3 years ago just for that intent).","ThisWangsChung","May 10, 2014"

Nice look overall. Clean citrus (lemon, grapefruit), some pine, and a nice bitter nose. Nice balance to the taste. Clean bitterness, floral and pine notes, and just an overall freshness. Clean aftertaste, medium to light mouthfeel, and quite refreshing. Overall, balanced, hoppy, what a great deal for a 6er under 10 bucks. This will be an occasional fridge visitor when I find dates this good!","Mikus","Mar 23, 2014"

The overall aspects of this beer are great, but I am left with more pronounced flavors to be desired. If this were labeled as a pale ale, I would've given a higher score. However, this is a good sessionable AIPA.","Bone53","Feb 23, 2014"

And the flavor....hoppy, balanced, and smooth. Bitterness is not overwhelming but very enjoyable. Sips refreshing and bright. Overall everything a basic IPA should be. However, if you truly want to experience IPA nirvana....take the money you'd spend on a 6 of this and get the 4 of 90 minute. You won't regret either choice. But you'll only relish in the latter.","lochef81","Jan 02, 2014"

Some spicy hops as well. The taste is bready with some spicy hop notes. Pine hops more towards the middle with some light caramel malts. A hint of lemon. Lots of carbonation with a light body and slick mouthfeel. I was shocked to see that I had never gotten around to reviewing this beer, although I've had it a ton of times.

It is a everyday IPA that is my new go to beer when I'm in the mood to just drink some beer! This high hop concoction is the perfect pairing with spicy food.","Lederer85","Nov 17, 2013"

Years later of venturing off into various types of IPA's I found myself giving this a shot again. In many ways this is the archtype of an IPA- not too hoppy, and very well rounded. It doesn't have the luxurious mouthfeel of "Sierra Nevada - Torpedo", or the full on punch in the face of "Ithaca Brewing - Flower Power" - but it damn sure is hearty and satisfying in its beautiful golden/bronze glory. Never a bad choice.","-MK-","Nov 15, 2013"

Definitely an IPA as it hits your tounge wit a bitter bite that finishes with fermented lemony aftertaste. Slightly thin that make drinking easy on a sunny afternoon.

This really is a beer that one could drink any day of the year and not be disappointed.

Rich depth and bitter edge make this an ideal choice for one's regular beer. I found the taste strong without being overpowering: strong, edgy bitterness with a bit of citrus, but multi-faceted and balanced. I'm anxious to try the 90 and 120 on another occasion.

Mouthfeel is good. All in all, a solid, tasty IPA that's readily available for a decent price. Having had a bunch of this stuff though, I'd say it's only worth buying when it's fresh. It falls off pretty quickly and there's a lot of old 60 min sitting around out there... Thankfully they have easy to read bottling dates.","dougfur","Sep 08, 2013"

Floral hops, pine and grapefruit in the flavor balanced perfectly by malt backbone. Smooth mouthfeel with nice carbonation.

4.1,0.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"60 Minute IPA is a hazy, light amber color with about a half inch of foam, clnging nicely to the glass. Very carbonated, with no pieces of sediment visible. The aroma evokes the scent of sweet baked goods, along with a pleasing pine fragrance. With a sip, I find it toasty, bready, as well as nutty, buttery, and sweet. The lemon/citrus hop flavors come in and initially are not too bitter...until the finish kicks in with a harsher and dryer wave washing over the palate. It's a medium feeling beer and totally drinkable. An iconic IPA, this is one of the beers that made me fall in love with the style and craft beer in general. For fans of the style with a bit of a malt balance, it's the 'all day' IPA before Founders coined the term.","Neorebel","May 21, 2013"

This is a good beer and it introduced some flavors I had not yet experienced. For an IPA, this has a floral and citrus sweetness that is well balanced with the slight hop bitterness. It's not a complicated beer. No, it's a good spring beer. Its taste reminds me of fresh cut grass and budding flowers. This one is worth a shot, but Dogfish Head certainly has better.","jmendels","Apr 14, 2013"

I recommend pulling a bottle out and letting it sit on the counter for 15 - 30 minutes, pour into a glass at room temperature and enjoy. For about $10 - $12 bucks for a six pack you cant go wrong. This is a perfect beer for beginner craft beer drinkers.","THErealDK","Apr 13, 2013"

Some might think this is basically the "light" version of DFH's minute series, but I see this brew as standing alone from the others.

I'm a little burned out on citrus. The flavor blends, from citrus, to herbal, to malty sweetness. It's sessionable in the ABV and mouthfeel. I'm happy to call this my favorite IPA.

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, lemon, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, lemon, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a nice malt balance that isn’t too strong; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA. Very well balanced, yet still hoppy; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 26, 2013"

This beer more than any is all about the freshness. I don't get this often anymore as Sam C. has jacked his prices up beyond reasonable (keg anyway), but every once and awhile I get a hankering for it. Put the price aside, the beer NEVER disappoints.","Kadonny","Dec 28, 2012"

I've had a couple other DFH and I was starting to convert to a fan, but this one made me a believer.

Malty presence in the flavor with lemongrass breaking through. Guinness sud rings remain on the glass as the beer is drunk. Mouthfeel if very pleasant. Full bodied, wet, with just the right amount of hop burn and carbonation. Very drinkable and appealing. I can see why this is the flagship. Very solid.","DocJitsu","Nov 10, 2012"

4.47,9.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a quintessential east coast IPA. Just a touch of haze in a basically clear classic golden amber brew. A goodly amount of lace from the finger and a half head. A gentle fade leaves a frothy covering that stays throughout. Smell is full of grapefruit and citrus with a healthy amount of sweet pine and caramel malt. A light dough and yeast. A touch of tropical fruit gives a nice flourish. Taste is superb it follows the nose and gives a big hop entrance. Hop oil and grapefruit skin. A lovely astringent quality that keeps it very dry even as the healthy malt core shows up to balance and give counter to the hop parade. Just enough toasted grains and doughy breadiness to put meat on the bone. The tropical notes are just a touch bigger making the beer juicy and deliciously flavorful. The finish is smooth and malty at first with the hop oil blossoming on the back end, coating my throat and mouth in that sequence. Feel is supple and crisp with a lively carbonation that is spot on. Weight is a sublime compliment and makes this a session ale supreme even at the slightly higher abv. One of the best A IPAs I've had and that's all there is to it.","scootny","Oct 29, 2012"

Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Still a solid beer, but I fear that I've wrecked my palette with so many double ipa's that this no longer does it for me.","johnnnniee","Sep 14, 2012"

Though it's the bottom feeder out of their more common brews, it's an easy drink.... As I pour a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it develops a healthy, but lighter bubbly, head.... As you drink it, it leaves a few trails.... Not too many.... It has a light golden and almost orange appearance.... The nose of the beer has bready and yeasty notes with slight citrus.... The taste of the beer matches the nose.... It has a mostly yeasty and hoppy taste with slight citrus notes.... It leaves a very light, but pleasant aftertaste on your palate....

I usually tend to enjoy West Coast IPAs more, but the piney/roasty qualities in this East Coast IPA make it memorable.

4.28,4.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"60 minute pours a light bodied polished bronze in color with a two finger, very soapy bright white head. It sticks to the glass the way an IPA should. The nose is very hop forward yet balanced enough. There are citrusy and piney aromatics as well as enough caramel malt sweetness to not overpower you with hops. The flavors follow the same flavor profiles. There is plenty of malt to provide a sweetness that pairs well with the citrus and pine. It isn't overly dry either. It drinks lighter in body and in my opinion, is very sessionable. I've had this beer a million times but I can't turn it down. This is an all time favorite.","aasher","Aug 06, 2012"

3.88,-5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful clear apple juice and piss color. It sits in the glass as golden with a little bit of orange and red tints. There is a light but steady stream of carbonation from the bottom and a gorgeous eggshell white head forms with big soapy bubbles that mellow into a half a finger’s width. The beer smells light and citrus/apple sweet with a nice faint tingle of grapefruit in the back of the smell and a solid pale malt backbone strongly running throughout the smell that gives it a biscuit-feel. The beer tastes wonderfully balanced with citrus bitters and bready malts. The taste is a little sweet and leaves a very sweet bitter-syrup feel in the mouth. The mouthfeel is quite velvety with the carbonation and a nice thinly oozing gel to the beer. It leaves the mouth very clean with a slight sheen of saliva and a dry feeling towards the back of the throat. Overall I may be a little bias to this beer. This was my introduction to a great IPA and will always have a special place in my heart. It is a very solid example of the style, and a wonderful introduction to hops and bitterness for anyone that is new to the craft beer world.","Maxwell","Aug 05, 2012"

A couple weeks ago, I tried and reviewed their hybrid DIPA, 'Burton Baton' and my life was permanently, irrevocably changed. While it's not exactly fair to compare a 6% IPA like 60 Minute with a 10%, 70 IBU DIPA like Burton Baton, it's inevitable that my phenomenal recent experience with that beer will color my opinion of this one just a bit...thus my overall rating of 'only' 4.0. But in the world of 5 - 8% ABV India Pale Ales, 60 Minute IPA definitely stands on its own. :)","Fusion_Pirate","Aug 02, 2012"

A crisp aroma of freshly grated lemon rind zest hints at the citrusy hops in waiting... Refined and delicious bitter and sweet citrusy waves quench the palate with a marvelous balance of hops and (possibly) pale malt. Classic DFH character for the masses of the IPA curious and "off centered" brethren alike. I've been on a hoptastic voyage with DFH 75, 90, and 120 min for the past couple of years and noticed that it had been too long since I'd poured a 60...Glad I did.

Some roasted notes along with the malts and bitterness is not well sustained as I would have expected from an IPA. Carbonation moderate and refreshingly scrubbing, slightly dry-ish and thin-ish. A well regarded brew, but not this bottle, I think representative of IPA I like...not much complexity in the hops... I guess I wanted more citrus and pine bitterness up front. I'd be happy to have one at the picnic, but it wouldn't be my contribution.","Bitter_Echo","Jun 02, 2012"

When I drink an IPA I like just a touch of malt to balance out the hop bitterness, not a touch of hop bitterness to balance out the malt.

It is considerably less malty and a little bit more on the dry side. Having tasted both the Squall and the 90 numerous times, this bottle definitely offers stark differences that allow it to go a long way in making this stand out to a hardcore Hop-Head. For more bite and less malt, I would highly recommend the 60 Minute over the 90 Minute IPA. Dogfish does it again!","Agent1","Apr 27, 2012"

4.72,15.4,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I just LOVE Dogfish Head beer. This is truly heaven in a bottle. This is not one of those over-the-top IPA's where all you get is bitterness where a brewery creates the high IBU count at the cost of other characteristics. This is a very nice balanced IPA. Pours a nice golden color with LOTS of head and lacing. If you like Bell's Two Hearted you are going to absolutely love this one. I live in Iowa and unfortunately can't get this one here so when I stop in Illinois at Binny's, I am sure to stock up on this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","drumdude73","Mar 25, 2012"

Smells of flowery hops and light malt, a little weak, but not too bad. Tastes of earthy and slight citrus hops dominates, light malt, and the balance is great for an IPA. It is a nice medium body with perfect carbonation and very sessionable. Overall, a very good IPA. One that should be a standby for all hopheads.","cyclonece09","Mar 09, 2012"

The 60 isn't nearly as strong or sweet as their 90 or 120 (reviewing after having both about a hour before), but has a nice balance between the flavors. Not the most spiced or hopped IPA I've had, but a nice balance between all the flavors that is easily drinkable. Definitely recommended, not my favorite IPA but definitely up there.","jaasen64","Feb 19, 2012"

Slight grapefruit, mango and peach on the nose, with a nice caramel malt backbone. Citrus and malt bang on the tongue, grassy and earth with a nice bitter finish. Light to medium on body, medium carbonation that gives a tingly champagne feel, that ends sweet and bitter. Overall DFH 60 is a typical "East Coast" IPA, its big on malt even when fresh, and has nice hop characteristics to boot. Good beer, always available, but not knocking any socks off.","gabedivision","Feb 02, 2012"

I'm not a huge fan of piney beers though (I tend to prefer black lagers with smokey nutty flavors), not sure why I hoped this would be different. It's a solid IPA, a little on the expensive side, but perhaps I was just expecting a little too much from the hype.","Clowerweb","Jan 14, 2012"

A light and bitter IPA with a surprisingly prominent malt (super hopped amber ale?). A well balanced IPA that doesn't really stand out in the extreme playground that is IPAs.","VaterRoss","Dec 21, 2011"

Beers that are popular with the masses are for a reason, and not just because of all the hype. This is unique balance of toasty maltiness blend with a fine wave of bitterness to make it something special. Very good sessionable IPA.","AlexanderSelby","Nov 28, 2011"

DFH 60 wasn’t my first IPA or the beer that taught me to love hops or anything like that, but it is the beer that taught me the importance of checking for a bottled-by date. And with good reason. From the tap—which I can only assume/hope makes it fresh—this comes out a wonderful golden-amber color that’s just hoppy, crisp and floral to the nose and palate. It’s a solidly delicious IPA—but get it fresh, fresh, fresh. Otherwise you’re paying for the brand, not the quality beverage inside those bottles.","elNopalero","Oct 22, 2011"

The only thing I don't like is the low alcohol content. The 90 min may only come in a 4 pack, but that's all you need at 9 % for each.

4.09,0,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"On draft at the Coffee District. Just a solid IPA, would recommend this beer to any IPA drinker. Nice lacing. Aroma is of rich, fruity hops - citrus, grapefruit, and mango. Caramel malt comes through a bit along with some breadiness - kind of bread crust-like. Flavor is of clementine, lemon, and grapefruit with some pine. The malt is lighter than in the aroma - mainly caramel malt and light toast. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pleasantly sweet with a pronounced hop bitterness at the end. Lingering, bitter finish with a touch of resin that avoids being unpleasant. Overall a really great IPA that is solid and repeatable.","biggsbowler","Oct 07, 2011"

This isn't like its West Coast counterparts but if I had never tried an IPA before, this would be the one I'd ideally start with. It wasn't metallic, too dry, or enough to knock me into next week.

4.05,-1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Orange-copper color with a large, fluffy off-white head and good lacing. Aroma is strong grassy, herbal and citrus hops. Bitter hop flavor is nice, but very drying. Definitely some pine in there too. This beer is more powerful than the 60 IBUs indicate. Not as refined as the 90 minute, by any means. Much more of an "in your face" style.

Behind the bitterness, there is a interesting malt character, something I would expect from a darker member of this style. Overall, I think this is a good IPA.","Hopilator","Aug 21, 2011"

4.16,1.7,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden color with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma, but the flavor is at least somewhat balanced, with the complex combination of spicy, citrusy (orange), and must hop characteristics being complemented by a noticeable biscuity malt base. The light, active carbonation cuts through the bitterness and helps this one go down quite easily. Overall, although "balanced' compared to many hop-bomb IPAs, this beer still has an enjoyable, striking, complex bitterness, and it rightfully sits as a gold standard among IPAs being produced on the East coast.","devilben02","Aug 09, 2011"

The beer's flavor is a sweet caramel malt backbone with a heavy dose of pepper-spiced hops and grapefruit balance. The aftertaste is citrus tart and hops bitter, again very well balanced. The finish is crisp and dry. It leaves the palate extremely clean, and is an extremely well put together brew. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Aug 07, 2011"

Flavor follows suit with a nice dry finish and substantial bit of hop bitterness, but not over the top. I like the fact that this beer is only 6% and on the low end of most American IPA's these days.

It has a strong bitterness with a fine emphasis on hops and a fair blend of malt that pinches the cheeks a bit in the mouth and scores well for me as an IPA. This is another great beer from Dogfish.

4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Right off the bat I felt this beer was not an IPA. It was a little too light for me. I figured this craft brew to be a little edgy, but turned out its a little beginner. Don't get me wrong this beer is incredibly drinkable, very refreshing, but 90 Minute is the way to go. Fasho. Also as a session beer its a little pricey, personally I would be happy with some Torpedo or Ranger. Not dissing the beer just saying the hype behind DFH should be they're 90, however if someone asked what a good introduction to craft IPA's would be, I would recommend this, especially for people who aren't that into hops. The 90 is another great non-hophead beer due to its insane malt and hop balance. I would imagine the 75 is somewhere in between(Obviously), which makes me eager to try it. Pick this one up along with the 90, maybe try a side-by-side? Stay thirsty my friends.","NickRivers","Apr 12, 2011"

Medium body and moderate bitterness (think pale ale). Aftertaste of pine and mild hoppiness. An ideal, hoppy second stage aftertaste expected of top-tier classic IPAs.

This is a classic craftbeer thats made DFH famous. From notes -- A: The pour is a clear light amber color with a thin white head which dissipates to a thin layer but leaves some nice sticky lacing. S: The nose is mildly hoppy with some pine and grapefruit. There's quite a bit of toasty, bready malt in the background as well. T: The flavor is more reminiscent of a pale ale than an IPA. The bitterness is there with some nice resinous pine quality, but not all that much in the way of citrus character. The malt is again toasty and fairly pronounced on the front end.

Taste mirrors the nose but the hops appear soon after initial taste, fairly bitter, resiny, but balanced with enough sweetness to maintain tastiness. Medium mouthfeel, above average effervescence. Real drinkable and tres tasty. Upon reflection I prefer this to the 90 minute, which the last few times I've had it has come across a fairly boozy. 60 minute is more balanced, and easier on my pour liver.

The smell is a nice herbal pine with plenty of grapefruit and other citrus. It smells like a good IPA which is a very good thing. Very clean and fresh hop and pine flavors compine right off the bat with a sweet earhy bready malt base. I can tell this is a very fresh bottle. More sweet bready somewhat toasted flavors come our in the middle. It finishes with a sweet citric grapefruit and a beutifully clean bitter herbal bite. The body is a little lighter than some of the other IPA's I think. I kind of like that. That along with the blanced sweetness and clean bitterness and overall great fresh hop taste of this beer makes it incredibly drinkable. I did the whole six pack in an afternooon fairly easily. I love IPA's and I can't believe I've left one this good sit on the shelf until now. Is the 120 minute really double the flavor and body of this?

4.2,2.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"We're starting off with the 60 minute IPA. Let me just say that, while the label is okay, I really like the copper cap with the Dogfish Head logo. It's simple, understated, and quite nice. (I know it's weird to comment on a cap, but this one stood out, at least for me.) This is just a 12 ounce bottle out of a six pack poured into a rudimentary (though functional) tumbler. It pours a light gold, lighter than I was expecting, with a nice crowning head. Solid head retention out of this one. Good clarity as well. Crisp citrus hop aroma dominates the nose. Initial taste is surprising. I know this is an IPA but it's got a higher level of bitterness that I was anticipating, which isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel on this is smooth, almost slick. It can just catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it. Taste is very much hop-forward. Dogfish Head likes to say that this is an East Coast IPA but I don't know if I agree. It certainly has west-coast leanings, both with the hop profile and bitterness levels. This thing is like a tidal wave. Hops crash into your taste buds, with waves of pine, citrus and grapefruit hitting first. As the tide of hops recedes, solid biscuity and light caramel malt sweetness finishes things up. As IPAs go, this is somewhere above ordinary, bordering on the extraordinary. If I had reliable access to this beer I'd probably pick it up all the time as my IPA of choice. Very nice offering and a steady example of the American IPA style.","eclaycamp","Oct 21, 2010"

3.95,-3.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I've had this beer before when I really wasn't an IPA fan, but now that I'm growing a taste for the hop-load I'm going to review it. The DFH 60 minute pours a slightly hazy copper orange color, finger of puffy white foam, and some beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma as would be expected is strongly of hops, specifically piny and citrus aroma. There is also the detection of caramel malts making an appearance on the nostril, but they are not necessarily in balance. The flavors of hops and malt however are in balance. During the initial sips there is a tangy bitterness on the palate that grows on the tongue the more you consume the beer. That is a bit too bitter still for my liking, but overall it is a fine drinking beer and something that is quite pleasant for an IPA.","Vdubb86","Oct 17, 2010"

The nose comprises grapefruit, mandarin oranges, honeydew, and sweet, sweet caramel. The taste is heavier on the pine, but the fruitier hoppy notes remain, joined with the aforementioned pine in a joint domination of the sweet caramel beneath. Imagine the mutants in Futurama. The body is a heavy light/very light medium, with a light carbonation and a finish that really seems like it wants to be dry.

Pours out a deep gold, somewhat thin head and with decent carbonation. Looks like an average IPA to my eyes. The smell is of hops hops and more hops. I've always said, Dogfish Head uses some wild ass hops in their beers and this is no exception. (Also call me crazy, in my clean glass I got a weird wet dog smell.) Gosh, what the heck are these hops that make it taste so different, almost like some kinda tropical fruit? Not so much piney, but more pineapple! Let me tell you, it is different. And, it is good. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, this is a rich beer, but not too much cause it is pretty darn drinkable. There is some maltiness in there but for the style it doesn't stick out much, which is about how I expect it.","Star80","Sep 25, 2010"

And then came the first sip..it even tasted exactly like hops. This is by far the hoppiest beer that i have ever had and it isnt the regular type of hoppiness. its a fresh zesty hoppiness as opposed to the regular bitter undertone that other beers have.

Looks more like a pilsner than an IPA. A ton of carbonation coming up from all over the glass. The head stuck on here throughout. Stayed nice and creamy. Smells very grassy. This grassy/earthiness is followed by a small touch of citric hops towards the end. The strong grass is slightly off putting but as it warms it mellows and there's more citrus coming forward. As it warms more I can smell the caramel maltines coming through as well. Taste is good. Different than what I thought it'd be from the smell. There's a good hop bite up front followed by a piney bitterness that makes its appearence during the swallow. A very solid malt backbone lasts throughout the drink to balance everything nicely. Every now and then I can pick up some alcohol in my nose and throat. The mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied. Coats the mouth with every sip. Drinkability is up there. It's easy drinking.

Citrus, grapefruit, orange, floral, pine and earthy hops all combine with no one dominant flavor shining through.

The aroma is strong hops, pine and zest from the northwest varities that are used, with interlaced citrus notes (some say oranges, I think lemon). It has a firm and warming mouthfeel. The flavor profile on this I.P.A. is admirable due to its balance. There is a solid malt background here to compliment the hops. On the other end the warrior hops they use give it a nice, powerful bitterness that at the same time is so clean it's amazing. The amarillo and whatever their "mystery" hop is remind me of cascade on steroids. There is pine zest a plenty to take your palate on tree climb.

4.6,12.5,4,4,5,4,5,"Reviewed from my notes. The beer is golden orange with streams of carbonation rising. It's very clear in appearance. There is a thin head made of white foam and soap bubbles sitting on top. There is a great fresh hop aroma with some bitter hop oils mixed in as well. It's very appealing. The taste has sweet hops up front, followed by that great DFH hop bitterness. The aftertaste is also bitter, but not too strong. This is an ideal IPA. It has a light to medium body with good levels of carbonation and some mouth coating. It feels above average, but not exceptional. I find this beer to be so drinkable. It's a great go-to hoppy beer that is easily accessible. It seems criminal I don't have a case in my cellar for easy access.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2010"

This provides a very unique and instantly recognizable hop flavor to the Dogfish beers. This method is actually patented by the brewery creating a flavor that no other brewery can directly match.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin but helps but the highlight of the beer which is drinkability. Kind of falls in the same category as SN Pale Ale - well-liked and accessible for the masses, easy to drink and but also quite tasty.

Citrus and fruitiness are the dominant flavors, and dirty hops as well. Biting hops on the tongue, especially as it warms up. Body is light with busy carbonation to keep things in line with the lighter hop feel to this beer. Overall, a nice IPA although I prefer it on tap.

Do you want sweet malt taste.. check! Do you require Hophead bitterness... look no further.

4.17,2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall, this an easy-drinking, well balanced AIPA that packs a good amount of hops and malt but isn't as heavy as it's big brother, the 90 - making it far more sessionable. I was expecting alot from this beer and I think it delivered.","Graham5161986","Oct 08, 2009"
4.2,2.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"As far as IPAs go, this is incredibly drinkable. The 6% ABV technically disqualifies this from the "session beer" category, but I find myself making a session out of this one more often than I'd like to admit. The malt is more apparent than a traditional IPA, so if you prefer straight-up hop bombs you're probably best off looking elsewhere, but personally I'm a big fan of the balance on this one.","kurp001","Oct 08, 2009"

4.35,6.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bitterness is not what I expected. Really smooth, almost no aftertaste.

Strong hoppy aroma with a bitter citrus smell in the forefront and a nice backing of pine. The flavor shows an abundant hop flavor with plenty of citrus and pine but with a nice balancing of malt. Still, the hop is king but doesn't overpower the drink. A nice, light refreshing feel with a great bracing bitterness that is kept in check by the malt. This is a beer that should be a must have for any bar/restaurant. I had it with a spicy jerk chicken sandwich and it worked perfectly. Great for spicy dishes.","apbarwood","Sep 30, 2009"

The mouthfeel was a little rough as to the amount of Hops but was not bad as to kill the taste buds.

Also sweet bready hops and bitter grassy malt. Or do I mean the other way around? This beer is so damned balanced that its qualities are hard to pick apart.

If this is an A- beer for the style, then this style must not be for me. I drain poured this at the halfway mark it was so god awful. The only redeeming quality is the smell, and there is more to a beer then a nice aroma. There is no balance to this beer, the bitter and dry nature is out of control. It's very rare I have a beer that completely puts me off of a style, but this stuff does it. I'm more inclined to try another Japanese style beer sooner then another IPA because of this beer.

Almost an earthy plant kind of smell. It tastes more malty than I had expected. Not to say that malty is one of the top characteristics of this beer, because it's not, it just has a sweeter type of malty taste than I expected. The flavor is very mild. I detect the bitterness from hops and the piney aftertaste and just barely a hint of citrus fruit. Nice almost creamy texture and medium body. Pretty easy drinking. The beer is now 3/4 gone and foam residue is stuck to the wall of the glass and refuses to dissappear. This is a pretty easy drinking six-percenter. A mild I.P.A....

The beer leaves nice lacing, although I didn't realize it until the conclusion of my very short tasting. Although I could have just been thirsty, this beer went down quick!

I'm still impressed with the drinkability of this beer, it's clean and refreshing and I can knock a couple of them back with ease. Something about the smell and taste turned me off in my first review, but the clean, fresh hoppiness of this beer has become something I can certainly live with.

The nose has scrubbing, cleansing feel to it, coal tar, orange peel, sourdough bread, yeast, forest floor growth, the hops act more as a skeletal structure, leaving open spaces between the beams, for all the power it has at first sniff, graceful as it drifts off. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and much hoppier, however, with each additional sip you think it might actually pass for a pilsner. It's crisp, fresh and invigorating to drink, dries the mouth out in the way that makes you drink more. Tea leaf, tar, earth and grass, dried apples, oats, the carbonation quickens the pace and nowhere near overbearing. Nothing really sweet going on yet not bitter as a result, well-balanced.

A beautiful orange-gold color, absolutely beautiful beer. Not a lot of hop aroma, the aroma was slightly underwhelming. The flavor was much crisper and sharper than the aroma would indicate. Nice, round hop presence without being a tastebud killer. Average body for an IPA, not a lot of fullness, but also not watery. Very drinkable if you are inclined to session an IPA, this would be an excellent choice as this will not burn your tongue, and the lower alcohol will keep you vertical.

The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish.

A very strange nose. the first hit on the taste buds is coffee, ending bitter like an IPA should. Half way thru the head is completely gone, no lacing at all, it looks like it's been sitting overnight, and went stale. After living off other IPA's , definitely a dissappointing brew. Advertised as a cask ale. I'll pass on this one in the future, the heavy coffee influence is definitely a turn off.","nc41","Oct 28, 2008"
4.17,2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The provincially-run LCBO has broadened its horizons lately and this is one more good American import that's finally easier to come by. Poured a shade or two lighter than bronze, clear with orange hilights after it settled into the glass, short lived off-white head. A ring remained and a bit of lacing, carbonation was fleeting. Swirling the ale brings back a thin, active surface film as well as bringing out a sharp citrus smell, almost lemon lime, big hoppy aroma. The hops are very apparent again in the mouth with a lively sharpness and mouthfeel and a dry, bitter finish. While I really like the hop presence, there's a dryness that takes away from the overall effect, not as well rounded as another recent import into these parts. But overall, do partake and enjoy, this is a huge world of difference from what passes for an IPA in Ontario.

Spicy, piney hops layered over mint, lemon zest, white pepper, fresh rosemerry, all barely balanced by a bready malt character. Taste is hops. Again, spicy, piney, peppery, layers of citrus, floral hops. Trying to pull in the hop reigns, some bready, crystal malt ties things together.

Tarnished brass /orangish color with a very pleasant nose. Grapefruit, pine & a touch ofcaramel/bready sweetness. Taste is sensational, Great balance of citrus fruits with an aggresive hoppiness which cleanses the palate dry and leaves a nice mouthwatering hoppy bitterness which has you craving for the next sip.

The smell is very rich and earthy hops, citrus and some pine. A slight hint of yeast hits the back of the nose and the malts are present. Flavor is very smooth starting with rich hoppy pine. The hops linger on the back of the mouth. Malts balance very well. The overall finish is slightly dry but not over powering. Flavor is full bodied and transitions well.

Interesting! Citrus flavors abound from the hops, balanced out by a nice malt sweetness. Bitterness is not overly present, but that's a good thing. Quite different than many other IPAs I've tried. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I could definitely put a few of these back in one sitting. Thanks to BA Greggy for this brew!","KeefD","Jul 26, 2008"

It pours much like any beer, but anyone who loves to stick there nose in the pint glass before they drink will fall in love with the 60 minute IPA, as full flavored as IPA's are, I could drink this all night.

Nice mix of piney and citrus hops in the nose with a floral note as well, all backed by the smell of sweet malts. The taste is bitter pine and slightly sour citrus but both in a good way. Sweet malted backbone keeps it ballanced. Mouth feel is medium but does have some nice hop oil that helps the flavor stick on the finish.

Color is a medium yellow with zero head, smells faintly of citrus. Tastes mildly of citrus, but just not a whole lot of flavor going on. The best I can say is that a weak-ass beer like this goes down easily when it's 110­° outside, which it is today.

There are not floral hops, it has a lot of almost roasty malts, but then hits you at the end with the bitterness. It's almost a bridge IPA, meaning it'd be a beer you'd give to a person to ween them onto hops. I personally would want more hop character, but this is obviously going for something different than most IPAs, which isn't so bad. It just isn't my thing. When I drink an IPA, I want the hops to fucking hit me in the face. The mouthfeel is quite standard with a bit of creaminess and a bit of carbonation.

Flavors are well-balanced and taste is consistent throughout, with hops flavoring gradually peaking towards the end. Finish starts out slightly sweet, reveals a hint of grapefruit, then leaves a mild lingering astringency at the very end. Lively mouthfeel falls somewhere between thin- and medium-bodied, but very much style appropriate. Not too much carbonation burn. Very drinkable and crisp brew.

The nose is predominantly bready malt, with a pine hop aroma that was quite faint, most likely due to this bottle's age. The flavour allows more of a pine/citrus hop bitterness to come into play, balancing with the malt, which takes a step back. This beer has a very nice full body, and a subtle amount of carbonation.

Its nose was woodsy to me with notes of malt and citrus. Its taste had the signature bitterness of an IPA, but was balanced very well with the beer's citrus and spice notes. Mouthfeel was great, highlighting a perfect amount of carbonation and dry taste up front, finishing with bitey toasty notes. I highly recommend this beer, and will definitely buy it again.","riboflavin88","Apr 09, 2008"

A full-bodied beer that has a light fruit taste, but mostly the hops and malt come out, mixing well for a semi-dry finish with a flavorful mouthfeel.

It's full of pine and citrus notes that are lovely. The grapefruit aroma is complimented by an assertive malt profile followed by subtle yeasty notes. The taste is malty with alot of grapefruit and orange character and the bitterness smacks you in the face as it dances on the back of the tongue.

Unlike other reviewers comments, this beer had zero cloudiness or any yeasty residuals floating about ... none. There is some head and retention, mostly bubbly white that fades to the edges of the glass. The carbonation is modest. The smell is very nice. I'm getting nice fresh hops, hoppy resins and esters, piney notes, and sweetish malts to come. The aroma is enticing, but drink on. The taste is quite complex. It begins with some sweetish malts, some citrus, fruitiness in the apricot family. This quickly gets overtaken by a nice hop bite, slightly dry, resinous, with a grassiness imparted as well. There is an underlying sweetness to this beer that balances out the hop bite and this gives the beer its complexity. The beer is overall pretty medium bodied, modestly carbonated, but there is a throaty aftertaste that would lead one to believe there is more ABV than there actually is. This is a very fine beer well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Feb 02, 2008"

Malt aroma in the far background. Like the aroma, the flavor is all about the hops, with the malt tethering the whole presentation to terra firma. The malt body really wants to make itself at home on your tonsils, but the hops now come to rescue and chase it off. Overall not a session beer, but that's not what an american IPA is about.

There was a decent amount of lacing and the first taste I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting an overwhelming amount of hops and a bitter finish, but instead the taste is very smooth and has there was no unpleasant aftertaste. The hops are definitely there but not obtrusively so. I tend to favor beers with less hops but this one may enter my regular rotation. The carbonation was pleasant and maybe even a bit mild.

4.19,2.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"60 Minute pours a slightly hazy light copper to amber color with a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is nice oily hops not just the usual citrusy hoppiness either it is a bit deeper here pretty piney as a matter of fact, it is actually quite refreshing for an American IPA. The taste is interesting the bitterness is on the high side but the hop flavor is subdued and I'm really only getting a lot of hoppy oily flavor. The malt flavor may be just a bit too light for this beer but since the bitterness isn't such a quick punch to the mouth like many other IPAs it doesn't really leave you looking for more malt. Mouthfeel is better than decent almost syrupy thick surprisingly thick for an IPA but again it works in this case. For an IPA with bitterness this high this beer is also surprisingly drinkable like I've said before this is a different kind of IPA, different in a good way it makes me wish some more American brewers would mix it up a bit and bring us a bit more with their IPAs.","fank2788","Aug 27, 2007"

Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass dark gold. Very attractive 1-inch head that fades rather quickly. Smells of very light hops and a hint of citrus, but not overwhelming the nostrils. Probably not the most appealing scented beer, but still calls to be drunk. The taste was a pleasant surprise. Light hops taste with some hints of citrus, and amazingly light on the palette. Medium-bodied and not too carbonated. Overall, wonderful beer and probably a great IPA to start off with.

I dunno what kind of weird experiments the Dogfish Head brewmasters out in Delaware are doing to their hops but I hope they keep doing it. GRAPEFRUIT!!! That's what I'm tasting? It's all about the hops here and they have have this total sour-n-sweet smack and a sharp and spicy yet somewhat clean finish. Tart yet sweet...Bitter yet sparkling. If you're one of those people who likes the balance and complexities between the hops and malt this may not be your thing but if you're not afraid of hoppy zing as I am but sometimes feel that a twist and turn needs to be thrown into the works every now and then this 6%er totally hits the spot.","Dalem","Aug 14, 2007"

To the nose, it betrays pine and citrus hops with traces of grain that are present as well in the taste. It's not too bitter like many IPAs, the hoppiness is more aromatic and at the edges of your palate rather than the donkey-punch many deliver. At the end a faint maltiness that blends well with the outdoorsy hops and it doesn't feel like you're left with IPA dragon-breath. It is clear and refreshing feeling in the mouth, light, it's not going to coat your mouth or anything, and at 6%, I could drink these all day and all night.

The taste is on style, and complex enough to call it a great beer, but not not so much to pull away from the drinkability and mouthfeel factor. This is the beer, for an IPA guy or not, that you should have a case in the cooler, served well chilled IMO that everyone can appreciate. It is a greatly unobtrusive or oppresive IPA that can be had for a long night, or just with dinner. Sam really nailed this one down.

The retention did not impress em too muhc; it would reduce to a lacing, but a few swirls of the glass and I was back in business. The smell was fairly interesting; pretty hoppy with malty characteristics. The taste, though, was clearly that of an IPA. The hops were strong, up front, and very noticeable, squashing any thoughts of malts that I had before. The mouthfeel was also excellent; full-bodied and smooth always makes a good beer. For an IPA, this beer was very drinkable. The hops are not so prevalent that you feel like you are going to start having ulcers, but you can taste them a lot all the same.

Ended up with a very thick head and lots of lace. The nose smells like hops but only in a general sense, I don't get hints of citrus or pine or other classic hop smells. The taste is obviously an american IPA, but the hops are not overpowering, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of malts here. There is a strong aftertaste, the hops are almost more apparent once you have swallowed (of course at that point it is just bitterness).

Some decent malt balance to be found as it warmed. The flavor always hits the spot here again. This is just such a nice well rounded hopped up session beer.

Did I say refreshing? the bitterness of the hops makes its super nice; and the flavor of the hops, in my opinion , says that every little nuance is intentional. I have tried countless IPA's, and although some pride themselves on being more bitter or being "imperially" heavier in Alcohol, this IPA is effortlessly perfect, no gimmick- its only a noth above its higher ABV 90 minute brother, and only when you want to have more than one or pair it; if you only had one IPA ever to drink, go for the 90 minute sipper, its a trip.","andjusticeforale","Mar 23, 2007"

As promised, the hops are plentiful and are delivered to the palate without reservation. The bold nature of the hops makes for a beer that is a bit single minded in its makeup, but clearly delivers as attended. The citrus undertones carry over into the aftertaste.

A very pleasant beer that, as an IPA lover, I believe is one of the most enjoyable American IPAs on the market.","86sportster883","Dec 30, 2006"

It was a little better when I just drank it down, than when I tried to taste it, if you know what I mean.

With that being said, the drinkability is good as this beer is smooth and goes down easy. It seems more like a regular pale ale than an IPA. It's still good, however I like the 90 Minute IPA better.

4.57,11.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Pours a burnished golden amber with a tiny but sticky head. Very clear body -- this bottle is of the newer, unfiltered version of this ale. Great nose to this beer. Big, vibrant hops that contain citric acid and resin elements backed with some mint and caramel malts. On the palate, brash bitterness up front, with sweet malts coming through at the mid palate. The finish is very long, as chunky, dirty hops flavors sizzle on the tongue for a good thirty to sixty seconds between sips. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with sharp hop bitterness that braces the tongue. Not for the faint hearted. All in all, this is an utterly excellent IPA, close to perfect for the style. To my mind, the Dogfish Head 60 Minute outpaces the 90 Minute in its enjoyability, sessionability, and strength relative to style. Awesome.","geexploitation","Oct 08, 2006"

Smells almost buttery for some reason, this is most likely just my freak palate at the moment. There is some nice toffee, medium aromatic hops, a tinge of hay, fruit and some alcohol. Taste is crisp and clean, not dry like an English IPA. The bitter hops hit perfectly, and dissipate with out killing you (not that killing you with hops is ever bad), I get some sweetness, with toffee or chocolate at times, all is extremely well balance though. This for a long time has been one of my favorite staple IPAs simply because it wont kick you're ass with high ABV or its crazy hops, but you can drink so many and feel happy.

The aroma is floral, citrusy, and faintly honey sweet. The taste is much the same, but the hops jump in the front, middle, and end. This will dull your taste buds after 1 or 2. As a hophead this is what you look for in an IPA! The hop bitterness is almost overpowering. The mouth is dulled from all of the assualt.

While only 6%, this hit me from the initial sip, and carried on thru the entire glass. The finish is bitter, yet smooth, but most of all leaves a warming sensation from the alcohol.

The balance of this beer is what makes it so good....not too hoppy but still plenty of flavor.

I can't say enough good things about this beer...I almost prefer it to the 90 minute IPA which has a much stronger flavor (the 90 minute is an excellent beer don't get me wrong, i just think it's too much for a pale ale) This is a great beer to get your bud light buddies off of the watered down stuff....","alacrimsontide1","Jul 03, 2006"

Thin true white head with moderate size and retention. Nose is of hops, citrus, and a surprising amount of malt. The malt and hops are more in balance in the nose than I'd think for an IPA, though this is an American style. Palate is balanced as well, with the warm malts fighting for dominance over the pungeant, piney hops. A nice battle to host. Some citrus flavors linger and the beer finishes dry. Not thick in the mouth, but definitely a medium body. Adequate carbonation. Over all, I like this American IPA. Perhaps a touch malt dominant for me, but very drinkable none the less. Now, I'll need to sample the 90 and 120 varieties.","beerphilosopher","Jun 24, 2006"
3.53,-13.7,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"So I've had a few of these and I think I've had a good chance to look at the beer from as many points of view as possible. To me this beer seems like the IPA fir stout lovers. The color is clear and amber with an off-white frothy head that lasts throughout the entire experience. Aroma is weak. Most IPAs have an aroma that just jumps at you, but with this you really have to look for it. What is there is a mix of hops and possibly roasted malt. The flavor follows this trend. For being an IPA, this just isn't cutting it for me in the hops department. I always thought dogfish head was a highly hopped brew, but the 60 minute just aint it. But I'm not going to rate it down just because it's not what I thought it was. The flavor starts with a mild hoppiness, and quickly is overtaken by what I percieved to be roasted malt. This is a very creative take on the IPA, but to me it is such an extreme changed that it doesn't really taste like an IPA anymore. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is decent. It's a tasty brew, but I don't think I would buy this again because it isn't as hoppy as I hoped it to be. Overall I think it's a tasty brew that tried to do something new. It pushed the boundries of IPA deeper into the malt direction (not the direction I want to see it go) but it is respectable for the brewer to brew what he thinks is best. In the end, I think this is a good brew. Don't go out looking for it, but if it's there sitting in the cooler, and you want something new, go for it.","Avagadro","Jun 23, 2006"

Flavor is rich malt caramel, slightly toasted specialty malts, with a good amount of hop bitterness. The biggest flaw in this beer as I see it is that it feels thick in your mouth.

There is some lingering sweetness from the malts in the finish but this beer could do with a little more balance. It just doesnt accomplish that delicate balance that the great IPAs do like Victory's Hop Devil. The mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation and a good body. Overall extreamly highly drinkable.

Smell is intense--did I mention it smells delicious? Taste is clean, first pale, then sweet, then an inoffensive juicy hop explosion. Notably less grapefruity than 90 minute, but not as different and tame in comparison from the 90 minute as I originally recall. This beer is similarly insane, and is nearly balanced for an IPA--even closer to this amazing achievement than the 90 minute. It starts malty and finishes hoppy, but the two transition so perfectly... The hops don't linger all that long, and leave no bitter aftertaste, which is delightful. Mouthfeel is heavy, and not over carbonated. Perfect for the style. Very drinkable for style. I stock this on occasion, but of note, I find it nearly impossible to find anything to drink this along side of. Wings and IPAs/hops are a good combination, but this bad boy is extremely floral, which tends to clash with 'IPA" kind of foods on my palate.","Liquids","May 26, 2006"

To be honest, I don't want another. It's ok. Nothing more. That corn taste just kills the beer for me. In a pinch I suppose I could tolerate it if I wanted some hops.

Some faint diacetyl as well. This beer seems a bit cloying overall and a touch grainy. The sweetness doesn't work too well, but some hop bitterness helps to bring it together.

Moderate aroma of cascade and toasted amber malt. Mild toasty sweetness with the first sip, followed by a rush of solid bitterness but lacking in hop flavor. Some ghost-like cascade notes in the dry aftertaste, but overall dissapointing for an American IPA. The medium body and light carbonation give it a semi-smooth mouthfeel but it's also kind of boring. The stale finish becomes so dry it boarders on harsh and hurts the drinkability.

The different flavors mix nicely and are complexly layered. Bitterness is moderate. The overall taste of 60 Minute is unlike any IPA I've expirienced, which took about half a bottle to get used to.

This one has aromas of all of them -- I'm picking up kumquat, grapefruit, lime and tangerine (piney rind) at the very least. Lacing clumps around the entire glass. All those citrusy hops I smelled are seriously restrained in the taste. Caramelly-toasty malt balance is assertively in effect. Refreshing peach-lemon flavors. Piney tangerine pith finish lingers long after the swallow. Juicy mouthfeel, thin-to-medium body. Quenching! Not the hop bomb I expected, but gaddam if this isn't one super-drinkable brew.

This beer introduced me to Amarillo hops. I was taken away by the citrusy hop flavor and had to do some research to find out at least one hop they used.

A little malt presence on the palate, but the hops completely overpower anything else one might detect, and as it warms, hops just become that much more dominant.

More balanced than your average IPA which isn't necessarily good or bad but it's different and I enjoyed it for a change. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied for an IPA maybe a little bit syrupy. Fairly drinkable. Not as sessionable for me as some other IPA's. This reminds me a lot of Dogfish's 90 Minute which is probably not too surprising. The most striking similarity is in the strong malt presence which I think really suits the more powerful 90 minute but is a little out of place here.

Not all piney or grassy, and not too sweet or salty. High levels of IBU's give enough of a spicy, pine cone-ey, estery, and floral aromas to apease the most agressive hophead, but balanced nicely with subtle sweet notes. Tastes smoothly sweet of ripe fruits, citrus, barley sugar, and honey sweetness. Spicy hop flavor compound the sweetness, making it not only balanced, but easily drinkable. Spices show everything from nutmeg and cinnemon to corriander and pepper. Hop flavor brings out fruits of ripe oranges and pears. Finishes crisp and a lingering dryness that is not too harsh. leaves enough hop flavor without feeling hot, grainy, or overly bitter. Aftertaste is spicy and leaving me wanting another.

Pours a two finger light cream-colored head that hangs around. Just a hint of cloudy to the bright and light rust yellow liquid. Aroma is very mild. Grassy citrusy with not very much malt. Taste is somewhat bitter and mildly citrusy. Not a hop monster, it's more of a pale ale than an IPA. Citrus is mild grapefruit with some orange. Fruit esters are apricot and pear. The end holds a cidery piney hop bite. The hoip bitter increased as the beer warmed, but there wasn't an increase in the malt to go with it.

Taste is more of the same--very strong hops presense with a nice lingering bitterness that is nevertheless nicely balanced by the strong biscuity malts. Beer is medium bodied and has somewhat of a syrupy feel, coating your mouth with pleasant hop oil. Love this beer.

The taste is fairly complex, you get a grapefruit hops flavor, a piney, resiny taste coating the mouth and a soft biscuity malt flavor that takes a backseat to the hops. The finish is crisp and creamy with a mild bitteress that belies the alcohol. Overall a nice IPA thats hoppy but not overly bitter.

There are lots of grapefruit/pine hop flavors along with pineapple, yeast, a touch of breadiness, and a big malt backbone. It is both sweet and fairly bitter at the same time. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and coats the mouth very well. It's fairly obvious that this is the little brother of the 90 Minute, but that is by no means an insult.

If they made a hop-based soda pop it would smell like this. The odor could easily be confused with sweaty socks too. I bought a case of this in December and drank two sixers in the first week and I remember this beer being rough and raw like chewing hops right off the vine. I've had it cellaring for the last couple of months and opened a bottle tonight. The taste has definitely mellowed. (Or maybe I'm remembering the Burton Baton from last night.) The initial taste is mellow malt, then a alcohol coated hoppiness takes over without destroying the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to light with the bubbles feeling a bit too big with the alcohol bite. This is easy to drink, certainly more so than three months ago. I'll be trying it again in May to see if it mellows a bit more.

Taste - ah, the pine really comes through here. After the first sip, I thought, "man, this is like drinking a Christmas tree," but that description doesn't really do the beer justice. The piney taste is definitely there, but it's not overpowering by any means. It gives a unique character to the beer that is great in my book. Mouthfeel - good, but nothing special.

I appreciate good IPAs, but I am not a hophead. As such, the long, lingering bitterness that haunts you after many over-the-top IPAs is not appealing to me. But this -- this I could drink all night.","bultrey","Oct 06, 2004"

All I could taste were the hops, and I didnt find them pleasant. Very similar flavor profile to a SNPA, which I dont care for either. If you it, you will like this one too. Other than the taste, this beer was fine. Its not a bad taste, it just doesnt sit well with me. I traded a Stone IPA for the DFH and I lost in the deal.

Smells citrusy, lots of hops, lots of pizazz. Taste is very hoppy as expected. So many hops that it tastes bitter, which I think is what DFH might have been going for and is what makes this beer more unique than the average IPA. Mouthfeel; this tastes like a dry wine or something of the sort, almost feel like I need a glass of water after this one. Very interesting indeed.

(Sorry for the non-beer suggestion, but hops are a genus cousin to marijuana, and the recognition is purely objective) Malt profile's a bit biscuity and sweet, but the dryness of the hop counterbalance this.

Not as intense as its 90- and 120-min cousins (or other bigger IPA's, for that matter) but an extremely well balanced, very hoppy, exceedingly enjoyable beer. I have to say that this is one of my all time favorites from my favorite style, and it's THE beer that got me into 'good' beer.

Small champagne bubbles rise from the bottom to renew the head, which settles pleasantly as a lace. The nose is amazing on this beer. Its like putting your face in a pile of hops. Rich floral/grass/pine aromas rise from the glass. Just a hint of grapefruit too. The taste is an explosion of hop taste. A tongue awakening of flower, pine, and grapefruit, a mild sweetness comes from the malt. This has a very slick mouth feel, and seems very drinkable.

The flavored hops are mostly floral in taste. Malt seems a bit weak to me, there could definitely be some more malt here. The finish is very dry except for a pine needle hop flavor that lingers.

Maybe it's DFH's attempts to make this beer more balanced as that seems to be a common complaint - I can definitely smell more malt in the nose as well.

4.01,-2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy, coppery-bronze hue with peachy/gold highlights, there is a modest amount of animation streaming upward to a white head that reached a finger in height. The retention was excellent; it slid to a foamy mess after a long moment. The subsequent lacing was rampant and very sticky. This is a lovely looking beer. The nose is hoppy like an IPA should be, the aromas are not forceful however and I like that. The hops seem to impart a mixture of good cheese and pine needles, spruce with a distant but bright note of citrus. Underneath the hops is a dull maltiness. I like the bouquet and find it inviting. However the potency is modest. On the palate the hops come across very oily, in a good way, lots of rinds and little in the way of flesh of grapefruit, there is a dry leafiness at the finish, spruce, pine needles, and more aged cheese (like Gouda?). The malt is noticeable just not very flavorful, hints of dry cookie/cracker notes with a touch of caramel. I absolutely love the arid finish, plus it has great length. Medium in body with a natural, caressing carbonation, the mouthfeel is very good and it seems a bit fuller that it really is, that is a nice touch. I bought a six-pack of this nectar in Fort Collins and I have loved every bottle Ive quaffed. Both DFH 60 & 90 Minute IPAs are fantastic beverages (120 IPA not so good) and I wish I could drink this one anytime I wanted. It is a shame I cant.

Has a fragrant hop aroma that is floral and slightly grassy with some fresh malt in the background. The body is medium and smooth with a slight chewiness. The flavor takes much from the aroma. Hoppy, bitter and slightly grassy with a malt that evens everything out. Leaves a lingering bitterness. Overall a very good and balanced IPA.","BierReise","Mar 23, 2004"

This isn't always a bad thing, but It could be better. 60 minute IPA is one of the few beers they make that remains consistant almost every time. Its hazy orange amber colour and frothy white head is a standard that every brewer should try to achieve. Rich and beautiful. The smell of flowers rise from the glass like a spring garden, lush and full of life. The taste is of oranges and lemons with subtle hints of bitterness. It is a very well balaced beer. The hops, though they are strong and bitter to the taste, they are evenly balanced with a fitting amount of malt. It had a bit of a graininess going down that lost it some points.

The flavor of this beer is something quite beautiful. Its a perfect blend of hops, malt, citrus (lemon and grapefruit that I taste), with a subtle syrupy sweetness. The mouthfeel is something I ususally dont write that much about but this beer desreves it. It starts off with a warming bite to the back of the throat, which builds into a rising sour sweetness that grows up from the back of the mouth. It all ends with a return of the warming feeling to the throat, and leaves a nice piny aftertaste from the malts. Quite a beer.","FranklinPCombs","Mar 08, 2004"

It is dominated with a floral hop character that is intense from the moment it hits your mouth to the moment it is swallowed. It has a nice bitterness to it and finishes refreshingly.

Taste is drenched with acidic grapefruit hop flavor and a strong pine as well. There's something different in the nose and flavor that adds a certain herbal tang, that I'm still trying to put a finger on. Nice sweet malt flavor comes along mid-way through, but it cannot compete with the hops. You're left with a resounding bitterness that keeps going and going. Definitely another unique IPA from the Dogfish family, worth a try.","mikeys01","Feb 17, 2004"

4.17,2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Hazy orange-copper color. Fairly low carbonation for an American-beer, which suits me to a T. Topped by a off white head. The aroma is pure hops at this point; notes of herbal-grass, orange, grapefruit, and a sharp note that I can't quite place. The beer is perhaps a bit cold at this point, so I let it warm up. The taste is nicely hoppy in all ways. It is packed with hop flavor and a nice sharp bitterness in the finish. Has a fair amount of alcohol in the finish for a 6%'er. Notes of grapefruit, and a strong flowery nectar type character are here from the hops. The hops seem to contribute some notes of pine & perhaps a hint of mint as well. This is one of those beers where your tongue just tingles from the level of hops used in making this beer. The beer is medium bodied & a bit malty sweet, which, helps to carry the hop flavor through this beer, though I think that a bit more maltiness would really help this beer to reach another level.","Gueuzedude","Feb 02, 2004"

Very distinctive DFH hop style, blended with just enough interesting sugars (Belgium perhaps?) to make it real interesting.

I decided to try the IPAs in order starting with the 60 minute and working up to the 120. The beer pours golden amber in color with a good sized head (about two inches) with a vigorous pour in a pint glass. The head is not real long lasting but the lacing is fantatic, off-white and traveling the lenght of the glass. The overwhelming aroma is that of hops. I am a hophead, and this was what I was looking for. There is a pine undertone. The taste is hop bitter with a slight pine flavor and an even smaller hint of citrus. This is a good one for hop lovers. It feels thick in the mouth with a hop and citrus tang. The carbonation is light.

There's a huge hop kick, with a really bitter aftertaste that doesn't seem to be balanced with any malts. It's like eating part of a hop pellet. It tastes nice what with the hopheadedness and all, but there's just not much else there. I can't detect much else beyond the citrusy sourness of the beer informed by the hops. Because of the high bitterness, I can't see myself drinking it continuously. Nevertheless, I do think it is an interesting experiment, a super-hoppy beer. Let's hope the other DFH's in the fridge turn out maltier.","twilight","Jan 09, 2004"

4.12,0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Okay, this is the first this Dogfish style has been available in Ohio, even though it is lower proof than the other ones. This beer poured a very cloudy copper orange color(it did say bottle conditioned) with little carbonation and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. The aroma was heavy of hops, but not overpowering of one type, thereby being quite balanced. The flavor was of hops, with very little malt with a bit of a caramel aspect. The body was rather heavy/chewy for this style with the finish being astrigent yet a bit sweet. Not a bad style, maybe helped by the fact that Dogfish was doing less experimenting on this one, sometimes a good thing.","Wildman","Aug 11, 2003"

Smelled sweet with a ton of grapefruit hop citrus and alcoholic peach. Taste was syrupy and heavy with tons of hops not too much malts, just a tiny touch of wheat towards the end. Loved the mouthfeel as it was velvet like. This is in the same vein as Stone IPA and Rogue I2PA in appearence and consistency, but perhaps a mite easier in the drinking catogory as it is much easier going. I would have no problem drink a bunch of these as the alcohol is not as bombastic as some of the other big IPAs. The first dogfish head I really liked.","GreatPondBrewer","Aug 10, 2003"

Taste is a straight hop up front attack with a mild and I do mean mild malt flavor lingering around with an all hop finish were the citrus flavor comes in. There is a bit of a film that covers the mouth after the swallow. Nice body and easy to drink. I do admit I was expecting more from this IPA, but an above average IPA.

4.2,2.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Taste was fruity and not as bitter as youd think as a big malt creates this beer. So, it comes across with a tiny sweet at first followed by a bitterness moderate in leafy flavor and parching in effect. A solid IPA in that the bitter doesnt send your mouth flying to handle crazy flavors shooting off. Overall, a simple taste with a fizzy action on the tongue, combined with the relatively thicker mouthfeel, is nice. For me, a very good IPA to have around, better to sniff than drink.","nomad","Aug 08, 2003"

The aroma was rich with hops with a hint of what smelled like some sort of candy (butterscotch???) I noticed that when real cold, the taste was mostly of hops - a very highly hopped ale with plenty of chewy bitterness. However, when warmed up a bit this reminded me of a cross between an amber ale and a barleywine...wierd. Basically, when warmed a little bit, it starts of with a malty richness, and then gives way to a hop-powered bitter finish. Throughout the sip there is a steady candy/alcohol/earthy taste that compliments nicely and adds tons of character. A unique and lively brew with a nice kick - the previous reviewer must have had to have mislabeled brews.","nixhecks","Aug 07, 2003"

The smell was strong and fruity. Citric came to mind when I smelled it. Very good drinkability, I could put down a few of these for sure. Has a very 'hoppy' taste, but its not too much.

Aromas are a little from the hospital chest but a lot from the hop plant -- piney and strong. Understated maltiness that gets lost in the swamp of hop flavors -- a fairly potent and brutal hop assault overwhelms most of the complexities. A little creamy...medium bodied. Some of the "lesser" flavors -- some light citrus fruits -- came out to play as it warmed. But for the most part, this is a hop monster. The piney, sappy bitterness is the finishing note, and it lingers and lingers and lingers. It's twenty minutes after the last sip, and I can still feel the bitterness dripping from the back corners of my mouth.","marburg","Jul 22, 2003"

The head never dissipated and has champagne like carbonation keeping the head going but its flaw is that it has huge chunks of spent hops that float around in the carbonation that looks like their dancing in your glass because they never settle out to the bottom of the glass. This fish food look just doesnt do this beer justice. Smell is of hop and hops alone nothing bad but nonetheless not stellar because you cant smell the malt that you can taste. Tasted of nicely hops but was not overpowering in anyway for its series of hops infusions threw out the boil and some malt does shine threw albeit not much. Nice mouthful not creamy but not watery just right. I would definitely drink this beer again as it is very good ipa that really isnt extreme in very drinkable.

4.35,6.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A subdued relative of the 120- and 90-Minute IPAs by Dogfish Head, this is a hoppy brew in itself. The pour makes way for a deep, hazy copper liquid with a firm white head. The head sticks around for a while before settling into a small ring, leaving some lace down the glass. Aroma is like a pine forest. Notes of piney, citric, resinous hops explode at first. Very little malt can be detected in the nose. The first sip, however, shows that this IPA has more depth. The taste is definitely hoppy, full of notes of citrus and pine. A sturdy malt backbone, however, looms beneath, creating a nice balance that even a non-hophead can enjoy. Hops, though, definitely are the main event, and hop burps are prevalent long after imbibing. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but not overly so. This beer drinks fairly easily, as well. I'm glad the 60-Minute was introduced in six packs. I can certainly stand to enjoy some more.","Jon","Jun 27, 2003"

Resinous balsam aromas, slight sense of a light machine oil. Pithy flavors, stout piney and orangey Amarillo hops and some unfortunate phenols dominate the overall impression -- though not as huge as a Rogue Brutal Bitter. Ligher in tone and body. Malt balance is lacking, slight shortbread, but none of the malt of the 90 Minute Ale, which whacks back with sweetness.

4.32,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Auburn hue, with dry hop derived polyphenol haze. Topped by a vanilla white, creamy, persistent head. Tattered lace remains. Pungent, bright, capricious wafts of chlorophyll laden spruce tips and tangerine zest are in the forefront aromawise, and are accompanied by a struggling contrast of light lovibond caramel malt. A delightful baleful of hops! Flavorwise, malt character is slightly more apparent, being comprised of a lightly honeyish, perfumed nature and serves to complement the dominant floral and resinous pine hop flavor well. Hop bitterness is surprisingly restrained, but since residual sweetness is minimal due to the high apparent attentuation, the overall character is dry. A tinge of bubblegum emerges mid palate, but is quickly tapered by a lingering suggestion of hopped rosewater. Lightly bodied, and mildly dextrinous, lending a crisp mouthfeel conducive to quaffability. Finishes clean, with fleeting bready base malt sweetness and muted citrus zest. A delicious, relatively well balanced IPA. Not overly assertive in hop bitterness, but redolent of American hop bouquet and rich in oily hop flavor. Unique and superbly drinkable.","marc77","Jun 05, 2003"

The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh hop leaves (cascade I believe), floral hops, citrus, sweet malt, caramel, fresh grass, pine needles and a slight bread dough. Mostly hops but as the temperature rose slightly the other aromas became noticeable along with the hops. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of hops  slight bitter, floral, citrus  fresh and dried hop leaves, fresh cut grass on a warm thick Saturday morning, sweet malts, caramel, pine needles, lemons and grapefruits, alcohol and bread. The after tastes were of fresh hops and slightly bitter when first pulled from the fridge and tasted, it got progressively creamier and sweeter as it got warmer, but still hopped. I would say that the flavors of this beer are 94.5% hops and 5.5% everything else. If there be truth in labeling then this beer should be called 45 minute IPA because I swear it took 45 minutes for the hop taste to finally leave my tongue. Even when I exhaled I tasted hops. Amazing. Very good beer, another hit from DFH.","Jarod","May 02, 2003"
4.4,7.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Pours a deep golden amber color with a thick, creamy off white head. There is a bit of haziness with a few floaters in the beer as well, but it is bottle conditioned. The aroma is an absolutely tantalizing floral smell, backed by a nice malt sweetness. The taste is smooth, and suprisingly balanced. The first thing that I noticed was the malt backgorund, but it is supporting a heavy load of hops. Nice, even bitterness throughout with a bit of a piney-citrus note. A wisp of sweetness licks the tongue on the aftertaste, but the hops steal the show. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with perfect carbonation. The carbonation is integrated so well into the overall experience I had to think about the carbonation. I love when that happens. This beer is supremely drinkable, and I must get a lot more of this soon. An oustanding beer from DFH, perhaps my favorite of their offerings.","aaronh","May 01, 2003"
3.59,-12.2,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nothing subtle about this IPA, or for that matter, any Dogfish brew. Very close to the 120 sans the ridiculous alcohol kick. Deep cloudy gold with white foamy and fizzy head and some sticky doily type lace. The aroma is mostly strong hops with a bit of alcohol. A medium amount of sweet doughy malt and very highly hopped with strong metallic and grapefruit peel bitterness. An In-Your-Face-Strong, wild and raw tasting brew.","BeerResearcher","Apr 28, 2003"
4.27,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Decent head, but beautiful color. A light orange/amber, and not too cloudy. Smells very hoppy.

It just reeks (literally) of green, grassy, spicy, minty, hops. Obviously, with a 60-min. addition, the whole spectrum of the hop is taken care of, bitterness, flavor, aroma, no gaps. I won't say it's nicely balanced, but there's enough going on otherwise to keep it going. A little yeast bite actually gets through , too. Nicely done, I'm going to get another..literally..right now.bye.","pbrian","Apr 13, 2003"
4.46,9,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"The bottle pours a yellow-gold body with a light orange cast. It's quite hazy, but then again, it is bottle conditioned and loaded with hops. The case advertises that with the funny line, "New Chunky Style"! There was no yeast left at the bottom of the bottle so I assume that with some longer cold storage it might clear a bit. It brings up a creamy off-white head which drops to a thin surface covering; holds well throughout the glass; and leaves some thin lace. But the aroma is brilliant! It's just like opening a large bag of fresh whole flower hops - pungent, grassy, floral, lightly minty and a touch citrusy. In the mouth it's medium body and fine, natural carbonation combine to gently caress the tongue before warming to become creamy and smooth. A rich malt balances the hop flavors nicely, and the bitterness is solid but well within reason. It starts with a bright note of lightly sweet, citric, floral, and leafy/grassy hops; followed by some more earthy/minty/resinous (but not quite piney) flavors as it crosses the palate; and finishes with an incredibly long-standing fresh hop flavor and a muted, drying bitterness that rises as the residual malts receed. Overall, it's quite soft and round, avoiding the brash character of many "Imperial" IPA's; and it's alcohol is also well concealed within it's big flavor and aroma. Very nicely done with a surprising amount of drinkability. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Apr 09, 2003"

4.27,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"It is very floral and spicy. It is not simply overloaded with hops, but it does have quite a bit of hop presence to say the least. The hops hit hard and then balance to near perfection with pale malts and a bit of bread as it dries out toward the finish. It starts crisp, and I would like it to stay that way, but the carbonation dies as soon as it hits your tongue. This is one I could have a few of, but it may be hard for anti-hopheads to handle. A fine brew in my book.","ElGuapo","Apr 03, 2003"

3.67,-10.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"My bottle was kept and served a little too cool so I had to let it sit for a bit. It started out pretty ugly. The beer itself was a very cloudy light amber orange, but the hazy lifted significantly as the beer warmed up. The head was coarse and quickly reduced to wisps. The first flavor that jumped out at my wasnt hop related but rather a faint smokiness. Besides that, there werent any surprises. Wood and grapefruit aromas dominate the nose as well as the palate. As one would expect, the hop bitterness is more restrained in this one and the emphasis is more on the other aspects of the H. lupulus. The role in the malt cut back as well. I think I like the 90 minute IPA better, because IMO this played more like a West Coast PA because of the thinner body and malt contribution.","yen157","Mar 29, 2003"

4.5,10,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Nice golden yellow brew with a slight haze to it. Small white foamy head. Smell is very hoppy with a good whiff of barley in there. The citrous zing of the hops is definitely there, followed by the taste of freshly harvested grains. (wheat or barley? can't say i've ever tried either). This is very tasty considering the lower ABV, and I prefer this to the 90 minute IPA because you can put 'em down all night without getting wasted. There is more taste in this brew than any 6% beer i've had, making this the ultimate session brew. Good full mouthfeel, with a nice dry finish.","avylover","Mar 16, 2003"

Amazing pine hop smell that is possibly the best smelling beer ever. Nice orange creamy pour with a slight head. Beautiful hop taste that I believe is pretty bitter (although others do not find it very bitter). After tasting this, it will be hard to ever find another IPA as good. Also, I NEVER give a beer a 5 all the way around and this one gets it for sure. Perfect beer!","Jdiddy","Mar 16, 2003"

4.47,9.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have had the 90 minute IPA on cask and it is my favorite IPA in the world, so when I saw the little bro on cask at the Sharp Edge I couldn't turn it down. Appears a copper hue with a tannish biege, silky smooth head. Very nice full foam, with lace adhesion going in in my pint glass. The aroma is a full upfront floral hop aroma with citrus and pine tones, very nice malty complement going on here. A well balanced hop and malt combo make up this very refreshing appetizing session IPA. Very smooth on cask and not too hoppy, due to the fact that enough malt sweetness crashes upon the palate to tame the bitterness. A pronounced piney hop character, amazing offering from the folks at Dogfish Head. Smooth and creamy almost feels as smooth as if it were on nitro, with a medium to light body, a worthwhile beer!! Very smooth and drinkable welcome to paradise my fellow hopheads.","WVbeergeek","Mar 10, 2003"

Has a sweet citrusy aroma with some buscuit and caramel mixed in. Flavor begins sweet, a mixture of maltiness and sweet hop oil, then becomes fruity, with orange and grapefruit notes, and finishes bitter. The balance of flavors is exquisite. Medium body and carboantion... smooth and slightly oily mouthfeel. This might be as close as you can get to a session IPA.","zerk","Feb 19, 2003"
