"Outstanding IPA, I bought it once and then hurried back to the craft beer store in Mexico to get the rest of the stock. It´s just delicious and smells great, it´s a pineapple citrusy IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Fairly impressive, nice hoppiness without overt bitterness.  I'm not a huge IPA guy, but this was pretty good. I might pick up a six pack of these sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe not so fresh, but not tasty. Deep amber colour, white frothy head. Smells like malt bomb, a lot of caramalt, grapefruit. The flavour is the saime, citrussy finish."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty basic but very well made. Great balance of flavors. I would have never guessed it was 7.5%. Been on an ipa kick lately and this has been one of the most enjoyable I have had."
""
""
"It's a quality beer. It's hard to fault it in any category, except that it doesn't really present a distinctive taste. It's hearty and yet smooth,  but also a tad bit bland."
""
""
""
"For 7.5 percent alc this beer is incredibly smooth. Perfect amount of hops. Firestone does not dissapoint here!"
""
"O: A very drinkable, go to American IPA."

"Nice IPA. Doesn't really smack you like some other IPAs with similar ABV's. Had on tap in 1/2 liter mug. Good colour, nice white head leaving lace as it works down glass.Recommend - especially for those who dislike sharp hoppy aftertaste from IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Everything one expects from a West Coast IPA."
"It's good for an ipa..."
"O:  Great beer.  Much better than I remember it.  Will remember to try Firestone Walker beers before the hop-flavor dissipates."

"If you're an IPA fan, and love hops, this is your beer.  Well done!"
"I can't find anything lacking in this beer.  Clear, warm honey color with very nice foam, lovely café latte color -- yum. Great nose -- biscuit with some mango -- which leads into a clean, balanced, full taste with some serious but not in your face hops, a bit of citrus.  Carbonation just right --  light with a little velvet at the end. Totally balanced, nicely layered. What it not to love?!"
""
""
"Very good. The smell on this is great, tropical fruity for sure. The taste is a little piney, definitely clean."
""
""
""
""
""

"Long, bitter, well integrated finish, good integrity."

"This is a great beer. Out of the Firestone variety 12 pack this beer blows the others away by far."
"(Draft, revisited) at BJs in Valencia, CA. (2/25/15)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer and definitely in my top 5"
"There wasn't anything particularly remarkable about this beer. Maybe because it was my first Firestone Walker I let my expectations get out of hand. A great IPA but it lives in a crowded field. Had on draft and I suspect a fresh bottle might have been a little more lively in aroma and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"From 12oz bottle into Sprecher nonic. Bottled on date: 11/4/13 (60 days old). Appearance is orange-amber with one-finger ivory head that lasts a while before settling to a ring and islands. Lacing in dots and rings all the way down. Aroma is grapefruit and orange citrus, pine, and resin hoppiness plus some alcohol and a minisucle touch of bread. Taste is citrus rind bitter up front, a touch of sweet tropical fruit juice and bread comes through briefly, then the bitterness returns on the swallow but fades abruptly. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, soft carbonation adds to that texture, abrupt bitter finish."
""
""
"Another fine beer by Firestone Walker!  I really like this IPA.  It is very hoppy up front and has a lot of spicy character that you would expect.  The smell is of piney, floral, and citrus hops.  It has a very nice kick at 7.5% but it blends in in well for a nice taste.  I would rate this as one of the better IPA's."
""
"One of the few IPAs that comes close to O'dells...just barely misses it. In the Bottle, I sometimes am tempted to put it at the same level as O'dells, because it has such a Brilliant Citrus/pine balance but it's still just SLIGHTLY too sweet for my normal preference unless I'm in the mood for a sweeter IPA. On tap, it very frequently suffers from being even sweeter and thus too sweet for a hopheads preference who will often go with Stone or O'dell because of it. The other downside is that its priced at least 1 or 2 dollars more than the average IPA. It deserves it, but still..."

"Overall: Very delicious and drinkable, could have with plenty of meals, feels like a pregame brew. Would recommend you try. Looking forward for more brews from Firestone Walker."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Don't know why I waited so long to try this one. Overall, a great beer that is easy to find and affordable."
"WOW!  I just popped my first.  Signed up to let anyone know how incredible this beer is.  Copper color, great mouth feel, nice citrus and floral bite with an exceptional balance.  WOW!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wholeheartedly agree with the average reviews here. This brew is truly world class! I love everything about it; from its lovely golden color, to its amazing citric hop aroma, and for its delicious balance of hops flavor and malt backbone. Furthermore, it has a great feel that is so drinkable and leaves me wanting more. This is my 2nd Firestone Walker ( I had a Wookie Jack) and have loved both."

"from a 22 oz bomber ... purchased in CA ... consumed in PA ... fantastic !!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing fancy here; just a damn solid IPA. If you don't like fruit or pine-heavy flavor in an IPA this is definitely one to try. Pours a dark golden color and maintains quite a thick, lingering head. Smells crisp and hoppy;  tastes just like a no-bullshit IPA should - hops are very evident but not overwhelming. Alcohol content is perfect for this style at 7.5%."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Great IPA. One of my go to beers. Has a unique hoppy aroma that I love.  World Class says it all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA, Firestone doesn't do anything wrong most of the time lol"
""
"I'm a little disappointed. Good and hoppy, but I feel it could be a bit bolder with other flavors. Still better than a bud."
""
""
""
"Quite delicious....balanced, slightly bitter but not overly strong or overpowering. I could tip a few of these."
""
""
""
"Sweet and malty with the hoppy bitterness there but not overpowering. One of the most balanced IPAs, or any beer for that matter, that I have had."
""
""
"Very smooth and light on the pallet"
""
""
""
""
"The double jack, on the other hand, holds my interest."

"12 oz. bottle at Ginny's Little Bighorn on Sun., 12/28/2014 (Chicken Shit Bingo), dated ""10/28/14 22:31," poured into plastic cup, drank over 30-45 minutes"
"Overall- I thought this beer could of used some more work on the malt aspect of the taste. With some sweeter malt mixed there would be much more balance, which would put this beer into outstanding territory. With that said it still is not bad by no means."
"Similar citrusy, piney...just dialed back on the the ABV a bit. Nicely balanced and smooth. Very nice/drinkable"
"Another solid west coast IPA"
""
"Orange body with a creamy white head.  Smells peachy, Citrus and pine bring up the rear. Big citrus pine flavors with mild bitterness. Really smooth mouthfeel.  Goes down too easy.  Awesome IPA!"
"Overall - fantastic ipa.  It's a great normal ipa and if I could I'd get it more often."
"Really hoppy with a nice citrus malty balance."
""
""
"just an absolutely solid IPA that is around everyday. in my fridge as we speak"
""
""
"Light/medium bodied, very drinkable. Altogether a very nice IPA, one of the best."
""
"Not the beer I thought it would be. Really excited to try but the hype was a little too much."
""

"o: i like this more than i was expecting too.  i really enjoy how juicy this is in aroma and taste.  its bitter, but not overly bitter or off-putting.  very enjoyable"
""
""
"Overall: this is my favorite IPA, it's easily available, fairly priced, and if it's fresh I always pick up  a six pack or bomber, just a great IPA. The biggest challenge to this beer is freshness."
""
""

"Really stand up west coast IPA. Perfectly true to style."
"Light head strong citrus finish"
"Very easy to drink."

"This is one of my go to IPA's. Great hop hit then it mellows with a sweet malt addition that really compliments the fruit notes. Tastes of peach, passion fruit and some mango with a hint of caramel. Freshness is key and it's located on the bottle, so always check. I love it!!!"

"Wow! I have never disagreed more with The bros. than on this beer!   Usually they are gospel, but I am just not seeing it here with Firestone.  It's an extremely average IPA with no memorable qualities.  I bought a six pack and it took 2 months to finish them off.  Even the Sierra Nevadas and Steinlagers went before the last Firestones.  Anyways, i digress.... this beer is not necessarily bad, but then again, its not great.  Think of the most average IPA you have ever had across the board and here ya go!"
""
""
""
"O- One of the best IPAs out there when I can find it on draught. Out of the bottle, this beer is decidedly less impressive but that's probably because the freshest bottles I can find are one month old. Firestone Walker really needs to figure out their distribution kinks in the Great Lakes region. [4.25]"
""
""
""
"Perfect from start to finish. Pours nice and as soon as the you sip it the flavor explodes until it goes down and you are left with an incredibly clean aftertaste. Full body, hoppy to start with a quick escape."

"O- Definitely like this one. I just wish the flavor was as juicy as the smell. Impeccable aroma for this one."
""
""
""
"Solid 3 fingers of head.  Light golden brown orange color.  Smell the hops citrus and malts.  Strangely light and smooth in the mouth.  Very odd for an IPA.  Taste hops, citrus (orange peel) and malt but no bitterness like most IPAs.  Really drinkable.  Head lingers.  Hints of fruit. Maybe apricots?  Very subtle. Solid clean IPA.  Only Double Jack is better but that will knock you out.  You can drink several of these without calling old significant others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great APA (close to DIPA territory)! Doesn’t differentiate itself too much from other hop bombs, but it nails everything and has enough of a malt backbone to keep from being strip-the-paint-off-the-walls bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Yes, this ale is yet another California hop bomb. There is more to this beer than just hops, however. There is just enough malt to keep things interesting. The beer smells good. The beer looks great. Union Jack does many things well."
""
""
""
""
"Huge bitter resin aroma. Body is light straw clear with a white head. Lots of different citrus fruit flavors. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, maybe some passion fruit. Very juicy and very tasty."

"O:  Although the born on date was almost 6 months, this one was very fresh-tasting.  Glad I got to try my first FW brew.  More on the way.  Well done.  Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"My first brew from these guys, had this on tap at a Yard House in Denver. Color was a little orange for an IPA, some copper. The construction was good, decent lacing, not a ton of head. I thought the taste though was rather pedestrian, not too hoppy, none of the pine or citrus you might get in some. Above average IPA, but I was a little disappointed."

""

""
""
"Under expectations. Was one of the best looking beers with a very clear orange color and great lacing. Smell was great aswell but taste was lacking. My bottle was a little old so will have to try a fresher one and re review."
""
""
"Much better fresh and on tap!"
"Soon smooth!"
""
""
""

"Solid ipa, citrus forward, slightly dry, very drinkable, and balanced very nicely. Pouring out of a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sadly I did not see the bottled on date until after my purchase.  I was worried, but this has held up really well and it is nothing short on hop flavor.  This is a solid example of a west-coast style IPA.  Im glad to see that it hasn't dropped off after a few months.  Hopefully I can get my hands on some really fresh bottles in the near future."

"Delicious. This was a true surprise to me, I was expecting a run of the mill ipa, something you could forget quickly, not at all. This beer is surprisingly delicious, and is a great ipa, I recommend this beer all day. It's more savory than bitter so its not a hopnut kinda beer but as a bitter hop lover myself, this was a different, refreshing surprise. Well worth the try."

"Poured a two month-old 12 oz bottle into a willi glass. It's a clear gold with slight orange color and a one finger tight head and minimal lacing. Beautiful floral and citrus notes on the aroma with just a touch of dank. Taste is of citrus, particularly orange, and malty sweetness, followed by a hint of dank. Mouth is perfect for the style. Overall, this is a great IPA. I wish I could get it easier where I'm at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a nice, light copper with a thick head that slowly dissipates. The aroma is pleasant with pine and orange blended with a slightly sweet malt. The orange comes through more strongly as it warms up a bit. Right upfront is a distinct citrus and orange rind flavor, flowed by pine. The palate ends abruptly with a resinous bitterness and a hint of astringency. Not much in the way of malt, unfortunately. Mouth feel is a on the lighter-side--a bit watery. A Good IPA, but not great."

"I can see why Union Jack is held in such high esteem. Even at two months old this is an outstanding IPA that I would love to try directly from the bright tank one day. This has all the bitterness I like in the style without sacrificing balance and it both looks and smells fantastic to boot. Glad to have finally tried this and will definitely have it again."

"O - The overall impression of this beer is clean, hoppy and crisp, with enough malt sweetness to keep it from melting your tongue. The alcohol is evident but not obnoxious. I don't understand the name, since the beer is clearly in the American tradition, not British, but when a beer is this good, who cares what they call it."

"On tap at La Puerta in San Diego. Nice two-finger head, crisp light golden color. Grapefruity and piney hops blended with moderately strong malt. Grapefruit and floral notes on the nose. I just wish the smell didn't fade so quickly. Overall, a very good beer."

"Amber in color with a fingernail thick layer of white head on top. Brussels lacing. Aroma of citrus hops is present and yet restrained. As I take a sip the citrus hop flavor assaults my tongue. There's saltine cracker and dry bitterness in the flavor as a result of the hop/malt balance. The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisp."

"The flavor hits of grapefruit and floral throughout with a medium bitterness. There's a bready malt backbone, with a bitterness of orange and grapefruit peel on the back. The finish has a gentle pine needle, leaving a medium lingering bitterness."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice orangy color, pretty clear, with nice modest head. It's a great looking beer, no complaints there. Smell is modest hoppiness with a touch of booze. The taste is a little better, but still, the hops just don't come through the way you'd expect in a well thought of west coast ipa. There's a bit of citrus and bit of skunkiness, but I can really taste the malt and yeast and there's a touch of booze to it, which I don't like. It has nice body. Overall, it's a perfectly fine beer. I enjoyed it, but was a bit dissapointed. The hops were just lacking in my opinion. With no freshness date on the bottle, it's possible I got an old one and I'll re-evaluate if I have it again and am more favorably impressed."

"Great job, Firestone Walker. This beautiful golden brown beer satisfies. A citrusy-grassy aroma and a good prolonged hop flavor and finish make this one of my favorites. It is crisp on the palate but too much that it become too light. I believe it was brewed just the right amount of time and bottled right on time."

""
""
""
""

"I poured this into a glass it had a nice thick white head on top of a golden color body. The aroma gives off a piney smell with a citrus also. The taste has a great pine hop flavor up front that is amazing, then a hint of malt towards the back. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a really refreshing and enjoyable ipa."
""
"O - Very drinkable, but nothing really stands out to me. Not overly bitter, but I can't really get strong or very memorable tastes. Still a very good beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy, piney hops, bready malt, some ripe fruit and caramel. Body is medium and almost smooth. Herbal hops, bready malt, caramel and ripe pears fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A very enjoyable IPA and a few things that I found to be slightly below outstanding. Far from the cutting edge of IPAs in today's market as it probably was 5-10 years ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is easily one of the best tasting well balanced beers around. Nothing is overpowering and everything marries perfectly. Citrus, pine, malt, everything in the right proportions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice balance of bittering and flavoring hops - and plenty of both. Ultra smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Malts play a solid role but let the hops do their thing, more than grainy but not in the toffee range. When fresh, this beer is nearly impossible to beat for the price."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good example of a traditional IPA. I'm a Lagunitas guy for IPAs but I would drink this anytime."

"Look is a clear IPA orange with a small soapy head that sticks to the glass. Smell is vegetal hops, sweet savory malt. This is what I'd call a balanced IPA: grassy hops (some might say onions and garlic) engulfed in sweet caramel malt, bitter and sweet, malty and salty."

"Fluffy white head, crests about one finger, good amount of larger bubbles, probably hampers retention, the lacing in turn is more frothy than sticky and sticks in gobs more than sustained streaks. The liquid is more of a bright sunset orange than gold, very good depth as well as brilliance, only a few bubbles visible. The nose is pure and focused, leans on a clean floral dimension, grapefruit and lemon pith, white pepper, there’s solid cocoa and chocolate grounding the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, star fruit scents, refrains from indulging in sweetness, more about punching through. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied, has a firm feel and the carbonation has a steady prickle more than creaminess. Sweeter here as caramel joins the chocolaty maltiness, at the same time slightly more juiciness in the white to pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus. The fruit has a tropical profile, just not the slutty juiciness often associated with pineapple, papaya, guava to nectarine fruit. The pine notes as much cone as outright sap, restrained. All this said, it does crackle with a quiet energy, can play up bitterness while not seeming herbaceous or puckering. Styled for thoughtful enjoyment and grows on you with each sip."

"Overall: I finally found a Firestone Walker beer in PA! But unfortunately it was 10 months old and the hops were skunked. I taste potential but it's too old to be credible. Hopefully my next Firestone beer is fresh"
"Overall, just an outstanding American IPA. I've had it many times, but this might be the freshest I've had it (6 weeks) and felt compelled to write it up into a review. Also, I'm cleaning out my beer notebook... but I digress. If you're looking for an outstanding, classic example of the West Coast style of IPA, but like a little bread in your lupulin shake, you could do a LOT worse than Union Jack. It's one I will continue to buy and drink for as long as FW continues to make it so good."
"Finish: The hops hit everywhere and linger."

"Let's be honest my friends, this is the only Firestone Walker beer I really really like. I've tried them all. Call me crazy but this beer has extreme depth. You know it when you drink it. It's like drinking breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nothing wrong with that. As they say in the movie the Matrix, ""All a Body needs"". And I don't even like the Union Jack Flag. Spend a few extra, and skip the other brands for this brewery. Signed 805 local person."

"Aroma starts off with noticeable grapefruit and biscuit malt. Taste tends to the citrus/pine side more with a definite bitter bite which doesn't linger too long. On the back a toasted biscuit malt makes a presence to offer some balance. This reminds of torpedo except a notch above, but simply for subjective reasons. Definitely one of the better ipas ive tried."

"This brew comes across very well-balanced, packed with amazing aromas and nearly unforgettable flavors. The only weakness was a relatively mediocre appearance, but who cares too much about that minor nag when the key components of scent and taste are so topnotch? Yep, this will be on my short-list for tasty, affordable, big flavor/big hopped IPAs."

"O: This is admittedly my first offering from Firestone Walker and it's probably the best first impression that you could get from a brewery. These guys have their head completely wrapped around what a great AIPA should be and they deliver. Flavors are flawlessly balanced and out-of-this-world delicious. Mouth presence is huge, but works great. This is just an overall world-class brew that needs to be experienced. By everyone."

"My favorite IPA, hands down. I have only had it once, but it left a resounding impression. Incredible beer. Great flavor, great finish. Strong hops, exactly how I like my IPAs, smooth and well brewed. I need 50 more characters which is ridiculous. Conciseness is a virtue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall my thoughts on this beer are,i love it a great ipa at any price but in my neck of the woods it cost under 10 bucks a sixer snd that undercuts others that are just as good or maybe this one may even be better.i dont know if i would call this one world class but not far from it and well worth your time."
""
""
"I: a diamond in the rough. The price point is outstanding in NorCal. A great brew that is so damn tasty!"
""
""
"O- over all i enjoy this beer, i like an IPA that focuses less on smashing hops down your throad and more on the general complexity. the bitterness on this tends to get better as you drink the beer. bitterness is an aquired taste and i have been appreciating it more as of late as my tasting evolves. i am starting to understand it more. Also this beer was extremely fresh tasting had a bottle date of 1/6/14 and here we are 2/7/14 nice job Firestone."
""

"A great English IPA, no question. Many of the style seem to sacrifice the bitterness but this is full flavored all the way on both fronts. Bitter, sweet, then dry."

"Pours a dark straw with a big white head that fades quickly. Nice lacing. Nose of grapefruit with floral and bready malt notes. Malt sweetness hits the palate first, a great foil to the bitter hoppiness. Citrusy and floral on the palate, finishes dry and clean. Light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, balanced and very well crafted, this is one of the easiest drinking IPAs I've ever experienced."

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of grapefruit and pine resin with hints of green onion and a solid caramel maltiness to back it up. Solid caramel malty flavor with layers of pine and citrus on top and a moderate level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Nice old school IPA I enjoyed this for a change."

""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a huge IPA fan, but I enjoy my IPA's every now and then. This is one that I enjoy! It's a well crafted brew. The only thing that got me was the malt character. I like IPA's with a light body and more fruit tones. This is a good brew, regardless."

"Amber pour...vanishing head...thin, but quiet waves of complexity....bitter flows to floral..NICE..at 7.5 % not a hint of ALC. My taste buds hoping for a closing splash but not happening. This is a good IPA but not a great one . In the IPA race to the top.. closing in, but finishing just out of the winners circle. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
"O: As always, the West Coast nails it. Would drink this beer at any time. It's up there with the Racer 5's, Stones, Ballast Points, etc. A solid, drinkable IPA that doesn't overwhelm your palette, which is becoming all too commonplace these days."
""
"O: While this brew is hop-heavy, it somehow remains quite balanced and drinkable. Definitely cures a hop craving and would be a solid go-to IPA. Definitely worth trying"

"O-This is a solid example of an IPA that verges on IIPA. My not-so-fresh bottle still packed a good hop wallop on the palate, although it was less inspiring on the nose. The relatively full body was a pleasant surprise and was perhaps the high point for me. Would love to taste a fresh bottle."

"There is no shortage of fantastic IPA’s from the West Coast and the Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA is no exception. It pours a light amber color with a fluffy white head and a crisp hoppy aroma. The taste has a strong fresh hop flavor with a good bitterness lingering on the palate that is all carefully balanced with a slightly sweet maltiness. All in all it makes for a very tasty well balanced IPA that hits all the right IPA notes without overwhelming your senses. Superb!"

"The appearance has moderate amber hue. The taste is much more pronounced than the smell. Union Jack is fruity but very drinkable. I am not an expert on what fruit flavor there is but the fruitiness is stronger than the hops but not too much. The only thing that is comparably tastier is Firestone Double Jack."
"fairly clear golden color, bone-white head. fruity aroma - grapefruit, orange, melon - very pleasant. tastes is dominated by slightly bitter hops - fruity citrus flavors. mild malt. tasty. medium body and carbonation, a bit oily mouthfeel. overall a nice IPA with great flavors."

"Overall: As I mentioned above its a classic. On tap it is absolutely delicious as is the case with bottles if you get it fresh. There are a few times I've bought a 6pack where you could instantly taste it has been sitting around a bit too long as most of the hop profile vanishes and you get mainly malts. A shame to taste it this way knowing how good it is when it's fresh."
"had this many times before but never reviewed until now.  Still a solid IPA and a good little brother to their DIPA double jack.  Nice balance throughout but a bit heavier than I like my single IPAs but the carbonation helps it gain some crisp finish in that sense."
""
""
"O- Great brew, found this one in IL for $12.99/sixer and I am glad I got the chance to try it. Wishing I would have bought the double jack though..."
"O - One of the best readily-available IPAs on the market. A treat to drink every time."

"An excellent beer that was a pleasure to try, not a bad introduction to Firestone & Walker beers and one that did nothing to damage the reputation of the brewery in my eyes. A perfect balance and a great taste with the smell backing this up throughout. One I can't wait to try again."
""
""
"O. This is a great go-to IPA. It's not in my neck of the woods, but I would certainly prefer this to other widely available IPAs. This beer screams pizza."
"Hopefully the distribution will be in North Carolina soon!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very good IPA. Really strong from start to finish. Well rounded and balanced."
"O: a very drinkable beer the you can use as an intro to IPAs, even if it is one of the higher rated ones. It doesn't have that huge west-coast bite, but has enough bitterness to represent the style well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured a clearish orange body with good head and lace ring around glass. Aroma is a mix of wet, soapy, citric hops and touch of bready and sweet like malts. The beer is a little fuller bodied but not chewey, goes down easy with citric hops galore, touches of sweetness from both possible caramel malt and some possible tropical/sweet fruit notes. Finishes crisp and sharp without ruining my palette and overall a really good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very solid and balanced IPA from Firestone Walker and certainly one of the benchmark IPAs for the west coast style. It's fairly complex, nice amount of pine and fruit with a very approachable level of bitterness making this a very quaffable beer."
""
""
"Taste- Fairly fresh hop dominance. Almost tastes like wet hops were used in this. Very dry pines and bitter hops with a subtle caramel, biscuit malt for the base. Overall, this is a nice IPA. A good start for those coming into craft beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good Firestone IPA. Would certainly enjoy again and try other offerings from FIrestone Walker. Prost."
""
""
""
"In the glass, Union Jack and Double Jack are indistinguishable by appearance. Both are dark amber colored with a nice finger thick head, but that's where the similarity ends. Union Jack is more lemony tasting, not as well balanced and with a more bitter aftertaste than either of the other two. It's a decent IPA, but not in my top 20"

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium coppery-gold amber with a fine half finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Nice aroma of pineapple and other tropical fruit, citrus, piney and citrus hops, sweet malt; smells great. Flavor is caramel malt, great mixed citrus and tropical fruit, grapefruit, pine and citrus hops. Finishes with a more of the superbly integrated fruit flavors and a lingering citrus hop bitterness. Mdium bodied with light creaminess. This is an extremely well integrated IPA. It is not a hop bomb, but plenty of nice hop presence. The malt body is very tasty. Nicely integrated. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try this."

"I've had this in bottle and on tap. Out of bottle it was superb. I became blown away on tap. A very refreshing aroma, hints of sweetness. Nice color, copperish looking. Taste was amazing and there was no ""taste fatigue"" so to speak. Numerous glasses later, it still taste just as freshing as the first glass. Only reason it didnt garner a perfect 5/5 is because I find Double Jack to be slightly better."

"O: Exceptional, in every sense of the word. An amazing IPA."

"Pours a nice amber color with about a one inch off white head. It is a good looking beer. The head is actually still there after about 20 minutes - impressive. Nose is heavy, heavy fruit, peachy mango with light citrus. Grapefruit, melon and a little berry flavor, with hop bitters at the back end. Medium mouthfeel and creamy texture. Overall, a great IPA. One of the things I really like about it and I think sets it apart from other IPAs is the heavy fruit aromas and flavors, which gives it a sweeter profile, and then the hop bitters really kick in at the end. I'd say it's exceptional."

"I poured a 22oz bomber into this glass i got at IKEA. The brew is a beautiful golden orange color with a nice thick bubbly white head and a good amount of carbonation. A very sweet resiny aroma that tickles the nose. Citrus, pine and malt also very present in the aroma. Same characteristics carry over into the taste: lots of malt sweetness (pale malt and some crystal malt) this is all balanced quite aggressively by lots of hop bitterness. Great mouthfeel very smooth beer. Delicious. A damn fine California IPA. Go get some."

"O: One of my favorite AIPAs. Truly an amazing west coast IPA that is thankfully widely available on the east coast. Tried this for the first time about a year ago, first beer from the brewery actually, and was blown away. Since then, I've had every beer that they distribute out here. Classic beer, classic brewery."

""

"The taste profile was great, a hop lovers best friend. Beside the crisp, clean hops was a backbone of malt. The only drawback was the bitterness that made me think this was a borderline DIPA."

"o: Good beer for sure, but I expected more based on how much I loved Double Jack."
"I don’t remember having a more flavorful balanced IPA. Some are very balanced but not that flavorful. This one is a perfect match. They made 70 IBUs result in a firm but also elegant beer. Awesome beer that deserves to be drank very fresh."

"Union Jack is the epitome of the ""West Coast"" IPA- it discloses a malty-sweet balance early on, but as the rug is swept from the taste buds, I'm left falling into an uncontrollable dry and bitter ride thereafter. There's a resistance to simply ""tag along"" but that resistance is, of course- futile."

"Overall: I have had all the other Jack beers, but this one stands up with the others. Awesome hop profile with mellow bitterness that is balanced out with the malted barley. Pretty light for 7.5% too."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is very well balanced. There is a definite citrus hop up front followed by smooth malt sweetness with some hints of fruit. The finish is very clean with hints of grapefruit and slight hints f grass. There is a lingering but pleasant hop bitterness. Even though it's unmistakably an IPA it's not what I would call a hop bomb. I will definitely be buying more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure about this one. I'm never big on grapefruit hoppiness when it's overpowering, but I love how this subsides so nicely in the finish; lingering, poignant bitterness is so unpleasant, and this masterfully turns the bitterness down in the finish. It's well crafted, but I think not the hop flavor range I prefer."

"O - 4.25 - Overall this is a really good beer, and would be a great everyday beer for lawn work or watching the game. It's perfect for the price, I'd compare it to Stone IPA. Obviously it's not going to be a Ruination or Pliny, but for a standard American IPA it's amazing."
"Pours hazy yellow color with finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing is moderate. Citrus, piney hoppy aroma. Aroma is great! Nice malty, slight citrus taste up front quickly followed by piney hops. The transition is decent but you can still taste where one begins and one ends. The taste is excellent, regardless. Bitter aftertaste but just a tad soapy and dry.."

"Pours golden yellow with little head that fades quickly. The smell is complex. Smokey. Sweet. Fruity. Almost smells like pepperoni. My first impression of the taste was ""whoa.""

"A: Beautiful golden orange, nice head with some serious staying power, quite translucent – 4.25, S: Nice citrus and melon on the nose, catch a fair bit of orange, a pleasant pungent kick but a little more mild than I was expecting for an IPA though it definitely has all the qualities of a solid American IPA – 4.00, T: Sharp bitter bite, noticeable pine and lime rind, hint of grassiness, hops are quite nicely balanced with some caramel malts – 4.5, M: Touch of grittiness on the tongue along with a nice creaminess – 4.00, D: A quality American IPA all around, almost spot on to the style, very drinkable – 4.50"

"I arrived to the convenient store on July 4th wanting to buy a beer in a patriotic bottle. I lucked out on this beer, which sports the Union Jack. Very impressive. Easy to drink but bold, with notes of roasted almonds and caramel. What a great beer to be the first that I review on Beer Advocate. Highly recommended!"

"Final Thoughts: I was traveling through Illinois and stopped at a beer store looking for some DFH. I had no idea that Firestone Walker distributed that far and was pleasantly surprised to find a decently fresh sixer in the fridge. Quite a happy accident in my opinion. Union Jack has some fruity and piney elements but ends up being a sort of sweet herbal tea IPA. Despite the odd sounding flavor, it delivers a good drinking beer that has a lot of interesting hop character to enjoy. Would I drink it again? Yes."

""

"Great beer. The taste doesn't slam you in the mouth with hops but delivers a good strong hop presence that is consistent throughout. Very good mouth feel, light lacing on the glass. Unfortunately it is not available in Florida and I only get to try it when traveling in the northeast."

"I'll be buying more this summer."
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE 5/8/14: Had another single of this tonight, bottled 2/15/14 so almost three months on it, yet except for the relative lack of a thick head this time (yet still dense lacing), perhaps a lighter body and the fact the age of the hops might be the reason it tastes somewhat malty, nothing much to change here in text or rating. Back when I first reviewed this I was a real amateur, now I'm a much more experienced amateur. UJ still rocks. Looking forward to Easy Jack."

""
""
""

"A really nice example of its style. It would be hard to mistake it for something else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another winner from Firestone Walker. It wasn't overly bitter. There was still more than enough hops in this beer to keep your hop loving taste buds entertained. Would I drink it again? I sure would!"
""
""
""
"O: This is probably one of the better 6-pack IPAs on the market right now. And it would be even greater if it were fresh. I could see this one being a regular in my fridge regardless, though."

"Solid body for an IPA, medium, slick, and toying on the edge of being sticky. Carbonation was on-point, too. Much like Double Jack, I feel this is a bit overrated for what it is, albeit it's still marvelously crafted. They (obviously) have similar hop flavors, so perhaps this particular bill and schedule doesn't completely vibe with my palate. In any case, it was still a very enjoyable IPA."

""
""
" The flavor is just great no other way to describe my first impression is the nuance of the beer is cohesively establishing a great hop flavor overlapping the malt backbone with yeast adding character yet playing a supportive role. I love the grapefruit-like flavor of the hops is balanced slightly by a nice toast note in the malt there is a subtle floral accent which adds complexity with very mild aclohol and hint of pine in the finish. Overall I really love this beer it is a great example of the style -an IPA with lots of hop flavor not simply a bitter beer."

"Bottle: Poured a gold/amber color with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and floral hoppy notes is really enjoyable with light sweet undertones. Taste is also dominated by sweet notes with nice floral hoppy notes and some citrus undertones with limited bitterness. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with great drinkability factor and limited bitterness level."
"Overall - Not bad, but I was not impressed overall. I think this brew is a bit overrated, but everyone has their own tastes. Firestone Walker does make amazing brew though, I highly recommend Firestone Walker - Double Jack if you want to be blown away by a good brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a great beer, no doubt, but not the best Firestone Walker has to offer. For that, I would recommend their Walker's Reserve porter, which I found to be fantastic. I love Paso Robles, the brewery is in a great spot. I would highly recommend this brew, even to those who aren't the biggest hop-heads like myself."

"Overall: I'm surprised that this isn't considered a DIPA. I would definitely count this as one of the better and definitely more hop-intensive IPAs out there.

" O: I approach any Firestone Walker entry with a bit of trepidation, as I have not yet been blown way by any of their entries. I want very much to support the brewery, as Firestone is quite local to me here in Ojai. But this one is fair to middling, and hardly lives up to the promise of the advance hype that led me to buy it ($8.99 for a six-pack). I notice that many reviewers located outside of California are tripping over themselves to heap praise on this one. Me thinks these people need to come to Cali and see how well this style can be done. ^_^"

"Bottle dated 10-25-12, drank on 3-19-13. Will have to try fresh some time but this is all I've got on the East Coast. Pours deep golden with a small fluffy head. Aroma is still fantastic. Sweet mango and grapefruit with candy sweetness. Flavor is pine and grapefruit, but the hops are obviously deadened. Still, this is an excellent IPA. Lingering sweet citrus on the palate. Medium slick mouthfeel, with medium to high carbonation. Really want some fresh now, though this is still very nice as is."

"The taste is powerful. This is a full-bodied beer, but doesn't kick your butt like some with heavier ABV content. You'll probably be sad when it's over... I certainly was. Exceptional IPA from a brand that makes it hard to decide which of their recipes is your favorite. Well done, Firestone."
""
""
"Excellent looking beer. Pours clear amber with about 2 fingers of fluffy eggshell head. Very inviting. The nose is very clear, crisp, simple, and big. I smell fresh cut pineapple, flowers, and pine. I didn't really expect the flavor after smelling the beer. Pretty typical west-coast hop flavor. A dry ipa, which isn't terribly balanced. I like the juiciness of the beer, but I was looking for more sweetness. Hop resin lingers on the tongue. The body is medium and highly carbonated. Leaves a little weight after the finish. Overall, a very good beer. Not a great beer, but it's very good."
""
"Solid IPA. Got a nice bite to it, smells freaking awesome, ok head, good looking brew. Leaves an excellent lace. First try of Firestone. Picked up a six-pack of this which means I have 5 more delicious beers, good idea me. Hope they all are this good."
"Pours a golden amber with lively carbonation and a medium white head. Sticky spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is nice with spicy, earthy hops up front. Some tropical fruits and sweet scents. Pineapple with a little caramel. Taste showcases more hops. Some grapefruit, orange, and pine. The malt reinforcement is there but lets the hops show through, simply providing an underlying sweetness. Great mouth feel and despite ABV, it's a very easy beer to drink. Well-crafted and a solid all around beer. A standard of what true sessionable hoppy beer should be like."

"Medium bodied with a perfect balance of dank, sticky hop bitterness, sweet citrus/tropical fruit notes and a sweet malt backbone. Dry, earthy bitterness up front with a spicy/grassy flavor along with pine needle and alpha acids. This is countered mid-palate by a juicy tropical and citrus hop flavor with notes of blood orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango. The perfect amount of fruit sweetness without taking away from the bitterness. Decent malt backbone balancing things out without interfering with the hops. Subtle caramel sweetness along with toffee, bread, biscuit and graham cracker. A little heavier and a touch more malt than most west coast IPAs but its perfectly balanced without losing the delicious, complex hop flavor. Exemplary for the style."

"O: Interesting IPA. The hops don't quite assault your tongue like a DIPA, yet it keeps things interesting by deviating from the malts->caramel->hops formula of a lot of IPAs/DIPAs. It's an interesting change of pace, but not a staple for me."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall - My tastes have certainly changed. What I once thought was an okay IPA, I know find quite enjoyable. While I'm still not sold on pine forward IPA's, I'm now able to look past that dominant aspect and take in the lesser characters of the beer. I think this is a beer I'll be drinking more of as time rolls on."

"Certainly one for the hop head. This is a very good beer, just no for me. I do like it. Though surprisingly I love Double Jack. I think that has more tropical fruity and juicy flavors than Union Jack. Which is what I like more than the large and lingering bitterness here. Still enjoyable."

""
""
"Appearance is light copper with a thin layer of head that leaves some lacing behind. The nose is distinctly of fresh hops.

"Overall: Exceptional, a classic hop profile with a unique twist. The flavor is very delicate and could have been ruined by any number of things, yet it stands perfectly balanced. Hardly a Single IPA, but I don't care what they call it, I just wish it made it to Montana."

"22oz bomber, bottled on 9/21/12, served in pint glass. Beer pours a pale straw color with a medium yellowish white head. Intense grapefruit aroma...mmm. Flavor is totally crisp with really bright hop flavors. Despite being way up in your face, the hop flavors are pretty mellow. This is not pure cascade. Amarillo? Carbonation is pretty high but works well here. This is a really great, if high ABV, IPA. Totally enjoyable and worth drinking."

"Overall: A really magnificent IPA, and at 7.5 ABV, it packs a punch. Look out. Is it a British Invasion? Maybe an abduction?"

"Overall: this is a solid west coast IPA. With little balance. Once again the grain bill is simply a vehicle for the hop characters. Expertly made and well crafted one of my go to IPAs. Complexity is not there more of a simple hop bomb."
""
"Perfect citrus taste from start to finish, this is an incredible IPA that is not to be missed!! I've had it in the bottle and on tap, and both are EPIC!! <3"
""
"Had at the TK Irish Pub. Pretty amber coppery color, clear, with a nice white head. Citrusy, grapefruit aromatics, heavy. Smooth feel and big on the hops. Slight malt appearance toward the end. Fairly bitter in all. Excellent IPA. Very well rounded from appearance to mouthfeel. One of the best IPA's I've had."
"O- this is just a solid IPA, plain and simple, you would never know it was 7.5 ABV. I'm a fan of citrus forward ipa's and this one doesn't dissapoint."

"Toasted golden with a nice quilt of whipped egg white foam with a nice sturdy wall of lace. Smells nice with tangerine, grapefruit, some pineapple, english toasted malts slightly sweet on the finish. Bitter with a good sweet malt, some pine, some resin, orange peel - well balanced IPA if there ever was one. Medium bodied with moderate on light carb and a wet finish. Good beer, very drinkable."
""
""
""
"A really smooth and good IPA."
"Overall...This beer is perfectly balanced and phenomenal. Thanks Firestone. On number 2 ..heading to 3 soon."
"What an IPA! I'm almost lost for words! Seems like its been pretty well explained in the reviews here! At 4.95 a bottle this is world class! Impressive! I'm a newbie into FW's brews this being the first I've tried. Astounding Job Firestone Walker! A journey I'm looking forward to taking."

"Well balanced between resinous and citrusy hops and a delicate malt backing. Definitely west coast in style. Subtle tropical fruit flavors in the flavor. Solid bitterness. Finish is lingering resin and pine"

"Dark golden with a creamy foam head that leaves rings of lacing. Smell is dense citrus, lightly floral, in fields of biscuit and toffee. Taste is heaps of juicy citrus against biscuit and toffee. Juicy bitterness shreds the toffee sweetness, but with with a big malt backbone lurking that gives this one some heft bordering on DIPA territory. Mouthfeel is luxurious. Finish is mildly bitter, juicy, clean. Overall this is a thoughtfully crafted tasty IPA. Excellent."

"O - This is a solid IPA and a great first impression from Firestone. It lives up to what hype I had for it. Would love to get a fresh bottle one day."
""
""
"Excellent west coast IPA! Poured it a good temperature with a smallish off white head that soon disappeared and a little lace. Color is a clear amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is about perfect - very fresh hop and malt. Flavor is likewise highlighting the hop which is balanced nicely with the malt sweet and carbonic tang. Body and carbonation are very good. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and a touch warming. It all works very well. Great drinkin' brew."

"O: I guess everyone who tries this really digs it, and I can see why. It's one of those really classy, like ""old school""-tasting brews - a strong, crisp beer with sharp edges and a satisfying abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Delicious. Good balance between malts and hops, bitter and sweet. Fresher tasting than most IPAs, or most beers for that matter. Kind of like fresh squeezed orange juice at the grove, the hops taste like they were just picked."

""
""
""
""

"Overall: A really exceptional IPA. If you ever get the opportunity to try it and are feeling some hops, you cant go wrong with this choice. Definitely a contender in the top single IPA's in the world in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Nope, finally got a keg of it for my home and this is a very excellent IPA. Smooth mouthfeel, wonderful aroma, excellent head retention. A bit more bread yeast to it since I have had it alone with no other IPA's to influence the taste buds. I increased my ratings on this."
""
""
""
"Overall this is fantastic. Very drinkable and easy to sit down with a 6 pack. Bottle version I would grade taste a 4.0 due to freshness, as tap is always the way to go if possible. Happy drinking!"

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my favorite IPA to date. It is not overloaded with hop bitterness like so many I have tasted. The hops are in the forefront, but are showcased very nicely and are balanced out just enough by a cracker taste from the malt. In short - it tastes great!"
""
""
""
""
"O - really solid IPA. i would definitely drink more of these if more available in my area. was a treat to see it on- tap!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a really nice looking yellowish gold color with a white foamy head on top. The retention is good with a very impressive amount of sticky lacing on the glass. Them smell of the beer is very nice, fresh hop aromas with the subtle malt aroma in there as well. The taste of the beer is excellent. Easily one of the best IPA's on the market. Lots of beautiful citrus flavors in there with a very mellow malt presents. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very drinkable, Nicely carbonated and smooth. Overall... Awesome. This is something I'll be buying more of."
"DELICIOUS; MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
"O- Very nicely done. Not my favorite, but I can certainly appreciate the West Coast roots, and the care which was taken to craft it."
""
""
"Overall: I really want to like Firestone’s beers, but sadly neither this nor DBA has impressed me thus far. Still, their pedigree guarantees I will not give up on them until I have given all their barrel-aged beers a shot. They just seem to be too one-note for me thus far, and for someone that praises complexity, that really hurts their scores. This beer is worth a try, but I would not seek it out again. 16/20"
""
"O- Solid across the board. Nothing to get super fired up about but it's definitely well-done."
""
""
""
""
"For an IPA, it's outstanding. I wish I could pick up more of the helps that I am smelling in the taste. The beer has alot going with it in the malt build and the hop profile but could use a bit more of the later. I tend to like a simple malt profile but the malt in this one brings some big additional flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The nose speaks more than the tongue and the tongue was also fairly one dimensional. Not a huge fan as it lacked complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, in a world filled with breweries filling their line-ups with IPA's and half of them being awful, it's great to be reminded that there are still some world class beers in the style."
""
"O: This is a great example of what a West Coast IPA should be. Plenty of alcohol, easy to drink, and super tasty. What a hop bomb! I love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: For some reason I never really gave this beer as much credit as I should have. I have tasted it in the past, but before moving to Colorado I could not get my hands on it unless I was travelling and I usually passed it up in favor of something more exotic. That all changed, however, when my manager and I tasted a lineup of Firestone-Walker beers last year. We needed an IPA on draft and we both, on the spot, decided that the Union Jack was our winner. Since then I have tasted it many times and thoroughly enjoyed it. It takes a lot for me to say this, but it now sits beside Modus Hoperandi (and Blind Pig when I am so fortunate) as my go-to IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Highly recommended! Very tasty. Very drinkable. The complex flavors subtley come at me and/but are finished with a very powerful piney flavor that is understandable but also stop me from rating this beer a ""5" in taste and overall. It is only that close."
""
""
"Overall: Wish this thing was readily available in GA! I highly recommend to everyone not just hop heads. Really like how this simple this beer drinks for a West Coast IPA. Could have a few of these any time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Perfectly balanced for the bitter-hop forward taste it's going for. Definitely some craftsmanship involved here!"
"This may be one of my new favorite IPAs. Unlike a double or triple IPA, you can pound a few of these down and be quite satisfied. Nice balance and drinkability. Pick up a 6"
""
"Overall this is an excellent IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. The brilliance of the great west coast IPAs is the hoppiness without the heavy maltiness. This does it as well as any I have tried. I always try to keeps a great American IPA in the fridge, and this is one that meets that. FW makes such a great IPA that makes you want to drink more. The lingering mouthfeel may make you stop, but boy is this special. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a damn good, well rounded, citrus hop forward ipa.... Refreshing with a nice drinkability."
""
""
""
"Overall, just an all around excellent IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is perhaps the finest American Pale Ale I've ever tasted. It belongs to pantheon of great APAs--Sierra Nevada, Stone and Fresh Hop from Great Divide."
""
""
"O: I usually don't like malt forward ipas but this one is pretty good nothing to special but real solid and easy to drink"
"Overall – Love this beer.. I had it side by side with Double Jack and preferred it. It has more of a sharp citrus/hop flavour to it. Happy to have had the chance to try them both on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer before, but never this fresh, bottled 2/5/2015! I've rated it a 4.25 in the past, but this time I cranked it up higher. Fresh, this beer is THE sh!t. Great balance of malt and hops, a near-perfect mouthfeel, and the beer brings out the very essence of Centennial hops. Sweet orange marmalade, piney and citrus fruits on the nose and on the taste, with faint traces of tropical fruits in the background. Well done FW, well done!"
""
""
"O: This beer is part of a new generation of craft ipas that border on 2xipa status but go down like a session beer. fellow hopheads, be warned, your sessions shall be short should you get sucked into this beer as a regular as I have! If you can find it at your store fresh (less than 3 months old) go for the case, it is a winner."
""
""
"Overall - What a delicious and great IPA - this would be a mainstay in my fridge if it were more readily available in my area. A must try - really wish I had a few more of these!"
"Overall - Outstanding IPA, what more can I say?"
""
""
""
"Overall-I was blown away with Union Jack. I'm always searching for heavy citrus levels and I found it with UJ. I highly encourage everyone to try this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the better ipas on the west coast for a fairly decent price. Firestone walker is fast becoming one of my favorite breweries"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good IPA. I could see this being even more impressive if very fresh."
""
"Finishes dry and just begs for another sip. Outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is chewy and dry, with a tangy citrus/pine hops zip. It's all tempered by a smooth malt profile. This is a delicious IPA, and I'm sure it's even better fresher (my bottle was 5 months old)! Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the strongest performers for an IPA in my book, but not sure if it is as drinkable for a short session as some other IPAs might be. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is only the second beer I've had from Firestone Walker, but I've enjoyed both very much (my first being Wookey Jack). I can see myself drinking this one throughout the night due to its fine balance of malt in the finish, which makes the initial hop flavors even better. One of the best balanced IPAs I've had so far."
""
""
""
""
"Impressive - tons of character in this brew. Like someone has driven a truckfull of hops over your palate. The flavour and aroma are fantastic, and it feels balanced despite the malty sweetness. No complaints - if you love hops then this is the beer for you. Grab one if you see it."
""
""
"Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA is a hazy, golden ale with a thin, dense, white head that has great retention and lacing. It has a huge, fruity hop aroma. It smells a touch sweet with otes of orange and caramel. It's pretty full bodied and quite smooth. The finish is a little loose and dusty. It has plenty of hop flavor but it's not very bitter. There is a sort of caramelized flavor to it, like toffee. The flavors don't fuse completely, but all of the different tastes I get out of this are good ones. A little bitterness lingers after the swallow. This is a pretty solid double IPA. It certainly beats most beers."
""
"Overall - This is an excellent well-balanced IPA and the appearance is one of the best I've seen. A great combination of citrus/piney hop flavors with hints of malt/biscuit flavors. This is definitely in my top 3 for India Pale Ales that I have tried to date. This is definitely going to become a more regular go-to beer for me in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a brewery that continues to impress. Would love to try this one right off the line. Competes with the best IPA's."

"O:This is a fantastic IPA, I enjoyed it tremendously lots of good blends, and very fresh brew."
""
"Overall a very good example of the style, not mind blowing in any aspect but very well made everything seems just where it should be. Not sure what I paid for this but if its reasonable I could see adding this to my regular IPA rotation."
""
"O - World Class IPA that stays on the shelf year round. Only other IPA I can compare to is the Stone IPA. Super drinkable and a pretty good deal at your local corner store."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, as good as it gets for the category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a decent strong IPA but nothing jumps out at me. There are a lot of strong syrupy IPA's that have that weird overhopped off-flavor like this one. If I am going to have this style of beer I prefer something from Sierra Nevada or Victory. Their hops just taste better and don't have that weird off flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - My first Firestone Walker, this is such a pleasant, friendly, easy-drinking, well-made beer. It is characterized by softness, to which bitterness plays counterpoint. Imagine drinking filtered cantaloupe juice - this doesn't taste like cantaloupe but it's soft like cantaloupe juice would be. This may join Two Hearted in my category of IPAs for people who don't like IPAs, though I suppose its lingering bitterness after the swallow could disqualify it by a bit among the hop-averse."
""
""
"M: Medium-bodied with a definite mouthcoating character. Medium carbonation. I wouldn't call it refreshing but then again, I wouldn't call most super bitter IPAs refreshing."
""
"T- This is a VERY good IPA. Quite exemplary in my opinion. Solid fruity hop notes and a sweet maltyness. YUM!"
"Bottled on 04/10/12"
""
"overall, not my favorite style, but a really good beer for the hop heads"
""
""
""
""
"There was just an undertone of the citrus rind and metallic hops that characterize so many of the west coast IPA's but there was more to this than the usual California feel that characterize American beers of this style. Yes, this was strong but that's to be expected for a beer of this style. The complexity really shone through here and the carbonation was so perfect that it took a back seat to the flavors and mouthfeel that stood out a bit more. The Union Jack on the bottle was quite fitting as this had a strong foreign feel to it and any hophead of fan of IPA's ought to try this out since a beer like this broadens the definition of what a hoppy beer is capable of being."
""
""
"Top tier American IPA. I’d be hard pressed to think of a better example. Really, really good."
""
""
""
"Overall: Can't believe I haven't had this until now and it's definitely one of my favorite IPA's from California as of now. I will definitely be looking forward to finding it more frequently in the future, as it's a lot more rare up here in northern California. Overall 4.75, awesome, awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a big creamy off-white head. Lacing sticks to the glass like glue. Smell is some fresh forest aromas. Taste is toffee, herbal sweetness up front, followed by some pine cones in the middle, and a bit of grapefruit rind in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Low carbonation. A pretty rich DIPA, don't expect your standard bone dry west coast creation here. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O grows on ya good. First time looking up reviews on it, but been around the block with this one and it's an old sparring bud. Will stand test of time. An easy recommend."
"O: Another great California IPA. A must have for all the hopheads out there. More difficult to find than Racer or Stone but just as good and worth every penny."
"D - A very well made ipa. Great hop character and a thicker than aveage malt character that, despite it's intensity, doesn't get in the way of the hops."
"Overall: this is a very nice beer. The hop character is excellent for a standard IPA. I could drink this all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent IPA that definitely takes risks here and there, but works out very well in the end. It's very good for a casual IPA enthusiast, and pairs very well with many types of food. I would probably stick with the DIPAs which provide the extra ""oomph"" I always desire in the hops department, but it really is an excellent beer that is surprisingly and fantastically balanced. Recommended!"
"overall this is a nice beer. my first time drinking a firestone walker beer, and i feel like i've made a good choice. i don't feel it justifies the price tag on it ($2.50 a bottle is a bit steep when everything else i eyed up was $1 cheaper), but i'm glad i picked it up to at least try it. i've had better ipa's, but this one IS tasty, so i'm not gonna give it a low rating - i'd like to check out some of their offerings.. been sitting on a bottle of sucaba and parabola.. i'll have to drink them soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty American IPA and bordering on a DIPA with it's pretty well-masked 7.5% ABV and superbly jacked up IBUs. A full showcase of Northwestern hop varietals and California-mentality, hop-forward brewing makes Union Jack IPA a new contender for favorite, west-coast American IPA. Excellent!"
""
"Copper-gold in color with a fine lacing left on the glass wall. Spicey, piney hop smell. Great mouthfeel - with finer carbonation. One of the best tasting single IPAs on the market - the hop flavor is almost sweet - good balance with a candied or caramel malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is wonderful, a tangy citrus bite is leveled out by a nice rich sweet malt body, carrying the mango, peach, and pineapple, which is then dried out by a great alpha bill, and finally a residual bitterness that is big but welcome, earthy but one-dimensional and clean. I love the way that the beer tours the drinker through some essential features of American IPAs- the way that sweetnesss can get kicked aside by hop bitterness, the wonders of the bitter linger, the citrusy and piney qualities. I wish that I could get this all the time in Michigan."
"O: Maybe not the best version of this beer, because it was bottle over 3 months ago, but it's pretty solid. I may redo the review once I taste a fresh one, but for now it's a solid beer, but not one that I'd seek out."
""
"kind of a straight-forward, but really tasty and enjoyable IPA - by American standards, it could almost be considered boring, especially to ""hop-heads"" - it's well-constructed despite perhaps leaning a little too toward the fruity hop character (which, honestly, probably has a nudge from esters, no?) - I want to suggest that a different bittering hop would improve this, but I'd have to see the recipe..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nicely balanced IPA. It has a solid hops presence, but it is far from a hops bomb. It is a good, smooth, and easy drinking IPA."
""
"O: I can't really find much fault in this beer but I doubt I'd order it again. I'm looking for more subtlety in an American IPA. I feel that the alcohol level and taste makes this really more of American Double / Imperial IPA which starts at 7%."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really solid IPA. A go to if I could get it more regularly in Indiana."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 5/29/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, herbal, floral, pine, bread, caramel, and light earhy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, bread, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, herbal, pine, caramel, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop flavor complexity; with an awesome balance of malt sweetness with bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is an outstanding IPA. Great hop flavor balance and malt/bitterness balance. Really enjoyed this one, I wish I could get it around me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very solid IPA. This could go up against some double IPAs or some one offs and hold it's own easily. As long as I can get this one fresh, I will continue to buy it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I wish I could get this on the east coast, might be my go to pale ale. Would definatly have again- over and over!"
""
""
"Seems like a solid IPA, but nothing special, it seems dominated by centennial like so many other base line IPA's which makes it rather forgettable."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: A little on the fuller side of medium. A bit thick for a regular IPA. The carbonation is moderate. The finish is long bitter and bone dry. Damn near perfect. One of the best IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice, balanced, drinkable beer. The nose is great, the flavor is malty and well hopped, the alcohol is noticeable but the drinkability is impeccable. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First time every having having it an is a great beer. Very great in color with great pour an nice top heavy head on beer..it is very citrus hop with some bitter mouthful that makes more a great taste with pine after taste. Wonderful choice an is great west coast ipa..highly recommend it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn, this isn't a double? The smell and taste here is huge, not to mention it's a 7.5% beer. The lacing on this one is noteworthy. It goes all the way down. That alongside the deep amber color makes it a beautiful beer. Its taste is pungent of course, but it's got plenty of fruity notes to make up for it. All in all one of the best IPAs out there."
""
"Pours a deep amber with off white head, great lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine with a very pronounced malty sweetness, more reminiscent of double IPA. Taste is exceptional, again leads more with malt than hops, really nice balance and unique sweetness that I can't really compare to another. Very nice IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very drinkable AIPA and very well balanced. Hop forward, but not overpowering. Dangerously drinkable really, the 7.5% ABV is not at all noticeable. A very well made beer and now I wish I had a 6 pack. I will have to pick up and try again when it is closer to the bottled on date to see how the hop flavor holds up over time. If this is what it was like when it was bottled almost 5 months ago, it should be quite good when fresh."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a big bitter orange rind up front followed by some sweet mango and a slight chewy malt. Finishes dry and a little woody. A nice crisp IPA with just enough sweet to balance the bitter hop punch."
""
""
"The flavor is full of hopped bitterness which coats my throat and lingers well beyond the session. Yet the 7.5% ABV is impossible to taste. For people who love hops you are going to like this one."
""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable, easy to drink, and I would gladly have this one again. There is a really nice taste and smell for this beer."
"This is a very good example of an IPA. Not really a shock if you ever had Walker's reserve."
"You REALLY gotta love hops to enjoy this beer. Im a hophead, so I thought this was a quality brew. Borderline double IPA, perhaps a few more IBUs would have put this over the top for me. Not much lacing for the quality of this beer, but a nice head size and great retention. Comparatively speaking, Union Jack easily matches up to other good IPAs, and in some cases surpasses them in quality. I personally would still go for a Stone IPA, but if the store ran out I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up."

"with double jack carving a distinction for itself as one of my favorite DIPAs, i had high hopes for this one and i wasn't disappointed - overall a fantastic IPA; even in a style where a plethora of worthy foes exists, it sets itself apart. definitely one i can see earning a spot in my regular rotation."

"Pours a light golden orange with a slight haze to it. The head is large, fluffy and almost white leaving a little lacing and a small ring on the way down. The aroma is dominated by light citrus hops, especially lemons and oranges with a bit of bready malts mixed in. There is definitely a tropical fruit in the taste as well, when it warms, with lots of the same oranges and lemons from the nose. There is a malt body but the hops come back and leave a strong bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with soft carbonation and medium bodied. This is a very good IPA, very drinkable and dominated by citrus. A nice West Coast IPA."

"O: Great IPA. Everything for a great beer is here with out being in your face or overpowering."

"All around notes of toffee, orange and lemon rind. The balance is nice and it also features some pine overtones. Plenty bitter with a lingering pine and citrus fruit. Medium full in the mouth...again, the taste lingers for a good minute. This is a wonderful IPA worth celebrating."

"o - overall, this is a go to ipa (when within 3 months of bottling date). i regularly keep a 6'er in the fridge and pulled one from the current 6'er in there. will continue to pick this up regularly. FW is one of my fav breweries and for good reason, this is solid. nothing more to say than pick this up...but check the bottle date. cheers to FW for dating each bottle! wish more breweries would do that."
""
"Bottled 5/24/12 Poured into a Victory Donnybrook Stout pint. Clear medium golden beer topped with a nice pillowy eggshell colored head, sticks around awhile too. The nose is hoppy foremost then light fruitiness and malts. The mouthfeel is gentle carbonation, I like that! The hops dominate the palate but I get a nice little fruity note after the swallow. Finishes up nice smooth and very pleasantly bitter. Another winner from this great brewery."

"Unfortunately for me Union Jack fell far short on taste, which in my book is 80 percent of the experience. This brew clocks in at 7.5% ABV and you can taste every bit of that, especially when it warms. Like a shot of rotgut vodka on the back end. Yes it has some nice hoppy grapefruit and caramel flavors but when I can taste the booze on a single IPA, I'm very dissapointed..If you're looking for an IPA to try and haven't tried Ithaca's Flower Power (my personal fav..a very underrated beer IMO), Stone IPA, or Green Flash's West Coast IPA, try those before you give this one a whirl."

"O - This is a great IPA, up there with the best of them. I really like how bold the bitterness is. I'd enjoy a hoppier aroma, but maybe it wasn't the freshest bottle."
"O- A very solid IPA that verges onto the DIPA spectrum. Found in many supermarkets in the NW, this is a solid go to."
"D - If you're familiar with FW, it's exactly what you'd expect from a year-round IPA for them. Fortunately, this means decent."

"Firestone Union Jack IPA, 22 oz bomber: This beer is relatively clear, a deep golden color and topped with a decent head. Good aroma of hop notes. A rich malt comes through in the flavor, mixed with hops that build into a big aftertaste. The Union Jack is a solid IPA and on par with my favorites. A must try if you are into high-end IPAs."

"An insanely drinkable and complex hop monster. The dryness and overall presentation of flavors is reminiscent of a champagne, though not in terms of carbonation. Firestone Walker never disappoints."
"O: Good stuff. A top-notch IPA."
"O. One of my new favorites. An amazing IPA that borders on a double IPA. Hop heads will rejoice but there is definitely something for everyone in this. Cheers."
"O:  Overall, a really well done IPA.  Well balanced, quite tasty, and great drinkability.  I definitely recommend.  "

"This is a beer that I've been dying to try and I'm glad that I did. The aroma and the balance of taste were top notch."
"This is simply a top-notch IPA, hop-forward but balanced at the same time. Definitely straddles the line between single and double, with its high ABV and hefty malt presence. But whatever it is, I like it. I've been thoroughly impressed with Firestone Walker's big beers, and I'm impressed with this one, too."

"Overall: I picked up a case and wish I would have gotten more. If this stays consistently on the shelf at my local shop, I will pick it up regularly. Great Job again Firestone Walker, even though you probably know that."
"O- Union Jack is probably not a beginners IPA and if you like a crisp, hoppy taste then this will shine for you. At 7.5% abv the alcohol is barely present. A keeper."

"O – A truly first class IPA all the way, and one of the better I’ve had. If there’s a critique (and it’s a tiny one), is that the hops deliver only the grassy side of the spectrum as opposed to some IPA’s that offer more versatile hop profiles. Still, a fantastic beer nonetheless."

"Color me surprised, I really didn't think much of this beer at first but it really creeps up on you with the way the mouthfeel is integrated with alot of nice west coast citrus hops and ideal balance."
"Overall: (4.5) An amazing IPA from Firestone, that definitely blurs the line that separates a double IPA from the a single IPA. Matt Brynildsson, the brewmaster of Firestone has been tweaking the hops that they dry hop with during the last 6 months or so, and has now started to dry hop with a little bit of the very tropical smelling hop, Citra. The tropical aromatics only improve this already fabulous IPA. Highly recommended and drink this IPA as with every other IPA, FRESH."

"o- i know people talk about wanting the freshest of ipas. but this beer with three months on it is still incredibly hoppy and delicious. awesome beer."
"O- This is a great IPA and I can't wait to get more. I feel this is a lot better than the Double Jack I had last summer. Now the fact that FW won best mid-size brewery at the World Beer Cup makes sense."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 4/18/12. Pours a clear orange, with a one inch head that leaves lovely lacing. Smell is tangerine, pineapple, grass, grapefruit, and carmel. Taste is very balanced and matches the nose perfectly, a slight pine/grapefruit finish. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not dry, and very drinkable. This is one of the best I have ever had and now that we can get it in New Hampshire my new staple."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a shaker glass a clear coppery amber with a medium white lasting head, with good lacing. Aroma of floral piney hops, caramel malt and some citrus notes fill the senses. Taste is of floral piney hops, grapefruit and citrus notes along with some caramel malt flavor. A medium smooth body with good carbonation on the palate. The finish is sweet caramel malt, citrus notes followed by some good floral piney hops on the end for balance. Flavor and aroma of caramel malt becomes stronger as it warms up. Overall a very good well rounded and tasty IPA."
""
"This is one of the best IPA's that i have had next to Zombie Dust, Heady Topper, and the Furious,This beer just came to new hampshire, awesome!! I would of gave it all fives, but the smell is very light on this one. Specially after you take a wiff of Heady Topper. will keep this one on stock for sure."

"22oz bottle bought from City Beer Store in SF. Pours a dark, clear amber with a decent amount of carbination. Tastes very balanced with citrus, pine, and a malt backbone finish. The 7.5% alcohol is well hidden in this one and its very easy to drink. Very decent IPA overall."
""
""
""
"O: This is my first brew from Firestone and it won't be the last!"
""
"M: Best part. Medium body but so smooth. Its silk, in a delicious beer. This beer is making love to my mouth."

""
"This brew pours a beautiful light copper color with 1 1/2 fingers of an off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is of citrus and pine with a light hint of malt. The taste is of orange rind, pineapple and balanced well with sweet malt. The aftertaste is nice and slightly dry and beckons another sip. One of the best single IPA's period."
"Poured from a bottle to a duvel tulip. Pours a clear blonde orange with a 2 inch white head that slowly shrinks with great lacing. Aroma is strong. Very floral, grassy, and citric. Taste is grapefruit, caramel, pineapple, mango, papaya, orange, and a touch of lemon. Mouthfeel is medium to thin. Alcohol is invisible. This beer is super sessionable and a perfect go to ipa."

""
"Pours a clear golden amber with an off white head. Nearly no head retention, but FW beers rarely do retain a head. So much sticky lacing that the glass almost appears to be frosted. Wonderful grapefruit and floral hop bouquet. Slick on the front of the tongue and finely scrubby on the back. The taste is a little disappointing just because the nose is so remarkably appetizing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate. Really good beer, just not great."

"The beer felt good, a medium body to it with the right carbonation. The beer did leave a sticky finish. The beer was very easy to drink and I would want to drink more than one if I had not had others before it. There was also a slight alcohol presence noted as the beer warmed. Overall, perhaps one of the best IPA's that I have had."

"Overall, I would highly recommend this. I've yet to have anything from Firestone Walker that I haven't enjoyed, and this is no exception. More aggressive than the DBA (which is still one of my favorites), and less aggressive than the Double Jack. Firestone did a good job on this beer and on all their other brews, too. If you're ever debating, then debate no longer."
"Balanced malt & hop bitter. Rivals Hop Stoopid as a favorite in the house. Apparently Firestone Walker has entered Western New York market."
"Great American IPA. Great version of the style. Biter, juicy, distinctive and hoppy. Great IPA."
""
""
""
""

"O- I have to go back to the store for more of this one. Damn! Certainly one of the very best American IPAs. I couldn’t be more pleased that fresh Union Jack has arrived in my neighborhood, and hope it visits often."
""
""
""
"Wow. It's not often I find a brand new ipa that I like as much as this one; a rating of 5 on taste is a rarity for me. This truly is a delicious beer and I would love to find more; I was only able to find a single serve bottle on clearance at a local co-op store. It's hoppy and bitter but still very tasty, and this is what I look for in a delicious ipa. If you're. Fan of the style you met give it a try if you find it. You won't be disappointed!"
""
""
"O- Overall I think this is a terrific left-coaster. My bottle was dated Oct 2011 so I am pretty sure it wasnt the freshest sample ever, but it was delicious. Would do again and again."
""
""
"O: Very good, unoffensive IPA. Due to the lighter malt backbone, goes down easier than a beer like the GF Palate Wrecker in our tasting, though it was a bit stickier than double jack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the top IPA's I've had (75+ different to date). Lots of sweet, lots of bitter. Pleasant, complex, and nicely balanced."
""
""

"O: Not a bad year-round brew from Firestone. Between this and Double Jack, I'm not overly impressed but they aren't bad. I'd certainly drink this on a summer day."
""
""

"O: A quality IPA from Firestone Walker. They know how to brew hop nectar beers in the West coast style!"
""
"Overall, excellent, better than the growler. I didn't expect that."

""
"A very tasty, well balanced, easy drinking beer. It's a little thin on the body, but get it fresh when you can."
"O: Very solid brew, would definitely buy again. Didn't even notice the ABV until the bomber was empty..."
" Not the most complex ipa, but solid."
""
"O: It's the drinkability quality that brings this beer to the top for me. Don't get me wrong, it’s not Hopslam or Heady Topper, but in terms of a ""Go To"" IPA, this one should be at the top of your list."
"Refrigerator (in stock at all times) caliber."

"Pours a bright copper color with a sizable foamy bright white head. Nice noticeable nose of the traditional american IPA scents, grapefruit, citric and pine. Smells good. Full mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Bright clean and crisp, flavors follow the nose. Hop bitterness is high. Can get a bit much after a bit, but other wise a pretty good IPA. Not for those who like that intense building bite. The carbonation breaks apart the body a bit on the back end adding to the slightly displeasing finish. I can see others loving this though."
"Overall (4.5/5): As a ""hophead", I was very excited to finally have the opportunity to try FW's Union Jack. Now, sometimes fans of very hoppy beers can experience a bit of a letdown, such as when the beer is not as über-hoppy as billed or because the bottle isn't as fresh as the drinker hoped. Neither of these factors came into play. The beer lived up to its reputation in a big way and I now understand why it's such a highly regarded IPA. I cannot stress enough how highly I think of this beer and how much I recommend it to anyone that likes hoppy beers, IPA's in particular. If you're one of those people, just buy the whole sixer–you won't regret it."
"Mouth and carbonation are perfect for this beer. I hate to say its a hop delivery system, because this beer isn't a hop bomb. But everything is clearly set up for the hops. Just a really well made beer. Goes onto my 'search out and purchase when seen' list."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- fantastic iPa would be great session beer"
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On date of 02/08/12. Pours a translucent bright amber color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. Big whiff of grapefruit and some citrus hops. A bit tropical. Taste is of citrus hops and grapefruit rind. Bitter citrus at the finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Damn good IPA that has more alcohol flavor than I'd expect from the 7.5% ABV. Overall, this is a well made IPA with a great amount of grapefruit bitterness. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's complex, it's rich, it's got so much going on. This is one of my favorite IPA's. It seems to give me something new each time I have it. If someone offered to bring me any beer of my choice from California, I'd probably choose this."
""
""
"O- One of the best tasting IPA's I've had. Hop heads will geek out."
"Thanks Jim in Trevose."

"For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection. A ""Wow!"" beer for sure. 7.5 % abv."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the fresh hop aroma, and the corresponding hop bite through the flavoring. The hops took on several forms throughout, with citrus, pine, and earth all being presented. This is a quintessential West coast IPA, exhibiting all of the typical hop madness one would expect from California, without ignoring the other components, or the inevitable need for balance."

"A phenomenal beer even though it's not a hoppy monster. First time enjoying and well worth the wait. 4.5"

"2-19-13 upgrading this brew after having it on tap at House of 1000 beers in PA and getting a growler to share with friends. The floral notes are great and the alcohol is subtle."

"This beer does not disappoint. It is among the better single IPA's available. With a very diverse palate, this beer could certainly be a hit with a larger audience."
""
""
"O: this is a perfect beer for the spring and summer the temperature warms up. It's got a great balance and is full of tropical fruits and is light-medium body. Drinkability is high with this one and alcohol is unnoticeable."
""
"The medium body carries a great amount of flavor while remaining refreshing and easily sippable. The carbonation is just barely prickly, creating a very crisp mouthfeel. The swallow is a bit foamy and the finish is clean."
""
"Its very juicy and like an IPA nectar as well. Its tart and makes your mouth pucker. This beer is extremely top notch and anybody searching for an amazing IPA should definitely see this one out. I like this one better than their double IPA."
"Overal - nicely crafted but not well rounded enough for me"
""
"O-A good IPA, however having this after Nugget Nectar it may have diminished this beer by comparison."
"One of my preferred AIPAs thus far. Packs a whole lot of hoppiness in a complex and superbly crafted ale. Would love to session this regularly if not for the 7.5% abv."
""
"O: A decent IPA. Fairly well balanced and drinkable. Could mistake the ABV for less. A good mix of fruity and bitter hops."
""
""
"O- another homerun from FW"
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours a translucent amber with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head. Head qickly dissipates into a creamy bullseye dollop and a thin, tight band around the shoulders. Spots and spatters of lacing coat the walls of the glass. Nose expresses citrus notes, cat urine (simcoe hops) and a trace of tropical fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit more muted. There is also some residual bitterness that lingers between quaffs that is intermingled with the cat urine expressed in the nose. Body is medium-light (but closer to light) with a slightly coarse carbonation as well as some acidity that peaks out towards the back. Overall, a decent IPA with a well-hidden abv, but I don't think it deserves the hype."
"A tasty IPA that I will pick up again."
"O- Thank goodness F.W. has finally made it's way to upstate NY!!! This a really good IPA. Wish it had more balance in the nose. Very drinkable and no sign of the alcohol."
"O - Hands down one of the best IPA's I've ever had."
""
""
"O: This was really good. West coast suds all the way."
""
"overall: awesomeness.. best ipa i've had"
""
""
""
""
"You can't ask for much more in a ipa: you get hops, malt, alcohol, complexity, and refreshment. this is a classic in the style and its no wonder its gained notoriety and fame over the years. I will drink this one when I can and I'm not even a huge hophead."
""
""
"Note to self - this beer is awesome"
""
""
"Poured a nice golden brown with a thin layer of head. Smelled boldly of fresh hops with a hint of lemon. Tasted crisp and clean and had a great mouth-feel. Overall a well-crafted IPA but nothing about it made me put it on a pedestal."

""
""
""
"O: A truely wonderful IPA. Maybe my favorite. Similar in profile to smutty (More citrus/tropical hop profile). Although this brew beautifully showcases hops, it has a wonderfully developed malt backbone. I love these 1.5 IPA's, this one is cloer to a double in flavor though. An absolute staple."
""
""
""
"I was really blown away by this beer, and this was even after having a Hopslam prior to drinking this. A wonderfullly hoppy IPA, in fact, I'd almost say this is a DIPA in disguise. Huge aroma, huge flavor, but a substantial body that almost reminds me more of a typical east-coast IPA. Or maybe a body similar to Modus Hoperandi, now that I think of it. At any rate, an excellent balance on all fronts. This is the type of malt/hop flavor that I strive for in all my homebrewed IPAs. If this is distributed by you, and you haven't tried it yet, grab it and enjoy!"
""
"O: This is a fantastic, top tier example of the style. Its pushing the limits of a DIPA, but one could argue that the abv is on the low end of the border line, and its more balanced than a standard DIPA. I would absolutely recommend for a hop head. Get it if you can."
"O: An excellent IPA, borderline DIPA I think. Big hop bitterness with a nice variety of flavors. Sweetness of the malt barely gets to balance it out but it works. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"On tap. Pours a clear light amber with a one finger white head that has good retention and leaves a large amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is pine hops, a bit of grapefruit, caramel, and sugar cookie. Smells pretty sweet. The initial taste is sweet with pine and grapefruit, then some sugar cookie and a bit of caramel. Pretty sweet overall. The finish has a light bitterness. It would probably benefit from some more bitterness. Medium body. Low carbonation. A bit too sweet overall."
""
"Light body with sharp carbonation. Overall this one is pretty tasty. Real enjoyable."
"Pale orangey colour, one finger of white head, nice lace left on the glass. Smell is full of citrus and tropical fruit, mango, pineapple and grapefruit, some malt is there as well but this nose is just loaded with hop. Taste follows the nose with more citrus and tropical fruits up front, pineapple and mango, malt i8n the secondary and is more present in the taste than the nose suggests, bready and tropical aftertaste. Med carbonation, lightly creamy as well, oily and slick resins, medium-full body. Really good IPA, almost like a 1.5 IPA, one of the better IPA's I have had in a while."
""
""
"DOA"
"Overall (4.0): Don’t quite get the difference between the hop palate and the hop nose. Not a bad IPA by any means, and good for the style, but whatever this particular hop profile is, it’s not quite my preference, that’s for sure. Good beer, and I’d like to try again—maybe the bottle wasn’t the greatest? Y’never know."
"$3 a single."

"O-Only dissapointment here is that I hadn't tried this sooner."
"Very nice beer here. It's a bit one-sided, but there's room for such beers in the beer universe. A touch of malt, and a 50% reduction in price, and I'd have myself a go-to IPA. At this price, however, it's a one-timer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rather light and lively mouthfeel. Overall, a top notch IPA with one of the best aromas I've come across in a long time."
"Pours a golden yellow, light amber mix. Really clear. Bright white head with pretty good lacing throughout. Good citrus aroma. Orange zest, grapefruit and lesser notes of mango. Juicy fresh hop aroma for sure. Flavor is really hop busy. All different kinds of hops join the party. Goes from bitter, to sweet, to bitter and what seems like back again. Busy on the tongue. Both subtle sweet orange notes and more bitter/sour grapefruit citrus open the hop profile up. Hints of tropical fruits are less present than in the aroma, but contribute. Pine resin notes close this one out. Nice crisp hopiness without being too sweet, bitter or relient on one or two specific flavors. Really good mix of hops that leave you guessing."
""
""
""
""

"O: Love this beer. One of my favorite ""single"" IPAs. It's a bit closer to a DIPA but it's amazing. Huge citrus flavors and big caramel malts. So well balanced. I could drink this anytime. Flavors linger nicely."

""
"O: Excellent IPA – nice and hoppy and very enjoyable."
""
""
""

"Wow. What a well balanced beer. Pours a nice heady lacing deep orange onto my goblet. The smell in the bottle is great. Very piney and grapefruity but th taste is even better. Can't believe how the sweet fruity taste of mango and pears jump out. What a fine example of west coast IPA. It has a wonderful medium body and the alcohol is barely discern able. Overall one of my favorite IPAs and it is no wonder they boast their awards on the cap. Cheers."

"The brew pours golden-tan, with scents of sharp citrus-pine immediately present.   Soft notes of honey-malt reveal themselves on a deeper inhale, but the nose is primarily crisp hops.    Carrying through on the palate, the hop-presence pops right out at the front; crisp, bitter and slightly resinous.   The medium-bodied ale yields just the right amount of malt-sweetness the make this a highly drinkable IPA.   A touch of alcohol breaks up any residue between swallows, accenting the brew's crisp overtone.   Tasty and sessionable, Union Jack is an a great example of an accessible West Coast-style IPA. "

"An ipa that is light on the tropical fruit presence but big on manga and papaya pulp characteristics, this one lies in a style that I'm not usually too fond of. However, this is a solid beer because of the incredible mouthfeel and the great balance overall. Worth a try."

"real nice big ipa. pours a lighter than the taste golden hay color with a big bad white foam head. smell is sweet hops, citrusy and in your face. falvor is fruity hops. im picking up grapefruit and clementine (jam). the mouthfeel is as good as an ipa can be, its creamy and expanding. it makes this beer. the hops just grows and grows as you hold it in, heavenly. medium bodied but it feels light, cloud nineish. perfect bitter carbonation and then enduring wet finish. the mouthfeel is the ticket here. great ipa, i like it better even than their doublejack. 7.5& too. magic"

"o - highly recommended, right up there with the best of em"
""
"M: Prickly carbonated intro, with a medium body--extremely drinkable. Very dry finish."
""
""
"Overall- Extravagant for something going by the rather ubiquitous ""IPA"" moniker. Probably my favorite example of the style to date, it's perfectly balanced and dangerously drinkable. I only discovered this brew fairly recently, but we are becoming fast friends."

"This brew is amazing. Great hop flavor but well balanced, refreshing, crisp, and really just great. What can I say that hasn't been said already. Such a great IPA."
"This a wondeful IPA. Nice floralness to it. Slight bitter hop taste. Smooth. A bit of a complex vegetable taste to it. There's even a bit of a dark fruit flavor there. Nice in that it doesn't over due any one thing."
"O- Welll developed, but lacking that wow factor. Would have liked to see a broader hop profile."
"A fantastic tasting IPA what more can I say."
"D/O- I found Union Jack to be very drinkable, probably it's greatest attribute. All around very solid IPA. Thanks PTMcB for a beer that I've just never ran across before."
"O: Really nice IPA. Great combination of pine and citrus, very easy drinking, especially at a high ABV for style."
""
""
""
"O - The aroma on this IPA is world class, but the taste is a bit too one-sided."
"This pours a caramel-straw color. There’s a floral, piney aroma with some malt to it. Tastes delicious, with pine and floral hops, grapefruit and citrusy essential oils. Bit of a chewiness gives it some heft and a tongue-curling bitter finish. I liked it."
"O: I’ve heard good things about Union Jack and it did not disappoint. I’ll be drinking this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Extremely solid IPA that blends the best aspects of east and west coast styles. Hoppy, fresh, and plenty of bang for your buck. I will be trying everything I can find from Firestone Walker, they're 2-2."

"Had the Union Jack IPA at the local watering hole...Tap House....and the beer is GOOD!!! The color was a clear golden copper with 1/2 finger thick white head tha laced all the way down the glass. The smell included bitter citrus with pine. The taste was initially bitter, but after a few swigs it mellowed out and was quite tasty. The mouthfeel was a medium body beer with good carbonation. The abv was present to start then tailed off. Overall this was a very good IPA and highly receommended."

"Notes: A solid American i.p.a all over. Cheers."
"O- This is my first 6 pack, what have I been waiting for? Great IPA."
""
""
"im not sure if this is supposed to be a balanced ipa, but thats how it came off to me. luckily i purchased this as a single and dont have 5 other old bottles to drink, but overall this was still pretty decent. i can see this being really nice fresh as some of the flavors were very muted. ill be sure to be on the look out for some fresher bottles. however, still kind of surprising that this is an old bottle seeing as how this just became available in my area."
""
""
""
"O: I'm thrilled that FW sixer distribution worked it's way into the Chicago market. This is such a nice six pack to have as a staple year-round offering. A bold, rich, juicy IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
"Overall: A very good beer. If you are an IPA fan and haven't tried it then you should give it a shot. If you've tried it and liked it for the price buy more. I wish it was available fresh in my area but I feel this is the equivalent of Ranger IPA and not as good as Odell IPA."
""
"This overall is a nice ipa, i poured it into a BBC pint glass and it is a nice orange-ish color with a small white head and a bit of lace around the glass. it has a nice grapefruit zesty scent to it. It has a medium body mouth feel, certainly a good beer, and well balanced"
""
""
"O: A very pleasant and fairly strong hop aroma/taste, nice level of sweetness with good drinkability. This one is right up there with Double Jack, probably even surpassing it with the lack of booziness."
"The unique flavor of this IPA really brings back a flood of memories for me. Nicely balanced, this one is a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-One of if not the best IPA in my books, so glad it made it to Colorado."
"Union Jack is a good IPA, but it could be better. The hop profile is a bit too earthy, herbal, and oily for me. I guess it makes sense that I had similar issues with Double Jack. Regardless, this is certainly worth a try."
""

"O - This is a great IPA. Absolutely glad that Firestone Walker has come to Missouri. This will be a 'go-to IPA'."

"This is a solid west coast IPA. Another great Firestone offering. I will definitely be back for more."

""

"I love Double Jack so I thought it was about time I try a Union Jack. The aroma is insanely good. The hops are pungent and fresh, reminds me of the fresh hop beers we see in the Fall. The palate doesn't let down either. Pine needles, orange zest, grapefruit flesh, and all the typical American IPA hop characteristics are big, bold, and dominating. The sticky, oily body makes for a bitter and long lasting finish. The flavor, aroma, and 7.5% ABV approach DIPA levels, but are restrained just enough and with a superior balance that allows it to maintain a shocking level of drinkability, at least for hop heads. I have had few beers with this much flavor intensity that were still this easy to drink. Clearly one of the better American IPAs available in a 6pk, glad this one finally made it to KC."
""
"Solid, straight up IPA. Great dynamic between citrus fruit flavors and earthy pine ones. West Coast but anyone can appreciate a beer like this."
""
""
""
""
"Nice IPA, reminds me of the fall harvest ones quite a bit (is it one?). I liked it alot more than Double Jack."
""
""
"O - A fine example of a piney hop forward IPA. I like that they didn't try to balance too much sweetness and kept it crisp and sharp. Will definitely be buying this one again."
"o- i can see why everyone is all about this. A west coast ipa that is big time hoppy and bitter. Thanks for coming to cuse!!!!"
""
""
""
"Being on the East Coast, and fated to a dreary existence in the People’s Republic of Maryland, I do not get ready access to this fine West Coast brewer; however, their beers do intrigue me (See my review for “Double Jack”) and make me lust for more."
""
"Great IPA. Nice clean flavors and aromas. Somewhere in between a balanced IPAs and the completely unbalanced ones. It seems like the hops are delicately balanced over a small amount of malt. Either way, it works well."
""
""
""
"M-Nice mouthfeel. Hop oils coat the mouth leaving a long lingering taste of tropical fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good IPA with a bright citrus-peel flavor that reminds me of a handful of other IPAs (Southern Tier and Clipper City come to mind). I generally prefer something with a more varied and complex hop flavor, but I'd definitely drink this one again. Glad Firestone Walker finally hit this area."
"D - Drinkable. Good winter beer. Good holiday beer. Tastes like the holidays in the same way Starbucks' holiday blend tastes like christmas. Yummy."

"Pours a cloudy orange/copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, citrus hops, slight yeast, hint of citrus (pomegranate?), and hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hint of pine, sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, alcohol, hint of citrus, hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
""
"I love hoppy IPAs and this is definitely one of my new favorites."
"O - This bottle wasn't quite as fresh as I prefer for an IPA, and as a result, the hops didn't jump out at me quite as much as I had hoped. However, this is still a very smooth and drinkable IPA with a nice overall flavor. The next time I purchase this beer, I hope to find a fresh bottle to fully experience the intended hop experience."
""
"O: A delicious, somewhat rare IPA. I've been meaning to try this one and was excited to see it on tap at the bar last night. A definite go-to IPA, competing for the title with the Stone IPA."
""
""
"The appearance is a clear deep apple cider color with a 1 finger head that laces and sticks around the glass. Big sticky hop on the nose traces of grapefruit, mango, and other citrus hops fill the nose. The malt and the alcohol are hidden behind the huge hop blast. The taste is amazing, so sweet and subtle. Again, citrus hops dominate the flavor, with a strong malt backbone. Big mango, and piny flavors all around, big aspriny bitter on the finish. This is medium in body and feel, nice and sugary, bitter, yet creamy and smooth to drink. This beer is awesome overall, really glad it made it to NY. I'm def going to consume this sucker regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely worth trying at least once. A better than average IPA."
"O/D-Yeah, this is one hell of an IPA. Definitely has a unique hop bouquet that I really enjoy. Goes down easy. Now becomes one of the better 6-pack IPAs I have had. Just oh so solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I get sad when I realize this still isn't available to me at all times. A very nice compliment of hop complexity paired with a full malt profile makes for a nice drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"No doubt one of the finest American IPAs out there! Brynildson is indeed the hop master"
"O: Very balanced and on the sweeter side, I could see this IPA being enjoyed by people who cannot handle their bitter tasting IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this previously on tap, and I must say there is almost no difference between the two. The only difference I could think of is perhaps the shade of the bottled version is a tad lighter than the tapper version. But that could be due to factors pertaining to light. All in all, I think this is a fantastic IPA, another winner from the west coast. Definitely worth a try and highly recommended if you are a hop-head."
""
""
""
""
"M - Clean, crisp, fresh, with slight carbonation. Hops! Perfect bitterness for hop heads. I could drink this all day. And probably pass out before I grow tired of it."
""
""
""
"D - A really nice and refreshing IPA - I'm going to have to pick this up regularly. Impressed that this tasted so good after nearly two months - I would have guessed 4-6 weeks tops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a great IPA, one of the better single IPAs I have had. Perfect balance between hop and caramel malt sweetness, in an extremely drinkable brew."
""

"Overall, this is a great IPA that ranks up there with the best of them. This will be in regular rotation now that it's available in IL."

"12 oz into a tulip...sure looks nice, light bodied with a big head that laces well. Lots of citrus in the nose and on the tongue. Not as aggressive as some IPAs. Well balanced. Hides the alcohol very well. Hard to believe this is over 7%, it is very smooth. I'll definitely buy this one again. Recommended."
"12 oz. bottle. pours a clear light amber with a smallish white head, fading to a ring around the glass with decent lacing throughout. aroma of grapefruit, some orange and pine. flavor has some sticky malt sweetness, but this one has a nice lingering bitterness through-out. low carbonation, just enough to bring it all together. finding a beer like this is why I still enjoy trying new ( to me ) and untried beers. very nice IPA!"
"Very sweet, malty ipa, with a tart hop edge. All pine and grass. But mostly a caramel and butter malt. Very sweet."
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! This stop pours a clear straw topped by a finger of thick light cream-white foam. The nose comprises pineapple, light mango, lime zest, lemon zest, mandarin orange, and honey-dripped biscuits. The taste holds notes of pine needles, light pineapple, light orange zest, light banana peel, biscuit, and cracked wheat. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very tasty IPA. Straight up. 'Nuff said. Get some!"
"An awesome brew..."
"O- I like it a lot. Great hoppy IPA."
"Overall, this is a nice IPA. It has a nice hop profile and isn't over-the-top bitter."
"M / O. Sharp carbonation and big hop flavor makes this a sipper. It all works well, and if you'r e in the mood for a big pants West Coast IPA (DIPA...) grab a Union Jack. I'm pretty sure this is Dreadnaught's baby brother. Tasty stuff!"
"O- A really good IPA that I've overlooked for quite some time. Firestone has impressed me a lot from what I've tried. A well balanced IPA to seek out."
"O: This beer is downright spectacular. Top marks all around."
"So FW is finally coming to PA and this is the first time I have seen this on draft. Did is disappoint? No way, what a great, great, prototypical west coast IPA that stands with the best."
"Pours a bright golden amber color with dense cap of white froth, good lacing. Scent is fruity and floral, citrus and splashes of pine before a sweet, biscuty malt backbone presents itself. taste leads with a clean and crisp sweet lemon flavor, solidly bitter with some pine resin notes, sweet and clean biscuity malt backbone. Medium bodied, lightly oily and smooth. A decent IPA, a touch sweet."
"Pours an orange firey golden with a white head. Aroma is piney, citrus and its rind, toffem and some biscuit. Flavor follows suit. A crisp, medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, fantatic IPA one of my personal favorites. Definitely a Top 3 IPA."
"Overall a very good beer. Jumps straight into my top 5 IPAs."
"Very impressive beer. Growing up in Michigan, cutting my craft teeth on Bell's, it can often be hard for me to admit to liking an IPA more than Two Hearted. Union Jack is making that a bit more difficult at the moment. These two beers have their similarities, it is not a surprise I enjoy both so much. The balance, the assertive citrus flavor from the hops and the absurd drinkability make both hard to beat. Luckily, or unfortunately, for me I do not have to choose between the two. When and if Firestone makes their way to The Great Beer State my decisions may be a bit more difficult. Tremendous beer, one to seek out."
"Overall Impression- Very impressed with this IPA! I'm a huge fan of the Double Jack by Firestone and am glad this one turns out similar except without all the ABV's. I would definitely go for this one again if available... Sucks we can't get many of these Firestone's in MO."
"I’ve had this many times, but had yet to rate it. It seemed to be a bit high for my liking, but maybe that’s just me being a Firestone homer. Either way, a clean and crisp IPA that goes down smooth."
"Once again, I am very impressed with a FW beer. Precise and on point are the best way I can describe their brews."
"O- Awesome ipa! This is the first chance I have had to try this beer and this will be one of my few go to ipa's from there on out!"
"overall: solid solid stuff"
"Pours a brilliant clear orange amber with a small frothy head made up of complex tiny bubbles. Lacing sings as it sticks to the sides of the glass. This is what a beer, especially an IPA, should look like. The first whiff of Union Jack yields a tantalizingly complex aroma of fresh mango and tangy pineapple. This is accentuated by a light grassy pine somewhere off in the background. The first taste is sublime. Sweet candy malt hits the palate first, before being washed away by perfect bitterness. As the palate acclimates the beer becomes almost juicy, like you are biting into ripe piece of citrus, again I think of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Lots of that heavy-duty lupulin taste hangs out in the middle of the beer, the ones that only the really great IPAs seem to capture. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, and isn’t watery at all, though it is almost slightly creamy. Despite the initial wave of sweetness up front, Union Jack leaves the palate dry and begging for more."
"D+"
"A huge smacking of hops is the name of the game here. They are bold and intense in the grapefruit citrus and pine hop department. The touch of sweet from citrus hits the tongue first, followed by a hammer-like hit of bitterness from a combination of pine and grapefruit hops. The hops dance around the palate uninhibited, lingering in the finish and aftertaste. A bread-like malt is there briefly, adding balance and depth to the onslaught of hop flavor. A citrus undertone swirls around the bitterness and malts, creating an ultimately satisfying beer all around. A very small twinge of alcohol permeates the intensity of the other flavors, but it is so minute that it gets forgotten easily. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but gritty, finishing bone-dry. This is a fantastic IPA, one that I would always have in my fridge when I start craving hops, or just a really well done IPA. Great stuff."
"Cheers"
"O - You can certainly feel the 7.5% alcohol, but its buried well in a stampede of raging flavor. Wish it was around 5% so I could drink a billion at a time. Solid drank."
"O - A delicious brew. I like how the oak and spice play off the sweetness and bitterness. I'd be happy with this as a go to IPA in the home fridge. Good stuff."
"94."
"O: Overall this beer is just plain awesome. Appearance is great, Smell is great, Taste is great, Mouthfeel is great. This is what an IPA should be day in and day out. 4.5"
"O- Very unique tasting IPA. Tasty. definitely wouldn't mind revisiting this beer often"
"Overall - I love Double Jack and this is a very good IPA as well. I would definitely recomend it, especially when you don't really want to tackle a Double IPA."
"Bright copper color with a white head. Thick curtains of lace hang on the glass. The smell is citrus and tropical fruit. This is a very hoppy beer. Pine and pineapple with a powdery dry malt finish. The alcohol rises at the end, cutting back a bit on drinkability. I would definitely buy another six pack (though it was a bit expensive)."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I'd love to drink it on a regular basis."
"O: I think this is a really wonderful IPA. It's smooth, simple, and delicious. It's an easy drinking beer that could quickly throw you into drunkenness at 7.5%."
"Nose was very sweet and fruity with notes of pineapple and mango. A slightly hazed yellow-orange beer. the head with thin but liked to produce a lot of lace. Flavors dry and citrusy but with a firm malt background and complimenting hoppiness rather than being cumbersome. Bitterness really only evident in the aftertaste where it rounds things out and reminds you that you are drinking an IPA. The beer has a very clean, crisp, slightly spicy freshness that is quite nice."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering feel on the tongue. Exceptionally drinkable, nicely balanced IPA - I want more."
"I really think this is a superb IPA; one of the best I've ever had and exactly what I look for in this style. The hop characteristics are very refined, full of subtle fruity notes and not just a bitter bomb. Yum. So fresh, could drink this one all day and night."
"(This was reviewed simultaneously by 5 people from the same bottle.)"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice frothy white head that has good retention. Smells of grapefruit,orange, pineapple... smooth mouthfeel.. perfect amount of carbonation... hops, then sweetness, then citrus, then hops... its bouncing all over which I like. Not just a bunch of bitterness... this beer is excellent... go out and try it now!!!"
"Overall: A good ipa. Great aroma."
"A nice lemony IPA, if thats your thing."
"Overall: A very good IPA. Reasonable price and pretty available so will probably run into this again."
"O – A fantastic IPA. Among the best I’ve had."
"Palate: Mouthfeel is tangy and full but not overbearing. feels great on the tongue. the taste is bitter with floral and citrus flavors. very well balanced, full but not overbearing."
"O: This is a great IPA. Balanced, tasty, sweet, bitter, great smell. Really top notch."
"Overall, a nicely balanced and enjoyable beer."
"Had it on draft before, reviewed based on bottle."
"A solid looking, deeply bronzen IPA... Nose and Taste ring true to other FW beers I've had.... a nice solid hoppy nose - some citrus notes, bit of grapefruit on the mouth and a nice fresh end. I'd be interested what it was like fresh, marked 2010, I just picked it up tonight. Either way, I'd drink another."
"Overall, an awesome IPA. I will definitely be getting more of this one."
"Big thanks goes out to whitebricke for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Keeping the IPA trend alive at my new place with whitebricke having provided all of them so far... Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow orange with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, orange, citrus hop, and grapefruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, subtle grapefruit, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a really good brew. Very easy to drink and quite refreshing. No sign of the alcohol at all. The flavor on this one was really nice and the subtle dark chocolate note I picked up on added a very nice touch to the otherwise very citrusy flavors going on here. The aroma was very well balanced and nice. A definite must try in my book!"
"O: WOW. I'm impressed. This is about as good as an IPA gets. Run, don't walk, to get this brew."
"Poured dark gold with a 1/2 inch white head. The aroma was a blend of piney hops along with some honey and syrup notes. The taste was very refreshing. It was balanced for an IPA, not too hoppy or too dry. Overall it was a very flavorful hop forward beer that was made with care, it's not just an overly aggressive hop bomb. This was the first beer I've had in FW's regular rotation. It's good to see that they can brew a great beer that isn't 10% alcohol and barrel aged. This beer was very well done."
"O: a wonderful representation of the style, absolutely love the brew, love the citrus hop notes and couldn't be happier with yet another firestone walker brew"
"O- Good IPA would have liked a lot less malts in the taste and have it more hop-centric."
"O - This is about as perfect of an IPA that I have had the privilege to enjoy. If you have the opportunity and are a fan of IPA's, this is one you definitely need to enjoy."
"This beer pours a perfect golden copper color. It has a nice fluffy 2-finger off-white head on it. The head has good retention and leaves behind some nice lace on the glass. There are some nice bready and caramel malt smells, as well as a big piney hop presence. There are also some notes of tropical fruit and citrus. The taste starts off with a nice caramel malt background. There is a big piney bite to it, Also, I am getting some fruit flavors and some citrus. The hops are definitely the star here. The finish is of lingering hop bitterness. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a nice lingering hop bitterness in the finish. This has amazing drinkability. I didn't want to set my glass down for a minute. Out of all the IPAs I have had so far, this is probably my favorite. The flavor is amazing and it has wonderful balance to it. It is everything I ever wanted in an IPA. Glorious."
"O - Awesome brew. Super glad FSW is now distributing their brews to CO!!! Keep the awesome brew coming!"
"A slightly hazy, somewhat translucent golden color with about an inch of foamy white head with some wet lacing. The nose is greeted with loads of citrus, then some bitter hops, and a nice caramel backbone in the rear. Taste begins with the citrus, moves into some muted hops, and finishes with a velvety malt flavor. Mouth is very well balanced. It's not as bitter as expected, but still has some hop bite to it and is rather smooth. Finishes slightly dry. Overall, a great IPA."
"Overall, I liked it a lot. It's definitely one of my got-to IPAs, and absolutely refreshing on a warm day"
"O: Very easy drinking, and a fantastic compliment to food. Would definitely buy this one again."
"O – An IPA that is confident in its character, Imperial? kiss my ass… All the flavor and very good drinkability. My first Firestone brew and it will not be my last. 4.5"
"O - This is my idea of a perfect IPA. The balance is ideal for my palette. The hops make their presence known without overwhelming the rest of the flavors or destroying the taste buds. This is going to become a permanent fixture in my rotation. Highly recommended."
"Definitly well worth the effort of finding."
"O- If you like hops you will enjoy this beer, if hops aint your thing then move along this beer is not for you."
"Overall, a nice IPA. Very similar to Odell's IPA. Also, more balanced than the Double Jack (but not as good IMO)."
"Sublimely drinkable. Slightly less hop bittering than I remember on cask but the flavor is there and I nearly polished off the growler myself"
"O - A very solid IPA. Would like to know how old it was, but there was a nice hop character, so seemed pretty fresh. Would have again."
"I loved this IPA and would buy a case of it"
"Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Copper hue looked great in the glass. Fluffy white head after a vigorous pour (the Duvel glass is awesome) stuck around awhile. Moderate lacing. Citrusy aroma was very mouth watering, perhaps this brews best quality. Taste was also citrusy/piney/hoppy with just enough malt to balance. Drinkability was pretty ok. Now I need a steak with the next one..."
"O: The way I scored this beer, the sum is greater than the individual parts. When you're not sure which side of the fence to fall off of, this is a great choice. Plenty of character, without being too eclectic or one-dimensional. Not sure I'd want to drink more than 2-of these back-to-back, but a nice interlude, for sure. I'll be buying more of this in the future."
"D: Drinks quite nicely but is by no means session able."
"Poured a clear deep gold, almost no head, can see some lacing and little stick. Pineapple and hops on the nose, floral and herbal notes as well. Taste has a bitter bite up front then mellows out, not a lot of sweetness here. mouthfeel is smooth, easy to drink. This is my first Firestone Walker beer, and I am impressed. Overall, this is a well-brewed IPA."
"A nice hybrid English/American ipa."
"A really good IPA, especially in the aroma department."
"Overall: I swapped my brother a cellared Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout for this one. I will say it was a wise choice. I would rate this in my top five IPA's. The 7.5% ABV is so well hidden. This is my first Firestone Walker beer and definitely won't be my last. I wish I could find it in a 1/6th keg on the east coast. For now, I will have to enjoy it by the bottle. I can't wait to try the the Double Jack."
"Overall: A really good ipa. My third offering from Firestone Walker and i haven't been disappointed yet."
"overall - this is an excellent IPA, not too much, just right!"
"Overall: This brew had an excellent, balanced mix of hops and malt. The hop flavor and aroma was still great after 2 months in the bottle (I'd really like to try this one fresh, though!) If only it were distributed here in Indiana, I would drink this regularly."
"O - I like this a bunch as well as Double Jack. This seems a tad lighter, but with a similar punch. Definitely worth a try for those liking beefy IPA's."
"Overall a very good IPA that I'm really glad to have in Colorado. A little expensive but definately worth getting again."
"o-I am so happy this brewery came to Colorado. I bought a bomber because I did not know how I would like their regular IPA, but I love it. To me it's right there with Odell, Avery, and other great IPA's. Cannot wait to try Double Jack."
"Notes: Reminds me a lot of Long Trail's Double IPA. Very very tasty, would love to have this be a regular item at my local shop. Would drink a ton of it."
"O: A nicely done West Coast style IPA. High in bitterness with big citrus and pine notes. Simple and to the point."
"I wouldn't say that this is a session-worthy ale, unless you don't plan on going anywhere, but for a few pints of something worthwhile, you could do FAR worse. This is an excellent example of the beauty of sampling and discovery, which is the ultimate ideal of any beer enthusiast."
"This is easily one of my top 3 IPA's. Might even be my favorite. The hops are absolutely amazing and provide one of the most refined fragrances and tastes in any class of beer, much less an IPA. If you're a hophead, this is a must have."
"A very nice American IPA with tons of true to style character that leaves the senses quite fulfilled."
"Overall, my first beer from Firestone Walker and it didn't disappoint. Nice IPA for the price point, bordering on a double. Well done."
"Overall a fantastic IPA. I am really enjoying it, it is one of the better IPAs I have had leaning on an IPA and a half"
"O: Nice surprise to find this at the price--almost makes up for the fact that I haven't been able to find any Russian River beers in AZ (I know, not distributed here)."
"O: An exceptional IPA. At 7.5% on par with many DIPA's. For the price ($4.99) a much better value for a very quality beer. A tad tastier than it's ""bigger brother", Double Jack. At $3 cheaper, definitely better! Get you one."
"Overall - Really impressive, great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Very drinkible and tasty, and alcohol is good at 7.5. One of the best ipa's you can drink. Search this one out."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is a wonderful example of fresh hop flavoring, very bright with hop characteristics in both flavor and aroma with a boundy of hop flavors without being brutally bitter. This is very easy drinking for more than 7% abv, it is nearly poundable. I fault this brew for being a little watery, but wow is it drinkable. It leaves an oily hop residue clinging inside the mouth that is very enjoyable long after a sip is taken. Fantastic stuff. For being more than a month old, this brew has such a remarkable fresh aspect that outdoes some other hoppy brews that I have had more fresh and don't taste this fresh. If you haven't had this, get out there and find it now."
"Overall, excellent IPA"
"O - Everything works well in this one. I'd definitely get it again."
"Bottled on June 6, 2011. Perfect copper orange in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a brief white head that quickly reduced to thin wisps of foam. Medium bodied and smooth with a light resinous, but delicate feel. Grapefruit and pine hop aromas are well balanced with sweet caramel maltiness. Citrus grapefruit hop flavor up front that quickly adds a fresh pine hop flavor that continues through to the finish. A sturdy sweet malty backbone throughout. A nice mix of hop and malt chracter."
"O: Understated excellence. This beer effortlessly succeeds in being a really nice IPA. Inordinately drinkable, and highly recommended. Will have again."
"A damned fine IPA, balanced, yet still intense."
"O: union jack is a very solid ipa that I could drink all day. I feel lucky to have found it on draft as I'm pretty sure bottles are not distributed here as of right now. I've heard (or rather, read) that some people say they prefer this to double jack. I wouldn't say that, as double jack is probably my absolute favorite dipa, but this is a very good beer nonetheless (as everything I've tried from firestone has been)."
"O- Love me some Firestone, I love me some IPAs Solid beer and my second favorite of the 3 pales."
"Pours a slightly hazy but clear light orange with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin cap. Nice rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of grapefruit juice, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit. Taste is of grapefruit juice and citrus zests with some tropical fruit flavors and a sweet malt taste coming in at the end. Mild hop bitterness on the palate quickly fades after each sip. Good carbonation makes for a crisp yet slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA with some very nice fruit smells and flavors. A good choice when you're in the mood for a ""fruity"" IPA."
"Overall: good but not great. Nothing is wrong with it but nothing stands out about it either. Worth a try if you're a Firestone Walker fan. Cheers!"
"D-Overall this beer was very good. It was a month or so old but still had the Hop bite and the flavors were all blanced well with out overpowering. Would like to try this one alittl fresher next time just to see how much better it would be. Def. pick this one up!"
"O- Im not sure how fresh this beer is or if its supposed to be like this but it was very malty and nutty/bready. Usually I dislike beers that are like this but this one was rather enjoyable. I’d prefer the hops to be more present but still was impressed. Solid IPA."
"o: great taste here and perfect in the heat. definitely fits the west coast profile and still brings uniqueness to the table."
"O: Overall , this is not a bad beer per say, but it is underwhelming and with so many awesome IPA's out there this will not be a go to for me. The batch is fresh, brewed in June, so freshness is not the issue here. I feel the beer needs a bit more grit and balls, it is too smoothed over without enough drama to the flavor. It's odd because Double Jack is one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting, so robust in hop aroma and flavor, and this just doesn't seem to come close on any level. Once again, not a horrible beer, but not even close to as good in flavor and taste as the Mission Street IPA they make for Trader Joe's! I think the APV is way too high for the flavor component here, the flavor is subtle, but with 7.5% you need a big flavor to distract the palette from the booze. When I drink this, I keep thinking of white grape juice and flat champagne..."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium bodied with extremely fine carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. I liked this beer a lot. Lots of tropical fruit flavors led to a complex, clean and refreshing IPA."
"Overall, not the best IPA I've ever had, but my growler will be empty shortly."
"O. It's a damn shame I can't get this one in Texas without trading or paying a hefty shipping charge. A very nice beer indeed."
"Damn I have to remember to Jack it more often! A really nice offering from FW and better than most IPA's out there these days IMO."
"Overall: Super drinkable. ABV is not evident. Perfect for a pint or two, after that it might get a bit repetitive... a wonderful American IPA, though. Among the best indeed, and better than Double Jack!"
"This beer seems pretty balanced. I generally like IPAs to be all about the hops. I prefer more citrus, mango, and pineapple in the hop profile. The astringent finish is kind of distracting. It's solid but, not my cup of tea"
"Very hop forward with a lot of sharp pine notes, slightly sweet and a nice bready malt finish. Feels very well balanced and the carbonation compliments the flavors very nicely. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall I'm impressed and would enjoy getting these in the future now that they're entering the NY market more readily. I'm impressed by it's mouthfeel and I like the balance with a sweet nose and taste. Now... Must find the Double Jack!"
"O: Pretty good offering but I'm a little letdown from all the FW hype I've been hearing living on the East Coast. Maybe my expectations got the better of me. I may have to edit my review sometime down the line after trying more FW beers."
"Pours a orangish copper color with a nice 1 and a half frothy white head which gives way to nice lace. The aroma has a nice caramel malt backbone bigger than most ipa's. There is then a hop aroma of piney hops and citrus hops. The nose is very well balanced almost a 50/50 split. The taste follows the nose, there is a piney hop bite to start with a nice citrus flavor over it, but in the middle you get hit with a great balance of malts. A nice sweet characteristic, a bready and caramel malt taste. Much sweeter and maltier than most ipa's, a little bit like a 120. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very good beer, this is a perfectly balanced beer, a beer I will be seeking out to find and have again."
"O - One of my favorite IPAs to have on tap. Clean, refreshing and bitter. Another great beer by Firestone."
"solid beer with a golden red hue and medium head. good thick sweet aroma, tasted thick and a little sweeter than a typical ipa. definitlely a full bodied beer with very good drinkability. Nice to drink on a 65 degree partly cloudy day. Overall despite being a little pricey, it was worth and will look for it again"
"Overall: I expected mroe from this beer. Not that it was bad, certainly enjoyable, but nothing out of this world"
"Drink- This was a welcome beer after not having it in so long. Very tasty, very crisp and a welcome reminder that its hard to make a good IPA."
"good ipa that i wouldnt hesitate to drink again."
"Overall these seems like a great beer - I would like to try one that is a bit more fresh."
"O: Dangerously drinkable. I've had a few sessions where I forgot this weighed in at 7.5%. My favorite representation of the west coast single IPA at the moment."
"Got a growler filled from the brewery last month and it was even better. The main drawback is that sixers of this are $11.99 down here in L.A."
"O- I was very impressed with this beer, mostly because it has a very different feel than most of the other West Coast IPAs I've had. I would love to be able to buy this instead of having to trade for it. Another great offering from Firestone Walker."
"Overall - This might be my favorite single IPA. Shame I can't get it regularly. Feels like a DIPA but nice and easy to drink."
"Poured a clear orange golden color with a small off white head. Light carbonation is buzzing around. Aroma is hoppy, citric, fruity and sweet. Taste hoppy and fresh with a slight earth must. Slightly perfumey. Feel is surprisingly creamy and slick. Very drinkable, light on the malt."
"One of my favorite IPA's. This is one of those beers that I take for granted since it's so accessible."
"Overall: I drank this beer alongside a very popular Double IPA from Santa Rosa CA and the Union Jack was a bit more impressive to me both in appearance and taste this time around!"
"O: This is a very nice and fairly balanced IPA; nice work from Firestone Walker"
"Very impressed with this one. I don't believe FW will be distributing this one in Philly because it's not part of the Proprietor's Reserve Series, which is shame because it's a fantastic IPA. Very refreshing and full of taste, but balanced enough for session drinking."
"On tap pint at the Yardhouse in Las Vegas. Clear copper color with persistent tan head that laced nicely on the way down. Delightful aroma of pine-grapefruit- floral that I could whiff all night. The taste is hops out the ass like chewing on grapefruit skin. Mouth is too bitter for me, surprising with the 7.5% ABV."
"O: Very good. Fragrant and light with all the citrus flavors a hophead could love. So drinkable."
"Drinkable, but stiff for the syle. I make it a borderline DIPA at 7.5 ABV. Not as drinkable as some higher ABV IPAs like Mojo, but not bad."
"O - an extremely tasty beer, right up there with the best of this style. Do yourself a favour if you spot this at your bottlo or local."
"Would really love to have this on draft. Wish I could find that in my market."
"Pours a small one finger head, most of the bubbles are big, so I doubt it will hang around long. The body is a cloudy dark orange-amber color, very little transparency in this beer at all. The head is now gone. The body looks good, but again with a Firestone beer, the head is not very impressive. Overall the body looks like a good IPA, the head, not so much. Huge hop smell up front on the nose, if I didn't know better I would think this is a double IPA, I guess it is close because it's 7.5%, but still. Very citrucy, very clean, nice malt note in there too. The smell is very good, it smells like a real hop hound! Damn, that's a legit IPA. On the first sip you just get punched in the mouth with flavor, very hoppy, significantly malty too though, pretty well balanced in fact, for an IPA. The alcohol is covered up pretty well, but you can still tell it's there. Overall the taste is pretty one dimensional, but it's a very big taste and isn't skimping out on anything! Drinkability is actually very high for it being 7.5%, and the mouthfeel is very good too, pretty thick, not too much carbonation. Now that I drink the beer more and more the alcohol an malt sweetness is coming out more, which is common among IPA's, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Overall a very legit IPA, for sure more flavor than their pale ale, and a good IPA to look to if you need to know how a good IPA is done."
"Final thought - Wish I had this everyday"
"OVERALL: Next time I will have to get multiples of these so I don't feel so bad when I roger most of the bottle. Sorry Doops. This was a real treat. The 7.5% puts it squarely in the IPA camp, but the flavor profile and body outdo some of the bigger DIPAs out there. Full of flavor with a big enough body to support the show. This is definitely at the top of its class and worth tracking down. Glad to have had the chance to give this one a go. Highly recommended."
"Overall, for me, I think this is a bit too malty for a standard IPA. Having said that...everything else about this beer is wonderful! I am a big fan of Firestone Walker and this is a great IPA to represent their ""stamp"" on the craft beer world."
"O: Solid beer from Firestone Walker - my first from them. Looking forward to splitting a bottle of the oatmeal stout with bamadog during our next tasting."
"Pours a goo den orange. Pretty dark for a single ipa. A pretty minimal amount of head especially for an ipa. Smells great! Tons of grapefruit and piney hops. A touch of sweetness from the malt backbone. Tastes sweet and very balanced. A very strong but mellow hop presence. Overall very solid!"
"D-Glad I got to try this, would definitely be in my rotation if I could get it in Ohio."
"This brew pours a very light see through copper hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind only some sporadic lacing,the smell is different and impressive it just smells like the perfect combination of sticky toffee malts and fruity resin coated piney hops,the mouthfeel is quite lightly bodied and well carbonated and its taste is very similar to the smell with hints of lychee,paw paw and bubblegum on first sip but as you let it settle on your palette caramel and toffee come through before being finished off with a nice hit of piney hop bitterness but to be honest its not a mouthpuckering big bitter hop bomb that i was expecting just perfectly balanced and if i hadnt looked at the label i would not of guessed its 7.5%ABV as it tastes less than that and if your not driving would make the perfect session beer."
"Taste is nicely juicy citrus, marmalade up front, yeastiness and bread with pine resin. Balance is great, it’s very engaging and lively and the abv is not apparent aside from presumably adding to the overall balance and body."
"O - Punchy IPA, but yet balanced. A top brew"
"Well after all the hub-bub about FW coming to PA with there tremendous lineup I was a bit let down. Not a bad beer by no means but it is forgettable and easily lost in the country of great IPAs."
"Union Jack is snappy, overall. A solid IPA, though I vastly prefer the imperialized version."
"This is bursting with flavor all around. It seems to hit every corner of the mouth. Mildly bitter but the flavor makes up for it. I love this IPA."
"Wow... this is a fantastic beer. Listed as an IPA I'd say the is a 1,5 IPA. One of the most wonderful balanced beers I have ever tried. So much going on yet so easy to drink. Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner."
"Amber brew with nice tan head, copious gorgeous lacing left with each sip. The aroma is perfect classic super hoppy IPA, citrus grapefruit pine scents coming in waves. The bitterness is forceful but not astringent or overwhelming, balanced nicely. An excellent IPA."
"O: Overall this is a nice IPA, better than most of the off the shelf varieties but there are definitely much better ones around locally on draft and in bottles from other regions."
"One of the better IPA's available, and relatively easy to find. This one really walks the line between a single and a double IPA. Considering that it really is a good value, especially on sale for $7.99 a 6-pack. Recommended..."
"I really don't understand why this beer doesn't have a bigger profile. Hopping is incredibly good and overall quality is on a scale unobtainable by most micros. A great beer and an excellent distraction from a Laker loss (WTF!!)."
"O - Overall, as one of the first craft offerings I tried while on my short business trip, I was left craving pint after pint of it. I could drink this stuff all night, and it's too bad I had to go to work the next day, otherwise I just might've."
"An outstanding and surprising IPA. Not knowing what to expect, I was floored by this beer's impressive bitterness. Underneath, there's plenty of citrus hop zest and a strong malt backbone. Quite delicious!"
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good well balanced IPA and a good one to seek out."
"Well done, and proud that this is part of our local brewing scene here."
"This one poured a hazy orange, dense cream coloured head, clumpy lace. Intense citrus aroma as soon as the cap came off, lots of sweet oranges initially, then grapefruit and caramel, a bit of earthy pine, no detectable alcohol. Bitterness was strong but not overpowering due to the malty caramel and bready character. Lots of citrusy hop flavour throughout, juicy grapefruit, with pine resin lingering. Slight alcohol flavour and warmth, plus a little spiciness, towards the end. Medium bodied with ample, creamy carbonation, sort of chewy, some dryness. I found this beer to be quite balanced - lots of hops but with plenty of malt to back it up. Easy drinking and quite tasty."
"I agree with the Brothers that this brew walks the line of a Double IPA. Firestone Walker Brewing, which took over SLO Brewery has put together a solid line-up, and the Union Jack stands as it's Flagship Beer to date. Bravo."
"when you see this beer. drink it."
"O - Really strong, huge grapefruit aroma and flavor but plenty of other flavors going on, not an overboard ""hop bomb""."
"I would love to get this on tap to compare. Once again I suspect the bottle to be a bit dated so I feel deprived from full olfactive sensation. I would try this again for sure."
"Finishing this review up I must let everyone know this is my favorite everyday IPA on the market. My pallet has changed over the years but this one is winning now. Highly recommended!!!"
"Drinkability - Quaffable for sure. I will be picking up some of these at the store once I know they are ""fresh"". A very good IPA and glad I gave it another shot."
"The floral scent punches you in the nose as soon as you complete the pour, which results in a pleasant amber color with a tiny little head. Normally I'd be disappointed but the lack of foam actually accentuates the pretty color, and there's great lacing. Tastes of citrus and grapefruit and the bitterness characteristic of the style, but balanced nicely by a nice infusion of beta acids. Medium body with average carbonation which works because any more would detract from the great flavor combination. I found it highly drinkable because of its balance compared to other interpretations of the style. Hopheads might object to the relative lack of aggressive hopping, but I for one loved the change in a world of increasingly powerful IPAs."
"single from WF, Arlington"
"D: Not session beer by all mean. On the strong side of IPA."
"D: This is a very good beer. It drinks like a DIPA and is close on the ABV. If you don't like hops, this is not for you as this has serious hop presence. My first Firestone Walker beer and it didn't disappoint."
"My first offering from Firestone Walker, I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. A great beer, one of the best AIPAs I've had."
" I can't stop sipping this beer, whoever decided that Firestone Walker should come to Alaska was a brilliant person. I wish I had tried their beers sooner, or had the opportunity to do so. What a brilliant beer and now I wish I had more then just this one bottle. GREAT STUFF!"
"D: Clean, smooth, and bursting with hop-forward flavor, this is one of a select few IPAs that exemplify the West Coast profile of sensory qualities. The obvious comparison is to Green Flash's West Coast IPA, although connections can also be drawn to Alesmith and even Stone IPA."
"Eh, it's no where near a drain pour, but probably one of the crappier IPAs that I've had. Velvet Merlin is the only thing I'd ever buy from Firestone again."
"D: I won't say this is a better beer than the Double Jack, but I will really like to drink this beer again many more times."
"Pours a golden color with a 1 finger white head. Smell is pretty cool, I am catching some citrus and great sweet fruit smell. This is one of the best smelling IPAs I've ever smelled. Starts with grapefruit hoppiness, and the finish obtains a little bit of malt. This is a really great exhibit of citrus hops. Mouthfeel good, could use a little more carbonation, but maybe it's just my bottle. Drinkability is really high. This is a great beer, only drawback is the 7.5 ABV."
"D: a great representation of an AIPA. big bold hop flavors but balanced with just the right amount of sweet malts. pick one up."
"It's not really fair to put an out of date IPA up against any beer so I'm going to forgo the Two-Schlitz scale for this review. This was a tasty brew but I'm sure it's much different when consumed fresh."
"Notes: Excellent beer and very drinkable while watching a game or hanging out with some buddies."
"This is one of my go-to IPAs. Availability plus deliciousness, keeps me coming back time after time. A staple in the diet of any hophead."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Medium orange color. Large white foamy head. Aroma is grapefruity and floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. A nicely balanced IPA. Slightly more fruity than bitter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Overall, decent IPA."
"Poured on-tap at the Yardhouse in Rancho Cucamonga, CA. The beer was served in a pint glass, and poured a light brown color, with orage highlights and no head. Sweet, hoppy aroma, with light orange essence. Middle and rear tongue hops flavors, balanced of bitter and smooth. Cedar and sweet characteristics, also. The beer has a steady flow of carbonation that keeps the beer light despite it's creamy body. Hoppy green aftertaste and smooth finish make it very easy to drink."
"In spades."
"Mouthfeel is very, very silky smooth, with carbonation not very present, but still enough. Drinkability is great too, alcohol being unnoticeable. Nice tropical IPA makes you want more the more you drink."
"Though this isn't my absolute favorite IPA, it's def. worth seeking out."
"This may have been a bad bottle, but it was disapointing"
"Drinkability is very good. I shared the bomber, could have drank it all myself."
"D: I absolutely loved this beer!! Not over bitter, with a good malt backbone. Pleasant all around!"
"Mouthfeel is a little fuller than I was anticipating but it is definitely not cloying or sticky like some breweries make their IPAs. Overall a very fine beer with plenty of hop complexity that is very drinkable. I think this beer gives Pliny a run for the money. Highly recommended."
"Union Jack is a solid IPA overall, and I'm glad I got to try it on-tap instead of in a bottle."
"A great, clean west coast IPA. Just really fantastic."
"This is one of the better IPAs I have had in a while."
"Drinks very well. I wish I could have this on a regular basis as a nightly sipper when I'm watching tv or hanging out with the old lady. True there are better IPA's out there but this one is definitely up there with the best of them."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very nice IPA. I really liked the more malt forward and sweeter notes it added to the bright hoppiness. Very nice beer overall."
"a wonderful ipa with a brisk quality but a distinct bitter orange marmalade malt quality that hides deep in the back ground. Pine and orange nose with nice balance. Intense hopped fresh taste from a fresh keg flavor. Nice white head with a clear golden color. An ipa that would be good fresh and a year old but not for those that expect a earthy resin like quality pine. Its a one dimensional in that aspect. Although very solid AIPA."
"Nice carbonation and medium body. Bitterness never clings, leading to a very drinkable IPA."
"I may have found my favorite IPA! This creation is just splendid. Sad that it took me a while to discover it, but now that I have, it'll be in my fridge early and often!"
"D - All the way from CA to CT this beer is still very fresh tasting. Wish this was readily available on the east coast. What a great beer."
"drinks pretty well. a bit strong for the style (which i dont mind) but the alcohol is integrated well."
"Another great beer from Firestone Walker. While I liked Union Jack, I thought Solace and Pale 31 were even better."
"This beer was fantastic. It was a bitter smelling regular IPA without the smack in the mouth afterward. it was very surprising. I do like the bitterness in most IPA's but I like the abundance of flowery and fruity flavors most. This had all the flavor and punch of a normal IPA but didnt have the big kick in the end. one of my new favorite IPA's for sure."
"Extremely balanced and very drinkable. Impressive IPA from Firestone Walker -- wish I hadn't waited so long to try this one!"
"Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, as there is no carbonation, with a medium body and light feel. Very easy to drink, this is an awesome beer. I loved this beer in the bottle and as a cask it was so ridiculously easy to drink that it was almost dangerous. A very high recommendation."
"I feel like all the Firestone Walker I have has a ""strange"" taste, not bad by any means just a taste I rarely pick up in other beers. This is a good IPA that is a little differnt from the norm."
"Very drinkable as I didn't find the 7.5% ABV to be noticeable. I was honestly surprised to see it was that strong after I'd consumed half the glass in a short amount of time. Definitely one I'll look forward to once FW arrives in Missouri."
"12 oz bottle pored an orange/amber color mostly clear with a 1 finger head that dissipated to a fresh white collar and some lacing.. smell was medium citrus and hops with a bread and malt smell..taste was the same nothing huge here hops abound but do not explode on this one ..citrus and pine notes are accompanied by some sweet malts and an alcohol presence..nothing dominates or overpowers this ipa..mouth feel is medium well carbonated..its just not the best of the west IMO..its very drinkable but i will buy other b4 this one"
"The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium with plentiful carbonation. The crispness keeps the cheeks pinched past the last swallow. That finish is long, dry, and bitter. So I keep'a quenchin'. A valiant effort from those who have the ""Passion for Pales""."
"D: A really great beer overall. The balance really is great. At $12 a six pack it is still reasonable though Flower Power is cheaper and fresher here. Really great IPA. Would love to have this on tap."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Wow, move over Sculpin, I think this might be my new favorite IPA. I need more of this ASAP!"
"Firestone Walker's Union Jack IPA is a beer that is not normally available here on the East Coast, but thanks to a trade, I was able to get to try this. This beer is a very bright amber color with a nice little coating of white foam. The aroma is strongly fruity with grapefruit and bready notes. The beer tastes solidly bitter with resin and candied citrus peel flavors from the hops. The bitterness is moderately acute, but is clean without a lingering aftertaste. There is good malt sweetness in the finish that balances the bitterness, but not so much as to be cloying and there is papaya in the finish. The IPA is full bodied and smooth. Very drinkable and easy to see how this beer has such a good reputation."
"D - Smooth - very drinkable - after a while a bit astringent and high alcohol content so probably wouldn't have too many in one setting. But great balance and really enjoyed it."
"Very tasty IPA, one that I would be happy to drink regularly. First Firstone beer I've seen, and based on it I'd be happy to see others around here."
"Pours a clean orange-ish yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, small citrus hop and a hint of pine. In the taste, pine hops in the front and citrus in the end, with a nice malt backing. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and hoppy aftertaste. Nice hop and great backing, quite nice."
"D: When I got to the bottom of the bottle, I was truly longing for more. This is a total wow beer in every sense of the word."
"Medium bodied, nice carbonation, smooth, easy to drink, and finishes dry. This is a very nice IPA. I recommend trying this beer, if you have not already done so."
"D - I wish I would have brought more home with me. A nice west coast IPA, and for the price may be one of the better values to be had. No problem drinking one bomber and I wish I had one more."
"Overall it is definitely a good IPA, though there are much better out there. I would definitely have this again."
"D- Love the pungent juicy bitter flavor that cascades into the dry finish. Always makes me want to drink more. Union Jack has a very high drinkability."
"Light bodied and snappy, does not drink near the 7.5% tag. With the lines so blurred between many IPA's and Doubles, this beer straddles the line with great success."
"D - I mean, it is quite nice, but it is not a standout. SoCal IPAs that are better (off the top of the dome...) include Just Outstanding, AleSmith IPA, Green Flash IPA, Sculpin (obviously), and I'm sure more that I don't know or can't think of."
"d-this is the beer equivalent of the girl you would like to f in the dark. when you can't see or smell it, it is awesome..."
"Drinkability is near perfect. I could easily have 2 or 3 bombers a night."
"The 7.5% is well hidden. This is VERY drinkable, dangerously so. The alcohol sneaks up on you."
"Drinkable enough. Not a great IPA, but a decent one. I wanted something more, but this is good enough in its way."
"D - A musky, lingering bitter aftertaste is the only thing from keeping this from being a perfect 5. Otherwise, this is absolutely easing drinking, all 7.5% alcohol is masked wonderfully and I wish I had another."
"I'm not saying anything new here, but it is a staple in my fridge and is always worth drinking. Even better on tap."
"Refreshing, drinks nice n' easy. Very clean & crisp, Hops out front with a great supporting cast of sweet citrus, fruit, malts. I'll buy again without hesitation. Put it in my top 5 for this style."
"D - Overall this is a good lots of hops IPA it has a good taste thats easy to drink I could drink a few of these in a sitting worth getting sometime"
"Golden with a tinge of amber. Clear with some carbonation. Good head retention. Aroma is floral, a departure from the typical West Coast, C-hop citrus smell. Front end has a bit of carbonation bite, floral hop middle subsiding to dull bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel."
"D: Very good IPA, solid easy drinker."
"Appears a deep bright copper, forms a billowing head off whitebeige coloredwith a dimpled biscuit appearance floating well above the rim of my Sam Smith's imperial pint glass. Aromatics offer up intense floral, citrus, earthy hops. Almost perfume like hop nose, this beer smells great, ample bready fruity kick from the balancing malts another beautiful well created West Coast hop bomb. Sugar coated hops the interplay between malt and hops is beautiful sharp bitterness citric rinds with orange marmalade coated toasted wheat bread. A bit of mild booze and more malts come out as it warms hints of caramel coated fruitiness comes apparent. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied beautiful welcoming hop burps billow out, carbonation is dead on perfect for the style slight resinous texture going on. Drinkability is incredible another excellent well made brew from Firestone Walker, another West Coast IPA. A shipment from Hi Times in Costa Mesa was a very much needed birthday present to myself."
"I made some stew tonight and threw a few jalapenos and other spices in there to give it a little kick, I must say that it's a great combo with the hoppiness of this brew. In general hoppy beers remind me a lot of plants, and although I know many people talk about pairing beer with meat, I think that this vegetarian stew has an awesome amount of plant-like flavor due to the amalgam of vegetables in it. The beer and it go extremely well together to say the least."
"Overall, I think this is an exceptional example of an American IPA. Quite assertive, it beautifully melds a strong honey biscuit backbone with the assertive hopping style of a West Coast American IPA. I only faulted the minor detail of a slightly metallic aroma. Otherwise, this is an excellent beer and I thank my friend Ryan for the treat."
"A bit watery on the mouthfeel with low carbonation. I just didnt enjoy this one that much. It looked good and smelled good but the taste and mouthfeel were not pleasing to me. DRinkablity was low but certainly wasnt anything gross. I wouldnt purchase this again."
"D: Overall, a good IPA. Maybe a bit on the sweet side, but the hops are still the focus and I wouldn't consider this a flaw."
"Pours a light copper with a lively head that sticks slightly. Aroma is hoppy and sweet, very citrusy and floral. The flavor is powerfully citrusy, with a perfumy character that lingers long in the mouth. The bitterness is strong and smooth. The mouthfeel is thick and clingy. Very tasty."
"D - Although it's a little sweeter than I prefer for the style, I certainly wouldn't refuse two or three."
"D-Um, yeah. It's good. Would be my go to IPA if it was available locally. Definitely a top tier IPA."
"D: An extremely drinkable beer."
"A very nice IPA that doesn't seem to generate a lot of talk around here. It was an impulse buy at Total Wine. We don't get a whole lot of FW's stuff around here and I'm not sure how long we've had Union Jack in Virginia, but I'm glad it's here now. I'd certainly get this again and I recommend it to all the IPA-lovers out there."
"I have wanted to try this for awhile,glad to get my hands on it.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear medium to full on golden with a thinner but well retained white head.Citric and pine in the nose,I mean just great hop definition,a bit of sweet alcohol as well.The mouthfeel is just a tad thin and prickly but it doesnt take away from the drinkibility really,just me nit picking really.Well balanced with big resiny and citric hop intertwining with a hefty sweet doughy malt base,yeah the hops win out but the malt base holds firm.A great Cali IPA the hops are huge but its not totally unbalanced."
"Overall, I wish this was something I could get on a regular basis. Great IPA!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangish into my pint glass. Very little head at all. Not nearly as much hop aroma as I would have expected, but I'm not dissapointed by the taste. lots of hop bitterness that is lightly offset by a very sweet malty backbone. incredibly drinkable without any real hint of booze. The balance makes this a great multi-purpose drinker and I wish that it was available in Ohio."
"D: Everything an IPA should be. Thumbs way up."
"Drinkability: Just fantastic. Its a little on the pricey side, at least here on the east coast, but at least its available. I'll be buying this one over and over."
"Drinkability is pretty good, it certainly satisfies my hop craving. On the other hand, so aggressive it's a bit of a palate buster, and one that would quickly lead to fatigue, of both the taste buds and the mind."
"Overall this is easy drinking and very tasty. Great beer, wish I was on the west coast to enjoy it often."
"Overall impression: Nothing to complain about here. Nice IPA, easy recommendation."
"I had a sixteen ounce pour of this at Rattle N Hum in Midtown Manhattan. I wasn't sure if I had had this before but was glad to try it either again or for the first time. Darker in color than a typical IPA with a little less carbonation that I had hope but otherwise I liked this beer a lot. Great Hop aroma and flavor. Good strong taste of malt as well. I liked it."
"D - Very high even with the higher ABV. Would be perfect with a 6.0%."
"D: it drank really good but didn't have the hop punch and hop profile that I expect from a west coast IPA; maybe it wasn't as fresh."
"D - Exceptional."
"Overall, this beer always leaves a good impression."
"D - A good IPA. Not spectacular but one that I would drink again."
"Poured to a glass. Light brown to orange color, a bit hazy, white head. Pretty typical IPA aromas, citrus and pine. Taste was pretty good up front, nice sweet, rich malt, but the finish really turned me off. There was a combination of flavors that didn't play well together on my palate...a combination of alcohol, the type of bittering hops and...maybe the oak?...just left me saying ""not lovin' this."" Difficult to finish the bottle."
"I tried this a long time ago (I think) and didn't care much for it...Let's try again...Pours a clear and vibrant amber, with a nice creamy head leaving sticky lace. Wonderful aromas rolling around here. Very piney hoppy, but it carries a sweetness with it that is very inviting. The flavor is extremely well -balanced - some of the best balance I've come across in an IPA in a while, particularly on the West Coast. Lots of fruity notes crammed in with the hops and malt really set this above the average for an IPA. Excellent ale and I highly recommend you track it down."
"drinkable ? oh yes."
"A tasty beer. Well balanced and deftly built. Almost an American ESB."
"Poured a hazy copper color, with some lacing. Smelled like pine and grapefruit, with hints of some sweetness. Tase was bitter up front, followed by nice bitterness all the way through, but mildly. Pine and citrus notes are very stron; this is a typical and classic west coast IPA, a very good one at that. Mouthfeel was good, and drinkability was good as well; great flavor and not overpowering in any way."
"D: As far as drinkability goes, this is a very good IPA , but tries to act like a Double IPA with the 7.5%abv, so be warned this is not the IPA of choice that you would want to be drinking all night long."
"Drinkability: Definitely more of a maltier IPA more in line with a British style- probably more drinkable en masse, but I would prefer a hoppier IPA.."
"Firestone Walker Brewing Company--Passion For The Pale--Union Jack IPA--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.50% ABV. 72 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) No sediment. Lacy off white dense medium head. Clear bright gold color. Aromatic floral hop front. Crisp rich dry sweet buttery hop resin pale caramel doughy body. Creamy hop spice balanced smooth end. Rich hoppy crisp malty IPA. Lagunitas Notes? Sampled 8/3/2010. 6-Pack @ $10.99."
"Overall, a really, nice solid IPA that I wish I could enjoy more often. Similar, in my opinion, in flavor profile to Southern Tier's Unearthly. Definitely a new favorite for me in the single IPA category."
"This dark-copper beer has a small head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is plenty hoppy, but it's pure American cascades--with the label I was expecting something a bit British. It's pleasant, though. Excellent flavor! It's bursting with hop flavor, while the bitterness never overwhelms. A nice soft, creamy malt layers underneath to provide excellent balance, leaving the finish not nearly as dry as one would expect, though the resiny, citrus flavor lasts a long time. Very good!"
"This is my first review. and I honestly hope it helps, as I absolutely love this beer."
"D: A very straight forward and delicious IPA. Great citrus hop flavor and bitterness thought out, and very balance and drinkable."
"Drinkability -- Overall, not a bad IPA. I've had better, but this is still solid. Would never turn one down."
"overall: a very enjoyable beer has a ton of hop complexity in there with a ton of hops used. I like this one a lot another winner from FireStone Walker!"
"22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottling date is 4/22/10 so we are definitely towards the end of this one's shelf life. A nice inch and a half of head forms and leaves impressive lacing as it dissipates. Nice, bright, golden yellow-orange color. The nose has tangy pineapple and citrus hop qualities and a healthy dose of malty sweetness to it. A bit sweeter than I prefer but still well balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied and medium-heavy. This is definitely a big beer. Pine and pineapple flavors tickle the tongue before a tidal wave of bitter hops rushes across the palate. Surprisingly lively hops for a relatively old bottle. Not very much carbonation but the hops are still crisp enough to overpower the majority of the malt with their resiny bitterness. Very drinkable for a beer that should probably be in the imperial/double class."
"Comments: My favorite part about it is the hop bitter aftertaste. Otherwise, I prefer my IPAs with more more carbonation (I did have a cold bottle) and greater hop flavor and aroma. If you have a sweet tooth and like IPAs, you might like this one."
"D- Very good IPA. This IPA is right up at the top, even at a higher ABV, the alcohol was masked pretty well. Very drinkable, if this were on shelves I'd keep it stocked!!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink; quite a hoppy brew, and with such smoothness this goes down extremely easily."
"I would for sure buy this one again."
"Pours a light red amber, excellent clarity. Thin head with a light pour. Aroma is hops all the way! Taste is a pure hop trip from start to finish, very bright and citrus like, smooth and subtle underlying breadiness and malts. This is a super selection for someone wanting a hops fix, a fine beer that I would have again when the hop bug bites."
"D: pretty good. This doesn't compare to the elite IPAs out there, but it's enjoyable and worth trying."
"Drinkability: drinkability is quite good. The hops keep it refreshing, although as I said this thing could be considered a double."
"I was SO happy when I got home after purchasing a sixer of Union Jack, that it was bottled only 4 days ago! That's awesome! This fresh IPA pours an almost clear amber/golden color with a big white head that diminishes quickly. Smell is very hoppy with some sweet citrus scents. A bit of a floral smell as well. Lots of orange. The taste is delicious! I could have told you this was bottled less than a week ago, even if I hadn't looked at the date (due to the fact that it tastes like the time I had it on tap at the brewery). Never has it ever come from the bottle better than it has tonight. The mouthfeel is just perfect for an IPA...sometimes you get an IPA that has too light of a mouthfeel, but this one is awesome. The drinkability is extremely high. Drank 4 of these last night along with some BMC (don't judge me, I was playing beer pong). I was sure to save one of these fresh ones to write a review on. Firestone has made me VERY happy after drinking this and trying Parabola. Awesome job FW!"
"TASTE: Immediate onslaught of bitter hobs and sharp carbonation. Despite continual bitterness, the flavor is surprisingly restrained. Some mellow fruit / apple character is present. There's more body than you'd typically expect with an IPA and it finishes with the lingering hoppy bitterness and also whiskey like sharpness."
"Overall/notes: A very well-made IPA. The tap was probably a bit too cold, which might explain why I found it so flat, but what can you do? Has enough balance that the hoppiness never takes over. My sister tried it, and she isn't exactly a hops-oriented person, but she found it quite drinkable. That alone makes me want to recommend to anyone for a try. If you're on the coast or have an opportunity to trade for it, take it. It won't disappoint!"
"D: One of the most drinkable IPAs around. Rivals Two Hearted Ale as the most drinkable IPA on-tap. Smooth, crisp, with exceptional body and feel."
"Juicy. you knew i'd say it here too, but it is. i can tell this is fresh as the brightness is great. tropical citrus with out some of the harsher bitterness. a great compliment of a caramel is noticable, probally because they went a reasonable distance with the hops, enough to kick you but yet keep a semi-balance going on. this is good stuff."
"Nicely drinkable. I think the thickness and the ABV slowed me down just a bit."
"Drinkability: For an american IPA, its just average. The abv is too high for me and i would just as soon pick this to be a DIPA. not a session beer and really should have the abv toned down a bit or else call it a dipa. only reason its getting this high a drinkabilty is because its delicious."
"A solid west coast IPA in my book."
"D - solid IPA, very well done if you are into piney and grassy hops. strong and assertive flavors but with a bit of balance. would go very well with some spicy Thai or Asian cuisine. well done here."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden. I would definitely have another of these."
"This is one top notch IPA with lots of hops and lots of balance in the finish . I hardly noticed the high ABV ( tastes like an IPA not a DIPA) as the beer was smooth and refined. The hops were west coast but not too piney . Like the DBA this is what FWB do best , a flavourful ale with lots of drinkability and complexity"
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Nice clear, orange-copper pour with a great fluffy off-white head and nice lacing. Huge floral nose with lots of fresh hops and caramel. The balance on this beer is incredible. Perfect mesh between bitter hops and sweet malts. Lots of citrusy grapefruit and sweet caramel with a perfect bitter hop tang. The mouthfeel is well balanced as well with a good mix of crisp dryness and a touch of chewy sweetness. Rediculously drinkable. This is another top notch beer from one of my favorite breweries. Never disappointed!"
"I am so glad that Union Jack has lived up to my personal expectations. I think that I focus slightly more on aroma with IPA/DIPAs and this beer delivers. The 7.5% ABV is in the upper range for the style but doesn't really hurt drinkability because the aroma and flavor are so damn good. Take you time and enjoy it. You'll get your hop fix."
"D-Very drinkable at 7.5% ABV. Alcohol content is not noticeable. A good IPA, but not remarkable. I would drink think this more if it were available in 12 oz. six packs."
"Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well-concealed. Very well-rounded IPA."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is one of the beers that I have tried from Firestone Walker. This is also, one of the better IPA's that I have tasted."
"D: One of the best regular IPAs out there and a stand-by of mine. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Mercurial and well-constructed; I see why it keeps winning medals."
"Glad this is available somewhat locally now, delicious IPA, exceptionally crafted beer overall! Get it!"
"After a very long hot weather bike ride, Union Jack IPA was a perfect relax-and-enjoy-the-world experience."
"Amazing beer. I haven't had one from Firestone yet that wasn't though, so no surprises there."
"D: Though categorized as a 'regular' American IPA, this toes a fine line toward being 'Imperial'. It's easy enough to drink one of, but midway through the second you may start to regret it. Or you'll feel so good you just don't care. Til tomorrow... Very worthy..."
"Not a bad experience at all, I must be getting used to all these hops I keep coming up against on my US road trip."
"Beer is medium bodied and slightly sweet up front from some malt. Lots of good pine hop character in the back of the palate and overall a highly drinkable beer. Its pretty good for an American IPA."
"D- For being less than fresh, I still find this beer to be really good. Really good balance and good MF. I think I will be trading for some of this fresh to see how it is."
"Medium-full body with a sticky hop finish. Damn, my bottle is empty already. Drinkability is alright by me."
"Overall:  Since I've been on a bit of a hop kick lately this beer hits the mark square in the face. Huge hop bitterness and gorilla hop flavor. While the malt is only supportive enough to hold the IBU's on your palate, for the hop seeker this will satisfy. For others, it will be unbalanced. Carbonation adds a tingling effect that only slightly lifts the hop oils off your tongue. The barley presence comes off as an afterthought to the Humulus Lupulus."
"The Union Jack IPA pours a bright golden orange with a very fluffy 2 finger head with great retention down the glass. Nose is west coast hop greatness. Lots of citrus and pines with the fantastic hop finish. Not much going on with aromas. Mouthfeel is much more malty than the nose. A great hop finish rounds out the sweet citrus and earthy notes up front. This is a much thicker IPA than most. Mouthfeel is chewy and full bodied. Drinkability is solid. This is one of my favorite IPA's especially with the drinkable ABV. Thanks again Flexabull, would love to get more of this in the future."
"Aggressive pour yielded a light amber with a smallish one-finger white head. Head dissapates quickly but leaves behind a nice creamy lacing. Good carbonation is evident by sight and taste. Nose is a strong citrus (orange, grapefruit) and earthy pine with a sweet malt evident. Taste starts with some bitterness that is almost like orange zest quickly countered by a malty sweetness and a nice, refreshing orange aftertaste. This is well balanced and delicious. It features a medium consistency and only slightly oily mouthfeel. At 7.5% and this well balanced, sessionable it is. As with lots of left coast offereings, I just wish I had enough access to do so. If you are lucky enough, go for it!"
"Impression: Enjoyed trying this hoppy and sweet brew, probably won't get again, too many better out there."
"D - A very enjoyable drink, but would probably only have one per sitting due to its sweetness."
"Medium bodied. Soft carbonation. Slick, oily texture. A little sweet and lacking in the flavor department, but an easy drinker nonetheless. Very underwhelming for a West Coast IPA, especially after I read comparisons to Two Hearted on the forum. Not even close."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice frothy off-white head that settled into a puffy cap. The aroma is of juicy hops, grapefruit with hints of tropical fruit. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. Big grapefruit hop profile but not too bitter, hints of pine and tropical fruit along with a bready caramel malt add some sweetness to the beer. Good hop profile, made well. Moderate feel with active carbonation; great balance. It is a bit heavy but the malt probably helps offset any harsh hop bitterness so I am good with it. Quite a tasty AIPA, great hop flavor without any crazy bitterness. It is a bit big with higher ABV but I will just have to live with that."
"D-this is a very good ipa with a nice balance with a strong hop profile and good bitter finish. only had a couple FW beers; but they are nice!"
"It tastes great. It's well balanced and, again, the hops shine through. Big pine notes with some pine and orange on the back of the tongue. Great flavors, I could drink this every night."
"I've been looking forward to this beer for awhile, and it didn't disappoint. There are definitely other West Coast IPAs which I like better, but this is a very good beer which I'd love to have access to on a semi-regular basis."
"Very tasty IPA, super drinkable. Hopped like a DIPA, right up my alley. Labels can be deceiving, I must've passed this one up several times due to the label not really grabbing me. Now I'll be on the lookout for it!"
"By far my favorite IPA so far. You darn west coasters are lucky to have access to this. I freakin go nuts over Firestone Walker!"
"d - A pretty nice IPA. Some nice citrusy hops in the smell and taste and a nice smooth mouthfeel to it. Would have again."
"Drinkability: All freaking day. This beer is great! Wonderful bitter and juicy citrus flavors make it very refreshing, and even though the body is just a tad heavier than many other IPAs, it's still not too heavy so it won't slow you down or make you feel bloated or anything. The ABV is a little higher at the 7.5% mark, but hey, I'd totally moderate and quaff these all day in the warm summer months."
"A great IPA from firestone walker, my first from them."
"Same in the taste. Its a big one. Everything is in order though. What you'd expect, citrus, pine/apple, good dough malt feel absorbing much, enough hint of alcohol to tell you to watch out and pace yourself. Thoroughly enjoyable, wish it was a little cheaper, don't find it too often for less than 8.99 a 6."
"Drinks very easily, but holds its own in heft. Great to sip and would have some more if they were around. Satisfying, though, and quite a tasty representation."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and somewhat oily with good carbonation."
"Feel/Drink: Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is as good as it gets. Looks like I need to hunt this down again."
"Very solid IPA, I would think this beer would garner more attention than it currently does, very good."
"D - Pretty easy drinking IPA that provides a lot of amazing flavor. If you want to stop and think about this one it has the depth but if you wanna just sit back, relax and enjoy your brew then it can fulfill that need too. I would pick this up again in a heartbeat. This is definitely one of the best single IPA's I've ever had."
"Drinkability: A very good and nicely blended IPA that has hops but is not a hop bomb. The alcohol is well hidden. I could have two or three. I wish this was available down here."
"D - Goes down very easy. I'm not usually a fan of IPA's but this has won me over. Overall, a complex beer and very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is dry in the finish with a nice lingering hop note. Up front it is light bodied, especially for such a big beer. Still, the low carbonation and fruity malt fullness makes this beer feel better than your average IPA. This was a good beer for a nice spring day, but the high ABV really brought the buzz. I would get this again."
"D - Pretty damn good, expected more malts for some reason. Around average drinkability, I could have 1-2 because of the high ABV, but I think I might buy this one again. Good, not a seeker but worth a try. Cheers!"
"I like the feel on this, its aggressive in flavor yet the it's not all that harsh on the tounge, mouth etc. Just a mild bitterness. A lighter side of medium with medium carb, moderate spritz. Insanely drinkable, insanely good, I wish fw made it to pa. In the range of the first batch of torpedo, with more dry hopping."
"D-its so very well done and as I just saw its 7.5 abv damn. No idea it was that big. I would love to be able to get this in my town I'd drink it all the time."
"Overall this was nice American IPA, with great flavor and balance. Firestone Walker must have a passion for the pale. Thanks again Esther! Recommended."
"I could see the hop bitterness becoming overwhelming after a few of these, but wonderful for a hop head. Very solidly crafted IPA. Pretty well balanced with a bias towards hop bitterness."
"Pours from the bottle a somewhat hazy orange color, with a collar of dense white foam. The nose is full of fresh hop aroma; tangerine, orange, grapefruit and pine. On the palate I get a bit of light malt flavor, but mostly huge citrus; more tangerine, grapefruit and orange. This is a great IPA. Beautifully balanced, quaffable, and easy to drink. Could drink this one all day."
"Overall, a solid ipa that is very drinkable. I think this compares a bit to sculpin with all the fruit flavors. I dig it."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness info offered. Pours clear lighter almond amber, dark eggshell head, fairly thin, but tightly knit and long lasting, leaving ample low sheeting and expansive lacing. Pungent hop juice nose, fruity and full of pineapple goodness. Hop saturated IPA, American in style all the way. More pineapple, resiny grapefruit notes as well, hop lovers rejoice...agressivly hopped and thoroughly deliciously crafted. A nice new addition to the neighborhood"
"Drinkability - I think this is one to have with a robust dish like some three alarm chili or some spicy barbecue. Much thanks to scribe594 for sending this my way."
"The 7.5% is surprising I would have thought it was lower. I would drink this again, even as a session beer."
"Overall, this is easily one of my top IPA's. I would gladly have this again, and am very thankful I got to try a very fresh bottle. Thanks Kevin!"
"Picked a few 12oz bottles of this up a few days back, poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Color is fantastic. A golden orange that has been filtered clear. Hoppiness is smelt from the get go, as can be expected from any IPA on today's market. The taste is quite hoppy as well; not as floral as some of the other IPAs or DIPAs out there right now, but extremely approachable for a brew that bills itself as ""aggressive."" Firestone Walker normally does a good job with their brews, and this is no exception. My only gripe is that the one dimesion-ality of many of today's IPAs is beginning to grow old. Complaints aside, definitely pick this one up if you get a chance."
"Glad I tried it, not sure if I would buy it often considering it was maybe 5 or 6 bucks for only 22oz and how many equally great IPAs are 8-12 bucks for a 6 pack (72oz)"
"D: Goes down easily, well balance, great representation of the style. I could definitely see this as a go to beer for me if they distributed out this way."
"D - Pretty easy drinker, not sure could session this one though as predominately piney beers tend to get somewhat hard to do after a while. Solid IPA I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"Overall, this was ok, nothing special."
"D: For 7.5% this is extremely drinkable and the lightness makes it go down super easy! Very nice, can see why it gets the accolades it does."
"Notes: Hmmm, I look forward to revisit this one. It was a single bottle and felt too good to let it go that easily. Nice surprise."
"F: Somewhat bitter and gets a little more bitter on the finish. Some pale bitterness and spicy hops. A little juicy hop flavor and some sweet juices lingering. Some malts stick with it too. The bitterness lingers for a long time. This is easily becoming one of my fav IPAs. I'm glad I got a 6-pack, and I'm thinking about putting this into my regular trading schedule. Thanks a ton Andrew."
"Cheers!"
"D: at 7.5% one bomber of this guy and you'll be set... for a while."
"Overall: Could have more a punch, but the novelty of the beer is it's ability to hit the mediocre extremely well. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"All in all, nothing was wrong with this one, and I loved it. Delicious."
"Orangey bubbly Caesar head. Hoppy for what I thought would be a British style IPA, after all the name. Very drinkable, and citrus flavour."
"If I ever win the lottery, I'm going to pay to bathe in it. It's become from favorite IPA. My reviews aren't scientific, I just know what I like. And I like this stuff. Good job Firestone, excellent."
"song: cold rain and snow - 6/14/91"
"D: Very drinkable sweetness with a bruising hop component make for a wonderful combination! I really like this beer."
"Pine sap, grapefruit zest, and minty herbal notes coat the back and sides of the tongue with a big bitterness that lingers on into the finish. Tropical fruit cocktail and breaded malt notes tries their best to balance, but the highlight here is all hops (as it should be). Body feels slightly thin and a bit 'empty' for an IPA, but a good carbonation level dries the back of the palate. Union Jack finishes crisp and clean, and I can easily see myself having a few more of these in one sitting. Sure, there are better IPA's out there, but Firestone Walker's version does a nice job."
"This beer hits everything I look for in an IPA, borderline DIPA."
"D - A very nice IPA. Something I'd drink often."
"Overall I wasn't expecting too much from this beer and was completely blown away by the it. I am not a huge fan of the FW beers, but this one is slowly bringing me back around for another round. This is definitely my go-to beer when all else fails!"
"Taste has a hard hit of piney bitterness. The malt flavor is pretty light. Slight caramel and bready flavors in the background. The finish is bitter, alcohol, grassy, astringent. It's a bit thinner than I'd like for an IPA. Carbonation is right. I'd like it more if it weren't for the astringent bitterness."
"Alcohol is well hidden."
"Mouthfeel is a medium-full with a light creamy quality to it."
"Drinkability: A well put together beer from Firestone Walker. A nice malt backbone and a nice amount of hops. This was exactly the beer I was looking for on a Friday night."
"I was very pleased with this one. Granted I can't tell an age on it, but I give it high marks for being so well balanced!"
"A slight chalkiness in the mouth feel which reduced drinkability. Nothing huge though."
"D- High. I like this beer. It has me scratching my head as to what Double Jack must be like, as this is more a DIPA than a single. If you like hops, do not hesitate, this is a wonderfully crafted beer."
"Overall a very tasty, hop driven west coast IPA."
"OVERALL Delicious, smooth easy drinking beer, especially for a big beer. My first FW, looking forward to more."
"Body and drinkability are average for the style. Overall, while this is a very enjoyable beer, I've now had a couple and look forward to more, it's just your basic California IPA. Very tasty, worth having several of, but does not stand away from the pack."
"As far as an IPA goes, which isn't my favorite style, this is pretty drinkable. I'd gladly drink it again, if given the chance."
"Golden amber with a bit of chill haze, finger and a half of white head, slow dissipation, big lacing. A bit of spicy hops in the nose balanced with bready malts. The taste is pretty hop bomb but not overly spicy, with sweet and bready malts providing a nice balance for IPAs of this ABV. Nicely carbonated and very smooth. One big mug is good. Nice interpretation of the style."
"Pours with a decent head fading into a light lace. Zero carbonation apparent. Displays aromas of fresh pine, citrus, and green herbs. Rich flavors of pine, fresh hops, ginger, and grapefruit. Nice texture, good balance with the alcohol in check. Overall a very good beer and one that does down nice and easily. Very fresh and bitter."
"Do not let the label fool you, though I love the fight poses between the British Lion and the California Bear. This is no Englsh IPA, but a full fledge West Coaster. And a damn good one as well."
"This beer is bordering Double IPA territory, which is not a bad thing, though it is a pretty sizable American IPA and is an absolute must for all of the hopheads out there."
"D - Choice drinkability. I could easily session with this one."
"D - A pretty drinkable IPA for a 7.5% beer. Alcohol isn't too apparent. Bitterness is a touch on the harsh side, otherwise the beer is a very smooth drinker. Pretty enjoyable, overall."
"Overall, a little sweet for the style, and lacking the intensity or clarity of superior versions. Not sure this improved on cask vs. the bottle..."
"D. At 7.5% abv you must be careful. I found myself drinking half the pint glass at a time. Its just that good. This is my favorite IPA in the world. This is my favorite beer in the world."
"Drinkability is damn dangerous. I couldn't believe that this was a 7.5 ABV beer. Its so good that Union Jack just replaced Torpedo as my IPA of choice!"
"D: Pretty darn good, as I took care of my bomber pretty quickly - but I frequently do that as I quickly take sips to do my tasting notes. One bomber is enough for an evening, however, I think."
"Excellent drinkability. While there is a heavy hop bite to this West Coast IPA, it doesn't have the oily cumulative affect of some of its peers. I'm glad I opted for a sixer."
"D: Like hops?"
"This is a beer that I could drink several of in one sitting, unlike some of the hoppier less-balanced versions of this style. This is a great beer."
"I'd been meaning to try this and after I heard it won best IPA at GABF, I figured it was time. I think it's a balanced and enjoyable IPA but I wouldn't put it in the top three."
"Poured a deep orange colr with a white head and good carbonation. Nose is big grapefruit, orange peel. Taste is chewy, acidic, caramel malt perhaps, orange peel, pine, sweet and a big hop bite on the end. Mouthfeel is acidic, tasty and sweet. Drinkability is good as usual."
"Very drinkable, complex and well-balanced IPA."
"D: Quite drinkable. A very nice IPA to quaff back all day."
"Thick and chewy mouthfeel, suits the beer very well. Quite drinkable. I'm very happy."
"D: Overall the taste carries the day. A nice lively IPA."
"Overall very pleased with this brew. Go get some."
"D- Overall a great brew that I wish I could pick up regularly."
"Drinkability: The only thing about that intense mouthfeel and taste is that it does drag down the drinkability just slightly, as I wouldn't want much more than a bomber of this, at the most. But still, a very, very tasty IPA that I'm a little surprised doesn't get a bit more buzz amongst hop lovers."
"22 oz bottle. Pretty pedestrian looking IPA. LIght orange/golden with a huge frothy off white head. Nice aromas of citrus,spruce and over ripe apricot. Nice fresh fruity IPA this one, very sweet, lemon rind, oranges, apricots and lychee. Mouth watering really.palate was on the thin side which added to drinkability in this muggy weather here in Salem. Overall a good drinkable IPA in the ""old style"" mould of Bridgeport IPA."
"D- A very nice IPA. Pairs well with food, but stands up very well on its own. Very well crafted."
"Drinkability - This is both big and quaffable at the same time. The balance is superb yet the hopheads will relish the flavors. This is a winner for sure."
"This stuff was super fresh, absolutely killer... the only other IPA that is better is the Yulesmith. Absolutely wonderful pine, grapefruit aromas, crisp, bright, and sublime... color of burnt orange amber, clear... taste was some apples, ruby red grapefruit, dry fruity yeast esters... head retention in my Riedel Bordeaux glass is superb... alcohol is hidden very well. It has been over a year since I last tasted this one... and I'm loving it. It's rare when a beer impresses me even more the 2nd time."
"taste is creamy, grapefruit, caramel, pine, and citrus, ends very bitter."
"Beer poured a crisp and clean copper with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is fresh piney hops. Taste initially was melon and pineapple somewhat balanced by a fair share of malts. Finish leaves resiny hops on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, brew is decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. Alcohol is well hidden. This is another very good FW brew. I look forward to trying more!"
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, had it at Firestone Grill in San Luis Obispo"
"This is my first ever Firestone Walker beer, and it was a treat. Again thanks goes out to Dave for this great extra I had been hoping to try."
"Appearance is a deep copper almost brown. Smell is a major burst of pine and hops. You dont even have to put the glass up to your face for this one. Smell suggests that this beer means business. Taste is a pretty tough with hops and definatly gets the taste buds jumping. Mouthful is almost harsh and begs to be swallowed. To me, the hops are way over powering and dominate from start to finish. I know alot of people suggest citrus and other hints but the piney/resiny malt seemed to overpower everything for me. Aftertaste lingers and almost leaves your throat dry. I am not much of a Hophead but if I were, this would be a daily drinker. Its still a awesone FW beer but not my favorite... too strong of a taste for me."
"D= I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and have come to the conclusion that it hurts me Firestone Walker is not distributed locally for me. Very tasty, very drinkable, and the ABV stays deceptively hidden. Highly recommended!"
"On tap at the Oregon Brewers Festival. Pours light copper with a faint wispy head. You get a whiff of floral hops, peach and some light caramel. The taste displays an underrated characteristic in the IPA universe: balance. Some citrus tang on the tip of the tongue along with a bit of pine blends seemlessly with the vanilla and peach sweetness from the malt. A second round of hop bitterness brings things to a satisfying conclusion. This is not a hop symphony, but it doesn't need to be. This is simply a very well executed IPA where more subtle flavors are allowed to create a coherent drinking experience. If this was available in Illinois it would join the ranks of my go-to IPAs."
"Had this one the other day with my father. Poured a gold color with white head that faded quickly and left good lacing. Smelled of citrus/pine hops and light malt. Tasted pretty much the same. Smooth, but slightly bitter/dry finish. Could easily drink more of this."
"D: not the most complicated hop profile ever, but still good and terribly drinkable and refreshing!"
"A real nice effort and I am glad to see them widely available now in our area."
"Served in a pint glass"
"One of my favorite IPAs. I buy it regularly at the house. Just as good on draft as well."
"The appearence is a bright cloudy orange color. There isn't much head but a slight halo around the rim and very little lacing. The nose is very citrusy. Some slight orange peel, and pineapple scents. Taste is just like the nose. Lots of big citrus notes up front along with piney hop resin. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slighty slick and oily from hop oils down the throat. Overall a very tasty IPA. It embodies the classic cali IPA flavors. Nice beer if you have it available."
"Drinkability - I could drink a million of these, and it's right up there with my most loved IPA's. This is only the second beer i've had from Firestone, and it won't be my last. Both have been phenomenal, so I plan on sampling everything else in their arsenal."
"medium body, maybe lighter than expected, but smooth enough, with resins in finish. tingly, moderate carbonation integrates the flavors."
"D--Nice IPA here that could be among the best if it had a little more body and stickiness. I enjoyed my bottle quickly and thoroughly"
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a crisp orange with a nice frothy head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is decent amount of citrus and pine hops with sweet malts. The taste is a nice abundant amount of sticky pine hops with traces of citrus balanced nicely with caramel malts. The beer is medium bodied with a nice dry bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip. This is a very enjoyable IPA, I'd love to see their beers available here in NC."
"Overall, a nice offering from Firestone. May have been a little to balanced for my liking."
"Drinkability: Still damn good. I'm sure I'll get this in a growler again and just be more careful of it. This Union Jack was tainted, yet it reminded me how beautiful that beer really is."
"Taste is very dry, this is quite a dry ipa - hops are hardly any fruit , and mainly just the bitter kick...a very good ipa"
"my appreciation has grown so much in such a short time for ipas...i need to go back and review some again, possibly the Sweetwater...it deserves a better score from me!"
"Well this f**king sucks to tell you the truth. I do not know how fresh the bottle is since the damn brewers like to put no date or make it a treasure hunt to find it and decode it. All in all I heard good things about this and I'm sure it would be good if it was fresher. But I have to call it like it is and speak the truth whether it be fresh or old."
"Drinkability: The thin mouthfeel helps it go down."
"Pours an oaky color with a nice beige head. Good lacing and retention. Nose has citrus, fruity hops and caramel malts. Taste not as impressive. Good malt structure, but the hops are a bit to mellow. Body is a bit thin, but well carbonated. Good IPA from Firestone."
"Pours pale amber with whispy white head that laces well throughout the pint. Nose is rather rich with some grapefruit and black tea aromas. On the palate, the orange and grapefruit dominates with some herbal qualities as well, and a modest malt component in there to reign in the hops. Some malty tea flavors are noted. Finish is ""juicy fruit"" sweet and leaves a long, pleasant aftertaste."
"D: I'll say. 'Nuf said."
"I like this. I'm not going to go out of my way to mail order it from CA again, but I'd surely take one as an extra any day!"
"Picked up a six-pack from Whole Foods Market in Los Gatos, CA and was glad it was recommended to me by Brian there. It has a clear golden amber color with a modest white head of big bubbles that disipates to a mere ring quickly but leaves a healthy carpet of lace. The aroma is mild but pleasant pine hops and a vague hint of clean grain. The flavor brings a much more difinitive hop and it's got more of a citrus side. It's smooth with very fine tingly carbonation, crisp but fair bodied for the style. The hop dominance gives way to some malt sweetness and this settles into a very pleasing ipa. There's also a touch toasted oats and oak. This is one solid choice, definitely give this a try!"
"Thanks again Solomon420."
"This beer has good taste and is easy to drink although it could have been stiffer and would have been even more drinkable."
"Really good mouthfeel, and very drinkable. One of the better beverages I have tried during this California visit."
"I think if this was my local IPA it would be my go to brew. easy to drink and it taste like a good IPA should"
"Edit from 1/12. This beer is now available in the Baltimore area, and as mentioned, is now my IPA whenever I see it on the menu in town. It's a beer I order automatically when ever I see it in town. Thank God we now get FW beers now here in Bawlmore."
"All around an excellent effort from Firestone Walker. I will certainly revisit this one."
"D: Totally drinkable. The way the malt helps soften the hoppiness, it really helps make this beer go down easy. Not the least bit of alcohol flavor either."
"drank on: 05.28.09"
"D- This was a very enjoyable IPA that I could drink again if someone was so nice enough to trade me a bottle."
"Notes: From what I understand, this is the same recipe as Green Flash West Coast IPA. But to me, Union Jack seems a little deeper and more pungeant. Don't ask me which one is better because they are both fantastic! This is one of the best IPA's out there, and the 7.5% ABV is hidden perfectly. Take notes Bud Light...this is what you call drinkability!"
"Drinkability= Drinkability is really high on this bad boy. Abv. isn't out of control so it can be a sessionable IPA. Availability is also high where I'm located which makes it all the better!"
"D - A good IPA and will hopefully get ahold of another bottle again."
"I swiftly poured halfway up my beer tasting wine glass. The head was white about medium sized and quickly disappeared while leaving nice lacing on the glass. The appearance was about in the middle for an IPA, copperish. The nose is heavy on grapefruit with a little honey and caramel. The taste is citrus and spice hops, a well balanced caramel malt, pretty basic for the style, well balanced taste. Mouthfeel is an appropriate medium body with solid effervescence. This could be a session beer as far as IPA goes, if you have read any of my other reviews, you know I always drink all over the map. All in all a very solid IPA from a region known more for great wine. Advice to Firestone, write up some tasting notes on the bottle, get some people in the Santa Barbara area to appreciate beer a little better!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid IPA that is well-worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Tap @ O'Briens. Poured clear copper-gold with a short white head. Moderate lacing. For a straight IPA, this was fantastic. Sometimes, you get the DIPA that calls itself an IPA, but this is jsut a well-done, big-hop single IPA. Crisp, fresh pink grapefruit, pine needles, orange peel, and mango in the nose. Sharp mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. No stickiness in the finish. The aroma follows through nicely in the taste. Grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, and that bite of resin. The caramel malt stays muted and does not turn this into a candied mess. Please sell more bottles of this in San Diego."
"D - Hops seem to dominate but yet it seems balanced at the same time if that makes sense. Very tasty and would be an excellent full flavored session beer if the alcohol didn't sneak up on you."
"Nice rich hop profile and medium bitterness for an IPA makes this fairly drinkable. 7.5 ABV is totally hidden on the taste and that number feels like an average ABV... Then it hits you toward the end and you start thinking of 7.5 as nearly 8%, whoa... Glass half-full or -empty, this is dangerously quaffable. $9.99 / six was a bit much at a boutique grocery store but $4 a pint at the firestone taproom indicates they price it reasonably. Good stuff, and as good an offering as was to be found from the full lineup at the brewery."
"Overall- Solid, sessionable. A highly recommended 1 if seen on tap."
"Flavor, as with the color, is lower on malt and higher on hops."
"12 ounce bottle thanks to psycohops. Poured into my shaker glass. Appears a clear honey amber color with about a finger of off white head. Light lacing is left on the inside of my glass with each sip. Smells fruity with notes of orange, lemon, cherry, pineapple. Tastes of caramel dipped pineapple, white grapefruit juice, honeydew, skunky (the good kind), dank, peppery with a slight alcoholic finish. Medium in both body and carbonation. A very drinkable IPA. Check it out if you see it."
"One of the better IPA's I've ever had. The only thing I didnt like was the appearance. It was somewhat amber but looked dark golden, clear. The thing that suprised me was there wasnt much of a head or retention or lacing. I had a 6 pack, the carbonation seemed fine, but just little head with virtually no retention. Smell is amazing. Touches of grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, and a floral hop bite. Taste is in-line with smell. A somewhat sweet citrusy taste with a plesant hop bitterness as it hits the back of the tounge. I'd have to say this is pretty well balance but, as you'd expect, somewhat favoring the hops. Mouthfeel is light and velvety, leaving a slightly oily finish. Overall a great beer, the ABV is incredibly well hidden, so while you may want to drink 4 or 5 of these, be careful!"
"Pours amber with an orange tinge and a brilliant white, frothy head that fades to a solid lace. Smell is citrusy hops with lots of grapefuit and some sticky pine. Taste is very hoppy but more malt backing than the smell led me to expect, still very hoppy though. Taste is immediately a caramel malt that quickly gives way to a building bitterness. Hops are peppery up front with a lingering pine aftertaste. This is a well balanced ipa, very drinkable."
"Light orange color in the class, no haze at all and very few bubbles, with a quickly dissipating head. The smell is sweet and strong with piney hops. The mouthfeel is sticky and almost perfect--just a tad lighter than some other big IPAs that I love (e.g., Ruination). The taste is true to style with plenty of hoppy goodness. There is also a nicely sweet finish, sweeter maybe than any IPA I've had before--not quite what I'd call sugary, but close. All in all, this beer goes exceptionally well with the Mexican food I brought home."
"The first thing I notice is orange and lemon, followed by some light simcoe hop kick which is giving some pretty decent grapefruit tastes. Really great malt backbone provides a nice full bodied mouthfeel. Very nice dry hops to finish."
"Thankyou to harvester to sending me a six pack of this stuff. Pour reveals a hazy golden colored beer, with about half a finger of white head. Big ripe nose of grapefruit, grassy notes, touch of alcohol, and a resin hop presence. Taste melds all of the above smells together, leaning towards the hop bitterness, grapefruit flavors, and mild alcohol bite. Body is between medium and heavy, leaning more toward the former. Alcohol is not overly present, just enough to peak its head up. This is a well made IPA. It reminds me of Mojo IPA from Boulder in a big way, maybe a little bit better. Certainly something I would have in my fridge often if it were available here. Cheers"
"D- This is a pretty good IPA and I wouldn't mind trying it again. The high carbonation detracts from it a bit-but maybe there is a way around that-because otherwise this is a great brew."
"** Edited... after finishing the bomber, I am a bit more impressed... Very good drinkablilty!"
"Drinkability: Goes down surprisingly easy (and quickly) for being a 7.5% ABV. A solid, competent India Pale Ale."
"From a twelve ounce brown bottle - Pours a light copper color with no haze and a small head and almost no carbonation. Smells only of west coast c-hops, with grapefruit dominating the nose. First sip is bittersweet just like a good IPA should be. Tangy but with more than enough malt backbone to support the massive hops. Great for the style."
"Drinkability: More than just an AIPA, this is close to a DIPA; designed for those who want a low alcohol DIPA (although it tastes bigger), and that is worth a little chuckle"
"Good well balanced IPA, worth a try."
"A must try for those inclined to the English of the India Company style. Extremely well balanced and rather sweet with grapefruitiness. I mention grapefruit a lot because that is what best describes the sweet and sour puckering."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. Looks nice, fairly clear honey color with a nice off white crown, and sticky, sticky, sticky. Smells great. Like a light DIPA - it's nice and pungent, with some good sweetness. The taste is full with delicious C hops with a nice tropical profile supported by some lightly toasted caramel maltiness. The mouthfeel is right for an IPA, but with the DIPA flavors, it's a nice change and feels light. Very smooth, very creamy. This is good stuff. I might not trade for it, but next time I'm out in California, I'll bring a sixer back with me. Actually, maybe I will trade for it...it's damn good!"
"Taste is bitter (72 IBUs) piney grapefruit orange hops with a solid malt backbone. The bitterness is relentless on the back of my tongue. Carbonation is just right and the finish is dry and bitter sweet. This is a powerful IPA. It would be interesting to put this up against some Blind Pig. If you love bitter hoppy IPAs you owe it to yourself to drink this beer. I am just about finished with the bottle and still have a nice ring of head."
"Medium body with some quench...nicely balanced right down to the finish. The alcohol stay back, out of the way, but definitely creeps up near the end. This is a very solid IPA and exceeded my expectations, try it."
"overall, a GREAT west coast IPA. a little more bold than some and the carbonation adding to the hop bitterness. i expected a certain caliber from firestone and i was not let down. i got this in a trade as an extra and my mind has been blown, huge thanks!"
"This is a very floral beer in the nose. Hops are reserved and very balanced. Taste is much the same. With some citrusy hops coming through after the florals hit you first. Clean, crisp and thin on the mouthfeel. This is a crazy easy sessionable beer. This would work well on a home tap. Decent stuff."
"This is a very good IPA, very drinkable and dominated by citrus. The bottle went way too quickly and is a good representation of a west coast IPA. Nice."
"Another great IPA that is readily accessible. $10 per six limits how often I purchase this beer."
"Very good brew."
"D- this beer drinks well, especially for a 7.5% ipa. however, i dont know how much more of this i will be buying (on the other hand, it was only 4.99 for the 6er!)."
"Matt Brynidlson is a master brewer. I know he's good friends with Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River, and it shows in his ability to make an IPA. Matt started off studying hops in the lab, and later became a brewer. He knows how a West Coast IPA should taste and smell. This is one of the best IPA's you'll find on the West Coast. Much respect to the Firestone Walker crew for pushing the envelope of craft brewing in America."
"After drinking many 'Pliny the Younger's over the past few days I would say this is on par, maybe slightly behind. A fantastically well-balanced IPA that has a very fresh hop aroma and taste. There is a bit of bitterness on the tail end but overall a great beer, with a good malty balance to it. I definitely plan on picking up more of this for the beer closet stock."
"After visiting many Brewpubs I would have to add that this is the typical great tasting IPA that usually is the preferred out of a sampler from a mom and pop Brewpub only with 7.5... If I could give this my own classification I would put this in the Amercan Brewpub IPA catagory."
"Drinkability of this beer is very good. At 7.5% alcohol this is a fairly potent brew. I wouldn't want to drink too many. I could and would like one more though. Man this is one fine beer - thanks again Brian!"
"11/13/08 etched into neck of bottle. Poured into my lovely SA beer drinking glass. Opaque bright yellow with a clean looking whitish head. Tropical whiffs of tangerine, kiwi, mango. Bitter and tangy hop flavor noticed on the first sip. Fairly dry in the mouthfeel, lingering dryness on the palate. A strange flavor of tropical hop flavor and chalky hop bitterness. Certainly not bad by any means, just not I would again seek out among all the great IPAs from California."
"Extremely drinkable. Too bad we don't get FSW beers here!"
"Matt and the boys over at FW are gonna take over the world someday. The 'Passion for the Pale' really shows with this one ."
"I give props to Firestone for not making just another hop bomber, but actually trying to create a bit of balance and subtlety with this brew. Great stuff!"
"Probably my third favorite ipa behind alesmith and stone."
"This beer pours a very clear amber with a 1/2 finger white head with some lacing. The smell is nice and big mostly dominated by a grapefruit smell from the hops. This beer has a very nice malt base to it and a nice hop profile, its not gonna wow your socks off but it is a very solid well constructed beer. The initial flavor is a kinda bready malt flavor and its immediately followed by the citrusy hop flavor. The carbonation level seems a tad low on this beer and there is a slight dry after taste. An easy drinking beer, the alcohol is well disguised I would imagine this to be a session beer but its not even close :)"
"Pairs very well with Hebrew National All Beef Hotdogs...with coarse stone ground mustard."
"D: This is a top-notch IPA well hopped and high on the alcohol. The fact that I can usually find sixers for around seven bucks makes this beer a winner. Great job Firestone!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and rather oily. Relatively easy drinking and an excellent example of a hoppy American IPA."
"Floral and piney hops dominate over a sugary bisciuty malt. Body is light and fluffy but with substance. Really, really, really clean."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D: A very nice and smooth IPA that I could easily session. Decently big beer at 7.5 ABV, but doesn't seem ""big"" at all. Very easy drinking and subdued malts/hops. Great in that respect, but at such a big ABV and at a $10/sixer price tag there are some more attractive IPAs out there (Green Flash, Stone come to mind)."
"Orange/copper color with a white head that retains well and leaves good lacing on the glass. Grapefruit, pine, biscuit, caramel and an astringent grassy-ness in the aroma. Taste is bitter with pine, grapefruit, light lemon citrus, and a bit of lightly toasted biscuits providing a bit of a malt background. Less than medium body, dry finish, and medium carbonation. A nice, drinkable IPA that I'd enjoy from time to time. Maybe future bottles will have a better aroma, but the taste and mouthfeel was good at least. Thanks to doubleo for the bottle."
"D - In terms of ease of drinking the beer is definitely drinkable. The taste is somewhat one-dimensional for an IPA. A beer I would not mind bringing to a party and drinking a sixer of. But not a beer that I would savor and look forward to drinking."
"I like to call these ""pizza beers"". They serve a purpose but would not be an IPA I would buy regularly with many better alternatives available. Glad I had a chance to try it and worth a shot."
"Wow! Talk about an underrated IPA! This was great stuff that I'm just not seeing enough talk about. Maybe if it had better distribution compared to some of Firestone Walker's other staple offerings? Anyway, I mightily enjoyed this and look forward to future bottles."
"D - This is a damn fine beer, but at 7.5% it works as fast as it goes down. That being said, I could still drink a ton of this stuff."
"Even mouthfeel, just a tad slick with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable and warming, great selection from barleywinefiend. Thanks!"
"D - This IPA has a lot of West Coast in it, especially the big citrusy flavor. I wouldn't rank it with the big boys like Pliny or Dorado, but it's solid and sure to please the hopheads."
"Very smooth and mildly carbonated. This is very juicy and rich."
"D-Excellent, bargain priced, high quality, west coast IPA. This one is tough to beat for the cost. Glad I have another one of these waiting for enjoying."
"Edit....Had on tap again in May '09 and must restate that the draft is a better, and dare I say, a different beer. I'll take the draft."
"I wouldn't say this is a sessionable beer because at 7.5% abv, it might takes it toll on you if you choose to pound these away all night. It's a little heavy on the palate and the hoppy characteristics made it difficult for me to have more than just one. I would prefer their Double Barrel ale to this anyday."
"Another fine offering from Firestone. This one reminded me of their pale ale, but with a hoppier presence. Nicely done."
"This is an excellent IPA, just a notch below a DIPA. The beer looks quite good, a nice bright caramel with a sticky white head. The nose is ctiric and spciy with hops. From the moment, that this beer gets near your nose, you know that hops are going to be the main attraction here. The taste adds some nice hop pine flavors and malty sweetness. This beer has an excellent feel as a big and excellent IPA. It's thick and resinous. The carbonation is prickly and melds well with the sharply bitter hop notes. It's a fairly drinkable IPA, more for maintaining my interest than for my desire to drink a dozen of them."
"D_A well made IPA."
"Highly drinkable and worth a try!"
"D-The back harshness drops this from a 4.5 to a 4 but overall very nice and I would drink another one."
"This is a nice beer. One of the handful of IPAs I've tried that are clean, crips, without any of the fancy footwork that have come to accompany some of this class. Drinkability is off the charts; I'll finish this one in about half the time it typically takes me to down a brew. The beer is very nicely balanced &, were this in my area, I could easily see it becoming a staple both for myself & my ""non-craft"" friends who would appreciate its approachability."
"Pours a beautiful shade of orange with a small, sticky white head that notches down the entire glass. This beers absolutely screams quality. Crisp, fresh, clean hop aromas and flavors, peppery spice, bright citrus grassy-ness and a subtle note of carrot as well. Very well balance by a solid malty backbone. No alcohol burn but dangerously drinkable for 7.5%. Dare i say even sessionable? I highly recommend this beer to any IPA fan/hophead, or just someone in search of a beer that will wow them in appearance and just overall quality."
"Very nicely balanced, the citrus and tropical fruit linger on the palate alongside with hints of caramel and I beg for more!"
"The body of this beer almost glows as light shoots through it making it a orange with honey tone. Head is off white and stands at an inch and a half but fades fast leaving a bit of lace. Nose has a consistant hop based feel with some citrus and woodsy feel. Enters the mouth with crisp big citrus blast. Hops are bursting with juicy orange rind and grapefruit pulp tones. Malt gives some balance but still leaves the hops on the forfront. Mouthfeel is bathed in crisp lushious hops, oh so juicy. This is a very drinkable beer, and quite refreshing. 7.5% hides well. A real sleeper of an IPA."
"D: I've been neglecting this review because I've been enjoying just sipping on this nice brew. It's simple, nothing blows you away but I want to keep going back for more."
"Thanks to the wolfman for the extra treat.."
"D - Good, but there is little balance in the beer and could age a little longer."
"The alcohol is very well hidden, with just a touch of a soft kick appropriate for the body. Dangerously drinkable, it is well-balanced while showcasing Pacific NW hops. Disappears way too quickly for a 7.5%'er! Great stuff - Thanks again John!"
"D - quaffed quite nicely over dinner. Not so over the top to be distracting, nice enough to be complimentary and easy to have a couple of."
"D: Even at 7.5%, I could pound this beer all day long. Another great ale from Firestone Walker."
"D. Very drinkable. this is a fine IPA i will be getting again perhaps a staple along side Stone IPA"
"Pours a golden pale amber color with a big foamy white head that resists fading, a bunch of lacing in it's wake. The smell is aggressive and intensely floral and piny. The mouth feel follows, medium bodied with a hugely tangy piny hop character. Full flavored, the piny west coast hop is the main player and the hop lingers really well. The 7.5% ABV is well hidden, but this is by far a hugely sturdy IPA that is seriously ""bringing it"". Highly recommended."
"A solid, solid American pale, well above average and well crafted as most everything is at Firestone. A classic name, but also a classic brew."
"D: I enjoyed this very much. Great IPA and very drinkable."
"12oz bottle purchased at Pizza Port Bottle Shop in Carlsbad, CA on Friday, September 19, 2008. Consumed on Saturday, September 20, 2008."
"Pours a clear, bright coppery orange, one-finger white head fades relatively quickly, leaves behind patchy lacing. Smell is citrus-heavy, lots of juicy bitter grapefruit, tangerine, and a sweet caramel backdrop. Lot more pine flavor than you'd expect from the nose, big grapefruit flavor, soft tangerine notes....this just screams ""IPA"". Slightly sticky mouthfeel, nice lingering bitterness, nothing overpowering. This is just a very classically done American IPA, and if I were a left-coaster, I'd be drinking lots of this. Really tasty."
"D: A great IPA (possibly nearing the DIPA boundary). One of the best readily available IPA's out there."
"Hazy bright golden. Nice 3-D stick and creamy lace that lasts all the way down. Robust oily hop aromas of fresh pine needles and citursy orange peel. Nice array of pine and citus hops coats the tongue with some nice slick malts that follow thru. Nice ample bitterness lingers, leaving some nice sweet malt flavors in it's wake. The drinkability is fantastic, 7.5% did you say? Danger, Danger Will Rogers. A hoplovers dream for sure, but this shows a nice bit of balence."
"Pours with a thin head. Amber in color. Big pine hops smell. Taste is mostly the pine plus citrus hop flavor. A bit bitter like a good IPA should be IMO but the mouthfeel is smooth. A quality West Coast IPA."
"D: Very tasty, alcohol is hidden very well, taste is very fresh and balanced and rather refreshing for an IPA. Very good."
"I was disappointed with double barrel ale, so I was a little reluctant to try another beer from Firestone Walker. But, this beer proved me wrong. A good American India Pale Ale."
"A very nice brew. Great with a plate of buffalo wings. This one is a should try if you like the style. Worth trying to taste if it's not in your area."
"Pours a clear copper with a minimal head and thin, stringy lacing. Citrus and pine on the nose, backed by caramel and some toasty breadyness. Hops hit first (as they should), with tangerine, lemon, and pine, followed suit by the caramel and bread from the malts. Very well balanced, a nice hop profile that doesn't overwhelm the palate. Finishes a bit dry for my taste, but drinkability is high. Damn tasty; this one will definitely be added to my regular rotation."
"The immediate grapefruit and pineapple fruit flavors leave few doubts about the American origin of this brew, but the spicy finish gives a nod to the British past of the style. The malts are fairly light with just a hint of dry biscuit barley under the citrus. The appearance is a deep gold-orange with a tall white head a thick lacing. The body is also as light as any pale ale, making this almost too drinkable for the 7.5% strength. Overall this IPA is rich in flavor with strong bitterness, while still maintaining drinkability. I'd say this is the best IPA I've had in some time. It doesn't hit you over the head with hops yet is complex and interesting."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, a good AIPA that verges on the edge of greatness"
"Union Jack's a hell of a nice IPA. These west coast guys really know how to nail IPAs. Too bad Firestone isn't distributed in Ohio anymore. This would be a staple in my fridge if it were. Too damn bad...."
"Extremely drinkable in my book. One that leaves you wanting for more. Glad I did have 2 in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Great balance in this one, truly. Has plenty of bitterness but plenty of great sweetness and some fine hop notes to even everything out. A great overall beer, and highly recommended."
"This damn well should be your flagship beer. There is a ton of good competition in this style category, especially from that part of the country, but Firestone's Union Jack is certainly among the top on my list of delicious, endlessly drinkable IPA's. Thanks fartingdog!"
"drinkability is great. great balance. nice malt and hop depth. a good example of the style."
"Overall, this beer was a bit of a disappointment. I expected more of everything (i.e. aroma, body and flavor) from this West Coast IPA. Maybe this is a hoppier version of a British IPA (as the label implies) versus a more typical example of an American IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazed orange, white white head forms, drops a ton of lace, solid ring. Smell is great, floral, grapefruit, oranges, caramel, bread, perfumy, lots of citrus goodness, very well rounded. Taste is even better, caramel, cake, sugar, jasmine, orange and tangerine, bit of yeast, some fruit, floral, nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Very enjoyable, nice tight flavours, very balanced, definitely a good one. Thanks Dave!"
"D- Very well balanced, could drink this all day long."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard goblet. This beer pours a clean and clear honey brown with a sticky, white head that left lacing down the sides of the glass. This is a really pretty beer. The aroma is west coast hops with just a bit of citrus coming out, some spiciness and just a bit of pine. Also just a bit of grass. The taste is awesome. It's really a perfect balance of hops and the malt backbone. The hop bite is right up front with big piney hops and a slight kiss of orange. The sweet malt comes out at the very finish of the beer. This is really good. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, while having enough body to hold such a big taste. This is my first experience with Firestone and it makes me understand why this brewery gets such respect from Beer Geeks."
"Pours a clear golden amber with 2+ fingers of frothy off-white head. Great retention and good sticky lacing. Smells of citrus, bread, caramel, and spicy hops and pine. Taste starts off with a nice refreshing citrus flavor of grapefruit and orange rind followed by a good caramel and bread backbone with a touch of peppercorn. Finish is lightly of spruce pine and floral hops. Medium in body but a little watery in the back end. Good carbonation. Smooth and citrusy with a solid malt flavor and a bit of bitterness in the finish. A very solid IPA that packs in lots of hop flavors but isn't as bitter as some others. The alcohol is well hidden and the flavors leave the beer quite irresistible."
"This one poured a nice clean golden color with little head that disappeared quickly. The nose is very hoppy on this one like any good IPA. The taste is citrus with some piny taste to it. A bit of a hot alcohol taste but very drinkable for an IPA. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkabilty> so-so. I'd drink it again if someone handed me one, but I'd probably go for a different one if I was in the beer store."
"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of thick, foamy, ecru head with good retention. Nose had a very citrus-hop smell. Color was a medium-amber/light-gold. Mouthfeel had a slight graininess to it, like it might have been overly dry hopped and saturated as a result. The taste was very hoppy, grapefruit-like in its citrus/dry way. The finish was extremely dry and satisfying. I had purchased a six-pack of this beer while in Oxnard, CA and I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of them."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear, dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, some islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is pretty hoppy, with some malts thrown in, citrus, and some pines. The taste is hoppy, with some nice maltyness, with some citrus and pines. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty IPA, a classic in the making."
"Pours a clear amber with a creme head that falls quickly. Nose is a nice floral citrus mix. Real airy, but with good character. Flavor is nice. Great hop mix. Citrus and sweet (almost a bit too much on the backside) are consistent as is a nice mellow floral flavor. It's balanced, even though there is a full flavor. A bit of a hot touch from the alcohol, but it's minimal and doesn't matter much by the time you've processed everything. Feel has a slight bite on the carbonation and the liquid is good. Easy to drink and a nice IPA. Comes off as slightly more refined as other IPAs that try to muscle their way to the top."
"This was a nice surprise, because when I moved the sausage and butter bin on the top shelf, this mystery bottle was in the back. This was somebody's leftover from the 4th! Gotta love summer months!"
"this one is nice, a beautiful amount of hops, it is bitter from begining to end and the after taste laeves you wanting more, this one is a orangeing yellow color (lighter than i usaly like) that pours with little to no head, it is purfictly carbonated and at 7.5 abv it is no joke, try this one it is good"
"Mouthfeel was zesty, medium bodied, and way too drinkable. Yum."
"I bought a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse in LA. The beer was very clear, orange color, just enough foam and a lot of sticky lace. The aroma is so good, more American than English (and based on the name I think I expected a more English version), lots of American west-coast style hops aroma in this. Citrusy, delicious, and it came through in the flavor also. Medium body keeps it drinkable, although it's no slouch at 7.5%."
"D - Would like to try this one on tap. Was lighter, or maybe not as malty, as many IPAs I've had. Normally dont session IPAs due to lingering bitterness, so my D takes this into acct. Extremely tasty IPA."
"This is a good looking amber colore beer mixed with reddish and orange hues, and as a bonus leaves good lacing in the glass. Aroma is mildly hoppy. As for the taste, if you guessed hopy, you're correct. It's big upfront and piney, it softens up into tidbits of caramel and bread. Surprisingly refreshing and easy drinking."
"I gotta give it to FW. Don't just love Double Barrel, but the IPA and pale ale are awesome."
"Overall this is an extremely drinkable IPA. Excellent hop aroma and flavor, great variety. Nicely paired with the clean sweetness. Easily a multi-pint beer."
"D - Not what I had hoped it would be. Would only try another another bottle to re-review it."
"This is one of those beers that you'll need to track down. I'm wishin' I had a case of this."
"D: This is an easy drinkin IPA. It is rather mild"
"Thanks goes to Zorro for a couple of these via Brews N Tunes Volume 3..."
"The color was of a medium deep golden yellow with a reddish hue with medium amount of foam and lace. The smell of sweet/tart hops filled the nose with a pleasant soft aroma, with a hint of fruit. The taste had a pleasant sweet bitterness with a fruity aftertaste of watermellon and pineapple. Very nice American IPA. I usually don't care for IPA's, but for this one I have to make an exception."
"I wish I could ahve this fresh, I'm sure qualities would stand up a little more. Either way a good and almost sessionable IPA."
"Another really good sessionable IPA from CA. A little high on the ABV but its hidden well."
"A very nice beer and much better than other Firestone Walker beers I've had from sixpacks. This beer alone is reason enough for me to try some of their other products as they come out- and not just the really hard to find ones like 10 or 11. Pours a dark golden with a thin head and spotty lacing. Smells citrusy, herbal, and a bit earthy. Nicely balanced. The taste is equally balanced between the hops and malt with some nice length to the flavors. Chewy malt with a touch of sweetness and nicely bitter earthy hops. Very good body, and a nice long finish. Delicious, I'm quite impressed with this offering. If it were available in my area it would o into my regular rotation."
"Had on tap in the Firestone Taproom in Buellton. The last time I had this was from a 5 day old growler that had lost a lot of it's carbonation but still tasted great. It was a whole different beer with great carbonation at the brewery. Loads of pine, citrus, not as much berry character as the growler probably because the snappy carbonation really emphasizes the aggressive pine and grassy flavors. The smell just leaps out of the glass and what I love about this, like all other west-coast IPA's, is that they do it on a light body. Sure the beer is not without some malt in it but they really know how to let the hops shine without leaving too many residual sugars behind to make it syrupy. Another great west coast IPA!"
"Thanks to fellow Zappaphile Rzzz for this wonderful beer."
"D: Downright sessionable."
"I picked up a couple bottles (12oz) out of a six pack, just to give it a try; now regret not getting the whole six pack. Seems like some people can't find this brew but hopefully will be getting out there a bit more sooner. I love Firestone-Walker; this brew just gave me another reason. Now my problem is do i make this my new go-to IPA or stick with Nectar IPA."
"i'd love to get this on the regular. very easy to drink and well balanced."
"D - goes down easy, a very enjoyable brew."
"Pours a dark amber color with a light white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Slightly spicy aroma of malts and hops. Similar taste with a bit. of orange too. Somewhat astringent finish and aftertaste. Medium-bodied with moderate tingly carbonation. A nice pale ale, though not exceptional and with a bit more carbonation than I'd generally like."
"D: An excellent quaffer."
"Firestone is in my top 5 breweries. Their subtle offerings are clean without flaw. Their big beers are world class."
"Draught at the FW taproom. Clear gold with a sticky head. Smooth citric, pine and mango aroma. Solid pale malt flavor with crisp and bitter hops, but remains fairly balanced. Crisp, medium body. Solid IPA. can't wait to see this in bottles. Rerate: 12oz bottle. Plenty of malt and flavorfull hops, with enough bitterness to keep it all together, but not to overhwelm. Drinks sooo easy for 7.5%abv. Got to boost this a little from last time."
"Drinkability on this one was high as I could see going through a sixer of these like they were water on a hot summer day. Now if only I had a steady supply of these I would be all set..."
"A refreshingly hoppy, tasty beer that's all about hops but still not overboard with those little green monsters."
"It's a flavor explosion for an IPA. If you like fruit beers and hop beers, this is a great combination of the two."
"Toasted grains and hop bitterness up front. Juicy fruits and toffee malts approach sweetness before tropical fruit pineapple hop flavors signal a minty, herbal, resinous bitterness. Even some citrus in there. Finish dries out with long-lasting tongue-numbingness. Latent honey malt sweetness. Medium-bodied with a slightly sticky feel. Yum!"
"Into a Pizza Port pint. Great clear golden color. Some rising carbo. Bone colored head falls to a thin cap and a ring. Awesome candied grapefruity smell that I am an absolute sucker for. More of the same in the taste with a noticeable toasted maltiness. Mouthfeel a bit on the lighter side if it wasn't for the slight stickiness in the end. Carbonation a bit low, so maybe not the best with some foods. Absolutely sessionable even with 7.5%. Not really something that you have to think about to drink, just enjoy an easy-drinking beer."
"Keep your eye out for this one. Highly recommended for an IPA that blurs its way to the cusp of Imperial, without sacrificing drinkability. Outstanding."
"Poured into a affligem goblet with an aggressive pour and got a thin white head with an orange colored body. wonderful aroma of flowery hops. Flavor is divine. Nice quick hop bite up fornt, but incredibly sweet and smooth finish. I do not know if I have had another IPA with this wonderful balance and sweetness/smoothness. Incredibly drinkable for 7.5%. can not wait for more!! If you have some, BM me!!"
"This IPA rather surprised me, didn't think I'd like it as much as I did."
"Love is not a strong enough emotion for how I feel about this beer! Hot Damn! I'm ready to make a serious commitment to you Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA you beautiful bastard! I have not been too impressed with previous FW offerings, but this is damn near perfection! Pungent hops blast the nose, I'm thinking Cascade, not sure. Smells terrific! Pours orange copper with perfect head. Taste is out of this world! A rich tapestry of oily west coast hop flavor, grapefruit and pine balanced to perfection. At 7.7 it feels like a DIPA but it so well integrated and drinkable that it deserves it's own classification, maybe IPA+ This is a truly special beer!"
"This was a great beer. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The color is a beautiful orange amber color with a 1/2 inch white head which dissapates to a light lacing. The nose is hoppilicious, great piney hops, juicy citrus fruits, and just the tiniest bit of malts. The taste is wonderfully balanced, even though it is a heavily hopped beer, there is the right balance to make it work. The mouthfeel is medium in body and slighty viscous and very drinkable. A wonderful offering from firestone."
"Must have!"
"Mouthfeel is semidry and the body is a nice medium heft. Another great California IPA."
"D: A pretty good IPA all-around, I won't have any problem finishing the sixer."
"D: Easy drinking and very tasty. I'll probably look to trade for some of this."
"Firestone Walker Brewing Co. has another winner with Union Jack India Pale Ale. Forget the British flag, though. This beer is Stars And Stripes Forever and is proud of it. I could (and would) drink this stuff by the case if it was available locally."
"HV"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the clear golden amber brew. Head recedes gradually, with goodly amounts of lace. Aroma is dominantly citrus, with some pale malt undertones. Taste begins with light sweetness, which quickly gives way to the lemony hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is quite good. A West Coast IPA that flirts with the limits, but doesn't go over the edge."
"Mouth is spot on, drinkability suffers only in the slightly heavy sweetness and apparent alcohol."
"2nd only to Pliny the Elder - I'd rather compare Union Jack to that than to Blind Pig. PtE is 8%, just above this one."
"Very good IPA that I'd certainly drink regularly if available here. The taste kind of falls off a little but is very pleasing nonetheless. Well worth trying for any hophead."
"Poured into a pint glass, light amber with a nice white head and good clarity. Wonderful hops aroma...smells like a pine grove, with maybe a couple of lemon trees in there. Flavor is caramel malt up front, with piney hops follow and a mildly bitter finish. Medium body and carbonation, an easy drinker."
"This is the epitomy of balance. Very neutral in character, with hints of alcohol burning the chest and throat on the finish. A layer of malt and caramel flavor with a layer of pine upon a layer of citrus. Lemon, and grapefruit witha squirt of starfruit. Just perfectly balanced with a resiny thick finish. Easy going and an easier drinker."
"Notes: I love a good IPA and this one didn't dissapoint. Sorta makes me wish I lived in California (but then I'd have to leave Kuhnhenn). I'm definitely gonna trade for more Union Jack. Pick this up!"
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is a touch high. Good drinkability. Very good IPA."
"Truly an enjoyable beer while possibly being a little too big after an incredibly brutal day building a huge tool shed for my father-in-law. This is a relax-time beer; not quite the beer you want to quench the thirst. Actually, the bitterness is making me want to have yet another beer..."
"Very recommended."
"Drinkability is high, hampered somewhat by the significant alcohol presence, another well-balanced and delicious California IPA that borders on the DIPA category, definitely check this one out if you can"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors"
"Drinkability is good. This is as good as I remember it. A bit on the strong side for a straight IPA, this borders on the DIPA side, and it's not all that easy to drink. But it's very tasty, and has a lot going for it. Well worth a try."
"Union Jack, welcome - I will drink you."
"The taste is very hoppy with a big bold grapefruit profile but I can taste a bit of malt in the background and it *does* take some of the edge off the bitterness. Nice medium body and carbonation, it finishes with a citric bitterness that lasts through the aftertaste. It's quite easy drinking, though I have to watch it because it isn't exactly a lightweight when it comes to the abv. This is a very nice IPA!"
"Very good. Haven't seen before, but will look for now. An excellent IPA that seems a bit under the radar at the moment. The price point is phenomenal."
"Bright orange color, good head, lace was good and came in irregular patterns. Aroma, wow. Pine needles and grapefruit galore. Decadent with each whiff. A tremendous smelling beer. Sweet malt with heavy pine accented hops. A touch of grapefruit. Nice. A bit too much of a good thing? Would have liked a bit more balance. A definite sipper and not a session IPA."
"Drinkability: Firestone-Walker has the potential to become one of the better brewers in the United States, if they just continue making bold beers this way. Union Jack is an extremely welcome addition to their roster. I can see myself picking up sixers of this for some time."
"D - This is a really drinkable beer. It felt pretty thin for a 7.5% ABV beer, which could cause this to sneak up on you. The dryness my cut down on drinkability a bit, but I would definately drink more if I had them."
"I could drink these for quite a while.. A huge thanks goes out to Class Act Trader Weibull. Jason.. I owe you big!"
"D:Great IPA. Nothing to extreme about this bad boy, which makes for your nice every day type of IPA."
"D At 7.5%, I wouldn't session these but I'll definitely drink another."
"Firestone makes another good beer, will be drinking many six packs of this in the future, one of the stronger California IPAs I have tasted, look forward to trying this on tap, recommended for any hopheads out there"
"I got this bottle in a trade with Weibull, thanks! The color is a golden orange with a small soapy head. First sniff makes me smile, nice hoppy grapefruit citrus aroma. The flavor is also hoppy with more grapefruit but is not at all unbalanced. This is a very good IPA but what do you expect given that it is from California? Oh, the 7.5% is not noticeable to the taste, nice."
"Overall, I really thought this was great, and a very nice way to welcome me into the world of Firestone Walker. A fantastic west coast style IPA, that did not overdue anything, it came and did very well. I would love to get a hold of this again as I thought it was simply remarkable."
"Grab a six pack for sure!"
"D- Highly drinkable, I will definitely buy a 6 pack of this in the future."
"A very solid and refreshing IPA. This satiated my craving for hops."
"Good stuff...I am afraid I can drink a 6'r of this one real fast...then watch out."
"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Small head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is nice and hoppy, with notes of grapefruit and malt underneath. Upon tasting it, hops hit you first with some citrus and resin, then the malts kick in with a nice caramel flavor. Aftertaste reminds me of pineapples and apples. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but lively. This is a pretty good IPA that's well balanced."
"Had on tap at JJ Brewski's. Nice golden to amber color. Orange/grapefruit aroma. Nice tropical notes, including some orange from Amarillo hops, I presume. I really liked the citrusy, orange juice quality, balance with the C hops presence. Excellent."
"Notes - i'm impressed, firestone has officially earned my respect, i don't like pales, or beers with high hops usually, so i'd say this is a pretty good beer. maybe i'm wrong but i'd say it's best for a beer to appeal to a wider audience rather than just to hop freaks."
"Notes - Another fine beer from a brewery that seems to be getting better and better."
"Could be a DIPA in IPA clothing if the mouthfeel wasnt thin. Try it if you can."
"Pours a very faint crystal clear copper hue with a fluffy white one finger head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. A fair amount of lacing is left behind on the sides. Light citrus and floral aromas up front. A smell that's almost like deodorant finds its way in the nose, not really diggin' it too much. A dry hay scent is also present with some fresh cut grass. Overall the aroma is a bit weak. Flavor is a zesty grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of evergreen. Slick feel quickly followed by a puckering dryness. Caramel malt is hidden but there, could definitely use some more to balance this one out. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with an overly dry aftertaste. Carbonation is steady throughout. I was really looking forward to this brew, but to be honest I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I had hoped. Too bitter for my tastebuds."
"Mouthfeel is a little syrupy at first, low carbonation. Not as rough as I remembered it."
"D: I don't know what the availability of this will be, but I plan on sessioning this on a number of occasions in the future. In California the IPA market is flooded, but apparently FW isn't afraid to get their feet wet and they've suceeded in crafting a quality IPA which can stand up to the best of them."
"I have had this beer a couple times on tap now, and it has as of yet failed to disapoint (even after drinking one into between two Elders). It pours a light copper color with a white head that settles quickly. While this site has it listed as an American IPA, this is a classic DIPA--over the top hops and strong, sticky sweet malt presence. The hops are present, but do not predominate. I would recommend this beer, and am happy this is going to be bottled soon."
"Super easy to drink AIPA that is quite easy to mistake for a low alcohol beer. Enough flavor here that you would NOT be out of line drinking this like a Double IPA. I could easily give this a 5 in both taste and drinkability but I will only pick one and easy to drink is the stronger of the two great things about this beer. Possibly the best AIPA there is anywhere."
"Drinkability- Well so far 2 for 2 on Firestone Walker brews being ridiculously good. I was tired and didn't really want to drink when we went to the bar but I'm so glad I did now. I perked right up after taking my first sip and realizing how good this brew is. Very easy drinking for 8%. When they start bottling this I'd snatch some up quick."
"D- well balanced with pronounced yet mellow flavors, i would definitely drink this again and recommend this, though sessionablility is a no for me"
"edit: It appears Firestone Walker will be adding this to their lineup, so maybe I had a fresh batch afterall. I read it will be bottled soon, which is quite exciting."
"A very good IPA and a nice hop fix. I can't be certain if I could have finished the growler (since I shared with a friend), but I would have liked to drink it all myself. I very enjoyable IPA and I am very glad to have had the chance to try it."
"Overall: probably one of the best damn IPAs that I have tasted in a long time. Very easily becoming one of my favorites. I am lucky that Buellton is not too far from me so I can easily get fresh growlers any time. This beer stands up with the best of them (because it IS of the best) and would recommend this refreshing brew to anyone in the area."
"Drinkability- The winner in my mind at this years fest. Sadly, it didn't place in the top three. It was Firestone Walker's first attempt at making this brew. They just kegged it the day before and my friend was the first in line to try it. Hope they keep making this one as it's one of the better DIPA's I've had."
"Very well done IPA. Recommended."
"Medium orange color. Large white foamy head. Aroma is grapefruity and floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. A nicely balanced IPA. Slightly more fruity than bitter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
