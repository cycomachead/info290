"Overall a very good IPA.  A light taste for an IPA not too much citrus taste but enough to know what kind of beer.  Not the neat of the IPAs but a simple uncomplicated beer."
""
"feels great all the way around. pine and citrus notes make for a refreshing drink."
"It is pretty good for an IPA.I'm just not a fan of IPA's"
"O - A pleasant, bright IPA, with subtle fruit, and a mild malt backbone.  Not extraordinary, but quite servicable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear Amber with fluffy white head, smells of resiny hops slight caramel malts, tastes of crackery malt undertones with piney bitter grapefruity hops, smooth thin mouthfeel, strong barely dry finish"
"I love Ranger. It's very drinkable and is a great IPA. The hops are smooth and has a light gold appearance. Nice white head gives this beer a refreshing aftertaste."
"Ranger is a totally better than OK IPA. By no means is it life altering, but its perfectly drinkable."

"1 pint 6 fl oz (650ml) bottle. It sat on the counter for a while before I opened it so I would guess it was probably 45-47 degrees, poured into a room temperature 20oz fluted beer glass. Appearance was amazing. A little more carbonation than I expected, 2 finger white head, good retention and nice lacing. Surprisingly clear dark amber color. Smell was what I would characterize as typical IPA. Nothing outstanding or remarkable. Citrusy/piney/floural... IPA. Taste was an immediate hop forward bomb on the front of the tongue with a dry finish. Again, my reaction was that it was a good IPA, but nothing really extraordinary to separate it from the other 2 kerzillion IPA's dominating the shelf space across America. The feel was probably a bit drier than most IPA's. Overall not a bad beer at all. ""Refreshing"" would be a good one word description. I'm not sure I would run right out and buy more, but that's probably more because I'm growing extremely tired of the IPA fad."

"12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Pours a very clear golden with a thin, whispy white head of foam that quickly fades down into a film. Lots of carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Floral aroma, also noted hints of spice, citrus, orange, grapefruit, and ginger. Light weight to the mouthfeel. Quite bitter, with a prominent hop taste. Grapefruit and citrus are also present. A bit boozy for 6.5%, but drinkable. Tasted a bit thin, in terms of actual flavor. Not bad, but not that good."
""
"super bitter, with a linger aftertaste, great smell"
""
""
""
"Probably will not seek out, but would drink again."
"Other then the carbonation A very nice IPA"

"This is one if my go to beers. It is consistent, and well rounded. It's tasty, and affordable, and very available. Has a nice level of bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Very bitter and metallic tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good, if not exceptional IPA.  Definitely a go-to.  Can never go wrong with the Ranger."
""
""
""
"Lots of pine and resin on the palate. Nice fresh hop flavors.  Although a little one dimensional I've found this beer to be quite consistent.  Good beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"Still not an IPA fan, and New Belgium's Ranger didn't make me anymore of a fan."
""
""
""
""
"Piney and and hoppy. Not my favorite ipa but I'll drink it if it's available."
"zesty citrus flavor, mild bitterness, like a crisp cool Christmas tree dripping with fresh snow and hints of evergreen sap, different with every sip, honey dew melon hints bring in a touch of sweetness on the first sip, would buy and drink again"
""
""
""
"The taste is very good with dank hop flavor and citrus quality which evokes a bitter rind aspect with slight tropical grapefruity and mild pine taste with low malt sweetness and very low alcohol flavor with slight astringency in taste with a grassy quality as it warms with a malt flavor that has a subtle toasted quality. Very good IPA I prefer this to many available on the market -I recommend this if you haven't tried it yet...I don't know why I waited to try it, perhaps I had expectations as far as New Belgium and hoppy beers."
""

"A sweet, decently hoppy, mass produced budget IPA that is so consistant sometimes I worry about what they put in it. The flavor is crisp, very sweet, floral orange grapefruit combo that has ok bitterness. Its biggest strength is its consistancy. I can't remember a time when it didn't taste like itself on tap or in bottle (unlike Averys sadly). Its biggest weakness is in the mouthfeel I think. It just feels thin too often but thats not to say thats a terrible thing, but the flavor ends up feeling a bit generic  or mass produced at times because of it and its really better than that. Its usually priced VERY well too so that is a bonus."
""
"Pretty good IPA. Very, very hoppy."
""
"A clean, crisp, and affordable IPA.  And always on tap at my local concert venue!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean fresh , a real hoppy ipa that has a nice pine finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall this beer is great. I think that it has a complex flavor and a well-timed release of each component of its flavor and mouthfeel. Once again, the aroma and taste are excellent and the complexity of this beer compensates for the slightly low end ABV. I would pour through a few of these easily and I am confident that you will too."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I call this beer the ""Champagne of IPAs"" because I love its carbonation and other characteristics, and the availability is astonishing. You should be able to find this beer anywhere and I factor that into a review because it shows the brewery that sends it to such rural areas of the country really care about who gets to try their beer. It stands proud against a desolate backdrop of silver boxes full of disgusting light domestic swill. Try not to drink six of these at a time. Cheers."
"Good easy drinking IPA.  Not in my top 10 though."
"Good IPA at a good price!  $ 7.49 + tax for a six pack in my town."
""
"Pretty good beer, wish it was a tad bit less hoppy."
""
""
""

"My favorite beer that New Belgium has to offer!"
""
""
"Currently my favorite IPA for just kicking back and having a beer solo.  Great day to day beer.  Just the right amount of ABV and hops to get you in a relaxed state of mind.  The piney yet grapefruit citrus tones are excellent in this beer as well."
""
""
"Draft is way better than bottles, I keep a keg at home.  Balanced hoppiness with grapefruit fore and after taste.  Yum"
""
""

"16 oz. pint on draft at Nanny O'Brien's Irish Pub in Cleveland Park, NW D.C.; unknown brewing/packaging date; poured into a standard pint glass; drank over 30 minutes on Tues., 01/13/2015"

"Slightly harsh IPA with Grapefruit upfront & through the taste."
"Hit that IPA spot, hmmm."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is 6.5 abv & you can taste all 6.5 of it. Strong alcohol taste which I do not like about this beer. Has a very pineappley smell which you think you would taste but you cannot taste the pineapple only smells like pineapples. piney on the front & bitter on the back. I use to like this beer until I put it up against Jai Alai & sweet water IPA. If I'm gonna spend this much money on a domestic ipa then I would much rather spend my $ on sweet water or Jai alai. For the price this beer is not to good."

"O – Interesting mix of flavor but not entirely pleasant.  Something just a bit off."

"No surprise that NB offers up a rock steady IPA."
"From a bottle to a pint glass. Great amber color with a half inch of white head dissolving to lace. Great nose with fresh grassy hops and citrus. Taste is more citrus with secondary pine notes with what I think of as an uncharacteristic clean finish for an IPA. Not that I mind the clean finish. I like some separation between sips rather than the usually lingering bitterness. An above average IPA in my opinion, but I'm no hop head."
"Good taste,bitter finish.If I have other choices for a sitting I'll have those."
""
""
""
"Good IPA, but there is so much out there better... at the same price."
"Overall: Very good IPA!"
""
""
""
"o: A substantial IPA, obvious quality.  The hops give it a bit more punch than their fine Fat Tire Amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a dogfish head 60 minute IPA but a bit sweeter and lighter."
""
"Looks how it's supposed to, amber color with a smallish head. Surprisingly sweet nose, malt, candy, and also a bunch of fruit. Maybe some cookies. Flavor is similarly sweet; lots of fruitiness. Hop bitterness is there, although fairly subtle. Well balanced. Overall a nice, very drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not offensive, but nothing great as far as IPA's go, with the grapefruit being so strong in the smell I was hoping for it in the flavor."
"This isn't the beer made by this brewery to reach for first.  This is just an average IPA with a good nose.  It doesn't disappoint, but nothing special."
"Really enjoy this beer, bold flavor great finish. All around solid for a common beer and not too pricey"
""
"Has a really dark hoppy taste. I could have sworn that the recipe has changed because about 5 years ago, this beer definitely had a light hoppy taste"

"A clear golden amber brew that releases a good sized head that has good retention and slow fade that leaves quite a bit of decoration on the glass. Smell is a comfortable blend of caramel malt and piney hops. Taste is solid but unremarkable. Light caramel,piney hops, a leafiness with a hint of mint. Medium light weight and gentle carbonation. Quite quaffable. Not a standout but a good brew."
""
"Unsurprising but solid all around."
""
""
"Good beer, recomneded"
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful. An easy-to-find great IPA that has what you'd expect and exceeds preconceptions. Very drinkable and refreshing. A much more flowery, herbal hop profile."
"This beer is extremely drinkable while maintaining the taste of a good IPA."
""
""
"Overall... I have a hard time rating this because it's just so different from other beers I've had that it's hard to make a comparison, but it's been a pretty enjoyable experience both times I've had it and works pretty well with food. This beer has taught me that IPAs aren't something to fear, even as a fairly new beer drinker who'd never had anything with more than 23 IBUs previously. (though trying one or two bottles/glasses first rather than going for a full six-pack would probably be wise if ypu've never had an IPA before.) I do think I'll probably make my next ""hoppy"" beer something a bit milder like a pale ale or a pilsner rather than another IPA, though--I'm just not quite used to such strong hop flavors and bitterness yet."
""
""

""

"I take Sam Adams Rebel over this one. It's a good option but not too impressed. So many great IPAs out there that this isn't on my wants list"

"New Belgium's Ranger IPA - pretty good, but also nothing outstanding as well.  I was impressed with it's look and smell.  It had good lacing, a great dark golden color, and a rich citrusy smell, but outside of that, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  There was plenty of after-taste for a normal IPA beer.  Again, it was better than average, for me, but nothing I would go out of my way to partake of."

"This is a solid IPA and a great example of the style. The smell is all hops, and it's predominantly pine. The taste is mouthwatering; loads of pine, citrus, grass, and some juicy fruits coat the tounge. It ends with just the right amount of bitterness. I really like the feel of this beer. It starts off with an in the face hop bomb but the malt balances it out just enough to leave the mouth watering and wanting more. Great IPA"

"I don't know why, but I am in love with this beer. I will probably catch hell for this, but I could say that this beer is as good as O'Dell's  IPA. Though the rankings don't show it.  I would recommend people give this beer another shot."

"Stands out from other new Belgium products. I nice crisp IPA that has a very strong dry hop flavor. Very earthy but not too overbearing for an IPA"

"Pretty durn good. Not quite strong as I like my IPA's but still immensely hoppy. If you're craving some intense hops content but you're not looking to get super drunk I recommend this beer strongly. It has a very strong hops flavor, but it is still very smooth. I recommend this to anyone who has the chance to sample it and will continue to keep it in my personal roster."

"Transparent orange with fluffy white head. Aroma of citrus and rind, grass, grapefruit, and pine. Flavors of citrus, pine, mint, grapefruit, lemon skins, and bitterness comes smoothly followed by some booze. Medium bodied with medium carbonation."

"This is my go-to IPA. The price is quite reasonable, and being sold in 12-packs of 12 oz. cans is the best format around for beer. At 6.5% you get a ton a flavor without too much alcohol although after a few you will definitely be buzzed. Price is right, very good (actually somewhat underrated), very easy to get, and great for when your hosting a party or guests are coming over."

"Overall, I do say: wow,  though I've had this several times in my life when I sit down to analyze this one,  I'm amazed how dank and resinous this one is and how different it really is from other AIPA's. Still,  I'd come back to this, I always do."
"Smells alive and I like that. Clarity is good. Carbonation portrays small bubbles continually floating to the top. Small layer of foam on head after gentle pour. Several IPAs and DIPAs have a processed pellet hop flavor. This one is different - refreshing, alive, and a good bite. Tastes like I put a fresh hop flower in my mouth. I like the low alcohol (6.5% ABV). Hops need to overpower alcohol with IPAs and DIPAs and this one does. Easy to drink. The bitterness slows me down in a good way. Real decent IPA, and it's a pretty mainstream brewery."

"Ok, color, head and lacing are all ok. Now, the aroma of piney hops and citrus peel that hit your nose is divine!!!!!!. The taste explodes with hops, pine, citrus and a touch of bread. This all blends together to form a beer that all hopheads should love. Lingering hop, pine and resin is also very nice after you have finished drinking"

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 11/16/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Overall, if a new beer drinker came to me and ask, ""What is an IPA that, to you, tastes closest to the formula of an American IPA and exemplifies that style in a way that defines it?"" The answer would be New Belgium's Ranger. It is by a long way NOT the best IPA nor is it characterized by uniqueness and distinctive flavors, but it is certainly one of the most standard and balanced beers of its type. A wonderful hop balance, nice body and crisp citrus (grapefruit) notes. A solid A-."

"O- A pretty decent IPA that is easy to find and very affordable, nice flavor and mouthfeel for a lower abv IPA. That said, I probably wouldn't pick this one over something like Two Hearted, Centennial, Torpedo, or Lagunitas IPA, which are usually my go to choices for an IPA sixer. I also found the bitterness a bit too big and lingering for my preference."

"I have tried this one over the years several times, it is a very good beer. It is quite possibly one of my gateway IPA's, I was beginning to enjoy the style around the time I tried this one, but it was one of the first that really did it for me. Its piney, resinous, but now looking back it is not all that potent compared to some of the other IPA's I have consumed over the years. Its a very well balanced beer and one that someone should try if they are looking to try an introductory IPA. It definitely has that signature Colorado style and New Belgian yeast strain going on. Its a bit biscuity but hoppy enough to make a novice to IPA's enjoy this particular style. Then again it may come across as a bruiser, but if you find your self getting into IPA's or Pale Ales, you should try this one out. Its easy to find and relatively inexpensive for what you get."

"Poured in a 20 ounce beer club members' mug at Mellow Mushroom in Southlake, Texas. A solid easy drinking choice for an IPA. Very middle of the road and maybe a little old fashioned but not in a bad way. Subtle citrus notes. A good go-to beer available in a lot of places."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 13 oz tulip glass. The smell hits you immediately and is of pine and citrus. The beer is a medium golden color. The taste is citrusy and bitter. Not overpowering though. Light and refreshing. The bitterness lingers with you but has some sweet notes. Overall, a good IPA."

"O: I'm not big on New Belgium's wheat beers, but I find their IPAs to be very tasty."
"Poured light amber color with thick foamy head. Moderate lacing on side. Predominately citrus aroma. Slightly grassy. Citrus taste up front quickly followed by grassy, hoppy taste. Slight malts with moderately bitter aftertaste on the end. This is definitely a beer I can drink often."

""
""
"Hoppy Beering!!!"
""
"Overall a really good beer. I have been drinking beer with much less hops here lately so that probably amplifies the hoppyness for me. It was really nice because they were not overpowering and as mentioned, they seemed to mellow out as the glass emptied."

"Pours out a light copper. Thin head. Smells malty as hell. Worty. Hops are of the citric variety, but wildly under represented in the nose. Flavor is malty, worty, Grape Nut-y, sweet, with a touch of hops. I pick up heavy toasty NB house taste. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than I'd like. Carbonation is a bit prickly. Not feeling this. Weirdly worty. Lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite beers! It is in my top 3 IPAs. A very west coast type IPA, which I apparently love. Fabulous citrus and floral fragrance and flavor. Quite bitter with a strong grapefruit flavor. Not as balanced and some may prefer, definitely on the hoppy side. But for me, this is a great IPA. I recommend this to anyone who likes a hoppy IPA. Although I am tempted to keep trying new IPAs, and I do, I still manage to always pick up a 6-er of Ranger a few times a years. Long live Ranger."
"Overall - it's good...not out of this world good, but a good beer."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Hmmm...I think I like my IPAs with more malt and more aromatic hops. Full flavored, but not amazing. A middle of the pack, but hop forward IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat one-note. Good balance of malt and flavoring hops, but too bitter for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Ranger is a solid IPA that offers some interesting hop flavors with a fairly sweet malt background. Hops could be a little more assertive, in fact this beer is pretty tame, but this would be a good beer to introduce someone new to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I won't be intentionally buying it again--If you're a big IPA fan, you probably owe it to yourself to try it, but not enough undertones or body for me."

"Ranger pours a clear golden color with a nice large lacing head. The aroma is sweet, lots of citrus, and a noticeable hop note. The taste has lots of citrus, and a noticeable hop bite, finishes very wet. Good feel, a little watery. Overall its a very solid IPA."
""
""
"Review and update from fresh bottle. Poured into a Dogfish Head pint. Pours a medium golden amber with a two two finger off-white head. Aroma of citrus hops, grapefruit forward and light bready malt. Flavor of quite grassy and citrus hops, caramel malt, mixed light fruit; sharp citrus hop finish. Medium bodied. A nicely made old fashioned American IPA, with more hop bitterness than herbal hop flavors. Still nicely balanced and flavorful."
""
""

"Overall - A solid American IPA by New Belgium. Excellent hop profile, definitely a winner amongst hopheads."

"Welcome to Alberta, New Belgium. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance at long last. Of course one of the new arrivals is going to be an IPA. Ranger is a dark gold, perhaps just shy of light bronze ale with a decent amount of light beige head. Looks quite fizzy and light-bodied. Aroma is pleasantly herbal, fruity, and tangy, featuring a bouquet of grapefruit and orange, lychee, gooseberry, canned peaches, a hint of pineapple ... Nice fruity hop notes with a gentle caramel malt background. This IPA is rather refined, bold of flavor but not coarsely bitter, rather smooth, moderately medicinal, and notably fruity. Has one of the more pleasing gooseberry or currant flavors I've encountered in such a beer, rich and assertive, musty and spicy but not pungently catty. Also features faintly toasty malts, more peach and lychee fruit, melon, medicinal orange, and some pot resin that shows up late in the show. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost veering into creamy territory, a little soapy, on the lighter side for an IPA body-wise but this allows the hop flavors to shine through nicely. Not an obviously West Coast pine bomb and that's OK by me. Workmanlike but not devoid of some artistic flourishes. Recommended for the IPA lover and relative newcomer alike."

""

"overall not bad, not bad at all. better than some other IPA's i have had, however not as good as others in the same price point. i wasn't disappointed with it but i would prefer a commodore Perry over this any day."

"Final thoughts - at $8 a sixer and a nice 6%+ abv, this is a great way to get started with IPA's"
""
""
""
"I'm a little surprised this one doesn't get a little more love from my fellow BA's, I thought it was well rounded and not really lacking anywhere. Might be a little pricy though here in Alberta but yet another welcome addition to the shelf in my neck of the woods"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though I rated this one kind of low. I really enjoy this IPA. I've had it a few times, and each time it hasn't a different taste. I think the strongest taste is pine, some floral, and mild fruit notes, like grapefruit, with slight peach. Very sessionable IPA."

"Ranger from New Belgium Brewing pours an Amber Color. Small White Head. The smell is rich with hops. Nothing bad about the small or the color. The taste is ok at first. The after taste is not as good it is bitter. I don't believe I will be getting this brew again. I just can't get over the after taste. This brew was not for me. ..AT ALL."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle with a golden yellow color and a nice foamy white head. Has a nice citrus aroma. Flavor includes plenty of hops in the body and some dry citrus in the finish. There’s a touch of carbonation that helps give this a nice medium body feel. This is a pretty impressive IPA."

""
""
""
""
""
"This is an IPA I always recommend to people that are new to craft beer as its very basic. Nothing too complex in smell or taste. A nice golden color, but not much else to compliment here. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they are transitioning into IPAs from the stale beers that I won't name."

"This is a pretty good hoppy IPA. Some might find it a little to ""dry"" but at 6.5 I'd think 2 or 3 would be a perfect number to partake in...a great little bomb."
""
"This sketch is based on one serving. Wish that I had a few more to base an opinion on, maybe pour one or two to get a full look and sense of the aroma. Otherwise, strong ale flavor that wasn't gravelly or perfumey. Tasted great and well-balanced, crisp finish. I look forward to my next experience with this brew."

"A very ""safe"" IPA, there's nothing challenging about this beer. It's run-of-the-mill, IMO. It could be a nice canned option, but for a couch time IPA, it just doesn't fit into my schedule. I want better from NB!!!! Not sure I can purchase again."

"O: Overall, a good, but not great tasting beer. I was not as impressed in the aromas and appearance. The taste was a bit flat as well, lacking that kick in the teeth and roun. Good mouthfeel. Not a complete departure from their Belgian beer roots, this IPA maintains some spice characteristics that resemble a Belgian, but I would recommend other Colorado IPAs over this one."

"This is one of my go to IPA's when I can't make a decision. Pours a light straw color, good head and retention. Smell is wonderful, grapefruit, a little pine, nice and hoppy. Taste is similar to smell, grapefruit, orange peel with a nice hop linger. A great west coast IPA that won't scare away the newbies. Awesome beer."
""
""
"Bought this cause it was on sale. Not a huge fan of New Belgium, but this made me want to try some of their other beers. I really like the smell, a smack of hops, citricy and flowery. Looks alright, nice golden amber color, sticky head, but it faded fast. Taste was not what I expected, there is just something ""off"" about it, but the hops really shine and I cant quite put my finger on it, but its just a touch too sweet or something. Really easy drinking, kind of thin for my liking. I would buy this again if it was on sale, but definitely not my first choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I definitely like this addition to the New Belgium line of beers. This will satisfy anyone who enjoys a hop forward brew. I am no stranger to Ranger and seek it out regularly. A good solid brewski."

"Pours a straw blonde with very little head. Sips quite smooth and light with a forward bitterness that is pleasant but with nothing to balance it out on the back end. This is a very light and simple ipa. Not unpleasant in any way but lacking the complexity of many other American ipas. A good before for sessioning and to quench a hearty thirst on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Has an odd after taste... Almost taste like there was an old dried piece of Thanksgiving turkey in my glass . Maybe a bad batch. Perhaps it sat in light? Doesn't seem to satisfy. Great value though... A re-visit is certainly in order~"

"A pretty good IPA up front. Too resin-y for me, however."
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is foamy (3/4) and smooth (1/4). Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
"The herbal edge gives some dryness to this otherwise bright beer, and it's very clean. It's got balance in the feel as well, with good contributions to the tongue of both crispness and smoothness under a firm carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Ranger goes into my never again beer list. It isn't bad as I love IPA's but there's too much good beer for a brewery to make this. Avoid if you have any other craft options."

"O- I received a few of these from a friend and had the ability to try it again, and again, and again... I hope my taste testing of more than a few didn't skew my thoughts of it but I think the super hoppiness and relative dry aftertaste seemed a consensus from what I've read."

"Great to see New Belgium show up in Ohio, I heard about it, here's the new labeled Ranger IPA at a wowing $2.99 a bomber, I passed on the Fat Tire Ale and the Tripel and got two bombers of Ranger IPA. The forest ranger hat full of hops had me at hello. Beer pours a brilliant copper body with slightly off white head forming thick and rising well above the rim of my pint glass. Aroma earthy, pine, citric qualities...hey gang the hops are all here. Perfect drinkability, clean bitter hops but finishes clean and bready. The type of sessionable hops I could consume in number, albeit the ABV at 6.5% my stand in my way, clean cereal biscuit notes bring out a bread like character, that meshes well with the hops. Let me talk about the hops since it's an IPA and all...great hop flavor, grapefruit peel, pines, earthiness a bit of dirt kicked up on the palate. The label mentions Simcoe, Cascade, and Chinook relatively clean sharp bitter finish that's well balanced and doesn't really kill you with the hops, again the balance and drinkability with hop flavor think of drinking a bomber of something really mass produced with actual malt flavor and hop bitterness married in perfect balance. Overall I can't stop buying this after two bottles, I will drink the rest of the local stock available to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first beer from New Belgium and they just hit Ohio shelves this week. This is a pretty solid IPA. Great balance. It doesn't quite standout compared to the top-tier examples of the style, but it's pretty enjoyable with a somewhat unique hop profile. $2.99/bomber is a great price in the world of bombers."

"Overall 3.5: A pleasant and refreshing IPA. I would give it a 3.7 or so in this category if I could. Clean, clear and well-balanced, it is -nonetheless-- a bit too dry for my tastes as far as a session beer goes. However, as a one-off or a beer while out at a restaurant, it is great. I would really like to try this beer on tap somewhere. Its grapefruit characteristics remind me of Lord Chesterfield, a beer I can no longer find in Georgia. Frowny face emoticon for that sad fact of beeranity."

"When poured out the beer is yellow in color with a slight bit of orange. The head was one finger and white that receded within half a minute. The smell is definitely of fruity hops. I get mostly a of oranges or maybe tangerines with a slight hint of bitterness. Taste is pretty well balanced with a decent malt bill that definitely keeps up with the bitterness in the nose. I didn't notice any malt in the nose but definitely present in the taste. Not sure what the hop bill is here but it really is hard for me to describe. Seems to loose the fruit that I found in the nose as the hops really escape anything I can think of to describe. They really just seem to add bitterness without a tangible taste. The taste is quite balanced. Mouthfeel is thin as one would expect. Overall I really liked the beer more than the last time I had it years ago."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good IPA. Just the right amount of dry hop; it's restrained and rounds out the profile but still leaves it drinkable. I as well really enjoyed the restrained use of grain in an otherwise hop forward style. Once again it offered a depth of flavor without hijacking the IPA."
"O: Would recommend to any fan of IPAs. Usually decently priced ($7.99 here). Not an amazing IPA, but with the price and availability in mind, is a frequent occupant of my fridge."

"A serviceable ipa to be sure,decent body with some lingering unfermentables/ volatiles. Would have again but not interesting enough to buy I think. A bit forgettable but quite easy to drink and balance is pretty good. Classic American IPA with enough hops to please."
""
""
"This fits the category of American IPA very well. Hop-forward with a firm malt backing and a touch of alcohol warmth. It has a fruity, complex hop character. Wonderful! A hop-head's delight!"

"O: A very interested mature beer. Very nice for this style and rather unique in my humble opinion. The taste is unique to me and it a nice balance of flavors, feel and texture. I would not put this beer at the top of my list but definitely worth trying because it is very unique. Coming from New Belgium, its a mature concoction to be sure. If you dont like all the hops in your face taste that is typical of an AIPA, you should try this beer."
""
""
"Overall: Beautiful looking IPA that I couldn't wait to drink. I wasn't expecting too much and while it's better than I thought it would be I think this beer could use some work. Maybe work on the hop profile more to balance out the bitterness and bring in more fruitiness. Beef up the body to work better with the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good example of the style !"
"The appearance of this IPA is nearly flawless. Wonderful head that sticks around, excellent lacing and wonderful , surprisingly clear darker yellow, color. The smell is quite pleasant but not profound. You get some hops and citrus just what you'd expect, I did not get any pine but apparently may others have. The taste is wonderful with a barrage of hops but none of them overpowering or overly hoppy. In the end you don't get much hoppiness but plenty of subtle citrus. The mouth-feel is phenomenal, not too carbonated and all very subtle and smooth. I often talk about balance and that's exactly what this beer has. Wonderful hops but not overbearing and a great intro style for the newcomers. Highly recommended to anyone!"

"I find this to be one of the best IPA's you can get for the price. It tastes as good as a lot of other pricier craft IPA brews and is more drinkable than most. It is very simple for an IPA but has all the necessary qualities; pine and floral hops, grapefruit and citrus up front and in the finish a very light malt backbone. Although there is nothing really special coming through this brew does everything right and the price can't be beat."

""
""
"Amber to almost an amber orange in appearance. A fingernail of white foam rests on top. Aroma is a strong pine like hop aroma with some light biscuity malt. The flavor is very bitter and like biting into a grapefruit. Very fresh hop flavoring. A bit of a thick and sticky mouthfeel. Finish is long lingering bitter fade."

""
""
""
"Chinook, Simcoe, Cascade hops are delicious, but a bit grassy for my taste, and the malt to pale to have much influence over the dominance of the hops. The golden color and generous head are delighful to look at... This is a very drinkable IPA, but not as tasty as New Belgium's Rampant Imperal IPA"
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer by any stretch, but for me this beer is just a bit too thick and grainy- particularly in the taste and finish. I prefer either a leaner, dryer IPA, or one that is sweeter and thinner with more of a honeyed note to the malt. When I get a grainier, thicker one like this, I can't help but think of a mash that has been inefficiently sparged. I'm not saying that's the case here, just what it puts me in mind of. The hops are fine, if a little tame. I'd like either to see some more citrus tang or more of a piney blast- particularly to cut through the graininess. What you get instead is a respectable but slightly boring blend of the two with any earthy note underpinning it all. For me, this is the kind of beer I drink when I'm eating at someplace that doesn't really have a real beer list, but they've got this. In other words, it'll do in a pinch."

"O - Overall, this was pretty standard. I know this isn't there flagship beer, but its better than other than other mainstream IPA's."
""
""

"Overall: I was extremely surprised. I was judging it by the price, having never heard of it, and it paid dividends! I also just got done mowing the lawn, and it made for a very awesome session of cooling down and relaxing."

"I have been pretty new to the IPA market as of late. I have drank a lot of the great ones (in my area), I love a full hoppy beer. In my opinion Ranger IPA is so-so. It has a nice rich color of copper. Very little head. The aroma is excellent. The first taste is also very good. But that is where it stops. For an advertised 70 IBU there is no bite from the hops. You still get that pine, citrus feel in your mouth, but only when you drink. It has no staying power. The sweetness of the hops are non existent. It is smooth and well balanced. I would say it could be an IPL also. It's a decent session beer if only the ABV were a bit lower, the 6.5 does nothing to help. Worth a try, you will definitely love the way your belches taste."
""
"BIG piney hops! super crazy head stands up and stays there. the smell of this beer is is all evergreen and spicy hops. taste is big pine with some resiny notes on aftertaste. BIG carbonation and easy drinkability for a more alcoholic beer. (6.5%). If you enjoy american style I.P.A.s then this beer is a no brainer."
"I love New Belgium Brewing products, but this was hard to swallow. The smell was very hoppy with a hint of mid-eastern spices. I also smelled something like a desert weed. The taste was not like it smelled. It tasted like grass brewed in hairspray. I was very disappointed. This was my first IPA and I will have to say it will take a lot of courage to try another. Maybe I will have to grow my pallet for this style of beer. I will try some more and if my taste for IPA changes, I may revise this review. Otherwise I cannot say that I like it at this time."

""
""
"It has been a while since I tried Ranger and if I remember correctly I was sadly disappointed by New Belgium's first release of this IPA. However, I am giving it a second try and must say for a single IPA this is a good IPA, not great mind you but a butt ton better than the last two IPAs I have had to date. The color is what I expect a light honey and a pout that creates a nice head and dissipates evenly across the top of the beer. My first smell off the top surprised right away I detected that nice grapefruit smell. The first taste went in quite well as the beer sat on my tongue the bitterness spread evenly across my palate and then cleared out right after I swallowed the beer down. The residual beer taste in my mouth was pleasant enough to warrant a second taste just to make sure I wasn't deceiving myself, and then of course a third and fourth and so on and so forth. NB you all did a great job in improving this IPA."

""

"O - Overall, a pretty good IPA, but it doesn't stand out for me. It doesn't have a great depth of flavor or aroma to me, and there is no single characteristic that stands out."

"Much happier with Ranger IPA. But after rating over 10 so-so to excellent PNW brews, I am not very impressed with Ranger at all, it is just OK. Maybe it should be re-marketed as a Summer Ale?"

"Short and sweet review. Pours a light copper with a chunky head, boat loads of lacing. The nose overtakes my scent with floral and tropical hops, little to no malt. Floral, citrus, and evergreen highlight the taste. I think this one has been sitting around for 3-4 months and the malts have yet to take over. These hops are preserving and delicious. Good floral IPA."

"Ranger is a pretty simple, tasty IPA. It's refreshing and extremely drinkable, with it's most remarkable aspect being its clean malt base. The malts are just so perfectly clean and crisp, they allow the more delicate citrus flavors of the not excessively bitter hops to shine. Like the other New Belgium main-line beers I've had so far, it's not a jaw-dropper, but instead an extremely tasty and very drinkable beer."

"Good by Oct 27 bomber, had on July 29. I assume that means pretty damn fresh. Pours a clear light copper golden with big fluffy white head. Aroma is big pine hops, sweet, and more pine. Beautiful. Flavor is pine bitter up front, fading into light floral citrus, then lots of grass, and finishing with a lingering grapefruit. Light bodied and yet slick. Medium high carbonation. This is very nicely done! I could drink this all day."

"I believe that New Belgium is noted for other than IPA, but I gotta say, as an extreme hophead, they knocked it outta the veritable park with this baby. It is a great value as well and outperforms more expensive ales in terms of flavor, mouth feel, nose and delecability. I have tried hundreds of ales and this one has just the right balance of flavors for me. The fact that they use three of my very favorite hop varieties (chinook, simcoe and cascade) yields a wonderfully citrusy finish that is intense without overpowering the malty deliciousity ;) If you haven""t tried it and you can get it, get it and try it if you like IPA's at all...Enjoy!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a prickly texture. Overall, this is a brew I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
"O- I find this beer on clearance regularly at my local bottle shop, and I am happy that I do. It is a very good everyday drinking IPA. I prefer it over many IPA's and PA's out there. I am amazed at how bitter this simple IPA can come across on some days, and on other days taste much sweeter. Obviously, my palate is the variable, but it is impressive to me, none-the-less. A solid, relatively-unique look at an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I find this beer very refreshing and enjoyable. I did not notice any overpowering flavors, everything seemed to go down fairly smoothly with two different bitter sensations at the front end and back end. For $2.99 I definitely can not complain, I'd definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I guess not I was not ready for this type of beer, having only expanded out from the mass produced adjunct lagers a short time ago. I guess of you have already tried a lot of beers and know you like pine flavors, this would be awesome, but I am still trying to figure out my palate and this was not appealing to it. I will read more about IPAs in general to find out if this is typical of the style before purchasing another. It was nice to have a beer with flavor. The strong taste would have been awesome had the overwhelming flavor not been a pine cone and grass."
"O- While the Cascade infusion definitely amped up the aroma, the flavor is pretty much just standard Ranger."

"O: A very good IPA with a straight forward balance and a nice blend of citrus, piney and tropical hops flavors."
""
"O-This beer has potential. It is good-looking and has a nice mouthfeel, but the flavors taste hastily put-together. It is as if somebody said, ""We should do a big IPA, but not quite a IIPA!"" and in their excitement, they did not really think through the construction or layering of the flavors. I may give Ranger another try if it lands in my lap, but I will not be looking out for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine IPA that brings out fairly bold hop qualities in the taste and scent. The mouthfeel was a bit watery yet the mild grain sweetness and bold hop flavors and make you quickly forget this minor fault. Excellent smell and flavor balance and should satisfy those looking for a good, hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like many Colorado breweries New Belgium has started selling Ranger in cans so it’s easy to transport for outdoor activities and the cans don’t seem to have any adverse affect on the hop aroma of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - New Belgium rarely get their beer wrong and this is not an exception. Good overall summer beer. Not true to hops IPA but interesting and fun to drink. You can have a few of these and still taste your food which is uncommon in strong, multiple hopped IPAs. Good price and abundant in the brew capital of the world... Colorful Colorado."

"This has the hop and bitter qualities that I want out of an IPA. The grapefruit smell is so inviting, and the taste follows suit. Basically, it's liquid hops, but not overwhelmingly so and only in good ways. I will get this again."
"Pour from the bottle into sam adams pint glass. Very clear deep yellow with a nice white head that sticks around leaving a nice lace. Smell is piney with some fruit and a little honey malt. Nice hoppy taste that leaves a little bitterness on the tounge. Taste a small honey malt but mostly pine grapefruit hops. Feels medium mouthfeel very smooth. Pretty much the same as most ipa but just super soild and just great when looking for a more simple flavorful ipa."

"Overall - i enjoy this beer, I'm a biased IPA fan, but I believe this is underrated. The price and the fact you can get it in both a can and a bottle make this a must try!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts fairly smooth especially considering the style but finishes dry. Not as bitter as one might expect an IPA to be which is fine with this malthead. Overall a nicely done example, somewhere between a typical IPA and an Imperial in drinkability though with the flavor and nose of the standard."
""
""
"Overall - i feel like the hops didnt come through in the flavor as i was expecting them too. looks great, smells, great, but not what I would expect from an IPA, has more of a pale ale feel to it in my opinion. This is not my first time having this beer, but first time reviewing. I seem to remember being a lot more hop forward than malt forward. I may try to pick up another bottle and re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good solid middle of the road IPA. Not subtle, but not too much in your face to be undrinkable. Right in the sweet spot of bitterness. Very drinkable and flavorful."
""
""
"O: Easily drinkable with a nice finish. May be the best value IPA that is widely available. The appearance and scent are average at best so pouring into a glass is not necessary and almost detrimental due to the lackluster appearance. But the taste and body are what you would expect of a solid IPA. This is a great value brew for when you need to pick up a 12 pack for the weekend and an IPA is the only thing that will hit the spot. Nothing special here, but a solid IPA that I would recommend to any beer drinker, not just IPA fans."
""
"M: Drinkable, strongly carbonated. Exactly what you want in an IPA. Top Notch brew. I wish there was more aroma, but hardly any hop aroma!"
""
""
""
""
"O-not something I would chase down but gotta like the big can and if you are in Colorado, sometimes this one is the only IPA on tap. A decent brew for a big can. For the price, a great value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not bad but not great. Worthy of a drink but I wouldn't seek it out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the flavoring. The blend and balance were certainly there, with robustly fresh hoppiness to balance what was an initially basic grain bill. The latter enhanced throughout, taking in more spice, and even some light phenols. This is an easy IPA, and seemed to fit a relaxing evening well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops but while still having very nice hop flavors. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
""
"Ranger IPA quickly fails to fully live up to its textbook appearance and fresh and inviting nose: falling into the realm of a good, but not particularly memorable IPA. It certainly is drinkable, and the fact that it is ubiquitously present in the bargain-basement Folly Variety pack (which I've purchased for as little as $6), ensures that I will continue enjoying this in the future. For under a buck a bottle, the value of this beer is hard to beat."

"Atmosphere is great. Great golden hue, solid foamy head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is a fresh floral hop and sweet experience. Hop is less punchy and more floral, well-combined with plenty of fresh citrus and honey topped off with a dry, bitter finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours clear dark golden with a thick white head and visible streaming bubbles rising from the bottom. The head retreats slowly as it should for an IPA, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. The aroma is of clean grapefruit with some pine. I get some caramel in the nose as well. The flavor follows the smell pretty well. There's some nice bright grapefruit and bitter piney hops in the back. There's also some caramel sweetness from the malt as well as some breadiness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is sticky and the hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. This beer is pleasantly drinkable. This is a very good beer."

"I'm not a huge fan of the hop profile, as it reminds me of some big, burly DIPAs. However, this doesn't have a big, sweet malt profile. So I actually find it charming in an unexpected way. While I'll be less excited to have this again compared to some other New Belgium offerings, I'll definitely drink this again when it's available on the East Coast."

"Add to it that you get three in the latest NB can variety packs and I'm sold."

"Such a shame I was only in the Grand Canyon State for 6 days, as I would have had a few more of these. This was floral enough not to be bold and balanced enough to feel more like a Pale Ale, but the slight buzz that I felt at the end reminded me that this was indeed an IPA. While not the best of its kind that I had, this would be perfect in the Summer when something just a bit stronger than a ""lawnmower beer"" would be called for. Certainly, this would be a great introduction to the style for a neophyte."

"Overall, Ranger is a very standard IPA, as well as an outstanding example of the style. I feel like there was not a lot of experimentation going on in this beer, which is a good thing in the case of Ranger. It also has a very crisp quality to it which makes it an awesome beer on a hot day, and I find it slightly more drinkable than many IPA beers."

"Bought at BevMo in Tacoma. Pour a crystal clear gold with a white head. Pretty skunky fragrance. Taste is balanced but not great. Hard to pinpoint but it just doesn't taste fresh, perhaps it wasn't. Couldn't find a freshness date on the bottle. Will try again soon to see if there is a difference."

"A very good IPA. Orange juice and biscuit aroma. Orange peel flavour leads, touch of caramel in the middle with a bitter, pithy finish. Medium light body. An extremely solid IPA.

Definitely a winning IPA that I recommend for anyone who likes them."

"Bomber pours a slightly roasted golden colour with a mild white head that completely belies the power of its flavour. Hop-forward aroma of resiny ""c hops"" has hints of tropical fruit with a respectable grain base. The flavour is by no means well-balanced, but it is bitter focused and hop-forward in a manner that I fully support. An initial bready sweetness with mango and pineapple elements transitions rapidly to an abject bitter resin, with some grapefruit tones left within a delightfully lingering finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear stray yellow with maybe a bit of burnt orange trying to shine through. One finger eggshell white head. Plenty of wonderful grapefruit hops in the nose with a bit of earthiness and pine in the background, well balanced. Taste is more of the same. Grapefruit hops coat the mouth, and there is a nice malt backbone that supports the hops. Pleasantly surprised by this one. An excellent widely available IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a star. I really like it. At $12.99 for a 12 pack is another point for the beer. Lets face it, most people love craft beer on this site. But how many can afford to pay $10 for a six all the time. It like having a hot chick that knows how to budget a check book. You'll still want to fiddle around with the high priced flavors of the week, but this one will stay in the stable. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is crisp and airy with a few malty bits on the tail, all of which make for a very acceptable session beer. As noted, this is one to keep around."
""
"I have had this beer before and I am surprised to find that I have not rated it as of yet. Trying the Ranger from a holiday pack recently purchased. The beer has a very nice appearance has a light orange clear color with white head that is leaving a lace. The smell and taste have nice fresh hopiness to it. The taste includes a slight Belgium sweet malt twang common of all New Belgium beers. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you like IPAs, its a winner. It tastes great, has some nice alcohol content (makes for a nice session, if you've got nowhere to be the next day), and it's also affordable. I compare most IPAs I try to Ranger."
""
"This poured with a one inch fizzy carbonated head and tons of lacing. The color was orangish, and resembled an apple cider, which was not particularly pretty. The scent was subtle and floral, with stereo-typical hoppiness but what a beautiful scent that is. This tasted of hops with floral notes, duh, but it is so perfect for what I expect in an IPA. If you have had SN IPA than you have had Ranger, and that's high praise."
""

"Pours a clear amber brown with a light white head. It has a subtle floral bop scent, definitely delightful. Mouth feel is medium with the bitterness apparent. Flavor is grapefruity with solid hop. Good bitter hop aftertaste that's just the perfect strength."
""
"This is a nice very drinkable offering. It pours a hazy golden with a 1 finger white head, decent retention, and plenty of lacing. Smell is grass, pine, bread, and maybe some fruit. Mouthfeel is nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad either, about average I guess. Taste is pine and honey followed by citrusy hops. Really a good offering."
""
"I have had this IPA a number of times now and has quickly become my ""new on hand domestic"". It has the initial appearance, mouthfeel and taste of an unoffensive domestic pilsner/lager brewed for ice babes but its IPA character is immediately apparent: a) needles on the tongue; b) sinus full of evergreen and c) sharp aftertaste of...something. I have found a wide audience for it; visitors who claim not to like IPA's love it and I have no trouble running out of it."

"Poured from bottle , nice 1 inch head that held , wonderful lacing ,the smell is hoppy , not grassy or citrusy but just hoppy , the taste is full and what I expect from an American made IPA , over all I will buy this beer again , I love New Belgium beers , so mabye I'm biased due to the fact Im a fanboy for their stuff , but to me this is a really tasty beer"

"Pours a mostly clear amber color with an inch head. The scent is weak but there are faint hints of hops and citrus. Taste is smooth and has a perfect balance of bitterness. This is very nicely blended throughout making this a rather easy drinking IPA. Finishes with a slight crisp after taste. Well done New Belgium as usual!"

"O-A good IPA, the problem is there are soo many good-great ones. Better options are out there but with the expansion this could be an easy to get solid brew."
"Excellent IPA, and a great price. Could drink this all night."
"Overall this ale has what this reviewer has come to love about the west coast version of the ipa style. Colorado may not be on the coast, but the general western usa idea of streamlined and less filling while still utterly delicious is evident here. Spending years chewing down the midwest's drinks, while fabulous to be certain, has made me grow fond of this lighter type of beer and hence I may feel more satisfied than others to whom this brew has been commonplace. New Belgium is new to our market here in Michigan and I am glad that I decided to snag this out of the gas station today as the overrated status of Fat Tire nearly deterred me from finding out what a great little brew this Ranger India Pale Ale is. I will be looking to this in the future!"

"The clear body, pale golden color, and the large head made this an attractive pour to look at. The smell dominated by was citric hops, tropical fruit, and pine. The taste followed right along, with a bitter start, a fruity middle, and a piney finish. Mouthfeel was creamy and on the lighter side of medium. Not much of an aftertaste, and not any stickiness either. This beer was firmly in the West Coast school of clean and dry IPA's, and was quite quenching as a result. I usually prefer a bit more malt character in my IPAs, but this was clearly a quality product."

"Overall I liked this beer and and I thought it was an above average example of the style, it had some really nice aspects to it, but it fell a little short when it got to the taste and mouthfeel. This beer had good drinkability, it went down smooth, was a little refreshing, and the flavors did an ok job at holding my attention, one bomber is enough for me, but if I was really in the mood for an American IPA, I could see drinking two of them. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both really good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was how the taste just couldn't live up to the aroma, the taste wasn't bad by any means, but the hops didn't show up as much as I would have liked. I would buy this beer again when looking for a decent and cheap IPA, but I don't think I will buy it often, I recommend giving this a try to any IPA fan. All in all this beer was nice, it didn't wow me, but I was impressed with some aspects of it and I would call this a pretty solid American IPA, nice work New Belgium a solid beer from a solid Brewery."

"A not too dark, yellow with some red hues, and looking different than many IPA, not so much tannic orange. Didn't pay any attention to the head. Sometimes don't even care. Anyway, nose is fresh pine and some fruit and sweetness. Smells balanced. Taste confirms the balance, a hoppy and distinctive citrus rind, and fruit, and balsam, supported by a nice, but not overdone malt presence. I really like the taste. Bitter notes persist, inviting another drink. Mouth-feel is terrific, carbonation moderate. Great for the price and newly stocked nearby, I'm sure to have another soon."
"O- The best offering that I've had so far from this brewery. It's a drinkable IPA that I'll look forward to having again."

"Pours a mostly-transparent yellow-orange color, with a thick, fluffy head. The aroma features a prototypical Cascade hop profile, with a fragrant combination of pine and some light citrus, which is balanced by a reasonably substantial malty sweetness. The flavor similarly showcases a juicy combination of grapefruit and pine, with only enough underlying sweetness to keep the assertively bitter hop flavors from overwhelming. The texture is pleasantly light yet resinous, which helps this beer go down relatively smoothly, but it is really the bold, varied hop character that makes this beer what it is."

"A great ""go to"" beer. Something worth buying a case of and serving at a party. Nothing too complex but a solid take on the style. Worth having again and again. Also pretty fun to cook with!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a long lasting, white, fluffy head. Aroma is of orange fruit, citrusy hops, biscuit malt, caramel and ripe fruit. Body is full and crisp. Taste is citrusy hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. The finish is long, greapfruity. There are much better IPAs."

"Not a bad IPA, just not one of my favorites. The taste is a little lacking in flavor, in my opinion. It's just a bit one-dimentional. Appearance and smell are just about average, and the taste is mildly hoppy. Not much else to report. I've picked up this beer several times from the grocery store when there aren't many other options, but I'm usually not all that thrilled with it."

"Slightly floral and silky ipa. Leans forward with some perfume tones and fairly clear floral character. Salty pine body seems to dominate the scene. It's got a good consistent profile and an even flavor. I can dig it. As I tend to say with so many other beers: this might be interesting on cask."

"Pours a clear pale amber with nice foamy white head, with good retention. Nice hop aroma, floral and fruity with a nice citrus backing, again it's refreshing not to get hit in the head with a bag of citrus on every IPA. Well bitter as I would expect, with more pine than I noticed in the nose. Floral and citrus and herbal as well. Would like a little more maltiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and puckering, yet decently balanced."
"O: Good stuff. The nose, I think, is an anomaly, and if you can't smell like I can't smell, no problem! Well done, New Belgium."

"O - My wife is a discerning hop head that's fairly picky about her IPAs without coming off too snobby. I don't think she has explored the Ranger yet, but I'm fairly confident she'd really dig this well-balanced yet hop-forward delight because it showcases the hops' citrus and earthy characteristics without bashing you over the head with them. Essentially, Ranger IPA is drinkable and refreshing, something a lot of us want at the core of our beers."

"Pour was clear yellow with a small head. Didnt smell like much. More alpha acids than anything, but not that much. Lots of powdery sweet malt. The taste follows suit. I dont get much fruit, pine, or anything. Lots of powdery sweet malt, with some bittering presence from the hops. I want more flavor, but just nothing sits there."
"Update 5/14:too sweet, would like more of the hop aroma to translate to taste."

"Overall - This is a decent IPA. Nothing to freak out about, a good go-to, sessionable, easily accessible, and well-priced IPA most can enjoy. I likely won't buy it again (just because I don't drink many IPAs) but I would certainly drink it again, albeit faster this time. Good beer overall"
""
"Beautiful tight stark white head that rose about an inch above the glass without falling. Heavy lacing that trailed to the bottom of the glass. Earthy aroma after the pour. Nicely balanced and uncomplicated hop profile. Consistent from the beginning to end and very easily drinkable. A smallish IPA at 6.5% leaves plenty of room for more."

"Nice blend of hops, although they're all similar enough to blend into the same direction after a while. All hops with this one, barely a trace of malt backbone, but it delivers the goods with a very clean character to it."
"The Crack & Glug was flawless and I soon had two fingers of dense, tawny head with fantastic retention. Where did this humidity suddenly come from?!? As it slowly fell, as foam is wont to do, I was left with some generous lacing in its wake. Color was an orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity and I just remembered that I wanted to ask for a Lovibond scale at SAVOR, dang it! Nose was redolent with pine hops and I was happy that it was hoppy. More truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and perhaps I have become jaded in my hophead ways, but this did not seem to be anything out of the ordinary. It was plenty hoppy with a caramel malt backbone evident on the tongue, but I was not aroused as I was with the earlier Shift. It could also be that I had it as a Want for so long that it took on mythic proportions ... I dunno. Finish was super dry and as I think about it, this was a pretty darn good IPA, and in a CAN no less. I'd best take my own advice and kwicherbichen."
""
""
""
""
"O - A well balanced example of an american IPA, I really like the aroma coming from simcoe, cascade and chinook hops. It could be more bitter, but that's just my palate talking, this is a very well crafted ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has the hop profile I love in my IPAs, it does remind me of Fat Head's Head Hunter, Green Flash West Coast IPA, and Stone IPA but with less astringency than those beers. It was also maybe a little overcarbonated, but this one is a winner."
""
""
"Overall: Solid overall, very drinkable with a pretty moderate ABV that won't get you wasted, but will definitely make a mark after a couple."

"After having 2 bottles out of a 6 pack, I'm sure that my first rating of a 4.03 was too low. Aroma on the bottled version I got tropical fruit, pine, resin, a slight sweetness, dry toast. Taste, same things. Reminds me heavily of Columbus IPA, and I love that beer. I'll be buying the hell out of this one if New Belgium comes to Ohio."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light orange color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of citrus and grapefruit hops. Taste is a light grapefruit hop flavor with some citrus peel near the end. Nice amount of bitterness for a beer thats a bit on the light side. This is an easy drinking IPA for sure. Overall, worth buying again for certain."
""

"O: I enjoyed this I had this and lagunitas IPA last night I gave them the ""head to head"" challenge Ranger had them beat in the complexity of flavor and aroma, I only have one problem with this beer and that would be the after taste it had so much fruit and spice that the flat metallic bitter finish was to me disappointment."

"Verdict: Solid IPA from New Belgium and of the best value IPAs on the market. This made from great drinking on my camping trip, and great drinking when I got home. It's not going to redefine the style or even stand out amongst the giants, but it's going to satisfy you every time."
"Overall (4.0): This is a really solid IPA, in my opinion. Would have liked to review a fresher bottle, but this is still damn good and hey—it is before the freshness date, so by that marker New Belgium did a very good job here. I love Ranger, I just wish I could get it in NY! I’d want cans in my fridge all the time . . . someday."
""

"Overall, this beer kicks ASS! Might be the most sessionable IPA I've ever had to be honest. But, the reason it's so sessionable may be because it's more like a hopped up Pale Ale than an IPA. More bitterness and body would make this an INCREDIBLE IPA! So sad they don't sell this where I live because I would buy this all the time. One of the best beers I've ever had out of a can next to Dale's Pale Ale."

"Served many times in bottle and draft, this is reviewed from a draft pour at Gusano's in 3/13. Poured into a standard large shaker. It's a burnished brass color with excellent light penetration and great clarity. Pillowed with lots of pure white head and sticky lacing all over the glass. It's an overall very fine looking beer. The nose is a bouquet of hops, full of pine and citrus oil that's a good smell for a good IPA. Malt is very subdued overall. The taste is very indicative of the nose as well. It has strong bittering without being overly harsh, very much like orange rind and smacking with some citrus fruit juice as well. Bittering is well done and finishes strong. Full mouthfeel with good carbonation overall. I think this beer is a very quality representation of a good IPA. It's a good standard of the style and does well what it sets out to do."
""
""
"This is a re-review from a Ranger that I had about 6 months ago. IMO, it was outdated and the liquor store which I had purchased it still decided to sell it, giving my first review a rather unpleasant overall score. This time around its a different ball park. Rich in flavor, aroma, and has a lot to offer for the hop heads. Enjoy this one, because I sure as hell did."
"Good Job!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yum. That's good. Nice piney hop punch and a good backbone of toffee malt on the backend. Some orange in there as well. Can taste the hop oils coating my tongue. Quite a refreshing beer actually. I've had this one before but for some reason did not come back to it. No reason why as it's a pretty solid IPA. The 6.5 is perfectly hidden."
"Over all it favors Redhook's Longhammer, which is my gold standard to compare IPAs, but is just different enough to make it something besides a clone. The flavor is a little bit sweeter from a more malty presence, but the malt doesn't clash with the hops. I regret taht I've put off buying this one before now."
""
""

"This is probably my favorite New Belgium beer. A solid IPA all around."
"Overall: A solid American IPA. Hop forward but not overly bitter. Well balanced by the malts."

"...okay so its not THAT interesting. But the flavors agree with me, its almost drinks like a DIPA or AIPA in some respects. I wasn't expecting it to be this strong or smooth. Its highly drinkable and a solid IPA. If you like IPA's, definitely worth a try."

"Bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. Pours a super clear yellow orange. An inch of foamy white head shrinks to cover the top with decent lacing. Aroma is citrus, and mild tropical fruit. Flavor is mild pine, grapefruit, and has a refreshing citrus quality. A somewhat bready malt blends it well. Mouthfeel is thin and a bit sticky. This is a good every day ipa that would be a nice lawn mower beer."
""
"On tap at the brewery...and the Denver airport, and pretty much everywhere I went in Colorado. A solid IPA. Layered and complex hop flavors. Pine, orange, lime, and thyme. Clean, dry malt, a bit of candy-like sweetness. Perhaps slightly undervalued by the beer community since it's not exploding with hops, but it's extremely well crafted, balanced, and flavorful."

Nice job New Belgium and I’ll definitely be picking up more of these up next time I’m next time I’m in the mood for some canned Craft."

Very impressed that this IPA is as good as it is being 'mass produced' by the ever growing New Belgium. Highly recommended."
"This is really a very good IPA. It sells for less than most but that does not mean it is less good. In fact, the cost to taste ratio pushes it close to the top of my list. True talent is demonstrated in producing a great beer in great quantity with great consistency for a decent price! When I feel like my budget is a little tight I stick with Ranger and live a hoppy life!"

"Pretty good standard IPA. Nice hop juice notes and some good malt backbone."
"Bottle. transparent corporate apple juice appearance with a slightly off-white, yet very frothy and lace-inducing set of suds atop. Nose had sweetness underneath and tropical fruit hop notes on top peaking to an almost fresh hop bud smell followed by more sweetness taking over the fruity notes. Flavors reiterate the tropical fruits in the nose spitting forth waves of pineapple, passion fruit, unripe mango, maybe some guava. Overall its on the dry side of sweet..does that make sense? Who cares. Lots of fruity notes, as I’ve said..with dry yet soft bitterness over a nuetral foundation of sweetness. In any event, its clean and fruit, and accents the fruity hop notes, backs them with adequate sweetness, tingles the senses with a burst of dry bitterness...and ends soft and gentle, yet evident.."
""
"Pours a lager-clear golden copper. No head, but that's likely because the waitress filled the pint glass to the top--I love America. Bouquet is a grapefruit-pine cone-confectioner's sugar purée. Prevalent pine flavor that is less vibrant than the bouquet. Mouthfeel is pillowy for an IPA. Smoother finish than I'm used to with this type of IPA. Very good, drinkable IPA."

"This is not a hop-bomb that attacks your palate, and the bready malts actually play a big part throughout the flavor and make it extremely drinkable as well as hiding the ABV quite well.

"D - a pretty good beer overall. I'd have it again."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a small white head that left a lot of lacing. Very hoppy aroma with pine, citrus, sweet malt, slightly floral and earthy. Flavor has a very strong hoppy bitter leaf bite up front that fades to a mild orange, strong pine and mild caramel malt middle finishing with a pronounced doughy/biscuit ending. Body was modest."

"O- A quality, everyday IPA. Great hop profile in both the aroma and taste. The beer is well balanced to prevent it from going to far in one direction. For an IPA so readily available, this is pretty solid. Worth picking up a sixer of."
""
"On tap. Pours a clear light amber with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is pine and dank hops, some light caramel, sugar cookie, and a lot of butterscotch. Quite nasty. The taste is sweet with piney and dank hops, caramel, and tons of butterscotch and buttered popcorn. Nasty butterscotch finish with a light bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. This is one of the worst beers I've had. I only had a couple ounces of it. I'm assuming it was a bad batch, but I won't be ordering it again."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not in the same category as the top IPA's but still a very good beer."
""
"Overall, this is a great IPA that has wide availability and is priced good. It's a staple that I would always feel comfortable going back to."
""
"A nice orange pour, dumping pine and hop scent all over the place. More malt behind the hops than I expected, but that's not a bad thing this time around. Really crispy and tight with a dry backbone to it. It's a super popular brew around here and relatively easy to come by in a pinch. Well priced but not well traveled. I'm happy to know I have this as an option at all times."
"O: Having drank Ranger multiple times on tap and bottle, NBB has once again brewed a solid, drinkable brew. Nothing fancy here, just a straight forward IPA that's very sessionable! After comparing tap and bottle, tap is better, but both are outstanding. Nice job NBB!"
""
"O: this beer has grown on me a lot. A staple for me."

"O - One of my go-to IPAs, especially when it's this fresh. Just a great, unpretentious year-round brew!"
"O- A great all round American IPA for hop heads after some fresh piney hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pretty decent IPA as it had a lot of balance and it wasn't overly piney or one-noted. Although, my preference in IPAs is more citrusy and while this did have some, I like when it's more profound."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, best by 3/11/12. Beautiful hop bitterness throughout, piney, resinous, grassy. Easy to drink, alcohol masked by floral hop aromas and grapefruit. Moderate malt backbone, nicely balanced but leaning toward hops. Tongue coating and delicious. Can't wait to get these in Florida..."
""
""
""
""
"In summary, I think this is an affordable and great-tasting beer for a hop enthusiast. If you do not like bitter and floral, leave this one on the shelf."
""
""
""
"HOP-HEAD ALERT!"
"Overall: Not the best IPA on the market but this one is widely available and usually fresh when other IPAs aren't in the places I visit so it is a go to. Nothing to go out of your way for but if you are pressed for selection you can't go wrong here."

"overall: Not necessarily a personal favorite of mine but it’s certainly well-made, tasty, and somewhat unique. There’s something a little different about the hop profile of this one I found interesting if not completely delicious. Definitely worth trying."

""
""
"overall, its a good ipa. not my favorite by any means, but it aint too shabby."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The body and nose on this are pretty nice and enjoyable, but the flavors fall a little short. Rather than extracting the rich, juicy flavor of the hops, New Belgium brings a bitterness that is not faithful to the nose. For $4, I can't say this is disappointing, but I wish the bitterness was toned down a bit in favor of the taste."
""

"O – A solid representation of the style from New Belgium Brewing, and I really enjoyed it. Nothing spectacular, but no real flaws either. The mouthfeel of this one bears mentioning again, as it’s superb. I’ll probably be getting this again when I want a smooth drinking IPA with some mild hop zing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bring it!"
""
"O- If you are a hop head, this is your beer. For me it's a little to bitter for my taste. Not digging the bitter finish."
""
"This is a nice, mild IPA. there's a caramel sweetness in there. A touch of lemon. There isn't much of a bitter bite that you might like out of an IPA. Not floral, either. It's good and refreshing, but the flavor is very tame. Drinks lots, but nothing jumps out."
"D - Lots of hop flavor packed into this 6.5% ABV single IPA... I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting... I would never turn down an opportunity to indulge in this in the future... Not the best American IPA by any means, but more than solid with lots of appeal..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Good drinkability...a nice session beer. Good fresh and sharp hops make this refreshing. Wish it had a bit more of a malt balance."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very easy drinking. Lots of flavor, but a great balance overall. Could definitely see this as a staple in the fridge...if distribution weren't a factor."
""
""
"Poured a clear golden yellow, with a finger or so of white head. Pretty thick lacing, and moderate retention. Nose is nicely hopped, some orange and grapefruit, with a bit of dankness and grass. A light spicy hop note as well, accenting a lightly sweet malt character. Taste has more of the same idea, quite bitter with grassy and herbal notes, a hint of the spicy hop note and more orange and citrus. Very light malt character again, some light grain and cracker in that respect. Long bitter finish, a bit of a palate zapper. Medium carbonation, fairly light medium body. A good hop assault."
""
"I should note that I followed Ranger with Hoptober, a Golden Ale by New Belgium with decent hop flavours. The Hoptober blew Ranger out of the water both in hop complexity and balancing with malt flavours. A better go to for me."

"Overall: Not a big fan. Too much pine going on here, as I mentioned before. I don't think I will have another. I hope the amber and the Snow Day are better beers as I wasn't a fan of this one or the Trippel (due to the overwhelming coriander taste, but that's for another review)."
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, a touch of citrus. Taste is piney hops up front, light citrus notes, a mild malt balance. Feels medium bodied in the mouth ansd overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"I edited to give this beer some mouthfeel points...cause I had no idea there be 6.5 ponies per beer! Hidden very well! Ahhh...I'm starting to see where the love was...hidden like an Army Ranger in a Ghille suit...GOT YA NB!"
"O- Everything I want in an IPA.  Well balanced, flavorful, very drinkable. Hopefully New Belgium's east coast expansion means we'll be seeing this in FL in the near future."

"O: The beer is very well balanced. It has a good amount of hop flavors but isn't overly bitter and is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Bought a bomber of this for $2.99. IPA's are my favorite style by far, but this one was a bit out of balance for me. Great hoppiness to it and bitter to the max, but it's almost too much and doesn't make for a smooth finish. It's definitely good for a hop fix, but it becomes difficult to even drink without the malts to back it up. Good deal, and pretty good IPA.. but if it was balanced this could be a really good one."
""
"Bought a ""Folly Pack"" of 4 different New Belgium beers from Meijer's for about 12 dollars A very drinkable, sessionable IPA. Unobtrusive, crisp and easy to drink, but with good solid hop flavor and follow through. Very hoppy smell. Sharp and aromatic. Good stuff."
"Overall: Well, I enjoyed this beer out in Denver last week and happy it made it back here to Boston in my suitcase. Will be requesting some friends to bring home some bottles of this if they are passing through. A very well balanced and easy drinking IPA."

"Thanks to Rutager for an awesome extra!"
"Conclusion: There are so many IPAs out there it really takes something special to impress me. I find it a generic style and one that takes very little creativity to brew in such a way that people will like it. This offering however is a notch above many others that I have tasted. I wonder how it doesn't have a solid 'A' on this site. Oh well, in my book it is one of the very best around."

"Appearance is gold in color and clear.Smell is sweet hoppy. Mouthfeel is bitter on tongue and dry to the mouth, nice. Taste is sweet to the mouth and dry; this is a very nice tasting IPA. Good clean finsh. Overall this is a real impressive beer one we feel will only get better as we will have to have one more. Will go great with ribs or just a good old T-Bone."
"O -- Overall, this is a good, every day drinker for anyone craving some hop character without wanting to get hit over the head. It's hoppier than most Pale Ales, but definitely not one to scare away the meek. In a league with Red Hook and Goose Island, this IPA flies under the radar, but brings the right character to the table."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just okay. Not a bad IPA, not a great one either. I generally really like IPAs so I am going to always score them a little higher. This one was just missing some of the nice piney, citrusy bite that I really like in a good IPA. Since I am not partial to this brewery, I don't think I will have this one again anytime soon."

"I like Ranger... it has been my new go to beer. Very drinkable, great with BBQ... and I BBQ a whole lot. I have had Ranger on tap, from a bottle, but my favorite was the 16 oz can. I found those in Chicago, have not been able to find the tall cans here in Maryland..."

"Nice aroma on this one. Good sweet citrus notes. Lemon, grapefruit and a bit of pleasant peach. Not an acidic citrus aroma, but a more mellow, sweet sugary one. The flavor follows. A really good mellow citrus flavor, not dull by any means, but well put together. Sugary grapefruit juice, without the bite or strength of fresh grapefruit leads the hop profile. Lemon juice flavor follows. A solid caramel malt is next before a more bitter, pine finish. Nicely done, not huge flavor, but tasty... very drinkable IPA."
""
"22 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, pale golden bronze with a nice fluffy white one finger head. Couldn't really put my finger on the faint sweet aroma. The tastes of grassy herbal hops with a citrusy tang give way to a faint malty finish. Not very bitter as far as IPAs go. Carbonation is nearly perfect with a sticky sweet aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of this beer. New Belgium doesn't always impress me, but this was a solid IPA that didn't pull any hop punches. The price is good with this and the quality is higher than that value suggests."

"Overall a good IPA, not exactly what a hophead is looking for, but I liked it just fine. $14.99 for a 12 pack, I can see this as a staple. Can't beat the value."
""
"O-I'd buy it again."
"Overall this is a very mild IPA. The hop profile just wasn't as pronounced as I was hoping for. I experienced a similar palate with the New Belgium Hoptober this year. It was an ok brew. I think they may have been shooting for drinkability just like the Fat Tire and Hoptober. Probably won’t seek this out again, but it was enjoyable."
"The palate opens with a moderate grapefruit pith bitterness, and a mild pine-like bitterness, as well. There's plenty of flavor too, including some citrus and some tropical fruit. There isn't much malt presence here, with a touch of toast. The freshness keeps the hops bright and vibrant. There's a mild resin character as well. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer is fairly light in body and is moderately carbonated. The mid-palate is just a touch watery, though. All told, this is a surprisingly good IPA, and this fresh, it's awfully enjoyable."
"O - I'm excited that this is widely available since it is certainly a quality IPA that really hits the spot."
"O- Good IPA. One of my least favorite kinds of beer, but this one has few of the problems I dislike about the type, namely it isn't over bitter."
"Overall, I was not impressed with this as far as IPA's go. I like it when the taste has some complexity rather than being the same throughout."
"I give it points for being my gateway IPA, and it's easy to take its carefully balanced complexion for granted."
"O- A nice beer worth trying. I will probably get it again, but would not buy it all the time. I really feel that there is not anything bad about the beer, just wish the smell and taste were stronger."
"I couldn't wait to have this on tap since my last. Its as good as I remember."
"Definitely worth having again, if you want an easy-drinking IPA."
"O - This is not a bad IPA overall, and is very drinkable. It did not seem as hop forward as other west coast IPA's, but the lacing and head was very impressive. I will try this brew again sometime, though it's not a go-to IPA for me."
"O: Very good beer. This is worth having."
"12 oz bottle poured in to Sam Adams glass. Pours a nice 2 finger head with good lacing. Intense floral citrus aroma. Tastes more flowery than citrus or pine but very interesting hop balance. Rather wet finish but oily resinous aftertaste. Has this gotten better over the years? A very solid and sessionable basic IPA."
"Ranger is an okay IPA. It’s not great by any stretch. I’m not a fan of the toasted malt flavor. Just doesn’t mesh well with the hop flavor in my opinion. There are tons of better IPAs out there. This one’s okay. It’s maybe worth a try. Stick with the single bottle if you can."
"Dark golden yellow in color with a reddish hue. Poured with a brief soapy white foam that reduced to a healthy cap that leaves sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Amazing hop aroma. Intense, pungent grapefruit and herbal hop aroma with a solid sweet maltiness beneath. Smooth oily feel. Carbonation is a bit understated. Tart grapefruit flavor is prominent with herbal hop flavors and a sweet malty backbone. Finishes semi-dry with pungent, spicy herbal aftertaste. Reminds me a bit of Victory Hop Devil."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck-style bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Pilsener glass."
"O - Good beer at a great price."
"All in all, this is a decent IPA and a good one for its price point."
"The mouth is crisp and full. Alcohol fills in the gaps. Big smack in the mouth bitterness right away. Sharp slightly scalding bitter burn. Sweet orange and melon on the back end, but it fleets away as the bitter aftertaste takes over. This is much more bitter than I remember from the bottle. A good IPA that will cure my ""bitter"" fix any day."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a golden amber color with lots of rising carbonation and one finger of yellowish head. The retention was impressive and the lacing in thick bands. The aroma was a pleasant blend of citrusy hops, resin, sweet malt and hints of tropical fruit. The flavors were more bitter than the aroma suggested but this is not a bad thing in an IPA. I tasted grapefruit, pine, caramel malt, orange peel and a hint of earthiness from the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation light."
"Overall- This is by all accounts, a well balanced IPA that lets the floral and herbal notes really ride the wave, while providing a citrus and biscuit malt background. The mouth feel is decent, but could go down smoother. And it really looks the part, so many rings of lace in my empty glass. Definitely give this one your time."
"Pours clear under admittedly bad lighting. Not my first time drinking the Ranger so why haven’t I reviewed it under better lights? This has a wonderful hop profile that’s floral and piney with neither one dominating. I pick up citrus and pine in tandem, delicate and sweet on the palate. Light, refreshing, and so delicious."
"Very drinkable and gets the job done with little drama or flair."
"D - Very good beer; could be an IPA staple in my fridge; nice, soft balance of malt flavors and hops, makes for a pleasure experience"
"Mehhh... why bother to make a beer like this New Belgium? Fat tire is fine for what it is, and I don't require a hoppy version of the beer. I just don't get it."
"Medium body easy to drink American IPA! The New Belgium Brewery makes an IPA that I can find in most supermarkets. Something I can count on. The price is not bad compared to most craft brews; $8.99 for a six pack is good these days."
"not your stereotypical ipa. this one has more of that belgian vibe to it, not as sturdy as some of the american versions. its delicacy lends itself nicely to the hops here, allowing them to be tasted in their entirety without a lot of interference from other elements. not as yeast driven as their belgo, this one doesnt satisfy all of the conditions of an ipa for me, but under any other name it is an excellent beer. the 6.5 percent can catch you unaware as well!"
"I am duly impressed by this beer. I got it on a whim in the warm beer on a Walmart shelf. The flavor is great. Tangy is the best thing that comes to my mind. My wife says ""tastes like grapefruit juice"". It is a good beer. I can;t argue with it especially since it is not very costly compared to other IPAs I've recently tried. I think beers like this among many others are starting to convince me I'ma big fan of IPAs."
"smell is hoppy with wonderful taste . for my first try at a beer from the people at new belgian i enjoyed it alot."
"Overall: This is one of new belgiums best offerings. The aroma and taste are excellent and match up well."
"It has a peppery feel/taste which stayed around longer than I would have liked it too."
"O: a nice brew, smooth and very drinkable, a well rounded brew quite happy with this one"
"(Rating confirmed July 2014 with 12 oz can)"
"MF- Medium bodied, dry, and pretty carbonated."
"A very good IPA. Definitely kinder than most ones that I've had before. Not as bitter as a 60 Minute and no boozy notes, I can definitely see drinking this on a constant basis. I only wish that I could get in MA and not have to import it from VA."
"Overall: A very pleasant IPA, I can see why it is such a popular beer for the style. It has all of the key characteristics of an IPA, just less bold than most. To some, this may not be a good trait, but I would disagree. While this is by no means something to put in your all time greats list, it is a very drinkable version of a kind of beer that prides itself on being slow drinking. It is the intro to IPA."
"Definitely not the best IPA that I have ever had, but I will definitely buy it again. It's also pretty impressive considering this is not the""flagship"" beer of this brewer. I highly recommend trying this beer It is a great example of this style and not too steep of a price. Just remember to not drink it ice cold, because it gets better flavor after a few minutes of being out of the fridge."
"Drink- I don't normally keep six packs in the house but I've kept a couple of these lately. Forgot how easy drinking and subtle and nuanced this one can be."
"O: This is very solid. Bold without being over the top; I enjoyed it."
"Overall: This beer could be amazing if the taste was a bit less bitter and better reflected the nose, and if the carbonation was turned down a 1/2 notch or so."
"Overall I really enjoyed this in-expensive off the shelf IPA. There is a date on the bottle that says 09JUL10. I have a real hard time believing this is a year and a third old but if it is, I would love to try this one fresh. Not at all the best IPA out there but for the price and the availability not a bad choice."
"O: Good IPA."
"O: This is a good IPA and a bargain too."
"O: I am a fan of this IPA. I have never really understood why so many people pick IPAs above any other style of beer, but this is a well balanced, drinkable beer. It won't amaze you, blow your socks off or give you something new and exciting, but it's certainly a solid offering from New Belgium."
"overall nice, pretty bitter, bright hops, light malts to balance, almost juicy."
"Crisp, light, refreshing, moderately low carbonation, very easy to drink. The finishing feel though is not that great. A chalky dryness comes through."
"O: Easy to drink, nice and hoppy, always seems to be on tap at bars that aren't craft bars ""we have bud light, stella, shock top, and something called Ranger"""
"Overall, Ranger is a good median IPA. Well defined and holds its own.. In my opinion a good starter/median IPA for someone first embracing the style."
"O- A solid IPA, and at the price, it's a good purchase."
"O: B+"
"I first tried Ranger when it premiered, and it may be that my palate has developed substantially since then, but this isn’t as bright as I remember. Drinkable enough, but nothing more exciting than your average large-brewery workhorse IPA."
"A fairly standard but good and thrifty bomber bottle of American style IPA."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, nice kick, good representation of style. This is a nice IPA to sit with for a while."
"Very drinkable and a bit in your face. Restrained balance. Hop charter does not mess around and gets right to work with a onslaught of bitterness and flavor."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a fluffy white head with good retention and lacing properties. Aromas are predominantly of citrusy hops and caramel malts, good but not very interesting as far as IPAs are go. Flavors are more complex, with zesty and pine-like notes intermingling with sweeter caramel flavors before giving way to an orange peel taste on the finish. Medium to full body feels extremely smooth. This is a terrific IPA."
"Nice IPA."
"Overall: A damn fine IPA and another win, in my opinion, for New Belgium. I've only ever seen this beer in bombers around here, so it'll be a ""treat"" beer for me when I need a good go-to IPA."
"o - Overall a decent beer, but pretty average. Some nice pine hops in the nose, but not a lot of hops in the taste. Probably wouldn't seek it out again, but worth trying once."
"awesome hop flavor and a good aroma. Great balance and a really nice ipa."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky. It's well carbonated and highly drinkable. Overall, a well rounded and balanced IPA. I'm pretty impressed."
"This is an amazing IPA."
"Overall this is a very solid IPA. I can get a 6 pack for around 7 dollars and it never truly gets old."
"Pours from a bottle into a pilsner glass a hazy orange with a thick, frothy lasting head, with a faint but pleasant odor of bitterness and hints of fruit. Understated hoppy flavor with undertones of grapefruit and pine; thin and light in the mouth with a slightly bitter, carbonated finish. Overall good and easy to drink."
"This was poured way too cold but it had a nice 2 finger head that lines the dirty pub glass and retains well. The color is light orange. Smell is made up of faint hops, fruits and pines. Good smelling beer. Taste is really nice. Citrus fruits and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is sessional IPA. Great tasting with a favorable ABV."
"D/O: Rather drinkable and somewhat repeatable. This was a fine IPA, but nothing spectacular."
"O- Another great IPA. Well balanced and refreshing, not overly bitter. NB did a fine job."
"Very nicely composed IPA, very drinkable, and I certainly will have it again."
"Solid on all points. Bright carbonation with a quick, sharp hops bittering right up front - citric and piney, with a malt profile that recognizes its job is to carry the hops and not get in the way. Bittering level is well balanced - assertive but not overpowering."
"Poured bright gold with a thick off-white head that lasted and lasted. Great lacing. Smell was all hops, citrusy and predominately piney. I really felt that while the hop profile of this beer was impressive, the malt side of it could have been upped to bring an overall better balance, although I'm not sure if that would cross too far the boundaries of what the style embodies (if so, my apologies). I loved the smoothness of the mouthfeel, really was expecting a dryer texture."
"Pours clear ""Kool-Aid"" orange. With a thick off white head that clung very well. Smells of pine and lemon peel. Smell is fresh even though its 21 days past expiration. Taste is semi dry with a nice bitter linger that lasts enough but not as much as some of the Pacific North West versions. Hardly any malt in keeping with the style. Solid, but I would put it right the middle (I've had better, I've had worse). I will say I'd like to try a super fresh batch for comparison. I wouldn't turn one down... but if I'm buying and one of my favorites is available I might pass it by. Worth trying."
"O- Colorado sure can crank out some good IPA's. Can't say I'd seek this out, but certainly on the better side of IPA's I've tried."
"Poured a huge head w/ sticky lace patches on a clear, reddish/orangey body. Very earthy, citric hop aroma and hints of caramel and breadiness there as well. While hoppy, really hoppy for just a ""single"" IPA, the hops are citrusy and earthy but not overpowering as this beer goes down smooth. Nice balance as well b/c I also pick up some caramel sweetness as well as touches of grape/tropical fruit. Finishing w/ a slightly dry edge, I find this beer to be a quality sipper and one that a hop lover and just a beer lover would enjoy."
"Big thanks to my boss for saving me a bottle of this and giving me one to try. This poured out as a light colored orangy yellow, the head was white and had a decent retention. The lacing wasn't too sticky though. The smell of the beer packs a nice little punch for just being a regular IPA. Plenty of citrusy pine aromas pouring out of this one. The taste is really nice on this brew, lots of really piney notes on the tongue, very flavorful IPA. The mouthfeel of the beer is slightly creamy but still quite prickly feeling from the hops and carbonation. Overall this is a highly enjoyable IPA, would be able to drink this one over and over."
"Had this one on tap at the Carolina Ale House in Fayetteville NC. Tastes better than I remember if from the bottle. Nice light copper color with a decent size whit head. Good retention and plentiful lacing. Smell is robust floral and citrus hops. Taste is primarily citrus hops with some balancing malt. Mouthfeel is better in the draft version. Crisp and rich enough. Good hops bitterness. Overall the drft version is even better than I remember the bottle version. Good IPA."
"O: This is a pretty good IPA. The taste is fresher and cleaner than many and IPA's I have had and it is more straightforward. The specific hops seem easier to pick out. Pretty good stuff."
"O- Solid offering from NB that is well priced. There are a lot of better options on the market, but then again, there are a lot of worse options as well."
"Overall the price is too much for this beer and not made for drinking in a maryland summer heat. more a ski mountain beer. I would not buy this again unless I was hard up for hops."
"Very well balanced between hops and malts. The hops are bold and bitter, but also citrusy and sweet at the same time. Juicy grapefruit comes to mind in taste and mouthfeel. A good and balancing amount of biscuity malt is present and really makes the beer stand out. Sometimes I find that too much of a biscuit malt is overpowering in IPAs, but not the case here. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is very dry and it finishes crisp and relatively clean. A little grit in back that only furthers the experience. Alcohol is hidden very well and it only registers as an afterthought. Really just a well done beer, but make sure its fresh or that biscuit malt may take over the character. The hops in this are not to be missed."
"Ranger made a good first impression, with a sharp appearance and an explosion of citrus; however, both faded and it closed out as bland, bready, and metallic."
"Overall a very nice IPA that I will use as a regular fridge stocker at $3/22oz."
"Overall: A great beer. This has reached my top 10 without a doubt."
"In a style teeming with amazing brews, this one falls a bit short for me. I am enjoying this, but don't see myself returning to this beer too often, if at all."
"Good stuff. I'll be having more of this."
"This stuff was born for the beach. A nice interpretation -- albeit gossamer and fleeting -- of an IPA. Bigger is not always better, my friends. Who knew New Belgium was up to it?"
"Pours clear orange to golden with thick, foamy white head. The aroma is very hoppy - lots of floral, planty notes along with grapefruit and tropical fruit. Flavor is a bit more mildly hoppy. Still plenty of citrus and floral notes but some caramel malt comes through as well. Well-balanced, not too strong for an IPA, but the mouthfeel is a tad on the light or watery side."
"O - This is a fantastic beer, especially for something you can buy easily at a local grocery(at least here in San Diego). The hops are really well balanced in the beer and the lend to a great IPA experience, and I think it would satisfy a lot of non-IPA fans who aren't used to the huge bodied beers available in the same genre. Maybe this will become the gateway IPA, haha."
"I'm not sure what keeps this beer from top marks. I guess it's the idea that anything can be improved, and nothing can ever be perfect. I count myself blessed that I can find this on tap or in bottles any time I want here in Denver. I don't know (or haven't yet had) what makes for a perfect score for the american IPA style, but after a tough day, this is exactly what I want to wind down. Of the huge variety of beers available in Denver, I seem to have bought this one more than any other."
"Solid IPA all around, certainly worth trying if you haven't."
"Overall an excellent ipa. NB's Ranger IPA is one of my new favorites, I'm definitely going back for more."
"Overall if I can't get my hands on some Gumball Head I would definitely choose this for an IPA."
"but overall I love this beer and this may well be my new fav IPA."
"D: This is an enjoyable IPA. It's a fairly blank slate for the hops to do their work, but I enjoy this particular hop bill because it provides a nice array of complementary flavors. This isn't a top-tier IPA, but it's not far off. A slightly more interesting malt and/or yeast presence would go a long way for this beer."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. This was the first IPA I bought upon arriving in Southern California. Remains one of my favorite readily available IPAs."
"Pours a nice amber/gold color w/ a one finger off white head. Decent carbonation and good lacing. Beer is fairly clear, but somewhat hazy. Nose is that of mango, grapefruit, hops, and earthy funky-ness. Slight malt in the background. Taste is a little better. Hops are king in the taste, and the funkiness evident in the nose is completely gone in the taste. Very hoppy, dry aftertaste, w/ medium body. Ok.. I lied. Slight earthy funkiness evident in the aftertaste as the beer warms up. Decent malt backbone as well, although I'd like more malt in the taste. Not a bad IPA, but not my favorite in the style. Still, I'm glad I tried it, and glad New Belgium has come to DC! Love to try this one on draft at some point."
"O. This is a pretty decent IPA that does the job in most any situation. This is not a backup beer. It sits pretty close to the front for me. I still like my Stone, but this one rocks."
"O: I remember this beer being good, but not this good. Perhaps it's because I've been away from it for a bit...."
"82."
"This is an easy-drinking IPA which I assume, since it was served at a work function, is also a less expensive option. I could easily enjoy 3 or 4 of these or more at a barbecue or day at the beach, this is a good beer when you really don't want to think about your beer but just want something light and refreshing. But I don't know that I'd go out of my way to have it again when so many superior IPAs are readily available."
"Notes: Part of the distribution launch of New Belgium in the region… And these bombers sure seem to come fresh and full of character. I´ve had Ranger before, and while likable, I did not remember it this enjoyable. Initially I would have preferred to have six-packs available instead, but the price-quality ratio of the big bottle is spectacular."
"Overall decent ipa, different, unique, enjoyable."
"Very enjoyable, and excellent example of the style. Offers a nice hop profile that is different from the usual east coast offerings I'm used to. So glad I can buy it locally now!"
"Ranger doesn't get tons of love on BA but I found it to be a clean, easy to drink IPA. It's not amazing, but I can find little to critique about it. Also, I love the simple, stylized label."
"Beer is medium body and mildly sweet with a great hop profile, the hops are mostly pine on the palate, the finish isn't dry, the beer is super drinkable. I really like this beer, exactly what I wanted tonight."
"D: a very good AIPA in my opinion. rich american hop flavor that is well balanced with a toasty backbone. glad new belgium is in VA!"
"D: Defiantly easy to drink, and at 6.5%, it's completely smooth. I was shocked how good this is."
"Dr: The quality - or relative lack thereof - makes it difficult to drink. The price isn't that great especially as part of a variety pack. I won't be having it again. A relatively high ABV."
"This remains one of my go-to easy to find solid IPAs, this is just the first time I've had it in a can."
"An excellent session beer, packed with juicy hops that make it hard not to reach for one after the other."
"Not a bad IPA. It's affordable so I tend to go back to it over and over."
"It's quite a hoppy IPA and very nice for a brewery that is used to underwhelming. Bravo, New Belgium. Bravo."
"O - Wow, what a great beer. I really like this. Not sure if I can get it in Ohio, but maybe soon. Solid straightforward west coast style IPA."
"Overall Impression: I was looking for something hoppy and bold and definitely found it with this Ranger IPA. I really enjoyed the fresh, crisp and somewhat complex hoppy flavors, mixing the piney-resin and citrus hop flavors. While it easily leaned toward the hoppy side of the scale, there was a good caramel flavor malt backbone to it as well. Overall, I thought this was a good hoppy beer, and its pretty widely available, so it might be an easy one to find the next time I have a big hoppy beer craving."
"O- Its drinkable, however if you are a hop head, or IPA fanatic, then your search is still on. There are better IPAs; I would consider this one a middle of the road brew."
"O- A solid IPA, very drinkable and flavorful, this beer would go well with just about anything."
"A solid everyday IPA from New Belgium. If they distributed to MA I would probably pick some up now and again."
"D: This was a solid IPA, with simple but nice scent, and nice hoppy taste, and good body. It had a nice finish too, so it was very easy to drink. Nothing special, but a strong example of the style. A good session IPA."
"O: One of the better offerings from New Belgium, I have had. A serviceable if unremarkable IPA."
"O: I would really like to try this a week old. Not the best IPA by far at this stage."
"O - Decent IPA, not too bold, not too bitter, nice hoppy aromas, good balance, nice dry finish, w/ a slightly bread malt backbone. I'll have it again, and could easily have another right now."
"O: I wish this one was available in FL as I would drink it regularly."
"Over all i'd drink again especially for the value of a twelve pack at my local grocery."
"O: A great IPA. Don't believe I've every been let down by New Belgium. Definitely could become a go to IPA being how easy it is to come by."
"This is one of my very favorite IPAs, mostly because it is so citrusy and refreashing."
"Happy IPA day my BA friends"
"Well done! Cheers"
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"M & O: It has a medium light mouthfeel. Nice carbonation, it's sharp and ends wet. It's nicely drinkable. Nothing spectacular, but good."
"M: very crisp and refreshing and smooth. I enjoy this as a go to beer for the quality and price"
"Overall this beer is amazing. A great example of an American IPA. Could throw this one back all day."
"The mouthfeel is thin compared to most others in the style. While this is a drawback it actually plays nicely when drinking straight from the can while camping. Overall this is middle of the road for a stacked category."
"O- A solid IPA, and for the price, availability, and quick turnover, ensuring some degree of freshness, this is a go to IPA in the Nashville market for me."
"Bought on a weekend trip to NC. Poured from a dark brown bottle a orangeish amber color with a frothy rocky pure white head. Smell was fantastic plenty of floral and citrus hops in the nose with a sweet candy malt smell. Taste was smooth and malty with a very crisp citrus and pineapple punch that brought the beer to a wonderful balance. Mouthfeel was clean and full bodied not heavy but well put together. Overall a solid beer that I am happy to have found on the way out of town. Too bad we don't get this beer in KY."
"A solid IPA but nothing remarkable to separate it from the middle of the pack."
"Overall, it was a good ipa, not horrible, not excellent, pretty average. Very light for an ipa and refreshing. Would drink again for sure."
"Overall- When this first came out I loved it to the point that I thought I found my one and only go-to beer and the one beer I would constantly keep in the fridge. No such luck any more. I would like to blame it on my palate, but... It still could very well be. I remember it having more of a malt backbone (more of a mouthfeel) and no tanginess. Sorry NB. I meant every word at the time I emailed you, though. 2.5/5"
"This is a good IPA and represents the style perfectly. Long life those IPa's with hearty malts and flavorful hops. Here here."
"Overall: A very good meat-and-potatoes IPA that delivers the goods in terms of flavor, bitterness and refreshing drinkability. However, if I remember well, Ranger is far more tastier on tap, and even contains a fresher feel. Still, if there's something New Belgium never gets wrong, it's the zestiness of the hops they include in their brews!"
"Overall : I picked up this beer today for $3.50 . What a bargain for the taste it delivers. Great summertime ipa. Really a easy to enjoy beer."
"O: All in all a very light IPA, but one that suit the style very well. Good flavors and at the price it cannot be beat for a 3$ 22oz bottle"
"This is a great lighter-bodied IPA that's very hoppy but well-balanced and very drinkable. A perfect beer for a hot day."
"O: Overalll a very competent brew, a well balanced beer, with enough bitterness you would expect out of an IPA. When it comes to IPA's I have had better, but this is still a very good beer."
"Okay. Was hoping for more after seeing and smelling it. Taste doesn't live up. Just not much to it other than bitterness, without much of the nicer flavors I want the hops to bring."
"O- I'm hoping New Belgium comes to Ohio soon because I could see myself picking this up regularly."
"It was basically your typical IPA. Nothing too exceptional, nothing too out of the ordinary. I had it after having the Mothership Wit, the Somersault and the Fat Tire Amber Ale and I think it was only better than the MW. The biggest plus would be that it tasted clean."
"O: A nice IPA that’s pretty easy to find; a nice hop fix that’s not too over the top; good stuff."
"I had this one on tap earlier today up at the brewery. Poured a nice dark golden color, with a very nice inch or so of off-white foam. This one has a big floral hoppy aroma, which is extremely inviting. Taking a drink, I don't get much of the hop flavor, mostly sweet, bready malt, barely kissed with the promised hops."
"A very enjoyable IPA. Very balanced. I would call this a session IPA. Very easy to drink compared to in your face with hops that you get from the higher end IPA. Wish they had NEW BELGIUM brew on tap at every bar. Soon I hope. Light golden copper color with a head and lacing that gets thicker as you drink it. Very crisp smell of pine and sweet notes of citrus. If IPA made an awesome IPA Light beer this would be it. Drink it you'll like it."
"Overall, this is a good IPA. The flavors are well balanced with he crisp hoppiness adding a nice finish on the palate."
"O) Very tasty.... Why did I keep ordering those Fat Tires. I think this may be my new favorite by New Belgium."
"O: This is a very sessionable IPA. I enjoy the flavors and I hope I wasn't spoiled by it being on draft because I have high hopes that it will be close out of the bottle."
"I was really impressed with this IPA. For the price it is very drinkable. They are coming here to Virginia in Novenber. This will be in my regular rotation."
"O-a very impressive IPA for the price. this is very satisfying. has an impressive hop profile for the ABV. very drinkable."
"Pint glass pour and a clear golden ale with a frothy eggshell colored foamy head is produced. Nice lacing. The aroma is predominately orange with a slight whiff of pineapple and malt. Was thinking sweet before the sip but got a big time malt bomb with a side helping of bitterness. Way too malty for an IPA in my opinion. There is an odd aftertaste also. Watery mouthfeel…very thin. This malt bomb made the drinkability difficult for me. Overall I know this is an extremely popular beer by the masses, and that is great, I just like my IPA’s on the hoppier side. I am not a huge fan of New Belgium as I feel they tend to be on the malty side and this offering did nothing to change my opinion."
"Overall-Lacks depth. Kind of bland, not sure how fresh this bottle was. Still a good beer, slightly dissapointed. I've had worse."
"O-- Really two things and a good malt backbone. not mind blowing but very, very good. A session IPA and worth getting."
"This is one that won’t disappoint. BTW, its not a 9.99 6 pack. Very Nice."
"Overall I'm impressed. New Belgium always seems to satisfy me. This one is very drinkable and perfect for a hop fix. Not to mention its very well priced. 7.99 a six pack. That's a $1.30 a beer. Badass."
"Decent flavorful IPA, but not ground breaking. Enjoyable and worth trying, will be much more appealing to hop heads than it will to people who don't mind hoppy beers but don't go looking for them."
"Poured this American IPA from a 12oz bottle. The IPA poured a golden color and produced a nice white foamy head. The lacing left behind was very nice, surely above average. The aroma filled with floral hops. The mouthfeel was very nice, very smooth beer. The taste consisted of a strong malt base and was balanced by hop bitterness. Overall this was a very Safe IPA, nothing that makes it stand out other then its very good drinkability. Great entry level IPA."
"This beer pours a luxurious golden color that is topped off by an enticing thick foam head. The effects of the carbonation that create this creamy white cloud releases an aroma of spicy pine infused undertones that is almost overbearing when drinking. The intense bitterness hits the tongue in a refreshing way, but the after taste of pine almost ruins the experience for me. It is a well crafted beer that almost gets ruined by the intense spicy flavor of pine that I do not find in some of my other favorites IPA's."
"D- This is better than I remember. Let the bottle sit out a bit before consuming. Warming it up made it so much better."
"D - For a standard IPA, good. The body kind off dies after the first few sips. The smoothness (drinkability) is what makes this one worth having more than one. REALLY fresh hops, makes for a good summertime treat!"
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a whole evening."
"Overall: I'm not a big fan of IPAs, but brews such as these make me want to change my mind. It's a perfect beer that will refresh your taste buds in many meals and is great for sipping with salty snacks on a summer's day."
"A bright straw, gorgeous looking brew with a soapy, bubbly head and tons of effervescent bubbles rising to the top. Lace is strewn about the glass. Pine, earth and weed elements in the nose, with a light caramel/bready undertone. Tastes solidly bitter, with pine, earth and dirty grapefruit. The malt comes off biscuity, and really lets the hops do all the talking. Light to medium bodied feel, sharp hop bite, right on for the style. A veritable plethora of hops, with little else. Cool with me."
"O: Pretty nice IPA, I'd drink it again. Pretty dry, has similar qualities to a Fat Tire."
"O: A really nicely done IPA. A thin head remains for a long time and a lot of lacing is left as I drink the beer down. I like the balance in this IPA. It is a bit on the crazy, hoppy side, and satisfies that hop-head in me, but is balanced enough to keep me drinking and refreshed. The finish could be crisper for my taste. For me, this is an IPA that finds itself in my stock at least 50% of the time. It is really enjoyable and drinkable."
"I'm getting a lot of Simcoe in the nose and a nice reddish orange color on the pour, with a small head but impressive lacing. Nice American hop bill, with the fruits, the flowers, and the pine all there. Pale malts. I'm not sure what I would remember this for, but it's definitely a good drinking IPA."
"In terms of mouthfeel, it feels extremely thin. Overall a good effort, but I'll take Mighty Arrow over this any day, not to mention just about any other IPA."
"O: I'm not normally a fan of I.P.A.'s, but I have found this one to be palatable. I find that I prefer grapefruit and citrus flavors to the pine notes, and although this one contains both, I find that the pine notes are not overwhelming. I would say that this is probably on the upper end of my hop tolerance, and while the malts are subtle, they are there and they do help balance the beer out a bit. I found this to be quite drinkable considering the hop presence and higher ABV. Not my favorite I.P.A. by any means, but definitely drinkable. Cheers!"
"Another fantastic brew from the folks at New Belgium Brewery!"
"Overall - I do like this beer, and for those that prefer their IPA's on the biter/dry side, this one is a must. I respect that although missing the malt sweetness I enjoy, this still has all the bitter hoppy nuances that a hop lover would enjoy. I can recommend this beer, but if you're looking for a sweet malt balance, look elsewhere - Ranger is all about the hops :)"
"Will recommend for anyone looking for a solid dry hop with a hint of honey. A west coast IPA with a strong cascade hop feel."
"O: a good ipa with primarily pine hop flavor. Malt ils just enough to give some sweetness but not overpower the hop."
"D: good IPA for after mowing the lawn on a hot summer."
"D: Only when it is the best option (which is rare)."
"if you like ipas i think this one is a good example of the style."
"Pours a nice golden brown, with gobs of foam which reduce to thick lace on the glass. The smell was good and piney. This has a nice hop bitterness - I would prefer a tad more malt in the backbone, as it tastes a bit hard and unbalanced. But there are the hops .... Overall there are other IPAs I'd choose over this (Furious, Torpedo, Inversion), but I wouldn't hesitate to get it if it were the best IPA available."
"O (D) - this is a good IPA. The hops didn't hold up that well, but it's a fine beer."
"Notes: Overall a decent beer, although nothing steller for the style but okay at least."
"Poured a clear golden brown, moderate carbonation, and a foamy white head that leaves decent lacing. Didn't get much in the aroma, other than general IPA citrus notes. Hops up front in the taste, with citrus zest, mellowing out with some sweet maltiness. Pretty standard stuff. Light-medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable."
"Overall - Not the worst IPA not the best IPA but I think they could do much more with this, it seems they just wanted something that was super hoppy which it is but it comes out lacking the flavor that it could have. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Pours a clean, pale orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a mix of citrus and pine hops. In the taste, pine hops and a gingerbread like maltiness. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. Quite malty and more English than American, but nice nonetheless."
"O: Pretty solid example of a Chinook IPA. I could have a few of these. Skal."
"Now available in 12 Packs!"
"Overall: Very refreshing. An extremely drinkable IPA. If New Belgium was available in NJ I would make this a staple in my fridge. This is probably one of my favorite IPAs. I strongly believe it is much better than the B+ rating it receives."
"O: Very solid American IPA that has plenty of hops without being overpowering. A sweet honey malt balances the crisp hops bitterness. Enjoyable."
"O: Not bad at all. Can't say I was amazed but would definately go back to it for a standard."
"On tap at Old Chi's Wheatridge. Poured an amberish color with about a quarter inch head that quickly disapated. Aromas of malt, pine, and some citrus. Taste was quite a bit hoppier than I remember tasting in the bottle last spring/summer. Malt, piney, and a bit of citrus with a fair amount of hop bitterness. Definitely different on tap than in the bottle. Might have to try a couple more of these."
"Nonetheless, once again, a fab american IPA."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent IPA, not especially hop-bombish but pleasant enough on its own terms. Especially at the price, it's a nice brew to have available."
"A nice, balanced IPA from New Belgium. Clear light copper, white head. Piney and citrus smell, good for the style. The taste delivers a nice hop bite with a sturdy backbone that is quite pleasant. The taste lingers and shifts, drifting between the bitter and fruity. I very solid offering from New Belgium."
"Extremely easy to drink, this is an IPA that you could sit with all night. I'm pleased to say that this is one of the best NBB beers I've had. That it's one of their regular range is telling—they have got the basics just right."
"O/D: This is a very drinkable if not perfect IPA, and the canned version is great for backpacking"
"Decent, though I feel like I've had better experiences with this beer on tap. The hop character was decently bright, but a little bit funky in the nose-I wonder if the gusher indicated the beginning of an infection or if it was just an over-carbonated bottle. Nonetheless, still a good, and highly drinkable beer."
"The first sip tastes solid with a decent bite, but it's very drinkable. Very enjoyable overall!"
"Not the best beer I have had, but for an IPA that is available at the grocery store it is not bad. As I said before nothing super impressive going on with this one but it is a nice average IPA."
"This brew pours a very light golden hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head and a rim of clingy lacing,the smell is very tropical with aromas of banannas,mangoes,paw paw,citrus and piney,resiny hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated and allows the tastes of mangoes,banannas,lychee,citrus and marzipan all to mingle quite nicely before being finished off with a nice hit of piney hops and overall its definately a nice AIPA and will buy again cheers."
"Super good beer."
"O: I can say that this beer is worthy of its following amongst college students. If you are truly looking for a great IPA, though, there are many better ones for the same price."
"Overall: 4 out of 5! A nice change from the “normal” IPA. Excellent IPA profile with a slight twist. I was pleasantly surprised at the character since I had not heard a lot about this beer. * Don’t waste this one in the bottle, it really comes alive when poured. I drank a couple of these from the bottle the night before at a friend’s house and it certainly seemed less “alive” than when I poured it aggressively into my tumbler at home."
"O - This is a decent and fairly well balanced IPA. It stands up there with the rest of my craft IPA choices and I can see myself getting a six pack or a few bombers a year. It's not mind blowing but it's very good for what it is."
"D- Could and would definitely drink a six pack without hesitation. I'm going to go grab another right after I finish typing this sentence."
"Overall Drinkability - I like it. One of the better mass marketed IPAs."
"I have mixed feelings about New Belgium. I like some of their beers, I don't like others. This is one that I'll have again when I see it."
"O - This beer is a strong showing. The only downside may be the watery mouthfeel. West coast hop lovers will love this beer, but if you're looking for something complex, you won't find it here. That said, this is a solid IPA that I would definitely have again."
"A compulsively drinkable beer for hopheads."
"O - I prefer my beers malty, but this is a solid IPA."
"This is well crafted Am. IPA. Good staple for those who love the hops. Nicely served and do not drink from the bottle."
"O: This is an IPA you can introduce to your BMC drinkin' family and friends without thinking they're going to have to trudge through to not hurt your feelings, and New Belgium must know it, because they sell this at my local Wal-Mart."
"A highly drinkable, crisp, refreshing, clean and simple IPA. This really is very good beer, although I probably won't be revisiting it because I have even better options so easily available, but I would recommend trying this to anyone."
"M - Balanced carbonation and certainly not watery! One of the more viscous American IPA's i've tasted."
"GET THIS BEER, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED!"
"M and D - Mouthfeel is thin-to-medium, but with good support from the carbonation, it sits nicely on the palate. Refreshing, and nicely drinkable."
"Poured a transparent copper color with a nice amount of white fluffy head on it. Great lacing as I drink this one. Nice classic hop aroma. Taste is very good. Full of hops, some good citrus notes. Very smooth drinking beer with a good finish. I really enjoyed this one and lucky for me, it's readily available around my hometown. I enjoyed this one and it's a good standby to have available."
"O - Great IPA by New Belgium Brewing Company, I feel like they achieved exactly what they wanted to in this hoppy brew, I could enjoy six of these in a sitting with out a doubt. Well done"
"Overall - I was really surprised by how much I liked this beer. Kind of a cross between a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and a DogFish Head 60min. Highly drinkable and very tasty."
"Not the most extreme of the style, there are certainly more notable examples. But judging strictly by style this has all the bases coves, and covered well. Would not think twice about having this again."
"O: Not bad but not great either, pretty standard IPA. Plenty of hop bitterness but it would be nice to have some more hop aroma and flavor. It would be significantly better if there was a greater malt presence to add some sweetness and body, or at least enough hops to mask the lack of malt."
"Overall/notes - Solid IPA, and easy to drink considering the style. I'd be tempted to use this for cooking Brats, actually. Has a really piny character that makes me think of the outdoors... Then again, that could be the bottle. All in all, not the best nor the worst of its style."
"O: Not a bad beer overall. First beer from New Belgium that I have like in awhile. I would probably drink another of these if it is on tap at one of my local watering holes."
"O: This is definitely not what I look for in an IPA. The floral hops that are present are subdued."
"A really nice & affordable offering for IPA entusiast's by New Belgian which maintains that Biscuity malt flavor and aroma abundent in their Fat Tire. Not my personal favorite for the style but overall a well crafted brew with nice hoppiness. One of my favorite releases from NB thus far."
"O - Not a bad beer, not one I will ever try to find or likely drink again, but it's not unpleasant."
"D: A little weak in the taste, but still all right. Not as bitter as many IPAs I've had, which can be a good thing when you're trying more than one."
"pours a lighter amber color with a smallish white head, has a decent overall appearance. smell is decent, not as hoppy as one would expect. taste is good for a pale ale but for a IPA i feel it is misbranded, doesn't have the pizazz of a normal IPA, its a good pale ale however. mouthfeel is average, a bit watery. overall its a good beer but again, i dont feel its a true IPA."
"Overall: Overall a pretty good IPA. Definitely worth getting if it's on tap"
"poured from a bottle into a english style pint glass. mid range carbonation. small white head that leaves rather quickly. plenty of lace. the aroma is of a light pine to citrus. the mouthfeel is of a midrange carbonation and plenty of hops and medium malt. the finish is of a light bitter and dense aftertaste..this has become my favorite beer. and im hooked"
"Only wish I had ordered it earlier in the evening so I could keep going back. Luckily its readily available in stores so I'll be sure to be going back"
"The taste has a little floral bitterness, but more of a earthy soil and grass bitterness. This goes rather well with a medium toasted biscuit malt flavor and quenching yet resiny palate."
"M: Light body but lively carbonated. I can see this being a sessionable beer."
"D: This wasn't the most hoppy IPA but it tastes really good."
"D - Overall a well rounded IPA, a little unbalanced towards the bitter side but it's worth it to be rid of the biscut malt character. This was my introduction to IPAs and craft brews in general and was not ready for it at the time. Had to revisit to give Ranger its due."
"While not the hoppy-ist IPA or the most bitter, this is for sure a fun IPA. I think New Belgium Brewing Co did a great job at making an IPA that is, for the most part, something that the general population can try as an intro to IPAs. I think that any craft beer lover can find something about this beer to make them happy. Overall its just a fun beer to have when you are looking to just sip one with out having to think too much about it."
"This is a very drinkable beer, very enjoyable. This gives me a little more perspective on IPAs, a style I'll have to continue exploring."
"Overall another very solid brew from New Belgium. I will definitely pick this one up again if I'm looking for a well-crafted IPA."
"Served with fish tacos and they went perfectly."
"A bit high on the carbonation in my opinion, otherwise a fairly drinkable beer that I would pick over most other drafts at a place without too many crafts."
"A crystal clear amber orange with a foamy white head that keeps a nice retention layer on the glass. The nose is this beers strong point. Wow, I get strawberry, then pine and citrus. Very floral and berry notes make for a very appealing brew. The taste however leaves me looking for more. After such an excitement with the nose, the taste is mildly bitter and then just beer. The mouthfeel is very dry and the carbonation is a bit heavy. This is not my favourite but is good and may be a touch too dry for me and there is just not enough on the taste element."
"D-Affordability and accessibilty make this a decent and easily sessionable IPA."
"Pours clear golden with unstoppable thick oily head. Massive bouquet of hops, both pine and citrus. The flavor backs off a bit in comparison to the scent, but it is sufficiently hoppy, piney, somewhat sweet and thick. For a strong IPA, this beer is incredibly drinkable and very affordable. This is easily one of my favorite offerings from New Belgian, aside from the defunct Springboard."
"D: Decent enough but pretty average compared to many others I have tried."
"Pours a very nice deep copper color with excellent head and good lacing. Very deep hop aromas, with huge citrus hop scents over a very nice deep maltiness. Excellent flavor, with a huge malt forward and a great hop back that lasts on the tongue, with great citrus hop flavors. There is a fair bit of hop roughness, though."
"This was well balanced and disappeared before I knew it. Somewhat reminscent of New Glarus Moon Man."
"M/D: light bodied smooth creamy like feel. Adds to the easy drinkability and great taste and you have one really good hoppy beer."
"This is an IPA that has a high level of drinkability for those who are intimidated by IPAs."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is quite thin which makes it incredibly drinkable. A real sessionable brew right here."
"Good but not great."
"Overall: This is a decent IPA that I enjoy. Although it doesn't quite break from the IPA pack for me, it is solid. Also, it being that I am a cheap bastard and all, I find it on sale frequently, making it a nice beer that is easier on the wallet than some comparable IPAs."
"Pours a very clean and clear honey color with a nice 1.5 inch white head that fades to a small cap. Good ring lacing on the glass on the drink down. Smells of fresh and spicy pine hops only. Taste is of the herbal hops and some sweetish malt on the finish. Bitterness is moderate but not overwhelming. Carbonation is a bit flat. Drinkability is above average but the carbonation is a bit off putting. I would be more than happy to try another one of these to see if I get a different outcome."
"D: I like it a lot. I'd order another, and I'm glad I bought 6. I'll definitely buy it again."
"I wouldn't want more than a couple in an evening, but I liked this one. I can see buying more in the future."
"Notes: Have had several over the past few days before focusing and writing the review today. Not growing tired of it at all."
"Final Notes: Not my favorite IPA, but if there was such a thing as a session IPA this would be it. Would make a great introduction to IPAs or to pair against mildly spicy food."
"d - not very balanced or complex, although the nose is terrific and inviting. makes a good session ale or compliment to spicy food. there are better all around affordable ipas (probably local), but this hits the pine hop ipa fix fairly well."
"M/D: A really dry IPA. No bold flavors to make it memorable. Still, Ranger is a servicable IPA if you're in a hurry or in the mood for something new."
"A variety or hop aromas, pine, floral, and citrus. Taste has a clean hop bite, but not too bitter. Higher carbonation helps the mouthfeel."
"Pours an orange gold color with off white frothy bubbly head which lingers as a nice film. Aroma of sweet resiny hops, slight citrus but in a sweeter way, like tangerine, and cake. Flavor is nice resin-pine like hops, sweet and pungent, which then reveals a cake like malt consistency, back to a slight bitterness of the hops on the finish. Medium to full bodied, not too thick or syrupy. Overall a pretty solid IPA, great flavors, not TOO big (read: sessionable). Good good stuff."
"Clor ws great and the aromas off the glass were inviting. Every sip was balanced from begining to end w/ a wonderful ratio of flavors. On a night where I felt like drinking a lot of IPA I could go w/ this one. Flavor is there and alcohol % is mid ranged allowing for a full night of good spirits."
"It pours yellow with nice, big chucky head that lasts. The smell is floral and hoppy, but not overly heavy on the hops. The hops and malt are very well balanced in the taste; this could almost be a strong pale ale. It is very crisp and all around good. This is not the first time that I have tasted Ranger, and I remember from past experiences that it was noticeably light on the sweetness for being an IPA...the same is true on this tasting."
"D: Decent IPA, just doesn't quite have that wow factor."
"D - a balanced and drinkable IPA; good effort here;"
"Overall an amazing American IPA. At 70 IBU it's one of the more hoppy beers I have tried to date and amazingly has to be the smoothest. A very well built beer. The whole taste is not as bitter as to be expected. Nice sweet malt notes all through-out the taste and finish making this, for an IPA, extremely drinkable. Due to the ABV it'll never hit the session table with the buddies but a great start to our session!! Great Beer New Belgium Brewing!!!"
"Taste is grassy, earthy, clean, and delicious, with a bitter followthrough. Ranger isn't a massive hop-bomb, but works well as a tasty and trusty IPA worthy of repeat purchase."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice clear amber body with a small white head and some light lacing. Good floral hoppy aroma with a little sweet malt in the background. Great piney hop flavor, with a bit of sweetness to balance. Very drinkable. Solid IPA."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a finger of slighty off white foamy head that leaves permenant ring reminders of your progress down the glass. The aroma is strong with floral hops and that's about all. The taste starts slightly malty sweet and then comes on strong with a piney citrus hop taste that stays around for a while. The batch I had at the Africa Lounge in SeaTac airport was slightly overcarbonat"
"I am a big fan of IPA's, and look for a bold aroma, nice head, lots of hop flavor all in a brew that goes down smoothly. Is that too much to ask for? The New Belgium Ranger IPA gets high marks, and is one of my favorites. The Ranger IPA has a great aroma and luxurious head that lasts to the very end. The hop flavor is intense and complex, not a lot of malt sweetness, so this is a serious IPA! I probably would not drink many Ranger IPAs back to back. A good choice when you want one great IPA."
"Gets bonus points for interesting taste - a unique IPA."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA. It is smooth and refreshing. The fruitiness of the hops is presented so well in this beer and its relatively mild bitterness makes it very easy to drink. The 6.5% ABV is great for the style and as a beer to truly savor, but the juicy hop flavors and aroma mask the alcohol pretty well, making this a brew that could easily sneak up on you."
"Mouthfeel is nice and foamy, and the aftertaste makes me really love this beer. I'm not a fan of New Belgium, but this really is a solid IPA. Could drink this every day and not be tired."
"Light bodied with just enough carbonation to help clean the palate for the next sip. Not much alcohol in the taste helps make this drinkable."
"I don't usually like ""balanced"" IPAs but the this is enough hops to win me over. Also, at 6.5% I can drink a few. Once again, happy day!"
"Drinkability is great, I could have plenty of these."
"D) A delicious IPA! I'd definitely drink more of this."
"Pours a yellow/gold with a thick head that leaves pretty nice lacing behind. The smell is a little weak in the hop department. Bready malts are there with a slight herbal and earth hop note backing. The taste is better by far. Very balanced but still hoppy. A few things show up here but not in the smell, citrus and clean, clear Colorado water. Goes down very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink but not at the top of the list. Easy on the wallet and hoppy which gives it the 4 on drinkability. I have to say I should have reviewed it when I had it on tap. It was a bit better on tap for sure."
"Pours a deep dark orange red color with a thick yellowish white head and a ton of good lacing. Smells of piny grassy hops and some citrus. Tastes of hoppy bitterness and some slight grapefruit and almost no malts. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"d 3-3.5 favorably impressed, especially since my expectations were low. but way too 1-D to become a favorite."
"Overall: Good, simple IPA... that is cheaper than a Furious."
"Simply put, this IPA is excellent with respect to virtually every facet. Some who make this style can over-do the hops, but New Belgium strikes an excellent balance; several flavors are present, but they're all pretty distinct without being overpowering. If you like IPAs (regardless of origin), then you owe it to yourself to sample this interpretation of a wonderful style."
"This is the second time I have had this and it is a solid offering from New Belgium. I am sure I will have it in the fridge again because it is very good for the price."
"Pours a nice soapy off white head, slightly cloudy golden orange body. Not much of a smell, some american hops of some sort, a touch of sweet carmel malts. Tastes a touch sweet at first, some grassy hop bitterness, touch of citrus. After each sip this finishes quick and quite bitter and dry. Too dry for me to drink a few of theses. Medium body, medium carbing. I wish this had a bigger smell. Thanks mike for the sample."
"Since I'm not a weed smoker and the weed aromas and flavors are so big that this obviously well crafted IPA isn't my thing. I can tell it's quality and fresh, which I appreciate."
"Where the nose was nice and mild, the flavor was definitely mellow in its own way. Carrying a nice medium body with heavier medium carbonation, the Ranger also offered a slick oiliness that coated my tongue and mouth while at the same time ended on a dryer note. I've gotta find out how they do that, it doesn't make sense to me that something can be oily and dry at the same time...and still taste delicious. I think the oil came from the lemon peel that was in the aroma, but the taste was more lemon-lime with touches of grapefruit rind. I was a little surprised to find that none of the citrus flavors were very pronounced or obvious despite the use of both Cascade and Chinook hops, and much of the taste came out in light unidentifiable florals and herbs. Nearing the end of my glass, I was able to pay more attention to the sweetness emanating from the liquid and recognized a light honey and a few caramel malt notes just around the edges. These were offered with some breadiness that helped me to really feel it in my mouth - making it taste stronger/thicker."
" D- This beer has a nice full hop flavor that reminds me of British hops. There are not overpowering and well supported by the malt underneath. This is very easy to drink with nice full hops."
"Delightlfully smoothe and robust in flavor, this is precisely what beer should taste like! I could see a few of these disappearing fast!"
"Drinkability is decent, but I tend to lean toward more citrus flavored IPAs lately. Drinkable for sure, not bad, boldly pine IMO, just not my favorite."
"On a recent vacation in the Mt. Rushmore area, I found Fat Tire to be plentiful as well as other New Belgium offerings. As an IPA fan I naturally grabbed a six pack of Ranger and was not disappointed. I hope I don't have to wait another ten years to get Ranger again."
"D: As a hop head i won't have a problem drinking this one. I don't know if I'd session this one though."
"Nice hop bite with some smooth tea and herbal flavor. Carmel malt backbone supports the hop forward flavor. Candied orange/grapefruit. Very drinkable when fresh. Carbonation is on the high side."
"Ranger pours a clear bronze color with a small amount of head that does not stick around. Smell is of hops, pine and citrus. This is a damn fine IPA if you are a hop head. Initial smoothness upfront then WACK! the hop bitterness hits you. This beer has a very crisp and fresh taste with a slight sweetness, and a hint of pine. I forgot how much I enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable and I could see putting away a few of these on a hot summer afternoon. Not a very complex IPA like Dogfish, but if you are looking for your basic IPA to enjoy at a BBQ or with a pizza this is a go to beer."
"This brewery is the rogue of the rocky mountains. A couple good beers, the rest all have the same mediocore taste."
"Ranger is everything you could ask for out of an american ipa....bouquet of a variety of hops....bitter and aroma...a sharp bitter taste that lingers for a bit....great lacing....the color is light...as with most new belgiums beer....the beautiful aroma hops are sweet and bright in smell....all the way around Ranger is all that one could ask for in an american ipa"
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp, nice carbonation. Overall its pretty good. Honestly, the taste is what takes knocks it down a little. The smell was amazingly fresh and the appearance was awesome."
"Drinkability- I got this beer as part of a sampler pack and I'll probably buy more at some point. It's nothing too fancy, but just a nice beer to sit and enjoy."
"The taste is slightly subdued on the hop flavors, at least in comparison to the aroma. It is by no means a wimpy IPA, but I don't feel fully satisfied with my sip after such a wonderful nose. It's not a complete let-down, it tastes pretty damn good. There's a punch of bitterness and piny flavor right from the start, and it subdues into a sweeter grapefruit hop taste. Later the malt peeks in to see what's going on, but the door is slammed in its face as the bittering hops take control and leave a VERY dry, bitter aftertaste. Some people have told me that this aftertaste is a HUGE turn-off to an otherwise remarkable beer. I say, ""BRING IT", I love being hit in the face by hops, and this IPA does exactly that."
"Had this on-tap at the New Belgian location in the Denver airport. Pours a dark organge colour with thick frothy head with some lacing. Nice hopping, both pine and citrus come out with some bready/caramel malt. Flavour has a nice mild bitterness to it, easy drinking. Carbonation may be a bit too high and it was served too cold, but a nice IPA."
"I've heard good things about this. Let's hope they're right. It pours a clear amber topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, and plenty o' caramel. The taste runs very similarly, with some added pine sap and a touch of mint and lime (mojito, anyone?). The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice little IPA, nothing tongue-destroying, but something one could easily sit down and enjoy for a while."
"After all is said and done, this is a well-crafted IPA that is certainly worth one's time. Plus, at $3 for a bomber, the price is right! There is a good chance that you may find yourself at a bar where this is the best thing on tap. Consider this."
"Overall a decent IPA it has a unique flavor, yet is fairly hop forward. Not the best IPA on the market but for a company who has not really done a hop forward beer before they did a nice job."
"Grabbed a pint at Mullet's in Des Moines. It's a light copper color with a good amount of head that keeps wanting to spill over the edge of the glass. The aroma is all hops but it isn't overbearing. The aroma is the same with a bit of lemon added in. The finish isn't too acidic. This is a good hop-head beer that doesn't require novocain on the tongue beforehand. Definitely a repeat."
"Cheers..."
"D - Really good. This isn't a hop bomb by any means, and I could see downing a few of these during the right occasion."
"D: This IPA is a lightweight when it comes to taste, featuring a flavor profile that just can't live up to the remarkable smell. Clean flavor qualities are taken too far at times, with only the finish really representing the style faithfully. Among its peers Ranger is boring; an IPA with training wheels. The flavors will vanish completely in the company of assertive food flavors. It is genuinely appealing to sniff and to gaze upon, though."
"Very refreshing and easy-drinking, although the taste is a little mild compared to the aroma."
"D: Very easy to drink, would have a few."
"Very good beer. I recommend this as an excellent example of American IPA."
"Ranger IPA pours a bright gold with a thick, foamy white head that doesn't give up. The aroma is just about as close to a hand full of fresh hops as you can get, grassy, herbal and citrusy. The flavor is dry with plenty more grassy herbal hops, There is just enough sweet light malt hiding underneath the hops to balance out the hops. The bitterness is surprisingly mild for the level of hop flavor, but there is still a nice resiny aftertaste."
"Overall, I think this beer is good, it is memerable, but not the best IPA I have had, but it is one that I want to drink a bunch of. I really like this IPA. Go New Belgium for stepping out of your comfort zone."
"Drinkability was great and I will have another please....wonderful brew"
"The body is a lot thinner than I would have expected. Almost watery with minimal carbonation. Overall this is a pretty decent beer. I really like the hop profile, but I can't get over the watery feel to the body. It's a good beer, but I won't set up a trade for this one again."
"The beer is a golden orange color, with a very foamy white head that sticks to the glass like a crazy ex-girlfriend. The smell is hoppy for days on end, with bright floral smells adding to the fun factor of this brew. This beer is a hop-bomb, but the bitterness does not make your face collapse in on itself. With most bitter beers, you receive a bouncing sensation across the palate, much like pop-rocks. The Ranger IPA does not have this bouncing sensation, however, the flavors that are contained stand out bold and delicious. Steak-drinkable, a beer that goes good with a manly meal. One of the more fun beers that we have had."
"Will try 2 Below and see about that one."
"In spite of its lackluster nature, its ease to drink kicks it up a notch in the drinkability. A crisp enough beer to partly enjoy, even if you aren't highly buoyant about it."
"D - A very ok IPA, I would definitely drink it again, but not a lot."
"Clear amber in color with a rocky, light-khaki head. Biscuity aroma consists of piney and citrusy hops - Simcoe, Cascade, Chinook. The mouthfeel is med with soft carbonation. With the three types of hops used and with 70 IBUs this definitely has an assertive hop bitterness to its flavor. It's resiny with grapefruit and is bitter throughout. The juicy middle lends it way to some maltiness toward the back. The 6.5% abv becomes somewhat noticeable as the beer warms."
"This is a nice IPA from a great brewery. I will say that I've had IPAs with higher IBUs that did a better job of balancing malt and hops. This would not be my first choice but I'd be happy to have it again!"
"Drinkability is good. Three's plenty to enjoy here. I think the high bitterness my stop me from having them back to back however."
"Drinkability: There are 'better' IPA's out there however Ranger hits the right notes and with it's clean and crisp finish, it's easy to drink."
"D- Very well balanced for an IPA. No off flavors. Very refreshing. Easy to drink. Good IPA. Not the best, but in the top ten."
"Chad"
"One finger head from the pour with nice lace retention. Color rates a 7 on the SRM beer color chart. Slightly cloudy because of the action of thousands of tiny bubbles. Lots of hop smell in this one, with hints of malt and roasted wheat. Taste of hops, lemon peel, sweet cigar, golden wheat, yeast and malt. Feels like heavy cream sliding over my tongue, around my teeth and down my throat. Not the prettiest design on the bottle to draw one's attention to the beer, but very drinkable. I will recommend this to my beer buddies."
"D - This IPA drinks easy but has bite and flavor, so I enjoy drinking a few. Overall its a very balanced IPA with great drink-ability and filtered clarity. I like this one as far as a good overall IPA not from California."
"Nevertheless, its drinkable and definitely not BAD - its just not what most probably expect when they read ""IPA""."
"DRINK THIS STUFF UP...IT'S AWESUM."
"All in all, a good IPA. Pretty strong, but no off flavors and nothing offensive. Straight forward and will probably please most lovers of style."
"D An outstanding IPA, worth seeking out. 4.5  "
"Pours a nice golden color with a frothy head. Good hop aromas and nicely carbonated. Hints of citrus and pine. Pretty good selection from New Belgium. The drinkability is great. At 6.5%, it is a bit lighter than some other IPAs but just about right for me. I could drink a couple of these."
"The color of this beer is a golden yellow almost orange. You can smell simcoe hops right away. The taste almost starts out spicy, from the hops, and ends in a citrus almost piney bitterness. The bitterness lingers a little bit with this beer, which im assuming is from the use of simcoe hops. The malt character isnt really noticeable. They do use pale and caramel 120. The 120 gives it a really nice color, without giving to much malty sweetness. A pretty good ipa."
"D- Overall I think the aftertaste really made the drinkability go down."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a low-lying white head and not too much lacing. Nose is slightly citric with some light floral aspects as well. Light base with a bit of pale malt and slight caramel sweetness. Feel is a bit dry with good carbonation. Drinks well in the end and is fairly sessionable, but not a high caliber IPA."
"D: This isn't my favorite IPA but I think a bit of a crowd pleaser. The alcohol is right where you'd expect for an IPA, and the flavors don't knock you out. It's well-balanced and very enjoyable. I love my beer a tad more dangerous than this but I could certainly be convinced to drink a few. :o)"
"Easy drinking IPA which is quite enjoyable. The ""samples"" in which I have enjoyed were provided for free from New Belgium customer service. Though not able to purchase NB products in my area the beer and the company itself has truly impressed."
"This is a focused IPA. The malt takes a back seat to the evergreen herbal hops."
"New Belgium Brewing Company--Ranger India Pale Ale--the JOY RIDE--Full of optimism, biscuity malt, and 20 YEARS of Stories, Fat Tire is rolling out The Joy Ride.--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 70 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Medium lace tight mild white head. Clear thin bright amber gold color. Aromatic floral Cascade hop front.

"Not impressed too much here."
"Great drinking, some IPAs can linger on the pallate forever but this one is cleaner without compromising the style."
"D: A solid, well balanced IPA that made its hop presence known to me equally as well as it quenched my thirst during a hot summer day's Bar-B Q..."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. This is a very tasty IPA with the perfect amount of balance that would bring me to crack open another can just as I am taking the last sip (from a glass of course) from the previous one."
"It a long time for NB to add an IPA to their regular line and I for one think it hits the mark. Hoppy but very balanced making it a very drinkable IPA with enough hops to satisfy most hopheads. There really is not point in trying to out gun the highest IBU IPA at this point especially with a beer meant for large distribution and consumption. I am all for the balance and mouthfeel over sheer hops."
"After drinking the six pack over several days, I'm confident in suggesting Ranger IPA starts off great & gets sketchy over the course of the glass. It shows so much promise but doesn't male it to the upper echelon. Nevertheless, it isn't a bad beer & I'd drink it again."
"D:A well done job by New Belgium and probably the best offering I have had from them so far. Easy drink, nice flavor and taste, and very affordable at under $4 for a bomber."
"fair body. nothing super special, but I'd drink it again."
"Notes: A good IPA, but nothing outstanding. Good amount of citrus with some pine and herbal flavors in the taste. Fairly bitter tasting IPA. Enjoyable, but nothing world beating."
"I went back and bought a second six pack, but that's probably all for me in this life."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a white head that slowly dissipates down to a thin foam on top of the beer. Smell is dominated by pine hops. Taste is also dominated by the pine hops, with a hint of floral hops and malt. Mouthfeel is medium/light and its a crisp beer. Overall, decent IPA."
"Very drinkable beer, one of my favorites, I always come back to this one."
"You can really get some faded ones of these lately. Drink asap I'd say if this is the best ipa you can afford/find."
"The taste is that of the west coast style IPA. Lots of pure hop bitterness and no real malt character. Piney flavors dominate, this beer is a tasty thirst quencher on a hot day. Dry and highly carbonated, this went down easily."
"I picked this up a few weeks ago and kept it in the fridge since. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Wow, perfectly clear, giving me a lovely golden honey hue with a massive off-white head. Long lasting and retains as a cap. Lots of lacing forming rings in the glass. The aroma yells grapefruit with a tiny hint of pineapple. But a weird listerine-like tone as well. Hmm, at least it's not too noticeable. Immediate honey and tangerine notes give way to a mildly grassy and herbal finish. Pine is subdued, but present. Long aftertaste of honey and grapefruit rind. Perfect carbonation and a smooth beer. Solid. I should make this a staple IPA or one to have at least a few times a month. Too bad they don't distribute around here."
"Pours a clear ambery gold color with cap of stiff white bubbles, good retention and sticky lacing. Scent is of piney hops with only a faint kiss of citrus and malt. Taste is slightly more balanced with bitter piney hops the dominant flavor but a noticable pale malt background, almost pilsner in quality. Dry, bitter and coating. A good IPA which could use more flavorful hops and a kick more malt."
"A perfectly adequate IPA, happy to drink it anytime, but just can't get into it. Pours a brilliant gold with a nice, fluffy head, nice retention with moderate lacing. Aroma is pine-heavy with a little citrus fruit. On the palate this is well balanced, firmly bitter, resiny and medium bodied with a hit of alcohol on the finish. Drinkable, almost east-coast in style, this is merely lacking a more pronounced hop character to elevate this."
"drinkability is not as moreish as a lot of other ipas, but still darn good - a good but not great beer."
"D-Exceedingly drinkable for an IPA. Drinks well cold and warmer. A good IPA and one of the best beers I have had from New Belgium. A very nice offering that is readily available and reasonably priced."
"The lacing on this thing is fantastic. I don't consider most IPAs to be very drinkable, but this is. It's got good alcohol but you don't notice it. It's got a good bite, but it's very well balanced. This is really a beer I could enjoy drinking every night."
"Drinkability: An excellent example of an IPA that I don't think makes it to Ohio."
"D - very drinkable for hop-lovers. Certainly not the best IPA on the planet, but very good. I would not recommend for the average BMC beer drinker or someone that doesn't like hoppy beers."
"I like this beer. It's not my favorite American craft IPA, but I could certainly do worse than the Ranger from my selection of beers down here in the Rio Grande Valley. I've had this many times and foresee myself drinking more of it in the future."
"Pours a clear, dark-golden color with a big white head that slowly diminishes. Scent is hoppy with a nice, sweet caramel malt smell as well. The weird thing is, this beer also has a slight scent of the ""cat piss"" I got from HopSlam and another IPA and can't think of off the top of my head. The taste is quite delightful. I've had Ranger NUMEROUS times, but I think this may be the freshest I've ever had. I was never this impressed by this beer in the past. Strong hop profile with some great caramel and candy sugar flavors. I get melon and orange flavors. The mouthfeel is not overly crisp, with a slight chewy feel. The drinkability is very high."
"O: This beer was much better on tap. I'm pretty disappointed with the bottled version, but age could be playing a role. I'll pay close attention the next time I pick up a bottle. It could very easily be the last time."
"Drinkability: Not a bad IPA, but nothing particularly distinguished, either"
"D'ability - very strong hop character, but not unpleasant. Slight warming might limit d'ability, but actually quite drinkable for an IPA."
"D: A satisfying, well-crafted American IPA which shows exemplary balance. The 6.5% ABV is just right for an IPA of this aggressiveness, but the alcohol and hop sting is kept in check by the creamy malt body. A job well done; I'd certainly get it again."
"D: Could easily drink several of these. Wouldn't be a regular, but would never turn on down. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"Overall impression: I thought this was a boyscout IPA. All the components were by the book-nothing to outlandish. Still, it was very good and I would recommend this to someone wanting to try an IPA for the first time. I would have this again."
"Nice to see a well-wrought example of a New World American standard from a brewery who up to now has only reminded me of ambitious Old World style renditions. Ranger leans quite heavily toward the hops, if maybe in a less than certain way, the malt balance seeming like a bit of an afterthought. Still, enjoyable and eminently drinkable, especially given the sticker price and convenient ubiquity (south of the 49th, that is)."
"Very good beer with great dynamic of flavor. A little too much sweetness in the middle, but overall still very good. Prolly wouldn't buy a 6 pack of it, but maybe get one on draft sometime."
"Pours a clear fairly pale amber in color with good carbonation. A very smooth and creamy head billows up and the retention, not to mention the lacing, is outta sight!! Flowery, grapefruity and some cinnamony notes in the nose. Not sure where the latter is coming from, but it rounds out the aroma nicely. Flavor is what you'd expect in an IPA, but just the more-balanced side of the IPA world. Funyy - this comes from Colorado, which isn't quite the West Coast, and the hoppiness of this IPA is less so than those on the West side...kinda neat and regional. Finish is super-long and bitter in a good way. This is actually the best New Belgium beer I've had yet, andf it's really excellent, and excellently priced. You should probably keep a bomber or two of this on hand at all times. Great effort from Fort Collins."
"D - Satisfies my IPA craving but it really lacks some serious aroma."
"Light to medium bodied, decent carbonation, has a bitter aftertaste, and finishes dry. Not bad overall, but there is nothing which makes me want to try this again either."
"Drinkability was impressive. This IPA was hoppy enough to keep my interest yet balanced enough to be sessionable. Furthermore, the 6.5% ABV was remarkably well hidden. Overall, not a terribly complex brew but notable nonetheless."
"D - This one is very drinkable. If Two-Hearted ale wasn't readily available in my area, Ranger IPA would be a regular in my beer fridge."
"D: I could definately drink 3-4 at a time being that it's so easy to get at our local grocery store and so cheap. Not my favorite IPA, but right by me for the style."
"D: A nice end-of-day beer that delivers a rich aroma and decent taste. I like the piney focus of the hops. And how strange to have to travel to North Carolina for some New Belgium!"
"This was an enjoyable IPA and one that I would order again."
"I've liked but not loved New Belgium's offerings thusfar but I think this is their best. Last night I made some vindaloo curry and Ranger matched it spectacularly. A solid choice, even among american IPAs"
"D - color me pretty impressed. i put down quite a few of these on vacation. great hop profile and drinkable due to a moderate body and controllable ABV."
"Draft. Clear golden orange color, slight white head. Aroma of subtle hops. Taste is slight bitterness not overly bitter. Very little lacing. Lingering on bitter. Decent but nothing spectacular. Decently balanced. Light/medium mouthfeel. A good choice if there is nothing else to be had on tap."
"D - New Belgium seems to be a middle of the road brewery to me, good beer but nothing that is hit out of the ballpark. Ranger is a definite solid offering that has actually raised their stock in my eyes. A very good IPA."
"D - Not just an excellent IPA but an excellent beer."
"I had my first bottle of this beer 2 weeks ago on vacation in OBX NC. Once I opened the bottle the beers citrus/floral came out and hit me first. Very nice poor and great legs. This beer is one of the better IPA's I have had that use cascade hops and has, like the aroma, a medium to strong citrus presence and almost completely hid its taste of alcohol. Not overly strong but definitely creeps up on you after two or three.... Again it hides its punch well. Highly recommend this beer to lovers of a more floral/citrus IPA.. Compare it as a somewhat less floral version of the Ithaca flower power. Just disappointed I can not get this beer in upstate New York!"
"D- Very refreshing for one to two, but after two the bitterness lingers too long. Excellent for tasting, not drinking alot."
"D- If you like IPA's give it a shot. It's pretty good."
"Seems like New Belgium was aiming for a crisp, clear IPA with nice light hoppy flavor (a ""lagerlike"" IPA). Unfortunately, they whiffed on this, I can't help but point to Alaskan IPA for a brewery that really nailed this style."
"Pours a clean gold with a nice persistent rocky head. Great lacing. Great clean citrusy hops smell. Lemons and grapefruit. Taste is unsurprisingly also dominated by citrus hops. Bitterness throughout and lingers pleasantly. Some malty sweetness provides a bit of balance. Medium bodied, maybe a touch lighter than one would expect. Well carbonated. Refreshing (for an IPA). Very easily drinkable."
"New Belgium Ranger IPA, 22 oz. bomber. Has some tiny numbers printed on the label, brewed on date, best before info who knows, they make no sense to me. Pours on the clear side, glowing orangy amber, soft and fluffy off white head, slowly goes to a thin film and leaves nice looking sheeting and extensive fine lacing. Extra points given for the kick ass lace left by this one on my glass. Mild tea like hops, with some faint citrus/tropical fruits. Decently hopped AIPA, not over the top (like I like) but still respectable. More orange peels, smooth honey, some earthiness and perhaps light smoke. Surprisingly complex, quite enjoyable. Nice offering from NB"
"Drinkability - IPA's aren't my favorite, and this one's aftertaste is a bit too much for me, but in general I think it makes a good beer. Probably a strong choice for an IPA lover."
"Overall a very nice beer from New Belgium. I've enjoyed most of their beers but this one is unique for them and they did quite well"
"Ah, the Ranger IPA from New Belgium...one of my favorite breweries. I am a huge fan of this style of beer, so my review may be a little biased. I love the lacing that the beer keeps on the glass. Like artwork. Very nice aroma. Taste is quite good. Nice balance of hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Overall a very drinkable IPA. Even at 6.5%, it qualifies as a good session beer...at least among my circle of friends! Seems to be our go to beer for a day of grilling and engaging in some lawn games."
"A very good ipa from new belgium."
"pours a darker orange, but SUPER clear, a little head but not a ton, actually quite a pretty beer. smells a nice, lighter hops. mostly a citrus greapfruit smell, with just a hint of resiny, piny bitterness. also a small, sweeter malt profile, but nothing too developed. smooth with decent carbonation in the mouth, but nothing too special. the hops present are a little unbalanced. never hard to drink or harsh, but definitely does not beg to be drank."
"D: Very drinkable given it's moderate abv, and cleanness on the palate. I would love to be able to have this ale around as a everyday beverage. Refreshing, and not too heavy on the buds."
"Surprisingly creamy and smooth, thick mouthfeel. More bitter than I thought it would be. Overall I'd say New Belgium's IPa is pretty good. It's not amazing but it was great for the price ($7 for a 6-pack) Definitely worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Nearly balanced, but the hops do win out, a nice taste & aroma with a moderate ABV make it pleasantly drinkable. It's better than I expected and a worthy IPA."
"Overall, very nice IPA."
"Drinkability get good marks for being readily available and being resonable priced for an IPA. Looks like I will going back for more sixers because I can't get enough. Good job New Belgium."
"Review check five months later. Not going to change anything. A very nice IPA deserving of a high rating. Still a favorite IPA."
"First off you will notice the extreme hops smell. I have never had a beer before that tasted like pure hops. The aroma is better than the taste. It is like drinking a bottle of hay and oats and unprocessed barley. Not an everyday beer, and definitely not fr everyone."
"Pours a clear gold with two finger white head, fades slowly to a half inch, leaving a sheet of chunky lace for a couple of inches. Smell: there's a blast of citrus when first poured but that fades away leaving floral and lemon above light biscuit and a soft melon note. Taste: pine and a little minty, citrus rind, a touch of tropical fruit and toffee sweetness mid-sip, decently bitter pine, citric, and herbal finish. Light, creamy feel. This is pretty nice. Drank 3/8 best by 6/12."
"Poured copper/amber into a pint glass, with one finger of white, good retention, and good lacing. The nose was not overwhelmingly hoppy; some bitter, herbal notes were nicely offset by some malty, apple, caramel notes. The taste confirmed the flavor, with the most notable aspect being balance; fruit and malt meet nicely at midpalate and then finish on a dry note. Those expecting big citrus and bitterness from their ipa's will be disappointed with this brew, but they should be careful to not discount the beer entirely, as this is a very nicely balanced one. Modest carbonation and medium body make for a good session experience."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Lighter bodied and less bitter than most other IPAs, which makes for quite easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied."
"Drinkability - A delicious beer that truly surprised me. Definetly worth your time."
"Decent IPA, a fairly good offering from NB."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium light. Carbonation is perfect, sparkly. This is a really good beer. I may have to see if I can track down a few more bottles. I would drink this again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but I would like a little more flavor"
"D- Highly drinkable. It may be a malty and sweet IPA, but it is very drinkable and could be good for those who aren't into hops. Another solid entry by NB that's worth a try."
"I enjoyed this hoppy brew with Beer Can Chicken (did not use this beer in the chicken) and it worked out quite nicely."
"Lighter body, but coats well. Extreamely easy drinking, almost sessionable. Certainly worth trying."
"Solid IPA, nothing groundbreaking, but solid."
"Compared to other IPAs this one is lacking in certain areas buts it is still a good beer."
"A surprisingly good IPA that can get chugged in serious quantity."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and I would label it as a ""sessionable"" brew. IPAs are one of my favorite beer styles (especially during the warmer months) and this one is one of my favorites. Highly recommended to all other hop heads out there"
"Easy to drink. This will become one of the go to IPAs for me. Great job New Belgium. There's always room for one more IPA when they are this good."
"The beer pours a bright orange, initial head of about a finger and a half of off white foam. Retention and lacing are average. The nose is pretty good, pure hop resin. It seems like more and more hop forward beers (at least from American brewers) are going the citrus route, so it's always nice when I find a beer that's gone in a different direction. The taste is a little bit of a letdown, as after minimal (maybe even too little) malts upfront the hop bitterness thoroughly dominates any flavor that was hinted at in the nose. The score for taste would have been lower, but as the beer approaches room temperature this egregious imbalance begins to fade and the resinous hop flavor becomes more appreciable. The carbonation level is nice, a tad low for the style but still perfectly acceptable. The body however, as the lack of malty flavor might have suggested is entirely too thin for an IPA. The light body does lend the beer some drinkability; it drinks fairly easily. That said, I'd gladly trade some of that drinkability for a little more caramel or bready malt flavor. Ranger isn't a bad beer, it's just unfortunately brewed in a style that many breweries are a little more locked in on."
"Drinkability is relatively high. The ABV is moderate but well incorporated and easily managed. The flavor profile is pleasing enough, and indeed it is an IPA. No major problems here."
"This is an other great offering from New Belgium. It's one of those beers that if you didn't have anything important to do it would be easy to kill a sixer without too much thought."
"Great beer here. I'm quite the hop head and so I might be a little biased towards the IPA's but this one is great. Nice light color with a foamy head that laces the glass wonderfully. The smell is very citrusy and not too overpowering. Simply one of the best IPA's ive had. I'll be getting this one again."
"D- It really exceeded expectations for me. I purchased the beer in Chicago and wondered about freshness due to transit from Colorado. It's a nice balance of full/complex flavor without killing the tastebuds. I could see putting it into a regular IPA rotation if it was available in the MI market."
"Its not the best IPA no, but its pretty damn good and a value for a 7 dollar or so price point for a 6 pack"
"All in all, a very worthy representation of the style and my second favourite at this point."
"What redeems this beer for me is its drinkability - this is one of the lightest IPA's I've ever had, and it goes down very smooth despite the little hop rush. While its flavor pales in comparison to other IPA's, it gets its niche for being one of the most drinkable of its style. Keep in mind that it hits at a respectable 6.5%."
"Thanks jerz!"
"Very drinkable IPA. A bit unusual, perhaps because it tastes like it has the Fat Tire malt behind it. Not your typoical west coast IPA, but good, and I would buy it again, especially at this price."
"With a crisp & lively mouthfeel, this is a refreshing & quite drinkable little brew."
"Medium body mouthfeel and reasonable alcohol makes ths wonderfully drinkable."
"D- Highly drinkable despite its faults. Dangerous at 6.5% considering it would take a lot to feel full off of this. A fresher example may mask the vegetal character and improve the taste."
"Ranger India Pale Ale was a golden amber color with good clarity. It had a thick beige head with good retention and lacing. The aroma was mainly citrus. The taste was good, a bit of light malt upfront, but was mainly citrus with a little pine from the hops. It a had a nice bitterness coming through in the dry finish. Mouthfeel was good with a medium body and good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a fairly tame IPA, but overall it is a good beer."
"D - Outdoors IPA, piney and grassy. Not bad, but a little more pine than I wanted."
"Overall this is a good IPA that's worth seeking out."
"Overall this is a good IPA, plenty of hop aromas, flavors and a balanced bitterness. The malt base is just a tad light for me, more caramel malt would be nice but it's not bad. I would drink this again."
"D: decent IPA from new belgium that had a mild hop bite but drank well all the way through."
"I am not a huge New Belgium fan but this is worlds away from their other offerings. Very well done, Colorado."
"This offering from New Belgium makes me want to give this brewery another shot... WELL DONE!"
"D: The beer is solidly bitter despite its sweet and malty aspects and much of it's complexity is subtle, making food pairings troublesome - not because the beer won't go well with the food, but because the food will rob some of the complexity from the beer. Alone, this one is a treat and I have enjoyed it as a session beer, especially on a summer night."
"This beer would be great for those too timid to commit to a traditional IPA, because it truly has something for everyone."
"Having really enjoyed this on tap earlier this year I was excited to find this for only $2.99 a bomber (!) at Whole Foods in Los Gatos, CA. It shows a clear light amber color with a big frothy off-white head and plenty of lacing. The aroma brings solid grapefruit and toasted wheat almond malt. The flavor has plenty of crisp hop bite that's citrus and herbal in nature with a bright wheat sense to it. Some caramel vanilla and grass edges. Sort of unbalanced with malt charging through at times but overall it's a nice IPA that's very drinkable. It's about mid-bodied with a fairly effervescent feel."
"A very nice IPA that reminds me a lot of Goose Island's IPA and Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Though very pleasant and refreshing, the beer lacks the punch and fullness of flavor that now allows newer versions to stand out more."
"Overall, a good AIPA. Glad to see NBB stretch out a bit. I liked this but the never ending bitter would keep me from drinking more than one or two at a time. Do recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - worth the occasional single or 6 pack. Good BHT. [O;O;BHT]"
"Super-refreshing, and despite all the hoppiness, manages to feel balanced and drinkable at the same time. A must for hop-heads who don't necessarily need their tongues ripped off to rediscover their love for the magic flower. I'll go out on a limb here (or at least be true to the impression of my taste buds) and say Blind Pig IPA is overrated where this one is underrated. Might be my favorite beer by New Belgium too."
"Pours a light orange with a pretty nice white head that almost covers the top for the entire glass. Nose is citrus and caramel. A bit mild for my taste. Flavors are more of the same with the citrus dominating, a little bite of pine and carbonation, and then lighter caramel backbone with a reasonably dry finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and pleasant. A respectable IPA."
"Overall- overall a good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. I plan on buying this again and sharing with friends."
"Delightfully golden in colour like another Colorado brewery which is very infamous on this site. The nose is full of those sweet citrusy American hops that we all love so much. This two finger frothy white head dissipated while I was typing. Wonderful bittering on the sides and top of the palette. Brings to mind that hops possess all of the flavours of grapefruit and the like that I do not care for, but can't get enough of here. Many of you do not know the joy of enjoying a hoppy beer with the addition of facial hair i.e. a mustache. It delivers an extra bit of bite after your palette has already gotten over the joy of the alpha acids. The finish is clean and leaves a familiar taste of an IPA. Not an overly great version of an IPA, meaning not ""out there"". But, it is a fully solid one to stand up to any other. In short G-d bless the Imperical Brits who's undying thirst for beer in a far away land that they were oppressing who made this beer possible. See all good has to have some bad. Ying Yang."
"Seems to be built for a wider audience. Not much imagination here. It's ok. Nothing wring with it."
"This was a very enjoyable and solid, yet unremarkable IPA. Fairly pedestrian, slightly biscuity malt body with plenty of C-hops in the nose and flavor. Flavor has a balanced piney mild hop bite. Appearance is a clear dark amber with a fluffy off white bubbly head with nice streaks of lacing."
"D: Quaffable."
"Summary: I really like this beer. I would buy again. Love the balance of this beer. Quality from New Belgium."
"Drinkability: A bit lighter of an IPA than many, but still very good overall and one I would have again."
"D-Very nice beer overall and would be a good session offering. Worth trying again (and again depending on the occasion)."
"D- I could knock back a few of these and be very happy. The caramel malt basted flavors of New Belgium show up great in their version of an IPA. Its perfect for a nice hot evening, although don't saver to much before it starts to warm up and messes up the balance."
"D: Almost like an IPA 'light.' This isn't an awful beer, but it isn't going to blow your mind, either. A pretty basic, run-of-the-mill IPA."
"Pours a bit yellow with ample carbonation that settles rather quickly coating the sides of glass with lace. Clear. Netural aroma (wait: I'm catchign a bit of cedar). Methinks my bottle my not be so fresh. Peppery hops, little bits of malt, rather watery when cold, not so much as it warms up. Fairly solid bitter finish, but not quite what I was expecting. Lace sticks to the sides of the glass with each sip. Although not as impressed as the first time I had this beer, I will say that this is probably an excellent summertime IPA, as it seems very light in body and quite dry in the finish (drier than the saison I just sampled.) Fairly cheap at $3 for a 22-oz bottle."
"D- Very easy and enjoyable to drink. Very solid."
"Aftertaste is pleasant, lingering."
"Appearance is a lightly misty orange amber with a full head and good lace. Smell has a big wiff of floral hop, citrus with a grainy breadiness. Taste has a moderate hop bite with a slightly underbalanced malt with a watered down grapefruitiness. mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Maybe wouldn't be hoppy enough for the hop heads and not balance enough for me, but it does make for an easy drinking IPA"
"Taste: The fruity taste is there at first which leads nicely into a nice bitterness and then finishes off with a slight sweetness that doesn't completely counter the bitterness but compliments it really well."
"It poured a nice clear yellow with a hint of orange. A 3 finder head. I wasn't very careful with the pour though. You immediately smell the hops. Very piney with a touch of citrus. The flavor is just what you expect from the smell. Pine, pine, and more pine. Not that it's bad. It's exactly what I thought it would be, and it tastes good, but it's rather all one note. Still, it's good, and I'll enjoy the rest of the sixpack, then move on to something new."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability follow suit. Now that I've tried it, I can say, BTDT. At $4 for a bomber, I won't be trying this one anytime soon. I still would grab this one in favor of many choices out there, but as an IPA it is not one of my favorites."
"It can't truly be called Ranger because it didn't kick me or yell at me."
"Overall, a very good example of the style."
"D: A very drinkable bitter IPA,possibly a new favorite IPA"
"So how do I feel about this beer? It gives a very nice presentation and smells quite good, but it does feel a little one-note. Hopheads will enjoy this a lot, but to me it's a little too much like drinking liquid hop juice. Good, probably exactly the beer they intended to make, but far from great."
" Body is light and not at all sticky, which is a bit of a surprise for a hoppy IPA - I guess the resin got boiled out of the hops, or they used some extract. Regardless, it makes for a nice, easy-drinking IPA that's a bit short of a hop bomb, but can still hit the spot."
"Served from bottle into a Spaten mug. Poured a nice golden yellow with a one-finger white head that contained a nice rainbow effect on it, but subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. There was nice lacing apparent throughout. The aroma was comprised of only hops. The flavor was only comprised of hops with a very slight spicy note to it. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent IPA that was very light on the hoppy flavor. It could have been a great brew if it either had something to balance the hoppy flavor present or had more hops present. However this one is worth a shot for any hop-head out there who has not tried it."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Nice clear amber pour with nice fluffy white head and great lacing. Nice big nose with lots of grapefruit, pine and a hint of tea. Big bitter hop punch right off the bat. Citrusy grapefruit, and a bit of apricot, pine and grass. Great balance as the malty sweetness kicks in to subdue the hop punch. Nice crisp, dry finish makes this a hugely drinkable IPA. Not a huge fan of New Belgium, but hoping they keep this as a regular offering for us hop heads."
"This little gem was a clear medium amber in color with a single finger white head, nice thin lacing. Noted decent hoppy traits with a touch of piney/citrus on the nose. Light for an IPA but crisp. Was desent in carbonation, not too overbearing. A very delectable brew worthy of additional tastings."
"Loving the New Belgium mentality. This brew is a respectable stab at the AIPA but not in the same league as some of the other new belgium offerings."
"Hop bitterness is not one dimensional here, making for an extremely drinkable IPA. Very well done."
"While this isn't the highest quality IPA, it certainly is one of the most drinkable. I love IPAs and have had over forty different kinds but I find this as a good ""intro"" IPA for those willing to branch out. I've gotten several friends to make the transition to IPAs with this beer. I'd highly recommend this to novices as well as those who would like an IPA to drink for awhile."
"Very good, will definatly have this again!"
"If I'm considering the number of quality alternatives and thus being a bit harsh I'd say this: there is only a bit of caramel and more cascade and less amarillo separating this beer and the Mighty Arrow Pale Ale. Even the hop flavor, though increased, is not a ton different to my palate. Not a lot to differentiate them. The difference in IBUs barely shows up at all. Given the choice I'd go for the slightly less caramelly and barely less hoppy Pale Ale. But that's just me."
"D- Nice and drinkable, sits well on the tongue, fresh bitterness, balanced nicely, complex enough and deep in it's flavor and aroma...very nice IPA offering from NB."
"Not shy with the hops, this Ranger, and not overtly bitter either. Easy-drinking IPA. This is one I'll pick up often, bottle or tap."
"This is probably one of the most drinkable ipa's on the market, it's refreshing in aroma and flavor, has substantial malt for a solid body character while at the same time isn't so thick you can't drink more than a sip at a time."
"d - A smooth, subtle IPA with relatively low ABV. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good liking this one from New Belgium hope they get some of this in TN. doubtful but i can always hope. Would put this in my regular line up."
"D: Very drinkable for an IPA. Would gladly consume 2 more."
"M-D: The flavors go together very well. It leaves a bitter sensation on your tongue that gets you ready for the next sip! Therefore, it is a very smooth beer to drink."
"D: Very drinkable; flavorful and balance. Moderate ABV."
"22 ounce bottle, best before July 9, 2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention is very good, and there's lots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly pine and citrus hops with the addition of some bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, I thought it was enjoyable to drink. I think this is a decent overall IPA, definitely worth a try."
"D: A pretty impressive brew: flavorful with a sturdy body and lovely look. This falls in my upper echelon of NBB brews, 'drinkable' to a fault. I'll have this again and I'd recommend a try to anyone."
"D - This is a wonderfully drinkable IPA that has the best of hop flavor without the bitterness of some IPA's that just try to be hop bombs."
"D- So easy to drink this beer it is scary. Only 6.5% and not assertive so really one of the best session IPA's I have had."
"Drinkability>Easy"
"HV"
"Blonde color (a little light for an IPA), but great foam. Great bitterness, but very drinkable. Very affordable for a craft brew. I've also had this on tap at Mission Pizza, and it was even better on tap. Most definitely Recommended."
"overall: yea did I get a bad batch or something? its not the beer I first had. I was thinking that I would give this a A- but yea its not that good at least this bottle."
"Overall a nice complex and hop forward ale."
"D: very drinkable."
"Drinkability- Not a bad beer would buy again but would probably try to find a better IPA"
"A: Medium gold in color with a persistent thin layer of head on top, crystal clear - 4.25, S: Strong and intense hop aromas - lots of pine and citrus as well as some slightly floral smells, very subtle sweetness, quintessential American IPA nose - 4.50, T: Very pleasing hop bite, grapefruit and mild orange, as the beer warms a stronger citrusy zest appears, also resiny and with a noticeable caramel bite, nicely balanced IPA - 4.00, M: Mouth feel has an almost powdery like smoothness - 3.50, D: All around a very nicely crafted American IPA and one I would add to my regular rotation if it was readily available - 4.00"
"Crystal clear pale golden color with a huge fluffy white head that fell slowly leaving generous lacing on the glass. Aroma is ripe with fresh orange and grapefruit peel, with a touch of malt underneath it all, a bit herbal and spicy, but really no sweetness and not much enjoyable hop aroma emanating from the glass. Taste is dry, herbal, and with average bitterness. Kind of disappointed that this one doesn't have as much hop flavor as I usually like. Nothing in the way of juicy fruitiness, just dry bitter, peppery hops. This is not the style of IPA that I enjoy most. Malt flavor is barely there, only a dry cracker-like quality. Underwhelming. Light bodied, dry, medium carb, dull, boring. Not getting into this one. It's by no means a drain pour, but it's boring as hell. It seems like breweries are making IPAs just to make IPAs these days. NB should stick to their sours."
"All in all a good beer, but nothing really makes it stand out. There are IPAs I would rather have, but I wouldn't be disappointed to have this again."
"This is the type of IPA I could expect from New Belgium. Not super aggressive, though certainly a beer I can enjoy and newbies can too."
"Drinkability is very high. I can get this one all the time now and for the price it is well worth it."
"Flavor start out nice for about half a second and switches into this weird dirty hop flavor, aftertaste is just not good, dirty old hop flavors stick, in the mouth. For such a promising start this thing really falls off a cliff."
"You all might like it."
"D- Overall, the asparagus aspect to this really killed it. Not gross though."
"This is a great beer brewed with taste and, compared to current trends, welcome moderation. Not the most creative beer in the world, but a possible go-to IPA."
"Taste is mostly grapefruit with hops. Not any or maybe a little malt. The depth of taste is lacking yet the beer is pretty refreshing. Very good carbonation on the tongue and is about perfect. This beer is very easy to drink but lacks the different flavors and balance I see in others."
"Poured into a 24oz plastic cup, no head. Lots of floral citrus aromas. The mouth feel has some carbination but it blends with the flavor. There's a strong grapefruit presence. certain sips almost taste spiced like bitting on a peppercorn. There's definitely nothing new to this beer except that the brewery finally made an IPA. Points for effort, and a good effort from a large brewery. As far as a widely distributed IPA goes it's good and cheap, not the bestm but by no means the worst. This is an example of a popular brewery bringing more styles to the masses, an attempt to convert more people to craft beer. If this replaced fat tire everywhere i went, i'd be stoked."
"Maybe next time?"
"It could have more hop bouquet but that is my only knock on this well made IPA. at >6% it is a good dont drive home after a 6 pack IPA."
"Ranger IPA (at a whopping 6.5%) wouldn't have appeared in this state a mere month ago. I'm glad it's here, but Mighty Arrow is the better beer. Looks like Big Sky IPA is still the best IPA available in Iowa. Almost forgot, we now have Two Hearted. Lucky us."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D-this is a pretty tasty brew, a good bit of hops but a little balanced, more than I would like. It is a little thin and has too much carb in my opnion."
"Other comments: This is a great little IPA. Nicely balanced and very drinkable. Having tried the 12oz version and the 22oz, there's something a bit more flavorful in the larger one. Not sure if that's mental or if they bottle it differently."
"Note: Watch Out! the ABV will catch up to you after a few of them."
"Note: Overall I really liked this beer. I liked the balance very much and think that New Belgium interpreted the style quite well. I will definitely be coming back to this one. Probably my new 'go to' IPA since the price and taste are so compelling."
"Beer poured a clear golden orange with a nice fluffy head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose has hints of floral and citrus hops. Taste is a light biscuit backbone, grapefruit, with a residual piney dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is good. This is a solid drinkable IPA that is a bit beyond sessionability. But I can see this at a tailgate this fall!"
"D-The lack of balance and dryness of this beer negatively impact its drinkability for me. I am glad I tried it, but I doubt I will drink it again."
"Light amber with a small head producing very little lace. Understated floral hops in the aroma. Front end is grassy and citrusy. Lighter body than one would expect from the style. Drinks like a very understated West Coast IPA, almost a compromise between West Coast and East Coast styles. Moderately bitter back end."
"D - Decent drinkability. ABV, while not extreme, will certainly get to you. Not filling. Bitterness does begin to rip up the palette."
"D- I can keep drinking these as long as the one before it is done. Its fresh tasting, doesn't make me feel like I'm going to explode, and not too heavy on the alcohol. So yes in terms of liking a beer that you can just keep on drinking and enjoying in large or small quantities, I loved it."
"A nice IPA from NB...not world class, but solid"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Ranger is a clear, deep golden color with a frothy, soapy white head. The nose is all hops, west coast citrus with Simcoe, Cascade and Chinook being present. There is perhaps just a hint of a lightly toasted malt background, otherwise hops dominate. Reminds me of fresh plug hops straight out of the package. The flavor is also all hops but not quite a hop bomb. Nice citrusy pressence, grapefruit, lemon and pine resin all present and pretty much all that is discernable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a frothy carbonation and slightly drying mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable beer, well done and reasonably balanced. Not a hop bomb but doesn't dissapoint either."
"D - Ranger is a sessionable splendor for all you hopinistas. Thank your Beer Ranger!"
"Reviewed on 04.22.2010"
"D: Could surely have a few of these and be happy."
"This is a well balanced bitter IPA that will not scare some friends away from enjoying."
"D= Nicely drinkable. Its better on tap but also very good from the bottle."
"Decent, not earthshattering. If you are in the mood for a dry, more herbal take on the style, this is for you. It's not quite how I like my IPAs, but it's by no means bad. Nevertheless, not bad isn't as good as, well...good, and there's both good and great IPAs available around here. Consequently, I shan't need to get this again unless at a very cheap price."
"Notes: The flavor is here, but its just too bitter for the amount of flavor that is there. They need to up the hop flavor to match the intensity and then it would be really good."
"An easy drinker, definitely could knock back a few. A pretty good price point for what it is too."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and adequately carbonated. I could drink this one everyday, a very solid AIPA."
"I enjoyed this beer with a platter of wings, half lemon pepper, half jerk seasoning. The brightness of the hops played off of the lemon, celery and jerk spice, while the slight bitterness cut the heat of the wings...the smoothness of the beer complimented the cool ranch dressing just right. A decent brew for those wanting a more substantial IPA experience."
"D - A nice, balanced IPA with great hop character, especially in the aroma. There is a nice balance in the finish with a subtle dryness that helps to emphasize the hop character."
"Copper/red, yellow in color. Notes of hops in the aroma, with hints of herbs and fruit on the end. Initially mild on the palate, but then turns real herbal, and really dries out the tongue. Some metallic notes were picked up the finish. Overall, very dry and not well balanced."
"Pours a woody tan with a thin beige head. Nose has sweet candy malts and light grassy hops. Taste is quite malty with again a mellow hop presence. Lots of toffee and camael. Body finishes a bit light. I'd call it more of an English IPA than American."
"very drinkable, a session IPA. enjoyable and doesnt challange doesnt offend"
"This beer might score more favorably as an Amber Ale. As an IPA? Nope."
"Some decnt hop tones, not biscuity like their other stuff, but the balance is decent. Medium mouth feel-easy drinker overall."
"Light copper. Tiny head. Faint grassy smell. Taste is very smooth and original for an ipa. We all know by now that I love a good punch in the mouth with hops, but this beer has it's place. Plus I'll get that punch later with the Elder. The closest comparison I can give this brew to is Lagunitas Ipa. Has a much differnt mouthfeel to it though. Overall it's worth a try, and I'll come back for more when ever I need to break up the monotony. Well done Mr. Red Bicycle!"
"I could drink this beer all summer, if only, if only it was available here in New England."
"Drinks easily and smoothly. I'm satisfied with one, but having another would not be a problem."
"Bottom Line- I would say try it don't shy away from it. There are better options out there but if you come across this and there isn't anything better go for it. For an IPA it is very unintrusive and quite easy on the pallete. A good starter beer to pull someone into the world of craft."
"A decent IPA, but nothing to write home about. Definatley lacking in the nose for what a great IPA should be. Neither pungent nor largely floral. I'd certainly like to try an unfiltered version or a dry-hopped cask though."
"Pours a foamy light bright white head. The aroma is fantastic -- just flowing off the head. The taste is a mouthful of hops but no bitterness at all. It's a wonderful balance of goodness. Highly highly recommended. NB has mastered the IPA! Can't believe it only gets a B+."
"Served in a small pint style glass, this IPA is a clear golden orange with a big tan head that fades quickly. Smell is not quite as pungent as some IPA's but I detect a nice herbal hop note. Taste is sweet malt up front, then a massive apricot flavor, herbal and earthy hops in the middle, reminding me of black pepper, and a balanced sweet/bitter finish. A hint of citrus, but the hop flavor is mostly herbal and earthy. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly high carbonation. Good drinkability. Not a hop bomb like many American IPA's, this beer is more balanced, but a good example of the style that I would get again."
"Well, I'm not having the best of beer evenings, yet. This is far too 'balanced' for me, I'd love to have a livelier hop presence in this brew. As is, the malts are more of the focus. Decent enough brew, but not my thing."
"D: A good, solid IPA with a very nice price tag. Well-constructed, but I wish the hopbill wasn't such a snoozer."
"Nice beer. Herad rumors that this tasted liek fat tire with extra hops. not true. it was a basic IPA and probably a great IPA for someone starting but I liked the interesting flavors. some sublte malt sweetness that balanced well with the sublt bitterness of the hops. A nice chnage of pace for the hop deaths I usually drink."
"D-This beer is extremely drinkable but because it's 6.5% alcohol I would not want to have more than three of these in one evening. I highly recommend this to any true hop lover."
"Excellent brew!! The appearance was what to expect from the style. The smell was very inviting with a strong hint of hops and some citrusy notes. The taste was good just not as good as some of the other IPA's I have tried. The mouthfeel was nice with a sort of dry finish but it has a really nice drinkability and before you know it have a finished a six pack!!"
"D-This beer is borderline delicious. I've enjoyed this one ina couple different venues and have continued to enjoy it each time. Although I'm confused/saddenned to see New Belgium kind of depart from their Belgian roots in this one, I've certainly gotten over that qualm quickly with how tasty this brew is."
"Drinkability: A nice example of an American IPA. Super-heavy on the hops, a good beer for hop heads. I would get again, and I will definitely have the opportunity. According to my beer rep, NB is pushing this hard, giving it preference over Fat Tire. It should be here for a while."
"Nice big body on this American IPA, a big substantial feel but not a filling beer. Well done by New Belgium."
"D: Tasty, but not something I am going to buy a lot of. Good, not amazing."
"Overall a really good beer for the dollar. I probably wouldn't pay much more for it but at that price i will be buying more. Good to have on hand to give to friends so they wont get into the expensive stuff."
"Pours a typical good looking brown/amber IPA color. Thick off-white head and lacing. Smell is very fruity and herbal. Wet grass. Sweet and musty. This is an IPA with a very strong fruity citrusy character. If that is your thing you will love this. Personally the tangerine/orange/grapefruit sweet and sourness gets to be a little much and makes it hard for me to enjoy more than one or two. I prefer a more straight forward clean bitter flavor with more of a malt backbone in an IPA. That being said, it is plenty bitter in the finish. I get that nice little back of the throat burn that I was looking for. Very well made example of my favorite style, just not the best one in my opinion."
"What a great beer! this beer holds a beautiful tight head that sits perfectly on top of a clean copper body. The beer throws spring and fresh pine growth in my face. Very refreshing and crisp! The way this beer lingers and whispers ""drink more"" on my palate tells me this is a great session beer you should enjoy with people you care about."
"Drinkability: Good. You can drink this all night."
"Drinkability: easy drinking IPA. Worthy of a look as this hits the spot for the stlye."
"Overall - This will be one of my ""staples"" to have on keg or in the refrigerator at all times. I like the balance of malts and hops with a mouthfeel that is thinner than many IPAs."
"decent IPA, would like to see more hop complexity. pretty easy to drink but started going downhill as it warmed to room temp."
"Slainte."
"From a 22 oz bomber purchased locally. Aroma is hoppy, slightly flowery. A clear gold color with a nice tight white creamy head. Clean malt with a bit of biscuit/toast character and a firm bitterness in the background, not overpowering. Hop flavor is more on the earthy side, and again not over the top. Crisp and dry, and very easy drinking. Not an over-the-top beer, but well made and sessionable."
"good price for sixer... cheers."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and the drinkability was great. It is crisp, without an overwhelming bitterness. It's quite mild and balanced but has some good flavor and I was able to throw down a couple pints."
"Got around to trying New Belgium's IPA, it is well crafted and a solid beer. More on the balanced side than super bitter, quite tasty."
"Nice to have a beer with some more hops from New Belgium. It is pretty tasty; nothing to write home about but a good solid offering. Not over-the-top in the hop department, but still solidly an IPA and not an APA. Pretty affordable too. I'm sure I'll pick more of these up from time to time."
"D- very drinkable. not sure why I was expecting more of an entry level IPA from New Belgium but this was a little more than that. enjoyed it."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden copper color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt note, citrus, caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, bitter, some malts, and a nice dose of citrus, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty IPA, glad I had a chance to try it."
"D: Good hoppy flavor, but it could be hoppier. It's a bit sweeter than other IPAs. This beer has good flavor but it's not very strong. Not my favorite, but something that is definitely drinkable."
"Pours a clear and pale blonde color with visibly high carbonation supporting the thin and lacy white colored head. The carbonation emits a light and vague sweet hoppy aroma. The flavor is tart and sharp citrus bitterness which is a little out of balance but flows quickly with the light body. The finish is quick and tart but fades into a clean end. Good summer session drinkablity."
"Overall I probably won't buy this one again. I have access to way better IPA's so there will be no need to buy this one again."
"Overall a good release by New Belgium. Not their best, possibly expected more, but still a solid B+ or so."
"Good, balanced, restrained version of west coast IPA. Not exceptional or remarkable, but certainly good and easy drinking."
"D: I'd love for this to be a regular offering."
"This is a lovely medium bodied beer that is leaning towards the lighter side of things. The hops are big enough to have plenty of flavor, taste and bitterness while the grains make a smooth easy drinking beer. Simple and tasty well worth checking out. This is a solid IPA that has enough personality to make it a great beer."
"At 6.5 ABV, I am not sure one would drink more than a couple at one time. Initially the flavor seemed very bitter and one dimensional. However, the malt does come into play to give it balance. This is one for the hop lover."
"Overall a decent IPA with balanced malt and hop. Comes off very 'green'."
"Ranger is a decent IPA...it doesn't excel in it's category, but the hops are showcased fairly well, though I perceive a touch of diacetyl in the finish, plus there is a unusual sweetness that drops in at the end that ruins the hop character. The finishing bitterness is quite harsh, with an almost metallic character. ***The last two bottles of this beer have been sitting in my fridge for over 3 months now. I just can't bring myself to drink them when I have FAR batter IPAs in there. That to me is indicative of the quality of this beer....it's just really not good. Consequently....lowering my grade."
"While this is a well crafted IPA and a fairly good example of the style, it is in no way a stellar beer that stands out and seperates itself from the hundreds of other good/decent IPA's. Unfortunately I think this beer may tend to get lost in the pack..."
"Overall this is a compelling aromatic IPA. I quite like it."
"D - This is very drinkable because it is not too high in bitterness."
"Drinkability: If you like bitter IPA's this one's got 70 IBU. Very drinkable, you can easily drink several over the course of a night. I would happily have another, but not my personal favorite IPA. A very good beer none-the-less. A different taste than I am used to from New Belgium, but you won't hear me complaining! A good solid beer."
"D: Good drinkability but not interesting enough to want more than one of."
"D- For me, I can't drink a whole one. Too too too much sticky bitterness, not for me."
"D- Very drinkable. I am not a huge IPA fan but this one is very good. I enjoy Alpha King more but this is a close second for a hoppy beer."
"Very easy drinking, especially on a hot day. A decent IPA at an attractive price...worth a try."
"Drinkability is okay, the soapy and bitter qualities of the hops got fatiguing...I wish it would have tasted like it smelled, still a decent IPA, but not really my taste."
"Pretty plus minus beer. If you just look at it and smell it then it is exceptional. The moment it passes the lips and then goes down your throat it lets you down a lot."
"D- as I said this will be on tap at my house within the week. Very drinkable..."
"Not bad, but there are better IPAs out there that I would rather throw my dollars at."
"Poured a super clear copper color with a decent white head from a bomber into a pint glass. The smell is mostly of lemony hops with a bit of bready malts. Taste is mostly piney grassy hops, nothing too extraordinary here, this is a decent very drinkable beer but in my opinion there are much IPA's out there."
"Ranger is an appropriate title because of the comparisons to the piney hop resins the hops used impart. i like this offering..it seems raw and a bit untamed and is definitely a different and unique take on the american IPA style."
"D- This is a solid beer and will be a permanent lineup in the New Belgium ""EXPLORE"" series. It is not a ""seasonal"" as others have alluded to. This will be a very good summer session beer for the IPA lovers. I was a solid Sierra Nevada customer (how can you go wrong at $11.99 12 pack) but this beer is lighter, crisper and has way more of that west coast citrus style at half the price. Bombers under $3.50 this is a very good beer for the price."
"Drinkability - Pretty good/drinkable. At three dollars for a 22oz bomber you really can't go wrong for the price and it has a nice little alcohol kick to it (which you can't taste - it isn't that potent but decent from a more mainstream brewer such as NB). Pretty good, but honestly, when there is Pliny at the same store I got this at, I'd rather spend a dollar fifty more to get that. If I needed to bring an IPA to a party and nothing else was readily available (which definitely could be the case) I would for sure bring this. Good session beer."
"D: pretty good. I'd have it again, but there are many I'd choose over this one"
"D - This IPA is very drinkable, I loved it's load of hop flavor without being too bitter. I could easily drink 2-3 or more pints of this fantastic brew, I would of liked a bit more malt presence as I expected coming from New Belgium. I would definitely buy this one again though, very refreshing and very flavorful. Cheers!"
"Chewy medium body that is on the lighter end ifthe spectrum with a lot of dry sweet hops up front that linger trought over the sweet caramel and biscuit malt backbone into a dry finish. Similar to the nose, the flavor has a lot of citrus and tropical fruity notes. Lots of mango, pineapple and orange peel. Subtle alcohol presence toward the end of the palate but overall the ABV is pretty well masked and this beer is very quaffable."
"Libation: I really like the overall profile and it really delivers enough hops to satisfy most hopheads despite being a mere 6.5% ABV IPA and not a strong DIPA. I'll be having more of these in the future for sure."
"Mouthfeel was light/medium body with carbonation. Not much of a finishing mouthfeel."
"The medium body has a smooth and slick feel before a somewhat dry finish. The drinkability is, as usual from NB, fantastic. It didn't tear my pants off, but it was a solid great tasting IPA that's definitely worth a stab."
"Ok drinker, expected more from these guys, doesn't stand up to Furious, or Two Hearted, much deep tastes, this is just ok."
"Well, it's just so light, that it does go down real easy, despite not being an amazing beer. Really more of an extra pale ale. It doesn't necessarily feel like a dumbed down beer, but in trying to be unique it really doesn't share too much with the style. I maybe was harsh on the taste score, but this is where the big boys come out to play. This is not a repeat buy, especially since the price point is not much better when looking at sixers (even though I can't find bombers of any kind of hoppy beers at this price). I've scored the last few NB beers I've had pretty well, but this doesn't quite hit the value/quality sweet spot."
"Beers on me Graff!!!"
"Really surprised by this one, as I am only aware of New Belgium for their ""Belgian"" style beers - expectations were low and they were blown out of the water. Will definitely be getting more of these."
"This is a bright gold color, crystal clear, with a modest head. Plenty of hops in the nose for a standard IPA, with resinous, slightly citrus notes. Light malt quickly gives way to a lot of hop flavor, with a more prominent citrus. Lightly fruity yeastiness adds a nice touch at the finish. Very light bodied, though that aids in making this a quite quaffable beer."
"D-It's pretty easy drinking but I'm looking for more bitterness and less malt forwardness in an IPA."
"D - Very easy to pound this one."
"D - Although I'm not generally New Belgium's biggest fan, this is really a pretty solid, nicely balanced IPA. Nice hop flavor, as well as the body and balance lend this one a high drinkability. One of the better beers I've tried from NB so far."
"Drinkability: I'm actually finding this quite drinkable indeed. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a six pack of this in the future."
"D - This is a decent enough IPA, but the flavor just doesn't deliver the aroma. Perhaps it needs a touch more bitterness as well. Unfortunately, it seems like a very average IPA though."
"Kind of a autumnal, golden color with a little bit of a white foam cap. Loses points for lack of head retention but looks OK overall. Aroma is pleasant with a nice smack of dried orange peel and grapefruit with a little bit of a resiny pine aroma. The aroma was promising but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor. Too much of the rind/peel factor and not enough of the actual fruit flavors. It struck me as pretty bitter (more than I expected anyway) which is neither good nor bad just an observation. I will say that I felt it needed a bit more malt to balance out the bitterness and more of the juicy fruit flavors as opposed to the earthier orange peel/pine type notes. Mouthfeel was OK but maybe a bit undercarbonated. A bit of an unpleasant finish in my estimation. In general I think this beer was OK and while I didn't like it, it may be right up somebody else's alley so I'd recommend trying it but I think there are many better IPAs on the market."
"Overall, a decent IPA and definitely a decent beer for the price. Drinkable and good for the style. I wouldn't mind another."
"D - this is a really good IPA. I had no problem not wanting to finish the 750ml bottle. I didn't know what to expect from NB, given that I haven't had an IPA by them, but they did a really nice job with this one. Definitely worth a try, especially given the price point."
"Tasty, but at this price point, not a repeat purchase."
"This was one of the weakest IPA's I have ever tasted. Most pale ales have more hops than this beer. But it is a good interduction into IPA for people who have never tried one before, since it is smooth and easy to drink. I am not a fan but I can see how people would like this anyway"
"This is a nice example of an IPA. For those who prefer herbal, pine and bitter notes then this is the beer for you. I think I like a bit more fruit in my hop balance though & I don't think I will be replacing my easy hop fix of Sierra Nevada Torpedo with this beer."
"M/D: Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. A solid AIPA."
"D- I get a good, clean vibe from this beer but it doesn't have enough going for it to beat out it's competition."
"Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a medium light that has a smooth feel to it."
"Drinkability - Boy was I impressed with this beer. I do like the big hop bombs I'll admit but I can also appreciate a well-balanced and thoughtful effort such as this New Belgium sample. This is a very refined class act and a must-taste for any true IPA fan."
"Overall: Very Odd flavors. They don't really meld well. The bitterness and malt flavor is balanced, but the hop flavors are very strange. I seems to me the ""Rangers"" whoever they are would be dissapointed."
"i'm certain you'll enjoy this hoppy brew...i enjoyed this beer while discussing a business idea with my wife to make hair pieces...cheers"
"Bomber pours into my glass. Light orange in color with a moderately hefty white head that is dense with high retention that is both thick and leaves abundant lacing. Aromas is fruity with pear and grapefruit, bright flora with a pleasant sweetness. Hops are not too intense, but very nice balance between them and also with the malt. Smells maltier than it looks, then it ends up tasting hoppier than it smells. Grapefruit and pine explode on the palate with a great full bitterness for a floral and slight cookie finish that is fairly dry. This one totally exceeds my expectations in the flavor department. This is a serious IPA. Full prickly carbonation, though a tad on the lighter side in body, the only issue that prevents this beer from being a straight up ""A" quality. Drinkability is high, this is an extremely solid IPA I will gladly drink in the future. Good on you, New Belgium."
"12 oz single. Average looking IPA.Light orange/gold with a good sized bubbly white head. Resiny, hop aromas,little herbal and lemony. Sweet lemon drop hopping, light malts balance..shortish finish for an IPA. Liked the palate..zesty and refreshing. Overall an average IPA on the lighter side of the style."
"I didn't have high hopes for this, so thankfully I wasn't let down. Unfortunately New Belgium just doesn't hit my standard. I think it's a drinkable IPA, and probably a good starter IPA for the young hopolytes, but this just doesn't cut it compared to so many other breweries' IPAs."
"This is a surprisingly strong flavored IPA. Unfortuanately, I don't think it's particulatly well balanced and is strong in areas of taste that I do not particularly care for. So if you really enjoy peppermint and pine, then you should love this one."
"Ranger was drinkable and I would get it again on tap but never before any of the others mentioned. Not to slight Colorado or Fort Collins to be more specific, I could drink Odell ipa everyday. Unfortunately none in Cali."
"Overall, this was a very disappointing experience from a beer that I had really been anticipating trying. This is a very fresh bottle but there are no hops to be found anywhere, which is a big no-no in an IPA. It's not a bad beer by any means, but there are quite a few IPA's I would reach for before this one."
"Definitely worth a taste when a mouthful of good hops are the goal, but the bitterness stays with you long after the memory of the aroma is gone. OK, it's 70 IBU. New Belgium is kind enough to let us know the hops in question are Simcoe, Cascade, and Chinook."
"This is no Bells Two Hearted but it's one of the better IPAs available in my area. I'll be keeping this one around on occasion."
"Body is pretty light and easy-drinking, but a harsh, salty bitterness settles in the throat, making for mouthfeel characteristics that I don't enjoy. The combination of strange flavors and the unpleasant mouthfeel didn't make this a good drinking experience. Drainpour."
"Poured this from the bottle into a nice rounded snifter. Ample white head that laces very well and dissipated down to a crown slowly. Aroma is bountiful from the initial pour all the way to the bottom. Pine is the initial hop aroma, with citrus following to sweeten the scent. Taste is a very bitter pine initially with the sweet citrus following. Feel is very crisp, almost a bit dry with ample carbonation. Light to medium body, and an oily finish. Extremely drinkable, and enjoyable. Overall a great India Pale Ale."
"Very easy to drink but not one you'd want to gulp down fast just because you can. 2.5/3 cheers for New Belgium's IPA attempt, nothing special but still durn yummy."
"Very drinkable and balanced, but would prefer a little more hop bitter bite to it. Still, easy drinking a nice addition to the NB lineup."
"Medium/carb, light mouth feel, and creamy. Good for the style. Highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Definitely unique. Well put together too. Still, I don't know if I'd buy this IPA again. It's nice, but I can't imagine myself drinking this all the time. Maybe Ranger just isn't the IPA for me."
"Dry on the tongue and pallate. Dry finish and starkly bitter. A really nice example of the style that certainly lends toward the bitter end. I am all about the bitterness! Hard to beat for the price. Bought a six pack and will easily breeze through this one."
"Burnt orange body with dandelion accents when held to a light source. Dirty white head leaves webs of lace as I drink. . Nice citrusy aroma with grapefruit and tangerine the main players. Subtle and sweet caramel malt aroma too. Nice pungent hoppiness on the buds. Not quite as bright as the nose was leading me to believe. Some bitter pithy grapefruit tones and resinous, smoky residuals. Meidum full body with moderate carbonation. Solid enough IPA."
"The twelve ounce bottle makes it an easy beer to sip on during a weeknight."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight earthly malt, strong floral hops, sweet malt, and citrus (pomegranate). Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, earthy malt, sweet malt, and citrus. Overall, great appearance with a good body and blend."
"Perhaps my palate has grown to accustomed to west coast IPAs, but Ranger lost points with me because of its style label. If NB advertised it as a PA, my review would probably reflect that in a stronger score."
"This beer tastes very much like the first batch of Mighty Arrow that I got from the brewery a couple years ago. I like their Belgian beers, but I don't care for this one."
"D: This is a drinkable beer with some solid characteristics, but don't expect too much from it."
"D: An easy drinking IPA, but there are certainly a lot better examples out there. That said, it's nice to see New Belgium putting some more beers out there."
"Nice finish. Juicy at the end."
"D: This pitcher was an easy kill and enjoyable. It does have a good amount of earthiness to it along with all that pine, probably why we have the Ranger name. Its not the greatest IPA out there but its good. With the price of a six pack of this, I can see this venturing into my fridge from time to time. Not bad at all."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a very nice frothy off-white head that lasts and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight citrus hops in front of some mild sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of lingering bitter citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent carbonation and slight dryness. This is a very enjoyable IPA, one I could certainly see myself picking up again."
"D - This brew is like the classic example of IPA-ness. If you were trying to explain beer styles to someone new to craft beer, I can think of ""classic"" examples of many styles and this would definitely (along with something like Two Hearted) be the best example of what an IPA should be. Excellent stuff!"
"I met this beer one stormy Saturnday night. It was raining so hard that it was impossible to find my car. Ranger offered me a ride home. I couldn't stop looking at it from the corner of my eye. It was so damn beautiful. And it smelled great, too. As the traffic lights passed us by and we made our way West, a strange feeling overtook me: I wanted a taste. But how to proceed? I thought about it for awhile, and as we pulled up to my building and Ranger turned off the engine I lunged with no hesitation. And it was magnificent. Citrusy, piney, with just the right amount of malt backing up the sweet punch to my senses. I awoke the next day to an empty bed, but with a phone number written on a napkin and placed beneath my pillow. Will I wait two days? No."
"D: Well-balanced and approachably bitter, any hopinista worth their IBUs will appreciate Ranger IPA's exceptional drinkability."
"it's eminently drinkable. goes right down (unless you want it to). the hopping is wonderful but what else do i have to work with?"
"Drinkability is excellent, it's not too heavy and I really liked it. From the bottle it too was good (not as good as draft) but for $2.99 a 22oz it's really a deal."
"The taste was hoppy and citrusy and just bitter enough. Slightly sweet, smooth finish. Unlike some other reviewers, i dont find it dry at all. Nice tasting burps, if that makes sense."
"D: An easy drinker, but with the odd flavor profile, I have little desire to try this again."
"I was honestly expecting a lot more from this beer. Very hoppy taste. The color is great for an India Pale Ale. Right away you can smell the cascade hops which it smells like its been dry hopped. One I will try again in a couple of months. Hopefully I bought an older six pack"
"D: Its okay, I guess. Something about it makes me want to take another sip right away, but I can't really see drinking more than one or two in a sitting. Actually, the more I drink this beer, the less I want of it."
"Drinkability is high. I hope this one stays in the New Belgium rotation, good flavorful IPA that isn't too heavy, and is quite easy to drink."
"drinkability: high"
"Overall: I'd rate this as an above average IPA. It's not something I'll actively seek out but I'll finish my six pack and won't consciously avoid it in the future."
"D: decent drinkability due to clean flavorvand moderate abv. Nothing terribly compelling, either, though"
"+ a solid IPA. bitter, yet balanced. not overly strong on hops or bitterness, but with enough distinction to be recognizable. i've spent a bit of time with Ranger over the past few weeks. it's coming close to being a favorite."
"Definitely a surprise here from New Belgium. I like Fat Tire, but I haven't been super impressed with their other offerings. This one, however, is definitely a good settle IPA. Looks great with some incredible white head that laces with the best of them. Color is pretty too, a nice golden oak color, with plenty of tiny bubbles rising up from the bottom. The nose isn't too powerful, some pine and maybe lemon zest notes, though the lack of strength could be due to the density of the head. Taste is pretty good for a decent IPA, simple caramel malt, piney hops, a bit of herbal hops, and that's about it. Not too much to think about, though it's exactly what I wanted--a simple, easy-drinking IPA. MF is medium to light-bodied, smooth, a bit dry on the finish. Drinkability is huge, a great session beer, though definitely not my favorite IPA. A good go-to when you want something above Sam Adams, but don't want to shell out some $$ for Two Hearted or other really good IPAs. I think I would prefer Torpedo to it, however (though similarly priced)."
"Overall, a good, sharp IPA that needs some tweaking. I would like this if it had more body, and a more complex, fruity flavor. Otherwise, New Belgium has produced another quality year round offering."
"Drinkability - As an IPA, probably not. I have a large list of IPAs that I would have on a regular basis. This beer's similarity to a pale ale would put in consideration if I wanted that, but alas - I'll just stick with an IPA. On that note, this isn't a bad beer - just more of a pale ale. 3.0/5.0"
"D: Pleasant, crisp and highly drinkable. Even at 6.5% is still very sessionable. Not my favorite IPA but will definitely be drinking again."
"While this may disappoint those who want a bitterness that burns, this has delighted me. I cao actually have a six-pack of this!"
"D: Fairly drinkable, maybe i'm just not a huge new belgium fan but this is pretty weak for an ipa all around save for the appearance, had high hopes upon pouring but thats where it ended for this one."
"I like the new look of the label, but the beer itself was disappointing. Thin body, no malt backbone. It tastes like fizzy hop water. The hop character is funky in every way - nose, bitterness and flavor. Perhaps a little more malt to back up the hops would help, but it's not a good beer at the moment. I like balance in beer in general, and especially in hoppy beers. This one doesn't deliver."
"Nose has a pleasant orangey citrus character with some citrusy candies in the background. Flavors on the palate aren't overwhelming, but that's a refreshing change - plenty of pine, some orange, and toasty malt to round it out. Finish is prickly orange with pine. Easy drinking."
" ~ Overall this is a beer that I feel I could drink sessionally once the warmer months begin. I like the flavors and think New Belgium Brewery has done a nice job with this hop filled brew."
"Very well done, New Belgium."
"Flavor is similar, herbal with a pleasant juicy cantaloupe sweetness carrying through the middle into a drier finish. Pretty easygoing and light bodied, sessionable. A sweet deal for a $2.69 bomber."
"Just a pleasant beer to drink. I like this better than the other New Belgium offering I've had, Fat Tire, but that could be because I really appreciate IPAs more. Still, this is a pretty drinkable IPA that is pretty flavorful and light on your tongue. Good stuff."
"Verdict: Tasty and very drinkable, Ranger is a solid addition to the New Belgium lineup. It may not be the most intense IPA out there, but it still works nicely."
"Overall, an OK IPA - it's nice to see one from NB. It's pretty mild in terms of alcohol and bitterness. I really don't care for the biscuit notes in many of New Belgium's beers. I'm not really digging the hop flavors either. More fruitiness or resin would be good for me."
"Light-ish bodied with a relatively high amount of CO2. Generally balanced, but the hops deliver enough dryness to make it a session option. However, there's nothing very dynamic here, and it results in a middle of the road IPA. The more I drink this, the more I think it is plain boring."
"This is very drinkable for me and my tastes. I look forward to getting more and seeing how a six pack goes down, because im having no issues knocking a bottle back and wishing i had another one ready to go. Sure there are better IPAs out there, but i suspect you would be hard pressed to find a better one with the availability and distribution that this one has. I highly recommend this to hopheads, it may be a touch too aggressive for the newbies."
"Comes out of the tap a clear, golden amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head that sticks around for a while. Rich aroma is strongly hoppy and evergreen, promising a seriously hoppy IPA. Fiercely hoppy and somewhat bitter flavor lives up to the aroma - drinking this beer is like drinking a liquid pine tree. Texture has a strong bite and is fizzy and smooth, leaving a nice hoppy and slightly bitter finish."
"Medium bodied, smooth and decently drinkable."
"OK, I am kind of a New Belgium butt-kisser. I have not found much fault with anything they do out there in Fort Collins. This is definitely one step beyond the recent release of Mighty Arrow. I think this one may grow on me more than that did."
"Really don't enjoy slamming a beer, because there are so many good beers, great brewers, and it's a tough gig. But, this is a major letdown."
"This is a decent, fairly unremarkable, IPA. It has a little bit of the resiny, oniony hop flavor that I don't like, and the aroma is a little thin, but otherwise it's a pretty solid beer. It has a nice mix of citrusy and earthy hops, and enough malt to make it all work. It has a great, bitter, aftertaste. I'll drink this happily any time it's served to me, but I probably won't buy it again."
"Not one of New Belgium's better beers. There is just a strong bitterness and not much else. A one and done for me."
"d- could probably drink this all day, but after my first two, I'm ready for more flavor."
"22oz. bottle served in a Stella glass. Poured a clear gold with a finger of white head. Nice piney hop aroma with some malt. Fair amount of hop bitterness to start, but a good balance of malt. Nice lacing on the glass. Medium bodied. A little vegetal with the hops dinged my score a bit. Drying finish from the hops. Decent beer, pretty drinkable."
"Overall a very solid IPA that you really could not go wrong with. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day."
"M/D= Mouthfeel is gripping bitter at first but very quickly fades. Pretty thin on the mouthfeel, but dry and easy to drink."
"Another good ipa let's your tongue know why it's there."
"D=3.5 I gave it a pretty high drinkability score because I try to imagine being around a fire during a really warm summer night. I would drink a couple if they were there but overall I would not buy one again or seek one out. It's a"
"Poured this from a 22 oz bomber into a standard pint glass. Had a nice two finger white head and a light, clear golden body. There was very weak aroma of grassy hops and I felt like I could smell some of the malts as well. As for taste goes, I almost forgot that I was drinking an IPA. It was so watery and bland that I almost felt like I was drinking a pale ale. I also noticed that it seems to have that ""fat tire"" after taste. Not sure if its the malts or yeast that they use. Overall, I drank this very quickly but didn't really enjoy it. I bought it because it was cheap and I was curious, but I would rather pony up a few more bucks for something of higher quality. Have I gotten spoiled with all of the wonderful IPA's available these days?"
"I like this much more than I thought I would. A nice American IPA for sure. I've never been a real fan of New Belgium but this one was touched me in a special place."
"Drinks alright, but doesn't really pull together. I'd rather have the mighty arrow or hoptoberfest, this would do in a pinch. I was really hoping for more on this one..Scores better than I really like, but I got to score consistently"
"Poured a double deuce into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours an oily copper with just a slight head that leaves a soap scum like lacing down the sides of the glass. This isn't a very pretty beer. Looking down into the glass, it reminds me of extra virgin olive oil sitting on water. The nose is rather unhoppy for its 70 IBU's. Lemon rind, grapefruit and grassy hops come through with just slight bit of toast. Also at the very tail of the aroma is a smell that I can only describe as earthy. The flavor is a bit more hoppy then the aroma but is still toned down from what I expect from an American IPA. Lemon rind, grapefruit, just a bit of pine. White bread and just a little medicinal bitterness at the tail. The mouthfeel is very light and for as oily as its appearance is, it really doesn't coat the mouth in hop bitterness like many of the best American IPA's. The drinkability is about average. I would grab this at a bar that had a pretty crappy selection but if it was Ranger or Boulevard Singlewide, I would take the Singlewide any day."
"Drinkability: Well, there's no about it, it's an IPA. And one that's a tad light in terms of maltiness. Perhaps... perhaps the world of beer has room enough for one more India Pale Ale."
"Easy drinker, but could be a little bigger on the malt end. A one trick pony, but well-enough crafted to pull the trigger once or twice."
"Golden copper with a creamy, fine white head that leaves fine lace behind on the glass. The nose is nice and C-hoppy with pine sap, grapefruit, pineapple and a touch of menthol. Nice resinous, minty hop oily flavors are well balanced with carmel maltiness. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Finishes bitter. Easily my fave of the NB lineup."
"Overall I'd say this is a beer that most IPA lovers will find reasonably enjoyable."
"D: a very solid addition to New Belgium's line up. This beer is better than a lot of their year round selections and is very crisp and refreshing."
"gold/orange color with nice clarity, decent white head and lacing. honeyed doughy malts and citrusy, floral, fruity hops in the nose, although the aromas are muted just a bit. sweet bready malts are balanced out by a smooth hop bitterness which doesn't overwhelm. a bit on the malty side for an ipa, and this aspect would probably make it a good intro to people familiar only with fat tire, etc. nicely carbonated. medium body. finishes with a touch of sweetness and juicy hops. enough going on to have a few of these."
"I guess for the price ($2.99 for the bomber) you get what you pay for, but there are surely a lot of other IPAs within $0.50 to $1 that I would gladly pay more to drink instead."
"Odd and Ends - I really like this package. Sharp."
"D- easy"
"D. Ok drinkability. If I had to choose between Ranger and a number of other IPA's, Ranger would lose. Quite unremarkable in the flavor department, when compared to the smell."
"Ranger is an IPA for all, not a top 25 IPA but a alternative to those who like the taste of hops but not looking for the full experince of a great IPA."
"pours a golden sunset yellow color with a 2 finger head and creamy off-white ring with decent lacing..appearance was a little light for an ipa but not bad..the smell was pine needles first then some citrus and some hops with a biscuit/toast and malt smell..again a little light the taste was a bitter pine taste first with some citrus and malts i might taste the proprietary NB yeast in this one again its OK balanced but on the light side..the mouth feel was medium and filled the beer taste buds.. and it is very drinkable..its just not my choice when i want an IPA..just bought 2 singles will not buy a sixer but may have it on tap at various establishments since it is year round...i don't know so many other and better IPAS out there... NB'S new HOPTOBER this fall for me was outstanding RANGER is just OK"
"D: Enjoyable enough and a somewhat unexpected style from this brewery."
"D: Ranger is a nice IPA. I must say that I was surprised to see New Belgium release an IPA, given their history. But no matter. This is a well done beer."
" I like my IPA's to have a bit heavier mouth feel, but on the plus side this drinks pretty smoothly and leaves a wet finish. This is much better than mighty arrow. Not a bad IPA give it a chance, but don't expect the holy grail."
"D - Easy drinkin' quality IPA. Give it a shot your mouth will thank you."
"Flavors don't match the nose, grassy, apricot, some pine. Little malt backing, a hint of honey. Finish is a bit clipped. Enough bitterness to keep you wanting more."
"D: I was really looking forward to this beer to get New Belgium's take on an IPA. I was slightly let down as I just thought it would be a little more unique."
"D- This is certainly my favorite new belgium beer thus far. Very easy to drink and well rounded."
"Overall, not a bad IPA. For the price, I will gladly get this again, as it's a solid example of the style, nothing bold just simple. Good stuff."
"12oz bottle. Bright orange color, clear, good head, decent lacing, looks like an IPA. Smells hoppy, grassy, citrus, good but not overpowering. The flavor was sort of west coast IPA, citrus and grass but no actual dank present. This was a good IPA but i'm betting the shelf life is not great. Also it was a little thin of rmy preferences."
"If you like dry-finishing IPA's, then this one is pretty easy to drink."
" This beer makes the fourth offering from this brewery's line i have tried. this has revealed a theme to me of the fort collins brewery: Clean finishes. what's left to linger is so .... little. i think them some of the best at this, actually. Also, it does make me see the need for, well, he exact opposite. I'll cite the extreme Sour Blemish genre for contrast. However, as a beer nerd i think the its the balance and the choice that make it fun."
"D: An average IPA at best. There is nothing glaringly bad about it, but it really lags behind many of the other great IPAs in flavor and aroma. I won't be buying this again, but wouldn't turn it away if I was offered one."
"Overall- impressed. not a belgian IPA... could be more smooth and refined but it is aggressive and hop balanced."
"Not pleased."
"Overall a delicious brew but not a great example of the IPA style. Would be a great beer to introduce non-hop heads to the world of true enlightened hoppiness."
"Overall - good solid IPA. Pleased."
"The bitter soapy aftertaste makes it a struggle to take another swig. Overall though, a descent IPA with a good flavor up to the finish but there are plenty of better examples of the style to be enjoyed."
"Crystal clear gold with a small but sticky head of pillowy foam. Nice rings of drippy lace. Fresh, oily hop aroma...grapefruit pulp, wood, pine resin, a little dank herbal-ness. Sweet, but it's mostly about the hops. Sweet, juicy red grapefruit flavor. Medium bitterness, medium body. Quite tasty, actually. A session-worthy, very solid IPA."
"D-Very crisp and easy to drink although with the slight boozyness and the kick you in the face piney hops I could see how this wouldnt be a beer that someone new to the style would want more than one of. For me another great offering from new Blegium"
"Mouthfeel is a little watery, and drinkability is bleh."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that had excellant retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a citrus and pine hop aroma. Nothing from the malt so it is one dimensional. Hoppy flavor as well. Nice citrus and resiny hop characteristics. Some dry cracker like malt. Very dry overall. Bitterness is moderate. Body is on the lighter side of things but seems adequate enough to carry the hops. Carbonation is good. Nice texture. Not the biggest beer but has good flavor that will not fatigue the palate. I could drink several of these in a sitting."
"The medium-light body and well-balanced flavor make this an easy to drink IPA. A good choice when wanting a bitter IPA without the grapefruit/citrus hop flavor."
"I think real IPA lovers should really like this, and it's currently on sale all over N. Colorado, so the price is right."
"That said, I'm sure I'll drop cash on a sixer of this. New Belgium can obviously do hops. Looking forward to more."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied, slick and smooth. I would prefer it to be a bit more sharp."
"Pours orangish-yellow with a large white head. The aroma is pine and orange, but is not as strong as I expected. The flavor is orange with medium bitterness. Some grassy and flowery hop aromas as well as some grapefruit notes in the flavor, but there is a slight soapiness that distracts from the overall beer. The finish is bitter orange. Thin-medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Spicy and with a light grainy texture in flavor, bit of citrus. Dry and grainy on the finish which is rather brief. Nice moderate body and with a good level of carbonation which keeps the feel and flavors throughout the pour. Fairly drinkable though a bit coarse and dry for me. A different take than most an attempt and not quite up my alley, but a decent offering from NB."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Tops Tasting Room. A very good drinking IPA. High carbonation, but the bitterness is right there. Above average mouthfeel. Medium yellow with lts of head that leaves it lacey.C-Hoppy aroma.Told it was a beginner IPA, but its stronger hoppiness, pine, is a bit more than that. Liked it."
"D: A nice, approachable beer. Not something for the hardcore hophead, but perhaps a nice sessioner for a less hop-centric individual like myself, and a great steppingstone beer."
"One thing about California, West Coast AIPA isn't exactly rare or expensive. This one isn't one of the best of the lot. At best this is a good beer, not great."
"Consumed: 2/6/2010"
"Typical solid product from NB. It's snowy outside, but this beer makes me ready for warmer weather."
"D: very sessionable, the light mouthfeel and malt profile mixed with a strong, but not overbearing hop profile makes a sessionable fairly high (70 is claimed?) IBU beer. This will be a great beer for the warm spring days and through the summer. Nice work NB for something a little out of the box for them."
"Golden body, superb clarity. Creamy white head, long retention. Grassy, green, floral hops aromas with just a touch of citrus. Light toasty malt first. Then green grass, perfumey flowers, and orange peel. Ample carbonation mixes with moderate bitterness. Interesting. I wouldn't call this a balanced IPA and yet, it is not a hop bomb either. There seems to be more hop bitterness than hop flavor. The hop mix is unusual, sort of soapy, not as much citrus as I would like. It is not a bad beer, but given the 70 IBUs and Simcoe, Chinook and Cascade hops, I was hoping this would be a really good beer. It is not. Like many of New Belgium's beers, it serves as an appropriate, approachable introduction to the style, but offers very little for more seasoned beer drinkers."
"I'm particularly wild about but the hops are restrained enough that this isn't just hop juice."
"Mouth is slightly oily and perfectly carbonated. Drinks moderate to fast and is nice and sessionable."
"however! a magnanimous nose on this silly puppy. the simcoe and cascade battle into the sky, forming a plume of tropical and evergreen goodness. there is solid bitterness but the hops are clearly not married, or, if they are, are perhaps going through a rough spot in their marriage. it is delightful and intriguing, but ultimately wanting. the chinook bitters it out nicely with that clean hoppiness."
"Overall this is another solid but only above average beer from NB. I think I preferred Hoptober more than this but they're not all that different. Worth a shot."
"Overall impression: This one goes down nice and easy. Recommended."
"Overall this is a pretty dang drinkable IPA, absolutely my new favorite offering from NB."
"Overall it's a pretty tasty beer but not exceptional. With all of the fantastic IPAs available here in Colorado, this one doesn't stand out as one of the greats. Chances are a lot of people will like it and it will sell but I doubt I will buy it again."
"D - This is a very green IPA. Tons of pine and grassy flavors may make it difficult for an IPA neophyte."
"Overall, not an IPA I'd drink a again, pretty disappointing."
"D-Nice effort that should please hop heads as it has a nice hop feel on the nose, taste and finish. Overall a good solid IPA but not an elite one. Not close to Colorado's best IPA from O'Dell."
"D- i can see myself buying this again. the large amount of biscuity malt give this one a different and rather unique taste compared to the IPAs i usually come across. over all i was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"Pretty disappointed with this one. Really weak IPA, I would barely consider this a Pale Ale if even."
"Sticky, bitter hop resins coat the palate upon the first sip, reminding me of a fresh-hop beer. Very earthy and organic hops taste like they were just picked yesterday. A nice lingering bitterness lasts well into the finish, but I would have liked to taste more balance in the malt department. A few bready-caramel notes remind you that pale malts took part in the brewing process, but the grains are otherwise unremarkable. Nevertheless, this is a delectable IPA, and the mouthfeel is crisp, with a medium-light body and a clean, bitter finish. Definitely an IPA meant to be consumed ASAP--keep those hops fresh!"
"overall it is exactly what i was expecting...lots of hops and biscuit malt"
"Mouthfeel is very soft and smooth. That greatly increases the drinkability. I like this a lot better than Fat Tire. This may be my new favorite everyday New Belgium."
"I have had mixed feelings about the last few New Belgium brews I have had lately,this is a clear winner in my book.Poured into a standard pint glas a clear medium golden with tight formed 1/2 finger white head that left shotty lace as it settled into an almost creamy mass.Nice shot of the Simcoe hops in the nose,sharp and citric, with a little herb.Flavors are well balanced at first with pine and citric hop melding well with a hefty caramel base,a big shot of sharp herbal leafiness hits in the finish.I think a very well rounded IPA with a alot of different hop components going on."
"- Great drinkability.. but not really that great for the style. I am used to a bready, not-so-sweet IPA. Its good though... and I am sure would be nice to have a pint or two on tap."
"D: Good drinkability. I could certainly drink more than one, but it wouldn't be my first pick, in terms of an IPA."
"The body and drinkabilty were both average for the style. Overall, this was a very decent beer, much better than I expected from this brewery. Certainly worth your time."
"Hopefully future batches from New Belgium will be hoppier, i'd make me happier!"
"Green, fresh hop cone nose, with some underlying bready malt. Flavors are bright, with lemony, minty hops coming through uninhibited by much malt sweetness. The malt profile is lean and biscuit-like, and stays in the background. Bitterness is clean and refined; mouthfeel is smooth and silky with fine carbonation. The green hop flavors integrate perfectly with the slightly doughy malt, resulting in a clean, bright, balanced IPA. Clearly one of the finest IPAs being made today, and from a brewery large enough to offer consistency, value and availability. A staple of mine."
"I will try the Ranger again for the sake of fairness but so far I would only buy it if it was one of the few IPA's to choose from."
"D- This is a fairly light IPA with loads of grassy hop flavors that would fare well on a hot summer day. It's not a great beer, but I would definitely buy this again to bring to a BBQ or to keep around for friends and family to try."
"Middle of the road beer, nothing impessive about this one. Way too many other good IPAs to go back to this one. Sorry New Belgium."
"Poured from a bottle. This poured a golden color with a white head. This was a typical New Belgum beer to me, not always a bad thing. I have not had a lot of their products but they seem to lack complexity. To me it just was not hoppy enough for an IPA. It still was very smooth and easy drinking. I will try it again."
"D - very pleasant hop aroma and a taste that invites you back for more. an ipa on the somewhat lighter side, though."
"The carbonation was good. Gave it an above average mouthfeel. If I forget the mislabelling of calling this an IPA, this would be good on a hot summer day sitting around the BBQ pit. I could put a few away. But, given the number of good, reasonably priced West Coast IPAs that I have access to, I doubt I'll spend my money on this."
"drinkability - this has session ipa written all over it - and it has the taste to back it up to boot"
"taste is smooth, citrus, hops, and dandelion, ends a little tangy on the tongue and nicely bitter."
"4.5/4/4/4/4"
"Easily drinkable- almost too drinkable. A very nice example of a US version of the fabled IPA, not too heavy, but solidly built. Recommended."
"D: A very drinkable and delicious hoppy, American IPA"
"I find this very drinkable, and session-able. depending on cost i can see this becoming a contender with Racer 5 for this style of beer. I will definitely buy and drink this again and again. Good work NB."
"I picked up a 22oz bottle to try this again and I'm glad I did. Nice hop flavours here with some grape fruitand pine and some nice grass. Malt is hiding in the background but does enough to make it noticed. Nice bitter and short aftertaste and makes this quite drinkable. I guess the last time I tried it my mood just wasn't right. Scores adjusted."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass at around cellar temp. Golden color with a tinge of orange, fluffy off-white head. Aroma is immediately Simcoe, but its character is well-balanced with the other hops here. Sometimes Simcoe-heavy beers are catty but not this one. Candied grapefruit and some skunky weed, resin. I like this aroma quite a bit. Unfortunately it doesn't really translate into the flavor. Pale malt shines through up front, which is always a bad sign. The hops dominate the aroma but fade to an afterthought in the taste. Still I get a little citrus and a faint but distinct melon note. Nice long bitterness but also some astringency. Not a sweet beer at all, which is a good foundation for my ideal IPA, but the hops just never show up. Another victim of the laughable ""well-balanced IPA"" paradigm I guess. Dry finish, but again, in an astringent way. Easy to drink but uninteresting."
"Drinkability: The malt throws me off on this one as I'm not a fan but the blend of hops makes up for it. I could, and will, drink several of these. If you're a hop head you can count on this one to satisfy you. If you're just breaking into the hoppy beers this is still one you'd want to try."
"D - Very drinkable. Hop smell and taste is strong, and would satisfy hop heads, is also mellow/fresh and not overwhelming or bitter. I could drink several of these."
"quite drinkable. i only have a 12oz. pour and yet i can easily see into the future. this could easily be a starter for the novice who wants a solid, well-crafted IPA, but may be frightened by a more assertive and bitter offering. this beer screams session if an IPA should truly be sessioned."
"I picked this up at whole foods fresh off the truck.. Looking at the bottle there is a unfiltered cloudiness in the lower 1/3 of the bottle.. While pouring I noticed quite a strong floral hop aroma very impressed in this from NB.. The first taste was exceptional there was three levels of of flavor, from instant bite to a strong malt in the middle, then a bitter finish.. Overall very impressed in NB for this one they made it thier way with thier own malt and house yeast.. A"
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. To be honest I am quite shocked that it is from New Belgium. I can only hope this is a new trend with them. Good IPA for people who love Fat Tire and know nothing else of craft beer. This could be my go to IPA if the cash flow is low."
"D: This is an impressive IPA. It's got the bitterness, citrus, and all that goes into beers of this style, yet it is mellow enough that it could easily be a session beer."
"D: All in all, a solid effort. New Belgium always has well made products. This is by no means going to make me ditch the San Diego hop efforts, but should be an inexpensive IPA making it something I'd pick up now and again."
"Very nice beer from our friends at new Belgium. 70 ibu's but you don't get that tipical hop hit that you would expect. Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoy this brew and the fact that new Belgium is doing something new is awsome. I think more and moe breweries need to start doing more hoppy, ipa high alcohol beers. Bang for your buck I say."
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. As it seems most people posting are liquor store employees. This muddy copper colored beer poured off with a fair amount of head that reduced down to rim of the glass lacing. The aroma that lofts from the beer is citrus and a clean hop smell. Really aromatic. The taste is that of a clean hopped beer both during the brewing cycle and a dry hop flavoring. The tones of grapefruit lead through toward the aftertaste of the brew. A slight amount of a watered down taste also peaks through. Overall a averaged IPA. It will be interesting to see if this takes off or if it actually just stays like the abby, blue paddle and mothership wit."
"A well-made IPA, quite sessionable, and what I'd expect from New Belgium. Why they didn't do this earlier I don't know, but at least this presumably long awaited beer lives up to what it should be."
"Drinkability is awesome. This one sampling won't last more than a few minutes. Really well crafted IPA. I would have to say this is the best beer I've had from NB thus far. Looking forward to this one being available soon."
"Pre-release sample courtesy of my favorite pub. Pours a golden color with a thick white head. Huge cascade/grapefruit aroma. Very surprising for NB to use so many hops. Very well balanced with a fair amount of bitterness. Only thing that was really disapointing was the body which was on the lighter side. Still a very drinkable session IPA."
"Overall, a solid offering from a brewery that should have had a hoppy beer a long time ago."
