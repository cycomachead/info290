My aggressive pour created a towering 4-finger head that overwhelmed my IPA glass and cascaded down to the countertop. Sweet precious ale, what have I done?! After squeezing the last ounce in the glass, I was left with an ice cream float-like head. Ample lacing crowned the deep, hazy, nectar colored liquid. I took a few moments to admire the robust and beautiful garnet-amber hue before diving in to the nose. It didn't take long for the potent scents to waft upward. Spruce pine and juniper mingled with a sweet grapefruit citrus and hints of pineapple. Reminiscent of the fresh bed of pine straw that falls in my yard each Autumn, with a zesty citrus flare. There's an underlying bread crust in the nose that struggles to compete with the floral and perfume-like hops.  The flavor was a vibrant hop explosion. Earthy, herbal and fresh. Ruby red grapefruit. The caramel malt backbone also stands tall but struggles to support the alpha acids. To call this balanced would be a lie, but the malts are noteworthy and serve to further illustrate how incredible the star of the show really is. All of this is delivered with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. I've run out of adjectives. It's simply delicious and represents the high-water mark for American IPA's. Sierra Nevada continues to impress with their admirable ales and the West Coast sure shows us how it's done. Happy New Year Beer Advocates. Welcome to 2015!!!","JohnnyI","Dec 31, 2014"

It shows off the hop harvest well, so I guess it's mission accomplished on that part.

Deep copper color with good range of color depth depending upon light angle. Nose is pinier and/or more citrusy than some lighter or more flowery hopped IPA's. Broad range of malt sweetness on the front end and finishes with a sweet yet hoppy, lingering finish. Very balanced. Mouth feel is somewhat effervescent. Not something to be expected from a festive seasonal ale but a nice twist on the typical IPA that really brings the holidays home.","18Beers","Dec 22, 2014"

Its an IPA and i love most other Sierra Nevada beers so I think, it should be something special. After all it is a ""Celebration"" seasonal been and should be something special. I get it home, eager to try, pop one in the freezer hoping I haven't just bought a case of duds. Well, on my first try I am underwhelmed, in fact disappointed. The copy on the side of the case says ""fresh hopped"". I think that means at the very least a Hoppy experience like Torpedo (which I love and maybe that's the problem). It also says hints of citrus and PINE?!, Well if it were me I wouldn't use the word pine in copy about beer. Save it for the Potpourri at thanksgiving and Christmas.. and sure as hell leave it out of beer. The first taste in your mouth isn't bad.... then you get the after taste. If you want to say pine.. id say more like turpentine. Its not heavy its sort of a thin processed alcohol taste that's bitter, but not the good bitter an IPA should have but worse. If you are going to say Fresh hopped make it taste hoppy.. I'm so sad I bought a case of it. Xmas beer anyone?","msmithphotog","Nov 26, 2014"

This ale has nice carbonation and is bottle conditioned with bubbles rising and particulates settled at the bottom of the glass. The aroma is light and grassy with fresh pine notes, lemon, and honeysuckle. First drink is fresh and slightly grassy with plenty of pine and grapefruit hops. The hops blend perfectly with an earthy note into toasted caramel malt. The finish retains plenty of piney citrus bitterness and freshness. Definitely not a dry finish. Excellent! Near perfect.","doublenaughtspy","Nov 24, 2014"

Nice stench from the head. Cascade hops are becoming a standard for the nose. Easily evident and fresh which is a nice bonus. Need to find more before winters end. Nose to glass feels like I am in a abundant forest with lots of trees and herbs meandering about. Hats off on this one. Love the sticky  lacing  on the glass which promotes its drinkable assets. Outstanding IPA...","silverevo9","Nov 20, 2014"

Kicked up a nice thick and fluffy off-white two fingers of foam that receded to a thin film after about five minutes, but left very nice lacing. Color is dark amber to brown and very clear. Aroma is piney, grassy and spicy with a bit of sweet malty notes. The flavor has a lot of pine, some grassy flavors and a very nice roasty malt backbone, very well balanced. The mouthfeel is medium, but silky smooth with a nice bitter aftertaste and a bit of carbonation bite that makes you want to have another taste. Overall, this is the one holiday seasonal beer I look forward to all year, even though it's really not a traditional ""Christmas"" beer. Simply outstanding- I think I'm becoming a Sierra Nevada ""homer""!","timontheroad","Nov 16, 2014"

The aroma isn't bad, but there isn't much to it, with just barely there and nondescript hops. The taste is pretty bland, as well. The most prominent flavor note is bitter hops, but without anything specific. Just...bitter. The body has a nice weight and feel to it.

Pours slightly hazy deep orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/brady malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wet hop IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 16, 2014"

This beer is dangerously drinkable for an IPA that clocks in at 6.8%. It's perfectly balanced with malt and hops. I mainly get pine in the taste but it's very pleasant and lingers on the tongue. I think it's the wet hops that keeps your mouth watering and wanting more. This beer is great and I will definitely look forward to it for years to come.","Cory_Brown","Nov 15, 2014"

There is plenty of hop flavor and fresh aroma but is well balanced by the malt bill.  It still stands up well to all the new beers since its first release.  Combined with its availability and price point, this is an amazing IPA.  A great alternative to all the spiced beers this time of the year.","Tuck_leepulin","Nov 06, 2014"

Amazing consistency and flavor for a mass-produced beer.

4.22,1.7,4.5,4.25,4,4.75,4.25,"Overall - A truly hoppy IPA, fairly bitter and strong, yet manages to feel extremely well balanced. The fresh hops (not wet hops...freshly dried hops) really pop in this beer with a lot of complexity, yet the smooth malty backbone provides just enough sweetness to balance while letting the hoppy star of the show shine. An outstanding beer, and a classic.","Redneckwine","Oct 27, 2014"

I wish I could go back in time and crack a bottle in 1990 to see for sure. There's a lot of other things I'd like to do if I could go back to 1990, but that's a story for a different website. Regardless, This is a delicious holiday beer from one of the best breweries on Planet Earth.","haulpass","Oct 23, 2014"

Less citrus in the taste but the pine remains with a great deal of floral taste as well. The floral quality reminds me of why I fell in love with IPAS. Definitely the perfect winter IPA with a very rich mouthfeel, low to moderate carbonation.","Phigg1102","Jun 01, 2014"

It has a lasting aroma of hops that hangs in the air after the pour, the taste is of hops, citrus, and rye, with notes of caramel. It has nice bitter taste, light body, has a hoppy after taste, and feels good on the tongue. Fantastic beer...","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","May 03, 2014"

The aroma is really wonderful--citrusy hops predominate. The flavor is rich, delightful, strong hops balanced with malt. Mouthfeel is medium thick, with fairly strong carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding ale, different than Torpedo in character, but defines truly from the same family. TMZL below does a much better description of this ale.

4.92,18.6,5,4.75,5,4.75,5,"Poured into pint glass from 6 pack purchased at Distellers Outlet in Poway CA. Every year I look forward to this brew and it never dissapoints. A beefed up Pale Ale from the folks who make quite possibly the best PA around. The smell on this beer is amazing, hops, fruits, pinecone/pine needle(did I mention piney) type smell. The head on this beer is like a fluffy marshmellow cloud, one of the best heads on a IPA I have ever come across, really superb. Lots of hops, this brew has its bitter side but it is matched in equal with malts and whatever else they are using...fruit, spices, crisp on the palate with a warming alcohol lingering towards the end. If this is on the shelfs it means the weather is colder outside, and this is the perfect beer to warm you up on a chilly night.","theteleman","Feb 02, 2014"

APPEARANCE: beautiful amber brown body with a creamy white head that sits resiliently; lacing is total and impressively cumulus... AROMA: cinnamon, nutmeg, and cascade hops; hints if honey assuage the pinecone explosion... PALATE: active, medium-to-full bodied presence; at 6.8% ABV, packs a palatable punch...TASTE: nice malty presence; the balance is impeccable-- ""whole cone"" aptly describes this IPA impact...

This was recommended to me by a coworker. He knows more about beer than I but I have a girlfriend so maybe it all evens out.

You can smell the hops and grapefruit pretty clearly with a significant pine smell coming through as well. Celebration feels a lot lighter-bodied than I expected with average carbonation. Finally, the taste is overwhelmingly grapefruit with some hops and caramel coming through as well. The bitterness of the hops really comes through at the end (honestly, it was a little more strongly than I would have liked). I can see why hopheads love this one but it's just a tad much for me. All in all, I like it but it's nothing particularly special when it comes to IPAs.","walkinginplace","Dec 23, 2013"

Poured a deep copper color with an offwhite head or a finger. Smells of pine hops and sweet Christmas bread. I was rather surprised at the smell of hops with a brew that was 4 years old. The taste starts with some light hop bitterness, followed by the Christmas bread, honey, and dried fruits. Light hop flavor melds into sweetness on the finish.

Look, smell, taste and feel all embrace one another in harmony. Standout trait is the appearance. Looks better than most dark brown/deep red brews I've seen. The head is the literal ""Crowning Achievement"". At first sits high and mighty atop the maroon brew. With time flattens, but never leaves. An hour later, my finished glass still had a puddle of foam relaxing on the bottom. The lacing didn't stick to said glass, it would cascade down in a smooth waterfall-foaming fashion and collect downwards. If you're like me I drink every drip if I can. That's the sign of a great beer. One should celebrate Celebration.","shacawgo24","Dec 02, 2013"

Aroma is of super fresh, bursting citrus led by grapefruit, followed by a bit of pineapple and mango. Followed by pine resin and light notes of sweet caramel malt. Taste starts very hop-forward. The citrus is now mostly absent. The pine notes are strong, and the caramel malts are more present than they were in the aroma. As it warms, the citrus does reappear a bit, dominated by grapefruit and not much else. Although the hops dominate this brew, the rest of the flavors are very well balanced. Medium bodied. Good amount of carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink. I could down quite a few of these. Overall, a very solid IPA. Every aspect was solid, but I was hoping for a little bit more of an in your face result from the taste, instead of the balanced taste that it has. Not a fault, however, still a very good beer.","majorbase2","Nov 29, 2013"

Reminds me a lot of, well...every other Sierra offering. Malts are (thankfully) present, and well-balanced. You can taste the alcohol, but don't be scared. Strong hop bitterness only warms the mild alcohol presence. In my mind, celebration's achievement is in balance. This isn't a hop bomb. While the hops greet you initially, the malty smoothness leaves a strong residual sweetness. Taste. Warmth. Happiness. Friends and family, that's what the holiday season is -and should be- all about.","Marko84","Nov 26, 2013"

While Sierra Nevada claims the recipe is the same year after year it is simply the freshest hops of the season that differentiate it there are subtle differences in the years. In my opinion of the past 8 years give or take, the 2012 edition is by far the best. This is however the 2013 edition and it is a solid brew. Pretty much outstanding across the board. No weaknesses and nothing that stands out. Just a solid example of what a fresh hop IPA is all about. The thing that amazes me and is rarely mentioned is the consistency of this brewery seeing as how celebration( to the best of my knowledge) is in all 50 states(57 if u are an Obama supporter) and for the brewery to maintain that awesome of a consistency with that volume of production speaks wonders.

It's not wickedly bitter, doesn't finish like dish soap, actually smells pretty good, but there's just nothing else here but hops. If you are a ""hop-head"" who spends the rest of the year drinking bitter IPAs then you may find this a great ""holiday"" version of that. It has a great hop profile, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a summer beer. But for me ""Christmas"" ales bring to mind malts and spices and toasty warming goodness, and I found none of that here.","ChestSplitter","Nov 10, 2013"

This beer lacked hop aroma, hop taste, notable character, and had an overly yeasty smell- It smells faintly like a macro. I had claimed this in years past as an amazing, highly recommended beer, but was disappointed this year. Perhaps SN is spreading their operation too thin? I loved their beer camp series, but it perhaps detracted from overall quality control on their most infamous craft beer. Better luck next year , old friend.","MaltyHoppyGood","Nov 09, 2013"

This would work nicely as a replacement for my Nosferatu that I'm running out of - wonderful hops, but with a solid malt backbone to compliment it all and make it pleasurable drinking experience. I could easily have another one in a sitting. I had this with pulled pork BBQ (mustard based sauce) and green beans and it went quite well with food. I wouldn't mind having a snifter of this either though for a cold winters night. The pine and citrus hops remind me of summer on a cold evening. Great beer!","damndirtyape","Nov 07, 2013"

I have heard people say it isn't drinkable, and they are insane. I could drink this all day. It is very smooth from the first sip to the last. The bitterness is perfect...more bite than a regular IPA but not quite as intense as a DIPA. A very solid beer all around, would highly recommend.","xVERITAS","Nov 03, 2013"

4.38,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pours dark amber with a two finger khaki head. Beautiful looking brew. The aroma is filled with all kinds of notes. Orange citrus, cinnamon, caramel, maple, brown sugar, and lemon just to name a few. The taste is also quite well crafted. It is incredibly balanced from the get go. Nice burst of citrus closely followed by a caramel bready malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. ABV is right where it should be and goes unnoticed. This one is a winner from the beginning. It's equally affordable as it is good. It's hard to find a better beer at this price point anywhere in the US.","screamking","Nov 02, 2013"

Light / medium body with a balance of hop flavor and bitterness tilted to the bitter side. Hop flavor is of pine and grapefruit - quite nice. Less bitter than Torpedo, but more than Flipside. Hop flavor is less than Flipside. Finishes with a slight hop flavor and lingering bitterness. If hop flavor is your preference, go with Flipside. If bitterness is your bag, go with Torpedo. This one falls in between the two. These 3 SN brews can give you a good contrast of IPAs.","tillmac62","Oct 29, 2013"

Fortunately a local store still carried a few bottles. Can't wait till this comes out over the holidays.In my opinion the smell and state compliment one another well.","nsb318","Aug 12, 2013"

Full boastful flavor, with a great moutfeel, and even better after taste.

4.45,7.2,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"2013 Vintage. Classic red amber color, comforting floral aroma with pine forest and vanilla notes. Flavor is sugar coated tangerines in a doughy blanket. As usual, great balance of gritty malt and rough edged hop bite. Finish is all about lingering resinous piney hop and a trickle of alcohol burn. Mouth feel is a bit light and dry - medium body is there, but the hops havent mellowed yet. IPA, Winter warmer, whatever you want to call it, SNCA is to me, one of the best large production beers available. A valid reason to look forward to Winter.","ExtraStout","Mar 30, 2013"

There are some nice hop notes there, but the typical lemon/grapefruit aromas are a bit muted and the rich malt notes tend to be more up front. Similar situation taste-wise. It's much more malt-forward, with a hearty backbone of earthy hops. Nicely balanced. Great winter beer.","CookstLiquor","Feb 10, 2013"

By the way, the label calls this a fresh hop IPA… and I generally don't like fresh hopped beers. I would like to see them do another version of this and either double the ABV (consider it an imperial IPA) or barrel age it. They just released the barrel aged Bigfoot, so they have some barrels sitting around!","rickyleepotts","Feb 06, 2013"

4.62,11.3,5,4.25,5,4,4.5,"12oz bottle, a rocky, ivory head tops a bronze colored ale; excellent head retention & lacing is left all over the glass. The pleasant aromas of fresh, dank, piny hops coupled with caramely, bready malt fill the nose. Huge, fresh, piny hops (some pungent grapefruit in there as well) prevail through the healthy dose of malt. Notes of rye bread crust and caramel (a little burnt) try to balance out the pine, but can't stand up to it. Pine lingers & lingers on the palate while finishing dry and bitter. Medium body, smooth but resiny reminiscent of pine tar. Overall, although it's fairly one-note with not a whole lot of complexity, I love this seasonal IPA. I'm not sure why some complain about it being too piny...that's exactly the point they're trying to make.","barnzy78","Dec 27, 2012"

4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Sierra Nevada Celebration pours a dark amber, with a good bit of clarity to it. Just over two fingers of dirty white foam finish off the look, hanging around for a few minutes before leaving chunks of lacing stuck to the glass. The aroma is predominantly grapefruit in character, but a bit of more piney hops manages to sneak into the nose as well. There's a healthy dollop of caramel and candied sugar right up front, before a bitterness intercedes. My first impression is that it's relatively mild, but it does increase in intensity as it moves towards the back of my palate. The hoppy finish is closer to straight floral grapefruit, but there's still a little bit of pine appreciable. The body definitely isn't on the dry end of the spectrum for an IPA. For a beer that's (hopefully) only going to be consumed in the winter months, I don't mind that as much. The carbonation could stand to ""pop"" just a little bit more though. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Sierra Nevada Celebration, but I don't quite see what makes some of my beer geek brethren go crazy about it either.","axeman9182","Dec 18, 2012"

Smells of pine and citrus. Very refreshing and, well, celebratory. Excellent mouthfeel. A little oily, hoppy, and some malt--an excellent balance. Wonderful. A bite, too, but a pleasant bite. When I went to the beer distributor he bragged about having several cases. I'm glad because I mean to go back.","AdamPenna","Dec 09, 2012"

3.89,-6.3,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Celebration pours a beautiful dark amber caramel, bordering on ruby and brown. The beer has a fantastic creamy white head with the faintest tan hints, and it lasts forever, sitting two fingers width up from the beer. The beers body is hazy with carbonation bubbles, but clear of sediment. Lacing is fat and sticky, sliding down the glass slowly and leaving some nice fangs and walls on the side of my glass. This beer looks festive and gorgeous. On the nose the beer smells superbly piney, like a Canadian forest. Rich sweet pine notes meld with almost-cloying sweet caramel malts to hint at some alcohol spice. This smell is what a classic American IPA should smell like. The beer tastes sweet with a wonderful pulpy bitter pine and grapefruit marriage. As the beer enters the mouth and moves over the tip of the tongue the almost-cloying sweet caramel malt plays strongly, but that is swiftly met by the mouth biting bitters, which are not too strong, but are definitely present to bring strong grapefruit and pine flavors into the mouth to stay. The bitters almost bring the flavor into medicinal and stale bread flavors, and definitely walk a fine line as they touch upon the flavor thresholds, but maintain the more appealing tastes of pine and grapefruit, and thus provide a lovely refreshing taste. On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with some creamy carbonation and a nice bitter bite that tingles on the tongue. The mouth is left quite dry with islands of sticky saliva and a little astringency left on the tongue. Overall this is a very solid American IPA. Is this the libation of the holiday gods as some people would have you think? No, of course not, it is just a solid example of the classic American IPA, and a perfect time-machine to when the American IPA was first rising as a style. A solid go to drink that is relatively cheap and easy to find. The beer is perfect for those looking for a bitter bite, but it really isn’t amazing.","Maxwell","Dec 06, 2012"

I was expecting this one to be a bit more balanced due to the darker color, but the sweet malts come out more as the beer warms. I’m glad that Sierra Nevada puts out an IPA in the winter time; it’s a nice switch from the much darker and heavier beers that tend to go hand-in-hand with the colder months. This is a very tasty and drinkable brew that has enough hop bite to warm you up.","BlackBelt5112203","Dec 04, 2012"

It is simply a good IPA that doesn't try anything ballsy and delivers a fulfilling, if not memorable, experience. Would I drink it again? I will return to it for next years release but glad I didn't opt for the sixer this time around.","JamesMN","Nov 20, 2012"

Pommegranet, apple, grapefruit hit the nose with an awesome sweet metalic malt backbone. The taste followz the nose, but with a sour citrus note, sweet malts again are the backbone and grapefruit bitterness finishes it off with a slit alcohol twang to close it out. Though this may not have been the example of what celebration tasted like a year ago, i love it, and would trade my 2012's for this, any day.","Chris_Cali_2o9","Nov 20, 2012"

Head dissipates, leaving a thin layer of bubbly white head. Fresh earthy aroma, with fresh hop, malt and some sweetness character. Taste is super fresh; extremely balanced between hop, spice and bitter profiles, nothing dominates, very pleasant. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, smooth, not too bitter, with a light sense on the finish.

It has remarkable balance with a complex caramel malt bill similar to a marzen (plus the hops, of course). The fresh floral hops are notable as well. This is a beer without many weaknesses. I typically go for the big citrus, hop forward IPAs but this one is delicious in an entirely different way.

It's very hop forward w piney piney hops at first then sweet caramel and toasted bread before the citrusy hops come in to close the sweet deal w a nice citrusy bitter finish that lingers. This brew is easy to drink w a slick yet sticky lip smacking mouthfeel. I look forward to drinking this beer every year and it never disappoints.

There are plentiful tiny bubbles rising in the beer. There's a nice citrus and pine hop aroma accompanied by caramel malt. There's some grain the smell as well. The flavors of this IPA are well-balanced. There's a strong malt backbone, but the hops also shine through. It's bready with some sweetness. The citrus and pine aromas come through soon after that and leave a mild lingering aftertaste. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and this is very drinkable. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Nov 11, 2012"

A sharp, piney finish to this. A nice creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a nice beer. Kinda reminds me of Odells Town Pump Pale in that both seem like they could just as easily be labeled a dry hopped amber as easily as an (A/I)PA, though this one is certainly far more hoppier and complex than Town Pump.

Aroma of piney and herbal hops, sweet malt. Flavor dominated by herbal and piney hops, light grapefruit, decent sweet malt backbone, very nice. A nice IPA and great annual treat. Every year I'm surprised again how great this tastes.","LiquidAmber","Aug 07, 2012"

4.28,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I tried Celebration Ale in my first 6 months of drinking beer and could not put it down. I had labeled it the worst beer I've ever had. Not long after I had a similar experience with Lagunitas' IPA. But, after some time developing a taste for big hops and such, I've revisited a lot of these beers with different results. The Lagunitas IPA still does nothing for me, but I rather like Celebration Ale. It's reddish body and sticky head looks nice. Mild hop aromas and flavor with a surprising woodiness to it (an appropriate label for sure). It's an easy drinker that doesn't give up any flavor in doing so. Hops can be pungent, but it feels more like they are there to force into savoring smaller sips rather than gulp it down.","TheRealBigC","Jul 26, 2012"

But there's nothing in the flavor nor aroma that would have made me think it was made with fresh hops. Either way, it is tasty, but there are several (even non-seasonal) better American IPAs out there (fresh hop or not).","macrosmatic","Apr 09, 2012"

Anyway, I poured this one into a pint glass and started reviewing. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a nice 1/4 inch white head. Hops are the focus of this beer and it has a nice citrus flavor. I can taste sweet orange peel flavors and balanced with a nice hop spiciness. Malts are in the background but still there and slightly sweet. It's a great IPA and I'll be buying this brew again for sure.","Rhynes2","Feb 13, 2012"

4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with an off white head over an inch tall thanks to an aggressive pour. Carbonation is visible. Head recedes to about 1/4 of an inch and leaves die nice rings of lacing in my glass. Smell is primarily of sweet citrus, more of an orange smell than the usual grapefruit, with a secondary scent of pine coming in also. The taste hi lights both of these flavors as well as the hops. In the taste I get the malt first followed by the pine then the citrus, the aftertaste contains both the pine and citrus, but is dominated by the pine taste. Mouthfeel is average for an IPA, carbonation is assertive. Overall, great beer. I can say though that there are better fresh hop IPAs. This is one of the reasons I love Sierra Nevada. This beer is worth buying a 12 pack.","gkunkle","Jan 03, 2012"

Nose has a great wet hop character, raw and resinous citrus of orange and grapefruit character, some tropical notes and a general herbal/grassiness that I always seem to find in fresh hopped ales. Some sweet caramel breads behind the hops. Taste is bitter right off the bat, with some substantial citrus rind, pine, berries and floral/herbal hop notes again. Sweet caramell-y bready malts again that are secondary to the juicy and chewy hops. Medium full mouthfeel with a solid bitterness that hangs around long into the finish in a grassy fashion. A touch of alcohol and sweetness, with medium carbonation. Great flavours and complexity, I'm certainly curious as to how this ages.","liamt07","Jan 03, 2012"

I had thought it unbalanced, with too much hops and not enough malt. I bought a 12-er to bring with me to X-mas ""celebration(s)"" at my fiancee's family's house and am enjoying the S$%& out of it. Great beer! Huge hops, still not much malt flavor but no complaints here. Something was off with my palate last time I had it.. hadn't been eating enough maybe? Anyway, as the Bros. rate this, ""world class."" I loved it in the past and will continue to look for it. If only I could locate some Bigfoot in Indianapolis, as I used to back in the early 00s. Thanks SN. Glad I didn't review this and mislead any hopheads or beer fans in general. Important: no spices or other bullshit to ruin this beer despite its' winter seasonal status. Buy it, drink it, catch a buzz if you're a BA willing to entertain such notions.","MarkBlackout","Dec 25, 2011"

There's a piney/Listerine type hops flavor going on that I don't expect. Color is a nice golden hued amber, head is proper, lacing thin but stays intact. Smell is warm and inviting, hops being #1 in the nose. Flavor is a rich IPA with great tangerine/grapefruit notes and grainy carbonation. But, there is that pine sap antiseptic quality nudging through. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for my liking, and while the flavor is good, after one or two it gums up your tasting apparatus a bit. A very good beer, but I think this year (2011) it could be better, or maybe I remember it differently than it actually is.","MNJR","Dec 10, 2011"

This beer had great drinkability, it had very good balance which isn't that common in American IPA's and it wasn't that bitter, I could definitely drink three or four of these in a sitting and it also goes very well with a nice holiday dinner. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, the aroma, taste, look, and mouthfeel were all spot on in my opinion. There wasn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I will for sure be buying this beer again and I like the fact that it comes in twelve packs, it makes for a good beer to keep on hand for holiday partys. I highly recommend this beer, especially if you are tired of the large amount of heavily spiced winter seasonals. I can't say enough good things about this beer, so far this is one of my favorite Sierra Nevada sesonals, and a great American IPA. Great job guys this is one classic winter beer that I don't see going out of style anytime soon.","StoutHunter","Dec 03, 2011"

The beer poured a rather unremarkable chill hazed Orange/Red and left decent lacing. Upon first whiff I could smell numerous citrus aromas coming from the Cascade and Centennial hops that are generously used in this brew. In addition to hopping the beer when first brewed, Sierra Nevada dry hops Celebration after the first stage of fermentation is complete giving the beer it's bold aroma. The first sip of Celebration is reminiscent to shaking hands with an old friend; warm, inviting and friendly. This brew finishes clean with a slightly bitter side to it from the Chinook hops used in the brewing. Overall this beer is what a great Christmas season beer should be.","Topher78","Nov 30, 2011"

I felt a sense of pride in myself for identifying it as such when I saw it was written on the label. Unlike other fresh hop beers I've had, this one was aggressive and I wasn't expecting that from Sierra Nevada. I couldn't believe that this beer is so well liked that they release it year after year. Not because it's a bad beer, but because of the aggressive hop oil presence. These hops had a more piney flavor and aroma than most other heavily hopped beers on the West coast. And I say good for Sierra Nevada for doing something different. It's a welcome change to see a fresh hop beer as a brewery's winter seasonal. Keep it up SN!","Philousa","Nov 23, 2011"

3.93,-5.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Far from the most interesting IPA I've had. In terms of flavor, 'character' and creativity, more like a pale ale that has been hopped up (an XPA perhaps). Much better in the bottle than on draught (which I had at Beer Revolution in Oakland, wasn't impressed). The character of the bitterness is palate destroying, so I wouldn't drink this one first. A 'solid' IPA, but not interesting enough to pick up as a seasonal, and not available enough to make it your standard IPA. To be fair, I'd say this about almost all of SN's beers.","JupiterJesus","Nov 22, 2011"

Pale malts, piney hops, a touch of citric hops, and a bit of spice round this IPA off nicely. Bittering bite in the back, and pretty smooth body here.

Good hop aroma, not too strong though. Taste is great, hops providing most of the flavor. Aggressive pine hops with some grapefruit character, with malt sweetness balance at the end. Hop character lingers afterwards. Well carbonated and has a good body. Creamy feel that is very drinkable. This beer is beyond drinkable, each sip makes me want more. I understand why people go through cases of this, it's a solid example of the style for a great price.","ShemRahBoo","Nov 13, 2011"

Aspriny bitterness on the tongue first, the piny hop presence resinates around the mouth. Medium on the feel, not too intense but def bold, bitter and dry with a boozy red wine finish. Overall; Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is something to look forward too every winter, no crazy clove or cinnamon beer can beat this one on the shelves.","gabedivision","Nov 13, 2011"

It's nice, and farily balanced. Taste is the same profile. It could use a little more hops in my opinion, just a little weak on that aspect. A little more hops and the taste would definitely get bumped up. Feel is crisp, medium bodied, and hoppy/carbonated- probably the best aspect of this beer. Overall, a very solid brew!

4.31,3.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall (4.5): This is the archetypal fresh hop IPA, in my mind.

The aroma, well it is pine atop citrus with caramel cent underneath. Fairly tasty, nice hop presence, pine, resin, citrus married to a more malty frame then I usually look for. Crystal malt adds a bit of sweetness to combat the bittering hops. Its is a well balanced beer with a bitter finish, clean, and well bodied. I'd buy this beer again, it is a nice tasting ipa that you don't have to over think.

The aroma of grapefruit and pear with a bit of freshly baked bread makes some pleasing sniffs. The taste is wonderfully balanced. Caramel and biscuit from the malts provide a solid backbone while piney hops build to a crescendo through the finish. Yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. They've never let me down yet.","DeltaGolfSierra","Nov 05, 2011"

Mouthfeel has a nice carbonated bitter hop bite, resinous oils hang on the tongue.

Aroma is that of toasted sweet bread, deep floral hops and perhaps a touch of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is a very hop forward one with no shame in slamming the palate with earthy pine and herbal hops riding very nicely on a robust malt base. The finish leaves a favorably bitter imprint on the palate and is quite refreshing (much enjoyed on this humid day) despite its very wintery warming character.

The head lingers going no where, nice gooey lace. Smells nice and hoppy. Very piney sweet smelling. The aroma is a bit shallow beyond the the sweet malt and piney hops, not bad, just simple. The flavor is quite bitter, coats the mouth with the bitterness. Very grapefruity, bitter pith, but also sweet ruby-red grapefruit flesh. This beer is definitely all about the hops. A faint toastiness develops in the long finish. The mouthfeel is fine, a bit coating, the bitterness definitely lingers as a physical sensation, not quite astringent, the carbonation is on point.

The aroma is mostly hops which I like, it makes me want to dive right into this beer. The other aromas are subtle enough that they are almost nonexistent in this one. There is a little bit of spiciness coming through in the nose as well. The taste is just hoppy, I guess there are some malt flavors in the far background of this beer but mostly all hops here.

The finish while still bitter does come with a taste of caramel and toffee. The toasted grains are dry and non cloying. The carbonation may seem a bit high, but perfect to keep aftertastes from lingering. The aftertaste last only long enough to remind you to have another quaff....

4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Conclusion: This is a very good IPA. That is spoken by someone who rarely seeks out examples of this much over-hyped style. I feel that this style of beer as a place, but that the addition of large amounts of hops to beer is a trend that often masks and detracts from styles that were never meant to be hop-driven in aroma or flavor. I digress. This is an American IPA, and thus it should be all about the big hop profile, which it is. I really enjoy this beer, and think that it still has elements of balance and craftsmanship, which I admire greatly. Sierra Nevada has long been one of the best users of hops in their beer, and this example deserves its reputation.","allforbetterbeer","Jan 16, 2011"

Sweet but not syrupy. Bitter but not dry. Carbonation seems a bit low. Very easy to drink and enjoy. Lighter fruit flavors and malty sweetness quickly give way to a hoppy finish, leaving you with a nice pine taste. Every year I forget how much I enjoy this beer.

Solid lacing that doesn't disappear until the end. The hoppy smell like grapefruit and pine got blended together. The taste even more powerful then the smell, with a sharp dry finish. Drinkability very nice, but this is all about the hopps, malt is barely noticable in the taste. A wonderful IPA, that will be my go too beer in November, December, and January for many years.","SawDog505","Dec 23, 2010"

It's overly bready and the hops aren't vibrant enough to pull it up out of the muddled flavors. This would be better if they made it cleaner or went full on with the malt.

Well if the head doesn't give it away, the nose will. Truck loads of grapefruit and other citrus aromas flood the senses. Palate starts out with lots of hops. Fruity and piney with alot of raw flavor. Finish is dry and bitter to the core. This is American IPA at it's purest. Not alot of balance but it works.

The piney hoppy aroma hits you the moment the bottle is cracked open. Beautiful lacing as you keep taking mouthfuls of this beauty. Strong on the hops, with a hint of sweet caramel, but the pine-hops flavor overpowers in a perfectly balanced way. Hands down one of the best IPA's around.

4.25,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"What an impressive head, very few beers show a thick lacing like Celebration does. Brassy amber color shows a bright clarity. Sharp citric and minty hop notes in the nose with some toasted grain in the back, a pretty big aroma. Medium bodied with a deep crispness. Hop bitterness is pretty sharp as it easily cuts through the malt from sip to sip. Hop flavors range from tobacco to mint, grapefruit peel to green tea. Toasted grain and a mild caramel maltiness lay deep beneath the hop character. Warming alcohol pokes through with a quick fume and clean fruitiness. Finishes bitter with a quick kiss of malt. This is the typical veteran hophead's first pick for winter seasonals and a great pick at that.","Jason","Dec 05, 2010"

On a scale of 1 to a 100 this beer is an 80. Good beer but breweries go through great lengths to fresh hop beer. This beer just has no craftsmanship, no soul.

4.65,12,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"I am wildly out of practice when it comes to pouring from a bottle, vice a CAN. Once the panic of a near-overflow subsided, I was looking at a rocky two fingers' worth of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both earthy and piney, like being out in the forest and taking a deep breath. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with an immediate burst of very piney hops on the tongue. Man, this is the kind of thing that caused me to become a hophead in the first place! Great Gaddang, but this was right in my skewed wheelhouse. It's a good thing that I liked it, since I bought a gigantor 24-ounce bottle and I could not find anyone to share it with me. Boo hoo. The finish swept through with a minty chill that really sent shivers up and down my spine. Peering into my glass, I took note of some lovely sticky lacing that looked like Jack Frost had been at work. A second, warmer pour released a really earthy aroma, like I had been out digging around in my backyard. I liked just letting it roll around on my tongue since the hops did not have a heavy bite, but more of a wintergreen flavor. Only $3.95 for this?!?

This is a fine beer to sip on a cold night when other, super malty warmers have got you down, or if you've just got a craving for a super bitter IPA that doesn't slap you in the face with hops.

Scent is DELICIOUS hoppy goodness with just a bit of malt. A lot of pine and grapefruit aromas. Taste is very delightful. It reminds me of a very fresh Torpedo with a bit more malt character. At first I get some pine, followed by grapefruit and sweet apricot flavors. Then followed by some hop bitterness with a bit of caramel malt. Very well-balanced IMO. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied with great carbonation. Drinkability is very high. I could see why people would complain about having an IPA as a Christmas/Winter ale, but I have no complaints.

Nice lacing around the glass. Smells of faint herbal hops, brown sugar and caramel. It almost smells more like a barley wine than an IPA, but it is from 2009 so that isn't surprising.

4.45,7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"A warm, translucent copper color with a thin sheet of lace. A lively carbonation feeds a two or three foamy islands on the surface of the beer. Definitive pine notes on the nose with a bright, juicy grapefruit aroma all backed by a firm malt character. These aromas persists on the palate though the hops take a stronger lead. The citrus is a bit more bitter than the aroma led me to believe but it's a pleasant surprise. It starts with a nice semi-sweet orange flavor leading to grapefruit and a dry, bitter pine needle finish. There's a certain earthy quality to it, like a pine forest after a rain shower, which I assume is due to the use of fresh hops. The bitterness is aggressive but not overwhelming and doesn't go any further than the malt will allow which is a definite plus. The strong malt backbone to this one helps provide a full, smooth mouthfeel that accentuates the flavors beautifully. I found this beer to be incredibly easy-drinking and it seemed to hit almost every note. If I had to pick something to improve I would say that the aroma could be amped up a little bit and maybe just a tiny bit more malt but that's my preference. As it is it's an outstanding IPA and a definite must try. I could see myself drinking a lot of these.","apbarwood","Nov 11, 2010"

I like this IPA because you can tell they use top notch fresh California hops with some really nice roasted caramel almost cherry like malts. The mix of the two is what makes this beer one of the best IPA's out there. I kind of forget what this tasted like last year but I just remember it being really hoppy. It still has that but since I'm so used to trying IPA's now that I'm used to that sort of bitterness. To the average beer drinker this will come across as bitter. To people who always drink IPA's this will come off as bitter mixing in with that sweet flavor to create a balanced but still ending hoppy beer. It sort of reminds me of a HopDevil from Victory but I'm enjoying this one a bit more. This is definitely in my top 5 IPA's. This is my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada.","thebrood1987","Oct 30, 2010"

Not sure why but the flavors are off from what I remember. Its still good as most brews from SN but too close to some of their other offerings such as the Pale Ale and Torpedo. It just doesn't stand out like it used to. The hop bitterness is there but it seems as though they are using different flavoring hops then they used to. My friends have also noticed this.

There was also some light citrus and maybe a few other hoppy notes. The healthy malt base gave this IPA a very good balance. The hop profile is very complex and reflects the scents found in the nose.

The taste generally follows, but the hops, which add a bit o' pine to their repertoire here, seem to dominate the caramel, which is no longer as sweet as it once appeared. The new piney-ness lingers on through the aftertaste. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a very easygoing feel.

A big citrusey bouquet with a light sweet pine and caramel. A bit of bread and yeasty dough. Taste has a firm grapefruit hoppiness with a caramel malt center. A fresh whole grain loaf mixes with the malt backbone and opens a door for the sweetness to flow. It gives good balance and then the finish brings the hop parade again. A lingering grapefruit skin has a touch of quinine as well but in all the finish is clean and dry. A dark grained cracker like presence hints at graham but not quite. Feel is crisp and refreshing with an effervescence that brings a light creaminess if you let it hang out in your mouth. You can easily go through a couple of 24 oz bottles like the one I have before me.

4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is by the book. It has a nice balance between slight leafy bitterness, floral hop, some grapefruit acerbic citrus notes in the hop, and nice malty backbone, some drying hop elements, some nice graininess in there too. This is a very traditional interpretation of an AIPA, but it doesn't have the exceptional orangey hop burst, or the ripe oily and estery hop presence dripping from the vine, it doesn't make a grand statement. It is traditional, good, solid, but I wouldn't rate this as exceptional, just very good for the style. In some ways the beer is just too clean, too conformist, too by the book. It seems that other brewers of AIPA styles are a bit more inventive and more aggressive in their interpretation and have passed SN by somewhere along the line.","albern","Jan 16, 2010"

Taste hits with a lot of bitterness and a strong citrus/piney hop flavors. This is held up with some very nice caramel toffee notes in the malt background.

The aroma is pungent grapefruit along with a caramel breadiness that pairs well with the bitterness of it. The flavor matches the aroma with a bitterness sticking to the tongue. With warmth, the bitterness subsides a bit as more residual sugars are allowed to display the caramel malt used in this brew. The mouthfeel is fuller without being heavy.

The nose was of the bitter hops with a hint of citrus. Like other Sierra Nevada brews, the bitterness of the hops dominates at first, but does mellow into a crisp finish.

Maybe it's because of the interaction with the hops, but it has a red candy flavor to it. The hops taste dark and herbal and contribute a very strong, blunt, bitter finish that lingers.

Faint kiss of floral and citrus plus a hint towards a nice malt presence. Taste is a big punch of piney, earthy hops - very cologne like, which is a slight turn off - faint floral and citrusy hops noted right before a slight malty backbone presents itelf. Finishes very bitter and dry with a noticible aftertaste. Not in my wheelhouse as far as IPAs go, had higher hopes for this but the hop profile just turns me off from full enjoyment.

As hoppy as any IPA I could want, but with some malty backboneto follow it up, this is an absolutely fantastic beer all around.

I enter this exercise with a profound bias, this is one of my favorites. Pours clear copper, active, 1 finger white head, great retention and thick lacing. SMELL gets better as it warms, but starts with a strong blast of west coast hops. Caramel maltyness becomes more prominent as it warms. Has legs. TASTE is hop forward, but again, as it warms, becomes much more balanced and smooth. Malty sweetness balances the floral and citrusy hop flavors and the fairly sharp bitterness, which is more prominent toward the finish and then lingers. Some booze is noticeable as well. FEEL rich, rull, viscous, some alcholic warming, dry bitter finish. OVERALL, this is a classic west coast IPA, and one that is very well done. Easy drinking, even sessionable, if you like the style.","sprucetip","Dec 10, 2009"

Aroma is lightly toasted malt and grassy hops.

It is overall very juicy, spicey, and aromatic, with alcohol just adding a warm fullness. It has balanced bitterness and sweetness, with lingering, faintly bitter spiciness. The feel is soft and full but light and not quite oily. It is excellent, complex, just assertive enough while still being restrained and balanced, and very drinkable.","Offa","Nov 28, 2009"

3.91,-5.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle (2009 vintage) served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy amber with a dense, two-inch, off-white head with excellent retention - this is a beautiful beer to behold. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick, semi-concentric bands of lacing forming as the brew recedes. Mild nose - a hint of citrus and some floral hops aromas. Aromas translate to the flavor profile; however a malty character comes out to form the backbone, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a background carbonation that falls just shy of prickly. Sierra Nevada is definitely a workhorse brewery - I'm rarely disappointed with anything I buy from them, and Celebration is no different. A nice example of the style; however, definitely gravitating towards the more bitter end of the spectrum.","Jwale73","Nov 27, 2009"

Tastes incredibly bitter at first, but the citrus and the hops subside quickly to create a very interesting flavour. The carbonation is a bit strong, but the taste is still quite pleasant. Sierra Nevada is one of the best breweries out there, while they don't make the best beers, they do make the best that you can easily find in your local market (around here at least). This is the perfect example of that, are there better IPA's? Sure. Are there better ""holiday"" themed beers? Sure.

It does have a great, complex flavor and is easier to drink than many IPAs.

It has a very hoppy aroma, with lots of floral and pine scents. The main flavor is of hops. It tastes woodsy at first. The bitterness of the hops begins to take over, lingering after you swallow. There is a smokey, wooden taste that is hinted at behind the hops. Overall, it tastes dry and refreshing. I'm giving the beer a 4.5 for flavor right now, as I believe it will improve as it gets a bit warmer (this glass was served slightly colder than I usually drink and review beers). The dryness and crispness of the beer lends itself to a great mouthfeel. It doesn't coat too much, nor does it tickle your throat as you swallow. I think this is a supremely drinkable beer. I could go through a six pack and not get tired of it. I only knocked it down half a point because I like to have a bit of a malty beer every once in a while when drinking something as hoppy as this. Still, I'm quite impressed with this beer. It's going to be the go to beer for our annual Christmas party this year.","ToasterChef","Nov 21, 2009"

I could taste some citrus in there too, which was great. But again, something in the taste, for the two beers I had, just seemed really strange and a tad displeasing. I still enjoyed the beer but the strange unidentifiable flavor kind of left me with a not-so-good aftertaste.

The aroma is fruity, almost berry-like with a good dose of hops in there as well. The mouthfeel runs about medium-to-heavy. The taste is well-hopped with a strong berry hint in the background.

This is a really delicious looking beer. Some pine and then a wallop of grapefruit and other citrus notes hit the nose first. Has some sweet initially on the palate from the malt, which transforms into a floral hop flavor with citrus and a mellow bitter finish. It has a pretty light mouthfeel that is even creamy a bit sticky. I definitely had lower expectations for this beer, as I usually do with other Sierra Nevadas. Many people love all of their offerings, but what I've doesn't really jive well with my tastes, most notably the Pale Ale. However, this was a pretty balanced IPA, which I definitely did not expect from Sierra Nevada. I would drink this again and would suggest it to others.

The smell is kind of restrained. Malts and hops. Pine. Taste redeems the smell though, piney hops, wood-like flavor feel to it, malts. The hops linger and give a bit of a nice warming. Malts also serve to balance well, although the hops have more of a say. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice coating of hoppy goodness on the tongue, carbonation is good here as well.

I like it better than the original SNPA, it is similar but has a bit more body, a bit more character, and a bit more substance to it.

4.11,-1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"24oz (perfect size, IMO) bottle picked up today at Table and Vine. Pours a semi-translucent orange-amber. Matter can be seen floating in tiny pieces throughtout the whole glass. The head is very nice, three fingers to begin with but dies down to two fingers and stays nice and creamy, very good retention. The head already begins to leave thick lacing down the glass as it dies down. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. Smell is pretty simple but good. Smells of basically light malts and piney hops, a good balance of the two. Also some citrus can be picked up here too. The overall strength could be a bit higher though. Taste here is also simple and basically the same as the smell. The balance between the malts and hops is great. The huge amount of piney hop flavor reminds me of the holiday season and is very effective. Some citrus can be picked up but it is tasteful and adds a nice element in the background of the pine hops. A downside here is the alcohol will come into play when it warms up and it ruins hte flavor for me, try and enjoy this one while its pretty cool. Mouthfeel is fitting. It is moderate bodied with a decent creamyness, nice medium carbonation and no alcohol warming(when its cool). The hops leave a nice coat on the tongue that will last for a long time after the beer is finished. The MF suits the flavors well. Drinkability is good. The taste is great, the only thing here is the hops that will die down and the beer will taste like alcohol. The price is great ($3.50 a 24oz). I will probably buy this one while it is out for some good sessions to come.","cbutova","Nov 08, 2009"

Carbonation is medium to high giving the hops an extra boost. Drinkability is good and I would say this would be a good one to drink on any occasion.

The taste is ideal for an IPA. Thick, chewy bready backbone. Understated sweet toasty caramel malt with the perfect amount of fresh complex oily hop bitterness.

The taste did reveal more biscuit and maltiness, but it was also still heavily dominated by pine and citrus.

Has a rich amber color to it with nice clarity to it as well, so the amount of flavor is a bit surprising. Very little bad to say about it, but if I had to be picky about it I don't find the aroma exceptionally strong, but still a nice hoppy smell to it. Very drinkable you could chug it if you want, but I would never recommend it, very much worth savoring this one.","AndyAvalanche","May 24, 2009"

Actually more sessionable now. I pick up a bit of fruitness but after four swallows, can't quite pinpoint it.

4.03,-2.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark hazy redish orange with a frothy white head that fades fast and leaves lacing. The smell is mostly hops with sweet notes, with some subtle spice notes. The smell could be subdued due to the cellaring (this is a 2008 release). The taste starts with a bite with some bitter hops followed by the spice and sweet notes, and finishes with the bitter hops again. The aftertaste is a long drawn out hop flavor. The mouthfeel is ok, the harsh bitter bite can turn some away, but the veteran hophead will fall in love. The flavor is deep, not very complex, but good. This is definitely a celebration of hops, and delicious beer. A good beer, great flavor.","wingman14","May 12, 2009"

Just as clear, less fizzy, and more red (almost pinish, even)--for me those are all positives. Less hops and more malt both in the smell and in the taste. This is a very nice beer--somewhere between a red and a pa/ipa--and that suits me just fine. It's not as big as many seasonal releases; I expected it to be a slightly bigger beer, closer in that regard to Bigfoot. But there is nothing to complain about and plenty to enjoy. As it warms, a nice malty sweetness becomes more noticeable. This is definitely a beer that you could drink all night at a holiday celebration.","PhiloPsych","Jan 10, 2009"

The smell is one of alcohol, with an ABV of 6.8% There is a nice residue of brewer's lace forming along the side of the glass as well. The taste is one of a highly drinkable IPA. There is a lingering bite of hops on the tounge, and a floral finish typical of IPAs. Most Christmas beers are loaded with spices, fruits, or some other type of flavoring, but not this beer, which is nice. I also like the fact that Sierra Nevada puts the ABV on the bottle.

The smell is pine, caramel, bitter citrus and, although this is repetitive, distinctly hoppy. The flavor is cleanly bitter with hop flavors that come through with more pine and floral strength than citrus. I'm not a big fan of their pale ale. I appreciate Sierra Nevada and their role in brewing, but it almost seems like they sacrifice some quality to pump out so much of the pale ale. The Celebration strikes me as the beer that the pale ale should be. The hops are clear, clean and bitter. There are no off-flavors and the whole package is immensely drinkable. The feel is a tad watery, but it doesn't get in the way of the flavor. Sierra Nevada is obviously capable of making great beer and lots of it. I just wish I could find this beer as easily as the pale ale and all year round. In my mind, this is the definitive American IPA against which all others should be judged.","popery","Dec 15, 2008"

4.2,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A 2008 version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. The snowy country scene on the bottle is encircled by an arrangement of poinsettias. The beer pours a nice amber color with an impressively stubborn and sticky head that left lacing throughout. The aroma signals the hops about to be consumed. Citrus, pine, and herbal round out the bouquet. When the beer is cold, hops assault the palate in a very impressive, enjoyable way with floral bitterness and citrus acidity. As the beer warms a nutty and bready malt character emerges to provide balance to the hoppy onslaught. Warm or cold the beer is a pleasant experience. The medium bodied ale flows across palate and leaves a dry lingering bitterness. As the beer vanishes you can start to feel a warmness in your chest, reminding you that this is winter beer after all.

It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall (fresh) this was very similar to Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale. It was fairly clean and easy to drink.

The Celebration is packed with an extremely fresh hop character. It has a lot of pine and some resin characters that make it pretty enjoyable.

Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, some stick, medium bodied. Oddly, the taste is a lot more robust than the aroma.

It finishes with bitter hops which leave a great flavor behind. Very drinkable and the 6.8% isn't noticable at all..at first.

Smells of malt sweetness (some sugary fruit (apple) and caramel), slightly boozy peppery spice, and a light grapefruit and even slighter soapy hop presence still lingers; likely subdued over two years of aging. An effervescent, tasty, ever-present, lingering, spicy hop profile hits the palate first, though certainly not overwhelming. No real bitterness just a spiciness that is tamer than your average pale ale, but is fun and warming. I was expecting some heavy malt; but really just a light, almost fruity sweetness exists -- notes of juicy apple, and toffee. This beer is not overly complex only a few dominant flavors exist, but it is fun and fits the winter warmer style nicely.

A wonderful session beer, and one that is a defenite go to.","AKBelgianBeast","Mar 11, 2008"

Drinkability is very high for the style and abv, which can be attributed to the beer being well balanced.

It overall had a pretty malty taste, but there was a sourish-bitter aftertaste to it that seemed off. A great carbonation helps this drink and gives it a good punch. However, that bitterness cannot be masked by the mouthfeel, so its drinkability is hindered.","fitzy84","Mar 10, 2008"

Bitter spiciness hits the tounge with the first sip, followed by a nice malty back bone. It ends with some nice alcoholic warmth. Nice and bubbly with a medium body and a crisp finish.

Small, frothy, off-white head that diminishes quickly like most Sierra Nevada products that I have had in the past. Aroma is very pleasent with hopps and grapefruit and a molasses undertone. Also smell a little hint of apple. Flavor starts sweet and then goes to the bitter IPA taste that you either love or hate. The finish lasts a long long time.

The mouthfeel is soft if a bit thin. The drinkability is good, although hops-dominant beers are always an uhill climb for me.

I'm also surprised at the body; it seems a bit thin and makes the beer rather perilously drinkable at nearly 7 percent alcohol. Visually the beer is quite appealing, at least at first, but upon closer inspection I can notice some little white dots (proteins?) in suspension; floating in the beer. Maybe it's yeast, I dunno. It's okay I guess, because the beer tastes good. The caramel malt and hops balance is quite good with a lingering bitterness in the finish. This long, bitter and dry finish is perhaps the most enjoyable quality of this beer, that and I suppose it's dangerous drinkability.","marcobrau","Dec 18, 2007"

It lingers on the sides of the glass, creating lacing with every swallow. The smell is a little weak compared to the taste. You sense a nice hop aroma with a little maltiness. The taste, however, is great. It's got a great big hop character balanced by a mild sweetness reminiscent of dark molasses. On the back of the tongue I found that, along with the ruby red grapefruit flavor found in hoppy beers, I tasted maraschino cherries. Overall this is a gem of a Christmas ale. Many times, holiday ales are so sweet and spiced that if you have more than one you start to feel sick.

Again, I hate to make the comparison, but if you love the pale ale's distinctive hop taste, this is like twice the amount of goodness. Very smooth and crisp, but leaves a rather bitter aftertaste, which isn't unpleasant. Overall, a very, very delicious beer. If this were made year-round, the pale ale would stand no chance. I think this IPA destroys their 2007 anniversary ale, which was a bit disappointing.","zerofear13","Dec 01, 2007"

It's really more of your typical IPA. Last years stock wasn't the best ever, but it had an excellent spice/cinnamon thing going on and I may have enjoyed it even more than this year. IMO, if they would merge this year & last it would be perfect. On to my review... A - Nice auburn with slight puffy tan head that laced the glass well. S - Hops, hops, hops. T - More hops, where's the spice? Some citrus & pine bite, but bitter hops all the way.

Hard to detect any balance, but I found that the citrusy character really mellowed out the bitterness. Is it possible for hoppy citrusness to balance out hop bitterness?

I have to admit, the taste was very pleasant indeed. It stood it's ground in my mouth yet was not overpowering nor diminutive. A light hint of smoke, hoppy and over all pleasant. It unfortunately, leaves a strong aftertaste that lingers longer than some houseguests! The mouth-feel was the true winning quality in this ale. It wasn't thick, nor thin and carbonation was spot on. The overall drinkability was good; I would pair this with a burger or some barbecue anyday. A nice strong cheese or anything salty for that matter would really be a partner to this very drinkable but otherwise undistinguished IPA.

On the palate there is bitter white grapefruit, pine, apricot, lime?, toasted/caramel malts, and some heat. The body is medium, with coating, almost numbing hop oils, and it leaves a long, citric finish.

Mouthfeel is well balanced with good carbonation and a fairly full body without being heavy. This beer is a treat when it comes out every year. A very well balanced ipa that is best when fresh and from a store that has kept it refrigerated. I think it is particularly good this year.","Georgiabeer","Jan 19, 2007"

That malt starts the flavor off, and then midway, the citrusy hop flavors become present and linger on the palate long after the beer has passed by.

Of course, if you like that beer this is definitely worth a try! And on it's own it's worth a shot as well. I think that I'll limit myself to just this 6-pack, though -- after you've tried it, you might find it a bit pointless to try again.

A bit odd, but I guess thats what happens when it ages. Medium mouthfeel, but with a smoother finish. Its hard to say which I prefer, the aged or the fresh.

Frothy off-white head pours convex (!) into my bulb, and seems to last a good five minutes before subsiding. Lacing is about as good as it gets. Nose is grapefruit, juicy pineapple, and resiny pine with both pale and biscuity malts all but submerged in the background. First sip is piquant; spicy hops meet pungent-but-well-mannered yeast and sweet pale malt. A firm but not overshadowing hop bitterness lingers from one sip (or gulp) to the next. Fruity, with notes of honeydew and pear. The alcohol is considerable not as prominent as it might be if this were a lighter-bodied brew - it shows itself in between the sweet, light fruit notes of the malt and the firmly bitter (and slightly citric) hops. Moderately full bodied but drinks ""lighter"" than it is. Carbonation is ample . . . has a cleansing, semi-creamy mouthfeel, never a dull moment! The hops really shine here, with both aromatic and bittering qualities vying for your complete attention, and of the latter there's always been some of the same back-of-the-throat bitterness that you'll get when eating a fresh grapefruit. Slightly minty qualities to these hops, too . . .A classic brew, and about as consistent as they come. Also one of the benchmarks for the American IPA style - hardly a hop-bomb, this is a well-balanced and full-featured brew that seems to offer something for everyone!","Chaz","Dec 23, 2006"

The taste is again spicy from the hops with a bit of citrus flavor to round off the spice. There is a peppery bitter aftertaste as well that will stay with you for a while. The taste reminds me of something but I can't place it though. The alcohol isn't really noticable masked by the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is good with the right amount of carbonation light for a winter beer but good for an IPA. An IPA is an intersting choice for a winter beer but this one works, because of the high level of spicy hops for me the drinkability is a little low because of the intense flavor.

A quick burst of honeylike earthy sweetness that quickly gets replaced by a big grapefruit hop presence. This is just thick with oily and piney hop character. Dancing across the tongue, the light malt is completely overshadowed by a clinic in the flavour characteristics of hops. Not as flowery as some, but everything else is there in full force. Be warned, there's little in the way of a yin/yang balance in this one, it's just one hell of a hop wallop. This one dries the palate nicely, and I didn't find it to be overcarbonated, just enough to introduce you to the flavour profile. Drinkability comes down to your enjoyment of bitter beers, and for me, this could be a great session ale in the right mood. Some days I was a hop monster, some days I don't.

4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale 2006! Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date on it. Poured into a pint glass - clear, definitely orange color, medium sized head. Excellent retention - it lasted all throughout the tasting. Smell is overall sweet and warm: toasted grain, spices like clove and cinnamon, oranges. Taste is complex: begins with a light brush of hops on the tongue. They open fully on the back of the tongue. Strong pine, some acidic citrus quality, too. Not much of the barley or spices. The hops seem to get stronger as the beer warms to room temperature. Good aftertaste - the hops continue to morph. Mouthfeel is right up the middle: not too watery, not too creamy. Overall, a strong offering in both the Christmas ale and IPA categories. Would gladly pick up one of these again.","ndekke39","Dec 03, 2006"

Aroma reminiscant of grapefruit and pinetree with a hint of orange peel. Though the three ""C"s (Cascade, Chinook and Centennial) dominate there is a slightly sweet malt and alcohol note to the nose. Flavor is hop-dominated with a good amount of malt backbone. Quite delicious. More malt and alcohol notes as the beer warms. Decent body with a slight stickiness perhaps from the high amount of hop resins? Overall, a very enjoyable American-style IPA, too bad it's only available during the holiday season.","Tesno","Dec 03, 2006"

It starts out clean and bright with a silky mouthfeel and then comes a wave of light sweetness & autumn leafy hop complexity, and then comes the hard concentrated hop finish that lasts and lasts. The 2006 has a burst of pleasant hops at the start leading into a long lingering hop finish, but it is far thinner on the palate--there is a whole mid-range fullness/richness missing, and the overall hop impact, despite the nice long finish, doesn't have the same lush glory without the core complexity to play off of.

Smells of a balanced mixture of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, bright citrus, pine resin, and slight butter notes. Oily hops hit first on the tongue and remain as an underlying flavor throughout the tasting, on to the aftertaste. In the middle there comes the sweet malt body, full of toasty, candy-like tones. Finishes bitter and slightly dry. Mouthfeel is certainly more than middle of the road and it has a slight, prickly carbonation which amplifies the hops on the tongue.

On the tongue, initial citrus sourness mixes with distinct, saliva-producing bitterness -- just the right amount, not too little, not too much, not too harsh. Carbonation is substantial but not overdone as it helps all the flavors of this beer come out. Malt sweetness provides a solid base. The finish is long and smacks of whole-grain bread.

I walked in not expecting much, but to my sheer delight, there was a sierra nevada 2005 celebration ale sixer from last year sitting in the cooler. Needless to say I was siked. Anyway, pours a really nice looking dark orange/bordering on red coloration, with a relatively thick white heading that lasted right up until the end. Smell was my only gripe with this beer. Seemed to smell like wet dogs hair, although it did get better as it warmed up a little bit...oxidation? Im not sure. Taste on the other hand was really super...the hops in this beer really attack your taste buds to the point where you can taste them well after finishing a glass. Mouthfeel was pretty heavy, but not overpowering. This is an awesome sipping beer...it really warms you up. The alcohol is also really well hidden, so ide recommend being careful with this one. This is a really awesome beer, complex yet simple at the same time...my favorite offering from the sierra nevada guys.

Malty sweetness has taken over and the piney, grapefruity character of the hops has diminished. The beer had a medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability was fairly high and no alcohol was evident.

The taste is wonderfully complex, and the thick and sweet malts present stronger as the drink warms. A wonderful beer that simply gets better with each sip. Great to sip slowly and really appreciate, or refreshing to drink relatively quickly as one would a standard IPA such as Harpoon.

Very dense foam shows excellent retention and leaves rings of sticky lace. Hoppy nose, pine and citrus and a slight herbal/earthy aroma. Toasted amber malt first, then raw american hops take over the flavor leaving a coarse yet satisfying aftertaste. Herbal and bitter, it balances well with the sweet amber malt flavor. The medium body and high carbonation smooth out the onslaught of hop oils and the mouthfeel turns out rich instead of harsh with a surprisingly mild finish. An outstanding IPA.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 08, 2006"

I didn't notice much difference between the draft and bottled versions. Bars are dark so my 56 year-old eyes didn't get to enjoy the apprearance as much as I do at home.

The flavor is very hoppy and it is just like the aroma with lots of grapefruit and spicy hops, the bitterness lingers along with the flavor well into the finish and the malt is hard to identify.

The taste was just terrific with loads of hops just jumping all over my tongue. Initial hop bitterness grows ever so slightly with each sip leaving behind an aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip. Just delightful!

Very good lacing along the edge of the glass. A strong, but not overpowering, hoppy aroma that somehow started out a little fruity and then mellowed. The aroma itself literally made me salivate. The amount of hops in this beer explodes in the mouth (really meant for those who love their hops). A nice crisp finish to the beer, in spite of the level of hops present. A very drinkable beer in itself, but I'm not sure if I would have more than one in a sitting.

The alcohol is barely noticeable and the malt and hops are both well represented with neither overpowering the other. This is much like a bit heavier Sierra Pale Ale. A little more of everything, but is still refreshing enough to not wear out the palate. After recording my initial impressions, this beer was used to wash down a roasted garlic white pizza which had four heads of garlic in the sauce and topping.

It is hard to review them as a vertical tasting as the hops mellow as it ages. This one is probably the most balanced of all that I have tried thus far...out of the box. Contrary to many others, this is not my favorite beer. I am amused by it though, so I have to keep trying it. I normally put some back too, so I can try it later. I believe that this beer is really in its prime at least 4-6 months after its release.

Pours a bright, translucent amber hue topped by a nice-looking inch or so if creamy white head. Pleasing aroma of crisp, spicy hops, tempered by some caramel malt and the lingering essence of black pepper. Hop flavor is sharp and assertive up front, mellowed only slightly by some caramel malt. Notes of pine, black pepper, grapefruit, and some astringency come through. Body is rich and creamy, belying the character of most American IPAs.

At first I didn't even notice the hops but on the second sip it was obvious, not overly but quite present and very distinct. It's very complex with a heavy hopping that isn't too heavy and the hops are quite delecate. You can even smell the hops before you take a sip which tells you you're in for something interesting.

I did not detect the spiced accents that Ive come to expect in other holiday beers. I only found a resin and pine aftertaste. Mouthfeel was also disappointing -- oily and thin are the words that best capture it for me.

Brew pours to a amber color with a small off white head that has pretty good retention and leaves a lot of lacing through out. The aroma is hoppy in character to say the least with pine like scents dominating followed by a caramel malt flavor. I think the hops really seem to make distinguishing some of the spices quite hard. The taste is nice, starts real smooth, and then quickly breaks to a strong hop flavor of pine that stays in the mouth for quite a while. Again, this is a very smooth tasting brew, one that I must say makes my day when it is available. A favorite.","Stimack","Nov 23, 2005"

There is also quite a bit of delicious sweet and caramel malt lurking in the background- which the pletiful hop easily keeps in check. Really just fantastic tasting stuff. Lots of nuances come together to really make this taste like the holidays without being at all gimicky. It really manages to have huge hop and malt flavor and still be very subtle. Mouthfeel is great- medium to full bodied, smooth and creamy. Definitely very drinkable. I don't find this at all cloying which I find can be a problem with other holiday beers' drinkability.

The taste begins with a big blas of hops: citrusy (grapefruit orange and lemon), pine resiny, and herbal followed by a spicy flavor, and a big toasted bread and caramel malt character that balances the hops.

Smell is fragrant hops, mainly pine but a little bit flowery, with a slight bit of spices. Taste is a flavorful burst of hops, grapefruit and citrus primarily, trailing into a bold spicey bitter finish. There's a malt taste lingering somewhere in the background, but it never really comes forward, but they do just enough to keep the hops from overwhelming. Medium body, dry finish, and a very smooth feel. And at 6.8% this is no slouch in the alcohol, but I could down these all night.

Sweet caramel upfront gives way to huge fresh juicy hop oils. Not as citrusy as the nose led me to believe, but equally earthy and spicy. Pith emerges through a very toasty, smooth finish laden with spicy hops. Also there's a definite, intriguing hint of of rosemary... Very nice hop character coupled with a tremendous malt backbone. Almost no brash, harsh bitterness, instead it seems restrained and subtle. Mouthfeel is beautiful, medium with creamy carbonation. Perhaps it could be a tad fuller. Sessionable.

Taste starts off heavily bitter with floral/piney hops but smooths out and sweetens up as it warms with citrus and tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is rich for an IPA and nicely carbonated.

The flavor is nice, with maltiness bordering on sweet without being the least big cloying - I don't know how they pull it off but SN always does. There is a bit of hop note as well. PRobably my biggest hit on the beer is that its been topped by other offerings in terms of ""bigness", but this remains one of the more drinkable beers in its class and is consistent year-after-year without being boring and predictable.","KroMagnon","Aug 15, 2005"

Hoppy taste with some fruit and caramel thrown in for good measure; these citric notes are heavenly. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a great hop aftertaste with lingering orange notes.

Aroma is entirely of strong citrusy hop smell. The taste is big and hoppy. Strong bitterness in the finish, which lasts a good while after the sip is complete. This is maybe just a little too bitter for it's own good, a little more tasty hop flavor profile might kick the taste up to a 4.5 in my rating scheme. Then again, this is only my 3rd IPA, so what do I really know. Anyhow, I still very much enjoyed Celebration Ale and will be picking it up again next winter.","Gagnonsux","Jan 19, 2005"

The 2004 edition pours into a pint glass an orange/amber with a three finger creamy white head that is dense, frothy, and looks stiff enough to sit things on it... it persisted nicely, and left lace on the sides until the beer was, sniff, gone... I'm not sure why others have noted no head at all. The nose jumps at you with fruity citrus hops, a little orange sweetness there, too. Taste is sweet malt backbone that is overwhelmed and bubbling over with citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is creamy initially, a little thinner as I reach the end. The light carbonation seems to bubble on the tongue, and the hops persist to leave the tongue tingling with a touch of bitter long after the beer is down the hatch.","babydoc","Jan 14, 2005"

Too bad it's not available year round. A rock solid IPA that is very drinkable despite it's 6.8 ABV. With all the over the top seasonal beers out there I've tried, I always find myself going back to this classic IPA. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".

Very hoppy as I would expect from SN, phenomenal!! Wow! Spicey, piney not too sweet. This beer tastes like Christmas. I want one of these while opening my presents this year (which will hopefully be more of these).

4.39,5.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Good stuff. Pours to a creamy white head and orangey color. Aroma is hop-dominated with a good deal of pale maltiness shining through. Flavor is bittersweet, quite well-balanced for an American IPA, strong bitterness with a sweet malt backbone holding it up. Very pleasant IPA aftertaste and mouthfeel. Wow. I bought this not knowing it was an IPA (I had bought Pyramid IPA to serve at the Xmas party along with this beer, Czechvar and my homebrewed stout). It is excellent. It has the right balance of slightly toasty-caramel maltiness and the generous bitterness, flavor and aroma of the finest U.S. ale hops. Worth the extra money. A sixpack of Celebration Ale costs over $9 in OK and I consider it more worth the expense than the $7.50 for any Pyramid beer, incuding the IPA!","EagleTalon","Dec 19, 2004"

Not too bitter though. A great example of an American IPA. No detection of the 7% alcohol anywhere. Its mouthfeel is very nice. Not too light or too heavy. Its drinkability is only slightly above average because I just can't drink a bunch of IPA's in a row. I enjoy them very much, just not a bunch at once.

Nothing special about the appearance, typical light brown color with nice, lasting head and ok lacing. Smell is very fruity - I can't place a finger on which particular fruit though. Something citrusy, like lemon or grapefruit even. Man, this is a hoppy beer. Might be too bitter for some, but I love me some hops. Drinkability is way up there...despite the 7% ABV I feel like I could easily make this a ""session"" beer.

I'm immediately smaked upon the nose with the wonderful cascade hop. Smells delicious. This beer starts of with a citrusy aroma, but it ends with a grassy, hoppy bitter chinook bite. After a couple of sips I can pick up some of the grassyness in the aroma. There's just so much going on with this beer. Such complex hoppyness, and dry as a bone. Nothing sweet here. This is one of the most delicious beers I've ever tasted. I have five more of these to drink! I doubt I'll refridgerate any of them.","moocey","Dec 16, 2004"

The smell is of sweet caramel and nutmeg malts with sweet sour hoppy citrus. The combo of smells is outrageous.

Starts out lightly sweet with floral hop flavors blending with the sweetness then the bitter grapefruit comes up with carbonation leading the way and announces itself all else falls away to bitterness for a while then it fades some and sweetness is tasted again as it finishes. This beer leaves a nice hop resin coating on your tounge to remind you its time for another drink. Mouthfeel is a good solid meium drinkability is also good nice hop strong regular IPA very good but not quite a masterpiece.

The label is somehow psychologically soothing, and I like it. It pours out of the bottle like beaten copper with a ruby tinge. A big bubbly head rolls up and clings in loving lace patterns in big chunks of froth. The vision of the beer itself is almost hypnotically soothing, watching the head slowly recede and leave those patterns of lace on the glass. Once I take a whiff I get somewhat of a wake up call though. Sweet sticky malts over-come by resinous pine aromas, lemon grass, and citrus rinds. The combination is almost candy-sweet, but brash and assertive at the same time. This beer tastes great as well. The malts are present and nicely sweet, but light on the tongue. The hops, obviously, dominate this beervibrating mid-pallate like I had a penny on my tongue. Resinous pine and bitter citrus rind present themselves toward the finish, very lovely. A great IPA with classic Sierra Nevada style. Let me say that I love this beer, but there are some behemoths in the IPA category that are really hard to touch, Sierra Nevada still does an awesome job with this beer.","FormatKid","Nov 05, 2004"

Strong piney flavors remind me of my least favorite hops, but maybe they just overhopped in general. I like the toasted malt that's in there, but it could use a lot more to achieve a sense of malt-hop balance. Some spices are in there, but the bitterness of the hops blasts them off the palate, and I can't tell what spices are actually there. The mouthfeel is decent.

This is the 2004 brew, and there are so many spices and nuances, your senses are provided with quality stimuli. Beer was purchased at 6.99 a six pack, and judging by the review on this site, i was happy to pay. I think Sierra nevada has a tendancy to have more carbonation than neccesary, but I thought this beer had a nice compromise. Poured a deep red/brown color. Looks like some yeast still remain, so not quite filtered as it's Pale Ale brother. It's more filling than Pale ale I can tell you that much. The taste was very complex and I felt the holiday ""spirits"" immediatly. I'm not experienced enough to know what specific ingredients and what processes produce a specific taste, but I can say that Celebration Ale tastes like an evening in a cabin during the dead of winter with the fire blazing and you snuggled up under a warm semi-stiff blanket. For being a 6.8% beer, you hardly taste the alcohol. Some beers rely on that alcohol taste to ""flavor"" the beer, but not this one.

Now for the taste. The 04 seems extremely fresh and chock-full-of-hoppiness delight. The 03 has a much drier and weaker hop presence. I must add that the 2003's head is much more sticky and the lacing is out of this world compared to the 2004. The mouthfeel is great on both years although the 03 is much more enjoyable. This is truly a fine specimin for an IPA and I look forward to it each year. I had to, of course, buy a case of the 04. I will be cellaring a six pack for future years.

You have to swallow the beer fast and evade the taste bud hop attack to even pick up on the maltyness. But that's ok, I don't think this beer was intended to be well balanced in that respect, it's just a hop extravaganza. Very bitter finish as well.

The taste is as good as it gets. Hints of a sweet malt surrounded and overtaken by citrusy hops. Plenty of Cascades in this one. This is a hophead's delight. Great medium body.

The other surprise about Celebration is that it goes down super smooth. Aftertaste is pure hops without being overly bitter. Just that nice smooth bitterness. All around an exceptional beer.

The taste and mouthfeel are what set this beer apart from other IPAs. The thick head looks deceptively solid, but reveals itself to be pure silk making for one of the smoothest mouthfeels I have ever experienced in a beer. The taste is briefly sweet with some citrus but quickly gives way to an assertive floral hop profile that is presented perfectly and lingers long after each sip.

Had a spicy hoppy scent, with a caramel-sweet maltiness hovering in the background. While the taste is dominated by hoppiness, its not overbearing like many IPAs I've known. While subdued by comparison, the maltiness is definitely not afraid to come out and play, with a nice caramel flavor that complements the spiciness of the hop flavor quite well.

Huge, mouth-watering Cascade in the nose along with a sweetish maltiness. The front is very bitter but settles to a sweet, malty, somewhat creamy middle. Hoppy bitter in the finish, of course. Grapefruit burps. This is a very tasty Cascades IPA with a full malty middle. I love the hop monsters, but this one really needs to warm up for the malt to take the edge off the hops.

This beer is surprisingly firm, yet smooth, in the mouthfeel department. The 6.8% abv makes this a true winter warmer! This brew is lip-smacking, mouthwatering good! This is a must try!

4.15,0,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"2003 was the first year I tasted this, which turns out to be something I should have done earlier. Pours starting out with a nice two-finger head, fluffy in the middle, with a medium bead. After a minute or two, head subsides and remains at about one finger or so. Abundant bubble strings streaming through deep bronze-colored liquid, almost glowing orange around the edges of the glass when held up to light. Nice color! Lace is clingy at first; later slides easily down sides of glass. Aroma is distinctly citric and hoppy; by aroma alone you can recognize this as an IPA. Caramelly hints of malt in the middle of the nose. Taste is of lots of American hop, citrusy juiciness, and another light, caramelly maltiness at the back of the palate. Lemon juice, orange rinds; just a touch of spice, nutmeg? clove? consistent with the season. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Juicy, wet, moreish, with that citric character really cleansing the palate with lemony wetness, not as dry as the majority of IPAs. No alcohol taste to speak of; deeply quenching and moreish. Very drinkable... the first time I encountered this beer was on draft and I wasn't familiar with the alcohol content, so a friend and myself ordered it by the pitcher and treated it like a session beer, which, in retrospect, wasn't the most accurate approach. That won't keep me from enjoying a few more six-packs (at a more appropriate pace) this season. Its chart position is understandable... Recommended.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Nov 18, 2003"

Taste: Well, I this beer and I met early in my beer journey a few years back when I was first getting into beers I ran into this on tap in Fuel and Fuddle in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. To this point my brother Dante' and friend Kolby had tried many different beers together, however after ordering the SNCA my bro and friend were totally turned off making statements like ""this tastes like pine sol"" and ""that's overkill on the hops"" well I am proud to say I didn't have that reaction. I absolutely love this beer from the first time I tasted it. Cascades slide upon the palate with an oily resin given them their lubricant capable of being so silky and smooth, while the hops do steal the show I still find this one balanced enough with caramel sweet sticky maltiness so good.

You don't need to be celebrating something to drink this beer, you should just be celebrating it's existence. I sure celebrated finding this beer (3 actually, shared with Marty and EmoBeerGuy) discarded in a dorm hallway next to a trash-can. I don't know who discarded it, but we were more than happy to give them a home. I finally drank mine, probably the last one I'll find until next year, today on a cool late summer day. It was just as good as I remembered all the others this year being. The wonderful deep amber and thick head with lace that does not quit is only a modest hint of greater things to come. The wonderful hop aroma is likely the most pleasant I've experienced. If you like very hoppy beers that are nearly perfectly balanced with malt and some fruit, you will love this beer.

The color is a cloudy brownish red. The smell of spices and hops are very overwhelming, but exceptional! The taste is all spice and hops. There is maybe a little bit of clove or nutmeg in this one, and it has a good bitter finish from the cascade hops. The drinkability is very good for this style.

This brew can '""take a lickin and keep on tickin"" (and no referances to my college girlfriend again). As the beer warms the mouth smoothes more and more.. Smooth medium to fuller mouth comforts the tongue. This beer is the perfect way to celebrate if you love hoppy brews. At 6.8% very drinkable.

4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Fairly big, fluffy, white head. Farmer's market aroma -- fresh flowers and citrus fruits -- that includes the very floral and evergreen hop aromas. Nicely medium-bodied. The hops are definitely the predominant flavor generator in this brew; they creep over the tongue from start to finish. Very subtle -- a wee bit of an unbalanced flavor here -- malt sweetness upfront and through the middle, but this finishes with a clean, big hop presence. I had two, but I don't think I could have any more; it just lies a bit to far over the hoppy line to drink a lot, but the high alcohol content is very deceiving. I really love Sierra Nevada, and this is another great offering from them.","marburg","Apr 26, 2003"

Nose is straight hops, to warn you of whats about to hit your palate. The flavor is a hop lovers dream. Straight hops all the way, classic over the top American IPA. What I think is so amazing about this beer is the ABV which is totally inconito. I would have never know. This is a beer that, if drank in large quantities, would surely sneak up on you. While IPA isn't may favorite style (I find it a bit too one dimentional) this beer takes that dimention and does it perfectly. Want an IPA. Drink this!","EmoBeerGuy","Mar 29, 2003"

Hints of citrus peel were detected amongst the intense scent of hops. This is one great full-bodied beer that packs a full arsenal of hops.

Celebration (and a host of mass-swill). Stared at the nice label graphics then poured into my waiting glass. Fine all-around look to this one -- deep hazy-brown and few, tiny foam bubbles of white, running for the sides. Bold, hoppy aroma. This beer held captive the Cascade hops that I love, only releasing the chain-gang busters once inside. And the flavors of this seasonal carried over nicely with each sip. De-lish hops, de-lish beer.","Hobbz","Feb 22, 2003"

You should always have a few of these on hand.","scottum","Feb 18, 2003"
4.82,16.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This brew poured a copper color with sort of an amber color when held to the light. The head was off-white and about a quarter of an inch thick. The aroma was complex with hints of citrus, hops, and alcohol. The taste was basically the same as the nose with citrus up front and the spice of the alcohol in the middle. The finish is bittery with a nice bite, the citrus also comes back a little in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was nice with good carbonation and it went down smooth. This is my favorite winter seasonal and in my top three overall, what a great beer.","Bruiser81","Feb 17, 2003"

It could do with a touch more body to equalize the bitterness but that's just nitpicking.This beer has a slight chewiness to the body that dances with the hops,maybe it is the yeasty fruitiness here with a tiny bit of caramel malt.

Slightly bitter, this is not the type of beer that you chug nor do have several at a sitting. Also it help to pair with the right food - spicy work well.

A strong citric aroma of hops and medicinal alcohol lets you know your in for something special. The taste is spicy and balanced at first then the hoppy bitter flavor asserts itself and lingers.

The look is really good, with a nice deep, golden hue with a creamy, white head. The smell had nice fruity flavors and I was excited to drink it. the first taste was a bit of a let down. It came on much too bitter and the fruit flavors were way too citrusy for me. It did have a nice hop finish, and I must admit the further down the glass I got the better it tasted.

I like hops, but this was a bit overpowering. Although, it went pretty well with some spiciness food. Very warming - no wonder this is for the winter. Mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth.

Pours a nice golden/ruby color with a small head that dies quick. Scent is all malt and hops. If you like hops, you'll love this brew. Right away the hops explode in your mouth, nice & raw, with the sweet malt there to balance it out. Spicy citrousy notes. One thing that makes this one of my favorite christmas brews is the fact it's not too spicy like some other american breweries that seem to go over the top with strange,unidentifiable spices. This brew is great malty taste + tons of hops. Hops linger in the mouth for awhile after a swig. I could drink this all night (and have on occasion).

The aroma was interesting with the dominant aroma from barley and malt, but with some odor of hops and apples. The taste was dominated by hops - sharp and almost acrid with some fruitiness and spicy oakiness. There was a lingering aftertaste of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with a strong hop bitterness throughout but with a mild sweetness in the finish. The carbonation was moderate.

4.45,7.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"But it doesn't stop there; a juicy underlying fruitiness from the yeast adds to its vibrancy. The body is light enough to be highly drinkable, but also full enough to combine with the very fine natural carbonation giving it an exceptionally smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor, like the aroma, is dripping with fresh floral and citrusy hop character - but it's not so bold that it's over-powering or minty. Instead, it's delicately balanced against a softly sweet, nutty and bready caramel-soaked maltiness that emphasises the hops. It showcases the soft, and almost sweet character of the Cascade hops! Balance is what this beer is all about, and it's bitterness is no exception. It's not intense (which would ruin the palate and overshadow it's supple maltiness, but it is quite solid and becomes drying in the finish. It pushes and pulls throughout the pint but never becomes the centerpiece. Finesse, not bravado, wins the prize here!!!","NeroFiddled","Jan 08, 2003"

4.53,9.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002: I've grown a strong liking for hoppy ales lately, and I was very, very satisfied upon drinking the Celebration Ale. From the bottle, it poured a nice, dark orange / brown color. A beautiful full head stood atop the glass, and was very well-retained throughout. Complex and tight lacing was also present, and I'd have to describe its overall appearance as creamy and full on top, sharp and mellow below. A luxurious hop aroma was present, and a nice spiciness added to the wonderful smell. A very pronounced hop bitterness was noticed in the taste, along with a subtle and pleasant maltiness. The higher alcohol presence was noted but not intrusive...most welcome, in fact, on this cold December night. A full, creamy mouthfeel was cut sharply by the prickly carbonation and felt great in the mouth. Overall, the Celebration Ale has been one of the best brews I've tasted since I began seriously reviewing beer. It's a great seasonal brew, and will very likely accompany my holiday celebrations for years to come.","SchmichaelJ","Jan 03, 2003"

If one concentrates, you can also detect a little alcohol escaping from those tiny bubbles. Head forms a nice brussels lace and stay with the beer until you're done. Bittering hops are well balanced to the sweetness and body of the malt, and finishes with strong hops bitterness and sugar cookies. Excellent mouthfeel...nice and chewy. Comparing the bottled version to draught of the same year, I would say that the draught had a thinner head, a somewhat milder hop profile (i.e.-a little more rounded and smooth), and had less bitter hop finish, which in my opinion made the draught more enjoyable. A great beer, and one I look forward to each year. If you like this, try Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. Get both on tap if you can!","Mitchster","Dec 28, 2002"

Rich, wonderfully hoppy and bitter flavor - but not overwhelming, by any means. The citrus flavor dominates most of the way, but the herbal, piney taste takes over in the finish.

For an ale of 6.8% ABV, I find this to be an easy drinker for sure. I, too, am all for this as a year-round offering from SN. There's always something to celebrate, right?","Jon","Nov 29, 2002"

4.48,8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The label's quaint scene of a snow-covered cabin works well in announcing the themes of winter and Celebration, reflecting feelings of warmth, safety and comfort. The beer pours amber, with a creamy white head. A sharp nose, with strong elements of citrus, suggests an impending hops explosion. Hops, hops and more hops. Even at the finish a bitter hops flavor lingers, as elements of grapefruit and pine recede, but in a way that is inviting, rather than overwhelming. With a full mouthfeel and nice carbonation, this is a big beer, appropriate for a big and festive holiday season.","jward","Nov 27, 2002"

Well, I'm not reporting anything different from other reviewers when I describe the taste as hoppy. I would agree that it is more a taste of hops without a ton of bitterness. Not as bitter as other IPA's I've had. I did get a very subtle orange taste on a few sips. I got this one in the store from the refrigerator plus the 2002 on the label so at least it wasn't sitting out for a while. A pretty good brew but I guess I'm a little puzzled by all the fuss. Maybe it is narrow mindedness on my part but it also doesn't match what I was expecting out a winter offering. I don't penalize the beer for that.","mjohn27603","Nov 25, 2002"

Beautiful copper beer with a big white sticky head and great acing and ringing down the glass. Nice piney and citrusy/floral hop aromas dominate. Quick hop bite right at the start of the brew before it turns into some nice mellow malt through the middle before the fruity hoppy flavors take over and the beer eventually finishes with a nice lingering hop bitterness. Smooth and tangy with a decently heavy body that is appropriate for the season. I'm tempted to run out and buy more of this right now.

I'm sad to say, IMVHO, that it did not. Don't get me wrong, it was quite a good beer. I am definately seeking this one out in the future. I'm just not going to set up a shrine in its honor. My biggest problem was with the mouthfeel. In terms of style, the mouthfeel was flawless. However, since it is packaged as a winter brew I feel it falls short of the mark. Two things could be done to correct this. The first is give it a finer carbonation. The second is increase the final gravity. IMO, the carbonation is too coarse, or the body a bit too thin, for a ""winter warmer"".","yen157","Nov 09, 2002"

This baby is hopped like a maniac, the agreeable malt has slight nutmeg qualities but seems overrun early and often by the hops all the way to the aftertaste. Just too unbalanced for my expectations of a winter brew (unless X-mas in California means IPA), lots of similarities to some other up and coming juicy American IPAs. But, a cool addition to your arsenal of winter brews, I can certainly be in the mood for this as there are definite times I crave hops.

4.62,11.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Copper hue w/ good clarity. Persistant ivory white head leaves Belgian lace. An assertive, pungent combination of a citrusy cascade and piney hops hit the nose immediately, then are ceded by medium caramel and hints of rich, pleasant butterscotch. Although the hop bitterness is quite assertive, the rich malt character isn't overshadowed, and toasty malt and well integrated, deep caramel provide a firm malt backbone to support the hops. Hop flavor mirrors the hop nose, and is both citrusy and piney, but when coupled with malt sweetness, could be perceived as sweetly spruce like. Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous, full mouthfeel. Fruity esters, although subdued, emerge late and provide additional complexity. Finishes w/ a delectable lingering combination of crisp hop bitterness and mild caramel sweetness. Tongue coating bready grain is perceptible upon exhaling. This years Celebration (2002) retains the hop profile of previous years, but the malt profile seems to possess greater depth and richness. Simply put, it's one of the greatest American IPAs around. Who needs spices in a winter brew, when spicy aromatics can be acheived with hops? It's a beautiful beer, especially when consumed at cellar temps or above.","marc77","Nov 06, 2002"

Huge frothy head over an amber-brown brew.  Head retains very well and leaves lace as the glass empties.  Powerful hop aroma, mostly citrus, a bit spicy.  Hints of sweet caramel malt.  Wonderful!  On the palate, bitter and spicy hops take the lead with malt struggling behind in the beginning, but showing itself more as more is consumed.  Deeper in, more complex hop character comes through showing the variety used in hopping this beer.  Citrus, oil, and fruit are all present.  Malt backs all of this up very well with grain and caramel sweetness.  Spicy and grain dry finish.  This isn't what I would normally expect from a winter brew, but surprisingly, it fits with the season very well.  The spicy hop character gives it that winter holiday feel.  This is what I want to drink with Thanksgiving dinner.  Insanely drinkable for a winter brew as well.

Notes of citrus abound, with a definite undercurrent of yeasty/bready flavors.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and almost fizzy on the tongue.  Despite its 6.8% abv and a definite warming quality, it doesn't want to go down like a sipping beer.  I'm going to have a hard time keeping away from the remainder of the six-pack.

It has a deep copperish-brown color with a lot of cloudiness. I love the hops that SN uses because it brings out such great aromas. This one even seemed to have some fruity aromas.

I decided to stash a bottle last winter and thought about comparing the 2001 with the 2002 version. Sadly to say it won't happen this year since I'm drinking the 2001 version tonight. It's amazing how well this beer is made. The amber color invites you to consume it's tasty contents, and once you drink it, you are hooked. It's a full flavored beer that does more than its share to keep you warm, even on the coldest of all nights. Also, at 6.8% ABV, it's not something to be played with. Take your time to enjoy the wonderful, malty taste. You'll even notice how much more the flavors stand out when the beer grows to room temperature.
