Appearance is orange-amber with one-finger ivory head that lasts a while before settling to a ring and islands. Lacing in dots and rings all the way down. Aroma is grapefruit and orange citrus, pine, and resin hoppiness plus some alcohol and a minisucle touch of bread. Taste is citrus rind bitter up front, a touch of sweet tropical fruit juice and bread comes through briefly, then the bitterness returns on the swallow but fades abruptly. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, soft carbonation adds to that texture, abrupt bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 24, 2015"

In the Bottle, I sometimes am tempted to put it at the same level as O'dells, because it has such a Brilliant Citrus/pine balance but it's still just SLIGHTLY too sweet for my normal preference unless I'm in the mood for a sweeter IPA. On tap, it very frequently suffers from being even sweeter and thus too sweet for a hopheads preference who will often go with Stone or O'dell because of it. The other downside is that its priced at least 1 or 2 dollars more than the average IPA. It deserves it, but still...","Jrhockney","Feb 23, 2015"

It's an extremely average IPA with no memorable qualities.  I bought a six pack and it took 2 months to finish them off.  Even the Sierra Nevadas and Steinlagers went before the last Firestones.  Anyways, i digress.... this beer is not necessarily bad, but then again, its not great.  Think of the most average IPA you have ever had across the board and here ya go!","ronniebruner","Oct 21, 2014"

Taste hops, citrus (orange peel) and malt but no bitterness like most IPAs.  Really drinkable.  Head lingers.  Hints of fruit. Maybe apricots?  Very subtle. Solid clean IPA.

Beautiful floral and citrus notes on the aroma with just a touch of dank. Taste is of citrus, particularly orange, and malty sweetness, followed by a hint of dank. Mouth is perfect for the style.

The orange comes through more strongly as it warms up a bit. Right upfront is a distinct citrus and orange rind flavor, flowed by pine. The palate ends abruptly with a resinous bitterness and a hint of astringency. Not much in the way of malt, unfortunately. Mouth feel is a on the lighter-side--a bit watery.

The taste is a little better, but still, the hops just don't come through the way you'd expect in a well thought of west coast ipa. There's a bit of citrus and bit of skunkiness, but I can really taste the malt and yeast and there's a touch of booze to it, which I don't like. It has nice body. Overall, it's a perfectly fine beer. I enjoyed it, but was a bit dissapointed. The hops were just lacking in my opinion. With no freshness date on the bottle, it's possible I got an old one and I'll re-evaluate if I have it again and am more favorably impressed.","dougfur","May 25, 2014"

4.3,1.4,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Fluffy white head, crests about one finger, good amount of larger bubbles, probably hampers retention, the lacing in turn is more frothy than sticky and sticks in gobs more than sustained streaks. The liquid is more of a bright sunset orange than gold, very good depth as well as brilliance, only a few bubbles visible. The nose is pure and focused, leans on a clean floral dimension, grapefruit and lemon pith, white pepper, there’s solid cocoa and chocolate grounding the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, star fruit scents, refrains from indulging in sweetness, more about punching through. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied, has a firm feel and the carbonation has a steady prickle more than creaminess. Sweeter here as caramel joins the chocolaty maltiness, at the same time slightly more juiciness in the white to pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus. The fruit has a tropical profile, just not the slutty juiciness often associated with pineapple, papaya, guava to nectarine fruit. The pine notes as much cone as outright sap, restrained. All this said, it does crackle with a quiet energy, can play up bitterness while not seeming herbaceous or puckering. Styled for thoughtful enjoyment and grows on you with each sip.","farrago","Apr 01, 2014"

I've had it many times, but this might be the freshest I've had it (6 weeks) and felt compelled to write it up into a review. Also, I'm cleaning out my beer notebook... but I digress. If you're looking for an outstanding, classic example of the West Coast style of IPA, but like a little bread in your lupulin shake, you could do a LOT worse than Union Jack. It's one I will continue to buy and drink for as long as FW continues to make it so good.","LambicPentameter","Mar 31, 2014"

Also this beer was extremely fresh tasting had a bottle date of 1/6/14 and here we are 2/7/14 nice job Firestone.","berkshire413","Feb 07, 2014"

The taste has a strong fresh hop flavor with a good bitterness lingering on the palate that is all carefully balanced with a slightly sweet maltiness. All in all it makes for a very tasty well balanced IPA that hits all the right IPA notes without overwhelming your senses. Superb!","brurevu","Dec 04, 2013"

There are a few times I've bought a 6pack where you could instantly taste it has been sitting around a bit too long as most of the hop profile vanishes and you get mainly malts. A shame to taste it this way knowing how good it is when it's fresh.","MattyBones","Nov 12, 2013"
4.33,2.1,,,,,,"had this many times before but never reviewed until now.  Still a solid IPA and a good little brother to their DIPA double jack.  Nice balance throughout but a bit heavier than I like my single IPAs but the carbonation helps it gain some crisp finish in that sense.","hopflyer","Nov 11, 2013"

The beer is a little fuller bodied but not chewey, goes down easy with citric hops galore, touches of sweetness from both possible caramel malt and some possible tropical/sweet fruit notes. Finishes crisp and sharp without ruining my palette and overall a really good IPA.","clayrock81","Oct 29, 2013"

Nice aroma of pineapple and other tropical fruit, citrus, piney and citrus hops, sweet malt; smells great. Flavor is caramel malt, great mixed citrus and tropical fruit, grapefruit, pine and citrus hops. Finishes with a more of the superbly integrated fruit flavors and a lingering citrus hop bitterness. Mdium bodied with light creaminess. This is an extremely well integrated IPA. It is not a hop bomb, but plenty of nice hop presence. The malt body is very tasty. Nicely integrated. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try this.","LiquidAmber","Oct 16, 2013"

Nose is heavy, heavy fruit, peachy mango with light citrus. Grapefruit, melon and a little berry flavor, with hop bitters at the back end. Medium mouthfeel and creamy texture. Overall, a great IPA. One of the things I really like about it and I think sets it apart from other IPAs is the heavy fruit aromas and flavors, which gives it a sweeter profile, and then the hop bitters really kick in at the end. I'd say it's exceptional.","BeerWizard","Oct 08, 2013"

A very sweet resiny aroma that tickles the nose. Citrus, pine and malt also very present in the aroma. Same characteristics carry over into the taste: lots of malt sweetness (pale malt and some crystal malt) this is all balanced quite aggressively by lots of hop bitterness. Great mouthfeel very smooth beer. Delicious. A damn fine California IPA. Go get some.","CA_brewster","Sep 15, 2013"

I had no idea that Firestone Walker distributed that far and was pleasantly surprised to find a decently fresh sixer in the fridge. Quite a happy accident in my opinion. Union Jack has some fruity and piney elements but ends up being a sort of sweet herbal tea IPA. Despite the odd sounding flavor, it delivers a good drinking beer that has a lot of interesting hop character to enjoy. Would I drink it again? Yes.","JamesMN","Jun 30, 2013"

I love the grapefruit-like flavor of the hops is balanced slightly by a nice toast note in the malt there is a subtle floral accent which adds complexity with very mild aclohol and hint of pine in the finish. Overall I really love this beer it is a great example of the style -an IPA with lots of hop flavor not simply a bitter beer.","Slatetank","May 16, 2013"

The name of the beer led me to believe it was more of an English style IPA, but I was pleasantly surprised by all of those American hops! This is truly excellent.","Mosstrooper","Apr 24, 2013"

I want very much to support the brewery, as Firestone is quite local to me here in Ojai. But this one is fair to middling, and hardly lives up to the promise of the advance hype that led me to buy it ($8.99 for a six-pack). I notice that many reviewers located outside of California are tripping over themselves to heap praise on this one. Me thinks these people need to come to Cali and see how well this style can be done. ^_^","BeerBeast","Apr 18, 2013"

Aroma is still fantastic. Sweet mango and grapefruit with candy sweetness. Flavor is pine and grapefruit, but the hops are obviously deadened. Still, this is an excellent IPA. Lingering sweet citrus on the palate. Medium slick mouthfeel, with medium to high carbonation. Really want some fresh now, though this is still very nice as is.","BMMillsy","Apr 12, 2013"

I smell fresh cut pineapple, flowers, and pine. I didn't really expect the flavor after smelling the beer. Pretty typical west-coast hop flavor. A dry ipa, which isn't terribly balanced. I like the juiciness of the beer, but I was looking for more sweetness. Hop resin lingers on the tongue. The body is medium and highly carbonated. Leaves a little weight after the finish.

Some tropical fruits and sweet scents. Pineapple with a little caramel. Taste showcases more hops. Some grapefruit, orange, and pine. The malt reinforcement is there but lets the hops show through, simply providing an underlying sweetness. Great mouth feel and despite ABV, it's a very easy beer to drink.

Dry, earthy bitterness up front with a spicy/grassy flavor along with pine needle and alpha acids. This is countered mid-palate by a juicy tropical and citrus hop flavor with notes of blood orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango. The perfect amount of fruit sweetness without taking away from the bitterness. Decent malt backbone balancing things out without interfering with the hops. Subtle caramel sweetness along with toffee, bread, biscuit and graham cracker. A little heavier and a touch more malt than most west coast IPAs but its perfectly balanced without losing the delicious, complex hop flavor. Exemplary for the style.","corby112","Mar 16, 2013"

I have tasted it in the past, but before moving to Colorado I could not get my hands on it unless I was travelling and I usually passed it up in favor of something more exotic. That all changed, however, when my manager and I tasted a lineup of Firestone-Walker beers last year. We needed an IPA on draft and we both, on the spot, decided that the Union Jack was our winner. Since then I have tasted it many times and thoroughly enjoyed it. It takes a lot for me to say this, but it now sits beside Modus Hoperandi (and Blind Pig when I am so fortunate) as my go-to IPA.","StoneTSR","Dec 08, 2012"

It smells a touch sweet with otes of orange and caramel. It's pretty full bodied and quite smooth. The finish is a little loose and dusty. It has plenty of hop flavor but it's not very bitter. There is a sort of caramelized flavor to it, like toffee. The flavors don't fuse completely, but all of the different tastes I get out of this are good ones. A little bitterness lingers after the swallow. This is a pretty solid double IPA. It certainly beats most beers.","yesyouam","Oct 19, 2012"

Yes, this was strong but that's to be expected for a beer of this style. The complexity really shone through here and the carbonation was so perfect that it took a back seat to the flavors and mouthfeel that stood out a bit more. The Union Jack on the bottle was quite fitting as this had a strong foreign feel to it and any hophead of fan of IPA's ought to try this out since a beer like this broadens the definition of what a hoppy beer is capable of being.","JerzDevl2000","Sep 12, 2012"

Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, herbal, floral, pine, bread, caramel, and light earhy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, bread, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, herbal, pine, caramel, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop flavor complexity; with an awesome balance of malt sweetness with bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is an outstanding IPA. Great hop flavor balance and malt/bitterness balance.

The aroma is dominated by light citrus hops, especially lemons and oranges with a bit of bready malts mixed in. There is definitely a tropical fruit in the taste as well, when it warms, with lots of the same oranges and lemons from the nose. There is a malt body but the hops come back and leave a strong bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with soft carbonation and medium bodied. This is a very good IPA, very drinkable and dominated by citrus. A nice West Coast IPA.","beergod1","Jul 02, 2012"

Yes it has some nice hoppy grapefruit and caramel flavors but when I can taste the booze on a single IPA, I'm very dissapointed..If you're looking for an IPA to try and haven't tried Ithaca's Flower Power (my personal fav..a very underrated beer IMO), Stone IPA, or Green Flash's West Coast IPA, try those before you give this one a whirl.","Melikeydahop","Jun 20, 2012"

Matt Brynildsson, the brewmaster of Firestone has been tweaking the hops that they dry hop with during the last 6 months or so, and has now started to dry hop with a little bit of the very tropical smelling hop, Citra. The tropical aromatics only improve this already fabulous IPA. Highly recommended and drink this IPA as with every other IPA, FRESH.","flayedandskinned","May 16, 2012"

4.67,10.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5/5): As a ""hophead", I was very excited to finally have the opportunity to try FW's Union Jack. Now, sometimes fans of very hoppy beers can experience a bit of a letdown, such as when the beer is not as über-hoppy as billed or because the bottle isn't as fresh as the drinker hoped. Neither of these factors came into play. The beer lived up to its reputation in a big way and I now understand why it's such a highly regarded IPA. I cannot stress enough how highly I think of this beer and how much I recommend it to anyone that likes hoppy beers, IPA's in particular. If you're one of those people, just buy the whole sixer–you won't regret it.","hagbergl","Mar 27, 2012"

3.7,-12.7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours a translucent amber with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head. Head qickly dissipates into a creamy bullseye dollop and a thin, tight band around the shoulders. Spots and spatters of lacing coat the walls of the glass. Nose expresses citrus notes, cat urine (simcoe hops) and a trace of tropical fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit more muted. There is also some residual bitterness that lingers between quaffs that is intermingled with the cat urine expressed in the nose. Body is medium-light (but closer to light) with a slightly coarse carbonation as well as some acidity that peaks out towards the back. Overall, a decent IPA with a well-hidden abv, but I don't think it deserves the hype.","Jwale73","Mar 10, 2012"

Or maybe a body similar to Modus Hoperandi, now that I think of it. At any rate, an excellent balance on all fronts. This is the type of malt/hop flavor that I strive for in all my homebrewed IPAs.

Orange zest, grapefruit and lesser notes of mango. Juicy fresh hop aroma for sure. Flavor is really hop busy. All different kinds of hops join the party. Goes from bitter, to sweet, to bitter and what seems like back again. Busy on the tongue. Both subtle sweet orange notes and more bitter/sour grapefruit citrus open the hop profile up. Hints of tropical fruits are less present than in the aroma, but contribute. Pine resin notes close this one out. Nice crisp hopiness without being too sweet, bitter or relient on one or two specific flavors. Really good mix of hops that leave you guessing.","uustal","Feb 09, 2012"

The hops are pungent and fresh, reminds me of the fresh hop beers we see in the Fall. The palate doesn't let down either. Pine needles, orange zest, grapefruit flesh, and all the typical American IPA hop characteristics are big, bold, and dominating. The sticky, oily body makes for a bitter and long lasting finish. The flavor, aroma, and 7.5% ABV approach DIPA levels, but are restrained just enough and with a superior balance that allows it to maintain a shocking level of drinkability, at least for hop heads. I have had few beers with this much flavor intensity that were still this easy to drink.

Union Jack is making that a bit more difficult at the moment. These two beers have their similarities, it is not a surprise I enjoy both so much. The balance, the assertive citrus flavor from the hops and the absurd drinkability make both hard to beat. Luckily, or unfortunately, for me I do not have to choose between the two. When and if Firestone makes their way to The Great Beer State my decisions may be a bit more difficult. Tremendous beer, one to seek out.","kzoobrew","Oct 21, 2011"

This is what a beer, especially an IPA, should look like. The first whiff of Union Jack yields a tantalizingly complex aroma of fresh mango and tangy pineapple. This is accentuated by a light grassy pine somewhere off in the background. The first taste is sublime. Sweet candy malt hits the palate first, before being washed away by perfect bitterness. As the palate acclimates the beer becomes almost juicy, like you are biting into ripe piece of citrus, again I think of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Lots of that heavy-duty lupulin taste hangs out in the middle of the beer, the ones that only the really great IPAs seem to capture. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, and isn’t watery at all, though it is almost slightly creamy. Despite the initial wave of sweetness up front, Union Jack leaves the palate dry and begging for more.","eclaycamp","Oct 12, 2011"

4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A huge smacking of hops is the name of the game here. They are bold and intense in the grapefruit citrus and pine hop department. The touch of sweet from citrus hits the tongue first, followed by a hammer-like hit of bitterness from a combination of pine and grapefruit hops. The hops dance around the palate uninhibited, lingering in the finish and aftertaste. A bread-like malt is there briefly, adding balance and depth to the onslaught of hop flavor. A citrus undertone swirls around the bitterness and malts, creating an ultimately satisfying beer all around. A very small twinge of alcohol permeates the intensity of the other flavors, but it is so minute that it gets forgotten easily. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but gritty, finishing bone-dry. This is a fantastic IPA, one that I would always have in my fridge when I start craving hops, or just a really well done IPA. Great stuff.","chodinheaven","Oct 07, 2011"

4.45,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Big thanks goes out to whitebricke for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Keeping the IPA trend alive at my new place with whitebricke having provided all of them so far... Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow orange with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, orange, citrus hop, and grapefruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, subtle grapefruit, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a really good brew. Very easy to drink and quite refreshing. No sign of the alcohol at all. The flavor on this one was really nice and the subtle dark chocolate note I picked up on added a very nice touch to the otherwise very citrusy flavors going on here. The aroma was very well balanced and nice. A definite must try in my book!","thagr81us","Sep 01, 2011"

4.53,6.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured dark gold with a 1/2 inch white head. The aroma was a blend of piney hops along with some honey and syrup notes. The taste was very refreshing. It was balanced for an IPA, not too hoppy or too dry. Overall it was a very flavorful hop forward beer that was made with care, it's not just an overly aggressive hop bomb. This was the first beer I've had in FW's regular rotation. It's good to see that they can brew a great beer that isn't 10% alcohol and barrel aged. This beer was very well done.","jonvan04","Aug 30, 2011"

4.88,15.1,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This beer pours a perfect golden copper color. It has a nice fluffy 2-finger off-white head on it. The head has good retention and leaves behind some nice lace on the glass. There are some nice bready and caramel malt smells, as well as a big piney hop presence. There are also some notes of tropical fruit and citrus. The taste starts off with a nice caramel malt background. There is a big piney bite to it, Also, I am getting some fruit flavors and some citrus. The hops are definitely the star here. The finish is of lingering hop bitterness. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a nice lingering hop bitterness in the finish. This has amazing drinkability. I didn't want to set my glass down for a minute. Out of all the IPAs I have had so far, this is probably my favorite.

The nose is greeted with loads of citrus, then some bitter hops, and a nice caramel backbone in the rear. Taste begins with the citrus, moves into some muted hops, and finishes with a velvety malt flavor. Mouth is very well balanced. It's not as bitter as expected, but still has some hop bite to it and is rather smooth. Finishes slightly dry. Overall, a great IPA.","eclipse54","Aug 28, 2011"

Moderate lacing. Citrusy aroma was very mouth watering, perhaps this brews best quality. Taste was also citrusy/piney/hoppy with just enough malt to balance. Drinkability was pretty ok. Now I need a steak with the next one...","rdub","Aug 15, 2011"
4.25,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O: The way I scored this beer, the sum is greater than the individual parts. When you're not sure which side of the fence to fall off of, this is a great choice. Plenty of character, without being too eclectic or one-dimensional. Not sure I'd want to drink more than 2-of these back-to-back, but a nice interlude, for sure.

The 7.5% ABV is so well hidden. This is my first Firestone Walker beer and definitely won't be my last. I wish I could find it in a 1/6th keg on the east coast.

4.33,2.1,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is a wonderful example of fresh hop flavoring, very bright with hop characteristics in both flavor and aroma with a boundy of hop flavors without being brutally bitter. This is very easy drinking for more than 7% abv, it is nearly poundable. I fault this brew for being a little watery, but wow is it drinkable. It leaves an oily hop residue clinging inside the mouth that is very enjoyable long after a sip is taken. Fantastic stuff. For being more than a month old, this brew has such a remarkable fresh aspect that outdoes some other hoppy brews that I have had more fresh and don't taste this fresh.

Medium bodied and smooth with a light resinous, but delicate feel. Grapefruit and pine hop aromas are well balanced with sweet caramel maltiness. Citrus grapefruit hop flavor up front that quickly adds a fresh pine hop flavor that continues through to the finish. A sturdy sweet malty backbone throughout. A nice mix of hop and malt chracter.","IronLover","Jul 10, 2011"

I've heard (or rather, read) that some people say they prefer this to double jack.

Smells of grapefruit juice, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit. Taste is of grapefruit juice and citrus zests with some tropical fruit flavors and a sweet malt taste coming in at the end. Mild hop bitterness on the palate quickly fades after each sip. Good carbonation makes for a crisp yet slightly sticky mouthfeel.

3.34,-21.2,3,4,3,3,3.5,"O: Overall , this is not a bad beer per say, but it is underwhelming and with so many awesome IPA's out there this will not be a go to for me. The batch is fresh, brewed in June, so freshness is not the issue here. I feel the beer needs a bit more grit and balls, it is too smoothed over without enough drama to the flavor. It's odd because Double Jack is one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting, so robust in hop aroma and flavor, and this just doesn't seem to come close on any level. Once again, not a horrible beer, but not even close to as good in flavor and taste as the Mission Street IPA they make for Trader Joe's! I think the APV is way too high for the flavor component here, the flavor is subtle, but with 7.5% you need a big flavor to distract the palette from the booze. When I drink this, I keep thinking of white grape juice and flat champagne...","Avantyawn","Jun 28, 2011"

4.42,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a orangish copper color with a nice 1 and a half frothy white head which gives way to nice lace. The aroma has a nice caramel malt backbone bigger than most ipa's. There is then a hop aroma of piney hops and citrus hops. The nose is very well balanced almost a 50/50 split. The taste follows the nose, there is a piney hop bite to start with a nice citrus flavor over it, but in the middle you get hit with a great balance of malts. A nice sweet characteristic, a bready and caramel malt taste. Much sweeter and maltier than most ipa's, a little bit like a 120. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

3.97,-6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a small one finger head, most of the bubbles are big, so I doubt it will hang around long. The body is a cloudy dark orange-amber color, very little transparency in this beer at all. The head is now gone. The body looks good, but again with a Firestone beer, the head is not very impressive. Overall the body looks like a good IPA, the head, not so much. Huge hop smell up front on the nose, if I didn't know better I would think this is a double IPA, I guess it is close because it's 7.5%, but still. Very citrucy, very clean, nice malt note in there too. The smell is very good, it smells like a real hop hound! Damn, that's a legit IPA. On the first sip you just get punched in the mouth with flavor, very hoppy, significantly malty too though, pretty well balanced in fact, for an IPA. The alcohol is covered up pretty well, but you can still tell it's there. Overall the taste is pretty one dimensional, but it's a very big taste and isn't skimping out on anything! Drinkability is actually very high for it being 7.5%, and the mouthfeel is very good too, pretty thick, not too much carbonation. Now that I drink the beer more and more the alcohol an malt sweetness is coming out more, which is common among IPA's, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Overall a very legit IPA, for sure more flavor than their pale ale, and a good IPA to look to if you need to know how a good IPA is done.","MaltsOfGlory","May 05, 2011"

The 7.5% puts it squarely in the IPA camp, but the flavor profile and body outdo some of the bigger DIPAs out there. Full of flavor with a big enough body to support the show.

Bitterness was strong but not overpowering due to the malty caramel and bready character. Lots of citrusy hop flavour throughout, juicy grapefruit, with pine resin lingering. Slight alcohol flavour and warmth, plus a little spiciness, towards the end. Medium bodied with ample, creamy carbonation, sort of chewy, some dryness.

Normally I'd be disappointed but the lack of foam actually accentuates the pretty color, and there's great lacing. Tastes of citrus and grapefruit and the bitterness characteristic of the style, but balanced nicely by a nice infusion of beta acids. Medium body with average carbonation which works because any more would detract from the great flavor combination. I found it highly drinkable because of its balance compared to other interpretations of the style. Hopheads might object to the relative lack of aggressive hopping, but I for one loved the change in a world of increasingly powerful IPAs.","jboib82","Mar 04, 2011"

This beer is a very bright amber color with a nice little coating of white foam. The aroma is strongly fruity with grapefruit and bready notes. The beer tastes solidly bitter with resin and candied citrus peel flavors from the hops. The bitterness is moderately acute, but is clean without a lingering aftertaste. There is good malt sweetness in the finish that balances the bitterness, but not so much as to be cloying and there is papaya in the finish. The IPA is full bodied and smooth.

A nice inch and a half of head forms and leaves impressive lacing as it dissipates. Nice, bright, golden yellow-orange color. The nose has tangy pineapple and citrus hop qualities and a healthy dose of malty sweetness to it. A bit sweeter than I prefer but still well balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied and medium-heavy. This is definitely a big beer. Pine and pineapple flavors tickle the tongue before a tidal wave of bitter hops rushes across the palate. Surprisingly lively hops for a relatively old bottle. Not very much carbonation but the hops are still crisp enough to overpower the majority of the malt with their resiny bitterness.

This fresh IPA pours an almost clear amber/golden color with a big white head that diminishes quickly. Smell is very hoppy with some sweet citrus scents. A bit of a floral smell as well. Lots of orange. The taste is delicious! I could have told you this was bottled less than a week ago, even if I hadn't looked at the date (due to the fact that it tastes like the time I had it on tap at the brewery). Never has it ever come from the bottle better than it has tonight. The mouthfeel is just perfect for an IPA...sometimes you get an IPA that has too light of a mouthfeel, but this one is awesome. The drinkability is extremely high. Drank 4 of these last night along with some BMC (don't judge me, I was playing beer pong). I was sure to save one of these fresh ones to write a review on.

4.11,-3.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall:  Since I've been on a bit of a hop kick lately this beer hits the mark square in the face. Huge hop bitterness and gorilla hop flavor. While the malt is only supportive enough to hold the IBU's on your palate, for the hop seeker this will satisfy. For others, it will be unbalanced. Carbonation adds a tingling effect that only slightly lifts the hop oils off your tongue. The barley presence comes off as an afterthought to the Humulus Lupulus.","DanOLeary","May 19, 2010"
4.35,2.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Union Jack IPA pours a bright golden orange with a very fluffy 2 finger head with great retention down the glass. Nose is west coast hop greatness. Lots of citrus and pines with the fantastic hop finish. Not much going on with aromas. Mouthfeel is much more malty than the nose. A great hop finish rounds out the sweet citrus and earthy notes up front. This is a much thicker IPA than most. Mouthfeel is chewy and full bodied. Drinkability is solid. This is one of my favorite IPA's especially with the drinkable ABV. Thanks again Flexabull, would love to get more of this in the future.","abrand","May 19, 2010"
4.07,-4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Aggressive pour yielded a light amber with a smallish one-finger white head. Head dissapates quickly but leaves behind a nice creamy lacing. Good carbonation is evident by sight and taste. Nose is a strong citrus (orange, grapefruit) and earthy pine with a sweet malt evident. Taste starts with some bitterness that is almost like orange zest quickly countered by a malty sweetness and a nice, refreshing orange aftertaste. This is well balanced and delicious. It features a medium consistency and only slightly oily mouthfeel. At 7.5% and this well balanced, sessionable it is. As with lots of left coast offereings, I just wish I had enough access to do so. If you are lucky enough, go for it!","regspeir","May 19, 2010"

4.2,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice frothy off-white head that settled into a puffy cap. The aroma is of juicy hops, grapefruit with hints of tropical fruit. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. Big grapefruit hop profile but not too bitter, hints of pine and tropical fruit along with a bready caramel malt add some sweetness to the beer. Good hop profile, made well. Moderate feel with active carbonation; great balance. It is a bit heavy but the malt probably helps offset any harsh hop bitterness so I am good with it. Quite a tasty AIPA, great hop flavor without any crazy bitterness. It is a bit big with higher ABV but I will just have to live with that.","Gmann","May 14, 2010"

The taste is quite hoppy as well; not as floral as some of the other IPAs or DIPAs out there right now, but extremely approachable for a brew that bills itself as ""aggressive."" Firestone Walker normally does a good job with their brews, and this is no exception. My only gripe is that the one dimesion-ality of many of today's IPAs is beginning to grow old.

Smell suggests that this beer means business. Taste is a pretty tough with hops and definatly gets the taste buds jumping. Mouthful is almost harsh and begs to be swallowed. To me, the hops are way over powering and dominate from start to finish. I know alot of people suggest citrus and other hints but the piney/resiny malt seemed to overpower everything for me. Aftertaste lingers and almost leaves your throat dry. I am not much of a Hophead but if I were, this would be a daily drinker.

The taste displays an underrated characteristic in the IPA universe: balance. Some citrus tang on the tip of the tongue along with a bit of pine blends seemlessly with the vanilla and peach sweetness from the malt. A second round of hop bitterness brings things to a satisfying conclusion. This is not a hop symphony, but it doesn't need to be. This is simply a very well executed IPA where more subtle flavors are allowed to create a coherent drinking experience. If this was available in Illinois it would join the ranks of my go-to IPAs.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 28, 2009"

It has a clear golden amber color with a modest white head of big bubbles that disipates to a mere ring quickly but leaves a healthy carpet of lace. The aroma is mild but pleasant pine hops and a vague hint of clean grain. The flavor brings a much more difinitive hop and it's got more of a citrus side. It's smooth with very fine tingly carbonation, crisp but fair bodied for the style. The hop dominance gives way to some malt sweetness and this settles into a very pleasing ipa. There's also a touch toasted oats and oak. This is one solid choice, definitely give this a try!","Durge","Jun 09, 2009"

The taste is citrus and spice hops, a well balanced caramel malt, pretty basic for the style, well balanced taste. Mouthfeel is an appropriate medium body with solid effervescence. This could be a session beer as far as IPA goes, if you have read any of my other reviews, you know I always drink all over the map.

Sharp mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. No stickiness in the finish. The aroma follows through nicely in the taste. Grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, and that bite of resin.

The thing that suprised me was there wasnt much of a head or retention or lacing. I had a 6 pack, the carbonation seemed fine, but just little head with virtually no retention. Smell is amazing. Touches of grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, and a floral hop bite. Taste is in-line with smell. A somewhat sweet citrusy taste with a plesant hop bitterness as it hits the back of the tounge. I'd have to say this is pretty well balance but, as you'd expect, somewhat favoring the hops. Mouthfeel is light and velvety, leaving a slightly oily finish.

Taste is very hoppy but more malt backing than the smell led me to expect, still very hoppy though. Taste is immediately a caramel malt that quickly gives way to a building bitterness.

The mouthfeel is sticky and almost perfect--just a tad lighter than some other big IPAs that I love (e.g., Ruination). The taste is true to style with plenty of hoppy goodness. There is also a nicely sweet finish, sweeter maybe than any IPA I've had before--not quite what I'd call sugary, but close.

Big ripe nose of grapefruit, grassy notes, touch of alcohol, and a resin hop presence. Taste melds all of the above smells together, leaning towards the hop bitterness, grapefruit flavors, and mild alcohol bite. Body is between medium and heavy, leaning more toward the former. Alcohol is not overly present, just enough to peak its head up. This is a well made IPA. It reminds me of Mojo IPA from Boulder in a big way, maybe a little bit better.

The initial flavor is a kinda bready malt flavor and its immediately followed by the citrusy hop flavor. The carbonation level seems a tad low on this beer and there is a slight dry after taste.

This beer has an excellent feel as a big and excellent IPA. It's thick and resinous. The carbonation is prickly and melds well with the sharply bitter hop notes.

The malts are fairly light with just a hint of dry biscuit barley under the citrus. The appearance is a deep gold-orange with a tall white head a thick lacing. The body is also as light as any pale ale, making this almost too drinkable for the 7.5% strength. Overall this IPA is rich in flavor with strong bitterness, while still maintaining drinkability.

It's really a perfect balance of hops and the malt backbone. The hop bite is right up front with big piney hops and a slight kiss of orange. The sweet malt comes out at the very finish of the beer.

Finish is lightly of spruce pine and floral hops. Medium in body but a little watery in the back end. Good carbonation.

A bit of a hot touch from the alcohol, but it's minimal and doesn't matter much by the time you've processed everything. Feel has a slight bite on the carbonation and the liquid is good.

Pours a dark golden with a thin head and spotty lacing. Smells citrusy, herbal, and a bit earthy. Nicely balanced. The taste is equally balanced between the hops and malt with some nice length to the flavors. Chewy malt with a touch of sweetness and nicely bitter earthy hops. Very good body, and a nice long finish. Delicious, I'm quite impressed with this offering. If it were available in my area it would o into my regular rotation.","Georgiabeer","Jun 19, 2008"
4.57,7.8,4.5,5,4.5,5,4,"Had on tap in the Firestone Taproom in Buellton. The last time I had this was from a 5 day old growler that had lost a lot of it's carbonation but still tasted great. It was a whole different beer with great carbonation at the brewery. Loads of pine, citrus, not as much berry character as the growler probably because the snappy carbonation really emphasizes the aggressive pine and grassy flavors. The smell just leaps out of the glass and what I love about this, like all other west-coast IPA's, is that they do it on a light body. Sure the beer is not without some malt in it but they really know how to let the hops shine without leaving too many residual sugars behind to make it syrupy. Another great west coast IPA!","MiScusi","Jun 16, 2008"

The taste is wonderfully balanced, even though it is a heavily hopped beer, there is the right balance to make it work. The mouthfeel is medium in body and slighty viscous and very drinkable.

A dry hay scent is also present with some fresh cut grass. Overall the aroma is a bit weak. Flavor is a zesty grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of evergreen. Slick feel quickly followed by a puckering dryness. Caramel malt is hidden but there, could definitely use some more to balance this one out.
