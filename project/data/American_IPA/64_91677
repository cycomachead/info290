Allow to warm to near room temperature and this one becomes quite nice.  Pours a beautiful light ruby with light, white head that retains a ring around the glass even while warming and sitting for quite a long time.  Overall a nice, crisp - finishing surprise.","FaradayUncaged","Mar 21, 2015"

It has a weird color of  half amber ale and half pink lemonade.  It smells a little  medicine-y and sour.   Decent mouth feel and body, but the taste is basically an unremarkable IPA with a couple of drops of Robitussin in it.  Sorry, not a winner from Dogfish Head.  Not undrinkable, and if you put forth some effort it is sort of interesting, but it never rises to being very good.","MNJR","Feb 16, 2015"

The grape must pairs pretty nicely with the hops to create a brew that tastes quite a bit like sparkling grape juice, although certainly not as sweet. I certainly wouldn't say that it tastes like wine, although a rose might be a good approximation to the color of the beer. Nose is sweet grape (duh) with citrus notes from the hops. Not my favorite DFH by any means, but still worth a try.","Risenhower","Aug 24, 2014"

The smell is almost entirely grapes, definitely a wine like character. Musty, not wine must. The first thing I taste is grape - definitely like a sparkling red wine when it opens. There is some hops through the middle and malt on the back, the usual progression I get with IPAs. More hoppy as it warms up. Hops are piney and a bit citrusy, it goes well with the grape. It leaves a sort of candy sweetness in the mouth that is excellent. Mouthfeel is medium - oily. The hops and especially the malt remain in the background, this one absorbed the grapes through and through. Good and a fun experience, but it won't become part of my regular rotation.","kthoag","Aug 18, 2014"

3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Aw, that's cute. It's pink! Minimal head. The smell is some piney hops and a definite hit of grapes. Not wine-like, but actually grapey. The taste starts with some sweet grapey malt that it cut fairly quickly by some nicely balanced grassy hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty good idea that translates into a tasty beer.","TheTrevor","Jul 29, 2014"

It all combines together wonderfully giving crisp notes of pine and citrus with a mellow finish of booze soaked raisons. I would buy this again for sure! In my opinion its a perfect autumn IPA. Quite the skillful blend!","AyeMito","Jul 28, 2014"

It leaves a very decent amount of foamy lacing. The aroma is a fruity, sweet and bitter blend of semi dry red wine, citrus hops, caramel malts, bready yeast, and a faint hint of wine alcohol. It is quite a delicious blend and the best thing about this beer. The mouth is light to medium bodied; a little thinner than I would have expected. The flavor follows the nose but slightly subtler. It really tastes like a bottle of sixty minute and semi dry red wine. I don't think that this should work but somehow it does. Nice work Dogfish Head.

The aroma was more on the citrus side. This beer was not very bitter and it was very well balanced. I was a little nervous I would be drinking a beer with a strong grape/wine flavor but it was very subdued. The body was lite and the beer seemed a little drier than your normal 60 min. Maybe this is from the simple sugars from the grapes. The subtle grape flavors really pop the citrus hop flavors in this beer. This is a great beer very easy drinking for an IPA.","i4ourgot","Apr 03, 2014"

While the base beer may be IPA, the finished product has undergone profound transformation. Wine-like qualities invade almost every aspect of it, yet never to the point of excluding the native beer qualities. Despite its freshness on the palate, it has an unfortunate fatiguing effect. The brewer should take what they have learned here and apply it to a stronger, more decadent base recipe. It will truly be ready for sharing, because a little of this wine must treatment goes a long way.","beagle75","Mar 02, 2014"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours some very light off white and creamy head that dissipates very quickly and levaes nothing behind. The beer itself is a very red clear copper. The beer smell has hints of Syrah grapes, citrus hops, and a sweet malt backbone. The malt and the grapes reinforce the sweet smell with the Syrah providing more of a fruit sweet smell while the malts are merely sweet. The hops mix well with the slight alcohol flavor provided by the grapes. The taste is a bit similar to the smell but different in the syrah grapes provide a fruiter taste and complement the citrus hop bitterness. A little bit of alcohol also appears on the tongue. Also, there is a slight bready taste. The beer has a slight thicker feel than a normal IPA but still goes down smooth bordering on velvety. Very little carbonation exists but can still be felt. Overall, a pretty good IPA and interesting combination.","HattedClassic","Jan 12, 2014"

The color was the first thing I noticed while I was pouring it out, it was like a clear pinkish purple rose color. The smell was very grape and wine heavy with hints of hops coming through. The odd combination of the ipa and grape coming together was a real treat and each distinct flavor went together so well. Overall I definitely enjoyed this beer although I can easily see how some people wouldn't. Would I get it again? I'd have to say yes.","Steved9mm","Jan 08, 2014"

My initial reaction was that it's very similar to a champagne. Actually more so than an IPA. It din't taste much like 60 minute at all. If I blind tasted this, I wouldn't guess it had anything to do with it. Even at only 6.5 % it resembled a normal abv champagne because of the bitterness that followed the initial bubbly palate.","DavidBart","Dec 26, 2013"

A good beer again very much like 60 minute but with less bitterness masked slightly by a rich and savory Syrah taste along mid palate that follows it into the finish taking away from the hops a bit. While 60 minute leaves hops on your breath, 61 leaves red wine. I like it, it's definitely different then 60 minute but not in a better way I think, the wine detracts from the hops a bit and even takes over some of the delicate malt favors, it's all still there you just got to look for it. The wine presence isn't even overpowering, but red wines a powerful flavor and makes itself known.","jtierney89","Dec 05, 2013"

3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"The flavor profile is almost the complete opposite of the aroma. The nose was dominated by vinous fruit with subtle hops but the flavor is very hop forward with dry, earthy bitterness that lingers over the malt backbone and vinous fruit flavors into a dry finish. Floral and earthy with grassy, piney hops that provides bitter resinous flavor which is countered by caramel malt, toasted bread and dark fruit. The grape must stands out with jammy sweetness along with hints of currant, raisin and plum. The grape must provides a nice counterpoint to the bitterness but the hops are a bit one dimensional and the malt backbone is stronger than I prefer. Easy to drink and an interesting take on the continuously hopped minute series but it's not a beer that I would seek out again.","corby112","Dec 04, 2013"

There is also a bready malt presence that balances out this unorthodox brew in a well-done way I'd only expect from DFH. The grape must makes certain it is the defining aspect of this beer. Medium body and ample carbonation; a little sticky, and a little dry finishing due to some astringency. I didnt focus on this being an IPA whatsoever while reviewing this, the main reason being the brewery selected this as a year-round affair. Works for me. Aged cheddar with cracker going great with it too (as it would with grape wine). For what this creation is, it certainly lives up to its name. Other reviewers' impressions of this beer seem to express a loss to ""categorize"" it, but for me, I feel DFH succeeded once again in pushing the boundaries.","TBoneJones","Nov 16, 2013"

3.8,4.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/8/2013. Pours lightly hazy copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of mango, red grape must, peach, tangerine, orange zest, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/musty earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and grape must notes with balanced malt; and good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, red grape must, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, light pine, and floral/musty earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness/bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, grape must, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, light pine, and musty earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of hop and grape must flavors; with a good malt balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good flavored IPA style. Good balance and complexity of flavors and very smooth to drink. Flavors were a bit like grape soda at times; but this is a unique and nicely enjoyable offering otherwise.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

If this was a hop forward IPA with the slight taste of grapes I would really enjoy it. Or at the very least if they had cranked the ABV and made this strong you'd get the heat from the alcohol which would give it some bite. Anyways, I won't be picking this up again. But I understand this is for people with different preferences so disregard my opinion if you prefer fruitier and lighter beers.","JAFoley","Oct 16, 2013"

Aroma is big floral and pine hops up front, but this quickly fades into a musty grape red wine smell. Very interesting! Flavor is close to an APA to start with some definite pine. I suspect I missed out on some of the hop profile due to it being 2 months old. After the first sip and up front pine, things are mellowed into a subdued hop flavor that mends surprisingly well with the grape. Syrah does not overpower this but does supplement it in an interesting way. Not sure if this is an IPA or a fruit beer. A bit of tartness to go with the bitter. Light to medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. I actually think this is decently done. But I suspect it won't be a year round brew for long.","BMMillsy","Oct 12, 2013"

The hops were hard to find and only full emerged after I polished this off, leading me to faintly associate this with an IPA. There's nothing out there quite like this and it's worth a go for someone looking for something a bit out of the ordinary. Like the 61 in baseball, it needs an asterisk after the number to further elaborate on the significance of the number. It's an IPA by nature but on a level that warrants a taste to see what the fuss is all about. Worth a go once for anyone who loves Dogfish head or beers of this style with some substance behind them.","JerzDevl2000","Sep 27, 2013"

I enjoyed this beer but it's not something I would get again. It's on par with the regular 60 IPA but the grape must seems to either distract or minimize the hop and taste profile of the beer rather than enhance it. The hops do shine through and there is balance with dry malt adding an edge and touch of sweetness, and the grape must at times adds a slight sour edge to the beer but sometimes it's just flat and unappealing.","clayrock81","Sep 13, 2013"

Flavor is tart up front with the grapes kicking, tartness is nice very drinkable earthy hops slide along the palate as well it's actually a good combo.

But you won't regret trying it. It is Dogfish after all, and a part of the quality ""Minute Series"". This is the weakest of the minute offerings though. Would drink if offered, not buy again.

Instead, this is a new creation, something that could use tweaked but that still manages to be interesting and tasty.

There's plenty of vinous character here, alright - grapes, berries, earth, leather - but it simply doesn't work with either the chalky bitterness of the hops or the high level of carbonation present. Furthermore, the palate is watery, resulting in the beer having a seltzer-like/carbonic acid bitterness. Hop bitterness is low, and the limited flavor is disappointing as well. Medium-light in body, this beer finishes with a blend of sweetness and grapefruit bitterness. Ultimately, an intriguing but failed experiment.","DefenCorps","Aug 25, 2013"

Color was a pinkish-amber and SRM did not apply. Nose was very vinous, quite like grape juice or grape jelly. Mouthfeel was quite effervescent and I have to admit, it was more vinous than beer-like. It had a tart taste, like table wine when I was a kid. That may be why I never caught onto wine the way I did with beer. It just never tasted right. Same way here. It seemed to me like a waste of perfectly good hops. I guess that if I were more of an oenophile, I might enjoy it more, but this was not my cuppa tea.

The liquid looks like cranberry juice diluted with water, bright but lacking in intensity, very active bubbles, rising rapidly to the surface. The nose is sour, cranberry, cherry, red grape fruit, pulped oranges, minerals, cracked pepper, comes across more as wine than beer. Light-bodied, the carbonation tries very hard to create presence and does add crispness. However, it still seems dilute and lacking in heft. Here you do get more leafy qualities and grain to well baked country bread. The quinine to mineral persists. Hard to discern any clear malty flavors, more of a textural contribution. Citrus peel, same array of cherry, raspberry, strawberry type fruits. Some dried pine sap and pressed flowers as an aftertaste. Monochrome and not really all that interesting.

This beer comes through with a punch of grape flavor then leads you to a musky wine like taste then lets you have just a bit the hops before it slips away smoothly. There is a .5 increase in alcohol strength but you would never no it . Very drinkable light and full of flavor . Loved this beer","Rojopunk","Jul 12, 2013"

Pours a coppery brown hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a two-inch, bright white head that slowly collapses into a consistent 1/8th inch cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Thick swaths of lacing coat the glass just above the line of the liquid. Nose expresses grape juice, buttery notes and an herbal/piney character at the back. Taste is a bit strange - a little buttery, a little acidic and some earthiness. Not much of a hops presence. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation and a slightly watery/oily texture. Overall, not my cup of tea. I was hoping for an interesting hybrid like Noble Rot, but this beer falls short. Maybe it is too far past its prime, but it doesn't even really resemble an IPA.","Jwale73","Jul 09, 2013"

Medium bodied, creamy, and a little tart. I'm not real sure what to think about this. It's not awful for most of the glass, but it's sure not an IPA either.

However, it does have some highlights with the fruitiness and tart like characters. It'd been am excellent brew without that odd and ridiculously weird musty flavor that never really seems to leave. Other than that the beer is a 4 across the board. But for a brewery that produce some good ales and some unique offerings this is a miss.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly-glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, grass, pine resin, and a very light twinge of menthol in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with no menthol character, but with a balance that would inspire envy in any brewer. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice IPA, one showcasing the beauty of balance without sacrificing a strong hop character.","TMoney2591","Jun 05, 2013"
3.83,4.9,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"First thing I can say is that 61 minute is a really interesting beer. Initially, the pour made me think of a Belgian Tripel or Quad in appearance: it's got this dark fruit red color, with a bright white head that starts out less than a finger but sticks around for the entirety of the experience. EXCEPT, it's pretty transparent and holds light really well. Nothing too special about the smell, considering this is an IPA. It's definitely ""musty"" but subdued; sour and tart aromas are so present. Taste is really interesting as well. It has that fruity musty character to it, a little sour and sweet. It doesn't really taste like an IPA. Mouthfeel is a little biting at first, but mellows and smooths as it warms up. Super drinkable. Overall this is really unique beer, so glad I have three left to enjoy. Not what I was expecting.","rodlavers","Jun 05, 2013"

The nose is interesting, a pungent interplay between grapes and hops, predominantly a slightly tart, grape seed, vinous sweetness and tropical fruits put off by the continually-hopped base beer. The taste presents the same interesting grape-IPA harmony, subtle yet distinct, but more of the yeast cuts through adding complexity and depth. Sweetness upfront, a solidly medium body, slightly tart, vinous, and semi-dry finish, no booze, very drinkable. I do enjoy the combination, more so using the IPA-base compared to the saison base because of the interesting character the hops add. I'd say it's worth a try for most IPA/hybrid-beer lovers and I'd definitely try this beer again.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 03, 2013"

I just wish I got more hop bitterness and flavor out of this towards the finish, but it just isn't there. I don't know how, but they killed that part of it with the grape must. lighter in body than expected, with enough carbonation and a sweet dry finish, which is an interesting twist to al already out there brew. not my favorite, but like all dogfish head beers, it is well made and worth a try.","StonedTrippin","Jun 02, 2013"

3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of a fruit infused IPA, I don't think there's any other grape must infused IPA's to compare it to, but I thought it was an interesting and unusual take on a traditional American IPA. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these on a warmer summer day, it was more drinkable then I was expecting. What I liked the most about this beer the drinkability, I never thought this beer would be as drinkable as it is. What I like the least is how light the hops are, I think more hops would make this beer more IPA like, maybe they need to make 91 or a 121, I might buy this beer again, I think this would be a nice beer to share with someone who usually doesn't like beer, I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind fruity IPA's. All in all I thought this beer was pretty solid, but I do wish it was little more IPA like and little less sparkling wine like, but for a beer that I didn't have high expectations for, this one turned out pretty nice and I'm glad I took a chance on it. Nice work Dogfish head, This a good example of an odd beer that tastes better than it sounds.","StoutHunter","May 16, 2013"

Smells of both beer and wine...similar to the Noble Rot. Taste starts with the grape flavor of a white or pink wine, then hops take over, then a dry wine-like finish. Incredibly drinkable and refreshing, I wish I had another 4-pack to enjoy. It's not quite beer, not quite wine...certainly not a fruit beer as some have said. This is a delicious hybrid by a brewery that isn't afraid to break the rules.","BurgeoningBrewhead","May 16, 2013"

The hop-forward bouquet starts with floral, vinous tones, but there's a sour, musty backdrop, presumably from the added grapes. The palate follows the nose, which a punchy, hop astringency quickly suffocated by an acidic, sour-grape sweetness. Notes of caramelly malts try to balance things out, but the grape-hop combination is completely disjointed and off-putting. The finish reminds of wine that's been left out for a couple of days.

Aroma of grape juice and sweet light biscuit malt, slightly musty. Flavor starts with biscuit malt and grassy hops, then slightly oaky, dry red wine becomes dominant; finishes dry and tannic. Medium bodied. An interesting experimental hybrid, but the fresh hops that make 60 minute great are muted by the vinous flavors and the finish is too dry and earthy for a ale for my taste. When I drink wine, I prefer dry, oaky reds, but this combination just doesn't work for me. I'd rather have the individual components.

Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some subdued grape and wine aromas. Taste is much the same with hop and slightly funky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with an interesting concept but the interaction between the beer and grape must in this one is a bit odd in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 27, 2013"

Standard sweet english malt dominance in the DFH beers, some bitterness, a bit of blueberry and musty earth. Medium bodied with light carb and a semi dry finish.

3.71,1.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a pale pinkish red, much like a rosé wine, and it pours with a very fizzy, eggshell white head, much like a frizzante wine. The head quickly peels away to leave a light scrim, but that scrim is constantly punctured by a rapid torrent of carbonated bubbles working their way to the top of the glass. In body, the beer is nicely clean and clear, appearing much like a rosé wine. On the nose, the beer smells spicy and bready with sweet, jam-like fruit notes also coming through. Oddly enough, the nose actually reminds me of a softer smelling Soft Parade by Shorts Brewing Company. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet, then lightly acidic, and then nicely bitter at the end. The flavors begin as sweet, and almost sour, generic berry flavor with a touch of earthy spice, which slowly moves into a tongue tingling bitter that mellows over the tongue and gives some nice grassy notes of flavoring. The finish is nearly pure IPA with just light touches of fruity berries, and the aftertaste is just bitter medicinal hops in the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a tongue tingling carbonation that helps to scrub back some of the Syrah’s sweeter notes, and which helps to pave the way for the hops bitter back end of the flavor. The mouth is left surprisingly dry, though there is a slight syrupy feel at the middle of the tongue. Overall, this beer is an interesting step in the ongoing experimentation with beer-wine hybrids. It sweet up front, and bitter in the back, but it doesn’t quite give the Syrah flavors that I was hoping for, and honestly, I was kind of hoping for some tannic bitter on the back of the tongue. I think a tempranillo grape, with its big earthy and spicy notes would be a better match for an IPA, which has me hoping that DFH will maybe do a series of this beer with different grapes. In the end, this is an interesting beer, but not Dogfish Heads best.","Maxwell","Apr 21, 2013"

Literally looks like 60 Minute with a drop of red coloring in it. Aromas of subtle grape sweetness and tang, with a solid biscuit backbone and hints of hops at the end. Flavors of tangy sweet, wine-like characters initially. Almost like a muscato or even wine spritzer, where it has hints of dryness and terroir, but the sweetness is amplified. Solid, balanced backbone of hops bitterness and biscuit, both toasty and bready. Very balanced and dynamic brew. The beer has a dry sweetness in the aftertaste, with a slick, dry finish. Light, smooth bodied in mouth. If you didn't know from the packaging, you wouldn't relate this to the 60 Minute IPA at all. It is a stand alone brew, and deservingly so.

3.99,9.3,4.75,3.75,4,4,4," the flavor is not heavily grape influenced, yet it does have a slightly spicy vinous element with more tangy and bitter contrast and dry herbal notes with a citrus flavor from the hops with light tangelo and mild grape skin recurring the flavor with light orange hop taste. There is a residual bitter pine hop flavor which seems to accentuate the mild red grape aspect. Overall I like it -it doesn't have a lot in common with 60 minute, but I think that is the point a new twist which works well adds a bit of fruitiness the yeast and hops might not give otherwise with mix of grape must adding dry texture and makes for a very drinkable ale.","Slatetank","Apr 10, 2013"

I think the grape works very well with the hoppy base beer, adding a fruity and tart character. My fear was that this beer would be cloying, but I found the grape flavors to be held in check by the hops. It is actually quite drinkable and refreshing. It was more expensive than my go-to beers of similar ABV, despite only coming in a 4-pack.

Ironically the thing that makes the beer a bit of a problem is it's too hoppy (which must beer dorks I am sure would be happy about), that doesn't compliment the other ingredients.

If you're looking for a unique, tasty IPA with some unique ingredients added during the brewing then I'd urge folks to look elsewhere.

The taste of the beer is also grape, kind of screams wine cooler to me. There is a bubblegum flavor in the finish with a faint hop bitterness in the far distance. The mouthfeel was drinkable, light bodied and a bit refreshing. Dry finish and decent carbonation. Overall I am glad I tried it, but I never have to drink it again.

I was expecting a sweeter 60 minute IPA but was greeted with a pinkish reddish beer that smelled way too sweet. The taste was that of a sparkling rose wine. I could barley finish my mug. It is not Noble Rot or Red and White. It is a bitter sparkling red wine at best. Not something I would want year round or as a limited release.","MikeRoni","Feb 01, 2013"
