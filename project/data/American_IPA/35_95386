3.3,-8.1,4,4,3,3,3,"The only reason I rated this beer a little low is because I don't typically enjoy IPA's. I tried this one randomly, my friend didn't like it and poured it out. I proceeded to drink the rest of the 12 pack by myself because beer is beer and beer is good! Now I know that this is just what IPA's taste like so I can't say it was horrible, it was actually one of the better tasting IPA's I've had, but I wouldn't buy it again. I drank the whole 12 pack so that says something.","GregFromRI","Yesterday at 06:16 PM"

4.12,14.8,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"DATE TASTED: April 5, 2015... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: second beer rating of Easter--another IPA... APPEARANCE: fresh, thick and foamy white head sits top a rather translucent body; head settles uniformly, leaving an attractive, even lacing... AROMA: grapefruit, yes--and the Simcoe provides unique flexing of hop muscle; the five hops work in unison to create an alluring swirl of pine and citrus smells... PALATE: a palpable, reasonable IPA with appropriate medium body and resinous aftertaste; thick and lively... TASTE: a smooth, mellow mix of hops mesh well with bready malts that suggest a metallic presence; still maintains the East Coast malt base that makes Sam Adams a bit different in the pale ale space...OVERALL: the floral/citric intensity makes this beer a treat; each sip provides a crunch, a bouquet, a blast of competing hops unlike any previous Sam Adams offering...","dacrza1","Thursday at 06:21 PM"

3.74,4.2,3.5,3.25,4,4,3.75,"The flavor profile is reasonably intense, non-complex and balanced.  It's tasty and begins with a blend of hops (citrus, pine) over a light biscuit.  The middle brings a mild bitterness and a hint of caramel.  The finish is almost dry and leaves a mild rind like bitterness.  A good starter IPA, but hardly what I would classify as West Coast Style.","tillmac62","Monday at 12:05 PM"

Similar to other strong IPA's like Dogfish Head 60 Minute or Victory Hop Devil. I wasn't sure about ordering the large at first, but went after it and it remained sharp, but drinkable throughout. I did not have it with food. The lacing on the glass was very nice. The 2nd one was a more traditional double pilsner glass. So I think the first one held together a bit better.

We've routinely sipped this guy at trivia night when the mood struck, and it easily satiated that ravenous IPA craving.  When fresh it keeps a nice lightness to it, and makes it easy to return to again and again.  Put a little age on it, however, and things drop off rather quickly.  The grain bill starts to seep adjuncts, which can effectively box out some of that resinous, oily hoppiness that you're looking for.  Again, this is a nice, standard, base IPA, but it won't change much for you if you've had more than a few from the style, or from Sam Adams.","TheBrewo","Jan 30, 2015"

If you're an IPA enthusiast who's been around the block more than once, don't expect to get anything remotely close out of this that compares to some of your favorites.

3.67,2.2,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Single 355 ml bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. A deep golden color with two fingers of creamy, frothy head, off-white in color. Aroma is low key yet fresh hops, citrus (grapefruit and orange) with a whiff of tropical fruit layered over a dry biscuit and light caramel base. Maybe some orchard fruit as well, apples and peach. Palate features distinct Cascade notes, grapefruit and perhaps something slightly catty or currant-like, under-ripe papaya, lemon rind, tobacco ... There is the usual Sam Adams toasted nutty malt vibe that is perhaps a deviation from strict interpretations of this style but is not out of place here. Almost a gingerbread spiciness. West coast hopping but Old World malting. Mouthfeel on the light side, not particularly chewy with moderate to high carbonation. Nice oils from the hops. I must say, its a solid IPA from a large craft brewer better known for lagers (yes, craft can be large!) ... Amped down in flavor from a hops perspective compared to many but this does not have to be a derogatory statement. The key elements are all there and the brewery still managed to feature its signature strengths.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 22, 2014"

Citrus flavors from the cascade hops finish off the taste. Bitterness is low for being an IPA thanks to the sweetness of the grapefruit. It somewhat ruins the expectation from this IPA.","Myotus","Nov 11, 2014"

It was so sweet i thought it was a fruit beer which i really do no like.  Fruit should be hard as rock in a cake around Christmas time, but that is a story for another time.  Anyway, this IPA from Sam Adams has a bit of hoppiness that dissipates rapidly.  It feels OK and it looks OK but there is nothing daring about this - in my mind the brewmaster was trying to please everybody.","HopsScotch","Oct 11, 2014"

Tongue dances with malt. Caramel and toasted grains. Then the hops combination swoops in like a tropical wind. Pine, citrus, hop oil. Lots. Still a smooth holy hoppy ale. Tropical fruit and firm bitterness. Crisp, long, oily finish. Clean hop oil linger. Velvety feel. Microfine carbonation. Quenching swallow. While the label proclaims this a west coast IPA think of it as a smooth big, hop oily rest cost style nod Rio the west. Highly drinkable and refreshing.

I like the earthy resin flavor from the hops in this one. I also think it’s plenty bitter. I like those super hop bombs, so I’m happy I found one I like with less IBUs.","kkleu357","Sep 10, 2014"

Although it was a lot of hops, the caramel notes from the malt were able to be picked up as well. The taste was crisp and bitter from the hops with some grapefruit notes in the beginning.

3.61,0.6,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a patch foam; light slippery lacing. Aroma of mild bready malt, citrus and grassy hops, hints of tropical and stone fruit. Flavor is neutral malt with an immediate burst of hop alpha oils, resinous, but without much herbal flavor. Finish is grassy, citrus hop bitterness and a slight buttery flavor. Medium bodied. Not quite my idea of a West Coast IPA, but maybe I'm spoiled. It's almost unfair to compare an East Coast hopped beer of unknown age or storage to the readily available fresh West Coast ales made nearby, but here and well within its drink by date (October). A nice IPA, but does not have lively, herbal hop flavors that would make it great. I feel like Boston Beer sometimes pulls their punches in order to a make pleasant ales that won't offend anyone, and this may be the case here. I hope that fresh from the brewer this is a good representation of a West Coast style IPA, but this bottle does not make that cut. Has the right hop profile and tastes OK, but I won't revisit it.","LiquidAmber","Aug 29, 2014"

3.41,-5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice clear amber color with a three finger white head that receded to a one finger white head leaving little lacing. A nice looking IPA, true to form. Scents of tropical fruit, mostly pineapple, with very faint orange and citrus aromas and malt sweetness. Extremely sweet and fruity for a West Coast style IPA, with none of the pine or even grapefruit that the style usually has in abundance. The aroma notes that do hit the style are nice though. Taste begins with a moderate level of hop bitterness, with notes of bitter citrus pith and a strong, fruity, semi-sweet citrus character, moving into some piney and slightly earthy hop flavors alongside a nice malt backbone. The finish is earthy, floral and slight piney hops. Aftertaste is earthy, floral and faintly pine hops with moderate levels of bitterness. Not the most bitter IPA, but it has a decent character that is fairly on point for a West Coast style IPA, though not the best example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a juicy feel and slight smoothness and a low level of carbonation. Easy to drink and smooth, a good mouthfeel that fits the style and keeps it refreshing. Overall this is a fairly good attempt at a West Coast style IPA from a brewery that usually just does East Coast stlye. However it lacks the full character of examples of the style from the West Coast. Not a bad IPA by any means, but it falls just a bit short.","Auraan","Jun 09, 2014"

Nose was subtle like a sledgehammer to the back of the head! It was a riot of grapefruit and pine and made me wonder who they thought they were zoomin' with that verbiage. All beers should smell like this. It was like an icebreaker cutting through my sinus cavity. Mouthfeel was medium, even kind of soft, with flavors of orange, tangerine, grapefruit and pine. This was a hophead's dream! Finish was dry, sure, but not gaspingly so. I really liked the way that they had shown restraint in getting these flavors without imparting a saturated-like mouthfeel.

It pours a clear sunrise brass topped by a half-finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises flowers, mild grass, very mild pine, and a soft breeze of caramel in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, the flowers and grass a touch brighter, but not very much at all. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Classis grapefruit aroma. Quite satiating and nothing out of place to twist the noggin. Malt sweetness and hoppy enough. Creamier mouthfeel. My brother (who is not into the craft scene) tasted it and replied it was pretty tasty and 'it sure is hoppy but not offensive'. Interested now to see how the bottle fares, but this is a definite go to on tap wherever I may be.","joeseppy","Apr 13, 2014"

They bill it as a ""West Coast IPA"" with 5 varieties of hops. I had modest at best expectations, as maybe this beer would be slightly better than their normal offerings. It's not a bad drinking beer - in fact it's probably just about the best they offer in terms of drinkability. However this is a sham of an IPA. Its an extremely weak version, and reminds me that Sam Adams is so much in the same league as the major brewers than they are with the craft brew industry. Koch is trying to offer this beer to the craft brew segment, and it just falls so much short as expected. Keep spending millions on advertising Jimmy, portraying yourself as this eclectic, against the grain, craft brewery. You guys lay in the same bed as the majors.","sobuf","Apr 13, 2014"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a light golden/orange color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like light citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops, and some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and floral hops noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick, and it's smooth and easy to drink. It's not a bad brew, but for a beer billed as a ""West Coast Style"" IPA I think it's a weaker version of one. Still, I think it's worth a try at least once. $1.99 a can.","bluejacket74","Apr 12, 2014"

Poured semi aggressively into a pint glass and ended up with an inch and half foamy white head which dissipated to nothing within a few minutes. A little lacing as it's being drunk. Straw to gold in appearance, smell of malt mainly without any hops. Taste of bitter citrus as if you licked the rind of an orange and lime, pine in the aftertaste. Sticky mouthfeel after half a glass. Finished at 7 brix which leads me to believe that the wort started at an original gravity of 1.059 and finished at 1.008 which is pretty dry for an IPA. As the beer warms pine is overtaking the the citrus. Alcohol is not apparent until the very end of the glass so it's a sneaky one. I've had better. Sam Adams should just stick to their lager which is awesome only in the northeast region of the US. Once it leaves that area, it's nowhere near as good.","Rogsterman","Apr 09, 2014"

I think piney smells up front with a citrus finish. I think high IBU. This beer is none of these things. What it is, and I'm sorry to say should have been expected from the Boston Beer Company, is a compromise between a traditional IPA and a true West Coast IPA. In other words, The Boston Beer Company, in all likelihood, succeeded in brewing a beer that could, and will, been a compromise beer. True West Coast IPA fans will give this an average rating while those who are not accustomed to the big hoppy taste of true West Coast IPAs will find this a good introduction to the style.

To me (and of course, like any review, it's totally and subjectively my opinion), this is the best IPA style offering that Sam Adams has; at least with regard to regular six-pack, non-seasonal or small batch releases...and I hope it's here to stay. Although I wouldn't trade my Torpedo for it, I won't hesitate to get it if the price isn't the oft' Sam inflated one.","TeamMathis","Mar 20, 2014"

Maybe it will a stepping stone for some into more hop forward beers but for those who already like hops I think this will be a disappointment. Too much malt and not enough hops really but I did enjoy it's drinkability and it has a pretty decent aftertaste. I've had Sam Adams' Hallertau Imperial Pilsner, so I know the can do big hops if they want to in outstanding fashion, so I was expecting a bit more out of this one. If this beer is my only choice at a chain restaurant I would get it again. Or it's on sale for 7 bucks a 6er like Sam Adams sometimes it I would pick it up. But not when I can get 2 Hearted or Centennial for only a dollar more.","PaulyB83","Mar 05, 2014"

S- all pine resin and grapefruit here, very typical of the style. T- just like the nose suggests, it's a mouthful of pine and grapefruit, but extremely balanced. The hop bitterness is gone almost as soon as it got there. A run of the mill IPA flavor. Not quite as in your face as a west coast IPA should be. M- the carbonation is just right, prickles the tongue then subsides quickly. O- overall this is a wonderful session IPA, would I put it above other IPA's?

Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop and moderate malt flavors; with almost balanced malt/bitterness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish.

3.32,-7.5,4.5,3.75,3,3.5,3,"West Coast IPA (or California Hop Bomb if you will) happens to be one of my most favorite style of beer in the world, so I was immediately intrigued when I saw this Samuel Adams beer in the shop today. They certainly nailed the look, as this was clear as they come, golden amber in color, and exhibited a steady stream of bubbles feeding a two finger thick head. The smell was a little disappointing, as I was expecting a pine and grapefruit explosion. Instead I got a subdued citrus and a hint of spruce. The taste was even less authentic than the smell, as there was none of the expected bracing hop bitterness. Instead it tasted like a bland extract of hops, with a sweetness like toffee, and a peppery finish. This was certainly nowhere like a West Coast style beer. The mouthfeel was decent, with a sticky coating on the tongue. This just came into the store today, and has a best by date of June 2014, so why does it taste so bland? If you really want a West Coast style IPA brewed on the East Coast, get a Jai Alai. That is some seriously hoppy stuff.","rajendra82","Feb 21, 2014"

Aromas of resinous and pungent hops forward, with roasted and piney notes blending in as well. Very green nose. Flavors are roast forward, with a blast of pepper spice, pine tassel, pitch, and hints of tropical fruits in the backbone. Very light bodied, giving it a slightly sharp end feel on the tongue. The resinous and slightly buttered toast aftertaste is cleaned up fairly quickly thanks to the rapid transition in the end feel. There are some grassy and oregano notes in the aftertaste, too.

Too light for me, but I can see where people who are just starting out with IPAs would love this. And as I said, it's totally sessionable as far as IPAs go. But I do feel it's a little watery on the finish and the malt is a little sweet. I am not sure what they should add, but I have a feeling something is missing in this brew. It's a fantastic attempt, especially from Sam Adams. But it's just kind of ordinary and basic when all is said and done. Jim Koch did a great job with living out his vision in an IPA, but I think I'm still going to keep Lagunitas as my basic go to IPA.","ToriBug13","Feb 07, 2014"

3.55,-1.1,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of an IPA, it had enough West Coast IPA aspects for me to know that's what they were going for without even reading the label, it's not the best West Coast style IPA I have had, but for a widely distributed IPA from Samuel Adams I think it's pretty solid. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I'm sure I could drink a couple of these but any more than that and it might start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the how solid it was, it didn't really seem to have a weak point. What I liked the least about this beer was that the citrus hops didn't stick out just a little more, It's not that big of a deal but I think that would make this beer just a little better. I might buy this beer again, I don't know if I'll get a six pack anytime soon, but I wouldn't rule out ordering a pint at the bar. I would recommend this as a nice easy drinking IPA, but hardcore West Coast IPA fans might be disappointed. All in I thought this was a pretty solid beer, it didn't blow my mind by any means, but I still enjoyed it for what it is and I'm glad Samuel Adams decided to brew this beer. Nice work guys, thanks for another solid IPA.","StoutHunter","Jan 24, 2014"

I also knew beforehand that this wasn't going to be a true West Coast. I don't know why brewers insist on using this term for their IPA's when they taste nothing like a true West coast. It's really gimmicky and they need to just fucking stop already. Bright orange color, good head. Aroma clearly told me this was no West Coast and to be honest it was quite boring. Maybe there were hops there but they were so subtle. Now the flavor was nice and hoppy but it wasn't piney or dank, mostly citrus and grapefruit but it was good. This was super easy to drink and I was glad I bought a sixer but this will never approach Alpine or Green Flash or Pizza Port or Ballast Point or Stone or Russian River or Lagunitas. Never.","ArrogantB","Jan 24, 2014"

The flavor follows the aroma and kind of reminds me of a Boston Lager with a couple of more hops pellets added. Toasty brown sugary maltiness with bits of earth and citrus. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent beer, but as IPA's go these days this one is a bit pedestrian.","johnnnniee","Dec 30, 2013"

Lots of lacing.The aroma is piney with grapefruit and some dankness. The taste is much like the aroma. Grapefruit upfront followed by some piney hops. Toasted malts as well as some bread. Orange peel and pine at the finish. Light mouthfeel, but I think that's the point. An easy drinker with a good amount of flavor and hop bitterness. It's on the lighter side of an IPA, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. Overall, worth having again.","PicoPapa","Nov 21, 2013"

The scent is fresh hops that include pine and citrus notes. The taste is a nicely balanced beer between hops and malt...pine probably is more prevalent than citrus....there is a Sammy twang to it thou. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation.
