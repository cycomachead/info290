"For the price point and availability this is a more than solid IPA.  Brings a nice balance of bitterness and malt forward flavor."
""
""

"Very good IPA. I have been wanting to try this one and I'm glad I got the chance. Not a citrus flavor. Nice and bitter but well balanced. Very good selection."

"One of the best american IPAs & the price is phenomenal"
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a dark Amber, smells like caramel and malts. The taste isn't too hoppy despite the name, very smooth, a great beer"

""
"The Bro's are a little off on this one... IMO..."
""
""
"O - 3.5 - This is what I call a food pairing beer and a shower beer. This would make a fine transitional brew for beginners, but experienced IPA drinkers may find this a bit weak due to its lack of bitterness and other flavors. A decent little session IPA, but nothing to write home about."

"Opaque deep auburn draft pour with off white head. Hops and a whisper of citrus. Bitter (in a good way) hops up front. Medium lite mouthfeel-nice hoppy tongue coating. A definite go to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only drinkable IPA style beer in my humble opinion. I'm not a big fan of the style personally, so I'm already biased against it, but I find this one lacks the sour milk aftertaste that ruins most IPAs for me. This has a strong, crisp, grapefruity bitterness balanced with a nice malty sweetness. It is like Victory's Prima Pils but with a much more intense hoppy bitterness. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to buy this number again, but I do like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This may be THE classic American IPA (at least for us East Coasters). Big hops in your nose and rolling across your tongue, but a nice malty backbone to support it. It's closing in on 20 years since I drank my first bottle of Hop Devil and crowned it the best India Pale Ale I'd ever had, and it remains one of my favorite IPAs still today."
""
"Strong hop bitter taste.  Takes a bit getting used to but good. Not citrus  flavored but strong hops. Love the amber color. Nice but not a favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"another excellent Victory, golden amber, creamy tan head, nice nose but not as pronounced as I would expect.  More hoppy flavor than aroma and very smooth as far as IPAs go."
""
""
""
"Too hoppy for my taste"
""
""
"A classic.  Always have some at my house for guests.  Had it on nitro at Victory as well, but it took away the great hoppy flavor that is so characteristic of this amazing beer.  Really one of the beers that started it all."
""
""
""
""
""
"Long overdue on this one as I've had several time. Poured into a Belgian Ale glass to reveal a very consistent golden color. Light on the smell but big on the hop taste. Goes down smooth to leave you wanting for more. A great beer when you are drinking more than one...two...etc."
""
""
"One of the best IPA's I've had very well done"
""
""
""
"Super drinkable for a hoppy IPA.  Not overpowering despite being intensely hoppy and quite bitter.  Sufficient malt from which to hang the hops.  I suddenly have a new contender for my favorite American IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent hoppy beer has a side taste that I can't identify."
"Excellent Beer and priced right. My go to IPA. Their Dirt Wolf is amazing as well. Victory is a great brewery. Love a good IPA and this is one of the best."
""
""
"Good. Better than average. Not outstanding."
""
"One of the best IPAs ! Great Beer!"

"Could drink this beer all day as it is very tasty.  In my mind this is a perfect IPA."
"Disappointed. Will not buy again."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable beer. Not over the top like some West Coast IPA's.  Very solid, I can see why this is the go-to IPA for some drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean smooth taste. Nice piney hints."
"Way too sweet why in the world is the beer rated this high?"
""
"Overall: A well-crafted traditional IPA. However, the sweetness approaches excessive for my taste, and the hops while good are nothing to rave about. Although it would have stood out on the shelves 10 or 15 years ago, there are enough interesting alternatives out there now that I don't see myself returning to the Hop Devil."
"Deep but not intense bitter notes on the finish. Almost cocoa, but not a hint of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's probably my favorite IPA."
""
""
""

"Outstanding beer... Full flavor just enough hoppy taste to make it right... World class"
""
"One of my all time favorite victory beers made. Hops are strong and taste amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent IPA. I was expecting the hops to be more distinctive in this beer, but it was more or less an average IPA. I guess the name of the beer had me expecting more, so in that sense I'm a bit disappointed... But not a bad IPA nonetheless"
"This beer makes me very hoppy. The first one I grab at the bottle bar {Fishtown Pa.} after a marathon. One of my faves. I put this ahead of Dirtwolf, nice color and fragrance and flavor. My favorite rating on BA so far."
""
"hoppy, bitter...solid IPA but lacks the citrus/ grapefruit aroma and taste that Iike"
"@ an evening with Bill Covaleski of Victory and Vecenie. Hop Devil is good any time."

"Good average beer for every day."

"Smooth drinkability"

"O: I've had this beer before and don't recall disliking it. But today? I don't think I'd buy it again. Still, my palate has been all over the place lately, and I generally like Victory beers, especially their pilsner, so maybe I'll write this off as a disappointing aberration from the norm."
""
""
"Eh. Ok. Bitter but not much else"
""
""
""
"Fresh IPA smell and taste. Nice residual aftertaste. A solid, consistent product."
"Smells very hoppy. Really bitter. I could barely taste the hops. More malty than hoppy. It's alright. I still have respect for victory"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid.  I don't seek it out, but I never turn it down.  Maybe it was because Michael Jackson admitted he was a Hop Devil addict, maybe it is because its just that good.  I put it right there with SNPA, maybe a little above, maybe closer to Torpedo."
""
""
"O: [2.75] I feel like I got jipped.  I wanted a nice hoppy IPA for the night and I feel like I got lager.  This has none of the characteristics of an IPA.  Overall I just feel like this beer could not be more average.  Nothing stands out.  I might have to seek out a fresh one and re-rate in the future."

"Beautiful yellowish head. Smells are earthy, smoke, and pine.  Love the copper, amber color to this beer. Quintessential IPA here. All corners covered. Great presentation. Taste is a bit dry, with a cask type flavor on the palate. Sticky on  the throat like glue. A beer to be enjoyed. Carbonation is present and slight bitterness on the aftertaste. Potent beer, with a lot of complexity. Variations in the flavor constantly evolving as the beer changes temperature. Senses are aroused from the nuances of this beer. Lacing is excellent and remains. Do not wait. This is one you must try..."

"I'm a relatively new beer taster, but after trying a few other IPA's from Southern Tier, Sierra Nevada, and even Samuel Adams, I find Hop Devil to be rather (surprisingly) bland. It's a 12oz bottle, fresh (over 2 months till it's past its due date). The color is good, but it poured quite syrupy into the glass. The smell is malty, with just a touch of citrus fruits. The taste is, as I said, bland. Almost no taste, bread like perhaps, with a mild grapefruit and pine aftertaste. It's a bit thick on the tongue. Overall I'm somewhat disappointed. I saw the high ratings and expected more. I'll definitely pass on this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are some great IPA's out of the bottle/can.  Try Sun King Osiris, Ninkasi Total Domination, or Sculpin IPA.  This one disappoints.  100 Points?   Ha..... rated higher than Zombie Dust?  Flower Power?  What are they smoking.    This is a damm good beer, but more like a 90-92."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor shows a toasted malt base with moderate sweetness, which enhances the uprising fresh, sharp hop bitterness. Green grass and grapefruit bite into the tongue, while the toasty maltiness with hints of toffee keep things in good balance. Medium bodied and crisp on the palate, the finish is on the dry side, while malt still shines trough. The most convincing part of this IPA is its aftertaste, as it is surprisingly long and superdry, with hops sparking very late on the back of the palate, unleashing an enjoyable taste of fruits and grass just at the moment when you begin to think it may be over already."
""
"Poured into nonic. Dark orange hazy half finger head. Decent carbonation. Decent lacing. Smell is piney, citrus hoppy. Taste is strong pine. Hops. Light toasty malt dry medium mouthfeel. I do not like many IPAs. This one is ok to me."

"Pours a beautiful deep amber with a slight ruby tint. The head is thick when first poured and settles down pretty quickly, leaving a slight sticky lacing. The aroma is pleasant, with earthy hops dominating, a little pine in the middle and a smidge of malt, way in the back.  The taste is about the same. The body has a pleasant thickness to it and little bite from the hops on the finish. This is a very good IPA, well made and all that."

"A decent IPA that's a little too malty for my liking. There's some citrus, and just a hint of fruit, but this really drinks like a hoppy amber ale more than an IPA. I'd put in in the same class as Troegs Nugget Nectar."

"Disclamer  -As a very amatuer beer taster My rating are not that spot on. I hope to provide a basic review that summarizes the core taste of the beer."

"O- A very nice well-balanced IPA with lots of hop aroma and flavor and a higher malt bill than many other IPAs but one that works very well with the hops. 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  We have some outstanding IPAs in this market here in Colorado, but there are very few East Coast-style IPAs that are made this well.  An homage to balance, the hops are enough to satisfy any hophead, but with enough complexity to turn the anti-IPA crowd into fans."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/30/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, biscuit, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hop and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit. tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, biscuit, light toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

The newest and modern IPA are really focusing on citrus flavors but this beer really  reminds me of how my very first IPAs tasted like a pine cone.  Its been over a year and half since I last had this, its a classic and will stand the test of time."

"I am from PA and enjoy Victory. Hope Devil is a nice IPA but not much different than any other one out there. I guess if you want to say that it's a PA IPA then great. Nice appearance but better aroma. Mouthfeel and taste is good but again not much different than anyone else,"

"O: HopDevil was, and currently is still, my go-to local beer. I drink it several times a month and could probably pick it out of a line-up in my sleep. I decided that now's a good time to update my review, as this is the freshest batch I've ever tasted (basically snagged the six pack right off the truck). You would think that my score would diminish, having been exposed to so many more incredible beers since my initial review, but that's not the case here. HopDevil remains consistently remarkable. It's one of the few IPAs I've had that come dangerously close to DIPA territory in terms of flavor. Boisterous hops provide a wonderfully complex display of juiciness, bitterness, and Earthiness, with a lingering spice in the finish. To me, this is a humble, yet world-class IPA that might just be Victory's magnum opus."
""
""
""
""

"Final Word: This is a great IPA! It carries plenty of hop flavor, but offers a unique spicy, peachy, grassy profile instead of your typical grapefruit/bitterness combo found in many IPAs. While the bitterness was a bit too unpleasant after swallowing, it merely kept the beer from being perfect, not from being excellent. The texture and balance made for an extremely drinkable IPA, while still offering enough complexity and nuance to please any drinker. I particularly enjoyed the hint of pear in the finish, as it followed this beer’s trend of surprising you with many atypical flavors. This beer is a must try for any IPA lover, and should only be avoided by those that aren’t used to hoppy beers yet."

"I remember this being one of the very first hop heavy beers I fell in love with.  It had that sting of hops and hop bite that was overpowering and took my tastebuds by storm.  This beer still remains one of my favorite HOPPY beers of all time.  It has stood the test of time."

"Pours a nice deep transparent copper color. When I first stuck my nose in this beer I thought it smelled like stale, dirty dish water. Luckily, it tasted much better. Mix of pine and citrus hops up front that are balanced out quickly by sweet carmel malt. Does not finish too bitter. In all fairness, maybe I had too many hoppy beers before reviewing so I will revisit, but right now I would say good- not great."

"A very hoppy & bitter American IPA with plenty of fruits & hops coming through from the start, almost overpowering you at times but the taste is still a good one. Definitely one worth picking up but there are better out there as well."

"For an IPA this is pretty nice and I like the price of $1.79 per bottle. But as a beer I'd rank this beer low since I'm not a fan of IPAs. I hear of these mythical fruit and hoppy beers... maybe I'd be into those. Too much pine and bitters, but maybe that's all they will ever be. Meh. I just don't understand how people can pretend to like beers like this."

"I'll skip all the over analysis and get right to it: one of my all time favorite IPAs. I like Serierras ""Torpedo"" but it can be a bit too much at times. The Hop Devil on the other hand... Awesome, always."

"Actually picked up a 6-pack at the local Giant Eagle. Had a best by date of early October, so I thought it must be pretty fresh. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass (thought this was style appropriate). 1 1/2 fingers of slightly off-white head (diminished down to about 1, decent retention). Clear, darkish amber color... good looking beer. Medium one the nose, some hints of lemon, definitely some pine, smells 'clean' overall (reminiscent of the 'clean' smell of DirtWolf; at least to me), maybe just a hint of the 'homebrew keg' smell... but just a hint. Tastes were on point. Bright, resiny pine freshness off the bat, bit of citrus on the back end... not overly malty. Crisp and refreshing to the tastebuds. Overall, a nice refreshing, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel, good carbonation, again very refreshing on the palate. Nice beer. This is a keeper, and I am sure it will find its way into my fridge every once in a while (especially when the dates are right!)."

"This is a very good IPA that I love drinking with any sort of food. Typically I enjoy this beer when I got out or am just relaxing around the house as well. It's obviously very hoppy, being an IPA, but it is also very well balanced and easy to drink."
"This nitro version of the well known and loved classic Hop Devil is outstanding. I'm a big fan of Guinness so I love the pour and have no problem waiting for it to 'cook'. The aroma is very much Hop Devil but the mouthfeel is so smooth you have to control yourself not to finish it off on the first taste. If you've in Downingtown stop in Victory ask for a taste of both the nitro version and the normal tap style."

"O-Overall a good very complex east-coast style ipa, but this just isin't my type of pale. However, this is my first taste of Hop Devil and I will definitely be trying more and hope it grows on me!"

"And tasted the same... Crisp tight and well worth the wait."
"amber color, floral hop aroma and good amount of bitterness on the taste. well balanced, solid malty backbone. pretty perfectly balanced IPA and one of the most consistently decent ones out there. wouldn't take it over a lot of others but its always available and fresh"
""
""
"Despite its presence in the Victory line-up for such a long time it's still extraordinary, I'll take it when I can find it. I love the darker malt bill and still in my top 10 when I can get it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very, very good. I think I still prefer the hop monster west coast IPA's, but this one can hold its own with anybody. Great nose and truly exceptional flavor."
""
""
"An interesting IPA. Pours darker and amber like a red ale. Some fruit hops but more bready and malty grains than others of the style. A little sweetness from the malt offsets the bitterness. A well balanced beer, but it doesn't have the big fruit and hops that I prefer in an IPA. We'll worth a try and a solid overall offering."

"Light brown hued with a quarter inch head of beige foam with vibrant carbonation bubbles. Brussels lacing. Aroma of pine like hops is prevalent. The pine like hop bite is very strong on the front of the palate. The backbone is of light malt and then I get a rush of pine like hops on the fade. The mouth is fairly dry and refreshing."

"Overall- A solid example of a great IPA. This was the first craft beer I tried years ago so maybe it has a sentimental impression on me, but nevertheless, it is damn good if you dont mind a complex bitter blast. The hops linger as much as any other IPA. A must try if you're a hophead."

"taste is mildly sweet with a biscuit flavor within the hop. I cannot find a date on the bottle, as someone else alluded to, but there does seem to be some hop blandness due to time on shelf going on.... a very nice brew, for sure, but not seeing the 'wow' as others have explained...."

"Poured a rich, clear reddish amber with a thin ring of fluffy off-white head. It looks quite nice, though more head formation would be nice. Scents of sweet malt and abundant floral hops upfront, aromas of honey and jasmine are also present, as well as some earthy notes and fainter notes of citrus and pine. Quite well rounded and appealing, very well done aroma in the East Coast style. Flavor begins with a big burst of floral hops and hop bitterness, as well as some caramel malt sweetness backing the hops. In the middle and finish more pine resin flavor comes out, alongside some citrus peel, still backed by a modest level of caramel malt. The finish is mostly pine resin and a bit of caramel malt. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, floral flavors and grainy malt. The flavor profile is quite nice and balances hop bitterness with malt sweetness quite well. Very fitting for an East Coast IPA and quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a slightly sticky and resinous mouthfeel. It is quite easy to drink and very pleasant. Overall this is a good East Coast IPA. It has the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel I expect from the sub-style and it matches quite well with, though not quite as good as, Bell's Two Hearted. Still, it's a good IPA and I'd have it again."

"This really blurs the line between IPA and an amber/red ale due to the balance between the strength of the hop flavors and the malt body (plus it's got an amber color). Hop Devil ultimately stands out as a malt-forward IPA that's quite good, if not quite a stand-out in an increasingly crowded market."
"A different IPA in that is takes a big floral component, lots of smooth fine carbonation, good citrus bite to it, a nice refreshing bitter IPA, would highly recommend and look forward to having it again, some pepperiness to it, an intoxicating smell of complex floral and hop aromas, body is smooth and nuanced, good all-rounder."

"Overall: A very solid American IPA. Good juicy hop notes with a nice caramel malt backbone."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Hop Devil stands out in the IPA world. It's unique in its own way with a healthy amount of malts and spices. An excellent example of an East Coast IPA. Not among my absolute favorites in the style, but a great go to as I reside in PA. Cheers!"
""
"Pours a gorgeous red color with thick, creamy rich head on top. Beautiful. Bready aromas on the nose in addition to dark fruits & pine. Palate offers a wonderful balance of malt with bitterness and prickly citrus flavors. Finish through to the aftertaste is bold, grabby hops with still that nice lingering malt component. Excellent IPA."

"My first experience with Victory. From the first moment with this ale it is clear that it is not your typical American ipa. It pours a deep red amber color with a thick deep cream head that lasts well into the beer. And leaves a thick lacing of off white foam. The aroma is very complex and not reminiscent of most hop heavy ipas. There is a strong presence of malts, some coffee and caramel notes. There are also citrus and pine notes but they are subtle in relativity to the malt. It is very complex and unexpected fir such an unassuming ipa. The flavor is very similar. Im beginning to well respect the east coast for their very complex and deep ipas. Not just the single note hoppy ipas if the west coast. Looking forward to sampling Victory's hop ranch tomorrow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is a little more redish/brown than typical IPAs but is very clear. I was not too impressed with the smell. There is a strong pine nose with hints of hops. The taste is extremely complex with a great spice. The mouthfeel was crisp and easy drinking, not too heavy. This is not my ideal IPA, prefer West Coast IPAs, but think it is an overall great beer!"

"Something missing on the palate...not sure what it is. Game on bitterness with punch and hop loaded for sure but its missing a level of complexity seen in other competing brews of the same style. This is definitely a well crafted and tasty beer, but falls just short of the top tier for the style. For east cost offerings I'd stick with DFH or Troegg's Nugget Nectar although you will pay slightly more for each."

"BBD 3/20/14. Amber pour with a slight ruby cast. Nice head that dissipates with normal lacing. Very nice nose of grapefruit and pine hops. Light medium body and a smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is below normal. Taste is like the nose, mostly hops with grapefruit in the forefront. Finishes smoothly with a pleasant grapefruit bitterness that lingers"
""
"O: This is one that stops and makes you think, which I really appreciate. Certainly an IPA, definitely tasty, just different enough that it's quite intriguing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable IPA. Not quite up to a Two Heart but compares favorably to Founders Centennial or Dark Horse Crooked Tree. I'd rate this above Short's Humalupalicious."
""
""
""
"O Pretty good if not a bit inconsistent. It is bitter and hoppy. I like that. However, there just seems to be something lacking. I am not talking balance. I don't need equal malt in an IPA. There just doesn't seem to be any complexity of mixture of flavors. I wish I could put my finger on it, but it's just lacking. Not bad at all, but just seems that it could be much better. Weird."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a tasty super hopped ipa. not my usual style of ipa but still very good. my first victory beer that has scored in my book."
""
""
""
"The taste follows the scent well but the fruitiness and malt flavors, which has a little honey to it, only really come through in the after taste, after the hops have had there time to wage war on your mouth. Which they do. The bitterness smacks your tongue and sits on the very back on your throat for a good while. This all done very well with a creamy mouthfeel and great drinkability. Beer is good."
""

"O: A very drinkable (even sessionable) IPA. Like their brethren on the West Coast, Victory has put its unique stamp on the style. What’s most impressive to me is how approachable this beer is. It isn’t over-hopped, still bold in its flavors, and backs off the intensity where others might try to amp it up a notch. Sometimes less is more. I certainly find myself able to put down 2 or 3 of these a lot easier than others."
""
""
""
"Earthy and piney hops are the flavor of the day when I take that first sip and those esters linger on for a little while at the end. Mild to moderate hop bitterness. It had some fine IPA characteristics."
""
"Overall, a solid brew, but not one I'm likely to go out of my way to grab again. That being said, I tend towards the more West Coast style IPAs, so this one just isn't to my personal preference. However, I would encourage anyone who is a fan of big, meaty IPAs to pick up a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No freshness date, but no indication that it's not prime either. Starts with a funky hop smell, but improves from there. Light carbonation and a swell bitterness that makes me wonder why this beer smells differently than it tastes. Perhaps it's the malts. 6.7% alcohol is unnoticeable. Not a striking IPA, but not a lousy one either. That being said, I could find a better option without much effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-this beer was better as the glass went down. It was a very good IPA"
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent IPA and a great example of the style. An easy drinker that has a great aroma and full of flavor. I would've like a little more head retention and maybe a slightly more pronounced aroma but still one I'll definitely drink again."
""
""
""
":)"
""
"O: excellent beer, again, not my beer style preference, but if more IPAs are built with this level of complexity, I might have to branch out"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't agree with those who list this beer as their fave, but I'd put it in my top 15-20 IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its not a terrible beer, but it is not the IPA for me. I believe this one defines the east coast IPA, but I like the west coast style a lot better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Excellent IPA, bordering on a double and might pass for such."
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth storing a few. I am curious how it ages."
""
"O - HopDevil is decidedly hoppy with plenty of floral, citrus, and pine notes and a bitter finish but the hops seem to do more work balancing against the big malt body of the beer rather than the other way around but, HopDevil remains a powerful beer regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its the American IPA that's been around forever, and it still holds strong to this day, lots of big bitter hop bite, but not sacrificing flavor."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a very good IPA, with flavors bouncing all over the place, but I think that it is simply my palate that enjoys the overwhelming fruit that this does not provide."

"O - Is this a Rye Pale Ale? In a blind taste test, I wouldn't call this an IPA. I will not repeat this purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Victory does know how to brew an IPA. This is a rich and hoppy brew that will be a constant favorite. Not necessarily a novice IPA but that is probably a good thing. The Caramel tones are second to no other IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"All in all not a great taste. They threw a ton of spices together and prayed... an overpowering taste of hops. Very heavy flavor. I guess a lot of people are into that though. Not me though, not a smooth beer and certainly not good flavor. I would not recommend this overpriced and overrated beer to anyone."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. If you like an American IPA with plenty of malt in the backbone, you will like this. I was a little surprised, based on the namesake, that this beer was not a clear showcase of hops in both the aroma and taste. IMO they did not stand out any more than the malt."
""
"o: Awesome beer, not the best IPA I've ever tasted, but a good deal and definitely worthy of a daily drinker."
""
""
"Pours a very hazy amber color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is okay.  Lacing is decent.  Has a piney, citrus, slightly apple aroma.  Hints of caramel malts.  Caramel malty taste with a moderate piney hop, giving to a floral moderately bitter aftertaste.  Good beer.  A little much on the malts but very tasty none-the-less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall- i am a fan, will be having this one again, not a life-changing beer, but can't pick out anything wrong with it"
""
""
"O - nothing amazing, good though, pretty standard east coast american ipa. I'm starting to notice that I like the east coast IPAs a lot less. They're always too malty. Stone ipa is widely available and much better."
""
"More taste and mouthfeel of a barley wine rather than an IPA. Still quite fragrant of hops though the malts shines through and I love barley wines."

"I have little to say about this beer aside from the fact that it is one of the best, well-rounded IPA's I have had, especially tapped... NITRO! I don't have much else to say about this beer aside from the fact that the Pour House located by Doylestown, PA is where I first had the beer and the food I had with is was just as good. A bacon cheese burger topped with a smear of blue cheese- goo. Sooo tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best of the beers I've reviewed here, I don't know if it's my favorite American IPA but it's certainly in the running. A must-try, and I suspect on draft (I've never had it on draft) even better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hop Devil doesn't get enough credit for being a very strong representation of an American IPA. Extremely delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Part of an assorted six pack that I picked up for a song. Looks like this may be the mother lode, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a very complex aroma of molasses but not much hops, odd referencing the name. Pours to a red golden color with a pillow foamy beige two finger head. On the taste the complexity continues, this brew is almost imperial ipa-esque in its existence. The taste starts thick and syrupy with an apparent high ABV, it the transitions into nice deep hop kick with a yet strong malted background. The finish is a growing bitter aftertaste that yearns another sip. A great selection from Victory. I will seek out."

"Drinkabilty - I recommed this beer to everyone. It has plenty of flavor, just enough hop kick, nice smooth malts, and light alcohol at the finish. Balance is amazing, drinks very easy and very affordable. This is a classic example of a beer that gets overlooked cause its been around for awhile, made year round, and is always avaible around here. Truly world class, glad I revisited this one."

"Pours an amber color with medium off white slowly fading head, some lacing. Aroma and Taste is of floral citrus hops, caramel malt, some yeast and fruity esters. Palate is a medium body with mild carbonation. Finishes with caramel malt, yeast and fruity notes, along with some moderate hops bitterness for balance. Overall a good drinking session brew."

"O- A quintessential east coast IPA. One that's just as enjoyable now as it was many years ago when I first had it."

"PS: There is a distinct possibility that age plays a role in the reviewers' reaction, so I'll try to come back to it again after a few weeks."

"This is a keeper. I usually find myself not returning to Ipa's with the ""piney"" bitter aftertaste. This one is an exception. Poured into a teku, this has seriously awesome creamy head for an ipa and it retains well. Most ipa's have head which dissipates, but not this beer. The color is deep amber, almost red, full of dancing bubbles. The scent at first is piney and spicy but halfway through mellows out and a deep jasmine scent dominates. Quite lovely really. Perfect carbonation: not too much, not too little. A mellow yet spicy and resin like taste which rounds out to slight bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue, maybe a bit grapefruit like? A bit of hotness I suppose, but this is probably just accentuated by the bitterness! This is like drinking a juicy hop!, and an extremely drinkable one at that! I cannot wait to try this on tap!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good. No upfront flaws apparent outright. Really enjoyable, it would be easy to drink a few of these. A well balanced IPA, which isn't always easy to find. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Poured a clear and vivid orange with a decent head that fell down reluctantly. Chunky lacing. Bright hops nose with lots of slick pine and sweet citrus. No malt to speak of on the nose. On the palate it’s got medium body and good carbonation. It’s bedeviled with hops but lacking in balance without a bigger malt character to back it up. Goes down oily with a good bitter aftertaste. A very plucky ale. Easy to drink and a clean, long finish."

"This beer had a great hoppy flavour, but not too hoppy. It had a great golden brown color, like an ale. It had good mouth feel and a good smell. It had a pleasent aftertaste. If you like a hoppy beer, this could be your beer. Enjoyed this beer on tap in Rochester"

"Final Thoughts: Though I suspect that this bottle of HopDevil Ale is a little old, the flavor has stood the test of time. The hops and malt work together and strike a great balance. The bitterness has become mellow in a way that suits the beer well. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"Overall, it's a very good ale. I'm partial to more floral and citrus hoppiness but this is a beer that is worth seeking out."
""
"Maybe I've been spoiled by the IPA's in San Diego. It may also be a West Coast / East Coast thing but this just has too much malt for me. When I see something called ""HopDevil"" I expected a hop-bomb with no concern for balance. Like I said, it may be a WC/EC thing but it makes me tap my heals and chant: ""There's No Place Like Home, There's No Place Like Home""."

"O - Sad to admit that this may be my first taste of Victory. I will definitely hunt out more of their beers after trying this one. Whole flower hops done right."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"Had this poured into a pint glass. Awesome beer to have in the Spring or Fall months, but really any time of year. Super crisp, outstanding flavor of hops and citrus (especially big on the hops as the name would lead you to believe). Really nice copper color with a whitish foam head. Just enough boozy flavor to let you know it's there without getting into the range of an imperial or anyhting like that. One of the best offerings I've had from Victory, very nice beer."

"Overall / Drinkability: A good AIPA, but not a great one. The aroma makes wonder if this one had been in the keg a bit too long (it had been awhile since they changed out the keg). By itself nice, but not wow. Went well with food (walleye) and okay drinkability, but without food, I think I would have stopped at one."
"O: I wish this beer wasn't an old bottle. I have had this beer many times in the past and my rating will not do it justice in the long run. It's a solid IPA with big hoppy feels ans a rounded out malt bill. An east coast IPA standard."

"O) A delicious IPA."
""

"The smell is not very strong and has light and sweet malts, bread, and floral hops. Taste is similar to the nose but with a large addition of spicy hops. Starts with malt and white bread, then floral hops, followed by a rush of spicyness. Ends with spice and grapefruit. Very crisp finish. Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Honestly let down a little. Not bad, above average for an IPA, but not as good as the score might lead me to believe."
"O not bad, I venture to say my beer wasn't as fresh as one would desire. Lots of hop oils left on the back of the tongue. Probably will not buy again. I taste lots of centennial bbut not much else. I've had and made better."

"Pours a mildly carbonated golden orange with a finger of foam. Good visibility with mediocre retention and lacing. Aroma of spicy malts with a strong malt base. Orange and other citrus rind meld with some floral notes and alcohol, pretty balanced here. Taste follows the nose well, upfront spicy hop with a sturdy malted backbone. Not much of the floral or citrus notes translate well to the palate, leaving much of the flavor cut and dry hop and malt. The two balance each other well, but leave the overall flavor pretty bland- not much complexity. Feel is solid, dry and sticky, easy to drink with well concealed alcohol. Overall this beer is good in a balanced sense, however living on the west coast I'm used to my ipas ridiculously over hopped and citrusy, not something I get with this beer. As a result I disagree with it's average rating pretty dramatically. This beer just isn't for me"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice cloudy reddish amber with a decent 1 finger white head. Smells of earthy hops, and some sweet barley. Tastes of citrus and pine with slight barley, very nice balance. Beer is slightly over carbonated, but for its medium body it is still a great beer with nice balance. Overall a very good beer."

"Pours a murky, dirty amber color with a meager white head that soon disappears. Aroma has a strong grapefruit and pine hop presence (though I've smelt more ferocious than this). Flavor matches the aroma--hops, hops, and more hops. Maybe some malt character can be detected in the finish, but it's hard to tell with the prolonged hop taste. Drinkable, but decidedly one-dimensional. Typical IPA."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into a becker. Clear orange with visible carbonation, foamy 2 finger head that dissipates about halfway then sticks around, chunky lacing. Smell is very sweet and flowery, as well as the usual hoppy smell of an IPA. Taste is hops hops hops, then finishing off with a much crisper clean end than most IPAs. Overall a great IPA, easy to drink and great tasting. Another victory for Victory."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer does the name justice. The mix of flavors, dominated by the citrus and spice hoppy taste is an incredible experience, even though it kicks your palate's ass. A brew every hop-head should try. But even people who don't like the hop bitterness, but appreciate beer, will be pleased by the complexity of the flavor and the feeling you get from it. Highly recommended."

"First time, great color a clear copper with a least two fingers of head that did not disappear quickly, good lacing. Smell was a bit weaker than I like but the taste makes up for it. Mouthfeel was especially nice and finished soft and smooth. Overall I enjoyed this beer!"

""

""

"Pours a dark orange tannic rust, clear as could be. Smells great. The sweetness enhancesn the light floral character of the hops. I wish the World smelled just that way. Just on the nose alone, you know this one will be good. Tastes great! Terrific presence of the malt early, and then replaced by a nice and strong hop hit, all busy and everything, and sustain of the hops lasts at least five minutes. Great after-follow here, on the bitterness I mean. Wow. Mouthfeel is foamy-creamy and high and roiling but soft and not at all scrubbing. A terrific experience from front to back. More of this in my future, sure."

"Pours a beautiful mahogany red with rocky off white head. Aroma is of subdued hops and traces of malt. Taste is bitter hops with a slight sweetness of creamy caramel maltiness and notes of banana. Well balanced in that it is a bitter brew with a touch of sweetness. There is not a lot of complexity to the hops, some notes of fruit and citrus rinds. Fruit notes are subtle hints of pear and pineapple. There is a nice roasted flavor to the malts, which lends strength to the bitterness. Subtle bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of an orange peel. The palate is light and smooth with little carbonation."
"O: I really enjoy this beer when I can. Its moderately priced for a 24 case ($35). I wouldn't have too many in one sitting, as its got a fairly strong taste to accompany the 6.7% abv."
" I would buy this beer again for sure , a good beer to have in the arsenal"

"I only bought the trial single, but now am wishing I had the follow up to see what I missed the first time. Very nice!"

"I know there is a lot of talk about the countless IPAs out there, but this one stands out enough in every way for me to remember and seek it out."

"O: solid brew all the way around. wish there was a bit more balance with the bitterness and the tropical fruits. but overall its solid."
""

"-Overall 4.5: This beer is beyond a mere American IPA. It is something else, it is its own creature that defies classification. If you are a fan of IPAs, this one will stun you. There are some drawbacks to this beer (not easily sessionable, does not go well with some food), but very, very few. A legend and definitely worth tracking down and trying if you have not yet done so."

"This is one good IPA. It pours up a cloudy apricot color with a one finger head and beautiful lacing. Smell is pine, floral, malt, biscuit, and citrus. Taste pretty much follows the nose. I get a nice spicy flavor up front followed by a dry hoppy finish. The aftertaste lingers a little too long and is fairly strong. A solid IPA which is recommended."
""
""
"O: For better or worse, it's a bog standard IPA. Basically, if you've had SN Torpedo or FW Union Jack, you'll know what to expect here. I'd gladly get it again so long as its fresh."

"O - Well built IPA, great hop character, very refreshing and enjoyable."

"This beer is gorgeous. A beautiful translucent honey color which poured with about a half inch of head which stayed for the better part of five minutes. Very nice lacing that stays and stays. The smell is subtle and citrus-y. Despite it's relatively mild aroma, this beer hits the taste buds hard. Man! Bitter and sour--very much like a yellow grapefruit (definitely hop-forward. The taste is complex and deep, but the hops win out big time)--but in a really good way. A great mouthfeel--It completely coats the mouth and the taste lingers for a long time. This beer is hearty, full bodied, creamy and delicious. I have a hard time with IPAs, but this one is amazing! By far the best beer in the fridge at my local shop."
""
""
"Overall: This is my go-to IPA"
""
""
""
""
"It finishes clean with a dry grapefruit peel aftertaste like an IPA should. Good carbonation and medium body make this a very drinkable IPA, with a great price and good availability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5): As an IPA, I expect some bitterness but this one seemed to be a bit too bitter. Also, I'm left wondering about the consistency of this beer from bottle to bottle. The first one I had seemed clearer in appearance, and less bitter. This one was a bit cloudier and more bitter."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought for sure this would satisfy my hop craving, but it just didn't do the job. A little underwhelmed with my first offering from Victory. The odd dark fruit flavor really threw me off here. Maybe I'll try it again down the road with a bottle that's a little more fresh."
""
""

"O- Great taste, powerful hops. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, and will be picking it up again. If you like hoppy beers, specifically IPAs then I would also give this a shot."

""
"Get it if you love hops."

"O: One of my standby IPAs. I tend to lean towards very hop-centric IPAs with just enough interesting malt flavors to back them up, but this is definitely more on the balanced side. The malt is definitely a big player here, though it's not got an overpowering caramel sweetness that I find in a lot of malt-centric IPAs (supposedly they use Munich rather than crystal malts, which might account for this)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, citrus zest, and some caramel aromas. Taste is of malt, citrus zest, herbal hops, and a slight brown sugar/caramel flavor on the finish. There is an astringent hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but I am not a fan of the astringent bitterness on this one."
""
""

"Clear, apple cider color with a small thick foamy head that dissipates quickly. Aromatic orange and fruity-zesty hop aroma with a rounded sweet and slightly toasted malty background. Good hop bitterness early in the sitting. Caramel maltiness takes over as the beer warms. Soft watery mouthfeel because of the lower carbonation. Fairly dry on the finish with no distracting sidenotes. A tasty drinkable IPA. Not as devilish as the name implies."

"This is my go-to staple IPA.  It is nicely balanced, great mouth-feel, soft flavors.  It's called ""hop devil"" but I really think it is so well-balanced that the name is a bit mis-placed.  Sometimes IPAs have a hoppy bite, but this is much more balanced than many others.  The Bros are right with the ""World Class"" rating.  Great beer."
""
"2015 Note. Tasted great from the bottle. Reminds me of a Sierra Nevada Northern Harvest. This has less caramel nut still has a solid malt presence to compensate for the IBUs."
""
"A decent brew, but not one of the best IPAs I've had. It just feels a little flatter and more generic. Despite the intrigue promised on the nose, this really ended up being ""just another IPA""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best IPAs out there. An all around balanced beer."
"A good beer overall. A bit hard to pick out the characteristics but regardless an enjoyable beer to drink. A good job on the balance of malt and hops while still displaying qualities characteristic of an IPA, that is, hop-forwardness. I would say it lives up to its name with the overstated hop character. I am beginning to feel more and more relaxed as the glass gets emptier..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this plenty of times over the years on draft and in a bottle. Thought I reviewed it, but it was the Hop Wallop. Both are solid Victory offerings and go to beers if in the IPA mood."
"My introduction to the beauty of the hop over 10 years ago. Pours a sweet reddish brown with a nice head and good lacing. The aroma is a piney hop and a clean beer. Taste is more bitter and less sweet. Great beer and for sure a benchmark for Victory."

"This is probably one of the best IPA's I've had, and a beer that I'll return to from time to time. You can't go wrong with Hopdevil. Very hop-heavy, with a a bitter, but well balanced aftertaste. Very piney/grassy, with a medium bodied feel. Tonight I've had 4 IPA's, Titan IPA (Great Divide) , Union Jack IPA (Firestone), Stone IPA (Stone), and Hopdevil. Out of the four, I'd go back to this one first. If you've ever tried the Union Jack or the Stone, this is a similar beer in regards to it's high hop presence and grassy/piney/floral taste. Try it!"

"The taste shines on this one. Refreshing, wet, and bitter. Nice malts to sooth that ohhh so good bitterness. Some peach, mango, and pineapple try to come through. A very strong hop bitter aftertaste. This is a rather moist Ipa. A very good offering from Victory."

"HopDevil pours a dark amber, and is capped with a thin, off-white colored head - decent lacing. An amazing bouquet of hop aromas greet the nose. Grapefruit and other citrus notes, as well as floral and pine resiny aromas round out with a slight caramel malt hints. Hops dominate on the pallet as well, with citrus flavors clearly standing out before a caramel and toffee malt backbone balance it all out. Crisp, and smooth, HopDevil is medium in both body and carbonation, and is also superbly balanced. Simply a fantastic IPA!"

"O - This is a great IPA. It is very-well balanced between the malt and the hops and very drinkable. Bitterness slowly builds but is never overpowering. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. If you see it anywhere, it’s only in a the finish as a little bit of warmth, but I may be imagining that. At nearly 7% ABV, that’s pretty impressive. Really nice beer. I’m upset at myself for not getting into craft beer sooner and not trying more from Victory while I was in college in Pennsylvania. Oh well. I’ve got a lot of drinking left to do in my career. I’ll get to more from Victory eventually."

"O- This is a superb IPA and the perfect example of an east coast hoppy beer. I do wish this was a bit easier to obtain in my area but I will make due with at least having tried it. Great stuff."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, for some reason I can't find any of the usual bottle dates. This pours a nice amber color with a massive tight foamed tan head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of hops and peppers, a little caramel. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, this one isn't as fresh as some of the ones I've had before but its still great, the hops have died down a little but they're still present, a nice peppery finish along with some sweet caramel backbone. This is great even a little older but amazing when fresh."

"I think this beer would appeal to fans of Czech pilsners. It has a nice herbal quality to it that adds to the refreshment. Glad I picked up a single of this. It really hit the spot."
""
"I can see why a lot of people really care for this beer. It's hoppy, and it's also malty. The balance is nice. Unfortunately for me, I'm not in love with either the hop profile or the malt profile. It's good, but there's so much competition in this style that I don't find myself drinking HopDevil that often."

"overall: solid beer, very enjoyable stuff..up there in the top 10 percent of Ipa's that I've tried..good price, it's about 2 bucks a 6er cheaper than most high quality IPA's. As far as readily available beers go, really nice. Would recommend and buy again."

"Fresh bottle in a duvel tulip. Pours a hazy copper amber with an inch of white head that leaves decent lacing. Aroma is pineapple, orange, tropical fruit, grapefruit, grass, and caramel. Taste is pine, grapefruit, caramel, and some bread in the back. Thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Very sessionable."

"Aroma and taste are very much in line; bitter citrus and pine resin hops; faintly floral notes, caramel malt that’s a bit sweeter in the taste than in the nose but doesn’t overshadow the hoppiness. The flavors are really detailed and not just bitter; finishes semi-dry, with a kiss of sweetness and lingering bitterness. Again this won’t blow any major hopheads away in today’s IPA scene but it’s a very well-made and dependable beer that easy to drink, easily found, and an easy answer when you want a nice hop fix."
""
""
""
""

"Overall another delicious IPA that I would recommend to any hophead. I like the use of whole flower hops as they add a nice nectar quality. Smell on this is perhaps the best part."

"out for a happy hour with some co workers to celebrate a career move for a buddy. bottle poured a deep syrupy amber with a thin head. nose catches an almost barleywine smell of syrup. taste is of faded hops, but truth be told the barkeep presented this brew out of thin air when the beer I requested was out of stock so likely old, but no bottle date doesn't help the cause. more resembles a barley or old ipa, but that wasn't what I was looking for, so pretty mush just decent in my opinion, but not bad, but not something I will look for again."

"Victory HopDevil is an excellent IPA that I would recommend as a must-drink for any hophead, and you'll want to drink it several times again. While being a great example of a hoppy beer, it is not overwhelmingly bitter, and I would even recommend it to one hoping to be introduced to the wonderful world of hops."

"O: A really great, well-balanced IPA that is much less of a hop bomb than its name implies, instead balancing some hoppy bitterness with sweeter flavors."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Hoppily smooth savoury sweet smell instantly impresses and is supported by a browny orangy haze with some bright orange sparkles. Thick dense slightly rocky and glossy off white head which inspires rings of lacing with every sip. SOme fizz in the middle but a very bitter end for the style which is fiesty and certainly blunt. Sort of unsophistaicated and rough for the style but forgetting those constraints this is a very likeable beer which i would gladly have again and again."

"This is a great IPA! One of my few that are always in stock in my fridge. The pour produces a golden full bodied appearance with ample frothy head that lasts. The smell is sticky sweet with a hint of the delicious hops. Mouthfeel is full and well balanced with excellent taste. I enjoy a full bodied beer and this really delivers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid IPA, though a bit boring. Quite well balanced and very drinkable. Solid bitterness and a nice sweetness. A decent IPA"
""
""
""
"O - I'm into this beer but am not crazy about it. It's more about hopping the hell out of the beer than balancing the flavors. If you're not a hop head there is no reason for you to pick up this brew."
""
""
"Pretty smooth, low carbonation, medium body, and dry."
""
""
""
""

"Regardless, this is an IPA that deserves to be counted among the national greats. Some may prefer others, but this has a deserved placed in the the pantheon. A little more rugged and a little thicker than average, this is a treat and a challenge in one package."

"Hop Devil is a solid, reliable IPA with plenty of grapefruit, floral bitterness to go around. A dry, prickly mouthfeel with a certain creaminess to it completes the package. Balanced just towards the spicy, bitter side, this could easily be any hop lover's go to beer."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very good- medium body with moderate carbonation. A little oily but I like that in an IPA. Excellent, very drinkable IPA. In terms of price and availability, I think this is the best IPA out there."
""
""
"O: As good as I remember this beer from the early 2000s, it has really stood up through the test of time (and that was when there were not a lot of aggressively hoppy beers being produced on the East Coast). The beer has nice balance and complexity and is very enjoyable. Might be a little too intense for a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delivers balance and complexity; distinct characteristics; very well crafted."
"disappointing aroma, hoppy but not that grassy IPAish aroma I love, amber color with a nice head that sticks around for a while, Hoppy but completely balanced by the malts, Extremely smooth! but could use a stronger hop finish, I was expecting more from this beer...I prefer west coast IPAs..."
""
"O - I have always enjoyed Hop Devil and while this wasn't the best I have had, this one was no different. Glad I gave it a try but I think I will stick to on-tap for this one."
""
""
""
"O-A nice earthy IPA. Could have used a tad more bitterness though."
""
"O: Overall, a very good IPA bordering on great, that I find myself going to fairly often.  Good flavor profile and drinkability, and it's ready available and reasonably priced.  Certainly worthy of a try.  I will add that I prefer it out of the bottle over on tap, as the hop characters are more prevalent from the bottle.  "
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, but not something I would rush out to buy again, especially not if I was in the mood for an IPA. Definitely wouldn't mind paying $3.50 for a pint though at a bar."
""
""
""
"355ml bottle.Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´11.Orangish brass color. Foggy. Yellowish white copious foam.Good retention & sumptuous lacing rings. Malts & acid hops salute in nose,bready notes too.Esters explote in mouth but yield to the warming alcohol quickly masked by hops with an extra dry but oily bitterness.Incredible creamy & buttery mouthfeel.Good drinkability. Refreshing beer. A big one!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Straight up awesome IPA, very tasty, drinkable, definitely a top option that should be considered when available"
""
"Aroma--earthy aroma, almost a moxie to it but not revolting. Appearance---pale, golden clear river of loveliness Taste---harden-up, turn your head and swallow. heavy bitterness. Palate---medium body, thick texture, fizzy with a somewhat bitter start and finish though i want more... Overall...i have taste tested worse...i have tested better...middle of the road and a good standby"

"O: A quality beer for sure. Not sure that it's better than a Dogfish Head 60-minute, or other earthy IPAs I've had, but this is good. Would certainly drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know how this has less flavour than their Oktoberfest (consumed prior). Not bad but at this stage I expect quite a lot more from an American IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Color is a rich amber with a very nice head. The flavor is hoppy, but this really makes for a well-balanced brew by a solid malt foundation. Carbonation is restrained, letting the hops speak for themselves, and contributing to a fine smoothness for such an ale with an assertive hoppy edge. This is a really good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good go on west-coast style ultra-hopped IPA and is very drinkable...but it doesn't quite hit the mark for me. I think it's the strong malt that I find a bit distracting, but others of course may find this characteristic appealing. Would I drink it every day? Pronably if it was the only hop-tastic beer I could get my hands on, but alas there's lots of options, even here in NoVA. Thanks for the effort Victory!"
"Overall: The malt and hop levels are perfect. So well balanced. I'd definitely have another."

"O: Disappointed, personally was looking for more hops, a great blend and good beer, I would classify as a mild IPA."

"One of my desert island beers."
"Textbook US IPA. I like it an awful lot."
""
""
""
"Fairly full-bodied with a surprisingly restrained effervescence for the style. Drying finish. A much nicer IPA, much more balanced than so many others, not all hops with nothing else, well worth drinking."
""
"O - Would have liked to have seen less malt in this beer with a little more hop punch. Nonetheless a flavoursome drop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a more malt forward ipa than the moniker might suggest. A bit more hop complexity would really make this exceptional, as well as a tamer toast character."
""
""
""
"O: The hops are nice but this doesn’t have a whole lot of complexity. Being more of a fan of citrusy IPAs than pine-centric IPAs, I didn’t go ga-ga over this. However I can appreciate that it is a finely crafted beer and would happily grab a sixer of it in a pinch."
"O: Sipping this brings me back to Sierra Nevada’s Celebration, but without the intense hoppiness. There’s a certain balance to this beer that brings these flavors to a place I wish every IPA could go to: smooth, complex, and with a drinkable hop presence. Victory has seriously bottled excellence here."
"Overall: A very interesting IPA indeed. It doesn't finish with a strong bite like you would expect, rather it hits you right up front and fades into a bubbly sweetness. I got this in a make your own 6 pack, and I'm glad I did. Not sure if I'd go for a 6 pack of this by itself though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a better than average, drinkable IPA. I am not finding the bitterness overwhelming, and there is a nice variety of hops elements in the smell and taste to keep me coming back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good, not my favorite from Victory. I do prefer its calmer flavor to a more aggressive IPA. Not often that I'd rank mouthfeel and appearance higher than something like smell - almost as if all components don't really come together."

"12 oz. bottle poured to Hefe glass. Pours amber red with a large white head. Smell is on the floral hop side, very little citrus or pine on this one. Flavor is very malt forward, caramel, toffee, some sweetness. Hops are not particularly present in the flavor, with little citrus or pine influence. Medium carbonation and heavier on the palate than I expected. Overall I was not impressed with this one and suspect I got an old bottle. Will revisit."

"Overall - What a nice IPA! I'm really enjoying this alot. Not overly bitter, and definitely not overly sweet, such a perfect balance. A great looker with nice lacing and a fantastic mouthfeel, alcohol is very well hidden too, and sessionable at 6.7% A must try."

"Appropriate level of carbonation for what it is, and ultimately a quite drinkable beer. I was not overly excited about this going in (I'm not a huge hop head), but was thoroughly impressed. I felt like it was exceptionally crafted, with good balance. Nice and smoothe, with a mellow complexity to it, it brings to mind fine wine (not in flavours, but in character). Absolutely give it a try if you see it. Well worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"O- a solid American IPA."
""
""
""
""
"A red to amber hue slightly cloudy with low carbonation head quickly dissappated. Feels slight creamy caramel with a big citrus kick"
""
""
"O- Stands out in an overcrowded field of IPA's. Not your average IPA with the big German malt bill, but the hop profile on this is what brings me back time and again. Fantastic stuff."
"Overall: The beer has a great appearance and although the taste is very good, I found myself a little let down just because of how good it looked. Definitely worth trying again."

"Hey, in PA, you take what you can get. And, this has always been a great IPA to turn to. Local and fresh. And, that's important."

"Overall- this is one of my favorite beers and is readily available where I live, it does not taste like every other ipa, thi an ipa for those of us who like hops and lot of em!"

"Solid IPA, probably not the best of the best, but definitely a breath of fresh air for those like me who gravitate more toward dark stouts and porters. Worth a try for any craft beer lover!"
""
"O: Typical malt forward East Coast IPA. A solid beer, but pretty average for the style. Nothing really makes it stand apart from the solid malt base and light hop variations."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an orange/ amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head. Body is a little hazy. Head settles to a thick film. Smell is of malt, also some citrus hops, I think I detect a little bit of a floral smell in there. Taste definitely pins this as an East-coast IPA, Malts come through well along with the citric and pine hop flavors. Mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected for an IPA. Carbonation is on the mild side. This is a fine beer, but it is hard to stand out when everybody and their dog brews an IPA, compared to the entire field of the style, it is lacking a characteristic to make it stand out."

"Just getting to rating this in December, 2011. Enjoyed at Victory next to Hop Wallop and Ranch S, a bit of an IPA tasting. This is darker than Hop Wallop, a reddish copper with a white head. Flavor is super tight, pretty dry, caramel malt with a faint sweetness, a hops are prevalent and throughout the palate a la a fresh harvest ale. I began to appreciate the dryness of this, and the tight balance next to Ranch, which was a hot mess in comparison. Kind of a scaled down version of Hop Wallop, as they're both on the drier side and have a really fresh hop expression that reminds me of harvest ales more than standard American IPA."

"I am new to the beer review and do not know all of the proper terminology to use that would justify this incredible beer. I am a big Victory fan, have been for years and HopDevil is my favorite hands down. Hopdevil can be consumed all year long becuase it is always available. If you are a hop head this is definitely a beer for you. HopDevil has a wonder hoppy flavor and it is not too over powering in the alcohol department in other words you can drink a 6 pack after work and still drive home for dinner. When a hopDevil is poured into a glass you imediately notice its pleasant smell and its color. The taste is burst of flavors the kick the you know what out of your mouth and tongue. I enjoy fish, steak and poultry while consuming HopDevil. Give it the old college try!!!"

"O: This is a beer from a bygone era, really. Not too many people are making American IPAs this way anymore. Certainly not your West Coast hop bomb; balance is the name of the game here. Having said that, there is certainly still a place for it. In the end it's just a damn good beer that drinks too easily, and that will win the day regardless of where the style is heading at present. An excellent pairing with a mild to medium-hot salsa."

"Pours a nice darker color for an IPA. Only got a small head built up but great lacing down the glass. Smell is piney with a hint of malt sweetness. Great hop taste with this one. For a hop centered beer they keep everything in check. It's hop dominated but very well rounded. I like a beer that goes overboard with hops but I know a great balance as well. Great beer and for sure one to put on your list of beers to try."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a beautiful brigjt reddish orange, with half inch of off white head, leaves some attractive lacing. Smell is tangerine, pine, grass, and some floral hops also. Taste is all of that, tangerine and floral hops are most prominent. This is a really balanced IPA, very nice flavor, not over the top. Body isn't overly dry, not thick or thing, just right. Plenty of life and very drinkable. This beer is great, must be the freshest Hopdevil I have ever had, says best before April 7th 2012."

"A darker IPA with a very thin head that turned to nothing but a few suds. Great pine and floral smell. Has some sweet roasted malt taste, even some burnt sugar, followed but spicy, floral, but not some much bitter hop notes. Easy to drink, doesn't over whelm the pallet. I actually find it quite mellow, like an extra floral pale ale."

"famous for a reason, but really the first of its kind... a big bold merger of a red ale and an ipa. pours redish with plenty of head, smells like an ipa, but add some malty sweetness a la american red/amber ale. makes for a really nicely balanced flavor profile with the hops still dominant. bitter but not brutal finish. medium body and good carbonation make it plenty drinkable. goes great with grilled chicken, and gets a nice warm buzz on. one of the first craft beers i got into, i owe a lot to this one."

"The flavor profile here is complex and intense. The hops reach every spectrum and the malt is complimentary and reaching in its own right. Definitely worth checking out."

"Ok - i've had HopDevil many times in bottle and in draft...and to no surprise, I do find this too be much, much better on draft. A flavorful IPA with not too much power, you can drink a few of these. Has a craft taste to it, which I say as a complement, not a criticism. I am fan of most beers from Victory in including one of my favorites, Prima Pils. if you like IPAs that are not over the edge, you probably will enjoy this one thoroughly. Get it on draft and enjoy it that much more."

"pours a dark copper color with a finger and a half of thick sudsy white head that leaves patchy lacing. smell and taste are pretty much one in the same with great citrus hops flavor up front and sweet bready malts to carry it thru to the long dry pine flavored finish. has a medium body with an oily feel to it and good carbonation. overall this is another fine brew by victory brewing."
"O - A very tasty American IPA and a solid example of the style. Certainly a surprise and would be nice to be able to grab a 6-er of this at leisure."
"Thanks again, Joe!"
"O - Wow, I 'thought' I've had this one before...MUCH better than I was expecting!!!A tasty and balanced IPA, AWESOME!"
"drinkability - a very potent and hoppy brew"
"I enjoyed it. Not for the weak palated!"
"Tasted and Reviewed 1945-2015 10/31/11"
"Very good american ipa. Great mouthfeel."
"Taste: medium bodied, pale and toasty malt taste with a subtle grainy character. Hop flavor coats the palate as it moves through the mouth, the aromas float off the tongue and match well with the nose. Leaves a bitter tingle throughout the mouth as the sharper hop characters settle in."
"O - This beer is from the Gods (I've been watching alot of Spartacus). I put this up there with the best American IPA's I've ever had. This is a must have if you haven't already tried it."
"Overall: Not the best IPA i have ever had. Not a huge fan of the flavor and overall feel of the beer would like the body to be a bit lighter"
"O- A very good IPA. Very solid. Would have liked a little more citrus notes to balance out the pine. Huge huge Pine bomb."
"Frankly I'm at a loss to understand why other people evidently like this one so much."
"Overall: The smell was fantastic but did not transfer over to well to the taste. Not too big on the mouthfeel either. Seemed too dry for my taste in an IPA. The warmer it got the better it tasted. Next time I wll definitely let this sit for about 20-30 minutes before drinking. The citrus and hops came out more. Cheers!"
"O/D - Not sure how I should rate this. I enjoyed the beer but I understood the potential of it had it not been so out of date. I can see the potential for it's IPA hop profile to shine through more heavily, however it didn't on this sample. Still a good beer this time 'round."
"O: This beer rocks! Thoroughly enjoyed every sip of this brew. Great balance between the hops and malt."
"O: solid beer, too bad I got an old version. I'll try it again some time and pay more attention to the best by date."
"O - Great example of a great american IPA, I like that balance and the hopping is just right too, enough to keep me sipping for a good while. I wish the ABV was a little lower, would make a great session IPA"
"I dream that all beer can be this good."
"O - Very good beer, with a good balance of flavors. Very lucky to live near the brewery. Picked up a 1/6 keg for the first time. Enjoyable."
"O- Living near victory, i am lucky enough to fill growlers of this stuff constantly. I am spoiled. This is such a great beer fresh, i must pat victory on the shoulder and maybe even give them a hug, i love this beer so much."
"This a very tasty, well balanced IPA. A hint of alcohol is noticeable. I am definitely going to try this in a six pack -- very easy and enjoyable to drink."
"O - Very good beer, with a good balance of flavors."
"Appearance is copper under a big billowy off-white head. The head stays in place for a long time, and leaves lots of lacing. A very handsome beer. The scents of caramel and citrus make for a very enjoyable smell. Malts are surprisingly dominant in the taste, for an IPA. Caramel sweetness is most prominent, with a grapefruit bitterness in the finish that's enough to keep hop heads happy. Nice complexity and good mouthfeel. Not what I was expecting from this IPA, but definitely a pleasant surprise."
"Victory Brewing Hop Devil IPA: It’s time to discuss variety, supposedly the spice of life. Do you try a new beer or go with a tried and true beer, which you know is good. Is the reward of discovering a new great beer worth the risk of having a six pack in the fridge that turned out to be a dud? I have decent list of known great IPA’s. Why try yet another, like the Hop Devil? Well I did. The Hop Devil, once in the glass, has a brown color, very dark for an IPA, and an off-white head. The aroma is more of roasted malt than aromatic hop. The flavor has a back bone of roasted malt, but prominent throughout is a lot of hop bitters. It’s a good IPA, but not as balanced as others and missing the really aromatic flavorful hops that I prefer to have come out in an IPA. So in this case, I should have stayed with one of my tried and true standards in the IPA world. Such are the risks of beer exploration."
"* I haven't had any others."
"O- A very enjoyable IPA with great balance. I would definitely buy this stuff again. I expected a lot more ""hop"" flavor with a name like ""Hopdevil"" but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors."
"Pours a beautifully clear amber with a two finger head that sticks around. There are tons of tiny bubbles rising to the top. A beautiful spectacle indeed! The aroma is caramel, molasses, citrus, and some pine. Nothing overwhelming, but nice nonetheless. The taste is pine and citrus. I can't really pinpoint what kind of citrus I am tasting, but I am not getting grapefruit. This is a pretty bitter beer, but the malt sweetness really balances it out. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is medium. Overall, one of the best IPA's out there. My only complaints is the mouthfeel. I prefer a thicker mouthfeel. The taste is spot on for the style and there are very few IPA's in my area (South Florida) that top this one. Extremely drinkable and highly recommend."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper hue which leaves a creamy two finger head that stays and leaves nice clingy lacing,the smell is floral and piney hops mixed with boiled candy and caramel,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with tastes of grapefruit,caramel/toffee,boiled candy,a touch of pineapple and finished with a resiny piney hop finish and overall i like the drinkiability of this drop as it still packs a punch but could drink all night cheers."
"Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Nice beer."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Starts off very hoppy but is quickly balanced out nicely with the malts. Very drinkable."
"Overall - This is yet another home run for Victory brewing. A great well balanced beer, with just the right ABV level at 6.7% to make it punchy yet not too strong at all. Its wonderful. Enjoy!"
"Overall it's a good, pretty highly drinkable IPA. Nothing mind blowing by any means. I think it's a little heavy on the buttering hops and could use a little more flavorful finishing hops. But it's a solid IPA."
"Overall, a sentimental favorite, so I'm somewhat biased on this one. But I think it deserves it. Really. A great beer to display the fine qualities of American IPAs."
"O: a delicious brew, not too hoppy despite the name, but hits on all the right notes"
"Overall: Very drinkable. Very drinkable. Nice sweet malts followed by clean piney/grapefuit hops."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty orange/amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, a touch of citrus. Taste is also quite the hop bomb. A touch of citrus, no malts to speak of, very bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Dr: Very drinkable. It avoids the two common pitfalls of IPAs: it's neither too coarse nor too bitter. I'd recommend it to fans of the style as a rare example of a well done IPA. That said, there's work to be done. I look forward to trying more beers from the same brewery."
"The Rest: Medium bodied, great flavor and its on tap all over Rochester. This is a great stand-by beer if your out and nothing else strikes your fancy. A solid, tasty beer."
"A staple of the Philly area, VHD is a common find and on average a very good beer overall. A reddish amber color with a nice white head, varying in size, but generally well-retaining and well-lacing. Fruity, happy hop nose with a well-defined bready malt base. Crisp bready malts in the taste, sweet, with an influx of citrus hops, grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest. Medium-bodied, well-balanced, a little bitter in the finish, but overall a fine quaff."
"O - Perhaps the bottle was not fresh, but this was a malt bomb for me. Very little hop presence and tons of sweet malt. Enjoyed Hop Wallop MUCH more."
"When i poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice amber color body with a 1"" creamy head on top. The smell is kinda weak, but the hop smell and malt comes through. The taste is outstanding, great hop flavor up front and linger through, and very nice spice taste also. Very crisp and smooth off the tongue. Overall this is a great beer."
"A good non threatening IPA here with just enough alcohol thats perfect for a lively weekend session. No mouth puckering bitterness and slap your face you fool alcohol numbness."
"Overall: Before food, this was fine..After food--just a big hoppy IBU monster. A must do for hopheads, but one I could not finish. I appreciate the veracity of the hops, but I wanted something just a bit less bitter."
"O: Very nice. 4"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the darker feel to the malts in the taste. This remained so without crossing over into the realm of the Black IPAs, which can have the malts overshadowing the necessary hoppy components themselves. This brew did exactly the opposite, in that all the flavors of the traditional IPA were retained, with big hops being showcased. Additionally, the aroma was clean throughout, and the tannin like slickness at the end helped to put this beer above the competition."
"O: I don't think this was as fresh as it could have been...the best drink date is several months away but this was mostly dominated by malts and not the hops I was lookign forward to. Will probably revisit this beer 6 months down the road."
"O: A great find at Mellow Mushroom, this beer kept me wanting more. If you like Hoppy beer, you will want to give this a try."
"Pours a beautiful yeasty-hazed amber into the glass with a thin head, retaining to the very last pull. Cascade hops and grapefruit to the nose. Nice deep hoppiness that leaves the mouth pleasantly satiated. Leaves a ""peppery"" good medium-lasting bitter finish. For an IPA, the hops are worked in nicely, and not overwhelmingly off-balance in any way. Nice job here. I wish it were a bit more complex in the taste dept., but it’s definitely a great brew."
"O: I can't imagine how many test batches they did to get this one just right, but I'll bet it was a lot. Nice IPA for sure!"
"O: A well-crafted brew, for sure. A solid middle of the road IPA that satisfies. Alcohol is completely hidden. A B+/A- in my book."
"Overall: While the flavors aren’t nearly robust enough to make a “devilish” hop profile, it is still an enjoyable beer. Alcohol content is a little high for sessioning…Ah well, what the heck, maybe this is the devilishness Victory is really talking about."
"This beer pours a cloudy rust color with no head or lacing. The aroma is of caramel and fruity hops. The flavor leads with caramel and citrus notes but is followed by nothing but overwhelming hop bitterness. It's got a thick mouthfeel and leaves a very bitter aftertaste that lasts way too long. Victory HopDevil is a pure hop bomb, it fits the style but the bitterness is over the top. Not recommended!"
"Pours a medium to dark amber shade with a nice sticky, white head. As the head dries out a foamy ring is left around the sides of the glass. Smells of bread, malt, caramel, and a hint of bitterness. Didn't catch much hop aroma as I would expect from an IPA. The taste is spot on for a good balanced IPA. Upfront you get a sweet malty taste that is balanced very well with a bitter backbone. Mouthful seems fine, good crisp finish and good carbonation. Overall a damn good beer. Great staple beer to keep in the fridge."
"Clear amber in color with about a fingers worth of foamy head that lasts. Nose is big. Toasty caramel malt sweetness and some grapefruit/orange hops. Flavor is smooth and creamy. Similar to the nose. Sweet and fruity. Sugary caramel malt and grapefruit with a bitter but smooth finish. The bitterness is smoothed out by such a big malty body and fruity aroma hops. I had to be careful with this one the other night. 6.7% and such a smooth body and fruity character it went down fast."
"Best before October something, tastes fresh to me out the fridge at the store. Color is a nice toasty copper color with a cream head. The smell is of resinous piney hops, and citrus (grapefruit/lemon) zest. Taste is a deep herbal citric twang with a resinous and gloriously bitter aftertaste, with some toasty malts. Wow, what a nice balance. Not too little, and not too much of anything. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost creamy, and compliments the wonderful hop nose and long puckering aftertaste. I think when fresh this is certainly one of the best American IPA's that money can buy. Another high quality beer from Victory brewing co. Hmm, what could be better, maybe Hopdevil on cask?!? Time to take a trip to PA."
"O: A classic American IPA; very flavorful; very drinkable; good stuff."
"Overall - This is a good IPA from Victory. Like I said, not quite my favorite IPA but one that I'd drink again if I had the chance."
"It's malty--feels like it, tastes like it, etc. It's just a disappointment--where are the yummy, citrusy hops to which I've become accustomed? This malt bomb is no hop devil! To hell with this devil!!"
"O: Fantastic IPA. I will not hesitate to order this at a bar or pick up a sixer."
"O - A sweet, hoppy ipa."
"With its American take on a British IPA, Hop Devil seems to be a rather polarizing beer with some people. Cask however is the way to go with this beer, as it really pops those hop flavors, helps smooth out the earthy and aggressive edges of the profile, and generally keeps that close to 7% ABV drinking rather nicely. A pint on cask here is just a given for me when it’s one."
"O: This is a great session IPA, and pretty widely available at east coast bars with is a plus. For sure an easy go to IPA."
"Maybe the best IPA on the East Coast. A Great beer thats widely available. A must try for any fan of craft beer."
"A solid East Coast IPA which, while maltier than I like, is still quite drinkable and a nice beer."
"O: Pretty much a malt bomb. Looking at the label I'm 3 weeks over the ""Enjoy By"" date. 7-14-11. Guess I need to get this one fresh and give it another try."
"UPDATE: Had this again on tap at Beer Revolution (OAK), and again it was a disappointment. Too much hype, not a tasty enough for me to ever recommend."
"It has a nice rusty orange color and a little 1/3 - 1/4 inch head. I'm picking up a lot of malt and spice in the nose but nothing hoppy or any of the citrus you would expect from an IPA. A very malt dominated beer with very little of the hop characteristics I expect from an American IPA. Its medium bodied and has a little sour and acid aftertaste. This is much closer to an old ale style or brown ale than anything else. For something called HopDevil Ale I’m very disappointed."
"O - Great American IPA. For all hop heads, no doubt."
"O: Not bad, but a bit of a disappointment. This is just too mellow, more of an APA than an IPA. As an APA, would probably give it all 4's. However, your mileage may vary, give it a try."
"overall: this is a great beer, expensive but worth it. Even on my limited college budget i would spend my well earned money on this beer, it is that good. what are u waiting for stop reading and go to the store haha."
"A very good beer from Victory. Was a bit skeptical at first try but wow I shouldn't have been. Pours a light orange amber color with two finger head that dissipates into a nice light head. Small lacing. Hints of grapefruit in the nose. Taste is hoppy and malty. Very good balance. Very good IPA."
"Light burn orange in color. Nice frothy head. Smells hoppy, smells of caramel, maybe a bit of grapefruit, and other citrus. Lots of hops on the tongue, a bit of citrus, all be it not that much. Myabe a bit of rye? Tastes sweet with no bitterness. Not a good finish. Taste just dies off. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated, awesome on a hot day. Not the best I've ever had by far, but very drinkable and a nice hoppy brew."
"Serving type: bottle (poured into glass)"
"D: Very Hoppy, yet balanced too. Big and robust. Great heft and feel with a nice level of complexity. This is a great IPA. Big and bad, but not overdone or overpowering. Nicely rounded and interesting."
"Highly drinkable and highly recommended. I only wish they had this on tap here my hometown. Great beer."
"O- A good IPA overall. Very easy to drink. Lots of balance here, if thats your thing. I prefer a hop forward IPA, so thats why I'm rating the otherwise solid brew down a couple notches. Everyone should try this beer."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pours a darker amber with a rich tan head. Scents of malt and floral fruits. Creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. Very balanced between hops and malts which give it a lovely finish. The mouthfeel was good and it was well-carbonated. Overall, it was a very fine effort."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice color tone, foamy head, carbonation, substantial lacing. Nose is a great combiation of malt and hops... a little uncharacteristic. Nicely thrown in there is an indistinct nutty or woody tone and a heavy floral character. Hops rule the day. It's bitter, piney, with some nut, butterscotch, and fresh flora. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall : this is a very pleasant beer easy to drink and refreshing very easy to drink. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a mild ipa"
"Best by date on newer pour indicates May 6, 2013. So it is well past that date. So much for the drink fresh mandate. This beer has been in a cooler in the dark for most of its life. Didn't hurt the flavor at all IMO. Still a very good IPA."
"O: Not bad. I'm just not terribly impressed. Quite drinkable."
"O: Overall, a decent, drinkable IPA. Nothing really good or bad about it. Probably wouldn't recommend, but I wouldn't advise you against it. Might have again."
"O - for a beer with a name like ""HopDevil"" I was expected a punch in the face from the hops, but I didn't get it. This is still a very good beer though. definitely fits the criteria for any hop head."
"gorgeous crystalline toffee color with 1/2 in. head, receding fast. aromatically challenged, wound up tight. fresh baked bread with concord grape jam, burnt popcorn, perfume counter at the mall on the nose. medium mouthfeel with disappearing to zero midpalate that transitions into short sappy bark plummy abrupt finish. big pazzz on this..."
"Overall I love this beer when fresh but only like it when its a little dated. I love a lot of Victory's beers and fresh Hop Devil is no exception. Newbies to the aggressive hop ales will probably not like this beer (imho) but I sure do."
"Still, a good and interesting take on a IPA, but in my opionion, not one to seek out."
"Taste is well-balanced with malts alongside the hops. It's a heavily-bodied ale, with a bitter hint at the finish. A lovely and well-rounded American IPA, and maybe better than Victory's Hop Wallop."
"Not my favorite IPA in terms of taste, but beautiful nonetheless. Although my bottle was still ""good"" (Exp. 8/29), I get the feeling this is one of those beers that really demands to be consumed ASAP; the flavors felt a little muddled, and I felt like the hops needed to stick out more... I don't know what it is about the mouthfeel, but it really struck me for some reason. Overall, a great brew from a brewery that I'll be sure to check out again soon."
"Overall this was a decent beer. It has a great piney hop flavor to it. The only reason this beer got marked down a little bit is it doesn't have the strong hop aroma you would expect from an IPA."
"Beautiful new- penny copper color, thin head, sticky lacing on my tasting snifter. Gorgeous. Fruity hop nose. Melon, citrus. Produce market. Yummy smell overall. Delicious, full maltiness, slightly sweet, very fruity, nice round hop bitterness. Dry finish. Good slightly sticky and bubbly refreshing mouthfeel. All around delicious. Solid 4.5 all around and overall. Victory is becoming one of my favorite brewers up there with Stone and Bells. Their beers never disappoint me."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Opaque amber body with 2 fingers of bubbly head - not much retention, or lacing. A nice balance in the nose, can pick up some citrus and floral notes as well as some malts. I get the citrus upfront, followed by a bit of malt balance and slightly bitter finish. Not picking up any of the floral though. Medium bodied and kinda creamy for the style. A solid all around IPA, especially when super fresh."
"Overall it is good, but forgettable in a sea of IPAs which exist in today's market. Good to find on tap amongst the other domestic swill my hotel had on tap."
"this is a good ipa. aggressive, but welcomed to those who can appreciate such a thing."
"Feels a little carbonated and a little oily. Not to bad, and is a nice alternative to Two Hearted (which is a great ale too)."
"I tried this beer on April 15, 2011 at ""The Beerbistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer pours a hazy golden orange with a 1/2"" creamy tan coloured head. The aroma was citrusy hops, pine, and some caramel malt. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, with medium carbonation. The flavour was grapefruit, orange, and caramel with a dry finish."
"This beer Pours and orangish color with a thick white head and good retention. The smell is citrusy grapefruit up from with some resinous pine notes as well. The flavor is pretty similar with citrus and pine notes as well as a nice hop bite. This beer is nice and dry and is one of my top 2 favorite ipas"
"O: A very enjoyable beer, lacking in hop flavours but I attribute that to its age..."
"overall I could definitely get this beer again. I'd like to try it in a bottle to see if there are any differences."
"Two finger head, Smell is hoppy, pine-like and not overwhelming. Taste is spicey, with hints of caramel. Full bodied and dry aftertaste. The hoppiness is very strong on the initial taste and there is no letting up from there on. I think the A+ given by ""The Bros"" is generous. The beer is very good but not A+ good."
"O: looks good, smells and taste are more like an amber or red ale to me. Can't say I really care for this one."
"O: If the other aspects of the beer were up to par with the alc. content and the mouthfeel, this beer would be an A+, however, since the mouthfeel is so exceptional I'd have to say this aint such a bad beer overall."
"Impressions: I’m just not impressed. I think this beer is unbalanced to a point where it can’t live up to its potential. As far as I’m concerned, I have to believe this is a work in progress, and that the brewers are still perfecting the formula. The hops are definitely in there, but they constantly have to fight to be noticed. Yes I would buy it again. Yes I would enjoy it. But I still think something is keeping this beer from living up to its true potential. Maybe it was nearing its end of life... it only has two more days left on its Best By date."
"An intense hit of hops - hardly anything brewed in the UK can provide such a sensation. Impressive, with stacks of character. Due to the age of the bottle I wonder if some of the hoppy notes have faded away (esp. citrus), but the bitterness is still overwhelming. Fantastic, and well worth sampling."
"Worth checking out."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and oily slick with medium carbonation, a medium body and an overall feel that is hoppy with some alcohol bite. A really nice beer, that's fruity, hoppy and really easy to drink for an IPA. High drinkability for a beer of this caliber, this is a high recommendation."
"This is one damn fine beer. My only complaint is that I didn't buy more of them on my last trip to the store."
"Overall I really enjoyed this IPA and would definitely go for it again."
"Overall - Not bad, not great. Hardly this side of good, really. I'd drink it if nothing else were available."
"O - The nose doesn't do the rest of the beer justice. Overall, its a pleasant IPA that I can see myself enjoying again in the future."
"Overall it's ok but not great. Pretty average unless you just like straight hops flavour with no complexities or malt backbone."
"O - Definitely give this beer a shot if you love hops, it will give you a pretty unique experience with some of the spiciness that it brings to the palate. I would buy this every now and then and break them out to two beers per time that I drank; this is definitely not meant to be put back all night (especially at 6.7% ABV)."
"O: A very nice IPA offering from Victory, but within the freshness code, the hops have lost a touch of there flavor. I can recall having this brew and noting that the hops had a more active roll in the overall taste. None the less, a solid brew."
"Hop Devil pours out a golden copper color with a decent foamy white head on it. The head gives off a good lacing down the glass that sticks for just about the entire time you have it. The smell has a wonderful aroma of hops spewing from it. The taste of the beer has an interesting spicy hoppiness to it. There is a light maltiness in the flavor as well but mostly a very strong hop flavor throughout. The mouthfeel was is medium bodied and has a nice stinging on the tongue from the carbonation and hops. Overall it's an impressive IPA and really worth looking into."
" This is a far more than solid craft beer here. It features the typically hoppy bitterness and a citrus grapefruit tinge as well. But adding to that, I sense a certain heavier ""spiciness"" of some sort that I've just never placed in a previously sampled India Pale Ale. What that spiciness is, I just can't put my finger on it, at least not just yet. Maybe it's only my imagination but I get the impression that it's a unique style of IPA, almost like a ""winter warmer"" with its spiciness."
"O: This is a good East Coast IPA but it doesn't distance itself from other IPA choices."
"Overall Drinkability - Smooth session IPA. Enjoyable but didn't wow me like I thought it would based on the average rating."
"Bright reddish copper, quite clear with a big white head which laces a lot. The smell is of rich hoppiness. The majority coming through as citrusy grapefruit along with a touch of pine and floral characteristic in there as well. The taste matches the smell with a ton of bright hops coming through with flavors ranging from citrus to pine and floral. Despite the hop centric focus this beer is amazingly well balanced. The hops are backed by a solid maltiness with enough sweetness to match the high IBUs. Body is medium to full with a dry bitter finish that lasts. Overall a very good IPA, one I'd passed over in the past. I guess I didn't know what I was missing."
"This will do in a pinch it's quite tasty and I never seem to complain if there is any to go around. Seems like now was a good time to giving it some thought."
"Overall. Nice ips. Good tasting malt is stronger than I usually like, but I really enjoy this one."
"Shouts to SpinRSX for all his instruction and wisdom sharing!"
"O- Strangely, I am really enjoying this beer, just not as an IPA. Has characteristics of amber ale and pale ales from Europe. I opened this Expecting an IPA and am disappointed by what I got. I will, though, try more of Victory's beers."
"Overall: This is an awesome beer. You can chew the hops."
"Pours an amber color with a fairly good sized head. Smells very floral, a little bit of pine, and it's very clear from both the look and the smell that it has a decent malt backbone to it. The taste has a fairly strong bitterness to it which is balanced with a caramel finish. It's a nice, balanced IPA. Not really my favorite, but I also don't think it was as fresh as I'd like. Too much malt for me, not sure if that was due to the hops fading or not."
"O: Not bad. I don't think this is anywhere near the beer people make it out to be, but it's a decent IPA."
"Overall: Go get this one! Prosit!!"
"D- 4 Overall a good, solid IPA, Hop Devil is certainly drinkable. It is a tad more bitter and dry on the finish than I'd ultimately prefer, and thus I could see myself enjoying 2-3 of them in a sitting. Definitely a brew worth trying for IPA fans."
"O - This has great drinkability. I really think it is a great example of an American IPA. I could easily drink a bunch of these, I'm on my third glass as I write this. Overall, I thought this was an awesome beer, and I will definitely drink it again. I recommend trying it if you haven't."
"Nice with spicy food. Or a sox/yankees game. Start with something less hoppy and ease into this one =)"
"Overall, this goes down extremely easy. This is a classic IPA that I revisit frequently."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it's a pretty solid beer with a bold bitter, hop profile to it. Very drinkable and flavorful beer."
"This is a great balanced IPA that I don't feel like I have to concentrate on to enjoy. No feature overpowers the other leaving a very easy to drink beer that doesn't leave you wanting. A beautifully crafted favorite."
"Overall: A solid IPA but frankly, I expected more. I understand this is a matter of personal preference, but I just don't like such a strong malt presence in IPAs. I also have some Hop Wallop I'm waiting to try, I hope the malt there is more toned down than this."
"Mouthfeel is dry and light, not sticky at all. Overall, very good beer."
"Light/medium body with appropriate carbonation to match the malt. Overall a solid IPA and very balanced. Try it if you can get it."
"O: This is a fine IPA that I would drink any time, even though it's not exactly my favorite example of the style. It does what it intends and does it very well."
"O - One of the best American IPA's I've ever had.... if not one of the best beers I've ever had. Well balanced and delicious. At the end of the day... it comes down to ""do I enjoy drinking this beer?""... and this one... is a the top of my must have list."
"O: A decent IPA. It is both fruity sweet and hoppy bitter. Fairly drinkable save for the bitter aftertaste."
"Hop Devil is a well conceived and a delicious IPA that I return to quite often, particularly when I'm looking for a great caramel taste. I feel fortunate to have the Victory products available here in Georgia."
"O: A great IPA."
"An excellent session, everyday IPA. Pretty balanced and on the sweet side of things. Good value."
"Overall: Stan recommends."
"A truly delicious IPA. The reason I've liked IPAs for 7 years."
"This isn't my favorite IPA. It's a little uneven, and bites in an unpleasant way. But, it's hoppy, which I love and would definitely recommend it to any hophead out there."
"Enjoy by June 2011 on the bottle"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Medium bodied and easy to drink. Delicious all throughout and it kept me entertained. I know this is a short review, but I liked the beer quite a bit."
"Overall a pretty good ipa, but not overwhelmingly hoppy. The bitter could be upped and the flavor could be prolonged both in the middle and back end. As far as drinkability, this beer gets an A."
"Overall: One of my favorite IPAs right now."
"O: Probably one of, if not -the- best ""single"" IPA I've had yet. Incredibly flavorful and perfectly balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Incredibly drinkable and exceptionally well-crafted."
"This is a beer that could get me in a lot of trouble if I let it. Just one more reason why I think Victory has the best lineup from top to bottom."
"Bought a 6 pack at the cork and cap in fot wayne IN i thought it was kind of expensive. wouldnt try it again."
"Pretty serious IPA. Very enjoyable."
"O: One of the better Pa IPAs. Bitterness hides the ABV quite nicely. This is a session beer for me."
"O: This is my go-to beer. I drink more of this than anything else. In my opinion, its the best readily available beer at a decent price where I live (central PA) and I think everything about it rocks. Great taste, great aromas (when Pabst aren't killing your senses), and a great value. Hell, even the devil with a hop for a head looks righteously awesome."
"Drinkability: Sensational, this beer excels in it's ability to be consumed. A beer that could be had any time of the day, any day of the year, a great offering from Victory."
"O: The strong malt profile of this beer mixed with the grassy hops makes for an interesting take on the IPA. For me it was too sweet and the mix of grassy bitterness was not too enjoyable. But for those that like malt or ambers, this might be your beer."
"Overall, a middle of the road offering. There are many better IPAs that are easily accessible."
"This beer is rather straight-forward and doesn't leave much complexity to be disected. Instead, it excels in drinkability with a decent bitterness that isn't overly strong. Definitely a good bitter for accompanying a meal (for those that like an IPA for lunch/dinner)."
"pours a pretty amber, with almost no head. the smell is my favorite thing about this beer. hoppy/herbal sweet-citrus, tea and grass. smells great, no joke. now, i'm not sure why i'm not as into this as much as other beer heads. maybe cause of how wet it tastes, it has a syrupy mouth feel after sips, i don't really dig that. i like the first hit of hops, but i like my ipas dry. this one ends so wet and malty. also the fatty mid-pallet, (i feel), gets drowned out with the sour syrupy finish."
"I'm glad they decided to pick this beer to have the different malt backing to balance the hops out. This malts remind me of a lighter Yakima Glory so that the hops shine through more. It's actually an interesting take on an IPA because of that burnt, roasted caramel malt taste that goes along with the whole flowers they use. I love that they use whole flowers in their beer it gives all of them a distinct Victory taste... this one being one of their very best. Another A plus for Victory."
"Man, I need to find some of this fresh. Granted, it is only a couple months old, but I think the hop flavor would be far more satisfying with a fresh bottle. That said, I still really enjoyed Victory's HopDevil. Some nice, clean flavors and a decent finish makes for a damn fine IPA."
"D/O - It's a nice balanced session sort of beer. It's not too hoppy but not too malty. It's a great craft beer choice to session on."
"This bottle is dated ""Enjoy by 05/23/11"" So it's probably fairly fresh. I don't know when it was bottled but I wouldn't push this one to the end. It is not the huge hop punch that I like, but I do think this one is worthy of a try, and would be happy for another. Thanks to turfy for this one. Recommended!!"
"March2011 I need to update this score. After going through many more beers, this has ended up one of my top beers. It is a well balanced beer. Creamy, malty, sweet and hoppy. A++"
"Overall a very solid IPA - should be a relative staple."
"Overall-One of my absolute favorite beers right now. I brought some to a party for me and a friend to enjoy, and it was highly entertaining. Lots of character to this beer."
"O - Such a wonderful and unique example of an American IPA, I'm glad this is as good as I remember!"
"Overall, it feels pleasant on the palate, and the carbonation is just enough to compliment the flavors and bring them out. Victory keeps impressing me, and those who enjoy that level of bitterness between IPAs and DIPAs will enjoy this a lot. It would also be a great transition to those who are timid to enter a world of bitter hops in well crafted American IPAs. Cheers!"
"BOW DOWN TO THE HOP DEVIL!!"
"Finish: Hop blanket the cheeks, malty sweetness is still present"
"Overall, probably not what you would expect if you have tried Victory's Hop Wallop. Still very enjoyable and worth getting in a sixer. Still, I found the hop profile to be rather underwhelming given that the beer is named HOP Devil. A bit misleading for what you actually get."
"Overall I liked this beer. I found it even more hop forward than my current favorite DIPA Mojo Risin. Well done victory!"
"Overall: A balanced beer with some good hoppy bitterness involved. The bitter overpowers the beer a little but still overall well balanced. Not too heavy. Nice IPA to sit back and watch tourny basketball"
"D- Its a strong IPA but pretty fairly decent on the drinkability."
"bank on it - the more a brewery brags about hoppiness with a beer's name, the more underwhelming the actual hop profile will be."
"Poured good with moderate head, poor lacing. Color is amber with decent carb. Smells very mildly of hops, I must say that for a beer called hop devil I expected more hops in the aroma. slight solvent aromas as well. Tasted okay with good bittering additions yet slightly unbalanced towards the bitter end. Usually I go for bitter IPAs but this had little to no aroma to go with it so it was a bit un-enjoyable. Was not a bad brew by any means, but I wouldn't purchase it again"
"Superb beer."
"Drinkability: Lighter than expected and very well balanced. Easy to drink."
"Where else can you get a Victory Hopdevil Poured to you in a fresh plastic cup other than Reed's nightclub in Blue Bell, PA. I've had this beer many a times before but this review comes on the most recent indulgence at a local wateringhole/night club. The beer was a happy hour brew on draught poured into a plastic cup. Here the beer was a dark brown color with moderate. This beer was delicious as always. With German imported Malts this weights in at a 6.7% ABV. The first time I had this beer was at the Las Vegas Lounge in Philly. I was working as a File Clerk in Philly at the time and Victory was much less known in 2006. The beer still remains delicious and is still one of the best in the game. I'm not a huge hope head, but this beer breaks the mold and transcends all bounds for those that love extra hoppy and those that don't."
"D- I have become a fan of this from Victory. This a very drinkable IPA. Drinks like an 'all-purpose' IPA, but there's just more to this one. A good beer to frequently reach for."
"This certainly not a hoppy IPA, but the taste is nice and it is extremely drinkable. There is some slight bitterness and hints of earthy hops, but the malt shine through. This is a balanced IPA, but I prefer my IPAs to be unbalanced with a massive amount of hops."
"Mouthfeel is very good, with the beer flowing easily and staying crisp and refreshing the whole way through. The drinkability is helped by the dry nature of the finish, but hurt by the lack of balance in the beer. Abv of 6.7% is respectable for the strength of flavors in the beer, but in this case I think those flavors just aren't compatible with my palate."
"D: Will probably find myself picking this one up again in the future, even if I'm not a huge fan of it. Easy enough to drink, with props to the mouthfeel making this one go down faster than the taste alone would cause."
"D- Solid overall. These always go down quite easily. I'd have no problem tossing back several of these at a time (trust me, I have)."
"D - I prefer a little more body and smoothness of my IPA, but certainly a better than average one. I would keep this is my fridge for an all-purpose beer."
"Pours dark peach with one finger of foamy head that doesn't last too long, but there is some lacing left behind. Fist thing I notice is the graininess in the nose, along with some some dark sweet smells. The taste is heavier on the malt than hops, but this beer also has a nice bitter bite to it. For the heavy malt variety of IPA (as opposed to citrusy), this is excellent. The taste is better than the smell. Medium bodied, give me another."
"Had it in a glass..."
"D - Overall a very solid take on the style by Victory. I would recommend this to other IPA fans."
"The CPJ"
"While this is not a beer for those new to hoppy beers, it is one that any IPA lover should give a shot, especially if they enjoy the dogfish head and sierra nevada torpedo hop profiles."
"I feel like I am being a wuss. I love bitter IPAs, but I am really just not loving the way in which HopDevil is bitter. That is, the finish is so earthy, grassy, resiny, and metallic that I don't love how the bitter flavor compares to bitter flavors of other IPAs. If this had just a little more malt balance and a little more of a citrus presence, I would like HopDevil considerably more."
"D - Drink this beer. I always wondered if this beer was really as good as all the hype claimed. I have to say that although the hype is really high, there is a reason for it, and this is a very well executed IPA."
"Notes: This beer works a nice balancing act with supportive malt sweetness and hop flavor/bitterness. Very well done!!!"
"Awesome for the style. On the dry end of a hoppy beer. Enjoyable. Easy to drink. Not my favorite of the style."
"The taste is quite smooth also, nothing popping to hard. Good hops immediately, with nice caramel undertones. A little piney twang as well."
"Overall: Very good beer and at a very reasonable price for the amount of hops flavor. Definitely one for IPA/hop lovers to try. Also pairs well with snacks (chips and peanuts)."
"I was not really sure how to rate HopDevil since this is from a growled of cask beer, but I think this beer is more representative of the beer on cask. I don't know how many tmrw I've had hopdevil, but each for some reason I get surprised by how good it is compared to the big west coast IPAs I've been drinking. The beer is definitely redder than most Ca IPAs meaning it has more caramel and toasty malt flavors. The hops though really sing, they have a rich woody and earthy edge, probably from the cask dry hopping, and it is just a strong manly flavor. If they made a cologne from this beers bouquet I would buy it. It has the citrus peel, freah cut grass, and damp oak leaf thing going one. The malt sweetness and crackery toast provide the perfect counter balance to the beer. Even though the beer was definitely undercarbed it still had great texture and wasn't the least bit syrupy. Really great"
"D- This I would have to say is the most well balanced American IPA I've had. It is extemely drinkable due to the fact that the malt lingers with the hops at the end...no cotton mouth here. Some other brewers should take notes, outstanding."
"Two finger deep off-white head w/ nice retention, very nice. The Base of the beer is a strong amber color. Fresh Bread and nutty oils on the smell. Nice balance between hops and malt on the mouth. Taste is ver similar to the smell. This brew reminds me a bit of a more drinkable version of DFH 90. Overall, I like this brew and will seek it out again. By no means blowing me a away, but solid..."
"Overall impression: Not bad, but not memorable."
"Overall: The beer is very good. The nice sweet flavor up front really balances well with the beer's strong hop flavor. If you're a hop-head, I highly recommend trying this one - You won't be disappointed."
"It's not as bold as I was hoping for something called HopDevil, but I'm still a fan."
"d-dangerously so....don't walk after having about six of these...LOL"
"Overall, it was a pretty decent IPA, but I felt like something was missing. In a way it was a little weak for my tastes. Again, a good beer, just not fantastic."
"Pours a medium copper color w/ a one finger white head. The head quickly goes down to a sliver. The smell is that of hops, w/ a little malt.. Also getting a little citrus smell as well, maybe lemon peel? The taste of this beer does the name proud. Massive hop flavor, but also a pretty good malt presence as well. Great lacing on the glass, one of the better I've seen. Very dry finish on this beer, and the aftertaste doesn't last a real long time. This is a solid beer. Maybe not my favorite IPA, but I would probably pick this one up again."
"Very easy to drink. I could easily drink a number of these in the course of a night. Solid offering."
"This beer really hit the spot!"
"Pours a clear brownish copper color with a half inch of off white head that lasts a while. Leaves a small amount of lacing that dissipates quickly. Good creamy and hop flavor. Citrus tones and flavors aren't overpowering and are well balanced. Doesn't have a heavy body, with medium carbonation and has a very smooth finish. Very drinkable IPA."
"Crisp and refreshing, light in body, very drinkable I could easily have 3-5 in a night and not think much of it. Really tasty and an extremely solid beer."
"Pours a clear dark golden amber with a three finger off white foamy head. Nose is plentiful hops; citrus, grapefruit, floral auroma. Taste is bitter on the palate, caramel malts balance out the now piney tasting hops. Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel. An easy drinking IPA deserving of a visit."
"D- Not bad. I would not go out of my way for it, but considering it is available everywhere here in Florida and Victory is usually pretty solid, I would pick it up again. But for $11 a sicer I would probably get a Jai Alai since it is the loacl brew."
"poured an amberish orange with yellow highlights and had a half finger of bubbly head leaving a little lacing sticking to the glass. the aroma did have some good hoppy piney notes alongside caramel, sweetness from the malts and hints of citrus. the hop profile was much better on the palate with citrus caramel accents but had piney grassy notes and a touch of tangerine. the brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, piney, mild hoppy finish. drank really good and enjoyed paired with some BBQ chicken while watching the steelers get the their ass's handed to them in the super bowl."
"D: All-night drinker and definitely the beer's greatest attribute. The light, yet noticeable hop makes for a tasty beer that you can post up on all night."
"D- could def drink a decent amount easily. Very refreshing and a bitterness that makes you want to drink more and more."
"D - Very high. It is so smooth!"
"Nice IPA effort from Victory. Seems to be a standard east coast style: high on the hops with little citrus goodness."
"This does not classify as world-class or excellent but like I mentioned, is perfectly refreshing and nice and I'd drink it again."
"D - Eh, overrated. Mouthfeel was big letdown after a pretty nice smell and well-balanced taste."
"D: a solid hoppy brew with a great sweet aspect for balance. nice."
"A superbly drinkable beer, one of my favorites all time."
"My full review is here: http://whatareyoudrinking.net/2010/11/where-are-you-drinking-in-new-york-the-long-room-irish-pub/"
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours amber-gold, with rosy highlights. The beer has a thick, foamy cream head that sustains while drinking. Smells of cream and hops, smoke and toffee. Taste is slightly sour, with sweet malty overtones. The beer has dominant hoppy notes, and some peppery characteristics. The spice is present in the aftertaste, and the finish is smooth and creamy. Light hops are consistent throughout the beer, helping to balance the other flavors. Smooth and easy to drink, and the low ABV allows for multiple follow-ups without doing too much damage."
"The smell is difficult for me....it smelled well....pukey. The Devil come strong with the hop and then leaves the palate dry and with a sour finish. The alcohol content with the hops makes it bitter, but not to bitter for this guy. It would be a tough session beer, but if on a dare I would go for it!"
"D/M: medium carbonation, smooth drinking, sits a little heavy, lingering taste on the palate is not the best"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass and sometimes from tap. Pours a cloudy copper with a creamy beige head, low carbonation. Shows creamy body, mellow hops, a wonderful lasting hop finish. Picking up some grapefruit, lemon seed and quite floral in the aroma. Rich malts tie it together. Good balance for an IPA."
"The balanced taste with a smooth initial taste and pleasant aftertaste along with a not-so heavy body makes me love drinking this beer. One of my favorite hoppy brews for drinkability."
"Drinkability- very drinkable. Well made ipa"
"D- Very good balanced IPA."
"Verdict: No doubt a wonderful IPA, especially when it rears its head in a common grocer store, it's a no doubt take home winner; A wonder to behold and consume. Worthy for anybody who drinks beer both as a habit and as a hobby. I'd go for at least a sixer; you won't regret the purchase. A (4.35)"
"D - Slightly disappointing, but very tasty and drinkable overall. I remember it being far far better on draft, so perhaps the bottle is a bit old and out of its prime."
"A lot of IPA's try to distinguish themselves, Don't expect this one to stray from the good 'ole harsh bitterness and ever lasting hop aroma. Good beer for a dry mouth on either a cool night or an afternoon of football. Not as drinkable as some IPA's but the Hopdevil definitely doesn't disappoint the hop heads."
"D: It's a well put together IPA but nothing puts it over the top of makes it stand out. With all the other choices in this category, I'm not upset to see it or drink it again but it won't make the rotation for a little while."
"D: I could drink this thing as fast as a glass of water, but it's something you want to savor. This is an IPA done right, take the time and enjoy, but it sure isn't a sipper."
"D - A pretty easy to drink beer, but that being said it is a little light on the hop florals for my liking."
"Overall: This came as a recommendation from a friend when I told him I was picking up some Prima Pils. I want to enjoy Victory's offerings, as it is a relatively local brewery, but I seem to have a hard time finding really fresh tasting examples."
"Summary: Will definitely drink again."
"Pours a dark, dark amber, slightly cloudy. A tannish head dissipates quickly. Carb trailer bubbles are slow and tiny. Smell is resinous, and a bit chemical/solvent-like. Taste starts off with a hint of malt sweetness, but then the feeling delves right into assertive hops. Some of grapefruit, some of pine, some that should probably have an MSDS tag on them. A lot of spice on the backend, with a bitter, spiky aftertaste that last for a while. In my eyes, this is a menacing IPA indeed. Good."
"I had this beer many moons ago and enjoyed it much. I recently bought it again due to slim selection. This beer is not what it used to be. I am seeing more and more that companies that have had a good history of serving up great beers are falling short more and more. I guess nothing is sacred anymore, even good beer in the current world of greed and corner cutting. Thanks alot Victory. Count me out."
"d: this stuff goes down very quickly. i'm sure i could drink more of it than i should."
"This is a nice beer; fairly tame by today's IPA standards but well-done."
"There's a clean and crisp finish that has little to no burn."
"Hop Devil has a great amber color with decent depth, just slightly hazed. Creamy, looser head with a nice off-tan/white hue, decent lacing. Great looking IPA. Smell is a powerfully juicy citrus hop aroma with a solid caramel, sugary sweet malt. Wonderful aroma. Taste is classic IPA, with a moving hops complexity. Again, good balance (for an IPA), interplay with the richer malts. Quite aggressively hopped. Feel is rough, a little too much ""buzzsaw"" feel with the hoppiness. Appropriate thickness, but the alpha oil burn is distracting and just a bit uncomfortable. Drinkability remains good, from the aroma alone. A solid East Coast IPA, another solid brew from Victory. Nice work!"
"D: Good IPA, not sure if it was the freshest bottle, but still good. I think I would get this again but I definitely wont be running around looking for it. I might get some more if I find it fresher to double check."
"D: Maybe not quite as good as I had remembered it being a couple years ago, but still a pretty good and readily available IPA from Victory."
"d 3-3.5-4 not much to my liking despite some redeeming qualities. really expected to enjoy this one much more, but am willing to try another specimen on another day. did improve a bit toward the end of the glass, enough to up some scoring."
"Poured an amber-reddish body with a two finger head which slowly dissipates to a thin layer of foam. Smells of cone hops-slightly cedarish with hints of nuts and citrus. Tastes wonderful-unlike other IPA's which simply try to blow you away with hops, this IPA has a strong hop presence but enough malt backbone sweetness to compliment the hoppy bitterness. Overall an excellent brew and quite possibly my favorite IPA."
"Drinkability: With a good taste and mouthfeel this is a beer that I can drink over and over."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Could have a few of these very easily."
"-i have always enjoyed this beer. i like the pinier style hops a good amount. a nice change of pace IPA. would and have bought repeat 6ers before which says something"
"---catching up posting reviews I'd written..."
"Conclusion: I would buy this again. I didn't think this was as hop intensive as other AIPA's I've had, but still it think it could satisfy someone with a hops craving. In the widely available craft beer category, I would say this is a solid purchase."
"Overall: a very good beer for you to get a hop fix. the only bad thing is the oily hop flavor seems to coat a little too well to after a couple sips you can't appreciate all the flavors. Instead of the up front sweetness it just tastes sort of watery until a new wave of hop flavors come roaring in. Still a good beer considering that though."
"Mouthfeel is nice but a little big to crush more that 2 or 3."
"Taken in july 2010 in a tonic glass victoria. Look: Amber opaque dead color, fat yellow head, excellent lacing. Smell: Blend of earth hops and cookie malts. Taste: Earth, pine, wood, floral and probably spicy hops with scents to ashes and snuff. Mouthfeel: Clean, extra body and very bitter, the bitterness is like a bomb on the palate, creamy body with high carbonation, a victory for the drinker."
"All in all, a solid ale from Victory Brewing."
"It's more like an Amber Ale than IPA, otherwise it's pretty good brew."
"Drinkability: Was a little nervous at first, I like strong Ales but the initial bitterness usually gets to me, until I have a few more drinks. I was expecting a strong/heavy/hoppy Ale but was pleasantly suprised at how smooth it turned out. I will definitely have another."
"Pours an orange red color with a medium sized white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of pine and some citrus and some actual hop bitterness. Tastes very well balanced. Citrusy hops up front and they dominate most of the experience. Some malts and some citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Fairly easy to drink."
"overall, great IPA, i would buy this again...it was smooth and a delicious beer, no complaints"
"D"
"Served on tap while waiting for my plane at the Philly airport. Served in an imperial pilsner glass, a dark amber orange color with a foamy white one finger head that fades to a collar with good lacing. Smell is not as hoppy as I would have imagined. Some pine, lots of malt body but not too sweet. Taste is earthy and spicy hops, some pine, malt flavor is subdued, finish is very bitter. Maybe this is an old keg but I would like to see a little more hop flavor. Medium bodied with a bit too high medium carbonation, finish is pretty clean. An ok beer, but not my favorite IPA by any means."
"12oz bottle. Enjoy by Date of Jan 4 2011. Pours a murky amber color with virtually no head. Some lacing. Sweet aroma of piney hops. Flavor is just like the aroma. Piney hops but not as sweet as I thought it would be. Slight bitter aftertaste. A bit thin of a mouthfeel but certainly a drinkable IPA. Pretty good."
"Nicely hoppy and not overly sweet, although the pine on the finish has a slight astringency that gives an overall impression of detergent at times. However, it's not enough to keep this brew from being quite drinkable, if not exceptional."
"D - Excellent beer, not very sessionable though."
"Note After Review - I just looked at the date, it is past its ""drink by"" date. I do not know if this contributed to my dissatisfaction, but I will keep an eye out and edit this review if my opinion changes."
"Drink - A good that I'll be happy to have again. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this is a highly drinkable beer. It's really tasty and worth seeking out."
"Overall, this brew is worthy of a try but I wouldn't go above and beyond to acquire it. With a name like ""Hop Devil," I expected something with more hops. Hop Devil is more of a malty IPA. The only other IPA (Well, its a double IPA) I had from Victory was the ""Hop Wallop"" and that brew was great, IMO. I was kind of holding this to that first impression I had of Victory."
"Nice clear deep orange color. Not really any head at pour, thin ring around edge of glass. Very citrusy hoppy aroma, sweet orange/tangerine. Some light malt character in aroma. Smells like there might be a very very faint spicey note in aroma. As beer warms, aroma becomes more tropical. Good carbonation; Crisp mouthfeel and haldway through the glass can swirl and get a 1/2 off-white head. Slightly spicey middle, darker sweetness on the beginning, still cirtusy though. Floral end with a grassy finish. With warmth end seems to have a banana hint to hit Hoppy Dry finish, feels like thin silkiness that lasts. With warmth, dryness on finish becomes less strong and even more smooth. Overall on the medium to darker side of an ipa than lighter."
"D - pretty solid east coast IPA with a nice malt profile. Not uberly complex, but pretty tasty nonetheless. If hops intimidate you, I would highly recommend this as an entry into the IPA realm."
"Pours crystal clear amber-orange, thick head that quickly fades to thin lacing. Smells of sweet tangerines, malt and melons. Taste is fruity up front, nice bouquet, caramel malt is quiet in the back, balanced bitterness, medium light mouthfeel with high carbonation makes this an easy drinker!"
"D. Delicious and refreshing...I must have more!"
"d - one of the hoppiest AIPAs i've had and it's still one of the most drinkable."
"12oz (355ml) bottle purchased from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours a deep copper orange with a thick ring of cream white head and strands of stringy lacing on the tulip. Smell is sweaty and doughy yeast (similar to the Prima Pils), barley, blood orange, red grapefruit, floral notes, taffy, and a small hint of lime. Some unusual aromas for an IPA but enticing nonetheless. Flavour is pine, caramel, slight woodiness, spicy and grassy hops, firm malt sweetness, bitter and citric finish, somewhat astringent. IBUs are apparent on the palate. Mouthfeel is prickly spiciness upfront, medium body, crisp carbonated bite with a juicy and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. A solid candidate for a session, even if it's not the most intricate example of the style. I would grab this again."
"Drink- Pretty good. I like the spice notes. It was a nice smooth drinking IPA."
"D- overall it's a pretty solid brew, if not necessarily one of the best- i may be a slave to west coast ipa's but this one is still very enjoyable and worth adding to any sixer"
"I would recommend this and will be on the look out for another one."
"Pours a cloudy, copper color with a very thin head. The nose is strong on flowery hops and a delightful pine scent. The taste was a mellow version of Hop Devil. It's as is being in the cask took the rough edges of Hop Devil and sanded them down to a wonderfully smooth taste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a slightly less than normal level of carbonation. This was a real beauty of a pour, I could have sat at the bar all day if only I could have gotten out of life's obligations."
"It's one of the best IPA's out there and one of my favorites. I'm lucking to have this brewed in my home state."
"Drinkability: If it is hops you seek, then look no further. Hides the ABV really well and is a great representation of the style."
"D: A fairly balanced to malt forward IPA. For those of you who like that, this one's for you. For those like me who like the enamel stripped from their teeth and despise balance, pick something else."
"Smell & taste is pronounced hop, citrus, bitterness; but not overly done. Mouthfeel was good, not too dry. I assume this is a nice example, a nice step up to your first IPA. I really enjoyed this one, but I drank this one starting from 50°, it could have used a bit more freshness... my mistake. Certainly gives me a longing for some of the other IPA's I have in my fridge, which are supposed to be even better..."
"D- Overall a good IPA. I prefer their hoppier relatives with the D prefix, but this is acceptable. Definitely drinkable too, can't taste the alcohol. Only thing with this style is it doesn't mix well with others as it will conquer your palatte. But if your in the mood for hops, a good choice."
"D-somehow this beer just tastes better the more you drink. its just beautiful. i could drink enormous amounts of this. i look forward to having another!"
"Would buy again, but wouldn't go out of my way to search for it."
"Drinkability is fantastic. ABV is no joke, but the flavor is good, and you'll thirst of this one."
"Victory Hopdevil is one of the best Ipa's I have tried in a long time. Its appearance was very orangey with a great look to a beer drinkers eye. The smell of the beer was wonderful, with a rich smell of lots hops. The first taste of this beer was awesome, great rich flavor with great hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability is something that I take into great consideration with this beer, it was a wonderful feeling at first taste and definitely a beer that I will drink in the future."
"d- glad i invested in a 6 pack. great for a warmer day. highly sessionable. good choice for a go-to brew that you can always have in the fridge. however, if choosing between hop wallop and hopdevil, go with the former."
"Would seek this out again but I'm gonna try out some others before doing so."
"D: this made me a little sick. It's got a bitter finish that I just can't shake."
"D - Very good and enjoyable IPA. Definitely try to get it draught instead of bottle. Heard that draught is a lot better."
"Medium bodied, higher on the carbonation, and a little dry. Easy drinking, quality flavor profile, and the alcohol is masked well. A pretty solid beer from Victory, but there's some better IPAs around for sure."
"D - All in all, this was surprisingly better than I expected. Not something I'll go out of my way to buy, but definitely worth a try. Masks the alcohol very well, so highly drinkable. Finished my bottle in no time."
"Hop Devil pours a dark copper color and has a strong scent of hops. There is a very strong robust flavor to this ale as well as a fairly bitter taste. Fairly nice to try but not something I will be able to drink 2 in a row of. An entree of a steak would pair very nicely with this beer."
"Solid IPA leaning more toward the hoppy side vs. the malty side. Enjoyed enough to order a second one at the restaurant. IPA lovers should give this a try."
"d- it's a delicious beer for sure, one of the better ones i've had, must have for ipa fans"
"I would have more than one of these in a row. Very satisfying and the somewhat high ABV is well disguised by the thick malty character and the high hop presence."
"This really wasn't an awful beer but like so many of this style it seems to have lost touch with what a beer really is, a malt beverage, hops should be used mainly for the preservative qualities and complement the malts. I guess I'll never understand the whole IPA hype."
"My verdict on this one is that this is a very drinkable IPA, and one that would placate both hopheads and those who would like some malt balance in an IPA."
"this is my favorite American IPA its bitter but its a really smooth bitter and very tasty"
"D-This went down easily enough, but this is not close to what I prefer in an IPA. Perhaps this is more East Coast in style. If so, I definitely favor the West Coast interpretation. Taste improves as it warms."
"Pours a nice copper color with an off white head and some lace rings as it goes down. Nose brings a good amount of pine and floral notes as well as a bit of citrus. Taste adds some caramel but is mostly pine and floral hops without too much bitterness. Medium body and slightly dry. The first few times I had this I was not a huge fan but it has really grown on me over time."
"D:This is a all right brew, the spiciness kinda of threw me off of it thou. I not really a big spicy fan so this one did not sit to well for me, but if you like that kind of action I would say you should seek this one out"
"a nice sessionable ipa with big hops, big flavors, and a delicious light malt balance. ill be sure to meet up with this again."
"D: Not sure I will be having more than one or two outta this sixer."
"If hops is what you seek, you will find it in Hopdevil. I would recommend you try as many IPA's as possible before trying this one. Because after you drink this you'll compare the hop content of every IPA, as most everything else you'll think is ""light on the hops""."
"I have had this beer numerous times and don't remember it being this bitter, but this was also the first time I have sat down in a controlled environment to drink and rate the beer."
"Pours a nice stable one and a half finger, white head which slowly fades to a solid cap that sticks to the edge if the glass to the end. It has a nice clear dark orange/red color. Smells very faintly of citrus hops and mildly sweet. Tastes of sweet with a citrus twinge, that finishes medium dry. Then some sort of funny after taste comes on, can't figure this one out. Not very drinkable for me. I didn't finish it. But I did like the "" drink by ######"" on the bottle."
"Very solid IPA--cheers!"
"They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from beer's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted palate was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his results. And yet there was but one beer to him, and that beer was the great HopDevil."
"I've never had a moment with this beer where I wasn't in mad lust. Helps living in the area, where the price for a six-pack seems chucklingly low. I love it. Love it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but the carbonation is nice and fine, making this a pretty smooth drinking beer. This beer is almost 7% alcohol, but the great flavor plus smooth feel makes this very drinkable."
"higher carbonation, with medium body. I find this IPA more drinkable that most."
"A good beer. It's as advertized, a hop bomb, and you can't fault it for delivering."
"note: I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. How this plays into this review, who knows.."
"Thiis is a great IPA. There's nothing absolutely exceptional about it, but it's a very solid, widely available choice that I'll surely reach for again."
"Taste-Initial taste of spicy malt, caramel, then a blast of piney, resiny hop bitterness that follows you to the bottom of the glass. Nicely balanced between the spicy malt sweetness, and earthy, piney hop bitterness. Very nice IPA!"
"Overall: A competent IPA, nicely crisp and enjoyable, rather in the middle of the road of the style. Definitely hoppy but plenty of malt balance there, too. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Delicious! Bring Victory to Missouri!"
"D - Great local choice that got me into the craft scene years ago. This bottle was consumed approximately two weeks after bottling, and in my experience I notice that it starts going in a different, malty direction after about a month and a half or so. Grab it fresh, and its outstanding."
"D-I enjoyed this beer but I would've enjoyed it a little more as an IPA if the malt was toned down a bit."
"D: The beer is very drinkable - I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
"D - Despite the bitter finish, I could drink a lot of these in one night due to the lowish abv."
"Holy Hops, Batman! This beer is insane in the membrane. It looks OK, it smells OK, but the initial sip sent sent me on a spin. The aftertaste is nothing but pure hoppyness. Even after it goes down the hatch, the hops linger behind and are 2 legit 2 quit."
"Very drinkable when you wish to jump start your drinking fun with something hoppy yet well balanced and trouble free."
"This is pretty tasty, giv e me a hop wallop though."
"Sweet orange hit up front, followed by the fresh citrus, finnishing with bitter grapefruit. Just enough sweetness lingers as not to overwhelm with the bitter dominance."
"I should have had a more level head going into this review, but from the small amount of hype surrounding this beer I had my hopes set on hops. I recommend picking up a loose 12oz bottle from you local grocer as an entire sixer of this stuff will put a dent in your wallet."
"D - good hoppy session beer"
"Nice bitter hop and sweet malt flavors gives a nice even balance and makes for a tasty IPA."
"D: As a good-old-fashioned American IPA, this is a standout. Simple, clean, bold, but not overdone. Well done."
"Overall, its interesting but not something I would really reach for again. Worth a try though."
"Very tasty IPA paired excellently with some spicy cheese"
"Flavors are delicious and very well balanced. Exceptional drinkability for an IPA. I could definetly drink a couple of these to kick off the night."
"Deep orange with a red hue, a slight haze and no head. Decent lacings on the glass. Big citrus and tropical aromas with a hint of sweet maltiness. Very smooth and mellow feel. More mellow than the bottled version. Low carbonation. Tropical citrus flavors overwhelm this IPA. Difficult to detect any malt character. Hop flavors taper from tropical fruit to pine at the finish. Very smooth and mellow with tons of hop punch and it went down pretty easy."
"Appears a rusty golden brown, relatively translucent with only about a finger or so of head even with some aggression on my part. Thin layer of head, sticky lace. Aroma is very nice, well rounded out with a ton of different citrus notes, lots of pineapple, lemon zest, a bit of grapefruit initially, some peach and as always, yer usual rich, and sweet caramel malt. Nice stuff, even for something not as fresh as it probably should be. Taste is quite bitter up front, and the hops are well known. More citrus here, and at points I want to think the bitterness borders on something potentially enamel ripping when fresh (for an IPA at least). Similar hop profile to what I've noticed in a variety of Victory beers (at least in Prima Pils and Hop Wallop at this point). Long bitter and drying finish. Good drinkability as I can't detect the alcohol, but the bitterness of this would likely prevent from several in succession."
"Overall, HopDevil is an interesting little devil. Absolutely fresh, I'm sure it's much better. This bottle is a few months old. This brew is really drinking closer to a light barley wine, than an IPA. Really, it wouldn't make a bad barley wine, and I can even imagine an ASDA spin off on this."
"This was completely new for me. I wasnt aware Victory was avalible in Michigan. This was a very good IPA but not outstanding."
"D- A very good IPA from Victory. While Victory probably doesn't have any beers in my top 10 favorite, it's in the top couple breweries, because they simply don't make bad beers. This is a borderline great IPA. A definite recomend."
"M/D: Medium body and carbonation. A bit to unbalanced hops make this one hard to drink multiple at a time, but good IPA when you want full on hops."
"Overall very nice: good hop flavors without being overly bitter. Also, the malt is just enough to balance -- too much malt or caramel in an IPA is a turn-off for me. Very good drinker. HopDevil was the first IPA I ever had, before I even knew what was supposed to characteristic of an IPA. It had been a while since I'd had a HopDevil, & I'm happy to report that it's a really quality example of the East Coast style."
"Poured from bottle into 22 ounce glass.. Slight head that remained in this light copper coloured beer.. Has hoppy taste that is not too bad overall.. Lace left on glass after finishing, leaves slight after taste... Will buy again next year in a six pack.."
"I generally stop at one IPA at a time, but this went down pretty well for such a hoppy beer. Good alcohol, a nice bit, would pair nicely with a variety of foods, or just kicking back with a bag of chips."
"Pours copper with a solid sustained head. Nose is filled with citrusy hops: some mango, maybe some pineapple, ect. Solid nose for sure. Very forward on the hop bitterness, but also has a solid malt presence that adds some complexity. The hops still dominate, of course, and we get many of the same citrus flavors present in the nose. Ends with some lasting bitterness. Really tasty beer; I would certainly have another."
"Drinkability is a personal taste. I enjoy sipping a beer and not worrying if it is warm by the end. If I finish a couple of beers over a few hours I had a great night. If you take your time, enjoy the flavor, intensity of the flavor and the richness of the hops this is your beer."
"Cheers"
"D: Pretty easy drinking IPA"
"D: A beer I will likely buy again to enjoy one at a time"
"Not a beer I will get again. Nothing truly offends me about, but nothing really gets me excited either."
"D- A great IPA that is very enjoyable and easy to drink. This is does not stand out from any other IPA I have had, but it is a beer I truly enjoy."
"Excellent beer!"
"Notes: Another brew that introduced me to craft and hoppier brews some time ago... And it remains a nice pleasure to revisit. It holds a rich hoppy profile rather well, and feels like quality through and through."
"I think the draft version is a little more bitter and I enjoyed it more. It is at my local bar and I'll definitely have it again."
"I'm not too impressed with the apparent filtering that they subject this beer to. I see nothing wrong with an abundance of yeast and hop residue in other IPA's and IIPA's."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Orange in color, with little or no head. Scents of hops and citrus. This is a very well balanced IPA plenty of hops both citrus and pine, also a strong malt backbone balances it out. The malts add a nice crisp breadlike flavor. Mouthfeel is oily. This is a very drinkable brew, I have no problem enjoying a 6 pack of it."
"Overall I was expecting more of this beer after having Hop Wallop a few times but the hops were surprisingly faint. A nice beer but not worth seeking out."
"Copper colored with outstanding head retention. Head is creamy with and it has streaks of tiny carbonation which are consistent. Smells of a crisp hop with a spicy lemony note. Tastes like a lemon rind with a high amount of pilsner malt. Nice dry palate with good hop kick correct for an ipa. I can drink a few over a night nothing to get crazy with."
"D-Easy drinker especially for 6.7%. Easy to drink a 6er of this."
"D - Good IPA, for beginner hopheads this is a nice balanced mildly hoppy IPA that would a good starting point on your journey to find the greatest IPA around (IMO) Not my favorite but it will not be the last time I dance with this devil. Cheers"
"The mouthfeel is good. It is a very drinkable beer. I have had this beer and the golden monkey out of a mixed 12 pack that I bought for $16. It also has the prima pils in it. I am really pleased with the value of this purchase. I will probably buy another mixed 12."
"Bottle pours a dark clear amber brown with a decent amount of head. Tastes of slight malty hop bitterness with almost a little spiceyness in there too. Drinks pretty smooth and would be quite sessionable. Didn't wow me, but its solid. Glad I tried this one."
"Very good beer. I think I enjoyed this bottled more than on draft."
"D - For a beer named hopdevil would have expected hops to take the lead in this beer. Not quite what I was expecting but still the balance makes it a solid beer."
"Poured from bottle into glass. Nice amber/copper color with little less than 1 finger of head and decent retention. Faint floral hops aroma with hint of citrus. - citrus noticeable in taste with hops and a lingering bitterness in after taste. Smooth and medium-bodied feel. Drinkability OK."
"I suppose this just isn't my kind of IPA. The bitterness was just too much, and don't get me wrong, I like bitter beers. This beer is well brewed and a nice representation of the style, just not for me."
"Overall, very solid IPA that has some tendencies that I can appreciate, but are against my own personal liking. I prefer the more floral/fruity IPAs rather than the warmth and earthiness of this one. Almost came off a bit too phenolic for an IPA...."
"Like I said, probably a bad six pack, and will be re-reviewed if I get one that isn't like this. Not very pleasant this time."
"Overall: Excellent IPA. Great representation of the style. I would definitely recommend this one."
"D - The smell, taste, and ABV are enough to make me want to return."
"D- Not wonderful, average."
"-notes from 02/07"
"On tap the devil is a totally different animal."
"Pours a dark copper with nice head and lacing. Smells of biscuit, piney, and earthy. Faint smell of yeast and malt. . A bitter bomb hits your taste buds with a slight resin and spicy finish. Despite the finish its clean and fresh. Very silky feel but not too heavy. A fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery."
"The mouthfeel is very creamy, full-bodied, and slightly below average in carbonation. It is actually quite drinkable because of the balance, but this would probably work better on an autumn evening, not a summer one. Overall, I've definitely had better, and this just doesn't seem to sit well with me."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, this is an excellent beer and easily consumed in quantity. Having recently had a lot of DIPAs its great to have a complex and well balanced single."
"My first Victory nbrew and because of this I will try others."
"A terrific beer. Pours a lovely amber-red color, with only a minimal amount of head. Hop aromas are more spicy rather than citrus. Definitely different from the usual West Coast IPAs I drink. The taste is excellent. A well done blending of malt character and hop taste. A smooth, almost sharp bitterness that persists throughout but never overwhelms. My tongue keeps dancing back and forth between the malt and hops. Love it. I wish I could pick up what hops are used in this, but the only hint I can say with some certainty is that there is some Chinook in here. I probably haven't been able to brew with the other hops used here (Nuggett? Some English hops?) The drinkability on this one is just what you'd expect for an IPA. Good alcohol content, and a great body that makes this a great drink even in hot weather. A beer I'd get again in a heartbeat."
"D - I've heard good things but please stop shipping your beer to California if it's going to arrive ruined."
"Pours an orange-amber with a red hue. Dark cream/off-white colored 2 finger head with good lacing throughout. Great aroma. Strong floral hop aroma, very pleasant. Also some citrus notes mixed in. Taste starts off surprisingly matly with a bready, caramel sweetness. Not huge malt, but nice. Then the hops kick in. Floral hops, pine and earthy notes create a big hop flavor and citrus also contributes late. Finishes a little bitter and dry, but goes down very well for the style. Really a great, big hop taste and an excellent beer."
"This is an excellent IPA. I'm going back to get the whole 6 pack as one is not enough."
"Some grassy and piney elements to the aroma with a hint of citrus. Slight malt taste initially, then the hops kick in hard, giving it a strong, piney, hoppy taste with citrus elements. Light carbonation, good body. Excellent IPA, but the taste and punch are so strong I can only have one before feeling overwhelmed by the flavors."
"Overall, this beer is quite drinkable and it highlights the hops but the individual components could be a bit stiffer."
"D - me and this one have a history, back when i was just getting into craft beers this was a steady goto, until I had a few too many one night. though not as good as I remember, this is a solid East Coast IPA."
"Quite tasty, great example of the style."
"Quite drinkable, if it wasn't a Sunday, I'd crack open another."
"Drinkability: Meh, I could take it or leave it... I would gladly give it another shot though if I was told that the keg was fresh and re-review this if needed."
"D: Very easy to drink and smooth going down. Victory has yet to let me down. Intrigued to try the Wild Devil I picked up this past weekend to compare."
"D_Very.Great go to ipa. Never fails."
"Overall, this is a nice starter IPA for those who want to ease into the hoppier brews and a very drinkable session beer. I'm glad I stopped in for a visit."
"Best by date: Oct 7 2010"
"Drinkability: I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts here. I would gladly drink this again, one at a time or in a session."
"I'm glad I can easily find this beer here in California. Though I love west coast IPA's, this one really was a nice break from them."
"Solid IPA, but not my fav."
"D - Good drinkability, more on the sweet side than bitter, which if I had to choose an extreme it would be sweet, makes it easy to go sip to sip. The sweetness would probably start to get to me after 2 bottles."
"Needs more aroma but is incredibly WELL balanced for an IPA."
"Hopdevil doesn't wreck the palate with aggressive hops like a typical American IPA. Its a more balanced take on things. If you are hoping for a hop bomb, this ain't it. For those seeking a lighter, easy drinking IPA, Hopdevil is the perfect choice. In the end this is a well crafted and balanced brew."
"Pours a hazy almost Orange color with a nice white head. Aroma of pine, grapefruit, and hop flowers. Taste is exactly what you would expect from the aroma. Started out more of a grapefruit/Hop flavor while cold, but when it warmed a little, then it turned a little toward the pine/Hop side, that may be a tart cherry flavor in the first sips....a mellow German malt bitterness, compliments each other nicely. No Lacing. Wow, 6.7% I never would have guessed."
"D - Pretty drinkable and balanced IPA, I think the pronounced malty profile of the beer would get to me after 2-3 pints, so for me I might be able to put down 3 pints at most. I really like this one though, and I think I'd buy again. Cheers!"
"An interesting IPA, not my favorite but very nice at the least. If you are not crazy about hops but want to try an IPA then this would be one to give a shot. It is pretty drinkable, enjoyable and well-balanced. Give it a shot!"
"D - This is not an IPA that should really be an IIPA, there are hops but they are not over the top and there is a lot of malt to balance it all out. Balance is good and makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a hazy reddish amber with a medium, creamy tan head. Quite dark for an American IPA. Smell is primarily of ripe fruit, apples and pears. Taste is butterscotch sweetness up front, followed by a ripe fruit middle, and a citrusy hop finish. Impressive bitterness levels, especially considering the rich malt flavor. The beginning fruit flavors of this ale remind me a lot of an English one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, low carbonation. Good Drinkability. This beer is definitely an East Coast IPA, lots of malt, but still a lot of hops to counteract and let you know this is an IPA. An excellent beer."
"As the name implies...you better like hops to drink this beer. The beers pours a copper/amber color....good head and lacing and a great hoppy smell that smacks you in the face. The taste is balanced very well with some bitterness up front that smooths out as you drink the beer. I put down 3 of these waiting for my steak to cook. Can definitely see myself stocking some in the fridge."
"D- overall, a great beer and could easily put back a few in one sitting. A great IPA to definitely keep on hand."
"There is a hoppy taste through and through, and even more hop taste in after a full swallow. Get this beer if you like hops."
"O An excellent beer for the hop lovers. Definitely would have another."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not my favourite, but not too bad either"
"This is one of the beers that got me into craft. I think I prefer the draft version given the choice. To me HopDevil is a classic. As far as I'm concerned this is THE East Coast IPA. Affordable and easy to find, there is no reason not to grab one of these if you've never had one."
"Pours an amber-orange colour with a nice thick white head. Sweet citrus in the smell. Taste has a lot of citrus hops with a very present caramel malt flavour. Some bitterness, but well balanced with sweetness. This is not a hop bomb (my preference), but it certainly is delicious for a malty east coast IPA. Nice carbonation level makes this a great drinker."
"M/D: It is very smooth and is easy drinking. A very nice IPA that I will certainly drink again."
"Definitely drinkable, one of the first things I noticed was the refreshing feeling I got after cracking a cold one. To be fair I had a long day but seriously, it's refreshing and begs you to take on the devil"
"Taste is mostly malt at first, but hops quickly kick in with very nice bitter/tannin finish you'd expect from good IPA. Really good beer, will certainly buy again."
"Edit: Got the chance to try this again on tap while in the Philadelphia airport. I have to say having it fresher was definitely better. Most of my review stands but this second tasting had a little more of that hop flavor I was looking for and deserved a bit of a bump up in the taste department."
"Used to love this beer while living in PA. Don't understand what happened to this beer. Apperance: great. An aluring dark amber color. Smell is also good. Taste: nasty metallic after taste. What happened to this beer? Definitely down hill from previous offerings. What went wrong?"
"A sturdy, malty IPA. Good, but probably better on-tap for hop freshness."
"Carbonation is fine but the bitterness lingers in the mouth unpleasantly long. This isn't my kind of IPA."
"Now that I know what I am getting in to I would probably get this again but not when I want a hop bomb. It's strange because I really enjoyed Hop Wallop and would drink that regularly but this one is just meh."
"D - Quite drinkable. Pleasant aftertastes, and it goes down easy enough. I bought this as a single, but could see buying a sixer. Wish it was a bit hoppier yet, but I still enjoyed."
"Feel is smooth and quite creamy. Medium carbonation."
"From a fresh Victory sampler case. Had this awhile back before I knew what I was doing. This time I knew the caramel color and one finger white head with a bit of lacing was a thing of beauty. Piney grapefruity hops up front with a tiny bit of alcohol and malt in the back of the scent. Taste was delicious with a surprisingly nice malt presence despite the heavy hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability were right there for the style. This is a good gateway into the wide world of hops. Not a west coast hop bomb but still quite enjoyable."
"I would call this a session IPA."
"Pours a reddish-gold color with a somewhat soapy white head. This one is surprisingly malty on the nose, with hints of caramel and toffee, along with somewhat muted hops. This is a very balanced beer, almost more malt than hops. Having had this one a number of times I still don't get all the hype. Not bad, but nowhere near the level of the west coast IPAs."
"Nice to know Satan is growing good hops and has a knack for brewing."
"Drinkability- Very quaffable. It manages to be almost light and refreshing despite it's 6.7 ABV. This beer could easily be a session beer, and even those who don't traditionally love hops might enjoy it. However, I might only feel this way after drinking so many phenomenally hopped beers."
"D: very easy to drink, leaves me wondering why i waited so long to try a cask ale."
"Standard shaker glass with a small head cap. Copper in color with amber hues. Head was small but retained very well and left a trail of lace rings in it's wake. Fresh nose of pine and citrus. Malt hits up front followed by citrus and piney hops. Finishes bitter and dry and leaves you wanting more. Solid drinkability if your a hop fan. A well made IPA from Victory."
"Victory HopDevil poured an amber color, with no head. It smelt of one thing, hops. It tasted just of liquid hops. It was not the easiest to drink, but overall a fantasitc beer, very hoppy, and worth a try, but this wouldnt be a beer for everyone, but a real beer fan would enjoy it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pinching and somewhat drying alcohol."
"D-Wasn't really a huge fan of this one. The hops just weren't to my taste, and I like my IPA's a little less carbonated."
"Drinkability is very good considering the abv and boldness of flavor. All-in-all, a very desirable American IPA."
"Drinkability: Tough to complain with a few of these in front of me. Smooth, classic taste. There is always room in my fridge for a balanced IPA."
"D: Yeah, it's really good. It's a fine beer and I wouldn't mind making it a staple of my fridge if I wasn't so into variety. I'd think of it as a good average or median of what an IPA should be for the beer uninitiated. I actually had a person drink this along with Victory's Golden Monkey to see where they stood on the malt/hops scale. Turns out he didn't like either, but I think this was actually a good way to find out. Yumm yumm"
"Thank God there's an American IPA out there that doesn't feel the need to kill you with bittering hops. Not that it's bad, it's just a nice change of pace. Very, very flavorful. I guess my only complaint is the very faint hop aroma."
"D- pretty drinkable. Really could on a nice hot day where you're just looking to relax. I can imagine this would be great while cooking out"
"M/D: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Other than that nothing special. Drinkability is average at best because of the soap factor. Not sure what is causing this...Its not old, best by date of August 8th, 2010."
" However this was amazing with a spicy stir-fry, the alcohol was completely hidden, and I definitely sessioned this devil."
"Like most beers I've had from Victory, this one is solid, but not the kind of beer that would win someone over to a style. Or to put it more practically, not the kind of beer I'd particularly want to buy again (I found myself mysteriously craving another HopDevil after my first last night, but I would have been even more satisfied by an outstanding (D)IPA than another HopDevil). Hopefully Wild Devil or Hop Wallop will change my mind. I have to admit that I'm morbidly curious about Hop Wallop, since the bitterness level of HopDevil was so silly (I don't know what drinking a pint of hop extract is like, but I have some suspicions now). Unfortunately, I suspect that the beer was less bitter than it was *not flavorful enough*. You don't mind the assault when it brings flavor with it."
"Found this in San Diego and was excited to try it after not having easy access to Victory beers in the Bay Area. Pint glass pour and I am met with a copper colored ale with a bubbly foamy head which stays throughout the session and produces a ton of lacing. The aroma is a major malt bomb. Bready, doughy almost a skunky beer smell. I wasn't really impressed with the taste. I was expecting a major hop explosion but it was not to be. Subdued hops are present with a lot of maltiness going on. There is an odd aftertaste which is present far too long. It wasn't an overall difficult beer to consume, but multiples were not in the cards for me...though I'm sure it would be for many others. Just didn't dig it that much unfortunately."
"D: Goes down very smooth and is quite tasty, although the high hops and bitterness may wear out the palate after a couple bottles."
"appearance: minimum head, almost no lacing. The hops were there and it's very smooth but expected much more, given the name and the previous reviews. Will try again to see if I just had an ""off experience."""
"very bold hoppy and smooth all around a damn good beer. this is the beer that got me into good beer. for me it's a classic. It always has a damn good color and body. Hoppy and bitter. I first took a chance on it outside of Pittsburgh at a random dive bar, hollywood gardens in rochester twp. One drink and i could never go back to drinking shitty lagers. Little did i know that this was just a start to the many great beers I have drinken since."
"overall this beer isnt bad at all, great appearance and the taste isnt bad by any means, it just isnt my style of ipa... i'd almost consider it more of a hoppy amber/pale ale"
"I had this up in North Conway. I must say Delaney's Hole in the Wall surprised me with this brew. I picked it at random and I wasn't disappointed. Worth a ride."
"D- this is a good Am IPA. It is strong with the alcohol... however the character of this brew makes an memorable IPA. The brew exhibits that east coast IPA that many seek. I highly recommend grabbing this beer"
"For all you hop-heads: bottoms up! HopDevil is an absolute winner."
"Caveat: I do prefer more hop forward beers and less malt so if you prefer a good balanced beer you might enjoy this one. I'd say give it a try and see for yourself!"
"I went back for a six pack of this"
"Aroma 3.5, Appearance 3.5, Taste 3.5, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.5, Score 3.5"
"Slainte."
"Drinkability: This is a good bitter-hoppy IPA with strong bitter citrus flavor. I could do without the husky grain flavor."
"D: Absolutely, a hop heads dream, but also complex enough to draw in non-hop fans to the realm of ""hoppiness"" definitely will have again."
"Drinkability: Great beer that keeps it's IPAness in check and allows this beer to be a sit back and relax type beer rather than an enamel ripper. Very nice and excellently balanced brew."
"Very creamy on the mouth and a solid body. Overall a solid IPA, and would always be a great choice."
"T"
"D - the perfect session IPA? If this ain't it then I don't know what is."
"D: Very good. This is a nice ""east coast"" American IPA -- i.e., more balanced than the west coast varieties."
"D - What a brew. One of the brews that I turn to when I'm in the store and can't decide what to get. One of my true ole' reliables. Also very drinkable and pretty much sessionable. Haven't had Wallop still, but I'm curious."
"A very nice IPA - bitter for sure, but not harsh. The light citrus notes and subtle maltiness hiding in the background make this a very enjoyable beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"pours a dark amber color with a slight amount of head that kind of stuck around for a while. pretty hoppy first smell, but wasn't quite as potent in the first taste. a bit more of a malty bitter taste that was very pleasing to the palate. great beer for something that's so easy to come by."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - medium to thick-ish, soft. This is a nice, refreshing IPA! I could have several of these, and with 6.7% alcohol, that would not be too bad of a thing. I'm a fan."
"A great beer for its price point."
"D: Enough to keep you interested. Worth a few for sure."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a dark amber color and a thin tan head. There is some carbonation rising. There is some hop presence in the nose, but not as much as I expected. I can also smell some graham cracker malt sweetness. It has a very bitter flavor. It hits your tongue bitter, swallows bitter and lingers bitter. In addition, there is also a grassy hop characteristic to the taste. Not too much sweetness. Nor is there much mouth coating. It has a medium body and average levels of carbonation. It is very drinkable. There's lots of bittnerness, but it never gets to be too bitter. I could have a few rounds of this."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a fairly clear amber hue with about a finer worth of eggshell head. The aroma has a little more malt characteristics than most of the IPAs I drink. There is crisp hop presence in the smell as well. This is one of the better balanced IPAs I have tasted. There is a strong hop presence all around, but the slight sweet malt component balances this extremely well. Overall a great IPA and a little different from most of the IPAs I drink in terms of the malt backbone being a little stronger."
"This holds a place on my short list of go-to beers, and that's saying a lot."
"Brown bottle with a best by date of 2/9/10. Pours an amber color, partially cloudy with a finger of white head and nice lace upon the glass. Faint particles stuck in suspension. Aroma of citrus hops that flows through the taste. Citrus and grass predominent both in smell and taste that finish bitter from the hops. Medium feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall well done."
"OVERALL: Definitely an odd one. The taste profile was well balanced and very enjoyable, making it more than drinkable, but the nose was too weak and everything else about it was average at best. I'm honestly not quite sure why this one is rated so highly. Perhaps the bottle was not quite as fresh as it could be, so I'll have to give it another go if I see it on my next trip to the States."
"D= Session- I rated this as a session beer. With a 6.7% abv and a great body this would make for a great session beer. Lots of big bold pine citrus flavors blended well with a good malt backing makes for a good balanced brew from one of my original breweries. Respect Victory!"
"Recommended Music Pairing: Dr. John - Right Place Wrong Time"
"Drinkability is very high, despite the bitterness. Goes down very smoothly."
"Was honestly surprised by this beer. I expected a good brew from Victory, but usually beers with ""hop"" in the name don't deliver for me. But with this beer I was wrong, it was definitely niice and hoppy. The smell was a lot earthier than I had expected, it had a lot of straw/hay scent, along with caramel and hops. Taste was nice and balanced. A good beer to find at the sandwich shop around the corner - salud!"
"D: Highly dirnkable, this is one of the best Victory offerings that I've had to date. Well balanced and not overhopped with a surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Finish is exceptionally clean and keeps me going back for more. This is one beer I look forward to revisiting in the future. Highly recommended for an appreciator of more balanced IPAs and I imagine a bit frustrating for those hardcore hop-heads."
"D: Definitely drinkable."
"Overall, for me this is one of those that used to be better. Years ago when I first tried it, it really stood out, it's been awhile since then so maybe my tastes have changed. I just seem to remember a better beer, the bottle I had was well before the ""drink by"" date, but it seemed to lack the great flavor and balance that really impressed me back then. This is one I will go back to, maybe an average one escaped from the brewery."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Very smooth. Could easily drink 3 in a session"
"While this is a good beer, it doesn't set itself apart in any way. It seems to be a little on the week side and maybe a little one dimensional. Not bad, but not outstanding..."
"This looked like a red ale. Pour was nice, looked like it was going to taste good, but I was disappointed. It didn't have enough bite for an IPA. I didn't taste a hop explosion, I thought it was one of the more watered down tasting micro-brews I've ever had. I was expecting big taste, but something was missing. Not enough flavor for me. Maybe I had a bad bottle. Didn't compare to many of the other IPAs I've had."
"D: Really enjoyed this brew, a definite winner for Victory."
"*This is a re-review and the scores went up."
"A: Thick lathered head, serious sticky stripes of lace down the sides of the glass, color is deep copper to golden brown - 4.50, S: Lots of spice and earth with a hint of mustiness, there are also some strong aromas of thick sweet bread and banana pudding - 4.25, T: A nicely balanced IPA though possible slanted a little towards the malts for an IPA, I pick up lots of sweet biscuity caramel flavors along with a solid dose of grapefruit, orange and pine - 4.25, M: Soft and smooth - 4.00, D: Enjoy by March 12, 2010 on the label, I missed it by two days but the beer tastes every bit as good as I remember it, heavier on the malts than I generally like in my IPAs, still a solid IPA all around - 4.00"
"Finish is the biggest bitter (unpleasant) pine resin character I've had to date, and not a good bitterness but a ""chemical"" or synthetic bitter character. I can't see this being a beer to drink."
"This is one very drinkable IPA, perhaps my favorite now or tied with SN Celebration. I say it's balanced but that is perhaps just me as the hop flavors are sublime. If you like IPAs I can't recomend this beer enough. I am thoroughly impressed with Victory beers!"
"D - A+"
"D: Good stuff. Any hophead that hasn't tried this one is missing something. I don't necessarily classify myself as a hop head, (Belgian ales are still my favorite) but this one is right up there with the better IPA's and hoppy brews, while still being hoppy and also being a moderate session brew."
"D: A nice IPA. Great one to have on a cold or brisk day."
"Overall, a very good example of the style that is certainly worth your time."
"Overall, i love the use of the german two row malt in this one. It's like drinking the love child of an oktoberfest and an AIPA. This one is rich and smooth with plenty of hoppy goodness that true fans of IPAs look for."
"D - definitely drinkable and definitely tasty. I can't pinpoint why but I don't think I'd want to toss back more than one or two in a sitting."
"Pours a lovely copper that fades to golden around the edges. Carbonation is subdued, not much head and what is there is fading disappointingly fast. The beer does have pretty good lacing though. The aroma is malty for an American IPA, which is to say, while there is plenty of citrus and pine aroma, there is also decent amount caramel malt in the nose as well as a touch of spice. Taste is quite different from a lot of other IPAs and very nice. Well balanced with a nice hop flavor. White grapefruit and pine mingle well with the substantial malt backbone that consists of some caramel, some biscuit and a bit of spice. Yum! Firm bitterness lends to a nice finish in this IPA which I would describe to be on the lighter side of medium. Definitely drinkable and a session beer for a hop head like me. This and Two Hearted are what got me into IPAs and I had forgotten what a great beer this is. I need to take the trip over to Downingtown ASAP and enjoy some of this on cask at the brewpub."
"I would love to try this on tap, as I'm sure it would be more flavorable vs a bottle shipped across the country!"
"Goes down nice and easy...for a hop-head. I have and will continue to enjoy a session with HopDevil."
"D- Okay drinkability, I'm not too big a fan of pine + bitter combo. Overall a good IPA, but not victory's best"
"Overall Impression: Hop Devil is a damn fine beer. This beer may not go over too well with Newbeez due to the bitter finish. Hop Headz will definitely enjoy it though!"
"D - Highly drinkable, ABV is a bit high for me to make a night of this without getting housed, however I would easily enjoy a couple of these at a go."
"The HopDevil pours a copper color with a quick dissolving 2 finger off white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Nose is pretty subtle with sweet hints of citrus fruits including grapefruit and a hoppy finish rounds her out. Palate has some caramel and malts in it along with the piny IPA and hoppy finish. A mediocre tasting IPA at best. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with solid carbonation. Drinkability is mostly due to the style as this one does not shine compared to others. In contrast though, the ABV that this has does make it much more drinkable than some IPA's."
"Drinkability: It's a good beer, and one I wouldn't mine having several of...if the ABV was lower. It doesn't taste like an IPA, just a regular APA, but has the ABV of an IPA. It's not a bad beer...but not what I would go for if I want an IPA."
"D- I am really liking these hopped up beers, even with the higher abv of HopDevil, I could sit and drink a few of these in a row."
"D: Good drinkability but I still prefer a more citrus hop dominated IPA."
"this beer has the reputation of not producing the hops as expected but I think that is due to the malts that comes through. this beer puts a ""devilish"" grin on my face. will be a regular in my beer fridge"
"D-3.5 not super easy drinking with all the bitterness and lacks the big tropical fruit hop presence or pine, mainly malt and bitter."
""
"D - probably will only have one of these, bit to chewy for me"
"Slightly hazy deep copper pour with nice fluffy head and decent lacing. Huge hoppy floral nose with hints of citrus, candy and a subtle earthiness. Decent malt backbone for such a hop monster. Over the top bitterness hits you immediately. Very complex taste with tea, pine, candy, grapefruit and a nice earthy backbone. Great crisp, dry bitter bite on the finish with just a touch of sweetness to balance it out. Highly drinkable if you're a hophead like me. This is just one more example of why Victory is one of my favorite breweries."
"D - Very drinkable for an IPA especially for a cold weather brew - not a session beer, but one definately calls for several more"
"pours a true light brown with a slightly off white head. the smell is a kind of citrus funk that smells inviting yet not at the same time. definitly an east coast style here, thicker tasting if that makes sense. good backbone and smooth finish. nice beer, i kind of prefer my ipa's a little more juiced but this is definitly far from horrible."
"Not my all-time favorite, but certainly drinkable and enjoyable enough. I like Wild Devil better, but then again, I would ;)"
"As soon as I popped the cap and took a smell I knew I was in love."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking."
"This is among my favorites. It has simple flavors, that come together perfectly."
"D= better with each sip."
"Drinkability is limited by what feels like more alcohol than the supposed 6.7%. Maybe the huge hoppiness makes you imagine this brew will get you drunk too fast? Also it's a bit pricey for my budget, so no more than one a day, please."
"Overall - I can't find one thing that I do not like about this beer. It tastes very similar to the Stone IPA and Smuttynose ""Finest Kind"" IPA and is definitely now, along with those two, one of my favorite American IPAs. Unbalanced when considering the style, but personally I love the dominant flavors."
"Great East Coast IPA."
"Notes: Hop lovers should certainly seek this one out. I found it to be a nicely balanced Hop Bomb."
"Notes: I must be turning into more of a hop head than I thought, because I'm enjoying this IPA more than I thought I would enjoy any hoppy brew."
"Drinkability: With the average ABV for the style this one is very drinkable. Your taste buds might not like it afterwards though."
"Overall some pretty good some. But with so many firken' good IPA's out there, it's always a dilemma which to chose. This is a good candidate!"
"D- Good session beer, that is worth another purchase."
"I consider Victory's HopDevil a classic American IPA."
"Very drinkable - a refreshing patio-type beer!"
"D: A nice drinking IPA with a reasonably low abv., making it good for a short session or for drinking with wings. Just don't have too many - 6.7% will catch up to you pretty quick! Not my favorite, but a solid all around representation of the style. It's not uncommon for this to be one of the best beers on draft at local establishments in upstate New York."
"D: HopDevil is not so much a session beer, but it sure is worthy of drink or two. Don't get in your car after a few of these...they really are the devil."
"Right up there with my other favorite IPAs."
"This was the first IPA I ever had. Had it on tap tonight for the first time at Apollo Grill, Easthampton MA. Dark orange with a nice off-white creamy head, leaves great lacing. Smell is a little faint for me, mostly just getting citrus hops. Taste is super hoppy, citrus, pine, caramel, biscuit. Definitely a 'spicy' IPA. The mouthfeel is great and creamy on-tap. (I've had it on-tap a couple times since and it's been pretty thin with low carbonation, eh.) Hops would kill this over time but this IPA still holds up great in my book. 9 or 10 bucks for the 6-pack is a good price too."
"D: It's drinkable if you want hops, hops, and more hops. I'd have no problem knocking back a couple of these."
"I plan on grabbing another 6 pack of this as soon as its gone!"
"Drinkability is sturdy. A few of these could go down effortlessly."
"D -This is a solid, hoppy beer with lots of character. If there's any fault, it was a bit dry."
"Pours hazy coppeer with 2 fingers of fluffy light tan head, very little lacing. With a beer named Hopdevil I was definately expecting more hops from my first wiff. The scent was a bit weak and balanced by sweet malt. Taste is also more balanced than expected. Definitely bitter and filled with citrus and spicy hops, but there is quite a bit of malt complexity. Finishes with a blunt bitterness and peppery spice. Mouthfeel leaned toward dry and thin. Not hard to drink but I wouldn't care for two of these in a row."
"D: An excellent IPA that I could easily put back a few of, as the bitterness is extremely present but not too strong at all."
"Very drinkable, I kinda want another one. Really enjoyed this beer, definitely going to get a 6-er next time I visit the store."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are still very good here. This is an extremely well-brewed beer. I'm just don't like the recipe as well as I thought I would. I've had 4 HopDevil's now & it's a good beer that many will like & I can see why. It's just not for me."
"D: A nice example of the style, but not a great one. Worth trying, but I am puzzled by all of the high reviews. I would not buy again given the price."
"Drinkability: Pretty good American IPA. I am not sure the difference between this and an APA but im assuming these are more bitter. Would try again for sure"
"D - Very delicious. Surprisingly drinkable considering the strength of the hops. Really disappointed I don't have another one. I could easily drink three."
"This is a fine American IPA that will appeal especially to hopheads."
"Not a bad IPA, just not a great one. I'm not really disappointed, just sort of nuetral. Victory is still a solid brewery in my book."
"mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is good a nicely flavoured malt driven east coast ipa"
"This is an old stand-by when I need hop fix... always delivers. Pours a deep golden copper color with a nice froth. Floral hops and citrus dominate the nose. Nice hop and citrus bite, crisp, and bitter, some toasted malts, and grapefruit mixed in.. excellent with spicy wings!"
"Drinkability: This is a beer that you can spend an evening with. It would pair well with spicy Asian food or rich and thick foods as well. The high quantity of hops has the ability to cut through spicy and decadent foods well."
"D: Nothing better than a well-done cask conditioned brew. There was only one thing that could tear me away from this treat. You guess what it was..."
"Pours a beautiful copper color which is clear and crowned with a very thin lacy white head. The head dissipates fast but gives off a mouth-watering aroma of citrus and earthy hops. The flavor is slightly tart and filled with earthy hop bitterness. There is a slight malt presence in the background of the light bodied brew with moderate carbonation levels, leading to a well balanced brew. The finish is bittersweet with the continued earthy hop bitterness."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a decent IPA for the price ($8.49 a sixer). I prefer more balanced IPAs with decent hoppiness, but still pretty good overall."
"Pours out an amber-orange color with a two finger off-white head that has decent retention. The top of the head is pretty creamy and has large bubbles where it touches the glass. Thick lacing starts to be left on my glass almost immediately. Smells of bitter, piney hops and sugary amber malts. The balance is pretty nice here and the strength is not bad for either element. I like my beer to have a strong nose, this one is rather fulfilling. The malt element is a bit too sweet to blend in very well, still a good nose though. The hops are also a bit one dimensional. The taste is strange in this beer. It is not the hoppiest beer I have had by far but the hops are incredibly bitter and piney. I also get some orange peel and citrus notes. They dont mask the malts completely but the hop profile itself isn't balanced enough. I still enjoy the beer but it is definitely performs a beat down on my taste buds. Also, they obviously meant for this to have a huge hoppiness. Mouthfeel is rather nice, the body is moderate and the carbonation is appropriate for the taste. The only thing here is the relentless bitterness attack on the tongue. No warming to speak of. This one would be hard to session for me because of the bitterness on the tongue. The price is not too bad at all."
"poured for bottle to tulip looked of honey and raised a off white head it had a floral hoppy aroma with a bit of a sweaty note. a bit toasty for just a split second then the bitterness of the hops takes over finishing dry bitter and crisp. there were notes of citrus, mostly floral though. good ipa that is well hopped when compared to the strength of the malt. not as drinkable as other ipa's that i have had."
"I haven't had this in two years, but this bottle was better than what I remembered. It is a well crafted beer and a good six pack to last through the night."
"Edit: have had more of these recently. Way more tea, toffee, and grain than citrus. American IPA so adjusting downwards..."
"D- Fresh and well balanced. This is a bitter beer with malt sweetness to balance it out. I have had several of these in the past that have had less of a grapefruit taste, so that may have just been this bottle. Overall a great IPA for those who like hoppy bitter IPA's with a good but not overpowering malt background."
"On tap in a pint glass. Rich hazy orange color with a moderate white head. Some slightly cascading lacing. Nose is citrus and hops, with the taste bringing the same. The hop bitterness isn't overwhelming, but it's certainly there. Fairly medium bodied and appropriately tame carbonation - pretty silky smooth. Drinkability is good. Fairly well-rounded in every way, but I'm not sure it really excelled."
"D: Decent brew, tasty enough to go back for more."
"A pretty awesome IPA I think, to back an already stellar reputation."
"Drinkability- Excellent, This is a wonderful beer that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"overall while i thought it was a delicious beer and one i would pick up again it wasn't quite what i was expecting, a excellent beer yes, but not one that may be too much so or too heavy in a way that it limits you from enjoying more than a few (i.e DFH 120 min IPA)"
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable. This is not the big west coast style that I usually enjoy, but I would certainly drink this again, and hope to find on tap and cask."
"Being a sucker for a west coast IPA, I must admit that my expectations were lower than my current perception of this fine brew."
"Pours a deep copper brown color, very nice. Smells extremely hoppy, just like a beer named ""Hop Devil"" should. taste is interesting. Starts fairly mild and then the hops just grow and grow to a lovely bitterness. Very full tasting beer, great for sating that hop craving."
"Drinkability: A very nicely done IPA. Not the hoppiest but definitely one of the best."
"Drinkability is great! Goes down easy and is pretty tasty. Very nice choice for a session beer and something I certainly plan to have again. Overall quite a nice brew!"
"I liked this one. Nice deep copper color. Nice head and great hoppy smell. The hoppy fragrance got me. I first had this on tap in Harrisburg, PA and just found it here. Not my favorite IPA but my selection of IPA's here in VA is somewhat limited. This is one of the better ones available to us. I'll definitely buy it again."
"a big let down.. i really dont remember this beer being that bad in past..oh well..."
"Libation: Pretty good IPA. With something called ""HopDevil"" you'd expect a real hop bomb, but it's quite reasonable. It's interesting, easy drinking, a solid IPA."
"Beer looks decent, nice amber goldness, smells like a minimal hop bouquet of some of those other hops, taste dissapates too quickly. Just expected more from the label and reputation."
"Very slightly hazy copper/orange with a solid cream colored head that looked impressive, but faded quickly. Left quite a bit of lacing. Lots of floral hops. Burnt sugar and some bready caramel malts are also there along with a very slight hint of citrus. For the taste, the citrus comes across more as a zest of grapefruit and orange. Hops are just not as powerful as I was hoping. Lots of the burnt sugar sweet malty notes. I did like the dry bitter finish."
"Drinkability: A good IPA- complex hop flavors without being overpowering like many IPAs are (please send any criticisms of that last comment to my beermail)."
"D: This is my absolute favorite American IPA and raises the bar to the California Pale Ale's"
"You can feel the bitterness on the back of your tounge for a few seconds but it slowy dies down. Medium body bring me another round please!!"
"Low hop bitterness witht his beer, high hop flavor, mostly pine. Medium body, drinkability moderate. Bitterness builds as you drink. There is a mild bitter aftertaste that gets progressively worse the more you drink, affects drinkability a lot. The hops slowly coat your mouth. This beer is deceptively bitter."
"Poured from bottle into a standard pint glass. Great head and carbonation. Its color is quite amberish with a slight orange hue. Much darker than some IPAs. Smell is a bit of a let down, has the typical IPA citrus smell but its not very strong and am really not getting much from it. Taste - alright were getting there, lemon rind, sharp bitterness and spicy pepper finish. Finish is sweet and lingerers on the mouth for a long time. Not a bad IPA, pretty solid in drinkability and could see drinking a few. Really nothing spectacular though, there are certainly other IPAs that I would rather drink."
"D: high, I can drink this all night."
"Bottle. Pours about an inch worth of creamy white head that sticks around. Transparent orange color. Smell is soapy, piney, and a little citrus hop aroma. Slightly sour taste with some pine and hop flavor. Not a bad tasting beer. Very drinkable and pretty good."
"Taste very true and full to the IPA brew style. Not overwelming...a pleasant mixture of bitterness and sweet malts. Better when cold with this brew."
"This beer is pretty 'sharp' in terms of mouthfeel. That hop bite is very assertive when it comes down to crispiness. This brew is just friggin' tasty. It surely hits the spot, very refreshing."
"Overall, a good hoppy beer if you like extreme IPAs. However, I would have appreciated a more balanced beer. A higher gravity could have helped here."
"This beer doesn't taste or feel strong and I was surprised to see how strong the ABV% was. It doesn't go down that fast but it goes down pretty easily and once again, Victory has a winner here. It's only a step or two behind the leaders in this category and certainly worth a try if you're a fan of this style."
"Drinkability: This is a terrific beer and easily sessionable. I will be adding HopDevil to my line up of favorite brews."
"Picked up a couple single IPAs while at the beer store. This one looked interesting and my buddy has told me about Victory beers. So I purchased for about 2 bucks a bottle and took it home. Poured into a 12 oz. snifter with little to no head. Aroma that I would expect from an IPA and nice appearance. Taste as good but mouthfeel seemed a little dry and off. I could only drink a few of these in a sitting. Should defintely try if your an IPA lover like me."
"Overall i like my IPA's a lot more hoppy then malty. But Hopdevil is a real good beer. One of my early favorites when i got onto the craft beer scene."
"Overall I think that this was a great beer. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a hoppy beer."
"D- Pretty good IPA. The lingering bitterness is a little stronger than in most IPAs, but I don't mind that at all."
"I think the malts in this one make the heavy hops tolerable, therefore an enjoyable brew."
"Definitely one of my favorites...Not the 1st time Ive had it."
"D- A very drinkable beer for me, lingers and refreshes, clean, makes me want another each time I have one, and a great East Coast style American IPA..."
"this was a decent beer. i could drink it again, but it's too malty and one dimensional for my tastes in an IPA"
"I really like this IPA. It's a little heavier and bitter than some others I've had in the style, but the malty aspect that comes with the intense hop character makes me want to drink more of this. It would get you eventually, though, with that 6.7% ABV. It is delicious, though."
"The only previous time I had tasted this beer was a 2 oz sample at a fest, and I remembered that I didn't like it, but I had consumed enough previous samples that I couldn't remember what about it I didn't like. Now I remember. An IPA can be very hoppy, and very bitter, while still being flavorful and tasty. HopDevil misses that mark."
"dr. Easy, easy, easy. Good stuff."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: I can only do one of these in a sitting. To much bitterness. A touch of sweetness to balance this would make it amazing!"
"Arrived in a standard bar shaker glass a little on the cold side. The ale appears a hazed golden apricot color with about a finger of dense, lingering foam that grew a bit once it had some room in the glass. Nice lacing left behind. Flavors and aromas consist of white grapefruit juice and pith, resinous pine, toasted sweet bread, and caramel. A bit slick with a medium to full body and adequate carbonation. Very easy going down from the tap."
"mouthfeel- The hops can sometimes leave a prickly feeling on the palate, but once I got used to that I loved the experience. It has a nice medium body, not too heavy. Almost sessionable if it weren't for the higher ABV."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a nice copper brown, with two fingers of off-white head and very good lacing. The smell was wonderfully balanced between maltiness/molasses and hop bitterness, with very subtle hints of grapefruit and pine. The flavor was much more intense, with a near-perfect split between malt and hops, dissolving to a dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel, with little carbonation likely the result of the cask. Very sessionable ipa."
"I think the beer is too unbalanced for my tastes. Glad I only bought a single."
"this beer pours a copper color with a thin off white head that recedes to a thin lace rather quickly. the aroma presents a huge amount of hop aroma, not leaving much room for the malts at all the taste follows with a lot of pine and a bit of malt up front, and then a huge amount of bitterness at the end. the medium body a good co2 make this a really drinkable beer and one of the most frequent six packs in my fridge."
"The taste is ok, nothing but hops again. Not a great finish. Pretty drinkable."
"I love IPA's but I prefer a balanced taste like a 90 min DFH."
"This beer pours a beautiful clear deep copper/amber color with a one finger of off-white thick frothy head to it. I've not seen an IPA as dark as this. Head retains very well and leaves nice thick sticky lacing on the glass. Nose even has bite in it - floral and grassy hops dominate the nose. Taste is all bitter floral hops in the front blended nicely with some caramel malts in the middle and finish with a nice bite of pine and citrusy hops in the finish. Medium body, medium carbonation, nice crisp body to this beer with a clean, dry finish. A great IPA to sit with for a bit."
"This is a great session IPA with a pretty nice 7% abv as well. This is one of those balanced IPA's that come off as nicely hoppy with a good dab of malt in the middle. Hops bring pine and floral notes as well as a nice grapefruit and orange character in the aroma and taste. Nice dark color to the beer compared to other IPA's. Great example."
"D: The beer goes down very smooth. Leaving you with the sensation of satisfaction."
"D- I could drink the hell out of this beer! excellent balance and flavor make this one a winner. Bro approved... chasebrownyeah1"
"Poured into a pint glass orange color with a thick off white head. Ok lacing. Smell isn't too terribly strong. The taste has a nice hop bite upfront that balances out very nice. In fact, the hops kinda burned my lips because of the BBQ I was eating along with it. Overall, this is a very good AIPA with no bad aftertastes."
"Overall- start off negative.... for the name hop devil i was expecting more of a hop attack. other then that it's pretty good. i would say this is a good ipa to those who aren't crazy about a heavy hop load like bell's two hearted and what not. i give it a thumbs up no prob."
"The taste is clean, leafy-spicey-citrsuy hops with candied, slightly burnt orange, yeasty dough underneath, some mineral. It's slightly oily sweet and bitter with the bitterness just dominant."
"Alcohol by volume: 6.7%"
"Finally, expectation where high for this beer and I'd say that I'm a bit disappointed. Did I score a bit low (?), maybe! It's a good IPA, but was expecting something more opulent and complex. A bit more malt to give more structure and balance would be welcome."
"Overall, this is a decent East coast IPA but nothing to go crazy about. I'm impressed with the different aroma, which makes it stand out from most IPAs. I just wish this was more potent in hop flavor and aroma, and maybe I'd be more impressed with a week old keg than a 2 month old bottle."
"A bit intense, but certainly very enjoyable. A great example of an IPA."
"Drinkability-Overall a decent drink, maybe lacking a bit of character. Very gentle IPA nothing stands out or overwhelms. Could see downing a few of these fairly quickly due to the lack of anything biting."
"This beer goes great with chile, and with many mexican dishes. It's a creeper at 6.7%, and one that has gotten many of my friends drunk on many occasions."
"D - I could have a couple of these in a row, and I think I'd enjoy every one, very easily drinkable IPA that has enough going on to keep you coming back for more."
"Good drinkibility. While it has no outstanding characteristics, it is a good brew. Not too much to say about it. Simply a good IPA."
"D- Easy Drinkable IPA,"
"Going through the cellar beer pile, I found a few beers that had slipped in with the big beers I've been aging. This particular HopDevil had an ""Enjoy By"" Date of Aug 19, 2007. Well that was over two years ago, but I was interested in how this might have aged. It was amazing! The hops had mellowed significantly letting the strong malt presence take center stage. The aroma is dominated by sweet floral honey and only a mild dose of citris. The flavor is similar, with a pronounced malt sweetness up front, balanced by alcohol and a spicy hop finish. This was almost a sipping beer that got even better as it warmed. Big and thick on the palate, this baby was a gem of a find."
"D- Very drinkable, at 6.7% it can get on you quick, but overall a great Pale Ale. East Coast steps their game up with this brew. A great introduction to your busch light drinking friends."
"Sticks to the glass and very lacy with an orange/light brown color. Nice aroma of grapefruits, oranges and malt. Flavor is pretty much the same. I noticed the orange flavor more and more as it warmed. A lot more malt than I'm used to in American IPAs but definitely still big on the hops. I was very pleased overall. I generally like malts more than hops so the balance in this beer suited my tastes. I'd recommend it to people who aren't super hopheads or maybe are looking for an entry point into the world of American IPAs. I'll be buying this one again, for sure."
"Notes: I really enjoy west coast IPAs and DIPAs and didn't think east coast could compete, but I was wrong. This was a pretty good beer. Only I was expecting a hop bomb and it wasn't, but I did enjoy the hoppiness and balance."
"Hops lean more to the pine side of the spectrum. The bottle does say enjoy by 11/09/09, so I don't think it's a bad bottle. Mouthfeel is kind of heavy, as I've seen with other Victory brews. Still relatively good and actually kind of sessionable, considering the ABV."
"Mouthfeel is good carbonation but leaves a slight coating. I will have to revisit this soon."
"Cheers!"
"Hits slightly sweet but the floral hops take over my tongue and wreak havoc at the back of my tongue, where they linger in the aftertaste, there's a really lemon tart acidic citric element. The mouth feel is a little sticky but overall pretty good. The carbonation really bolsters this brew. After the first few sips the floral punch seems to mellow some, letting less powerful taste come through. Pretty good, but could use a bit more sweetness to the bitterness and just a bit more malt profile...IMHO."
"I was not a big fan of this beer - I enjoy IPA's, but this one seemed all hops and nothing else. I can see that this beer is very well reviewed on this site, but for my palate, it just didn't do the trick"
"D: This beer is definitely worth the try. Its delicious and whole. I could drink this beer anytime, its not to light, not too heavy."
"Overall: I was expecting a major punch of hops maybe even overpowering but this is an IPA in its own right that stands out from most, truly enjoyable."
"I can pick up a 1/2 keg down the road for only $130. Can't beat the keg price. I feel bad for those of you who don't have access to one of my all time favorite beers."
"A good, solid IPA. I've had this beer through three different sources now, two from trades and a six pack now that Victory distributes to my area. I guess I let the hype get to me because I'm still a bit disappointed. I even refused to review the first two times I tried it, thinking that the bottles weren't fresh enough, but, alas, it's a good IPA that still doesn't knock my socks off. There's a fairly strong malt backbone and a healthy hop bitterness, but neither element is extraordinary. If you're into balanced bitterness, this is probably your thing. For me, it lacks the delicate hop flavors that I really love in an IPA. That's certainly not to say that HopDevil is a bad beer. It nearly has the malt backbone of an amber ale. The hops are fairly strong, if a bit one note. It's easy to drink and quite pleasant."
"O - It just doesn't last long enough. The first impression is of IPA is that its not overpowering enough, then after a few sips the beer becomes perfectly balanced with malt and just the right amount of hops. Its getting a 5 on Overall impression because it improves with each sip, rather then hit you up front and leave you numb towards the end. Perfectly balanced."
""
"D: A very drinkable and well crafted IPA by Victory. I was expecting sinister hop flavors but this was more demure and balanced. Intentional by the brewery? I think so - session gold."
"Clear amber with copious carbonation, and a small white head, quickly fading to a thin film. Aroma is more malt than hops. Bitter with nondescript hopping. Medium mouthfeel. Except for the bitterness, it doesn't strike me as an IPA. More like a hoppy American Amber."
" I've seen this beer on the shelf numerous times, but for some reason never picked it up. Worth checking out. Something to share with friends. Won't be on my everyday drinking list because of it's bold flavor. But is one to have around for others to try!"
"Drinkability: I prefer my IPAs to be a bit hoppier to be completely honest, but this is by no means something I wouldn't like to drink. It's an enjoyable East Coast IPA, which is saying something for me as my preference is definitely the San Diego / West Coast style. It's not my ace-in-the-hole IPA so to speak, but it's one that when cooking, I'll keep in mind for something a bit spicier, as the taste would be great with some Thai food. Yummm."
"MF/D: A little fizzy carbonation wise, bitter/dry finish that lingers pretty well."
"Overall, a good beer. Definitely ont hat shouldn't be overlooked."
"D: Really drinkable IPA. Very enjoyable. Hard to have just the one. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this."
"Sugary grapefruit up front followed by an aggressive tobacco hop bitter. Tobacco hop oil lingers for awhile. Interesting balance between sugary malt and tobacco bitter. I like it."
"This is probably one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted. Have also had this on tap and it's just as good."
"fullbodied but not overly mouthy. good drinkable ipa."
"Drinkability -- At a moderate ABV and good mouth feel, this one goes down preettttaay, prettttaaay, pretty good. I'll probably purchase this one again."
"Quite simply...my favorite beer. Great appearance, awesome hoppy smell, excellent taste, superb mouthfeel, and a drinkability that can go down for the ages. A++ for this beer!!! Quite simply, among my favorites for the regular rotation in my fridge. Not to mention, this brew tastes 10x better coming from a cask conditioned pump straight from the source."
"Just a solid offering."
"I purchased this along with a hop wallop and a storm king, and i look forward to tasting those and more of what victory has to offer."
"Very drinkable yet I will try Victory's other offerings first before I revisit this one."
"Full feeling medium body."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a rocks glass a auburn hue with brief white head. There is a floral hoppiness balanced by a decent amount of malt. The brew could be a little more substantial on the body side of things but is average. Too much malt for my expectation of a ""hopdevil"". I expect a lot from AIPAs as they are often synonymous with DIPAs. There is not a substantial level of hop character and what hop character is present is diminished by the malt content. The malt sweetness is a disappointment for me in this interpretation."
"D- not enjoyable at all"
"perhaps I was expecting too much after loving the hell out of Prima Pils and HopWallop, i guess i figured this one would be of the same 'above average caliber'. i was wrong."
"I can't buy beers from Victory in MO (where I live). If I could, I don't think that I would buy HopDevil over other, more local, options for a balanced IPA. I think that I brought home the wrong six pack of Victory product with me from Illinois. That said, this is a solid beer with a lot of positive attributes going for it. If you want a balanced IPA over an intense hop bomb, then you could do a lot worse than HopDevil."
"Due to the balance, this is a really drinkable IPA. I would have this one again."
"D- One of the more drinkable IPA's I've had in a while. As a southern california resident, I enjoyed the restrained hop profile of this nice IPA as a nice change of pace from the extreme (but tasty) DIPA's that seem to be everywhere out here. Certainly more sessionable."
"D - Good quality east coast IPA. Not as powerful as the West Coasters, but sometimes i prefer this balance when it comes to drinkability."
"BALANCE - many IPAs don't have it, but this one does. Good stuff."
"This is a very solid IPA in a sea of Imperials & Doubles, it's nice to have a real solid IPA."
"Poured from my bottle into my glass the beer is dark orange. With little to no head. The aroma is strong hops a touch of ctirus and malt. The flavor is very nice. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be considering the menacing looking hop cartoon on the bottle. This beer seems to be balanced nicely with malt flavors and a major hop blast. The hop bitterness slaps your taste buds then the malt comes in and smooths things over. Perfect balance. Medium body with fairly mild carbonation. No real sticky hop after taste. This is a top notch IPA. I would highly reccamend this to all my friends."
"D and overall impression: Good scores on drinkability here. 6.7% ABV coupled with the balance of the brew, means I could drink quite a few of these. Overall, another soild offering from Victory. This bottle was pretty fresh, but I would really like to try this on tap to experience Hop Devil at it's freshest. Skal."
"Nice beer"
"Drinkability is very good, but I wouldn't say spectacular."
"Conclusion: Nice, kick you in the face IPA...perfect for when I'm looking for that style of beer, but a bit over-the-top for an every day IPA for me personally"
"I enjoy this IPA quite a bit from Victory. This has just as much emphasis on the malt as it does the hops. Extremely balanced and drinkable, this is well worth seeking out."
"I really love this beer. I will say that it's nothing special when it's past its prime, but fresh--as this particular batch is--it's great. Try it!"
"Poured a beautiful medium amber color with about an inch of white to off-white head. The hop smell is not overpowering, and has a nice sweet/fruit smell, like that of grapefruit possibly a hint of honey. The head reduces to about 1/4 inch as you drink, with a nice amount of lace down the side of the glass. The taste is smooth with a good mouth feel. The hop flavor hits midway through the drink, and continues to the end, leaving a nice hop taste on the back of the tongue. Overall a well done IPA, this beer is drinkable with an ABV of 6.7%, versus other IPAs of the sort that have ABV's of 8% or higher."
"D: Great balance, and exceptional drinkability. Another great offering from Victory."
"Mouthfeel is good and the carbonation is refreshing. Drinkability is better than average."
"served on cask at the victory brewpub in Downingtown, PA.. Ultra smooth and creamy.. the carbonation is totally mellowed out. Huge, big fluffy head is very nice gives you a beer moustache. Aroma is subtle but certainly hoppy. Fresh and a bit sweet. Taste is very creamy, hoppy but very mellow with a clean finish and malt sweetness apparent right behind the hop. Mouth is silky, not heavy at all. The creaminess is quite delightful. It drinks very smooth and is delicious. Becomes a bit filling (especially if drank with food) but is definitely awesome."
"Pours and orangish red with a small white head, with nice clarity. The smell is sweet upfront with tons of hops and some nice subtle citrus notes. Not a very potent smell for an IPA. The taste is bigger than the smell would suggest, hops up front, then some sweet notes, followed by a nice bitter hop flavor. The bitter aftertaste sticks around for awhile. The mouthfeel is smooth, nice carbonation, the flavors have a good balance and are well layered. This is a nice IPA, the bitter doesn't over power or annoy, a nice hophead beer."
"Overall, a fantastic IPA that I will definitely drink again. Would not recommend to someone as their first IPA, but a fantastic brew."
"D: Very. Just...very."
"d- super drinkable and crazy tasty, i could session this easily, although it's got the higher abv it goes down almost too easily, great local beer, definately worth the buy, love this."
"Wine Specialist/$10/Six-pack"
"D: Goes down smooth with a strong aftertaste."
"(D)- A great and enjoyable IPA that has a bit more malt to it than most, but I really enjoy it. A really creamy taste and mouthfeel is very appealing as well."
"I'm really just not a big fan of hoppy beers. However, as far as they go, this one of the ones I've enjoyed the most. The floral taste and aroma goes a long way in mitigating the bitter aftertaste for me. I can imagine that this is an absolute gem for hopheads. If I had to drink a hoppy beer, this would be among my top choices."
"Drink ability is pretty good. For 6.7 it is pretty session able. Overall it is a good IPA, would buy again"
"Drinkability: I downed this beer faster than I do with other beers. Perfect temperature, a fantastic beer, and a taste that does not get old."
"Pours a copper color with a one and a half finger head. The smell is of hops, piney and earthy hops. The scent of hops is almost overwhelming. The taste is a very strong hops the hop taste is more earthy piney hops as opposed to citrus hops. The mouthfeel is dry with little carbonation. Drinkability wise if you really like IPA's you would like this beer. If you are new to IPA's then this ipa isn't for you."
"for the price and quality this is one of the most drinkable ipas available in my area"
"D- The ABV is average for this style which is really meant to be a highly sessionable and thirst quenching. HopDevil hits this aspect of the american IPA right on the head."
"Drinkability is good. I drink this alot of the time now and its probably one of the easiest to drink commercially available IPAs."
"Big thanks to kkulacki for finding this one for me. Pours out a nice orange-yellow color with an off-white bubbly head that lasts quite a while. The smell is amazing - lots of sweet, citrus hops and complexity. The taste was a bit maltier than I expected - tasted mostly like caramel, but then finished off with some bitter hops. I didn't really expect this from an IPA with satanic hop characteristics. I liked it and would drink it again, but I didn't really find it to be a kick-you-in-the-pants, hop-overwhelming IPA."
"HopDevil, Titan IPA and Centennial IPA are my IPA archetypes - they simply nail the style spot on, without doing anything out of the ordinary."
"One of my go-to beers. A fantastic IPA."
"The head retention and carbonation nicely complement the complex IPA. This is a very well crafted IPA that will not disappoint."
"Taste was clearly hoppy up front but those malts kick ass. Citrus flavors come and go with a slight spicy aftertaste/bite. Its not the beer I would want to drink all night long, but pretty GD delicious."
"D--Awesome IPA here, I wasn't hugely impressed at first but once it warmed up to cellar temperature and above the flavor really began to shine. Drinks like a session IPA."
"Overall - A superb IPA... highly recommended..."
"However, the devil took pity on me and his medium build was smooth, almost relaxing. He left me with only thought of the hoppy madness that i was just witnessed, but also with the desire for another encounter with the hoppy devil himself."
"Brick red with an ambery sheen and a smallish beige head, difficult to judge from the English hand-pump pour. Very malty in the nose with lots of toasted grain as well as ripe fruits like cherries and apples that synthesize into a pie-like character. Citric hops combine with dark sugars and an unexpected vanilla note to produce hints of cola. Tastes as it smells, lovely, bready, nutty, and bitter with fruity pear, grape, and grapefruit undertones, a hearty almond flavor and a sharp hop bite. However, it's not so sharp that it cuts through the malts - it mostly just perforates them. A bit thick on the palate, which tips the scales in favor of malty sweetness - this would probably be better served another way so that the carbonation makes more of an impact. Still, a very good quaffer."
"D- This a real solid beer I would like a little more character in the flavors but it drinks very smooth so that somewhat makes up for the lack of complexity. Worth a try I just worry about it being a Victory beer because I have had a lot of consistency problems with their beers."
"overall great beer, and one of the most refreshing I've ever had."
"The taste is not strong but has hops. Some malt and citrus oil but once again a unique beer for the group. Seems to get better after air gets to it. Mouth feel changed after the beer was poured and my drinking of it progressed very oily. Not a lot of carbonation. This beer was a bit of a disappointment to me but not bad."
"D - Easily drinkable for the most part. At the end of the glass my tongue feels a bit briny, but still a pleasant beer."
"Notes: The date on the bottle says to enjoy by 10/09, which I've obviously done, but I can't shake the feeling that something must have ""off"" with this batch. It's not been contaminated per se. Just extremely watery."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorite IPAs. Not only is it local it is always fresh and well balanced. I could drink more than one of these a night and have lost track of how many I've finished off the last few years. If what you are looking for is an IPA without a strong malt backbone look elsewhere, but if you favor IPAs with both bitterness and malt sweetness to balance against the hops, look no further."
"Not sure if I'd call this an IPA, but whatever it is, it is a winner. I'll gladly buy this anytime. Works well as a summer quencher and will be equally enjoyed in the colder months."
"Pours a really nice dark amber, kind of dark copper color. Has small off white head that quickly dissolves fairly fast to a thin layer and still manages to leave lacing on the sides. Smell is pretty typical of the style, hops, citrus, grapefruit the usual things. Smells good, not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good. Taste is differant than what I was expecting. Lingering bitterness in the background, and not nearly as hoppy as what I was expecting and what I would have liked. Seems the citrus comes through quite a bit. Really good mouthfeel and drinkability. Easy to drink and not a high really big ABV. Overall pretty good, not one of the best in my opinion but it's still pretty good."
"For those of you who like their IPAs on the copper/red part of the spectrum, this is a great one."
"an excellent IPA of a murky amber, nice head of white yellow. well hopped... but also well malted. a wonderful range of fruit citrus: lemon, orange, but also apple even... and a mango. the malt is just as bold. bready and not too thick. a bit of toast and butter quality to it like some english style IPA's. excellent rendition. a recommended IPA on my behalf absolutely."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink for such a flavorful, hoppy beer."
"Overall, this was a good IPA for a change. Normally it is all of these DIPAs that are coming out and I hardly drink regular IPAs, so it was nice to get to have one of these. A really good representation to the style and worth a try. I will drink this again."
"Drinkability is pretty high. This isn't the best IPA around, but it's yet another damn good beer from a really fantastic brewery. Victory makes tasty beer and that's all there is to it."
"Had this at the Philly airport. Poured a beautiful bronze/copper color with white head and good lacing. Smelled very hoppy with grapefruit tones. Tasted wonderfully hoppy, bitter. Smooth and mainly clean on the finish, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. So good, I had to have two more before we caught our plane."
"This is a fantastic beer. Thankfully, at least ONE micro-brew in the country understands that you can have a nice IPA without jacking up the alcohol and sugar to bring it into balance. I enjoyed this with some excellent Thai cuisine, and I would gladly drink it on its own anytime! Great job -- highly recommended!"
"While nothing exciting, this is still a good solid IPA, one that is very easy to drink with relatively low alcohol. Unfortunately, there are just too many better IPA's on the market these days, for me ever drink this on more then an occasional basis. Nevertheless, this is still a solid IPA."
"Pours a deep dark amber with plenty of head and sticky lacing. Smell is sticky, citrusy, piny, grassy, green, yellow, orange, yummy and hoppy. Taste is very bitter but has lots of malt to balance. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and resiny. Drinkability is great."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye-Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min-AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"Had my first visit to the Ginger Man in NYC. Asked what the barkeep recommended for an IPA and this was his 2nd recommendation after Stone (which I'd had so I said no). I was pleased. I've had better IPAs but I'd drink it again. Pretty damn drinkable for an IPA."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone out there.Really the Quality shines throughly on this one.I wish My local store sold other varietys from that brewer cause I looked on bottom of carrying sleeve & some other ones they make sounded delicouios!"
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy copper with a half inch frothy, off-white head the bubbled and effervesced right below the cap; good head retention with spotty bands of lacing as the brew recedes. Nose suggests some grapefruity hops, with caramel on a malty backbone, suggesting sweet flavors in the mouth. Taste consistent with nose - some hops upfront, but finishes malty sweet with just a light bitterness that doesn't linger. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a pleasant, consistent background effervescence. Nice drinkability, but this is not your typical IPA. It's a bit too malty and less hoppy than I appreciate in the style."
"Overall, a great IPA. One of my favorites that I am certainly having whenever I ahve the chance."
"D - An insanely drinkable IPA that is strong in all categories... A wonderful brew when your craving some hops, but not looking for an all out hop bomb... Wonderful balance... Simplistic, but wonderful all at the same time..."
"D - I could drink a few of these with no problem. They're well balanced, not too bitter, and not to hot. I do prefer the Hop Wollup though."
"Good IPA, I would buy it again."
"Easily a session beer. Its complexity shines through because the hops, though present in a hefty dose, are not overpowering to the palate."
"Drinkability is good on this one, an overall nice IPA that does not disappoint."
"Clear, reddish amber with a thick, stiff head of foam that leaves heavy duty lace behind. Smell is piney hops, fresh squeezed orange juice and caramel smelling malt. The flavors are really well balanced between sweet caramel malt and resinous hop flavors. Smooth with mild carbonation. A tasty, more balanced than most IPA."
"D=sessionable in my opinion, I could put away a few of these easily. Overall a good offering in the style."
"D: For me not being a hop-head and able to enjoy this beer... that's saying something. Victory has yet to let me down. Good job."
"D: Just a great beer that is always available around here. Even better and more refreshing on tap."
"This one is somehow clean and somewhat simple in the ingredients used, yet at the same time a pretty complex brew. This is an IPA that every hophead needs to try."
"D - Very delicious and drinkable brew overall. Nice complexity of flavors that all balance out well. I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting, even at 7%."
"This could very well be the most drinkable ipa I've ever tasted. The pour was a great amber color with a full inch of sticky white head. It had a bready floral hoppy smell. The taste isn't quite as devilish as expected but it has a bit of a hoppy bite. Perhaps the name comes from the 6.7 abv but otherwise we may have a small case of mislabeling here but whatever. The mouthfeel is smooth smooth smooth."
"Medium body, smooth, clean and very easy to drink. Overall maybe the second best American IPA I have had, right after Bell's Two Hearted."
"The resins, once they coat your palate, really go well with the bready/caramel undertone of this beer, turning these normally flawed features in an IPA into a godsend. Still, the hop-profile is nicely complex. The hops did not seem quite as fresh as those in the Ruination, but this could be due to distribution. Also, there is a distinct peppery flavor to this beer: good, but not as good as fresh hops. Either way, this is one terrific IPA."
"Very drinkable beer, maybe my favorite IPA to date."
"I got this for $1.69 at my local grocery store and I know that sixers aren't too expensive. This is now my personal go-to dose of hops."
"D - Would be a favorite to session. Though the name puts an emphasis on hops, I could never get sick of this beer."
"So far, my favorite East Coast IPA by a long shot. With a somewhat similar hop profile, I think this is the beer Torpedo SHOULD be."
"Worth a try."
"Titanic. Big and assertive, but with no pine burn. Can challenge any West Coast IPA. A classic."
"Overall, a great hop-extreme beer. The alcohol level allows this as a multiple beer taster. Worth a try for sure."
"D-very enjoyable ipa, gotta love the Hop Devil, I could keep a case of this one around the house anytime..."
"Drinkability: Very high - the alcohol is pretty well masked in the taste and the taste is really great. Not a bad combination."
"D- Pretty decent IPA that is crisp and well balanced. Victory's Hop Wallop is better but also quite a bit stronger."
"Another one of those beers that has come so close to having the perfect amount of hops! This beer is by far on the top 10 list that my roommates and myself created. Great flavor with out any of the baggage, I've had hoppy beers that taste kind of on the sweeter side - not this one. Great job Victory!"
"D - Feel free to drink a bunch of these at 6.7 a 6 pack will set you free"
"D- I could definitely make a session out of these. Nice IPA."
"this ipa pours the classic orange color with a good head and lacing thru-out.the smell is hops and citrus,grapefruit,grass ,pine and malt its all there its good...the taste is the same a very easy drinking ipa with all the ingredients and styles you want/like..this is just a good ipa..in a market with so many to choose from..hop devil is not my first choice but is a worthy and good representation of the style one i will recommend"
"This is very drinkable."
"D: Decent brew, if you like amber's, this is a decent one."
"A ton of hop bitterness, but suprisingly well balanced. A very good beer."
"D- I would like this all the time...wait a minute I might have to start putting this into my current rotation."
"D- A nice IPA, but seems middle of the road in the popular saturated IPA market currently. The beer is drinkable, yes - but not my first choice if I want an American IPA. I think it represents the style well, though."
"D - two down four to go"
"Would definitely drink again."
"This beer poured copper with a single-finger head and some visible carbonation. The smell is a bit of malt and a bunch of really nice citrus and floral hops. Gee, I wonder how this beer got its name. The taste starts off with a huge mashup of hop flavor with a surprisingly low amount of bitterness. There's some pine, grassy, citrus, and floral hops. There's some malt in there, but it's desperately trying to hold its own against the hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a medium amount of carbonation. This beer is definitely not going to be for everyone, but if you're a fan of hops there's no reason not to try it."
"Aside from the slightly overbearing ABV, this would be easy to drink a lot of. I would probably prefer a different IPA most of the time, but this is good stuff."
"D: Pretty high, although it would depend on price. This is the kind of thing I wouldn't mind keeping around the hose for normal drinking, if it were locally available at a fair price. I wouldn't trade for it though."
"cheers"
"Final Thoughts - Decent entry from Victory. Different looking IPA that goes down smooth."
"Another great Victory beer, well balanced, easy to enjoy, and quite satisfying without too high of an abv. Also a great bargain versus its similarly priced competition."
"Notes: I've read that the late Michael Jackson was a big fan of Victory's HopDevil, and after tasting it I can see why. This is definitely one of my favorite American IPA's to date, but only time (and more beer!) will tell if it can hold its position. The boys at Victory have done it again, and they continually establish themselves as power players in the American craft beer scene. Victory for my taste [buds]? You bet."
"Serving type: bottle"
"when i first started drinking these i used to feel more of a bite from the hops - i can drink a lot of these, easy - good stuff."
"D - This is a beer that could tempt you to have one too many. A moderate alcohol content is hidden by the hops, though. It's crisp and clean and if the hop bitterness doesn't overwhelm your palate, you'll drink more than one. This is also a good beer to introduce the IPA style to the uninitiated - it has all the hoppy goodness, but the moderate malt flavor may prevent one from equating 'IPA' with 'soap' as I once did."
"Man this is a really good beer. One of my favs. These hop oils linger, and they're well balanced in the mouth. This Victory company really knows what they're doing..."
"The carbonation in this beer seems to float, suspended in its amber red beauty, sort of like fine dust particles flying through the sun lit air of a warm childhood memory. Smells like spring time, and hops... mostly hops though... im sure they're either cascade or centennial... but im not sure, maybe a mix. A strong hop attack, all at once, all of a sudden. I get the malt flavor too, a bit tannic, but has a nice roasted, burnt flavor that I can totally deal with... In fact, I like that in this beer, the toasted malt complements the hop characteristics... A lot can be said on the floral, citrus, and grapefruit notes of the hops, but the main point of this beer is that its over balanced, hop wise. (note the name: hop devil) Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from the name, along with drinkability of an IPA. Good American IPA... ive seen nothing but good things out of Victory."
"Suitable body with lots of nice carbonation."
"Overall Impression: A fine beer that embodies all that is good with American IPAs. The American hops show up in the aroma and taste. It is balance towards the hops, as expected and yet the malt is not over powered."
"I could drink many glasses of this without batting an eye. I can't say that for a lot of other IPA's that I've tried. For an East Coast person that has limited access to West Coast IPA's, which are more numerous and generally higher in caliber, this beer is a winner. It ranks up there with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA as my favorite ""local"" IPA. I also recommend Troegs Hopback Amber Ale."
"One of my favorite IPA's, right along with DFH 90 and Green Flash!"
"This is a bit to bitter for myself. I prefer a little more sweetness balanced with hops. If you like hops then this beer id for you."
"The first thing that hits you upon the taste is the hop citrusy sweetness...almost overwhelming pineapple and grapefruit tartness. The finish is slightly dry with hop bitterness at the end. You have to be a hop head (which I defiantly am) to enjoy this beer. If you prefer sweeter European brews then you won't be as enthralled with this beer. Either this beer and DFH 90 IPA is always in my frige...they're neck and neck to me."
"- Easy to drink.. just might be a bit bitter and sour for some, but an overall drinkable ale.. great upfront balance.. malt fades.. leaves huge hop bite. Overall not too bad. Would buy others before this though."
"Overall: Great beer! I'm a huge IPA fan but have never had this one. I will be adding this to my permanent rotation. Check it out!"
"Completely recommend this beer. I will be chasing down a sixpack of this very soon."
"A good brew but not outstading. Hops do not flow together with the sweeter malt the is present as one might expect from a IPA with it's color and malt profile and tend to be more on the harsh end."
"It's okay but I won't be ordering it again. There are much better options available."
"An outstanding offering from Victory and one I can't think how I've overlooked. I'll certainly be back for more."
"Small light tan head and a dark orange body. Malty sweetness and grapefruit in the aroma. Whole mess of pine in the taste. More bitterness and pine flavors than I expected it to have. Really good though."
"On tap, this beer poured a dark orange color with a nice 1 finger head. There was plenty of lacing. It had an aroma of hops, pine, citrus, and malts. I found that the taste matched the smell. The hops were not overpowering. They actually complemented the malts very nicely. The carbonation was very nice as well. This was a good beer but I felt that it was lacking something. I would seek it out again on tap as it is a great session beer."
"D: Not one I am going to buy again. I have never been a fan of IPA's but I am always up for trying something new, and lately the 60 min and 90 min IPA's have been turning my head, so I figured I'd go for this one.. Just doesn't have the balance that I want.."
"Not the best IPA I've ever had, but a pretty damn good rendition."
"D"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Unibroue tulip glass, just because. Color is a lighter shade of amber. Head is about an inch thick and hangs around for a while, as does the lacing. Smells balanced between hops and malt. Noticable floral and citrus aromas. Tastes really good. Hoppy like an IPA should be. A definite citrus taste to it (grapefruit). A nice pine taste as well. Not a real strong hoppy bite, but plenty of hops in there. A nice bitterness rounds out the taste. Medium mouthfeel. A bit fizzy. A bit sticky. Leaves my teeth chomping for more. Goes down nice and easy. A very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable."
"Out of a bottle this beer was an orange-amber color with good clarity. The head was beige, rather small and didn't display very good retention and only spotty lacing. The aroma was excellent for the style, lots of herbal and citrus hops with a pale malt backbone. The flavors were at first notably bitter, with lots of orange rind and grapefruit notes, but behind that lurked the flavors of other hops clearly reflecting the multiple additions used. As it warmed I tasted more of the doughy malt along with some crystal malt and the herbal elements of hops that came through. Acidic and a little biting; great for hop heads. The body was medium, the carbonation very good and the mouthfeel soft and just a little oily. Distinctly bitter but sessionable and a good All-American example."
"Overall: Good mouthfeel, well carbonated with a bit of oiliness. Drinkability is a bit down for me due to the overwhelming unpleasant hop flavor which I personally found to be unappealing."
"Overall not a huge fan of the whacked out mega-hop beer craze, so I came in skeptical. However, I really enjoyed this beer. It seems the hops were added to a level that enhances the beer, not just to claim a high IBU to keep up with the Joneses. Well done brew!"
"I enjoy Victory's beers, and this is yet another great brew."
"D- Pretty drinkable."
"an A+ beer for sure"
"Drinkability is pretty good. I remember liking this more, and I know this bottle got hot for a couple hours in my car, and that could have messed it up. So I'll rereview it if I like it better next time."
"The drinkability is very nice, I can toss back quite a few of these without my mouth feeling overwhelmed."
"D - The balance and lightness of this beer make it very very drinkable, not to mention refreshing. I highly recommend this beer, one of the better I have had in a while."
"The beer has always been a solid and afforable choice for an IPA. I recall the beer being less balanced in the past; perhaps my affinity for hops has made even those beer which pack a punch seem less agressive than they once did. Either way, still an excelent beer that I return to often."
"Overall I will buy fresh ones of this as long as I can get it. A very good IPA."
"D - I don't particularly like the grassy, spicy hop profile here. Quite a bit of very sweet malts, not a very pleasant balance."
"Nose was slight but stands up to typical IPA standard. Taste-wise was quite good with the second sip of the session better than the first. Citrus and slightly bitter, nice hop-flavor and enjoyable to drink."
"As for an IPA I would suggest, and rate quite high."
"D- The beer is incredibly drinkable, perfect light carbonation blends with the great taste to make a super smooth beer. Hopdevil goes down easy."
"I would call this beer very drinkable. I would have no problem sitting through an afternoon of these. The hops are a bit over the top - but in a good way. Cheers!"
"D: A standard, now, among American IPA's, enjoyable through and through."
"D: I could probably drink more of these due to the malt backbone preventing undue palette crushingness, but it isn't what I look for in an IPA"
"D- A step above sessionable this devil is quite drinkable while not being to forward with any ingredient. The name suits the drink, as if this were called hoppy devil, the outcome might be misleading. A good local to go to from time to time. I can't wait for wild devil."
"This is my first product from Victory, will definately try some others."
"Drinkability - Could get past the first few sips let alone a whole beer."
"OVERALL very easy drinker, but a little thin in flavor. Sessionable."
"Appears a nice gold. Smells a bit weak, but obviously hops are present with pine being the most prevalent of scents. Tastes comparable to Stone's regular IPA offering, which I do like. Just missing..something that I can't put my finger on."
"Some say it's an acquired taste. I don't believe that."
"A nice IPA, easy drinking and not too extreme. There are better examples out there but a nice choice when you don't want something crazy or a good choice to share with non-beer fanatic friends."
"On cask through the handpump at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a dark amber that is a bit hazy. The beer has a wonderful head, especially for cask ale, huge and creamy and off white that leaves some nice lacing. Smells bitter with leafy hops and a rich bitter earthiness, and a touch of grainy sourness. The taste exhibits a nice deep bitterness and an earthy richness as well as a hoppy, creamy finish which is unique to the cask in my estimation. Nice mouthfeel, creamy and dry with a slight graininess. Absolutely delicious, and even better on cask."
"Poured an orange and reddish color with a fast fading head. Smell floral hops and sweet caramel malts. Taste is similar to smell with a nicely balanced beer. Not overly hoppy but more than enough for me. Good carbonation on what I would say is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is high in my opinion. Very good beer."
"4.0 D: Intense hop bitterness brings out the hophead in me, which makes this very drinkable."
"A solid IPA. Very Drinkable and at $8.99 for a 6-pack, I will be drinking this beer often, especially on the days when I think I can't dish out the extra dough for a Stone IPA 6-pack."
"An aggressive pour into a pint glass, a three inch head emerges, almost overflows the glass. I've had this delectable brew before, but this is the first time i'm reviewing it. HopDevil is among my favorite brews, but this is an older bottle so its freshness might force me to go out and buy another six pack to review. Oh well, still a great IPA. Minutes after the intial pour, there's still a one inch frothy head and considerable lacing on the glass. Smell is just average with the older bottle, and taste, mouthful and drinkability are a bit above average. I guess I will have to review this again. Still, a very good offering from Victory."
"not too disappointed, but the 'hop devil' moniker had me prepared for more than advertised."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable IPA. I'd call this one a great entry- or mid-level Pale Ale. Very inviting. I'm not sure if I'd have called this one a ""devil"". It actually makes one not accustomed to IPAs hesitant to drink it, even though it's a very accessible beer."
"highly encourage you to read this review if you'd like to try an american ipa you've never had (despite its horrible labeling)...you'll appreciate this beer and would advise ordering at least 3 to fully enjoy what hopdevil has to offer..."
"Good mouthfeel nice carbonation. This is a great tasting IPA not too overpowering but just a nice sessionable beer."
"One of the best beers I've tried for a good while."
"d: great balance of malt/hops, still strong on hops but malty enough to drink multiples of. one of my favorite IPAs, this is one i should always have on hand."
"Future outlook: Decent, but pretty run of the mill. With so many great drinks to be had, I won't seek this one out, other than to perhaps try again when extremely fresh."
"Drinkability: Very nice IPA. A good balance between hops and sweetness makes this one easy to drink and very enjoyable. Definitely a keeper."
"Drinkability- AMAZING, simply put amazing. A decent alcohol level but still so hidden in a perfectly balanced flavor. This is a beer I will seek again not occasionally but often. A great beer, too me damn near if not perfection."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Corey"
"This is a medium orange color with a finger of head. Not as fluffy as Hop Wallap, but it leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells mildly of pine, citrus, and malt. Tastes mainly of malt and a hint of citrus, but leans more in the direction of an amber ale than an IPA. Carbonation is just about right, and overall this is a very drinkable beer. A little milder than most IPAs, with more amber characteristics than I expected, but still nothing to complain about."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint. Hazy golden-orange with a medium sticky head. Opening the bottle releases the full aroma of pine resin and grapefruit citrus, it intensifys through the pour. Nosing the glass reveals a slight vegital earthiness. The first sip hammers the mouth with hoppy spice which competes with a sweet side of citrus and burnt brown sugar. There is also a hint of yeasty rustic bread. Did I mention the deep pine burn of the hops? Crisp in the mouth, neither thin nor overly thick, the overall drinkability belies the 6.7abv. For an extreme hophead, this is a session beer."
"D - Very drinkable due to the restrained, yet ever present, IPA hop character. Have had multiple times on draught and bottled. Will buy every now and then because it's ""menacingly delicious""."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber, barely transparent, with a thick beige head. Decent aroma is hoppy and has evergreen and yeasty tones. Flavor is fiercely hoppy with a considerable yeasty overtone, not too much bitterness, and even a sweet hint. Texture is smooth and lively, leaving a satisfying finish."
"Drinkability: Finally starting to venture more into Victory's beers. This one a decent IPA, but given the name I would have expected more of an DIPA. I understand Hop Wallop is their DIPA, have to check it out."
"Cheers!!!"
"Recommended"
"D - A very good IPA, didn't dethrone my beloved Torpedo, but still a good offering"
"This beer has a rich amber color and the artwork on the bottle of the hop devil was really awesome. Victory always has good artwork for the record. It has a tea like citrus aroma. The taste is of a very earthy hearty happy hop. ""I can taste the happiness more than anything"". It has a very smooth feeling rushing past my tounge and down my throat. Very minimal carbonation factor. Overall a great beer to enjoy on a wintery afternoon."
"A fantastic IPA. I'm not a huge fan of east coast IPAs but this one hits the mark. The sweetness and fruitiness of the malt is countered perfectly by the fresh hop zing and aroma. My favorite east coast IPA so far, i love it!"
"Anyone can make a super bitter beer, just as anyone can paint on a canvas."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with spicy snacks or meals."
" Not a great IPA, mostly because of the lack of stinging hop character. However, definitely a good beer that I could handle a few of in each sitting."
"Big huevos. Big taste for the American IPA. Well-done for Victory."
"A great modern East Coast IPA. I love this stuff."
"Deep burnt orange color with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. A musty, earthy hop nose. A few sips and it hits me that I'm getting a strong dosage of aged cheese, maybe gouda, and maybe a little spoiled milk. A hint of smoke, though I may be confusing the aged cheese scent for smoke. Interestng, though not typical for an IPA. Not sure what to make of this so far. Taste is a little underwhelming up front. Hops are present in the palate, but don't match the smell in strength. Finsih finally brings the hops out the citrusy hop flavors, with a nice lingering bitterness. I am really a big hop head, so I tend to be rough of run-of-the-mill IPAs, that have just basic hoppiness. I'd put this beer in that category. Mouthfeel is light, with a little oily, creamy, texture. Decent IPA, but not the one for me. Not to worry, there are plenty of IPAs in the sea."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a rigorous, thick velvety head -- doesn't look much like your typical IPA, which should have tipped me off that something wasn't quite right. Nose is a dominating raw maltiness with the characteristic floral hops nearly absent. The taste does not add much complexity; very little hop bitterness follows. Where exactly is this hop devil hiding? Maybe I'm spoiled by the hop blasts I'm used to from the American IPAs, but this one just isn't done to style. Overall, a pleasant but one-dimensional beer."
"6.7% ABV, medium mouthfeel. Enjoyable"
"D: For being so far into the hop spectrum this one is a nice beer to drink more than one, not the best hoppy IPA, but still a damn fine beer all around. I could easily drink three or four in one sitting."
"Mouthfeel is slick and oily and goes down very smooth. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Leaves a wonderful bitter, hoppy finish. Very drinkable, downing a few pints in timely fashion would be no problem. Alcohol is very well masked. Great brew."
"A very good beer. There only a few better IPA's out there, this is definitely worth seeking out."
"I am immediately surprised by the balance of flavors. While the hop flavor is dominant, the biscuity malt is also present. This is not your typical hop bomb where all you taste is pure hops. There is also a wave of citrus that washes through the mouth and helps add to the clean taste of the beer. Although the beer ranks at 6.7% abv., the alcohol is masked nicely."
"Overall this beer is best when fresh. Drinkability is off the charts as each one goes down better than the last one. Such a damn drinkable quality stellar IPA that shines when fresh. Don't drink those bottles with date codes almost expiring, get em fresh folks."
"I drank probably five tonight, and I was pretty happy after that, hahaha... It has 6.8% alcohol, so be careful with it on an empty stomach. Despite the bittering, it was easy to put many down in a short time period. Very drinkable for such a mouth-puckering brew."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and has a smooth finish that is a bit spiky with some hop bitterness. There is a nice drinkable feel to this beer that is smoother than expected since the bitterness is muted."
"Pours a transparent amber hue with bubbly white head that leaves a little lacing. Brew retains a sweet aroma of wet hops, bread notes, and some earthiness. HopDevil has one aggressive personality, rich in hit and run hop attack that builds to a crescendo while in the palate and then leaves the tongue refreshed with mild dryness. There's some spice with the bread crumbs also. Crisp smoothness in body and characterized by malty goodness throughout the drink. Highly drinkable session beer worth having all year around in the fridge."
"D: This a great IPA, one of the best I've tried. Easy to drink and full of flavor and character."
"Beautiful amber-orange color with a frothy head and lots of lacing, bubbles mildly active and slight cloud to it. Sweet nose of spices, cooking bread, mandarin orange, turns hoppier as it warms, deep but not especially penetrating feel. Full-bodied, bitter in spite of a softer underbelly, hops still outdistancing the malts, albeit some roasty notes appear at the end. Orange and white grapefruit citrus with fewer baking spices here. Suggestion of pine tar along with generalized herbaceousness. Carbonation goes a long way to making a whole glass drinkable. Intensely aggressive beer."
"pours a clear amber color with an off white heading. This brew is alive ladies and gents.Very nice carbonation and great lacing. Grapefruit is immediate up front with very dry citrusy hops. Taste is dry and bitter but not overpowering also a kind of nutty aftertaste. A highly recommended IPA."
"D: Another fine offering from Victory. I like this one, but it just doesn't seem to add up to the sum of its parts. That's not to say it isn't a great beer, but it seems a bit more like an aggressively hopped English IPA. Not a bad thing, but not quite what I was expecting."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA for 2 reasons, the obvious addition of good malt adds to the spark of this beer, it's not just some overly hopped brew that is going to burn the back of your throat, and the brew has some good characteristics taste wise to keep this beer interesting. An excellent interpretation of the IPA style and I will defintley look for more of this in the future."
"Thick, fresh cask of hops. Chilled wort... flame out and/or dry hopped? Heiroglyphic cling around the pint glass with a juicy, Mars surface head. Spicy aroma above a crystal clear, dark amber body. Efficient retention. Malt body appears then disappears into a warming, light booze. A dark, sharp cherry appears with the ABV. A bitter bite as it warms. The devil would have the best of me during a session. Proud American IPA."
"D - The bitterness is just a bit too strong to be a session beer. The ABV is on the higher side, but not to the point that I would find this hard to drink more than a few. The beer is not really all that filling fortunately."
"i dig this brew. Heck yes."
"Overall: This is a well made American IPA by Victory Brewing Company. Their interpretation works well to pair with many occasions and foods. A great IPA to enjoy while watching the game, with some barbeque, or for a quick hop fix!"
"Overall a very solid IPA from Victory. Hoppier than I expected it to be. Very good beer though. Definitely recommend it."
"Would only buy if I were in the mood for a hoppy evening."
"D - Great."
"Very tasty, the nose is not quite as powerful as it should, but plenty of bitterness to back it up. Seems pretty straight up, no crazy malt character or hop profile, but well done. Should satisfy most hopheads."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. This is a long time favorite of mine. I find it nicely balanced and bold at the same time. There is the malt sweetness and toasted grain aromas. This is countered with the grassy and pine smell from the hops. The taste is the same. Caramel sweetness and slight roastedness appear up front but this quickly takes a back seat. Stepping up are the hops. Spicy hops and earthy flavors from the hops take over in the aftertaste. The body is medium which is what you would expect from the style. This beer is a staple of sorts. Always easy to reach for when not sure what to get."
"A clear caramel color brew with a medium off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma is mild citrus hops with a firm yeasty malt base. The flavor is nice orange peel hops with a bit of malt blended in. A smooth mid-bodied beauty that is very drinkable. Pleasantly carbonated, just an overall agreeable choice with fair hops presence to appeal to most anyone that appreciates some bitterness to their beer. Recommended."
"Not a bad beer at all. Really a good IPA to bring a newby in on, quite mild. I just didn't care for the earthy smell it carried with it."
"PS: I wish this beer was legal in MS"
"Dark amber pour with a medium sized off white head. The power is in the spices here, big spicy flavor right up front fading to a hoppy finish in the back end. Also one of the best smelling IPAs I've ever had. A glorious winner all around, all hail Victory!"
"Overall: If you like the flavor of hops, this is the way to go. Nice, refreshing beer that can cut through practically anything. Like paint thinner... FOR YOUR MOUTH."
"Verdict: With a solid malt backbone balanced perfectly with brilliant hops, HopDevil is one of the best IPAs that I've tried yet. I'm very much looking forward to trying the other Victory offerings I can get my hands on here in Houston."
"A clear copper color pour.with a generous white head that receded slowly and left rings of lacing. The aroma was butter, caramel, citrus and pine with citrus being the most dominant fragrance. The flavor was more malt forward than I anticipated, mostly caramel but overall it was nicely balanced against the citrus and pine hops. Mouthfeel was very nice,good crisp finish,drinkable for sure."
"a great borderline session beer for anyone, and a great beer for people that wanna get more into IPA's and DIPA's... really good on the pump too"
"D: A great citrusy and dry flowery hopped ipa backed by an equally huge dry toasted munich backbone makes this a standout. Leaves your tongue dry and anxious for the next sip."
"Poured into tulip glass. Pours a deep red with very little head. Some retention on the glass but not much. Very citrusy hoppy smell. Taste is very hoppy with citrus undertones. Dry mouthfeel with lingering sour hop aftertaste in a good way. Very drinkable, will buy again for sure."
"This beer pours a light, clear orange amber colour, with a few fingers of pillowy white head, which sticks around for more than a few minutes, and leaves a fair amount of soap bubble lacing around the glass. It smells faintly of grapefruit hops, and not much else, even as it warms. The taste starts with a grassy, flinty hop dryness, that moves to include more resinous pine bitterness, before washing over a thin caramel malt backbone to the lip-smackingly dry hop finish. The carbonation is understated, allowing the hops to remain the star of this show. The body is a wee bit less than full, but, for the style, I suppose it is just right. There is no noticeable warming from the elevated alcohol. For the strong, but not overpowering, hop goodness, and the smooth mouthfeel, this is quite a decently drinkable IPA."
"So when my boss took us out to lunch today, I jumped at the chance to try it on his dime. I'm glad I did! Smooth, tasty and definitely lives up to its name when it comes to hops!"
"Overall, a great example of an excellent IPA and at $7-$8 a sixer much cheaper than some of it's fellow east coast brethen (60 minute IPA comes to mind). Will definitely purchase again."
"7/3/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"(rated Mar 28, 2007)"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a slightly hazy, dark-amber honey. When poured, it produced a big 2 finger, white rocky head that left an ample amount of sticky lacing. The aroma has a pronounced citrus kick but doesn't really lend itself to the naming of any specific fruit. Also the malt backbone makes its presence known in the aroma. The flavor follows suit with a nice crisp grapefruit bite followed by a nice malty kick. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation and leaves a nice resiny coating on the palate. This is a good IPA. Something I would love to try again."
"Drinkability: A very nice IPA, well worth its reputation."
"Pours a hazy copper orange into my goblet, with a half-finger off-white head which quickly recedes to a spotty film over the body of the beer. Aroma is orange, citrus, piney hops, with malt detectable as well. Mouthfeel is slippery and a little oily, despite the medium carbonation. Taste is a good balance of malt and hops, pine, citrus, fruity sweetness, with definite sharpness in the finish. I do not know much about IPAs, but this is one of the better that I have had. Drinkability is moderate to high for me, although I am not a hop lover by any stretch."
"Overrated. Pours clear brown with a minimal off-white head. Aroma is hoppy, but more malty than anything else. Kind of a prelude to the taste. The hops and malts were unbalanced, and both tended to take away from each other. This is an IPA for people who don't like strong, hoppy IPAs."
"Overall a tasty hop driven ale."
"The lacing and head retention of this IPA was great. Taste was of pine and spice. I had this right around the holidays so the taste fit right in with the cold weather. Alcohol content was just right and obscured by the rounded flavor. Very easy to drink and quick for a buzz. It was a bit on the bitter side of course, so the more I drank, the more I wished I had a less hoppy beer to pace with. A good example of the style."
"D: Being more familiar with West Coast IPA's I thought this was a very solid and pleasurable effort. Easily drinkable. Wish I would have picked up more then just one. Acid King was the backdrop for this tasting."
"Pours a deep orange with a nice rocky white head resting on the top. Good retention and fair lacing/webbing. I take a whiff of this and the first thing I notice is a strong peppery spiciness to this. Some mild hops. Really is lacking in the scent dept. Nice hoppy bitterness coats the mouth with a hint of spiciness. This brew feels warm in my stomach. Crisp and clean. Not that bad, but almost too bitter. Lacks the citrus complement that I enjoy in an IPA. Good, but just shy of great."
"Pours a dark brown color. Medium sized head, slightly off-white, diminishing. Strong aroma of hops, some malts. Bitter-sweet taste of hops, unnaturally bitter. Later taste - semi-sweet taste, clean finish. Not all that hoppy."
"Overall this is a nice drinkable IPA have one if you can"
"I was definitely ready for a change of pace when this one was finished."
"D: While not a session beer, I can certainly have a couple before my taste buds begin to give out."
"Drinkability: I don't like they rye with the hops. Still a nice beer but could be better."
"IF YOU LIKE HOPS, TRY THIS BEER. Great beer, full of hops, good quality. If you like other pale ales this is one to try."
"Could have been stuck with a bad batch, tried this beer again and it impressed me more."
"Thanks to kegatron and jctribe35 for sending one of these for the NFL Survival LIF. This bottle is stamped best by Dec 30 08. Poured into McChouffe tulip. Pours a translucent amber orange. 2"" sticky looking frothy rocky-topped orange-tinted head. Leaves spotty clumps of lace. Aroma is of clean floral and spicy hops, notes of sweet malt come through. Taste is very hoppy up front, spicy on the tip of the tongue. A little more malty on the midpallate. Finishes very spicy, with a long resinous finish. High carbonation gives it a medium-full mouthfeel, frothy, creamy, soapy on the finish. Easy drinking for fans of hops."
"D: Gimme more."
"I am partial to this beer because it is a local favorite of mine. Pours a nice dark amber color with a thick, foamy white head that settles into a slight lacing. Aroma is dominated by citrus and earthy hops with slight roasted malt hints. Very well-balanced quaffable IPA with a nice malt backbone to counter the bitterness from the hops."
"D: Certainly. No off flavors in this brew at all, doesn't taste like it would eat your teeth away after a few. I could sit down with quite a few at some point, and probably will."
"D - A good AIPA, but to me, not the best showcase of the style. Could use a smidge more malt up front to give a better initial footing on the journey into bittnerness. Tasty, but it doesn't leave me aching for another."
"I can drink 4 or 5 of these...then I'm good."
"Poured an amber orange color, and foamed up quite nicely in a shaker glass. The inch or so of foam lasted a few minutes and some of clung to the glass as a sipped. The brew smelled a little caramel and piney. I liked the balance between the slightly caramel malt and the earthy, piney, and slightly citrus hops. While it's certainly bitter, I find this very drinkable compared to some of the West Coast IPA's that just hit you over the head with a bunch of hops. I look forward to picking up a few bottles of this every time I venture out to the east coast where it is a lot easier to find than in the SF Bay area."
"Has a strong citrus hop aroma with some difinite caramel aroma in there too. This beer has pretty cool amber color but the head and lacing did not show up as good as I hoped. The flavor is fantastic though. It has a lot of spicy and citrus flavored hops as was expected from the name. It does not lack anything in malt flavor either. Its mouthfeel doesn't really stand out but it isn't light either. This beer has good drinkability. I can see my self downing a six pack of it."
"thanks to tadowdaddy for this"
"Overall; a simple, but very drinkable, IPA."
"GC"
"Overall I just wish there was a little more sweet and slightly less bitter to make it more enjoyable to me. Something I would drink occasionally, but probably not seek out to purchase."
"D=high this beer does a good job of not making the hops overpowering despite the name. Very enjoyable beer, can't wait till football is on"
"D - Heck yes. Just for the taste alone. No need to twist my arm. Fantastic."
"Poured into a glass from a 12oz bottle. So this is my first experience with an IPA, the color is a beautiful dark amber with some visible carbonation under a light tan head that quickly fades to almost nothing. The nose is grapefruit. Period. So is the taste. Somewhere in there is a light malt, caramel maybe? Very faint but there nonetheless. The feel is rather thinner than I was expecting yet not bad. The drinkability is rather fair in my opinion, not something I'd run out for but it's pleasant enough that a coupla these aren't the worst thing that could happen to a person at the end of the workday. Sayonara."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a great beer that I could drink several of during a football game or some other event. That being said, there are ALOT of IPA's out there, and this is good, but not my favorite."
"D - Low/medium to to the hops ripping your face off. :)"
"Another excellent brew from Victory...still haven't found one from these guys that I don't love."
"A very nice IPA overall!"
"An excellent well-balanced IPA."
"D - Midway through this beer I got the warm feeling. I could drink a few of these but then I would be intoxicated."
"Pours a golden hazy orange color with a nice white head that stuck around until the end. Smelled of citrusy hops. Tasted about the same as the scent, a very smooth and crisp hop taste with some good background citrus flavors. Small hop bite on the tongue as it finishes, with a decent aftertaste.. not the best. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good, a small zing on my tongue but nothing unexpected. Overall I like this IPA compared to most others."
"This is one of my favorite American IPA's. It is absolutley delicious. Pours a dark copper, almost red with an awesome white head. This beer has excellent lacing to it also. Has an strong aroma of citrus and hops and has a very slightly bitter taste that is perfect. This beer has an awesome drinkability. Nice burpability also. Great over all beer a must try."
"The flavor of at least two hops and mild malt notes. A full bodied mild easy drinking beer. It has a complex taste that has about 3 levels- hops, malt, hops. Its a great beer and the most friendly IPA I have encountered so far."
"D- It's to bad this isn't 5%, as it'd be one hell of session beer. Regardless, this is very tasty. It wasn't much of an IPA, but definitely a tasty pale."
"I'm just starting to get back into IPAs and this is one I probably won't be buying again. It's a pretty, fragrant, cleanly brewed hop water if you ask me. There is almost no balance to this thing whatsoever. It definitely has all the hops you could want, but I just get the feeling that I'm drinking some bitter, fermented dextrose."
"d: Used to be one of my favorites, this was my first one in long time. I still like it but I prefer a little less maltiness in my IPAs now."
"If this beer was more easily found here in Portland, and a couple bucks cheaper it'd be standby for me, probably. However its price affects my drinkability score a bit... I'll probably wait until this one goes on sale again."
"A pretty damn good IPA, but not quite great. Sure to revisit this one sometime down the road."
"The mouth feel of this beer is great, it is not overly heavy, and not overly boddied for an IPA, it is very drinkable, and I enjoyed this one very much!"
"Served: in a standard pint glass."
"this is a good ipa. I had it on cask at the victory brewpub. It had a nice coppery color. low carbonation due to the cask. thin head which disappated quickly. The aroma was a piney hop scent, nothing else. Taste was warm but over the top hop flavor. that resiney hop flavor that makes you pucker like kissing your grandma. thick mouthfeel with medium drinkability. a good effort."
"I'm amazed at the balance. This is quite hoppy but somehow has a mild caramel sweetness; and neither detracts from drinkability, together or individually. Medium bodied with a lingering sweet floral finish. Only catching the slightly breath- warming alcohol at the end after the last few swallows."
"Taste is very similar to the smell department, a hoppy beer that is well balanced with caramel malt, good carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel."
"For whatever reason the nose puts me off a little. Pours nicely and retains it's head till the end. Malty, and nicely bitter, with no overwhelming floral overtones.You like Resiny, piney IPA's this one is that. Always good, always drinkable, and having one on tap is the rel tribute to this brew. I'm not sure what the original IPA brewed in England tasted like, but I suppose this one might be close. Any Philliies fans out there, you know you can get it on tap in Ashburn Alley and behind Sec 210 in bottles."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass a cloudy amber orange color with a half inch white foam head that reduces to a minimal sheen and some spotty lacing. I could smell the sweet fruity hopspice when I poured it. The taste is a battle between the hops and sweet malts that is easily won by the hops. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste but just enough to send you back for another sip of sweet nectar. Has a medium feel and a fantastic balance. I will buy this again and drink many, many more of these."
"Without a doubt a very enjoyable brew. The quality IPA's that I have had in the last couple weeks have almost turned the style into my new favorite."
"Tan-peach color minimal head opaque. Nose is honeyed malt and hop bitterness. Taste is similar with some apple orange citrus. Hop bitterness in finish. Mouthfull is full but very carbonated Drinkability is moderate due to significant hop presence in finish."
"This beer is in my top 5 for favorite beers all time for sure. Just a wonderfully crafted IPA that is available everywhere in my area for about $8-9/6 pack. It's a hop head delight with nice bitterness and such. It's well balanced and the alcohol is so well hidden its scary. If you haven't tried this yet, please do. Also, sweet logo on the bottle."
"D - wonderful tasting IPA, warming for the winter months coming up, I would session with this beer"
"Pours a hazy copper with a big fluffy head (This beer can be a bit frothy) and great lacing. The aroma is malty with a hint of floral hops. The flavor is deeply malty, smooth and rich, with a sneaky blast of delicate floral hops that comes on the back end, along with a bite of bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and clingy, leaving a pleasant layer of malt and hop bitterness clinging to the palate. Highly drinkable despite its relatively powerful alcohol content."
"D- another solid victory brew. a great year round IPA that ill have again and again. i would be content having this one all night."
"D - This is a great IPA with a sharp hop character and a smooth maltiness."
"mouthfeel is bitter, highly drinkable, loads of good ipa flavors, lingering hops."
"d: Not too bad, but nothing that blew me away. The usual strong hop vs. rich caramel malt battle that seems characteristic of most strong aIPAs. I was hoping for more character to really make this IPA pop. It's definitely a great IPA that i could drink a few of, but nothing I'd spend hours searching for."
"Drinkability: Damn this was good! Really a mellow, smooth IPA. Great woody character - very rich!"
"This bar none an exceptional beer. The goofy label lends nothing to the incredible taste! Pours a beautiful amber with a wonderful pillowy, creamy thick head that stays to visit for quite a while. Hops are very, very prounounced (obviously). Smell is floral, citrusy, but mostly spicy. I taste hints of caramel but I can't put my finger on it. Mouthfeel is robust and once again, obviously hoppy. I could really sit down and cozy up with a few of these warmers; you can't go wrong here."
"I am not a big fan of IPA's, though there are some I enjoy. This is not one of them. Not the worst beer or IPA I have had, but I was not very impressed. Lots of bitterness and no depth IMO."
"the color of the beer is a deep copper color and it pours a very good foam."
"D- Some what drinkable almost too much hops but ok if your a hop head overall that that imaginative and just a one trick pony."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a copper color with a small off-white head, decent lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malts and fairly hoppy, citrus and pine. Flavor is malty, caramel again with a fairly good piney hop bitter finish (which sticks around for a while). Very nicely balanced, crisp, medium bodied. Very, very drinkable."
"Pours a nice shade of rust, slightly hazy, with fluffy off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell was of hops however I thought it was a little muted. A definite malt presence in the smell. Taste was good. Nice good hop quality to it, a little piney, with relatively decent balance for an IPA. Very nice, bitter after taste. Mouthfeel was suprisingly light and a bit crisp. Overall a good beer. I dont know if this one would quite be ""sessionable"" since the ABV is getting up there, but I could easily see sipping on a few of these on a nice fall day."
"Drinkability - Oh yeah, I could drink these all night, Often I do."
"HopDevil Ale from Victory Brewing Company pours pretty dark with a foamy three finger head. This beer seems to be just a shade darker than some other IPA's I've had. It smells malty and hoppy just like an IPA should. Upon tasting, I can't help but notice the strong hop flavor. This beer is a hop lovers dream as malt takes a backseat in the flavor department. I prefer my IPA's a little more malty and well balanced than HopDevil. It does seem to get a little more malty as the beer warms up. Overall this is a very drinkable beer and I would recommend it."
"D - nice and simple, great IPA"
"Clearly brewed by people who know what they're doing, it looks great and has a nice subtly crafted mouthfeel. Still, too much of a one-note IPA for me. Beats you over the head with the bitterness, would prefer more balance between hop flavor and sheer power. Don't really want another one."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not my absolute favorite IPA but one that I would enjoy drinking again."
"Pours a ruddy, deep amber color with a nice beige, frothy head that retains very well. Good lacing. Smells of floral hops, juicy, fruity, sweet malts. Wonderful aroma. Flavor is very balanced and provides a great bitter kick in the finish. Flavors of grassy hops, an earthy spiciness, doughy malts, astringent aspirin-like bitterness, great balance between the sweet malts and bitter hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, and finishes a bit dry. Very drinkable but will catch up to ya."
"Pour amber golden with a nice white head. Aroma is nice citrus and sweet. Flavor somewhat dissapoints bitterness lingers too long. This beer should finish cleaner but it doesn't. I really don't understand how this IPA can be in the same league as Furious, AleSmith, and Two hearted. It still is very drinkable and a solid effort."
"The Devil pours reddish with persimmon highlights and displays rocky foam crowning the lip. The aroma of fresh hops sits to the back while more grain and malt are mostly present - the fresher the brew the more revealing hop aroma. This brown bottle has an 'Enjoy By' date of October 22, 2008 that could explain the underwhelming aroma. The taste is absolutely perfect - caramel malt and piney/grapefruit hops whisk together then slide to a trailing bitterness that devilishly taunts repetition. This ale is silky, somewhat dry, and completely exquisite."
"Copper coloured with a thick white head. Good lace and good retention. Aroma is mildly hoppy with a sweet grain character. Flavour is at first bitter then sweet with a citrus zest character followed again by an assertive bitterness. Mouthfell is medium as is the carbonation. I could easily drink several of these in a session. My only real critisism of this beer is its week aroma. I expect more hops in the nose from my IPAs. Otherwise a good beer."
"Give this one a try if you love IPA's"
"O: The malt sweetness is delicious and it is taken over by a very good hop flavor. A very enjoyable beer, one of the better IPAs I've had. I could definitely drink a few of these while watching football..."
"D= this beer is a winner. Imagine lounging by the pool or on the beach and you're craving hoppy refreshment. This is it!"
"This beer was actually my 1st introduction to craft beer, and i thought it was terrible!!...my feelings have changed greatly since then. I love this beer on tap and bottle, but from a cask it is a totally different experience. The hops finish so clean and fresh at the end in a more subtle way, not as overpowering from a bottle. Tea/citrus flavors come through on the nose and 1st taste. Very balanced and easy drinking, could drink this all night. Fans of this beer will not be disappointed if you never had it on cask"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a rusty-hued coppery color with a full two fingers of off-white foamy head that slowly fell into one of the thickest rings of lace that coats the top. Sticky as well, leaves it's markings along the glass as you drink. Aroma is sweet, floral hoppiness and caramel malt notes,grapefruit present as well. Taste is a great balancing act of huge sweet and bitter citrus hoppiness back and forth with a great malty backbone, finishes out with a lightly dry and bitter afterstaste. Mouthfeel is slick and washes down easy, leaving a light coating in the back of your mouth. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability is great, especially considering the a slightly higher (near 7% abv) abv that is perfectly hidden, nice level of enjoyable complexity without being overwhelming. Would purchase again, highly recommend seeking out."
"Overall: good tasty stuff, worth your time"
"Tangerine colored and completely translucent. Unfortunately very little lacing or head retention. Smell is a little subpar for an IPA, though traces of peach, grapefruit and malt can be detected. The taste is a faraway battle between the undermanned hops and the bolder carmel malt that is the victor in this uneven match over the IPA. Although smooth taste, overall its not the outcome that I would prefer. Mouthfeel is quite balanced, but maybe a bit under-carbonated. Easy to drink, but nothing really unique or interesting here to talk about. Too many other superior IPAs out there that will prevent me from buying this again."
"Poured from a bottle with enjoy by date of 9/28/08 (specific). Orange to red color, with an offwhite head. This is what an IPA should look like. Nice smooth hop aroma, and malts coming through as well. Strong hop flavor, more than lets on from the aroma. A good malt backbone as well. Smooth drinker. Malty, hoppy, overall. Very good. Went well with rosemary chicken."
"Great Great beer. Is this not a DIPA?"
"D- Easy to drink."
"This is an easy repeat beer if you like dry IPA's. I am not the biggest fan of that style. However, it is a good representation of this style and very flavorful."
"At 6.7 ABV, this ale is dangerously drinkable; the alcohol contents hides well. This is my third beer from Victory, and like the other two, I am not disappointed."
"Poured a orange-brown color with red tints, and a cream-colored head that bubbled down fairly slowly. The smell was strong and quite pleasant: earthy, hoppy punch, with plenty of pine flavor, but a dash of sweetness. It was complex and complimentary, and the taste proved to be so as well. The taste had massive amounts of hop power, as you can imagine. It was fresh, and perfectly combined the floral, sweeter hops with grassy, bitter ones. Also, the are sharp citrus flavors as well, like grapefruit and orange. There was a sweet, caramel-like malt base that was simply perfect: not too sweet, not too bready, just right. The drinkability is fantastic: it's so hoppy it's spicey, so I couldn't drink it too quickly, but it still goes down smooth and easy, with the the other flavors coming in. All in all, a great beer that is powerful without being too over-the-top, as I find many American IPAs."
"D: Goes down smoother than many of this style. I will be buying this again to drink often."
"I have slowly become a hop head and this IPA definitely asserts my new found love for a great style. It's amazing that the amount of hop flavors present in this fine brew find a way to meld and flow ever so gently. I poured this into a standard pint glass and a rather nice burnt orange copper color produced a nice white head. Crazy amounts of lacing creates a spiderweb effect down the glass. Aroma is bursting with bitter and citrus hops, euphoria tickles my senses from scent alone. As I drink this I take bigger swigs and am rewarded with a refreshing sensation. A full malt presence is recognizable but it just can't compete with the generous portion of hops added to this ale. Outstanding flavor it flows so well and it is coupled with a rich full mouthfeel that slides into a satisfying finish."
"Mouthfeel is excellent... lingers long enough to make the flavors substantial... but finishes clean with just a little hop bitterness remaining on the back of the palate."
"Showed up at a party today and, after rummaging through the ice chests for the usual macro fare, someone who knows beer (thanks ""B") showed up with a 6-er of HopDevil IPA. I'm not a hophead by nature, but I was eager to try this. Nice amber color, with a decent head (though is didn't last long). Definite, citrus-like hops in the nose and in the initial taste; but the flavor balanced out nicely with a smooth malt flavor and then ended with a great hops bitterness that left your mouth watering for more. Great stuff. Very enjoyable."
"D: very nice APA, another good brew from Victory, not their best, but good nonetheless."
"I could drink this beer all night long and not get tired of it. All things said... this is one of the best East Coast IPAs available today!!!"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Beer is quite sessionalbe, and flavors are quite good. Easy drinking, just much more balanced than many other IPA's. I'm very pleased with this bottle as my last did not seem hoppy at all leaving me the impression that I had an old bottle."
"Notes: This is by far one of, if not my overall favorite IPA out there."
"D: very good, the balance of the crisp carbonation and the dry finish is nothing less than outstanding."
"This is a great beer, The hop is the focus but the body is right there to back it up, great IPA."
"To summarize, let us borrow from the Book of Stewie Griffith and simply say, ""Victory is mine...! Now where is that insidious harridan Lois?"
"Obviously another nice beer from Victory."
"I was surprised to see this on the beer list at a local Thai restaurant, so I ordered one. Poured from a bottle in a pint glass. Slight thin head, some lacing. Nice golden color. Lots of hops in the smell. First sip was a hop roller-coaster. Lots of hops hit the mouth, then it slowly fades in the swallow. For a hoppy beer, it's not as noticeable as other beers in the genre. Oh, the hops are there, but it doesn't overpower the beer. A nice blend of hoppiness and drinkability. This is one of the better beers that I'd order because it goes perfectly with a nice curry dish we had. Good combo."
"D- Drinks fine for me. Didn't really notice it was a potent brew until I looked as it is quite smooth and drinkable in large quantities"
"Wow, this is a great IPA. My only regret is buying a single bottle instead of a six pack."
"Yes!! Victory in Indiana!!! Pours a nice, shiny amber color with a short white head. Laces appropriately. Smells hoppy, but in a bit of lemon and cat-pee way. Somehwat sweet smelling too. Tastes hoppy and smooth, a nice green grass hop. Biscuity, bready malt backbone. Fusel alcohol on the finish. A bit surprising, as the flavors don't come together all that well. Bitterness lingers, along with a ghost of lemon juice. Medium bodied, a little heavy for the flavor. Well, I must say that im underwhelmed. It's ok, but its a lot messier of a beer than I prefer. Yeah, there are lots of hops, but its just not particularly balanced. Oh well, i know I love some of the other victory brews, so ill just wait for those to show up."
"I grew up in PA and every time I go back to visit I pick up a case of this. It is what I judge all other American IPA's against. Pours a rich golden-burgundy with an off-white head that rises and slowly falls to a solid film that laces all down the glass. It smells of piney citrus, but not in the same fresh biting way that a lot of IPA's come off. This one has more of a mellow and rich smell that rides atop a grainy backbone. The taste is more of the same. The hops are first and foremost, but there is a complexity here that leaves you looking forward to the next as soon as you finish the first. The malts provide just the right amount of balance in the sense that the scales are definitely tipped to the hops, but they bring their malty friend along to mellow out the finish with an earthy graininess that provides the perfect yang for their yin. Great beer, enough said."
"A two-finger tan head tops off a honey brown brew. Head fades slowly leaving some crooked lacing all around the glass. Citrusy hops rise to the nose, but not as striking as I would have imagined with a name like ""Hopdevil"". Behind the hop start is some tea, orange peel, sour grapes and sweet bread. The hoppiness is kept in check by a certain malty sweetness that makes it go down somewhat smoother than expected. Carbonation is adequate in this medium-bodied brew."
"The beer has a very fruity malty flavour to it, with a huge bitterness from the hops. This is a quite unique IPA to me because of the hopiness being more bitter and less aromatic. The bitterness in this beer is just awesome, it's a nice change up from all of the aroma hopped beers. The mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of carbonation. The bitterness makes this beer drinkable."
"The consistency is quite heavy and creamy, very smooth, quite resinous on the tongue. The hops leave an oily feel in the aftertaste. This beer is slightly drying in the finish, but the aftertaste is quite light. The ABV is about right, there is a bit more warming alcohol notes in the beer than your typical IPA. An excellent beer that is well received by all. L'Chaim."
"Was a clear carmel brown color and had a nice floral smell. Like the smell, it tasted of aromatic flowers and had a lingering hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy, a good, well-rounded beer."
"Probably one of Victory's best year-round brews."
"Pours amber to red in color with an off-white head that has some staying power. Some lace is left behind as the head falls adding to the appearance. Muted fruity hop aroma; this must be an older bottle. Hop flavor is still fairly bright. Bitterness is somewhat less than I expected or remembered from a previous tasting. Mouthfeel is about right; slightly full. There's a bit of tannin from somewhere that dries out the tongue a bit. The hop flavor is rather interesting...I can't quite place it, but I'm going with grapefruit and it's a fairly strong flavor. There's a candy-like sweetness there, too, no doubt from the caramel malts that also give the beer it's color. By the time I'm half way through this beer there's rings of Brussels lace left behind. Nice. The aroma has opened up a bit and is a touch perfume or talc like; or dusty. Finish is a bit quick, at least in terms of bitterness, but hoppiness lingers. This is a good beer, but almost a pale ale by contemporary hop head standards."
"A decent IPA, not my favorite. Thanks to Tbn2 for trading this brew for me to try."
"D. Very drinkable despite the high ABV. Cheers!"
"All things considered, this is a fine beer, and I would without doubt recommend this to fellow enthusiasts."
"What I liked best about this beer was the mouthfeel - lovely, smooth and rich!"
"Feel is slightly thick, with a medium-full body and slightly high carbonation. Doesn't leave any stickiness in the mouth though, it's pretty clean. Drinkability is alright. It's a bit heavy for an IPA, but other than that there's nothing really wrong with it."
"This slid down really fast and didn't leave me with an over the top bitterness that I wanted to wash away. One was not enough. This is a very solid IPA."
"This beer is as drinkable as a glass of water. Yum but what happend to the hops?"
"A drinkable IPA, more in the British style than some. Not over the top on hops, despite the name. I'd have it again, but probably not at $12 a six pack."
"Notes: Got this one from dyan - thanks! I've had this several times in the past but never fresh. Until now, that is."
"Most impressive for me was the drinkability. I am becoming a big fan of very hoppy beers, but I find that this one strikes the perfect balance. Usually I will drink a very hoppy beer and be content for the evening, but this is one that I crave multiple of, and will definitely seek it out to have some stock on hand."
"Clean and very drinkable for style."
"Drink em' if ya got em'..."
"Taste: Not as hoppy as the smell indicated. infact its over ballanced just enough not to be extreme. This is the main flavor however with some citrus in the after taste, as one would expect. who can complain when the name suggests the taste you get."
"Yeah, this will cure your hop fix. But for me it was all about the hops, with nothing else. I like to see a bit more balance and depth. I'm generally a hop fan, but this got to be too much after a while."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The aroma is sweet malt, caramel, and some floral and citrusy hops. The taste starts off smooth and malty with the citrusy hops kicking in to make a nice bitter finish. This is not an extremely bitter IPA like I was expecting from the name, but it is pretty well balanced. Overall, HopDevil is a solid IPA that is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys IPAs."
"Overall though, a great IPA with pretty good drinkability."
" A great dark copper/redish color, with a large slightly off white head.Smells of hpos, mainly floral and citrus with a hint of honey/sweet malts as well. Carmaly malts up front with an excellent spicey hop flavor that carries the day and tingles the tongue. Dry and crisp finish. Yet to have a bad victory brew. This is another winner."
"D = A very drinkable beer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a simple, straight forward IPA."
"12oz bottle obtained from a trade. This beers pours a hazy orange with about a one finger head. The head doesn't retain for very long. I thought this beer would reek of hops, but not much really jumps out at me besides a sweet smell. The bitterness in this is upfront and very prominent. Seems slightly unbalanced. Low levels of carbonation and a medium body to this. It's pretty good and I'd definitely drink it again."
"D - It's not undrinkable, but I doubt I'd ever session this stuff. It's virtually flavorless and dominated by a prolonged and unnecessary bitterness; it was a bit difficult for me to get though my one bottle."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for an IPA. It does remind me a bit much of an APA but the hop bitterness alone makes up for that."
"D - I am sure this is not typical of this beer. Damn."
"This was a good, but not great IPA. Appearance is on par with some decent head and lacing. Smell was a bit weak- not enough bite for my liking. Taste picks up a bit, but the mouthfeel doesn't have that oily feel that I have come accustomed to. Drinkability is fantastic for the style."
"Poured in tulip glass. Deep copper color, pretty clear. Nice light brown head approx 1"". Excellent taste. Smells spicy. Head leaves nice thick rings on glass. Very drinkable. Very hoppy smell. Beautiful color and very clear. Good example of american IPA."
"After taking my first drink, the only thing that came out of my mouth following the pause of silence was WOW. This beer is exactly what the label says it is. I heard it is one devil of a beer but i dont even think the devil could have crafted this beer. appearance is a copper color with a thick off white head. taste is, well lets just leave it at hoppy with a little spice. Good beer in your face it leaves a fresh taste in your mouth when you finish and the flavor really stays with you."
"Detractors will claim bitterness is the point of an IPA, and not enjoy the malty character of this brew as much. This one will come down to personal taste."
"Packaging - Med brought this one over in a German style growler. I really like the German style. The sealable top and the new system over at Liberty, where they flush with CO2 before filling will make these last a good amount of time. Much better than the screw off caps."
"Overall-A very good IPA"
"If this was brewed in MI, I'd buy it all the time. Sadly, My loyalty lies with Crooked Tree and Two Hearted with a dash if Mad Hatter."
"This became a favorite the first time I had this beer about 9 years ago. It was love at first sip. It was a must at my wedding."
"D. I love to drink this beer. It's one of my favorite of it's style and I could drink this all night long.Very tasty indeed."
"I am fortunate I live about 3 miles from Victory so I have had this beer served three different ways - cask, tap and bottle. The cask is my favorite style though this beer is great which every way it is served. Nice brown color to it with that hop smell that makes you know you are about to have a great IPA. Flavor is solid hops from the beginning to the end. Despite high ABV you don't know it till you get up after drinking a couple of them."
"I could definitely find a groove with this beer. The body is just right and my tongue is not completely body slammed by the hops. It has the perfect combination to drink more than one in a session. Victory hit the mark with this creation."
"D - Heck, I would session it, but probably a bad idea. Very tasty, well balanced, and not over-the-top."
"MF&D - Medium bodied, but not quite as oily or clingy as I would have liked. A definite notch below N.N. or 90min IPA, but overall a quality ale worth checking out."
"i could drink a few of these. a good example of a nice clean tasting american ipa."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: Not enough hops to be called a ""Hopdevil"". The hops are either not here or hiding somehere. Nice, but not one that I'd run all over to get."
"A nice, solid beer. Amber in color with a medium head that retained well. Little bit of lacing. Pleasant citrus aroma, a little bit of malt. The taste followed the aroma quite well. Citrus hops and a little malt. Not too aggressive in the mouth. This was a very enjoyable beer."
"D: Powerful and biting, but the crispness would likely mask the typical weight in the belly that is produced by IPAs, so I would not be afraid to pull two."
"Aroma is spicy and bready, it seems more malty than most US IPA's. Flavor follows suit, very malty with spicy hop accents. A little grassy, with an herbal hop aftertaste. Bready malt has some light buttery character. Really easy drinking, fairly mild for an IPA, meaning it's not too amped-up and aggressive. Very accessible IPA from Victory."
"Although more Victory than defeat, HopDevil never lives up to its sinfully menacing promise."
"this beet is very drinkable i would recommend this be to any one who wants a hoppy beer but not something that is a complete hop bomb. one of the best and more aggressive ipas that is not a IIpa"
"D: This one actually had a slightly unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste, so it may not have been fresh. Still a decent IPA, but I will seek out again to rerate as I think I may be shortchanging Victory with this review."
"Very nice IPA style beer. I could drink several of these in one sitting. Good session beer."
"Notes: Tried this on the fly,simply going by the reputation of Victory. No regrets and I was ready for the hop assault and sure enough I was not disappointed. I will buy more and share some with my hop addicted friends. Although this may not be a session beer one can have a few and simply enjoy with friends."
"D: It is a great IPA with a wonderful flavor and complex aroma. I would be limited to 2 or 3 before the bitterness overcame my enjoyment but its a great way to go."
"Poured from a bottle into a tall pilsner. The beer poured a clear amber red with a nice looking 2 inch off white fluffy foam head leaving rings of lacing behind after each sip. The smell was impressive with strong piney hops jumping out of the glass followed by a faint hop smell. Full flavored with bitter hop spice bite followed by a not so pleasant tinny metallic taste. The beer finishes even more bitter than it begins. The beer was well carbonated leaving behind a slick piney feel. Sorry to say a was a bit disappointed by this one. Looked forward to it after all the good reviews but was not blown away. Unfortunately I think Troegs has set the bar a little too high with Nugget and even Hopback Amber. All the other hop selections have fallen short. Worth trying but not what its hyped up to be."
"D: Easy to drink but a little higher ABV so I take these a lot slower"
"The grapefruity floral piney hoppy aromas and flavors stand up well to outdoor drinking as Phillies fans curse out Mets fans all around me...refreshing and deliciously drinkable...can't go wrong with this super-full flavored beer with a long, bitter finish."
"D-Highly drinkable. Too strong for a session, but I would share a sixer any day."
"This beer poured an amber golden color with a big off white head that leaves a nice film the whole way down and laces nicely. The smell is a fantastic combination of citrus (grapefruit) flavors from the hops along with some maltiness that seems to give the beer a mild dark berry fruit aroma. The flavor has a one dimensional hop characteristic with some bitter, astringent, and metallic flavors. The mouthfeel on this one is good. Nice thickness with a balanced carbonation. An ok IPA. I am not as fond of it as i used to be. A bit too astringent for me"
"Crisp,nicely carbonated, with a pleasantly dry and slightly astringent finish. An all-day brewski, and another win for Victory."
"Now this is a nice little IPA. Cloudy golden orange color with an orange tinted lid. Lightly sweet and caramelish smells, but lemony and citrusy hops reign. Soft and light oily smooth. Biscuit and caramel malts play a role in the flavor, but theres a pleasant hoppy bitterness of grapefruit and orange peel. Victory has a pretty solid IPA here folks."
"This beer is called ""Hop Devil"" for a reason. Few IPA's showcase West Coast style hops better than this one."
"Dense tan head of creamy foam. Clear golden-copper appearance. Slight floral aroma. Nice floral-sour hoppy punch with good malty-sweet balance. Really easy to drink; ranks with the best IPA's I've tried. Might have helped that it was on tap versus bottled. Went great with hot wings."
"M/D - Excellent all around. Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. The bitterness is the only thing holding it back on the drinkability, but I think that is a good thing."
"Good but not great... Its a solid ass little IPA but not spectacular.."
"Bronze body with a medium-sized head and excellent retention. A bit hazy and very appealing. Very hoppy (obviously) and bitter without the additional sweetness than many of this style have, but very true-to-form. The bitter flavor may slightly hinder the drinkability. Personally, not my favorite in this style but a very well-crafted beer that is sure to please."
"Excellent. I'm a huge believer in truth in advertising, and Hop Devil fits the bill. Huge smack of hops. From something called ""Hop Devil", I would expect nothing less. Pours a foamy dark golden. Can notice the hops scent right away. Good sign. Hops comes through from first taste through to the aftertaste. When I'm looking for a good, solid IPA, this one will make my top 10."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. The hops provide a sharp bitterness, but it's a well-balanced flavor."
"HopDevil is one of my favorite beers, which is why it's my first review. Victory brews a damn fine American IPA."
"A nice IPA in my book. This has to be one of the most balanced IPA's that I've had. This ia my first brew that I've tried from Victory...I'll have to try more."
"The hops might turn some but it adds a unique character to the beer as they literally attack your tongue from the get-go. Able to be consumed at an above average rate if you want a beer that feels light but aggressive on the palate. The alcohol might catch up with you after a few but it's worth the journey."
"This poured dark orange with only a little head. It had a perfect blend of hops and malt, which gave it both a very sweet and bitter flavor. This is just what an IPA should taste like, in my opinion. It had a decent texture, but nothing substantial there. Overall it was quite easy to drink and just as rewarding."
"I found this pretty drinkable, even though I don't love this style. Not my favorite pale ale I've had this evening, but certainly a respectable offering from Victory that people who like IPAs will undoubtedly enjoy."
"Notes: This is my second offering from Victory and it's a tasty one. This certainly is a beer that can be enjoyed year round. Cheers"
"D: A higher ABV as per the style make it a slower drinker, but easy enough to drink. Ended up pairing it with a bison burger, and they went together quite nicely."
"A really great overall beer, that (for me, at least) strikes a really good balance between bitter hoppiness and sweetness. Not my favorite IPA, but definitely up there. I purchased the single for $1.70, which means a sixer probably rolls in at around 9 bucks, which is perfectly reasonable for an IPA sixpack."
"Drinkability is high. Hop Devil keeps it smooth while still delivering a very sophisticated hop fix, with almost no indication of the robust ABV. This is so anti-west coast, I love it! Brings but great memories of my 10 years in Pittsburgh."
"IPA fans that havent tried this yet...what are you waiting for?"
"This is a very sophisticated ale, after drinking the cask, it makes the bottled stuff taste better too because I am way more aware of all of the flavors interacting instead of just hop flavor."
"Overall: Nice aggressive IPA. Perfect balance between hop and malt. If your a hophead you will enjoy this one no matter if its on cask or in the bottle."
"Pours a nice surprisingly amber color. Rich head fades a nice creamy lace. Initial taste is a well balanced malt with a bitter aftertaste, with a little citrus and honey. A lot more mild then the Victory Hop Whallop but this is more of an amber to me. Recommended."
"Light astrigent alcohol presense, but otherwise a great brew!"
"Pours an amber-red color with a big off-white head. Lots of visible carbonation. Smells of citrus (oranges and grapefruit) and pine. Taste is similar, but with a sharper hop bitterness towards the finish (though not too astringent). Generally light-bodied, with moderate carbonation. A nice and drinkable IPA offering."
"Pours a clear deep amber color with reddish hues. One finger of medium foam off-white head has ok retention and some good sticky lacing. Smells of malt and spicy, earthy hops with some citrus notes like orange. Taste is of floral hops up front followed by a solid malt backbone and a nice spicy dry hop finish. Not as prominently hoppy as the West Coast Style, more of a blending of British IPA and APA. Medium in body with good carbonation and a good overall balance. Not overly hoppy, meaning it won't ruin your taste buds and quite sessionable. Could drink several of these at a sitting and not be bored."
"A seethur ruby brown with good head and lacings. A large hoppy aroma of dark fruit and some gran/bread malt in there. The hops catch the tongue immediately, with hints of citrus and an earthy flavor and some malts. But it is pretty much hops - and very smooth. I thought that was nice, and I am not a hophead so it was appreciated. A little dry for my liking, but all in all a good beer and a must for hops lovers."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper color with a thin off white head that leaves some lace on the sides. Aroma hits you with hops; pine and grapefruit, but there's also some malt in the background, a bit of caramel. Taste assaults the the taste buds with hops, much like the smell. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected and is a bit dry in the finish, no lingering hops on the palette. Great brew, not as hoppy as some out there, but certainly very drinkable. I taste no alcohol and could easily drink to many of these."
"I am not sure what I am missing on this one, but I am rather let down."
"Bought a sixer at the corner store . This was my first experience with a victory brew overall I came away satisfied. Beer poured into DFH pint glasss minimal head, no lacing. Nice hop and amalt aromas . Pours nice and dark for an IPA. Very hoppy first tasete balanced with some maltiness very dry bitter finish . mouthfeel is very thin. Was expecting somthing more inlight of the $11.00 I spent. However this would be an epic session beer if available at happy hour prices . Additionally I think that the abv is overrated in BA description."
"This devil pours a nice transparent amber/orange with good white head and nice lace. Smell is of spicy english hops. The taste follows with english like hop flavors, very spicy hops as opposed to the mouth ripping west coast citrus hops. This is a very balanced IPA with malts defenitely making their presence known. The mouthfeel is kind of thin and watery but still above average. Drinkability is good, very balanced. Overall this is a good IPA but I prefer a slightly different style, more often found on this west coast. But don't get me wrong, I would drink this beer over many other IPAs out there. Great brew."
"I could see myself drinking a few of these at a time. Good session beer."
"D: To be honest I was a bit disappointed in this beer, especially at 10.99 a six pack, maybe this one suffers from being close to the expiration date but as it stands this beer seems only average to the lush array of other American IPAs out there."
"Overall impression.... eh."
"Greeat drinkability, a beer you can drink all night."
"Victory HopDevil Ale pours a light copper, crystal clear with a nice head. I smell nice caramel malt paired up with citrus and resin hops hinting at plenty of bitterness. A sharp bitterness comes first in the flavor followed by a lot of spicy, citrusy hop flavor. The malt sweetness sticks its head out for just a second, but is instantly covered by more bitterness. Overall, a nice solid IPA, makes me want to spend more time in Downingtown."
"I was really excited to see this beer mixed in with a rather pedestrian selection (pretty much all BMC), and was glad to try it."
"If looking for serious hops try Stone Ruination or S.Adams Imperial Pilsner (if you can still find one); but, otherwise this is a tasty brew that I will gladly pruchase again."
"I will have no problem enjoying the rest of my 6 pack, but I had higher expectations of this beer. I'll give it another try in the future."
"D-Very drinkable(although im quite partial to IPAs)"
"D: Pretty good. I could easily drink these back to back."
" ~ This is a better than average brew without a doubt. I recommend to those who enjoy a good hop filled beer to take a stab at the Devil."
"Definitely a buy-again."
"Rich copperish amber pour with a nice offwhite head. Light fresh, somewhat unique hop smell with some light sweetness in there too. Fairly sweet and mild for an IPA with some fresh, grassy hops. Could be slightly more flavorful, and really isn't that bold at all. One of the milder IPAs I've had and I'm not fanatical about insane amounts of hops. A friendly, easy, good IPA, but surely nothing worth a top 2-3% of beers ever..."
"D - A nice enough beer but my bottle seems to be lacking the hoppiness that others mentioned. It's tasty nonetheless and admittedly has traveled half way around the world in not so ideal conditions. I imagine a fresh bottle would be awesome!"
"D-considering the fact that I feel that my tongue has just been violated and at the same time I wish I had one more of these little devils,I have to say HELL YEAH!!"
"It was a little difficult to take it serious based on its name...I thought this would just be some second rate IPA but was quite impressed. One of your darker IPAs with more than a fare share of hops and lot more character than that of the lighter IPAs. Very solid feel in the mouth, it surrounds the tongue and attacks from all directions."
"This beer poured a copper color with a very foamy off white head. It had great lacing and head retention. The smell was a great hoppy smell. Citrus and floral. Great IPA taste. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a very drinkable IPA."
"D - This is almost sessionable, but the higher ABV and metallic affect have thrown off the drinkability for me. Since I only have one to sample, I think I'll try this again at a later date."
"Yet again I've been very pleased with another Victory brew. Hop heads rejoice and give thanks."
"Drinkability is very good, this is a great american IPA."
"Clear bronze color with an off-white head. Aromas of earthy hops and caramel malt. Flavor of hops first, then close behind is the sweet and so slightly roasty malt that makes this almost a New England/ U.K. style IPA, except that while it is not devilishly hoppy, it is more hopped than that. Medium body and a well-balanced hop/malt finish; earthy, slightly bitter and somewhat woodsy. I had this cask-conditioned once at the brewery and it was worth the road trip."
"What a great beer! Matches its commercial description exactly. And I especially like the lack of fruitiness which I've grown to dislike in very hoppy beers. Poured with a nice head which lasted for quite a while and plenty of lace. Very aromatic hoppy maltiness in the nose. Good mouth if perhaps just the barest hint of being thin. Intense savory flavor is all the aroma is but so much more. Quite satisfying yet continuosly intriguing. Excellent finish."
"In summary not one for an extreme hop head, maybe what a hop head would drink when they want a lighter beer for a change."
"A good full mouthfeel with a twangy feel. On of the first ipa's iv'e ever had and still one of the best. Without a doubt the most drinkable as well. The one never lasts long at my house. An absoulte must try ipa, has to be a classic."
"Poured a copper color with a white head that lasted throughout. The nose is hops with some pine and citrus. The beer is smooth and the hops really come through. Very bitter towards the end. I enjoyed it but I don't think I could have more than a couple in one sitting because it's so dry at the end. Not as hoppy as I thought and the bitterness killed it for me. Wanted more hops, less bite."
"I really like this IPA, I will definately be looking for it again."
"A long overdue review as this is (pretty close to) my hometown beer. This was the first local craft brew I discovered, many years ago. We still enjoy it, though there are so many choices it's not a weekly staple anymore. I was amazed at how well it holds up to a ""critical"" evaluation. While there is a very strong hoppiness, it is surprisingly well balanced."
"A decent enough beer, but there are several hop-head beers out there I'd rather have in my glass."
"D-i know lots of people love to drink this as a six pack or a variety pack but like i have always said im not an IPA guy and i just wanted to add it to my collection."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a thick, frothy, tan head - some lacing. The aroma is malty and sweet with some hops characteristics noticeable but not bold. The taste is malty and quite hoppy at the same time. The hops are the shining star, but there is a very nice malty sweetness that balances this beer quite well. The mouthfeel is medium but textured. This is a great example of a highly drinkable, balanced brew"
"Ingredients: American hops. According to the label."
"Appearance deep amber in color no haze. Smell floral hop and a bit of citrus. Taste hops all around a slight malty taste up front but the hops play the domenent role in this one. Drinkability was suprisingly good for somthing this hoppy. Excelent beer highly recomended."
"Special thanks to Aaron for spotting this one for me!"
"Mouthfeel was good and chewy, this is a good IPA, nothing really exciting to me, but I really lean more towards the Citrus hops more than this in an IPA."
"D- Mmmhmmm... if you're in the mood for a super hoppy IPA with flavor to get you through the night, then this is a fine choice. Drink up!"
"Drinkability is off the charts. I could definitely see this becoming a session beer for me."
"This is a beer! The pint glass shows a beautiful copper color with a cap of nice creamy foam. The nose is mostly hops. The medium bodied beer rolls across the palate with a wallop of hops. A small hint of malt muscles its way through the assault of hops. The overwhelmed taste buds retain the strong hop flavor after the beer is gone. This beer will please hop heads, but also has a pleasant delightfulness that all will enjoy."
"d: For hopheads only. Very nicely done, as hoppy as advertised. One is plenty to satisfy my hop fix."
"Notes: This is a very nice, easy drinking IPA. You could have a few of these without tiring of it. Smooth, balanced, and complex. I hope to get more of this soon!"
"Notes: I am hop head. I like this beer. When I drink it I like more than one. It's a real good beer."
"D: Going down quick, and the bitterness is not overwhelming."
"Tried a fresher bottle and was much more impressed... the issues I had before were mainly due to the beer being past its peak and losing much of the strong hop character that makes an IPA. The one I had last night was much fresher, and the hop character was much stronger and on par with what I expect from a good session IPA. All other notes are still valid and consistent with what was noted before, but I am moving the taste score up by half a point."
"D-Not what I expected with the name HopDevil,but a very good drinking beer.Something in the hops or the malts(could even be the yeast)reminds me of some Belgian Pale Ales I've tasted.Overall another victory for Victory."
"D: Very easy drinking IPA. Nicely balanced."
"D - Seems to be quite drinkable. For an IPA named HopDevil, I expected more hoppy bitterness to it, however it was very well-rounded with an spicy hop fix to it that mixed very well with the rest of the brew. Something to tip back and enjoy more than a few during a warm summer day. My first tasting of a Victory brew and I am quite impressed. Definitely recommended."
"I thought that this was a very good beer and should definately be tried by those who love AIPAs, IPAs, or any heavily hopped brew. However, I had to knock it a little on drinkability because I can't see drinking these over and over. For it's hop value, though, it was very tasteful."
"Pours a translucent amber color as you would expect, with little head. Upon the first sniff I proclaimed to myself 'It smells like Budweiser' and to me, it does, absolutely nothing here for me in the smell department. Upon taste, it kinda tastes like budweiser too, although with the typical hoppy bitterness of ales. The mouthfeel is very bright on the tounge, too much carbonation for my tastes. I suppose this might be a good session beer if you want something like an american lager with hops. But I might recommend looking for something else in the American IPA department."
"Clean and dry mouthfeel with healthy carbonation. It's not bad and it's better balanced than most IPAs, but when I buy a bottle with a picture of a demonic hop flower on the front I expect a bit more in the way of bitterness. Still, I won't have a problem finishing off the sixer."
"The Victory Hop Devil displays a clear, leather like color. Very nice. The head retains a lacing throughout. The aroma is strong piney, citrusy hops with an enticing malt sweetness. Body is medium with slightly above average carbonation which works perfectly for the beer. The taste is that crisp, fresh, citrus hop taste and a delicious bitterness that tells me those beautiful little cones went into the boil good and early. Your girlfriend who drinks Blue Moon won't like this beer. There is a nice sweet malt follow up that perfectly complements the hop dominance. Bottom Line: This is a top five IPA for an East Coast fella like myself. You will have to scour the continent to find a better IPA. Anything Victory puts out is going to be good and this is one of their best."
"An excellent beer. The cask version, in my opion, is even more enjoyable than the bottle."
"The overall drinkability of HopDevil is decent. Its all-around a solid beer, maybe not with quite the over-the-top punch that hopheads crave, but that makes it much more accessible to those trying to find a good, solid IPA to get started in the world of craft beers with. Its not insanely hopped, not overly bitter, and doesnt have a monster ABV, all of which make it a very enjoyable beer that can be had in decent amounts without getting sick or tired of it."
"D: Fairly drinkable beer. Good mouthfeel with an ok taste. I expected a little bit more of a bittering hop taste from the beer."
"D: A solid IPA. A bit different than the west coast hop-bombs that I'm used to but still very good for the style."
"D- hopheads young and old come imbibe in the glory of the friendly hopdevil. i had the victory hopdevil pint glass for 5 months before i actually got to taste the beer...mission accomplished."
"Don't get me wrong - this was OK and quite drinkable, but compared to other offerings out there in the American IPA category, this one comes up average across the board to my taste buds. Again, a fine beer, but the line of better American IPAs is long and getting longer!"
"Overall a nice IPA, a great compliment to a plate of hot wings and blue cheese. Iwon't turn this one down, but it is not my favorite."
"D - Great beer from one of my favorite breweries. If you like ipa's this is a great beer to try."
"Pours a clouded very dark amber brown with a tan head. Nose is hopped, citric, and clean. Flavor is smooth. Not overly flavorful though. Slight hop tones with not much else going on really. It is smooth, yes. There is just no outstanding flavor quality here. Feel is standard for what youd expect. Quite drinkable, but yet another craft brew that has quality, but no outstanding personality (have I become spoiled???). Tried it, moving on, most likely not to return."
"Pretty good, but i didnt fing it outstanding."
"stellar."
"d - if it wasn't a sampler pack I would have opened another right away."
"Buttery and smooth in texture with that familiar mellow cask feel. Velvety and clean with no real carbonation. The texture and bitterness really linger past the finish as well. A classic brew from Victory that lends itself really well to the cask conditioning."
"D: Easy to drink and nice and tasty. Lots of bitterness would probably prevent me from drinking this on card night, though."
"Recommended!"
"The cooked in and finishing hops are all very strong. If you didn't get that from the name, beware (you must really need more warning then, I guess)."
"Pours a ruby-red, slightly brownish color from a cool 12oz bottle with a green ""hop-devil""... No real head, but a nice colored appearance which reveals a strong aroma of hops bursting through... there's no denying it... this beer is built on hops and the strong aroma and flavor is very evident from the first sniff to the first sip... Another solid offering from a company that I've really taken a liking to... I haven't been dissatisfied with any brews from Victory... Great stuff with an equally good mouthfeel... with such a strong suggestion of hops, this beer wasn't as bitter as I thought it would be... a nice flavor with a warming alcohol glow... Certainly recommended - this beer is all hops..."
"Best before Feb '08 on the label. Pours a very slight hazy liquid gold with a small head that fades quickly. Smells of fresh oily hops piney with a touch of floralness. Good carbonation throughout. Big mouth feel. Impressive malt foundation with a superstructure of hops on top. Caramel malt also prominent. Superbly balanced. A crisp spicy assault of the mouth. Aftertaste lingers around and offers a nice warming effect. Very Highly Recommended, never run out."
"Very good beer, will buy this on nights when I might want something a little more hoppy the my usual Sierra Nevada."
"I need to sit down and pit the devil against Troegs HopBack. A Susquehannan backyard brawl of sorts. The HopBack is dubbed an amber ale, but whatever, these two beers have a lot more in common than geography."
"Tastes of bitter piny hops, orange, a bit of grapefruit and a solid amount of lightly toasted malt. Very well made and extremely drinkable."
"Way delicious, and more than makes up for some flat mediocrity from Breckenridge that preceded it. Stellar IPA."
"The drink had a red-dark amber appearance with a thin head. Although the appearance made it tantalizing, the rest of the drink was a bit average. Its faint hop smell had some sweets to it, but lacked any spectacular features. The taste was somewhat thin but the aftertaste had a good bitter-sweet balancing going for it. This IPA also had a low-medium body to it, making it not as carbonated as I hoped. Overall it was decent and not overpowering, but that also hindered it from being great."
"rich, opulent copper in color with a wonderful two finger head. good lacing as i finish it off. i can easily smell the wonderous hops in this great effort by victory. the complexity of flavors in this beer is, for me, what makes it one of my favorite beers. starts bitter ends with a touch of sweetness that ends it off, marvelous! damn near perfect in it's balance of moderate alcohol content and how it feels, no hint of a burn. i will easily finish the six pack i just bought so for me, it's a good session beer. Beware of the hops."
"D - For something so over the top, it's actually very drinkable for hop heads."
"Poured into a pint glass a cloudy gold color. Not too much head or lacing to be seen. Had a real hoppy smell with a slight flowery hint. Not too much in the taste though. My it was just the aroma hops? Taste followed suit with the smell and had a pretty hoppy presence in it with just a little bit of malt. Had sort of a lighter mouthfeel to it. Not as hopped up as I expected from the name and the style but I feel it was a pretty good offering."
"Poured cloudy copper amber with a long lasting orange tinged head about half an inch thick. Prominent lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus. Moderately sweet biscuit taste with substantial mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish. I would drink this again. Overall a very nice beer."
"D - Fantastic cask offering from Victory! I could drink one or two of these on every visit to Victory. This is an all-around fantastic IPA that is so much better on cask."
"HopDevil Ale pours an amber-orange out of the bottle with a cool looking hop devil on the label. Not surprisingly, hops are in charge here. There is a pleasant citrus, grapefruit, orange hopiness that predominates with only a hint of malt in the background. Dry on the finish with more hops."
"Oh, the beer--pure bliss!"
"12 oz bottle. Nice caramel color, very frothy head, good retention. smells like like grapefruit,raisin, pine,lots of citrus! bicuity taste, bitter finish. pretty sweet tasting. carmel flavors come through. bitter notes at the end predominate the flavor of each sip. nice thick mouthfeel that really clings to your mouth. This beer is nice to sip on slowly due to bitterness levels, but a really enjoyable brew."
" The heavy pine and citrus/grapefruit tones that tease the nose and stick to the palate jump out and say "" I mean business "" . A mouthful of malt up front with the thick ipa finish is blended nicely with the soapy sudsy finish. Victory?-absolutely!"
"Overall this beer is greatly drinkable, each one is maintained by the other."
"Taste was hoppy and spicy with a long, bitter finish. Creamy mouthfeel. A really great beer, that hides it's alcohol well. High drinkability."
"D - Nice to enjoy a few, wouldn't classify as a session brew. Nice follow through leaves you urning another gulp!"
"D - I really like this beer. Its a drink you enjoy over time and not drink too quickly for an IPA. The heavy feel of the IPA I think will keep you from downing this beer too fast; it will fill you up."
"This probably is the marijuana of IPA's; that gateway version of the style that fans of the more classic IPA's (Bell's Two Hearted immediatley comes to mind) can use to get into bigger IIPA's(with the afformentioned Weyerbacher Double Simcoe proving to be a natural progression from this) while still having the IPA abv; a classic within the style, but not a classic example of the style."
"The hopdevil comes with a cool label of a devilish looking hop and a consume by date. Nice. It pours a clear amber with a nice foam head the leaves some money web lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is hoppy with a tiny maltiness. The taste of the brew is not overwhelmingly hoppy for an IPA. You get a whoppy spiciness at the end of the drink in the back of your mouth. It tasted to me like there was a strong hop talent to it with a balance of malt in the background. Very good IPA."
"Copper coloured , clear, with full head, lot of carbonation. Pronounced hoppy bitterness in a classical way (reminiscent of Sierra Nevada) before all the over-the-top super-charged beers. Nice finish with lingering hoppiness. Excellent in the middle of the range bitter beers."
"I'd say the most impressive aspect of this beer was the head. It's thick, full and cream-colored, not what I'm used to seeing on an ale. Smell is of hops, but not the piney stuff I'm used to finding. I couldn't quite place the flavor either; it's hops, but there was something unique about it. Overall, a well-balanced beer, not overwhelmingly hoppy but definitely sturdy. Drinkability was quite good."
"Pours a hazy deep orange/amber color with a thick off-white head and lots of sticky lacing. Smell is flowery hops to the core. Taste follows suit, but is not overpowering. Seems to be on the lighter side with regard to body. Nice crisp finish and very tasty. A very solid brew."
"This is one of the beers that I place in my ""Solid IPA"" category: never disappoints, but still has a special character at that. Strong hop body with smokey tones and flavor with a good hop bite in the finish.Great hop aroma that is however not quite as flowery or complex as other IPAs of its caliber. From my experience I have seen this beer to have sub-par head retention."
"D--Forgot how good this beer is...and on cask it is even better. This beer may not be the biggest bad boy on the block anymore but it still a very solid performer. A truly, a well made beer."
"D - Very good. A little thick, a little too malty to make it an over the top AIPA, but truer to its British inspirations. I like this a whole bunch!"
"My first Victory Brewing beer and I look forward to sample some more."
"Ive become infatuated with IPAs lately and this one is among the best."
"This is truly a hop lovers IPA. The malt is there, but the hops dominate. Balance? Not so much. But it's awesome."
"D - I would never turn one down, I'll say that much. Interesting profile, and quite drinkable, if for nothing else the curiosity of it's presentation. What you see is nothing like what you get, and that's not a bad thing."
"I really thought this was a kick ass ale...It is what is says: hoppy. It has a nice amber color with a small, slightly creamy head. The head was a bit more constructed in the cask bier I had as opposed to the bottled versions. The aroma and taste were thoroughly dominated by hops, hops, and more hops. Goes down well and leaves a lingering hop aftertaste."
"D: It may be a good thing that I can't get this locally, because I could see myself drinking alot of these. Perfectly balanced and would make for a dangerous session beer."
"Drinkability: Heck yeah.... all day long.... go for it.... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"Thanks to Biegaman for sharing this growler with me. I've enjoyed it now over three days although loathe to write a review since I've been struggling with a bad cold. The colour is copper to chestnut brown with a tan head that thins out but produces good lacing and lots of wispy film. Well carbonated. The nose is distinct pink grapefruit with a spicy citrus rind backdrop and maybe a hint of pine needles. The alcohol is well hidden with a sweet grapefruit taste, assertive hops, flashes of butterscotch. The mouthfeel throughout remains hoppy and crisp with a bitter-sweet lingering finish. This is a great beer drinking experience and one I'll hope to repeat often in the future."
"Easy to drink this beer. Goes well with extra-spicy mexican food."
"I picked this up in a mixed six pack from Total Wine. This beer poured a copper color with a white head that lasted throughout. The nose is hops with some pine and citrus. The beer is smooth and the hops really come through. Very bitter towards the end. I enjoyed it but I don't think I could have more than a couple in one sitting because it's so dry at the end."
"Has flavor, but it has too dominant of one flavor rather than a pleasant blend."
"Victory's Hop Devil was one of the first American IPAs I tried (and consequently one of the first beers to turn me onto bombastic hoppiness). It has been around for some time and remains a wonderful IPA, arguably still among the best the East Coast has to offer in the style. Right down the checklist, it fits all the criteria. It is, without doubt, a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer."
"D- Somewhat drinkable, but not an all nighter. The bitterness gets to you after one or two, but all in all is a good ale."
"D - Drinkability is hard to judge on this one. It is quite bitter, beyond the point of being refreshing IMO, but they squeeze a lot of flavor from the hops as well. I can't see myself drinking more than one in a sitting, but the six pack won't last long. Overall, another winner from victory."
"Considering that I loved, loved, loved the Hop Wallop, I was expecting to enjoy this more. It's a good beer, but for a ""hop bomb"" it lacks the complexity or drinkability of the Ballast Point or Stone brews I keep returning to."
"Impressive size and body, it's a powerful ale that could almost compete with an Old Ale or Strong Ale with its massive flavor and depth."
"O: Among the most drinkable IPA’s out there... this just keeps going and going and going down the throat... not for the faint of heart!"
"D: Very high. Not very nuanced, but a tasty, dry thirst quencher."
"D: Bitter, but very drinkable."
"Very drinkable."
"love the hoppieness !!! nice amber color,with a slight creamy head; a little brownish tint to it, once you open the bottle you are greeted with a nice spicy hop aroma;it overpowers all other aromas(though i am getting over a cold) the flavor is not for the amatuer, i can taste hops all the way through; i believe some of the bitterness can be attributed to the darker (dark crystal maybe) malt; a nice med-full bodied mouthfeel; over all i really like this beer & i don't genarally drink IPA's or other agressively hopped beers"
"Medium amber, copper, frothy head good retention.Citrusy, malty note in the nose. Hoppy bitterness as it should, not much citrus(grapefruit or otherwise), bitterness lingers. Slighty chewy.. may be the carbonation. Could drink a bunch of this. Thumbs up :)"
"Pours clear deep copper with insignificant head, but good lace. The aroma carries balanced caramel malts, fruit and pine hop notes. Flavor show-cases a superb mix of toasty biscuit and caramel malts with pine hops and a medium sweet finish. Body is medium rich, a bit syrupy yet still juicy and fresh. An excellent American IPA that's distinguished by its sense of balance."
"Dark amber to orange in color with rings of lacing sticking to the glass as its consumed. Being an IPA brewed on the East Coast, it's a little more balanced to boot. Citrus. grapefruit and piney notes run aorund with the flavor with a kick of malt. It didn't taste that bitter at all, making it quite drinkable."
"Great drinakability, a bit too hoppy to be perfect. But a damn fine beer. I wish it was available in my area."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a decent frothy head that is slow to diminish. Aroma is some pine hops and caramel malts. The taste is a great balance of caramel and both pine and mild citrus hops with the hops only slightly overpowering the malts. The beer is medium bodied with slightly hidden alcohol, but it does provide warmth. This is certainly one of the best widely available year round IPAs."
"D: Oh yeah! This is kind of underrated. If you want to get away from the citrus hop-bombs without departing from the IPA style. This is worth checking out"
"This is a great hoppy beer! It has an excellet hoppy bouquet and flavor without being overly bitter. It has a nice dark, coppery coloring with a good head. Wonderful balance of malts to help keep the hoppiness smooth. I highly recommend this if you would like a slightly darker, hoppy beer. My wife particularly enjoyed this beer and kept going back for more of this, even when there were other brews to be tried."
"This beer pours a nice amber red, mostly clear with a medium creamy white head. Lacing is good. The smell is very good with a near perfect mix of hops, sweetness, and a hint of bitterness all combined to yield a pine like aroma that is very nice. The taste is very forward with sweet pine followed by the citrusy hop flavor with a hint of bitterness, very nice. The body/mouthfeel is a little thin given the profile of this beer. A little heavier would be better. Carbonation is good. This is a drinkable beer and well worth the price of admission."
"The shining star of this brew is the smell. A good solid presentation of hops and malts, balanced in a war for your attention. The actual taste doesn't quite live up to the fanfare, but it's a great drink nonetheless - not quite as savoury as some other american IPAs."
"A very nice IPA. I think I prefer Wallop from Victory, but this is easier to drink (if you like hops), and not quite as heavy on the ABV."
"D- This is a nice, close-to sessional as I can get. It's local for me and well-done, but much better on-tap. Another nice one from Victory."
"One of Victory's best"
"Eric"
"Pours a light copper with a finger and a half of head that dies slow and remains at a 1/4 inch. Smells of grapefruit hops and malt. Nothing strong but all present. Tastes as it smells, yes there are hops but not as much as I usually like my IPAs. Full malty balance in this one along with citrus rind. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation. Medium drinkability, for an IPA I look for more hops and less malt but this still is a tasty beverage"
"A deep amber color with a two finger thick head, off white in color, that has good retention. The scent starts out with good malt fragrance, then a combination of grassy, earthy, and pine scents dominate the fragrance. The flavor comes out with the malt, that gives it slight bready taste. Then a herbal bitterness of grass and pine comes in midway, leaving a a bit of an after taste. A medium bodied feel is consistant all the way through, but it does leave an oily feel at the back end. This is a very easy to drink beer, impressive in the flavor and aroma, though the feel was very good, the oily texture was a sligtht tyrn off. This is is still an excellent beer, I just want to go get another one."
"D: This is a great standard IPA that I could definitely see putting back on a routine basis. Definitely recommended if you dig IPAs."
"D - I will buy this again. I am recently buying more IPAs because they don't make me feel as full as the stouts and porters I usually like. Definitely try this IPA, even though it can be hard to find. But I do know a bar in Allston that serves it, haha. cheers!"
"overall, wow this beer is truly a gem very nice"
"I put my scores the way I did to reflect it's keeping with the style not my own personal tastes but I would say I'm not planning on revisiting this particular beer until I've had some more IPA experience and think I'm ready for a hoppier product"
"This beer was a little to heavy for my personbal taste. It was also a bit too bitter because of the heavy level of hops in it. It finished somewhat clean but definately(to me) tasted better colder. I will be very honest, I only ordered it because it had an awesome looking bottle. I would just rather drink a differnt IPA stlye beer, so I consider thios one just ""average"""
"Excellent IPA, on the toasty side."
"My bottle had a ""drink by"" date of Oct 20 2007. No information as to the bottling date. A tulip did not seem to be the proper glass for this beer, but its all I had."
"D: HopDevil on cask was a revelation, robust and delicious. If you love HopDevil from a bottle, you'll flip for the cask."
"i know some hopheads have been slightly disappointed, since there is ""hop"" in the name, after all. but hey, this is ""just"" an IPA! nowadays, i think a hophead has to go for the double-IPA's instead, in order to get their fix, no?"
"Overall: Excellent! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys hoppy IPAs or even double IPAs."
"The flavor is a blast of American hops, oily to the taste and dry to the finish. But there's also a substantial malt presence to this brew which balances it out nicely. A nice molasses flavor cuts into the bitterness with some force. Mouthfeel is very dry in the finish. This beer is a bit filling, but tasty enough not to let that slow you down. Overall a very good IPA from Victory. Can't wait to try the Wallop."
"I have had this beer a few times in the bottle and was not impressed. Last night proved to me that I am not a fan. The beer was not terrible, by any means."
"4 pumps from the hand tap and the beer was in all of its amber glory.The awesome smell of hop,mabey cascades,the smell is more potent in the cask then bottle IMO.The head stood there for a minute of so,the beer was oh so creamy and at perfect temp. The malt was perfect complimenting the hops.This beer is no way over the top but it is a awesome interpitation of the style and im glad that It is a year round beer.The only fault to the beer is its abv. it will hit ya after a couple.The hops tasted so vibrant then the malt came in to knock them down a bit.A all around great beer."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a best-by date of October 25, 2007. Pours a hazy copper with a slim, foamy white head. Good retention; leaves a rim of foam around the edge of the glass. Smells of caramel and fresh, crisp hops. Some citrus aromas, like orange. Taste begins with piny hops, then centers on the sweet caramel, then finishes cleanly with the hops again. Light, fizzy carbonation on the front of the tongue; complements flavors well. Overall, this is a well-balanced IPA, wonderful for drinking. Not one of the extreme IPAs for hopheads, but still a great example of the style anyway."
"D: This is one nice IPA, glad it is easily available in central Ohio. Score another for Victory!"
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with just under a finger of white head and minimal lacing. Floral, piney, and earthy hops dominate the aroma but there is just the merest hint of malt sweetness in the background. Taste is dominated by floral and piney hops with a level of bitterness that is high without being overwhelming. At the finish I am able to detect just a bit of malt sweetness that balances this brew out quite nicely. Good lingering hop flavor and bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, medium body, low to moderate carbonation with a nice oily-slickness at the finish. Great hop flavor and drinkability."
"Poured into a pint glass with vigor. A great representation of an IPA. Certainly a session beer for the hot summer months."
" It's bitter but not that way too much pucker, the taste of lemon peel and caramel letting it go down smooth. The hops linger leaving a nice little twang in the mouth once it's down the throat but not anything shouting too loud ""I'm 6.7% abv"" the way a bunch of others do. Nice medium body...not too fizzy nor too oily. The only complain I have is the name Hop Devil itself. After all it's got a hop bud fancied as a devil's face on the label. Off the name alone I was expecting something a bit more over the top and maybe a belly ache/esophagus fire the next day like a Two Hearted Ale (which are a treat once every few month or so but I still would prefer not get stuck with entirely for an evening cuz after a few they fall under the ""a bit too much"" category for me) or the ""This rules but where is the fine line between it and barley wine?"" thing of Hop Slam (Yeah...I realize I used tow different things Bell's makes as my reference point. Hey! I'm Michigan born and raised! Homeland pride brothers and sisters!!!) at first and that was what I was prepared for. I don't feel let down at all that this is a bit more mellow than that...An almost perfect mellow as a matter of fact....A mellow that I can share with friends who are even of the too much persuasion as well as those that like the bite. No matter the season either. There's something about the way these guys do things (though I'm gonna wait til the colder months roll in before I try their Storm King Stout) where I have to say Victory does it again!!!"
"This beer is a great beer for drinking with good friends and family. Everyone that I have introduced to this ale went out the next day and bought a case. In fact I shared a bottle with my local distributor owner and he now carries Hopdevil for those of us that crave a hoppy experience."
"Drinkiness: I could drink this all day and all night. It is very smooth and good for repeated drinking. If you like hops, than you'll love this brew."
"D: Easy summer drinking. Very tasty and nice example of the style. Highly recommended."
"The aroma is great but fools you into thinking it will be hoppier. Look at the name, for crying out loud. I know people whine about balance, but I can tell a good hoppy beer by the way it makes the back of my gums tingle and this doesnt do it. Too much malt here for a hop devil. I recommend Bells two-hearted or weyerbachers hop-infused."
"Zum wohl!"
"Drinkability - Instead of crafting a monster of an IPA, the relative weekness makes this a more sessionable AIPA. And as I whole heartedly believe, hoppy beers are always the most refreshing on a hot day. Here's to hops!"
"A pretty good IPA, but has never been one of my favorites even though Victory is one of my favorite breweries. Seems kind of thin but has a nice hop kick."
"Drinkability: I found this to be a pretty good IPA, I liked the malt."
"Overall Impression: A perfectly balanced India Pale Ale. This one is not overly done on the hop bitterness at all. It's actually refreshing. Would be perfect after a hot summers day just before sunset, especially when the fishing is just right."
"I was excited to see this at my hometown grocery-store in a six pack. A hazy burnt orange with that frothy IPA head that sticks everywhere. So delicious and actually quite smooth drinking. Smoothness doesn't hide the great hop flavor with heady garden notes and a finish of fizzy pepper. Easier to drink than some other hopped-up beers of the same nature, really a great job by Victory."
"This beer seems to get quite a bit of hype in my opinion but I think it's just kind of your average good IPA. A good selection none the less."
"D. Very drinkable! Ican see why Alyeast went to the trouble to get the first SC keg of this!!"
"Pours a slightly hazy blood orange color with a small dense off-white head, not much lacing. The smell is piney with a hint of grapefruit, honey and malt. The taste is grapefruit rind up front and center, a decent toasted malt backbone, some resin. I just discovered that this is an old bottle so some of the fresh hop taste is obviously gone, arg! Still a good hop flavor, though. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture, there is a bitterness that kind of numbs the palate. A good AIPA, though I feel I missed out on some of the fresh hops due to the old bottle. I look forward to trying a fresh sample."
"D: Very balanced, incredibly drinkable, a great East Coast IPA; make a deal with the Hopdevil, you won't be dissapointed."
"Mouthfeel successfully avoids any oiliness and provides a thick, full-bodied beverage. About as drinkable as IPAs get, this one is a modern classic."
"NOTE: A year and a half later I have developed a great liking for IPAs and would like to review this beer again. I bet I would like it better now..."
"d- Nice tasty IPA that is not too overwhelming, hangs well with its West Coast brethren, unique earthiness stands out well"
"All in all, a great beer I'll have a again. A low-yield hop bomb so it's drinkable, but there are some better ones out there to have several of in one sitting."
"Overall, HopDevil is an excellent choice at a bargain price (at least where I got it). It's hoppy enough to frighten the weaker beers away, but light enough to be more refreshing than the Double IPAs."
"It looks good nice color and head. But that is where good ends and bad to worse starts. It smells like a decent IPA with malts and lots of hops but then a whiff of, (I don't know what) hits me. I really don't know what to call it, plastic? or soap. Whatever the smell is it is even more prevalent in the taste. A very distinctive yuck aftertaste. To its credit the beer is much better as it warms but I will be very gun shy about trying another."
"Two Thumbs Up"
"pours a dark amber honey color with a beautiful head and a decent lacing as it defuses. smells GREAT, apples and other fruits (my brother says cranberry) Hops of course are prevalent as is a piney, fruity tastes very good mouthfeel, full and solid, a good ipa, i like them a bit stronger but this one is very well done"
"Poured amber into imperial pint glass. White head dissapates but good lacing intact. Hops come out in the smell but not as strong as the name would suggest. Very well balanced in the taste, huge hops with enough malt to get you through to the sweet aftertaste. At 6.7% these might be a little too easy to drink."
"Pours a nice deep amber color with a nice big white head. In the aroma it has hops and faint smell of alcohol. It has the a big hop presence and a spicy, abrasive malt characteristic. This was the first IPA I ever drank on a regular basis, and I remember saying to my girlfriend (now wife) ""I will not marry a girl unless she likes Hop Devil"" Guess what we drank at our wedding?!"
"Good IPA probably the best I have had that was made east of the Rockies. Nice balance, flavor, and drinkability. Worth trying."
"D- I find it quite drinkable, but I'm a hophead. If you like balanced beers, this one is good, but you have to stand up to the bitter hop oil finish. I'll buy it again though. cheers."
"The great thing about reviewing beers on websites like this is the compulsory tastings that you've had before but must ""force"" yourself through again...bought a nice sampler for my son's baptismal afterparty... the guests were pleased...solid one-finger head holds well...a controlled hops explosion to the nostrils, among fresh-cut grass, a fresh-cut cigar and the M&M factory for smells that entrance...vivacious and smooth despite the IPA status...crisp, demanding yet not overstated as other American IPAs can often invade the senses with militaristic carelessness...either the Cavs have me pumped or the alcohol is sneaky quick...as impressive an IPA as I could imagine...if Victory makes a beer unworthy of recognition, I haven't had it yet..."
"Drinkability: Medium light mouthfeel. Great balance of hops and maltiness makes for a good example of an American style IPA. Highly recommended for hop heads."
"On tap at Howard's Pub in Ocracoke NC, reddish orange color, head had diminished by the time it had gotten to my table, what was left was white with some lacing. Aromas of hops and some malt. Plenty of citric hop bitterness in the flavor balanced with some malt then the hops have the final say in the finish. My favorite example in the style and a big improvement over the bottle I had a couple of years ago. This is an ideal session beer, especially on tap."
"Pours a deep, clear copper with a one-finger, creamy off-white head that keeps its shape and leaves rings of lacing. The smell is mostly hops with some floral and citric notes poking through. Taste is tangy, subtly sweet maltiness up front giving away to a long, bitter finish. Some citrus fruit mixed in with the malts, but not as grapefruity as others. The bitterness takes over to dominate in a big way, however, about halfway through -- almost on the level of a Smutty or a Bell's 2-Hearted. The mouthfeel is dry and quenching, not overly carbonated, but somewhat thinner than I would have expected. Decent drinkability for the ABV. Would also pair well with spicy foods."
"Quite drinkable; another nice beverage from Victory."
"Poured a light copper body (even though I didnt have too much) with a small white head that stuck around for a bit. Smells are of strong hops as I would expected that made my mouth water to try it. The first taste that hits your mouth was the hops, with some bitterness on the finish-pretty continuous throughout the sample. I had heard about this brewery before and was pleasantly suprised to see it on tap in such a small bar and although my sample was small as well it fulfilled my expectations-I would like to try again under different circumstances as I think that this could be a great hoppy beer that I could have over and over again."
"I finally start to understand IPAs better now, but still I feel differences between them are quite small between a high ranked beer and a 'mediocre' beer. This was a good beer though."
"I must say that this is not the kind of IPA I am used to. A bit maltier. Not as citrusy/piney as I would like. The hops don't seem to show up except for bitterness. At the same time, this is a pretty easy drinker. Solid, easy, but not great."
"I previously reviewed this beer on cask. The bottled version is nowhere near as smooth and tastes a bit hoppier than from the cask, but that does not make this an undrinkable brew. This is still a top notch IPA, and as with most Victory beers, it doesn't disappoint."
"I got this in a 12 ounce cup at the Wachovia Center. I was suprised when I saw a Victory stand and was shocked that this would be at a basketball game. It poured a deep yet light brown color with no head at all. There was however, a fair amount of lacing all the way down. The smell had a nice hop smell and the taste had lingers of the same. There was a bit of a bite to the mouthfeel that I didn't really like that much. For the most part this was a just above average beer. Don't drink and review."
"Tastes is definitely about the hops, bitter and strong. Some maltiness in there sweetens it up a bit and creates enough balance to be very enjoyable, but you know it's about the hops with this beer. So much flavor it compares to a dIPA more than just an IPA. Very good beer."
"Brassy, golden-amber in color, and brilliant. Poured from a freshly-tapped keg, this was served with a one and a half fingered pale tan head, with moderate lacing and duration. Piney, resiny hops on the nose, with just a touch of biscuit and caramel in the malt profile. Spicey hops are all over the first sip, and the mouthfeel seems fairly light and cleansing. Mild, lingering bitterness with toasted malts almost floating above the aromatic and bittering hops. Not a small beer and not a big beer, but right in-between, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Semi-sweet, with a nice juicy malt quality registering about halfway through the palate. Medium bodied, and much more well-balanced than I recall it being from the last bottle I enjoyed. Plenty of dryness. A fine American IPA, and very consistent."
"D- Only bought one, but I could enjoy 2 maybe 3 on a long night. Very nice drink."
"Drinkability: Overall, its a fairly easygoing IPA, with none of the flavors ever really pronouncing themselves, leaving the experience a bit lacking."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, I enjoy this one a lot. The alcohol content isn't too high and the beer doesn't taste like slightly flavored perrier either."
"Overall a very good IPA. I don't usually like earthy flavors, but I definately enjoyed this beer. Well crafted and recommended."
"D: Stellar. Glad I have another one in the fridge!"
"Taste is piney off the top, then mellows a bit into the more floral aspects. Acidity is less citric than sprucey. Herbal and curative in its assertiveness. Highly acidic, this is a bit of a palate-scorcher to be sure. Toasty caramel maltmakes an entrance in the background, along with a bit of vanilla and yeasty breadiness, but the malt is definitely playing second violin here. Less balanced than I would have hoped, but it's not a huge criticism really. Mouthfeel is buzzy due to the high acid levels, not so much from the carbonation, which is medium at best. Medium body, nice and sticky going down. This is drinkable, but in small sips and you want to savour every one."
"The drinkabilty is near perfect. well balanced."
"D: This is a great, easy drinking IPA. It's not the hoppiest, spiciest, or best - but as far as a session IPA - this is about as good as they come. Great."
"This is one sessionable beer. TRY IT!!!"
"A good IPA with a nice foamy head and fantastic head retention. Poured a copper orange colour with the slightest bit of chill-haze. Nose was floral hops a caramel. Taste was hoppy bitterness with a mildly sweet malty finish. As with nearly everything else I have had from Victory, this was very well balanced. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth with the just the right amount of CO2. American IPAs really aren't my style, but for what this is, and the hops heads it's targeted towards, it is a really nice ale, indeed."
"D - Good beer with nice hop flavor. easty to drink with interesting enough flavor to taste against other IPAs"
"Medium bodied and a little sticky. I like an IPA that isn't set on hop overload. I'd certainly have a few more but no more than that."
"D: Would love to get this on tap -- tastes mighty good from the bottle as well though I like several other IPAs more because they more flavors than strong hops with a little malt and fruit (i.e. Stone IPA, Bell's Two-Hearted Ale)."
"Pours a medium amber with one finger off white head and nice lacing. Aroma is crazy hops. Taste is piny earthy oily hops. I do not detect much if any citrus at all. Aggressively bitter with no balance. Mouthfeel is on the painful side of bitter. Not very drinkable at all. This one was very disappointing after the high ratings. No subtlety at all and not nearly as drinkable as many other IPAs. If you want crazy hops and bitters with little balance, this one's for you."
"12 oz. bottle, front of label says best before 4/21/07, so I'm late by about a week, no big deal. Head retention is good, lacing just OK. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a red/orange color with about an inch off-white head. It smells like pine and citrusy hops. The taste is citrusy and pine hops (grapefruit) with a bit of malt, but it's the hops that are the most noticable. Very nice bitter taste too. Mouthfeel is medium, with it being a bit creamy and oily/slick. Drinkability is good, it's even better if you're a hophead. Overall I think it's a pretty decent IPA."
"As soon as I popped open a bottle, I could smell the sweetness of the brew. Upon pouring it out, a nice reddish/orange color permeated the glass. It literally looked like maple syrup straight out of a maple tree. The taste was, as one previous reviewer stated, all hops. I could feel the hops from the moment they hit my mouth. After getting over the hops, I tasted some fruit in the beer. As for the drinkability, I did not notice how much I had in one instance until I looked at the glass. I could probably polish off three before my night is done. It goes really well with grilled chicken and corn. Enjoy!"
"Taste and moutfeel: A bit famililar but that's not a bad thing it hits the palate nice and creamy with a bite of bitterness for hop lovers like me an extravagant ale that goes down smooth and clean I recommend this brew to people who enjoy good beers."
"Drinkability - Love this brew a lot, can't go wrong with Victory. Definetly provides a great compairson to Stone to show the West Coast vs. East Coast style IPA's. This East coaster with it's raw characteristics and darker style definetly holds it's own. That being said, I gotta give the edge to Stone (which surprised me since I consider Victory one of my hometown brews and was prepared to give them the local edge). Still, check this one out and do your own comparison, you won't be sorry. Looking forward to pairing up DFH 60 Min. to see how it can roll with the big boys."
"D: I don't think I could drink more than a couple three of these, but it is a very enjoyable change of pace for a non-hop head"
"Overall: a damn fine IPA. One of the best as a matter of fact and certainly deserves its high rating. I could also drink this all night and to me this is a great ""drunk"" session beer. Meaning it is a session beer to me because i would happily drink it all night and end up getting drunk and be fine with that because it is so damn good. If you like IPA's, this is on your to drink list."
"I am not sure about everyone else but this came across as more of an English IPA then American. I say so due to the more balanced flavor of the brew (malt), reminded me a lot of McEwan's IPA (which I have read is a repackaged Special Import). This would be a nice session beer but personally, I would have wanted a lot more hops for a beer calling itself a ""Hop Devil."""
"Very good IPA. I love how the bitter finish lasts and the mouthfeel is good but overall I prefer Stone, SN, or Smuttynose IPA."
"I don't know why but I was not impressed by this beer. Being an IPA lover I was encouraged by other reviews and very excited to try this. I don't know if I got a bad batch (I know it was fresh, there is a date and it was in the cooler) or if this one just doesn't suit my fancy. I do plan on giving this beer another shot in the future."
"When poured in glass you get a light brown color with a hint of red that is hazy. Staying true to its name, the aroma is hoppy as with the taste. The aftertaste is very bitter and hoppy as well. Carbonation isnt very strong which fits it perfectly. Drinkability not as high as others because of the bitter hoppiness which doesnt always settle well."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and pretty easy to drink. I'd happily take down a few. Carbonation and abv perfect for this beer. Overall, this is a really good IPA. Highly recommended."
"D-This is a tasty drink that i will order from fresh direct again. A very interesting IPA, I would lean towards calling it an East Coast American IPA if that were a category. The brews on the west coast tend to have a stronger pine taste. Closer to Englan I suppose."
"I was anxious to try this beer from all I had heard about it. Sad to say I was disappointed by the lack of a hoppy punch compared to say...Hopslam, Two-Hearted or Great Divide Titan. Still a very drinkable beer."
"An Excellent Beer!!"
"Not a very thick head when poured. The head has a beige tinge to it. Pours a nice, thick-looking amber/copper color. Smells like . . .citrus, lemon or lime stand out with some piney after notes. Mouthfeel is slightly thick. Big hop flavor, almost consumes this entire beer but there is a malt backbone towards the middle and then finishes a touch dry with the pine flavor lingering. Bitterness suites the style. Overall a damned good drinking beer. It may be a touch too heavy on the body but it's a good beer, just make sure you let it warm up a bit to get all the goodies in there."
"D: oh yea..."
"D: I have tried this beer straight from the bottle, off the tap and out of a cask and I enjoyed this spicey little hop bomb every single time. Recomended."
"EDIT: what i thought to be Fuggles was, evidently, Tettnang(er) instead. apparently, these two strains are similar, according to the Hopunion Databook."
"Not a bad beer by any means. I've had it from the bottle and enjoyed it so I figured why not try it in a potentially better form. It looks good, much more red in color than the IPA I tried before. Almost looks like a completely different style of beer when you have the two side by side. Good looking creamy head that hangs around for a while. The smell is more malty than hoppy to be honest. I'm wondering where the hops went. Taste is also lacking that crisp hop kick that I've accustomed myself to. They are there but well covered by a malty sweetness. It kinds of seems slightly watered down a little. Not sure what the deal is here. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and I can get a better sense of the hops. Solid. Pretty drinkable beer in the end. It doesn't stand up to what I drank before it but I can't complain. Well, one complaint. It was a dollar more...which I couldn't come to understand at $4.50. I would have enjoyed the initial hoppy flavored that I got from the bottle but I could have easily enjoyed a few more."
"Hop heaven. This beer pours a nice redbrown hue the is beautiful. the head is big but short lived with some nice lacing. The aroma is hop overdose, very good. The flavor follows suit with hops and sweetness. I enjoy this alot. The beer has another taste that i cant wuite put my finger on, but is good. there is a slight bitterness both in the fin ish and aftertaste. The body is nice and medium, once again a beer that is more full than limp. I would suggest this beer to anyone who is into the hop flavor."
"""eff"" marcos and corporate a-holes!"
"Drinkability - Easy. This is my session beer. And yes, I think I will have another..."
"Poured from a bottle, it's a very dark IPA, reddish brown almost like a Doppelbock. The nose is deceivingly mild hops in contrast to the robust mix of hops, caramel and pine on the palate. Mouthfeel is suitable for the variety with a dry finish. If you like IPAs, drinkability is good."
"edited on 11-7-07"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice copper color with a medium head that remained thru the sample. The smell has traces of hops and sweetness, but they are slight and not what you would expect for a beer called HopDevil. The taste was even for my liking. This beer was hoppy before the rise of hopbombs, but now it is middle of the road. Enough resin is there to coat your mouth, but not enough to burn like others. The mouthfeel is thick for my liking, with a malt aftertaste on the back of my throat. This beer remains popular and I will have it again, more on tap than in the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is a bit soapy. I don't remember that from before. Dry and bitter aftertaste. I can get over the soapiness and a enjoy a couple more of these tonight while I watch my 'Heels in the tourney."
"Hazy, copper in color. White fluffy head that trickles down to a thin ring rather quickly. Piney, grassy, floral, and herbal hop aroma. Good sturdy caramel malt background, mixed with grassy and herbal hops. Good amount of bitterness, but I was expecting a bit more. Seems just a bit thin. Well balanced, as the malt character is very nice. Easy to drink. Pretty good. A little different hop character than most of the big hop bombs."
"D: I drank this pretty quickly. And yeah, I'd have another. This wasn't nearly as bitter as I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting an IPA this balanced, either. It filled my Q Zone with pure beer goodness."
"Bottle courtesy of HogTown Harry- thanks! Pours out a robust tangerine colour witha pretty good head. Quite a cloudy brew, but definitely a solid IPA colour. Aroma is a nice combination of hops and malt sweetness. Very balanced IPA I thought- tons of hops - herbal and piney and grapefruit but also a strong backbone. Finishes dry as it should for an IPA. Carbonation was a little higher than expected, but gives it a good snap in the mouth with the hops. This a very solid IPA and would be a good but dangerous session brew. Very enjoyable!"
"Mouth is medium bordering on thin. This is a solid beer and very drinkable."
"I quite enjoyed this beer and would pick up another six pack when able. I would also be interested in trying this one on tap."
"I'd crack another anytime."
"If I could get ahold of lots of these I would love to session a case or two! Victory for your taste indeed!"
"Cheers!"
"appearance was deep apricot in hue, somewhat cloudy, bouqet was loads of citrus, floral, pine, caramel, honey, taste was similar to nose, also some nice stone fruits, the intense bitter hops well-balanced by the residual caramel malt sweetness, mouthfeel was medium-heavy and pretty viscous, drinkability suffers only from the necessarily significant alc content and big body, this is a fine example of the dipa style and definitely a fridge staple at the moment."
"The taste starts with an even hit of malt and hops, grassy and kettle hops and /or citrus.At this time, the hops take immediate control over the ever present malts in the background, with a strong citrus regime, grapefruit/lemon. Mouthfreel is full bodied and crisp. Exellent brew."
"Overall, wonderfully hopped beer with well-rounded attributes. Strong, yet not challenging to drink. Seems to taste a bit better on tap, as I recall."
"My apologies if that seems rambling or silly, but it was heartfelt. May my Karma be struck dead."
"This is one of the best beers brewed in the U.S. It is a big, hoppy beer. The flavor of hops comes through clean and pure. Although I typically don't enjoy beers over 6% ABV (unless from Belgium) this beer does not have that alcohol flavor so many American IPA's have. I definitely need to visit the brewery for a fresh sample, but doubt it could be any better."
"Large bitter bite... lingering citrus with some spicy pine notes. A very nice beer."
"Translucent light copper color. White head with large bubbles that faded to a halo of foam. Low levels of carbonation rising in tumbler. Hardly a nose on this beer which makes me suspect along with the low carbonation an older sample. Faint flowery and fruity hops smell. The bitter taste on this one is very earthy that reminds me of a German dunkel. Mouthfeel is on lighter side with a bitter drying finish. Will definitely have to have another one because I generally like stuff from Victory."
"D- Too astringent for its own good. Not bad, but not great either. I am glad I tried it though."
"Enjoyable IPA. Beastie malt, sharp hop."
" The hops taste piney, with nutty caramel malt. The taste is balanced. The beer is creamy and smooth on the palate. I have drank this beer on two prior occassions, and this time, I actually enjoy the beer. This wouldn't fix my hops craving, but it is a tasty IPA nonetheless."
"Drinkability - good if you are looking for a focus on bittering hops and for the same reason not a good session beer."
"~E. Brad"
"Drinkability - Nice ipa, doesn't have the grapefruit taste to it. Nice beer to try. Victory does have some good beers."
"pours very cloudy orange amber color with a two finger light tan head that holds fairly well with a nice lacing to the finish. now this beer is not kidding a citrus and large pine hop aroma. toasted malt and citrus with that pine hop all through the taste, just great. excellent balance of malt and hop and carbonation, medium mouthfeel and nice hop bite. definitely looking for this one next trip out."
"Drinkability: Very nice solid IPA. Not too sweet or dry very flavorful. Great quality IPA."
"Drinkability is huge. This beer is one of my favorites. I could, and have drink this all night!"
"HopDevil pours from the tap a deep amber-red color with a white head. The consistency of the foam is creamy but not bitter, unfortunately it dies down to a thin film after a few sips. The smell is a hit of hops to the nose with a subtle caramel undertone. The taste is not overpowering and has a distinct hop taste on the front of the tongue and lingers with bitter notes in the aftertaste, though not at all unpleasant. The mouthfeel is a little above average due to the malt needed to balance out the high IBUs of the brew. Very drinkable as it is not heavy and does not impart a sour taste in the mouth, but at 6.7% ABV, moderation is golden! A great offering from Victory and the beer stands up to the hype with all of the awards it has garnered."
"Served at about 50-55 degrees, the appearance was a deep ruby amber. Full, thick and creamy head. Tons of retention and Belgian lace down the pint. Not quite as big a nose than from the tap, but still lots of citrus hop scents. The taste was next to perfect for an IPA. The higher serving temperature and lower carbonation allowed for an incredible mix of malt sweetness and spicy hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is bready, but the hops still dominate with a biting spiciness, with both grapefruit and pine flavors, followed by a lingering alcohol aftertaste. With such a smooth and chewy mouth-feel you can only get from beer from the engine, I wish all beers could be served this way."
"Even me, the anti-hophead, can appreciate this balanced beer. :)"
"This beer pours a crisp clean looking amber with a yellow orangish head that fades but does remain on top of the beer. Aroma is very weak. Some citrus notes, bitter smelling, no floral or fruit in the nose at all, disappointing. It is a shocking beer to the palate, all hops. Very blunt up front, citrusy, it seems as if the hop bitterness is overwhelming the hop flavor. Spicy hot from the hops, and they manage to cover the malt almost completely. Not well balanced. Could have used some more base malt in my estimation, because kicking it up to eight percent may have balanced this beer more. Worth the try, but I would not purchase this beer again."
"Appearance is a hazy honey color. The head is thin and frothy but disappears in a few minutes. The smell is a wonderful combination of citrus, honey and sweet malt. It really adds to the enjoyment of the beer. The taste is at first sweet and almost honey-like. Lots of hops but well-balanced with malt. A slight buttery finish at the end. This beer is downright delicious. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and refreshing. Drinkability is outstanding... a very good session beer. Overall, this is a great beer and my favorite IPA so far."
"Just snagged a sixer on a return trip home through Asheville, NC. This was the first time I'd seen Victory in my general area so I was eager to see what all the BA hype was all about. I was not disappointed. The beer was very complex and strong without being over complicated or affecting its drinkability. The hops were prevalent and plentiful, but not without just enough maltiness for proper balance on both the nose and tongue. Mouthfeel was great with a medium body, perfect carbonation and viscosity. I found it to be a very smooth drinking IPA for one that has a little more ABV than a typical session beer. The results of which could result in not exactly looking or feeling one's best the next a.m. All in all I was glad to get to finally try a Victory brew, and I will have to return for some Prima Pils when I get a chance. Well deserved praise. Hype on BA's."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a 1/4 inch head, that slowly faded, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops. The taste is oh so good! Hops and more hops. Nice citrus flavor, but not overkill, with a good balance of malts. Thick medium mouthfeel, but very smooth. This is a great pale ale, and a very good session ale. I think I've found a new favorite."
"Definately give this a try."
"This beer is very drinkable and almost goes down to easy."
"D - This is what IPAs should taste like..only a little bit stronger on the aromas."
"D: Good beer, easy to drink due to the balance of malt. Not as good as HopBack Amber, but good nonetheless."
"D - A well rounded and tasty IPA that is certainly worth enjoying. Quaffable and interesting enough where I will probably be buying more in the future."
"Cheers."
"Overall: This is an excellent American IPA."
"An outstanding IPA."
"This is a rock solid crafted APA with all the Pacific NW hop flair out pacing the big malts...not as full bodied and balanced as Libery ale but good standard sipping fare for hop heads"
"Overall - A nice beer if you like a stronger IPA with good hop and malt characteristics."
"One final note, if you can find this on tap, as I do at Tallula in Arlington, VA, you'll find a slightly smoother, less carbonated mouthfeel. Definitely worth seeking out."
"I can't say enough about the HopDevil. Fantastic IPA that provides quite a kick both with it's hoppy flavor and ABV. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is a fan of the IPA style. This is my new default beer, as it is both economical and extremely tasty. Cheers!"
"Clean finish. Crisp. Drinkability overshadows the taste, it'll hook ya."
"Pours a nice amber from the bottle. A very hoppy nose attacked my nostrils. The first few drinks were almost rough until my mouth adjusted to the hoppyness of the beer. A fine citrus with an evergreen undertone. Very drinkable with slight grapefruit after taste."
"My only caveat would be the intense amount of hops for the uninitiated. As for me, I could drink this amazing stuff all day long."
"right."
"A good American IPA, loaded with crisp hops. Very delicious. Recommended."
"This is a good IPA, with well balanced and bold tones. I was expecting more though, probably b/c of the name...however, still worth a try."
"Overall drinkability was fairly high, the beer needed to warm just a tad before it really got going."
"Thanks for the bottle Mikesgroove!"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a orange color with a white head that leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is of hoppy malty goodness it has that nice citrus hop smell that we love. Taste is awesome goodness if you like a balanced hoppy beer, you can taste some smooth bitter goodness very hoppy with a citrus flair that goes down smooth with a bit of alcohol burn. Awesome offering from victory."
"Pours a rich copper with a nice creamy colored head and significant lace. Looks great. Smell is richly hopped , with even a bit of a sugary presence. Taste was very nice, not overly upfront with the hops, but it will catch you on the back end. Nice dry finish. Again that almost caramel malty taste rounds this out very nicely. Very smooth as well. This is a good IPA that is not Crazy Hopped, although I do prefer insanely hopped beers. Overall very nice."
"Poured out of a very cool looking bottle into a pint glass, this beer is amber-brown in color with a decent one finger bubbly head. Head dies down quickly and leaves small bits of lacing on the glass. The smell is of spicy hops. The taste follows suit, with a sweet grapefruity malt start and spicy hop finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy. Overall I would have to say this is a very drinkable beer, the 6.7 abv is very well hidden, a must try for hopheads everywhere."
"Drinkability: Not really a Devil of a beer, but it's still quite drinkable if you're ever in an IPA mood. I could drink it again in the future. I don't have a problem with that idea. I would have to say that is a must try after you had their great Storm King Stout."
"ABV is a bit high, but if you can handle it, have another. Drinkable if you like hops, and I do!"
"I think the malt here manifests more in the mouthfeel than in any obvious sweetness. This is a balanced and seeminly nonaggressive IPA."
"Pours a hazy orangish-brown with a two finger head with good retention. Aroma is citrus hops and sweet caramel and bread. Taste is of sweet bread and spice with some citrus and grassy notes in there as well. Also picking up a tea leaf flavor. Mouthfeel is really smooth. This is a very drinkable IPA. A very solid brew."
"Great beer. Very nice beer with a plate of cheese. This is a great offering in the style, and a great selection from a brewer with a nice history of superb beers."
"Overall, a good semi-aggressive ipa that offers taste, good bitter hops and sweet malt backbone, while still being soft on the palate and well balanced."
"I've had this beer and the storm king stout from victory so far. They seem to have a common theme of going overboard for a really bold and memorable product. Good job so far."
"Victory Brewing Company does not come out to my neck of the woods (Arizona) so during my recent trip to New York; I kept an eye out for it having heard great reviews from friends. I stopped by Barcade in Brooklyn where they had it casked. A deep ruby, colored somewhere in between a Brown ale and a Red. The aroma was very hop-rich, with subtle hints of sweetness. By smell alone you could definitely tell that it had been casked. Upon the first sip the hop pronunciation and earthy cask flavor were very bold, yet well balanced on the tongue. A loosely carbonated and moderately malty mouthfeel kept the hop flavors rolling across the tongue until the slight fruity and sweet finish. All in all a very impressive beer."
"Taste was considerable difference as for quality."
"I have a six of the bottles and the cask is - quite simply - a completely different beer. Very balanced and mellow, while the bottle is a pure hop bomb (and one I like a lot). Definately worth picking up while it's available."
"I'm a fan of the Victory beers, and this is no exception. Pours a dense apricot orange color. The aroma is hoppy and sweet, but not overpowering. A crisp, hoppy taste with a sturdy mouthfeel. A bit syrupy, but not so much as to detract from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Finishes well with a pleasantly lingering note of hop character at the roof of the mouth. And I even kinda like the bottle label. Nice ""hop devil."""
"D: Pour me another! The initial shock could begin to wear the palate thin, especially after a few. Still, a great beer to liven you up from a smack in the mouth with hops."
"Drinks really easy, a nice IPA that is now availible in CO, yeah!"
"The mouth is full and complex, begins a little lighter, then finishes with wallop of roasted and bitter hoppiness, yet it never grows unpleasant. I'm a hop fiend, but I still do not see drinking more than maybe two of these in a sitting. But who cares, it's an amazing beer."
"I will happily drink the rest of the sixer and keep an eye out for this one in the future."
"Slainte!"
"This is a shining example of an American IPA."
"D - Here the mouthfeel does the most damage. I had it before and I'll have it again. It is about as close as you can come to a beer staple in my opinion. I am not a huge victory fan, but this is definitely a good beer."
"D: Very tasty, not filling as it seemed a little light for the style, a good kick, this one is very poundable."
"Eh, I wasn't that impressed with this one. I was expecting more. The hops weren't as prominent as I had hoped. The balance between malt and hops was good no doubt, but the hop flavor was rather nondescript. It's alright, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. I had it on tap once and it was much better."
"d= not my favorite, but i wouldn't throw it out of bed for eating crackers."
"This beer pours a hazy brown amber color with a light head that settles into a nice lacing. It has a sweet malted hops smell with a slight sent of spice. The flavor is what really hits you about this beer. Its a strong spice with a heavy bite. The aftertaste is a little bitter but over all its got a good taste. This is one bold beer. The beer goes down smooth with a slight aftertaste. In all this is an interesting beer and worth a try. Its not my favorite IPA but it is worth trying."
"Beautiful amber color with a nice white head, good lacing as well. Grapefruit and piney hops, with a decent malt base. Biscuity beginning, grapefruit starts coming through, then pine before leading to a bit of a grassy finish. High carbonation, full body. I like it, and would have it again."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"D: Wow, what a great find. This is one of the finest east coast 'IPA-ish' ales I've tried. I'm partial to California brews, but this is one I'd take any day..."
"D: It seems stronger than 6.7% ABV, but the intriguing ""ninja attack"" nature of the hops makes it neither overwhelming nor boring. I could definitely drink several of these in a sitting. In fact, I think I will."
"Slightly fizzy feel, but not in a negative way. I can usually drink about two of these in a row before I have to move to an ale or witbier to cleanse the palate, just because the hops are so prevalent. This beer just exudes hops."
"I'm not really impressed. For me this falls into the category of beers that have no finesse, only hops. Maybe with the right insanely spicy food this would work better but for straight drinking it is completely one dimenstional."
"Notes - Drinkabity is good. Personaly i can make this a session brew. I really enjoyed this. More than other IPAs. I recommend this to anyone who loves hops and hasnt had the pleasure of sipping on this fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: Session brew for me and my father, the only craft brew drinkers in what feels like hundreds of miles. Its a good go to beer and it feels like a local beer to me, I like supporting the east coast breweries when I can."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability: The word quaff comes to mind. Very user-friendly without sacrificing character. Be careful, though. It's real easy to forget this baby's 6.7..."
"D-Very good. Probably one of my favorite IPA's."
"Poured from 12oz. bottle to a Abbaye du Val-Dieu snifterish glass. Rich amber looking color, spot on for an IPA. The pour was a little gentle, head was light, and disspated quickly. Smell is a good balance, floral and citrus hops, hint of pine, grassy, with some background grain. Taste is also balanced, American hops are up front, and there's a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is a little brisk, strangely somewhat astringent, with maybe slightly more carbonation than I expected. High drinkability for an IPA. I want more."
"I know I might get slammed for this review but i cant help it, I was really unimpressed with this beer. Poured a nice amber color and that is where the postives will stop. Maybe drinking the souble IPAs I have for awhile has ruined me but the taste for this beer was really not up to par with some other IPAs. Was a little too flowery for me. ANd the mouthfeel really left an aftertaste in your mouth. Not one of my favorite IPAs but i will be willing to give it a second chance."
"Overall, this is one beer that is almost always in my fridge and one that is more universally liked by my friends."
"This is one of my standard IPA's I keep in the fridge, very nice."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date. Had an orange/amber color with good size head and lacing whilst drinking. Smell is definitely of strong hops which had me worried as I generally don't like extreme hop beers and most IPA's. However, this tasted great. Had a nice crisp taste that wasn't overpowered by the hops. Could see this in a semi regular rotation. Highly recommend. (4.0, RR, T,Y)"
"Overall, a very good rendition of the IPA style. Highly recommended."
"Poured a nice, rich gold with a one finger head. Aroma was a bit weaker than I expected; definite hops, but not overwhelming. Substantial hop bittness, but if you are accustomed to double IPAs, it may seem a bit subdued. Mouthfeel is nice and rounded, and has a pleasant malty backbone. Very drinkable due to its balance."
"Mouth is nice and creamy. I really like this brew and am looking forward to the day that Victory is distributed in WA again."
"Poured dark golden amber color, with an off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Citrus, pine and floral hop aroma. Smooth hop taste, with citrus fruits, caramel malts, and lengthy grapefruit. This is a very well balanced intro IPA, that has a tough time competing with the hop monsters from the West."
"I really like the nature-y fresh zest and the sweet and sour combo on the tongue. For me, this is very very drinkable since it has that hop heavy kcik that I crave, but the sour pucker is not at all overwhelming even towards the end of the glass! I could session quite a few of these babies!"
"Hop Devil Ale pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is fairly mild and hoppy, citrusry. The flavor isn't the hoppiest and the balance with the malt is so so. A decent beer, but there are a lot better IPA's out there these days."
"Overall, this is a really good beer. I enjoy drinking a six and will buy it again."
"HopDevil is a beauty of a beer, with a very creamy, very light tan head that has some huge bubbles. It falls pretty quickly, which hurts it a bit, but the sticky lacing helps to make up for it. The beer is a bright golden amber. Smell is strong of sweet caramel and a lovely hop combination. The hops are initially biting and bitter on the tongue, and then the beer gets smooth in a very nice way that is so much fun to repeat. The hops really build in the back of your throat, perhaps slowing consumption a bit. I end up liking this more each time!"
"A very drinkable hop lovers dream. Not overly dry with just the right amount of bitterness."
"Pours a gorgeous burnt orange/copper color with a short head that recedes to a thin layer of foam. Plenty of lacing. Smells floral/citrusy with a substabtial plum-like sweetness. The taste is all hops upfront with a strong dark fruit malty finish. Mouthfeel is tingly. Excellent beer. Almost comes off as a smaller American Barleywine."
"D: Probably one of the best examples of an American IPA out there. An acquired taste but once acquired you will keep coming back for more."
"Single 12oz bottle purchased from Charles Street Liquors in Boston. Bottle two weeks past ""Enjoy By"" date on label. Pours a beautiful dark amber, with slight head that laced well. Light carbonation. Medium aroma of hops. Full, somewhat warming, bitter hoppy taste - but not overly complex, and not as fruity as I prefer in this type of beer. This beer was enjoyed after a 20 minute walk home from the store on a warm night, so perhaps it should have been consumed a few degrees cooler - although I'm generally a fan of cellar-temperature beers. Nice beer, but not one that I will necessarily seek out again any time soon. Would be interested in trying it on tap."
"Overall, not for the faint of heart beer drinkers, but hop heads, will dig this beer. I did."
"Pours a hazy brown/red, thick off white head forms, lots of lacing and good retention, head lasts until the end. Smell is sweet and malty, lots of toffee, but with nice floral/pine hops, good balance. Taste is sweet toffee, some grains, lots of floral hops, little bit of pine, clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Great IPA, superb balance, easy drinking. Thanks for the bottle DrJay/or Dan."
"Had on-tap at the Happy Gnome in St.Paul. It's a deep brown color, with an off-white head that fades. Looks tempting. Nose is all hops. Taste is malty with pine and a strong hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and drinkability is up there. Overall a nice brew."
"This is a very drinkable ale, and due to its balance and bold flavour the alcohol content sneaks by unnoticed. This is not a beer for those faint of hops and probably isnt a great IPA to introduce a hop novice to. If you like hops, however, this is a great beer, and it goes down very easy. Ill be drinking this one again."
"Overall, a very drinkable IPA that is pretty hoppy but still balanced enough that I would drink it regularly, and often, if it was more available here. I would also like to try it when fresher."
"D-This is a fairly drinkable beer. If you enjoy a moderately hopped up brew, than this is worth a try."
"I'll probably take hell for this, but I think HopDevil is certainly one of the more overrated IPAs out there. I've tried it a number of times and I've yet to be blown away by it. Worth a shot, absolutely. Near the top of it's class? Not in my book.."
"This beer is a nice dark amber, and has a captivating aroma. The hops are extremely present in the first smell. The first taste is quite overwhelming, given the elevated IBUs, but subsequent mouthfuls proof to be less intense. Eventually the beer provides a very pleaseant mouthfeel, and extremely satisfying taste. Not for the weak of heart, but a must for any hophead."
"D: Yes, a good beer. I like a more balanced IPA than this one so I would probably not make this beer my first choice. Drinkable but I've had better - this surprises me because of the fine reviews I've read here & elsewhere. Will have at least once more before making a final judgement."
"I decided that tonight was IPA night and what better way to start? This fine American IPA features a cleverly crafted devil made from hops on the bottle. I look forward to finishing the six-pack!"
"Last point - I had this beer at the pub the night of the 10 year anniversary. Nothing like the bottle. I need to get there again to verify my suspicion that this beer is better in the bottle."
"This a very good beer, but you have to love the intense hops. Otherwise you might feel they are overwhelming. Not me I love it!"
"I bring it to my nose. Not picking up too much, just some fresh hops. First eager drink. Wow. suprised to say i did'nt get to much out of this, not very hoppy in my opinion. I don't know what most people think of this, but for my money, this would be an exceptional APA, but comes nowhere near my personal expectations for an IPA. I find the mouthfeel to be very nice, and I do think the drinkability on this beer is mighty high. It's a delicious beer, I just don't think it fits with the style that it is representing."
"D-good but green hop may wear on me, would need to switch to a milder taste like say chewing on a hop."
"This beer poured a dark copper color, very clear and was topped by a fluffy off-white head. A nice lace is left on the side of the glass as the head slowly recedes. The nose has grapefruit, a little spicy pepper, some pine, and light caramel on the finish. Im not sure of the hop bill, but I think I catch some Centennial in the aroma. The taste is more balanced that I expected. I get a dark caramel first followed by grapefruit rind. The spiciness is still there too. Just the slightest heat in the finish. Slick, dry mouth feel, nice drinakbiklity."
"Notes: We brought these out to Planet of the Ales, and I enjoyed the ones I drank while camping there. It's a very solid American IPA, but as the style has grown in popularity, better renditions have been developed."
"Drinkability: good, but on the whole (and it's great to be able to say this!) I think I liked the version I brewed better!"
"Brought this back from my busines travels. I thought my wife would like it, as well. More of a redish appearance than most IPAs. Great hoppy aroma. Taste didn't have that pine resin thing goingon like so many west coast IPAs. A bit of a creamy taste and finish. Kind of a Nugget Nectar thing. Maybe it's the PA water."
"It's a good looking beer, nice deep red-ish color. Aroma is ok, hints at the barroom skankiness I don't enjoy in some beers. Taste is unbalanced with bitter hops, not in a good way. Finish is long and bitter. Mouthfeel is decent but for the awful bitterness that rings there. Drinkability is low, since you can't really drink anything else after this burns up your taste buds."
"D: While not my favorite IPA I've had it's not bad by any bet. It was nice to have but I don't think I would buy this one over and over again."
"would probably limit me to two in one sitting."
"Hoppy Devil Ale has a has a light tan head, which it produces upon command. It also has a medium amber reddish blue hue. The brew has a very green resin/floral scent AND a good malty, perhaps even roasted odor. This decoction actually has a lot more malt and a bit less hops than one might suspect. Placating your taste buds with strong roasted malts, with hints of caramel, approaching treacle, there is also quite a bit of resinous hops to fulfill the need of those who like, well, hoppy beers. This beer is only for those who truly appreciate the joys of strong hops, but it is a well balanced version of high hop holies. Not intended for all dining occasions...I would recommend it specifically with red meat."
"Hop Devil has an interesting dark red, slightly foggy coloration with just a little head. Smelled quite delicious up front (sweet + a little cool IPA edge). Taste = Oh yeah, that is good! Some nice hop flavors in the same league as Stone. Bitter herbs and vegetable tastes with just enough light, sweet citrus. Felt slightly creamy with some bite and carbonation in the mouth. Drinkability: sure! The victory brewers knew just what they were doing when they came up with this one. (I remembered the name of the veggie this and other similar IPAs remind me of: bitter melon. Mmmm)"
" Balanced and mature ale with top notch ingredients and quality craftsmanship. Silky mouthfeel and a refreshing, dry and bitter finish. Outstanding work from Victory. Easily drinkable and a landmark example of the style."
"This is definitely a hoppy beer, but it doesn't kick you in the taste buds like some other IPAs, as I expected. Smells spicy with a hint of citrus...maybe a grapefruit?? It was a good choice on a humid day like today, but I would be more likely to try another IPA."
"D: good session beer. I could put severl of these away over the course of an evening. There's better out there but if this is readily available it's a nice choice."
"D: Good IPA. Not as complex as others on the market but certainly drinkable. Good session beer."
"Pours a nice amber/dark orange color. Looks like a shade of pine resin that has hardened. Full blown hops aroma. Like sniffing a bag of Columbus or Amarillo hop pellets. A faint hint of Grapefruit is the only citrus note. Hops hit the palate and linger like a bad habit. The finish is more intense than the initial bitterness. A good froth while almost chewing and rolling this ale elicits a few malt flavors. I had this for the first time over three years ago but forgot how the hops literally bite back on the finifsh. Killer! love it! I agree with the previous review about only drinking one or two. Cheers!"
"This is a good, but not great offering. There is more malt here than I would normally look for in an IPA. That said, this is a drinkable brew that is well worth a try."
"Overall decent and drinkable, but lacking that citrusy hop flavor that I have come to love."
"Feels thickish, without the carbonation to even out the mouthfeel, but the finish is so surprisingly clean that it's not much of an issue. I could drink more of this beer, but I'll be looking at other IPAs for a while."
"Overall: A complex brew that has a large dose of herbal spicy, citrus pulp hops and an equally big dose of malts. The hops are the real winner here and the malts serve to not allow the hop spiciness to burn a hole in your tongue. If your a hop-head the drinkability is high, if you are not please stay away!"
"A+"
"Mouthfeel is on the heavy side, but it fits. It's creamy, and I would say it has the same mouthfeel as a nice English Ale. Drinkabiliity is outstanding for one, but one's really all you need."
"This is simply a terrifically-hopped beer. You can tell from the smell that its not over done like some AIPA's, but is instead nicely balanced with the malt and grains. The initial taste is similar to a micro-brewed lager, but the hops add a nice kiss to the end. After the first sip the hops are easier to discern, but again do not become overpowering. There is also a hint of spices, especially coliander. The drinkability is also through the roof."
"Nice. I'll return to this one."
"Drink ability is very high I could sit back with several. I love this beer and I usually don't go to wild for this style! Prost MK"
"D - what are you waiting for?, go try it if you havent!"
"Notes: What a tasty, refreshing beer! An IPA a non-hop head could love."
"This is definitely one of my 2-3 favorite IPAs. Drinkable as hell. Hoppiness is the key here, but it is not so overwhelming to taint the taste. Balanced nicely. A classic brew."
"refreshing and light on the palate, makes this one easy to consume and has just enough complex taste to leave on wanting more. glad i took a shot in the dark on this one!"
"Beautiful pour, with a thick 2 finger width tan crown. A light redish orange hue with a good amount of streaming bubbles. Head retention is good and the beer is quite transparent. The aroma has a good dose of flowery hops and a nice balance of caramel malts. The taste is excellent. A solid helping of malty flavor which transitions so smoothly into a crisp hop finish. Great palate of flavors. Mouthfeel is great. Excellent beer, very smooth and not too bitter for an IPA. Great summer beer."
"D- Very Good IPA, hopheads enjoy. Nice flavoring, not hard to drink. Not recommended for persons who haven't spent much time getting a taste for hops, this will scare them away."
"This is a decent IPA, but given that American IPA's are probably my favorite style, I'm a bit picky, and I wouldn't consider this to be a contender for my favorite. Still, it's one of the better brews I've found available in 6-packs, and I will look forward to downing the remaining brews."
"I've been waiting to really sample this beer for a while. In the past, I've either felt like drinking something else, or already had a couple of beers and thought I wouldn't be able to appreciate. I'm glad I took my time, because this beer is very good. I look forward to more of them."
"I've heard great things but only have been able to try a lackluster old bottle, until last weekend at the Wild Horse Cafe in Beverly I had a draft. Nice APA. Hops nose was not as pronounced as the hop flavor which was strong and complex/deep. Slight ashen flavor from the yeast, and the malt was typical for the style. A nice entry in the category and surely drinkable, but not quite blown away as some folks seem to be. Could be fermented cleaner as it had a slight funk to it."
"Transparent, gorgeous amber, one finger head with large bubbles that holds and dissipates after an initially tight and creamy pour. Scant carbonation. Aroma is pure hop resins, and nothing more. Taste is pure hoppiness after the malt makes a minimal showing. Definitely a coppery amber/pale ale backdrop that is good, but this is not my favorite hop profile. Resinous and slightly juicy, no notable spiciness, grassiness, or floral overtones. This is not 60 minute IPA of course, and it's not exactly a hop bomb, but there are plenty of hops. The more you sip, the more the hops seemed to loose intensity, and the malt body and flavor was more detectable. Mouthfeel is medium with a desirable amount of carbonation. Overall, this is not my choice for an IPA, thought it's a solid version, and probably somewhat traditional despite favoring american hops rather than english or more noble hops, I gather."
"I will have this again, though it is not my favorite IPA. I recommend that others try it. A solid IPA offering."
"a nice deep copper color that made my mouth water, as well as the smell which is hard to describe. kind of a little fruity but not much. tasted quite bitter, but with the right amount of hops. every easy to drink, since its so smooth. best IPA that ive had so far."
"This was poured into a pint glass with a deep copper, hazy color. The head was consistant for an IPA. The aroma is floral and citrusy. The taste is bitter up front, in the middle, and in the finish. There are flavors of pine and a slight tarty fruit(?). The body is thick and filling. On a summer day you could enjoy a few of these, but not the entire 6-pack. I would have to say that this is a great American IPA."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA and very unique. I like it, but I'm rather confused by it's flavors, it smells a lot more than it seems to taste."
"In a word, smooth. After trying a few of their beers I have extreme respect for Victory."
"Ratings updated to 4.5 / 3.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 4.5"
"I could drink quite a few of these bad boys in an evening. This is one tasty little devil."
"This one is great....pours up nice with an off white head. The color is a hazy amber tranlucent to the light a nice appearing beer. The smell is effervecent very nice..sweet roasted malts, smokey carmel and piney hops very potent and an example of what I like to smell in a beer. The taste is quite nice as well the toasty sweet carmels are present up front and then yield to more grassy notes in the middle, a perfectly balanced hop impression finishes the beer off. Damn fine and oh so perfectly quaffable. If I could get sixers of this I would keep a case in the beer fridge standard. The mouthfeel is good possibly a bit water for the beers flavor. Amazingly drinkable....get this in mass quantities if you can."
"Edit...taste had to be a 5!"
"So far i'm 0/3 with Victory."
"The appearance was quite coppery for an IPA, average off white head. The smell is of a hop bomb, a little sweet, but definitely an IPA by scent. The taste is obviously a hop bomb, but for an IPA, there is a slightly more roasted of a flavor to the malt witch balances and sweetens the beer nicely. A lot of grapefruit and citrusy tones. I am a hop head, and I have had hoppier beers, I would put this at about a 7 or 7.5 on the hop scale. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good, but nothing stood out. I could definitely sit and have more than a couple of these."
"I believe this falls under the category of hop-bomb. This was really good for a BBQ. If you really like hops, then this is a beer for you. I with I could get these locally."
"This is a good beer."
"I would love to get my hands on this at the brewery itself to find out the differences that were created as it went through being distributed."
"This one is really hoppy, no doubt. Looks beautifully outta the bottle, big lacing down the glass. Nice micro smell! Packs a wholloping hit on the bitter side after going down. Some malt, more hops. Beautiful copper coloring, also. It is also affordable. A delight of a beer!"
"Drinkability- You gotta love hops to take on this one. If you do then you're in for a major treat."
"Da solid IPA that is well worth seeking out!"
"This was a beer that I've heard alot about and my expectations were satisfied by the Devil. The smell is complex with lots of fruit going on. Very nice. The taste is strong and, like the smell, complex as hell. Its almost overpowering there is so much going on. Its tasty, but almost spicy. Very interesting. It feels nice in the mouth, almost think and dances on the tounge. The drinkablity of this beer is suspect. For me it bites a little too much to be an everyday beer. One, maybe two and move on to something cheaper. Bottom line- Tasty and spicy. Very interesting beer."
"D - A nice balance. I really enjoyed this one. Kudos to the guys at Victory for this one."
"If this is the Devil, consider me Damned, and Damned proud of it!"
"I think this is a very drinkable beer."
"Very good IPA, didn't use to be a fan, but its because of beers like this that I am starting to really enjoy IPA's."
"Good job. Good brew"
"This is an solid, very enjoyable beer all around. One of the best American IPAs I've had, and a great value too."
"Drinkability is quite high - very smooth beer. Worthy of being a top 10 IPA? Not sure. However, it is very well done and can hold its own against almost any IPA Ive tried so far."
"This is definitely one of my new favorites. If you're into IPAs, you damn well better love this beer."
"Great beer! Full of flavor and memorable."
"I usually drink this straight from the bottle, but last night poured one into a glass. The color was darker orange than I expected. Decent head too. Smells and tastes hoppy but without an overly bitter after-taste. It reminds me most of Stone IPA. Nicely balanced IPA."
"So this is one of the better IPA's that I have tried...the color was beautiful...higher carbonation than what I have come to expect from the style...lots of flavor. I'll definitely try it again...and hopefully next time it will be on-tap somewhere."
"This is a very nice IPA and very well balanced. Definitely in the top tier for the style."
"It produced superb, thick rings of lace and was a rich amber colour, but a little on the murky side. The grapefruit aroma was very pronounced and a little sharp compared to what I remember from the bottled version. The same grapefruit character was in the flavour as well, along with a very solid, caramel, malty backbone to balance the ample bitterness. It felt very full in the mouth as well - I was a little surprised since many beers I've tried on cask seem a little thinned out without the extra carbonation. Overall, quite excellent! I'm sure the guys back in Toronto will be jealous."
"Pours a medium amber with a very frothy tan head. Fairly clear. First wiff is all hops. Flavor is decidedly balanced on the hop end of the spectrum, but there is enough hop backbone to keep it from being too hoppy. Medium bodied. Hop flavor dominates. Did I say that already? Definately an American IPA. If you are a hop head you'll like this one. Burrrpppp, dang those hops don't stop!"
"Pours a thick hazy brown beer with a nice frothy head. Smells of ripe hops and yeast with a touch citric ambiance. The beer was rather cold for cask condition but didn't ruin the full body and hoppy malt flavour this beer provides. This on cask is so smooth and delicious I went back for seconds. As the beers warmed the hops stood out and gave me a true essence of this beer and I truly enjoyed, Cheers to Victory!!"
"Poured a medium copper tone. A little hazy with a thin off white cap. The cap didn't stay around too long either. The aroma was very noticable caramel and citrus. A little hops in the nose. Flavor was nice smooth caramel and grapefruit. A little spice maybe clove or anise. I felt it had a very good blend that went down smooth. The hops hung for a few seconds, but helped mellow the sweetness very nicely. Overall a good basic hopped up beer. Very good taste and goes down smooth. Nothing really extraordinary, but good. Will def. have again!"
"overall it's a good beer and worth a try."
"Pours a fiery amber with a few fingers of fluffy white head. Nose is wonderfully hoppy with notes of juicey citrus and pine. Taste hits you with an initial citrusy hop bitterness but is quickly rounded out by a healthy sweet caramel malt backbone. Felt like DFH 90 Minute's little brother. Considerably more drinkable though. A great sessionable hop bomb with plenty of character. SO glad Victory is here in WI."
"An old favorite. A wonderful (and missed) east coast IPA."
"d: definitely a keeper. liked this one from beginning to end and next time will get a sixer."
"D - Not a bad IPA but I've had much better."
"This poured an awesome orange gold color with a good amount of carbonation and a decent white head that had decent retention. The aroma is most prominetly pine hops! It is also very citric. Awesome taste, obviously the hop attack is there but there is a nice maltiness there too. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but tingly to the tounge. Kinda drying also. This is really is quite drinkable. A very simple but awesome brew."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant, if not a little thin. Heavy carbonation. Drinkability is very high."
"Yeah, I could drink this all night. Complex enough to be a beer snob and straightforward enough for a solid session beer."
"Cheers."
"Incredibly easy to drink and even easier to enjoy. I'd point this beer out as the standard example of the new American IPA. Well-hopped and drinkable every day."
"Drinkability : Goes down very easy, and very good, could go for several more in one sitting. A tasty ale somewhat slanted to hops at the malt's expense, which I think is just what you might have wanted if you find yourself drinking this often - I know I do. However I think that this is balanced enough and tame enough to enlighten the non-hop disciple."
"Pours copper, with a tan, foamy head.and nice lacing. Smell is of hops,pine,and citrus, with a sweet edge. Body is medium,with some carbonation. Taste has a bitter edge,that I thought would be better balanced. The sweetness in the smell was not comming through for me. It's stright bitter from start to finish. Don't get me wrong,this is not a bad beer, but I liked Hazed and Infused much better."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful with a nice body and solid carbonation. Goes down all too easy, this is a great session IPA for sure and a great six pack choice for heading out to a party. I'm a little upset that I overlooked the HopDevil for so long. Another brew from Victory that's not to be missed."
"Not an ale with a lot of levels, but it does not need any. The one is fine on its own."
"While this beer, when on cask is quite possibly my favorite beer ever, it's missing a little something in the bottle. No real surprise. In bottle it still is one of the staples in my fridge. Still a beautiful beer, still that wonderful citrusy hops aroma backed by solid malts and some pine, and the taste is nicely well-rounded and balanced. But it's not the same as the hand-pulled version that wows me."
"drinkability - i couldnt finish any of the bottles i tried. arrogant bastard is bitter, intense hoppy but tastes quality, this one to me is like a 'mcdonalds IPA' if they were to make one. ive read good things about Victory, hopefully some of their other offerings are better. throw me a miller high life any day over this one."
"Thanks for the experience Beerninja. This is one freakin' tastey beer."
"Drink well."
"This brew seems unbalanced, somewhat chaotic. Haphazard malt balance even for an IPA. Alcohol astringency is more evident than hop bitterness. I guess I'm in the minority, but there are plenty of other more interesting offerings for this style."
"D: As long as you like American hops, this is very drinkable. The alcohol content will catch up to you though!"
"I'm usually more into IPAs that are well balanced between malt and hops... HopDevil isn't too balanced, but the hop character in the beer is so pleasing that I'll make an exception. This beer pours a very bright amber with a decent, foamy head that dissipates only after a while. The nose is big and fruity with hops, and they have an acidic bite to them that packs a real wallop. Underneath the hops is a slight bready malt aroma. The palate is extremely bitter, with the hops assaulting the tongue immediately. The hops flavors are quite bitter but not acridly so. There's very little malt balance to this beer, but the hop flavors are good enough to compensate. The mouthfeel is quite smooth in spite of the hop burst. I'm really impressed. Victory succeeds again."
"One will be enough for me. I think I'd like this better if there was just a little more sugar to balance the hops."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is one of my all-time favoite beers. I will be forever indebted to Victory for providing me with this one. It is certainly very hoppy, but the balance of the different hops in it are what makes it so special. It is citrusy but not completely over the top. There is enough of a malt backbone to make it extremely drinkable."
"D - very tasty beverage, and something I would never turn down. Just disappointed in the unbalanced aspect of this brew."
"Amber/Brownish tan Color light floral aroma. Little if any head no real lacing of the glass. Dissapointed with these characteristics but it does have a nice sharp initial taste followed by a nice smooth hoppy finish. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. It was a rather lighter filtered IPA. It does pack a punch at 6.7%abv. I had tried this beer a few years back and it tasted less hoppy than I remember it. I am not that impressed with this beer. I wll ha ve to make it a point to try some of the other Victory brewery beers. I have heard good things about them. Overall it is a decent IPA enjoyable and drinkable but not my favorite."
"A wonderful and unique IPA, very easy to drink"
"O - GREAT example of what an IPA should be. I'd recommend to anyone who is a fan of the style."
"Overall- my favorite beer of the night at the 10 year anniversary. Awesome beer out of the cask!"
"I still like this beer as much as I did the first time I had it - maybe more. Victory, in typical fashion, did a great job with this one."
"The last time I drank this I was going to review but noticed the date was a little past. I held off until this one, but Ive got to say they did not taste much different. A good beer. It seems to lean into the American Amber Ale category at times."
"-UF"
"A fine brew. I'd like to see it come out more even on the tongue. The tangy aftertaste - all over the sides and back of the mouth - could probably be cut a bit with (gasp) a bit more sweetness to it."
"Dark Copper in color. Good smells of hops that prepare the palate for on coming and disticnt flavor of hops. Thick hops taste. Dry in taste. An aftertaste of hops that stayed with me. Not as drinkable as most but over all a decent beer that reflects the style."
"Overall: For a local IPA, or any kind of IPA, you can't beat this one."
"Dark color... simliar to watered down honey. It's a light brown with hints of yellow. Nice head rises from the liquid after the pour. Loads of lacing down the glass. Plenty of hops on the nose that are very citrusy. Hint of grainy malt. There's something else that's sweet. Perhaps it's just the malt. Hops steal the show from the very beginning of the taste. They are very spicy and a tad fruity. There's really not enough malt flavor to mention. I don't give a damn though because this beer is tasty enough without perfect balance! Creamy mouthfeel with absolute bitterness in the finish. Immediately after swallowing the hops are easy and not too bad but you wait five seconds and they attack. Wow. This is a great beer. Victory has brought me so much hoppy delight lately. I feel like I should give them something in return."
"Here we go...Victory Hop Devil...poured into a Newbury Comics pint glass a nice reddish amber color and a small white head that stayed murky from the top through the end. Smell was very citrusy, with loads of grapefruit flavors as well as some grassy earth tones here and there as well. You could also smell a nice spicy aroma from the hops that lent itself well to the overall presence of this beer. Taste was excellent...hop presence was exceptionally executed with prickly spices and earth flavors gliding in and around the palate. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, any lighter or heavier and i think they would have overdone it a bit. This beer will certainly challenge the palate, but I would not call this a difficult beer to drink. Pair this one up with some mildly spicy chicken wings and taste how the hops compliment the flavor."
"Typical looking hazy orange ale with a better than average white head. Strong toasty gin aromas. Taste is junipered with healthy dollops of grapefruit and spice. Bready, chewy, earth and citrus. Lots of hops and therefore well serving of its title. So well balanced. Very drinkable."
"Rich dark amber color and slighty hazy. Thick sticky head with good retention. The aroma is very hoppy. A definite piney hop bitterness. A small amount a grains try to pull through the hops. The flavor is pretty much like it smells. Strong floral and pine like hops dominate. Just enough malt to balance the ale. Dry hoppy finish. HopDevil is a hop lovers dream! Be careful though, 6.7 % acl by volume will catch up to you quick."
"Reddish/orange color, not very clear, the head was small and dissipated fairly quickly. The smell is of nice strong hops, perhaps a bit tangy. The flavor of robust hoppiness dominates, but I would say its not overdone. The malt carries a nice sweetness to balance things out, and the alcohol stays well hidden. Finish has a slight dryness. Mouthfeel is nice, medium thick, and finishes rich and bubbly. This one went down easy, and sadly its the only one I have. I bought it from the vintage cellar online as Victory beers are nowhere to be found in Arizona. I can't wait to have this again..."
"Go Victory!!"
"It's my opinion that a hopped up American beer should attack all five senses (ok 4, and in a good way) this one stands it's ground, and one time I considered it my favorite. It will remain the beer I look for in my local watering hole when only sub-par standards are around."
"Definitely worth trying for yourself, it's a good beer and others seem to dig the shit outta this."
"D: Overall this is an excellent IPA, one of the better ones I've had in quite some time."
"M & D: Mouthfeel on this beer is very very good. Dry and bitter finish is very inviting and welcomed. Drinkability on this offering from Victory is very high. The 6.7% abv is noticeable as it warms your belly. Great beer any time of the year. Victory has done it again--this and the hop wallop are two of the better IPAs I've had."
"Drinkability was exceptional. I could drink this forever. The best IPA I've tasted to date. My only regret is they would not sell a growler of this at Victory. I highly recommend this if you can get to the brewery."
"Fresh, clean mouthfeel with abundant hop aftertaste, makes this moderately strong brew very drinkable, think I'll have another....cheers."
"I can't help but feel I've missed something in the taste department. I have another bottle that I'll use as a comparison later and edit this if necessary, but there's just nothing there. Really disappointing. I really like the mouthfeel. It's surprising for an IPA, but is that enough to keep drinking these? I doubt it."
"On tap cask conditioned at the Drafting Room in Springhouse. The HopDevil pours a nice copper color with a nice thick off-white head. The aroma is of a nice balance between the intense hop flavor and the malty sweetness with a bit of citrus. The taste is an enjoyable balance of the hoppy, piney bitterness and the sweet and fruit tones. A very nice beer and extra special on cask."
"the mouthfeel is a little lite for an ipa."
"One bitter beer, not much for balance on this one. Taste is enjoyable, spicy, maybe aging could smooth it out. I would not have guessed as high as 6.7%."
"Suffice to say that I cannot adequately describe this beer. I love Brooklyn East India Pale Ale, Southern Tier IPA, Redhook IPA, Snake Dog IPA, and Lake Placid Frostbite, but this tops them all in my opinion. Not one to cellar (that's its elder brother Hop Wallop) but one to drink on tap and buy in bottles."
"This beer pours an attractive red, garnet color with a one inch head that hangs around. The smell was very aromatic of fresh hops and hop flowers and pine. Taste was wonderful and complex. Hops, citrus fruits and malt are all dancing on my tongue making for a truly enjoyable drinking experience. This is one of the best American IPA's available and I'm glad I can get this now in NC. Recommended."
"Very very pretty ruby rusty red color. Smell is interesting- sweetly hoppy, almost overly sweet. Lightly fruity, too. Hints of earthy hops come to play as well. Taste is interesting as well- earthy and bitter hops at the forefront, immediately followed by an almost intense malty breadyness. Hints of sweetness hit the palate at odd times, but otherwise it's a tasty thing. Mouthfeel is pretty nice as well. Frothy and bubbly, chewy, smooth. A solid IPA."
"After reading a few reviews, I was probably expecting too much. This is a good but not exceptional IPA. It pours a cloudy copper color with a small off -white head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is exceptional, nice and rich hops/citrus aroma. The taste is good but not great. Good hops taste, good bitterness and balanced flavor. What it doesn't have is the ""wow"" factor I experienced with my first Hop Otten, SN Pale Ale or SN Celebration Ale. This is still a very drinkable ale. There are just a few out there that I prefer more."
"great lacing from the hop oils. reddish brown color"
"Drinkability: This is a good effort for a IPA. This mayeven be a good introduction to the style. I will introduce my father in law to this one."
"It's been a while since I had this because I remembered there being more hop flavor. Mostly I get a strong flavor of toasted malt, followed by a fruity cherry flavor that finally gives way to the hops at the end. The hops stay on your palate for a long time after you take a sip. I don't like the flavor of the hops in this beer as much as some of my favorite IPAs (Southern Tier, Cascazilla, etc.). Good beer though."
"I would like to try this again when I am 100% sure of its freshness. It was good nonetheless, but seems like it might have lost its edge."
"Taste? Smell? Hops baby! Just know what you are getting into!"
"Amber in color. A bit hazy. Head was minimal, but I did pour it way too gently into my glass. Aroma is quite wonderful - sweet, fruity with a nice hop bite. Maybe a bit too sweet for an IPA, but who cares. I like it. At first taste - nice dry, hoppy bite. Fruity sweetness so strong in aroma takes the back seat. Medium body. Very enjoyable high-quality brew. Bonus points: cool name and label."
"In closing, I am not sure this beer is really an IPA. It seems a little too sweet and darker than most IPAs I have had. Not sure it is an APA either. If it weighed in over 7%, I think it would fit right in a Strong Ale category."
"This beer came a glowing clear amber with orange highlights and a small off white head. Smelled of smoky caramel and dry pineapple hops. Tasted of a good blend of slight oats and caramel with a huge hop kicker of juniper, a bit of prunes and an awesome fruity bitterness. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a light tingly carbonation."
"Pours a slightly hazed orange amber hue. Two finger head slowly reduces to a very dense and creamy cap that will remain throughout. Scarce specs of lacing. Cascade and Chinook hops in the nose, citrus and pine scent, and some backgroung crystal malts give it a well-rounded aroma. Begins with a sweet caramel taste, followed by a delicious orange rind and pine sap bitterness. The malt character is mild, but appropriate and balanced for the style. Medium in body with fine carbonation that helps release hop oils from the tounge. Dry aftertaste, with a herbal hop tea flavor. Finish is similiar; timidly abrasive, but friendly enough for a comfortable drinkability."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (with best by date, nice!) into my favorite drinking goblet. Hazy dark copper color with about a half inch of foam on the top of the glass. Nice, big piney hop aroma with some hints of vanilla, maybe? What, hops not overpowering the malt?! What wonderful beer alchemy in my mouth. Hops up front, sweet malt in the middle, and nice bitter hops on my smacking lips. A standard house beer of mine."
"This is a must have for hop-heads. It is a good beer. I am not particularly fond of overly hopped beers, but this one is turning me to the dark side. The label is awesome by the way. I am happy to report that this beer is not actually made with bits of real devil (they use imitation devil and devil extracts)."
"flavor is all hops as well, floral and pine again but with a touch of hop spiciness as well. absolutely no attempt at balance or subtlety with this one. thin mouthfeel with a very bitter afteraste. obviously can't rate the drinkability too high."
"D- This beer is about hop flavor. There is not a lot of bitterness and the hops have a fruity flavor that is unusual. Smooth hoppy beer."
"Smooth and very drinkable...I'll be picking up a few more of these before they're all gone!"
"another good example of the style, just didnt seem to blow me away as some others have."
"Easily the most incredibly drinkable and most balanced IPA I've had. Perfect for cold sipping nights or warm summer afternoons."
"Pours orange- ish with a hazy hue and mild white head. Smell is of sweet fruits, especially grapefruit and flowers. Hits you with a bit of bitterness, alright- definitely a little on the coarse side, but not too much. I must have a slightly older body, the general hop flavor is less pronounced than the bitterness; it's all bitter citrus peel here. A little malt underneath to balance things out; a bit of toast grain flavor as well. Feels nice in the mouth- not too thick or thin. Easy enough to drink, but not sure I'd crave another. Pretty darn good for the style."
"Pours a deep cloudy brownish amber with a nice big white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Smell is piney and also a little nutty. The hops bitterness takes over the taste but it isn't the typical citrus/pine hops. Definately more spicey and nutty than what i would expect from an ipa. The bitterness sticks with you but not a good way. I can see how this would appeal to some but not what I look for in an ipa at all. One of the few dissapointments I've had from Victory."
"Comparison time: This beer is less light, floral and fruity than Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA and less ""hearty"" than Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. This seems to be a spicier take on this style. My pick of these three would be DFH 60 Minute. I like my beers a bit more subtle than this one."
"The color is dark copper with lots of carbonation. The large, thick head is off-white. Aroma is of a citrussy hop on top of sweet malt. As for the taste, piney hops jump out first but are soon taken over by a distinct pineapple flavor. Bitterness is very strong. An underly sweetness mixes in nicely. The overall IPA flavor here is a little different than most that I've sampled, the bitterness is a bit intrusive, still I really enjoyed HopDevil, but its not my favorite. This is something I'll pick up again, just to see if I can find out what the fuss about."
"Drinkability is near perfect. It's a very intense flavored beer, which usually is not a great thing for drinkability, but this doesn't seem to be the case here. The ABV is near perfect in my opinion at 6.7%."
"Will definitely try this again."
"Another good brew from Victory. Pours out to a medium amber color with a short lived head. Lace is present in organized rings. Nice. Aroma is (gasp!) very hoppy, with some minor hints of malt and grain. Taste is very hoppy, yet not overpowering to the point that you want to cringe. Flavors of hops, sweet floral notes, mild malts and dry grain go rather well over the palate. Mouthfeel is slightly oil. I like that with the hoppy beers. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd like this every once in awhile when I want to get my ""hop"" on. Recommended."
"This beer has a medium body and goes down pretty smooth. The carbonation seems high at first when it is felt on the front of the tongue, but as it sits in the mouth longer and when swallowed the perceptable level of carbonation considerably drops. This beer is good and I would buy it agian but I prefer Stone and SNCA when it comes to IPAs."
"Head amber with a white cap that laces the whole glass. The smell is of strong citrus, spicy, fruity, and bitter hops all well backed up by the malt. The taste is very powerful an intense bitter flooding out to tasty bready malt laced with powerful pine and citrus hops that leave a twang of sweetness. Very well body and damn drinkable for such a powerful beer."
"---"
"Drinkability: just fine. Low score mostly related to my own tendency to stop after 1 extremely hoppy beer. It's a good one, though."
"Draft Pours brown like ice tea with a good head. Aroma is of grapefruit and orange. Flavor is a good mix of hops and malts. A nice after taste. A very good beer. This is a strong beer. Don't have to many or you might mot be able to get up. I am local to Victory and love there stuff. This is my favorite."
"This beer pours a reddish amber color with a slight fluffy head that does not last long. Smells of spicy and powerful citrus hops. This beer really hits the nostrils and the senses. Taste is quite strong in the hop department. Very spicy beer that finishes a little dry. Malts are complex and add a good balance too this beer. It is hoppy but still very drinkable. The texture is smooth and full bodied. Very tasty beer and a great IPA."
"Overall a great beer, but not one i could drink all night or everyday, but thats just me. But it is quite a treat and a great one to change things up when you want to get a little festive."
"This is one of my favorite beers regardless of style. I simply can't get enough of HopDevil."
"ok well i will be the first to tell you im not a big ipa fan but i pulled this at mystery beer so i drank it at mystery beer. it started off ok it looked like a good beer it smelled like a ok beer and then all hell broke loose it taste verry verry hoppy not my style at all more hoppy then any other ipa ive had which ads to the mouth feel of a thousand razorblades slicing my tonge i think i would rather drink corona than this cheap gypsy swill again"
"The taste what what you would expect from an IPA, somewhat malty and sweet, with extreme hoppiness. It had a good mouthfeel, and finished very sweet and crisp, almost refreshing. I am a fan of this beer but I wouldn't say it was one of the best IPA styles I've ever had."
"Probably one of the better American IPAs I have had lately...only a little under hopped. It is a copper colored beer with a light colored long standing head. The beer smells awesome. It has a great sweet, piney, western hop smell to it. However, when I taste into the beer it is just not as strong a hop. The malts kick up on it. It brings a lot of balance to the beer, it is very tasty and sweet, but thats not really what I want in an IPA. Hops...thats what I want. The mouthfeel is good. Light to medium and clean. A great beer to sit around drinking. Just not exactly what I would expect from something called ""hopdevil""."
"Now that a local bar(The Happy Gnome)serves Victory Hop Devil on draft, I finally get a chance to review this quintessential American IPA. The color is a pleasing dark amber. The head disappears quickly, but there is ample lacing on the glass. The fact that I was in a smoke-filled bar probably accounts for the minimal smell of this beer. The taste on the other hand is instantly memorable. There is an intense hop burst up front, combined with a citrussy piney flavor, which is balanced by a notable malt undertone. THIS is what an IPA should taste like! The mouthfeel is rich, but refreshing. This is an amazing beer."
"Pours burnt orange with a semi-hazy body. The head never came on strong and was left to a thin film. Aroma was very resinous and filled with pine-like hoppiness. Not as full as I was hoping for. The taste came on very floral and finished with a rough hop bitterness. The hops are very concentrated in the center of the mouth and finish through decently. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. The hops give way to a small amount of maltiness that comes through as it warms up. I have had much better and much worse IPAs. This is a great example of the style, but not world class to me. I feel as though there could be more complexity to this one."
"D - I love this IPA, I could sit a drink a six pack while working around the house or cooking a batch of chili as I am right now. The hops are there but not overwhelmingly. I can't wait for my chili to be done to pair the two."
"Notes: This was my first IPA shortly before I discovered BA and it really got me going into the craft beer movement. Def a good one both for experienced IPA drinkers who dont want the complete hop assault of a DIPA, as well as those new to the style. Excellent work by Victory, as always."
"This is my second beer from the Victory Brewing Company and I am very impressed. I think that this is a solid IPA and I will definitely enjoy it in the future."
"A great beer. If you like hops and well balanced but complex IPA's, pick this up!"
"The beer is very drinkable but you definitely have to be a hophead to handle more than a few."
"mouthfeel probably couldn't be better. very pleasant. typical nice balanced IPA. not too heavy not too light. good balance like i said. a great brew."
"Pours a golden/amber color, nice carbonation, small thin head, some nice lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malt, citrus, and caramel. The taste is very hoppy with a little bit of a malt taste, has a very nice bite at the end. Medium body. This is a very nice IPA from Victory, do they make anything bad, lol. Very drinkable at the ABV, very hoppy, highly recommended."
"Nice deep amber color, good clarity, decent head. Very spicy,pungent hop aroma emanates from my warming pint glass of Hop Devil. Obviously this is a highly hopped IPA. Malt flavors are light and the beer is quite dry. Hops dominate, very spicy and herbal. Mild pine flavors as well. Best part of this beer is the deep and complex hop aroma. However, this is nothing to write home about. Overall an average IPA that happens to be highly hopped. Victory is a great brewery and I think their pils is the best in the world. There is no way this beer should be rated higher than the pils. Anyone can make a decent and hoppy IPA. Definately worth a try for the complex hop aroma and flavor, but also try the pils."
"A mild copper color with a nice thick head that stays for quite a while. I detected aromas of hops, grass, citrus, and caramel; very appealing. The taste is suprisingly smooth and well balanced with a significant sugar flavor for this style. The alcohol is well concealed and hops seem to stay strong until the very last sip. The only thing I had a problem with was the aftertaste; a bit too bready and potent. An excellent beer with loads of character and flavor. Another great beer from Victory! Excellent drinkabilty"
"The mouthfeel is probably a little over medium-bodied, but not heavy. Quite a drinkable beer as well. I really wish I had more than just one."
"A nice citrus grapefruit graces your tongue with some notes of grain and biscuit, possibly malt... a decent balance but leaning a bit more to the malts than i normally desire, but doesnt detradct from it. I liked this IPA and it's a good brew which i reccommend. Good body and carbonation."
"O. Very drinkable, could knock back a couple of these in a session."
"Opinion: Well, I am not the biggest hophead, so I had ill conceived expectations of this beer. I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of hops here, but it is more for show than flavor. There is a whole lot of late additions, at the end of the boil...and just enough early in the boil to make this a very drinkable beer. I am not big on hops, but I would drink this beer again for sure!"
"Hazy copper-amber with an offwhite head, decent attenuation. Adequate lacing all the way down the glass. Nose is bergamot spiciness, spruce, and orange pith. On the tongue its all peppery grapefruit rind and biscuity malt. Bitter pineyness. Some slight toffee in there, too. Really delicious. Nice, medium body and overall juicy (thickish) mouthfeel. Excellent IPA. Id drink it regularly if I could."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is well hidden underneath the hoppyness. A very good IPA for a guy that typically does not like them."
"D-Just fine. Can't really taste the high octane in this one at all. Goes down smooth, even if it is 4 months too old! Very good balanced flavor, not so assaulting you can keep drinking it. Would try again for sure, hopefully a fresh one next time."
"Super drinkable for a very strong IPA. This an excellent beer with only one fault, the 6.7% ABV makes this a bit strong for drinking one after another. Great beer that I can recommend."
"Less in-your-face than I remember...still very aromatic and palatable. Doesn't punish your tastebuds with bitterness, instead it charms them with a great savory hoppy flavor. Very distinct...good stuff."
"Cheers!"
"Nice hazel/amber colored brew. I pick up some grassy hops in the nose along with sweets. Big citrus hops flavor, like chewing on a grapefruit rind. Very full mouthfeel that sticks to the palate for awhile. Rich hoppy beer with excellent drinkability."
"This beer is the color of a Red Oak leaf in October. It has a smell that is one of the best of any beers I've had. There is no question this bad boy is bitter. The hops have started Armageddon on my tongue. WOW!! This is my first beer from Victory and if this is any indication I can't wait to see what they can do for a stout. ( SKS ) Could I drink more than one. Oh yeah. Will I tonight? Nope, I'm out. 6% Cap went to Hell via Hop Devil!!!"
"Three pints from cask at Zeno's. Wow. The cask really does wonders to this stuff. There is a glorious thick off-white head that persists forever. Below the everlasting head, this beer is a fantastic opaque dark amber color. Smell is all hops- spicy and citrusy and pretty much the same as the stuff from a bottle. Tastes fantastic. Hops hit hard and persist throughout. The difference is that it just tastes a bit more complex and untamed than normal hopdevil. I must say that what really stikes me about this beer more than anything else is the mouthfeel- heavy and creamy and just fantastic. Perhaps the best mouthfeel of any beer I've tried. Pretty drinkable- addictive really, as the fact that I had three pints demonstrates. Wonderful stuff."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable on a hot day. This beer would hold up well against some spicy food and sweating-hot weather."
"I will be writing nothing that has not been written about HopDevil Ale since over 600 reviews have already been written about it (which looks like it's the second more reviewed ever). For only 6.7% ABV, this one packs a mighty punch which I truly enjoyed over a big ND win versus Tennessee yesterday. Paid only $7.50 a six pack, which was the first time I've seen it in our post-Pop the Cap grocery store. This one is not for everyone; I would not have enjoyed this one bit two years ago. Much better than the Redhook IPA I had a bit later that evening."
"I ususally like highly hopped beers but this one is just too one-dimensional, i guess most others disagree but i can't understand why this is so highly rated."
"It's taste matches its smell, with a spicey element and a nice balanced malt character. The aftertaste leaves you with that spice and a fine alcohol warming. I would suggest that this beer is a hoppier IPA than some but is done tastefully and very well. Really a fine tasting beer. It has become a regular in my fridge and I highly recommend it."
"Came to the table with a minimal soapy head over clear deep amber liquid. Nose is all biscuity malt and flowery hops. The wonderfully smooth mouthfeel sets the stage for a mingling of fresh hops and sweet malt on the palate. The finish is long with a brief fruity flourish and long fading hoppiness."
"Real good IPA, a massage on the senses."
"I picked this one up on tap at Old Chicago to go with my burger. While I could have paired my beer with my food a little better. I found this to a most enjoyanle hoppy beer. It pours a dark hazy copper color with a nice rocky retentive head. It smells of fregrant hops and some hints of spice. The taste is the best as its tastes overly hoppy. Very bold and tasty hops with enough malt to make it go down smooth. I noticed fragrant, earthy, herbal hops. I loved this beer and have since ordered many more pints."
"A very good IPA. Nice copper coloured body, and an intense citrus hop aroma and flavor with minor notes of black pepper and pine. Loads of smooth bitterness too. With all of that good stuff being said, it lacks a bit of subtlety and could use a bit more malty flavor to balance out the hops. Still, this is a superb beer."
"pours a deep rusty amber with a fair head and wisps of lace surrounding the glass. hold this to the light and it appears to be a deep amber/orange color. looks like a fairly typical IPA. smells of good green hops and hints of pineapple. wow, that smells quite good! luckily this has taste to match! the hops are definately ""there"" but not overpowering in the least bit. it's blended quite nicely with malts to add a nice spicy yet sweet quality to it. on top of that this is possiblly the smoothest, creamist IPA i've ever had! this is definately a great beer for a spring or autumn day, and would even do well in the middle of summer. not so sure how great it would be in the freezing cold of winter, but that spiciness definately has a warming quality to it. alex likes it, i like it...we all like it! two thumbs up!"
"drinkability: very drinkable for an IPA"
"Hazy orange-copper in appearance with a thick, rocky, off-white head. The head has some serious peaks and valleys before gradually dissipating. It leaves some very dense lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very hoppy. Citrus fruits dominate, including orange and grapefruit. There seems to be a very nice malt presence backing everything up. The taste is very nice. Citrus juiciness, oranges and grapefruits. A beautiful malt base appears in the middle and softens everything. It finishes with a gentle hop bitternesss. This is a truly great tasting IPA. There is a ton of hoppiness in it, yet it never falls into the common IPA trap of becoming too harsh. I guess the malt base is sturdy enough to support the hoppiness while keeping it gentle. Very drinkable. I would love the chance to try this on cask, it seems tailor made for it. Also of note is the freshness date on the bottle keeping you from buying old stock. So simple, but such a useful tool."
"A very nice amber\orange color when first poured. A two finger head quickly dissapates to one with nice lacing down the glass with some nice carbonation. At first a very nice and strong hoppy,bitter, grapefruit aroma. The taste in the beginning is not overly hoppy or bitter because of the pleasing balance with the malt however you get a nice hop punch in the aftertaste. A medium bodied mouthfeel that's very crisp and leaves the taste in your mouth for a while. This is a well rounded IPA that I can definatley sit down and drink for a while."
"Clear amber, not much head or lacing. Surprisingly malty, fruity nose, with sharp, peppery hops around the edge. Taste is similar, a large malty backbone with hops that rush in quickly to fill the void. HopDevil distinguishes itself from other IPAs with a very pleasant toasty finish. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. A big IPA, but quite drinkable and my favorite of the style, so far."
"from the bottle. poured a nice amber to copper with a light tan head. aroma, nice hops, grapefruit, honey, caramel, spicy. flavor a little on the light side compared to the aroma, dry , bitter , some hops would have liked the hops to be a little more robust, had a hard tine finding the malt and caramel. but over all a very drinkable beer."
"I wouldn't drink more than one or two of these in a session, especially if a smoother IPA was available. Definitely a good beer, but not amazingly drinkable."
"6.7%? You're kidding me. A nicely balanced drink that goes easy and tastes great. Consider for a hophead session."
"Pours a deep amber with a decent beige head that reduces to a sturdy collar, laces well. Smells of citrus and caramel malts. First there's a light burst of citrus hops then the caramel maltiness makes itself known, while the hops kick back in for citrus and pithy bitterness(though the malty sweetness continues to last) into the finish. There's also a strong earthy hop character thrown in for good measure. Fairly well balanced as the malts make a strong showing, and the bitterness never overwhelms. It's good, but i prefer some other IPA's as far as flavor goes. This boasts a good medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but not my favorite."
"Victory's Prima Pils is another story!"
"Deep amber color, slightly hazy, with thick rocky off-white head, 2 fingers. Oily and exuberant flowery hops in the nose, along with some malt struggling against the big hops. Tastes immediatly bitter, with aggressive and oily, juicy hops, mostly flowery. Some sweetness as you drink on into it. Dry finish. Full body, smooth and slick mouthfeel, with a bite from the hops in the middle. Drinkable? Oh, yes. Gulpable."
"I could drink a lot of this beer, and did so last summer. Another brilliant brew from Victory... these guys can simply do no wrong."
"Drinkability -- Very nice drinkability. I could probably get myself into a little trouble with this one. Easily one of the better IPA out there. Overall a very enjoyable IPA."
"A medium body with limited carbonation, HopDevil is a great tasting IPA. Nothing new here. So go out and try one for yourself."
"This has sort of a quintessential (to my mind) IPA flavor, strongly hoppy and interesting. I'd definitely have another, and I wish I could have had one with lunch today (some great Indian food)."
"Thanks to mntlover for sending this bottle Westward in a very generous trade!"
"Palate- big, but not overwhelming. It has a woodsy, piny, hoppy bitterness with a slightly creamy malt undertone. Overall, a very bracing beer which whets the appetite. The bitterness slows down the sipping pace a bit, which is good; there's enough alcohol to cause trouble."
"Go get one today."
"Good hop nose in the glass. Pours a nice Sierra nevade brown under an off-white head. In actual taste, though, hops are not as smacky as one would believe. instead, they start out understated, a nice peppery and grassy start. The toasty malts makes a nice sticky coating in the mouth, allowing the bitterness to linger and become more pronouced, until it finishes full strength."
"Notes: A really enjoyable IPA. Perfect balance between the very hoppy 90 minute and Harpoons milder IPA."
"Rather good beer, if I could get ahold of it more often, I'd drink it more often."
"Fresh off the shelves at Ryan and Casey. Bottled label with best if consumed by.. Aug 07. My initial interpretation of this beer is a bit disappointing. Color and body are great. Glowing orange, medium head retention but great lacing. Cloudy translucency indicating unfiltered, a potential gut bomb. Needless to say this beer is very hoppy, followed by a little too much bitterness IMO, but nonetheless a good tasting beer; mainly characterized by a peachy infused body. A beefy beer, definitely not a session beer."
"I can see having cheeses and or fish or poultry with this."
"The pour is orange with a frothy fading head. This IPA is different from the local breed. Its hoppy flavor is leaning heavily towards the spicy side, rather than the bitter and citrus taste that we around here know and love. I'm not about to give up my Stone and Alesmith IPA's, but this is a very nice change of pace."
"victory is an exceptional brewery, too bad their stuff isn't available in Wisco. Hop Devil is my kind of IPA and I will look for this stuff when home in NC"
"This brew pours a clear blood red color. The large, creamy head is white with reddish hues. The aroma is brash and hoppy, floral. The malt fights through the hoppy and peaks through adding complexity to the aroma. The taste gives the illusion of being balanced during the sip. The aftertaste, however, show this brew's true nature. Nice and hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little lighter than other IPAs I've had. Not that that is bad. It seems to call for you to drink more than one. Overall, this is a very good IPA. A very good beer in general for that matter. This brew has found a permanent stop in my refrigerator."
"overall- i reviewed this over a year ago and wasnt all that impressed. but as my tastes have matured, this is now one of my favorites. dont pass this one up."
"I found this to be similar to 3Floyds Alpha King, which is a good thing, since I really enjoy that beer."
"Thank you North Carolina for popping the beer alcohol limit cap. Poured a reddish oragne tint, 3 fingure light brown head with lacing. Strong hop smell. Smooth taste with a great intense hop finish. Refreshing. This is what I look for in an American IPA. Could only drink about 3 in one sitting."
"D: I don't think I've had a better IPA. Lots of hop presence, but without the bite of some - just smooth. Goes down easy and tastes fantastic. This is definitely THE IPA to give to someone who is uninitiated to the the wonderful world of hops."
"Hazy golden with a nice fluffy white head. Smell is dominated by hops which are both citrusy and floral. Taste is fairly balanced with the malt up front which arrives quite smoothly on the palate, followed by a nice dose of juicy grapefruit hops. The hops are not overly oily, but they do coat nicely and end leaving some bitterness behind. The finish also has taste which I can only describe as sweetly acidic, like an apple with the skin still on it. Overall a very drinkable IPA with a very pleasing hop profile. I like that despite its hazy, unfiltered appearance it wasn't overly heavy or yeasty."
"Pours a deep copper color with a nice beige head that retains well, very nice looking IPA. Aroma is citrusy, floral, resiny, and lightly grassy hops followed by a light bready and slightly sweet malt background. Flavor is citrusy, resiny and lightly floral hops with a nice bready malt backbone that balances alot more than expected. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry, bitter finish and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, as this is alot more balanced that I expected from an IPA. Very nice brew from Victory, i was expectin a hop wallop and i got it but with a sturdy malt backbone that made it a balanced brew which is increasingly uncommon with IPA's."
" Pours from the 12oz bottle a dark copper hue with some red highlights (much darker than I would expect from an IPA), topped by a one-inch head that hangs around for a while. Aroma of spicy floral hops, roasted malt, and a touch of black pepper. Palate is well-balanced between a nice roasted malt character and a big hop presence. Finish is dry with a nice hop bitterness. Good, sturdy body complements the big flavor. Very tasty, and I don't think I'll get tired of it any time soon."
"Poured a yellow-tinged brown in color--perfectly clear. Absolutely no head. Nose was pleasant and had a full bouquet of hops. Lots of hops upfront, but quickly followed by some well-supported malts that help throw this beer into balance. Citrus--particularly grapefruit--comes through as well. Little bit of nuts and butter hiding in this beer too. Mouthfeel was a shade fuller over medium body and just slightly slick. Could not help myself from oredering a second."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced - but still catering to the hopheads. Great beer - wish it was available in Colorado!"
"Perhaps a bit more tame than its west-coast counterparts, but certainly a wonderful beer nonetheless. Since this is available in NC now, it'll certainly be one of my top regulars."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, finishes well without turning too bitter. Lies somewhere between a pale ale and a DFH 60 Minute. Bottle is a lot cleaner than the tap serving. Nice for a change but I'd be pressed to have too many."
"This goes down a bit too smooth for a 6.7%. Good thing I only bought one--I have to get up early tomorrow."
"is there something wrong with my tongue?"
"an excellent representation of an american IPA. hoppy and finishes clean. Dark copper appearance with a solid silky 1 finger head that eventualy busts down to islands. Produces a malt balance that is chewy only to finally stand to the side for a crisp finish. I haven't seen much victory at my local beer stores but after this offering I'll certainly inquire with the beer manager. very fundamental IPA."
"Best before oct 6 2005. Good appearance with nice head and a clear amberbrown beercolor. Nose is fresh hops in caramellic sauce. Good maltyness and full overal noseimpression. As is taste; full caramellic maltyness, fruityness and freshness before going into a good bitterness. Nice and clean but not as fresh as the XX from Ranke I had before this one but could well be cause of age. Full and clean mouthfeel with low but good fitting carbonisation. Well drinkable and would love to do one more to expirience this full flavoured craftbrew from abroad! Ron, dude, you make great beers!"
"Overall, a great IPA, I can see what all the fuss is over this beer, now if only Victory were distributed down here in FL, I would be a very happy man."
"Edit 8/22: Now that Victory has started shipping to Colorado, I'm able to try this again and affirm that it's still my favorite overall IPA."
"Best by Feb 8 05 pours deep copper with a one fingered head that leaves sparse lace on sides of Rastal sniffer. Lightly toasted malt, caramel, toffee sweetness balance the pungent citrusy and floral hop nose from whole flower American hops used in the hopback technique. The malt profile provides flavors of nuts, caramel, and fruity melaniodins from its German malt. Malts are balanced by clean hop bitterness. Still fresh in spite of some aging. Satisfying body and medium mouthfeel. Finishes with malt sweetness & hop bitterness. Menacingly delicious."
"The devil pours a darker hue that most, the cream head rises nicely, then fails through the session. The smell is an explosion of hops, a weird hint of funky caramel tree, very mysterious taste, the hops while noticable didn't come across fresh and alive, the malts were light and downplayed. Very similar to locak IPA (Rat City) Not bad, but better locally brewed IPA's."
"overall: this used to be one of my very favorite ipa's. if i had reviewed this a while back it would have gotten a better rating. i have since had others that i find more appealing. an excellent ipa as it gets great reviews on here, but not perfect. an excellent try."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it takes a really special IPA to grab my attention and this one just isn't that far above average to warrant special mention."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice example of a balanced IPA; plenty of bitter flavors but a nice malty backbone to make it more drinkable"
"One of the best IPA's in the country. I've had it in bottles all these years but somehow have never rated it. I'm glad I finally got to sample it on tap last month at the Victory Brewery in Downingtown, PA. It's copper in color, and in terms of IPA's, it has one of the best and unique blends of malt and hops that bite with an oustanding hoppy bitterness and sweet malt taste. It's nearly perfect in every respect. It won our blind taste test in 2002 of mostly New England IPA's. It's got great lacing on the pour. What more is there to say?"
"What a great beer!"
"The mouthfeel was great, the carbonation was excellent. The drinkability was high, as this is a perfect summertime quaffer. I'll pick the HopDevil out of a crowd again the next time that I'm looking for a good summer beer with some bite."
"Extremely well balanced IPA form Victory. Full-bodied with medium carbonation and a long finish. Very well made and leaves me looking forward to the next bottle, and the next, and..."
"I couldn't pass this one over anymore. Until today it seemed a perpetual second choice, always backing up but never purchased. It pours a beautiful orange tinged ruby red but is lacking any significant head, only a slightly off-white wispy foam covering. Aroma is a citrusy hop blast but with more of a caramel malt backing than some more aggressive ipa's like Alpha King. Taste belies the aggressive hop aroma, I find that this is a very well balanced IPA with enough caramel flavors to offset the massive amount of hops. The mellow citrus/pine flavors finish with just a hint of spiciness. Mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer of almost 7 percent, but all around this is an excellent IPA which won't peal the enamel off of your teeth."
"Copper kettle body with a bright, clear sheen. Thick, substantial, dirty sand head. Nose is huge caramel cookie dough malts. A little toffee in there too, and some charred brown sugar. Bracing hop profile is sappy, resinous, bitter, and mesmerizing. Rich toffee malts are sweet and delicious. Hops come on strong: resinous and bitter. Good balance. Finish dries out with faded cookie malt. My tongue is hop-numbed. Medium to full body, with a creamy feel up front that moves to almost oily. An amazing classic that has yet to disappoint me (even old bottles!)."
"A solid IPA that I enjoy on this, its first trip to the West Coast since I became more aware of good beer. I may enjoy its California brethren a little more, but that probably says more about me than about this beer. Quite good."
"This beer pours a nice deep amber with a good 1 1/2 finger head that stays only for a bit before settling into a tiny frothy cap that sticks around for the rest of the beer. The nose is grapefruit and floral hops with a bit of honey. Mouthfeel is medium-light. Tastes just crisp enough, lots of grapefruit and tons of hop aftertaste, although not as much as you'd expect from the name. Very dry and refreshing. An excellent well priced IPA with a very big taste and presence. Definitely a must try and a great session beer."
"Victory Brewing beers are new to the Texas market and I was quite excited to try them after all the great things I've heard about the beer. Pours a dark amber with a foamy head that dissipates relatively quickly, but retains a thin white layer down to the bottom of the glass. A spicy floral aroma and flavour, but with only a moderate bitterness. Very delicious and certainly one of my favourite IPA's."
"reddish-brown color with thick head, good retention and nice sheets of lacing. smells like musty malt, floral hints with a sweet buttery overall impression. sweet caramel maltiness with a heavy butter-honey flavor for a few seconds building expectation, the a hops crescendo in an earthy, lengthy finish. hops bitterness not as prominent as name of brew might suggest, but very tasty anyways. on the other hand, very easy to drink considering the abv... nice crisp, slightly spicy mouthfeel. solid IPA with a complex hop profile that manages not to go over the top (altho that's sometimes ok too)."
"This beer rocks. I love IPA's, and this one is no exception. With the killer hop bite, warming alcohol, and that amazing spicy kick, this one is a new favourite!"
"D: Very. However, something I've noted as of late... I always considered myself a hophead, but I like a little more ""suttle"" hoppy beer taste rather than them ""stick it in your face"" hoppiness of this and other stong hops beers. I prefer a flavor not so drastic, therefore , my drinkability score is lessened but still, this is one of those special beers if you're looking for the extreme."
"If you are a hophead this is a great beer; especially great on warm summer days like today."
"Price was $8.99 for a sixer, which I thought was high, but for the quality of this beer, it was well worth the price."
"Poured with two fingers of white head that lingered and has good lacing. The beer is a darker amber color. The smell was that of hops. This beer has a great taste of hops with a moderate amount of bitterness. This is one of my favorite beers and it is great having the brewery 45 minutes away."
"This is quite easily drinkable, I will definitely have another sometime."
"The beer poured a deep dark nearly amber liquid with a firm white head that did not last a long time. The hops were quite present in the nose. The citrus came through on the tongue but was not so much in your face that you missed the other qualities of this beer. The mouthfeel was medium and quite refreshing. Came into the bar from a 95+ degree day and this beer quinched my thrist. This is a nice drinkable beer and look forward to some of the other Victory beers coming to Texas."
"A devilish brew, and fantastic offering from a very respectable brewery."
"Drinkability is very good a very tastey well balanced IPA."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Very nice!"
"Overall a great beer. I wish I had regular access to this one. While not as appealing to me as Stone's (also not available to me), I enjoy it a bit more than my regular Harpoon."
"Finger licking good."
"Bottle obtained from Sulldaddy and consumed about a week later. Pours a on-finger ahzelnut head over a cloudy dull rust-orange liquid. Smells of grapefruit pith with gentle undertones of apricot. Tastes woonderful. Sweet and grapefruit citrusy with moticable fruit esters. Apricot, gentle peach, piney sour tang, and honey. The beer is dry and has a cinnamon quality about it, as well as some tannin. The ending is caramelly sweet sugary with a citrus aftertaste. A nice easy drinking beer that's really tasty. Medium mouthfeel and mildly carbonattion creates a very gentle carbonation sting that plays well with the hop bitter."
"This is my everyday drinking beer. I have two cases of this in my beer fridge at all times. For me to not give it a 5 for drinkability would be criminal."
"Mouthfeel is good. Not to heavy and nice carbonation keeps the palate sharp. Drinkability is very good. They go down so easy that quick palate fatique is not an issue. Overall a very good IPA, not the best in my book, but one that I will definitly come back to again and again"
"This is a gorgeous brew. Dark copper, caramel in color with a nice overall red hued body. Three-quarter inch light tan head which reduced to a small layer. Smell is a little weak overall but good nonetheless. I pick up some floral and pine hop aromas over a nice sweet bread-like malt base. This one presents itself with an initial spiciness on the tongue and back of the mouth with pine overtones which transitions over to a very bitter resin finish which lingers for a long while. A very balanced beer as it is hoppy enough to seem bitter while still containing some maltyness in the background. Mouthfeel is as good as they come with an IPA, full and coats the palate well. I think this is one of the more full bodied IPAs Ive had. Drinkability is very good as well due to the nicely crafted balanced. I find this to be what most east coast IPAs are striving for."
"12 oz., best before 11/20/04, but I kept it to see what would happen. Pours a caramel/copper color with a 1 finger head that leaves decent lacing. Lots of malts in the aroma along with a grapey scent that lets you know it's not a fresh beer. It's got bready/biscuity malts with floral hops that leave a healthy bitterness. It's tingly and a little warming and much better when fresh."
"A really tasty, kick you in the face, upfront, somewhat harsh, still smooth IPA. If I had regular access I would probably pick up a bunch for a session. I will sleep very well tonight. Thanks to blitz134 for the bottle!"
"Pop the top and the hops don't stop!!! Tastes as good as it smells. This is the beer that drove me over the edge to hop heaven. I am now an admitted hop-head and it's spoiled me for life. Every morning I wake up and crave the hoppy after-taste and it's all because of HopDevil. I can't live without it. Join the Hop Celebration!!"
"Note: A good mix of hearty pine hop belches after the first sip or two."
"The drinkability was quite good--it was refreshing and crisp; though I feel that the relatively high ABV, though not noticable in the taste, limits the sessionability of this fine ale."
"Drinkability: great. good session IPA."
"IPA's are good, this one too. Doesn't make the top for me though."
"I enjoyed this brew despite its being so dog-gone hoppy. If you are a hop lover this is a brew for you. There are enough malt notes to make it intersing but this copper colored beauty is the real hop deal. It has a short lived white head that leaves plenty of lacing on the glass, it has a citrus and biscuit aroma and a ctrus pith and biscuit taste. Dry as the desert an mutli-layered from the first grapefruit and orange rind sip to the biscuit and carmel that fleetingly appears before a long dry citrus finish. A great drinking beer!"
"A V for Victory!"
"Drinkability-I would definately buy again, however because of the hoppiness I would limit it to 1 to 2 a nite, but I'm not a hop head, yet."
"Hand-pump draft at the London Grill. Pours a deep copper color with a creamy head poured off to about 1/2 "" that that disappeared everywhere but to the edges & stuck to the pint glass the whole way down. Aroma is hoppy (duh!) with a surprising amount of malt. Taste is a wallop of piney, grapefruity hops in the beginning that totally gives way to malt in the middle, then reappears again on the swallow. Smooth, medium mouthfeel. The taste of hops will coat your tongue long after the last sip is gone. Overall: FANTASTIC!!! I'm not a hop-head, but I love this beer. The hops are strong, but not overpowering, and I get my malt fix in the middle. Victory's usual standard of excellence is met fully on this one!!"
"I purchased this beer in a sample box containing the Lager, Prima Pils, and Golden Monkey (which I would also highly reccomend). This beer is very smooth with an excellent, almost sweet aftertaste. The initial taste is slightly spicy, but hardly overwhelming. It is otherwise rich in flavor and almost 'thick' for lack of a better term in consistency. To me, this is a perfect 'after work' beer."
"I never consider myself a hop head. I am not a big fan of overly hopped beers, as i feel they lack balance. That being said , i have been seduced by the mystical hop devil!. Victory Brewing is a top notch brewer. They really work hard to produce beautiful beers, and hop devil is no exception. I love the balance of this beer, you cant miss the big hops in the glass, rich amber color and floral bouquet, the smell of hops wafting from my glass. But the balance in the mouth is perfect. This beer is a winner all around. You can feel the love that the 2 brewmasters from victory put into there craft. Good job fellas!"
"Not an overwhelming flavor, but it delivers what it says: hops all over. Malt balance is lacking, obviously. It works for the style. My biggest problem is the somewhat watery mouthfeel and consistency--add some heaviness."
"The name and the blurb on the bottle both boasted of a bold hop deliverance, but didn't quite live up to it. A sneaky beer with its high ABV and great balance, but I prefer the hop monsters for the style."
"Drinkability: Good if you like beers that are not really any particular style. This thing is an abomination of sorts. Not on my list for future consumption, and certainly not on my all star IPA list. This was not a Victory for my taste. I am not trying to hate on this stuff, but I am disappointed."
"This is a fine offering, but I found it wanting due in large part to its buttery aspects."
"Always thought malts would be my luv, nowI have a new mistress hop-devil to contend with."
"Drinkability- One of the better balanced IPA's I have had. A very nice treat."
"Excellent IPA."
"This could give Two Hearted (my favorite IPA) some serious competition."
"Overall = Decent American IPA. I recommend it although it's not at the very top of my list."
"Amber-orange in color and a little cloudy with the perfect amount of carbonation and decent cling with a frothy small head. Smell is definately hoppy. Just the right amount of hop flavor with a little bit of spice. It's a little bitter with that typical victory malt flavor. In my opinion the perfect balance of malt and hop flavor for an IPA. Mouthfeel is dry. I will be stocking this one for sure."
"Perhaps the name and/or ABV had me in a pre-mind set, but this is one well crafted IPA that can be enjoyed over & over. Slight peppery undertones with a even, smooth taste that has just the right mix of hops. Not too sharp, actually very even with a nice, soft peek of hops at the throat. Ironically, the great citrus nose didn't carry to the taste (there is some fruitiness, but very mild), but so what? This is one even, smooth IPA that I would buy again."
"Pouring into a pint glass, it pours an amber color with lots of white frothy head with beautiful cascading. Aroma is lots of sharp, piney hops that hits your nose hard and a slight grapefruit aroma. Some very little sugars and sweetness comes through also. Taking a sip it comes very smooth and hoppy up front with a buttery feel throughout the swallow. A bit of sugar on the finish along with the citrus tones (underlying). The carbonation balances well with the flavors; medium-bodied IMO. Great tasting brew that is super-drinkable due to the feel. I'm glad I got plenty of this one!"
"This is just a fantastic brew. Very pretty amber I.P.A. that pours a nice full head. And oh, the smell. Very, very hoppy with a touch of citrus, and rather bitter. The spiciness of this beer is quite unique among I.P.A.'s, which generally lack complexity. Very drinkable, and at 6.7 ABV multiple pours won't do too much damage..."
"HopDevil seems to be readily available, so if not a case, a 6-pack is definitely worth getting to at least try it. Even if you're new to the IPA style, this is the one to get; this was the one that was newest to me when I really started to appreciate it."
"Pours a beautiful clear orange with a medium sized lasting head. Smells of citrus and hops. Taste is wonderfully balanced, with the hops taste being clear but never overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is one of the best and most drinkable IPAs out there."
"Very nice orange color with a hazy cloud to it. Firm thick head disappearing nicely as the drink did. Good smell almost toasted flavor, the hoppy flavor wasn't too much it was just right. this is one beer that goes well with spicy food like curry the hops cut through the heat. Very drinkable a nice food beer!!"
"I had this during the Victory event at the Blind Tiger. Among the 4 styles of Victory I tried, the good ole' HopDevil still stole the night. I've had The Devil countless times in a bottle and on tap, and even a couple of times from a cask, but it was especially good this time, perhaps because of its freshness. In addition to the lovely hops, this almost perfectly balanced ale has a crisp, slightly burnt maltiness coming through the strong, earthy body. This tasting proved again to me that you just can't go wrong with the Devil."
"All in all, it's a good beer, but I enjoy Stone's IPA more. This one doesn't have enough sweetness to balance it out, but I like hops so I can't really hold it against it. I would have preferred it to be a bit maltier, but on the whole, it's a great beer and one that I'd probably pick up again when I need an old familiar brew."
"Overall-I am angry that I was so late in finally getting to drink this fabulous beer. A sheer pleasure to drink in every respect and a beer that has acheived its fanfare and fame through sheer drinkability and hop character. A must-try."
"its got that carmel color with a nice one finger hear that leaves you very soon. leaves some slight lacing, and has that fruity grapefruit smell. at first its a bit malty, and then transitions into citrus. I feel its a little thick for an ipa, little syrupy, however goes very well with a ribeye steak. feels ok in your mouth, and if you wait for that tingly sensation its way good. Good example of a hoppy ale, and one of Victories staple points. I hear Victories hop wallup is good stuff, but if you can't find it, this is good stuff."
"This one is even better on cask. Bravo Victory!"
"Pours a cloudy dark reddish orange with a slight off white head. Smell is estery, fruity, slightly malty. Taste is big hops with some toasted malt fighting its way through to the end. The malt provides a good balance to the assault of citrous and pine hop flavors. Slight breadiness from the malt smooth out the sharpness of the hops. There is an spicy flavor that is there from the beginning and lingers in the aftertaste with those lovely alpha acids. That spice makes this quite a good winter ale."
"I honestly gave this beer a few chances before I reviewed it. Now I'm convinced. This beer is just not that good overall, and definitely not a good IPA. I have no idea why this beer is rated so high. Amber body with not much of a head. Nice sweet hoppy aroma with some citrus that even my gf liked. Taste is a different story though. Is this a marco pale ale Im drinking? Where the hell is the flavor? It tastes so stale and bland in my opinion. Watered down. Dead hop flavor. I need some hops here. They call this beer HopDevil? I call that false advertising."
"A truly excellent brew. The aroma doesn't quite do justice to the ass kicking your taste buds are about to receive, but everyone likes a surprise, right? Unfortunately, I imagine drinking a few of these would leave your taste buds in a comatose state for a few days."
"proof that a great IPA dosnt have to wreck your tastebuds and tip you over after one bottle. pours out a nice red tinged sunset and smells of wonderful citrus hops. taste is solid and balanced, a firm dose of hops with enough malt backbone to keep up. some light sweetness, bitter but not overly so, lightly spicy. medium bodied, somewhat filling but not a bloater. a very well rounded beer that shows its mucles with balance and flavor insted of all out bitterness. top notch."
"As were some other reviewers, I was very surprised at how well-balanced this beer was. It reminded me a lot of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, which is a good thing. Probably a bit hoppier than SNCA, but the hops are not overwhelming as I feared. Drinkability quite high. I would definitely buy this beer if I could find it anywhere in my area."
"Mouthfeel was about what expected from the hop balance, and it was pretty drinkable... I would have rated it higher, had it been a little less mild and a little more bitter. I like a bit more of that from an IPA."
"I am generally a huge fan of this beer and of all Victory products. The bottle I am reviewing, however, left a little to be desired. Maybe it was the Speakeasy I had before it, maybe it was a bad bottle. Who knows. Anyway, aside from the pronounced hoppy fruitiness I picked up on what I can only describe as a sort of rancid mayonaisse typet taste. Not good. I will try this one again from time to time as I have in the past. Hopefully the next one will be better."
"Clean and crisp taste w/ a nice bitter aftertaste. The beer has some malt to it and a bouqet of hops, which justifies it's name. Make no mistake, this in no where close to the ""Hop Wallup""...this is the one you can drink all evening. Perfect carbonation...keeps you salivating for more. I always try and keep this beer on hand...if you want to go take a chance on an IPA you've never tried, go buy this tonight. If you can't find it, let me know...I'll hunt it down for you."
"Pours into a pint glass a beautiful amber with a slightly off white 2 finger head. Great smell of hops.Taste is hops but in no way overbearing,beautifully balanced with malt side just as powerful. A great session brew for me,,a must to keep in stock.A+"
"A very well-balanced IPA, highly drinkableI have to admit Id like a bit more aromatics and hop bite though."
"The bottle I am sampling from is a couple weeks past the best by date, so it does not have the fresh hop taste of a new bottle. It is still, however, a quality IPA."
"I am more impressed by this beer than I expected, I haven't had good luck with some of the ""top 100"" hyped beers."
"Dare I say it... it could use some more hops to live up to the name. When I picked up this bottle I expected a completely uneven hop monster. Quite to the contrary, this bad boy is pretty damn balanced. Caramel malt is all over the place. This isn't a bad thing. It was a delightful surprize. This is my first brew from Victory and I'm pleased."
"Final Thought: This is a great beer with a weak appearence... one of the best IPA's out there."
"Taste: This is a rock solid American IPA, it has a good balanced of hops to malt. The hops win but the malts do show up. A pleasing piney aftertaste finishes it off. Very drinkable, I can go through a few of these and still crave more of the deveil's alphas. Victory brews a damn fine IPA."
"Overall: an excellent complex IPA with smooth bitterness."
"In spite of all the many great beers i've had in my time, this remains a favorite, it's always good. Darker than most, it pours a deep amber with a chunky oatmeal colored head. Excellant retention with heavy lacing. Smell of glorious hops balanced between citrus and spruce, tantalizing. Wonderfully full hop flavor rounded by a perfect balance of malt. Orange/grapefruit marmalade contrasted by spicy/biting pine, this is perfection! Warning, a sip may lead to mass consumption so buy at least a sixer!"
"This is a big IPA that has much in the malt backbone. I get the fresh hops nose and the IBU's are certainly there but after two or three sips I noticed the malty midbody and the strong finish. Like all Victory products brewers skill is readily apparent in this very nice beer."
"Pours a red color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, but not as arrogant as I expected it to be. There is some caramel malt that can be detected in the back. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. There is a nice malt character to battle the large amount of hops. Well done."
"Handpull from the Drafting Room in Exton. Orangey copper colour, bordering on red this time around. Hmmmm, darker on cask are we? Head is small bits of white, lacing is not good. Aromas are less hoppy and more malty than I seem to recall. The taste is actually a bit more calm than the devil on tap, but it is no less amazing. Hoppy up front with a very bready malt flavor in the middle and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is cask goodness, drinkability does not waver. Three serving types and three 4.5's across this board. Perhaps Victory should rename their flagship brew ""Consistent Devil"""
"Pours a warm amber with a tan head. Smells very hoppy with pines shining through. In the mouth it tastes great. Hoppy, but not overly hoppy. Hop falvors range from pine to citrus to full-on bitterness. A nice amound of malts start shining through towars the finish, but it ends quite hoppy. A very well rounded ""IPA"" with a great aftertaste. This is one of my favorite beers, I don't know how I managed to skip reviewing this one. This is a common find in my fridge. A classic beer, and one that I will cherish forever. Cheers, my friends."
"Pour immediately overcome with a division of tiny spherical parachuters rocketing in reverse. Smell is damp with rich but distant foam of raisin. After several the head seems to form a Mandlebrot formation on the glass. Hops, of course. The alcohol is faint in a warmth that spreads across the palate. Could be more voluptuous, but I like them skinny. Certainly enough to work with. Droopy lacing follows but the parachuters keep coming long as I can manage to contain myself."
"The taste is good but it doesn't really jump out for me. I like a DFH 60 min. IPA much better than this. Stil decent though. Finishes bubbly and balanced with a fuzzy mouthfeel. Its okay for drinkability -not as good as others in this style."
"I could drink these all night long."
"Its a good beer with a very bold taste."
"Nice amber orange color-no real head but theres some nice lacing on the glass. Subtle hop aroma-doesnt scream like a lot of the US- IPAs. Nice flavor-malty backround with a big,upfront hop presence. Very citrusy-grapefruit like,spruce? A touch of residual malt sweetness in the end. Nice solid body An enjoyable beer all around-another fine effort by Victory."
"Pretty red-orange hue with significant carbonation and a silky cream-colored head with scattered, arachnoid lacing. Nice malty sweet and flowery nose with a subtle hint of diacetyl and light caramelization. Very well-balanced flavor with great cherry-caramel maltiness and subdued hop profile for an American IPA. This review is based on a less than fresh sample consumed two weeks after the drink before date and I actually prefered this one over the many fresh samples that I've had in the past. Moderate cellaring took some edge off of the hop character and really opened up the malt base. A great American IPA that still pays homage to its English ancestors, particularly when its allowed to mature in a nurturing environment."
"I was expecting this beer to be a lot more hoppy than it is. for the record, this 6 pack has a best before date of a little over a month ago, so, I think that may have something to do with it."
"12 oz. bottle pours a burnt orange color. Has a one finger head that fades quickly. Earthy, smokey smell. The taste is of caramel, smoke, at first then a rush of fresh floral hops in a medium body. Finishes with a slightly bitter grapefruit bite. Not bad, but not fresh tasting either."
"It poured a brilliant copper red color with a respectable sized frothy head that left loads of lace trails. The aroma is of citrusy, piney hops up front, but also a competent honey nutty maltiness. The taste is a mass of layered hop flavors, very floral, piney, citrusy and resinous. Its definitely less focused on the Grapefruity Cascades than Liberty Ale (one of the only other APAs Ive tried). The intense hoppyness is kept to heel by a big bold maltiness, theres graham crackers and a nuttyness in the malt profile. The carbonation is soft making for a very subtle medium bodied mouthfeel. The finish is very bitter and lingers for a while. This beer is infinitely drinkable and refreshing."
"Victory HopDevil Ale has a beautiful red coloring to it with very mild carbonation. Head retention is good, with 1 to 2 cm that produces lovely Belgian lace. It smells of hops and malt, but the hops are the predominating aroma. It has a well ballanced taste, for something that is called ""HopDevil""; the hops are definitly there, but I was plesantly suprised to have such a balance of the two. It is smooth & begs you for another sip, but be careful with this one at 6.7% ABV. An excellent beer by all respects."
"very clear, but intense ambery red color. puffy head, excellent lacing. smells like hops hops hops, duh. maybe a little citrusy scent in there. tastes great. tastes like hops, but not gratutiously so. i'm pleasantly surpised to find a nice balance here. i thought it would just be ""let's see how intense and hoppy we can make this beer," which would actually be cool, as i tend to like crazy beers. but this beer is very well balanced and, well, damn near perfect. it's got a mellow tone to it that i didn't expect to be present. great mouthfeel. by the way, as i imbibe this tasty beverage the lacing continues down the glass... sweet. drinkability... let's just say i could pour this on my cereal in the morning. boo ya. great beer. cheers."
"The brew pours a clear amber color with a soft fluffy beige head foaming up very easily about 2 cm. Aroma is all hops with piney scents mixing with sour grapefruit and some lighter floral scents too. The first sip reveals a lighter body than expected and a slightly oily texture. There is a very mild carbonation.Hop flavor is present almost immediately after a brief sugary sweetness on my lips. The hop flavors are primarily pine and grapefruit, similar to the nose. The beer is very smooth and easy to drink even for the strong hoppiness that exists."
"Another fine beer from Victory."
"By far, one of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's a shame I can't see this one regularly, as it makes me so happy to pop one open and treat myself to a great tasting beer. This beer has it where it counts, right in the mouth. It's all there. I need to move to a better state."
"Extremely drinkable and tasty. There are better IPA's out there, but this one is quite good."
"Edit: I picked up a fresh bottle of this, so heres what I find different. The nose is a bit more hop than I remember, with some citrusy grapefruit in there. I like it. The flavor is pretty nice as well. The hops carry through well. I like it. I'm more impressed with this beer this time."
"Pours a light orange color. Great aroma. Tons of floral hops mixed with some light hops. A nice frothy head remains consistent throughout the duration of the beer. The initial flavor is a bit acidic, but it calms down as you drink and settles into a great tasting IPA. Be careful though, this beer is almost to easy to drink and has a fairly high ABV. One of the better IPA's I've ever had. This one competes with Stone Ruination in my book. Tough to decide which one I like better. Enjoy!"
"The beer pours a lovely caramel color with a full hop aroma and is an excellent example of an American IPA. Good clean malts in the background. The alcohol is not noticeable. The American hops are delicious. Cascade or Cluster hops? The head was not impressive. Overall, a pleasant brew and a joy for hop lovers."
"After a few of these I'd be ready for the seven course meal."
"Make sure you get bottles that are not out of date; it's been my experience that this does not hold up to age very well."
"'Bout time I review an area classic... Poured a clear, reddish amber with a small, thick, light tan head that remained for the entire glass. The nose was spicy and citrusy with a doughy, malty backbone, that sometimes smelled like a danish. Taste was spicy up front, slightly fruity and really sour in the middle, like a bowl of warm grape nuits, then comfortably bitter at the finish. The bitterness remained on my palate for quite a while. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. At times, Hop Devil acted like Arrogant Bastard's little brother, but more timid and not so in your face. It's nicely balanced. Great stuff."
"The flavor is an outstanding blend of fruity flavor and dry, roasty hop flavor. A distinct sweet malt flavor comes throug as well."
"Drinkability: I could have had several of these."
"A very nice IPA, I'd like to try a little fresher bottle, but this is still very nice."
"This is a superior IPA: full bodied, bitter, aromatic. I'd love to try this one in a blind flight with Stone IPA (my current favorite). This one is very close."
"thank you victory."
"A solid session IPA at 6.7% abv. Heaven for a hophead (or should I say hell for a hopdevil?). One of the most flavorful and strong IPA's out there. Actually borders a Double IPA. Very tough to improve on this style."
"Had this on-tap at the new Phillies' Citizens Bank Park. Nice to now be able to watch another victory by the Phils and enjoy a Victory brew at the same time. Downside's the plastic cup!"
"Pours pretty clear and ambery copper colored with a beige head. rather short-lived. Pine resin and citrusy hop aromas and higher-than-normal (for an AIPA) caramelly malt presence evident in the nose. Black tea-like malt sweetness interplayed with some higher alpha hops. One of the best balanced IPA the States has to offer. Carbonation is about average to sligthly lower, but it lets the flavors ride out as they should. This is a reasoable stong beer that I consider almost too easy to drink. I've been having this beer since it's inception, and it is a good, reasonably priced staple beer. Only problem with it is that I've burnt myself out on it. Flipsiding the coin, I sincerely thank Victory and its PA distributors on burning me out on quality and its ready availability."
"Bottle: Poured a clear medium brown beer with a nice head with above standard retention. Aroma is quite nice with the hops defiantly in evidence. Taste is quite refreshing with a nice dosage of hops leaving a very enjoyable bitterness on my tongue. Full body without a hint of the alcohol showing. Great one for Victory."
"A kick-ass beer. Everything you want in an AIPA. Hops, a bit of sweet honey, and a long-lasting bitterness. Great mouthfeel and drinkability. Resinous pine hops everywhere on the palate. Beautiful appearance. A staple in my beer fridge."
"The hops on the nose are assertive for sure, but there is also plenty of malt and caramel. The distinguishing characteristic here is the rich mouthfeel- not sweet, but rich. Hops carry through all the way till the end and never lose their support. Great effort all around!"
"From the first pour it looked and smelled just like Old Ho, with a slightly accentuated hop profile in the aroma, some apple in the aroma as well. Tast is the same with a lingering sweet and hop combo that is very tasty. Mouthfeel was slightly sticky, like that of Old Ho. Very fine beer, and very drinkable..."
"hopdevil ale pours a medium amber with a nice lacy head that clings to the glass well. aroma is super hoppy and citrusy. taste is an almost carbon copy of the smell. again, extemely hoppy with a grapefruit citrus flavor. subtle maltiness brings up the rear. mothfeel is a slick, oily, slighty sticky carbonated masterpiece. drinkability is good for 6.7% abv... almost too good. also had this in cask - terrific. wish i had made some notes. awesome ale."
"An easy beer to drink. Almost a good summer-days bbq beer. Very non-offensive."
"Darkish amber, big white head. Smells hoppy, obviously... citrus, hoppy, some fruit but not overpowering. Taste is very good, a very strong hop presence but still balanced by some malt and bitterness at the finish. As my handle suggests, I'm not too much of a hophead - I still think the mouthfeel is a little too oily, and the drinkability, for me at least, is pretty much limited to having one or two with dinner. (having said that, it goes great with food, I made some Italian last night and it went wonderfully with the olive oil...) Overall, it's the only IPA I'll really drink, and I'd highly recommend it to other newbies just cutting their teeth on hoppy beers."
"This is the 2nd beer style that I have tried from Victory Brewing and both times I've been very impressed. Good brewery..."
"This is definitely a keeper."
"Found this one on tap. The color was a nice light amber with a decent head. The smell was fantastic. I usually have to try real hard to pick up on the sublte aroma in most beer but this one was loaded with it. Very nice hop/citrous smell. The taste was also fantastic. Well balanced maltiness with a good strong hop flavor. This beer was delicious. I could really enjoy several of these. This style is generally not my favorite but I really enjoyed this."
"Big thanks to Drweizen for sending this way out here to Kansas."
"Taste is divine; I'm not a real hop-head and for me it was the perfect balance of the bitterness and the flowery overtones of the hops. Crisp but not too tart. To my taste buds, this is exactly what a top-notch IPA should taste like. Bravo to Victory for this amazing brew."
"Floral and hoppy on the tongue, but I can't help but compare this to Stone's IPA, and come up lacking in every which way. A bit piney towards midsip with flavor of grapefruit. Good, but not great."
"Ah.. the appearence. This brew is a amber color with a nice white head the laces on the side of the glass. The appearence jumps out and says drink me. The aroma of hops explodes out of this bottled beer. It smells like American hop varieties (which I believe are the best) and has much greater aroma than the average IPA. The aroma adds to the taste which packs alot of flavoring hops into this beer. The bittering hops are balanced nicely with the malt and it makes the brew a very drinkable ale."
"Wyll-"
"A very strong example of an IPA. Not the best I've had, but nothing to sneeze at."
"Body is medium, finish fades fast, comes off rather flat...i've had this from a freshly tapped keg once, and was happy with it then, perhaps I can retry with a fresher bottle (for the likelihood of finding it on tap around here is nil to none)...a nice IPA, but not so spectacular."
"For a 6.7% ABV beer with a big all-around hop presence, this is surprizingly -- almost dangerously -- drinkable. I enjoyed every sip of this IPA -- and the head is still there!"
"Had this on tap last evening while at Mahars. Brew had a nice deep amber color with a nice light tan head that had very good retention and left lacing through out the brew. The aroma had a strong floral and citrus hop note that did not seem as pungent as when served from a bottle. The taste, a sharp hop hit up front that dominated most of the experience, but I was able to catch enough of a malt taste that tries to balance it out, it fails but with this type of brew that is expected. The finish is still hop, a nice finish to this brew. Ok, now for the thing that has kind of thrown me a bit, I like this brew better from the bottle. Not sure if this brew was getting to its last legs at Mahars but it seemed to lack the character of the bottled version that I know much better. Will try it again on tap in the future and will edit my findings if the differ!"
"The drinkability is unbelievable, this well-balanced IPA comes in at 6.7%, which in my opinion isn't very high, but high enough to get the job done and low enough to not over do it. Great IPA...."
"This is one of my favorite beers and probably the best IPA that I've had, although Duclaw Venom is basically a clone.. A bright orange/amber color and light brown head. It has a very floral and citric hop flavor and aroma. Very refreshing for a beer of moderate alcohol content, this beer goes down very well, full of flavor and very refreshing. It also leaves a nice buzz very quickly at 6.7 abv. Being one of the most flavorful, delicious beers and only 6 dollars per sixer at College Square liquors in Westminster MD this is a top notch brew that will not disappoint any hop head."
"I must say I have had this beer on tap many, many times and it certainly is fresher than my bottled example 10 days past the enjoy before date, but the only missing component is the hop aroma and perhaps some of the hop flavor. Still a great IPA."
"This one has a dark amber colored body, bubbly cream head on top. The scent is oily, sappy, and loaded with hops. For the main course of the taste, this one is featuring delicious hops, with a slick oil feel on the tounge. Some orange characteristics, slightly acidic. Not as intensly hoppy as say hop ottin, i think this beer is better blended than some of the other hops monsters. Great beer."
"Poured a clear light amber color with a sticky cream-tan colored head, good retention. Aroma was of spicy piney hops and a slight alcohol sweetness. Enormous hop taste, but somehow balanced out with a sweetness mid-palate, finishing with a dry spicy hop aftertaste and a twinge of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is heavy to medium, and carbonation is low. This is quite a treat for any hop-lover, although it is a bit extreme otherwise."
"Drinkability: I could sit out in the warm Arizona spring and drink this all day with some meat from the grill!"
"good with a cigar as well"
"The aroma is a beautiful thing. A strong hop smell that almost reminds me of freshly cut grass. A great aroma. The first taste is perfect. Slightly sweet malt at first that smoothly transitions into a perfectly strong hop bitterness. Good hop character that is not overwhelming. The beautiful bitterness lasts for quite awhile in the back of the throat. Magnificently balanced. The mouthfeel is medium in body and goes well with the beer. A incredibly drinkable beer."
"In my experience, this IPA is 2nd only to Two-Hearted. This is an amazingly well-crafted brew that I could gladly drink all night. The hops are intoxicating, yet never overbearing. This brew makes me smile from ear to ear. World-class."
"Drinkability: I was a little let down by this IPA, but it's still good and can be enjoyed in most situations."
"Pours to a frothy, permanent head and orange color. Aroma was typically hoppy. Flavor was more complex than the typical American IPA, with distinctive British fruitiness and spicy hop flavor mingled with malty sweetness. Finishes nicely bitter and refreshing. A very good bottled IPA. This stuff must be even better on tap."
"....I can't wait to try the Storm King Stout!"
"Feels nice and chewy in the mouth, small hints of of sweetness, caramel, and roasted malts. Sometimes notes of Cotten candy pop out. The hops come on big in the back of the mouth, rocking all over the senses. Sometimes they feel just too apbrasive though. It's great, but a touch too much for me."
"This is a beautiful beer. Nice head, off-white some what brown, leaves a nice lace on the side of the glass. Smells wonderful, there must be hops in there. And there most certainly are. The taste is amazing, lovely hops exploding all over the taste buds-spicy: tastes graet and feels great This has become one of my favorites."
"I mandated a pitstop at Victory's while driving through PA on a family vacation. I had the Hop Devil on tap and brought some home. This is probably my favorite IPA. Agressively hopped, but not overly bitter with an awesome flavor. Nice aroma. Beautiful coppery color I love in my IPA's and pale ales. This is one of those beers I appreciated more and more the more I drank. It left me longing for more. Much to my delight, they now distribute to Ohio. I must admit that overall, I wasn't impressed with many of Victory's other beers. Not that they were bad, but the Hop Devil and their Storm King Imperial Stout seemed to be a notch or 2 above the rest of their lineup. But the Hop Devil is absolutely top notch and always welcome in my refrigerator."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA."
"Overall Impression: Wow, what a let down. I paid big bucks to get this shipped to me given the reputation it had, and while it nicely presented a hop taste, there just wasn’t any “bang”. Drinkability doesn’t suffer, I’d gladly drink these at length, but I’m not ordering any more. If it was the local tap, I could see getting excited about this drinkable IPA, but the beer just was too mild mannered. Hop DEVIL? Devil took my $20 bill and vanished in the air. I just don’t see this as a top 20 beer. Good, yes. Outstanding? Not to me."
"Thanks, anyway, Bighuge, for the opportunity."
"Not quite perfect, this is still a very good beer"
"While going to see a friend's band perform at the North Star bar, I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap. It poured out a hazy copper color with a creamy thick semi-tan head. The smell was dominated by a sweet-fruity aroma with a sweet malt undertone. The taste was very similar to that of the aroma, as it was full of bitter hops and some spices. While the hops are over-powering, they are not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth. I could easily sit back and enjoy several of these before I realized how many I actually had. Kudos to Victory for creating this wonderful IPA!"
"And hey, isn't the illustration on the label the cutest thing? Hops with horns and a devilish smile, quite characteristic of this brew. If you haven't tried IPAs, try this, then the Dogfish 60, and work your way up. Once you go hop, you never stop."
"If you like IPA you'll like it...if you don't like IPA you might like it anyway."
"Overall, this beer is extremely satisfying, and well worth the $8ish per sixpack at which i can acuire it locally. It has become a staple in my beer fridge. Definitely one of my favorite, and most drinakable, commercial IPAs. (The other is Tupper's Hop Pocket)."
"So in short, good in flavor, poor in subtlety."
"Off-white colored head disappeared to a ring and some film and left no lace. The beer was golden amber in color and fairly transparent. The aroma was of spicy hops. Smooth, light, and refreshing beer. Mostly piney hops in the aroma with a decent bite."
"Deep amber colour with an off-white head that doesn't last very long. Faint smell of fruit and hops. My nose is somewhat suprised, it was expecting more. Starts out with a mild fruityness that i really enjoy. Then i get what im here looking for, hops. I was anticipating a firm hop filled kick to the mouth, but what i got was more like a gentle placing of my beloved herb on my tongue."
"Clear amber body wearing a thin sticky off-white head. Aroma is bready, toasty not unlike a good pilsner's, but with a huge cascade profile (grapefruit, orange) and traces of earth and honey. Taste is typicla to high alpha-acid hops IPA, very lemony, grapefruity. A tart and bitter mix with no stand out quality. Body is clean, rather thin with a biting carbonation. Overrated from my perspective, not even among my favorite half of the style I believe, but the aroma is good and quite complex. Thanks to The_Beer_God though!"
"A very drinkable brew. I could make this a session brew. At 6.7 it is weighing in slightly for a session brew but I think it could happen."
"But it tastes hoppy all right, with creamy, lingering resin that clings to your tongue with piny persistance, while fierce little scrubby bubbles work the resin deeper. This is all about the hops, the malt forming only a vague background. A pleasant little devil."
"Notes: better than i thought. If you like your hops, this is it."
"The first sip offers an expected but pleasantly strong floral hop character. What I do not expect is the malt: it's very evident and underpins the hops perfectly. It has a very light mouthfeel, which is an achievement given the strong malt character, and the carbonation is spot on for the style: medium-to-high and very crisp. At its coldest, it doesn't appear too complex: the malts and hops are dominant and at first do not offer any other characteristics. As it warms mid glass, the above-average alcohol becomes evident, but balances perfectly with the malts and hops. Orange zest flavors start to sneak in at the finish."
" Is good... More please!"
"Pours dark auburn, with a puffy off white head. frothy, leaves a ton of lace. On cask , so the mouthfeel was very soft and smooth. very pleasant. Sweet malt on the tongue, back ground of citrusy hops. Grapefruit. Flavors are vibrant and well defined. This beer tasted FRESH. Well crafted and served. well worth the high marks it receives."
"Appearance: Caramel amber huge creamy off white head leaves evenly strewn rings of lacing. Aroma: Buttery cascades caramel covered whole hops great aromatics. Balance is what makes this beer works so well that smack of hops with a great sweet bready smelling malt backbone. Taste: INSANE, great tasting beer very much heavenly mixture the hops are accented by the cask serving type the warmth of the beer with the creamy texture carries the flavor so well. If you love this beer on draught and the bottle find it on cask well worth you beer hunting. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied creamy texture so hop resins gliding along the palate. Drinkability: Freakin' amazing, simply effortless to enjoy."
"Certainly clear copper-color, creamy cap, crisp carbonation, conservation, cling. An ale all about assertive American alpha acid aroma. Buttered biscuit backbone basically breathes British barley bits. Flavor flaunts flowery flair, finishes fairly faint. Small smooth sizzling sensation supports several soothing sips."
"Oranges, caramel, cardboard, citrus hops and herbal hops throughout. Solid flavor and a very full in the mouth. An excellent IPA."
"This beer poured a golden/amber color with a creamy semi-tan head. Slightly hazy in the body and lots of lacing along the glass. Aroma is very floral and slightly pungent. Taste is hoppy up front with lots of flowery taste, almost like I am eating a flower. The middle is still floral hoppy but the body fills in more providing more of a creamy, nutty malt backbone. The finish is tart and dry with a grapefruit flavor and maybe a little alcohol as well. Quite excellent and amazingly well done. This is intensely hoppy yet balance is provided along with a good mouthfeel. Simply a great beer."
"As a fan of IPAs, I was thrilled to see HopDevil on cask at the Sunset. It had a slightly hazy orange color, and modest white head. The hops were intense but balanced by a very sweet malt presence. I enjoyed the fruity notes, hints of a spice, and the overall drinkability of the beer. It was truly delightful."
"Sweet bottle. The hopdevil is cool."
"If you like India pale, this is one to drink. It's a very drinkable ale."
"It pours a deep amber color with a substantial head that laces down the entire length of the glass. You may have to dump in a teaspoon of olive oil to knock the head off this thing. There's a slight maltiness to the aroma, which is mostly dominated by floral hops. The initial taste isn't undelicious. There's a good caramel sweetness that fades into a chamomile-like hop flavor (I don't know another word for the columbus hop flavor). There is a good creamy body to this beer, but the bitter aftertaste is a bit harsh. Ultimately this bitterness leads me to switch to another beer after about two."
"Thanks Victory!"
"Pours a hazy gold with good lacy white head. Smells of (what else) hops, quite pungent. Taste is quite hoppy, but with a name like Hopdevil, I assumed that I would be blown away by hoppy flavors, but I feel I have enjoyed more hoppy beers. Still, a fine brew overall, and a very good one to blend with almost any food. I would argue that in this respect, it is quite Pilsner-like. A fine sampling from Victory."
"HopDevil taught me to love and appreciate a good hoppy beer. This beer is amber in color with a strong hop bouquet. The head built quickly but faded back again nearly as fast. As with the nose, the taste of this brew is just the same, hoppy. This beer I can drink at any given time but may need to be in the mood to have a sixer. This is one of my favorite beers and next to Storm King it's my favorite from Victory. The labels from Victory are very distinct so they stand out. I've criticized them for being so plain but others I've spoken to on on this topic loves the labeling for that reason. My rating, What'sa Hop'inen Hot Stuff!"
"A beautiful amber pour with a small head. The nose was ripe with hoppiness. And i mean lots of hoppiness. There was a small fruitiness in the nose as well. The taste was also super hoppy which was great and balanced out nicely with my thai curry chicken. There was also a rich maltiness that gave this beer enormous backbone. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth and moderatley creamy. A great combination of hops, malt and light fruitiness gave this beer exceptional range. Fantastic. My favorite IPA around."
"Pours a beautiful amber with a hint of copper. Nice head that settles moderately, leaving a hint of lace. Smell is actually akin to Stone, with a beautifully balanced aroma of cascade hops over amber malt. Taste is not as much like stone. Cascade hops are even more prominent, yet at the same time this beer achieves an indescribable balance. Hops are overpowering all other flavors, but I have trouble setting the glass down. A wonderful brew, to be sure."
"The stuff goes down easy, fruity with a sharp, but not overpowering, tang to it. It is very smooth, the tangyness being the only thing that would prevent me from drinking a few. Oh, that and the pretty decent alchohol content. This a beer that can really sneak up on you, the sweetness and smoothness hiding the punch. That makes two of the Victory beers, and neither disappoints. Can't wait for next season's beer."
"Oh, yea ... Thanks to new member Hustlemuscle for the fresh brew."
"IPA doesn't get much better than this. One of my all time favorites. I find myself craving this more than any other beer when I'm thirsty for a pint. This gets my gold star and red pencilled ""great job!"" with a big circled A+."
"An amazing brew. A redish colour with a retaining head. Pleasant aroma, great choice late afternoon and before dinner as so tasty and inetresting on its own. A wake up call to the senses from the hops. Very popular with my mates. We all will have it again. Will tingle and numb the tongue. Was hoppy but mellower when had a year later on tap at Clark's Ale House."
"I am pretty impressed as I sit here tasting this lovely brew. I can see why it's a top 50 beer. Very nice."
"Notes: Good beer. This particular bottle may have been mistreated, or a bit old. The hops just didn't seem to have the punch that I remember. I'll chalk this one up to be reviewed again at a later date."
"The best hoppy beer I've had to date."
"Awww... A cute little hopdevil on the bottle. It's nice, and adds some fun to the seriousness of the beer. It pours a cloudy golden orange colour with a head that doesn't last at all. The smell- oh, the smell- it's like sticking your nose into a packet of hops when you homebrew. And that reminds me of the beauty of hops. I suppose I'll have to be a hopdevil worshipper for this one based solely on the smell. The taste is excellent, smooth and malty, and continuing to the bitterness of the hops while leaving a balanced, yet hoppily bitter, aftertaste in the mouth. It almost has citrusy overtones during the intense hop rush. I hadn't realized this was 6.7 ABV otherwise I'd have bought another for tonight. There's always tomorrow. With the grand rush of hops, I hoppily look forward to more intense IPA's."
"Even though I like my IPAs to be slanted a little more toward the hoppy end of the scale, this is a very good beer and is one that I'll buy whenever I have the opportunity. Love the HopDevil on the label."
"Nice color on this beer as it poured out a orange-goldish color with a head that quickly disappeared, but nice lacing all the way to the very end. Smell..whoa, they don't call it hopdevil ale for nothing. Tons of hops in the smell with some citrus which smells very refreshing. Taste was awesome. Hops attack your tongue then finishs off with some citrus at the end. Extremely refreshing. Finishes dry. This is a IPA done very well. Goes down smooth which leads to a high drinkability. I would recommend this beer for sure!"
"12 oz bottle with ""enjoy by Mar 11 04"" on the label. Pours a beautiful tangerine amber with a medium light beige head that quickly dissolves into a slick, with lacing all over the glass. The nose, ah yes, the nose. Plenty of hops here...pine, grapefruit, hay, spices, and some mountain meadow florals as well. Mouthfeel is chewy, and won't hardly let go. Thick and coating, with lots of bittering hops and medium carbonation. Hops dominate the flavor profile, but you can taste the malts underneath. This is one tasty IPA! Flavor just keeps improving toward room temperature, but it's all about the hops. Finishes dry and bitter, with a long and complex aftertaste. This is probably the best ""standard"" IPA I've ever tasted. Impressive ale!"
"Pours a beautiful amber nectar color with some reddish tints. small head developed with vigours pouring, produced nice lace. Very pleasnt hop aroma, oily, resiny, citrusy hops. Flavors was bitter as to be expected but along with pale malt on the back end. I felt a slightly gritty aftertaste, almost as if some gypsum was present. Decent beer but jus didn't have much balance for me to call great. I'd like to try it at the brewery to get a better idea of how it is fresh."
"The beer pours an amber color with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is of hops galore. It has a cross between citrousy and floral hops; a very pleasant odor. The taste is outstanding. It has a good balance of pale and crystal malts which give it a nice mild maltiness. There is a wide array of hop additions here which adds to the flavor and it's uniqueness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation; an outstanding beer for hop lovers. This is a great drinking beer with lots of hops."
"This one was hazy with a lovely raspberry-red orange hue. The aroma was resiny hops and more hops, I knew this would be the kind of IPA I would like. Tastes of extreme hops with orange and lime citrus notes...a bit astringent. Sounds a bit harsh but it is quite delicious. Its mouthfeel was the weakpoint, a medium body but a bit thin for me for the style. The crispness was pleasant though. Overall a really beautiful and yummy hoppy IPA that I like to keep in stock in my fridge."
"P.S. I had another one of these at cellar temp (my other samle was fridge temp). It definitely has an even stronger flavor, if that was possible. Definitely tastes more juicy and spicy. Try both,"
"Noses full of candied citrus-flavored Washington hops appear first, then, after tasting, they produce a tarry, resinny bitterness equivalent to licorice or charred pine sap. Heady, perfumy, sweaty hop aromatics define the experience from the nostrils up. There's texture here, but, despite its grand scale and breadth, it is one that remains powdery in its slate/iron bitterness. One version of a far-too ubiquitous style I'm sorry to report."
"Flavor is sharp and resinous with a pleasant approach of hops that is balanced with a medium weight body that tastes like a good handful of biscuit malt and lends a large residual sweetness that is swept back off the tongue by a carbonation enhanced hop. Finish has a sharp acidic touch on the front of the tongue with a dollop of honey on the end of the tongue."
"Over time, this beer made my mouth dry. Maybe I'm not drinking enough :)"
"Poured out a clear amber to orange with a look of sweet tea, The moderate sized head settled down to a thin collar of bubbles that left a good amount of clingy lace. The aroma is fairly mild piney hops with citrus notes. Tasted sweet and crisp with a slick oily mouthfeel. The finish is dry with a more distinct hop aftertaste. Very tasty and drinkable, but not bold enough to justify the name HopDevil . Very nicely balcanced, and would serve as a great introduction to microbrews for someone perpetually sucking on macro swill. Thanks resirob for sending it down south as a part of the 2003 Holiday beer exchange. If I could get this locally, I'd drink it fairly regularly."
"Thick and smooth and lightly carbonated."
"This is a wonderful brew. Out of the bottle, it poured a mellow honey color, with very little head. It receded into a patchy foam, and there was very little lace. The smell was that of hops burried beneath fruity aromas, almost grapee. There is a hint of pine and malt flavors in the smell also. The mouthfeel is smooth on the front of the tongue, but by the time it reaches the back of your throat it is very sharp. This brew truely plays on your palate. Feeling this go down my throat was one of my favorite parts of drinking it. The broad full flavor of hops is the first flavor that is recognizable after the mouthfeel wears off and the flavors take over. A taste mildly resembling pine sap is also present, probaly from the hops. A slight fruity undertone is there, reminiscent of that of the smell. The whole body of flavor mellows into a slighty burnt, woodsy aftertaste which persists long after the beer is done. This is one fine brew, especially when enjoyed in good company."
"Poured a cloudy copper color, with an almost nonexistent white head that dissipated in seconds, though a collar of foam remained. The smell is of robust, floral, spicy hops and sweet malts. The taste is of mildly swet malts and crisp, spicy hops that finish with a very dry character. The balance between the hops and the malt is nice, with the hops taking the dominant role, of course. Nice, oily, moderately creamy mouthfeel. This is a very enjoyable IPA, well balanced, and very drinkable. This would be very nice on a hot day. Right now, in cold Spokane, I am endeavoring to convince myself it is 80 degress with the help of this beer."
"Overall, probably my favorite IPA to date. If you're ever close to the Victory HQ, I suggest you take a detour and pick up a couple of bottles."
"SECOND BOTTLE: The odd thing was that this one (the definitely fresh one) looked less fresh than the first; it had almost no head. However, with this one I didn't get the sense that the hops had gone flat. It was just hoppy enough to be mildly satisfying in the way in which it played off the sandwich. Still bloody disappointing for a beer called ""Hop Devil", but... just sayin'."
"An unclouded deep amber to copper color as it mellows away in my glass, the head portly in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a beauteous light tan with the resultant lace a satin like sheet to cover the glass. The rich aroma of the hops, crisp and fresh with a sweet malt backing, what a treat for the senses, start is rich in malt, sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is peacefully acidic, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry as a desert bone aftertaste that takes the hops till the very last drop, one damn fine brewery, one double damn good beer."
"Drinkability: A super IPA."
"This poured a dark amber, good rocky head, but on further inspection appeared a bit cloudy. The hops hit my nose full on, biting, leafy and citrus. The hops dominate all over, especially on the back end where they linger above the gum line, on the back sides of the throat and inside the cheeks. Not much else going on here except the hops, no esters, no malts. I would prefer a bit more balance in my IPAs. A bit over the top on the IBUs. A really good beer for the times you want to be a hophead."
"Nice sticky aftertaste and quite drinkable for me but certainly not the stuff of legend and I can't believe this is a top 25 brew."
"It went well with the spicey chicken dish I had in between pints."
"This is definitely a hop assault. I'm the type of drinker who likes a good hops/malt balance. I knew going in this wasn't going to be this beer. However, there is a good malt flavor to this beer. The hops completely overwhelm the malt, despite the good malt flavor. I gave a little bonus to the smell rating because you can smell the hops. Probably the best named beer I've come across."
"It pours a rusty red, reminiscent of the cedar water of my beloved Jersey Pines. The aroma grabs the cilia of your nose, and innundates them with the very essence of the citrusy hops. Ah, but the taste, the flavor! The taste picks up where the aroma leaves off, with hops sliding about your palate, but then, as the flavor ebbs, the malt asserts itself a bit, letting you know there is indeed a balance in place. It's medium bodied, coating the mouth nicely, then slipping away, leaving you wanting the next mouthful. And a next one there will be, as many as one, two, three or more bottles might deliver. There can surely be no perfect beer, but this IPA fits right where it needs to be, yet kicks out all the character needed to be a true original in its arena."
"But somehow, it went down pretty easy for an IPA (I can't always get thru them so quickly). I barely tasted the alcohol, but 2 beers later I definitely felt the 6.7% ABV."
"I could just end this review with one word: yummy. It's that good. Reddish color with a nice head. The head has a great ""hoppy"" smell to it. The taste is hopy and malty combined into a devilish blend that conter balances each other. I find a creamy like texture to this beer. One of the best on tap."
"Some caramel & biscuit up front. Stinging & brash, orangey American hops. Very balanced, with an incredibly dry finish. The hops just linger on & on. The trout warms a bit. Smooth, but a little bit chewy at the same time."
"Cheers!"
"This is good in the bottle as well, but draft is better, smoother and more balanced."
"Wow. Tried this at my local pub, and was so blown away that I was forced to take a road trip to Downingtown to visit Pennsylvania's beer mecca. This is a hopheads dream. The taste is like a punch to the face, but still absolutely drinkable. I've had quite a few IPAs since but have yet to find one that measures up Victory's brew."
"Medium head, white that was mostly lasting. Slight hop aroma but I was not able to detect much more. Flavor had some surprises, with a slight aprocot and light grapefruit flavor. Sweet to start with a moderate hop flavor finish that was not too strong. Light to medium bodied ale with lively carbonation. Nice representation of the style not too over the top with hop flavor and some really nice tastes on the palate."
"The day before tasting the bottle for review, I had this cask at Mugs Ale house. I like the beer much better on draft; the lower carbonation smooths the flavors out substantially. Appearance: Reddish orange, clear, thin head, but fairly retentive. Aroma: very subdued due to low carbonation, but hops are apparent. Taste: Big hops, but malt is apparent, not as overpowered as in bottle. Mouthfeel is very smooth at low carbonation. Very drinkable."
"This is my first review, so go easy. I don't know all the ""catch phrases"" and I don't know how to put into words the particulars just yet, but I'm learning and I love good beer."
"HopDevil pours with a small light tan head that only gets to about a half an inch at the most and reduces to a thin lace. The color is dark amber, almost copper. As expected (and hoped for) theres a big hop aroma of juicy citrus notes. The aroma isnt quite as biting and grapefruity as some other big IPAs, and it seems a little sweeter from some caramel malts. The body and carbonation are medium. Theres a good malt backbone that starts a little sweet. This brew is very well balanced, and the hops are never overbearing. However, the hops are a little harsher the some other IPAs. This really isnt much of a problem though. Theres a citric bitterness in the finish that lingers for a bit. Very drinkable IPA that I enjoyed immensely. Ive been typically purchasing beers by singles. The flaw in this method is that whenever I try a great brew I dont have anymore to follow."
"The american IPA has finally reached the pinnacle of its evolution, and its name is Hopdevil. This was my second encounter with the Hopdevil, having visited the brewery in 2001. It was even better than I remembered. A blast of citrusy american hops assaults one upon opening the bottle - definitely some Cascade, and I wouldn't be surprised if some Centennial was lurking in there as well. It pours a dark golden brown with a rich white head. The flavor is the perfect union of sharp hops and crisp maltiness. Naturally, it is out of balance and strongly weighted towards the hops, but the hops do not suppress the other complex flavors in the beer. Any idiot can fill a brew kettle to the top with hops and call it an IPA, but the skill of the brewer is revealed by brewing a beer that satisfies the hopheads and still has loads of malt character. In my opinion, this is one of the top five craft brews that I have tasted."
"Wow!is this ever a powerfully hopped IPA!!!. It pours an orange-tinged amber/copper with a nice offsetting trim of beige head. A big whiff of fresh floral hop is noticed upon opening. The lightly sweet caramel malt has a toasty background flavor. Big white grapefruit bitterness leaps out as fresh under-ripe oranges and a lightly metallic tang add dimension and snap to the overall hop theme. A mild herbal quality ever so slightly tempers the sharp edginess of this brew, making it high drinkable despite its high alpha- acid content."
" Drinkability, let's just say they could park my barstool next to the beer engine and I would pour this one all night. Get your ass to Sunset, even if you hate the place, because I don't know of anywhere else in boston to get this amazing beer..I'm getting thirsty just typing about it.."
"Update – I thought I’d revisit my review 10 years later. The incredible mouthfeel stands out to me again. It is so smooth it just disappears from the glass. This one will never grow old."
"This was a pretty good brew. Not my favorite, but pretty good, none the less. It had a nice orange color pushing a well lacing head. The smell was that of flowers. I don't know why, that's what I got. A hoppy taste, but at the same time it was very malty. Kind of its own contradiction. There was more than enough in it to balance things out. It was a good beer. I like it."
"hop battle waging with the ultimate winner being your tastebuds. I don't think I've had a more balanced IPA. Very drinkable, highly recommended and certainly worth seeking out."
"Pours a nice orange / amber color, with a thick head. The floral nose is extremely prevelant, with hints of sweetness. Extremely well balanced, the malt and hops dance together on the tongue, producing a crisp bitterness that slowly fades after swallowing. The glass develops nice lacework as the liquid is emptied. Extremely smooth and drinkable. The consistancy of this product over the past few years has been incredible, and this is an IPA others should try to emulate."
"This one takes no prisioners and is crafted to damn near perfection. HopDevil is very drinkable and a first rate representation of the style."
"Orange gold color. Medium head. Aroma is floral hops and slight malts. A medium bodied IPA. It's also fairly malty for an IPA. Yet the malt sweetness is balanced by the nicely spicy hops. This is not one of those in-your-face West Coast IPA, yet it's still retains that nice IPA character. A very nice smooth balance between the malts and hops. Nice IPA, very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I found HopDevil to be a pleasant surprise. While distinctly hoppy, Victory did a nice job of keeping things from getting totally out of control. While IPA's may not be my favorite style, HopDevil certainly is a fine contribution. A well crafted beer I'd actually like to get again, preferably on tap if I can find it."
"A creamy head covers the dark amber color of this brew. It smells strong of hops and tastes the same. A bitter brew but not as much as other IPAs. This American IPA is probably one of the best I tasted. It is pretty awesome and my favorite Victory brew. 6.7% is a good amount of alcohol and will surely be enjoyable."
"This beer has a creamy beige head, that helps to show off a nice deep amber color. An aroma of floral hops. Hoppy tasting with notes of lychee, definitely American hops in this one. There is loads of hop flavor in this one, along with a pleasing bitterness. This beer was not as bitter as I was expecting, but it is very well balanced with a subdued maltiness."
"Drinkability: Great session beer, not so hopped out as to preclude an extended session. Glad this sucker is relatively local and brewed year round."
"Really sticky. Caramelly malts. Sweet hoppyness, with a dry hoppy finish??? piney lychee hops (and, yes, sticky), sharp and unbalanced hoppyness, i can't believe how boring it ended up being, considering the amount of flavour in it. Lots of flavour though, pretty tasty."
"This is one smooth IPA! In general I'm not a huge fan of the style. I find most-especially domestic IPA's to be simply too overdone. This offering however is real easy to like. From the moment the beer hits the glass it impresses. deep burnt orange/copper in color, the beer sports a mouth wateringly attractive creamy,beige head. Aromas while certainly hoppy are balanced nicely by an almost sweet, malty biscuit component. Flavors are as well hoppy, yet again the bitterness is counterbalanced by a toasty, delicious roasted, maltiness. Especially nice is this beers mouthfeel-lovely, round, full bodied, and very creamy in texture. This is a stand out beverage even for those who don't go crazy for the style. By the way, the finish on this beer lasts a good solid minute!!!"
"Very appropriately named beer. An amazing offering if you love hops. I'm slowly coming around."
"I think this is my favorite way to enjoy HopDevil. I had it up at Zeno's in State College, PA. The lack of carbonation makes this particular devil particularly smooth and definately TOO easy to imbibe. Excellent hoppy beer. Lots of american hops, citrusy etc. But the malt profile of this beer is also remarkable. A very complex malt flavor that adds to this beers overall pleasantness."
"Comments: This is my kind of IPA. I love Hops, and the Devil delivers! I wish they brewed this stuff when I lived in Philly. Thankfully, its findable out here in Oregon. I plan to keep a few bottles in my stash."
"Pair it with some savory food -- preferably something greasy. You won't be disappointed."
"Had to review again to once again be in amazement of this beer. It is so straightforward and simply put together, yet produces an amazing array of tastes and textures. No sugars or spices, no special fermentations, just excellent rich malts flavored with the whole flower hops. Sometimes this beer comes on like an IPA, sometimes like an Alt, with a little bit of Stout thrown in for good measure. At about a buck a beer from most PA distributors, this most reviewed of beers proves that even though it is not number 1, you give up nothing for being the most popular."
"I tried the Hopdevil on draft tonight, after having had it bottled before; I must say it's quite different on draft. Color is a nice deep orange, with a little tan head. The hop aroma didn't seem quite as aggressive as the bottled version, but is very present, along with a nice malt and bready balance. Blended into the aroma are hints of pine and citrus, but well subdued. Taste is very hoppy, but not unbalanced, reasonably sweet with a hint of oak and piney goodness. The malt is more noticeable than the bottled version as well, making the draft a well rounded brew. Goes down very smooth with a sweet, slight hop-bittterness left on the back of the tongue."
"This beer came highly recommended and it is definantly a good brew! It poured a dark copper color with a good slightly off white head that left a good lace down to the end of the glass. The smell was of hops, spice, and a hint of grapefruit I believe. The taste was not as dry as I was expecting, but it was still excelent. The hops hit in the very beginning but then they were taken over by the wonderful spicy taste. Very unique. The mouthfeel was very smoothe and the beer went down very nicely. Although I do not think this stands up to the likes of the Stone IPA, this is a very very good beer."
"I like this beer, but it is not for someone who does not embrace the hop loving culture of these big beers. I will buy this one again!"
"Thanks Jarod!"
"I went to the horse's mouth for this one. Straight from the tap at the brewery. Its just a great IPA, nothing fancy, nothing too crazy. It looks like an IPA, light in color and citrusy in smell. It is very crisp and has a bit of a bite on your tongue. What it isn't is one of those watery IPA's that is lacking the hopitude to make it true. Its great from a bottle as well. My advice is to go to the brewery and get a growler, they have the old fashioned metal handle ones!!"
"Can't complain to much about drikability or mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate, and helps to keep from feeling as though the mouth has been coated in hop oil. The higher alcohol means that this isn't to be fooled with, but it can be consumed enjoyably in quantity."
"I shared the bottle with my brother-in-law from Kazakhstan. He'd never had an IPA before, nor anything else that could even remotely be described as hoppy. His comment: ""this is what beer should taste like."" Amen."
"On a personal note, I would prefer a bit more bitterness. The spiciness is good but i prefer a bit more citrus flavor to round it out."
"On tap this beer is hoppier then out of the bottle. Copper with a creamy white head that smells earthy and hoppy. Tastes initially extremely hoppy but as it flows across your tongue you get nice kick of malt goodness. Hops are the overwhelming flavor with a slight warmth from the alcohol in your stomach but its barely noticeable. Nice thirst quencher and is also highly drinkable do to its unique but not overwhelming flavor."
"It feels great and there is a smooth drinkability to this one. It goes down real easy. I want to try this from a cask some day. I bet it is just out of this world."
"This is a very refreshing, wonderfully hopped beer, with a great malt base and piles of flavor and interest. It's a great beer for nearly any occasion or mood, and enough amazing taste and character to come back to again and again."
"Color is full of warm tones. Orange, red, copper hues shift in the light. Breakfast assortment of aromas. Honey, grapefruit, citrus, herbal tea. Honey-sweet malt backbone gets slapped aside quickly by an overwhelmingly bitter hop presence. This beer represents the bitter equivalent of some of the more extremely sour Belgian brews. Pleasingly, this brew's immense hop presence doesn't completely destroy its subtle aromas. A little too far out there on the hop spectrum to really be considered exceedingly drinkable."
"A very nice beer."
"Overall impression - This just goes to show you the huge difference cask conditioning can make in a beer. This beer was young and ALIVE. Fantastic."
"ng"
"A fine ale indeed from Victory. This one pours a combo Golden/amber/orange color with an almost 1 finger deep silky head. A very pleasing brew to the eye. Smell is nice also: hoppy (of course), fruity....citric? Taste is very hoppy as well, with a blend of fruit, a nice combination of flavor. Mouthfeel is very soothing for an ale, it is pleasant on the palate. A very drinkable beer, I want another...and another....and another!!"
"Cascades juice? Not quite, but not far away. Big malt backbone carried the hops load quite well. My first impression was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on steroids. The hops flirt with harsh acidity, but manage to pull back just enough. Certainly a top-flight APA."
"The malty hoppy IPA that keeps you begging for more. Not being a hophead this is actually an ale that I can drink a full glass of without tossing. The amber/copper color as well as the floral head and nose make for a stunning bouquet. Taste is well balanced and very enjoyable.. especially if you love hops."
"Great amber color and a full one inch head with staying power that lasted most of the glass. Spicy hops with small hints of citrus in the aroma. The taste was excellent, I haven't had many IPA's but if this represents the style, wow. Bitter but perfect as it goes down, slightly malty with the hops coming on strong about 90% of the way through the drink. Very drinkable, I will have this again and hopefully soon!"
"Originally sampled many moons ago. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a world class IPA. In my humble opinion, it is in the same class as Stone's IPA and Kalamazoo Bells Two Heart. It's appearance is a copper body w/ an offwhite head. The nose and flavor are those wonderful citrusy hops. Great brew"
"This brew is a pretty sanguine amber color with a medium and clingy off-white head. Nice lacing throughout. Aroma is heady floral hops. Medium-bodied and crisp with a near-perfect level of hops in the flavor. There is a hint of citrus (lemon/grapefruit) and grass as well. The finish falls off just a little toward the end but overall this is a very good beer."
"Thanks to Victory for enlightening me to the hoppy truth; hoppiness doesn't have to mean bitter and nasty."
"Overall an excellent IPA on tap for the hop head. Malty, medium bodied, and hoppy to perfection."
"Like the Pils, a very cool label. It pours a much deeper color - rich amber, and it foams like a wild beer might. The smell obvious; nice and fresh. The darker color is correct in suggesting this is a bigger beer than most IPAs in the malt department. Its got a meaty, rusty flavor very reminicsent of olde style Bitters, almost of an ESB, but a much more pronounced hop flavor. Its a very nice beer, though its vitals make it somewhat difficult to drink another. After finishing, there's almost the same resiny feeling I get after sampling my wort. Sweet and filling."
"Notes: Consumed this after a dark lager and had a good time. Mustard recommends this beer, but cannot support the notion that this is a top twenty-five brew. Good times."
"Wow, what a great brew. The aroma is excellent, and with the first pour i noticed the head had a lot of staying power for an ipa. As expected, the hops hit and they hit hard. The mouthfeel however was a little thinner than expected, but still good. It left a very interesting grapefuit aftertaste in my mouth. All in all a very very drinkable beer, make sure to wait a few between your first and second ones so that you can appriciate it more."
"Deep red, mahogeny hue, nice thin, but well retaining head. Massive, sticky lacing, floral hops and fresh flowers noted on the nose, a very clean, inviting aroma. A blast of invigorating hops, some spices and an immediate warming effect, esters noted, although in the background. Some grapefruit noted throughout, medium to full bodied, extremely dry and some bitterness noted towards the finish. Clearly a top shelf IPA."
"Pours a deep red/golden, almost mahogany color with a nice foamy light tan head. Very inviting looking beer, especially during the pour with a tornado of golden carbonation. Smell is florally hoppy right away, then some good citrous hop notes come through and some malt is back there too. This beer has a zingy floral hop flavor throughout, but the nice buttery-bready maltiness in the background sets this brew apart from other IPA's.Very crisp and drinkable despite a relatively thick consistency. The bitterness destroys any syrupy mouthfeel that may have lingered otherwise. A good american IPA that lives up to it's name. Pretty much what an IPA should be IMO"
"What a fantastic brew! The beer is a amber (maybe orangish) color, with a quick-dissapating head. The aroma is fantastic. The hops are strong. Fairly good whiff of grapefruit/citrus to it. The taste is equally good. The hops are VERY strong, but there is an exquisite balance to them. They aren't strong for the sake of being strong. Decent amount of body to the beer. I had this with a friend the other night, and his initial reaction was ""WOW""."
"The Victory HopDevil is truly one of the American classics of IPA, and is surely one that I would have around in the future!"
"12oz bottle to be enjoyed by Oct 08 03. Pours a beautiful dark copper with a perfect fluffy white head. Aroma is spicy hops, but with nice toasty malt notes, too. Very full bodied, this IPA delivers the hops. Sniff, hops. Taste, hops. Burp, hops. Just the way I like it. Spicy, bitter, citrus, all the good stuff. Finish is dry hops with a nice sticky sweet malt balance. Slightly reserved at the finish, which is a good thing because it doesn't send me into a hop-induced coma. Victory has managed to take an IPA, hop it to hell and back and still manage to produce a well balanced brew."
"Wow! Some IPAs just bite you and are sometimes hard to swallow. This offering has an excellent amber appearance that leaves a clinging lace all the way down the glass. Smell is floral and not overpowering. The taste has a floral quality that is absolute perfection, just enough to add to the character, but not overpowering. The mouthfeeel is outstanding. It goes down easy and leaves a reminder of its hopping in a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. Suprisingly, this brew is very drinakable, even though the ABV is up there. Of all the IPAs I've tried, by far the best."
" Is it good? YES!! Is it one of the best IPA ever?? Not quite, but it sure is in my top 5 list."
"This was an extra cask that was put on the bar at the Firkinteeth event at the Grey Lodge. Good thing, too since it was fairly early and there were only two casks left out of the original eleven! This version of Hop Devil poured out a murky amber copper color and was topped with a small creamy white head. Beautiful aroma of flowery hops and a nice maltiness. Taste was very creamy. Nice bitterness with the presence of alcohol. Perfect blend once again of malt and hops. Very flavorful. I have had this beer many times in different forms over the years and this was another excellent version."
"A nice beer to go with saly or spicy foods and a nice beer to finish off a long day at work."
"Somewhat dark copper in color with a reasonably sized cream colored head. The aroma is of very fresh hops--citrus, pine, and spicy. Taste is initially malty but very quickly changes to powerful (but not overwhelming) hops."
"Bottoml line: if you like hops and malt (as a BA should), you'll like this beer."
"Not one of the best IPA's I've had and certainly nothing compared to some of the California IPA's. Poured a amber/copper color with very small head. Head dissipates quickly to almost nothing. Aroma is nice but more like an APA than an IPA. Smooth on the palate and slightly crisp. Flavor is a good balance but in my opinion just an average IPA. Also bottle could use a make-over."
"Edit: After reviewing another sample, I found that I like this far more than what I scored for. The first bottle might have been a little off. The second time I had it, it was more true to the name and style, very nice."
"Translucent amber-bronze hue, modest off-white head (less than a ½ inch), fair retention, soapy, minimal unorganized lace. Mouthwatering nose oh, the invitation is incredible, plenty of piney/citrusy hops plenty of depth but little complexity though. The palate has plenty of piney hops, prickly bitterness, raw citrusy hops undercurrents, leafy, dry. Very minor caramel malt hints, just enough for balance. The impact of the alcohol on the palate (and mind) is ideal. Tremendously dry & bitter finish, rather long too. Moderate carbonation. Medium body. It is awfully damn easy to drink and gratifying too. I wish HopDevil was available locally recommended!"
"this is a really exellent tasting IPA. it's loaded with grassy citrusy hops, but it also is rounded out with some nice caramel malt flavor and a little bready yeast, not hugely complex, but well balanced and great tasting. thicker side of medium bodied with middle of the road carbonation. i could drink this stuff all night. when fresh, this stuff is great."
"As you can probably tell, I am a huge fan. This merits the 5 x 5 as indicated above. I really don't think that there is much room for improvement on this one."
"Overall: there are other beers i would go to for a hop-fix... yet this beer impresses."
"Yet another excellent offering from Victory."
"The color is drop dead gorgeous.... the taste is out of this world.... if I could walk around with this beer in my mouth all day long I would be the happiest man alive, who needs to eat and talk anyway."
"A refreshing, light, and effervescent IPA, the hopdevil is great for one of those warm late sping evenings. I can almost hear the birds chirping as I pour this dark caramel (with a russet tint) brew. The head disappeared quickly, and I noticed not much lace as it receded. The smell is of rolling hills of hops with a hint of the citrus groves wafting in on a light breeze from over the hill. There's noticeable carbonation, but for this kind of day, it's perfect (I just came in from a five-mile walk). This stuff goes down fast, or maybe it's late May and I'm just plain ready for summer."
"Updated my review to reflect my comparative experiences since my first review, which was my very first review as a BA (originally a 4.95!). It does have a great malty presence on draft, with a very smooth hop profile as well. This is much better on tap, as the bottles develop a bit of a harshness and do not compare to Two Hearted or Stone IPA bottles. Still a very fine beer though that is a regular in my house."
"Another rare treat thanks to trbeer's trek to Chicago. I've been curious ever since seeing this one up on the BA charts. Pours copper in color. Smell reminds me of a barley wine. Some caramel and hops aroma. Taste is a surprise. Very malty and subdued hops. I was expecting an all out hops assault. Usually the extreme beers make the list but this one is more balanced. The bitterness doesn't even kick in until 1/3 of the way through the glass. Again more defined by the malty aspects of the beer. A nice beer but I think I prefer the grapefruit of Bell's Two Hearted. Call me provincial 'cause I'm from Michigan. Still a nice beer and I'm greatful for the opportunity to try. Now if I only can get Storm King Stout!"
"Pours an attractive clear, dark copper with a creamy tan head that remains in a thin cap, leaving nice lacing. The nose is alluring and complex: an earthy mixture of wood, smoke, burnt sugar, spicy, leafy hops, melted butter(?), fruit (orange, lemon, raisins, apricots, grapefruit?). On palate, a combination of complexity and balance that is exceptional. On the one hand, earthy flavors of nutty, roasted, smoky malt, buttery toffee, and caramel. At the same time, spicy, leafy, cedary hop bitterness and fruit--grapefruit, lemon, orange. Finish is long, dry, and fruity. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with just a touch of carbonation. A surpsisingly drinkable brew to have such a big, spicy hop presence. Very rounded-out and deeply earthy. One of the very best American ales. Victory is perhaps the best brewery in the country."
"This IPA pours a dark mahogany red. The tan head develops nicely and gives away to a thin lace. The aroma is all hops; hints of citrus and pine float in the air. Nothing overpowering but enough for the name Hop Devil The taste is very nice, again HOPS! However, there is a nice mild sweetness just before the bitter hop finish. This is very enjoyable to drink. There are more than enough hops to enjoy but not enough to burn out the taste buds. For me, this is a very drinkable IPA. I will look forward for the other 5 in my fridge! No wonder it is in the top 50!"
"pours a crystal clear orange-tinted scarlet brown with a sizeable creamy off-white head, which does a spectacular job of staying around and coating the glass with sheets of lace. spicy, fresh hop oil in the nose that can be detected a foot from the face. sturdy medium body made crisp by ample carbonation. sipping this brew as it warms reveals a spicy crystal malt notes in perfect harmony with an assertive, fresh whole-flower hop flavor. ample bitterness never seems astringent. a dissertation in balance, the extreme flavors of this brew are crafted in complex harmony. the finish is long and bitterly flavorful. subtle nuances emerge as the beer warms and becomes considerably more rich. ipa's don't come much more balanced, flavorful, or drinkable than this one. absolutely stellar."
"Pours a red copper color with a foamy tan head which clings to the side of the glass as it dissipates, leaving some nice lacing. The deep reddish color makes for a very attractive beer in the glass. Both the aroma and taste are as expected, given the beers name---strongly of hops. The very hoppy taste lingers in the mouth and shifts somewhat into a more spicy aftertaste on the tongue. Medium to full bodied, this beer has very good mouthfeel and goes down quite smoothly. An overall very good beer which I will certainly drink more of."
"I immediately smelled burnt caramel, like charred smores. My favorite kind. I also noted some hints of citrus, namely lemon, which must have been the hops kicking in. At first taste, it was fresh and crisp. Then I was almost chewing on the malt, even though there was no sediment whatsoever. Finally, just the right amount of tongue-scooting bitterness finished the palate. There were, however, a few sour notes every few sips. This IPA was delicious, drinkable to the last drop and will be hard to beat."
"I was fortunate enough to acquire a six pack of this brew from a friend. The beer pours a nice amber color with a medium white head. The smell of the hops is very noticeable, and very inviting. Upon first sip the mouth is overwhelmed by the exploding taste of hops and light sweet malt, which is very pleasing. Once the hops fade, the mouth is left with a spicy flavor. Overall this is one excellent brew, very refreshing and a pleasure to drink; unfortunately I cannot get it where I live. Regardless, this goes on my list of favorites."
"First of the Victory line I have tried and I came away very impressed.Now Iam not a hop-head but this beer has a nice balance to the hoppiness.Poured a real nice rich copper color with a pillowey head,the aroma of hops hits ya from almost a foot away.Taste is herbal hoppy with a nice nutty malt background.Had this at a pub in Blue Bell not far from my new place."
"i had this at the Connecticut real ale festival and it was wonderful a stand out among standouts a true historically correct IPA with great body mouth feel and balance.hop heads and malt freaks alike will love this one. if you can find it on cask its a must!!!"
"Finish is dry, and I could feel some sort of malt behind it all. A little nutty and burnt taste in there, too. And with a watery mouthfeel this all amounts to a fairly refreshing and mostly balanced IPA, but just a little too earthy for me though."
"Beautiful, perfect head. The beer was a reddish copper color. Smelled peppery, but not enough there. Hoppy, too, of course. Tasted very smooth, hoppy, and a teeny tiny bit bitter. Excellent beer."
"Finally did gets me some of the 'Devil. Right up the side of the head! Whew, Baby, this be the real thing. Hop nose just a waftin' on up there, that great clear amber flittin' its tail 'neath a creamy 2 fingers of ivory. The lace she be dropping in, but sliding on down to the body again. Oooo Man. Creamy full body caresses the palate and wakes it with citrusy flavors and flowery accents. Tried to sip; no luck. This be gulpin' good beer. Two thumbs up for the 'Devil."
"This is an excellent and very drinkable beer. If you like hops I highly recommend it."
"Barrelhouse Brewfest sample #8. I like the coppery color on this one. It has a BIG orange, hoppy aroma. I figured it to be a blast of bitterness, but it really wasn't just all about the hop. I found the malt and hop balance to be most excellent. I'll need to find some more of this. I've heard it's even better on tap."
"Happy Drinking"
"Pours a dark reddish amber color with a massive foamy white head that coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of lace as it recedes into a creamy lace. Nose is dominated by spicy and floral hops with some additional notes of pine oil. Medium to full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel due to all the hop oils. Taste starts off with strong raw hop leaf flavors followed by some notes of sweet malts and a juicy fruitiness followed yet again by strong bitter hop resins and tannins. A marvelous IPA. Thanks to paceyourself for the sample!"
"pat"
"This is certainly a favorite in this area and was a favorite of mine even before I moved here. Amber color with a head that never seems to diminish. Hops are very noticable in the aroma and the taste. A nice malt character is present, but lets face it, this is a hop-head's beer. This is the type of beer that I'd like to stock up on and always have on-hand."
"Cheers"
"Pours a nice orangish kind of color with a nice white head sitting on top. Excellent hop aroma, which of course is expected. Flavor is balance and a nice amount of hopiness and enough maltiness to back things up. Not as in your face as I expected but a great beer none the less. I'd recommend to anybody that likes hops."
"The Devil made me do it too."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium dark yellowish red color with a medium light tan head. The mouthfeel is firm soft and rounded. The smell is sweetish herbal and piney. The taste is very mild malt heading to a herbal hoppiness. Perhaps I got an older bottle. The hops weren't nearly as pronounced as I expected, not over the top and it seemed pretty mild for an IPA."
"Aroma is, of course, flowers and hops. A thick tan head with a mixture of large and small bubbles and great, tenacious lacing. Color is copper-orange, darker perhaps than the usual IPA. Taste is slightly chewy, a wonderful hops snap that is spicy without being distracting, with a backbone of malt. The hops and malt have a wonderful intercourse in this beer -- can I say intercourse? Because the two ingredients love each other, and I love being there with them. Sweet and sour are perfectly mixed. A delight."
"thanks to frank4sail for the devilish sample."
"Nice hazy orange with dark golden tones, thin foamy head that really lasts for awhile fades to a thin haze and thick ring. Fresh dried floral hops and fruity aroma with an awesome grainy, toasted bakery-like back. This had a really complex aroma with lots of floral hop, some citrus, spice, & grassy grain, super fresh, yum. Tastes like it smells, fresh dried floral hops, with some citrus & spice notes and sneaky bitter, grassy notes as well. But not enough to ruin the solid hop crispy drying finish. Feel has a somewhat creamy medium body and airy dry. This is a solid IPA with great balanced hop bite and toasty malt backbone that tasted very fresh and is very drinkable."
"Orangish-amber color with a tan head. Leaves good lacing. The aroma is spicy, hoppy, and with a bit of caramel malt aroma. The flavor starting out is of sweet malt, which flows to a spicy, bitter hop finish. Not a bad medium-bodied beer. Not over the top with the hops. I would definitely sample this brew again."
"pours a hazy copper colour with a fairly thin but lasting head. hints of citrus and spice in the smell along with what seemed to be a bread-type smell as well. taste echoes the smell with hints of salt as well. it's definitely a hoppy brew, but the hops are not overbearing. i'm normally not a big fan of ipa's and therefore wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as i did, but i really dug this beer. alot. another solid offering from victory."
"This IPA poured a clear reddish-amber with a tan foamy head that is retained throughout consumption. The wonderful aroma consists of floral hops, citrus, malt and spice. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and has a creamy texture. HopDevil exhibits the perfect hop balance. Bitter yet not too salty. Excellent biscuity finish that was and unexpected delight. Touch of citrus also. HopDevil is not overly complex, but just a really good IPA. It's one of the best I've ever sampled."
"This IPA poured a hazy, reddish amber color with a creamy, light tan foam that left very nice lace on the glass. The smell came blasting from the bottle the minute the cap was popped: a beautiful, fragrant, floral hop aroma! Some citrus, biscuit, malt, and a hint of spice also in the smell. The taste was almost completely hops (bitter and floral) with only a bit of malt, which is overwhelmed. The mouthfeel was crisp, but slightly chalky. Full bodied, lively carbonation, with a lingering hop flavor. The drinkability was good."
"Pours an nviting golden color, with a white and long lingering head. Noticeably hoppy smell of citrus and pine, followed by a very strong hop flavor that rolls over the entire tongue from front to back. This is a great beer, with a tremendous and intense hop flavor."
"Great IPA. Will return to this one again and again."
"This beer is truly incredible. The hops are so well balanced even though there are way more than the average IPA. This ale has quite a smooth taste and is very mellow despite its extreme hop characteristics. The nose is very hoppy but the malts sneak through as well as some citrus hints. The taste is very clean but it has a little bite. The head is not too strong but it leaves quite a nice foamy lacing on the glass. There seems to be a slight hint of apple in the middle of the beer. There is substantial carbonation throughout the beer. The malts come out at the finish line making this orange/red ale quite a find."
"Backwash: As this is practically a local brew and readily available year-round at a relatively low price, it is virtually untouchable for value. A great all-around beer."
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"Clear amber color, medium tan head which dissipates to a nice clingy lace. Aroma is hoppy, citrus & pine aplenty, with a mild maltyness in the background. Initial light malt sweetness gets clobbered by a hops bitterness that lingers on. A hop lovers dream, although it is still a fairly well-balanced brew."
"Being a fan of pale ales I was very excited to taste this for the first time and Victory did not disappoint. With a smooth pour and a foggy amber color with a bubbly off-white head I was ready to go. the smell had a nice fruity, floral sensation with a definite hop quality. The first sip was everything I was expecting. A rich, full body witha complex array of hops and citrus flavors with a mellow dry aftertaste. This warmed me up on a less than warm night, but I could also drink 4 or 5 of these on a hot summer day. No matter what you like this is a keeper. Cheers!"
"If you like your ale on the hoppy side, you can't go wrong with Hop Devil. It's as good as any out there, and better than most...and I swore by Harpoon for years!"
"-Oelergud"
"Thank you Victory."
"If I was going looking for a BIG IPA I would grab this one again"
"The glass fills with a burnt amber colored beer, the color you'd expect Diablo's pool to be, of course topped with a thick,smoky,earthy,slightly sweet smelling foam.What could be bubbling up from those depths?This evil beverage base is a firm malt sweetness,with a little smoke and butteryness on the tongue. Then the snakes of hop hell apear and cover the ground knee high. If Diablo had any sense, he sure would have one of these in his hand as he welcomes you to his lair.Welcome to hell Mr Bitterbeerfaceman, welcome. A nice Ipa with medium body and a balanced if not understated hoppiness."
"I'm pretty impressed with this IPA, but it probably won't be a repeat purchase of mine since I'm not a hop lover."
"Light copper color, some haziness. Fine, off-white head that is retained for quite a while. Strong, sweet, citrusy hop aroma. Flavor also dominated by hops with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Medium body balances hop flavor nicely. Carbonation level is just right with the bubbles making a nice tingle on the tongue that is good with the spicy hoppiness. A good beer if you're in the mood for lots of hops."
"An off white head rests atop the burnt orange brew. Aroma is of floral hops (no surprise there!) Taste is of course hoppy too, but the malts do come into play as well. A hoppy burp sends the malts back into retreat. This beer is the perfect compliment to the chips & salsa and hopefully a great warm up for the 90 minute IPA I'll be enjoying for the Superbowl. Finishes slightly sweet and spicy. Thanks to aaronh for this awesome hopfest!"
"Golden amber, a white head that doesn't really hang around to talk. Some lacing, but not exceptional. Smell betrays west coast hops with flowery scents, but some spice hangs in there too. Taste is similar, with the spicy hop character winning out over the perfumey flavours (I don't like my beers overloaded with that). You all know what people think of this beer, I'll just add that it's almost lives up to the hype. Which is to say that this is a very good beer."
"I finally broke down and bought a six. (due to the cost) It was about 3 weeks under the best before date. This beer poured a nice clear amber, head retention was very good and lacing was plentiful. Nice piney hop aroma but more understated than some west coast IPA's. Taste was hoppy and a bit peppery I want to say as the beer had a spicey kick to it. Still it was a bit smoother than most West Coaster's, I thought it very nice and drinkable. Glad I tried it, but due to the cost it won't be a staple."
"Beautiful amber color. I got a nice thick head with mine. The head was a cream color and lasted a while. After a while though, it thinned out, but it was still evident. The taste was stouty at first, mixed with some fruit, and even a little spicey. After I held it in my mouth for a few seconds, it lost it's bite and became low key. Finished off smooth and left a little bit of a peppery aftertaste. Verdict: I could drink it all day and watch football."
"Pours a clear light brown tea color with a massive 2 finger off-white head. The pungent aroma of strong citrusy hop is dominant with nothing else being able to poke through. A strong flavor of the citrus hops and a light earthy malt taste and very light spicesbut barely shining through. It has a light to medium body and finishes with a very dry hop. Very boldvery good! Thanks to Rotsaruch for sending this to me. Cheers!"
"Great golden amber color. Lazy bubbles and moderate head. Quick and intense hop burst, with rich bitterness that clings to mouth and continues through to the aftertaste. Good herbal bouquet, slightly fruity. This one makes you pucker!!"
"The pour revealed great head retention with generous amounts of foamy white lace.It had a smell of hops with a bitter touch.The smell also had a ""copper"" smell to it.It had a full body with a dark cherry red color.Very silky and smooth with a good mouthfeel.The finish was very dry with a long bitter grapefruity aftertaste.The overall taste didnt impress me.Other than the appearance I dont see what all the hype is about.Way too bitter needs more balance.This beer is way to overrated! I would not buy or drink this again."
"Pours a slightly orange copper, with a persistent white head that leaves rings of lace. Aroma is very fruity... orange rind, grapefruit, carmel... with some floral notes. Flavor begins with some caramel, and finishes with a somewhat acidic grapefruit... and a fair amount of bitterness... although it's nicely balanced by the malt. Somewhat prickly with a medium body. I can see why this one is highly regarded! A great beer for the hophead."
"As a Hop-Head : I will be buying more of this offering that's for sure, for I am sure I will definitely not be going to Heaven."
"Deep copper, amber in color, with a thinnish, smooth off white head. Decent lace down the glass. Nose is hoppy and citric. Flavor starts off caramel sweet, with a strong, fairly rough hop flavor throughout. Hops lend a good blend of citric and floral flavors to the brew, with spicy and acidic notes present throughout. Well-carbonated, but fairly creamy in body, with a medium-light mouthfeel and a dry finish. Nice hop aftertaste. Overall a good IPA, though I probably wouldn't rank it top #10. Seems a bit one dimensional compared to, say, Stone's Ruination."
"Hoptopia for the hop heads."
"Pours a light amber color, slightly hazy, with an off-white foamy head, that turns into a thin layer, and laves nice lace. Aroma is all hops, floral and citrus. Medium bodied with a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Taste is very much like the aroma. Lots of hop flavor, citrus, grapefruit, and floral tastes. Malt is somewhere in the backround. Different hop flavors along with the toasted malt in the backround make this a nice balance of flavor, and not a shocking hop bitterness. Finishes slightly bitter with some spiciness. A very good IPA. Sit back and enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Good. Some American Pale Ales knock you over with hops...this one has just as much as the next one, but in a beautiful balance with the malt flavors."
"Not a huge hop fan as of yet, but slowly becoming one. This beer poured into the glass a bright amber/copper color. There were slight bubbles as you peered into the glass. The head seemed quiet thick and white. The lace clinged to the sides dragging the whole way down. The aroma was dominated by the hops. There were hints of citrus and sweet malt as well. The taste was big. Much like the aroma the hoppy taste was present. But through the hops you notice slight fruit like grapefruit. You also notice hints of a toasted malt. A good beer, a bit strong if you are just starting to review hoppy beers, but I would come back, and try more."
"Bright copper color, nice thick head, clings to the glass. Aroma of citrus and pine resin. This IPA is very balanced malty with a great hop bite, I like to keep a supply of this awesome brew."
"Beautiful clear copper color, with a big white head that a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is all citrusy grapefruit hops with just a bit of a dry grass to it. The flavor is very nice lots of grapefruity hop citrus up front, some husk flavors and the slightest toasty malt hiding in the background. Clean crisp drying hop finish. Slick smooth mouthfeel with a mild carbonation makes this a very drinkable beer that leaves you wanting another. Thanks to NeroFiddled for providing this as part of a beer trade."
"After properly aquiring a taste for this beer, I needed to re-review this. It's like, the BOMB baby! I can't really do it justice by writing about it but I'm doing it anyway. It's very hopppy and bold. The hops quite obviously dominate, but a subtle yet noticeable spicy-sweetness is also pretty big on ye olde palate. It took me a few of these to realize how great it was,and your macro drinking ass may need to develop a taste for this as well. Impeccably brewed and unbelievably delicious, HopDevil is the beer you should be drinking."
"Copper, amberish color with a light tan head.  Huge grapefruity citrus hop aroma !  Hop flavors are very high with an assertive hop bitterness.  Medium bodied (leans light) and smooth.  I tasted little malt character but this beer was not overly bitter to me since the hop character is so citrusy pleasant."
"   The taste at cask temperature seemed softer and more sophisticated. The hops were still featured but with more nuance and complexity. The firm malt background folded into the rounded citric character of the hops moreso than the bottled version. It was definitely like drinking a different beer with both being outstanding. The bottle version is an in your face hophead's delight while the cask was it's more profound cousin."
"A hopheads delight!  Poured a very dark coppery color with a nice head and decent lace as you drank it.  Definant hoppy aroma but not overly so, just right IMO.  Had a great but powerful hoppy taste but also smoothed out on the tongue with a nice malt taste.  I would drink this beer over and over again...............CHEERS"
"Adding to the review eight months later: I have bought this beer several times since my original review, and I continue to find it a good change of pace. It is a very full beer, you have to pay attention when you drink it, but it's worth the attention."
"Wow! The hops just explode on the palate. Lovely reddish brown color. Nice creamy head but doesn't last long. Leaves a decent lace. I love the pungent hoppy aroma and the faint citrusy notes. Exceptional finish, you get a nice hop burn long after the last sip has gone down. One of the 5 best American Pale Ales I have ever had. Oddly, it's not that easy to find in neighboring Ohio. I hope I can track down Victory's other offerings."
"Originally, I did not want to review this ale, as everyone before me has done an excellent job. But with a screen name like mine, I thought I must. Cloudy, amber color, which in my opinion is the true color of beer. The head is white, frothy and lasts throughout the pint. The lace rings a perfectly spaced layer until the bottom. Your first smell is pure heaven, as there is no better aroma then that of hops. Strong but not overwhealming. The taste is so well balanced you don't know which comes first, though I know it's the hops. Nice malt taste is there, mellow, bringing up the rear as it were, again balancing the hops. Don't let the name fool you, it's hoppy, but not to the point where you are scraping your tongue. Absolutely one of my favorite beers, and a standard in the fridge all year, especially in the summer."
"Its hard for me to give a perfect rating, but this beer really does have it all.  Its a rollercoaster ride for your tastebuds.  Victory does not over hop this IPA to make a name for themselves, (ex. 90minuteIPA or Ruination) they just made the perfect beer."
"The appearance is amber with a nice head and lacing.  The beers smells sweet with hops and a hint of the malt.  The initial taste is strong with the hops, but the overall beer takes away most of the shock.  Although I am a hophead and it may shock people who do not enjoy strong hops flavor.  The taste, as I said, is hoppy, but some sweet additions seem to tone it down.  The beer is very drinkable and I was glad I was in Philly this weekend to try it."
"Not for the faint of heart or macro-drinker, this brew is great for good-beer-lovers that want a little edge and have a thing for layered tastes of hops."
"5KD"
"I just finished a sixer of this brew, and I liked it more as each bottle went down. I like hoppy beers, but not really to the point where I consider myself a hophead.  At first the hops are a little shocking (even though you have to expect them from a beer called HopDevil), but once you get over the initial pop this turns out to be a fairly balanced beer. This is exactly what a great beer should be: Interesting flavor that has such depth that you discover something new each time you try it. And keeps you looking forward to the next one."
"This is an excellent IPA..right up there with, but not better than,  Bell's Two Hearted  Ale....It pours a rich, deep copper with a litte white lace..the nose is a wondefull mix of floral and spicy hops...the taste is bitter grapefruit style hops along with some decent malt to balance...I'd love to see the bittering units on this as it is very high I'm sure...but at the same time it is relatively balanced....Definitely west coast style..some great hop flavor to this....a very good/borderline great IPA...I love this Brewery...they rock!!!"
"Absolutely beautiful, full rich copper-red color. Nice head that stuck around through most of the glass. Nose is not as hoppy as I expected from an American IPA, let alone one called Hop Devil. There is a significant sweet malty note on the nose as well. Beautifully integrated on the palate - impeccable balance. The bitterness is more prominent on the palate than on the nose and contributes significantly to a very long finish. Disappears quickly. Top notch American IPA. A touch more hop on the nose, and it would seriously challenge Bell's Two-Hearted Ale as my favorite within the style."
"I'd like to try one of Nero's cask conditioned versions."
"It's amazing what cask conditioning can do! I'll assume everyone is familiar with the standard Hop Devil (if not, check out the standard reviews first). The color remains the same, but the head holds to the end of the glass and gives a solid wall of lace. The cask version also has a much lighter nose - I guess that's mainly because the limited carbonation brings it up less. Smooth hop & malt aroma. It has a light silky mouthfeel. The flavor expresses a soft malt of light, sweet biscuity caramel, and a more balanced grassy hop flavor and bitterness. So English! A totally different beer! You wouldn't think the bottled version could do this. Similar, in many ways, to Young's Dirty Dick. I'm sure that the standard draft or bottled version would stand up to some spicy fries, but the cask version gets a little lost. Absolutely worth trying. No wonder it did so well at the 2002 GBBF!"
"Transparent copper with a sticky cream-hued head. Nice retention and even better lacing. Nose inludes notes of sappy pine, citrus and some residual malt sweetness. Taste is abundantly hoppy with characteristic notes of mild grapefruit and pine needles backed by a substantial, sweet caramel malt profile. Smooth mouthfeel and excellent balance with an emphasis on hops make this an enjoyable, highly drinkable IPA. West Coast style from a great East Coast brewery. Great stuff."
"Deep copper / red in hue w/ a moderate, sticky, head that leaves sparse lace.  Buttery malt, caramel, toffee sweetness & biscuit notes are accompanied by a pungent citrusy and floral hop nose.  Overall the aroma is a nice balance of malt notes & aromatic hops.  Flavorwise the balance is striking-- The malt profile is quite rich & is comprised of nutty, caramelly, and fruity melaniodins only acheivable by continental malt.  Malt is balanced by assertive, but clean hop bitterness.  HopDevil is a big and flavorful IPA and not nearly as bitter as the name woud imply.  Hop flavor is citrusy and herbal.  Full bodied for style.  Finishes w/ bittersweet residual sweetness & hop bitterness.  Quite a rich IPA-- beautifully heavy with malt character.  Very tasty."
"Well I finally got to try this.  The supply of Victory's recently dried up in Columbus.  But my favorite beer supplier came through.  This beer poured a lovely reddish copper color and formed a nice off white head that left some nice lace.  The aroma was of malt and citrus-grapefruit.  The flavor was of malt, caramel and hops.  The finish is sweet and astrigent.  Also the alcohol makes it's presence known in the finish.  A great beer.  Now the big decision, which do I get at the store, Victory's or Stones?  Definately different characters which makes the decision even harder.  Definiately worth the wait and harassing I gave my stores."
"A bit dryer and crisper than on-tap, the clarity is a shade clearer but still hazy with a frothy sticky head. Quite aromatic with lots of semi-coarse hop, lightly toasted grain alcoholic esters. The flavour is a mirror image of the aroma with lots of hops in the bitterness and flavour. I prefer it on draft though, probably because I usually drink it our of a 32oz mug at Bukowskis Tavern."
"Nice reddish amber color.  Virtually no head, minimal carbonation.  Nice balance of malt ands hops.  I think I would have liked a bit more carbonation, this particular pouring seemed almost flat to me.  Still tasted delicious though."
"Overrated, to be sure, and completely off-balance, but still worth drinking. With a name like HopDevil you should know exactly what you are getting into. What is surprising is the generous malt profile this beer contains. A real caramel sweetness with hints of butter, nuts, honey, molasses, provides the sturdy foundation for this beer. But of course this is all to make room for the insane hop element, although I drank Victory's Prima Pils before this and was thrown off by the amount of hops in that beer. Only in that context can this one seem tempered. Otherwise, you'd damn well better be in the mood for hops. (You could say the same about Prima Pils, which I found out of whack for the style.) Delectable, sticky on the tongue, with lasting lingering floral & spicy notes. Drinkability low due to unbalanced hop element. Not my fav and certainly not worthy of its overwhelming acclaim, but when a beer is this degree of quality, why should I complain?"
"Gorgeous copper body. Nice rocky off white head. Disipates too soon. Very good lacing. Fine (as in very small) carbonation rising. Aroma of floral hops is intense at arm's length. Bittering hops come through nose up close, with strong dose of citric.  Strong malt presence balances hops until delightful hop tingle in aftertaste.  Taste is so good it is actually difficult to keep from chugging the entire glass.  Victory has several remarkable beers, but if this was their only product, they would still be an outstanding brewery."
"Pours a bright copper color with a good sized rocky head that fades a little too quickly but leaves a great lace.  Smell is tons of floral hops, bitter hop oil, and hop leaves with some sweet malt in the background.  Very floral and slightly citrusy hops own this beer making it very bitter and hoppy.  For all the hops though there is just enough smooth maltiness for this to remain well balanced.  The malt combines with the hops to produce an almost fruity taste at times.  The brew is fairly creamy from the malt but is nicely crisp and refreshing at the same time and it is extremely drinkable as well.  This is one great brew and yet another amazing one from the boys in Downington."
"I feel bless and cursed in living so close to Victory - less than 15 minutes away. As usual quality is exceptional with all their brews, but this weekend the finest balance, smoothest drinking HopDevil was available on the hand pump. The hops were there with fruity flavor and delicious bouquet and malty finish. It was considered desert after a great round of golf."
"After I have developed a love for IPAs, this one has to be sampled again."
"Love the hops! Looked good, poured nicely and the first taste was great - nice and dry. But it had a funny finish - a little too fruity for our taste. But for a bottled IPA, not too bad."
"""Would you like some malt to go with those hops?"""
"Hop Devil: cask conditioned: thick dense head, very long lasting.  Deep reddish color, with slight Belgian lace.  The cellar temperature really brings out the hops, but also lets the undercurrent of malt sweetness to present itself, especially in the aftertaste. Excellent taste, presentation and beer."
"One of my favorites. Great tasting and well balance of hop's and malt's. It has the right balance of sweetness/bitterness. This would be a great beer to introduce to your friends. For the price, very good friends. It was well balanced in a sweet/tartness that I liked. A very complex beer with loads of fruit and flavor!"
"About as good as an IPA gets!  Not too strong on the alcohol that it takes away from the ale, but a couple of these will do for a night.  Victory is a solid brewery."
"I wonder if it is this good in the bottle?"
"This is THE ultimate session brew. As a hophead, I am in love with this beer. I like the Wallop more overall, but I could drink these for the rest of eternity. The hops are combined perfectly with everything else in this tasty brew. So well balanced. Crisp maltiness, fruity, hoppy, yeah. Smooth initially, and finishes with some killer hops at the end. Looks very nice...a cloudy amber, almost orange. Not the best tasting beer I've ever had, but arguably the best overall beer there is."
"I do not consider myself a hop man at all, but this brew was a very pleasant experience.  The beer is orange, almost amber in color with a very hoppy nose.  While very hoppy and bitter, the beer still had some nice malt sweetness to it which was a pleasant surprise.  Fairly complex IMO and I enjoyed every sip.  A great beer indeed."
"I had to try this beer due to it's massive following in BA.  I do love hops, so I knew I would love this beer.  Almost like a red beer, hops beyond belief that never seemed to let up at any time.  However, it was very easy to drink.  I was not dissapointed."
"Just tried my first Hop Devil and, boy, was I impressed.  These guys really know what they're doing and they are a hopheads dream come true.  Incredible hop aromas and flavour...enough to satifsy even the most virulent hopead."
"A big thanks to pbrian for sending this my way!"
"If you were to graph the flavor profile of this beer, it'd be a straight line - no switchover between hoppiness and maltiness, bitterness and sweetness. It retains its predominantly floral hop flavor throughout at about the same degree of hop-malt balance.  A very nice American IPA."
"5/6/02: I have to admit that this beer surprised me. I'm usually kind of iffy on IPAs and other hoppy beers, but I really liked this one. The aroma is very floral/perfumy. The taste is definitely hoppy, but not so bitter as to overwhelm the rest of the flavors in the beer. My fiancee described it as like drinking perfume, and it did have a powerful floral quality to it. I really enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure if I could drink more than one or two in a sitting."
"Sierra who? I finally got my hands on a sixer of Hop Devil and will be going back for more. The hops are definitely there, but they're not overwhelming. The color and head are more or less typical for an IPA, but the taste is really remarkable. I only wish more places on the west coast stocked it. I'm an instant fan."
"Holy Hops! Wonderful beer. After a few, I need to change to something else (the hops are very intense!!!), but the first two or three are amazing."
"Forcefully hoppy, but very well balanced.  As often as I've had this beer, it always seems to suprise me.  I've seen this beer convert many friends into hop-heads.  Simply wonderful!"
"Pours a deep copper color with a slight head. Nice pungent/oily/flowery mix in the aroma. This is a decent brew. Pretty solid caramel malt backing. Good hop flavor, but again, I'd prefer more bitterness. Easy drinking for an IPA. There's no signature taste here that really stands out. This is another IPA that everybody else seems to die for and I just think it is plain good, but not great."
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"Clear ruby red amber, great color. Head is small with a trace of of thin foam after 40 seconds, upwelling occasional bubbles. Citrusy sweet aroma. Very nice hop bite, grapefruit including some bitter rind flavors. Malts are clearly in the background. Hops are pronounced but not overbearing, settles to a mild bitterness at the back of the mouth with just a touch of sweetness. Refreshing. Probably my favorite American I.P.A. to date."
"The hop devil lives up to the hype. Nice red-amber color, darker than I expected. Very big hoppy nose. Nice easy taste, lingered on the tongue.Big spice flavor, florals, hops, is there cinnamon in there ? It sure tasted like it to me.  Strong bitterness at the end wakes you up and demands another taste. A proven winner and worth the wait. I have been trying to get it in Florida for a while."
"The quintessential IPA in my book. Heavy hops create a very spicy, qrapefuity beer. If I had one in hand I could review better, but being at work right now... I have to say the only IPA I've had which I could say for sure was better than HopDevil is cask conditioned hopdevil. The cask conditioning seems to mellow out the hops a decent amount by taking a tiny bit of the bite off, without compromising that awesome spiciness. Works even better at celler temps when cask conditioned than when poured from a bottle."
"Ya know how redheads are either ""hot as hell"" or well ya know a ""train wreck"". Well this is one ""hot"" devil. Bright bubbles, hypnotic in its bitterness. The aftertaste has addictive overtones of flowers, perfume, and a high heel against the backside. God I love the Devil out of this beauty.  Sorry about the description, but this is a top ten beer on the wish list.."
"A very good...and it does live up to it's name HopDevil. Amber color is darker then SN-pale ale, with a bit more bite on the mouth. Very hoppy indeed! The malt is very nice too, its sweetness balancing the hop bitterness. A bit of warming in the belly in the finish. Defines the true American style IPA! Cheers!"
"41"
"This is my favorite IPA. I think the brewmasters at Victory describe it best, and I quote: ""Bold, spicy and menacingly delicious, this American-hopped India Pale Ale offers an aromatic punch and then follows through with a lasting, full-bodied finish."" Agreed."
"Grinning ear-to-ear now that my local carries this.  I was expecting an overpowering glass of hops and got a beautifully balanced big IPA.  Compares to a SN Celabration but softer with less bite.  $7.99/six is gonna set me back some cash over time."
"Notes: This is a very hyped-up beer, and it should be as it is an absolutely marvelous beer for all the hop-heads out there, albeit very daunting for those who are not into hops to the extreme. For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection. A ""Wow!"" beer for sure. 6.7 % abv."
"Beautiful orange color. Overwhelmingly fresh, spicy citrus flavor. Medium bodied caramel malts. Clean finish."
"HopDevil is without question, in the top five of the American IPA catagory. Probably in the top ten best beers of any kind. Excellent."
"This is a wonderful beer!!!!  Like all Victory brews this leaves a mark, you never wonder who makes it.  A keeper."
