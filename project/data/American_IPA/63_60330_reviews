"It pours just a shade lighter (and pinker) than copper, with light tan, sudsy head, leaving huge pillows of lace behind. Grapefruit and fainter orange citrus aromas at the fore, masking still-detectable caramel. Taste is not as fruity as either the aromas or the description would let on, but still more so than your average IPA. Much more piney and resinous on the palate, but bitterness is subdued at first, and citrus, as well as mango and rind still come into play. Sweet fruity character dissipates as it lingers, but hop bitterness doesn't really set in motion until the drink has been washed down your gullet for several seconds, giving your tongue time to aerate and warm. By then, it's almost like gagging on a metal spoon, but in a good way. A smooth, easy-drinking beverage with medium body and medium carbonation."
""
""
"Overall, a pleasant spring/summer IPA. More fruit-forward than some of your other IPA's, but not a bad thing. I missed the bitterness on this one, but otherwise very satisfying."
"Flavorful IPA;  noticable but pleasant aftertaste. Was not a huge fan of the other beverages I had consumed from this brewer, but this is a thumbs up!"
""
""
""
"Honey/amber color pour into an ipa glass with a very foamy 1"" tall off white colored head.    Settles to a constant froth layer on top with quite a bit of lacing going on as well.  Smells of pine, grass, and citrus with a grapefruit/tangerine combo must up front.  Taste is of grapefuit, melon, grass, and pine.  Pretty heavy medium bodied brew with some hop bitterness  on the palate but balanced just right.  I found that even with some pretty high ratings already I think Fresh Squeezed lived up to my expectations.  Overall, an easy to drink ipa that is well balanced, flavorful, and yet pretty complex."

""
""
"O: This is another really good IPA from Deschutes. I certainly have no problem with it."
"Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is good.  I cant really say anything bad about this ipa, but I also cant really say anything astounding about it either."

"Overall impression:  A very citrus forward American IPA.  I was surprised at the malt presence and darker color that gives it more of an ""East Coast"" slant.  Overall, well done and enjoyable."

"Fresh Squeeze was the best beer on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a big, fruity beer that must be consumed fresh. The bottle has a best by date. Look at it. If the bottle is out of date, put it back on the shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I have to say, I just don't get it. Hard to find any hop smell or taste. Bad bottle? Not sure but I have 5 more bottles to finish and I am not that eager to dive into them. A decent beer but SO MANY better options. I would take NWPA or Chasin Freshies anyday over this."

"O - Solid Citra IPA from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
"Amber color, a little darker than a typical IPA, very clear.  Nice citrus smell.  Tastes are citrus with a strong hops presence.  Mild carbonation which covers the whole mouth.  Overall a nice IPA."
""
""
"Color is an unusually amber color for in IPA. Aroma is strong citrus, almost too strong. Taste is more relaxed than aroma. Citrus is definitely there as in the aroma, with a tad bit of caramel in the background. Body is good. This is a beer that could grow on me. I liked it, wasn't overly impressed, but think it presents a good combination of solid body and smoothness that could make it a good session."
""
""
"Easily in the top five best IPAs I've ever had. It's almost like drinking a citrusy soda, just because the hops isn't overly assaulting. It has that nice Pacific Northwest IPA feel and taste to it. It's a great beer too because it's only 6.4% ABV so the alcohol astringency isn't overpowering to the senses and one can still pick up the subtle flavors as well as the abundant citrus notes. Definitely a must-have beer. Perfect for a hot spring or summer day."
""
"Best IPA I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright orange-gold color with good head. Smells very fruity and tropical. Taste reflects that with a little bit of malt under all of the fruity hop flavors. Overall a really yummy IPA, a lot fruitier than most I have drank recently."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy & dry with a little bit of citrus but not too much & not sweet at all. Very dry & refreshing. Really good."
"Yum!  Nice scents waft away from the moderately dark amber beer with a small, lasting head.  Light hoppy bite shows the IPA aspects of it, but it is easy to drink and definitely one to repeat."
""
""
""
""
"O. Greatly enjoyed from bottle in large snifter, last weekend of Banter in Denton. Great strong flavorful citrus IPA."
""
"Smells really fruity , but doesn't taste very fruity"
"This is a really wonderful IPA that I want very much to find more of."
"Mouthfeel:  Relatively dry dissipating finish, refreshing."
"If you like your IPAs to be not so hoppy, but with still good taste, this is a good place to go."
""
""
"Overall- A well named, big flavored IPA. Not quite at good as this brewery's Inversion IPA which is a few notches higher IMO. Interesting color to this beer as well. Packs a hop punch indeed."
""
"Overall, a really good IPA with an exceptional finish. I do think it could use a bit more of a substantial malt backbone to support all those hops. It's not unbalanced or overly bitter, just kind of a ``small'' beer for all that hop flavor. It's like a tiny car with a huge motor in it that threatens to push the car so hard it spins completely out of control. If there's an imperial version of this with a beefed-up malt bill, I want it!!!"
""
""
"Best by 06/2015  and it is almost April. The one bottle I got had to be way past its prime. Almost no hop aroma or taste. Tasted just like an amber ale. I am sure this beer is much better fresh but not the one I got."
"A fruity, wonderful IPA!  Plenty of citra and mosaic hops with enough malt to give balance and smoothness. Very enjoyable!"
""
"A good beer for someone who isn't a fan of bitter IPAs. Light and citrusy, slightly hoppy but balanced nicely with the fruit flavors. It has a non-bitter and pleasant finish."
"Another tasty offering from Deschutes... I am not surprised. I don't love this as much as Inversion, but my only actual complaint is that it's ultimately too sweet. The nose on this is borderline absurd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Foggy amber with a thick, slowly receding head that settles to a milky layer.  Interesting fruity hop aroma...peach, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, lime, and mango mixed in with some grass and perfume-y floral notes.  Floral, fruity hop flavor with lingering oily resins on a bed of fresh grain.  Creamy melon, stone fruit, and berries.  Plush medium body.  Fruity, as expected - fruitier than I tend to prefer actually, but undoubtedly well-crafted."
""
""
""
""
"Very well balanced IPA. Smooth finish."
"The best blend of citrus hops in any IPA ever. The perfect beer for a hot summer day, this IPA might be the most drinkable beer on planet earth."
""
""
"Love the aroma of fresh grapefruit.  Lush hop oils coat the tongue from beginning to end."
""
""
"Excellent flavor with the expected citrusy and pine aromas which screams IPA!"
"While not a big whammo of hops or stunning, it's a great fun beer and I like the amber character to this which is sort of more supportive but giving much to the flavor.  Another Deschutes winner for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its too sweet in my opinion"
"3/21/15 (Bottle) - Dark copper pour, nice pillowy white head, little carbonation. Good hops aroma with, citrus also noticeable. Excellent hops taste, nice contrast with the fruits more noticeable via taste than smellof citrus and grapefruit. Good texture, feels good and strong going down. Very good beer."
"O- Pretty good, not as good as I was hoping it would be, but it's solid. I think its current ratings seem to be benefitting from the fact that it's been around a while. I honestly think it's on the sweeter side for me and would like it to be drier than it is."
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a fairly clear, copper color. Head is frothy, concave and off-white. Lots of lace. Nose is not as intense as I was hoping. It's a fresh bottle, too. Hops are juicy. It sorta smells like a hop medley instead of any specific scents. Sweet citrus, some spicy hops and band aid. Some grassy aromas, too. It doesn't scream Citra and Mosaic hops. A bit of peach hop. I enjoy the flavor more. Actually far more balanced than the name leads me to believe. Candied citrus, hops with some spicy hops, more sweet/fruity hops, some pine and a notable amount of sugary, cara-bread malt. Finishes with medium bitterness. Moderate carbonation. Was expecting something a bit different. Still decent. Bonus points for effectively creating the ""fresh/juice"" naming technique that many breweries have imitated with their hoppy beers."
""
""
""
""
"Pour from tap nice dark golden color. Slight hoppy flavor with a grapefruit after taste."
""
"One of my favorite IPA's"
""
"Fresh off the teet...tastes like Hawaiian punch!  In a good way."
""
""
""
"This was a major disappointment for me.  Maybe I had a bottle with too much  (best by date in 6 weeks) age.  There was no distinct flavor....it was just meh."
"Perhaps my Platonic Ideal of an IPA..."
""
"Nice hops smell, and tastes crisp and hoppy, though not overly so. Hips are not overpowering, this could be a beginner's IPA. Not an IPA Id bend over backwards for, but quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Thought it had a little bit too much sweetness to it in addition to the citrus"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer! Good aroma and good taste. Must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one great IPA, its in the heavyweight category."
"The hop bitterness slightly overpowers the amazing hop citrus flavors I can taste right underneath."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"would get a growler!"
""
""
""
"O: A very nice IPA which I would definitely buy again if I could."
""
""
""
"Great beer. Exquisite aroma of citrus and hops (of course). Deep amber appearance. Average head. Great lacing. Flavor is what you'd hope for in a good IPA, citrus and floral. Very hoppy."
""
"The almost bland taste is a bit of a letdown after the fruity, pineapple smell. Still a solid beer, but much more mellow than what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall solid beer...hopsy but not over the top...malts and hops combine to make a nice mellow sweet hoppy beer...I recommend trying it to see what you think"
"One of the worst IPAs I've had in a long time...citra and mosaic? Where? It's all malt...no carbonation...sweet, not hoppy...don't let the hop bill trick you."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Great beer. I was actually pleasantly pleased, I highly recommend to Citra aficionados"
""
"Good smell, doesn't pour great, lots of fruity good taste but a little too much pine for my liking."
"Poured from a bottle into on ""IPA"" glass. Nice aroma and inch high head. I should have bought more than just one bottle."
""
"O: hops extracted artfully, perfectly balanced with subtle malts. Delicious beer that would appeal to anyone."
"This is a go-to IPA.  Easy to find, affordable, and fantastic."
""
""
""
"This is a wow beer.  Taste is pine, wood, meadow, and light toasted malt.  Bitter but never too bitter, but super flavorful.  One of the better IPAs I have had in a long time."
""
""
"Very easy drink.. Had it at my buddies strangers place in el Centro. Fruity sweet good beer.  Definitely try it agian."
""
"An unsatisfying pour with an orange, amber color and large carbonation bubbles. But the smell more than makes up for the less-than-inspiring look. The beer itself is quite good, though I will say my expectations were raised high based on other reviews and the hops mix. It is a very good beer, and I'd happily get it again, unless Founder's Mosaic Promise were also available."

"This was a simple, classic American IPA with big flavor and a satisfying albeit fleeting mouthfeel. It poured a clear, deep amber with little head or lacing to follow. The aroma is slight and of citrus - not enticingly floral as some of the better American IPAs. Fresh hops tease the tongue but rapidly yield to an imposing malty presence. Hops linger slightly albeit eclipsed by a piquant quality: the mouthfeel of a peppery tripel without the saccharine richness of that genre. It's a unique American IPA with merits which will appeal to fans of saisons, Belgians, and casual IPA fans alike, but maybe not ideal for the dedicated hop-head, whose preferences - in fairness - my biases probably reflect. It strikes me as ideal for pairing with fish."
""
"Absolutely wonderful American IPA! Loved the play between the full bodied malt backbone and the bright citrus and piney flavor of the hops!"
"Slightly less than a fingers worth of light khaki colored densely packed frothy goodness...  Limited retention gives way to a full veil of mostly full lacing...  The color is a slightly dull copper which is completely translucent...  Largely still with just a stray quickly paced carbonation bubble here and there...  The nose is rather pleasing...  Fresh hops...  Tropical fruit sweetness...  Kiwi...  Pineapple...  Oranges...  A light malt base of bready malts linger beneath the surface...  The palate is incredibly well balanced...  Alternating waves of hops and malt with neither ever really taking prominence...  The hops are citrusy and tropical with a touch of earthiness mixed in...  The malts are subtle and biscuity...  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Moderate carbonation...  Even and consistent...  Incredibly pleasant...  A really really good American IPA...  Nothing earth shattering but rock solid or better in all facets...  I'm a big fan of Deschutes and this one only helps their stature in my eyes...  A job very well done...  This will become something I drink with regularity in the future..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this regular and from a cask. Cask was 5 star. Regular was just as good just easier on the hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite mass-produced beer from Deschutes and can be found for a surprisingly good deal at some local Portland stores.  I don't think this ranks at the same level as some of the top-tier IPAs but it's more readily available and less expensive making it a really good 'go-to' choice."

"Excellent. One of the best IPAs out there imho."
""
""
"O-impressed with this. One of the best"
"This is a fantastic IPA that stands out in a high-level crowd of excellent IPAs wherever you look with northwest breweries.  Get it if you can, drink it while it's fresh, don't balk at its slightly higher-than-others price.  The tremendous aroma and flavor profile might not lend it to being the most food-friendly IPA.  Wash your dinner down with a more run-of-the-mill beer; savor this one on its own so you can appreciate a beer that was made the way beer was meant to be made."

"Great IPA.  Good mouthfeel and wonderful taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This didn't blow me away. I think the bottle I aquired might have not have been the best example as I picked up oxidation and it seemed like it had some age on it."
""
""
""
"Not much else to say that hasn't been written.  Awesome IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Amazing beer. Delivers the full flavor of the hops in a smooth feel without tongue peeling bitterness or astringency. Drinking it feels like you have seen the future of IPA's. My new staple."
""
"Beautiful orange body and a creamy white head.  Smells absolutely gorgeous.  I'm smelling a lot of peach.  I swear it smells different everytime...  Tastes so juicy and the bitterness is there, but it's not so overpowering that non-hopheads couldn't enjoy it.  Mouthfeel is very nice, maybe a bit thicker than most other IPAs.  This is a magical beer.  So glad I can reliably get six packs.  Even better when I can fill a massive growler of it. I love Fresh Squeezed."
"Well rounded & smooth, great IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber with an orange tint. Smells of sweet malts, tangerine and floral hops.  Tastes of citrus, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Med/light body with med carb. Sweet malts, caramel and floral hop aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Nice fruity hoppy aroma with a  taste that follows the nose..Tropical fruit juicy,nicely hopped and extremely smooth,overall very very good..I think I found another one to add to my top 10 list...An easy A"
""
"A well crafted offering which highlights the hops rather than sticking to the more malt-forward delivery I tend to associate with NW-style IPAs; that said, I think this beer is at its best when paired with the right cheese or other small plate. Compares well to Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale."
""
""
"Very drinkable for several pints in a row. Nice aftertaste and smooth finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice smooth slightly fruity middle range IPA. I prefer a little more hops an alcohol but that's why this is a single IPA. Best tasting single IPA I've ever had. If you haven't tried it you should :-)"
""
""
""
""
""
"An outstanding IPA...great lacing, enticing aroma and yes, it does taste very fresh. I would definitely recommend this beer for any IPA fan."
""
""
""
""
"Really don't care for IPAs, and as such wouldn't have tried this beer but for the brewery's facebook page. After conversation with someone at the brewery, I told them I don't like the flavor of pine, they suggested this beer. Said hoppy, but no pine. And there it is pine flavor."
""
""
""
"Note to Self: Ranked #53 on the list of American IPAs when I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Not the hop bomb I was expecting. Instead, a very balanced, flavorful, easy-drinking, accessible hop-forward IPA.  Very good."
""
""
""
""
"Amongst my favorite IPAs when fresh and on draft. I've been a bit underwhelmed by the bottled offering, but that's only in comparison to the excellent draft version. My rating may be inflated due to sheer happiness the first time I drank this, but it really is an excellent use of these juicy new hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"High citrus and low malt flavor.  It has an almost acidic quality."
""
""
""
"Overall: going into this brew I had somewhat high hopes and they were met, with a little beyond. West coast IPAs seem to be my go-to lately and it all seems to go well together. Explosion of hops, undertones of bready malts all come together makes this an enjoyable session beer. I would try again and would recommend to a friend. Cheers!"
""
""
"O-One of the best IPAs I have sampled to date and certainly an even tempered IPA with floral and citrus character that's exceptionally pleasing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark Amber with a slight lacing. Nice on the hops very smooth. Great job on this IPA."
"One finger foam on pour without much lacing. Reddish amber color with some carbonation. Nose is strong grapefruit with some bergamot and pine. Taste about the same. Mouthfeel just about the right gravity for an IPA with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Overall a very tasty, refreshing beer. Definitely a go to."
"I didn't know IPAs could be this smooth. Insane."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp taste, very nice aroma!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one tasty and refreshing beer. The hops showcased in here puts off wonderful aromas. Its very juicy, and appropriately named. This is world class as far as a regular IPA goes. I used to compare every beer with this hop character to LT Limbo but now ill be comparing them to Fresh Squeezed. As it warms i literally taste tropical, stone, and citrus fruits individually all at once. Highly recommended"
""
"One of the most refreshing IPA's right now"

""
"Girlfriend was not a fan, i found it juicy and delicious!"
""
""
"Another disappointment for me from Deschutes. This beer just has no middle and end mouth feel. Taste fades extremely fast. Watery."
""
"In my top 3 IPA beers right now. The others being Two Hearted Ale and Lagunitas probably."
""
"O- I was really excited to have this beer and it certainly met my expectations. Both the Citra and Mosaic hops are on full display. A really fruit forward IPA with a light bitterness that is very easy to drink. I look forward to buying bottles of this and would love to have it in my fridge all the time."
""
""
"I was a massive fan of Boulder Brewing's ""Mojo IPA"". This beer has actually almost topped it. Almost."
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a great hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Being more of a Belgian beer drinker, most IPA's don't please my palate. However, this Fresh Squeezed is DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of the super hoppiness that makes IPA's unique, but the taste of this beer is perfectly balanced. I will definitely be buying more of this from Deschutes; and perhaps my enthusiasm for IPA's will now grow."

"Great beer with a strong grapefruit front.  A little bit more carbonation than I prefer but still could rank in my top 10 beers right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love fresh hopped brews and nugget hops.  I just tried this at a local pizza shop and loved it.  Great blend of citra, mosaic and nugget hops.   Remarkably smooth - with much less of that dry bitter bite you often get with fresh hopped ales.  I think this is my new favorite beer."
""
"Very tasty one of my favorites from Deschutes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little more on the sickly sweet side then what im use to from an IPA. Kind of sticky on the lips. Has the viscosity of warm syrup, heavy in the mouth. Good frothy head. Citrus flavor is more orange than grapefruit but it still leaves that bitter dry rind afterteaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a winter offering, this is a refreshingly hoppy IPA.  We had it over the holidays, and the in-laws drank it up before any other beer was gone."
"Way too much wheat flavor and sweetness for an IPA. The hops are just barely there."
""
"Citra hops do I need to say more. The smell and taste is nothing but crisp and refreshing. Nicely done Deschutes."
"Overall this is just a good sessionable(?).... Great, balanced west coast IPA, which seems to be more elusive these days with the desire total hop bomb beers. I would pair this with more mediterranean food such as whole roasted fish and a mango salad/ chutney. I give it a 95.5 boardering 96. It would get higher if it had just a touch more hops.... The middle of the mouth just lacks that full punch. It's there but just not 100 percent ( more like 90 percent)."
""
"first time i had it i loved it.  overall now its gone down hill since it is year round"
""
""
"O: A wonderfully balanced IPA. Something I could enjoy time and time again, while recommending to others."
""
"O - This one is quite a trick.  A big hop bouquet, with fruits all over, but only a mild malt sweetness, and very little of the bitter turn I generally expect with such a fruit forward start.  If this were available through Indiana distribution, it would definitely enter my stable of regular IPA drinkers."
""
"This was clearly a bottle that was past it's prime, I'll give it another try at a later date when I find it again. and revisit my review."
""
"This is a really interesting ipa. Initial taste is slightly malty then the hops come rushing in then my tongue stings with the bitterness. It's alright"
""
""
"Deep copper, grapefruit and lemon lime citrus. Very palatable hop flavor, not overly bitter. Ruby red grapefruit juice. Citrus bomb IPA"
""
"A solid fresh hopped brew. Juicy and dank. I like other brews more but this brew I would never turn down. Solid."

"Perfect example of a citrus bomb IPA."

"Been looking for this forever... my son found it for me for Xmas. Poured from a 12 Oz into the Spiegelau. Deep, rich copper hue. Finger of egg-cream colored head. Nice lacing, all day long. Explosion of grapefruit, everything citrus, clean bitrerness, fantastic aromas. Grapefruit up front, super clean, balanced, right amount of bitterness, that hint of Mosaic, very hop forward, just a hint of biscuit. Medium mouthfeel, right on the $$$ for an IPA IMO! Clean is the name of the game! Lived up to my expectations and then some. Love Deschutes! Seek this out!"

"Very bitter like Fire Eagle IPA. Great color. Very nice aroma. Would definitely drink again."
""
"Bought a growler blind from the high review. Man was I disappointed. No hope, poor malt bill, unpleasant bitterness not from hops. Yuck. Terrible aroma, look is too dark. Does not taste like an IPA, tastes like a small brewery APA that is subpar. How disappointing. Hope that this growler maybe was just off, but it came from a very reliable source in DC."
""
"i didnt think this was that great when i first tried it. however, everything i bought after having this i kept comparing it to. nothing came close. seems i did love this brew more than i knew. now i had to get another case."

"A very interesting experience that this pure hoppy beer gives you. Imagine the early morning dew hanging of the green pine tree, the chilly fog has just lifted making way for a warm ray of light to shine upon your cool face. Have a pint of fresh grassy hops... It will highlight your day."
""
""
""
"This is not only a great IPA, but it's also the perfect gateway beer for those looking to tread into hoppier waters without the full blast of hops that some of Deschutes' other beers have. The perfect balance of hop bitterness and fruity sweetness. I myself have highly hoppy tastes, so this is on the milder end for me, but this beer never disappoints."

"Currently on tap at Whole Foods Sawmill. Fruity hops dominate the flavor paired with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It reminds me of a local pale ale from Seventh Son that features Mosaic hops."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours to a 1/3 finger of head that quickly dissipated.  Aromas of citrus and pine.  Very clean with little bite back.  Tastes of pine and citrus.  Clean after taste.  Very pleasant."

"Given the price this one's a ""no brainer""; and I think it might also appeal to people who wouldn't normally go for an IPA because it's not as brash as many can be. The bitterness remains, but the additional fruitiness makes it unique. Absolutely worth trying!"
"Nice citrusy tasting IPA. Hop level just right; not too much or too little."
""
""
"Overall: Like drinking liquid hop candy! Enough malt to keep it from being too bitter, enough hops to satisfy the craving."

"Great ipa! Very fruity freshness!"
"Amber color, light carbonation. Nice, fruity/citrus aroma. Off-white head that fades relatively quickly with good lacing. Good body/mouth feel. Citrus hops flavor matches the aroma, but it is well balanced by the malt presence. Not as bitter as expected for a west-coast IPA. The hops bitterness/citrus lingers in the aftertaste, but does not linger too long. I really like this one. More like a pale ale than a west coast style American IPA.  (I know; this might be the KOD for you hop heads...)"

"Poured a gorgeous semi-clear amber body with two fingers of fluffy off-white head. An excellent lookign IPA, very true to form. Scents of tropical fruit, with an overt presence of mango and pineapple, light grapefruit, light sweetly tart tangerine and orange, hints of pine resin, a nice presence of fruity esters of an indeterminate nature and light biscuity malt in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a very fruity IPA with a big hit of citrus and tropical fruit aromas and a little bit of malt. Very nice, bright and appealing. Flavor begins with medium-bitterness and a wonderful flavor of tropical fruit with notes of papaya and mango, juicy tangerine and bitter tangerine and orange peel. This moves into a middle with high bitterness and strong notes of grapefruit and tangerine peel, with a moderate presence of pine resin and medium-light tropical fruit and tangerine. Finish is dry with notes of grapefruit peel, pine resin, and indeterminate citrus peel. Aftertaste is pine resin, citrus peel and light grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a bright, fruity, citrus forward IPA that is wonderfully bitter and very well done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, creamy with a resinous finish and a medium-high carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a classic wonderful IPA that is quite easy to drink. Overall this is an excellent IPA with a bright, citrusy, fruity aroma and flavor that is quite appealing and a nice mouthfeel that is very eat to drink. A wonderful IPA."

"This is an awesome IPA with a lot of complexity. Wonderful aromas start the show, it's a bit floral with citrus, lemon, tangerine, orange blossom honey and pineapple. That complex nose carries through to the palate where I got a smorgasboard of fruit flavors: lemon, lime, orange, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango. It was light and easy drinking and poured a deep amber with a white head. Really pleased this is now offered year round as it's a fantastic IPA with a lot of depth. I think it's particularly well suited to summer, but great year round."

"It's my belief that if Deschutes were a smaller brewery, or if they released this in limited runs, then it would be one of the highest rated beers ever made. Thankfully they don't use Russian River or Three Floyds style tactics, because I love being able to easily get my hands on this."

"Grapefruit, mango, resin, and toasted caramel malt form the aroma. Flavor reveals a melange of tropical fruit at the base, with a solid toasted malt backbone and a resiny, moderately bitter finish. Pith lingers in the aftertaste. Well balanced beer, with nice fruity flavoring hops. Peach emerges as it warms. Not quite as much hop flavoring as I expected."

"O: I got this at Rimping Market in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Drank Oct 21st, 2014.  I think the shipment overseas took its toll on the freshness of this beer. The downside to having the word 'fresh' on a label means in 20 years the label will remain, in spite of the changes within.  Kind of toffee, malty like taste, with muted orange flavours.  Tastes good, just no longer fresh."

"Overall: I'm thinking this brew has become one of my favorite IPAs. The flavors are bright citric and tropical stone fruits. Even has a touch of tea like qualities. What grabs my attention the most is the balance of hops and residual sugars to make this like a hoppy soda. The smooth finish is also world class! I'm not going to kid, this brew is Recommended!"

"Deep copper orange in color with a heavy haze. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Bursting tropical grapefruit, pineapple and an unbelievably fresh orange and lemon zest aroma with a strong malty presence and hints of pine. Medium bodied with subtle, yet tangy carbonation through the middle. Fresh orange and lemon hop flavors up front followed grapefruit and pineapple into the middle. Tropical flavors transition briefly to a minty freshness and then to bitter pine hops at the end. Strong malty backbone throughout. Finished semi-dryly with a light lingering hop bitterness. An incredible display of hop aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a strong and vigorous tan head that is foamy. The beer itself is a clear dark amber with orange and slight brown notes. The beer smell has a very tropical note with hints of mango, light apple cider, and a bit of honey sweetness to take down the hoppiness a little bit. The beer taste is similar to the smell but with stronger notes than  and a bit more bitter and grapefruit hop note. The malt also comes out a little bit. The beer mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a medium body but on the heavier side with very light carbonation. Overall, a very good and tropical IPA. Totally worth drinking again."

"Gorgeous glowing orange/amber color with a billowing frothy head. Perfumed and floral nose with touches of pine, tea leaf, nut and lemongrass. The flavor starts with a straight shot of hop resin, floral hop components, lemongrass, honeycomb and tea leaf. There's a nutty caramel backbone and a bitter pine finish. Fairly light easy drinking IPA. I don't get a lot of the Citra, mostly Mosaic, and this is pretty fresh, so I can't give it much higher a score."

"Overall, this is my favorite straight IPA, certainly the best one available around here on a regular basis."
""
""

"The name of this brew fits perfectly.  Most tropical fruit forward beer I've ever had.  I really do like it but I think it needs a little more bitterness to tame the sweet juiciness.  Nonetheless, an awesome example of what craft brewers can do."

"O: Definitely worth trying especially if you like IPA's. It is a clean, yet satisfying"
""
""
"Dark orange with medium carbonation - smells very sweet, almost candy like - citra hops are super strong, explode on the tongue and leave a lasting bite - reminiscent of Clown Shoes' Space Cake DIPA - Beer gets better as it warms - not my style but solid"
""
""
""
""
"O: Another great reason that non-hopheads can enjoy IPA's. The balance is terrific. Recommended."
"Overall: Hops like a double IPA but very drinkable. Almost a everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am very impressed an IPA like this comes year-round now. This IPA does a great job of having the feel of a ""fresh hop"" IPA even if it isn't the season and there aren't fresh hops used in it. This is priced very reasonably where I am and its a great choice for someone wanting an IPA full of flavor without the alcohol bite of a DIPA"

"What a fantastic beer. This is what we all want. It's hard to describe something that is just about perfect. All I know is that when I open this bottle and pour it into my favorite glass I can barely enjoy the damn thing for drinking it too fast! What a beautiful thing that has happened to the beer industry when I am the beneficiary of so many microbreweries producing product like never before. If you dont feel lucky about that then you arent a true beer lover. And if you don't love this beer, you dont drink enough of it to know. The aroma is divine, the initial taste is hop and citrus heaven and you will probably make that face or roll your eyes...you know, when something is so good you look at someone and dont care at all how you seem because you know the truth. That's what this beer is...THE TRUTH! I would love to find another beer that comes as close as this one does to being the perfect beer (maybe Little Sumpin) and if I find it, I'll let you know. In the meantime, kiss anyone who gives you this beer right on the mouth like Lydia Loveless would."

"Bottle from a 6-pack poured into a shaker pint glass for the purpose of this review. Color is a fairly light orange-yellow with ample white head of intermediate persistence. I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this particular brew in Alberta and I will generally agree that the name is apt. This one is super juicy, with the nose and palate a veritable fruit bowl of citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime), blueberry (!), stone fruit (nectarines and cherries), blackberry, and tropical (pineapple, passion fruit). The malts are not terribly sweet and I might even be tasting a little grain, along with something more astringent in the fruit/medicinal realm (vitamin C tablet) and a nondescript sweetness that is perhaps somewhat odd ... Almost an artificial sweetner note which fortunately remains subtle. Apparently certain hops can yield this effect. Anyhow, there is also a little pine, mostly in the semi-dry finish. Despite the fruitiness there is a distinct impression of bitterness front to back. Interesting contrast that adds complexity. Alcohol discernable but appropriately so. All in all, this is a great Mosaic showcase, with some unique blueberry and strawberry flavors to complement the more typical Citra elements. Dare I say that it could be just a hair more malty? Anyhow, hope this sticks around these parts."

"O- this is perfect. I have to admit, it took me a few tries to warm up to this beer. Other times I drank this was on tap in shaker glasses at near freezing temp so all I got was bitterness from the hops. Now that I've had this at proper temp in proper glassware I think it is very well balanced and unique. I can't describe how good the fruitiness is in this. Deschutes never disappoints me, this is by far my favorite ipa from them. Cheers!"

"Beautiful pour of apricot, apple & papaya. Subdued strength, low to medium carbonation. very pleasant, quaff-able. Low end all the way around but that is an attractive feature these days. Finish starts sweet, toasty then attenuates dry in your mouth which would explain not being a big beer to start but extremely well fermented & balanced. Had my first Deschutes in 1980 & still like them 34 years later...."
""
""
""
""
"O-Deschutes knows what they're doing. This a really nice, enjoyable IPA with an interesting balance of hops to malt. I'll add this one to my rotation."
""
""
"O: Deschutes continues to impress! I'm starting to think that the folks brewing over there in Bend, Oregon couldn't make a disappointing brew if they tried. Fresh Squeezed IPA is damn near perfection in a 12oz. bottle. HUGE hop flavor that's perfectly balanced by malt presence, a mild mouthfeel that keeps this quaffable even in the heat of summer, and an ABV under 7%, which certainly makes this relatively sessionable and perfect for gameday or BBQs! If I were wearing a hat right now, I'd be tipping it to Deschutes. Truly a great beer."
""
""
""
"o: Apparently the age on this did freaky things to the flavor. Blindfolded, I might guess this was Wells' Banana beer. I bought two bottles to try since Deschutes is not usually carried by any store on the East Coast I know of. I'll save the other bottle to drink from a proper glass to see if the taste is different."

"Another tasty and affable IPA from Deschutes - the use of Citra and Mosaic hops seems to be complementary, the result being the obvious fruitiness run rampant. All good, all good, this could very well be the go-to six-pack around here, as summer finally kicks it into gear."

"Overall: Easily approachable, sessionable and balanced beer"

"O:  Really nice IPA.  I like the citrus forward IPAs quite a bit, and this one delivers in spades."
"Overall just an OK IPA."

"This beer delivers exactly what it promises. A superb example of what an ipa can be when it is brewed with freshness as the primary goal."

"Overall a bit of a let down. Nice hop profile that would have been a lot better if not for the sweet candy and caramel malts that kinda get in the way. The lingering rind and pith bitterness doesn't mix well with the sweetness and candy either."
""
""
""
"Like usual from this brewery, a great beer. Enjoyable, well balanced, but with plenty of hop character for all the hop heads. Highly recommended."
""
""

"Pours a light copper hue with a fluffy two finger ever present head and lacing everywhere quite the looker,the smell is strong pineapple,tropical salad and freshly torn orange leaves,the feel is full bodied with near perfect moderate carbonation and has tastes of strong citrus,tropical fruit salad,broken up with some sweet caramel malts and finished with a soft pine bitterness and overall yeah quite a nice IPA that I'd drink again cheers."
"For a beer exported to Australia at decent prices and which probably doesn't have the benefit of great freshness it's a nice offering. Bitterness is a tad cloying though."
"O-I think this is a relatively fresh bottle but I can't find a date on it for the life of me. It seems like I should be getting more of a pure hop aroma and flavor than I am so I wonder a little on the date but as it drinks tonight it is a balanced, flavorful easy drinking iPA that is not over the top in any aspect."
""
""
""
"Short but sweet review. This beer is definitely the closest thing I've been able to find to Heady Topper. Really citrus-y and not too dry. A lot of taste from the front of the tongue to the back. i feel like the label does a great job of describing this beer. Freshly squeezed citrus taste. Great beer!"

"O- awesome job. This is a favorite IPA of mine and if it was more local, I'd line the fridge. The citra came to play and won. Very tasty and just about everything I look for from an IPA. Hop forward and juicy. If that's your interest than this is a must."
""
""

"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this beer is its flavoring. This is just such a nice representation of each of the hop profiles here, and they blended beautifully across their similarities. Fresh Squeezed proves that the west coast can make an IPA without trying to kill you with hop bitterness. They run in the other direction but again, we were nicely surprised to find how sweet this beer is upfront. By the end, however, you do get a lot more of the organic, dirty bitterness from the hops, making for a nice progression and an ultimately pleasing contrast. This guy disappeared so fast we almost had to crack another two to finish the review. Hell, we’ll crack another two anyway, because this is one fine beverage."

"Crests around two fingers worth of cream white head, islands of bigger bubbles mixed around an even foam base, thick and splotchy lacing which clings nicely. Cloudy coppery red-orange colored liquid, its semi-opacity makes it difficult to see many bubbles, overall bright in a metallic way. Sweetly juicy and dense nose comprised of pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus and pineapple, mango, nectarine, peach fruit, the pine is ultra-sappy as well, strong cocoa powder presence too, there seems to be a herbal bite under all the sweetness but who can really tell. Medium-bodied, a soft and frothy attack turns drier by the finish as the carbonation fades and here the herbaceousness comes out stronger. Chocolate, coconut, vanilla notes blend into that flavorful base of pine, grapefruit and nectarine, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, more confectionary here, pronounced maltiness. If there’s one area it comes up short it would be in thirst quenching refreshment, too gluey and heavy for that. That said, kudos for the powerful length of the primary flavors without it seeming tiringly redundant. Three bottles might be the most I could throw back in a sitting."

"This is a very nice IPA. If they can match this yearly that would be a wonderful thing."

"I recently went on a boys trip to Portland and hit 10 different breweries. Deschutes has always been one of my favorites, but the Fresh Squeezed IPA became my all time favorite beer. The flavor was exactly what I look for - lots of hops, not too heavy, citrus flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - My fear was that Fresh Squeezed was going to be yet another hop bomb but boy was I wrong. This beer is complex, balanced, and sophisticated. The flavors are prominent yet not overwhelming. Deschutes has, yet again, knocked it out of the park."
""
""
""
"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 11/8/2013."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the definition of ""tease"" in the beer world. Looked great, smelled amazing, but when it came down to it, everything in terms of the palate fell short. Very disappointed. I will pass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like this one. Had it at Buffalo Wild Wings on tap. Didn't enjoy the sample as it left a bitter and lingering aftertaste....guess it is definitely and IPA. I really enjoyed the citrus aroma and the mild citrus overtones of flavor. Lightly carbonated so it went down smoothly with no burn. I would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I REALLY enjoyed this beer and will continue to buy it. Carbonation is the one thing that really stands out along with balance. Hops definitely not over the top - great flavor with a medium after taste. Not huge on the nose. Just a really dang good beer."
""
""
"Always a fan of Deschutes Beer. Except for the White IPA..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Delicious. It’s as if someone squeezed fresh orange juice into your pale ale, yet very well balanced. Smooth and very drinkable, this moves Deschutes way up on my list of favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured dark amber with finger width foamy head. Slight lacing. Strong citrus smell, including hints of grapefruit. Slight malty taste at the beginning with strong citrus bitter hops at the end. Aftertaste leaves a grapefruit bitterness. Very refreshing IPA."
""
""
"More IBUs than expected. “Greasy” (in a good way) spritzy citrus peel – but the Mosaic gets lost somewhere along the way. Not so much of a stylistic departure, not pure aroma, and not up to the hype."

"Another beer from Deschutes that hits it out of the park. Was really looking forward to this citra hop beer and it didn't let me down. great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent beer in every way but not quite the citrus bomb I'd been led to expect. A light brown color with hints of orange. A nice but not overpowering citrus scent and taste: orange zest and a bit of grapefruit. But maltier than the name and reputation suggests, which is not a drawback. This is a well balanced easy drinker."
"Overall this is something I highly recommend to anyone able to find it, its a treat."

""

"Pours out an orange, almost red, body with a thinnish head. Nose is of intense tropical fruit from the hops with a presence of caramel malt body. Hops are fully up front in the flavor, bringing lots of tropical and citrus fruits. Malt body is very much present, giving off loads of caramel malts. Solid bitterness matches the sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderate with a solid carbonation. This is a very solid IPA. Lots of good flavors going on."
""
""
""
""
"Comparing this head-to-head with Firestone Walker Double Jack & Squatters Hop Rising. Of the three, this is the brightest and easiest to quaff. The malt flavor is pretty subdued, especially compared to the Firestone, but the hops are very citrus forward in tasting, but not very obvious in the aroma. There's a hint of flowers or herbs and just slight bitterness in the aftertaste. This bottle was several months old, and I believe it is better consumed fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I dig Deschutes, and this is a solid offering somewhere between Inversion and Hop Henge!"

"Only thing that detracts from this beer to make it perfect is little to no head other then that it is hard to find faults."
""
" The flavor is excellent, lots fo hops that are citrus with a good amount of herbal flavor with mild caramel in the malt taste. The yeast is relatively mild but adds a texture which is almost creamy or it could be the hop resins making the bitterness seem smoother as it gently fades toward a tangy yet mildly spicy finish. Overall this is a great IPA, plenty of hops in the taste without being just bitter for bitterness sake, a very nuanced flavor which is highly drinkable."

""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""

"Final Thoughts: Just not really feeling this one. Citra hops, when used correctly, can yield outstanding results but Fresh Squeezed seems like more of a homebrewer's first time making an IPA. Would I drink it again? Unlikely."
""
""
""
"The beer is golden with a small white head. Aromas of stone fruit, hops, juice, resin, cracker, malt. Crisp with a bitter kick. A bit of bite from the hops. Juicy with tangy citrus tones. A malty body weighs the beer down a bit. Still, pretty good stuff here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My verdict is that they're both great IPAs: drink whichever you feel like. They have enough differences to justify ongoing production of both, yet are quite similar in the grand scheme of IPAs. That is a testament to Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
"incredible orange. grapefruit. lemon. this like a frickin' box of TRIX cereal. the taste of this brew is absolutely incredible. slight hop bitterness, but reminiscent of CANDY. or, Trix cereal. this stuff is absolutely incredible. but wait, I said that already. forget the review, just have a drink of this stuff. I've been trying new Midwest and east coast IPAs all afternoon, so maybe this is just from being a 'change'? nah, I don't think so . . . ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle in Deschutes Pub Glass.  Pours a golden amber with 1/2 inch frothy head.  Smells like grapefruit and hops, delicious.  Tastes exactly as it smells citrusy grapefruit with a good hop balance.  The mouth feel is spot on, and it begs you to keep drinking.  I cannot lie, this beer is outstanding in every way.  As longs as it if fairly fresh this beer knocks it out of the park every time."
""
""
""
"The berry scents and flavors balance very well with the herbal-earthy quality that is present. There could be even more dank balance on the nose, and in the flavor profile. This is quite the delightful, sweeter IPA."
""
""
""
"O- I've never been (and seemingly never will be) a hophead, but this beer is a refreshing and rare example of how to do a proper IPA with the emphasis on the citrus sans the distracting bitterness."

"Fresh squeezed IPA pours a darker bronze color with a nice large and lacing white head. There is a strong hop aroma, with strong grapefruit notes. Taste has a nice malty toasty backbone, with a nice hop note, lots of grapefruit flavors. Very full flavors, a little flat. Overall a very rich flavorful and complex IPA."
""
""
"O: good ipa - not as hoppy as I had hoped, i am not a huge fan of pear and only so-so on green apple so those flavors dont really get me going. i can see someone who loves those flavors absolutely loving this beer though."
"Overall - A great seasonal IPA. I could see myself drinking one or two while fishing or hanging out by the pool"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Also the flavor reminds me a lot of there fresh hop APA, very similar malt bills I imagine."
""
""
"O - To me this beer falls just short of world class in every aspect except mouthfeel. If the Citra notes popped more, the malt was toned down a bit with more of a dry finish, this beer would be the new Zombie Dust...except more affordable, available, and better mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really LOVE this beer...one of my favorite IPAs...sweet malts and juicy hops, a perfect balance...it doesn't bang your palate into submission like so many hoppy beers but instead wows you with it's creamy decadent citrus punch...wonderfully sublime."
""
""
""
""
""
"First it pours much darker than most IPAs which is fine but there is too much crystal-75 malt in there for me. The aroma is lackluster. Thought it was going to bigger from the reviews I read. Surprised how muted the citra was. The taste is a very drinkable amber ale with juicy fruity hop notes. Sweet line and maybe a tiny bit of tropical fruits are washed away by a toasted sticky sweet caramel background. The mouthfeel is the best part about this beer. It feels good in the mouth and on the tongue. Overall, it was decent at best...super drinkable. Not an in your face west coast style ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was an awesome session. Almost like the name of the beer, this beer seemed way fresh and what a West Coast IPA can (and should) be. In your face hops and bitterness but a good dose of fruit to round it out. Really good stuff that I will definitely be consuming more of."
""
""
""
"Overall a stellar IPA. Nothing mind blowing, just a well crafted brew by Deschutes. Juicy, malt forward but not overwhelming so for the style. Great hop character. Would love to try this fresh, like days old fresh. Imagine the Citra shines through a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had a off white head and a clear caramel color. It took a while but I finally was able to detect the aroma of the hops from the beer. It's not the most aromatic of beers. Also lots more malt flavor in this beer then I was expecting. There is definitely a bitterness to the beer that goes really well with the malt background, but I am not getting any citrus or fruit flavor like the bottle implies. I will have to give this beer another chance it was in the bottle so it might not have been treated very well."

"One of the top IPAs out there. Beautiful bronze color. Fantastic use of the mosaic and citra hops to give that tropical fruit aroma and taste. Very balanced and smooth. Oregon is saturated with over-powering bitter hop IPAs and that's great, but this is perfectly balanced with malt and hops. It stands out from the rest in the region."
""
"YUMMY, TRY SOME!"
""
"O. Deschutesbrewery is a go to brand in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only thing wrong with this IPA is that it is so well constructed it lacks surprise. Entirely balanced. Moves from malt to hop to a citrus finish, smooth but not at all innocuous, and rich enough without being in your face. I could happily drink this every day and not grow bored. Well done."
""

"Overall: Another solid brew from Deschutes. Glad to see this one in the six pack format. Citra and Mosaic hops seem to be very different but come together well here. The bright fruit tones from Citra are balance and held together by the earthy Mosaic tones."
""
""
""
"This tastes as fresh as the smell, with a juicy, somewhat chewy hop flavor of pineapple citrus/ floral notes. The mouthfeel is perfectly balanced for me here, somewhat sweet, then bitter but not in a palate-wrecking way whatsoever. Well-rounded indeed with the malts sweet just right. A great IPA from a world class west coast brewery. I hope to find this again."
""
"Overall - I'm going to buy whatever is left tomorrow. I absolutely love this IPA - I'm a little biased on this one because the focus is citrus and tropical with light floral - my favorite hop flavors. For citrus hop heads this is a Must Try."

"its back in six packs this year, one incredibly refreshing ipa, loaded with citra and mosaic hops, two of my favorites, so this is right in my wheelhouse. clear light amber copper color, lots of bubbles and a frothy and lasting white head over an inch high. it smells less citrusy than expected, but mouth watering and enticing notes of other fruits from tangerines to passion fruits, crisp and clean, hoppy, but not way bitter either. the flavor is the same, some lemon and orange notes, but more tropical fruit flavors too. maybe a touch of pine as it finishes, but this is a light ipa as far as hop intensity. its got some malt balance, maybe even a little more than it needs, it could be a little less filling, but its so tasty and fresh, everything i expected after checking out the awesome label artwork. its west coast, a little thicker, medium carbonation, and a clean finish thats almost a little sweet from all the hop oils and resins hanging around. a nice use of fun hop varietals in a very tasty ipa, not dissimilar to their hop trip fresh hop from this fall. deschutes has ipas dialed."
""
""
""
"Had this one quite fresh (best by 6/26/14) and it was incredibly hoppy and juicy. This was fresh hops at their finest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A great fruity hoppy IPA with more of a malt backbone than a typical west coast IPA. One of the better IPA's I've had from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Fresh Squeezed IPA is right! Never has a beer been more aptly named. Such amazing juiciness, with the right touch of bitterness and malt backbone. It's hard to believe there were no fruit extracts used in the making of this beer; if this is what we have to look forward to with these new mosaic hops, then a new age of IPA awesomeness is certainly on the rise. Just a wonderful juicy beer. No other words can describe it. They better make this a six pack brew, or I'm gonna become poor really fast! (And they did, much to my excitement!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end this honestly tastes like a red chair with more hops and more alcohol. The smell is almost exactly the same. In the end it's a good ipa and I wouldn't ever not recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seriously my favorite beer. I was looking for something citra hopped or close to Zombie Dust( don't let anyone tell you there is a Zombie dust clone, It just doesn't exist) at my local Friar Tucks and this was recommended. Brought home a bomber bottle and was hooked. Fantastic smell, Sweet citrus and floral flavor with a nice piney aftertaste. No description will do it justice, just go try a bottle. Absolutely love this. Went out and bought the rest of their stock for the next few months. It's only a June-September seasonal so stock up while you can. you won't be disappointed. The only thing disappointing about this beer is that you will not be able to get more after you drink it all."

"6.4%ABV. per bottle label.Best by 11/23/13.Pours into an imperial pint glass a deep burnt orange with a thinner off white head that leaves multiple rings of broken lace as it settles slowly.Ripe zesty citrus fruit hops in the nose with slight note of pine,a big caramel presence as well.Somewhat sweet on the palate with some sugar and caramel/biscuit notes,the hops are juicy and burst out with a big citric fruitiness as well as a lingering resiny finish.The label says it all, it is juicy and fresh tasting.A great beer to be expected."
""
"At Taphouse Seattle. Amber pour with one finger head. Citrus fruit aroma. Flavor is citrus hops and some extra mango juice flavor. Easy drinking. Rerate: from a fresh bottle from Dak. Thanks! Pours a deep copper orange red color with a. Fluffy, creamy, somewhat off white two finger head. Big juicy mango and pine aroma. A nice bitter presence goes along with the tropical fruit sweetness. Big time grapefruit, mango, and pineapple. The brew really brings out a nice fresh flavor from the mosaic here and it just works. Slick mouthfeel with lowish carbonation for the style. Excellent IPA."
""
"O- I like what's going on here. Simple, but it really feels like Deschutes made this one seem easy when it really wasn't. Nothing about it blows me away with depth or complexity, but a very clean, well put together IPA"
""

""
"I like that the malts are in evidence with a middling caramel with a slight toastiness. Hops are so juicy with some piney-tropical flavors. Its not overly bitter, but the hops coat the tongue thoroughly. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Quite good, one of the better Deschutes beers I have had in the past couple years."

"I kept hearing great things about the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA, while I kept waiting and waiting for it to arrive in Texas. Sometimes I never understand why it takes so long for certain beers to make it to this market and it’s especially frustrating when it’s an IPA or something that needs to be consumed fresh. Thus by the time it made it to me its was a not so Fresh Squeezed IPA, but I figured it was still worth a taste. The brew poured a deep golden amber with a substantial head with very good lacing. The aroma was extremely bright and citrusy with lemons and grapefruit along with passionfruit and tropical fruit notes. All in all it was a great smelling IPA. The taste had an obvious citrus punch with some pine followed by the fruitiness. The hop profile was substantially bright and fresh, but I could imagine it would have been even stronger fresh. The slight hop fade allowed the strong bready caramel malt character to show through and it held all the hops together. Even so my palate was left with a nice bitter hop coating. The Fresh Squeezed IPA was a easy and smooth and a really wonderful IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad ipa. Could use a little more pop and/or complexity."
"Fresh sums this beer up well. Glad to see brewers moving from extreme to finesse. Lots of good examples out there and I found this one of the best."
"Medium body, carbonation, and bitterness. Drinks smooth."
"O - The mix of Citra and Mosaic is great. A very enjoyable beer that is hop forward without being overly bitter. I'm certain this would have been even better if it were a bit fresher. Even with that, it's an incredibly well done and delivers as promised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- When it comes to aromatics this is one of the most impressionable IPAs I've had in a while. Mosaic hops are not something I've delved into, but will surely be looking around with other brews of similar architecture."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/5/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of tangerine, peach, pear, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pear, pineapple, orange zest, caramel, bread, toast, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Light earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, peach, pear, lemon zest, pineapple, orange zest, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop flavors; with a well balanced malt backbone and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Luckily it more than makes up for it once it hits your tongue.  Tropical citrus greets your next step. Concurrently it is profoundly bitter and quite sweet. The finish maintains that dual nature of sweet and bitter.  Quite well crafted. Juicy like a Biggie single. So tasty. I feel lucky to have found it on tap here."

"O-The beer delivers the citrus promised by the label and title. In fact, this may be the juiciest, fruitiest IPA I have ever had. It is sweet and bready for the style, but drinks pretty easily. While I enjoyed the huge fruit flavors here, it might be a bit simple and sweet if you need a palate crushing IPA or are looking for something to hold up to stronger food flavors."

"Overall really recommended IPA. Quite flavorful for just a 6% IPA. Lovely."
"Amazing beer. Just had it for the first time. Definitely lived up to the hype. It surprised me in all the ways I thought it wouldn't. I briefly thought that I tasted cherry cotton candy or some sort of gum ball flavoring imparted by yeast? not sure. Definitely looking forward to having this one again."

"From a bomber bottle, this poured a dark golden orange with a 2-finger head which quickly dissipated to a frothy coating. Lacing was nice throughout. Nose was the hoppy citrus you would expect from the name. Taste followed, with citra hops dominant but nicely balanced with some nice, sweet malts. There wasn't much hint of alcohol nor was there a heavy, bitter aftertaste. Beer was medium body with decent carbonation. The lower ABV is a bonus, making this session able. I haven't bee the biggest fan of Deschutes but this will make me rethink that and I absolutely would come back to this beer."

"O: Overall has a fresh, wet, tropical and citrus hopping, more flavor forward then bitter, the malt base is sweetly toasted, well balanced and not overly dry. Multiple levels of hop complexity, soft dry finish, good malt support with a fresh wet nature that will leave your tongue wet with delight. Must try, worthy repeat."

"Definitely the best Deschtes I have ever had. This beer poured a nice clear amber with decent head that eventually dissipated, but did leave some lacing. The scent carried the wonderful aroma of citra hops....and it was fresh! The taste was a very well balanced IPA....there was very nice pine and citrus but they were escorted by a sweet caramelly malt which just made the beer fun to drink. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this beer is a session monster...I would drink this every chance I get...nice job Deschutes...big ole homer on this one."
""
""
"It's a perfect IPA for those sick of IPAs."
""
""
"O- Not my favorite IPA but a very enjoyable beer that is different than anything else that I have had before, if there goal was to make an IPA that was as case as you could get to biting into a ripe grapefruit (which judging by the name seems probable) then Deschutes has succeeded."
""
"O: It's a very good representation of a full hop flavored beer that is not over done and has a very well balanced malt bill to back it up. A very good summer/fall beer."
""
""

"Must seek and destroy!"

"Reddish bronze in appearance. A millimeter thick head of eggshell white foam. A bit hazy as far as the clarity goes. Distinct pine like hop aroma that is so prevalent to all Deschutes beers. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and sticky, which is true to the style. The hop flavor is sharp and prickles the tongue on the front of the palate. It is quickly followed up with a strong malt backbone. It does taste pretty fresh."
"Picked this bad boy up at a great little liquor store called Bridgeview in Moorhead, MN. Pours with a great amber color. Very little head but nice lacing. Smells fruity with a great hop aroma on the back end. Tastes exactly as it smells. Overall one of the better beers I've had."

"O: I wasn't crazy about this...maybe it's better from the bottle? There were more malt than hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus, earthy malt, sweet malt, hops, slight pine, hint of alcohol, and resin. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, alcohol, and slight pine. Overall, strong and distinguished hop/pine flavor, the blend is great, and good feel."
""
"Pours a clear copper color with a bright white three-finger head. Nice sticky lacing. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit on the nose. Faint malt and floral notes in the background. Taste is best described as juicy with lots of citrus. Medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. Finishes off-dry and slightly bitter. Overall a very well crafted, very drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
"Wow the appearance was a very nice amber color with a three finger head which dissolved down to a nice a one finger head and left behind some nice lacing around the rim of the cup. The smell was a nice and light pine to it. the taste was very smooth and very light crisp and refreshing. There is a real solid IPA for me i loved everything about it."
""
""
"O - Seriously an amazing combination of sweet malts and tropical juicy fruits. Love it. I think this earns the title of a personal favorite."
"D - As usual, Deschutes has made an enjoyable, balanced brew; unfortunately I hoping for more hop intensity and less malt sweetness. Still, a very good value for the price and quite easy to drink."
""
""
"Wow, without a doubt the most interesting hop forward beer I have had this year ... perhaps one of the best as well. We all know and love Citra but the Mosaic really shines here. Deschutes yet again has no problem going above and beyond when it comes to bringing on the hops."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very tasty fresh hop ipa. Very glad they started offering this in 12oz bottles, but bombers of this are pretty easy on the wallet so another good quality."
"Dark amber orange fluid topped by a smallish head, fair lace. Smells of oranges, grapefruit rind, caramel, wheat, a little hint of earth. Perhaps the citra hop is overpowered here but I'm not getting loads of tropical flavors. Taste is orange candies..seems sweet like marmalade, grapefruit pith, lemongrass, as I thought this seems to start sweet but really isn't cloying. Bitterness is mild throughout. Finish is dry and mostly clean. Body is lighter than medium probably could be called a bit watery, and it could be a little creamier. Overall, not sure what to make of this beer. It's certainly different than most IPAs and I'm also not getting the elements I would expect from citra."

"One of the most pleasurable IPA's I have ever had in my home, looking forward to the next week or so."
""
"Overall, an awesome IPA, a must have if you are looking for a very unique, fruity hop character. But be prepared for balance, this is not a bone-dry hop-bomb, it has an english-like character from the malt and yeast that is reinforced with lots of hoppiness. I am so glad this thing is now in six-packs year-round, awesome ale."

"This is really well made. I hope Mosaic holds the public's interest and generates a lot of demand, because it really brings a lot to the party in a beer. This is definitely a must-try beer!"

"I would recommend buying a bottle before it's too late!"

"O - Overall, this is an exceptional IPA and a nice refreshing alternative to most IPA agendas. The complexity of the tropical fruit notes in this offering yield great insight into what can be harnessed from some of the more unique and complex profiles of hops. Quite enjoyable."

"O: Remarkably unique take on an IPA. This is unlike any other I have ever had. Distinctly Oregon, but without the maltsplosion that accompanies most Oregon beers. I would buy this again, if only for how unique it is."
""
"O-Happy I picked up a 22oz'er of this. Will be back for another one. If you see this you will not be disappointed. In the crowded IPA field this one for me ranks as an all around delicious, quenching, highly drinkable beer that I will go back too again and again. Cannot imagine it on tap. HOLY SHIT."
"Drinks too easy, would love to see this in six pack format"

""

""

"Totally drinkable. I'd like to see what this would be like dialed back another percent ABV less. This could be another great session beer with loads of flavor from this hop blend. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Liticker's Liquor & Deli in Ocean Beach."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a copper orange colour. The aroma and taste deliver everything the name promises. This is one fruity-tasting beer. The nose offers a plethora of citrus and tropical fruit notes thanks to the Mosaic hops used to brew it. The palate features more of the same, it's sweet, fruity, juicy, creamy and has a nice finish. Hard to stop drinking!"

"O-Very nice beer. Smooth, nice carbonation. I really enjoy the grapefruit and bitterness of this beer."

"OV: I'm glad I picked this one up and may grab another on a return trip. Damn, if they shipped this here to NJ in 4pk or 6pks I would be very happy. I'm not complaining about a 22oz, though. Beautiful aromas, great flavour to match and a finish that leaves you smacking your lips and ready for the next sip. This is my first Deschutes beer and I hope it hasn't spoiled me too much on what else to expect from them."

""
""
"O-Citra and mosaic hops are amazing. This beer is not the best made with either, but still a wonderful IPA."
""
"O: A very drinkable IPA, but other than having a lot in common with fruit juice, it doesn’t really hit many of my buttons. Will be pretty easy to take down the entire bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and lots of fresh, juicy citrus fruit and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet citrus fruit and orange juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice citrus hop smell and some tasty flavors to back it up."
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. Even though the body is rather thick, it is a great summer beer. Not in the sessionable sense, but in it's refreshing nature. If anyone has a problem with this beer it is probably the sweetness. All the fruit combines with the malt and makes it a little sweet."
""
""

"Overall, this is a fantastic ipa that features some nice citric, fruit juice notes and great malt sweetness. While sweeter ipa's aren't a favorite of all, this one might change your opinion."
""
"O: Very pleasing on every sip. This is a good showcase of hops but very balanced with some flavorful light roasted barley additions in the grain bill. I could drink a lot of this beer and want to share with others too!"
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is just right. This beer has a smooth dry lightly bitter finish. Overall this is a very tasty beer. My bottle says best by 6/07/14. Lists an abv. of 6.4% ."
""
""
""
""
"A well done IPA, the nose was really inviting, and while the taste was enjoyable, it just wasn't quite as impressive as the nose."
""
""
""
" A welcome change-up in the IPA world and a very well crafted statement about the possibilities within the style. Bravo!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, nicely carbonated, sticky and lasting on the tongue. If you're into fruit-forward IPAs, this is an absolute killer. Perhaps a bit sweet, but this was one of the more expressive hoppy beers I've had in a while."
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, lightly foamy mouthfeel that suits the beer quite well. Closes quite dry, with fairly notable stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So far I've not been too impressed with the hoppy bomber beers from Deschutes, like the Hop Henge. But I think it's because I prefer dry, hoppier IPAs. That being said, this is a solid beer that I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy."
"The lower (for an IPA) alcohol is a definite plus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a superb IPA, worth trying for sure. Wish it came in a 6-pack. One of Deschuttes better offerings, which is saying a lot."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Didn't taste it as fresh as it can be, but it was a good offering. Felt like, despite it being malty and citrusy/tropical hoppy, it could have been more of one or the other (or both.) Very good, but not great."
""
""
"No juicers necessary my children; just grab a bottle opener, a teku, and pour da damn thang and savor it."
"The body was a fairly typical medium. Drinkability was OK, you could probably have a few without burning out your tongue. Overall, a pleasant enough brew, it wouldn't be my first choice for an IPA, nor my last. Worth a shot if you see it."
""
""
""
"Overall means case worthy to me. So would I buy a case? Yes, yes I would but it would need to be as fresh as I could find."
""
""
""
"Without doubt, one of the best aromatic ""balanced"" IPAs I've ever had. The fruit flavors and smells are incredible, and its biggest downside is the lack of cohesion between the hop oils and acids, especially in the taste. But really freaking good, and one I'll definitely be looking for again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really impressive IPA. Excellent balance and juicy as hell. Perhaps a tad on the sweet side."
"This is a killer beer. Tons of flavor, not too much alcohol, and refreshing enough for Summer."

"D - Nice beer, tasty. Would have scored higher with more malt in the taste."
""
"22oz bottle, Best by 10/8/13, deep reddish-copper colored ale topped with a creamy, frothy, ivory head that holds great retention and leaves some sticky lacing at the top of the glass. Huge,dank hop nose with mango, grapefruit, pine, caramel; super fresh. Tastes are juicy and sweet with caramel, bready malt, mango (-and other tropical notes), more dank, wet hops, grapefruit, not overly bitter on the finish with exceptional balance, maybe a little on the sweeter side. Mouth-feel is oily, resiny, slightly dry, while being medium bodied. I love everything from this brewery; another solid beer from Deschutes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a great IPA. Not too in your face with the hops and a solid balancing act from the malt. Good flavors in all the right proportions so this is one easy drinking and enjoyable beer. I hope this one comes back around or stays permanently."
""
"Overall, a fantastically drinkable IPA. The name is well-chosen and one that I will gladly pick up once a year. A full-flavor IPA that is also refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With all the hype, I was looking forward to crush this. Overall this is really good but just a bit sweet for me. I'm missing some malt and IBU to balance it out. When you have on your label a hop in a vise you'd expect more bitterness-I'm just saying. Price point is outstanding. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice slightly cloudy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy off-white head, and leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, with a nice malt note, slight citrus and pine note. The taste is a very nice blend of hops and malts, with some citrus/pine notes. Medium body, the finish is slightly dry and bitter. Overall a very nice thirst quencher."
"Overall: Picked up a bottle in Illinois to try. Nicely balanced and extremely drinkable. Nice citrus and sweetness without being overbearing. Another great beer from Deschutes!"
""
"Mouthfeel is substantial, creamy. Overall, I'm quite happy with this beer."

"Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA ---4/5."
"D – Very drinkable. I could easily put down a few of these in a session. I enjoyed this beer and would recommend it anyone who likes west coast IPA’s."
""
"Overall this stuff is really good. Reminds me a bit of hop henge, I like this one a lot better though. Not too expensive and very fruity, not often you drink Moasic hops. Must try, one of the better beers I've had from Deschutes"
""
"Pours a dark orange color with a hint of ruby. Has a finger length head of an off white color that dissipates fairly slowly and leaves a nice lacing. The citra hops really show through on the nose. Smells of tons of grapefruit, tangerine, papaya, mango, stone fruit. A little sweet breadiness in the background. Very juicy smell. Taste starts with dank grapefruit, mango, and other tropical fruits. Then get a nice crisp, bready sweetness from the malts that does not overpower the hop qualities at all, but complements them instead. Also get more stone fruit qualities. The finish comes more from the mosaic hops than the citra hops. Get tangerine, more grapefruit, some pine, some dank, herbal qualities as well. The sweetness from the malts stays throughout the finish and gently balances the very little bitterness imparted from the hops. Medium body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Pretty clean mouthfeel, which allows the juicy hops to shine. A really good ipa on the lighter side of the spectrum with two of my favorite hops. I would definitely get this again."

"Overall- Solid beer, above average. But with all the IPAs out there, it is easily forgettable. Would definitely consider this on a regular basis if this came in six packs at Deschutes' normal prices."
""
"Really liked this beer...poured a copperish-amber color, nice white head. Nice lacing left on the glass throughout. Citrus really comes though due to the citra hops, with a nice malt backbone. Very drinkable, not heavy....found it nicely balanced with a touch of sweetness at the finish. Overall worth trying to find!"

"light yellow in color with a nice cream head lots of lacing on the glass. The mouth feel is sweet/sour with a good blend of hops. A very refreshing brew. Hints of citrus, and a nice light malt aftertaste. Lots of food will pair well with this one. Be sure to grab one when you see it!"
"Orangey-amber pour with great clarity, with a small white head; decent retention and lacing. Aroma was really nice! Fresh hops, juicy, dank, lots of fruit, candy-like sugar sweetness (think Smarties). The taste didn't quite live up to the aroma, but it was still quite good, lots of juicy hops, citrus, toasted cereal grains, and more candy sweetness; dry finish, but not too bitter. Medium body, clean mouthfeel, overall very drinkable."
""
""
"Fresh Squeezed is a good quality IPA, especially for those who have a yen for citra & mosaic hops. If the finish were a touch drier and the malt factor not quite as prominent, it would be a major contender. Well worth a try, and overall enjoyable: a solid IPA in every respect."
""
""
"Overall. Great stuff, Deschutes! Tons of citrus in this big hop bomb. My kind of IPA."
"Was actually slightly let down by this one. Not a bad beer at all but based on the hype surrounding this west coast beer, I was expecting much more."
""
""
""
"Wow. If you like IPAs with a fruity flavor profile then this beer is for you. Pours a light orange/copper color with a thickm, creamy, off white head. Aroma is full of tropical fruits. Taste is full of fruits and a mild hop bitterness finish. Overall, this is a fantastic IPA. In my opinion very similar to st. lupulin from odell brewing."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. Two great hop varieties that provide some great and interesting combinations of flavors. Fruity, dank, slightly tart and bitter all mix to make an intriguing beer. Not the best or boldest on flavors, but very solid and worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another solid Deschutes beer. Not a showstopper but damn if I don't want to drink a sixer every so often."
""
""
"Smooth and refreshing, this is exactly what I needed on a super hot day. Each sip went down so easy, compelling me to go back for another one. One knock is that the bitterness doesn't seem quite high enough for an IPA, making me think this lands more in the Pale Ale category. This is a minor complaint, however, and this is another solid brew from Deschutes."
""
""
"O - good beer, but not really what I look for in an IPA. Not a great utilization of Citra and Mosaic. It drinks like an ESB made with American hops."
"O: Good; doesn't feel like a huge winner as a summer seasonal but I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Didn't have any expectations for this one and it ended up being great... perhaps that's why? Great mix of tropical fruits and a unique tree-like and woodsy-dirty flavor and aroma from the hops - possibly a contribution of the Mosaic variety. Quite drinkable - this is something that would definitely be a regular in the fridge rotation if it were available in my area. A bit underrated, in my opinion."
"Overall- A very enjoyable IPA with a crisper finish and a nice hop blend."
""
""
""
"Fresh squeezed in the nose alone, pity that the juicy, nectary blast of hops couldn't be replicated in the flavor. Solid IPA, rather balanced with some red ale nuances and peach hops make this one unique. Say Citra and Mosaic and everyone goes nuts, decent IPA and probably one of the better ones from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"revisited 5/9/14 (bottle, best by date 8/12/14) just as good as last time. citra and mosaic hops make their presence known. seems a tiny bit more piney and oily, a good thing. deschutes has a consistent winner here for those who like their ipas not just hoppy, but hoppy/juicy/flavorful."
""
"Really a great effort from Deschutes. I'm continually impressed by their line of reasonably priced large format IPA's."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really happy with this one. The malt's breadiness felt a little out of place, and it almost felt a little more like a pale ale than an IPA, despite the evident hoppiness. I'd rather have Hop in the Dark this season and wish this was available as a 12oz bottle, but definitely would be open to drinking more Fresh Squeezed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable IPA especially on a hot day. Like ""fresh squeezed"" lemonade."
""
""
"O – Not bad, but I wouldn't refer to it as fresh hoppy goodness either, there are just mild hop notes in this one. It is drinkable, but really comes across as ho hum, nothing remarkable."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine two finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Great aroma of herbal and piney hops distinct from a distance, caramel malt and orange citrus. Flavor is grapefruit, orange and tropical fruit, caramel malt with light citrus hops. Finishes with citrus and citrus and piney hops, which are considerably restrained compared to the aroma. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The fruit notes are more noticeable than the malt or hops. An interesting sweet juicy take on an IPA, but I'd like a bit more herbal hops presence like the aroma. The hop character is probably due to the fruit juicy character of mosaic hops."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is good, but could use a bit more carbonation, and a touch more bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle that I believe I got for $4.59 which is not to shabby. Orange color, good head. Aroma is where the beer really lives up to its name, it is very citrusy and specifically smells like oranges. The flavor was a bit less citrusy and while hoppy was sort of a let down after that super juicy smell. Overall a solid beer and a good value I just wish the flavor was as amped as the aroma."
"I had this at the brew pub in Portland less than a year ago and thought it was great. The nose blew me away. This is the citra hop at its best. I've had zombie dust and its a darn good ""pale ale"". But this beer is 6% (.4 less than zombie) and its considered an IPA. I put this in the class of Blind Pig. A low abv IPA by average, but by no means a lighter flavored IPA, at all. If this was called a pale ale, it would dominate Zombie Dust (I understand its just my opinion). I'm stoked this is a local release, cause I don't need to trade for an amazingly tasty sessionable ale."
"O-another solid beer from Deschutes, easy drinking with good hoppy flavors"
""
"Pours a maple syrup colored amber capped by a fluffy two finger off white head. Excellent retention that leaves behind plenty of thing stringy lacing. Not surprisingly, tons of hoppy citrus notes on the nose: pineapple, citrus blossoms, tangerine, mandarin orange, kumquat Valencia orange, and hints of mango. The combined citrus present in the nose are also present in the taste, caramel malt balances this brew perfectly midpalate. Finishes with just the right amount of bitterness by way of hoppy orange rind accents. Fairly substantial malt backbone, medium bodied, slick, smooth with moderate carbonation. A fairly well-balanced IPA that delivers just the right amount of bitterness. Excellent use of citra and mosaic hops here."

"I really enjoyed this beer it was refreshing. And to top it off its Deschutes and I really think they have it going on in the craft beer department."

"The mouthfeel on this is good for an ipa. The malt gives it a good body and the hops add a good amount of stickiness and bitterness to it."

"O - Other breweries that come to mind (RRBC, Drake's, FFF) would offer this as their hoppy pale ale. Pretty solid beer here, but not as ""juicy"" as the name and label would suggest. Worth the one time purchase. Better than Red Chair, but not better on the wallet, but worth the spend."

"Pours a medium amber, a bit darker than expected. Quite clear, but the color makes it somewhat hard to see through. Bone white head. Puffs up nicely and stick around for awhile, leaving plenty of lacing on the walls of the glass. The aroma is a mix of peachy mosaic and zesty citrus from the citra. There's also some mango, pineapple, blackberry and kiwi. Lots of tropical fruit, really. It's very fresh but a bit subdued. Based on the color, I was expecting more caramel malt flavor to pop up, but it's mostly just a background for the hops, and what's there blends in nicely. The taste has tons of hop flavor and nearly zero bland bitterness. It's just all fruity hops. Mild malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. The two hop varieties play very well together. Lots of light stone fruit, tropical fruit and citrus flavors. Hop flavors really coat the mouth in the finish. Mouthfeel is rather light. Some hop oiliness. Finishes pretty dry. Unsurprisingly, Deschutes did a fine job with this beer. It could just use a bit more punch to the aroma. Otherwise, it's rather excellent and exceedingly drinkable. I'm not sure where this bomber went, but it seems to be empty, already."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this. The aroma was not something I expected from Deschutes. I must say, this is downright quaffable when the thirst is upon me, and at this very moment, the thirst is upon me."
"D/O: A 'concept beer' served at the company pub in Portland for years, this mild but aromatic IPA finally graduates to wide production. It is just marginally more edgy in its current incarnation than it was upon first encounter in 2010. Remembered as a misapplication of Citra cultivar hops, this newer model represents an improvement."
"Very good ipa, lots of citrus, fairly sweet and enough bitterness to balance it all."
"T: Very smooth and sweet throughout. Some faint pink grapefruit, mango and a ton of caramel malt. The sweetness overwhelms any real hop bite, which I think this beer kind of could use. I was really excited for this one and I'm a bit let down, but this is still another really solid beer from Deschutes."

"Flavor starts off with juicy hop notes. There is a nice earthy and herbal grassy character to the brew mixed in with the intense and yummy grapefruit and citrus notes. West Coast IPA notes are pretty yummy. There is some nice slight caramel notes from the malts but these are pretty overwhelmed by the awesome intense and yummy hops. There is some more dank pine notes as the brew warms. Pretty nice IPA."

"Looking forward to my next bottle!"

"The beer poured a light to medium amber color with a fingers worth of a light khaki colored head. The aroma was of fresh cut fruits including tangerine, lemons and mango. The taste followed the nose fairly closely but with a subtle caramel and toffee backbone and no alcohol presence. The mouth feel was light and refreshing and medium carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable and sessionable IPA."
""

"Medium bodied with light carbonation, and a light caramel malt aftertaste. Very balanced, with the malt having a stronger presence than I am used to in an IPA, but still good. I'm glad I had a chance to try this."

"There's no way this brew will hold up until 10/08/13 as stated on the label...It's decent now, but tastes like it's falling fast... Worthy, but not to seek. What's going on with Deschutes brews? They have the ability to lead the industry, but they need to step up the hopping program."

"A surprisingly dark pour, this beer is copper in color and capped with a dense beige head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing. The nose is great. Super fresh, vibrant and fruity with citrus, stone fruit and an all-round excellent hop character, there's gobs of peach, nectarine, tangerines and some grape. Malt character is minimal and is overshadowed by the hop nose. The palate is similar.  Excellent fruity hop flavors with a moderate hop bitterness, mildly oily and mildly pungent , there's peach, white grape and citrus flavors here. Sweetness from the malt is secondary to all the juicy hop sweetness that's present. Soft and fluffy on the palate, this beer is medium light in body, has an excellent creamy carbonation and a lingering finish that's fruity and bitter. Impressive stuff."

"Overall: Extremely flavorful IPA that seems like it should be a Wet Hop IPA. The sweet hop flavor and sharp finish are distractions, but otherwise this is a very good release from Deschutes."
"Amber with a solid light cream sheet. Smells like tropical and citrus fruits with a bit of body odor and some cotton candy. Flavor is sweet with rich caramelized malts and some straight sugar, some lemons, some onion. Medium on heavy feeling with a sharp, moderate carb and a moderately dry finish. An okay beer, not impressive really."
""
"Overall a very tasty, unique brew. Most regions of the IPA spectrum have been covered, but this one is different."
""
""
"M/O- fruity and hoppy some bitterness nicely carbonated a little thin for an IPA sweet malts"
""
"Expected more from this one. With that said, it's quite easy drinking and on a hot day, it won't leave a film that some IPAs do."
""
""
""
"The hops are little bizarre with the almost artificial tropical fruit aroma and flavor and Citra is not one of my favored hops anyways. Still going to gain a lot of fans, that I have no doubt."
""
"not my favorite deschutes"
""
"frsh-fruity aromas, refreshing sort of brew, not quite what I expected or hoped for - non-beer drinkers might enjoy it... strange sort of IPA, homebrew quality"
""
""
"D - This is like a less complex, sweeter version of Zombie Dust. I hear they'll be bottling it next year using a different hop profile, which is probably stupid because that will completely change this beer."

"Overall, a pretty good beer, but a bit of a let down after I got past the smell."

"Overall: I love this beer. I want to kiss it full on the mouth. I get so desensitized with big IPAs that I sometimes forget about the magic of a well balanced beer that offers a modest 60 IBUs. This beer is my reminder."
""
"Overall a very nice but straight to the point IPA featuring Citra hops. Worth a pint just to check it out, but nothing to search out."
"O: This is a nice beer, not overly hoppy...more like a pale than a lot of IPA's out there, very nicely balanced though. Glad I tried this."
"Went to the public house on a beautiful Portland summer evening for BB XXIII. Oooh, Fresh Squeezed is on to. I remember how great that was last year, we should get that too. Wait what? What happened to this beer? Last year it was a citrus delight, this year not so much. Still a beautiful, burnt orange color. The nose has a touch of citrus, but I'm also getting a musty note that is unpleasant. The taste is a bomb. Like dissolved aspirin with a malt backbone. Those aren't citra hops as I know them."
"m/d-This is a real slow drinker, very strong and bitter. I really enjoy IPA's, but this one disappointed me a little."
"D Its a cask beer, it doesn't get much better. I had the Alma NW Pale on cask and liked it better. I'm not sure if the smokey flavor is from malt, a part of the yeast profile, or soemthing else. Interesting. 4"
"Half finger white head, quick dissipation, some lacing. Light amber clear body, some visible streams of carbonation rising from bottom of my plastic OBF mug. Nose features a frickin' huge hop hit, pretty citrusy, along with some sweetish malts. Taste is also quite sweet, more tropical than citrus, guava, with some peppery resin in the finish, fairly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium, some effervescence. A tasty one-off and fairly unique hop bill (I believe this is 100% Citra hops). Worth a try for all hopheads."
"This IPA pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose... mama mia! This is an incredibly aromatic and skunky IPA. Wow! There is also some dank earth and dirt, but the skunky MJ aroma is nearly overpowering and overwhelming. Flavors replicate the nose to some extent (obviously, the beer does not taste skunky), with just enought sweet malt to buoy the boatload of hoppy bitterness and pine. This is a very flavorful and dry IPA otherwise, with a long, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, with the beer showcasing a fairly long, almost mouthpuckeringly bitter finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though the huge, hoppy flavor profile was almost too much of a good thing. Still, it's hard not to be impressed with this totally over the top, in your face IPA. Impressive to see a brewery the size of Deschutes pushing the envelope with a beer like this."
"Drinkability is good, a nice IPA with loads of flavor. Just a tad too grainy for me to really love though."
