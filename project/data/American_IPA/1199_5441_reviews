"Founders Centennial is a great beer from Founders Brewing Co. The Centennial hops give this beer an exotic taste that I always recommend. Founder's does a great job of giving their beer a unique taste, and these specific hops really make the beer unique."

"I returned to the kitchen and poured the rest of the beer in a proper glass, this one is too good to suck out of a bottle. One of the most delightful beers I've had since Bell's Two Hearted. A world class beer."

"Served in an IPA glass. Great color and smooth finish. Hard to find a good IPA in Nashville and this is the best so far."
"Color is dark gold, almost amber.  It's hazy with a one finger cream head that dissipates into clumpy islands.  Decent lacing.  Smell is earthy hops and biscuit.  Smells like a hops cookie.  Taste is similar - it has a lot of sweetness that balances the earthy hop flavors.  Finish is mildly bitter.  Body is lighter than I expected with ample carbonation.  Overall, it's very drinkable, but being a hop-head it's a little on the sweet side for my tastes."

"Bronze-coloured, very malty, too strong for me."

"I don't really LOVE it..."
""
"Excellent taste from start to finish. One of my favorite IPAs"
""
""
"Born on 12/16/14, gone 03/16/15. Not overly appealing on the smell. The taste is what did it for me - a real smooth one that stays with you. Glad I splurged a bit to try this one."
"O: not very complex; not much malt character;"
""
""
"First and only beer I've ever tried that gave a distinct taste that I can only describe as ""Windex."""

"Amazing, excellent feel and smooth. Pizza and fish."
""

"Weak aroma, on the malty side"

"Very Easy drinking iPad, poured into glass from a can"

"A bit too bitter for my tastes."
""
"founders as this one dialed in!"
""
""
""
""
"Edit: March 8, 2015. I tried this beer again, dated January 31, 2015, and it is much better than when previously consumed. I'll up the smell & taste to a 4.5. This is probably going to be my go-to beer for anything but sampling, or special occassions."
""
""
"I love the overall hop profile. It's not overbearing at all, very easy to drink. The hop taste lingers in your mouth after a drink of this beer. A lot of floral notes. Great IPA."
""
""
""
"From here on out I will refrain myself from IPA's. Spare both world and self."

"12oz bottle poured into nonic. Hazy orange liquid with a two finger eggshell head. Some lacing. Aroma is caramel, muted citrus fruit, grass, and bready malt. Flavor is caramel sweetness and some grapefruit flesh and peel, bread, and pine hop resin. I expected a more pronounced hop profile based on other reviews. I’ll chalk it up to the fact that this beer was bottled in September and I drank it in February. Medium body, slick but resinous texture, average carbonation, long bitter finish. I’ll try a fresher one and see if it helps."
"Hazy golden-orange pour with dense finger of white head. Aromas of heavy pine and grapefruit, with some malty sweetness peeking through. Flavor is similar, with hops at the forefront, but by mid-sip, giving way to malt. The retail description is apt regarding the finish - one of the most balanced, cleanest, mellowest of any IPA I’ve had. Well done!"

"The best IPA ever made.....and you can take it camping in cans!"
""
""
""
"Medium amber color. Floral aroma hop smell with apple hints. Bittering hops run through this brew's veins, and malty sweetness compliments it very well. Great brew"
"Draft. Really happy with it tonight."
"Love the hop profile and balance in this beer. Really impressed."
"Drink this one, you really won't regret it."
"I enjoy this no big grapefruit bomb this has citrus Carmel and pine very well done  bottle date 10/21/14"
""
""
""
"Beautiful color, relatively dark for an IPA.  Smell is not piney or fruity, subdued.  Great feel, slightly bitter.  Right up my alley really, could accidentally drink a lot of it!  ;)"
"Most anything else I've had from Founders has been exceptional, though."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Founders makes good stuff.  Centennial is no exception.  Recommended."
""
"Nice amber color. Citrusy with a nice piney backbone and malty finish. Not too dry. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Bottle was solid 2.5 months old so factor that in. Used to think I liked this more than two hearted but tastes a bit too dry and bland. Not in love with centennial hops in general."
""
""
"This beer was delicious.  I would call this and english style ipa. It has a noticeable malt backbone and copper color. I definitely tasted some caramel notes. The hop flavor and nose are there but subdued compared to a west coast style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall pretty tasty.  I don't think I would call this dank, but it certainly isn't a fruity hoppy flavor either.  Simply put this IPA isn't messing around and seems fairly straightforward and serious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A traditional but nicely balanced IPA with typical American hop characteristics. Other examples have more interesting and fresher hop notes but as a stalwart the Centennial is pretty solid and has a nice balance."
""
""
"Not a big fan of the taste"
""
""
""
"Yummy beer for my tummy here!"
""
"Me like this beer. It good all year. Me like to pour it into mouth."
""
""
""
"O - What a fantastic beer.  So tasty and drinkable.  This will become standard for me now that I can buy it here on the east coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pine and citrus, well balanced, clean finish"
""
"Excellent, mild IPA. Low bitterness, fruity notes and crisp, light mouthfeel. Will likely be my new go to IPA when I want something easy to slam with a big meal"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't stand the aftertaste this leaves. Prefer others.  I think this beer is overrated by the crowd.  Founders Dirty Bastard has the same problem."
"O: Definitely hop forward. Not *as* in your face as some American IPAs, but it's still very hoppy. Not one I'd give to a new IPA drinker who is still figuring Hops out. Very nice overall and I'd certainly get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hands down one of my favorite beers"
""

"Beautiful, citrusy with floral accents."

"This is a fantastically simple, easy going IPA; it's a welcome reprieve from all the in-your-face IPAs that have inundated the market lately. There are not many times that there are legitimately great looking beers too, but this beer looks great in a glass. Brilliant reddish amber, perfectly translucent, with turbid effervescing bubbles. A crown of pillow like head sites atop. Very appealing and appetizing. Smell is sweet hops, honey and pineapple. Rate is extremely well balanced, hops forward with a sweet and earthy finish. Not overly bitter. Feel is light with bright carbonation. Overall one of the most well balanced and easy drinking ipas I've had."
""
"Overall: Nice IPA, held up very well considering it was almost two months old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not care for it."
""
"Quite good overall.  My main complaint is that the hop flavors tend toward onions and dank rather than grapefruit and flowers."
"Overall: Nice flavorful IPA. Not sure about world class - would take MBC's Lunch over this for sure - but it's quite good."
""
""
""
"over all a nice ipa"
""
""
""
"Very balanced. Fruity smell with fruity taste and nice amount of hoppy bitterness."
"Overall: Great beer that isn't shy.  Even better on tap, in my experience.  In the battle of the great Michigan IPAs, I'll take this one over Two Hearted, 3 out of 5 times; the latter is more delicate whereas this is more of a boss."
"Solid IPA from founders, one of America best."
""
"Holy cats. Solid body, great taste. Founders does it again"
""
""
""
"A rich zesty ipa with little to no head with a strong noticeable hop flavor"
"This is a good beer. Do not agree with world class, but definitely enjoyable. I have had many IPAs that were better, but tasty none the less"
""
"very good ipa, good amount of hops"
""
"One of my go to IPAS"
""
""
"Had a barrel of this while harvesting a quarter acre of centennial hops. Great brew..."
""
"Looks fine, orange Amber color. Darker than your normal ipa. Smell is faint but of onions, pine and resin. Taste is scarcely bare able. Strong astringent onions and garlic. Terrible syrupy pine sap and pine cones linger on the palate. I've heard a lot of people comment that Founders Centennial IPA would struggle with west coast distribution bc it can't stack up to west coast IPAs. It's even worse than that, this is just a poorly crafted ipa that tastes like from an amateur brewery. Really a challenge to finish."
""
"Just doesn't hold up against the competition. I expected more from it."
""
"From the bottle, a fairly deep amber color, almost copper, with a nice one inch head. It has a strong fresh hop aroma that suggests quite a bit of dry hoping. I found the taste more piney than citrus with little malt flavor. It has a lingering bitter mouthfeel. A good solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a good IPA, not sure if I'd classify as outstanding or world class"
""
"Poured from bottle. Very good IPA, worth a 6 pack, almost sessionable. 99 Bros rating surprised me, but it is well balanced. Not too hoppy, a bite of malt, and not too sweet."
"Delicious overall!  The only reasons I didn't rate even higher are the fairly strong citrus/grapefruit flavors and a bit of a weak hop nose. But these are simply nits on an otherwise awesome ipa!"
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite Michigan Beer from my favorite Michigan Brewery"
""
"Great amber color. Strong upfront hops with a smooth finish. Not bad."
"This is certainly not a world-class brew, but I do like it.  It has a strong hops forward taste.  I enjoy the bitterness on the mouthfeel.  It certainly ranks up there with other IPAs.  I would definitely buy again."
""
"Overall- A great IPA. Full of flavor and fresh tasting. Nice balance between the sweetness/bitterness. An all around flagship IPA for Founders."
""
"o - this is a great ipa, even though this was a little long in the tooth it held up extremely well."
""
"Almost the perfect IPA! Was a great chill beer."
""
""
""
""

"One of my wife & my all time favorite IPA's"

"Solid IPA. very hoppy but not chewy. Awesome"

"Pour is a deep copper with a two finger fluffy white head.  Aroma is piney, citrus hops with some malt sweetness.  Taste follows with pine, citrus, resinous flavors balanced by a touch of malt sweetness and biscuity malt.  Mouthfeel is medium and very drinkable.  Overall an earthy ipa with balance."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pineapple, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around outstanding complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Canned in August so almost 4 months old and still holding up well.  Some of the brighter hop aromas have faded a touch, but still is a great beer - The cans are what to look for - held up really well even though it is a bit long in the tooth"

"Got this in a bottle for a change from my normal IPAs. Pours a nice orange dark with some aroma of malt and bread. Not very grapefruity or citrusy like some IPAs. No head as such after beer settles. Nice balanced taste and not too bitter or sweet. In my brain I'm probably comparing this to Sierra Nevada Torpedo and all in all a very nice beer at a nice price and nice easy drinker (maybe too easy). Would definitely recommend and will try again"

"Coming from a hop head...I have had better IPA's.What this one has going for it, is that it is super balanced and drinkable....my opinion of course..no doubt this is a good beer but i would not put it into the world class category by any means."

"One if my favorite IPA's huge hop aroma and flavor but beautifully complimented by a strong malt backbone.  Love the balance of this beer and the way the hop aroma hits your nose before every sip.  Very enjoyable beer but watch out...a few of these will bite ya.  Salute."

"Poured straight from the tap at Founders Brewery in Grand Rapids, MI this beer puts you in all sorts of enlightened moods. The crisp flavor that distinctly surrounds a hearty ABV settles on the pallet leaving you contemplating if it can get much better. An excellent IPA brewed by some of the best in the business. All I have to say is Thank You!"

" This is a fine IPA that I will definitely get again. As I drank, it grew on me. The reason I say this is because I tend to prefer an intense hop aroma and taste in my IPAs. However, this beer has exposed me to examples of IPA in which the hops is not so powerful and more subtle. I would also like to add that I'm currently drinking this one without food and after a hard day at work; the result is a beautiful buzz that is making me forget all the nonsense I had to put up with today. Thanks Centennial IPA! :)"

"After a few sips of those centennial hops, the tongue wakes-up and the pleasure begins.  Not too hoppy and just the right balance of sweetness.  If you like Sierra' Nevada""s Torpedo - this blows it away."

"Though I am new to reviewing my beers I really like this one.  It has a strong character yet it is very drinkable with a cornucopia of citrus and malty flavors.  It does tend to sneak up on you with a relatively high alcohol content so it is a shame that I can only have a couple before I am pretty buzzed."

"Poured into a pint glass, it has a nice one finger head which settles into a lasting cap.  Leaves a lacy ring around the glass after each sip.  Beautiful copper orange with a hint of peach color.  Smells delicious; slightly floral but not offensively so.  Hints of citrus. Love the smell of centennial hops.   Slight sweetness which is balanced out with a nice malt and hint of tartness. One of my top ten IPAs. Excellent goto beer.  Been with us at the cabin several times and I never get tired of it.  Have yet to be disappointed with a Founder's beer."

"Poured into a pinto glass with a good white head.  Orangish copper color with slight cloud.  Hoppy smell but has a good malt scent as well.  More a smell I pick up some citrus and floral scents.  Like the smell it's got a great balance between hops and malts with a bitter after taste that lingers.  Very floral grassy and slight citrus taste.  Medium body with medium carbonation.  Fantastic beer!"

"O- One of the first West Coast IPAs I had that got me into the style and I must say it holds up pretty well from what I remember.  Very traditional to the style with perhaps a bit more malt character than usual for the style, but just as big on the hop flavor and bitterness as you’d expect."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper colored pour with a dense and creamy off-white one-finger head. Really nice citrusy hop aroma. Taste has a nice piney hop flavor but also a really strong caramel malt presence. Medium body also has distinct rye flavor and just a hint of pepper. Finishes dry with a bit of resin and light pepper."

"A very nice IPA. The appearance was light orange with a head that lasted a while then left trails down the glass. The smell was really nice with a lot of floral and herb components. The taste was full of hops that left a very nice even taste that ended in an enjoyable crisp finish. The mouthfeel was also nice. For an IPA at seven percent, it was delightfully medium bodied with a refreshing amount of fizz. Would definitely recommend."

"If you're a hop-head, you'll like this one. If you like balance or complexity, not so much. (I like balance, so while I can appreciate the resinous, tangy hops, it was too one-dementional for my palate.)"

"Final Grade: 4.33, an excellent A grade. Founders Centennial IPA is well-renowned amongst hopheads for very good reason. Crisp and sharp with an intense blast of citrusy hops, this is one of the finest IPAs I have tried in my 8-or-so years on this site - easily outclassing many Ontario staples. Great stuff, I'm sure I'll be buying this one in larger quantities in the future. Well worth a look if you can find fresh bottles."

"O: While I found this to be a wonderful IPA, I feel as though it suffered a little due to being nearly two months old. With that being said, I can only imagine how delightful it would be to drink a fresh bottle. Even with it falling out of its prime age, Centennial IPA is a world-class example of the style and will be finding its way back into my purchases, without hesitation."

"Pours a clear copper color, with a thin off-white head. Aromas of freshly cut pineapple and a bit of brown sugar. Taste begins with some pine needles, then a hint of toasted bread, followed by citrus peel, and a massive resinous pine finish. Mouthfeel is smooth. Overall an excellent IPA, though I prefer more citrus over the pine."

"12 oz bottle into willy glass. This is a really good IPA. The color is clear yellowish amber with an adequate slowly-fading off-white head. The aroma is nicely fruity and floral mixed with some bready malt. Taste is really good - seems quite complex for a single hop. I must really like Centennial. It seem like the ideal hop flavor mixed nicely with caramel notes in this beer. Mouth feel is especially nice ...just the right balance of sweet malt body and carbonation. Overall, a surprisingly good IPA at a decent price point."

"O: A fantastic everyday IPA for the IPA lover. It isn't the best smelling IPA I have ever had, or the best tasting, or the best looking, but it does everything well, and that is something that very few IPAs can muster. Top that off with an incredibly drinkable profile and a big 7.2 ABV and you have a winner. Kudos to Founders."

"I just finished a keg (1/2 barrel) of this beer. Took me about 3 months and never changed taste or appearance. This is my favorite beer. This, in my opinion, is the best beer ever made. The taste is piney, bitter, floral, resin, and oily. Complex yet simple. The smell is piney and floral. Large head on tap pour that last forever. Lots of lacing. HUGE taste. Most of my friends did not like it. They are lager bud light types. If you don't like this beer, it's not the beer it's the style, you won't like any IPA's. They are not for everyone. The beer snobs however will testify that this is one of the benchmarks that is easily obtainable. Excellent beer!"

"o. Taste rules - this beer is tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - medium carbonation, very smooth going down and hides the alcohol well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a reddish-amber beer with a medium but highly frothy head on top. The nose gives off nice notes of citrus, lightly resin hops, though not much malt scent. Taste though, shows better balance... much better. There's a substantial malt component, nice and sweet, though there's also a big balancing bitterness and, of course, a load of hop flavor. This is a fine IPA with interest beyond just hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
"O-Not bad but didn't quite do it for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My bottle is a year+ old, and even though it was stored well, I think it changed slightly towards sweetness and alcohol compared to the average reviews here. I get a fair amount of caramel on the nose along with the hops, and it goes down with a slightly sticky sweet aftertaste."
""
""
"No hop characteristics in the aroma, a bit of caramel over heavy malt with a touch of booze. The taste carries this beer big time! More strong malt taste balanced with a bit more hop character, strong pine, caramel, and toffee. Not much carbonation, smooth mouthfeel with resinous aftertaste. Flavors come together wonderfully as this beers warms a touch."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an extremely well done IPA. Complex and fruity with a surprisingly good malt underbelly. The hops are the star and are FRESH but it allows the malty sweetness to come out and play. Truly a joy to drink. for an added treat, let it warm for 10 minutes and then you'll get more of the malt coming through. My guess is a nice pale ale malt with a medium crystal. It reminds me of an English ESB with a big hop kick. Founders never disappoints!"
""
""
""
"Overall - An IPA that's great in every sense. Well balanced, but the lingering citrus aftertaste gives it that hoppy kick it needs while still retaining a ""chuggable"" quality. Get this if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great IPA worthy of it's praise!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: There is a sweet doughy and bready maltiness laying down a nice base for big hop explosion. The hops bring solid bitterness and floral orange blossom and citrus to the mix. I also pick up a candy like fruity sweetness pooping in and out. It finishes slowly with a more herbal like hop bitterness."

"One last sip before I go away: yeah, I stand by this review. Sealed and approved."
""
"I really like this beer. It is made using centennial hops, which I think gives it great flavor. It has a very nice aroma that consists of grapefruit and some other types of citrus fruit. The taste is very pleasant on my tongue and you can definitely taste the hops, as well as the citrus notes. It does have a bit of an aftertaste, but it's a pleasant aftertaste. I'd definitely recommend it."
""
""
"A decent beer with a beautiful dark golden color. Head is decent(average). Carbonation is good but anymore and it would take away from the flavor. Nice hoppy-citrus flavors and maybe a little bitter orange towards the finish. Overall, in the top 50% of beers I have tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent IPA overall, although I feel like I’ve slightly overrated this one."
"Overall: I will put this in the earthy ipa category opposed to bright fruits, which they pulled off pretty well. Nice balanced taste and even more so in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, I'm more of a fan of the bright tropical fruit characterstics, such as DirtWolf, Enjoy By, Head Hunter, etc. and will most likely choose those over this. However, this has its time and place and will have this again for my piney, sweet malt IPA needs."

"On tap at McNellie's OKC. Pours a deep amber with a foamy white head. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is of malt, pine and caramel. Those three follow to taste. Nice and malty, and the bitterness builds in the aftertaste instead of hitting you in the face. Medium mouth with just a bit of oil. This is a nicely balanced IPA."

"O - Amber malt with light fruity hops. Meh."
""
""
""
"Severed out of a bottle and in a glass. Poured clear orange amber. Very little head that dissipated quickly. Smelled grassy and hoppy. Tasted citrus, malt, and pine. Had a great bitterness level. Carbonation normal. Great after taste. Drank it quickly and had another."

"Pours clear amber with medium sized light tan head that doesn't last for long. Aroma is very earthy with hints of pine and grass. Tastes pretty much the same. Taste includes pine, grass, and hints of citrus. This beer contains average carbonation with a slightly bitter, but pleasant, aftertaste."
""
""
"Pours a copper-ish color with good sized white head. Generous amount of aromas come off this beautiful pour, with a lot of herbal notes being quite assertive, plus some citrus in background. Also grassy, and some pine. Palate is a gorgeous balance of malt with the juicy hops that bring in more delightful herbal qualities, sharp citrus, and a light toasty malt component. Interplay of flavors is outstanding. Very drinkable, and incredible with sharp cheeses."
""
"O - An absolutely stellar East Coast IPA. I really enjoyed the interplay of the fruitiness of the hops with the sweeter malts. Lush and juicy. Definite rebuy."
""
""
""
""

""

"I would drink a few of these outside before a ball game. I don't think I'd ever buy a case of it though. I've had plenty of better IPAs."
"Oh, if only I could get this regularly... I've always been a fan of Stone Brewery products, but when I just happened across Founder's All Day IPA, I was a convert, but their products are hard to find in my area. I found a 12-pack of Centennial IPA on an out of state trip, where the Founder's app on my phone convinced me to try it. Everything you'd want in an IPA, with the right balance of hops and malt. I like Founder's products so much I'm going for a tour of their brewery."
"This is a very good IPA, but it is nothing special. There are so many IPAs on the market right now that is is difficult to differentiate the characteristics between all of them. I am enjoying IPAs mixed with other things right now, but this is definitely one of my fall back options for a solid IPA."
""
""
"Poured a gorgeous clear amber with a one-finger white head that receded to a quarter finger of head that left some sticky lacing. A very nice, true to style IPA appearance. Scents of orange, sweet, honey-like malt and some subdued grassy and floral hop aromas that dissipate as the beer sits. The orange and malt aromas stay throughout and grow in intensity. A very nice, simple, appealing aroma that entices you to drink. Flavor begins with a modest level of hop bitterness, with notes of pine resin, citrus zest and floral hops, and a nice, sweet, caramel malt backbone. This moves into a more pronounced hop flavor, with more citrus zest and pine resin, but still with a nice malt backbone. The finish is dry and brings in pepper-like flavors, alongside some pine resin and floral and earthy hops with a lighter, though still present, caramel. Aftertaste is toasted grain, pepper, pine resin and floral hops. A very nice flavor profile, balanced yet still packed with hop flavor. The combination of just enough malt and just enough hops makes it a near perfectly balanced, extremely drinkable package. Excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky, slightly resinous and chewy with a light level of carbonation. Very nice, quite easy to drink and very smooth. Very well done. Overall this is an excellent IPA that combines an excellent balance of flavors with a wonderful mouthfeel. The aroma is the weakest aspect of this beer, yet even that is above average. A truly excellent example of an IPA."
"Lots of flavor to this well made and crafted IPA. Can't wait to try this on tap along with the other offerings from Founders."

"O - A decent, restrained IPA that focuses on balance over fruit bombs. A good choice if ultra-bitter brews puts you off of modern IPAs."
""
"I am slotting this beer on my #2 IPA shelf, only because I tend to favor more hoppy less malty IPAs. However, this IPA is extremely well balanced. Aroma is of bready malt with a bit of orange and citrus. The taste is very smooth, the sweetness and hops compliment each other nicely. This is a very drinkable IPA, just not one of my absolute favorites."
"I can tell this is an older school IPA. It is easy on the pine, grapefruit, and zest. This beer gets a high drinkability rating from me. A subdued IPA which would make it a go-to IPA for me. If only they sold it in Washington..."
"Overall: Excellent beer that I could sit down and enjoy multiples of. Really enjoyed this one, well balanced IPA that invites me to keep drinking more. Nothing extreme, just an exceptionally solid brew. Highly recommend this one."

"O: This is one of those great IPAs that manages to please the drinker with a boatload of hop flavor, yet counter it perfectly with a malt body that holds its own. It strikes the perfect balance between hop bitterness and malty sweetness, and is absurdly drinkable because of this. This is tasting amazing coming from the can."

"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. Packaged on 7/1/14. Hint: This was NICE and fresh (love those cans). Looked slightly hazy, with 2 fingers of off-white head. Nice light amber color. The aromas were excellent (4.5/5 for me!)... pine, grapefruit, some elusive floral hints, goodness... I smelled this beauty when I cracked the can (so glad there is another in the fridge!). Taste was also spot on. There was the nice floral hit (kind of new to me in IPAs), nice even bitterness, and not malty, or heavy... nice and refreshing (even at 7.2). Really nice balance of flavor all around. The finish was clean and crisp, and it was relatively light on the palate. Overall, what can I say... it is a winner. Hope these cans become more readily available in Western PA. This would be a fridge stocker for me."

Duh, you may say, but it's one of those things where I know they have great beer and am still blown away by just HOW good they are each time I crack a new bottle. Centennial isn't up there with the most talked about American IPAs, but it certainly deserves to be."

"O- An amazing one hop IPA. Not as sweet as Two-Hearted, but just as delicious."
"Nice golden yellow orange body with a creamy white head and lace that doesn't go away. Fresh hops and spices through the nose, very thick. Taste is a wonderful display of hop character, a little grapefruity and a little sweetness somewhere hidden. Malt can't break through and the aftertaste is a nice oily hop resin bitterness all over the palate. Very drinkable, ABV very well hidden."

""

"Taste starts with sweet floral hops, then caramel malts and more sweetness, with a bitter, citric rind finish. Has a bitter, sweet and floral, citric rind aftertaste that lingers nicely, This beer is sweeter than I usually like with an IPA, but Founders pulls this one off with great success. Mouthfeel is average for an IPA with a bit above average carbonation, a little creaminess."

"Another review on-tap: A fingers' worth of deep-tan/light brown head upon arrival. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a faint citrus grapefruit quality, but not overwhelmingly so I assumed that this was a varietal, using Centennial hops, as opposed to any of the other five (5) C's-Columbus, Chinook, Cascade, and xxx. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild citrus hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was dry, even a bit musty. Danny postulated that it might be sessionable, but I'll reserve judgement until I know its ABV. Still, a good eye-opener at 1100 on a Sunday."
""
"Overall- Despite it not being my favorite type of beer, I still found it somewhat enjoyable to drink."

"Had a pint of this amber colored IPA. Poured from tap into an ice cold pint glass. I'm trying this on an empty stomach as this is the best way to savor an IPA as there is very few cuisine that it pairs well with other than spicy dishes. As I'm drinking this it's leaving rings on the pint glass. More on the citrus side for the aroma as opposed to pine. Too much of a lingering after taste on this one. As far as IPAs go ones with a clean finish are the best. I'm going to opposite direction of the crowd on this one although they make a killer breakfast stout and porter. On the east coast for this genre of beer there's a lot better out there."

"Excellent selection from a brewery which never disappoints. Pours a cloudy copper color with a generous off-white head. Smells of grapefruit and a little grass. Sips well, very smooth for an unfiltered ale. Not particularly hoppy more malty than most ipas. Definitely has a bit of an alcohol bite but is very well balanced. Overall, an excellent offering from an excellent brewery."

"Color is dark golden, nicely carbonated and a white rich, but not big head. Good retention with lacing of the glass. Aroma has a hint of sour with a light floral/citrus hop undertone and a caramel malt presence. Tasting revealed a well balance brew with moderate bitterness. I know it's called Centennial but I'm thinking I taste some Cascade maybe as a bittering addition. On the front end the maltiness comes through quickly moving to a grassy hoppiness. There is a citrusy rise and finishes with a dry, lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue. Excellent example of an AIPA and while a bit bigger than their All-Day IPA, Founders has created one of the best Pale Ale series in the market."

""

"This is a good beer, but that's all it is. I would happily enjoy one anytime just nothing too special about it. With that said, some may prefer this sort of IPA over others..it's a little lighter, not too bitter, and a bit more citrusy/ sweeter. Ill certainly have another in the future, but it wouldn't be my first option."

"Brilliant amber color with a bit of an orange tone. A thin cap of foam rests on top. Citrus hop aroma with a hint of orange in the aroma. The mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but otherwise considering the strength it is quite quaffable. The flavor has a trace of orange that blends fairly well with the citrus hops. I think the flavor of this hop is not a personal favorite, but I'll take it over Nelson Sauvin hops any day."

"O - 4.00 - I think this beer stands out from the rest in it's own way. It has a noticeable malt backbone to it, but not nearly like Dogfishhead 60 or 90 minute, which I consider a good thihg. At the same time it's not as much of a hop punch in the face as Ruination, Pliny, or Hop Stoopid."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: With so many IPAs out there, Founders Centennial fails to stand out despite the fact that it is a very good beer in its own right. I would absolutely order it again, but only on the off-chance that a less desirable option was available."

"Medium bodied with an adequate hop bitterness covering a slight undertone of malt. Finishes clean with a noticeable bitterness that lingers but isn't overpowering. Very nice citrus hop flavor. A sound IPA that doesn't just rely on hop bitterness to be to style."

"I remember this taste now. I recall not liking this alot the first time, but now I see where this is a great IPA upon trying it a couple of years later (and after more tasting ""experience""). The piney fresh hops cascade throughout my mouth, and then just when I think a malt-based letdown would suddenly cut-off the hop nirvana, it creeps through again, steady and flavorful! I see how well-balanced this accomplished brew is. What stands out about the hops are how fresh they taste. Tropical/ orange. Nothing is too much here. Bitter in the end, but right. Medium carbonation, smooth. Definitely tasty, worthy."

"The appearance,smell and taste of this IPA is right up there with some of the more well known ones. I don't find the bitterness too high if your looking for it in your IPA but it's a well balanced beer with a good lasting head. Nice beer wouldn't even know it packed 7.2 ABV."

"o: An exceptional IPA, rich and flavorful."
""
"Pours a lovely, slightly murky orange-gold. Really appetizing. Scent is rather subdued. A mild citrus. Taste is a great balance of hops and malt. Years ago I couldn't believe how hoppy this seemed. Now with all the hop bombs out there this seems truly mild. This is an IPA for those who like their malt. The mouthfeel may be its best quality: a light carbonation with a slightly oily texture. Goes down well."
""
""
"O: nice IPA, and for sure one I will seek out in the future. Definitely rocks the palate and needs a water after to fully cleanse it. I would try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- One of my favorites that I needed to post a review for. Nothing too exterme but a classic IPA in my book. Cheers!"
""
""
"Just started getting this in my area. The Centennial IPA is a great hop heavy IPA with a balanced malty back bone. From pour to drinking you will smell hops, but you will not feel that the beer is all hops thanks to the malt. The hop character is not super piney, so you can really get into the complexity of the beer. I am glad to see it in our area."
"O: This beer is one that I feel fits the ""go-too"" beer category, much like my current one x2IPA. It is easy to drink ,of decent ABV, very drinkable, and sweet yet quite hoppy. A well deserved 4\5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me, one of the best beers available. More floral than bitter and has a ""wall of flavor"". For the aroma. to the first taste and mouth feel the beer has great flavor. The bitterness and sweetness are a perfect compliment. Though I tend to overlook to try ""new"" beers, when I do go back I'm always amazing about how great it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everyone else has had a ""lingering head"" or ""off-white head"" or ""white head"" or ""head"" to their pour. This one had none of that. Red flag, maybe. I'm going to chalk this one up to being a subpar or old batch of the Centennial, because I really did want to like it."

"A decent IPA. It's probably suffered from the tyranny of long-distance travel and Founders will want to work with their Australian importer to speed that process up."

Until I got close to the package I did not notice it was angels lifting the beer into the heavens and I can say they did not disappoint. GREAT BEER."

"Full and refreshing with a nice depth that compliments food really well. A really balanced fruity IPA that has plenty of good qualities. This is not an overly bitter IPA but full of complexity and balance. This is a standout for sure."
"Pours a clear orange amber hue with a fluffy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is predominantly freshly picked Valencia oranges mixed with torn lemon leaves and grapefruit,the mouthfeel is a tad lack lustre it's just medium bodied with average carbonation and has tastes of strong Valencia oranges,grapefruit,lychee,passionfruit,a little cameo of toffee malts but boy it's brief and finished with a citrus bitterness and overall it's loaded with hops but I feel the mouthfeel lacks and could be abit more balanced cheers."

"Pours hazy amber/honey color with three finger width foamy head. There is great head retention and lacing on the side of the glass. Well balanced malty and hoppy aroma with hints of citrus. Malty taste up front with an excellent transition to a grassy hoppy bitterness. There are some citrus notes somewhere in there. Nice, lingering bitter aftertaste. This is definitely one of my favorite IPAs."
"One of my favorite IPAs from a bottle. You can get it at the local grocery store here in Michigan I have had it at one bar only that had it on tap and that was the first taste for me. One of my first IPAs. Not too bitter for a beginner. Have never been disappointed."
""
"Overall: A great IPA. I'd be curious to see what a fresher one tastes like. In terms of IPA's from Michigan, I personally think that Bell's Two Hearted wins above this one. Trying Shorts Huma-Luma-Licious sometime in the next few days, so we will see how that stacks up."

"Poured into McDonald's collector glass (I'm...away from my glassware at the moment). Slightly cloudy amber/orange with a thinner white head that sticks around and leaves nice lacing. Smell is attenuated fruity/herbal hops with hefty crackery malts behind it. Taste is a glorious mix of spicy, herbal and fruity hops with crackery malt with some sweetness. Very complex, alcohol is a little noticeable but it is a stronger IPA. Still incredibly drinkable, excellent beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-full."

"Mouthfeel is really good. Strong medium bodied and a nice carbonation level. Pretty smooth and like many things Founders brews, it just has a high quality feel to it. It's very well balanced starting off with some slight sweetness and goes to a nice bitter finish that is mostly clean, a little zesty. Overall a really good IPA, I feel it's one of the less talked about year round IPAs. Another really good brew from Founders."

"Bright coppery orange in the glass with a one finger off white head of tiny bubbles that throw a lot of lace during the session. This is all IPA in the nose, the hop aromas are almost sticky. The hops here run the full gamut from citrus to floral and herbal and everything in between. In the taste the hops of course are the focus. The citrus flavors dominate with a plenty of bitterness in there as well. There is still a considerable malt base in this beer, enough to balance the hops keeping it from running away and becoming difficult to drink. Speaking of which this is a very nice drinking IPA. The finish is just a touch sweet with a long lasting bitterness that sits on the tongue until you take the next sip. Overall a very good IPA good for a session but complex enough to drink slow and enjoy."

"Smooth for the style, easily drinkable. Hop bite up front, clean finish.The 7.2% ABV is not noticeable at all, that could be a problem for some. I could consider this a sessionable beer, though most wouldn't. Grab one if you can, this is a really good brew."
"Overall- I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to buy this beer, but it's a well balanced IPA with some components beyond straight hops. I loved the texture of the beer. It also seemed to have a temperature threshold once it warmed a bit where it really came alive before mellowing back down with further warming. A nice IPA for groups, enough bite for the hopheads out there ripping your head off."

"After initial disappointments with their pale ale and All Day IPA, it seems Founders delivers the goods here in terms of hoppy paled ales with this one. Definitely a lot more like a East Coast IPA in terms of delivering a lot of earthy, malty syrup, but it's dank and fruity enough on the hoppy side to hold interest the whole way through. I could definitely have a bunch of these in a row, just like SN Torpedo. Hope I can try this fresher one day, as I'd imagine the pine would really jump out then. Recommended a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: A somewhat regular buy for me, while it's no Two-Hearted, this is one of the better IPAs from Michigan. More malts than your average IPA in my opinion, but it makes for a very smooth beer. Can't go wrong with any Founders really."

Can't go wrong with this one.  I think I buy it about every other time I'm out for beer -- even if I'm picking up a little something else.  Maybe that makes me bias, but hey I'm from Grand Rapids, so I don't mind!"

"I poured this into a glass, it has a dark amber color body with a small white head that hangs out for a minute. The aroma has a nice malt and flora aroma to it. The taste has a very nice sweet malt flavor, which follows by citrus flora hop. The mouthfeel is really good and overall a really good drinking ipa."

Nice bitter hop flavor with fruit and citrus with more caramel in the background and a grapefruit peel finish. The beer is medium bodied with velvety carbonation and a smooth finish. This is an exceptional ipa, there is nothing bad to say about this brew. It's nice and balanced and hides the abv very well."
""
"Pours a beautiful, wondrous, deep, strong copper. Soft white head fades quickly. Hops and malts up front, with mild bitter and alcohol taste coming in at the of sip. Very easy to drink, with mild carbonation. Smell and taste fit perfectly, and pushes the overall experience to a new level."
""
"Mouthfeel - very very nice, moist and medium bodied. Doesn't leave the palate dry at all. Only a want for more."
""
"O- Overall, a worthwhile IPA. What it may lack in complexity, it makes up for in strong distinct flavors. However, as I finished it, I began to appreciate its subtle complexity more. This is just outside of my top 10 American IPA's, I would definitely pick this up again sometime."

"Poured from bottle into crooked stave tulip. Pours a deep amber burnt orange with some slight white head. Aromas of sweet candy hop mixed with sharp pine and a lot of malt backbone. Flavor of big malt maybe marris otter..with sharp bitter pine hop flavor. Finishes with some smooth sweet malt. Its a bit over bitter and over malty...more of an English ipa. Its a good ipa and can see why people like it but I like ipas with less sweet malt and a crisper smoothness."

"O - Not bad at all. If this was more accessible, and it may soon be with Founders coming to FL, I would drink it a lot. One of the better IPAs I've tasted in a while. Second Founders beer I've had, can't wait for the next."
""
""
"M - Mouth coating hop oil with a firm body. Long finish which is one of the best qualities of Centennial...is there anything this hop cannot do? It bitters, It's citrusy, it's floral"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extra fizzy off a hard pour. Ends with one-finger of dense tan head. Smells of oily hops, grapefruit, lemon and caramel. A bit of grass is also noticed. Tastes grainy with a backdrop of subdued hops and cotton candy. Somewhat chalky, medium bodied and drier than expected. Founders has never blown me away with thir beers I've tried, but this is another tasty beverage from this consistent brewery."

"This IPA is without question one of the best balanced and complex flavors that is one the market. The Founder’s Crew did an amazing job producing a beautiful color, great balanced taste, and still had that classic IPA flavor. Only drawback that I had was that the palate was a little bit lacking but still, amazing beer. Widely available, so give it a try. I just don't like piney IPA's"

"A very good beer and will probably include it as part of my rotation during the Spring. The beer is pretty balanced overall and goes well with most things."
""
""
""
""
"Centennial is dry and hoppy, the way an IPA should be. The aroma is not overpowering, like some of the higher-rated IPAs. I wish the flavor would linger more, but then again, I see the appeal of it remaining dry and finishing neat. This beer stands alone as a readily available IPA in my area, and it's an excellent option for people who want a clean night cap, without committing to a heavier Imperial."

"O - A lovely IPA. This is why we all love Founders. Centennial hops do a nice job when done right and Founders does this ipa to perfection. This has become one of my go to brews, and I'm looking forward to trying the bottles I bought. Great first experience with a growler."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another great offering by Founders. Just fantastic balance in this IPA. A lot going on with the intense flavors. Maybe even leans a bit too much towards the sweet malt base. Certainly one of my favorite IPAs that will be a go to brew for me."
""
""
""
"Hazy orange colour, about a finger of dense white head, some lace as well. Smell is all out citrus and tropical fruits up front, grapefruit being the most upfront, a bit of sweet bready malt, as it warms more citrus fruit in the way of orange, pineapple and mango. Taste is fruity, lots of bitter hops, lots of citrus fruit mostly grapefruit and orange, a bit of sweet malt mid palate, drying finish with long hoppy pineapple finish. Light-medium dry cabonation, medium body. I really enjoyed this, basically my ideal IPA here, something I would gladly drink a lot more of."

""
""
""
""
""
"O - Seems like I'm a superlative machine when it comes to Founder's, but as someone who's not really an IPA fan, they've got me wanting another of these. Very solid IPA, and instantly one of my favorites of the style."

"Smell was a bit subtle, but nice; classic centennial. The smell didn't carry over to taste though and I had to really work to taste the hops. It also had a touch of sourness to it and the carbonation didn't seem quite right. Not a bad beer at all, but I was disappointed, given what I'd read in other reviews. To be fair, this had been bottled 2 months ago. I'd like to try it again fresh and will re-review if I do. Overall, a decent ipa, but nothing to get excited about."

"Poured into tubulator glass, super sticky lacing and a golden amber color. Smells of alcoholicgrapefruit juice, kinda! Hoppy centennial scent but is balanced. Grapefruit, pine, oranges delicious ipa from midwest with west coast kick! Nice carb and hop kick with quality dry hop aftertaste. Overall I will revisit this ipa again and again when looking for sturdy ipa! Hides the 7.2 well!"

"This felt like a session beer even though it certainly wasn't, and it was only after I finished it that I could notice a slight buzz coming over me. While this was certainly an IPA, it had the qualities of a dry-hopped Pale Ale and went down as easily as such. I can't imagine any beer lover or hophead not enjoying and wanting to reach for another afterwards - I'll probably buy the full six-pack next time around!"

"o: very drinkable, very tasty IPA that offers a solid amount of bitterness without being over the top. although the malt backbone is balanced well against the hops, i would have enjoyed a little more hop flavor... this may be lacking due to age of the beer."
"notes; Incredibly well balanced with flavor, body and appropriate bitterness. I like this beer, the 2nd I've had from Founders. Does not push any boundaries but it is a very well crafted ale with a strong malt backbone and lots of flavor."

"Pours amber with low to medium frizzy head. Aroma is grapefruit, citrusy fruits and some caramel malts. Taste is malt at first transitioning to spicy hops. A very palatable bitterness coats the mouth and lingers pleasantly long after the last sip. Overall a very enjoyable IPA."

"Thin head, but exceptionally pleasing color. The bouquet is not particularly impressive. The beer tastes great, however. It's a robust big blend of grapefruit and roasted grain, with the citrus dominating. The beer's texture is superbly smooth and foamy. Just about perfect where it really counts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I like it. I usually stick to the dryer IPAs, but the balance on this one is spot on. For me, the drinkability does suffer a bit due to the sweetness and body, but it's definitely a great IPA."

"Amber color with one finger of head. No lacing on the glass. Nose is dominated by grapefruit and pine hop aromas, with a hint of pineapple. As expected, the flavor is very hop forward with citrusy and piney hops. Full bodied for an IPA. This is ok, but I've had better IPAs. I doubt I'd get this again."

"Pours dark orange with a nice white lace. The smell is the best part of the beer. It has a nice fresh hopped up smell and it gives you high expectations. The taste is just ok. I really want to like this cause I'm a huge Founders fan, but ultimately I need to be honest with myself and admit that this is a mid level IPA. There are many out there that are a bit smoother and have a nicer hoppy presence. This offering tend to leave a bitter aftertaste that keeps building. I've tried this on many different occasions and its always the same ending. Not a bad beer by any mean, but if I'm reaching for an IPA, I'm looking else where in this case."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle. The appearance was good. I smelled a nice citrus aroma along with a touch of pine and sweetbread. The beer poured a nice two finger head. I'm not going to get into all the details, but I thought it was a well-balanced IPA. A nice hop finish and I will definitely drink again. I drank it at Big Mike's in Brevard, North Carolina"

"O: Steriotypical american Ipa, and thats a complement. Big hop aromas and taste, quite bitter. Not for amateurs. real deal holyfield. Just what the doctor ordered to remedy a hop craving. Reminds me most of Smutty Finest Kind. Very solid overall IPA, a bit overpriced in mass."

"Bitter resiny taste. Hints of orange peel and grapefruit on a malty base. Mildly sweet and long lasting bitterness. It gets better with time and warmth, gets more fruity and revealing more flavors. Alcohol (7.2% ABV) is absolutely out of the picture. Good single hop IPA."
""
""

"Red-orange with a finger or two of eggshell white head. Good retention and lacing. Nose has some juicy fruit qualities, more tropical leanings and grapefruitwith regard to hop character and some grassy/pine that's more peripheral. Malt adds a great deal of balance, sweet with some caramel. Taste has more resiny hop character, bitter fruits and Big chunk of sweeter malt character again. A bit leafy and oily. Medium high bitterness, slightly heavier than medium body and lower medium carbonation. A nice single hopped IPA."
""
""
""
"Flavor is pine/citrus with a healthy dose of caramel and toast. Nearly perfect balance between malt and hops with neither one overpowering the other. Bitterness is moderate and quite smooth never becoming harsh. Very drinkable and truly one of the benchmark IPA's."
""
"O) This is a really solid IPA. There are probably a few readily available IPAs in my area that I'd reach for ahead of this one, but really not too many. If for some reason you haven't tried this brew yet, definitely give it a go. Glad to recommend... Cheers..."

"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I could easily session with it. I will definitely be buying it again!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The aroma opens up with nice citrus and floral notes. The color pours a hazy blonde with a half-inch of head. The beer tastes phenomenal. It has a nice hop taste that includes a fair amount of citrus, which tastes more like grapefruit. The beer is carbonated, but not heavy. Overall, another fantastic beer from one of my favorite breweries."

"Pleasant copper in color; light head; nice orange-smelling tones on the nose; robust lacing; lacing lasts through the entire beer; good balance of malt and hop; definitely hop-driven however; slightly minty but mostly hoppy...and clearly Centennial-hop forward; leaves a lot on the tongue after it's gone; kinda busy; a 'blue collar' IPA to me.

"Overall / Drinkability: A very well balanced AIPA. Hops certainly come out, but there is more than enough malt to counter all that potential bitterness. From start to finish this beer says balance and simple but good flavor. I could easily see myself having another. A bit dangerously drinkable as this one went fairly quickly. Finally, the more I think about this beer - each of its parts is just good, but combined, it's quite impressive and is more than the sum of its parts. I'll have to pick this up again."

"Founders Centennial IPA is a cloudy, amber ale with a soft, smooth, cream colored head that has great retention and lacing. It has a big, grassy, floral, fruity, pine aroma. It's medium bodied and smooth with a chalky finish. It has a nice, bitter, pine resin flavor. It tastes a little peppery with a hint of juniper. The pine bitterness lasts long after the finish. This is solid and bitter."
""
""
""
""
"This is what should define an American IPA. Never has another AIPA wowed me so much with it's complex-yet-simple flavor and aroma profiles quite like this one. At a perfectly tamed and masked 7.2% ABV, it remains so drinkable, also partially due to the wonderful checks-and-balances in flavors. I love this beer. The one major drawback, is that the beer must be very fresh. After 8 weeks from the bottling date, the hops really start to fade and the malt becomes overpowering. This is true for most IPAs, but I feel like it's more prominent in this one. It really shines when it's super fresh."

"This brew had been hyped up for me (not really available where I am), and while I wouldn't label it life changing it is certainly an excellent IPA. I would whole heartedly recommend finding it if you can and giving it a try."
"This poured with a single fingers head that was gone in seconds. It has a nice orange like copper coloring that is almost bright. The scent of this IPA is perhaps the nicest I have ever smelled. You can catch the floral, fruity, hoppy notes but it smelled like a lemon iced tea to me. Perhaps that is why I rate the taste lower is the anticipation. It fell rather flat as I got subtle hints of hops and citrus but it was rather unremarkable. I kept taking sip after sip waiting for it to live up to the scent and it never did."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The thing that's missing for me in this IPA is the juicyness that I tend to associate to some degree with that citrus flavor. Would I drink it again? Maybe. Founders makes a lot of other great beers that I'd pick over this one."
""
""
"O- One of the dryest IPA I'ver had, the flavors are fantastic, nice complexity of hops, malt, citrus and pine, sugary sweetness is unique, good stuff for sure."
"Overall, another high quality, affordable brew from Founders. Further solidifies them as my favorite brewery. They do the best stouts and now I can say they do good IPA, not to mention the rest in between."
""
"Nitro growler courtesy of the Beer Boutique on Brooklyn. Superb brew! This one is beautifully clear with with a thick head that is leaving a lot of lace on the glass.. Color is perfect is with a lot of darkness to the overall orange hue. head is light bone white and creamy. Nice sweet smell has caramel in abundance with a yeasty bread base that serves up the pine forrest of hops that color the nose. Taste follows with chunks of warm bread and toasted graininess. A dry citrus hops cuts in and stops the malt party. Hop oil lingers and seems to drip from the sides of my mouth and edges of my tongue. A light sweetness underpins the finish that brings full force to the multilayered hop bouquet. Grapefruit and pine, it runs the gamut. Feel is dry and crisp with a stickiness to a medium weight body. Carbonation is quite cask like with a mild effervescence that gives a silky, easy, drinkability. A delicious and desirable beer that makes itself a top pick in this category."

"D - I had a much better experience this time than I did on draft... A very solid very enjoyable American IPA and something worthy of the Founder's label... Surprisingly quaffable... While this isn't going to become one of my ""go to"" in the style class, it is something that I would gladly drink again and encourage all fan's of the style and the brewery to do as well..."
""
"This was a very nice IPA but didn't quite have the complexity of; say a SN Torpedo or a Stone IPA. Still a solid brew - just not quite what I was expecting in an IPA from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm on the fence with this one. In my opinion, it's not hoppy enough to be an IPA, but a little too hoppy to be a pale ale. I refuse to believe that a 2 1/2 month old bottle can fall off and lose so much flavor and aroma. This one's ok, but wouldn't seek out again."
"2-oz pour was a hazy orange with a half-inch of white head, and minimal lacing. Smelled slightly floral but strongly of citrus pith and resins. Taste was flavorful orange citrus pith, pine resins. Overall is moderately bitter on the palate. Medium body, creamy, nicely carbonated. Overall a nice flavorful IPA that benefits from dry hopping."
"O: Above average in all respects, but not outstanding. A good beer at a good value."

""

"D/O: This classic IPA recipe seems a bit old-fashioned by 2012 standards, but is strong in ways predictable to a Founders pale ale. Like other similar beers of the same origin, it finds strength in a well-positioned malt profile. Malt similarities make this beer seem, appropriately, like a scaled-up version of Founders Dry Hopped Pale Ale. The world may be ready, however, for the double- or triple dry-hopped version of this beer."
"O: I had to update my review on this beer because the first bottle I had was bad. Overall, it was a good IPA. Definitely is not my favorite, but it is different than a lot of the others I've tasted. I've never quite had an IPA as floral and herbal as this one and it made for a good drink. I would definitely have this beer again."
""
""
""
"This is some good stuff. It pours up a magnificent clear copper with a two finger white head, good retention and extensive and elaborate lacing. The smell is citrus and pine. Mouthfeel is perfect with a little carbonation. Taste is grapefruity on the front and bitter hops on the finish, both strong, but perfectly balanced. This is some good stuff, but I already said that."

"Pours a hazy, dark golden, almost amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is strong floral and citrus notes. Taste is complex, floral and citrus right away followed by a nice malt sweetness and then a lingering hop bitterness. Very pleasant mouthfeel, medium carbonation and a nice crisp finish. Medium bodied and easy drinking. This is an exceptional IPA, the centennial hop character definitely comes through, mostly in the aroma. The beer is well balanced for the style and is not overbearingly bitter, however the aroma is incredible. I will definitely be having this beer again soon."

"O: A solid IPA, one that I would pick up again if it were available. There was no date on this bottle. I don't know if it was old (before Founders was printing on the bottle) or if it just got missed. I do wonder if that would have helped the aroma. Either way, it was good but I don't think that it rises to the level of outstanding in a packed class."

"Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this beer, and it's not even all that cold. I can't wait to finish this six-pack. Only a buck more than Sam Adams and the like, but the quality is top notch. When I'm in a bitter beer drinking mood, I may make this my go-to. It's a damn pleasant brew."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, and malt. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O/D - A very respectable IPA. Full bodied, full of ABV, but all of those seem to integrate very well. Could be more of a cold weather IPA vs. some of the lighter versions of the style."

"Pours a deep amber or medium copper color with a huge off white head that persists for a while. Smells of floral, resinous and citrusy hops with a solid bready and caramel malt backbone. The flavor is crisp bitter and caramel. There's a solid hit of hops in the form of resin and citrus up front followed by lots of bready malt and a hint of caramel. The finish is a long lingering resiny bite. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice IPA, maybe a hint on the sweet side but great nonetheless. Thanks for coming to NH!"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"It's world-class for the style. It's damned good for any style, but for an American IPA, this is about as good as it gets, particularly for a year-round beer."
"O: A bit dank in the hops for me, but this is a well balanced IPA. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Beer is an attractive gauzy amber with a very light ivory head. Smell is thick and hoppy. Malt, bread, some pine and citrus, and perhaps some caramel. Taste is initially crisp and malty, followed by a wave of carbonation, finishing with a bracing hoppy astringency. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. It is nicely carbonated and there is just a little warming sweetness from the alcohol. Overall, a very good beer. The hops are bitter and crisp, without much in the way of floral or piney notes. It's not the most interesting or rich hop profile in my opinion, but this is a very, very good straight-ahead IPA."
""
""
"The Rest: A nice IPA that keeps things interesting. A more complex malt profile than the standard IPA, but the hop bitterness comes on so fast and strong that some of its subtleties get lost in the IBUs. Overall pretty tasty, though."
""
"Overall - I drank two tonight and it's definately very hoppy. Check back with me in a month and I may not even taste the hops any more. I tend to drink more and more hoppy beers and get used to them, Definatetly a beer anyone who is serious about beer needs to try."
""
""
""
""
"Founders Curmudgeon's Better Half was the only other offering I've had from this brewery up until this point. Although I'd take the aforementioned beer over this most days, that doesn't say much. This is a clean, bright, and well balanced IPA that satisfies my hop fix while still remaining very drinkable. Big thumbs up."

"Regardless, Centennial is a hoppy, pungent AIPA as they should be. Interesting, robust and unique. This is one of my favorite Founders, along with Double Trouble. Nice."

""

"This is a very good, very drinkable IPA. Good balance, great nose. Not quite as over the top in the hop flavor that some IPA's can be."
"Very good IPA. Basically, this is kind of a quintessential IPA and if you're looking for that bitter, citrusy, piney, hoppy taste with some balancing caramel malts, look no further. Again, this is what I think of when I think ""IPA."""
""
""
""
"O: It's another solid brew. I didn't enjoy the tailend of the taste, but it was overall enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Malt sweetness holds up well to hop bitterness.  Lingering astringency detracts from the overall effect.  A good IPA, but nothing to make it stand out."

"Pours a Crystal clear burnt orange/amber with a slighty off white head, about 1/4 inch that thins out very small around the top. Big hops all over this thing, pungent floral hops strike the nose followed by grassy hop notes an touch of pine, a bit of a peppery feel found in the smell as well. Floral,and fruity hops with a bitter bite on the tongue, so very flowery and peppery. Medium bodied, light carbonation, leaves the mouth very dry and bitter. For only being 65 ibu's this has got a pretty strong bitter punch. This is a fucking great AIPA, the hops are so juicy and floral, very easy drinking for the alcohol content as well."
"Overall: The flavors are a bit out of whack with the alcohol and assertiveness, but a top notch mouthfeel like this goes a long way. Despite my mild taste complaints, this is a very good beer. I wouldn't buy it often, but I'd be happy to revisit it now and then."
""

"This is an extremely well-crafted IPA. A new favorite of mine that I wouldn't mind drinking anywhere, anytime. Outstanding."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful clear yellow with a nice lacing that lingers for a while. The smell is rich with fruity and piney accents. Taste follows the nose quite well and is very refreshing and makes you come back for more. Mouthfeel is medium and perfect for this winner of a beer. Easily a go to beer. Founders never seems to disappoint.."
""
"O - This is a solid IPA. Good marks all across the board. As I said before, it ended up having a lot more hoppy bitterness than I expected due to the balanced nose and the 65 IBU. I can’t complain about a beer that has more hops than I expected. Founders never misses the mark."

"Big IPAs always seem to come from near the coast (whether it be East or West), so it is refreshing to have such a top notch IPA coming out of Michigan. I tend to associate Founders with it's malty offerings (stouts, Scotch ales, old ales, etc.), this is my first exposure to one of their hop-centric beers. I am impressed. I'm really glad I can now buy their beers here in Maine. I feel that I'll be enjoying many bottles of it."

"An excellent and unique IPA - very hop-forward but gently balanced by malt as most IPAs from the region seem to be."

"O-Very hoppy IPA but still remains balanced without having the malt contribute a ton to the flavor. Nice and complex bitterness that provides alot of layers. Very well crafted"
""
""
""
"O: If you like flowery hops, this beer is spot on for you. Pretty much right down the middle in terms of being bitter yet gets that hop fix right in the mouth. Perfect for an anytime IPA"

"O- Another well made American IPA but there is nothing to set it apart from the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): Founders Centennial IPA is the picture of balance in an IPA. It has the strong, flavorful hoppiness going on in parallel to a solid malt backbone while still achieving a great dry, bitter finish. It may not be the hottest IPA on the market, but it's always welcome in my fridge. Another go-to beer by Founders that also isn't too expensive at all. Two thumbs way up."

"slightly creamy and fizzy, medium body. overall, this was a good ipa from Founders, typically i think their ipa's taste like dirt and burtn rubber.. just my experience so far with them. this one actually tasted GOOD. had a slight soapy after taste to it which was slightly off putting in the end, i think it may have been better if they just balanced it out and made it a hint sweeter."
""
""
"O - Interesting but I expected more out of a solid company like Founders. Not memorable at all."
"O: one of my favorite IPAs. A superior blending and transitioning of the flavors resulting in a delicious IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Solid but unmemorable. I wish I'd ordered a taster rather than a pint."
"It pours a dark, cloudy amber with plenty of foam. The aroma is mostly hops with a hint of pine. The taste is nicely hopped with pine and citrus. It's a tad dryer than a typical IPA, but still good, along with the higher than average ABV. The body is fitting for a heavier IPA, and the aftertaste doesn't leave that stinging sensation. I really like this one!"
"Overall: My kind of IPA - lots of citrusy hop flavor and just enough backbone from the malt"
""
""
"On tap in a pint glass. Good off white head with some thickness, but didn't last too long. Aroma is rich. Some definite malt scent, but more hoppy, with a variety of choices - some citrus, but more floral, with a little pine for good measure. Taste us excellent for the style. Good balance, but obviously for the style, the hops shine. I'd say the piney hops come through the clearest, but there's a complex mix there. Mouthfeel is just right, with a medium body and good carbonation. Overall, a very fine ipa that I would love to spend some more time with."
"This beer poured a dark, clear amber with a thin white head that maintains a constant blanketing throughout drinking. Love the depth of color and constant effervescence. I poured this beer before it was ice cold which really helped to bring out the citrusy hops and sweetness. The taste is crisp and delightfully hoppy with mouthwatering citrus, candy sweetness, and a dry finish. Overall this beer is an outstanding IPA with potent hops and a lingering sweetness. It's definitely a beer that will quench your thirst & hop fix."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice american style IPA. Both the hops and the malt are balanced at a very high level and in-your-face type of way. Bold and likable. The bright pop of grassy resin in the beginning and the lasting pleasant bitterness make this beer standout in today's crowded field of top notch (and near miss) IPA's."
""
""
""
"O: A solid IPA, exactly what you expect an IPA to taste like. That is: good, but not particularly interesting."
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink and enjoyable, hiding the ABV quite well. This beer is a little too intense and too strong (ABV) to be a sessionable beer."
""
"O - Interesting beer, but not nearly as notewrothy as some of Founder's other offerings."

"Mouthfeel: like most of founders brews, exquisitely balanced and full bodied. Never overstays it's welcome, and after each swallow there is a pleasant astringency tickling the tongue and keeping the palate thirsty for more. "
"O - really more than its parts; liking the impact and refreshing quality; assertive and expressive; not to be contemplated, but simply consumed and enjoyed; well done"
""
""
""
"O: A powerful, smooth, and fragrant ipa, nice citrus, very heavy bitter, a bit overwhelming on the palate, but still delicious"
"Poured into a hopdevil pint glass...nice dark brown color and biting aroma...full taste without the sharp aftertaste that quite a few ipa's can exhibit. Truly one of the best of this type I've have, and I've had severall excellent ones. Founders does it again!"

"The appearance is opaque, a one finger head. The smell is malty to me, kinda sweet. I taste a slight malt in the front followed by a grapefruit bitter. The mouthfeel is medium; really like the mouthfeel. Overall a really good beer. Not my favorite IPA but one that certainly gets respect and it is one that I'll have on other occassions."
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how earthy it is, through the hops and the metallic malty flavoring. While these flavors are robust they seem overdone at times, giving a slightly deterrent bitterness. Regardless, the blend of flavors in nice, and the nose is equally as robust and inviting. This is certainly a nice beer, but not our favorite from Founders."

"My man Kevin hooked this up in our last trade! Thanks man! Another new brew I hadn't heard of poured to pint glass the beer is a slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1.5 finger white cap, good retention and lacing. The nose is a terrific blend of peach, grapefruit fruit with a kiss if earthy pine from the centennial hops. Great. The flavor is very much the same with an initial surge of the peach flavor with a more subtle grapefruit and pine from the hops along with a medium bitterness. A nice toasted malt base provides a nice balance. Finishes with a delightful mild bitterness and peach flavor that lingers for a while. Medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, this was a treat. I would be drinking this on a regular basis if Founders ever comes to Colorado!"
""
"I poured this into my glass and watched as the hazy amber colored liquid filled it. It poured a fingers worth of an off-white head that left good lacing. The aroma was of citrus, pine and a hint of peach. The taste centered more around the citrus and a good deal of sweet malt that balanced the beer very well. Centennial IPA had a medium bodied mouth feel that was slightly sticky which left the after taste pleasantly lingering in your mouth."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, clear, copper coloring with a solid, foamy, dense yellowish head. Aromas of rich and resiny hops with a mild floral highlight balance with strong caramel malt and citrus sweet notes. Smells great. Flavors are hop forward, with a bitter and resiny blast on the forward tongue, followed quickly with a rich toffee and caramel backbone that helps to balance and also spotlight the hops profiles. Tangy, bitter, and rich, the palate gets a quick jolt of tart grapefruit throughout, also. Rich, bitter, and hoppy aftertaste leading into a slick, dry, and clean finish. This is a damn good beer."
"Overall: very enjoyable because they got this right. There's a little room for improvement but one of the better ipas out there. Nice color, carbonation level, taste is nice. This is the first time I try this and I will definitely buy it again"

"Founders Centennial IPA was rather disappointing. In its defense, however, my bottle was over five months old (even though I purchased it less than a month ago). Perhaps I need to sample a fresher example to judge it fairly."
"O: A really nice IPA from one of the best breweries in the world"
""
"My favorite IPA I have tasted at the moment. It came on very smooth and did not have too much of a lasting after taste. Was strong enough to last most of dinner without overpowering the food. Had a really nice color to it and lived up to its reputation as a good midwest beer"

"O: A great IPA. I haven't really found many IPA's I don't enjoy, so the more flavorful, the better. The Centennial IPA isn't shy on the flavor and is delightfully bitter. An overall good experience."
""
"12oz bottle, pours a hazy deep orange/amber with a nice fluffy head that dissipates into a foam atop the ale, but leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are dank hops, with hints of pine along with a healthy dose of caramel malt. Tastes are bitter yet balanced. Piny hops dominate, but the caramel malt, grapefruity, peppery/spicy hops create a balanced and complex IPA. Mouth-feel is full bodied and rather oily, allowing the hop bitterness to linger on the palate. Overall, I'm a sucker for centennial hops, and this is always a favorite IPA of mine."
""

"O: This is a fantastic IPA. One of the wonderful things about trying many different beers is being able to return to styles you didn't used to love and being able to appreciate them in new and exciting ways. I'm happy to say that I LOVE this stuff now."

"Hazy golden orange with lots of little unfiltered floaties. It has a smallish creamy off-white head that quickly went to a thin film and laced the glass. Heavy citrus aroma backed up by light malts. Flavor is spicy and sweet hops, a great combination with enough malt to back up the sweetness. Very drinkable and the alcohol is slightly hidden."

"Pours a nice orange with a finger length white head. Lacing is sticky. Great hop aroma. If you have ever brewed with centennial hops you will recognize it immediately. Very piney. Flavor is of piney hops with a caramel back. Very biting and somewhat citric with a great malt blend. There's toffee and caramel in there somewhere. Mouthfeel is medium to thin and the flavor resonates. This is a super sessionable beer and the alcohol is invisible. Excellent session IPA"

"O - This is a great IPA. While not being a DIPA or TIPA, the hop characters are on point and as far as taste is concerned, this will likely become my staple go-to IPA when I am not looking for strong citrus notes (Loose Cannon) or anything too fancy. Deservedly the flagship IPA from our friends at Founders."
"Overall not the best showing for an IPA. If you try to linger on this one it seems to bring out some of the negativity. Certainly not a bad beer, but I'm not terrible impressed."

"bottled on 11-28-11 and i'm sure this would be a bit brighter had it been drank fresher. it still brings it in the bitterness department, and shows off some nice hop flavours, but the malt profile seems degraded somehow. one of the few IPA's that smells better than it tastes at my time of sampling."

"This was my first from Founders that wasn't a stout or porter so I was curious what their IPA would be like. I find myself coming back to the word balance when I think about this beer. It doesn't have a single part that sticks way out but everything blends well together. After having many beers that leave a lasting impression based on one or two things (super hoppy, really malty, fruity, bitter, etc.) it's possible at times that a beer with no spikes in its profile can seem less remarkable. Centennial doesn't seem to have any spikes but then I get to the end, pick out the ratings and conclude that the whole beer is pretty damn good. The spike is found in the bigger picture and overall excellence."

"Pours a mid-orange with a one-finger off-white head. Laces the glass well. Great nose, big floral notes. Fresh flowers. Sweet grapefruit and a hint of lemon zest as well. Flavor begins with a tiny, zesty citrus kick, both grapefruit and lemon. Moves onto much bigger floral notes, well done. Finding true floral notes in an IPA is a bit of a rarity and Founders nailed it with this one. Good both floral sweetness and bitterness. Finishes up with a fresh pine bittering kick. Features three different profiles of hop flavor and nails them all."

Taste is floral, some earthy vegetal hops, lots of big malt on the backbone, definite bitterness from the beginning to the end. The mouthfeel is slightly dry, medium carbonation, relatively easy drinking. Very good IPA, and somewhat different from anything else I have had."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a wine goblet. Bottled 11/22/11. Two finger head and a rich clear orange tint. A bit rocky head. Piney and citrusy scent. My favorite smell. Slightly bitter but sweet too. Grapefruit juicy fruit nice apricot taste. Medium bodied and holds it own with carbonation. Overall a wonderful IPA at the caliber of a West Coast IPa. I will seek out again. Another great Founders product."

"O: I'm almost certain I could pick Founders beer from a blind tasting at this point. They all seem to have a similar taste that I can't quite put my finger on, maybe it's the water? This is a very nice IPA, better balanced than most, not as bombastic-hop-overload as I expected. At 7.2% I'm surprised, it's not boozy at all. You can't go wrong with founders."

"I was looking at the beers of fame and realized I had never reviewed this one. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is orange, solid 2 inch head, nice lacing. Big hops on the nose, citrus and floral. The taste does not disapoint, big grapefruit and pineapple notes, lingering bitter finish. The body is medium, good carbonation, and I was surprised how fast I drained my glass. A must try for any beer geek."

"Very nice IPA with predominant citusy hops backed by some resiny hops. Nothing really stands out but it all works well together. Right where I like to see an IPA in intensity, bitterness, sweetness, booziness. A good alternative to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo."
"This is an awesome IPA that hides it's 7.2% ABV very well. The aromas progress very well through the end of the glass and it looks great. Looks good? Smells good? Tastes unreal. Very drinkable, makes me wish I could get this in LA a little more often."

"O: Great tasting IPA. Goes down easy and offers a nice mixture of citrus flavors and a hoppy exhale."
"Retried this IPA tonight and it was citrusy and piney and delicious. My first batch was off. Great beer. 9/10"
""
""
"The taste is nice, more balanced than I expected. As a fan of hops, I thought this IPA would be more bitter, but it's not. I liked it and would readily drink this beer, but it was somewhat surprising. The 7.2% ABV is actually a negative for me, though it did not taste of alcohol, particularly, as some 2X beers do. Still, it limits the length of a session, eh?"
"overall a good, enjoyable every day ipa."
""
"overall: so im a little bummed i forgot to check the bottled on date, as this one was bottled on 10/14/11. not too old, but not as fresh as i would have liked. maybe it affected my scoring, but i still think this is a very nice ipa overall. founders really does nothing bad"

"4/5 Mouthfeel is medium and really nice for the style. Carbonation is perfect."

"7.2% ABV & 65 IBUs"
"Cloudy amber in appearance. Very sour smell, not very inviting. There are some hints of hops in the nose. Lacks bitterness and has a very acidic taste. The mouthfeel is does not fall short of the taste. There is a slight sweetness at the end of the swallow. It does leave the tongue ok, but we have had better. Overall this is an average IPA and with a little work it could be good. Falls short of our expectations."

"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Bottled 12/05/11 indicated on the neck. Pours a translucent amber with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head that eventually dissipates into a creamy skim. Thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is subdued - a suggestion of caramel malt, a little earthy bitterness and a hint of citrus. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit too malt-centric and somewhat overshadows the hop character which really only peaks out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a slightly oily consistency. All and all, a simple IPA somewhat lacking any distinctive character. ABV is very well-hidden, but this beer doesn't really warrant the price in my opinion."

"O: Solid IPA, but nothing too exciting here. Somewhat one-dimensional, little out of balance"
""
""
""
""
"A great IPA from a great brewery, but not their best even (see Founders Harvest Ale)."
"The beer is copper to orange in color with a quarter inch or so of off white head that leaves some decent lacing on the snifter. The aroma offers pine, resin, malt, alcohol. Very hop forward in the taste - more than I would have guessed given the aroma. Bold flavor, with lingering dank hops and pine. Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Nice feel. Lingering pleasant bitterness I look for within this style. Overall, a solid brew. Recommended."
""
""
"O- Well balanced, The hops are pleasant and the mix of citrus makes a nice combination. I will buy a six pack next time."
"O: This is an interesting IPA where the dominant citrus hops flavors don't get too overpowering; it's pretty smooth and drinkable. Not my favorite IPA but definitely a very good one."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5): Maybe Centennial hops aren’t my thing. (I’m assuming they’re the namesake of this brew.) Don’t particularly dig the onion character, I guess. This beer hits the style well, if you like the hop character—decent beer, and I can understand why a lot of people like it, but it’s not for me."
""
""
""
"1426"
""
""
"Notes: Medium in body, with a slick, resinous mouthfeel that coats the palate and sticks around for some time. Drinkability is superb! Two-Hearted move aside. This Michigan IPA reigns supreme!"
""
"Overall - This is a very good brew from top to bottom, front to back. It tastes of an AIPA and has good hop flavor, but it doesn't go overboard like some beers do with the hop bitterness. You could realistically use this to introduce a noob to the IPA, as it isn't too aggressive. Very well balanced, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Straight ahead IPA with distinct sweet and bitter phases; quite delicious; a solid offering."
""
""
"O: This is a very nice beer. One of the best IPAs on the market IMO."

"Overall - A solid IPA here. I'm not sure if freshness might be an issue because it was all a little subdued for my tastes. Was expecting a little bit more of a hop kick than what I was getting."

"This is from a bottle that’s less than a month old. Beer poured a golden straw with a generous layer of foam. There’s a light hop aroma of straw/hay—not barnyard funk, mind you—but nothing overpowering. Taste bitter but easy going, with a spicy undertone to a solid hop flavor profile. I’m struggling to find the right descriptor as it’s not dominated by pine, nor citrus. But it is enjoyable!"
"Overall: A nice flavorful IPA. Glad to have tried it."
""
"Overall: Wow, this is a fine American IPA. I've had two beers by founders now and i'll certainly be buying more."
""
""
""
"D: Excellent American IPA that I would pick up again in a heartbeat. Very well put together and I'd say a true-to-style American IPA."
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty solid IPA, though I prefer their Double Trouble and All Day IPA to this. Nose is very nice, and taste is quite bitter. Worth trying and something I'd give another shot."
"O-it's nice, I recommend trying it. I think the hops in this one just aren't my kind of hops and that is probably my reason for not wanting to have it again"
""
""
"This IPA showcases Centennial hops very well, and because of that I find it quite similar to Two Hearted. I'd drink this one often if they sold it around here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"edit: just had this from the bottle, and its in another class. i bumped taste and overall from 4 to 4.5 because this is amazing. not sure if i got a bad keg, old lines or what, but this beer pops off from the bottle. the flavor is like drinking a friggen christmas tree, so bright in flavor and feel, and there is a really oily fresh hop character that was absent in the draft version. just fantastic stuff, and my review of the tap pour does no justice to how good this really is in bottled (or other tap) form. super bitter, the malt sweetness is totally gone, and this is the most perfect highlight of the centennial hop on the market. wow."
""
""
""
"O - Drinkable, citrusy bitter, refreshing. My type of IPA, a lot like Two Hearted Ale (also all centennial hopped) but this is probably more bitter"

""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this one...again right up front with the grassy, piney hops and very easy finish without being overly bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O: Yet another fine offering from Founder's. Reminds me a lot of Two hearted, which is expected because of the centennial hops. But if I had access to it on a regular basis, this would be in my fridge quite often."
"Overall: about as good of a centennial hopped beer I have had."
""
""
""

"O: One of my favorite IPA's when fresh."
""
"it was smooth and malty but didnt separate itself into something better than average. could drink again but im not gonna hunt it down."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love the taste, but I cant give it a perfect since Ive already had Bell's Two-Hearted. The Centennial hops are everywhere. The hops totally dominate the flavor, but I dont mind. Citric hops are exploding everywhere. Ripe lemon and citrous fruits dominate the tongue, and I like it. Malt bill is really lost in the background, and thats ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a banner IPA for the beergeek masses...IPAs are my fav style...this one is great to intersperse this time of year with Celebration, Two Hearted, Crooked Tree, and of course the new and unbelievable beer Lagunitas Sucks as well as the best value in craft beer...Hop Stoopid..."

"As I could not tell the bottled on date this may be an old bottle...which explains the lack of dry hop aroma. Centennial is a very fragrant hop with a lot of citrus-grapefruit character which is not present in the aroma. I smell mostly sweet malts. The taste is grapefruit with light spice and some malty sweetness...nothing exciting here. I'd like to try this fresh on tap from the brewery...probably like night and day. Anyway, give it a try but always check your dates...especially for hoppy offerings. Cheers!"

"O: Not bad, but what I will take away most is the distraction from the hops by the alcohol and malt. I can think of a few other IPAs I would go to before this one, but I wouldn't turn it down either."

""
""
""
""

"Beautiful copper/amber color though there is just a hint of cloudiness due to being unfiltered. The nose on this one reminds me of the spray that comes when peeling a tangerine. Great bitterness and it just dances on the tongue. Love those Centennial hops. Does not seem to be as carbonated as most IPA's. This one is a keeper."

"Overall this was a little too bitter and grassy for my taste."
"O: I had high hopes for this beer, and it almost got there, but the finish is just too much. I can see why some people would like it, but I just don't fall into that camp."
"Appearance is light copper or dark amber. Smells hoppy. You can tell from the smell that is an IPA. Very pleasant odor overall. Mouth feel is very good. Taste is very good. Beer is overall well balanced. Citrus is present and is strong. Hops do not make the beer unbearably bitter. Nice finish! Definitely one of the best (if not the best) IPAs I have had."
"O: This is one of my first beer from founders, and if they keep it up, they could be a top guy in my book. This IPA is a mid level beer in terms of complexity, but not so much as to be a turn off to newer drinkers to the style."
"I agree with the people recommending this beer. This is an excellent American IPA."
"O: A good IPA. Nothing special. But a nice everyday beer."
"O: A solid, bold, citrusy and refreshing IPA from Founders, even at a robust 7.2% ABV. West Coast citrusy flair with enough bold spices and fruity malt body to give a nod to the English. I dig this IPA quite a bit."
"O – Decent stuff didn’t love it or hate it. I’ll stick with my good old west coast IPAs, but Harvest is my favorite IPA from Founders, one of the best fresh hopped beers I’ve had!"
"Mouthfeel is dry with a nice finish that doesn't pucker the mouf. Carbs are just right. ABV is not detected at all."
"Pale bronze appearance. Nice foamy head. Tight bubbles that persist for as long as it takes to drink it. Good balanced aroma and taste. Flowery up front, hops in the middle, a pleasant hoppy bitterness at the back end with a mellow sweetness to cleanse the palate. An excellent representation of the style."
"O: A fantastic, complex, and delicious IPA. A solid embodiment of the style."
"Overall: Definitely worth keeping in stock in your fridge but not my top 5 IPA. Worth keeping for EVERY IPA fan out there."
"overall a very good IPA that showcases the centennial hop beautifully."
"Well this is an overrated beer. That said it is pretty tasty to this IPA loving bastard. It just doesn't reach those elite levels. This beer has intense flavors. I think the intensity is popular but it is intense to be intense and the flavors just don't mesh."
"Overall, a nice IPA that shouldn't be overlooked. Sweet and bitter with more of a lingering bitterness at the end. It's easy to drink as well, I'm on my third bottle. Give this a try if you see it -- it's definitely worth it."
"This was a good IPA, plenty of flavor, but the ethanol burn and obviousness was a bit of a let down. Perhaps this isn't so apparent when fresh, but that only means the hops are covering up the weakened malt body on this one."
"good ipa, but not a favorite"
"Can't be compared to a lot of other ipas I've had but definitely a good unique brew."
"Overall, this is a pleasant and enjoyable IPA to drink. It is a go-to beer of mine, and it always seems to hit the spot."
"Pours a deep amber with 1 finger of sticky head that reduces to a thin layer that persists. Aroma is strongly citrus. Lots of grapefruit with a sweet floral/tangerine undertone, almost like the sweet scent of flowers on a citrus tree (my parents use to have a lime tree and this beer smells like when that tree was in bloom). As I continue to let the beer open up I get a touch of alcohol on the nose but nothing overpowering. Taste is strong but not overpoweringly bitter. The hops are still there but aren't as present as on the nose. The citrus is balanced with a touch of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is clean with active carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice IPA, I only noticed halfway through drinking it that it is almost 8 month old so I would be interested to try it fresh but it must have been well taken care of because the hop aroma and flavor was still very pronounced."
"O - Quite enjoyable. I liked it better on-tap than bottled."
"This is what IPAs are all about. Very good."
"O: Artfully-made brew. Founders proves they are adept at conquering any style"
"Overall - A very enjoyable IPA. Near to the heart of the style, perhaps a bit unembellished, but completely balanced and drinkable. The bitterness and mouthfeel are spot-on, and the hop character is comforting in its lack of extremes. The beer develops nicely as you finish the glass, the hops building on each other on the tongue for a deeper flavor."
"O: Founders has a very nice IPA here, I would enjoy another."
"overall: Centennial used to be one of my favorite IPAs, but it has fallen off lately. Nevertheless, this is one of Founders' staples and an excellent beer."
"Nicely done. Also, at 7.2 ABV, be careful, because these go down fast!"
"Toasted orange in color - decent head and lacing. Light floral and citrus notes, some breadiness. While I expected a more 'adventurous' taste for some reason, I have concluded that where this beer really shines is its drinkability for an IPA. It's very balanced, not too dry or boozy, and it's not over the top. Big hit at the party the other night!"
"O: not founders best beer, but overall pretty well put together."
"A drinkable enough IPA, but kind of lacking in the zazz, the verve, the je ne sais quoi, if you know what my West Coast lurvin' gob is talkin' 'bout..."
"O - Delicious IPA which is nicely hopped and boasts loads of flavour for an American IPA. Certainly a quality sample of the style, too bad it's not accessible in Canada."
"O: The beer is not over the top which is probably why I appreciate it so much! Alcohol is in check, not crazy with the hop flavors just enough to satisfy any hop head while maintaining a smooth malt profile that comes and goes to let the hops really shine. One of the most well balanced beers for the style I've had in a long time."
"O: Simple citrus/grapefruit IPA but it's just executed perfectly. Balance is just right, drinkability is there in spades."
"O: A great representation of an IPA. Really mellow witha good build up and balance. I will definitely be picking this up again."
"O: this beer is always a pleasure to drink. I thought I had purchased a 6-pack of Founder Porter at the grocery store, but it turns out someone had exchanged one of my porters for a Centennial IPA. As variety is the spice of life, one can't complain at all. This was a very pleasant surprise."
"I'll pick this beer 8 days a week over virtually any hop-mess out there. The exception would be made for beers with judicious hop-pairings (given a similar yeast profile)."
"Good body, great feel, and more alcohol by volume than I like. Underrated in my opinion because it'll always be compared to Two Hearted; the latter is more ""flamboyant and outgoing"" but both are equally good in my opinion."
"Overall. Nice and satisfying IPA."
"Overall this is another solid brew from an exceptional brewery. Not an outstanding IPA, but a very good and drinkable one. I'm beginning to think Founders is a go-to brewery for someone new to the ""craft"" brew scene. They offer a complete line of styles and, from the several I've had, they are quite tasty, yet still drinkable. Cheers!"
"O - A solid offering from Founders, but their IPAs are nowhere near their stouts. It is a good IPA, but if you're into centennial hopped IPAs, I'd probably seek out a Two Hearted first, but there are those days when I'd really just rather have a Founders Centennial."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Overall, a nicely balanced and easy drinking IPA."
"Overall, is definitely a good one to try. You never know, it may turn out to be your favorite. However, in my opinion, it is not one that I would choose over any other decent IPA that I have had before."
"When I want an IPA, I want hop dominate monster. Well, this one has malt too, but what a pleasant monster it is."
"Overall: This is a solid effort, but it just does not compare to one of my favorite beers that also only uses Centennial - Bell's Two Hearted."
"O- this is an honest review, who knows maybe the keg was an old tap, or the AC was on too strong in the restaraunt,,, I don't know... but this was not a good beer. if I ever find it again I might re-review as this is going to be a much below average review of this. But its what I was poured."
"O: This is a solid single hopped IPA that showcases the centennial hop very well. The hops are done in balance here. I love this IPA, but turn elsewhere if I want that really aggressive hop punch."
"Overall: I can honestly say that I haven't had a beer from Founders that I didn't enjoy.. and this one is no exception. A solid IPA that has year round availability; fine with it!"
"Overall, very nicely done ipa, on the more bitter side of ipas but the malt balance makes it work."
"Pours a cloudy light copper color with plenty of head. There is a distinct smell of fresh grapefruit that is unbelievably pleasing to the nose. The taste is fresh and citrusy, but the hoppiness in the finish is too muted to suit my taste. This beer presents a conundrum: can an IPA with a less than powerful hop profile be considered truly great? I'll cop out and say that this is borderline great with tremendous flavor, but it leaves those of us who are intense hop-heads wanting for some extra bitterness."
"O: An IPA that is quickly becoming a staple in my fridge, Founders does it again with this beer. This has an excellent flavor and bitterness that hop heads will enjoy."
"O- A great IPA, one of my favorites. I am starting to think Founders can do no wrong. I will buy this IPA again."
"O-Very impressive beer but what else would you expect from Founders? One of the first IPAs I fell in love with. Easily sessionable."
"O: a nice brew, complexity is a bit off, there is just something in the middle of the sip that just doesn't quite add up with the rest of the taste, overall a good brew but not my top, still enjoyable"
"Overall Drinkability - Decent if underwhelming beer. Howerver, the solvent character would make it a great food-pairing beer."
"Very enjoyable!"
"O - i really enjoyed this ipa, not a hop bomb but good balance, founders just contiues to deliver solid beer after solid beer...one of my favorite breweries and i can't wait until they move some down here."
"(O) Founders makes quality beers. Period. Their lineup is top notch and this beer falls in line to a great ranking of well made beers. Not overly hoppy but not really sweet. Greatly balanced brew."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus and lots of hops. Taste is hoppy, bitter, a touch of citrus, a bit spicy. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"O - Solid IPA by Founders. This would definitely be one of my regulars if it was available in my area. I will always grab a sixer of this when visiting relatives in Milwaukee."
"O: Very nice balanced IPA definitely worth a try."
"very aromatic nose with lots of citrus tones, hops, lemons and a floral quality to the nose as well. Certainly showing the hops but its not overpowering at all. Very tasty medium/full feel with mostly hoppy and citrus tones. This IPA saved the night for me. Exactly what I was looking for and a real good example of an IPA. Thank god for founders"
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is very nice here as it the malt-hop balance. I really like the depth of the malt flavor alongside the hops."
"Served in a pint glass this beer had a nice golden red color with a substantial head. Not much of a nose on this one although what i did get was floral citrus. The flavor was fruity and malty with less hops than youd expect from and ipa, for me this was a refreshing change. Doesnt taste at all boozey and has a creamy and satisfying mouthfeel, overall a really enjoyable ipa"
"This was an easy beer to drink with great drinkability, smooth with a decent amount of carbonation with the alcohol not even noticeable. Overall a great hop bomb, a must try for any hop head and a find job by Founders."
"Lot's of hops thru out, yet not as strong as I like for an IPA. Clear taste of smooth malts. A delight to drink. Could be a little more hoppy to my liking(reason for 4.0). Most of the hops to me come in the after taste...However, it is really a fantastic IPA. ABV is non-existent, as you can toss these back like bottled water."
"O- Sets the standard for an IPA. Had the Dirty Bastard (best scotch ale I've had) and had my bar set high following it, but it is a very drinkable IPA."
"I guess I was a little disappointed by this one. I really enjoy Founders beers but I wanted a little more subtlety and nuance here. Not bad by any means but could have been better."
"O- All in all, it's not as fantastic as I would have expected, but it's still a damn good beer. A six pack of these would go quickly."
"As much as I love Founders, this beer didn't really do it for me. While certainly drinkable, it's overly malty and lacks that citrus hop flavor that I look for in an IPA. Would be a great IPA for those who love malty IPA's."
"Nice, complex IPA that's easily drinkable."
"O: Way good, not overpowering, nice tame IPA."
"Edit: Bottle is about 2 months old."
"Damn fine. I miss having Founders as my local brewery. This was always a great draft option at my after-work spot in GR."
"D: This is a very good IPA. BIg aroma and flavor, but this one is just a bit on the watery side for me. Still great though."
"O: I liked this brew. It had some nice flavors and very drinkable."
"Overall, very nicely done. No complaints."
"Well balanced, centennial hop highlighted, very quaffable, delicious. I've heard a lot about founders and this is my first chance to try one of their offerings, I'm impressed!"
"it can easily be consumed 2-4 in a session. but, drink it quickly after purhcase. shelf life is not very long."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a IPA. Hops and malts are bold and nicely balanced."
"Overall: They threw out the idea of balance entirely on this one. All hops, all awesome."
"A dark golden/copper color with about an inch of bubbly, frothy off-white head. Smells of hops, caramel, orange, and some toasted malt. Taste is bitter, with the hops dominating the forefront of the taste, but finishes with a delicious toasted malt character reminiscent of an amber. Also noticeable is some faint orange, caramel, and some herbal notes. The caramel really shines through as it warms, though the ever present hops round it out very nicely. Mouth begins with hoppy, bitter punch, smooths out in the middle as it takes on a caramely, creamy texture, and it finishes slightly dry. Overall, a very interesting and delicious brew that I'm glad to have tried! I would surely welcome this one again in the future."
"Centennial IPA pours out as a hazy, orange into amber colored brew, frothy cream colored head, sheets of lacing. The scent will key you into the fact that this is an IPA that's all about the hops. Grapefruit and citrus hops, fruity. Very enticing scent. Damn, the flavor is big for a beer this size. There is a slight caramel malt start, but that is decimated by the hops. We're talking citrus, lemon, grapefruit, oily, bitter, resinous hops. The malts emerge more as your mouth acclimated to the brew, and they are well blended. You can notice the alcohol a bit if you're looking for it, but that is also very well blended. Medium bodied."
"This beer pours an amber color with a fairly thick off-white head. The smell is piney citrusy and slightly sweet malt presence. The flavor follows with the citrus and pine hop flavors up front followed by a slightly sweet almost caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation. The beer is good but there are ipas inwould go for before this one"
"Overall a very good and easy drinking IPA."
"O: Very tasty, would love to have this on draft. I'll be getting this one again."
"Clear coppery gold pour with a half inch white head and lots of lacing. Tons of pine, grass, and floral hops in the nose. Just barely a hint of the underlying sweetness. Flavor is much more mellow than I expected. Somewhat herbal. Not sweet, but not horribly bitter. It’s a mellow, flavorful bitterness as opposed to an abrasive resiny bitterness. Some nice citrus and sweetness added to the hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is excellent, medium-light body with perfect carbonation. Awesome IPA."
"O - Nicely balanced, complimentary hop and malt flavor profiles, and it finishes bitter like an IPA should. Alcohol hidden well. I'd definitely try a fresh bottle of this."
"O: A solid example of the style. Another fantastic IPA from Michigan. This is probably the freshest one I've had, thanks to Founder's new bottle dating."
"O - An outstanding IPA, although a single hop variety, even if Centennial hops, is not my ideal formulation."
"O: A nice IPA for the hot summer day. Really refreshing."
"Bill"
"Very drinkable. Very well-balanced. Excellent IPA."
"pour is a dark orangey/amber with a frothy off-white head, fading to a skim layer of long lasting lace. a pleasant aroma of grapefruit and pine. flavor is a mild caramel malt sweetness with some floral notes and the aforementioned grapefruit bitterness on the tail. a go to IPA"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. All in all very well balanced and put together. Founders makes a solid line-up of brews straight across the board and this is no exception. Give it a try."
"D: I appreciate such a good beer for the price, but it didn't quite live up to what I had heard about it. I would drink it again for sure, but it isn't exactly what I look for in a single IPA."
"This beer is a nearly perfect American IPA. It is very hoppy and bitter without being out of balance."
"overall a really good beer. I enjoyed it and will buy again."
"Taste is not as hoppy as the aroma would lead onto because of the dry hopping. It has a nice hop profile that is well balanced with the malt that isn't overly bitter overall and has just a hint of bitter finish. Very well balance if bitter and finishing/aromatic hops. Very drinkable and well priced. Great value and taste."
"This beer is often touted by many BAs as the epitome of the American IPA. While I'm not certain I can call it my absolute favorite, it's damned close."
"My first experience with Founders and overall a (very) positive one! This is a beer that definitely tastes better as it warms, and it certainly showcases the hops very well. Delicious, delicious, delicious."
"Not the greatest IPA in the world, but I certainly would have no problem buying it again. Solid and reliable, cheers!"
"Well done Founders."
"Overall, this is a beautiful beer and highly recommended."
"D: overall for AIPA's, i must say there are betters out there. not bad, but i think my expectations were a little higher with so many positive reviews."
"O: Good. Nothing incredible, but I like it. I'd have another. recommended."
"O: Good pick, would recommend, would have again. Still, nothing makes it particularly memorable. That said, I can't find fault either."
"Purchased a six pack while on vacation in Michigan. Pours a beautiful amber color with an excellent head. Hoppiness that you would expect from a great IPA. A delicious beer that has an interesting finish that kept me coming back for more. In the middle of a heat wave, is beer hit the spot perfectly. Highly recommended."
"O: Awesome beer. In my opinion one of the best tasting and most reliable IPAs out there. Every time I have it im impressed. Bummer that founders doesn't ship to CT though!"
"D- Great for any occasion. I'd put down six with no problem."
"O- A drinkable IPA, nothing too high in alcohol, nothing that kills you with a burst of hop flavor. Just a well brewed IPA. If you like the lemon, grassy bitterness from cent. hops, than this is for you."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip. Coppery golden in color. Medium, off white head. Moderate retention. Clear, oily lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma dominated by earthy hops and malt sweetness. Honestly the aroma has a bit of an ""aged"" smell to it. People into aging beer (like myself) know this familiar aroma. Sharing this one with cheesemoose and we both agree, this one isn't fresh. (purchased this week at Total Wine in Charlotte). Still tasty, just not what i expected. Wish it had a bottled on date. We just cant find one."
"O: Doesn't get much better than this, will definately reach for this one when I want an IPA again."
"Enjoy!"
"o: This is a very nice IPA, one I seem to recall enjoying more on-tap."
"O= I enjoyed this IPA and could easily session it. That is, unbtil you look at the label and realize it is 7.2%ABV. The highish alcohol level is very well disguised and unnoticable. Watch out!"
"Drink- A great third coast IPA that as I said would be all sorts of good when fresher. Kevin hooked it up and Im glad he did. Id love this one again."
"O- This is a solid IPA, really impressed with the aroma, taste was not as impressive but still really enjoyable and one I would gladly revisit."
"Love the fruit notes and I really like that its not just citrus. Not sure how this is accomplished, I thought Centennial was super citrusy, but I guess its more complex than I thought. I am trying to explore as much of the Founders catalog as I can now that I'm back in the midwest. They haven't let me down yet."
"O: A solid west coast style IPA in the same league as Stone's IPAs. I've been impressed by Founders' offerings and this is no exception. Extremely impressive brew here. A solid ""A" all the way."
"Really good IPA. I'm biased towards the West Coast examples, so I'd say this is my favourite American IPA not from the West Coast. But the style is directed that way anyway, so I guess you could say it's just my prejudices showing again..."
"Pours a translucent orange with a two-finger, off-white, rocky head that has great retention and leaves thick, fluffy lacework. Aroma is spice, candi sugar, orange juice, floral hops, and herbal hops. Taste is tons of herbal hops, orange juice, orange peel, a bit of pale malt. Finish is herbal hops. Big time beta acid presence from the dry hopping. Pretty light-bodied for an IPA and very easy to drink. 7.2% is well hidden. Very nice."
"This brew poured a hazy golden color. This head that stuck to glass. The hops are most definitley present upfront and lingers. Somewhat of a sweet taste but mostly very hoppy, bitter, and just a great tasting brew. I would easily drink this again. I agree this brew is also very easy to drink even at 7.2% abv."
"Great beer overall, it was very easy to drink on its own and I imagine it would pair well with food, particularly spicy food. Again, this is a session beer for me and another fine product from Founders that I’ve been lucky to enjoy several times over the past year. A high recommendation to go out and enjoy this brew."
"O-a nice beer for drinking with a meal or just enjoying a couple on a hot summer day. A well-crafted IPA from a quality brewery."
"O- I love Founders... They are one of my favorite breweries. This is a good IPA, but is lacking personality. I can't fault it on it's composition or it's balanced hoppiness, but it lacks that special ""zing""... However, I could definitely drink a few of these. This is quality beer that is easy to find, and won't disappoint."
"Awesome Michigan beer. If you are planning a vacation go to MICHIGAN. Great beers around all the time. This beer from GR is delicious. Has a beautiful head throughout the whole light amber glass. Sweet smell of flowery hops, citrus and all around make you happy smell. Taste of light malt, strong blend of hops and a nice after bite that keeps you thirsting for more. A very nice IPA. MICHIGAN KICKS ARSE AT MAKING BEER!"
"O (D) - super decent. Am glad to have bought a sixer instead of just a single."
"Overall, this is not a world class IPA, but it is very good. If you are looking for a pallate- thrashing hop bomb, this might not be for you, but it is still quite good and you wont be sorry you tried it."
" bitter enough to satisfy hopheads."
"Not a bad beer by any means at all, just a average ipa nothing excellent stands out to me"
"O - Pretty good. I have always enjoyed this beer but it never gets to the point of being great. The hops tend to die down a bit too much toward the end, letting the sweetness creep in and dominate the finish."
"​O: Just like everything Founders does, this is a beer that fires on all cylinders. The little flaws that show up aren't apparent with every drink, and, to be honest, they're overshadowed by this beer's greatest aspects. Another fantastic endeavor from a fantastic brewery. Founders, you rock!"
"D - A very good IPA, good depth and complexity, lots of hops"
"Can't believe that rated against the other many fine IPA we here are blessed with I have to rate this merely as a B+. Excellent brew, a must try after the 17 better ones easily available now."
"D - Great IPA, can be enjoyed with all types of foods and has a nice hop profile that allows you to enjoy the drink from start to finish;it doesn't beat up your taste buds or nose"
"Re-reviewed 6-27 after I bought a sixer. Slightly reedited with no score change, just more detailed."
"O: A very good IPA from Founders. Definitely recommend."
"D - The hop character in this beer is undeniable, but there is really quite a strong malt backbone that never loosens its grip on your palate. The hop character is that of a fairly standard IPA with lots of pine and citrus and less tropical fruit than I might have expected. It is an enjoyable beer, but the malt is just a bit too dark and thick for my taste and it bogs down the hop character and keeps it from shining through the way that it might under other circumstances."
"Perhaps I had my expectations too high for this one. It is a great IPA, but it is not exactly what I am looking for in an IPA. It's too herbal and borderline one-dimensional for the hop flavors. Regardless, it's definitely worth a try."
"Full flavored and full bodied doesn't really make this IPA sessionable. A good offering, just not my favorite version of the style."
"O: Good, but not as good as some of the other Founders IPAs that I've had (namely Double Trouble and Harvest Ale)."
"Color is copper, like a dark apple juice, with a thick white head that lasts through the whole glass and creates a nice lacing. The pleasing scents are a variety of citrus - peach, pear, and a little grapefruit. Grapefruit is prominent in the taste. There's a slight fruity sweetness in front, followed by a surge of bitter grapefruit and pine taste in the finish. Very delicious. Definitely an IPA I'd choose again."
"No date on beer, but I think the store moves these quickly. Pours out a copper color with frothy head. Smell is of resinous hops, pine and some faint toasted hops. Nice lacing. The taste of the beer is some oily hops, grapefruit, but more pine, and a touch of some lemony citrus in there. Also, the malts are robust enough to make this beer pretty balanced and it has a nice caramel backbone to reel in some of those hops, but the overall aftertaste is a nice puckering, drying hop flavor with some faint herbal characteristics. The mouthfeel is very very smooth and I have found this beer to be highly drinkable. My only gripe is that I do find the hops *slightly* muted for an IPA with 65 IbU's. Which can only lead me to believe this beer might be a bit older than I'd like, who knows with no decipherable date code."
"O - Overall, it's a solid offering from Founders that's a year-round stand by for me. It's a pretty easy drinker and it's priced fairly for a 6-pack."
"I have really grown to like IPAs lately so I really liked this beer BUT it wasn't as good as I had hoped. What I love about an IPA is the bitter hops taste that hits you right away followed by the faint citrus/grapefruit taste that comes after. This one was missing that fruit taste as it went down so I finished it thinking it was missing something. That said, I haven't had a bad Founder's brew so it is quickly becoming a ""go-to"" brewery for me."
"O- Overall this one is on the border of the style for me and not well balanced. Some good depth and hops character but no support from the malt. It's alcohol finish with bitter grapefruit ending is not smooth or pleasant for my liking in this style."
"O- A good hoppy IPA that really reflects the flavors of Centennial hops. A worthy IPA."
"Tastes of citrus, oranges, hops, bananas, more hops, steel, sweetness, amber syrup and malt. A good Founders representation for sure. Smells like an average IPA with grapefruit, zest, hops and malt. I like the tangy flavors in this one. Should age okay."
"O: Very good IPA, up near the top. Highly recommend."
"Hop flavors stand out for me more than bitterness, consisting of pine and lime pith. Malts are not sweet, really, but have a caramely aspect and some toast. Mouthfeel is smooth and nice, not a surprise knowing it is a Founder's product. It is one of those IPAs that is hop-leaning, but yet has plenty of malt backing that doesnt get too much in the way. They complement each other...thats the phrase I was looking for. Very drinkable...my bottle is a few months old, I'd love to taste an uber-fresh tap pour of this sometime."
"O- This is a solid tasty IPA with some good depth and hops character and nice support from the malt. It is a bit high in alcohol to have more than one as it goes down pretty smooth."
"After a too long drought of Centennial, it finally is back in stock and it is fresh(awesome addition of bottling dates Founders!)! Gleams a lovely rich burnished gold in the glass with a fluffy ring of lacing topping the noble pour. There is a sharp, peppery, herbal aroma with the tell-tale grapefruit citrus of delicious centennial hops thrumming just under the surface. Ahhh, just as good as I want to remember it being- a medium body of balanced malt that is enrobed in sharp, grassy, piney bitterness that culminates in a bountiful mouthful of grapefruit rind, cilantro, mild peppercorns and a supportive clover honey sweetness. A medium body and clean finish give this beer sessionable drinkability. Thanks for finally getting some Centennial back in NoVa Founders. And just a few days before my birthday too. Yum."
"O - Way too sweet for me. Not what I look for in an IPA."
"O- I think this is a great brew, but would like it consistently cold to eliminate the syrupy finish. I will however, recommend this brew to anyone who appreciates a bold american IPA/Double IPA. If this is the only American IPA on the market, this would be my staple...go and try it!"
"O: I love the rich spoiled fruit flavors that are present in this beer. This is some good stuff. The ABV is right around perfect in my opinion and well masked with wonderful flavor. This seems to be a rather complex tasting IPA. It is easily one of my favorites and my first offering from Founders. I must find more of their beers and give them a try. A great IPA."
"A nice creamy yellow beer with a thick white creamy head that leaves nice lacing and good retention. The nose is full of floral and citrus. Loads of grapefruit, orange zest, sticky pine. Lots of centennial hops, grassy and floral elements. The taste has a crisp cut with citrus notes and lime zest. Great IPA."
"Had this for a second time and found it to be a lot better the second time around. This pours out as a nice yellowish gold color with a decent looking white head on it. The smell is heavy with pine and some citrus. The taste is wonderful, it's very strong with hops and just relentless on the tastebuds. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light but still has a great body to it. Very good beer!"
"OVERALL JUST A DELIGHTFUL OFFERING FROM FOUNDERS"
"looks like most others of this type in the glass, except this one had a big three finger head that stuck around for a while with good lacing. smell was like a big bouquet of hops, citrus, floral, pine all mixed well with lots of malt to balance. taste follows te nose on this one, tastes like it smells, which is awesome. this one wasnt overly dry or bitter, cant wait to finish off this six pack."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 05/16/11. Pours a translucent light amber color with a half inch of white head. Fair amount of lacing. Great hoppy aroma. Floral, piney and some citrus hops. Taste is piney and floral. Nice bitter bite to it. Piney bitterness at the end. Nice amount of dryness to this beer. Nicely drinkable and a good balance of bitter hops. Overall, this is a really good IPA worth buying often."
"I would love to try this on draft, so looks like a road trip will be happening this summer!"
"Quite a delicious IPA, and one I'll be picking up again for sure."
"Founders just keeps cranking out the hits. Centennial IPA is a great sample of a class of beer that doesn't feel like it has to go over the top. could drink this a while without getting palate fatigue (almost like a great pale ale brings with drinkability)."
"Overall is really good and I could certainly see buying 6 packs of this if it were available to me."
"Centennial IPA pours a crystal clear amber-to-orange, depending on how well lit it is. There's a little bit of white foam topping the beer, and it sticks around for a quick minute before leaving a solid amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is surprisingly sweet, but once I get past that the requesite grapefruit citrusy aromas shine through. There's big caramel up front with each sip, despite being brewed in Michigan this beer's get both feet planted on the east coast side of the US IPA map. From there a brief interlude of bitterness leads to the citrusy close. This part tastes a bit off to me though, it's a very harsh grapefruit flavor. It's what I'd imagine would happen if someone wasn't paying attention and zested a bunch of the pith in with the grapefruit skin while cooking. Unsurprisingly, the body is more to the full side for the style, not nearly as bone dry as some of its west coast counterparts. The carbonation admirably cuts through that to let the hop flavors pop. I don't know if it's the particular hop combination/schedule that Founder's uses or what, but the hop profile just rubs me the wrong way. Probably not an IPA I'd reach for again if others were available."
"Orange glow in the light, the color is a hazy reddish orange. A fine carbonation rises and sits for a few minutes, no lacing in the glass, but a layer of tiny bubbles float during the whole beer. Aromas are of hop and apricot. Flavor is hop forward but nicely balanced, big citrus fruits and apricot with a light but refreshing bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a pleasant lingering citrus hop flavor. Very tasty brew, always in the fridge."
"Overall - Let me take you through the sip... The smell of almost ripe yellow grapefruits fills your nostrils...as you tip the glass, you see the brilliant bright orange ale peaking through the shimering eggshell cap...there is very well defined sticky lacing after every sip (I counted 10 distinct lace stripes on my glass when finished!)...grapefruit juice with slight malt background, tingling carbonation, grapefruit peel, clean, dry finish with spots of grapefruit juice, slight warming from the 7.2% ABV, the first bottle goes quickly, and you realize you have fallen in love with arguably one of the greatest looking, smelling, tasting IPA's around. If you read my other reviews, it's obvious that I'm pretty darned fond of Founders products, and their Centennial IPA is flawless perfection in my opinion - I can't recommend this one enough, two thumbs way up :)"
"Pours a moderately hazy orange color with a thin white Moderately intense fruity hops skewing towards grapefruit. Light notes of grainy malts tucked away in the back. Clean fermentation. Slight presence of alcohol. Modestly grainy malt backbone supporting a fruity tangerine hop character. Bitterness is clean and moderate level. Medium-long, dry finish with a lingering bitterness and fruity hops. Medium-light bodied with a moderate level of carbonation."
"O - Your textbook AIPA. It doesn't stand out from the crowd, but doesn't disappoint either"
"5/20/2011"
"This beer pours a very clean bronze in color with a one finger off white head. This beer wreaks of Centennial hops with a light creamy malt finish. It is so sharp and succinct and does exactly what it's meant to. The flavors are a nice middle ground between the fresh hoppiness and the caramel malts. The hops are just perfect and the beer finishes crisp, not drying out the palate at all. It drinks perfectly and has nice carbonation. This beer is top notch. I wish other people didn't realize that."
"O: This is a good beer, but it's just not my favorite IPA out there. I plan on picking up a bottle sometime, maybe the keg was getting old. Who knows, overall though I wouldn't advise against this beer, it just didn't overly impress."
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Nice dark orange color with nice foamy head and carbonation. Smell some citrus and pine aroma. Good tasting ipa with considerable hop bitterness and malt presence...a bit of citrus there too. Nice balance of hops and malt. I have sampled many india pales ales and this is one of the better ones....not the best...but very respectable. This is a good solid ipa and I won't hesitate to drink it again."
"O: A very good IPA."
"O: At 7.2%, this drinks like a lower ABV, meaning it's deceptively drinkable. Not super dry and crisp, yet not sweet, it seems like an IPA that wouldn't become tiring after a couple of pints."
"O-This is one hell of a brew! Super drinkable with just the right amount of hops. I'm very happy I got my hands of this one. Gonna have to pick up a 6 pack the next time I'm at the store."
"O: A delicious, easy drinking IPA that I would get again and again. What a treat to be able to get a growler here in Upstate NY."
"Overall - Not my favorite beer for the style, but a good brew. This was my very first Founders beer, I'll certainly try any others that I can get my hands on."
"O: This is an excellent tasting IPA; glad I gave it a try."
"I could drink this all day long. I'd love to see this in my fridge or poolside on a nice summer day. I've never been disappointed with anything I've had from Founders - and that trend continues. The abv is very well hidden - great American IPA..."
"MOUTH-WATERING, TRY IT!"
"O: Pretty drinkable due to the hop/malt balance, but the alcohol does show up just slightly in the taste/mouthfeel which slows things down a little. Overall, this is a very nice IPA that I wouldn't turn down."
"Sessionable Rating- 4.5/5"
"T: This was a solid IPA, it just didn't blow me away. Had some nice citrus hop flavors and was well balanced. Good, but nothing I'd move to the Midwest for."
"Overall: Really a great beer to highlight this hop. The malt enhances all the best nuances and ideal flavors. You can tell that Founders took great care in how to tease out the various characteristics. Really a pleasure to drink this it is so fresh."
"This ranks as one of my favorite ""regular"" IPA's and is a decent value. Will be revisiting this one."
"drinkability is great. this is definitely one of my favourite american ipas, and my favourite from michigan. great hop depth. excellent balance. really, everything i look for in an american ipa."
"Poured clear, honey color with a dissipating white head. Aroma is of grass and citrusy hops. Bitter hops right up front in the taste, with piney citrus notes coming through, and mild malts in the background. Light-medium mouthfeel with some bitterness in the aftertaste; overall nicely drinkable."
"Poured a slow to emerge 1/8"" head which dissipated completely. Hazy orange in color. Smell is hoppy with cedar and citrus. Taste includes those too but is much milder than smell would indicate. Perhaps the sample I picked up was old but then again the hops tasted fresh so I don't know. To me this fell somewhere around the 75 percentile of American IPAs."
"Look up ``American IPA'' in the dictionary. You'll find this. 'Nuff said!"
"Medium to light mouthfeel with a bit of oily finish from the hops. Very drinkable and nearly ""sessionable."" Great brew."
"Pours a orangish amber color with a nice cloudy head. Good clarity and color is bright. Head has really good retention and lacing. Smells of fresh fruits, hops, and plenty of floral notes. Really good smelling beer. Taste is delicious and smooth. Lots of sweet citrus fruits and a bitter hoppy finish. Very sessionable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation from the tap. I will definitely look to get this anytime I see it on tap."
"O- One of the best IPA's Ive tasted. This is a must try for IPA lovers."
"D- OK I get it. I understand why everyone is so big on Founders. This is a brew that is totally geared on balance. The bitterness is so delicious that you can keep enjoying this brew. OK.... I NEED FOUNDERS TO COME TO SYRACUSE!!!!"
"M – Light body with a clean, green bitter finish. Ok carbonation."
"Overall, this is a good beer. The flavors of the beer are quite complex with the sweet malt being met by pine and citrus hops accompanied by bitterness. More pine notes are present in the flavor of this beer than probably any that I have had. But, it works."
"Overall: A very nice example of a no-coast IPA. This one is crisp, easy drinking, and everything you'd expect from an American IPA."
"Smells of caramel malt, mild hops, biscuit, and bland citrus. Taste is strong on the malt, light on hop bitterness. Some residua bitterness in the mouthfeel. Good overall flavors and a solid go-to beer. Not the best I've had from Founders, but all of their offerings are very good."
"O: An incredibly balanced IPA, Centennial is crisp, easy to drink, and very delicious. Really the epitome of its style. Well worth seeking out."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a one finger bone white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and subtle pine. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice IPA. The flavors on this one were quite well balanced. The aroma was very nice too and kept you coming back for more. The citrus was very forward on this one, but very enjoyable. Get this one on your palate now if you have not before, if you have, you already know what I'm talking about."
"The sweet malt taste and even the hop taste kind of reminds me of some other IPA's I've had mostly Heavy Seas Loose Cannon and maybe some of Lagunitas beers mixed in with a little bit of Stone (because I know they like to use that Centennial hop) For being a single hopped beer it has plenty of kick and flavor. The malt bill is really what makes it shine. Who knows maybe they made the malt sweet and candy like because of only having one hop variety in there. Whatever they do they do it good and this beer is on the top of the list when it comes to IPA's."
"Mouthfeel is has a sticky and resinous hoppiness to it and a medium body feel. Overall, a top notch IPA but I served this one a bit too warm for my liking. Letting the next ones chill a bit longer I'm sure I'll find them more refreshing."
"Notes: Pretty nice IPA, maybe not an offering that Founders will be remembered for but this is quality and sits in the top bracket of IPA offerings. It had been a while since I had this one, and while not fresh of the bottling it still feels rich and worthy."
"O- this beer is exactly what an american ipa should be. it showcases the centennial hop and assaults the senses in a remarkably good way. hell of a beer."
"It is a very respectable beer and one of Founders best."
"Overall I enjoyed this offering from the brewery that is more famous for their Stouts. Nice to know they are not a one trick pony. Thanks to HandsomeBrew for this extra. Recommended!!"
"Overall-Very pleasant and tasty. Centennial proves once again how versatile it is."
"Overall: In the old drinkability, this beer would get a ""5.0"" and beyond. Immensely drinkable! Goes down so easy. But it is a bit too inoffensive... good to session, but I didn't find it particularly enjoyable or outstanding. Too malty and bready for my taste, this is not what I look for in an IPA."
"Overall - I have to say it is quite the beer, the only thing I don't really like about it is the alcohol flavour, it just makes me think of nail-polish remover. I've really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to be had with something very hearty and with sharp flavours that can compete with the bitterness and the alcohol flavour. The alcohol flavour is actually quite the deterrent to me, I can't really stand the alcoholic zang at the end of the beer, I think that's the only improvement that can be made. All in all though, this is a very interesting beer."
" Grade A+ Purchased at Stoney's -- $10.99 per 6-pack"
"D- Overall this beer just didnt do it for me. its complexity really wasnt there. I did drink this beer paired with a funky goat cheese and gizzards meal so that might have thrown it off alittle. I could see this maybe going well with some spicy food. Its grapefuit flavor just came through too strong to really like this one. Will try it again in a year or 2 just to give it another chance."
"A quality IPA that I am glad to have experienced."
"D. A wonderfully balanced IPA that I could drink on a regular basis."
"O. A nice, enjoyable IPA that is more peppery and spicy than other IPA's, a great choice for wanting something different when it comes to IPA's. This one is now on my list of must try IPA's."
"O-> I will admit the first few sniffs and sips did not do this beer justice. Only after it had warmed and been agitated a bit did the flavors and aromas reveal themselves. I knew it was fresh from the bottle date so I was put off at first...only to be brought back around and wowed by the balance of this beer."
"Overall very good ipa. Very balanced IPA."
"Overall this is a delectable beer. It would go well with some spicy foods for sure."
"This is an excellent AIPA, one that I'd put up with 60 Minute or Two Hearted. I'll definitely be picking this one up again as a go-to beer."
"Drinkability is good. This is a decent beer but I wouldn't say it stands out amongst a lot of other IPAs out there. Drank this one pretty quickly and wouldn't mind another."
"This beer pours a golden color, with a small lacing head. It smells very hopppy and bitter. There is a strong bitter dry taste. Very full hop flavor; a nice grapefruit flavor. Very full flavor, and very nice carbonation. Overall a great beer, so glad its readily avilable."
"Overall - Tasty, but nothing I'd seek out over other IPAs."
"-Cheers"
"This beer is not my style to be honest and this beer was no exeption. The problem with this beer is the bitter hopstaste which developes in the back of the mouth."
"Pours a bright orange colour with very thick white head. Lots of lacing around the glass, great head retention. Smells of citrus hops with some resiny pine and caramel malt. Quite a bitter flavour, only small sweetness balance. Huge carbonation level. This is a very nice IPA."
"Overall, a good IPA. Nothing stands out from other examples of the style. Still an enjoyable brew."
"Overall- Another solid beer from Founders. Not a mind-blowing brew, but a well balanced IPA you can easily drink more than one of."
"O - this is a pretty good IPA but definitely not one of my favorites nor is it one of my favorites from founders. still glad i purchased the single bottle."
"The Centennial IPA goes down pretty easy: it is smooth, well balanced, and very drinkable. Although a tad heavy at 7.2%, aside from the mouthfeel there is nothing that suggests this level of alcohol. Certainly recommended."
"A semi hazy golden orange with a good size off white foamy head on an aggressive pour. Nose is a decent citrus and floral hops with a fairly strong malt caramel backbone. Sweet mix of both hop resin and malt characteristics. Medium bodied all told. This is a great all round go to IPA, I'd bet it's at the top of it's game when fresh, as most in the style go. Availability for me limits my ability to secure this at any peak freshness, but even now it's still showing some resiliance in hop flavour, and I dig and respect that. Not exactly a hyped offer from the brewery but another quality beer that continues to impress me from Founders."
"A bit chewy and oily in the beginning to near end, but the palate is left moist and satisfied."
"O: One of the best expressions of Centennial hops out there"
"Pours a clear amber/orange with a thin white head that quickly fades into a faint ring. Aroma is of toffee/caramel malts, some grapefruity/piney hops with some herbal notes. Flavor is rather sweet, very bitter, and finishes with an earthy/herbal hop presence. Some burnt sugar/wood flavors in there as well. I have always enjoyed Founders Centennial IPA: very consistent from batch to batch, available and affordable at $11/6-pack."
"Drinks nicely and a decent everyday beer, but considering the brewery I expected more. This isn't a stand-out."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. The greatest compliment to this beer is that it is easy to drink. Don't come into this beer expecting something to blow you away with hops, as it is more floral and balanced than many IPAs out there."
"O - Perfect balance in this IPA. Simple flavor but very well constructed (especially as compared to double trouble). Now I have some lacing in the bottom of my glass - better get another."
"Pretty good IPA all around. Sometimes it can be hard to tell IPA's apart, but the heavy biscuit here is a welcomed touch. Also, this is rather restrained compared to what I would have guessed from Founders. That's something I appreciate, though some may not. Very balanced."
"No surprise here, this is a great IPA."
"Overall a wonderful brew That is appropriately hoppy while being balanced enough to have a few of."
"All in all, I consider this an okay brew. However, I was expecting much more. The hops just don't seem to shine through the malts with the flavor complexity I would prefer. This beer seemed pretty one-dimensional. Again, if you like bitterness, you'll like this beer, but that's about it. Perhaps if the beer had been consumed in a ""greener"" stage, my review would be much different. We'll see next time."
"Pours a nice amber/orange color. Nice 2 finger head that sticks around for a bit. Smell is hoppy orange citrus with some sweet bread in the background - a little faint though. Taste matches nose and finishes fairly dry. Like this brew a lot. It comes off as rugged and unfiltered. Wish I didn't have to leave the state to find it."
"The ethanol burn gets a little unpleasant as it warms and because of this the drinkability suffers a little but overall it is a very solid brew and for the Two hearted fans out there, get this if you cant find two hearted"
"The beer pours a translucent orange color with two fingers of off white foam atop it. The head fades quickly leaving a wispy coaster and some pretty darned good lacing for a single IPA. The aroma is of wet, dank hops backed by a tinge of sweet malt. Taste follows. Dank hemp and a mild bitterness nicely balanced by a biscuity malt presence. The beer never gives in to intense bitterness or sweet maltiness, but maintains a pleasant compromise that works in it's favor. The finish is bittersweet and lush with juicy citrus notes. A medium body lends itself to the very nice feel of this brew. Carbonation is appropriate for the style giving the beer a somewhat creamy texture as it warms. Drinkability is quite good given the pleasing balance and great taste of this offering from Founders. I like it!"
"Pours a clear orange with two finger creamy off-white head that fades to a quarter inch leaving thin rings of lace. Smell: earthy and green with spicy and citrus rind notes, over a cantaloupe + toffee base. Taste: sweet biscuit + caramel upfront with lemon and grapefruit edges then a spicy and earthy bitterness that stays and is rejoined by grapefruit in the finish. Light-medium body, lowish carbonation. Good tasting IPA that leans towards balanced."
"O: Another high quality brew from Founders. Their Centennial IPA is good drinking, and a cornerstone of any craft drinker's fridge."
"D - I would definitely get this again. A nice change of pace IPA for me. Balanced and not all hop-forward."
"Drinkability seems very high which may get you in trouble at 7.2%. This beer is becoming a familiar staple in my rotation. Founders is a very solid brewery imo."
"D-Good beer, but not a great one. Will have to try this again as I remember this being much more of a citrus and pine bomb and not so floral."
"D: Solid IPA, good job Founders."
"D- This was exactly what I expected from Founders. Complex, smooth and downright tasty"
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, earthy bitterness up front that lingers throughout over the sweet citrus and caramel malt flavors into a slight dry finish. There's a prominent resinous pine hop presence up front that gives this beer it's wonderful dry bitterness. This is wonderfully complimented by a subtle citrus character that gives off hints of grapefruit, pineapple and orange rind. Underneath, there's a subtle malt backbone that provides excellent balance without killing off the hop flavor. Not as toasty or prominent as the aroma suggests with faint hints of caramel as well as some biscuit and graham cracker. The ABV is excellently masked with only faint alcohol flavor toward the end of the swallow, making this beer dangerously drinkable. The ABV is too high for it to be considered a session beer but it's so well balanced and quaffable I could see myself drinking a bunch of these in one night."
"Founders really doesn't make a bad beer, some just happen to be better than others. I like this IPA it is bold, balanced, and complex. I feel that some hopheads might be a little disappointed, but I for one, am very happy that this is one brew I can find all year long."
"This brew is quaffable. Could become a staple product in my house. A nice product."
"An IPA I've overlooked...this is easy to find on-tap around here and I've always passed it up for something else for some reason. This is a great beer to have around regularly."
"the Cpj"
"D- Very high. Flavor is well balanced and this is one of the best single IPA/APA's i've ever encountered!"
"crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. good drinkability. overall a very nice, enjoyable IPA, though not quite transcendent."
"Maybe not quite sessionable because a sixer would light you up pretty well but easy to drink a few for sure. This one deserves the plaudits."
"Definatly a great beer, cheers!"
"The smell has some citrus and pine notes to it. I pick up sweet citrus notes in the taste. There's a nice citrus bite in my mouth. Feels pretty smooth for the high alcohol content. Easy to drink a couple in an evening."
"Centennial is one of the more drinkable IPAs I've had. I love how it is balanced without sacrificing a strong hop character, and I find it to be more sessionable than other IPAs. Truly a fine-drinking India Pale Ale."
"Finally, the taste was a great combo of hoppiness and bitterness that left a sweet, hoppy aftertaste from it's f***ing awesomely balanced brewing."
"D- This is a nice, drinkable beer. I sucked down two fast. Far from world class, and I certainly don't understand the ""A" rating. Pleasant nonetheless."
"I honestly expected better from Founders with respect to this IPA. I have seen where others have given it such high remarks....It gave me me high expectations. Those expectations where not met however. Nonetheless this is a decent beer. It is copper in color with a thin white head....not much lacing...if at all. The scent is decent....remniscent of an IPA. The taste like I say is good, but certainly not the best I ever had. The high alcohole content makes it tough for a session beer...but I would try if challenged. Enjoy!"
"Ending notes: Would definitely get again. Yet another good beer from a solid brewery. Well done, Founders."
"D - Easy to down. Can't get enough, but probably won't go out of my way to get more. That said, I could drink half a six pack before realizing I'd finished one bottle, it goes down so quick!"
"Really refreshing and pleasant to drink over all."
"D- The sourness took away from the beer. Pretty good, but I'd reach for several IPAs before having this again."
"Overall, another solid brew from the Founder's crew. I really seem to like everything coming out of there barn. Wish they were easier to get here in DE."
"Pours a medium copper color with a nice caramel head. Very citrusy, lemony, hoppy smell to this beer. Grapefruit, lemon, and centennial hops rule the day. Same w/ the taste. I get the hops first, followed by grapefruit, quickly followed by lemon. Lemon also is the aftertaste, and it lingers for a long time. Near the end of the beer, the lemon seems to really smooth out. Mouthfeel is good, interesting combination of hops and smoothness in your mouth. This is a really solid beer, maybe not my favorite IPA- but I've really enjoyed it. A good beer by a really good brewery."
"Taste: crunchy caramel, amber malts with moderate bitterness and a strong hop presence. I like the imbalance in this IPA: strong hop flavor, but not too much bitterness along with an interesting malt profile."
"Overall a nice IPA, a bit lacking in the hop profile."
"D - Very good drinkability. Not too high of an ABV, but alcohol still isn't noticeable. Finish makes me want to go back for more. Despite the beer not being as hoppy as expected, it's still very good. I may be under-rating it due to my expectations from west coast IPAs, but I could be wrong."
"D - Yes sir this one is drinkable. Could easily have a couple."
"Poured into a SN tulip. Robust, creamy white head that did not readily dissipate. A solid film lasted throughout the drink with very nice lacing. Color was a slightly cloudy deep orange/amber. The smell was a somewhat muted piney/floral aroma. Taste was upfront bitter hops but also a significant amount of maltiness, so very well balanced. A bright, clean taste with a bittery aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel. Two - three of these would be a good session when you are in the mood for a very well made IPA. Everything about this beer signals quality."
"D: Very high, the balance is remarkable. It makes the beer extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability - at only 65 IBU's this one is more than drinkable for me. I could have a few of these in one sitting and not get tired of it. This is my first brew from Founders, and I am happy to report that it is a very solid offering from Founders!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a orange color with a beatiful creamy white head which leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is very floral and a bit perfume like with notes of pine, resin, grass and caramel. Flavour of grapefruit, citrus, pine, flowers, grass caramel and berries. Mediumbodied. Carbonation is lively with lots of small bubbles."
"Good not great, but I would gladly drink again, wouldn't buy a sixer though."
"Nice drinkable IPA, could easily enjoy a six pack of these."
"D - A bit of a disappointment. Fairly average."
"SOLID."
"This beer is very good. I will definitely buy this beer again."
"interplay. A more malty take on an IPA where the malt doesn't take the place of the hops, but rather compliments it."
"D - Outstanding American IPA. I've managed to stretch this sixer out a while, but it's become apparent to me that I need to procure another. Worth seeking out."
"D: Caramel malt character balanced with some subtle citrus hops create a wonderful brew, one of the best I've had!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. The smooth texture makes it go down easy. It is good but not great but I would definitely try again."
"D- Another solid regular offering from Founders, a very nice unfiltered IPA, I'll definitely pick this one up again, or better yet find a place around here to try it on tap."
"Pours a burnt orange / amber with a nice beige head. Aroma of sweet citrus fruitiness with some floral hops, and some sweet malts. Taste is citrusy floral hops with some caramel malts. Palate is nice med to full bodied, with very good carbonation. Finish is citrusy hops, some fruitiness followed by sweet caramel malts to take the edge off the hoppiness, ending with a dry nutty bitter sweetness. Overall a very nicely balanced IPA."
"D: I would definitely get this one again. Really good hop character and malt profile."
"Poured aggressively, 2-finger head holds firm for a while, color is red-orange, lacing is a little runny. Aroma of fresh tropical-fruit-like hops, and a touch of bread and fresh cookie....very interesting but very excellent. Taste of smooth bitter hops, but without a large lingering bitterness on the palate. Very enjoyable IPA."
"Medium mouth feel with moderate, refreshing carbonation. Super drinkability. Two or three of these in a sitting would definitely be doable. A very good IPA. Recommended for anyone who enjoys hoppy, bitter IPAs."
"M&D- This is a very drinkable beer. The smooth texture of the brew just seems to go down easily. It give a full texture that makes you want to drink more. There is a descent amount of carbonation that tickles the throat and goes down well."
"D: This is a good beer, it almost drinks like a DIPA, which to me, makes it better. It's very hoppy but the sweet malts work well to compliment the bitters. It's very smooth and a well balanced, drinkable IPA."
"D: This is a perfect beer for me when I don't want the punch of most Impy and DIPA's. Great nose, taste, mouthfeel. I would happily purchase a bunch of this if I could. They should distribute to WA state."
"Drinkability: This is a very good IPA. I would definitely be willing to drink a few of these in a sitting, and will come back to it in the future."
"D- Very easy to drink and the complex taste makes it great to return to"
"Has a great weight in terms of palate which makes you want to keep drinking this."
"Great beer. My first time trying it and I'm very impressed. The future will reveal more."
"Overall this was a damn good IPA, no complaints here. The balance between pale malts and citrus hops was great and it did not finish overly bitter. I don't know why I overlooked this IPA but I damn sure wont do it again. Good beer founders, you guys always impress me."
"By far the best Founder's beer I have had, yet it still falls short of their ever present hype. Pours a pretty yellowish orange color with a thick white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of some caramel malts, and a good amount of hops and maybe some citrus. Tastes of citrus/leafy hops, a little grapefruit, and then an explosion of malts (maybe a pale malt.) Far too sweet for an IPA. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is medium."
"This beer is readily available to me and I generally have a sixer of it in my fridge at any given time. I can add nothing to the 1000+ reviews that have been posted for this beer already, but to add that it is a great beer and the key is to get it as fresh as possible."
"Drinkability is pretty high, as its not stringently bitter or overly hoppy. As far as regularly available IPA's go, i'd put it behind 2 Hearted, Stone IPA, and Coronado Islander IPA (and maybe a couple others that aren't popping into my head right now).... overall this is a upper echelon ipa (in terms of year round locally available beers) but there are still a few others i'd put ahead of it... if you are an IPA fan though I would give it a shot."
"Excellent beer I highly recommend it!"
"Have one and enjoy. Not a 2-3 beer sort of beer."
"D -- Excellent. This is a fantastic showcase of prowess by the brewer. Drink up!"
"d 3.5-4 can't go far wrong with this one, but also can't go as far right as i'd prefer. for value (not factored into scoring), at 8.99 a 6er for this, Sierra Nevada Celebration (unless the flavors continue to strike me as a little off) or possibly Torpedo (should do a head to head with this one), both around two bucks less, may be the better buys."
"Bottled 11/29/10."
"This poured a dark amber with 1-2 fingers of head. It has a hoppy smell that you might expect, but there is a malty smell that also comes out in the taste. I should have expected as much from an atypically dark IPA. The taste is hoppy and fruity that is followed by bitterness that lingers...but not unpleasant. It is fairly heavy bodied, so one or two of these will leave you wanting to change it up."
"A good IPA for sure but nothing really outstanding in my opinon."
"D-went down quickly and the tastes stay but not something I'll ever be ordering again. This is by far the worst i've had from Founders yet...but thats not saying a lot because everything else I've had was a gem."
"Quite a drinkable IPA that provides what an IPA should."
"Easy drinking, will definitely have a few of these."
"Overall, a really nice IPA -- not too hoppy, not too complex -- just smooth, sweet, and seductive."
"I had to drink a 2nd one to get the review notes, because the first one went so fast! Super smooth and flavorful, though not overly complex. Near perfect balance and texture. A bit more in the nose would be nice... Really good work-a-day IPA! Sessionably smooth, despite the 7%+...Kinda reminds me of less aggressively hopped and sweeter/maltier Celebration Ale. Impressed. I'd have to say this one and Two Hearted are my two favorite Midwest IPA 6-ers. Strong work Michigan!"
"Drinkability is pretty good I could definately have a couple of these in one sitting."
"Nice beer indeed. I've had this some time back, but hadn't gotten around to reviewing it. Darn shame I waited as long as I did to revisit it, but it was everything I remembered. Good and tasty."
"D - Very good. This is a great IPA and I will be purchasing it again. I am craving another one."
"bottled on 10/28/10 (2 months old)"
"Appearance is a burnt orange/amber color with a good sized head, its` lacing is nice. Smell has pine, grapefruit, orange, hops, all of it is very pleasant. Its taste contains much of the same, with more hops and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Centennial is light on the carbonation and has a pine & hops aftertaste that lingers. One or two of these drink easily. Glad that I finally tried this IPA."
"d. very drinkable, not always interesting, but a good tasty beer. i definitely enjoyed it while it lasted."
"Somehow I've always skipped over this Founders offering, but I figured, here at WhirlyBall, watching my fantasy football teams fail me miserably, I'd finally give it a shot. It pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, flowers, fake grape (sniff a piece of Bubble-Yum grape gum for a proper analogue), and caramel. The taste holds notes of sharp pine, grapefruit, and a nice flow of moderate toffee. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that seems to want to be sticky. Overall, a very nice IPA, no real surprise coming from the people in Grand Rapids."
"Overall a good IPA, but not world-class for me. Seem to get two extremes in same bottle - VERY sweet and very dry at the end. It is that rare beer that excels in both that gets 5's from me. Still recommended, however."
"D- Its definintely an excellent example of the style but its just not a style that i consider to have high drinkability due to the combination of high abv, high hop domination and dry finish. Not refreshing, if anything it makes me more thirsty!"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Glorious amber, brilliantly clear. Fantastic grapefruit, floral, some pine and spice, sweet malt reaches up. Starts a bit sweet then bitterness hits, not overwhelming, solid and long lasting, fading to citrusy goodness. Exceptional. I want this all the time. Now I just have to try this side by side with the 2 hearted to figure out just which one is the winner."
"Nice above medium tea color. Head was nothing exceptional lasted @10 min. very minimal lacing in glass. Hops are definately present with nice influence of citrus. Tastes as it smells nothing really hidden. Strong alcohol but dissipates well. Have to see after more than 1.Went down pretty well(what doesn't?)"
"Poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 10/23/10, nice to see a date, especially on IPAs. Pours a nice slightly hazey orange, with two fingures of sticky head. Lacing hangs around. Love the smell of this IPA, hints of pinapple and pine. Very nice balance off hops and malt. Hopps are the feature, but the malt holds it's own. Very easy to drink for 7.2 abv. I notice that these hopps have held up very well, since my first 3 weeks ago. One of the best IPA's I have had. Hope this won't be my last 6 pack, because they don't distribute in my state. Founders is a amazing brewery!"
"citrus hop aroma. the taste is more balanced, as there are some caramel sweet flavor to balance the hops. very smooth mouthfeel, quite drinkable."
"D-Ah yes, quite drinkable. A flavorful beer but not too bold to take away from its drinkability."
"D-This is a very good IPA and I liked this better than Bell's Two Hearted Ale. I have never seen this available in the PNW and that is unfortunate. I want another."
"As a side note we added a bottle of this to some stew meat for the final boil and it was out of this world good!"
"D: This is one of my favorite IPAs and is tough to beat when fresh."
"D/O- One of the best IPAs I've ever had the pleasure of having. Can't believe it took me this long to try...still haven't had an even ""average"" beer from Founders."
"D-Very drinkable IPA. Goes down smoothly and easily."
"The low bitterness factor and overall hop yum makes this a real winner."
"The beer has everything I like in an IPA: lots of hop presence and acidity, a balanced center, and a nice, bitter finish. This makes the drinkability pretty high for this beer. Founders knocks it out of the park, again proving why it's one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability - A very good and enjoyable IPA. It's easily drinkable and worth a try in my opinion. I could easily make a night out of this even with the higher ABV. Probably couldnt' do this two nights in a row, but definitely a brew I wouldn't turn down if it was offered."
"As far as taste goes, a big grapefruit finish, however sweet in mid palate. Has a wet character very much like a wet hop ale, and masking a very high ABV quite nicely. Mellow aromatics and big grapefruit finish make drinkability quite good."
"D: Very drinkable and hard to stop at one. This is one of my favorite IPAs and I highly recommend this beer."
"d-pretty drinkable if not for the higher ABV. I would buy lots of this if it weren't for the fact that I had to go to Michigan to get it."
"Overall/notes: Hey, first Founders brew! Not at all disappointed by this one. I'm surprised at how smooth this IPA turned out to be. Normally, I associate the style with a harsh, bitter kick, but this one went in another direction. Well worth purchase, will drink again."
"This IPA has the best raw hop flavor of any beer I've had. I think that as a homebrewer, I am exposed to the best ingredients in raw and final form--this beer tastes and smells just like Centennial hops from a new vacuum sealed pack. It has that fruit loops aroma, with a woody depth and grapefruit punch. On the pallet, the hops provide great flavor of fresh peeled pomelo and juicy tangerines. The malt contributes a bit of caramel sweetness and solid body that makes for a luscious well-rounded beer."
"Hazy orange colored IPA bursting with a fresh aroma bursting with earthy, malts, pine, sugar, and hugh hops. Taste is very hoppy and bitter. Great balance of malts, hops, pine, and citrus. Founders is quickly becoming the D-Trains favorite brewery."
"If you're going to name a beer Centennial anything, it better reek of Centennial hops. And this one does. Sharp, prickly piney grapefruit citrus dominate both taste and aroma. Ample caramel biscuity malt backup. While the caramel cake-esque is nice in and of itself, so much caramel detracts from the hops."
"Orange-copper pour with a small, lasting, loose off-white head. Nice wet, fruity citrus hop aroma with some moderate caramel and honey sweetness and some dry floral pine. The flavor follows through from the aroma and is very nicely balanced. No overly aggressive catty hop profile or cloying sweetness just a nicely well rounded and balanced IPA. There is a long dry, lingering piny bitterness on the finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a slightly aqueous finish."
"Poured a gorgeous clear and shimmering orange with a thin but reasonable head into my oversized snifter. Clean and crisp pine and hops on the nose. The taste is a hop bomb. It isn't as balanced as the nose would lead to believe. It's a very good IPA and one for the fans of a heavy hop flavor. It also leaves a nice clean but bitter and dry feeling in my mouth. The crisp tingle is from the ABV methinks and the brew is definitely not syrupy which I dig..but overall a bit too dry and a bit too hop heavy for what I look for in an IPA."
"This may not be the best IPA out there, nor the most complex or mind-blowing, but in my opinion it is exactly what every IPA should be to a ""T". Founders has outdone themselves again by producing essentially the quintessential IPA. Simply outstanding."
"This is a fantastic beer! Coming off of Victory's Yakima Glory I'm just blown away by this one. So well rounded with enough hops and sweetness to keep it interesting! So far in my book Founders can do no wrong."
"A nicely flowing dark IPA. The depth of flavor was very notable and the flavor fit it very nicely. It's a very good IPA with a definite hopsy character, but not over powering. I have to think this was a good IPA, but not the best ever. It's a very versatile beer that would fit in with most any meal or event."
"D-Founders never seizes to amaze me, I like this beer a lot. Definitely something I will have again."
"Drinkability is good, this is a good IPA. It may not rub shoulders with the best IPAs but it's an IPA that isn't totally balanced and is really nice to have around when fresh. Not everyone will love it but it is better than most IPAs."
"D. Easky drinking higher ABV IPA. This is a very solid beer. A bit more malt and piney hops than I personally prefer. Founders makes quality beers that is for sure."
"D: Maybe Founders will occasionally make a brew that I'm not a big fan of (eg. Devil Dancer), but one thing is for certain.... those cats sure know what they're doing!"
"Founders is an excellent brewery and I, for one, am glad to see its wonderful products available here in the East."
"This is a wonderful beer and one I'd be happy drinking several of in a sitting."
"Since I am a regular consumer of FW Union Jack, I imagine I'd add this to my consumption if it were around."
"D- An easy drinker, and not a tad boozy. Also a good showcase for the centennial hop. On top of that it's a solid example of the style, and a good effort from Founders. It didn't blow me away, but I would have no hesitation in picking this up again."
"D-Overall the beer is a drinkable example of an american ipa. The bitterness seems well balanced and the body makes it easy to drink."
"This is just below my first tier of IPA's. Centennial is a really nice beer and it's one that I grab fairly often when available. Nothing new or unique here, just a solid beer like we've come to expect from Founders."
"I had this beer in a bottle, so I can't say much about appearance. This beer is very hoppy, with a distinct citrus aroma. After the first bottle, my impression was WOW! This is the most outstanding IPA I have ever had! After the second, third, fourth... I was even more convinced! For an IPA, this beer goes down extremely well. Go get some!"
"D - AS I said, My new favorite American IPA. A definite crowd pleaser."
"D: This is a very good IPA, key flavors give away that it is just that, an IPA. While flavors are good, there is nothing that stands out and screams ultra special. This is really drinkable in regards to the hidden ABV, the 7.2% is hardly detected and is a really easy drinking beer. Another one of Founder's classics and great style representations."
"Founders Centennial IPA has a cloudy orange colour and a head that is maintained by good carbonation. The smell is of hops with some citrus character. The initial taste is quite bready but quickly adds tangy citrus hops to the palate. This all fades into a smooth aftertaste. Surprisingly, not really bitter at all. This beer has nice foamy feel to it. Delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is good and surprisingly light for a beer of this magnitude. Drinkability scores high.. this is one you could just keep pounding back until the lights go dim."
"This is a fantastic beer. I could overindulge on this fine brew because its hits so many high points for me. Highly recommend to all IPA lovers."
"Solid IPA by Founders Brewing."
"D - Good IPA. I could drink this all day long. Good solid flavor and smell."
"So all in all I think this is a really good IPA. I have had many of these and I'm sure I will have many more. Good job Founders. Cheers."
"Very good, but with high abv beware. If you don't have anything to do, go anywhere that day, or have any responsibilities at all, go for it. Indulge in the nectar of the Godz. Amazing IPA."
"Picked up a six pack to enjoy over the weekend. Pours a garnet red into my Perfect Pint Glass. The hops aroma jumps out of the glass at you. The big aroma did not translate to the taste though which was incredibly well balance with some grassy malts. Not nearly as hoppy as I was anticipated. The bitterness was moderate, but enjoyable. Through three bottles, it proved to be an extrordinarily well balance and well crafted American IPA."
"I never read other reviews before I do mine, but then I check and come back if I missed something major. Yeah, this beer is a solid A- by almost all accounts. The minus I think is that antiseptic flavor that creeps up on you."
"The beer pour a hazy orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is oranges, papayas and pine. Very hoppy smelling. The flavor is a mix of orange and grassy hops with some bready and toffee malt. Low to medium bitterness. All things considered, this is a fairly balanced IPA that has a lot of flavor from the hops and malt. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: Good overall drinkability."
"D/N: This is one of the better IPA's I've had. If I didn't know it was Founders I would have thought it was any number of the amazing IPA's on the West Coast - the beer has that refreshing, clean bitter-sweet complex. Any hophead could drink this all night, and the amazing balance of flavors make this a good introductory beer for the style."
"Very drinkable for over 7%. Rich mouthfeel; coats tongue and palate."
"This is 7.2% ABV but I'd never know it as the flavor and overall smoothness hides the alcohol quite well. That doesn't mean that it's exceptionally drinkable though. Despite its relative smoothness it is still a very full-flavored brew. However, this is one of the more drinkable IPAs that I've sampled. I wouldn't hesitate to hand one of these to someone to initiate them to the style. It's quite good, even straight from the bottle."
"This pours a dark orange with a nice frothy head that fades down to a ring and an island, and has great lacing. On the nose it's a citrus combination of lemon and orange, maybe wet straw, a nice nose. On the tongue there is the citrus right up front that fades into a pretty deep hop bitterness that sticks around. Maybe some sweeter notes in there, too. I'll have to revisit that as my palate develops. In the mouth the feel is a light-medium body. Some IPAs are like buzzsaws, this is more restrained and pleasant. Overall I like this beer and can drink a few of them in a row with no problem. One of the better IPAs I'm familiar with, right there with Two-Hearted and Stone."
"I hope I can get a keg of this sometime for the kegerator!"
"D-Very high drinkability here even with the moderate ABV."
"Highly recommend. Cheers!"
"One of the best!"
"D - This is nice beer from the Midwest. I feel spoiled by the hop bombs we get in California and this beer is a great entry amongst those. Its very easy to drink and tastes great. Too bad its not available in California."
"Taste-Citrus, piney hop note, tangerine, sweet pineapple. Hop bite is surprisingly mild for an IPA, but has all the flavor. Very drinkable. Another winner from Founder's!"
"Founders Brewing Company has not let me down thus far. All of their beers are outstanding (and if you disagree, name the beer and I'd like to try it). Bravo on this one."
"isn't it eery how dreams mirror reality?"
"Drinkabilty - This is so mellow and smooth, you can pound this down. But at 7.2 be careful. I was expecting more hop taste, but ended up with a mild solid ipa. This would be a wonderful starter to get someone into a ipa. Id drink this again but with stone ipa, racer 5 and commidore perry, i wouldnt take this over them."
"This beer doesn't get the love it deserves! I think this ranks up there with Bell's Two Hearted, and it is certainly better than the Stone IPA."
"The beer is a light amber color with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The smell is strong, very hoppy and complimented by notes of citrus and caramel. The taste is extremely balanced from start to finish. The combination of hops bitterness, caramelized malt and citrus sweetness blend together excellently. The hops flavor is the slightly more dominant one and comes out a little bit in the after-taste, but that's to be expected. Very smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, clean & dry finish. This beer has all of the elements to be the one that you stay with all night long. It's very tasty, has a good kick, not-too-filling and is another one of those beers where you just keep craving the sip."
"D: Very high, for a drinkable IPA, you won't find one that is much better than this."
"Over the top bitterness ruins this for me. The nose showed some promise, but overall not a lot going on. Just a big bitterness. If you are a hop head, grab it. If you are looking for an IPA with some sort of balance (which an IPA should have no matter what anyone says) pass this by."
"D - Quite a nice beer with wonderful complexity and taste. Definitely one of the finer IPAs I've had that I could certainly go back to."
"D: Another great beer from Founders. Again, this is a very fresh and clean tasting IPA with a pretty decent hop punch. If I could get this locally I'd buy it often."
"Got this one as an extra in a recent trade, and decided now was the time. Pours a nice medium golden color, with a decent white head. Nice aromas here, all citrus and piney hops. Not a whole lot more on the palate, and although this one claims 7.2 ABV, I'm not really getting it. Good, serviceable."
"The nose has much more bready malt than I recall from the bottled version. There is plenty of citrus/floral goodness and a touch of pine, which turns out to be the most assertive hop flavor. Good level of bitterness, although it finishes a touch watery. Problem with the keg, perhaps? Definitely not the scorchingly bitter brew I remember, although still quite tasty and enjoyable. The caramel presence and lack of sticky/resiny mouthfeel keep this in 'good, not great' territory (although I highly recommend the bottled version- see my other review)."
"D. Good, but I wouldn't care for more than one in a sitting."
"D: A great IPA, certainly one I would seek out again. This IPA goes down really easy and smoothly."
"This one is just a little thick/heavy for the style which affects drinkability, but oh so good overall."
"Poured into a pint glass. It's slightly cloudy and amber with a nice sized head that does kind of recede quickly. There is some obvious carbonation going on here as well. Smells of blatant hops and some caramel and malt notes. There's obviously a lot of hops in the taste, but it's well balanced by the malt. Malt flavor is obviously present, but is muted enough to just balance the hops bitterness without overpowering it. It has a very nice medium body with slight creaminess. It's very drinkable. Probably my favorite IPA to have several of in one sitting."
"Really a great IPA, not sure there is much better."
"D:Fours all across the board, A very session able IPA with a nice ABV that stills pack a nice punch of what it's all about..Hops. Another well done IPA from Michigan"
"Great beer and very drinkable. Just the right amount of flavor and not too strong at 7.2%."
"Notes: A nice, hoppy IPA that is refreshing and has a nice level of bitterness. Plenty of hop flavors that are pretty tasty. I would gladly keep drinking more of this. Solid example of an American IPA."
"D: Moderate. 7.2% could catch up quicker than expected."
"D: unlike many IPAs, invites re-drinking time and again"
"The mouthfeel is on the high side of medium, thicker than most IPAs. There's also a good amount of carbonation for an IPA, but nothing to turn me off. This is fairly drinkable, but the alcohol burn in the aftertaste isn't overly enjoyable. All-in-all a great brew."
"This is a fine example of the style with traditional character and very tasty. This is an easy beer to enjoy and puts its best foot forward."
"Very tasty and easy drinking beer, here. I wish that I could get this stuff all the time."
"Pleasantly surprised by my experience with this on tap, if you were not a fan of it in a bottle i highly recommend trying it on tap"
"Deep orange, copper color with a heavy haze and a thin white head that reduces to a nice white cap. Very fresh smelling floral and citrus orange aromas. A very slight hint of biscuit malt too. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Starts out with hoppy orange character followed by a slowly intensifying malty middle. As soon as there seems to be a hoppy/malty balance there's an intense orange flavor that leads to a slightly bitter but dry finish. Lots of character in this very smooth and refreshing IPA."
"O: This was a very good IPA smooth easy drinking lots of citrus. I do prefer Two Hearted in the ""head to head"" Centennial matchup."
"A nice IPA from Founders for sure. I like the Double Trouble more but still a solid beer you can always count on."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange Into a Duvel Tulip. There was an inch foamy head, that slowly made it's way down to about a quarter inch head that stayed all the way down. There were ring's of lacing that followed the head as I sipped. The scent was perfect for an IPA, very hoppy and spicy with some piney notes. A slightly sweet citrusy taste up front is balanced off nicely by a very nice bitter finish. There is about as good of a balance as one would want with an IPA. This is nice IPA, I only wish I bought more than 1 in a mix pack. I should have known it would be great coming from Founders."
"Served up a reddish amber with a frothy white head that leaves near perfect lacing. The aroma is wonderfully fresh and hoppy with plenty of grapefruity, and slightly pithy character. I also detect a healthy helping of caramel malt that gives the nose some sugary tropical like notes as well. The flavor is just as nice as the aroma and is full of grapefruit, pine, bitter pith and biscuity, slightly caramel malt. This beer is quite bitter, but also quite malty. It seems like the two opposites play off each other and improve the hop flavor as a result. Whatever the reason, this IS a tasty beverage. The body is medium, and a bit heavier than your run of the mill IPA, but not out of control. It is super smooth and the finish is well balanced. Very drinkable, and another contender on my list of go to IPAs."
"Drinkability is high. Only have a single bottle, but I could drink more and each sip invites the next one."
"D- Nice drinkable IPA, great flavor profile, good balance, very well crafted beer, definitely one that I will try again."
"This is a very solid IPA that largley misses the mark of that other, better all-Centennial IPA from Michigan (Bell's Two Hearted Ale)."
"another thanks to irishkyle21 for sending this one my way I enjoyed it and will be looking for it in the future"
"Bottle. Bottled on 6/17/10, reviewed on 7/21/10. Pours a nice orange color with a fluffy 2 finger slightly tan head. The aroma is rind and pine with some other citrus notes. Smooth and balanced are the words that come to mind as I drink this. Not extreme one way of the other. I very nice hop bite and bitterness followed by a silky maltiness. Lingering bitterness afterward. A classis IPA in my book. Dangerously drinkable with a 7.2% abv!"
"Poured this one into a pint glass and it looked pretty nice. Deep amber color with a perfect one-finger tan head. Smelled like beer should smell to a hophead like myself. Piney hop aromas. Taste was very nice as well with the hops dominant but well-balanced with some maltiness. A bit more subdued perhaps than I was hoping in my twisted hop-loving mind, but really really solid. As a result, it's incredibly drinkable for an IPA with 7.2% abv, maybe dangerously so. I could definitely drink 5 or 6 in a row, and the only thing that would suffer is my behavior. Another great beer from Founders, who can pretty much do no wrong. Would like to try Devil Dancer as I could have taken some more hops and some more intensity. Good stuff."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Clear, light copper pour with quickly fading head and great lacing. Nice fruity, citrus nose with an underlying spiciness as well as a hint of caramel malt. Unique and complex taste with mandarin oranges, tea, fresh hop resin, pine, and grapefruit, all complemented by a solid sweet malt base. Great chewy, thick mouthfeel without being syrupy. Perfect balance and over the top drinkability. This is my first experience with Founders. Lives up to everything I've heard."
"D: This beer is drinkable. At 7.2%, the alcohol is well hidden. Being from Founders, I was expecting a little more from their IPA. It was a treat, but I don't know how often I would purchase this beer if it were available to me regularly."
"Very rich IPA, dark, malty looking pour, but with the first sip, I realize how hoppy this beer is. Very hoppy, indulgent offering from Founders. Very tasty and rich, I was very satisfied with this beer, well balanced hops and malt, as well as a fruity flavor mixed in."
"D: This is a great IPA, goes down very nice on a hot day, very refreshing. I could easily get in trouble with this given the alcohol level. I don't like everything that Founders does, but this one is done right, highly recommended."
"Conclusion- An extremely refined and rewarding beer. Although it does not lack in a forward taste and aroma profile I feel this beer could be overlooked. The balance is exceptional. All major parts are distinguished but everything still behaves in a symbiotic panacea."
"D- I would have no problem drinking 2 or 3 of these. A model IPA."
"Excellent IPA compares favorably with some of the best such as Stone, and Southern Tier. Dark amber color. Well balanced flavor. Hoppy, but not overlwelmingly so. Very smooth for an IPA with an ABV this high. I highly recommend trying it on draft if you can find it."
"again, for the ABV, quite drinkable. at 7.2%, a scary, lovely sessioner for hopsters"
"Mobile review"
"Great drinkability. Wish I had more than 1!"
"Very tasty stuff. Full bodied with lingering hop bitterness, some fruity malt characters... if an IPA could come out of my faucet I would not mind if it was this one. Reminds me quite a bit of the Sculpin IPA I had not too long ago. Similar characteristics."
"enjoy it"
"Drinkability - very drinkable but I doubt I'll be getting this again. In a market saturated with IPA's there's just better ones out there. I enjoyed this beer but there are better IPAs for the money."
"D- Easy to drink and very enjoyable, just a solid IPA."
"T- There's a nice sweet hop taste that comes through at first. And a biting spiciness. I think there is some apple or watermelon, or some sweet fruit, in there as well. Very good."
"Drinkability is pretty well for a 7.2% abv. If i were to do a blind tasting of 10-20 IPA's i would be able to pick this one out easily. Very distinct flavor that i will need to come back to explore when a bit more fresh."
"Loads of hops on the palate. Pine, grapefruit citrus all backed up by a mild but somewhat balancing malt bill."
"All in all, this one was a good surprise. This one is not bad at all. Not amazing, but still a solid brew. Not worth hunting, but definitely try if you have access."
"Poured a golden-amber hue, with two fingers of white head, good head retention, and great lacing. Modest visible carbonation. The nose picked up grapefruit, orange peel, pine, lemon, earthiness, and bitter hops. The taste began on a citrus note, evolved to a more balanced malty/pine note, and then finished on a dry bitter peel note. Standard yet good flavor progression for a respectable ipa. Good smooth, modestly carbonated, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Good session ipa."
"The maltiness of this beer makes it feel full bodied but in lots of ways it's fairly thin and easy to drink. This is a nice IPA that's high on bitterness & hop flavor. A robust IPA. Quite nice."
"D: Very drinkable beer. The alcohol does become more present as it warms, but isn't a bad taste. Still a very good beer that easily would put into a pick 6 anytime."
"D/O- A pretty average and forgettable IPA in my opinion. Besides the freaking awesome mouthfeel on this one, there's not much else for me to enjoy. My bottle was less than 3 weeks old so I don't think the hops could have faded in that amount of time. There's better IPAs out there so I probably won't be revisiting this one anytime soon. If it available, give it a try, you might dig it. Cheers."
"What else can be said that hasn't been said already? Amazing beer. Pours a copperish amber. Great hop aroma of piney citrus. Smells of mango, pineapple, and pure hop zest. Taste is equally great, but what I really enjoy is the firm balance between malt & hops. A very drinkable brew; although I'm not sure how many I could finish before falling off my bar stool. The 7.2 ABV sounds slightly formidable but it really doesn't show after the first couple of pints. Splendid beer! A great hophead pleaser if needed."
"I'd like to give a 4.25 for taste and a 4.25 for drinkability."
"I can't believe how well the hops held up after nine months! you can tell they have faded but this beer is still amazing!"
"Moderate hop aroma with a sweet flowery after taste. Plenty of foam in the glass. A nice cloudy unfiltered appearance. It is really craft beer at its finest. This beer is surprisingly sessionable, even though it is realatively high in alcohol (7.20). This is an overall outstanding beer."
"A: Finger thickness of head with decent retention, light amber in color - 4.00, S: Tons of bubble gum and tropical fruit - I picked up papaya primarily as well as a melon-like sweetness, very floral and inviting, all around one of the nicest and hoppiest aromas I've experience on an IPA in some time - 4.75, T: A sharp but not an obtrusive bitterness, dry grain and very mild alcohol burn, grapefruit pith and pine sap, some caramel in the back of the beer, balance falls a little to the side of hops but that's not a problem in my book - 4.00, M: Creamy and medium mouth feel - 4.00, D: A very drinkable IPA, amazing nose - 4.00"
"Overall, a very good, solid IPA from a brewery that consistently delivers."
"Excellent drinkability. Had this beer before in a bottle but didnt review it then."
"D - A great hoppy beer. What's not to love?"
"The palate opens with a moderate blend of caramel and more clean sugar, with some hop bitterness. While this isn't sweet per se, the malt does carry some sweet flavors in. Hop flavor is light to moderate, with moderate orange and floral components. Sweet, smooth finish with some bitterness that's mildly grassy. Medium-light in body with excellent carbonation and a great finish, this feels surprisingly smooth on the palate. At first, I didn't enjoy it, but I ended up drinking over a pint of it."
"D - Could easily drink a few of these if not for the ABV. Great, rock-solid IPA from Founder's, one that always has a place in my fridge."
"D - While this isn't a session beer I could definitely drink more than I should of these in a sitting with the great taste that it offers worth picking up sometime to try"
"Drinkability: This is really an all day kind of beer - wonderful flavors and a body that isn't overly heavy provide for a very refreshing beer... The only downfall to sipping on this one from morning to night would be the 7.2% ABV, while it's not especially high or back breaking, after a couple you definitely feel it."
"Pretty good."
"Poured this into my tulip. Looks a nice amber color with about an inch of frothy off white head with big bubbles. Good retention on this guy. Little pockets of visible carbonation are apparent on the side. Smells great, a nice floral bouquet of piney hops and citrus. Is that pineapple I smell? Not quite as juicy as the smell led me to believe, but a delicious hop flavor none the less. I would love to taste more of that outstanding citrus I got in the nose, however, it's not absent, just not a prevalent as I was led to believe. Pretty good mouth feel but a little bit syrupy. The carbonation is perfect though. 7.2 seems a little bit of a high abv for an IPA like this, but I'm not scared off by something like that, I just think I would only have one in a sitting. Also, the how syrupy this is detracts a little bit and it isn't as refreshing as I want from the style."
"D - I love the flavors in this beer and could sip on it all night. Not harsh in any way but very hop-forward and balanced."
"D- the flavors can get a little overwhelming, and you can taste the alcohol sometimes, but otherwise...this is a nice hop hit that is good drinkin"
"D- crisp and refreshing with a clean and clear flavor. No hint of the abv and at 7.2 its well done. I love this stuff. Well done. So drinkable I'm getting another."
"Founders does quality work, and this is a prime example: no complaints whatsoever, and considering I only paid $1.79 for the bottle, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
"goes down fine. nothing detracts. the bitterness is accentuated by the carbonation keeping this from being terribly refreshing. complexity is lacking a bit, but wasn't expected too much, either. a good beer, but nothing that sets itself above the rest."
"M/D: Medium to light bodied. A good IPA, but not my favorite. It is pretty easy drinking and is well balanced and does not leave an overly bitter aftertaste."
"Poured into a pint glass and noticed a very crystal clear light copper coloration, nice white head that lingered for a few minutes before disappearing. Smells great, very fragrant, floral and piney hop aromas all around. Tastes much the same of how it smells which is awesome, very clean and crisp hop flavors here with a nice caramel malt sweetness underneath the hops. A nice balance of piney floral hops in this beer. The hop flavors don't linger on the palate for long which quickly makes you wanna take another sip followed by another. Very smooth mouthfeel with a light almost medium mouthfeel. This beer drinks with the best of them, very easy going down and oh so refreshing. A must try."
"The taste has a lot of sweetness and some caramel flavor to it. Full bodied and smooth. Almost a creamy sweetness to carry some of the hop bitterness. Definitely drink this again."
"Don't pass this one up if you like IPA's. It really does not get much better than this. I have not tried a Founders I didn't like."
"Drinks wonderfully. No problem putting back several of these. One of my favorite IPA's."
"Overall - A supremely good IPA - big, bold and full of flavour but incredibly balanced... highly recommended"
"D-a really nice IPA; well balanced, yet has a nice hop kick that most are looking for; the malt balance isn't overly earthy, but has a nice sweet caramel type flavor"
"Pretty drinkable. I like it."
"Poured a murky orange color with a head that dissolved immediately. I pick up caramel and sweet malt smells in the nose. Maybe a little melon and pineapple as well. I don't get to drink too many IPAs that aren't west coast very often, but this one pretty much tastes like I expected...but a little better. The sweet caramel and malts are right up front and the bitter hops linger on the back of the tongue. This beer has a slight chewiness to it, which I enjoy. This beer does not seem like it is 7.2 ABV... I feel as if I could drink a sixer of this to myself. Solid IPA."
"Drinkability was also wonderful. I went back for a second and enjoyed that just as much. Founders coming through with a HUGE variant here!"
"What a great IPA. I love the whole package. The only complaint was it seemed overly carbonated. Nice copper color could be lighter? Nice balance between bitterness and aroma. I love centennial hops and this is the perfect showcase. The mouthfeel and body just help cary all the flavors along your pallet."
"D - A very good IPA. Nice to have a single-hopped IPA to really see the true characteristics of Centennial hops."
"This is always a good one from Founders. A must try for those who love hoppy beers and IPAs. Seek this one fresh."
"I poured into a pint glass to an off white head. It is amber colored. The aroma is a medley of pine and citrus, orange, grapefruit, lemon. The taste seems to focus more on the bitter pine. I was hoping the citrus would come through more. It has a medium body. It has more flavor than a lot of IPA's but I'm a bigger fan of the citrus leaning IPA's."
"Amber to orange coloring with an inch of slightly yellow/off-white head out of the growler (thanks, buschbeer.) Heavy pine and citrus hops in the aroma. The pine makes itself known early and then a lemon/orange citrus lingers. There's a peppery pine that dominates the taste. The citrus just seems to hang around offering subtle grapefruit notes. There's also a tropical fruit thing going on if you wait long enough between drinks. This isn't hugely bitter until the end, but the malts add to a very nice balance. I really like the bitter finish this beer leaves. Somehow the resiny hops and carbonation this beer has makes it feel more viscous than it actually is. Another winner from Founders."
"Pours a nice pale orange. Good aroma of pine and juicy citrus, and hops. This is just what you want in a IPA. Nice big hop flavors, but nothing that will kill your tastebuds. Has that nice pine/grapefriut taste,that ends in a little bitter at the end. This keeps you coming back for more. Very drinkible for the 7.2 ABV. This is one of the best IPA's I've had, just a classic example of the style."
"Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange with off white foam head from the bottle into a pint glass. Aroma is big citrusy hops with a slight touch of sweet malt balance. Hops in the palate give it a great orange peel/grapefruit bitterness. Really makes you pucker up. Nice bubbly carbonation. An excellent IPA altogether! Very drinkable for 7.2% ABV."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's a very nice IPA. I really enjoyed this beer and would buy it again. It wasn't anything fancy, just a well made IPA with some very good hoppy and bitter flavors."
"D - Nice interpretation of the west coast IPA style and very drinkable even given the 7.2% ABV. Nice beer!"
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, but the bitterness might get to me after a couple of these."
"Great beer! satisfy the hop cravign pretty quick!"
"D: a very nice ""no coast"" IPA. This one must be enjoyed extra fresh as I have tried it on multiple occasions and have had much less enjoyable experiences. The hops shine and the malt profile provides a great depth. Another great brew from Founders!"
"drinkability: one of the best IPAs by one of the best breweries in the country."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a tight creamy head that settled into a sparse cap. Definitely a couple shades darker than your typical AIPA. The aroma is full of juicy hops, very floral with a hint of tropical fruit. The flavor is of a tropical fruit hop profile with some grassy hop bitterness towards the end. Perhaps a touch of asprin. The tropical fruit hop flavor blends nicely with the steely caramel malt, good transition between the two. The grassy bitterness helps cut the sweetness. The beer has a moderate feel with fizzy carbonation, sweet overall but finishes with a hoppy bitterness; slightly sticky. A good balanced AIPA, a bit too much on the tropical fruit side but still enjoyable."
"No surprise here...another solid beer from Founders."
"D - A drinkable IPA but not on my toplist."
"D: Great example of the style. Could drink this any day."
"Founders has done it again for me."
"I can see me wanting more of this very soon."
"drinkability is good and goes down easy. maybe not a session beer, but certainly delicious and to style. to me this comes across as being just a little bit better in each category than most of the ipa's i have had."
"Summary: Very good ale that I will certainly buy again. I could drink several of these at a time."
"fine crafted brew. on the heavier side of ipa. a little tough to drink a few."
"Good drinkability."
"D: Pretty drinkable in comparison to some IPA's, which are known more for their flavor and complexity, than for their sessionabilty. (not a word). Even so, this one is definitely full of flavor, and pretty drinkable as well."
"D - Well I guess IPA's aren't really my thing and west coast hops seem to hate me as well. Have it again? Pass..."
"pours a very hazy copper color with a good inch of fluffy off-white head. lots of carbonation but it's kind of hard to tell because the beer is so hazy. citrus-piney hop smell and taste with a very bitter aftertaste. extremely tastey beer. probably the quickest beer i ever drank that didn't invole a beer bong or beer drinking game. seeing that i only had one to drink it was probably a stupid idea, but i couldn't help myself. very very good"
"D: Despite ABV, I am still able to much appreciate the above into pint number two. Cheers!"
"D: I think i benefited from having a very fresh version of this as any bit of age would be a deterant to some of the fresh flavors."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thin white head that doesn't retain well. The smell is significantly better, with a huge piney, floral, juicy, and citrusy hoppy character upfront, along with some biscuit and caramel, fruity esters and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with a big centennial blast upfront (citrusy, piney, resiny, etc.), followed by some caramel sweetness, fruity esters, biscuity malt, and an alcohol wallop. The mouthfeel is on the thick/oily side, and drinkability is good for the style/ABV. Really good IPA here, maybe a bit one dimensional with only Centennial hops used, but still rather extremely tasty."
"Drinkability: While this brew is extremely good, palate fatigue may be an issue. Two of these is probably good for me, but I'm definitely going to enjoy them."
"Robust flavor profile indicates this IPA is on the malty end of the spectrum. A ton of toasted and caramel malt is balanced by the 65 IBUs and juicy hop flavor. In the end though, this beer doesn't quite satisfy my hop fix. It's too balanced and doesn't fulfill my expectations of a beer labeled ""Centennial IPA."" I want my ass to get kicked by citrusy American hops, but what I get is an insanely drinkable 7.2 percent ABV brew. This is a really nice beer, just not what I was expecting."
"D - If you like citrusy American hops then you will love this beer. It's that simple."
"D - Very drinkable for an IPA at 7.2% ABV and 65 IBUs."
"This beer is just great to drink. Founders lives up to their reputation with this one. I see why its rated what it is."
"I am so glad to have stumbled on this today! One of the more complex and balanced IPA's out there"
"Feel/Drink: Mouth is nice and drinkability is great. This is really delicious."
"The carbonation is medium strong with very small yet very fresh bubbles. The liquid is semi-smooth with out any stickiness."
"Overall: It's a very well balanced IPA well worth the $9 for a sixer."
"D: Relatively easy to drink; the alcohol content is well masked."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable thats for darn sure, I find this to be an excellent example of what i expect from an IPA, the finish is fantastic and the balance is very much what I enjoy, walks that fine line of what I look for as being strongly hopped but with still a balance to leave me wanting more then one, definitely a beer I will have many more times and recommend as a great example of the style"
"D - I could drink a few of these. One of the more solid IPAs I've encountered."
"How I wish I didn't buy more than two bottles of this one..."
"D: Always something good from Founders. This drinks easy, and is pretty cheap too."
"M/D- medium bodied, good carbonation. very nice drinkability. i would like to see a little more hop pnch in the flavor but an all around very pleasurable IPA."
"This bottle is well over six months old, so I'm sure it's lost some of its punch. That's alright, since I generally most enjoy the mellower IPAs anyway. Still, I'd like to try some fresh Centennial to see how much of a kick it has."
"More of that in the taste. Yum. Hop forward dry hopped big time. Holds up throughout the bottle, decent price, for such a high quality IPA. Lots of brewers would charge you for a .22 of this, what Founders charges for a 6er. Nice."
"This is a solid American IPA. I would give this to someone who wanted to know what an American IPA style is like. Bouquet has the nice sharp hop and the flavor follows suit. Appearance was light amber and clear with nice carbonation. Perfect balance of body to hop - with the edge given to the hop as it should be with this style."
"D_ Easy to drink. Good go to IPA."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel and for 7.2%, this masquerades as a session brew."
"So I've been hearing about Founders coming to New York for weeks and have been looking forward to the introduction since it was announced. The Centennial was the first one I tried and I wasn't quite as impressed as I hoped to be. It was a good IPA but not as hoppy or characterful as I had hoped. After I tried the the other three varieties and loved them so much I will definitely try this again. If my opinion changes, I'll repost."
"Certainly a great IPA, always worth a try and probably a rebuy."
"Pours a dark translucent amber with a good, fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is hoppy with fruity and malty undertones, quite tempting. Flavor is strongly hoppy and fairly bitter but not too strongly so. Lively, tingly, fizzy texture leaves a nice hoppy finish. Recommended to all hop lovers."
"Drinkability - easily put back a sixer (and plan on it! tonight)in a night. 7.2% alcohol is pretty nice as well. Will have again, soon!"
"I was really stoked to get such a fresh sample of this and man did it pay off. An excellent IPA, and once again Founders continues to impress."
"Mouthfeel - Very smooth, creamy medium body with low carbonation."
"d- nice drinkability here, i would drink this ipa again for sure. i'm really starting to love founders line-up as a delve deeper!"
"Smooth, creamy, consistent taste all the way till the grapefruit finish. A nice long lingering hoppiness."
"D- The bite from this beer is a little more harsh than others which takes away from the drinkability. I would say that I would max at two of these before my palate is fatigue."
"Smell is piney hops, and biscuity malts. Taste is the same. The hop bitterness lingers quite a while, but there is very little oily feel, which I enjoy in this style. A good solid highly drinkable brew none the same. Very well balanced."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable and easily sessionable. The alcohol is not immediately obvious."
"Cheers!!"
"D-This beer is very drinkable because it is so delightful. It's alcohol of 7.2% ABV is well hidden, while bringing me back for another sip of this delicious, hoppy concoction."
"D - Very drinkable. Low abvs make this one dangerous. i could easily put away six of these.. especially on a nice spring/summer day.. i feel like i could do these all nite... sorry i have to drive an hour to get these!"
"The flavor is grapefruit and lemon--Centennial hops!--over a nice malt backbone that works really well together, although the mouthfeel is a little bit sticky and not as creamy as I might like. Still, it's a very refreshing drink, and the hops are balanced against enough of a caramel malt that it never becomes aggressive, which makes it a great drinking IPA. Will definitely be drinking again!"
"Taste: There is a really good flavor that is a little bit toasted that finishes off with a floral hop taste. Very good and not what I expected."
"What most impressed me about this beer is that it's only 65 IBU's but convinces your palette that it's higher. Alcohol warming starts to show through after awhile, but that's O.K., this is one tasty IPA."
"Pours out a hazy orange-red with a two finger, white head. The head is very frothy/creamy and retains very nicely. A huge coat of lacing starts to be left during the first sips. The frothy head seems to almost solidify at one and a half fingers. Some of the best lacing and head I have ever seen. Smell consists of a good dose of earthy, floral and some fruity hops. The hops are balanced out by a nice malt backbone that has some caramel scent to it. The strength is nice and makes for a good aroma. Perhaps a bit more hop aroma and a bit less of the caramelly malt would work better for my IPA expectations, still a good smell though. Taste is pretty much the same. The bitterness comes through at a very good level for my taste. It helps the hop flavors (earthy, floral, pine mostly for me). A bit of an orange peel flavor comes through also. The malt backbone is still highly present and helps balance the beer. Once again it seems like the hops die down except for the bitterness. I would like the hop flavor to shine for the whole experience. I am left with a nice flavor though, just more malty than I would like. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with low-medium carbonation. A bit more carbonation would help for the flavors and some creaminess to the body too. A nice coat of bitters is left on the tongue. The creaminess would help make it feel less watery. Drinkability is good. The beer tastes good and has a decent six-pack price. The alcohol is well hidden and does not come through at all. I could session this but at the same price the Red's Rye PA has a better flavor and is a better beer. A nice example of bittering levels and malt backbone but falls short on actual hop flavor for an IPA, IMO."
"Clear red-ish golden pour that releases a huge fragrant bouquet of citrus and yeasty bread. Citrusy style hops are the standout first and foremost, with some minor pine notes, and smaller tropical fruit notes making their presence as the hops fade on the finish. A tiny bit of a malt backbone, not quite East-Coast style, but this is no west coast paint stripper. A creamy one with good strong carbonation, could drink as many as you'd enjoy."
"Nice color, good head. Overall a nicely balanced IPA. This beer tasted good, looked good and felt good. Founders countinues to impress me with their overall selection of fine distinct beers. This is a beer I would love to keep around for just any occasion."
"Overall, a good beer. I would recommend."
"I was told as I drank this that this is the beer they judge other IPAs against as it is in the middle of the style - don't know if it is true or not but I could see it being true."
"D: Given how it's only 65 IBU's and 4 months old at this point, I'm quite impressed by the pop from the hops. I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of a good malt backbone, actually. Good hop complexity, but pretty boring."
"This is a very good solid IPA from the brewery quickly closing in on my favorite brewery pick. This is well balanced with a good malt presence of an American IPA. I can compare it to Sierra Nevadas Torpedo with a better aroma. Good citrus fruits in the taste would pair extremely well at a backyard grilling party. I will be seeking this out again this summer."
"O: This is one of the few D/IPAs that I've had that can truly rival Bell's Two Hearted, yet it can't unseat it."
"D: this is a good ipa it is drinkable and smooth the chosen hops work well together to create a snappy clean finish. well crafted ipa. not over the top on the hops and there is a backbone of malt that is actually detectable; giving complexity to the beer, which I look for in ipa's ( I am not a hop head) I would buy this one again. quite tasty yet again, another good brew by founders"
"If it weren't for the 7.2% ABV, I could drink this all night. A very well balanced IPA from Founders. They continue to put out amazing beers. Very well done, deserves its place on my list of Fav's next to 60 Minute, Two Hearted and Pliny!"
"Big hops with great citrus scent and taste. Pours a relatively clear orange with good amount of head. Pairs well with salads and veggies with hummus. I really like this IPA alot because of it's drinkability and dry finish. Picked up a case in PA, only to find out it's now avialable in GA!"
"All in all, a very enjoyable IPA. I didn't identify any characteristics that made me go ""WOW"" but it also didn't do a single thing wrong. It was just a very good IPA all around."
"The drinkability is ok, not what I expect from founders...it wont be a regular in my fridge but I'd try it again if I saw it on draft/at a party."
"Mmm, like and creamy with an up front flavor of tasty citrus hops that is suddenly backed up with a strong herbal bitterness. The flavor on this just lingers on the tongue forever, with the stronger herbal flavor riding shotgun in the after taste, but it's not overwhelming in any way. The mouth feel of this stands out as being smooth and just the right consistency. Overall this is yet another reason Founders is an amazing addition to our state. The price and quality of this is so just, and the beer so good."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a chalice. Cloudy copper orange color, with minimal head. Smells of grapefruit, pine needles and honey. Taste is bitter, loads of hops and grapefruit. Not to the extreme, this is very refreshing without much alcohol presence and drinkable. This is a classic IPA."
"Great beer."
"The hops give this beer a somewhat oily mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Very good drinkability. As is usually the case, Founders has created another very good beer."
"OVERALL: After all the hype and anticipation I found Centennial IPA was a solid, but slightly disappointing beer. Good, but not great. That said, I think it would be an excellent introduction to the style for someone who isn't necessarily an IPA drinker."
"Okay, that's a delicious IPA. REALLY delicious. Gives-""Bell's Two Hearted""-a-run-for-its-money delicious. So incredibly well balanced between crisp, biscuity pale malts and a resinous fresh-hop profile that delivers fruity citrus notes and spicy, bitter alpha acids to the sides of the tongue. Mouthfeel is perfect. Can't really imagine improving the medium body...carbonation level is right on, and the beer finishes smooth and crisp with a lingering green hoppiness. I could drink this beer every single day not and not get tired of it. Founders hits it out of the park with this IPA. Can't say I'm terribly surprised given their track record, but DAMN--these guys are batting near 0.900!"
"Gotta love when the roommate goes to MI and brings back beers we can't get here in NY"
"If you are a fan of hoppy beers and the Centennial hop in particular, you will really enjoy this one."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint. Beautiful copper appearance with dense one finger head. Piney hop aroma and fantastic grapefruit hop taste. Small amount of malt in the background but the lovely Centennials shine through. Medium mouthfeel and awesome drinkability for this medium strength brew. Delicious."
"D: Shame on you if you don't already know how fantastic this brew is. Suitable for all day imbibement...so get to it!"
"Dark orange with a thick off white head that sticks, and leaves a very nice lacing. Smells strongly of hops. Grapefruit and flowers invade the nose, and I immediately surrender. The taste is truly something to behold. Hops attack then subside with a beautifully sweet aftertaste. Alcohol is not too present at all, and could sneak up on me if I had too many more. This is a high quality IPA not to be missed. Once again, Founder's has given us a great quality brew that I recommend to all"
"D - A great, absolutely tasty and very drinkable IPA! Refreshing and smooth w/ clean fermentation and great bitterness levels w/ a hard to detect 7.2% abv -highly recommended!"
"Poured this into a pint glass; hazy dark amber color and left a 1/4"" white head. Left behind some lacing. Smell is very piney and crisp. Taste is all orange and piney hops. Bit of an alcohol bite to it almost like gin. I'm actually surprised this comes in at 65 ibu, it's quite bitter. Carbonation is right for an IPA. This is a very good example of the style but I would say Stone Brewery does a very slightly better job. Great beer though. I can't wait to try this at their bar in Grand Rapids."
"Founders Centennial IPA is another good beer from Founders, and it is pretty drinkable also."
"D - A solid IPA, but not one I would seek out over many others."
"I would have preferred a more pronounced hop flavor as the initial smell was misleading. Definitely a quality IPA, but I'd look to Two Hearted or Furious before coming back to this."
"D - This definitely borders DIPA territory. At 7.2%, the alcohol is definitely noticeable, but not dominant. Nose reeks of fresh hops, which is why this reminded me of a DIPA. I enjoyed this much more than I had remembered, but it doesn't surprise me it's so tasty, because it's from Founders."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold with a big persistent head. Smells amazing- huge sweet citrusy hops. Grapefruit and peaches. Taste has a lot of sweet malt. Good citrusy hop flavor but not as pronounced as in the nose. Pleasant bitterness in the finish. Full bodied. Easy to drink. Overall a solid, and particularly great smelling, IPA."
"OVERALL: A good IPA for sure, and quite drinkable as well. Unfortunately the initial taste lacked somewhat and I didn't get the malt backbone that some other reviewers allude to. This one is like a milder version of Double Trouble, which, if you ask me, is not all that necessary. A good beer, but not one worth writing home about."
"A pretty good offering, but nothing special. Would drink it if served, but would probably try something else on the menu."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, easy drinking, a bit too boozy to be sessionable. I love founders."
"D: If I were to stumble upon Centennial IPA on draft I may find that I could drink quite a few of these. For what ever reason I crave a Two Hearted Ale after this brew every time so while the drinkability is good... only if I am out of Two Hearted... NEVER!"
"D: Very drinkable! The best IPA that I have found that I can drink regularly."
"This is a very well crafted IPA. One of my favorites in the Founders lineup and probably my favorite that they make year around."
"Overall- this is a solid ipa for any hop fan. for the abv this brew doesn't put you out to quick. on an empty stomach three will do."
"drinkability is great. very easy drinking on the palate with a generous hop profile that is very sessionable. cheers!"
"CHEERS!!"
"The mouthfeel really compliments the style with a hearty bitterness and a crisp hoppy bite that strips a nice layer of enamel off my teeth. An enjoyable beer with a light body and very drinkable. There are better ones but this is a good solid brew."
"-pretty darn drinkable. not a top IPA or anything, but definitely orderable"
"Pours clear and copper in color with a thin lacy white head. Light citrus hop aroma is spilled out by the highly moderate levels of carbonation. The light body is full of a semi-tart, citrus hop bitterness. Well balanced, sweet, and deliciously light. Fades slightly tart with the citrus hops and fades slowly, smooth, and clean."
"D - Whoa, this one went amazingly fast. Drinkability is absolutely off the charts. Can I give it a 5.5? Very good IPA overall."
"Pours a nice amber color with about a finger of off-white head with good retention. Nose is delicious and hoppy. A lot of citrus and white grapefruit, not too much pine. A lot of good flavor in the taste. A nice fruity flavor up front, some tropical fruit like pineapples as well as citrus. A nice bitterness left behind. A fair amount of malt, as well, but not overpowering. Good mouthfeel, medium in body but good carbonation. Drinkability is good, would have guessed 5% alcohol."
"good drinkability."
"Drinkability: An incredibly easy to drink beer. A nice malt backbone, but an even better hop flavor and aroma. The body and carbonation of the beer make this easy to drink."
"D: I would like to have several of these. The alcohol is well masked."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable, a really nice IPA."
"D - a solid IPA, excellent representation of the Centennial variety. nicely balanced but will still satisfy the bitter-seekers. goes great with some spicy Mexican cuisine or just to sip on a warm summer day."
"Cheers!"
"Easy to drink, maybe a little weak tasting, which is suprising considering the ABV. Worth a try, maybe not the hype."
"Overall I was expecting a lot more from this beer as I have read/heard so many good things. This is a decent IPA, but certainly nothing that stands out in the style as it is populated with so many great beers. I will revisit this in the future. Worth a look."
"Poured with a nice orange body with a good off white head that has lasted a while, great lace. The smell could be stronger. Not getting much out of it a little citrus fruits but nothing overwhelming. Tastes amazing and very easy to drink, not overly hoppy. Very balanced."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. This brew is a hazy orange color with a medium light beige head that dissipates steadily. Stringy lacing on the glass. Herbal, floral hops aroma with notes of citrus. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with floral hops and pine flavors, along with some sweet malt and candi in the background. The finish is hoppy with a lingering zesty citrus aftertaste. Well done all around."
"(D)- Overall, a solid IPA that ranks well in the drinkability department. Nothing fancy or over-the-top, just another winner from Founders!"
"Overall I have had this beer many times. I have finally come to realize that it is best served very, very fresh. This and Bells Two Hearted are beers that take on a whole different flavor when fresh....for the better. The orange citrus on this keg was amazing, truly a thing of beauty. I will no longer underestimate this beer, it is truly a work of art when drank young. Kudos to Founders."
"D: Very good, I want another one right now."
"Pale golden color with a rocky white head and a nice amount of lace hanging around. Good amount of citrus and pine aromas that are pleasant and enticing. The aroma carries through on the flavor and is definitely flavorful but could use a tad more balance. A nice dry quality on the finish leaves me satisfied and there's a lively carbonation that is very refreshing. Overall a very drinkable IPA and worth a try. There are certainly better but this is a valiant effort."
"Drinkability: A very well-crafted IPA. All aspects of the beer worked well with each other. A very easy drink."
"D Good drinkability which, for me, is not always the case in an IPA. 4.0"
"Pours a hazy orange with sticky, aromatic head. The nose is powerful but balanced between the big, fresh hops that one would expect of this style but also a strong but overly sweet maltiness. The taste is remarkable. The hop/malt balance that was on the nose persists on the palate, with a fascinating interplay of citrus and resinous hops, each of them strong but neither overwhelming, with caramelly and other malts; not a bad amount of yeastiness, neither. Finishes long with an orange zest and notes of sweet and sour. Highly drinkable both alone and with a heap of grub."
"D: A good IPA that goes down nicely and easy to drink. I'd buy this again"
"Overall I was more impressed with this beer on tap than I was the bottle version, however that may be a result of the freshness. Still, both versions are worth a shot but if you see it on-tap I recommend you be more inclined to order one."
"So I got a fresh batch in two six packs. And I have to say, this is not the same beer I had in Detroit back in July. It was bottled in the end of August, but its a clear amber colour. Not hazy or orange or unfiltered at all. What a disappointment. I was so looking forward to this again. My previous bottles had no bottled date on them, so they must have been at least 6+ months old. These are less then a month, and it tastes identical to Southern Tier IPA. Which is a decent beer, but its an average IPA. Big disappointment on this one. What did you do Founders?"
"D - balance is the key to this beers success. In every sense: smell, feel and taste."
"A vigorous pour into my favorite snifter leaves a a cloudy gold/orange color with a thick, cloud-like head. The aroma is mildly sweet and floral. There are both floral and citrus notes in the flavor, and although it is fairly well-balanced, the hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is bright and refreshing despite the big, bitter flavor. A solid IPA."
"It is a good IPA, I've had better, but then again I'm a hophead so this beer doesn't live up to those standards but is still enjoyable. Again this beer is unfiltered so make sure to pour it."
"I could drink a lot of these. Nearly as high an ABV as Ruination, but much more drinkable."
"i just can't find a founders beer i don't like. if i had to be uber-critcal i would wish this one wasn't quite so heavy. but..."
"very drinkable and delicious. Great hoppy IPA that pushes toward double, without being overly aggressive."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with good carbonation"
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a wonderful deep burnt orange color with a nice frothy 1/2 inch head that left sticky lacing all the way down the glass while being sipped. The aroma is of orange, floral hops, a sweetness similar to caramel, and some pine. The taste first hits your lips and gives you some of the floral hops, the citrus gives a little pucker, and the finish is deep bitterness. This is a tasty beverage. It is medium to light body, with a softer carbonation. Really with I had a sixer of this brew. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Its not the most complex or interesting IPA, but does nothing wrong. This is a solid beer for drinking, not for tasting and mulling over. Good stuff."
"I find myself picking these up quite frequently since Founders initiated their bottled on dates, and pry-off caps. Another winner from Founders, Cenennial is truly a kick ass East Coast style IPA. I think I'm going to go grab another one..."
"Very nice aroma and taste. This isn't really a session with 6.8%, but I could slow sip this beer all night and enjoy the hell out of them."
"Definitely one of my favorite IPA's. Pours a golden dark brown, maybe a hint of red. Nose is a mild floral/pine combo, but taste is definitely pine-heavy. Hoppy but not overly so, and is balanced out though by some nice carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Head lingers for the entire glass. Very drinkable considering its ABV. Another great beer from Founders."
"D - This beer really disappeared quickly. I find it highly drinkable and very well balanced. If anything, I think it needs a bit of a citrus hop kick to balance out the pine, but that's a minor quibble. I'd actually label this beer as fairly unique when compared to other IPA's. It is a nice change of pace from the super hop forward IPA's out there. Founders is a damn fine brewery."
"solid IPA all the way. i had this 2 days old on tap and that was pretty intense but this is more mellow so im assuming its a tad older. solid all the way though. one of my favorite IPA's"
"Drinkability-I could drink a few of these without a doubt. Nice hoppy one without being too overly sweet or bogged down."
"The finish is thin, stringent, and very dry. There is a touch of softness and minimal carbonation. The bitterness follows though to the end. Smooth finish and syrupy sweetness on the back end."
"Overall, this is a good representation of a widely represented style. Definitely above average. However, with so many great examples of the style out there, I doubt I would get this again. There are so many IPA's out there that are better (and probably cheaper) than this and I will reach for those. Still a good beer, no doubt."
" ~ This brew is sure to please anyone that's a fan of great hops flavor."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A nice big bitter Ipa from the East Coast. The fresher the better. Would definitely purchase again, but I actually find Double Trouble to be more drinkable and all around better beer despite the higher ABV."
"Appearance has almost an golden apple juice color with a big white head letting off a rich crisp bouquet full of grapefruit and pine. Little floral note. Flavor is crisp and very rich in its bitterness...no sourness at all. Just tons of grapefruit and pine. Nice balance brought on by the toasty malts, finishes pretty grassy. An exceptional IPA that doesn't burn taste buds but carries a bitterness that doesn't bore after a few pints."
"I do believe I'm going to pick up a pack of this soon. :-)"
"Overall: Not a blast of any one component, but solid overall in every category. I saw a note that it was used as a benchmark in BJCP judging for ipa's, which makes sense because its just a good example of an all-around ipa."
"D - Very drinkable, ABV not too high."
"Drink is very good easy a session beer and a definite taster."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy gold with about a finger of fine bubbled white head. Nice citrusy hop aroma with some bready malt. The hops jump right out at you, but they are backed up with a solid malt base. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Long drying finish from the hops. Pretty drinkable for such a hoppy beer. I can see this one becoming a regular in my rotation."
"D: Tasty and enjoyable. I think this one was slightly oxidized or old. I'd love to have another and buy a 6 pack of fresh stuff!"
"D-lish-us. Pours dirty brown with heavy carbonation present. Very thick, overflowing head. Aroma is right down my alley. I sunk my nose into this one was not disappointed one bit. However, I did sneeze about 10 times after fully engulfing my nostrils into the head. But the taste is outstanding. Feels great in the mouth and I wouldn't hesitate to drink this all night long, although that may not be so wise. Personally, I really love this beer."
"The color is a light brown almost copper color with some light golden highlights. I've seen the head be large and small on this and this time it was rather large about three to four fingers. Outstanding lacing on this guy, sticking to the glass till the last hoppy sip. The hop aroma hits you as soon as it begins to pour. With strong citrus and piney notes. The smell of a great IPA right there! The hops hit you with every drink of this beer. The depth is there too not overly complex but it isn't just a lot of hops, it has a good amount of malts with the pine and citrus. A great beer all around and something that I routinely find myself drinking."
"I think I have a grasp on centennial hops now! Overall, not an IPA for the folks that like Hop bombs, definitely a well balanced beer."
"D - Wow I wished I had regular access to this as I would make this a staple as it was very good."
"Notes: This will most likely be rotating with Two Hearted when I buy IPA's."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs. Great taste, great drinkability. This tastes like what an IPA should taste like. Very pleasing to the palate. Can drink more than one in a sitting. I've had it on tap too and it's one of the few beers that tastes the same on tap or in a bottle. What more can be said?"
"great mouthfeel and great drinkability. definitely sessionable on a hot summer night."
"Overall, a decent IPA and I'm glad I got to try it, but there are better, more balanced IPA's available."
"This was my first venture into Founders Beer. I hope to do a lot more. This was a good IPA. I have to say to begin, this is not my favorite IPA, but I would definitely drink it again. This beer has this apple-ish flavor. It pours dark yellow, slightly hazy but mostly clear. Thin head, doesn't quite cover the top of the beer. Aroma was strong to begin and fell away as the head fell away. This is a very drinkable IPA, bitterness builds as you drink it. Never overwhelming."
"Murky amber pour with a huge 3 finger head that camps out forever and leaves nice lacing. Smell is musty earthy hops and caramel, and the taste is not much different. Seems like its lacking freshness, but no date code = fair game. There isn't really much to say about this beer, just your average IPA, not very complex or noteworthy"
"Overall, more than pleased with this purchase. Good nose on this one. A very good example of AIPA. This is my first beer from this brewery. I will be buying more."
"You'll note my score remains quite high even despite frustration and less than perfect QC. Centennial IPA usually is a delicious, dangerously drinkable beer - but not always. I don't mean for it to sound like that much of a gamble; even the bottles that have problems turn out to be pleasant, albeit imperfect, treats. Still, this brewery makes a world-class IPA and every drinker who buys it should have the benefit of that experience."
"Drinkability: An excellent sipping, complex but balanced"
"I felt the beer was good, nothing too exciting though. The apearance was nice, nice head and lace, a little turnid amber color. Nice spicy aroma and flavor, medium to high bitterness that builds up. The beer felt good, but it felt average to me. I would certainly recommend it to IPA lovers and I can see this beer being some peoples favorite."
"A nicely balanced IPA, very solid beer."
"Color is a nice golden brown. Smell is pleasant picked up some citrus. Taste is smooth for an IPA with this much abv. Very drinkable. I will definitely be enjoying this beer again."
"Poured clear amber with a moderate head that didn't last very long. Aroma was citrus with a malty sweet background. The taste was well matched to the aroma, but a little bitter bite at the end. The feel was oily and medium bodied. Very enjoyable drink."
"D: Well, Founders is 5 for 5 on my personal approval scale, another rock star! Having just tried Double Trouble last week this really is a great complimentary brew. I think I almost love Founders' IPA's almost as much as their Stouts and Porters, amazing! Do yourself a favor and try this brew, it's a winner!"
"D = Good drinkability despite the bitterness. ABV well hidden."
"Overall, this is a pretty darn good IPA."
"J"
"Overall a superior IPA."
"Drinks easy, hides the ABV well. A decent AIPA, but kind of disappointing for a Founders product IMO, hopheads may disagree"
"D: This is a big IPA, in the sense that both hops and malt are demonstrably present. Because of it's substantial caramel malt character, it doesn't come across as a one-sided hop bomb, which I appreciate. That said, this falls somewhere between very good and great. An enjoyable beer at any rate."
"i like this brew a lot this is a great ipa very easy to drink the hops are not crazy over board like other ipa's, it's got tons of flavor and balance.great ... cheers."
"This one is definitely on the maltier side of IPAs but has plenty of hop. Higher ABV, but just as drinkable as most of the lighter IPAs out there."
"Drinkability: In terms of an IPA, this brew was actually disappointing. I was expecting more hops and less sweet. That being said, this beer is quite drinkable given its balance an non-overwhelming hops. It was good, but not quite what I was expecting for an IPA."
"Overall a good IPA, if you prefer a maltier IPA you will love this beer. If you prefer a majority of hop character you may want a different IPA."
"D: I love a killer IPA delivering death blows of hops but with this one, I found myself wanting more caramel malt sweetness. I think the bitterness got too piney for me at times. Having said that, this is a fantastic IPA and I'd drink it any day of the week. Unfortunately there are better and cheaper IPA's available to me."
"D: Powerful flavors, but still quite drinkable."
"Pours a golden orange with a great head. Smells very hoppy and citrus flavor is present. Likewise the taste has a great IPA bite, cooled down by the malts and citrus. I thought this was a great tasting IPA, very balanced for the style and affordable at $10 for a 6 pack."
"Overall, I think this a pretty solid, go-to IPA. Not in the same league as Double Trouble or Devil Dancer, but still very excellent and worth seeking out. I have yet to have one beer that I do not enjoy from Founders."
"-Oelergud"
"Founders Centennial IPA is darn near the epitome of IPA. At the end of a long day, I often crave hops, and this ale brings it without any harsh edges. Very nice."
"Overall a great ipa with plenty of all 3 hops contributions, citrusy and bitter, but balanced. Would stand out even on the west coast. Will definitely be looking for this again."
"Pours a very slightly hazy (unfiltered) orangish color with good looking head - plenty of lacing as I drink. I expect the regular IPA aroma, but this one is subdued - seems just as malty as it does hoppy. The taste is quite pleasant. Mild peppery flavor. Different than the average IPA out there - the hops are there - only the bitterness doesn't kill your tastebuds after the first sip. This makes for one very drinkable IPA!"
"Drinkability: These are best enjoyed less than or equal to three. <=3 beers. So, not so much a session beer."
"D: A definite winner, but as far as IPAs go, I would say it is pretty average. I love centennial hops and don't get me wrong, this is full of them. I just feel there are better IPAs out there and more specifically better centennial IPAs. I will buy it again, but not in a sixer."
"Drinkability: Although i'm not always an IPA kinda guy, this one of my favorite IPA's out there and would take this perfectly balanced IPA during session drinking any day."
"Cloudy, golden red color with pale white head. Head retention is very good. Very true to the IPA style. Stronger taste and stronger finish when compared to Red Hook IPA which introduced me to this style during my travels to Seattle. If you like IPA's and are fortunate enough to be able to order a pint at your favorite pub, it is certainly worth trying."
"This is a great American IPA and very balanced and drinkable"
"Cheers!!!"
"Highly drinkable, especially from this warm spot in the sun. One of the more enjoyable IPAs around."
"All in all, I feel that this is a very drinkable IPA that I will frequent when I need a good hop fix."
"D: A really good IPA that is even better on-tap."
"I expected a little more pure citrus out of the centennial hops but I call them as I taste them..very solid IPA with hop ""flavor"" and not just pure bitterness..I'm sure East Coast IPA lovers will like this one a lot."
"Mouthfeel is a tad too oily but incredibly well carbonated. Drinks incredibly well and eases as it warms with a becoming of a nice earthy flavor. Truly an exceptional beer!"
"Drinkability: I wish I had discovered this beer before - it's very good. The bitterness keeps this one a sipper, which is probably a good thing considering the ABV. It's not my favorite IPA I've ever had, but it's very, very good, and one I wouldn't mind picking up again."
"i still cant believe i was able to find this beer only bottled 3days ago - i might go back and buy another 6 because i dont see the one i picked up lasting the weekend"
"This poured a nearly clear copper with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like strong pineapple and floral hops, with some copper and orange and honey. It tasted like orange and copper and pineapple hops, with earthy caramel malt and a bit of yeast. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer had a great scent but the taste wasn't quite as fresh or clean. It still had good flavor and body, and was generally quite enjoyable. It felt like this cost more than a typical IPA, but that might just be due to market-wide price increases (due to hops shortage or taxes?). But if this is sold around the same price as any other IPA, it would be hard to not buy this one."
"D- Pretty good. This beer is a hop bomb, but if you like these sorts of things you'll like this one. The taste of a DIPA with a slightly lower alcohol content. Still, at 7%+ it packs a punch. Not my favorite, but a very solid brew."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, if you like piny hops. I don't, and I don't think most people do either."
"Many thanks to mikereaser for giving me this in a trade."
"Pours an amber shade of pumpkin with a creamy, pockmarked orange cream tinted head that slowly melts leaving sticky lace behind on the glass. The nose is big grapefruit and pineapple hops with caramel malt. The flavor is every bit as good as the nose, nice resinous citrusy hops with a good malt balance. Medium slippery mouthfeel with nice fine carbonation. This is my staple IPA lately. A fine brew."
"Had this on tap at the Founders brewery. Poured into a pint glass with a light white head. Color appeared a dark orange color. Flowery aroma with a little bit of grapefruit and honey. In the taste the hop flavors come in very clearly with grapefruit and lemon being the majority with the right amount of malty sweetness to balance things out. I love the balance of this ipa. I also tasted a mild soapiness to the beer. A clean smooth finish to the beer. A very good IPA."
"This is my very 1st expeciance with Founders and so far im very exited at the prospect of being able to get it locally"
"Pours a cloudy dark orange with a small one finger white head that leaves some lacing down the glass. Smells of hops, citrus and a bit piney and grapefruit. The smell is pretty good. Taste is really good. Grapefruit and hops, piney a bit, not to bitter at all. Drinks really easily. Really good mouthfeel and easy to drink. A really great IPA. I'll be getting this one again sometime for sure."
"Medium-bodied with good carbonation and just a hint of stickiness. Overall I must say I'm disappointed, especially after the first sniff I took. The flavor just doesn't live up to the expectations the nose set me up for."
"Mouthwatering smooth and creamy with a good kick of carbonation. I am thrilled to have this bad boy in Kansas City now can't wait to try out all of founders offerings."
"This is an all around terrific ipa, great balance, flavor and visual appeal. The aroma could have used a little more oomph. It could just be that this has a bit more shelf time on it. Theres no freshness date, so no way to tell how old it is."
"jwc215 sent this one! Truth be told, I drank this while eating a searing hot cheese crisp with serrano peppers right after getting home from a trip to Texas. BUT, this one pours a rich orange color with a 3/4"" off white head. Tons of lacing. Smells mildly of citrus, not a huge aroma. Tastes moderately of grapefruit citrus and dose of malt, with a sweet aftertaste and not a lot of the usual IPA bitterness. Middle of the road, you might say. Carbonation was just a tad light, but it resulted in a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable stuff; I finished it in 20 minutes of so."
"This is a beer that makes me feel good. I simply want more. I've been enjoying this beer more than Stone's IPA and other great beers of the same ilk, but this one is very nice, smooth and satisfying."
"finger head of thick tight foam - laces the glass thickly and completely - almost clear amber/orange color - smells fresh of pine and citrus - tastes pretty good - grapefruit citrus resiny hops with sweet malt to back it up - a clean finish and mouthfeel - i don't taste the alcohol - this drinks real easy - refreshing - good stuff."
"D= very good. Great for a hot night."
"I think this is a good IPA but must admit it was a little less than I expected based on the ""hype."" I'd have it again and would certainly recommend it, but think some of the other reputable IPAs in it's class are much better."
"I really enjoyed this one. Had some of the WC elements such as being citrusy and dry. It paired very well with a few pieces of Pt. Reyes Farmstead Blue Cheese."
"Drinkability is good, I would have no problem sucking down several of these. Founders in MN yeah!"
"D - A decent IPA...it's leans more towards the hops which I like...but the alcohol taste (7.2%) just was a little turnoff for me"
"D- I wanted to give this beer a 4 but the abv is rather high, honestly after two of these I want something else. But overall this is a great brew, I really like it. This one has the ability to compete with the best."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking IPA that is delivers in all the ways an IPA should deliver. Not at the same level as Bell's own Centennial-driven IPA (Two Hearted), but still very good."
"Drinkability is amazing."
"Served in a faceted mug."
"Edit: Its almost how I view music, well more specifically bass players (as I am one). There are shitty players, excellent players, and then those inbetween who are good. At the bottom you have bassists from bands like MXPX, Green Day, Nirvana, G'N'R, etc. At the top you have players like Victor Wooten (if you've not heard him check it), Stanely Clarke, Marcus Miller, Jaco Pastorius, Stuart Hamm...virtuosos, etc. The middle is comprised of many different levels, but all of them good for different reasons. JPJ of Zeppelin, Geddy Lee, Gary Thain (Uriah Heep), Leon Wilkenson (Skynyrd), Entwhistle (The Who). Well this beer falls in the middle category, nothing stunning or mindblowing but still good, and much better than what has become the accepted average (as far as music goes that is dropping, as far as beer goes I think that it is raising)."
"drinks down pretty smooth, carbonation is just right. the flavor matches the smell - fruity hops and bitterness are nicely balanced with the sweetness of the malt. this is not a ""hop monster", if that's what you're looking for, which i don't think you should be ;)"
"I'm glad Founders is in Virginia now!!!"
"D- Great brew that suited me well for my own personal BA milestone."
"D- I could drink this as a staple in my weekly diet. This beer goes down pretty smooth and the alcohol is there but...is nicely hidden at the same time."
"Oh, and I should mention the strength. Although it does clock in at a solid 7+ %, it never shows it at all."
"D- Pretty good IPA here. Could move quickly through a few."
"Nice copper color. Three finger head that lasts quite a while. Very sweet and hoppy smell, loving it. Great lacing, floral hop smell. Not too bitter and not too sweet, very balanced ipa. Not too boozy and very warming. Average mouthfeel. Overall a good ipa, nice to have something with some balance."
"A very mellow IPA that hits the spot. It feels just right to me and it's easy to drink. I like that."
"Even at a relatively high ABV, this one's pretty drinkable. A fantastic IPA."
"D- Insanely drinkable but just above the sessionable ABV cap. Oh well i'll drink this at home or get a taxi at the bar, centennial warrants 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, you get the picture. Is there a Founders beer that I don't like, I think not. We will see how devil dancer compares."
"D - My first from this brewer and I must say this is a spectacular offering. A solid IPA that should be on everyone's list year 'round. Awesome."
"A nicely carbonated, effervescent beer, easy to drink a bunch of these"
"D - A really awesome IPA. I would buy more Founders beer if the put there beer in reusable bottles. Come on Founders, your consumers are more then likely brewers! Help a fellow out!"
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth good sessionable ipa highly recommend nothing spectacular but a great ipa"
"D: Another solid offering from Founders. An all-around very solid IPA."
"Drinkability: This was a lot hoppier than I anticipated, but it makes sense when you see all the hop particles floating around. A go-to IPA, especially for the hopheads."
"I really want to like this one. Smells and looks so good. Definite pine aroma, and initially I get a solid malt sweetness balanced by the citrus (but the alcohol isn't as well hidden as some might suggest). But then the citrus changes, almost like instead of getting the zest, I got the really pungent white part between the zest and the flesh. And I can't shake the aftertaste that reminds me of a bad cigar. It lingers too."
"M + D: Sparkling, with a medium body. I could smell this for some time, but it ends up being too tempting and eventually it's gone. That means more is in order!"
"A solid IPA with nicely assertive citrus hops notes that mellow into a moderate bittering as the beer progresses. The higher abv is well integrated in the flavor profile and a bit deceptive - lulling you into thinking several of these in a session would be a good idea."
"M/D: Body is medium, slick and oily, carbonation is medium. Drinkability is really nice. A superb AIPA that could be enjoyed all day long. Excellent beer."
"Amber or copper in color with a rim of foam around the edges and light lacing on the surface. Hoppy nose that is extremely pleasant. Hop forward attack with nice malt tones in the flavor. A little thickness in the mouthfeel, but pretty standard on the mouth. Strong hops finish. The hops intensifies as it dries in the mouth. A little sharp towards the finish."
"I tried. I really tried to like this brew, but I just don't like it. Looks great, pours like a champ, nice color great lasting head. And that's the best part. Where's the nose? I don't get a thing here. Bitter to the end, but not much else IMO, a one trick pony. A little boozy, I can taste the alcohol, and the finish leaves a lot to be desired. I'm fighting drinking this six, but I won't buy it again there are too many others out there to taste or buy. Too bad a great brewery IMO missed the mark, or maybe they hit it. It's a tribute to Centennial, so maybe it's a me thing."
"Overall, this is a very welcomed IPA that has loads of flavor without going overboard and being one dimentional. Highly recommended."
"drinkability is solid. I'm enjoying this one, although it's definitely hop-forward, almost overwhelmingly so. A beautiful display of centennial hops, and an enjoyable brew all around. I'd definitely drink a few more if I had regular access."
"A really good IPA that is a great representation of what a Centennial IPA should be."
"Great drinkability. I could have a couple of these without even noticing I finished them."
"Overall this is a well balanced and full flavored IPA. The malt profile is almost perfect and the hops are still in the spotlight. This is a great beer that I would not mind having around for all occasions."
"The is a super-refreshing IPA that doesn't try to knock you over with a hop assault. Just some pleasant bitterness and sunny, fruity cereal grains. A great summer beer."
"D: A very nice IPA. I'm glad to see Founders available in DC/VA, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their products."
"Short review, but certainly a solid IPA. Plenty of bitter and flavorful hops and a good balancing malt base. Recommended."
"Overall: Aaaaa, I'm not sure I like this either, that rose flavor is really throwing me off. It's not my favorite IPA, of that I'm sure."
"I like this beer. Probably one of the better IPA's I've had in a while."
"D- Pounded a whole growler in one sitting."
"Pours light orange into my nonic with a creamy white head. Light hops, citrus, floral on the nose. Taste is fresh, citrus/hops, very crisp. Light on mouthfeel, floral/citrus on the palate with a smooth/clean finish. The 7.20 ABV is well-hidden I could could easily drink several more pints. Will revisit very soon."
"Strong, sweet flowers dominate the nose and play a large role in the taste as well. Also present in the taste is a bit of piney bitterness, citrus fruits, and a nice caramel malt backbone to support all of those glorious hops. The finish is very bitter, and what I want to call crisp. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, which is fine for the style; moderate carbonation. This is one tasty, tasty brew. Very drinkable, but it does make you thirsty. I kind of wish it could taste this good all the time. Not that it's ever really not good... this pint was just exceptional. Nice job, Founders."
"Thin, eggshell white head, mild retention, lacing more visually impressive. Strong haze to the zinc orange color, overall closer to red than yellow, hardly any fade around the rims. Very good penetrating power to the nose but it's more remarkable for its balance, on one side the pink grapefruit, dried flowers, green corn husk and pine, on the other scone, mocha, malt powder, whisper of apricot or red apple fruit scents. Medium-bodied, very sturdy and has broad shoulders although in no way, shape or form trying to over-impress. Has more of a sour nip than bitter bite, keeps control of the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus as well as any greenness in the hops. Cocoa and milk chocolate powder pair up with scone to biscuit flavors and golden raisin, fig to apricot fruit. The carbonation possesses pleasing activity but the bubbles are fine and don't truly scrub. Determined to last through the finish. As in the nose, balance and integration over scattershot complexity."
"First time trying a Founders beer, and opted for the Centennial IPA. Great styled bottles if that counts for anything. Pours nice, with a nice head. Has a nice aroma, very subtle. I was expecting the beer to be hoppier with a stronger bouquet because it is an IPA, but was still pleasantly surprised with the taste. Overall I enjoyed this beer. I thought it was one of the better IPA's I have had recently. Would recommend this to anyone who is an IPA fan."
"Pours a rusty amber with a nice fluffy white head on top. Smells very nicely of citrus and flowers. Very pleasant indeed. Nice soft malt backbone here with citrus and fruit overtones hanging all around. Very light on the tongue, super drinkable."
"M & D, This is a medium to full bodied IPA with a good drinkabilty. This almost reminds me a little of DFH 60 minute (draft version) because of the hops but I think this one might be better."
"Future outlook: OK, but a bit of a disappointment. I fear (without knowing) that perhaps this bottle was not fresh enough to be an adequate representation of this brew. Founders is a good enough brewery for me to give the benefit of the doubt and see if that is indeed the case."
"The Founder's is very nice as well but it is somewhat marred by an odd aftertaste. Again, it might slightly hoppier but that doesn't mean it is as good. Despite the same hops, and the beers do taste very similar, the two beers have their differences. I think I've got to say that two hearted is better."
"On-tap at Raleigh Times, 10 oz serving served a nice crisp dark orange with a decent khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is slight Earthy pine and citrus hops, but not much there. The taste is a nice blend of pine hops with a touch of citrus and an enjoyable malt backbone providing nice balance. The beer is medium bodied with a nice lingering bitterness. This is one that is certainly enjoyable on draft."
"Carmel-colored with a huge white/tan shaving-cream-foam-like head. It smells pleasantly hoppy but with a sweet contradiction. In other words, several aromas are present all at once... Hops, Milk Duds, Raisinettes, Chunky Bar. The bitter hoppyness is not as overpowering as with many IPAs and some chocolate and carmel flavors are blended in to create an awesome brew. I keep sipping to try to figure out what else I'm tasting and rings of lacing are left behind. Anyway, it has a nice almost creamy texture and lacks that crappy bitter aftertaste some IPAs have. This is great beer."
"D - Very drinkable, well-balanced IPA. The ABV is a bit high for a session beer, but I could easily drink several of these. Nice effort from Founders."
"Lively carbonation pours over a three-finger head of the soapy, off-white variety that slowly dies and aggravates as I want to try this beer NOW! A rich hop smell, mainly citric notes but also a soft, butterscotchesque swet malt smell resides in there. Weird. A tad smooth and creamy for an IPA, with citric/floral hop notes in the taste tucked in a medium-body that goes down a little slick. Some caramel and roasted malts balance the beer and give it some sweetness and lead to a pleasant and not overbearing dry backbite. A quality IPA that is worth trying and I enjoyed sipping on this beer (don't normally consider IPAs sippers)."
"Note: under the ""Notes"" section for this beer it says 46 IBUs but right on the bottle it says 65 IBUs... just sayin'..."
"Overall I can't say I was dissapointed because it was a very tasty beer, but no hop kick like I'm used to"
"D: very drinkable, alcohol isn't there in the flavor, but the taste leaves something to be desired in my opinion...wish it were sweeter"
"Very drinkable and now that we can get founders, maybe a new go to sessioner!"
"Overall-great IPA, the kind that I really enjoy drinking, very hoppy but not a smashing flavor profile either, great job."
"Pretty drinkable from hop heads but not for everyone."
"The alcohol could actually stand to come down a bit to make this a good session IPA."
"Thanks to graphicbreak for the opportunity. Pours a light copperish color topped by a really nice head that shows great lacing down the glass, good carbonation too. Smells of really juicey big citrus notes (grapefruit, pepper, and pineapple?) Fantastic. Taste is just as impressive. Many of the same descripters with a bit more of some spicey/peppery notes. Medium to light body, carbonation softens out on the palate. Would relly like to sample this gem on tap. Hop heads won't be dissapointed."
"Overall, a good IPA on a warm night. Not as complex as I would have preferred, but I'm glad I tried it."
"D: As with any real hoppy beer, I don't find this very drinkable, though it's pretty good for an IPA."
"Founders is moving up my ranks with every new brew I try by them. I have a Double Trouble and a Backwoods Bastard waiting in the ranks to seal them in my fridge drawer forever."
"Can't really bring myself to drink this too fast, good to the last drop. Glad to see it in the Pittsburgh market."
"Note added 13 Jan, 2010: This is easily on my short list of favorite IPAs. This one just works for my tastes."
"Smell is hoppy. Taste is a juicy hoppyness with some grassy hops showing up in the background. This has a really good taste working for it. It's fairly smooth on the palate and refreshing. For a IPA it's not cloying or tiring after a few. This would make a good sessionable IPA. May have to keep some of these on hand."
"4.0 D: Very good. Hopefully one day I can get another bottle and a head will form."
"You could probably drink this all day; I know I could. As you finish one it begs for a repeat and you know you will have to follow it by an IPA or APA with similar notes because perfection demands perfection. You are forced to either have another Centennial or upgrade (which will inevitably be extremely difficult) - best to grab another Centennial. Cheers!"
"Poured a beautiful amber/copper with a gigantic head that laced and retained. One solid looking beer. Nice citrus and earthy scent. Grapefruit was the first thing I noticed. Nice and hoppy taste with great mix of citrus. Smooth mouthfeel with great coating and yes, I could drink this all day...very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and should I be able to get my hands on it at the store or be offered it, I certainly wouldn't turn it down."
"Just not digging this one."
"The mouthfeel is fluffy up front and prickly carbonation as it sits."
"another great beer from founders... this pours a golden/orange hue with outstanding lacing thru out... malt hop balance is outstanding.. pine citrus and spice aroma with a just right dry bitter finish a perfect ipa i could drink a sixer in an evening but dont 7.2 abv. founders brewery is fast becoming a favorite of mine.... if u like ipa's find this one"
"D-Very easy drinking beer,even with the higher abv its easy to keep drinking more."
"On-cask at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. I'm not usually a fan of hoppy beers on cask, but this must be the exception that makes the rule. This was a smooth, relatively balanced IPA. There was a big hit of citrus punch, not too sharp, and very drinkable. There's also a tasty, mellow caramel and bread malt profile in the background. Man, this stuff is tasty."
"Founders you never cease to amaze me with sheer quality of your beers."
"D: Centennial hops had great flavor without being overbearing, although this is a nicely balanced brew regardless. Slightly deadly ABV for a regular IPA, but it's so good, who cares."
"Super drinkable. Very mellow in body and goes down smooth. ""Drink it in. It always goes down smooth."" And I could."
"Pours deep gold to light amber with a bit too much carbonation, but settles down fairly quickly leaving a rocky off-white head that leaves plenty of lacework down the sides of the glass. Very complex hop aroma. There's fresh citrus, honey and marmalade. This beer has a bit of toasted malt up front that mixes well with the hops before a smooth malty middle followed by an assertive hop bitterness in the finish. The bitterness sticks around and builds a bit with each sip. Seems much rounder than a bottle I had a few months ago. Overall, an engaging IPA I'll probably return if I don't get around to an attempt a brewing a clone."
"Nice beer, smells great, tastes great. Another solid beer from Founders Brewing."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. pours a golden amber color with a finger of frothy off white. Some retention on the glass. Smell is all citrusy hops. Taste is an excellent balance of hops and malts. Citrus up front with a clean biscuitlike finish. Dry mouthfeel that invites me back for another drink quickly. I could drink this beer all day. An excellent example of an IPA from Founders."
"Just poured this IPA 5 minutes ago in the appropriate Founders pint glass. Head is light and slightly amber. Didn't stick around long, maybe because of mismanaged pour. Appearance is clear, makes me wonder what the sediment version might look like. Aroma is not super sticky, not over the top hoppy but very, very pleasant. It's not pungent which I would prefer. First few sips in and it's just as pleasant as I had imagined. Very, very clean with just a little and I mean little bit of the stickiness I find in a lot of other big IPAs. The malt is present but a little downplayed. The beer is full bodied but lean at the same time. I use well-balanced a lot but here again is a well-balanced beer. Not much on the fruity side either. A really straight forward IPA. It presents it's musclely (I made that word up) hops on a platter of tightly constructed malt and says, ""here you go, the game's on, you can drink a couple more and be happy."" And I just might."
"Update: I recently read that Founder's bottles now show a date on the bottle...Hallelujah! Only buy this beer when absolutely fresh, otherwise you'll be disappointed."
"Rich, intense IPA, but with a balance that makes it deceptively drinkable."
"Good drinkability. Not too heavy, not a ton of alcohol, but a little hoppy to drink extensively."
"Good beer. Give it a try. My one concern is that it's very like other IPAs and after a couple dozen of these grapefruit-notes hoppy IPAs, they might all start to blur together in memory."
"The taste is quite full bodied, a tad sharp and acerbic, lots of sweet malts, liqueur like sweetness, a nice biscuity malt and graininess underneath, a nice biting grapefruity tart hop flavor. The flavor comes in two segments. There is a definite grainy and bready malt consistency and this segues into more acerbic hop bite. the malts do penetrate into the finish a bit, but the hop bite and the ABV are really in the finish of the beer. There is also a slightly drying floral quality in the finish as well. The ABV comes through in the end, and it turns a bit boozy, but not overly so. The aftertaste is quite pronounced, with perhaps a bit too much of the ABV."
"D: Overall really like it. It reminds me of Celebration which is my favorite beer in the fridge right now."
"The drink is medium-bodied with a sizzle of near-perfect carbonation and great mouthfeel, and brings just a bit of warming to the drinker's belly. A really fine drink, and another winner from Founders!"
"Pours a cloudy light red or brown. The nose is shy and seems a little light on the hop side. Bready malt notes are much more apparent. Hints of dark fruits. The taste seems similarly underhopped. I'm getting the earthy hop notes but not the floral or citrus notes I prefer. More sour than bitter. Feels wetter, crisper, and lighter than the usual IPA. A nice IPA but not bold or exciting, and at 7.2% ABV I prefer a little more action."
"D: Really good stuff. Drank a bunch of this and Two Hearted on vacation. Some nights they were running neck and neck. Great beer."
"D: For hopheads, the drinkability of this one is quite high. However, there are a quite a few examples that go down a bit easier than this one."
"Mouthfeel is a little weaker than other IPAs I've had recently. Slick and watery feel to this. Some hoppy bitterness, but not as much as expected. Good amount of citrus flavor, with just enough maltiness to balance this pretty well. Good drinkability due to the balance. Recommend."
"D- Easy to drink, would be a good beer to session."
"This is one hell of an IPA, an assertive, brash, smack you in the face IPA. Very tasty, very easy to drink. Founders hasn't been in NC for long, but it is a most welcome addition to the scene."
"Loads of hops and lemon with enough malt richness to add flavor and balance. Sour on the tongue then mellows into a malty middle -- still not too sweet --that closes with hops tartness. Very smooth and flavorful."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"I picked up a six pack and haven't seen it since, I don't think they can keep it on the shelf."
"I'm a fan of most beers from Founders."
"A very nice example of what a good American IPA should be. Hops everywhere, yet still very drinkable. I'll have to get this in a sixer next time. In terms of my latest mix-a-six, that makes it four down and two to go."
"This beer pours a cloudy reddish amber with a 1 fingered head and nice lacing. The smell is nice and rich of sweet sugary citrus hops as well as malt. The taste is very well constructed... sooo close to a 5 but I will go with a 4.5. A wonderful malt base to this IPA, which I am more and more learning to yearn for with my IPA's and of course this beer has a nice citrus hop finish to it, there is also some hints of caramel in this beer. The mouthfeel has a slight dry aftertaste and the carbonation is a little low, BUT it is very nice and creamy. A higly drinkable brew I will look for it next time I am up in Michigan."
"Drinkability: I am not an IPA guy, but this is a way above average IPA..It is very complex in taste and if I were in an IPA mood, this is what I would go for...certainly one of the best in the style that I have tried"
"Strangely I've never reviewed this beer before, but I've had it plenty of times over the last 4 years. I'm now drinking poured from a 12 oz bottle: The beer is copper colored and just a little hazy, with a thick white froth that leaves dry lace on the glass. The smell is hoppy in a citrus way, maybe a little spice too. The taste is grapefruity and very peppery, lots of spice bite. As usual Founders is very solid."
"Pours a clear brassy/coppery color, foamy beige head fades slowly into a sudsy layer, nice lacing on the glass. Bright grassy/citrus hop aromas. Very hoppy tasting IPA, bitter grapefruit, and a nice bready/grainy finish to balance things out. Medium-bodied, lots of lingering hop flavors, and ridiculously drinkable. This is a great IPA."
"As always with D/IPAs, left out to warm about 15 minutes before opening. Bronze color in glass with decent initial head which fades after a couple of tilts. Bitterness up front with pine and citrus aspects following. Slightly thin mouth feel. A little astringency / sourness after a few sips but it takes nothing away from its drinkability. Could have a few in a sitting. Have had better from Founders."
"Pours a copper orange color with a big two finger head that slowly recedes into a lasting cap, leaving some very generous lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles coming up from this one. Sediment was left in the bottle, but some little specs made their way through. I could smell the bitter citrus fruit hoppiness as I was pouring it into the glass. Very nice grapefruit and orange aroma. Taste is not outrageously bitter, but a good smack of bitter orange peel and grapefruit rind coats the tongue and sticks around well after the swallow. Very good hop flavor and not too much caramel malt to get in the way. Decently balanced. Medium bodied, lots of carbonation. goes down very smooth. This was a good IPA and something I would certainly drink again, but not in my top 5."
"Pours a pale orange with frothy white head that leaves behind a little lacing. This brew has a great aroma of tropical fruit, wet grass, a faint note of biscuit, with some pine coming through as well. Highly drinkable beer for a higher than average ABV and the taste balances the alcohol very well. Pine flavor, oily hop character, citrus, rind, mango, and a touch of mint aftertaste shines through. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Refreshing, this a great ale for any season. Definitely worth trying over and over again."
"Toffee covered wood, wood soaked in whiskey, whiskey aged on oak. Citrus and sharp, summer fruits zest atop the sticky, chewy malt foundation. Aromas of pine and peel. Outstanding balance with the hops jumping in front; just what an IPA should be. Clingy oil that turns to juice, with a particle lace. Their absolutely right, never finishes bitter; at least no bitter than hop heads care for. One of the best IPAs I have had in some time."
"Taste: Very bitter with more pine and grapefruit peel. Has a nice sweet malty backbone."
"This is a solid, tasty IPA."
"D - Very tasty, but leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste that might turn some off."
"This six-pack was worth the 11 bucks -- just wish it lasted longer."
"-Gordon Quid"
"Drinkability: I've yet to be disappointed by Founders, and though this one isn't as out of this world amazing as some of their brews, it's a definite winner: a solid, drinkable, not-entirely-unreasonably-abv%-leveled beer, and a must for anyone who's interested in being able to detect distinctive Centennial notes in future brews (I love single-hop IPAs). A must-have if you like bitter IPAs or Centennial hops."
"D - A highly drinkable IPA, even with a slighly above style ABV. Flavor profile is similar to Bell's Two Hearted for me, but I find this one more drinkable, mainly because of that pleasing mouthfeel."
"I want to try this on tap."
"overall, it's not bad nor great. doesn't deliver on giving a big hop flavor, but for its mellow taste, it is mildly satisfying. not much to this one, but not offensive."
"Pours a hazy straw orange with a monster fluffy white head. Amazing lacing throughout. Smells like raw wet hops just picked off the vine. They dry-hopped this till it screamed! Super citrusy flavors. Everything from grapefruit to pineapple, tastes like hop infused grapefruit juice. Real nice malt profile not only balances the citrus hops but enhances them as well. Bitterness seems lower than 46 IBUs and is very smooth and refreshing. No harsh hop bite at all. Good medium body with perfect carbonation. Overall, a super delicious IPA from Founders. I was a little skeptical at first smell. Thought it would be slightly harsh but boy was I wrong. Every sip gets better and better. Will definately purchase this again. Cheers!!"
" thanks to tadowdaddy for this"
"good taste, good hoppy flavor, citrus shines through as well. nice tasting beer. the hoppiness makes a crisp mouthfeel that spreads throughout the mouth and provides a very nice balance."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Its flavor is very consistent and extremely easy to like. Also, this beer goes down very easy."
"The drinkability of this beer is the high point. If you like hops, it's one you could just quaff all night. However, it's probably the most underwhelming offering I've had from Founders. Each of these scores is on the strong side of 3.5, but on the too weak side of 4. It's above average, but not world class by any means. Easily drinkable and a great one to get at a bar and enjoy a night with. However, as far as intangibles and complexity, this beer is fairly tame."
"Overall - Very refreshing brew. This would be a good one with barbeque. There is a slight metallic aftertaste in the finish but its not overly offensive."
"I'm lucky that I just found out that BuyRite in South Plainfield carries this as I will be coming back to it with an open mouth and eager palette."
"12oz bottle into pint,mug,and snifter.Liked the mug best of the three.Slightly hazy orange/amber pour with 1-2 fingers of fluffy white head,plenty of lacing all the way down.Aroma is hoppy grapefruit,pine,and spice at first,as it warms you get more of the caramel malt. Flavor is very balanced,citrus,pine resin,and this chewy sticky caramel/honey thing going on in flavor and mouthfeel.The soft carbonation and a medium body make this go down way too easy . I waited to try this only because I can get it anytime,I'm going to keep some of this on hand from now on. Very Good !"
"This one hides its 7 % ABV very well. One could easily session a six pack. I have been impressed with every product I have tried from this brewery."
"Drinkability: For an IPA this hoppy, it's very highly drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a medium white head. Lots of lacing. An awesome hop aroma; tons of grapefruit, some caramel, and just a ton of freshness. The taste is also very nice; a large hop presence, initially sweet citrus flavor that end up more piny and bitter. Some rich caramel malts too. The alcohol shows very little, and the mouthfeel is a medium fullness with a creamy character. Very nice. A top IPA for sure."
"Its real IPAs like this that gives the style such an esoteric or cult like following."
"D- This is one highly drinkable beer due to the lack of the hint of alcohol. Probably could drink this as a session beer. A real Michigan treat!"
"Pours a very cloudy dirty dark orange. Minimal head with a few bubbles of lacing. Nose- hop perfume from the fragrant centennials and cadied caramel sweetness. Taste- caramel and cookie malth, woody hops with a some citrus. Finishes with a bitter zip of hops. Carbonation is medium and so is the body. Has some soapy, aspirin like aftertaste."
"A sweet yet tart hop zing is the first thing noticed in the taste. Very much citrus-like with a bunch of earthy notes. The malts follow it up with a caramel sweetness smoothing out some of the zesty bitterness with creamy qualities. Here's an IPA that ends with a dryness that is something almost wet and tart. All in all PERFECTION!"
"my only two gripes, the high abv makes it a hard session beer and it was a twist off... im a big believer in the anti oxidizing powers of the pop off(it also feels better on the lips) but im sure founders will change eventually they do everything else so damn well"
"D - goes down easy for a brew that's over 7% abv."
"Drinkability is high. It's a solid IPA, easy to drink, nice flavors, and quite enjoyable."
"Kudos to Founders"
"Session brew for me. A fantastic example of an American IPA. Will satisfy hop heads as well. I would drink this often if available to me."
"I will buy this again in a few months."
"I would have this almost every night if I could get it in Iowa. Felt good after one since it has a nice 7.2 ABV."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with about a finger an a half of persistent bone white head. Some hop matter is visible. Aroma is piney, resiny, and slightly grapefruity hops with a considerable, though still secondary, caramel malt character. Taste is initially very hoppy then briefly malty before becoming intensely hoppy (pine) and solidly bitter. The finish is long and bitter and at times I'm able to detect a bit of alcohol in this brew. Mouthfeel is pretty good with medium body and carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I enjoyed this brew but I'm not really longing for another."
"best for a warm summer or spring day on the porch"
"D - Good beer. One of the best IPA's I've had."
"Wow this is a fantastic IPA. Fresh and juicy, vibrant and colorful, eminently quaffable. WOW!"
"Drinkability: I can see enjoying a couple of these, in fact I did. The 7.2 ABV is very well balance and does not over-power the beer."
"A perfect IPA in my book. Everything you would expect and more. Drinkability is almost endless. I could drink this everyday. Just enough hops to get your attention but still very well balanced with the malty sweetness. I've never had a bad beer from Founders, but this is definately the best. Recently found it on tap at Miles Road Winking Lizard. WOW!"
"Pours a hazy amberish orange with a finger and a half of creamy yellow tinged head that leaves small amounts of misplaced lacing as it quickly drops to a paper thin covering. The nose is full of high quality ganja buds, citrus and pineapple and fresh cut pine stand out. The hoppy flavors are direct,but not forceful or overwhelming. A malty under current offsets the bold hops and offers a balanced brew that I think hop haters could even appreciate. A medium bitterness keeps this IPA cruising just the way I like,creamy and light,the finish is unique and one of a kind."
"A very nice American IPA."
"Floral, hop bursting, carmelly goodness. The unfiltered aspect is troubling as I don't tend to prefer beer that has garbage swirling around in it. I can excuse it because this beer is just so good. The smell is loud, hoppy and floral. The mouthfeel is a bit citrusy and dirty but not bad. Drinkability is average; you can't taste the alcohol but the thickness keeps this from being a chug beer."
"This brew is also unfiltered, so expect some debris in your glass. An outstanding American IPA!"
"This was the first beer I had by the Founder's Brewery. I was blown away by this. The reddish amber color with about a two finger head looked so good I thought I could taste it already. The smell was very floral, almost like pot. The taste was exceptional. Very well balanced, not overly hoppy. The moutfeel was great too. Not too acidic nor bubbly. I would definitley drink a bunch of these at parties, bars, or w/e else you could find good brews. One of my new favorites."
"D: I enjoyed the great balance struck between the malts and hops. Given the moderate ABV and great flavors this is a nice beer to take long into the night."
"D-I'm a fan. Could drink quite a few. Not quite a top flight IPA but one I would seek out again."
"Pours Amber-golden with slight sediment suspended in the brew. The descent sized white head fades fast to a lacing. Aroma is citrus, hops, and a slight sweet pine character. Flavor is not as bitter as the aroma leads you to believe thanks to the dry hopping. Sweet malt balanced with hops makes the finish a lot cleaner than some IPAs out there. This is up there with one of my favorite IPAs. Well done"
"D - Solid IPA. Worth getting again."
"D- As a beer of higher ABV than a true ""session beer", this one is still quite drinkable. However, after 2 or 3 of these babies, you better be close to the bed."
"D: Pretty solid. Goes down easy"
"Not as great as I was expecting, yet still good. I am wondering if my bottle was a little past prime. Definitely will have again in the future."
"D: Light and sweet enough to be enjoyed as a summer time ipa, yet bitter enough to appease the hopheads. Six pack worthy and a sweet and bitter ipa that is sure to please."
"Overall a very good IPA, and like I said before, it kind of makes its own way and doesn't seem to play by the rules. I like it immensely."
"I see a dark amber copper color with a decent off-white head and meager lacing. It brings on a mild malty sweet nut aroma with a slight herbal hops. A mouthful of this brew brings out a good midland feel and decent carbonation. The flavor captures an apple malt foundation with a light pine hops presence. Very decent IPA with some appreciable nuances and excellent drinkability. Recommended."
"Could drink a case of this and not get bored..."
"Acquired in a trade with dschuster03. Thanks homie! Decanted from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a golden color with a huge white head, which fizzles away into a thin layer of foam. The aroma is muted, with suggestions of piny hops and a bigger malt backbone. Taste starts with piny pops and then a big caramel, malt background. This beer is medium bodied and would be highly drinkable if I liked it more. Unfortunately, I find this beer to be slightly boring. I prefer my IPAs with more hops and less malt. Still, not bad."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose. Flavor is sweet malt but this is an IPA and the hops kick in for a bitter finish. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Wonderful orange hazy pour with little to no head and little lacing. Very nice floral hop smell. grassy hop with citrus hints. Flavorful floral hop start with little malt back bone. Kind of sweet going down with a nice mild dry finish. Very tasty. I think I could drink a few of these."
"The beer is poured with a nice inch and a half head with very good retention and lacing; the copper colour and carbonation make the beer look good. Hops overpower the beer in the nose, which is to be expected, and it has a nice fruitiness behind it as well. The taste of the beer is quite surprising; it has a citrus bitterness with a nice sweet malt to it, incredibly tasty. The beer is too carbonated, but other than that the mouthfeel is fine. Incredibly drinkable, I'm surprised it's 7.2%!"
"Excellent bitterness and a light body make this beer very enjoyable and drinkable. 7.2% ABV is on the hefty side for an IPA, yet the alcohol flavor is very well hidden. Overall, this beer is quite solid."
"Now this is one drinkable IPA. Very similar in flavor to Two-Hearted Ale, but it's actually much smoother. I'm gonna have to start getting this stuff more often."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, hops, definatly centennial hops. In the taste, piney centennial hops and a sticky sweetness in the end. A smooth, medium mouthfeel, and a piney hop aftertaste. Nice hops, although kind of light in the bitterness, a nice IPA."
"This is a nicely done IPA that I could drink all summer long. You definetely have to try this one."
"A crisp and refreshing IPA. I wish this one was available in NH as I would love to make this a regular purchase. Very enjoyable."
"D= This was an incredible IPA. The flavors, the balance, and the carbonation were all dead on. I will absolutely be buying more of this!!!"
"D- This is a very good and extremely drinkable IPA. Recommended."
"HV"
"Pours a very cloudy dirty dark orange. Minimal head with a few bubbles of lacing. Nose- hop perfume from the fragrant centennials and cadied caramel sweetness. Taste- caramel and cookie malth, woody hops with a some citrus. finishes with a bitter zip of the C hop. Carbonation is medium and so is the body. Has some soapy, aspirin like aftertaste. Nice IPA."
"Fresh, tasty, and quaffable, this is an all around solid American IPA from Founders. A bit more fresh hop feel in the taste would have gotten into another level for me but as it is, there's a lot worse choices out there."
"mouthfeel is crisp and bitter, easy to drink, great flavor, an excellent ipa - one of my favorites."
"Its a great beer, drink lots of it."
"Id like to say this may be a bad bottle, maybe old, dunno. THe most I taste of this brew, the more that finish tastes like sediment, even though there is no sediment in the bottle. As a HB, I know the taste of unfiltered, its not it."
""
"Smells and tastes of mild grapefruit lingering on the palate nicely. Bitterness is there but doesn't seem to overpower the taste, a nice balance of slight sweetness and bitterness that lingers on. Great malt profile."
"Strong hop flavors and bitterness. Well done IPA but the high ABV limits drinkability."
"D: This is a very good and extremely drinkable IPA that is heavy on the light fruit hops, making it a great summer brew."
"Holy crap, this is an excellent IPA. There aren't many others that perform better...you can't go wrong here. Founders comes up with another mighty ale."
"D-A great overall beer that is easy to drink and would be hard to pass up another couple. fantastic year round selection. its something youll find in my (beer) fridge all year."
"I was hoping for a little more all around hop punch in aroma and bitterness. Maybe a fresher one would deliver better. I will definetly try again, but this first one was a pretty average IPA."
"Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Creamy but too thick in my opinion for an IPA. OK drinkability, higher if you're a Centennial fan, but too harsh for me."
"A very well done IPA. Welcome to NJ, Founders!"
"I have a ""rule"" if you will about IPA's--for as much of a bite one might have it should have some forgivenss as well. This pours a wonderful rich amber with a decent 2-fingerish head. The citrus aroma is immediate. It hits the mouth with a crisp bite and ends clean, slightly malty. It doesn't leave a lingering after taste like some I've tried before. For those who love the very aggressive hoppy beers this might not be the ""one"" for them. For someone like me who wants something with a nice hoppy nip this is a great choice. Its balance makes it drinkable. Its ABV makes it the type where after the first I'm slightly happier than I was before and after the 2nd me feet tingle a bit."
"This is a nice IPA - love hop character. Alcohol well covered for abv. A very nice example of an American IPA."
"D - An extremely nice, interesting American IPA."
"D: All facets of this beer work really well together. I couldn't locate any areas that were truly lacking or let me down. All around a great, sweet, yet hoppy and tasty brew that leaves me craving another and wishing I picked up a second six pack."
"D: I think I was being tougher on this beer than I normally am with others, I guess I just expect more out of Founders than other beers I rate. This beer is still good but there are so many fantastic IPAs out there and this one falls into the above average category, I enjoy Goose Islands take on the IPA a bit more than this one."
"D- Nice IPA here. Good stuff from Founders. Wasn't completely blown over though."
"This is just a really good no frills IPA. A hophead can't miss on this one."
"An all around excellent American IPA. There are some that I like a little better, but Founder's Centennial is a great beer. I am glad this beer will now be available in NJ, I will definitely be buying more of it."
"I must say, this went down really easy. I'm pretty disappointed that it's my last one. This one really hit the spot."
"Drinkability is good. I could drink a few of these before I would regret the 7.2% which is pretty well hidden in this beer."
"M/D- Thin/medium body, low carbonation, very refreshing and dangerously drinkable! Definition of a session beer!"
"drinkability: So refreshing and so incredibly complex and flavorful. I am so glad these guys came to Jersey! I can see what all the Founders hype is about, they definately have their shit together."
"M/D - Low carbonation and extremely ""refreshing."" The flavors explode in your mouth. I would recommend this to anyone."
"I dont think I could drink more them one but perhaps paired with the correct food this would be a nice compliment"
"Poured a very clear copper/amber with a little head. Not a ton of aroma, I hoped for more. Semi fruity citrus hops. Taste is similar with the citrus hops, sweet malts. I could use a little more body on it but overall mouthfeel was good with a nice carbonation level and this beer went down very smooth and easily. I would buy this often if I could."
"Recommended..."
"drinkabiliy is nice. nice crispness but it still manages to remain creamy"
"First, a resounding welcome to Founders from the Garden State. Second, it's hops first, hops last, and malt as a secondary consideration. Thankfully, the hops are quality and tastefully incorporated with an apt variety at the helm. The crisp nature makes it a satisfying endeavor with a drinkable aura. The advance billing is no exaggeration- Founders helps put the craft in craft-brewing."
"drinkability- this could definitely be a session beer. overall a great beer but not so in your face that you can only drink one or two."
"D - Very nice beer, couldn't finish more than a few in a session, but I will be back for this one..."
"Final Thought: Excellent IPA from an excellent brewery, you won't be disappointed!"
"Notes: I had this one after a bomber of Port Brewing's Wipeout IPA. That may have clouded my judgment a bit as that was a much bigger (and more bitter) beer. I'm looking forward to having another bottle of this without anything prior to see if my impression is different."
"D: Very good, not quite the caliber of Founders Harvest in my opinion but still a good hoppy brew. I had thought centennial hops were more piney but Im not complaining."
"Very drinkable IPA, better than most, and won't kill your taste buds."
"Drinkability: superb drinkability with this IPA. Not really a session IPA because of the boldness in flavors, but one can enjoy a few of these."
"Nice."
"M/D - Full bodied. Excellent carbonation and just an easy drinking IPA."
"Drinkability is good."
"Thanks to scoobydank for the Sinister brew!"
"Tasted on 4/5/08."
"thanks to Tilley4 for the hookup. Pours a coppery-yellow with a two-finger head that slowly fades into a delicate haze of bubbles on the surface and a sticky ring of lacing where the head once was. Aroma is fairly mild, with a strong lemony citrus presence. Taste is similar, with the citrus balanced by a malt sweetness. Higher carbonation gives the impression of a lighter body and crisp finish. Very drinkable, more sessionable than other beers in its class. A solid American IPA."
"Surprisingly quaffable @ 7.2% ABV. Cheers."
"This is a great beer I picked up from a local liquor store. This is a bronzish pouring beer that has a nice head to it (head doesn't last long). The smell is relatively mild which lends to the surprise of the taste. This has the bold bite of an IPA though not quite as in your face as say Sweetwaters IPA. I hope that this is a beer that my local liquor store continues to carry!"
"Very easy to drink! Alcohol is well hidden, very good!"
"Pretty damn drinkable for 7.2% ABV. A very solid example of the american IPA, and a must try for fans of centennial hops. Surprisingly bitter for only 46 IBUs, so perhaps not the most approachable example of the style. Glad i got to try this one, and will definitely be looking for it again."
"T: Creamy medium body with nice carbonation. Bready malt backbone with a bitter, but not biting floral hop taste. Alcohol is well hidden and this is super drinkable. Not quite Racer 5 or Two Hearted for me, but a great IPA."
"12 oz bottle poured into DFH pint glass . Founders label is with 2 angels holding "" TEN "" in Centennial . When poured nice off white head emerges . The pour was aggressive but head did not last long but there is some lacing . For aromas I like the overpowering smell of hops . This brew did not have that . It had some but not much . Nice golden / leathery color . Taste is crisp with pleasant carbonation . With it being very crisp the mouthfeel is a bit slim/ thin . I enjoyed this but the non citrus aromas were a bit disappointing . If it was a bit more bitter then you would have a winner"
"Try it, to believe it."
"The crisp, dry nature of this one makes it very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and semi-dry while still maintaining a respectable malt backbone. Excellent balance; any more malt and this would be too sweet for me."
"Drinkability: A respectable IPA. It's plenty bitter, so it's got that going for it."
" A solid IPA but a bit harsh to quaff. Centennials need an accompanying hop, but this is fairly well done as an example of a single hop Cent. IPA."
"Really, really good IPA. Also my first Founders brew, which has left an excellent impression & an unfulfilled yearning for more. Oh, why did I only buy a single? Why, gods, why!"
"D - I like this one."
"D- Very drinkable IPA. Reminds me a lot of Leatherlips IPA. A nice change of pace from west coast ipas."
"d- awesome"
"Thanks to pimpp for this one."
"Slightly hazy reddish amber color with a creamy offwhite head atop. Smell is light, fruity hops mostly with a citusy focus. Taste is somewhat bright, and fruity with a good hop character. Some citrus flavors and an appropriate malt backing. Good mouthfeel and carbonation level round this one out into a really classic and well done IPA. Very fresh tasting and quite drinkable."
"D - This is a very drinkable IPA and would definitely recommend."
"I drink this nearly as much as Two-Hearted."
"12 oz. stubby with no visible freshness date; unfiltered, with 46 IBUs. According to Founders website, the BJCP has chosen this brew as a benchmark for the American IPA style. It pours a toasted orange/amber color, with low carbonation and two fingers of off-white head that sticks quite well. Caramel and citrus in the nose (most notably orange and grapefruit), with spicy hops and maybe a touch of nuttiness. Very similar on the palate - hefty citrus backed by lots of malts - with a large, but manageable bitterness, and just a touch too much malt sweetness for my liking. Very dry, medium body imparts lots of coating hop oils that last and last. Definitely an IPA worth checking out."
"Overall, I enjoyed the brew but maybe not quite as much as I thought I might. Still, worthy of a good score."
"Finally, my first beer from Founders. Beer pours out a caramel/amber color. A decent head, although it disappeared rather quick, good lacing though. Smell was earthy with a hint of citrus and maybe a touch of alcohol. Taste was outstanding, the hops come through nicely. The beer was also pretty smooth with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is also excellent, I wish I had another one. I'm looking forward to trying more beers from this brewer."
"D: Tasty, drinkable(7.2%? Really?), and different from the others. Founders might be my favor brewery."
"D:Surprisingly drinkable for an American IPA with 7.2 abv. Will enjoy again!"
"Overall Impression: Nice IPA. The tea element got a little old, but I liked the hop level and the lower carbonation helped drinkability."
"Picked up a single of this to see how it compared to Two Hearted. There must be something about centennial hops that just doesn't sit well with me. I like citrusy hops and lots of bitterness, but beers that are dominated by centennial just don't make the next level with me. It's still a pretty good IPA and I wouldn't turn one down."
"It pours copper in color with a off white head that disappears after a few sips. The smell was a mix of pine, lemons, and possibly even oranges. You can taste these flavors with hints of caramel in between. Fruity but not too fruity and the caramel adds nice balance to the flavors. Very easy to drink. A wonderful American IPA."
"D: Tasty and gives a nice buzz with the 7.2% A good IPA"
"I am consistently impressed with Founders and this time is no different. A gorgeous looking pour - crisp, golden amber with minimal head that leaves a little lacing. This well hopped brew has a heavy pine nose with subtle hints dark sugar. The taste is balanced - a nice hoppy punch in the front with a sweet malty backbone. The mouthfeel is rich and almost syrupy, very nice for this style. Easy drinking here - not as good as Two Hearted, but right up there. Another great one from Founders. Highly Recommended."
"Nice IPA.. Big thanks to jdoncbus .. This is only the 2nd time I've had this beer and this one tasted a whole hell of alot fresher... OOOPS.. HOP BURP. Thanks John."
"D- every founder's beer i've had has been a knockout, next up will be red's rye."
"This is a very good IPA. Founders has not let me down yet. I know there is a lot of hype from these guys, but it is because of classic beers like this."
"D:Really good IPA. Very well balanced with the roastyness and piney hops."
"Quintessential IPA. Well done Founders!"
"The appearance of this beer is outstanding. A deep, hazy caramel color that reminded me much of apple cider. A nice ivory head that lingered with moderate carbonation. Made for a great mouthfeel. Smell and taste were dominant of citrus and spice, predominantly orange, tangerine, and coriander. A very drinkable beer that would be great with a mild fish dish, or even while watching the game. Highly recommended IPA."
"Tasty, enjoyable, overall quite solid."
"I think this is a pretty strong and mostly well balanced IPA for its style. Full flavor and medium body certainly lend to nice drinkability, while the higher 7.2%ABV remains relatively hidden."
"Drinkability: I'm on the fence with this one. In one hand, I didn't care for the beer that much, but in the other, I wouldn't refuse another one if I had the chance. I guess if I was ever lacking fruits in my diet, I could just drink another one of these and my daily fruit content would be back on track."
"mouthfeel was nice and smooth, perfectly carbonated. I could easily sit and drink a few of these, it would be a nice beer to drink all night, it just falls a little short on the hop flavors and bittering qualities."
"Drinkability: Heck yeah.... This is a s good IPA! Haven't found a loser from Founder's yet."
"This is something I'll be sure to grab again. The dense hops are well incorporated, front and center but smooth, with a sterling mouthfeel keeping the flavors in harmony. Very good brew."
"D: This is an excellent and very sessionable AIPA. I've been revisiting this beer on and off for quite a few years and it never ceases to disappoint."
"Poured from the bottle with a thick and creamy one inch plus head. Beer is of a rusty orange color. Smells of floral and citrus. Not very strong on hops. Has a nice citrus touch to it with a nice balance of bread and carmel maybe. A medium bodied beer. Lightly carbonated. Warms your insides nicely and settles real easy. A very pleasant and relaxing beer."
"It poured a dark copper. The Centennial smelled of hops, with citrus accents. It tasted of citrus and hops upfront, bitter aftertaste of lemon peel. The mouth-feel was very light as it went down. This was my introduction to Founders and was very impressed. I will definitely seek out more of these in the future."
"Edit: The original review was done as a stand alone to give every consideration to the beer but I would like to add that when drinking this beer with a curry dish that also had massive amounts of red pepper it cut through just fine and complimeted the meal very well."
"A batch from 2007 tested, wonderful. Look at the head on that beer! On draught right at the source it is amazing like most of the Founders beers. A great IPA, a solid IPA, without trying to over-achieve. If you have not heard of Founders, get your butt to go get some! An interesting hint of nut smell in the aroma, like peanut, to be specific."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Sam Adams ultimate drinking glass. Has classic IPA orange/gold appearance, not completely clear. Some sediment on bottom of bottle. Really full, white head, that fades to 1/8"" after a couple of minutes. Its smell is a strong hop smell, but not overwhelming, but you know you are smelling an ipa. On first taste has full strong flavor, warms my palate. Throughout the glass it keeps its full flavor, not a beer that fades as you drink it. Overall a very good IPA that tends to be a bit more filling than most american IPA's, definitely not thin or weak."
"Pours a nice slightly clouded orange amber. Nose is perfumed hops, but not a blast to the nose. Nice and even, but firm. Flavor is very nice. Hops are there, but this is no bomb. Just gives a solid hit to the mouth. Lots of pine-y hops. Feel is decent. A bit thinner on the liquid than I would have expected, but a good level of carbonation. Overall very drinkable. I would be down for trying this on tap, or even better, on cask."
"All in all this was a very enjoyable beer. This is tamer than other IPA's that I have tried. I could drink a few without being too worn out. I look forward to trying other Founders varieties."
"I have yet to have a bad beer from this brewery and this beer is no exception. Pours a hazy orange with a nice thick head and good lace. The aroma is floral and citrusy with a bit of bready malt as well. This is not an especially bitter IPA, but it has loads of citrus/flower flavour from what must be a large, late kettle addition of its namesake Centennial hops. Bready flavours dominate in the malt department wich are obviously there in a suppoting role only. The body is rather light and dry wich seems to help the hop character shine. I would like to see a little more malt complexity, but that is just my opinion. If the brewer wanted more malt in this beer it would be there. Nicely done."
"So many good beers these days and you can even buy them in Trader Joe's, which is where I got this. Substantial head on this as I poured it out, pleasant amber colour, quite clear. Nice resiny, hoppy aroma. Interesting layered flavours of hop (of course) and malt, a hint of caramel, fairly dry. Notable alcohol level. Certainly one to keep around."
"Flavor is bready and crackery, less bitterness than I was expecting. Centennial seems to be the steady, even-keel hop to the more brash and in-your-face varieties. The malt is equally showcased, adding body to the middle, with a drying finish. Aftertaste is clean and lightly herbal. It would be easy to have several in a sitting."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a amber color with a serious head that leaves nice fat lace and amazing head, beauty to look at. Smell is a bit piney with hints of sweet background, also a bit of tweed and lemon grass. Taste is a bit malty but very smooth with a nice hop bitterness that is tangy and tarty on the palate, this was a nice beer that went down smooth and I truly enjoyed drinking it. Awesome I am glad I was able to bring this back with me."
"Poured to pint glass from bottle smuggled from Michigan. It appears to have handled the journey well. Pours a hazy, golden with decent rocky head but head has somewhat poor retention. Particles in suspension and some lacing as well. Smell is crisp and clear and full of hops, there is some underlying malt but mainly hops. Taste is, as expected, nice and hoppy. A good IPA example, strong hops with a touch of malt. Moderate carbonation leads to a medium mouthfeel and an hoppy oily aftertaste, almost a little too much for my liking. Overall a good beer and strong offering from Grand Rapids best."
"Hazy orange-amber. Head recedes, some spotty lacing. Aroma has very nice grapefruity and floral hoppiness, but there is a funky edge that may be due to lack of freshness, I don't know. Maybe I will edit when I try a fresh sample in the future, but for now it detracts. Thankfully, the flavor does not seem to be affected. Very delicious and balanced, perhaps a touch on the sweet side, but the hops have a nice malty counterpoint. Smooth. Not the best or most complex IPA but good."
"M: bubbly freshness, a slight lasting aftertaste, however overall a solid IPA."
"D- A solid IPA with a good amount of sweetness. This has a balance that is different from the balance you would expect out of an IPA."
"Mouthfeel was great for the ABV and the characteristics from the smell. Needless to say this was a highly drinkable IPA. Very glad SPTR had this one on tap."
"Not really impressed by this. I love IPA's and i have had the pleasure of trying some other founders beers, but this one didn't work for me. Color was deep amber, small creamy white head with a little bit of lacing. Smell was mostly hops, a little sweet but some earthiness to it as well. Taste was really off--there was some sweetness in front with a dry bitterness from the hops behind that just didn't jive well. Not that either of those things are bad per se, but in this beer, or at least my bottle, they didn't work together. Pretty drinkable, especially for being over 7%, but I didn't really want another."
"O: Enjoyable and easy for a hop fan to drink..."
"All around a solid brew! Man, this one of the better IPAs around town."
"Appears a honey crimson amber damn these effin' Michiganer's why do they get all of the fanfuckintastic IPAs, large white head clings to every inch of the glass that doesn't get inhaled by my gullet. Aroma pure Centennials no false advertisement here just grapefruit upon grapefruit peel much like our good friend Two Hearted. Aroma yes I will compare this to that Bell's brew, because this is in the same category and caliber with the same single hop. Grapefruits are delicious especially in hop form, sugary malt components flow freely damn those are some fresh hops. Flavor such drinkable components such as the grape fruit pith and peel damn what a great hop with the sugary mild biscuit hop combo I could live on this IPA so tasty and zesty at that. Mouthfeel is mellow with even carbonation and slick oily carbonation, one fine medium bodied brew that delivers the way it should. Drinkability is equal with Bell's Two Hearted this is the street version that I prefer on it's own and Bell's Two Hearted pairs better with cuisine. If that all makes sense I'm game for whatever."
"IPA is relatively a simple ale ....and this one was done the way it should be."
"Taste is very bitter and hoppy with the fruity citric notes of lemon and is somewhat resinous. Maltiness is low and does not have the biscuity sweetness that a lot of IPAs have. Nevertheless this beer has a nice balance, but balance leans towards bitter and hop."
"Purchased at Merchant's Fine Wine in Dearborn last week. This poured honey golden in the glass, clear with a thin off-white head. Slow but steady stream of small bubble carbonation looks inviting. The head quickly spreads out to thinly coat the surface with a good ring and lacing. Smells very hoppy, banana, cantaloupe, vanilla, spice. Taste is dry with a flash of tartness, bitter, hoppy impressions are pronounced but not over the top, a nice drinking IPA. Mouthfeel was smooth with a lingering ginger-hoppy aftertaste. A swirl produces a regenerated head until the end of the glass. The 7.2% alcohol is well hidden in the mix. I found this to be comparable to the better IPA's I've tasted and I'll try to grab a six pack next time along with the other Founders products, the Bells, the Jolly Pumpkin and Dragonmead offerings - to name but a small sampling of what Merchant's in Dearborn offers."
"D- I had this awhile back on tap and really enjoyed it so I bought a bottle of it to take home and review. This is really a nice IPA that is all about hop flavor. One I will surly have again."
"Pours an amber orange color with a clear body. Head is an off white creamyness with excellent lacing. Smell is toasted, caramel malt that has a lot of sweetness in the aroma. I also pick out some herbs and a little pine as well. Taste is initially lightly sweet then finishes with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is oily and creamy, with some light carbonation."
"This is a really nice brew. Beautiful appearance, very pillowy head and lacing all the way down the glass. You have to wash it out before pouring another. Very smooth with some high octane laden malts up front, cooling down with a nice variance of hop flavor. Very drinkable, reasonably priced! I forgot how good founder's beers are. This one is a beauty!"
"Don't drink and reivew."
"This is an excellent beer. The brewers have done an excellent job masking the decent alcohol content, and have delivered a suprisingly smooth dry-hopped IPA. This is a great beer all around, and I'm glad to have had it for my 200th review. Haven't had a bad beer yet by the folks at Founders. Cheers."
"A tasty brew, but nothing to write home about."
"A fantastic American IPA that I will surely pick up again. Michigan should be proud of their many brewies producing such high-end and tastey brews. I toasted this gem to Appalachian State."
"D: Hard to believe that some of the best IPAs come out of Michigan, isn't it? Having had Two Hearted, this and Founders Red's Rye (not technically an IPA but a damned hoppy rye), I am convinced that the Lower Peninsula is brewing magic."
"Light body for an IPA and highly drinkable. Overall a very nice IPA, however there is nothing here that I haven't had in elsewhere."
"Scott"
"Amber,unfiltered body with no head.Nice hoppy aroma.Nice lacing on my glass and hoppy(floral,grapefruit and citrus flavor) With some malt added to the mix.I read that this doesnt have any bitterness to it but I sure taste it.Nice hop varieties also.Good ipa."
"D - Highly drinkable, smooth and satisfying. Definitely glad I picked up a six pack."
"Overall: Really good tasting beer. I love the grapefruit quality that the centennial hops brings out. It has a nice level of bitterness without going over the top. It drinks really easy and is relatively cheap. I enjoyed this one greatly and put down 3 in one setting. It's another good brew by Founder's. Man Do I Love The Midwest."
"D - A pretty good IPA. It is not overly hoppy, but nicely blended/balanced."
"Side note- This is my beer review #666!!! nice."
"Drinkability: I like this beer. It is deeper than most APAs that I've had. I would certainly drink this beer again if I can get it."
"You notice the hops immediately but it is followed with a nice malt presence and you get just a hint of the 7.2% alcohol. A very well balanced, everyday drinkable, and nicely done American IPA."
"Overall: pretty good, middle of the pack American IPA. Somewhat darker malt for the style, hoppy but I wouldn't call it a hop bomb."
"It's a solid American IPA...For the style it does exactly what it's supposed to and does it well, but there aren't any qualities about it that make me wanna stand up and shout either. Definitely a good choice though."
"Drinkability: A very flavorful, well-balanced IPA. A great session beer in answer to all the crazy-hopped extreme beers. Not perfect, but still a really good IPA, one I would gladly drink again."
"I like this but I would really love to see this on cask. I think it has great firkin potential."
"I was totally suprised to find the alcohol content of this beer. It is completely hidden. First class beer."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, light, crystal, and Carapils malts along with a wonderful hop aroma. There seems to be a slight breadlike character as well. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor along with a solid malt base that goes down with ease and warms on the finish. The hops are well pronounced and piney; just the way I like them. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking IPA. It's got excellent malt and hop character. Another solid offering from Founder's."
"D - Good, but I'm more likely to pick up other brands for an American IPA."
"Pours an amber color with a nice two finger head and excellent lacing throughout the drink. Nose is solid as well. Lots of fruity hops, light toffee malt. Taste is complex and interesting: floral hops on the tongue up front, light malt in the middle, and lots of drying floral hops at the end. Solid, medium body. I really like this one, a very good IPA, and another hit for Founders."
"Pours light amber with marmalade hues and a nice dense creamy and pillowed off-white head. Smells of caramel malts and woodsy pine. Flavors of sweet pine and blood orange with a little more early-hop bitterness on the finish. The alcohol pokes its head out here and there, but mostly behaves itself as long as things don't warm up too much. It lost a little on the drinkability because while it is not too hoppy for me, something about its character - the late bitterness perhaps - kept hanging around so that I wanted a break from the flavor. A rock solid American IPA though overall though. Maybe east coast meets west coast?"
"Pours an intensely turbid, light amber color. Lots of hops floatings around in this one (don't think it's yeast). Big old white foamy head forms. This one is a hoppy bastard. Plenty of grapefruit in the aroma. It really is like opening up a hop sack. Centennials are much higher in AA than cascade but smell almost identical. Not a whole lot of malt profile coming through in the nose, a slight crystal malt toastiness, but not much else. On the palate, this is one of the most beautifully crafter IPAs. The hops make a pronounced impression with their flavor and aroma but without a biting bitterness. This one is almost too malty, making it slightly out of balance for my taste; I would like to see some more bite to it. Carbonation is quite low, almost like cask, very nice. I prefer hoppy beers like this to be lower in carbonation than most commercial varieties. Anyway, this is a damn good IPA, perhaps the best beer I've had from Founder's and one I wish was local."
"A real good drinker. The 7.2% ABV is hidden well. Money."
"Pours a nice copper with a decent initial head that fades somwehat quickly and leaves some good lacing. The smell is piney hops and light grain. Orange citrus rind develops as well. The taste is smooth and very well balanced. Piney hops, some light waxiness, orange and grapefruit rind, and a medium bitter finish are all evident. The mouthfeel is very liquid and refreshing, not too thick or grainy at all. Nice dryness. This one is very balanced with lots of flavor and easy drinkability. A very nice example of the style."
"Good session brew here. Founders has some gems and some turds, this is in the middle there somewhere."
"D- A very drinkable American IPA. Definitely something I can go back to when I want to drink more than one in an evening. A great beer to have with a meal. It paired quite nicely with the BBQ during lunch."
"Pours a rich copper hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a nice layer. Stickiness is all over, really enjoy how this one looks...doesn't let go one bit. Smell is a mild piney hop scent with a bit of alcohol in the nose. Not overpowering by any means. Taste is very complex. A bready pine hop (if that makes any sense) flavor up front that fizzles to a dry pale malty hop flavor (once again, if that makes any sense). I really like how much flavor this one has, it's all over the place but in a good way, all the flavors are very enjoyable. Pretty full bodied for this style with a good amount of bubbles. Quite drinkable, I could easily put a few down in one sitting. The bit of alcohol on the tongue does take away from the drinkability though. I've loved every beer from Founders and look forward to more. I feel this one is too much in the shadow of KBS. Centenial IPA deserves more love!!!"
"The texture is smooth and pleasant, allowing me to focus on the well balanced flavors. Velvety finishing mouthfeel."
"looks like your ""normal"" american ipa, a hazy orangey amber in the glass with creamy off-white head and lacing. very nice aromas of resiny citrus and sweet two-row malts. also some toffee and bread dough notes. for a 7.2% beer i expected more malt presence and body. this has just a hint of sweetness before the hop bitterness takes over. medium long finish. barely medium-bodied and alcohol is undetectable despite the listed abv. drinkability suffers from the abv...you can get more body, flavor, and aroma from an alpha king which weighs in at 6% abv, but i would not be disappointed to see this beer more readily available."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This IPA pours a slightly hazy golden/amber with a thin beige head that quickly turns into a slightly transparent layer of tiny, fizzy bubbles. Very light lacing. Aroma is a huge fruity, caramel hop experience. Grapefruit notes dominate, along with some orange and pine. Slight hint of alcohol. Is this a double IPA? The aroma had me thinking I was in for a taste bud assault, but this is an IPA with balance. Nice malty taste of caramel, then you taste the citrusy hops. This is what I want an India Pale to taste like. I love my doubles, but this is a beer that you could actually eat a meal along with. Medium-body with light carbonation. Quick, slightly bitter finish. Excellent!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, carbonation is excellent, and at 7.2%, it's perfect. Very drinkable. I think I could happily sesson this. I really don't think it's that strong. Overall, very nice offering from Founders. Check it out."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light-medium gold with quickly fading head - a bit cloudy, so it gets an extra point for that. Aroma is of very nice hops, but isn't particularly strong. Ah, but the first taste is particularly strong! Very nice filling of the mouth and a bold assault on the tastebuds (of the good kind). Nice and hoppy, and not too piney. </me looking up what Centennial hops are supposed to be like> Yes, from the sounds of it, these are the type of floral hops that are up my alley. Nice beer!"
"Smell is very fruity, lots of citrus (grapefruit in particular), as well as some caramal malt and bready aromas. Taste is mostly the same with quite a bit of bitterness, but also more toasted malt flavor than caramel malt sweetness. The bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste. My only complaint is that I'd like a bit more malt sweetness to balance that bitterness, but this is very tasty nonetheless. It's medium-bodied and the hops make it oily and creamy on the palate. Very high quality IPA overall."
"Purchased a growler of this from the brewery to enjoy at home. Pours a dark hazy golden color with a nice white head that sticks around for a bit. Smells of plenty of nice hops. Taste is also full of hops with some slight floral flavor, but not overwhelming. There is a bit of malt taste as it goes down, and it goes down easy but full the entire time. A bit of sweetness as it finishes and makes for a great session IPA."
"Pours a hazy honey color with tons of sediment in it, far more than even my homebrew.little head or lacing even with it being an IPA, Smell is dominate with floral hops, oranges, and other citrus scents. Taste is hops first and foremost, very well done, a nice balance with the subtle maltiness. Mouthfeel is full and robust, very well done as well. very good IPA and it was pretty cheap aswell, can't go wrong."
"Surprisingly thin relative to the scent and taste (one would almost expect a DIPA), which in turn makes it a wonderful session brew. Which reminds me of the alcohol; totally undetectable at over 7%. Skillful brewing to be sure."
"Toasted malt and big citric hop bitterness right out of the gate. Tongue is already numb! Slight cookie and fruit malt get lost mid-palate amidst acidic, citrus-pine-resin hop bitterness. Not as balanced as the aroma would lead you to believe. Juicy citrus bitterness in the finish with lasting mint and numbness. Dry. Medium-bodied with a slight minerally feel. Tongue-bruising, but that's not a bad thing if you like in-your-face IPAs."
"Overall this is an awesome IPA. If you expect overpowering hops this one isn't for you. I would drink this one anytime. I can't believe it's taken me this long to review it since it is right in my backyard. Highly, highly recommended! Possibly the best IPA I've had. Delicious."
"Pours a cloudy copper/amber, thick white head forms, nice lacing, super retention. Smell is really piney, some nice floral/citrus notes, bit of caramel, bread, fruits, nice balance. Taste is very bitter up front, toffee, bit of chocolate, bread, citrus/grapefruit, floral, fruits, quite bitter, bit of of balance, but nice flavours. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation. Nice complexity of hop flavours, slightly weak in the finish and maybe a bit unbalanced with the bitterness, but a nice drink! Thanks Josh!"
"A very good IPA. I just got back from San Diego, and this beer measures up nicely. The appearance is a bit rough, but it is as advertised."
"Well balanced and thick. Quite drinkable, and i also experienced a few centinnial hop burps that tasted pleasantly fruity!"
"D - This would be a decent session beer."
"Founders Centennial IPA pours a slightly hazy orange copper with a nice foamy head. Aroma is big citrusy hops, sweet orange mostly. Flavor is at first a hint of malt sweetness that pokes through just long enough to be noticed before it is completely covered by the huge bitterness and hop flavor. Tons more citrus, still mostly orange, hints of bitter orange peel as well. This is what I want when I'm in the mood for an IPA, nice and hoppy without being over the top."
"Bottled, received in trade. This is a great single IPA. Pours a nice cantalope type color and the aroma is jumping. The flavor is big, really big for a single. Citrus with tad of malt and nice lightly creamy texture. Dang, I wish Founders had distribution out here, this is good! Got to try their Devil Dancer triple soon!"
"Very easy drinking,feels nice on the palate. Above average IPA not the best, but very memorable. Would like to drink this one again a lot more than a half bottle next time. An IPA worth a try!"
"I don't know what it is about the Founders IPA, but I find it really appealing. It has more character than most IPAs, and is a little softer and mellower than most. Rather than the hard edge of some IPAs, it has richness. I would have it with an aged steak--or, in my case, a small filet mignon--topped with a thin slice of Maytag Blue cheese.."
"With a little bit darker color than expected in an IPA, this beer... nice. The consitancy feels a little thick, and the hops could be balanced a little better (it almost borders too close to an american barley wine to me). However, it's still a good drink, and worthy of your time."
"A nice A-IPA."
"Overall-a very well balanced IPA and in fact just what I look for in this style."
"I bought a couple bottles online just to see what these Midwest IPA's are like. The color was dark orange (almost brown) with a very nice head. there was a slight citrus component to the smell. The taste seemed very balanced between malt and hop. I was kinda expecting a hop-bomb but this was still a very solid IPA. The website touted it as ""the rich man's Two-Hearted"" and I did enjoy it more than the two-hearted I drank just prior."
"D - Overall this was a very nice sessionable IPA. The dry hopping was definatly noticeable and made for a great profile. I definatly would not turn this one down. I am really becoming a fan of the Founders brews and this was no exception."
"Pours a bright copper color into pint glass. Two finger head leaves moderate lacing. Aroma on this one is exceptional. Very nice blend of earthy and citrus hops. Taste is much earthier, with a lot more pine up front and not as much citrus as anticipated from the nose. Resiny. Some carmel malts and a slight hint of roasted malts in the background. A very nice IPA, but not my favorite. More of a winter beer than a summer."
"I love this IPA!"
"Drinkability: A classic example of the american IPA that is very approachable for the new craft beer drinker. I could easily enjoy a number of these in a sitting."
"D- It is a damn good IPA. I think the blend of hops is close to perfect."
"If I deciphered the notch correctly, this was bottled in November. I look forward to a higher-scoring beer the next time I can find a fresher bottle, or better yet, discover this great-tasting IPA on tap."
"This is a really nice IPA which I'll definitely put into my drinking rotation."
"poured a medium amber color with a thin, sticky head that lasted the entire serving. floral hop smells with a little citrus in there. the taste was a tad different from your average ipa, more sour citrus (mostly lime) taste offset the hops bitterness. mouthfeel was a bit oily with a pretty dry finish. not too bad, a nice play on the standard bitter ipa."
"This beer pairs up nicely with spicy foods. The hops cut right through the spice and the carbonation scrubs the tounge making the next bite feel like the first."
"Overall, not the best American IPA I've had (aftertaste), but I'll chalk that up to personal taste and rate it on the other characteristics."
"Overall, a quality beer. I'll grab some more of this next time I see it."
"Another solid offering from one of the premier micros in the U.S."
"D: Instantly drinkable, eminently thirst quenching beer. I would buy this every chance I get."
"Smooth, enjoyable, drinkable. Good session beer if you want several with lots of flavor and character and just a bit of kick."
"D- Pretty easy to put away. I read somewhere that this was a ""rich man's Two Hearted."" I don't think they knew what they were talking about, but this is good none-the-less."
"M&D - rather thin bodied, but decent flavor, nice hoppiness, but too thin for me, and missing so background sweetness, im not trying to tell them how to brew, just thats what ive come to expect and enjoy with my IPA's. the flavors are great to me, but something is missing"
"D: Pleasantly refreshing and very clean. Each sip begs for the next. I cound not drink a six pack in one evening...but I will try!"
"Overall, this is one of the most vegetal tasting IPA. Reminds me of fresh garden veggies. Also reminds me of the first time I tried to eat whole hops. Brilliant."
"Drinkability: Quite good. I down this puppy pint after pint whenever I go to eat at Glass Nickel."
"A very good IPA in the most traditional manner. Very worthy of a flight with other top notch IPA's."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely copper with golden hues around the edge, nice whitish head that shrinks to a good film and pretty decent lacing down the glass. Need more head? give it a swirl. Aroma is intensely piney and citric, not much room for any malts in here. Taste is kind of the same, an agressive resinous pine hopping with citrus battling for attention, very woody and raw feeling, but not, while a faint bready caramel malt cries in the corner of the room, alone and weak. Mouth is full, smooth and creamy, with good carbonation and a nice, dry finish. A hell of an IPA, very drinkable, I want more, but friggin expensive."
"Cheers!"
"Another great Founders brew."
"I won't be drinking this beer again, yet I would recommend it just because it is a bit unique."
"Pours a hazy coppery orange with all kinds of little things floating around in there. It also leaves some nice lacing. Aromas of citrus hops especially in the form of grapefruit. There is also a little caramel in there too. Taste is more of the same with a lot of citrusy, oily hops and some sweet caramel. The high alcohol is pretty hidden making this a very drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a bright orange-red color with lingering off-white head and good lacing thru the entire glass. Aroma was floral and grapefruit/citrus. Flavor was more citrus, and the finish was smooth, slightly bitter, and very hoppy. A good beer."
"I like this beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected for a big abv IPA like this. Carbonation is a little on the light side IMO, but not too bad."
"The taste is tart up front, but more from the hop character than anything. A solid biting bitterness leaves a tingling sensation on my tongue. The beer seems to taste a bit murky for some reason, though I am not entirely sure yet if this is a bad thing or not. Dusty biscuit-like malt notes and a crystal malt character are in evidence as well. Actually the murky notes seem to stem from the malt character; it is just a bit much for this to work as a pure celebration of the Centennial hops. Not a bad beer certainly, but it could use some bright, clean, sweet malt notes to accentuate the hops a bit more. While the aroma ran towards the sweet side of the citrus hop spectrum, the flavor has more of a tart edge to it. Again it is a grapefruit note that dominates, but there is a touch of sour orange and perhaps even a slight tangerine note. A solid beer, and one which I certainly enjoy drinking."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy deep amber/copper color, unfiltered with a good foamy head that slowly fades, leaving good lacing. Smells primarily of citrus with some malt and pine. Taste is citrus up front, mainly grapefruit, followed by some maltiness, almost a bubblegum hint, and then pine. Medium in body with nice light carbonation throughout, very smooth. An excellent IPA, not too dry, nor too overly hoppy."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle that had the dating system based on the location of a notch on the top or bottom of the main label. Was a hazy copper color. Had a good head that settled into a thin film and lacing. The mouthfeel was solid. The aroma was obviously heavy on the hops and had some pine in the background. The taste was classic American IPA and one of the best I've tried in the style. Starts strong and never lets up. Can taste it long after you've taken the drink. Really enjoyed this one and wishe it was available back in Texas. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my DFH pint glass a medium amber with two fingers of off-white head. Hoppy aroma with the usual grapefruit/citrus notes. Hops are dominant from start to finish, but only slightly. I'm not feeling the malt. Very little balance that I could detect. Does the centennial denote the type of hops used? If so, where did they get this crop from? I'm not getting the signature fruity pebbles/froot loops qualities that I so much enjoy from this hop varietal. This beer does have a nice medium body and carbonation though. I would not seek this out but would drink it on occasion."
"The body has a mid feel to it and very easy to drink considering the ABV. A somewhat oily taste but still remains lick-smacking good. The bubblegum isn't an off flavor but does blend well. Overall this is a good beer and well worth a high praise."
"Its drinkability is surpassed only by its price tag. Here in Boston it was a hair under $10 for six. But Im glad I tried it. Delicious balanced beer, but not outright IPA enough for me to justify for regular consumption over my favorites."
"Tastes a hint of sweetness that quickly bitters and moves on to a dry finish. A medium bodied IPA that is nice on the tongue with mingling flavors of citrus and pine. This is a complex IPA yet easy to drink. Cheers to Founders!"
"Much less hoppy and much more balance than expected. Very drinkable brew."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden amber color with a two finger soapy looking head Smell is of citrusy hops, grapefruit, pine and a very slight nose of alcohol. Taste is initially sweet, with the citrus notes coming out with a hoppy pine dry finish. The alcohol is well hidden, very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall I would have to say that this is an extremely drinkable beer, I would never guess there's 7.2% in this bad boy. Stop reading this and go out and get one for yourself!"
"Friends, it doesn't get much better than this for an IPA. From the enticing visuals, to the lovely aromatics and sticky, sweet caramel flavors...she's a winner."
"Overall, a well-balanced American IPA that exudes pungent Centennial hops. Another fine effort from those folks in Michigan."
"earthy, prickly, piney, tangy hop flavor. there's plenty of malt to hold onto, however. the hop finish is slightly sweet; almost in the same way that i revile in simcoe...double standard i guess"
"A beautiful clear yellow-orange with a thin white head in my nonick pint glass. Smells of dry, floral hops - not syrupy like alot of the West Coast IPAs. A clean crisp finish - a good drinker. I can only compare it to a not as ""in your face"" Hop Wallop. I would definitely pick up a sixer if they presented themselves in PA."
"I have six of them, and that is six times I have to fall in love and recite poetry to a new best friend. Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable IPA despite its hig halcohol content which may hinder the drinkability for most. Despite that, as said, everything else is there to make you want to have one after another...just be careful, it will creep up on ya! Great IPA from Founders...I'd expect nothing less form them."
"A copper/orange color, with an off white head, that is a quater of an inch thick. The aroma is an incredible blend of fragrant hops, with citrus, pine, earthy, scents. A well balanced flavor, with the hops announcing themselves right off the start, followed by a strong malt flavor, then the reappearance of the hops right at the end. A light to medium bodied feel, it has a nice dry finish. Very drinkable, fantastic flavor and scent, I am left wanting more."
"Medium body, active carbonation, almost creamy. Slick hop oils coat the mouth. Some dryness lingers. I would buy this if I could get it around here."
"Clean and refreshing mouthfeel, but not thin and watery either. This is one of the best IPAs I've tried - hoppy but not overpowering. Relatively high ABV, but otherwise this'd make a great session beer. Too bad I only have two of them..."
"Generally the single-hop beers are a great exercise in understanding hop flavor but usually suffer with a lack of depth and complexity. This beer does no such thing. An abundance of fruit juices, acidity, and variety offers a new flavor in every sip. IPA's just don't get better."
"Overall: This is Founders ""standard"" take on the IPA style, and is the much lower octane option in comparison to Devil Dancer. I enjoy both of them."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"Pours a clear amber orange with a giant off white foamy head. A very nice looking IPA. The smell is a great combination of citrus hops and bread yeast. The ""bisquity"" aroma along with tangerine/grapefruit hops are like the bakery and produce aisles of a grocery store. The taste is creamy with hop bitterness and some citrus flavor. Not as much of the citrus as the smell,but still a very good flavor. The m/f is light and hides the high alcohol well making this a very drinkable IPA. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Body is a little undercarbonated. Other than that, I will reall enjoy this bottle of beer."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color producing an enormous, fluffy soap bubbly-like head. Great head retention and lacing throughout the glass. Classic Centennial hop nose dominates with a crisp blast of pine and fresh orange rind. Some mild caramel malt notes sneak their way through in the aroma also. Lively carbonation on the tongue followed by a pleasant slick, slighly oily mouthfeel. Extremely well balanced flavor profile between the malts and hops. Flavor starts out with a notable creamy caramel candy sweetness, but quickly transcends to a crisp, lip-smacking, citrusy hop resin moderate bitterness. Nice long bitter-sweet finish on the back of the tongue. An admirable American IPA!!"
"I think I have Derbert to thank for this beer. If I am wrong please beermail me and let me know."
"D- Very nice hot day brew. Carbonation makes it filling."
"Pours a fairly clear, rusty brown with a good sized and reasonably long-lived head. 48 deg F. Strong grapefruit aroma. Taste of citrus and resin which fairly coats my mouth, with a lingering pine needle finish. Fairly thin mouthfeel. Hides its alchohol well given that it is at the high end of standard IPAs. Excellent mild bitterness offset by the fruit-malt backbone. Aroma 10; Appearance 2; Flavor 15; Mouthfeel 3; overall 7 (37/50)."
"O: This beer has all of the elements to be the one that you stay with all night long. It’s very tasty, has a good kick, not-too-filling and is another one of those beers where you just keep craving the next sip."
"D: This is a ""wow"" beer. I cracked this expecting just another IPA and boy was I surprised. Consider me a fan."
" It was less hoppy than I had expected. Pleasant, overall very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"I love the way this beer showcases every aspect of this hop. Thanks to FBG Tip Top for the bottle!! :thumbup:"
"Single bottle from Woodman's and smuggled back to NC from Madison. The notch is on the far right side of the label...so that's what? a bottling date of June?"
"This one was a pleasant suprise, one of the most original tastingIPA's i've had this summer...and I've had a few!"
"I guess if this is a choice among other swill beers, then take it, but if you have other options, don't bother with this."
"Clear copper/orange color. Not a great head but nice sticky spiderweb lacing. Lots of pine in both the smell and taste. Very sharp piney resin taste. Strong finishing bitterness. Somewhat oily mouthfeel. 7.2% is well hidden. Overall a solid offering. What i would expect from a brewery with a rep like Founders. Didn't dissapoint at all."
"Bottle (courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a deep hazy amber color ale with a huge slightly off white foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of citrus hops is clearly detectable but nice semi-sweet malt presence provides good balance. Taste is also quite strong on citrus hops with nice malt base. Body is above average and I really enjoyed the low filtration level."
"stiffly hoppy, weedy taste. finishes very hoppy with an oily bitterness and the barest hints of sweet fruits. medium carbonation and a decent drinkability, though the palate's ruined for anything else."
"Had this one on-tap at Founders, 12oz in a tall pilsner glass. Dark orangish in color, it didn't have much head. I was hoping for more. The aroma was heavenly - flowery, fruity, and hoppy. Yum. It tasted like, well, an IPA - slightly sweet to start, with a lingering, satisfying bitter finish. Especially good after downing an old ale first. It was mostly well-balanced, but felt just a little watery and the carbonation was just barely irritating. Overall, it drank easy and I could have had more."
"D - Extremely quenching and balanced. This is a great example of what an IPA should be...extremely balance, while still focusing on citric piney hops. Outstandingly drinkable. Perhaps THE most drinkable IPAs IMHO (I have a hard time sessioning IPAs due to the bitterness...I love them for that bitter flavor, but I usually can't bring myself to drink three or four of them...but I could drink a sixer of this!)"
"Poured a pale golden orange with decent clarity and passing retention. Two fingered white head, dense in consistency, leaving light but sticky lacing. Weak american hop nose, some citrus and pine needles, nothing else. Toasted two-row sweetness upfront, followed by a hint of butterscotch. Semi-dry aftertaste; grassy with citrus hop notes. Medium carbonation and light-medium body. The mouthfeel turns buttery but not quite slick near the end. Finishes pretty clean by IPA standards, and very drinkable. The flavor is simple and balanced, but also timid. Good choice for a session ale, but not the best choice if you are looking for a hop bomb."
"I read that the brewery is expanding capacity, and that may mean wider distribution. For all you IPA fans, that will be especially good news."
"D - Very drinkable. Glad to have had a chance to check this one out, very tasty."
"Yet another excellent beer from the folks at Founder's. The perfect balance makes this one of the easiest-drinking IPAs I've ever come across."
"Overall it's a little different, but worth a second try. Very enjoyable."
"I will find this one again!"
"Nice amber color with a white head that slowly falls but still sticks around and leaves nice rings of lacing around the glass. Good caramel backbone mixed with earthy and citric hops in the nose. Smell was very good, it just didn't jump right out at me. Earthy hops with caramel to balance it off, then a soft citric bitterness sets in for the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied. Damn good mouthfeel, maybe a little stickier or heavy and it'd be perfect for me. Doesn't get much better than this, a damn fine brew. I'll be picking this up again."
"Poured with an orange-amber hue and a nice, rich frothy head. The nose was quite fresh with flowery hops wafting up from my pint glass. The taste was sharp and intense with classic hoppiness one would expect, and then golden spices surround the easy but lengthy finish. The hops are a tad bit over the top at first taste, and easier on the back end. I could see myself drinking 4 in a sitting, but probably not more due to its intensity. A damn fine brew and I'm glad it's finally in Mass."
"What a damn fine IPA. This beer is what the future of American IPA's is going to be. SNPA up one step. More please."
"Mouthfeel- Real clean and fresh. A good bitterness with some well incorporated malts. The finish liongered long enough but didn't overstay it's welcome."
"Mouthfeel is nice...medium body. A little too much carbonation, though. Not an incredibly balanced beer, but it's not really difficult to drink."
"Pours copper in color and cloudy with a cream head that fades quickly. Strong piney hop aroma with a little grapefruit, sweet malts, and boozyness in the nose, although pineyness is most dominant. Taste follows these lines with a some lemony citrus up front, followed by a big piney hops that finish with some peppery alcohol. Medium in body, good malt content, finishes dry and tingles the tongue. Tastes towards the big end of the style spectrum, but very enjoyable."
"Yay American IPA's"
"Served lightly chilled in an American pint glass. I've had countless bottles of this before but never got around to reviewing it. A very frothy two-finger tan head forms, and remains above 1cm untill beer is completed. Clear and copper in color.You can instantly smell the citrusy/piney aromas that the centennial hops give off through the bubbling head. Amazing in flavor. Begins with a wave of sweet toasted malt, and is overcome by the pleasent centennial hops. Bitter, yet smooth. It has a somewhat thick mouthfeel for an IPA. Not that this is bad at all. Leaves a clean feeling in your mouth. Drinkability is high. I will continue to purchase this beer for as long as it's available to me. This is easily on of my favorite beers, and IMHO, one of the best IPAs out there."
"Pours a dark amber with a white head and gentle lacing. Smells of many hops and citrus, maybe some pine notes. Taste is very hoppy with a strong bitter finish. Aftertaste is mainly bitter hops with a strong coat on your tongue. The mouthfeel is impressive, a good balance of flavor, carbonation, and undertones. I am not a huge IPA fan but I am a huge founders fan. I couldn't help but try this one out and again founders hasn't disappointed. I would recommend this for any hop fanatic."
"Very solid IPA, not my favorite, but a good one that's worthy of becoming a regular in my lineup. Very reasonably priced too."
"Drinkabilty - not the best IPA I have had, too hoppy to consume a lot of."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a big white head. Smells of sweet smelling hops and a taste to match with some carbonation but nowhere near overwhelming. I only picked up a single to try but this is something I would definetly pick up a six of in the future."
"Founders Centennial pours with a ridiculously massive head. Slightly cloudy in the body, nice deep amber. Smell is outrageously citrusy, with pungent, acidic citrus notes keeping at bay any malt character. On the palate, it's more of the same -- very little malt to get in the way of the huge citrus hop bitterness, although there is a raw alcohol sweetness there. It's unbalanced by pleasantly so, as the hop flavors and hop bitterness that are here are quite good. This is not a smooth beer -- it's extreme all the way. A hophead's delight."
"This is an interesting IPA. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Very nice."
"Pours up with a nice two finger head that lingers and lingers if you let it sit you can see where the larger pockets of air break and leave indentions in the head. An amazing lace clings to the glass from top to bottom. The smell is nice, bright hops, foreward malts, and a nice grapefruity citrus aroma. The taste is also very nice, fruity up front, orange and lemon zest. Some piney notes in the middle, very nice, and a sweet herbal hop kick in the end...even the exhaust is bitter....nice. The mouthfeel was initially, I felt, too water but on second taste it is quite creamy if not a bit undercarbonated. Damn drinkable, and at over 7% abv, maybe a bit dangerous."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer looks like an IPA. Hazy orangish color with a decent 1.5 finger head and very good lacing. Smells of grapefruit hoppiness with a very slight sweetness backing things up. Taste is good. A little different than I was expecting after the smell. Toasted bitternes with a sweetness that melds very well. Finishes a little on the dry side. Mouthfeel is decent as well as drinkability. Nice IPA."
"Drinkability - this goes down easy, is a good beer and would be a good session beer."
"I couldn't get a clean whiff of the aroma since I had to kind of let the beer trickle from the bottle so I wouldn't disturb the head anymore. I do smell a clean hop aroma that has notes of citrus. The hops seem a little subdued, not as bitter as expected (could be that I waited too long to try this one). Also has a little alcohol that lets you know that this is a strong brew, but doesn't flex a lot of muscle. A hint of grapefruit in the finish. Medium body that is pretty drinkable. I would really like to try this one again sometime soon. Even though this is a good beer, I don't think that I tried it at its best."
"Note: Consumed after trying a DFH 60 minute, and this was by far the hoppier brew (and less complex)."
"D - The drinkability is outstanding! I know it is 7.2% but I would try like mad to session this one. Excellent! Thank you mlh1227!!"
"D: A little ""hot"" for an IPA, but maybe this is a 1 1/2 IPA. Love drinking it, but there is a lot of alcohol."
"A solid dry hopped brew."
"Does take a hit in mouthfeel resulting in a hit in drinkability."
"If you like IPAs give this one a try."
"Drinkability is really, really high. I only have one, and am trying to make this one last, but it's a losing, (but delicious), battle."
"Founders makes a lot of really good beers. Drink those, not this one."
"Good mouthfeel on this one, but it gets a bit too puckery in the finish. Otherwise this is a bold and flavorful version of the style that I highly reccomend."
"I definitely enjoyed this and would certainly pick more up if given the opportunity."
"I thoroughly recommend it!"
"Bad: Not as bold as some of the great IPA's but that can be a good thing if you are looking for something that is dialed down a bit."
"Verdict: Heavy and earthy, yet light and sweet; this is a nice, complex IPA."
"The body is moderate to full. Not too sweet and sticky, not too bitter. Very good mix. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable. Founders has done it for me once again."
"Wow, I am very impressed by this IPA. It packs a pucnh with its hop bite, but it is suitably balanced by a caramel-malt backbone. It has a sweet floral aroma, but the taste is very bitter and wonderful hops. I tend only to review beers that I like, particularly IPAs. Looking over the list of IPAs that I have liked, I would have to say that this stacks up with my favorites: Hop Ottin, Hop Devil, Southern Tier, Stone, etc."
"Clear light gold in color. Moderate oxidation in the aroma, with a light hint of butter toffee, caramel and lemon zest and grapefruit, derived from the use of 100% Centennial hops. Flavor is lightly oxidized, with caramel and butter toffee and lemon zest from the Centennial. Ive found that I havent been enjoying solely Centennial hopped beer lately, even Two Hearted."
"D: Exceptional."
"Clear, medium amber beer topped by a moderately dense, cream coloured head. Great retention and plenty of lacing. Powdery grapefruit and orange hop aromas with a balancing malt character. Solid bitterness that grows through the finish, but never becomes unbalanced. Malt is a bit toasty up front, but disappears behind the grassy grapefruit hop flavours that increase mid-sip. Finishes with a bit of hop resin that lingers for a while. Medium body, slightly creamy, with average carbonation. Overall, this is a well balanced IPA, highly drinkable. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"Bronze/amber in color with a massive head. lots of sediment in the bottom that i chose not to pour into my glass (sometimes i like to, sometimes i dont). Wow, that's really a big foamy sticky head. Extreme floral hop odor. citrusy and fresh smelling. Taste is bitter, some maltiness. very hoppy but not overly so...hint of citrus (lemony?). very tasty. Fizzy, good body. nice mouthfeel for an IPA. Good drinkability. high alcohol well hidden. great example of an American IPA."
"It has a smooth mouthfeel with typical carbonation. I look forward to the remainder of my 6 pack and would recommend this beer to any IPA fan out there with one piece of advice. Leave the last half or quarter inch in the bottle unless you want the sediment."
"This is a solid IPA and certainly worth checking out. Seriously drinkable at 7.2% ABV."
"Aroma of draft IPA, hop leaf and malts, and grapefruit. Simple, citrus juicy. Not astringent rather fruit, melon, juicy fruit gum. Some lace. Initially very large head. A nice smooth drink. Easy mouthfeel, body on the light side. Very very drinkable."
"EDIT: I've had this beer a few times since I submitted this review and its not as good as I remember it being.  I don't choose it, there's much more going on in the world of IPAs than what this beer presents."
"Full bodied. Coats the mouth well. A bit too much carbonation as evident by the overwhelming head. Drinkability is good. The flavor seems a bit up front. I'm a hop head but I don't see me having too many of these in a row. A good one per night IPA."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty high on this offering from founders. Very smooth drinking and refreshing IPA with a nice aftertaste and a bit of warming action in your belly. Would definately have this one again."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours a dark orange almost brown with suttle tangerine highlights throughout leaving a thin beige lace that bubbles away quickly. The nose is lemon, orange rinds, that are sauteed in brown butter and the candied (Sugar added). The taste on the palate is balanced, it starts with a grapefruit bitterness, followed by a slight carbonation that brings with it some caramel sweetness then finishes with a fruity gummy candy taste."
"The problem with IPA is that the stong hop presence makes it difficult to drink a lot of these without putting the tastes buds in shock. However this beer goes down smooth, be it the first or the fifth."
"I could drink many of these, but it's a bit pricey and it's underwhelming for what it is. I don't object, as long as someone else pays."
"Very well done, something to get me excited about IPAs again."
"good drinkability the 7.2 abv doesn't show itself very much. i'm regretting getting just the single. a sixer is definitely in order for this beer. an excellent american IPA."
"Hops everywhere. Great IPA."
"Yeah this is good stuff. Let it warm up a little before you pour it to bring out the best of this beer. Its nice to have an IPA with such enjoyable fruity characteristics and great balance. This is a pleasure to drink. Very well done."
"Nice IPA, Founders!"
"Stone Brewery IPA"
"Just a touch too much hop bitternes in the aftertaste. Seems a bit astringent at times. A beer I could drink all day every day."
"Just of boat load of hops from start to finish. All about the pine & grapefruit flavours. Medium bodied, relaxed carbonation. Wish it had a bit more of a malty backbone, but a tasty drinker all the same."
"Drinkability: This beer seems to lack any great or distinct flavor out of the bottle. What's there is tasty but there's not much."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a very clean full to medium bodied mouthfeel. Man is this beer good. The beer is well balanced between the hops and the fruityness. I am going to go out and buy more."
"Drinkability... I could go for another of these easily."
"D - This is very drinkable for the style"
"Another fine offering from Founder Brewing. I have yet to be disappointed with one of their beers. Keep up the great work guys!!!!"
"Pours a golden yellow with a centimeter of foam and a geyser of bubbles nearly turning my glass to a boil and maintaining the head to the last drop. Beautiful. Smell is hoppy enough, floral and citrus, with a hint of malt, but overall fairly subtle. Taste is even more subtle than the nose, light floral hops balanced with caramel malt. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side but makes for incredible drinkability. The 7.2% abv is undetectible making this a seemingly sessionable IPA, Subtlety and simplicity is the name of the game here. An IPA for the masses (and mass consumption)."
"overall: first off, thanks to dirtylou for hookin' me up with this. a very good ipa. flavorful with nice centennial hop aromas, but hoppiness and bitterness is not over the top. good balancing malty flavors as well. get you some and enjoy!"
"Drinkability: This will definitely be in my regular rotation from now on. A solid offering from a great local brewery. Strongly recommended."
"another outstanding brew from founders....american ipa is my probably my favorite style of the hour and this one did not dissapoint, worth seeking out"
"Didn't think I was going to like this beer at all, in fact, I was thinking I wasn't going to be able to review it. Oh how our tastes mature... Poured out to a nice burnt amber color with some cloudiness. Medium low carbonation, with a nice foamy head and some nice lace rings around the glass. Aroma was very acidic, almost like a pine tree and grapefruit had hooked up, and this was the product. Some sweet floral notes and hops in there too. Taste was suprisingly inviting, but still bitter enought to remind one that this is an IPA. Flavors of hops, hops and more hops, and traces of caramel. The hops were nearly overpowering the hints of earth, sweetness and wood that lay low in the complexity, but that may be a desireable aspect for some. Finished rather oily, like a thin layer had been left behind. Good mouthfeel, not over powering or too thick and heavy. I'd drink this again, but I'd like to try some other Founder's offerings before coming back to this. Worth a try."
"Great hop flavor for an IPA. Nice balance with only a hair more than subtle piney-ness. Pours a slightly orange tinged brown. Centimeter thick head laying on top of the beer. Taste is slightly sweet and biscuity at first. Then quickly followed with the hoppy bitters. Lots of dandelions and grass also in the flavor. Mouthfeel is a nice tight body with the flavoring tat just dances across the tongue. Just a bit of heat towards te center before it cools down and the hops ease this beer into pleasant sublmission."
"I really recommend trying this. I love the formula these guys have come up with. Usually I don't like IPAs, but the hop choice in the Founders Centennial just hits the spot for me. Recommended!"
" This is a good IPA, not to drying, not to shake your head bitter, just right. Highly recommended, founders has not let me down yet."
"A dark hazey copper beer. Has a very big eggshell white head with nice lace. There is a sweet fruity hop boquet with a light flowery background in the aroma. The front of the tongue gets treated to a nice nut like sweetness while the back of the tongue gets good balance of bitterness from some grapefruit and spicey hop notes. With some coffee and tea like hints in the finish."
"Pours a cloudy pale amber color with a nice white head. The aroma erupts from to bottle the second it is opened. Fruity, grassy, and hoppy. The taste is rather mellow for an IPA. Still it is nice and hoppy without being bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and juicy. Overall, this a a very wonderful brew."
"Drinkability? Well, this is an IPA and well, I love it, but price/value isn't great, still this is an excellent beer in a sampler and great as a starter before going to darker beers."
"Very drinkable by me!"
"Aroma of fresh hops from the dry hopping. Some caramel malts. Great fresh hop flavors with out strong bitterness. Malts provide a moderately sweet balance. Extremely nice body and dextrinous mouthfeel from start to finish. Warming brings out a little of the well hidden alcohol along with the caramel/ toffee malts that can only come from quality continential barley. Most drinkable approaching greatness. A must try!"
"Drinkability -- Very drinkable. One of my favorite IPA's. Very hoppy yet creamy and not too dry. The hops stand out nicely."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at Riley's in Madison, WI."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer and it also has 7.2 ABV, no complaints there."
"I have heard nothing but good things about this beer. Let me just say that I am not disappointed. Centennial pours a nice amber-copper color with a nice white head. Bubbles ascend nicely throughout the glass. Lace is minimal. The smell is sharp and hoppy. Citrus and floral smells help to complete the boldness of the aroma. The initial nose intake is most impressive. The tase is very hoppy, but well-balanced. Citrus flavors (grapefruit) are evident. There is also a nice, bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full and lowly carbonated. There is a bitterness that remains, but not so sharp as to preclude an overall balance. Overall, this is one of those beers that is smooth enough to be a session brew, but too strong unless you want to get into trouble. It has good flavor, high, but not noticeable, alcohol content and is unbelieveably well balanced. In a way this is a bit dangerous in how easy it it to tip back."
"Could an IPA be too balanced? Great hop flavors, though, and an easy drinker though not a shockingly hopped ale."
"Drinkablility is pretty good on this one, a ver mild and easy drinking IPA for sure."
"Drinkability: This beer does not seem to fit the typical mold of an IPA. With that said, however, it is very easy to drink and a very good beer."
"Here are some specific tasting notes---some of the nicest sweet malt tempered by some really strong hops. Cedar and woody elements present. Very smooth considering the hoppiness. Founders--you guys are the mac !!!"
"Nice golden orange color. Ok carbonation level. Big hop aroma. Quite citrusy. Big hop flavor-quite bitter. A very slight trace of residual sweetness. Good mouthfeel-has a pucker effect going for it. Overall a decent beer. Comes off as a Mad Hatter IPA from New Holland clone though better all around. 45 minutes apart they must be on the same wave length or something. Good effort. Thanks to crjmellor for the sample."
"The medium body leaves a lot of lacing down the glass. Taste is predominantly hops, but the sweet malt backbone comes through just enough to balance things off. A slight underlying taste of orange in the finish. Quite a nice IPA with a very creamy mouthfeel. I'd definitely buy this one again."
"[This was part of the ""Midwest Beer Barge"" trade with TikkiGodxxx - many thanks for giving me the opportunity to taste some fine Midwest Ales!]"
"Overall a decent brew. Not the best IPA I have had but it is a decent one."
"OK, between Devil Dancer and this, these folks have the art of the IPA figured out. Congrats to them for making probably the best balanced brew I've ever tasted. Sometimes balance is boring, but sometimes, there's a beer, well, its the beer for its time and place. It fits right in there."
"Pours an orangish gold in appearance out of the bottle. Smell is wonderful of very piney hops. Head rises two fingers and is very white and pillowy in appearance. First sip reveals a slightly grapefruit hops profile with a very soft water background. This makes the mouthfeel creamy. This makes the second Founder's beer I've found with this creamy mouthfeel. A trademark of theirs perhaps with the local water? A little too bitter to be extremely high in drinkability. A very good beer. Founders is deserving of some good publicity."
"The color is almost amber with a nice head in the glass. The aroma is of an abundance of floral and citrus hops. The taste is lots of upfront bitterness with a nice balance flavor on the way down. Lots of malt sweetness gives this a very balanced taste, even more so than the Founder's Pale Ale. I would say it is medium bodied and the nice texture sweetness really balance out all the hops. I enjoyed this one."
"Pours a deep burnt orange with a fluffy white head that leaves this sheets of lace as it settles,I love in your face hoppy aroma big pine and spruce along with some lemon pith makes the mouth water.Big hoppy piney flavors hit ya right off the bat along with some lemon rind but a nice caramel maltiness really intermingles well with the big piney,citrusy hop.Big and hoppy but extremely well balanced the alcohol is well hidden making it to easy to drink.Very nice."
"This a solid fridge-stocking beer for all ocassions. An excellent amped-up IPA from founders. It pours out a beautiful copper gold with a lacing, sticky, white head. The aroma is packed full of hops. I would assume that they dry-hopped the hell out of this one. The taste is nice a citrusy with strong bitterness, but a nice small malt backbone to balance it out. The finish is very dry and a tad too much. I would like to see what this beer would be like with a different bittering hop. With a pretty decent abv at 7.2, this one is deceptively dangerous, but a great casual beer. Although this is a great one to have in the house, those who are not hop heads may not appreciate or enjoy this selection."
"Had on tap at the Sunset. Copper colored, and faintly cloudy. The pale lemon curd color head left a splash of lace in my glass. There's a dried hay aroma, some low piney notes. Tastewise, I thought the malt was a bit low, and the hops even a bit demure. The aroma does carry through into the finish, which I find a bit grassy. Good mouthfeel. Could I tell it was 7.2? Not sure."
"A quality, quality brew. This is one I go back to often. It's a great example of the American IPA and a treat regardless of style. Cheers to Founders."
"Creamy looking head, hazed from the hops with a tawny hue. Soft hop oil aroma, very fragrant. Clean but pungent citric hop character, warming white pepper alcohol with layers of fruitiness and toasted caramel middle to end. Super drinkable even @ 7.2% abv. This is what American IPAs are all about."
"Poura a cloudy copper color, with a white foamy head. Good retention, and a fair amount of lace on the glass. Big citrusy and spicy hop aroma. Sweetness from the malt goes very well with the spicy, grapefruit flavors of the hops. Good amount of bitterness. Medium body, moderate carbonation. This is a solid IPA. Good drinkability, as the bitterness is not overwhelming."
"Drinkability is good still a nice refreshing IPA one worth trying. Thanks to merlin48 for this sample."
"Pours deep copper color with a thin white head and some sediment floating around inside the glass. Enticing hoppy aroma, high on the citrous. Taste is hoppy, some good citrous, with bitter orange peel. Balanced by a bit of sweet fruit and some caramel, with a noticable buttery flavor. Finish is bittersweet with a hint of alcohol and some spice. Good, easy drinking IPA."
"I had this beer on tap at the Extreme Beer fest, and have had the chance to review it in the bottle. This was my 1st opportunity to review a draft version. It came in a pint glass a hazy dark copper with a thick cream colored head. The nose is hop flower and grapefruit citrus. Taste is all hop. Flower grass, orange grapefruit. Wow is this bitter. No Maly comes through. Just a little sweetness. Very slick mouth feel. Good sheet of lace. On tap, this beer is almost TOO bitter *I cant believe Im typing this. Ill have another, but I think I want protection for my teeth."
"Poured to a 1/4"" head with minimal lacing on the glass. It smells richly hopped and tastes every bit as much too. The malt and the hops are tightly bound in the taste. The flavor reminds me of starfruit. Medium weighted, the mouthfeel is very carbonated. The finish is on the wet-tart side.. better than average."
"Pours dingy copper with a 1 finger head and a smattering of floaters. The aroma is awesome: loads of floral citric hops, a whiff of fruity esters and a faint underlying grassiness. If only it tasted more like the nose. What a major letdown. Gone are the bold hops present in the aroma, leaving only a very weak flavor in comparison. What grassy notes are present in the flavor are overridden by a faint soapy character. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily. I could drink more of this beer if it were my only choice, but in a world of great IPAs I can see no reason to."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a clear amber appearance with a little bit of off white head. Fresh, fruity hop aroma. Some malt up front, but this is definately a hoppy beer. I wouldn't call this balanced. The hops are aromatic floral and fruity hops. Very fresh tasting. Pretty high carbonation leads to tasty hop burps. This is a very solid IPA, but is missing something to be anything more."
"A sticking oily bitterness builds in the palate, calling you out to put out its fire with more elixir. You answer its call, pouring yourself another in the midday sun. By the time the light recedes and the bottles empty, you realize that this is one hell of a beer, assaulting for a session or not."
"Centennial pours a hazy, unfiltered, apricot orange body with a small offwhite head that quickly falls into persistent collar and film with some clingy lace on the glass. Aroma is assertive with hops. Citrusy grapefruit and some mandarin orange, with some resinous pine sap. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and has a mild hops bite. Taste is mostly bitter hops. Grapefruit and pine resin are present all the way into the finish. Vague caramel malt flavors are noted underneath. Finish and aftertaste are bitter pine cone hops. Nice IPA for hopheads, but lacks the balance and flavor of the brewery's rye ales. Another thank you to brewedlyhooked for this Founders hookup."
"Wow, this is good. Pours a light amber, compact head. Slight chill haze in this. I usually get a stickier head out of an IPA, but this is good with me. This has one of the best aromas of an IPA that I've ever had. Sticky, piney, resiny aroma. Wow. Taste is actually balanced a bit. Glad they didn't go too over-the-top. Enough sweetness to balance the malts. Mouthfeel is a bit powdery, could use more thickness, more body, more viscosity. I find this to be a very drinkable IPA. Perhaps a new standard? Definatly my favorite Michigan IPA from the ones I've had."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating available. Pours sort of a dull amber/golden tone, with a slight greenish metalic hue, cloudy, nice tiny bubble head, leaving extensive fine lacing. Nose is musty, funky and hoppy. This is smooth, not over the top IPA, moderatly hopped. Plain and simple a nice drinkable IPA, tastes more like a pale ale actually...fine sessioner."
"This is the beer that opened up my eyes and swept me away from the mundane monotony of mass produced beers. Thinking this was an ""ordinary"" sixer, I proceeded unpretentiously to uncap and poor. First, the color was a pleasantly murky, rich brown thing of beauty. You see, I was completely unfamiliar with any of the finer things in life at this point in mine. Next, a modest head creamed up ( I say modest now after sampling a few ""huge headed beers", but at the time it was quite impressive to me). When I say creamed, that is what it really looked like compared to the bubbly insubstantial foam offered up by some of the less fortunate beers I had encountered up to this point. Now, I know it may seem like I am embellishing a touch, but in fact, this was a spiritual rebirth for me as far as beer drinking is concerned. I remember it vividly and it will always be sacred. The nose was a sensory delight of fruity tones and rich hop aroma. Then the taste...SMACK!...ecstasy. A true revelation to me. I understand now that centennial is a strain of hops, but I didn't know anything about it before this first sip. I am still a newbie to conissuer lingo, but I can say this hopped out to high heaven flavor really flipped my wig. I like me some centennial hops brothers and sisters! ""Kind Beer for goodness sakes!"" The flavor pelts the taste buds and finishes with that nice dry ending and slightly acidic bite that I have come to love. Mouthfeel seems to vary at times, or maybe it is just me becoming sensitized and spoiled by the deliciously textured goodness. Overall, mouthfeel is good everytime and occasionally great depending on frequency of consumption. Taste is always over the top with hoppy, fruity, earthy, bitter, hints of sweetness here and there. Well balanced for a beer of this style (in my newbie opinion of course). I did not know there was a characteristic called ""lace"" when I first drank this beer, but I can now tell you this beer produces a sparse amount compared to some. I personally don't by beer based upon lacing capabilities or massive head production. I mainly look for taste, and this one does it for me. Good lord I am rambling as if it were one of my grandchildren or something. Drinkability is way too good for me. My first encounter (the draining of a six pack) left me absolutely adrift in alcoholic toastiness. Although some may pretend to be civilized in tasting and rating of characteristics, we all know that the alcohol is always in the mix adding magic to the process. I thoroughly enjoy getting intoxicated on this beer! Enough is enough. I love this beer. It was a gateway into a world that has so much to show me. No more suffering with the same old same old. Try it out, especially if you don't normally drink ""microbrews."" It could change your life too."
"Seriously, this is a bad IPA. If you want hoppy from founders look no further than their Black Rye. Also, what's up with making this an all centennial IPA? Why even bother? Bell's has perfected that beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin and its low bitterness makes it very drinkable, almost quaffable. Higher-than-average ABV is not noticeable nor a factor. A little more robust flavor and this would get much higher marks from me. Thanks to trbeer for this sample."
"Not at all what I expected based on other Founders brews in this sample kit: no syrupy malt profile, and the hopping isn't too extreme either. Straight down the middle of the style -- one that I'm completely bored with at the moment."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color with a small head that left a moderate lacing along the side of my glass. The smell is dominated by grapefruits and pine needles. The taste is hoppy up front, tasting of grapefruit, pine sap, lime and lemon rinds. Then some caramel peeks through to balance this baby out. I must say this is one smooth IPA. I could drink these puppies all night long. This is a stellar. I will be coming back to this one. Much thanks to Skidz for this sample."
"Medium in the mouth, modest of carbonation. Balanced in full and delicious all around. Large in flavor, but never overwrought. This is build as a drinker...though a loud one."
"I am very glad I picked up a sixer of this beer...it is one I could get used to having around."
"Overall, a very fine and drinkable IPA. If I could get this regularly, it would be a standard in my fridge."
"Cokes, you're the man. Many thanks."
"I will give up all citrus fruits entirely and will continue to drink fine beers such as this, as I don't think an orange or a grapefruit could hold a stick up to anything like this. Don't think for a second that this beer is over the top from my description, it's completely within the realistic bounds that any IPA should be in For me, this is exactly how an IPA should taste, but I could stand a bit more bitterness and residual hops. A fine IPA by all standards, very, very easy to drink."
"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle on 12-18-04. This poured out a clear amber with about an inch of off white foamy head. Nice lacing was left around the glass for the duration of the beer. Aroma was quite hoppy with citric hops with a soft undertone of sweet malt. Notes of pine were also present. Taste started out a bit sweet with caramel before the expected grapefruity hop rush came into play. This is definitely quite juicy with hops and finishes with a slightly bitter sweet hop bite. Mouthfeel was on par for the style with a solid medium body and a smooth feel. This is definitely drinkable. With a good balance of malt while style letting the hops come through and take stage I could drink this all night. Thanks to tikkigodxxx for the chance to try this."
"May be I got a bottle past its prime, but there is no way to tell due to the lack of any dates."
"To The Bottom!"
"A nice American style IPA."
"This is a great beer. One of the best I have had from Founders."
"This is a robust, hoppy American IPA. It pours a murky gold with an orange tinting topped with a medium tan head. The hops and citrus notes are immediately evident to the nose, and that characteristic grapefruit flavor (see other IPA: Stone, Smuttynose, and Dogfish Head) underlies the initial sweet taste. There's more carbonation that I like, and I was surprised that the alcohol content was so high--I never notice any intrusive alcohol flavor."
"I would love to try this beer on tap. The over carbonation is killing me as I can't even pour the entire beer. Truth be told, I really like this beer. You will to if you like big, sweet IPA's."
"this is a good solid IPA by a brewery whose products i enjoy. i've gotten 6 packs of a this a couple times, and recommend it to anyone who likes IPAs."
"12oz Bottle No Date This IPA poured a cloudy orange like colored body with a thick dense head. Big centennial hop aroma and a doughy yeast like note underneath. Flavor is bitter and sharply so with hops giving a floral and slightly citrus flavor as well. Malt is there providing some balance. Body is well rounded smooth and not too thin. This is one decent IPA and would make a great session beer if not for the 7.2% abv which by the way is felt but undetected in flavor. Lacing retains well."
"Wyll-"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 1/2"" off-white head above a quite cloudy orangey-amber brew. Head lasts, and laces well. Aroma is initially of citrus, but quickly gives way to some piney hops character. As in the nose, the taste has citrus and hops fighting for dominance, with the hops winning out in the end, but oh, what a flavor that is formed by their competition. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. Not sure if this is really the best IPA I've had, but it sure feels like it right now..."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy deep red-orange color with two fingers of head. There is a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of citrusy hops. Grapefruit and orange fill the nose. Mmm, hops! The taste starts with a good malt base, just a little sweet. Hops dominate the finish. A very citrusy blast of flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is very good as well. A job well done on this one Founders!"
"Mmmm....found this as a single in my favorite store in Massachusetts. If this represent Midwestern brew...send more please. Color was a hazy copper with a nice head that dissipated into excellent lacing. Smell was citrusy and yeasty...just what I love in an IPA. Taste was tart with grapefruit notes. Mouthfeel was nicely dry with a great bitter finish. Perhaps a bit too hoppy, but as a hophead, it rates high in my book. Good on the drinkability scale...easy to have another."
"A big U.P. thanks goes to trbeer for the many samples."
"This zippy little IPA is the color of a middle aged penny if you could get that penny to shine without getting lighter. There's a faint sediment haze, but it's relatively clear. The head is a sturdy one. Pine and citrus zest hops on the nose and a nicely malty body almost balances out the lingering bitter finish."
"Poured a golden orange amber color with a thin layer creamy white foam topping this brew off. Only slightly hazy, but bright and clean overall. As I am a hop aroma freak, the aroma here is very appealing to me with hints of all sorts of goodies including sweet apple cider, pine, sour fruits, yeast, and even a hint of caramel and chocolates. The taste is lightly sweet from the malt and flavorful with a soft bitterness that tickles the tongue. Theres a decent body of fruity sweet malts and has a sticky bittersweet finish that coats the tongue and stays with you for a while. Very nice overall. Thanks to Tikkigodxxx for this one."
"Drinkability - a great session beer, I could make an evening of these."
"Amazing stuff this is. One of the finest IPA's I've ever had. Up there with Two-Hearted and Hop Devil. Just a little rough around the edges keeps it from getting some 5.0's."
"Thank you to trbeer for sending this gem. A fantastic IPA, with a good citrus hop and a better balance. Up amongst the better IPAs out there, and certainly one I'll have again."
"Hoppy brew. Thats it. Copper color with a meagre whit head that dissapears quickly. Aroma is grapefruit and pine hops. Flavor is...guess what...hops. There is a malt base that gives little flavor, but keeps the bitterness within bounds. The hops provide a great deal of flavor without going overboard with the bitterness. Very well done. A one trick pony, but a good one."
"Overall, this is an above average IPA, I'm not sure i like all the citrus flavor, but this is a decent beer. I would have another."
"Medium bodied, zesty, medium-length finish, hangs well and firmly in the mouth. Nice rendition of the style, one I would enjoy again and again, if this were an option!"
"The Centennial IPA pours a nicely carbonated reddish gold, with a mild head. Not suprisingly, it smells like hops, nice flowery mild hops. That is pretty much how it tastes too, a bit more flowery than some. Comes with typical IPA cheek pucker and oily mouthfeel. It is as easy to drink as any other IPA, and may get another chance. Too many other IPAs still to try before this one's number gets called again though."
"Medium body with a refreshing, prickly carbonation. A solid offering from a brewery that seems to be a real up and comer."
"Centennial IPA is another solid effort from Founders. I really like Pale Ale and this beer delivers more of what was good about that beer (hops!). I love to find great beer from breweries that I previously didn't know existed. And I have deejaydan to thank for it."
"Update – It’s been over six years since OldFroth sent me my first bottle of this beauty and I ran into it at a beverage barn in Ohio so thought I’d give it another whirl. It’s as gorgeous and smooth as I remember it with an amazing texture and a wonderful sense of buttery malt/hop fusion."
"Very deep golden, almost copper in color with a good creamy, sticky head that leaves a good patchwork of lace. Extremely Humbolt county like in the nose with loads of sticky green bud aromas. Full bodied, and assertively hoppy, this aint a bad IPA. Very smooth and round in the mouth. This beer is all about hops, hops, and more.... bitter hops. A certain hit for the hophead."
"This was quite a nice IPA. Definitely not like the overdone IPA's that have been appearing everywhere. This one is more for the non hop head beer lovers. It poured a golden amber with a nice creamy head. The smell was strong in hops but the flavor wasn't near as strong. The hops were there but they didn't blow my palate away. Really citrusy and grapefruity with maybe a little floral hoppiness too. The base was bready but weak and the malts were very weak, I couldn't really discern a malt flavor. The yeast was real noticeable and mixed well with the hops. Goes down easy. Very good."
"A thoroughly impressive midwestern IPA. This little goodie came looking for a fight with its moody and cloudy rusty amber body and luscious creamy tan head that is stubborn and laces with incredibly thick deposits that create sticky rings. The body is full of particles and floaties that surely portend of the yeast that is a part of the great aroma. The nose is full of yeast and citrus hops at the start, but equally strong on the lovely malt base. The flavor is just great, with thick sweet malts and lovely bittering following from the heavy hopping. Much less citrus hopping on the flavor than in the aroma. The good mouthfeel is fairly full and chewy, and finishes with a nice creamy ending. Depending on the ABV this has good drinkability, but I sense a fairly strong alcohol content."
"Drinkability: An easy-drinking IPA. More of a Pale Ale IMO, since the hops are not overpowering. Not what I expected, and I doubt I will try again."
"Big thanks to TwelveVoltMan for providing the sample."
"A big BA thanks to TwelveVoltMan for this one."
"12 oz. short bottle with a twist off cap, pours a cloudy dark amber-orange color with alot of yeast chunks floating around, nice off-white head that leaves a creamy a lace in the glass. It has fresh citrusy aromas, medium body with a full mouthfeel, nice grapefruit and caramel flavors with a decent bite in the end, I think I will have another."
"Yet another fine brew from this Grand Rapids brewer. This Centennial puored a slight hazy-cloud of copper with an outstanding off-white head. Good head retention and lots of lace, ring after ring. The aroma is bold, hoppy with hints of citrus. The taste has a ""jump at you"" centennial hop bang, followed by a good rounding dose of citrus ( both grapefruit & lemon ). At the finish a balance of sweet malt can be noticed as the mouth is left with a mild but smooth bitterness. A fine ale to be had, Good-job!"
"Pours an orange color with a white head, excellent hop aroma, and a very good hopiness to the favor too. Maybe a little thin on the body, but otherwise a very drinkable beer. I would recommend this to anybody who likes hoppy pale ales. I really think this stuff is a little bit underrated."
"Oh-oh, screw top, bad omen! This pours opaque burnt amber with a thin white head. It has a slight hoppy aroma. The taste is more grapefruit than hops. This was a disappointing beer."
"Big hop flavors from the start, but not enough malt to support it for my palate. Touch hollow in the mid-palate initially, but this fills in. Lovely bottle-conditioned mouthfeel, and a long bitter finish. Add a bit more malt to support it and it would be great. As it is, its still very good."
"This beer is actually called Centennial IPA unless they have two versions. This beer poured a very cloudy reddish gold color and formed an off white foamy head that left some circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation and sediment is present. A nice aroma of hops and citrus. A flavor of hops, citrus and caramel. A slightly bitter yet creamy finish to the beer. Not a bad IPA. Not as over the top as Two Hearted or others, but a nicely balanced IPA."
"I consider the pros and cons of twist caps as I pour the fumy amber fluid down the side of my tilted pint glass watching the pale head puff aggressively then fade. The glass is cool and moist in my hand. I stroke my lips in hunger as the aroma of lemon drops and crouton topped butterleaf lettuce grasps me, it's full. Full and round and toasty like stoned wheat crackers and lingering bitter-sweet olive tapenade. And it's gone. Where's that bottle opener?"
"A big beer. I am a fan of IPA's and readily admit at present, it is my favorite style. This IPA is loaded with Centennial hops (it is called ""Centennial IPA""). Pours out to a good-looking amber in the glass with a light brown head. Aroma is that of grapefruit, as an IPA should be. The taste is very balanced despite the heavy kick of hops. The malt keeps this from being over the top. A very good example of the IPA style. I'll drink this one again."
"Founders IPA:  A huge American IPA, aggressive hops dominate this brew.  Rust/caramel colored, with a slim off-white head.  Hops to the left, hops to the right, hops right down the damn middle.  Not much balance here, but this is a brew that will really please you hop heads.  Mouthfeel was pleasant, but with a little hops oils at the end. Very well made IPA, so big it gave me heartburn."
"This powerful IPA is on a list of great Michigan pale ales.  Nice deep golden color and a strong depth of hop flavor support a light sweet finish.  Nice."
