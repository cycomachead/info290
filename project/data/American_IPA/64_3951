Shares a similar flavor profile with DFH 60 and 90 Minute IPA, but with enough sweetness to round the edges off and make it extremely drinkable.  I wouldn't have probably called apricot if I hadn't known, but it's a good fit; there's a definite fruity hop flavor but its not overpowering.  There are many IPAs where the hops alone are more citrus tasting than this, but this is a perfect balance.  Looks and smells great as well.  Another amazing beer from one of the truly best, most original breweries in a crowded field.","milwaukee512","Apr 03, 2015"

I was a little disappointed by the smell but the overall feel and taste of this beer more than makes up for it.  I would definitely buy this again.  This is a unique beer that I had high expectations for especially since I like apricots and like most of Dogfish Head's offerings.  I would not necessarily consider this an IPA so much as a pale ale with the lacking hops I've come to expect with an IPA.  (I could be biased expecting something closer to a double IPA but who know.)  I know this is listed as a seasonal offering but when/if you find this I would recommend giving it a shot.  I would love to try this fresh out of a keg!!!","upton7418","Mar 25, 2015"

Taste is initially sweet malt but turns to citrus peel hoppy bitterness and closes with apricot flesh on the swallow. Medium body, moderate carbonation, texture is on the slick side, fruity dry finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 23, 2015"

Smells of citrus hops, slight sweet malt, hint of alcohol, hint of pine, and a hint of citrus.  Fits the style of an American IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of citrus, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight pine, and slight hops.  Overall, weak appearance, simple aroma, simple body, and hard to distinguish any apricots.","Tone","Aug 25, 2014"

Different styles, for sure, but also a completely different paradigm. Dogfish Head has created a brew that combines fruit beer and IPA into a beautiful harmony. If you know someone who's a little weak-hearted and not a bit IPA fan, this is the kind of brew that could broaden their horizons.","logicalparadox","Aug 09, 2014"

The flavor is hoppy and bitter with some citrus flavor. It tastes very much like a regular IPA but with the addition of some slightly bitter juice. The mouthfeel leans towards syrupy and thick. Overall, this is a good IPA but its not great. I prefer 60 minute to this, but wouldn't turn one down if it was given to me.","thegodfather2701","May 12, 2014"

The aroma was full of citrus and tropical fruit hops which was directly in IPA territory. I detected a slight hint of Apricot but it could have been my mind telling me I should as it was almost imperceptible. The taste was an excellent ride that began with the citrus and tropical fruit hops that melded into sweet apricot and ended with a palate coating bitter pine finish. The sweet apricot expressed itself more as it warmed and help tame the bitter pine finish. Although I was expecting more apricot flavor, the Aprihop stayed true to an IPA with plenty of hop punch, which was a good thing.","brurevu","Apr 29, 2014"

The low IBU and apricot flavor come together to make this an altogether refreshing and quite tasty beer which has just the right amount of hop flavor that is complemented by the fruit. It also looks pretty damn good. Having had it as part of a tasting at a Total Wine (from a bottle) and on tap at a Dogfish Head restaurant, I can say that this is definitely one of the standouts of theirs that I have had.","MaddestHatter","Apr 28, 2014"

The ale pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a long lasting Off white head and lacing. The nose is the typical dfh blend of citrus and pine hops plus the addition of fresh spring apricots. The mouthfeel is sticky and pleasant coating the palate with an abundance of fresh flavors. The flavor is subtler than the nose in regards to the apricot presence. It is still present but far behind the hops and the malt. This is another great variation on such an overused style, but refreshingly different from a brewery that is almost always refreshingly different.","lochef81","Apr 22, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops, apricot, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of grapefruit, apricot, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, apricot, orange peel, lemon zest, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance of citrus hops, apricot, and moderate malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop, apricot, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 05, 2014"

The malt whispers a bit of sugar in your ear and a soft bit of bread. Taste is juicy and sweet. It's a very sweet malt that gives a wonderful medium full mouthfeel. The beer is sticky and leaves behind a bit of that apricot to linger in the aftertaste. I want to say that I also taste some orange and some orange peel. The bitter is well done in this. It's just enough to leave you with a nice IPA feeling from this decadently fruity beer.","utopiajane","Mar 23, 2014"

The mouthfeel was a little weak compared to some of their year-round brews and the flavors are nice, but just not exactly my cup o'tea.

I need a new approach but back to the beer. I look forward to the release of this beer every year I was fortunate enough to have experienced this run with randall off the tap and it was phenomenal. Not too fruity an IPA lover wouldn't like it but not too hoppy a fruit beer lover wouldn't want it again. Quite a treat from dogfish.","Cozuma","Mar 20, 2014"

The taste of this beer is pretty much what I expected, even if I do find it to be a touch TOO sweet, though the mouthfeel is excellent. The apricots aren't overwhelming, and the grassy/earthy/piney hops work with it very nicely. This is a very good seasonal.","Alextricity","May 27, 2013"

3.88,1.3,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"Oh Dogfish Head...maybe you are cursed with fans setting the bar to high. So many special beers, some of which I've loved and others not, but all were drank with an appreciation of what you were trying to accomplish. Aprihop? Its a good beer, dont' get me wrong. If someone handed it to me in a blind taste test, I'd say it was a damn fine beer. Beautiful color actually, which certainly must come from the apricots. As an IPA or as a fruit beer, however, it fell a bit short on both accounts for me. Based on how you typically do business, I'd guess you used a ton of real apricot for this brew. Unfortunately, it doesn't really come through. As an IPA, the great qualities of our other IPAs don't come through either. It's kinda both, but neither. As a whole, it is a good but undescript mash where the fruit and hops cancel each other out rather than building to something special, although there is a very nice mouthfeel.","captaincoffee","May 03, 2013"

The smell actually hits you with hops right out of the gate then apricots appear too. Te taste is way better than I was expecting. I guess cause this really is a true craft that hits you with a nice malty hoppy taste then follows with a hint of apricot. They did not go overboard with the fruit which is the key to the success of this beer. It's a great summer refreshing beer that I'll have from time to time on some nice hot days.

3.74,-2.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"not as hoppy as its billed, but a nice fruit beer that's not an immediate write off for me. the pour is a nice brassy color with an orange tint, and a finger or two of fading white head. the nose is hoppy, but its more oily and sweet than bitter, more like a 90 minute than a 60, if you follow. the fruit doesn't manifest itself too boldly in the nose, maybe a little jammy sweetness, but in the taste they really come out. its almost like they take the place of the sweetness that usually comes from the malt, its juicy and a little tart too. then the hops kick in, robust and fresh, and give this beer a particular crispness hard to find in fruit beers. overall this leans more toward an ipa than a fruit beer, which makes it a winner for me, but its not as well refined as some of the other dogfish brews. could also stand a little more carbonation to brighten up the feel, it comes across a little heavy to me. still, an interesting and delicious beer that's just right in early spring. drink this cold though, it gets weird as it warms.","StonedTrippin","Mar 31, 2013"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I first must comment on the well apricot nature of the brew- the color reminds me of apricots, however I suppose many IPAs do. As far as the smell is concerned, the apricots are not overbearing at all, rather the apricots and hops blend nicely for a damn good nose job. I would consider the hops to be citrusy, but more mild as compared to some other IPAs. The taste is remarkably similar to the smell, more or less perfectly balanced citrusy hop profile and a smooth apricot flavor. I would not at all consider this to be a ""fruity"" beer like some others I have tried (UFO raspberry or a blue moon orange- nasty shit)- it certainly retains its IPA qualities with citrusy hops however not too bitter on the whole (but I think the bitterness is perfect for balancing out the sweet apricot). The apricot is well incorporated and doesnt take away from the IPA qualities. The malty character did add some sweetness, but not to the point of taking away from the hops characteristics. I cant say I noticed much of a boozy taste what so ever although the ABV clocks in at 7%. On the whole the apricot is there to back up the hops not the other way around and for this reason I would certainly pick up this brew again even though I generally always prefer my IPAs in true form.","80x2HopHead","Mar 21, 2013"

2.91,-24,3,3.75,2.5,2.75,2.75,"Hmm... I gotta say right off the bat this is a dissapointment, BUT, I find it hard to blame on Dogfish Head. They try some wacky stuff, and it's simply the odds that they aren't all going to be home runs. Pours clear, medium high carbonation. Smell is pretty good, and the apricot really compliments the piney hops. If only the flavor could have matched... Taste is reminiscent of the 60 minute IPA but surprisingly small amounts of apricot flavor. Light to medium bodied. Here's how I feel about it: If your're going to do something off the norm like making an Apricot American IPA, then go for it full bore with all aspects of the beer. Dogfish Head knows how to do this and they have pulled off some bizzare combinations on multiple occasions. People are going to buying ""APRIHOP"" because they are wanting something different and unique and are expecting APRICOTS and HOPS. Don't be subtle with crazy brews.","Samuel906","Mar 04, 2013"

The apricot addition does add a bit of a twist to an other wise ordinary beer. I usually drink a few of these as spring/summer rolls around every year. It's a nice sessionable beer and As far as I can remember, this is the first DFH beer I ever tried.","nimrod979","Jul 03, 2012"

Too many times, I have encountered an IPA that is very one note in the hop department and there is not malt complexity to bring a unique experience into play. Aprihop is an exciting beer. Fleshy fruit notes mixed with some more traditional citrus flavors and a good malt backbone. Simple, yet enjoyable. A perfect hot weather beer.","Sam21","Jul 01, 2012"

Opens with some grassy hops transitions to lightly sweet malt then apricots and a touch of pine and bitterness that is quickly balanced by slightly sweet malt. The mouthfeel of this beer is remarkable. Creamy, smooth, and refreshing. Aprihop is exceptionally balanced, never too sweet, never too bitter, just the right amount of apricot flavor, and exceptional mouthfeel. Highly recommended!","chanokokoro","Apr 08, 2012"

3.65,-4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I though that this was an ok beer and a slightly above average American IPA. It had all the aspects of a American IPA, but it didn't have that extra wow factor to make it live up it's name as Aprihop. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down very smooth, but I think the thickness would start to get to me after one or two, but it seems like a glass of this would be nice on a hot day. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and were the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the body and that all those great things that I liked about the aroma were pretty toned down when it got to the taste, if it was a little lighter and had a more assertive apricot taste this would bee a great beer. I don't think I would buy this again mainly because it is pretty expensive for what you get, but I still recommend giving it a try to an IPA fan. In the end if that taste matched the aroma, was lighter bodied, and had more apricot flavor it would be a pretty good beer, but as it stands now it's just slightly above average, I guess I was expecting to get more assertive flavors that can be found in most other Dogfish Head beers, a descent beer, but it failed to really impress me, not every beer can be a work of art.","StoutHunter","Mar 21, 2012"

Adding fruit to beer isn't always a good thing, but they have successfully kept this beer an IPA at its heart and used the apricot as a compliment. The complex blend of tropical fruits, citrus, and bitter flowery hops work well. The only negative I could find is that the malt may make it a bit chewy and give it a slightly bready character. However, it is one of my favorite DFH beers and I look forward to it appearing on the shelves each March. I wish this was around through the summer because it is a great warm weather beer.","NoLeafClover44","Mar 12, 2012"

3.6,-6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, orange-copper coloring with a slight filmy covering on the surface. Aromas are light and subtle, with a strong balance of wet hops and spices along with the fruit sweetness. Flavors are smooth to start, with a transition towards a sharper feel from the carbonation and light body. Subtle apricot sweetness builds the backbone to support the green, wet, spicy hops character. The spicing of pepper and basil clean the palate for a short-lived, mildly sweet aftertaste. Clean finish, allowing the tastebuds to recover in between sips. Very easy to drink, and the lighter flavorings would make for a good summer beer.","GarthDanielson","Mar 11, 2012"

Bitter hops are the most noticeable taste. There is also a certain sweetness from the apricot that helps balance the bitterness. Has a nice after taste and texture to it.

This is the first apricot IPA I've had, and it's a winner through and through. The apricot doesn't dominate the scene here, and that's refreshing for a fruit inspired beer. The apricot has a fabulous smell, then disappears until after you've swallowed...allowing the hops to make their presence known. I wish this was available year round.

The hop bouquet is instead tropically fruity with light cannabis notes atop a slightly sweet malt. The flavor reinforces the suggestions of the nose. Initial impressions are of light sugar cookie malt, fruity dank cannabis, and a slight spiciness, and it really doesn't show apricot until the very finish.

Perhaps hops have faded, don't know what the date code stands for, (6A- June?).

The hoppy flavor is neither over- nor under-whelming. It's a bit stronger than a 60 minutes, a bit weaker than a 90 minute. The Apricot flavor doesn't really shine through until the after taste (though my bottle was a bit warm when I drank it). This final apricot-y flavor does give the beer a bit more personality (in a good way) than your average IPA, but like I said, it's not anything ground breaking. It's worth picking up simply because Dogfish always has something interesting to offer.","Interfectus","Jun 10, 2011"

A bit oily and viscous at the front end, assertive carbonation through the middle, and a resinous feel at the finish.

The smell is a strong hop aroma, very dominant. Cascade is the dominant hop in the flavor with other pine-y and citrus flavors blended in. It's got a dry malt taste, like something English, but balances the hops nonetheless. The apricot is a small note on the palate and nasal passage after the beer has gone down, and is very subtle. A great bodied beer with a little booziness mingled in there for good measure. Great beer, particularly refreshing to have one bedside after sex.","wcintula","May 07, 2011"

The one finger head slowly dissipates to a ring in my glass with a patch of film in the middle shaped like Antarctica. Smell Izmir apricots, it's a nice light citrus smell, not overpowering, but enticing. Taste starts with a slight bitterness them you get the apricot and citrus sweetness, toasted the ending there are some subtle malts present, they are the unsung heroes of this beer, then before the palate clears there is a residual bitterness. As this beer warms the apricots become more present in the taste. The mouthfeel is great for a citrus IPA, the carbonation is visible and I can feel a slight presence on my tongue as I drink this. As somebody who appreciates west coast citrus hop bombs, I really appreciate this beer. It has a cool balance between hops and subtle malt. The apricot flavor also adds some citrus flavor. If this were more readily available and cheaper here on the west coast, I'd buy this quite often.","gkunkle","May 05, 2011"

3.08,-19.6,4,3.5,3,2,3,"Aprihop pours a surprisingly dark amber, as dark if not darker than any other IPA I've ever had. The slightly off white head comes right to the top of the glass, passing three fingers in height. Head retention is above average, and gobs of lacing are left around the glass. The nose is a bit more citrus centric than the 90 Minute IPA I had last night, but pine is still present as well. There's also a little bit of caramel sweetness present, and just a touch of apricot. The aroma is a bit weak though. Aprihop's flavor just doesn't quite pass muster. The caramel malt flourish upfront is way too pronounced, and after a brief cutting bitterness an entirely too tame citrus and apricot finish. Not nearly enough hop flavor to justify calling it an IPA. This may in part be due to an entirely lackluster carbonation. The bubbles just seem to die halfway through each sip, before they can help bring out the hops. As a result the body comes across as way too heavy, and everything here's just out of whack for an IPA. I probably enjoyed Aprihop a little bit more than the score indicates as just a beer, but for being billed as an IPA with apricot it just falls short.","axeman9182","Apr 16, 2011"

I was expecting something overly peachy and fruity, but this beer is so much better. There is some mild apricot on the nose, mixed with hops. The taste is a very smooth IPA, with a great balance of bitterness, citrus hops, and a mild apricot aftertaste. I am picking up a little more apricot flavor as it warms, but the bitter bite and good carbonation are keeping this from being a sweet, syrupy beer. I had no problem blowing through this beer and could have another. It is medium bodied and fairly refreshing.","beerdown77","Apr 07, 2011"
2.93,-23.5,2.5,4.5,2.5,2,2.5,"O: Overall I would say that it's a bit below average. It seems to be unbalanced in favor of hops (even for an IPA) and the alcohol flavor needs to be under control. I've had other standard IPAs that are better, and really the apricot doesn't stand out as much as I'd expect. I give it a 2.5 here because it's not as good as the average IPA (even from DFH) but it's better than a 2.0. I wouldn't drink it again given the opportunity.","teromous","Apr 07, 2011"

This is most definitely an IPA from the great hoppy aroma it gives off. The flavors it gives off are quite good too, Big time hops mixed with a wonderful hint of Apricot. It's a really nice combo here. The bitterness of the hops go really well with the slight tartness of the Apricots. Also the Sweetness in the beer compliments the sweetness of the fruit. I feel that this beer is really nice when on tap. The really good flavors it has kind of disappear once it's bottled. Not sure why, but if you see it on tap, try it!","Knapp85","Apr 02, 2011"

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'm not a fan of IPAs but I think Dogfish Head does a very good job with this one. Most beers that mix in fruit with their beer have the fruit dominate the palate but end up either ignoring the rest or just going crazy (I'm looking at you Wild Berry Lager.). Aprihop manages to mix the two without either problem. The only minor complaint is that the fruit taste more like generic fruit rather than Apricot but that's minor detail in my opinion. Too bad it's just a seasonal. I'd love to have a cold one of these during the summer.","HattedClassic","Mar 30, 2011"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A delicious beer, I just wish it was amped up a bit more with apricot flavor. Apricot is a welcome addition to the citrus hop profile and I wish DFH went further with it. Altogether though, a very good beer.","ehammond1","Mar 29, 2011"
3.97,3.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"o: Not your typical IPA, but the apricots make it unique while not making it into a fruit beer. The combination of hops and the apricot are blended well. Signs of spring are upon us and this beer matches the season well.","Shumania","Mar 29, 2011"
3.92,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is quite slick with hop resin coating your palate along with a decent amount of apricot. Finish is sweet, almost too sweet.

Carbonation of this beer is perfect. It leaves a generous amount of lacing. The taste....the very first thing that I notice is that it reminds me a lot of a beer I had and reviewed the other day...Magic Hat #9. Only BETTER! This beer has a lot of hop bitterness and a nice apricot flavor. It's Magic Hat on ROIDS.

Taste is bitter citrus hops and pine, along with some stone fruit, (cant really pick it out to be apricots) as well as some sweet malt and alcohol - not hot just noticeable. Finish is somewhat nice yet astrigent. Not a bad beer but drinking it after a red and white which i love.

3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It was a deep copper color with a thick, filmy, buttermilk colored head that clung to the glass. The smell is mainly apricot with a faint hint of citrusy hops. Overall the smell is mostly tropical. The beer bites at the back of the tongue, there are some sour, lemony flavors then the sweet apricot takes over and there is a bitter, resinous aftertaste. It feels pretty light, the carbonation really attacks the mouth but it has a pleasant finish. This is by far the best fruit beer I've ever had (unless you count Ommegang Three Philosophers) I thought the apricot went well with the other hop flavors.","JMad","Mar 16, 2011"

Not nearly as much malt as Dogfish Head is known for in their IPAs...which suits my mood nice right now. There are lovely pine notes as well as hints of citrus and apricot...not nearly as much apricot as I remember last year. Mouthfeel is rather creamy and crisp at the same time.

Very clean look to this one. decent hop aroma, but also getting a bit of malt presence. no real fruit or apricot presence in the smell. however, upon tasting, the apricot does come through. although they don't clash, the fruit and hops don't seem to ""blend"" together entirely and it's as if someone poured an IPA into my #9.

I thought the taste was very mild and would rather stick with a solid IPA or IIPA instead of a fruity limited release like this.

3.98,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured from the tap a nice coppery amber color with a tight off white head that left some spoty lacing through the beer. Smell is hop forward, citrus and floral hop notes with a hint of sweet malt, and maybe a bit of apricot in the background. Taste is like a normal American IPA good floral citrus hop profile with a nice sweet malt backbone with just enough apricot in the middle to let you know why they call it aprihop. Mouthfeel is nice and balanced not to heavy or syrupy good balance of carbonation to bring forward the cirtus hop. Drinkability is great on this beer, very nice beer when the weather warms and you want a nice citrus/floral IPA not to dry or sweet good balance.","rpardon7","Mar 10, 2011"

Very fresh tasting with a nice hop profile. Light bodied mouthfeel. Overall this is a wicked spring seasonal beer that Dogfish Head does so well, one of the reasons they're one of my top breweries.

I'm always sad when spring brings the new season boring wheat beers and lagers for the hot east TN summer to come, so I was excited about a real beer ment for spring/summer drinking. Apperance- nice color, head, seemed thin enough for hot weather. Really wish it was bottle conditioned. Aroma- lots of US hops. Can't discern the real fruit from the hop ""fruit"". A little yummy bread and malt underneath. Taste- real hard to taste the apricot, so overwhelmmed buy hops. Oh wait there it is in the aftertaste. Right after you taste the bready toasty malt there is the apricot. Not to much bitterness. Mouthfeel- as expected full enough to feel, light enough to enjoy on a picnic. Drinkable- quite yes.

The aroma is of just what the name implies, hops and apricots, along with some caramelized malts. The tart flavor of apricots hits hard up front followed by a quick burst of hops bitterness. The two together seem rather harsh. There's a hearty malt character and a touch of caramel sweetness, but they're not enough to provide the balance that is sorely needed in this beer; although it does get a little better as it warms. The after-taste is bitter. Crisp but not too smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean. It's flavorful but I didn't find it too tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, Unlike many fruit beers, this one doesn't use the fruit flavor to try covering up the fact that it is still a beer, but this is definitely not a beer that I would want to drink again.","Anthony1","Aug 09, 2010"

This bottle was clearly stamped with 2-19-10 so it is my own fault that this was clearly past its time. While some beers will keep, this one clearly does not, without a toll. My review will thus be based some on my memory of FRESH Aprilhop. Beer pours a dark hazy amber. One-finger head settles quickly to a white coating which remains until the end. Nose is earthy hops and fruit, some grapefruit-like and some which may indeed be apricot-like. Medium body and carbonation is evident but not heavy. Taste starts as an IPA might, but the malt backbone and sweet apricot-like fruits balance this pretty well. There is some movement to dry and bitter finish but never overly so.

Aroma is dominated by citrus notes and apricot; there's a touch of pine accompanied by caramel malt sweetness, too. Taste is tropical fruit hop-like and apricot - it's a nice blend of flavors. There's also a smidge of pine resin accompanied by a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel seems a little oily, yet at the same time, a little thin. Drinkability is up there - this is refreshing stuff... hopefully it'll still be around in the summer.","jpro","May 12, 2010"

I saw Sam Caligione's (sp??) video where he said for a while DFH let the apricots come through too much in this one and they've recently reigned it in to get back to a real deal American IPA with apricots used for a unique touch. Seems like they're heading back that way, and I actually think the apricots could be scaled back even more and would still show their character and make this a remarkable IPA. As is it is definitely good and derfinitely unique.","EStreet20","May 12, 2010"

It seems to have more citrus and pine hops than apricot, but the apricot is definitely still present. The combination of hops and fruit gives it a really nice floral flavor. Bitterness is impressive, but not overbearing. A lot more malt presence can be picked up in the taste, and it is a very toasty malt character at that.

It has some aspects that suggest a great IPA, but it doesn't really get there for me. If I try this again fresh and it blows my mind, I'll rereview.

Tiny bubbles of a less than white head fades quickly into a resilient cap. The aromas from Aprihop are dominant IPA. That being said the faint existence of a light fruity apricot slide through almost undetected. The prior knowledge of their presence may be the only reason I can pick them out. Citric grapefruit, orange and a smidgen of lemon take the main stage. Very dry in the nose with very little grain in the aroma, uncharacteristic of a Dogfish IPA. The first taste hits the tongue with a balanced hop bitterness and sweetness from malt and fruit. The dry and hoppy ale leave very little aftertaste. The bitterness is easily over come my the carbonation and apricot. I believe I can pick out some bread, caramel and yeasty blends that quickly fade. The ale was built for warm weather drinking and I find it to be refreshing for the hot spring days. Aprihop has inspired me to hop a Hefe blended with apricot. I will be writing the recipe for it with another Aprihop in hand.","llllDrGONZOllll","May 04, 2010"

3.23,-15.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a nice deep red color - nice and clear, you can tell there's fruit involved because no grain gets this color - hues of purple even. The head is huge and white, about 1 inch high, and leaves alright lacing. Looks good. The smell is nice, mostly fruit, the apricot - also some berry notes, like raspberries, but not a lot of hop. Actually, I'd venture to say that I don't really have an easy time smelling hops at all. Still, I guess it more or less smells like what it has in it. The taste is primarily sweet fruitiness mixed in with bitterness. It's really hard to detect anything else. I mean, the fruit is nice, but the bitterness sort of makes it unpleasant. You don't know which you prefer, and you end up wanting to ignore one or the other. Almost no hop flavor to speak of, maybe some tart lemony hops, maybe some leafiness, but you'd be stretching out the taste buds to find it. It also has the soda-y taste that fruit beers often have. The body is nice and medium, with decent lively carbonation. Not bad. Overall, a decent beer, but honestly, I would almost rather see a fruit beer alone, or an IPA alone. I don't think the bitterness and fruitiness complement each other well at all - for the most part, tasting bitter and fruit (other than citrus fruit really) together means that it's not quite ripe yet, and this brings to mind that very feeling you get when you bite into an underripe fleshy fruit.

Hard pour produces burnt orange with an off white 1"" head. There is a fair amount of lacing remaining along with some thick carbonation bubbles resting on the top. From my wide duvel snifter, I detect sweeet toffee, light malt and a sugary fruity hop presence. I would not have known this was apricot, but some fruit apparent. This tastes very smooth, sweet and mellow up front with a medium heavy slightly silky mouthfeel. The bitter hops and alcohol are both pronounced in the finish.

It has this odd aftertaste that reminds me a bit of drinking a Bud Lime, or the taste of sweet tarts candy. Anyway Kudos to Dogfish for giving it a whirl.

This beer has a very unique smell that I'm having trouble placing, but the apricot isn't overpowering, which is a plus. The uniqueness continues upon tasting. There is a hit of bitterness quickly followed by sweetness, no doubt from the apricot and then the two tastes mix in your mouth. The body is a bit thin and watery the sweetness wins out in the finish. This is an interesting take on an IPA with a unique play on flavor, but I don't really care for it.

Taste is very similar to the smell, starts very yeasty and doughy, with the not very sweet apricot flavor following with a hop finish followed with a hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, refreshing and perfect for the summer. This one is very drinkable, but disappointing in the hop department, not IPA material.

Medium bodied, the beer is very well carbonated, even a bit more than I would have expected. Taste is pretty bittersweet with apricot up front, almost a bit tart. The fruit comes through very strongly but the character of the beer hasn't been lost. It is a bit tough to tell that this is an IPA at heart, but the bitterness is there in the finish. With that said, I think I would lean toward categorizing this more as a hefty fruit beer than an American IPA. This beer is very easy to drink especially for a fairly high alcohol content, although I think I'll definitely need to be in the mood for it.

The hops seem rather subdued for an IPA and the apricot flavor is not at all overpowering. Medium in both body and carbonation.

Apricot and hops are the first tastes, but I found them to be a little weaker than I was hoping for. I really dug the sour apricot taste that finished each drink. I've heard some people complain about this, but I actually found it to be a highlight. I can't comment on this season being different from that, as this is the first time I've had this beer.

Mouthfeel is standard, medium-light body with some refreshing carbonation. Taste took me aback, and initially I did not know what to think - not unlike my first tasting of Festina Peche. Sour, orangey, with what I perceive to be an unrecognizable fruit flavor which I will take as apricot. Whatever it is, I like it. I find it quite sour in the middle. Finish dry with a tinge of hop bitterness and lingering sourness. Drinkability is very high, as the 7% ABV is completely covered up by the sweet and sour flavor.

DFH clearly knows how to make good beer, but making a good fruit beer is a tall order for anyone. The fruit flavors aren't bad, per se. It doesn't taste artificial.

The tasted is dehydrated apricots. Almost a concentrated apricot flavor. The mouthfeel is sticky sweet, with apricot sticking to the roof of your mouth, and staying around for a while, almost the same way a hop bite will linger on your tastebuds.

As soon as I opened the bottle there was a rush of apricots and I never really got much past that in the aroma. This beer reminds me A LOT like Magic Hat #9, perhaps a little stronger alcohol presence. After drinking it a while there was some sort of flavor that resembled spicy hops but it's too sweet and definitely overshadowed by apricots. I've got 3 more (purchased 4 pack) so I'll give it another shot but unless something really changes I probably won't get it again. Update -- as promised I had it again and nope, it's just not very good. I can see it being alright if you're in the right mood and want something fruity and a bit different.

Smells really nice and roasty- similar to their Indian Brown Ale which surprised me that it would have such a darker beer character. Also has a nice sweetness in the aroma as well that isn't as present in the Brown Ale. The taste is a mix between the fruit juice character of the apricots and the otherwise ""beeryness"" of the hops and malt. Personally, I find it confusing. You get a really heavy mouthfeel from the juice aspect which competes with the other side. I think I would have enjoyed it if they blended the two and by making it a darker beer, allowing the fruity and sweet aspect of the beer to be accented by some roastyness from the malt and some more noticeable alcohol content. It's a good take on fruit beers because it's not just a wheat beer and some syrup thrown in there but I'm not 100% sure it works for me.

The sweetness of the fruit was the first thing that I tasted and I could not really get past it. I tasted the fruit at the beginning, got the hops in the middle and then back with the fruit. Overall, this was not what I was expecting at all. I expected more IPA with a hint of the apricot, but it seemed for me to be the other way around.

The smell is of subtle IPA you still get the caramel malt and buttery grain with citrus/pine hops but everything is subdued a bit and rounded by a bit of sweet apricot. The taste is again a decent IPA, nothing over the top by any means, but the IPA base is there with sweet apricot layered on top. The hoppiness is cut a bit so as not to fight with the fruit while the fruit isn't cloyingly sweet or way overdone, overall the balance spot on. The finish is sweet and dry and well it tastes like apricots quite pleasant actually. Drinkability too is good the beer has enough balance to make it quite quaffable despite weighing in at 7%, the alcohol is really well hidden. I was skeptical of this pairing and admittedly slow to give this beer a try but I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.

I think the fruit is showing up more now than when I first purchased it. Nice level of hops, and not too much that could interfere with the apricot flavour. Malts are well done here as well.

Smell was rather perfumey with a moderate level of hop aroma and a subtle, but noticeable level of apricot. Taste was very ""busy"" with quite alot going on simultaneously. First, comes the hop bitterness, which is pleasant. The, before the hops subside, comes the sweetness and tartness of the apricot. It almost tastes like what I would imagine eating grapefruit and apricot together would taste like. It's rather bizarre, indeed. Then during and after the finish, there is a sensation that almost reminds me of spraying cologne and getting some mist in my mouth. Strangely, inspite of my description, it isn't really unpleasant, just odd. I didn't find this beer offensive, but it certainly is novel to say the least.

There is a slight fruitiness here, but I couldn't identify it as apricot if I had to. Mouthfeel is the strongest aspect of this beer - rich, smooth and pleasingly acidic. Very full mouthfeel for an IPA, regardless of what it's infused with. Let me say I really dig what the boys at Dogfish Head do - I love the ""risky"" beers.

Tasted similar, with the malts up front and the hops bringing up the rear.

No alcohol in the nose. Taste: The flavor of this beer was dominated by the apricot. Small bursts of bitter hops and nice malt flavors. Little carbonation noted, with no noticeable alcohol. Very clean taste to it. Seems very sweet from what I can remember from the last time I had this. Nice dry finish with a little yeast flavor in the aftertaste.

The beer poured a deep copper, forming a very thin head, that left medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is very full. Lots of hop aroma, followed by an extremely strong aroma of apricots. The taste is, IMO, overpowered by the apricot flavor. A good amount of hops, and a light alcohol presence, but mostly dominated by the apricots. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I was a little disappointed with this one. Not at all like I expected. Where their Punkin Ale was lacking in flavor, this one is overpowering in flavor.

Mild nose of tropical fruit, Crystal malt and background casacde hop aroma. Light caramel and mellow apricot flavors in the first sip. Fruit becomes more apparent in the aftertaste- the malt sweetness and gentle apricot flavor are delicately balanced by subdued american citrus hop flavor and even bitterness. Medium mouthfeel has dextrinous texture(possibly from fruit proteins?) and medium carbonation. This is a restrained fruit beer, and not an IPA + apricots as the label claims. The fruit character is evident, but less commanding as in most other fruit beers; the typical fruit blast is here replaced with a solid American Pale Ale base and simply accented with apricot. Finishes with minimal pale malt and caramel sweetness-lingering apricot tatse, and stubborn but muted hop bitterness. A highly drinkable beer that demonstrates what can happen when you don't screw a fruit beer up.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 15, 2007"

The aroma is of strong fruits, but I couldn't tell if it was actually apricots simply because it smells like it just came from a bourbon barrel. They almost have that same phenolic/ fruity smell. The taste on the other hand bring out that rather distinct flavor of apricots. It melds nicely with the taste and aromas of the hops. All around it is a very fruity beer. The mouthfeel starts off rather smooth , then turns to a rather thick creamy feel. It is followed up by a slight hop bite that dries out the end of it. Leaves a very nice after taste.

Smelled like sweet malt and some spice, also some orange peel maybe, might be the apricot though. Tastes like sweet malt, with hints of apricot, even though they were weak they were noticable. The hops were light in this brew (for an IPA) with the yeast coming through in the end and in the aftertaste.

Don't let the bottle fool you, this doesn't really taste like an IPA with some apricots thrown in, it's much less hoppy than any reasonable IPA would be. This is a good thing, as it makes for a well-balanced beer, although a bit on the hoppy side when you compare it to, say, Magic Hat #9. Whether you like it or not will probably depend mostly on how much you like the taste of apricots and hops put together.

It was rather lacking on the hops flavor. It had a hops front but the taste was rather weak. So was the apricot flavors. Maybe I had a bad bottle. The mouthfeel was bubble and semidry finish.

It is no wimpy fruit beer. Honestly it's thus far my favorite fruit beer. The bitter hops and spices are present as well as notes of carmel and apricot.

The smell is a nice floral and fruity hop aroma with malt sweetness - apricots are there, but nicely so. The taste is also good, with more complexity, if a little flat. Ends with a dry finish. Good mouthfeel, and drinkable for sure. This is a very solid and refreshing IPA, and I would enjoy it more often if it weren't for the high price.","kingjames1","Aug 23, 2006"

The taste was pretty good, sweetness, malty and balanced with a little bitterness. Tastes like more like an English Pale Ale. Mouthfeel is rich. I was not totally impressed with this beer.

The taste does not provide an overly hoppy character but rather a sweet malt taste that gives you a touch of apricot flavor and other fruit and spice notes.

The finish however veers off into a more pungent hop bitterness. I would have to say this was one of the better brews I've tasted in a long time.

As the beer warmed the taste of apricot became more evident. For a medium bodied beer, the mouthfeel was pretty smooth. This is a nice beer for summertime drinking, not too extreme and not boring at the same time. Less of an IPA(as the label states)and more of a fruit beer.

On the palate, hop bitterness crops up first, followed by fruity smoothness and a mild flavor. The finish is a bit apricoty and sticky, but overall this beer does not have a very big apricot component -- it's much less than the fruit component in some other DFH beers. I was surprised by this one -- it's less a fruit beer than a fruity IPA. Very flavorful, very smooth and creamy a la the DFH house style, and pretty well balanced.","geexploitation","Jun 28, 2006"

Somewhat weak aromas: apricot, of course, with some subdued floral/piney hops, and something sort of phenolic as well. The taste only barely hints at the presence of apricots. Overall, it's something of a clash of flavors: assertive pine-flavored hops are being smothered by some tart fruit flavors that, finally in the aftertaste, reveal themselves to be apricot. There's also a damn near cloying sweetness that seems to be coming from a heavy malt presence, not the fruit. The mouthfeel is likewise heavier than I'd prefer -- there doesn't seem to be much reason for this beer to be boozed up to 7% abv, but I'm not a brewer, so what do I know.

There was the initial apricot taste, then a sour/bitter grapefruit hoppy taste soon after, with a bit of sweetness after the bitterness. Very surprising, in a good way.

Maybe some wheat, biscuit and caramel. It had an overall mouthfeel that I enjoyed, and I'm not a big fruit beer kinda guy. It was sweet but not syrupy, hoppy but not bitter. Almost buttery aftertaste, lingering on the tongue. Very well balanced which I think is key in making this style.

If you put hops in the name it should be hopped up. False advertising. It was basically just a fruit juice smellin beer. Strange and unique. The nose had me excited to taste the beer, but the flavour was just lacking any kind of balls. It was just like a beer with some fruit addiitives in it. A bit weak at that. The hop profile again was none too intense in the flavour. One thing I can say to this brew's credit is that it never approached even an idea of being cloying or over sweet. The fruity flavours were perhaps done just richly enough to avoid any possible offense. Mouthfeel was light and the drinkability was actually alright for the style.

Grapefruit hops in the flavor leave a medium bitterness that gradually intensifies, and the bready/dark malts contribute just as much sweetness and a bit of molasses. The apricots hide in the back the whole time and on occasion I can taste the alcohol. By the end of the glass the sweetness is almost cloying, but that is the only real complaint here.

Plenty of aroma, with caramel malt, fruity apricots, floral and spicy hops, along with a bit of alcohol. Full, slightly viscous body with carbonation that's well integrated, leaving you with very fine bubbles and no harshness. Caramel malt sweetness throughout, with mellow apricot and moderate bitterness rounding things out at the end. Some pine hop flavour part-way through. Dryish hop finish with lingering apricot and a bit of alcohol warmth. A fruit beer that's definitely above average.

It' s as spicy and hoppy in flavor and bitter as you'd expect from an IPA with a thin delicate sweetness from the fruits. A slight metalic mouthfeel keeps this beer from perfection.

However, while most fruit beers (and many IPA's) are exercises in excess, Aprihop is an ode to balance. The apricots lend this beer such a gentle and distinctive taste, nestling in between the malt and hops beautifully.

The taste is a lot more fruity than I was expecting, and there is a pleasing apricot note there, but, like the smell, the apricot seems to be applied with a moderate hand, and doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer, and the hops and grain are still very strong. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, moreso than I'd like in a sweet beer, but still very good. The result is a very pleasant drinking beer, along the lines of the other apricot beer I regularly get exposed to (Magic Hat #9), but, honestly, much better executed. Alas, like #9, I wouldn't call this a session beer---after one beer I'm ready to try something else.","kaszeta","Jul 21, 2005"

3.6,-6,4,4,3.5,4,3,"12 oz bottle thanks to Foolcircle as part of BIF20. Pours a one-finger light tan head over a crystal clear orange/light rust liquid. Smells coho hoppy, caramel malty, and gently apricot. Initial taste is grassy hop that turns to oranges. Then the apricot steps in. Not a flavor blast, like I was expecting, just a pleasant fruity. At the very end of the taste, the hop has a orange pith tang that's not very pleasing. Wow what a great aftertaste. Malty caramel with a toffee that rises and fades. Medium bodied and moderate to mod-heavy carbonation.","mentor","Jul 04, 2005"

Actually, kind of a chocolate covered fruit type of smell? Where did that come from. Not what I expected, but nice. Thick head of medium tan bubbles. Beautiful copper/gold color. First sip goes in smoothly. Great mouth feel on this one. Average ale flavor with a hint of apricot in the background. No hops or bitterness present at first, but bitter in the finish. This beer looks and smells better than it tastes. Looks great in the glass, but very non-committal on the flavor. The flavor does not quite know what direction to go in.

This reminds me of Burton Baton in a way... very different beers, but they both share this odd taste, sort of like carborad? that I don't like at all. Don't know what it is, but it's in both beers.

The nose is lightly malty with a delicate touch of pine and some unclear fruitiness (guess that's from the apricots, huh?). It's slightly elevated carbonation bristles the tongue at first, but it becomes much more airy as it warms and its dextrinous medium body becomes clear. The flavor is a bit sweeter than the maltiness found in the nose might suggest, and it actually does have an apricot flavor to it! It's not as bitter as might be expected, but it's absolutely balanced; and the hop flavors blend in quite well with their leafy, woody, citrusy (? - and that might just be from the apricots as well), and mildly pine-like flavors. It finishes dry with a kick of bitterness and some residual dried-apricot flavor that sticks in the mouth.

I'm a big fan of Magic Hat #9 as an occasional brew, but this one is a lot better. It's less cloyingly sweet, and the apricot takes a back seat to the hop flavor, which is a good thing.

At 7% ABV this is so simple to drink that I recommend it for home consumption only. It is sessionable. I can see me having this with a stack of grilled beef and pineapple kabobs. Hey, the wife likes it too. The best thing for IPA lovers out there is to treat this for the fruit beer that it is, otherwise you'll be somewhat disappointed. Another winner from DFH.","pentathlete","Mar 19, 2005"

The nose is really nice, with a sweet apircot that is rather prevalent, but also with a nice citrusy hop in the background. Woo, this smells nice. The flavor is upfront with the grapefruity hop, with the sweetness from the apircot dancing in the background. Nice sweet and hoppy combination. I like it.

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured an orange/golden color that was crystal clear and well carbonated even after the time sitting around in the bottle since May. The head that was produced was off white in color, not very dense, fairly thin after a decent foam after the pour, after settling down it fell to just a simple ring on the edges, but it created a lace that was fairly sheety in nature. The aromas that came from the glass were of piney/fruity hops (not over-powering) some light malt tones, fresh herbs, and some light fruits all throughout (apples and apricots). The flavors were dominated with a nice smooth and creamy hop flavor (citrus and pine), not overpowering, but always present, caramels and malts were present in the beginning and in the middle along with herb and spice tones along with mild apricot flavors, as the swallow was nearing the end there was mostly pine trees, fruit and alcohol esters. There was a cocoa powder that hit the back of the throat as it slid down, but giving way to hops as an aftertaste. The body was light to medium, but the aftertaste was kind of thick. Smooth and creamy and seemed to hold up well over the months. A decent IPA, not overly hopped but it may have mellowed over time. My opinion it needs a tad more apricots in the aroma and taste, but not much or it will become overpowering. I did notice that afterwards I did burp hops  which are a good sign. I liked it.","Jarod","Jan 19, 2005"

Aroma wise, I have to admit, I had a hard time picking up the apricot. That is where I was expecting it the most. I got definite fruity notes and hoppy notes with some pine and of course citrus but it kind of all blended together. If I hadn't known about the apricot I don't think I would have found it. That said, the beer was great, very well made and a nice blend of hop bitterness, flavor and malt. Alcohol strength was not evident so it could sneak up on you. As far as the apricot goes, when I had a Magic Hat #9 several years ago I didn't pick up on the apricot immediately either - I thought it was more like a strange hop. This was similar, thus this may be the most appropriately named beer I've ever had. Recommended.","KroMagnon","Dec 21, 2004"

I wonder if my bottle was aged a bit since the apricot taste was quite subtle as opposed to some description of past rating.

A careful pour nevertheless yielded one finger of liquid under foam covering the rest of the glass. It took a full 13 minutes for me to get the entire 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Way too much head. Once we got the contents in, we had hazy slightly orange copper liquid under a voluminous beige head with the body of whipped cream. The head fades slowly, leaving excellent lace - so after the initial disaster, the appearance is really quite good. The nose is a pleasant combination of flowery hops and sweet apricot. As it warmed, the apricot came to dominate the hops. The mouth is fairly well carbonated, but pretty heavy, somewhat like fruit juice. The taste? Well, better than I expected, as I feared the apricot would dominate. Instead, there is sweet apricot flavor, but it is clearly imposed on a fairly hoppy IPA background. The hops are smooth and flowery at first, but move towards an espresso bitter impression in the finish and aftertaste. The apricot fades much more quickly, allowing a beer lover to actually enjoy this odd brew combination. After a very bad start, the overall impression is really not bad at all.","Globetrotter","Nov 27, 2004"

Sprucy, piney, and grassy hop aroma, with a very faint hint of apricot. The hops really overpower the apricot aroma. Moderate carbonation. First taste is hops and bitterness, but as soon as it touches your tongue, you can tell there is apricots in this brew. The taste of apricots is present, but matches well in the background. As the sip progresses the hop bitterness is very present. It is kind of an odd sensation, you really aren't tasting the apricots on the tongue, but rather in all other areas of the mouth.

Taste was initially hoppy before fading into a strong malty taste, much like an English IPA. I'm still really struggling to pick up any apricot flavors.

There's also some other funky aroma, but I just can't put my finger on it. Flavors to this brew start off initially malty with a bit of caramel and biscuit like flavors which quickly progress to a citrusy hop flavor and a mix of apricots. This brew is fairly creamy in body, and has a toffee flavor throughout mixed with a oaky like flavor. The finish to this brew is only slightly bitter, with a juicy piney flavor from the hops that lets you know its trying to be an IPA of sorts. The body to this brew is somewhere located on the middle to light side, but has a nice feel to it on the pallate.

Which is not to say it's overly sweet; actually, I'd say that it's a very well balanced beer. However, well... it's obviously a beer brewed with apricots.

The mouthfeel is very soft, flowing to the coarse hop taste that is probably of the citrusy Northwest varities then followed an apricot fruit taste. Aprihop finishes like an IPA with a crisp dryness from the hops. I would definitely say this is more like an IPA than a fruit beer, but of course it is a hybrid.

In flavor, pervasive are rather juicy apricot flesh tones, although hop bitterness assuages fruit sweetness. Hop flavor is expectedly orange like and rather complementary, but discernibly secondary to apricot. As the beer warms, lightly sugared biscuit notes arise and add depth to both fruit overtones and residual sweetness. Full bodied and agreeably viscous in mouthfeel, not unlike peach syrup. Finishes with a thick caramel and dextrin malt wash yielding to a continuation of whole apricot, skin included. A unique, well executed brew. Well balanced in terms of fruit flavor, hop bitterness and malt backbone. Rather heavy on the palate eventually, but is a welcome change of pace from fruit brews with vapid character.

3.57,-6.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"have been craving a hoppy beer and this being the only one I have in my current stash, I was looking forward to trying it. Its a solid IPA, but the apricot is very reserved. Ive had similar peach/apricot aromas from other IPAs (I think its a combination of yeasty fruitiness and certain types of hops) and Im not sure that I wasnt looking for it that Id notice apricots in this. Its more apparent in the aroma with a bit of dried apricot lurking under the slightly peppery hops. The flavor is mostly hops, but not overpowering, with a nice strong bitterness in the finish. The color is a dark amber on the red side of the category and the head is small and eggshell white.","aracauna","Jun 16, 2004"

Not that the first bottle was bad, but when the label made a big deal about being brewed with apricots, I was ready for an apricot-infused flavor, like Pyramid's apricot ale. On the first bottle, I really did not get any apricot notes, other than a general, fruity hops profile. Unusually malty and dense for the style, and the big abv is surpising. On the second sample, I was able to pick out some apricot flavor from the rather loaded hops profile. Overall, this did not strike me as a fruit flavored beer - it is more like an old ale or strong ale that happens to have some fruit flavors. It was not bad at all, just not what I had in mind.","Brent","Jun 16, 2004"

Not an overpowering aroma but a pleasing smelling beer. Expecting a big apricot taste with hops to come from this brew, and that was half met. There was definatly a great hoppy flavor present but the apricot was a bit more subdued than expected but still added nicely to the overall flavor . With the malt present the balance definatly was there,more so than DFH's other IPAs. A full bodied brew that goes down easy, too bad its a little pricey.

The apricot come as an after taste that you need to wait on just a little. The color scheme for the label is on target as well. A nice seasonal from Dogfish.

The taste is basically the Dogfish 60 with apricots, which (surprise again) is what you might expect before drinking this. The apricot taste seemed a bit too strong on the first sip, but it really seems to fit pretty well once you give it a few sips.

Taste like a good IPA, starts with slight sweetness to start followed by grapefruit flavored hops with bitterness but not overly so good tasting. Didn't notice much in way of apricots in this brew at all wouldn't really classify as fruit beer more like a good IPA. Mouthfeel is medium well balanced and extremely drinkable brew.

Smell is characterized by a nice balance between hops and sweetness. If I didn't know there was apricot, I wouldn't have detected it by smell--pineapple perhaps, but not apricot. The taste, however, is distinctly hoppy--very appropriate for the style. Nevertheless, sweet malts and warmth are present as well, balancing the taste much like the smell. Not as astringent as many IPAs but also not unduly clingy--a pleasant softness in the mouthfeel before the warmth shows up. While I would be hard pressed to identify the apricot in a blind taste test, this is a good beer by any measure and an uncommonly good fruit beer.","BitteBier","May 19, 2004"

The taste has a slight bitterness from the Warrior hops and a great hops presence that makes this ale. The sweetness from the apricot there, but in the background, which in my opinion is a good thing. It also has a peculiar woodiness to it, almost like it was aged in wood, but it's not.

It pours slightly lighter in color than the other dogfish head ipa's and immediately smells both of hops and of apricots. There is a small, lightly colored head at the top of each glass but the taste is what sells me on the beer (as it should). IPA hop-style beer apparently just blends perfectly with the apricot taste, this beers is very light on the tounge and is exceptionally smooth (with a strong hop flavor). The apricot taste doesn't overpower the beer and it seems that a balance is found between the two tastes.

Confusing flavor in many ways -- without a lot of malt or a heavier mouthfeel to anchor the beer in a fixed place, it strays into astringency and then seems more about apple peel and grape skins. To me, this wasn't a bad beer but it was overly thin and without a backbone other than wandering bitters. Just didn't strike me as a very well-composed experiment.","ADR","May 11, 2004"

I must say, the apricot aroma is evident, but nicely understated, as are the white pine esters, and together they seem to be a good match for the hops, at least in the smell. The taste, alas, is not quite as satisfying. The start is dull--a bit grassy, but neither the hops nor the apricots seem very full-bodied. There's a nice bready moment in the middle, but the finish is weak as well--not quite enough hoppy bitterness for my taste.

Taste has a toasty frontage blending quickly with herbal grassy fresh hops that has a mild bite ending with a mix of pine wood, citrus fruits and just a peppering of the apricot can be detected nearer the finish where it tappers off with a toasty malt flake and bake twinge and a grab of hop bittering thats favorabley mild. Feel is about medium, nice and crisp with a light drying quality with just the right amount of bite and balance making for a good drinking IPA fruity treat.

The nose was quite appetizing, serving up a rich and full hop bouquet that was completely melded with juicy undertones of mango and dried apricot. The taste was suprisingly understated considering the powerful nose. An immediate orangey-bittered maltiness hits the palate with an apricot flavor slowly increasing in intensity all the way through the moderately bittered finish, which left excellent lingering bittered flavors of apricot and mandarin orange. Very good flavors and finishing intensity, but lacking in flow. The body and carbonation were good for the flavors and personality of the brew.

3.46,-9.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"A tasty beer, more like an IPA with a touch of fruit than a lambic with extra hops. Not too sweet or syrupy, hops tang more pronounced as it warms. Yum!","WaltTrombone","Apr 06, 2004"

I like the concept, and it can work quite well, but they aren't quite there yet for me. These hop tastes aren't working with the malts and fruit all that well.

4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a reddish/amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a really nice balance between malts, hops, and fruit. It has a slight caramel scent that is blended with a slight apricot smell and hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a fine malt complex along side a mild apricot and hop flavor; very nice. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a really cool concept brew. It drinks well.","WesWes","Apr 05, 2004"
3.99,4.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Rather remarkable and unique concept behind a beer. Poured an amberish hue with a thinner beige head. Smells of grassy hops and subdued fuzzy apricots. Inviting. Sipping reveals a duality behind it. Initially malty and fruity sweet then turning dry and hoppy in the middle and a melding of the two completes the finish. Impressive, could be a standalone IPA even without the apricots. Overall, it's a bit of the sweeter side which cuts on its drinkability, however a seasonal worth checking out.","crookedhalo","Apr 05, 2004"

You get a little of the apricot fruitiness as the beer hits your mouth. But it is quickly overpowered by the hops at the middle and end. I was afraid this was going to taste like Magic Hats #9. My fears were ill founded. This is a good hoppy beer. Although I'm sure some severe hop heads might not like that hint of apricot.","ybnorml","Apr 02, 2004"
4.03,5.2,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Beer poured with a deep gold color with an orange/red ish hue. Up front this beer comes with the scaled down version of the hoppy bitterness of DFH's IPAs. Once it hits the back of the tongue and goes down the throat, this beer really gives way to the apricots. I can taste them for a minute or two after taking a sip. The apricot flavor really lingers in a subtle way. Similar to sundried turkish apricots. It all finishes up with a snappy, tongue-dry mouthfeel. I wouldn't say this beer hides its 7%abv, but it fits right in with the flavor. I was skeptical about how these flavors would balance (hops, apricots) but it was done, and done well. Heck of an IPAish thing they crafted. Heck of a thing.","GIVEMEBACKMYSON","Apr 02, 2004"

3.99,4.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Haha, I definetely like the previous reviewer's description - #9 on drugs - well put. Poured an orange color with a small head that dissapated almost immediately. Aroma is great, apricots and citrusy hops melding together perfectly. The mouthfeel is low in carbonation, very smooth and medium bodied. At first sip, the apricot is not very noticable - it starts of sharp and bitter, goes to a sweet, dry IPA finish and the apricots jump out a second or two after swallowing. Very good characteristics with this brew.","nixhecks","Mar 28, 2004"

3.77,-1.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4," The flavor is pretty good. You start with a decently hopped IPA, and throw in some real apricots, and you end up with a pretty interesting brew. The apricot flavor is not as strong as in some other fruit beers, but the fact that this one has a very noticable hop character as many fruit beers do not really helps it. It is crisp and very drinkable. This is a nice warm weather drinker with a bit more character than most of its challengers. An interesting idea that really can hit the spot.","ElGuapo","Mar 22, 2004"
4.39,14.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours golden with slightly amber hue. Less than a one finger head that is very light and airy. Smell is wonderful with hops and apricot present. Duh! Wow, first sip reveals a pale ale with fruity taste but not a typical grapefruit taste as other pale ales or IPA's. No bitter taste. Everything is done very subtly here no sickly sweet fruit taste but a nice balance. Very drinkable and I could see having more than one. No strong aftertaste - a very slight fresh hops taste lingers with every so slight bitterness on edges of the tongue. All in all a nicely balanced brew. Maybe not a top 50 beer but I would drink again.","mjohn27603","Mar 21, 2004"

This is not one of those sickly sweet fruit beers (ala #9) but a very solid IPA with some really faint, clean, citrus and apricot notes that make it even a little more drinkable on a warm day. I had two, could of had another couple as well which is more than I can say for most fruit beers. This really should please IPA lover's AND those of us who look for new, cool seasonal offerings from great brewers. I hope this is a standard seasonal for DFH --- I will have this again throughout April and hope to have it for years to come. A pleasant surprise to find this at a local store which rarely carries anything beyond macro's and SNPA.","Gasp100","Mar 21, 2004"

3.33,-13.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass, formed a big ol' inch tall light tan head which had some staying power. An orangey amber in color, with serious foamy lacing. Slightly fruity aroma, but more dominated by hops and a tinge of malt. Flavor not really as hoppy as I would have expected for an IPA, and the fruit doesn't seem to be present in the taste at all, almost as if they cancelled each other out on my taste buds or something. The hops does seem to turn it up a notch in the latter part of the mouthfeel. For all I've said the beer remains totally drinkable, and a serious session possibility. Just would have liked the flavor to agree with its name a bit more.","ppoitras","Mar 13, 2004"

The apricot is way off in the distance. In the mouth the beer slides accross the palate-wonderful slick texture! Flavors offer as much sweet malt and bread-like grain flavors as they do snappy hop. The apricot lingers so far in the background that it adds to the beers complexity without defining it-as an apricot beer. Boy this is good! It is almost sweet, but at the same time so very crisp and clean! My friend had this with a duckbreast sandwich, and said it paired with alacrity! Highly recommended!!!","moulefrite","Mar 12, 2004"

Taste: Hoppy pine tones with moderately roasted malts creating some woody and caramel tones nice flow to it, with just enough presence of the apricot great tasting mild but still packs a decent unnoticeable shot of alcohol weighing in at 7% abv.

3.78,-1.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I must say I approached this one with hesitation, which is why I begged for a single to test out first before committing to a 4 pack. It pourd a fairly dark amber color and formed a huge foamy white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and some floral elements with maybe only a slight hint of apricot. The flavor was of malt, hops and apricot. The malt in my opinion seemed to hold more sway than it should over the hops. The hops were present, but more apparent in the bitterness of the finish. I just could get into the flavor of this one. Not a bad beer, but didn't impress me, either.","Wildman","Mar 05, 2004"

4.09,6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I'll admit, with DFH's general reputation preceding the beer, I was expecting #9 on steriods, but it is indeed more than just that. The fruit itself was predictable, but the interplay with the malt and hops offered up a surprisingly bright and refreshing effect. The aroma intrigues nicely, and the flavor gives it credence. Despite still not being the world's biggest fruit beer fan, the cool combination makes it pleasurably drinkable. So it seems, toss some earthy fruit into a good IPA, and you end up with something fun and feisty. Leave it to DFH to figure that out.","Foxman","Mar 03, 2004"

Golden orange in color, has a wonderful sweet nose of apricot, spice, and hops. The apricots are the most noticeable aroma. Flavor blends the hops and fruit very very well, with the apricot flavor adding a nice sweet touch to the bittering agent of the hops.

I had no idea what I was ordering, but being a Dogfish Head creation I was sure to be different. The glass I received had a nice half inch thick head sitting upon a slightly cloudy straw colored beer. When I raised it to my nose I detected the aroma of Cascade hops. I thought to myself that this was just another American Pale Ale. Upon tasting it, I couldn't have been more wrong. I have to tell you that I'm not a fan of fruit beers, but THIS fruit beer made me a convert. Very complex. That's how I would describe my initial reaction. I couldn't decide what I enjoyed more: the APA bitterness, the subtle sweetness which no doubt was due to the apricots, the almost subliminal taste of the apricots themselves, or the perfect carbonation which only enhanced everything else. All in all a fantastic beer. Being a homebrewer, I'm already planning to duplicate this beer.","mrpivo","Nov 12, 2003"

Despite that, the beer poured a very cloudy and dull orange-brown. It looked like apple cider. The small white head faded quick. I had been excited to try this beer and was not disappointed. It was almost like a high quality IPA (60 minute?) blended together with a sweet apricot cider. Hops were floral and still very detectable.
