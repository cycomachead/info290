"EDIT:  On a plus note, if you know someone who wants an introduction to IPA's this would probably be OK.  I tend to give 2's only to beers I don't want to buy again -- doesn't mean it was ""bad"", just I thought it was far off from good."

""

"O:  an outstanding IPA with great balance and a decent complexity of flavors.  buy it if you see it."
""
"Now this is what an iPa  should be"
"Was a good IPA that had good gloral notes.  Will be having more."

"Too hoppy for my personal taste."

"Good friend from Syracuse suggested to grab a few of these and I was glad I did.  A really outstanding IPA.  Intense aroma out of the glass and matching taste.  The beer was balanced very well and I look forward to more of these."

"I'm just writing this so I don't get fined."

"Hop honey, delicious beer, glad I visited buffalo"
"O-Very drinkable IPA froM the NorthEast. If you are a fan of musty hops, this is a nice treat. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As close to perfect as it gets for an IPA."
""
"What a great IPA.  I bought this in a mixed six pack and I was blown away!  It is a really refreshing hoppy IPA that works really well in the warmer weather.  It pours a nice light golden color with plenty of hop aroma.  The taste is lighter and crisp.  It is a refreshing beer.  The hops and a slight sweetness go really well together.  This is a must try and a must have!  I enjoy and recommend this beer."

"Great ipa with a surprising touch of honey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Nice creamy texture. Very smooth and moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Goes down easy.  A pretty good IPA.  I'm a little burned out on iPA's, and it's not much different than 50 other ones, but it is drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A sweet and floral IPA that lives up to its name."
""
"Overall, a very good IPA and one worth getting. The IPA isn't as hoppy as other variations but most certainly lives up to its name. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"deep gold like color, smells of grapefruit and some floral scents, tastes very crisp and light with a mild touch of grapefruit, very smooth IPA"
"Great Classic IPA taste. Nice potency. Easier to consume many!"
"Overall: I wrote this up quick because I wanted to drink this beer, giving it the respect it deserves. If I had to compare this to another beer I'd (dare I say it) say that it is very similar to Heady Topper. I just wish that it was unfiltered as it has been in the past, but what else can you ask for. Another exceptional Northeast IPA."
"Palate fatigue and such factors aside, this isn't the same Flower Power I recall from some years back: no killer nose, no hoppy, piney bite. I see a 2013 review sort of compared this to Zombie Dust and another heralded it's West Coast character. Wow, OK. Totally different beer in 2015 folks . Nonetheless it's still actually a very good IPA.  Goes down quite easy for a 7+% beer but that also speaks to the simpler nature of this incarnation of FP.  It's not a world class IPA anymore in my book but still very good if you can find it fresh. Some of the older reviews on the site are working off a prior version of this beer that was far more transcendent than what Ithaca is churning out nowadays."
""
"Haven't had this in 2 or 3 years. Pretty good!"
""
""
""
"Good beer. Very tasty in my opinion."
"Flower power has a good hoppy finish"
"O: Very balanced, very easy to drink"
""
""
"Had this once before. Over all pretty good but a tad too dry and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  American IPA's don't get much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid IPA but not really Earth-shattering. Definitely drinkable and a good everyday choice."
""
"Copper color, light foam,well balanced, not too dank, not too sweet, just right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent IPA and well worth the hassle of bringing it home on a plane. A bit like a lighter version of Hop Slam if my memory serves me right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very well made beer, I was pleasantly surprised. Wish we could get this beer (and fresh) in CO."
"On the light side, with medium carbonation for the style but very good lacing. Biscuity malt notes, and the hop notes are pine and crushed aspirin. Good beer, but not one of my favorites because of a slight soapiness."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing beer. Hoppy, full of citrus. Mangos, grapefruit, hint of pine. Fairly bitter. Highly recommend. Great burp taste!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer. It's not a hop bomb if that's what your looking for. It is very clean and crisp in feel. Citrusy with slight hoppy bitterness in flavor. It's not as sweet as some IPAs. Overall great drinkable standard IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very citrusy for an ipa, good after you adjust."
"One of my favorite IPA's. Love the grapefruit undertones and great odor. This is a mainstay in my beer pantry. Just don't like the updated label"
""
"Bottled on 12/10. I prefer this one fresh as it hasn't held up well in the past over 90 days. Quite simply put, this is a tropical sensation of tongue-smacking bitterness. I really enjoy it, and I think it's one of the better single IPAs in steady rotation. Seek it out."
"One of the things I miss about upstate"
""
"It's good.  I had on tap for this review. I've had in bottles also. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  Revision 1/29/15 had in bottle this time like 1st time and I like it better than 2nd time on draft. Good ipa"
""
""
""
"This is my second time having this beer and, while it tastes different than I remember, it still kicks ass. Loving the new label/box."
""
"Have a pitcher of this and you won't regret it."

"DATE TASTED: December 26, 2014... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: unwinding after the Christmas visitors have left... APPEARANCE: hazy, opaque, almost blood-orange body; white coral sits atop an uneven head; uneven lacing... AROMA: brilliant, BIG mango and pomegranate mix with a floral bouquet to arrest the senses... PALATE: buzzing, vibrantly electric mouthfeel; warm, full finish; big, but drinkable; intense, teeth-clenching aftertaste...TASTE: a potpourri of citric cadences--orange, lemon, grapefruit, mango and sharp sugars--a hop bomb... OVERALL: a mesmerizing enticement of hops, much as the mix pack proclaims; more overpowering than the Cascazilla and the banner carrier in a hop offensive..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good coming into this. Has a nice, well-balanced hop character with the bitterness. I would have again and would recommend to a friend. Not elite, but a decent IPA. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O:  Good beer but nothing excellent."
""
"O.  A very average IPA.  Not enough hop there for me.  But it's not bad.  Would drink it again but with so many other options I'd probably just pass it up."
""
"Great stuff. I love this beer"

""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"One of the best IPAs in the country."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Basic ipa - average against the plethora of ipas today"
""
""
""
""
"Not sure if I just had an older bottle, but the malts seemed to overpower the hop presence here."

"Decent beer. Not too heavy, bitter enough for an IPA. This is the type of beer that you can have four or five of in one session. Definitely a lower quality but go to IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz pour into a standard pint glass.  Slightly cloudy pale straw gold color.1/2 inch head that dissipated but clung to the side of the glass aggressively.  Awesome floral aroma.  Hop forward flavor with nice balance.  Bitterness is present but nicely attenuated.  Just makes you want to drink more.  I have had it fresh on tap and it is really outstanding.  I am so glad that it is now available where I live, though in bottles.  One of my go-to beers.  Quite delicious."
""
""
"O: It seems that there is a never ending supply of IPAs out there, and that finding quality iterations is becoming easier and easier, but Flower Power is a standout. A beer I would definitely purchase again, and which might well become my go to IPA while living in NYC."

"O--Hands down one of my favorite IPAs.  I was blown away the first time I tried this beer--hops smack you in the mouth but they manage to dissipate by the superb balance of the malts.  This beer is a gateway to hoppy beers for someone who is scared away by hop bitterness.  Well done Ithaca."
""
""
""
""
"This is essentially an EC version of Stone IPA.  Pale malt surrounded by pine, grass, and light pine cone.  Bitter lemon and biscuit accompanying.  Classic East Coast IPA, if not all American IPA.  Drinkable, approachable, and simply lovely.  Nose is light, but this beer is suitable for any IPA lover.  Hop beginners welcome here..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex IPA.  There is a variety of flavors, and the hops do not overshadow the other flavors."

"when this beer first came out, i was in love, to me almost the perfect beer(4.75/5)...but! i'm probably alone on this but i think they changed the recipe, and not for the good. i have not had a Flower Power in months, i hope they reverted back to the original recipe. mine is most likely the only opinion per the downfall of this once amazing beer...this beer is most certainly worth a try though, if at the least you can taste a glimpse of what this beer used to be..."

"Really drinkable and very tasty.  Reminds me a good bit of Nugget Nectar in the way that it is hoppy and bitter while being balanced nightly with malt sweetness."

"Cheers!!!"

"On tap, pours a light Amber/copper color with little head, approximately 1-2cm. Predominantly piney with Orange notes, very light and crisp. Extremely light. More reminiscent of a lager rather an IPA. Leaves something to wish and hope for, maybe if they kicked up the bitters and hops if revisit but for me, this is a once and only time I'll be trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Its not super hoppy....but its super grapefruity and orange...with a nice dry bitter aftertaste....I really like this a lot! not my fav but still good!"

"O- Everything about this beer says ""subtlety.""  It's hoppy, but not overly so.  The malt presence is sweet but in a rounded way that plays off the hops damn near perfectly.  The ABV is such that it gets the job done but not overdone.  Smooth, simple, effective.   As far as non-intense IPAs go, this one is my favorite.  Could drink it all day, every day."

"Why a 4.0 if the bottle was old and the flavors muted?  Well it was still quite tasty and I believe a fresh beer would easily earn this grade..."

"Pours a golden orange color with decent head and tremendous lacing. Slightly cloudy. Aroma is awesome with pine resin and lots of citrus. Taste is similar to aroma with pine resin, hops and a lot of citrus, especially sweet tropical citrus. Nice mouthfeel and th balance of hops and citrus is great. The sweet of the tropical fruit is teasing in that it makes you want a little more but I am glad it doesn't because tha balance is very good. A hoppy-citrusy beer that is very drinkable and offers a great clean, crisp finish leaving you wanting more...."
""
""
"Flower Power pours a cloudy shade of golden orange. The aromas are heavily on the citrus fruit side: lots of fresh orange peel, pineapple, and grapefruit. But underneath those aromas is a light, herbal tea-like scent, which is really nice. The taste is sweet and juicy, with sweetened white grapefruit juice the dominant flavor. The finish is mostly sweet, too, though there's a pronounced bitterness at the very end. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. This is a great juicy, herbal IPA that I'm glad to see in Ohio. Definitely on the sweeter side, but it's a good, light sweetness, rather than a heavy, overpowering, and awful sweetness you see in something like Chillwave."

"12oz bottle.  Looks good in the glass.  Nice aroma and taste.  Easily a top 10 IPA for me...  Below Sculpin and Jai Alai, but I like it more than Bells Two Hearted.  Would gladly have it again."

"This is my old faithful!  Euphorically hoppy."
"One of my personal staples, this hits all the right notes for me. Pours a nice golden yellow with a thin off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of floral and pine notes from the hops while also having hints of orange and lemon peel. The taste is crisp and full of flavor. Highly tasty and refreshing."
""
""
"O: This is a very good IPA, but I don't think it's in my top ten. For an IPA with such a pale, relatively blank malt canvas, I'd expect a more outstanding dose of bitter, resiny hop character. For a conventional take on the style, though, it works really well."
""
""
""

""

"A very decent beer with a pleasant hoppy aroma and a citrusy/piney bitter flavor. Pours a decent head and a color that it's typical IPA. Really nice overall."

"Poured a golden body with good head and lace patches on top of a citrusy aroma that is sharp and cutting (like bitter hops). Beer is light, crisp, hint of spices or dirty hops, a good citric profile and there is balance from light caramel and bread malt notes. More hoppy than anything else but not bad at all."

"08/04/13 From bottle. Speaking as a very unhoppy guy this is s a most enjoyable beer. Someone just explained that it is an ""East coast"" hoppy beer vs the usual Westie style. Makes me happy as now I can hold my head high & say I am not alone. Hops have their place but they should be ""seen but not heard"", in a sense. As it Warms to ambient temperature, the hop comes to the fore, but still keeps trim. Whoever made this is a hero."

"Overall great beer. I'd love to venture a guess as to what hops were used -- Amarillo, Citra, Simcoe, Cascade?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Never heard of this brewery before so I was a little skeptical, but this beer was pretty great! A little pricey going for around 3 bucks a single 12oz (not sure about sixers). Probably one of my favorite IPA's I have tired all year. Really reminds me of the workhorse ipa from Laurelwood in Portland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a pretty prototypical example of the clean & crisp side of IPA's, as opposed to the dark & dank side. I don't know if I'd buy it again, but I'm glad I tasted this apparently well sought-after brew. If you like IPA's that are really on the crisp and fruity side, you'd probably like this one"

"This is the real deal ladies and gentlemen, and I am proud of this local product. Smells like a pinecone mated with a citrus and developed some kind of wonderful bastard spawn. Tastes even better, this one leaves no lie between nose and tongue. To be honest, I can say more about the nose than the taste as I find it hard to stop sniffing it. When I take a swig, I am thinking of all the more exclusive and higher priced IPAs I've had. My quest for the hard-to-come-by and hyped-up has led me to neglect a true jewel, right underneath my fingertips. Never again. Ithaca, my hat is off to you, this is a masterpiece."

"This is hands down a top 5 best IPA out there. The citrus notes after a quite potent bite from the hops is a perfect blend of happiness. It is a little pricey, but the juice is absolutely worth the squeeze. I have had twonkegs of this delicious beer over the last two years, and it is quite simply the best out there."

"Always looking for a good IPA, let's give this one a whirl. Popping the top I nice citrus waft of hops. Very pungent smell of grapefruit and banana. Pours to a bright yellow with a bright white head that stands well. On the taste this brew has a nice hop belt up front with floral sweetness in the background. The sweetness then smoothly transitions to the front but the floral hops hang on then come back in the end with a sharp bitterness that then fades to a flat bitter sweet aftertaste. Very intense flavors, distinctive and gradual, nothing abrupt. Pricey, but a keeper without a doubt."
""
""
""
"O- A great IPA, has everything I like about the style- crisp, refreshing, a beautiful aroma that unfolds as it warms in the glass, and a nice bitter finish that washes down my pastrami sandwich perfectly."
"Drinkability - Although the first round was a tad disappointing, I'm going to try this again. If not for the taste, then just for that incredible lacing. Thanks Ithaca!"

"O- Glad this IPA is readily available. Its another great go-to ale around here. Great job with the hops, and its light and crisp enough for a summer day, yet yields a nice hop punch that comes in handy all year long. Ithaca did a really good job here. One of my top 5 easily obtainable IPAs."

"Poured out a hazy orangey gold. The head is pretty thick, white, with soapy lacing lasting throughout. The aroma is mild with some pretty strong caramel notes and just a hint of citrus hops. The flavor is about the same. Neither is bad, but there really isn't all that much that makes this beer noteworthy. There is a good weight to the body, thicker than I was expecting based on previous comments. It's a decent beer."
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall - I think this is a solid version of the style, though I would suggest better version exist."
""
""
""
""
""

"Hits you with one to two fingers of bone white foam, fairly dense weave but there are some bigger bubbles, the lacing forms very long streaks, however, not the stickiest. Cloudy yellow to light orange hued liquid, lots of “floaties” inside, fully opaque, you can only see a few lazily scattered bubbles but unlikely there’s many more you can’t discern. The nose is on the aggressive side, herbaceous and piney, dried grapefruit pith, metallic earth, burnt bread crusts and while the florality and peach, apricot fruit are no pushovers, they don’t have the raw power to show decisively, overall its muscular texture lengthens presence more than gluey richness. In the mouth it has a similar feel, close to full-bodied, focused on grip over layering. As you get pineapple, papaya mixed into the apricot and apple, more nervosity, same for the white grapefruit, blood orange citrus, comes into its own. Still, little ignoring the grassiness and earthiness, on the bitter side of the ledger. Pine, dash here and there of cocoa or mocha. Seems to want to offer fewer elements and intensify what is there. Carbonation is sneakily strong, enlivens the finish. While not an easygoing rendition of the category, by the same token not overly challenging to the point of conceding the victory."

"O - Overall the beer seems to be a quality beer, just not exactly my style. I really like the smell, but the taste, while complex, is not my ""cup of tea"", but seems to be really good for that style of beer. I am only slightly disappointed because I expected some of the sweetness from the amazing smell to carry over into the taste, but it barely did. Overall it seems to be a very good, very quality beer, just not really my style taste-wise."

"overall; very versatile, tasty beer. would buy again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head, lots of carbonation. Smell is of hops, citrus. Taste is hoppy, bitter, citrus, a touch of resin. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while it didn't quite live up to the hype, it is a good quality beer."
""
"O- a nice mix of citrus and hops... not stunning, but s great vibe for the price. Very spring, very supported."

"Poured into a Tallgrass Brewing tulip. Pours two fingers of thick frothy white head with a pale golden colored body. Up front juicy tropical fruit hops with a more herbal hop behind that. Taste is more herbal/catty hop forward than the fruity hops in the nose. Sweet biscuit backbone. Medium mouthfeel with a sticky dry finish. Overall a nice looking IPA with a great nose of tropical fruits, citrus and herbal hops. Nice dry hopping too. The taste is more catty as compared to the nose but still has some nice citrus notes. Respectable and recommended."

"O - For me the best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. The appearance, smell, and taste are all good, however, nothing truly stands out. This is a good all-around IPA that is drinkable and session able, but it needs more juice/pop."

"Had this on-tap at the surprisingly good local tap-list at our hotel in Rye Brook, New York. So good that I ignored the rest of the list and had a second. A very well balanced IPA with citrus and pine, a touch of sweetness reminiscent of honeycomb, and a satisfyingly crisp finish. Very fresh tasting and full bodied while also being thirst quenching. I could drink this all of the time if it were local."

"Nice chilled haze on a golden body with a solid 3-4 fingers of foam; sticky lacing clings. Sticky and sweet hops in the aroma. Flavor is nice, pineapple, tropical fruit, touch of papaya, very juicy. Clean and refreshing, a very tasty IPA!"

"Best IPA I have tasted yet. I will be honest I am not into appearance or smell. I am into the taste of IPAs and beer in general. The taste is amazing in this IPA. I also visited the brewery and had it on draft. Draft was delicious as well but the bottle was just as good. Almost tastes likes double IPA. I would recommend this to any IPA lover...Expensive but worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This reminded me much more of a DIPA than an IPA but is high on quality. Such a smooth example that is inviting on all levels. For how good it is the label needs some sprucing up like some commentary and actually listing the ABV but oh well. Appropriately named however since it is quite floral and sweet. A must try indeed."
""
""

"O: This is a great offering. My local NoVa Wegman's got a pallet in and the beer guru there told me he used to live in NY and they would make special runs for this. Not hard to see why. a very good spring IPA. Pleasing to drink, pleasing to allow to linger in your mouth. I have been able to get my hands on some really good IPAs lately and this is one of them. If you find it, buy it and enjoy it."

"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much special going on here. Kind of a strange blend of flavors too. Not worth hunting or being your first go to at the beer store. Many better brews in the style."
"This is a wonderful hop-forward beer.  Crisp, flavorful, and not sweet.  Loved it."
""
"Love the sweet aroma when bringing it up, reminds me of spring. Which we are in desperate need of in upstate New York. The hoppy taste is great. Leaves that good after taste. Friend told me I HAD to try it. Found it available in a growler. Will be getting my card stamped and filled from this."

"Pours a golden orange with a medium white head, good lacing. Aroma and Taste is a rich floral citrus and pine hops aroma, fruity some mild orange peel essence balanced with some good caramel malt flavor on the end. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. This brew is very tasty and well balanced with some lingering hops and caramel malt on the end. A very good brew."

"O: Flower Power is among my favorite beers, IPA or otherwise. It inhabits its own unique place in the East Coast IPA range (not being overly malty or hoppy) and would contend with the best from the opposite coast as well. Best of all, it's readily available in the Northeast. Drink as much as you can."

"this is a 1st class IPA..high quality beer for sure..its not the strongest IPA out there which is a good thing..a drinking beer..the strength of taste and its a little fuzzy at the end...otherwise it would have a 5.0..we truley live in a wonder time when a beer like this is not perfect..back in the early 80's Bass,Sierra and the Sam Adams were the best we could do..which they are still good,save for the fact Bass is not from England anymore"

"I give this beer a perfect 5 across the board. Ithaca really nailed it with this one. The name Flower Power speaks for itself. The honey orange glowing appearance calls out to you right from the pour. Less than a finger head that lingers around. The mouth feel on this beer is equal to the robust nose that it offers leaving no disappointments. Truthfully for the more experienced IPA drinker. FYI this beer will change your palate for the night so it will be tough to drink anything less in flavor."

"O-Do not get me wrong. It's a damn good beer, however when compared to others, it doesn't coat the tongue like other fantastic IPAs. It's a definite try and while I wish I could get more out here in Texas, I'll be okay sticking to other IPAs that are easier to find that make me equally happy."
"Overall - refreshing and not over powering IPA. I could spend all day drinking this stuff. Only had one drink and need to get more."

"O- its ok. I think i may have gotten a bottle past its prime. The notch was on the J for january so this leads me to believe that it is outdated. I want to visit this again in the future."

"This is a delightful beer with LOADS of hop scent, they must have just dryhopped with all the flowers they had, but it works--the malt balances it out pleasantly. Not very bitter. There's a bunch of alcohol in there but you'll be too focused on the flowers, and taking the next sip. To see if you can find her this time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice for an IPA -- lots of hop complexity and a really strong flavor. I would consider this an imperial IPA from the taste and the body of the beer, but I'm probably being fooled by the huge hop character. It's missing something to offset that huge hop character, but is not a bad beer at all. This won't become one of my favorites, but I'm really glad that I tried it. After a great aroma, the taste was a little bit of a let down, but this is definitely a fine beer."

"O: This is a solid, solid every day beer. Living in California, I'm grateful to be able to try a NY brew. My only complaint is that the nose is much more inviting than the taste. Interpret my overall as a 4.33, I really can't decide which way to sway."

"So happy this stuff finally came across my path. I was at one of my beer haunts in Ohio, and there it was. I can see why this is a classic American IPA. Lots of sharp, fresh, citrusy American hop flavor, but maintains its drinkability. I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
"Overall this ha got to be one of the finest sessionable IPAs I have ever had. It's winter now as the review goes, in a warm home. This reminds me of summer."

"Very nice IPA. Mouth feel was very light and airy. Color was an nice orange with white head. Smell had nice floral and slight citrus notes. Taste was fruity and flowery as described in the name. Got this because they were out of Maine Brewing Company Mo. I would get this beer again."
""
"i would give this a good rating not up in the top level of IPAs as there are so many good ones out now just was a bit on the malty side for me"
""
""
""
"This is a great representation of the style and highly sessionable at 7.5%. Thanks again Premier Gourmet!"
"When an interesting new draft beer shows up at any of my favorite Ithaca bars, I'm always glad to try it for a change, but even gladder when this great IPA is on tap, as it nearly always tastes better than anything else I try. You non-Ithacans are so lucky we export this stuff!"
""
""
"Overall - the first few I had I didn't get it. Tonight everything has clicked. Typical pine, grapefruit IPA with superb tropical flavours, a beautiful appearance and a nose I could spend all day with. Wonderful stuff"
""
"Overall - despite it not being the most attractive looking beer I've seen, the smell is great and it is a very tasty beer. I would go out of my way to find it again and I am pleased to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I finally got my hands on some of this and honestly was slightly disappointed. Not the hop presence that I was expecting. Good flavors nonetheless, but nothing that I am needing more of. Overall a decent IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was extremely pleased the second time I tasted this, fresh was a beautifully blended brew with an AMAZING smell. The nose is the best part, and that's not a bad thing either. I rated it a little lower only because of my first experience. I will re-rate this when I get my hands on another taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light apricot, with a thick two finger white head. Big tropical nose on this one, pineapple, mango, and grapefruit are slammed into here. Huge hops all around this beer. The taste is very bitter up front and I'm lovin it. Middle of the mouth gets a break with more of a tropical sweetness then bitterness. Followed by the finish with a very dry bitterness. My first Ithaca brew has me thinking I need to try more of their stuff immediately. Maybe a top five IPA? Maybe..."
""
""
"Overall - An awesome IPA. It is a hoppy beer but not overbearing in my opinion. Definitely in my top IPAs I have tried. Would buy this beer again"

"overall, it's a bit too hoppy for my taste buds these days. a few years back i loved IPA 's & hoppy brews but now i favor a more balanced taste. this would be a nice ale for a beautiful, warm day. maybe a bright day that matches the bright tones of the look & taste of flower power. i might be able to drink 2 of these in one sitting... so, for me, not a session ale. still, for the style it's a damn good drink!"

"Overall, I wish that the dry hopped Flower Power had the same level of carbonation as this bottle did. I found the dry hopped version to be superior in aroma and flavor, but lacked the zippy carbonation. I was expecting more from this one, however it is probably one of the best examples of a balanced IPA, which is popular with many, but not my bag as I want the hops squarely in my face with the malt playing only a supportive role."
""
""
""
""
"Color is a little light, and masks the burst of flavor that you are in for. The nose is a little more of an indication...the flowers, citrusey hops, are practically tasted right then. Carbonation is a little high, i definitely recommend that you pour this one in a glass and give it a few minutes to ""air out"" a bit, but sometimes my thirst gets the best of me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think pretty highly of this one, but it's not a can't miss beer. This is just another IPA that leads me to believe I should invest in a tulip glass, but I can think of other piney IPAs that don't make me think this."
"o: Awesome beer, Nicely balanced get it fresh when you can."

""
"This beer is slowly becoming my number one IPA! And I love so many different ones. I only wish we could get more of this"
""
"Unlike some IPA's this beer leaves you wanting more. It has a nice hop profile without being overly bitter. It might be the best ""session"" IPA's out there. Definitely recommend this brew."
""
"A great beer with excellent harmony and an amazing freshness."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great IPA for the hop head. Pretty high level of bitterness. A little underhyped compared to others, but this is a solid, above average IPA."
""
"O - Ithaca has absolutely knocked this one out of the park. Very hop forward and aggressive, but the malts brings a nice balance. The tropical hop flavors are pretty impressive, especially coming from a brewery out of central NY. Insanely drinkable. I'm always on the hunt for Flower Power whenever I'm up in NY."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The strong floral character is definitely different! I can see the appeal, but I might have added just a bit of citrus hops to make the flavor more refreshing and less eau de toilette. Definitely worth trying."

Certainly a great summer refresher, and a tasty treat anytime.  Now I understand why this was on the BA top 250 list for so long, and only recently fell off the end."

"o: not sure if i'd rate it quite as high as everyone else, but this is good. if you want to know what people mean when they refer to cat piss/onion in a beer, id say give this a try...its not a bad thing. this has a solid East Coast hop flavor that is present but not in your face. the floral notes are a real treat too. grapefruit is really a star in here. i fear my bottle might not have been as fresh as it could be (still within the drink before month)."

"You smell it and think, ""Wow -- can this taste as good as it smells?"" And the answer is, ""Yes!"" If you love citrus (grapefruit) and hops and more hops and more hops, you can't go wrong with this one."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fairly balanced but complex IPA that does a nice dance on the taste buds. The flavor is not likely to survive beyond a single season, likely turning into a malt bomb with time. Drink up while fresh!"
"This West-Coast style IPA has flown under the radar for too long. Exemplifying much of what an IPA should be, it's time Flower Power gets the recognition it deserves."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well done IPA. This will be a staple for me now that I've relocated to Rochester."
""
""
"Edit: Had to re review this because I've had this beer on 2 occasions after this review and maybe my pallet wasn't as bad as it was a month or so ago...lol... Had several so called world class IPA's since and Flower Power stands strong with them and is easily in the conversation. Again, still not my top but for the availability of it and the price its an excellent choice. This latest one seems to have a creamier mouthfeel which I love but the overall clean crisp taste is still the same...Great."

"This is the juiciest IPA I've had thus far! As far as taste this is el perfecto! On-tap the malt was lighter, but in the bottle the malt perfectly backed up the hop. I'm crushing these! Simply put IMO-one of the best."
"Taste is lively hoppy bouncing flavor all over the palate - fresh orange, sweet mango, bitter grapefruit, slick deceptive malt backbone barely there, but shows up with a slight detection of sweet cereal. A lovely IPA - one of the best."
"Nice beer. More malt than I expected, but still a very drinkable beer. Will look for this again."

"World Class beer? Not in my book. Maybe I need a fresher bottle or to try this beer on tap to think World Class. Again, my bottle wasn't notched so I'm not sure how old this beer is. It was a good beer. I'll give them that. It did show promise of being something better. As of right now, I'm not a Flower Child who enjoys Flower Power on a regular basis."

"Bright orange amber color, and hazy with a large, white head, two fingers worth. Nose is super tropical with big citrus aromas – grapefruit, orange and lemon, but mostly grapefruit. There’s a little bit of grassy hops as well. The taste is magical. Bright tropical fruits are cut with just the right amount of bitterness for a dry and fresh aftertaste. Lots of grapefruit and a mix of sweeter fruits that I can’t really identify. The mouthfeel is amazing…it’s one of the smoothest IPAs I’ve had, even as it’s packing a big punch at 7.5%. There’s a good amount of lacing left on the glass as I finish and the head is retained pretty well. This is my new favorite IPA that’s readily available."
"Great yellow gold color with a fairly thick white head. Aroma is fantastic. I get a ton of earthiness from this beer; along with a ton of hops. Lacing is holding up fairly well. Taste is very nice as well. A nice dryness I don't expect from IPAs, but is enjoyable. The hop profile is clean and bright. Still loving the earthiness; it reminds me of the hills of Tennessee. Mouthfeel is slightly different, but like I said, the dryness is enjoyable. I find this IPA to be better suited for late Fall or early Spring, when it's a bit colder outside."

"Flower Power pours a hazy golden color with a small head. Their is a mellow dry floral hoppy aroma. The taste has a nice bold hoppy flavor. Strong hop flavors but still very easy to drink, nice mellow bitterness. Overall a very rich and full, high quality IPA."

"Poured into a snifter glass from a bottle. Beer has a light amber color with decent head, but disappears quickly. Up front citrusy taste fades to hoppy bitterness. The bitterness seems to hang on the palate. Overall a very good IPA. Smells even better than it tastes."

"Nose had some hop aroma, but the taste fell short. Drank more like a pale ale than an ipa. Solid body and mouthfeel, but lacked significantly in the hop aroma and flavor. Would pick it up if I was looking for an easy drinking pale, but for an ipa, I'm looking to perpetual from troegs."
"Best by June 2013. Served in Spiegelau IPA glass. Golden in the glass with quickly dissipating white head. Citrus and flowers in the nose, great aroma! Hoppy bitterness right out of the gate with citrus fruit and pine. Finishes slightly dry and bitter with grapefruit rind. Sweet caramely malt balances out the bitterness perfectly. A real east coast hop bomb! Medium body with light carbonation make this 7.5 ABV IPA easy to drink. An extremely well crafted IPA. Seek this one out!"

"Great floral aroma, similar to hopslam but a little more subtle. Taste was clean, not overly hoppy and the alcohol taste was very very tame for its percentage. Overall a solid beer, great alternative to some of the IPA's I have been drinking lately. Would definitely be something I could chill with for a while."

"This beer was fantastic! Hops and plenty of ’em! Poured a beautiful sungold color and had a quickly dissipating head with a slight bit of lacing. Leaves behind a medium malt body and lots of dry beautiful hops. The malt holds it up in the glass while the hops bite you. It has a big nose and smells great. A little citrus and clover honey on the palate and dry as well. This beer is dry hopped five times throughout the brewing process. It’s invigorating. The name is also very cool. This beer is on my list of ""I gotta have some of that."""

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade, caramel malt and ripe fruit. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy hops, caramel malt, and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and balanced. Amazingly delicious IPA."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice amber hue with a thick creamy head. Good retention and lacing. Aromas of sweet pink grapefruit with hints of piney forest. Hops is upfront and in your face with assertive mid-palate true-to-type bitterness finishing to a pleasant astringency. Mouth feel is a bit on the light side, but overall it's an excellent IPA. If you're a fan of classic IPA bitterness, try this. Going to pour another right now."

"This beer is defiantly in my top 5! The name sits well with it hoppy taste. The aroma of hops is strong same with the taste. The abv is perfect fir an IPA, strong enough to catch a good buzz and not over the top so it knocks your ass out! Every sip is as good as the first one, which is good when you have a whole case. I scored this beer in the higher end for the simple fact that i think everyone should try this beer at least once. Cheers from your friends in pittsburgh."

"Pours a hazy gold color with a good amount of sediment that makes its way to the bottom of the glass. Two finger thick white head. Smell is a lot of tropical fruit and earthy notes. Taste follows the nose for the most part, but with a lot more citrus and a bit of pine. I love the bitterness too. First time I tried this I think my palate was completely shot from what I was drinking before, but now all of these flavors are coming out. It's really nice. Mouthfeel is what you would expect from an IPA. Pretty light and crisp and absolutely refreshing. Overall, honestly this is probably one of my favorite IPAs. Possibly up there with Sculpin and Stone. I was really not expecting something this good."

"Trade from jrgratz. Thanks! Pours a sloghtly cloudy yellow with small head. Great grapefruit aroma with big floral notes. Very aromatic. Nice up front bitter with lots of piney bite. Citrus finish like biting into a grapefruit. Different from the west coast style but done just right. This is very good."
"This is a hop head’s dream. The bitterness I wish was slightly toned down, but there aren’t too many complaints. World class beer."
""
"O: This might be my ideal IPA. Light, dry, bitter, with just enough citrusy sweetness. It doesn't have the powerful nose or big flavor to stand up to the top DIPAs, but it's on a short list of IPAs for me. Really flavorful yet easy to drink. I'll never be unhappy receiving this one."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great stuff! Honestly this is the most ""west coast"" styled IPA I have ever had. The hops positively leap off of the soft, but firm malt backbone. This really reminds me of a slightly less aromatic version of Blind Pig IPA from Russian River, but if it was brewed with Citra hops. I highly recommend this beer."
""
"O- This is a hop-centric IPA. It's definitely one of the hop monsters that does it well. It's up there with Gandhi Bot, Heady Topper, and Sculpin. Hopped, hopped, and hopped again… and then dry hopped. It shows, but it also carries some balance and pleasant sweetness rounding it all out. Great IPA that is really easy to find and find fresh."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before May 2013. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, orange rind, floral, pine, tangerine, grass, light caramel, light honey, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pine, orange rind, floral, grass, light honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Good amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a solid malt balance and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. Very nice complexity and balance of hop and malt flavor; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected."

"If I find an IPA beer thats better I will just have to give it a 5.1 but as long as one doesn't drink a 5 every single day it should stay a 5. I am not going to wait until I die to give a beer a 5. I think 20 years of testing is fine."

"I had this beer last year when visiting family back home in Utica, recently was able to get more in a trade, so I thought I would review. Bottle date 2-11-13, so pretty fresh! Wow! Right away when I started pouring this golden nectar the aroma of fresh preserves assaults my nose, is it peach? is it strawberries? is it pineapple? It's such a complex nose it could be all three! The taste is exactly how a well done IPA should taste in my book, 2Hearted comes to mind. Overall a superb brew, pick some up, you will not be disappointed..."
"If you love pure liquid hops this beer is for you. If you like a full balanced beer tempered by a brilliant hop equilibrium, this isn't your beer. The malt and beer flavor itself is lost in the bombardment of piney, grapefruit hop overload. This should have been named hop tea."

"Straw color...firm white head....citric scents...this is a very American beer. The flavor is hoppy, sweet, and soft. Assertive hop flavor, bitterness, and resin-like earthiness. Bitterness is strong and lasting. Some yeast and fruit in the smell...peaches, orange peel, grapefruit, and melon. The beer is solidly hefty, firm of body, and enjoyable. Nice brew."

"O- The 1st time i had this brew i chose not to review it due to the fact i had sampled about 6 or 7 other IPA'S that night and my pallate was out of whack.

"This beer should be an Imperial IPA. It is in my top 5 IPA's and is so refreshing and goes down so easy, its scary. I live in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania where you can not purchase this beer yet, so a drive for it was worth it. It smells flowery but it is Citrus and Pine, with hints of grapefruit. All I have to say is I will be buying this whenever available, because in thirty years of drinking, this is truly one of my most enjoyable experiences."

""
""
""

"This is one of my favorite IPA's. It has an incredible explosion of hop aroma that I liken to apricots. Like others have noted, I have observed that there seems to be a shelf life issue causing it to lose its flavor and aroma if not fresh.

"Maybe my batch was infected, because all I could taste and smell was kale. This beer was recommended to me by the bartender, and I assume she tasted it because she steered me away from another beer she felt was too weak and recommended this one. I guess there's a slight chance a wild yeast got in some time after she tried it and before I did, because this was not a pleasant experience at all."
"This is a pretty good IPA, good flavor balance, hides its strength well enough, very drinkable. Pretty hoppy. Definitely a great representation of the style and worth trying."

The appearance and mouthfeel weren't as great compared to the smell and taste, but that is just a minor issue in my own opinion. Overall, a great IPA when fresh. Cheers!"

"O - I probably overdid my explanation in the M category, but again...this beer is extremely well-balanced, very drinkable in session form, and has the perfect amount of flavor, abv, and carbonation. I think this is where FlowerPower shines...it's accessibility. It's not too much for a normie, and just enough for a serious BA. I dig it and what it stands for.

"From notes, 8/22/10. Pours a nice dull gold. Mildly hazy. Good-sized white head. Floral and fruity. Rather fresh hoppy aroma. Tangerines/apricots(?), hop flowers, some pine resin, a little grass. It’s just not quite as strong as I’d like. A bit blandly bitter, particularly in the finish. A lightly sweet crystal malt flavor lurks below. This is yet another beer that I’d like to revisit in the future, preferably from a fresh keg. 7/7/11. Better than I remember. Fruity, floral hop aroma and very good flavor. Could have a bit more bitterness, but it’s nice and pale without any of the cloying caramel note that plagues many IPAs. It has some light stickiness. Pleasant beer."

"Pours dark orange with two finger white head. Smell is amazing hops, citrus, pine, pretty tropical.

"The beer pours a clean yellowed orange, almost like butterscotch, with a nice finger width rocky white soap bubble head on it. The beer’s body has a light haze to it, but displays a steady stream of bubbles racing to the head, and is really quite translucent. The beer’s lacing is not very noticeable with light to medium sticky clouds. On the nose, this beer is big from the minute you crack the lid. Even as it sits on the table in front of you, you should be picking up light wafts of orange citrus and pine. When you stick your nose in it, the beer smells like sweet pulpy orange juice with a touch of pine and a light caramel malt ghosting in the background. Hints of mango and passion fruit can also be picked up. On the tongue the beer tastes beautifully bitter and orange citrus. The beer begins with light malty notes before the bitters grasp the tongue and slowly ring juicy, pulpy, bitter orange juice onto the tongue, while a touch of pine works its way in. The finish is light with citrus and bitters and a touch of aspirin. The taste also displays lightly herbal saltiness, which is interesting and cool, reminiscent (to me) of the Floral IPA from Sierra Nevada’s Beer Camp, though it gives the herbal flavor far better than the Floral IPA. On the mouth, this beer feels clean and medium bodied on the tongue. It is extremely drinkable for its alcohol percentage, and leaves the mouth with a light bitter dry pucker that is just enough to encourage you to keep drinking. Overall, this is a delicious IPA that gives me my proper bitter bite, while smelling amazing and giving superb orange juice flavors, which isn’t as common of a thing in IPA’s. Definitely worth a try for the hop lover, and then worthy of a couple re-tries to boot!"

"Overall a very hoppy but still drinkable beer. I can see why people like it so much."
"O: The only reason I'm giving this a 4 than a 4.5 is that the carbonation was a bit flat. The mouthfeel just wasn't quite crisp enough for me. Nevertheless, this is a really good IPA."

"O:this is a solid fruity standard ipa I like it a lot not mind blowing but way better then average wish I could have this as a go to."

"O: I'd buy the shit out of this if it were readily available in my area. Honestly, however, I don't know if I'd seek it out, only because this supposedly falls off fast and hard. Still, this is very much a must try."

"This is a excellent IPA. The citrus and pine notes are more prominent than the floral notes, which does against what the name suggests but that really doesn't have anything to do with how good the beer tastes. The 7.5% ABV is extremely surprising given how this beer drinks. Definitely one of the better fresh regional(ish) IPAs."

"Slightly hazy gold with a thick, soapy head. Deep melon, perfume-like floral, citrus, peach, various over-ripe fruits, and pine atop a hint of toasted caramel. Solid wallop of hops on the tongue...heavy, spicy, pulpy orange and grapefruit, dried apricot sweetness, and green pine resin bitterness swallows up the bready malt. Medium, solid body with a good amount of snappiness that makes me go in for another sip and then chew on it for a bit. Very nice East Coast IPA."
""
""
"It is super easy to drink wonderfully smelling lightly bitter IPA. I’m jealous of you dudes that can get this regularly. This is a good'un."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great IPA. The aroma is incredible, the taste is solid. It's certainly a floral-forward beer, a bit odd in the taste, but quite nice."
"I don't usually buy growlers, because they don't seem like a deal on the one hand, and they don't seem to be better quality all the time either (quality depends on too many factors to get into here) but today is a special day - end of the semester - so eff it. The color is a yellow-straw color resembling a good lager, but more orangey. Good herbal, flowery, hoppy smell, but it is the taste that astounds. A wallop of citrus--grapefruit particularly. Pleasant hoppy bitterness. Excellent lacing throughout. Average mouthfeel. (I like a little more oiliness.) Dry finish. No discernible alcohol kick."
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent brew and possibly my favorite of style. A perfect representation of an American IPA. There was a bit of malt presence to balance out the aroma and taste, however, hops definitely dominated this brew. Body and carbonation were spot on and the citrusy and floral characteristics of the aroma and taste were awesome! The only complaint I have was with the appearance. Head retention could have been a bit better, ane the lacing was a bit lackluster."
""
""
""
"O: I'd love another and would be glad to buy 6 more. A great AIPA in the West Coast vein."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Still one of my hands down favorite IPAs. The hops aroma and flavor is outstanding with a ton of West Coast citrus character and herbal notes. If I could take only one beer with me to a deserted island it would probably be Flower Power."
""

"a damn good ipa, one of the best out of new york state. the pour is akin to a fresh hop beer, golden honey in color with a little hazy and a delicate tan head thats short and lacey. the nose is tons of puckery grapefruit and some tropical fruit as well, but the flavor gives off some pine notes too in the hop complexion. this is a very refreshing ipa, fruity but not sweet, light malt keeps the hops on center stage. its really bitter in the finish, but more like a fruit bitter, sort of tart and almost caustic in that citric acid way, but the feel is in fact pretty smooth. youd never guess the abv until you drink a few and try to walk to the pisser. mild but adequate carbonation and only a medium body, this is dangerously poundable. i love the citrus element in the hops, its different and its delicious. ithacas best beer as far as i am concerned."
""
"O: Just a near-perfect textbook IPA in every way. Loaded with big hop flavor."
""
""
""

"Overall this is almost perfect. Would love to see this in Mississippi."

"Magnificent IPA. Super juicy. Tons of hops and bitterness. Just what I like in the style! A real treat, wish I could get this on the regular! Gonna be sad to see this one go. :("

"One of my favorite IPAs is Pliny the Elder and Flower Power is not too far behind Pliny. It has a really fantastic aroma full of grapefruit and citrus. When fresh the taste is nice and dry, but when it ages a little bit it starts to leave a bit more bitterness in the finish and less pop in the start. I'm glad this one is locally available to fulfill my ipa needs. Not quite a Pliny, but pretty damn good."

"Beautiful golden amber with just a touch of hop haze. Lovely amount of lacing on the glass, and a thin covering on top of the brew. Smell is just great with a lot of pine and citrus. A healthy amount of fresh whole grain dough with a yeast signature sits on top of a toasted malt and grain melange. Taste is superb with a light crisp drinkability that belies the big hop personality. Malt follows the nose with a great combination of toasted grains and English style yeast fruitiness. Hops are all American while avoiding the cliche' over the top nature that is the downfall of so many otherwise great beer. This is a smooth brew with a perfect carbonation the lends itself to sessioning and early brunch."
"O - A solid beer. I will definitely buy this again. I'm disappointed I waited so long to buy a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - definitely one of the best IPAs I've had. I'm so glad it's reasonably priced and readily available!"
"This is definitely an instant top 3 beer for me and my new favorite IPA. The smell and taste drove me to write my first review here. Not much more I could want from this style."

"O: Love this beer. It's 1000x better when it is super fresh, and the one I am drink now is only about a week old. I'm glad this is easily available in my area, and I think it may be one of the best IPAs on the East Coast."
""
""
"Delicious and balanced, and highly aromatic. Super crisp and refreshing. Worth a try."
""
"O- A solid IPA, very drinkable, definitely worth picking up a six-pack of this."
""
""
"Yup....this is a delicious IPA. 7.5%? Really?? It is so smooth, I am loving this beer. I am glad Tom sent me 4 of them, although I am seriously jelous this beer would be available at the store always! I love the tropical/citric hoppy flavors and the bitterness is low. Biscuity malts play nice and everything seems to work in perfect harmony. I heart this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little light for so much ABV. Overall, it was good but I was hoping for more body and taste. On the other hand, I really like when IPAs throw the whole kitchen sink at you in the flavor department, I just wish it was more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ithica's Flower Power IPA does a great job at showcasing a variety of different hop characteristics all while remaining cohesive and drinkable. Spice, herbal notes, floral notes like the name would suggest, and fruity undertones come together masterfully. A great IPA to be sure!"
"Overall: I live 35 miles from the brewery I think this beer is a grand slam home run for Ithaca Beer Co. Probably their flagship beer and for good reason."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A pretty easy drinking and refreshing IPA even at 7.5 % abv. Slighly on the mild side in terms of hoppiness, but delicious none the less."
"o - very drinkable and quite enjoyable. solid all around and certainlyone of the nicer ipas i have tried. would love to have this available in michigan."
""
""
"O:  Overall, a well done beer.  Not amongst the elite in terms of IPAs, but very good and certainly something Id drink again.  "
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is excellent. A touch more sweetness after the swallow would make it other-worldly, but as it is, this is definitely a top-tier, world class American IPA. One of the best in its class. Those of you who can buy this year round are lucky people. Highly recommended."

"Growler from Oasis in Hopewell Junction. Pours beautiful, frothy head over a clear golden body. Retention is nice and initial lacing is pretty. Mouth is crisp and fresh. Some fruity, piney hops are up front but balanced well by the malt. You feel the hops but not too much. A really great IPA."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp, smoother than most good IPAs. Goes down very easy. Oneof the better IPAs,"
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is creamy and viscous; best mouthfeel of the style IMO. When this stuff is fresh, it's phenomenal. And remember: I don't like Single IPAs! :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good IPA but never lives up to the hype for me. I've had it a few times on draft and wasn't blown away so I wanted to wait to have it in a bottle and give it a proper review. To me, it's a middle-of-the-pack IPA."
""
"Overall: The strong point of this IPA is that its not over the top bitter like most american IPA's. This really adds to drinkability factor while still having great hop profile. Nice job Ithaca!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I should emphasize that I had this fresh from a growler, which may have really helped with the bright fresh hops on the nose. Not sure how this would be from a 6-month old bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really good American IPA which hits all of the good hops notes and drinks much easier than its 7.5%. Thanks Pat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My only complaint with this brew is you absolutely have to drink this beer fresh, or that sweet citrus smell is replaced with sweet malt. It just disappears. And, that sucks. But, if you can get you hands on this while it's fresh the aroma and taste will take you away. One of the better east coast IPAs for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is delicious! It has great flavor and aroma. The hop character is superb with just enough underlying malt presence to keep it balanced. It's easy to drink, not too bitter, and the ABV relatively well hidden. This is definitely worth a try."
"Thanks schwartzoid for this awesome extra!"

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a night light golden, with a 1 finger white creamy head. A few small streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma was floral and citrus, with a bit of piney bitter hops. Nicely pleasant smell. Taste started off a bit herbally, and then finished up like piney hops. Felt good in the mouth, coated as an IPA should with a bit of tingle from the carbonation. Overall a pretty solid beer. Nothing to really detract."
""
"O: Need I say anymore, if you're an IPA fan and haven't tried the Flower Power I ask with all sincerity..what the fchuck are you waiting for?? When I find a better readily available IPA, I'll write about it. Yet I don't think that will be anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I loved this beer and wish it was distributed in my area. If it was, I would buy this very often!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been drinking too many west coast and Colorado IPAs the last few years. I think the western crowd should pay attention to what other brewers are doing with the less intensely bitter style. Ithaca, Southern Tier, Dock Street-- and Epic in Salt Lake. More flower power!"
"Picked this up at Consumers in the Buffalo area. Pours a dark, clear amber orange. Smells amazing, hoppy and floral like. Picking up citrus notes in the taste, with some pine and floral like hops. Drinks down incredibly smooth for being 7.5% and I have to force myself to drink this slowly so it lasts longer. Definately one of the better east coast IPAs around."
""
"Clear copper color with a razor-thin head that leaves light lacing on the glass. Smell is grapefruit and pepper with some light floral notes. Taste is grapefruity and bitter with a touch of resin and a dry, aspirin-like bitterness in the finish. Feel is fairly light with a biting carbonation. Overall very well-balanced for a hop-forward beer."
""
"price point - $2.25/single 12 oz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Softly carbonated with at most a medium body, very creamy but it doesn't stick on the palate at all. Alcohol is a bit high, pushing up against the imperial style, and as such the drinkability suffers slightly."
""
""
"originally reviewed: 01-05-2011"

"D: Lives up to its flowery name, and floral IPA's are too far and few between. A good beer perfect for the spring season."

""

"This was a pretty good IPA, not really among the best I've had but overall a flavorful easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good IPA. We are lucky in that there are a lot of good IPA's around. This beer is in the upper tier. The smell was a little light, but the flavor is very present. I like this grapefruit/citrus IPA. Ithaca did a pretty good job."
"Overall: This is by far one of the best everyday IPAs you can have. I can drink this all day especially followed by a good cigar. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"this is one to have in your frig, nice color smells well balanced with hops and floral, taste the same, a really drinkable beer, will get more when i visit Julios in mass, next to heady, zombie dust and the furious this will be one of my favs, need more flower power"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium amber color with a medium white head that quickly faded to a thin white film. Nose is full of hops - hence the name. Love the floral aroma. Taste is surprisingly sweet, considering the huge hop presence in the aroma. Also some pine and citrus. Medium-heavy mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic, balanced IPA. I will definitely have it again."
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good. This taste pretty fresh, hop wise, and slakes my NW style IPA cravings well enough, but the somewhat dirty flavors of malt and fermentation lead me to believe this one would fall off in a hurry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm in love with this beer. So far it's the only beer I've found worthy of buying a case of without breaking my wallet. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just not very interesting. Maybe the bottle was not too fresh and/or the serving temperature was too cold, but I'm just not feeling excited about this one."
"o - overall, one of the better local(ish) ipas. always nice to have this one fresh and whenever ases show up in the stores this is a go to 6er for the fridge. I hold this beer in high regard, was kind of surprised to not see a bottle review on file. Love this one. Worth seeking out if you don't get it. East coast IPA goodness."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic IPA crafted only a few hours from me. Awesome beer, pick it up if it's fresh near you."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- thought this was one of the better ipa's i have ever had. Just a well done beer. Was lucky enough to get a log of this for my kegerator and couldnt be happier ( or hoppier...sorry). Will always look for this beer when in the mood for an ipa."
"o: a drinkable and refreshing session IPA but not one i'd seek out."
"Overall this is a decent IPA very good especially for a year round offering from the east. It is just slightly below NN in flavor and appearance, but still very good."
"Very rich. Ordinarily, it takes a double I PA to get my interest. I live in Ithaca and have taken a blasé attitude to our local product. On my way home one evening, not wanting to stop at Wegmans to pick up a six of my favorite, I stopped in at the home of Ithaca Beer and bought six of Flower Power. Turned out to be a very pleasant beer. Hoppy enough to satisfy me, and I am a hops freak. Most surprising was the nose. Due to youthful hay fever, I pretty much couldn't smell a barn if I were standing knee-deep in horse shit. This beer, though, comes through with major fruitiness. ABV 7.5, it's enough, but not so much you can't enjoy a few. Give it a shot ..."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good IPA overall. Good citrus and grassy characteristics in the nose and flavor without being too bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the variability of the nose. This set high standards for the tasting. Upon sipping we were met with a wildly bitter beer, which held up throughout. We do wish, however, that the flavoring has remained to the end. We felt that it prematurely petered out, leaving room for a more watery finish. All in all, this is a tasty beer, and an expertly crafted bitter guy, which is hard to find. We just wish that the edges were a bit more refined, and things were better rounded out in the flavor department."
""
""
""
"I dedicate this review to all of the haters who claim that they will not be purchasing Ithaca's products after getting shut out at the Le Bleu release on Saturday. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer is delicious. Make sure to get it fresh, because once the hops fade the fruit becomes too much for me."
""
"O: solid IPA, but not a whole lot of hop flavor. I'm a bit unimpressed. Can't blame it on the growler - I drank it just 6 hours after it was filled."
"T: One of the better IPAs I've had. Huge grapefruit pith, orange rind and pink grapefruit flesh with a nice caramel malt backbone. Finishes on a bitter but clean note. Extremely drinkable. I want a lot more of this."
""
""
""
""
"O-I drove through three towns to taste this after a conversation with a bartender who tipped me off about the availability. Well worth the trip. And just in time - 3 pints and I kicked the keg. I did not drive home, by the way. A must have if you like this style."
"Beer is medium in body and really nice on the finish, strong and complete with a nice body and a moderate bitterness on the back. Mostly pine hops but a wonderful little IPA here. I'd drink this every day, seriously."
"O: I have yet to find an available IPA in my area of NY that is on par with this one. Have already had a six pack of this and a growler. Can't wait to try this at the brewery or a bottle that is less than a week old as I hear it enhances the drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"The big win for this beer is the taste. Lots of juicy citrus hits you right up front, grapefruit, tangerine, maybe a little pine, the malt comes in the middle, and then you get hit with just enough bitterness on the finish to make you want more. My absolute favorite IPA from the East so far. If you are a fan of West Coast IPAs, I suggest you give this a try. An amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
"what this beer lacks in appearance and texture, it more than makes up in aroma and flavor. one of my favorite locals and i believe is a year round beer now (not just spring seasonal), this beer deserves more recognition."
""
"Overall: I'd buy this ipa again but it doesn't quite wow me. It reminds me of Green Flash West Coast ipa but not quite as good."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer but not the best IPA – it was foamy and soft rather than crisp. But I recommend it nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very tasty beer. An IPA like this is right up my alley. Love the cascade and simcoe hops."
""
""
"Pours a light golden amber with a four finger bright white head. Great head retention with abundant lacing . A bold floral aroma accented with citrus and pine. Initially my tastebuds were flooded with grapefruit, mangoes, and bit of peach followed by piney hop bitterness which transitions to sweet malt with a touch of banana and then finishes with piney hop bitterness. Pleasant mouthfeel. Fairly medium bodied with a heavy malt backbone, more reminiscent of a DIPA than a pale ale. Plenty of carbonation, creamy smooth brew. This brew definitely lives up to its reputation. Very enjoyable and complex."
""
"The body is light with prickly carbonation. Overall a nice offering. Wouldn't mind grabbing this once in a while."
""
""
"Definitely a palate ruiner- I tried Brew free or Die IPA afterwords and couldn't taste a thing. Enjoy Hopheads!"
""
""
"Overall an excellent IPA. Exploits the hops quite well with a great balance of candied malt. I must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Major points for aroma. Everything else made it a solid and drinkable IPA. It would be great to try fresh at the brewery."
""
""
""
"Cost: $10.99 for a six pack."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink and very refreshing - definitely a session beer and one that we all often get when we go out and want something easy to find and dependable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely more of a west coast IPA, reminds me of Union Jack with a bit less malt prescence. Its not balanced at all,I would like a touch more malt. The hop extraction/flavors are pretty awesome though. Very tropical and bitter."
""
"overall an enjoyable IPA that I will happily drink again."
""
""
"I plan to give this beer another shot but for the time being, this is all I have."
"M-clean and crisp, what more can you ask for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was my first brew from Ithaca - being from michigan I had heard rumbling of Flower Power but its not available here. It was a very good IPA - I'd definitely have a sixer or two of these in the fridge for some easy drinking."
"Overall: Mid-light bodied with a good balance. Another classy IPA. Glad I got a 12 pack in a trade! The mouthfeel is awesome. Cheers!"
""
"O: Nice beer. Definitely something I will go back to but not the greatest thing I've ever had. Good example of an IPA and something I would recommend."
""
""
""
"O: This one was very well done. Very nice, juicy hops and pleasant drinking. Will be getting a sixer soon. One of the better IPA's I have had and an excellent aroma."
""
""
""
"Having it again at Kent alehouse in Brooklyn. Actually really like this...mire candy hop than I remember. Much better than before. Not sure if its my palate that changed (likely) or the recipe but i did it."
""
"Wow...really nice beer. Hoppy like a good IPA should be then really complex and unique with a mixture of bitter and sweet fruits, followed quickly by a soft, malty sweetness. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In my early days I am sure this would have had too much bite for me. The sweetness and bitter blend make this an excellent IPA experience, and I will come back for more of this. There are just so many to try, this is probably my favorite IPA, and thankfully it is easy to find.  A staple, always some in the fridge."
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, best by May. Pours a bright orange red, with a 1 inch sticky head, with awesome webby lacing. Smell is tangerine, pineapple, mango, grass, and grapefruit. Taste is very balanced, tons of citrus up front with grass, grapefruit, and pine in the finish. Body is great, plenty of life, medium body for the style, little dry, and very drinkable. This is one of the best and for a reasonable price and a freshness date. Wish it was in N.H. This might be the best single IPA I have, Green Flash WCIPA has competition, with a better price and a freshness date."
"O - I was looking forward to trying this beer because I had heard good things. I was a bit disappointed, but it wasn't terrible. I will seek a fresher bottle because I have heard the flavors change quickly with this beer. The best by date is three months from bottling so this one was at least two months old."
"O-a nice solid IPA"
"O- I love this beer, it is one of my favorites now, however it does not pair well with most foods for me so I can't really have it with a meal. Only food I've really found goes well with it so far is spicy mexican."
""
""
"All in all, an excellent beer. Wish they could pack this much flavour into something under 5% ABV!"
""
"O- good beer. A lot of hoppy smell which I love. Very enjoyable ipa"
"O: OVerall, I am glad I tried this beer and glad my husband received it from BIF. It is very different - not in a bad way but in a bewildering way."
"The hops are great in this beer. This would be a go to daily brew if I could easily obtain it. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice, crisp IPA. The floral notes are just right and the balance of this beer is wonderful. A very enjoyable beer for sure!"
"O: This is a well made beer, but certainly not my style of IPA. The hop profile is way too dry, floral and earthy for me (I suppose, hence the name?) While it is a solid beer and I can appreciate it, I probably would not have this one again."
""
""
""
""
"A northeastern gem. Great IPA."
"Overall, it's been a few months since I had this beer and forgot how much I enjoy it. Very topical, full of flavor and easy to drink. An excellent American IPA I can't wait to break out on a warm spring or summer day. The major downside for me is its kind of one dimensional with the mango/tropical hops."
"This is one of my favorite IPA's. It has an amazing flavor that keeps me drinking without pause. Ive seen some unfavorable reviews lately and wonder how fresh those BA's servings were. If you see this stuff get it and then tell me where you got it cuz my source just ran out!!!"
"Overall: I'm really glad I got a chance to try this beer. It's a really nice IPA and a great first offering from this brewery."
""
"Overall this has let me down. I specifically hunted down a six pack to see what the hype was all about, and am glad that I didn't buy the case. I find this to be an average IPA, but it seems to lack depth to me. It tastes like water mixed with some hop bitterness. Will not drink again."
"o - decent ipa but lacked a little bit of a hop punch."
""
""
""
""
"o: Hands down, one of my favorite IPA's and favorite beers for that matter. Floral, sweet and at 7.5%, it has knocked me over in more ways that one and raises the bar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would drink this all the time if it were available here. Great flavors and aromas make this a benchmark for all IPAs in my book."
"Verdict: Damn fine IPA from Ithaca Beer Co. Earthy hazy meadowy hops, nice dry bitter finish. Drinks a lot like a big American Pale Ale. I could definitely enjoy a few of these on a nice sunny day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Look, there are alot of ipa's out there to enjoy. Each person likes a certain style of ipa, super bitter, super sweet fruity, hoppy and malty etc etc.... This beer is all of them to a extent, one of the most balanced ipa's ive ever had. Its got enough hop kick, enough malts, and decent price to make it one of the best ipa's ive ever had. Remember, if your looking for balance this is your ticket, if you want hop crushed, look for a double ipa. World class beer right here."

"Overall, this is a well crafted IPA. I thought this was somewhat like Two Hearted actually but with a slight bit more malt. I'm glad to have tried this and won't hesitate to buy it if I'm out east."
""
""
"First time, decent hype on this, after pouring and smelling I see why. Foggy orange appearance with avg. head. Smell is flawless, floral with almost pollen like dustiness, musky pungency and some sweet citrus. Flower power is an appropriate way to describe the smell. Taste is also very well balanced. Pretty bitter up front with a clementine finish, bitter aftertaste. Pretty light body, perfect level of carbonation. Could smell this one all day, taste is bitter and juicy. This should go down as one of the best in its style I have had. Very distinct from the others."
"This is a really enjoyable IPA with lots of juicy citrus and pleasant bitterness. Really, really good."
""
"This is a great IPA! Very close to a Imperial but stays just under that classification. This is should be on the list for top IPA's."
""
""
""
""
"I want more! A very solid example of the style. I love IPAs and this is no failure!"
""
""
"O: Not sure if this is the best IPA I've had, but it's definitely among the top, along with Founders Red's Rye, Smuttynose and SN Torpedo. Great stuff from my home state. Cheers!"

"O: Very nice IPA for a hop head. Has a dynamic blend of hops that does produce a sort of floral overtone, but not enough to name the beer flower power. I'd say the best you'd get in terms of flower aroma would be a dried out rose or lilly, bought at say, michaels or ac moore. I enjoyed the effort from a brewery I'll probably be seeing more of soon."
"O-This is really an excellent AIPA, in my book it might be on a a par with Celebration..."

"Enjoy!"
"Big thanks to my boy caSSino for bringing this one to share with me! Served from bottle into a NoDa Brewing snifter. Poured yellow orange with a half finger off-white head and subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine, caramel, tangerine, citrus hop, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, citrus hop, tangerine, and orange peel. It had a medium feel on the palate with a medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was REALLY nice and balanced. It was very potent with citrus and fruit notes which was very nice. The flavor was more of the same with more of the fruit presence taking charge. A well done brew that I'm glad I've finally gotten the chance to try."
"Overall, this is a very nice IPA. I wish the flavor were as awesome as the aroma, but it was still good."
"Overall is excellent. I like this more than Pliny, but maybe a little less than Heady Topper. If the numbers don't reflect that, oh well...reviewing is inherently subjective."
""
"O: This could easily be a go-to beer for me. Very nice. I'd definitely love to enjoy some more of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid IPA that really smooths out as it warms up. A really spot on amount of hops. In my opinion, it's got a too much of a forward grapefruit taste that makes it a bit too bitter for me. I still really enjoyed it but it's just not my favorite IPA."
""
""
"If I had to pick one IPA to drink forever....well, that would be tough, but this would be in the running! Perfect for a hot summer day!"
""
""
"A delicious IPA. I wish I could stock my fridge with this stuff."
""
""
"My favorite IPA. Unfortunately all other IPA's have come up short to this one. Very Hoppy, Great Aroma, nice citrusy grapefruit flavor. I prefer the grapefruit flavor of IPA's, that is why I like this one best. Not Malty, Very Hoppy--exactly the way I love an IPA. Get this beer if you get the chance, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I have to say I was hooked on the first drink. I had never noticed this in my local bottle shop until a few weeks ago and I had to pick it up due to the amount of attention it has received. No disappointments here."
"Overall, I'd probably consider this in the Top 3 single IPA's I've ever had. I really need to get my hands on more of these bottles."
""
""
""
"O: Overall this a great IPA. Something the east coast can really stand behind. It's affordable, readily available, delicious, and refreshing."
"I can see why a lot of people rave about this beer. Personally, I don't think it's much above average. The hop profile is a little weird, but good; my only real complaint in the mouthfeel. Perhaps as the result of the relatively high ABV, this really tastes too heavy and wet, given the flavor profile."
"Overall, a nice and refreshing IPA from Ithaca. I could see this really being a nice beer to have during those hot summer days."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Pours a bright orange into my imperial pint. 1 inch of soapy white head sits atop the brew. Quickly disappeared leaving an abstract lacing around. Aroma is all hops with citrus sprinkled in every now & then. Taste begins with a lemon-y bitterness and finishes the same. Not too impressed overall. Mouthfeel is mediocre, has medium carbonation. 7.5% is well hidden though, and I could see myself drinking a couple given I had a few. Slightly above average beer, but would opt for a local WI brew over the Flower Power."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The whole is greater than the sum of the parts with this one. The beer is not overly attractive from an appearance standpoint. Mostly the taste and aroma combine to form a beer that is at once delicious and very drinkable"
"Very good east coast IPA. Tons of bursting flavors make this very enjoyable."
"D: super vibrant and flavorful AIPA. definitely one of my favorites. just bright, fresh hop flavor that every IPA lover looks for in a good one. pick it up if you can find it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty damn good IPA my only complaint is that I feel it lacked balance just a touch and I thought the malt did take away from the hop profile just a bit"
""

"Overall- I did not enjoy this beer at all. I actually poured half of it. It's not that it was terrible, it was just not worth the alcohol or calories when I had a lot of better beers to get to this night."

"I’m a huge fan of this one out of a fresh bottle and the draft version is even better. Not to be missed."
"O - Great Great IPA, definitely enjoyed this brew very much!"
"have had this beer on numerous occasions and am finally getting around to reviewing it. this beer pours a golden yellow color with a nice white head that lasts. the smell is wonderful citrus and piney hops. the flavor is very hoppy nice citrus notes. the beer is light on the palate with good carbonation and a nice bitter bite. overall one of the best american ipas out there"
""
""
"thanks to jmpizzo for this extra! ok it pours a orange transparent color with some yellow hues and very nice 1.5 finger creamy head on top that shows nice retention. the aroma is very fruity, with pineapple, mango and some touches of piney resin. not much of a malt backbone in the nose. the taste is very fruity again with much more pine and hop bitterness also the malt comes through and plays a very supporting role. the sweet citrus shines initially and then the middle is of subliminal malt, the finish is extremely bitter and refreshing. very nice body on this and the carbonation is on point. overall im feeling a bit under the weather and i hope i didn't short this beer but i will say i enjoyed it very much with average expectations that were exceeded. big ups to joe."

"Pours a nice deep amber color with a decent head. The hop aroma is pungent and tasty smelling of citrus. I love hops and it is in each mouthful from start to finish and tickles my taste buds. Nice crisp mouthfeel without being chewy at all. One of my current favorite IPAs and a credit to the good folks at Ithaca Brewing. Also, thank you to Olivers for keeping this available for growler fills for the last month."

"This is a very good IPA. But then again, there are so many good IPA's out there, I feel it is getting hard for them to actually be very distinguishable from each other. I think allegiance and support really effects people's reviews."

"Overall- A good beer. One I will defiantly buy again."
""
"Overall: I have enjoyed this beer many times before and many more in the future."

""
""
"D - This is an IPA that focuses on aroma and hop flavor first, just as it should. The fruity hops dominate in the aroma and while the beer pretty much tastes the way it smells it also has some peppery complexity in the flavor profile. The malt is sufficient to balance things out and keep the hops from becoming overwhelming, but it keeps its head down and allows the hop character to take center stage. Very nice."

""
""
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is oily in the feel but contains a pleasant blend of hop character that kept me interested throughout the entire experience. Easy drinking with a low alcohol impact, I would have this again."
""
""
"O: A great IPA, beers like this remind me why I love the styles so much."

"Overall this IPA surprised me. We carry it at work and I always thought the artwork was stupid and the price for a 6 pack outrageous but it is quite a good IPA."

"Had a bottle at Mosaic in Astoria. Poured a slightly hazy orange. There was a wonderfully fruity citrus aroma that opens the flavor, but the beer gets a touch thin in the middle. A great clear grapefruit note that finishes the beer out. The hops character is clean and sticks with classic American flavors for a big, rich IPA."

"Great floral smell that invites you in to taste a beer with some serious hops. outstanding initial taste that finishes nice and smooth. relatively hard to get ahold of however so if you have the chance to try this i recommend that you do not pass it up."

"O: Hops are on display here which makes the name ring true. Very good IPA."

"A pretty typical American IPA that pours semi-unfiltered into a pint glass. The taste is mostly sharp Earthy hops with a slight hint of lemon zest in the aftertaste. Finishes with high resins on the palate and just a little citrus fruit. Mouthfeel fades quickly and doesn't leave much of aftertaste. Don't know how old this bottle is (the label was notched drink by January) so the freshness might have faded a little but not yet cloying. A good IPA, would like to try it fresher."

"O: Good beer! Sometimes IPAs can let me down, but this one was nice. The floral notes are definitely somewhat unique to this beer, given the other IPAs I've enjoyed. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more Flower Power!"

"Overall this a great IPA with lots of nice floral hop bitterness. Get this as fresh as possible and you won't be dissapointed. A beer I will revisit again and again!"
""
""
""
"Bitter even by by IPA standards. Not much malt at the beginning. Smooth malt start--almost creamy. The swallow initiates the bitterness which lasts long into the aftertaste. The body is rich but the carbonation provides a good balance to the mouthfeel. Simply put, this is one of the better IPAs I've ever had."
"Hazy, light golden with a 1.5 finger head. Pungent hop aroma smacks the nostrils. Grass, lemon, orange zest. Taste is a great balance of hop and sweet malty backbone, lingering bitterness coats the tongue. Very drinkable. This is a top-tier East Coast IPA."
"O- Was really looking forward to trying this. Solid East Coast IPA with some West Coast flavors (biased, sorry bout it). Good, not great."
"Overall, I'd definitely have this again. I'd love to have it perfectly fresh, but this bottle is still very tasty and I'm loving every sip."
"It's got a good sticky feel with a light to medium body. A very good IPA."
"yes - exceptional - this is one of the best citrus hopped beers out there - it's great from the bottle but it really rocks on tap and from a growler - snappy/hoppy/zesty/crisp/tasty/ complex/well-balanced/ and easy drinking - what more could you want?!"
"O - I like this beer. It has the juiciness that a lot of the great IPA's have. It is a very easy drinking beer and quite refeshing."
"A top notch IPA especially for a year round offering. Will definitely be going back to this one."
"O. Excellent Ipa, this is always kept fresh as a staple in my fridge. I have had many batches and will tell you that it will vary from batch to batch from more floral and sweet, to piny and bitter. However, it never disappoints."
"A great fun ipa what more can I say."
"Overall (4.0): This is an incredibly solid American IPA. I won’t go so far as to say it’s excellent, but it is great and I’m very proud of it being a local brew for me—definitely tout it as a must-have regional beer. What can I say? Flower Power rocks and it should be a staple in your fridge if you like hops and you’re in the region."
"Mouthfeel -very drinkable, the alc. shows up in the finish. All in all a nice IPA. Thanks or the extra."
"Overall - I can't believe this one is 7.5abv. One of the nicest smelling IPAs i have ever had but not the best tasting. Overall a very great offering, i can see why this beer gets hyped!"
"Overall this does not disappoint. Hoppiness is showcased; flower power is an appropriate name. I like IPAs and love this one, will definitely buy again and recommend for someone looking for a good one; hops and hops and bitter and great."
"Overall: I have enjoyed this thoroughly each time I have had it. After burning through a six pack, I can safely say it is an IPA I would go back to. The grassy notes in addition to the standard citrus hoppiness makes it just a bit different and interesting."
"O - A very nice beer. This is somewhere between an IPA and a DIPA but drinks like a pale ale. The flavor is very tropical and sweet. I was amazed to find this at a hole in the wall shop in Springfield, I hope this means that it will be a regular in the area."
"Great IPA"
"Very solid IPA that I wish was distributed to Mass. Glad I picked up a sixer when I got the chance."
"O: Overall super tasty fresh heady IPA. Really enjoying this one. 4.5"
"Pours a light golden hue, cloudy. Honey like color. Lacing apparent the whole way down and the initial pour had a solid 2 finger head. Citrus pine aroma with strong floral qualities. Also some melon in the aroma. Sweet malt base is hidden but apparent. Strong hoppy taste up front bringing out intense resinous qualities. Bitter grapefruit and citrus qualities with some tropical fruit complexities. Well varied hop taste makes me want more. Finishes balanced with a little malt sweetness, but this beer is all about those juicy fruity hop qualities. Well carbonated with a medium bodied mouthfeel that's easy to drink. This is a great beer gaining popularity for a reason. One of the best east coast IPA's and one of my most frequently purchased. I'd say it competes with the best."
"D - This beer was a pleasant surprise, I love big bold hops and this one delivered for sure. This beer is still really good bottled, but shy's in comparison to fresh off the tap!"
"overall, one of the best IPAs brewed on the East Coast. Borders on DIPA territory. Very flavorful yet easy drinking. a beer I would buy regularly."
"Really dug this one -- tons of hoppy flavor, but everything stays in balance and it's really easy-drinking."
"O-Great IPA. Ithaca managed to make a hop-heavy IPA with that's very smooth and easy to drink. Bravo Ithaca!"
"Color is medium honey with a modest frothy white head. Smells strongly of fresh citrus and light pine. 'Well-balanced' IPA, if this oxymoron exists. Taste is mainly hops with enough malt to not make it overbearing. Can easily enjoy a sixer over the course of an evening. One of my favorites from Ithaca, a brewery I've frequented from the early days."
"Pours a bright cloudy gold. Good sized head. Persistent. Smell is fantastic citrus hops. Deep and rich citrus smell. Oranges grapefruit and lemons with herbal undertones. Taste is bitter throughout. Some underlying sweetness- but the hops dominate. Citrus again- bitter grapefruit. Herbal. Lingering pleasant bitterness. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Easily drinkable. Really solid IPA. Absolutely nothing to complain about here. Great stuff."
"D: Very drinkable and one of the most flavorful single IPAs out there"
"Poured from a growler into a pint glass. Pours a very pale, largely transparent gold with a generous 2-3 finger crown. Very forward, yet subtle and mild hop nose. The taste is hoppy but clean. It's not a tongue scorcher. Some mild citrus involved. Little to no pine. Mouthfeel is sticky but thin. It coats the mouth, but not for long. There's a mildly bitter aftertaste that lingers, but it's pleasant. Overall, this is a marvelous IPA."
"Pours a cloudy gold/orange hue with a nice thick head. There is ample lacing as you consume the beverage. The aroma is incredible with hints of pineapple, grapefruit and other citrus fruits, and floral scents. very bright and vibrant. The taste does not disappoint at all as it matches the aroma. Very balanced, no boozy alcohol heaviness despite the relatively high ABV. Great big bouquet of hops. The only thing that is less than perfect on this is the mouth feel - it leaves your palate very dry, unlike the very superb & most exceptional IPAs."
"O- Thanks a lot, Bill! This is one of the best single IPAs I have ever had. The balance between the floral and citrus is amazing. I am going to seek more of this out in the future."
"This is a really solid beer, while I enjoy the Hop-nuclear warhead-bombs that are out there, this is definately a great everyday beer."
"Golden hues shines in mt glass topped by a small off white head with plenty of staying power. Scent of citrus dominates the nose. Light caramel tries to balance the taste but this critter still leans bitter. Mouth is light and slightly drying. Lacings rings the glass. Even a west coast ipa would blush."
"Damn, I wish the finish didn't come along and diminish the experience a bit."
"DELICIOUS, FIND IT!"
"O- This is a really good IPA that I wish I could get near me, thankfully I got a 6 pack so I have enough to drink for a little while."
"As of 2013 this beer seemed to have changed deinfitely not the same world class hop explosion it was when I originally reviewed. Good but not great on par with two hearted which I think is a good solid ipa but amazing, not so much. Still give this a try but since the brewery expanded and changed brewers this ipa is no longer my favorite...sad : ("
"Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy orange with medium head and lacing, decent head retention. Aroma is lemon zest, citrus, and strong grassy/herbal notes. Very good smell. Smooth, easy drinking mouthfeel. Big juicy citrus hop blast is followed by aforementioned herbal taste, and lots of pine and resin. There's plenty of malt backbone. Easily one of my favorite and most balanced IPAs that I've had. Too bad it's not distributed here but I'll take it where I can get it when I head out east."
"Overall: A hop heads paradise in a bottle. One of the better IPA's that I have tried. Thank you beautiful Ithaca for this brew :)"
"Notes: Looks like an IPA, has the Citrus profile of many West Coast IPAs without the Pine Resin complement. This is a fantastic beer, so juicy, so aromatic, so tasty. Will definitely be a regular in my fridge from now on."
"O- This was a great IPA with plenty of tropical notes. It was a bit sweet, but I would love to try this when it is really fresh."
"Bought a 6-pack as soon as I saw it in MA, the best by notch was Jan. (3 months away). I'm not sure of the freshness but it was pretty different from the tap. Still big tropical but it was more bitter and piny, less bright fruit, which I actually liked a little because it toned down the sweetness. I thought it was great from the bottle but I thought the tap was a little better."
"Really great balance and amazing hoppiness. Best east coast IPA i've ever had. So kept in check and great layers of hops, love it."
"Drinkability: wow, just wow. This is an amazing beer. That is all."
"Overall: Great IPA. With the pineapple theme running in this brew this actually reminded me of what an Imperial Gumballhead would taste like. As both FFF and Ithaca have limited distribution, this may not have occurred to many people, but the two beers have a lot of similar flavours. Great, unique and appropriately named IPA. Recommended!"
"Best I.P.A. I've ever experienced. Came highly reccomended, and did not disappoint. The taste is what puts this beer over the top; it's like an all-out assault of delicious hops attacking your taste buds...in a good way. If there's any better I.P.A. out there, I haven't encountered it yet."
"Pours a hazy orange/gold color with about a centimeter of foamy, bubbly, white head that stays around for an impressive amount of time. Smells of piney hops, fresh citrus (lemon, grapefruit, strong orange), and other faint, grassy herbs. Tastes similar, with an emphasis on the hops and citrus. There is a very faint, and quite peculiar, soapy aftertaste though, which only slightly detracts from an otherwise great beer. Mouth is crisp and bitter, with the hops definitely making themselves known. Carbonation seems spot on. Overall, a great IPA that is worth seeking out. I'd love to get my hands on some more of this."
"O: Pretty good beer but not the best example of an IPA, the maltiness comes through much more than any hops that are present. I had this almost a year ago on draft and would like to try this fresh again to compare."
"big thanks to mjtiernan for sending this as an extra. pours a light orangeish yellow color. has a full finger head with big clumps of lacing. big citrus smell with a ton of floral in there. taste is everything you would expect, big grapefruit taste, perfectly balanced. mouthfeel is a surprise to me. i thought something so hoppy smelling would be dry and bitter. this one however is crisp and smooth with a full body that doesn't dry out your mouth. and just a slight bitter to it that doesn't last long. this has got to be one of, if not the best, ipa's i've ever had. gonna have to trade for more of this!"
"O: this is just a gorgeous beer and despite the many other IPAs I've had, this perfectly named beer reinvented the style for me and showed me something brand new and fresh. I really can't get enough Flower Power!"
"I am very pleased with my first beer from this brewery. I would actively seek out others from their lineup judging by the quality of this IPA."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Nice foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, pine, and herbal hops with slight malt and soapy aromas coming through as well. Taste is of fresh citrus zest, pine, and herbal hops with a nice malt backbone. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA with a very nice hop aroma and taste. I am glad I got to try one of these."
"Delightful to finally have this beer here fresh and beautiful."
"O- This is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer, especially due to the fact that it is not as bitter as some other standard IPA's. I love the aroma and herbal/citrus flavor, and I especially love how balanced this beer is. Would definitely be able to drink a case of this easily."
"While I can find all other Ithaca offerings with complete ease, this one has always remained elusive. Glad to have the chance to finally try it, and I look forward to refilling my growler on the next trip, Cheers!"
"1362"
"O/D: You'll almost wince due to all the hops, but out of pleasure. One of the hoppiest, and enjoyable beers I've had on tap. I think I'm still tasting hops from it."
"This is an exceptional beer. Full of citrusy hop flavor and everything I am looking for in a good IPA."
"Just what an IPA should be...the epitome of freshness...was able to have this at several intervals this summer, my favorite was 3 months from the bottling date. Also had a side by side tasting with Two Hearted just to make sure this beer was really as good as I thought it was. It is. Floral, and I mean super floral, hop flavors EVERYWHERE...and the citrus is there as well, mouthfeel is full but not sticky or overly resinous, just refreshing as hell with a perfect amount of carbonation. Hazy bright orange color with beautiful white head. Malts provide the backbone and not too much else while so many colors of hop flavor explode on you at different times. Can't say enough about it."
"Drinkability/Overall-This is my go-to IPA and has been for some time now, I can always get it fresh and its flavors never disapoint; a class IPA all the way"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral hops cones with light bittering notes and some light citrus as well. Taste is a very pleasant mix between some floral notes with whole hops cones notes with solid semi-sweet malt base. Bitter notes are not too heavy. Body is full with good carbonation. Really well brewed with nice notes of floral hops with well balanced bitter notes and semi-sweet malt bill."
"A very tastey beer during a rain storm."
"Pours golden-orange into my Lost Abbey stem. Big, fluffy, egg-shell head. Looks really nice. The nose is a tame blend of sweet malt and fruity hops. Smells exactly like a toned down version of Jai Alai (or this bottle isn't as fresh as when I have had Jai Alai). The taste is very smooth, mild fruity, flowery hops balanced very well with what tastes like crystal malts. Not super hoppy, but it's definitely there in a way that opens up nicely when warm. Let's not get carried away though, this is not an elite IPA, but a good one. Mouthfeel is very nice, medium body, reasonable carbonation. Overall, I would drink this a fair amount if it was distributed to me and I would trade for a bottle, but not a 6'er. Some IPA's I like better are Blind Pig, Columbus, Duet, Furious + Wet, Sculpin, Jai Alai. That said, it is pretty comparable to Jai Alai and a pretty good beer."
"Pours a nice clear golden amber with a fluffy white head that reaches up to the top of my pint glass and leaves a thick lacing along the side. Nice, strong smell of apricot and grapefruit with a light malty sweetness. The taste picks up where the aroma left off, with a nice refreshing burst of juicy, citrus hops. The middle is much more floral and pine with a grassy and resinous bitter finish. Difficult to tell how much of the fruitiness comes from the hops and what exactly the yeast is contributing, which has a slightly British quality that gives off some nice, subtle fruity esters. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, very dry, refreshing finish and low carbonation that lets the flavors really stand out. A great beer that guys down easily and quickly. For people like me that tend to have a bit of beer ADD, this one is drinkable enough and complex enough to be able to have a few."
"O- Awesome."
"Nice fruit and citrus zest flavors with a subtle sweetness. Crisp on the tongue and just enough bitter hops to dry out the mouth. A solid fruit forward IPA that I am glad I finally got to try."
"O- Decent IPA, a little to malt forward for my taste, but a nice change after drinking mainly RIS for the past week. Enjoyable but would not seek out again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"poured from a bottle into a snifter glass, color is trypical, golden copper, a couple findgers worth of frothy, off white head rises up and quickyl falls leaving great lacing on the sides. I don't know how old my bottle is, but the aroma is good, maybe a bit subdued, but wonderful cirtus smell with a touch of pine. The actual taste is sort of opposite, more pine and less citrus, maybe even a bit grassy, sweet at first then the bitterness really gets you. Carbonation seems about normal for the style and mouthfeel is good, really dry at the end. I had this on draft at Churchkey in DC a few months back and while I didn't take notes, I remember thinking it was very good, and the bottle didn't disappoint. It's a solid IPA."
"O- Very nice beer, well rounded and tastes great!"
"Very tasty beer and the floaties and nuttiness are the only drawbacks but this may be my favorite IPA from the Northeast."
"O: I'd put this up there with some of the best IPAs I've had. The downside is the disappointment that the taste doesn't match the hoppy nose, but it certainly isn't anything to sneeze at. A bigger tropical fruit presence in the taste would easily put this up there with my favorite IPAs (Alchemist IPA, Sculpin, etc)."
"Picked up a case of this based solely on hype. It was three weeks old at the time so it was pretty fresh. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Chunky billowing head lasted the entire glass. Yes! Nice piney, citrusy scent, very hopped up. I could smell it across the kitchen after the pour. Delicious flavors slightly weaker than the smell. The aroma was the best part. Easy drinking and medium on the mouthfeel. I could put down two no problem. A good basic IPA. Almost lived up to the hype."
"Overall - As I said, IPAs on the maltier sid aren't necessarily my cup of tea, but that this beer does it quite well. To be honest, the taste of this beer wasn't what I expected based on the smell. The aroma had me thinking I got another sweet tropical fruit bomb with subtle malt presence, when the taste was more of a mix between a tropical fruit bomb, a strongly malty IPA, and a citrus & pine bomb. That said, I'd gladly drink more of this if I got it or lived closer to the brewery. Definitely a must try for the IPA drinker, I'd say."
"Overall: It’s been a long time since I had had this beer and I really enjoyed it the second time. Great aroma without an overwhelming bitterness that a lot of west coast IPAs tend to have, not that I’m opposed to that."
"Overall this a go to IPA that would drink anytime and would seek out."
"Cheers!"
"What a great IPA. I'm indebted to the guy for his recommendation. Looking at this beer next to my absolute favourite IPAs and it's on par with the best. Drinkable, fresh, flavoursome and complex. I didn't expect it, but this is definitely one of the best IPAs I think I've had."
"SkÅL!"
"O-this is a fairly complex IPA. I'm impressed with how good it is with out too much of a hops flavor to it. it is extremely drinkable. it really rides the border of standard IPA and double IPA. I really want to try this fresh on tap, i think it might make the score even higher. i really wish i had found more bottles of this."
"O: Flower Power is a great IPA. With an assertive hop presence yet a malt backbone to keep it all in line, this beer really lets the flavors shine. Should be sought and savored. Good job, Ithaca!"
"O - would love to try this more fresh. seems very well put together. alcohol is well hidden but a bit strong so couldnt do a 6 pack...maybe :P"
"Overall, this is a fine brew, a perfect example of a restrained but not boring IPA."
"very solid citrus and rich broad sweetness. well hopped... great when fresh.didn't expect so many fruits and it comes forth as a citrus bomb. nose is dryer with hints with a floral pine dominating. palate is sweet orange with a bitter bite of orange peel. pineapple and mango touch that is crisped out with the bitter. great beginning to end on the palate. and nice bright and equally fruity as savory balance."
"If you're in the mood for a hoppy, citrusy IPA...this is a winner for you! I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"O: Not bad but I expected more. This bottle could have been a bit on the old side. someone needs to send me a super fresh bottle."
"O - This reminds me of Bells Two Hearted, but actually bitter. Considering this is at least 3 months old (presumably) and still very enjoyable, I'm excited to eventually try one fresh."
"This beer has a great balance and a distinct, unapologetic hop bite. If I didn't know this had just been shipped to me from the Northeast, I'd think I was drinking a San Diego IPA."
"O- Not bad, but not the hop bomb I was expecting. The name of this beer is certainly fitting, as floral hops are the dominatating factor here. I prefer my IPAs citrusy and bitter and this one didn't quite do it for me. Glad I had the opportunity."
"this poured into my sam a pint glass, it at first poured with a 3 finger thick frothy head, that subsided to a thin layer of bubbles, that left lots of lacing. the color is a nice light copper that thins out at the bottom of the glass. there is a thin bit of haze in it that seems to fade with the color as you travel down the glass. the smell on this is all floral and citrus, it smells like heaven, probably the most appealing part of this beer. light malt and mild bitter but still citrusy hops pull the flavors of this beer together light in body i could see this being a session beer if i lived up north. this beer a little tingle, not like some ipa's ive had but it wasnt bad and it seems to fit the body of this beer more so than if it was a more pronounced hop forward beer. overall it was good and a nice beer that i could see myself drinking again, may not be the first choice but its on the list."
"I poured this beer into a snifter glass, it has a nice golden body with a 3""white creamy head to it, that last a long time. The smell is floral and dominant of hops. The taste is very well balanced, a little sharp to begin but mellows out a little bit. I get a little citrus and hop taste also. The mouth feel is awesome and overall this is a great beer."
"Some beers are so light-bodied they can be slugged down regardless of how they taste, others are so robust they can only be sipped, but Ithaca Flower Power falls somewhere in between. This beer might be the epitome of a medium-bodied beer. Sure the palate is robust, but the palette itself is smooth and the body has the perfect weight that it's not too heavy."
"O: a nice ipa although the abv is rather high. Had been wanting to try this, thanks tim!"
"The Rest: Medium bodied, but held back overall by a somewhat unpleasant finish."
"Drinkability: This is a perfect American IPA that I would love to duplicate in my own brewing efforts. Good for those up in New York who have quick access to this cheap, refined, archetypal offering."
"D - I remain impressed with this beer. It's as good from the bottle as on-tap. Glad it's available here in Pennsylvania."
"Overall not one of my favorite. It's ok. Not A- worthy though."
"Poured a hazy orange color, with good thick creamy head of white foam. Some lacing observed. Hoppy, pine smell, strong and inviting. Floral notes. Taste is a firm bitter hop that hold throughout without becoming overbearing. Smooth IPA. Bitter finish but not with a lingering aftertaste. Overall very good."
"Overall - I think I'm harsh on IPAs. This one tastes good, but there's not enough body to carry the flavor."
"This is a solid IPA that I wish were readily available to me."
"Good beer, well crafted, but no symphony in the mouth or creative leaps."
"O: This beer is surprisingly drinkable, considering the intensity of the hop flavor and the abv."
"O - For those that love mega-hopped IPA's this one is a must. The balance may go a bit overboard but it is a pretty awesome beer. I'd seek this out again."
"overall this is an awesome ipa i will be buying many more"
"This beer poured out as a lightly hazy orange yellow color. The head was pretty fluffy and white looking. The lacing was strong on the glass. The smell if citrusy and floral, very lively aroma. The taste is hoppy and has a really nice floral earthiness, balanced with some lemony melon flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, lightly carbonated. Overall this beers got a good drinkiblity to it and I feel it's a very good IPA."
"o - a great IPA, With the name. Flower Power I expected it to be lighter and more citrusy. Once you adjust you realize that this is a very good beer."
"O- A nice IPA with a ton of flavor and bitterness that doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer. The aroma draws you in and the flavor doesn't disappoint."
"There's a part of me that wants to detest the gimicky beer name. But the floral character makes 'Flower' relevent, and the 'Power' is understated but relevent. But this beer wins out regardless of the name."
"Damn good IPA, highly drinkable."
"O: This beer seems like the sum is better than the parts. Excellent true to style IPA with lots of hops. Great to enjoy on a cooler spring or summer day. Really enjoyable all around."
"I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed Ithaca's Flower Power IPA. If you like your IPAs well balanced, yet not overly malty, and loaded with tons of peach and nectarine flavor, then look no further. Flower Power is the real deal."
"O (D) - A very nice IPA. Original, interesting. its good."
"Overall impression: A hop-forward, very drinkable IPA. Definitely in the East Coast style. This is a refreshing and enjoyable beer. Hops are in charge but well done so as not to impact the quaffability (is that a word??). Glad to have tried."
"O - This is simply a great beer. Maybe my favorite on the East Coast. Will be going back to the brewery to pick up a keg of this in the near future."
"Bottle dated ""best before August"" 2011, don't know what that means for bottle date, but I'm guessing this one is pretty fresh. Poured in my dogfish head snifter, pours a dark transparent light amber color, with nice fluffy head that fills the glass. Wow. This is a beautiful looking IPA. Smell- this hit me the second I got the cap off. Hardcore citrus, orange peel, pine, tropical flavors. Pot? Yes, maybe this smells a little like pot. Awesome- this is maybe the best smelling single IPA I have ever smelled. Taste- big pine, hardcore bitterness from the hops, matched by a nice malt tropical fruits sweetness. The finish is crisp and bitter. Mouthfeel- nice, medium bodied, not syrupy at all, appropriate carbonation. Drinkability- the abv is there, but in a good way. I don't see being able to pound this (nor would you want to- it is to be savored), and ultimately I think this runs a very fine line between being a single or a double IPA. Overall it is just awesome. If I could, I would have it in my fridge year round."
"First review from my phone, my wife is here meeting with a colleague while I did this."
"Overall : A quality representative of I.P.A. I really enjoyed this beer and would try it again"
"A good brew that I will continue to enjoy."
"Flower Power is easily one of my favorite IPAs, and one unfortunately I only see around the spring time. It's more flavorful than many of the other ones on the market and achieves an almost picture perfect balance between bitterness and flavor."
"The alcohol is sneaky in this as it can be felt but not tasted at all. This beer is easy to down in large quantities since it's so easygoing and nicely crafted for the style. It doesn't quite match up to its counterparts from California or the East Coast and that's not a bad thing since this stands out fine on its own. Those lucky enough to try this will certainly feel groovy for stumbling upon this beer that pairs wonderfully with Spring!"
"O: Another easy drinking IPA. Great for spring and summer, and will most likely catch up on you quickly because of the well-hidden 7.5%"
"Pours a dark golden color with ruby red red highlights. Has a 2 finger white head with very little lacing. Big aromas of grapefruit in the nose with hops jumping out of the glass. Very nicely balanced, with a hop bitterness that is not too overwhelming, that starts strong in the front and finishes a little easier. Dry taste, with little caramel notes. Bitter after taste. Very drinkable IPA, definitely a strong candidate for one to keep in the fridge on a regular basis."
"D: I prefer citrus flavored hop more than earthy flavors but this beer is enjoyable and I could drink a few in a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied - super refreshing and easy drinking. Overall, this is just a great IPA and I wish I could obtain it easier!! Very glad to have finally had the opportunity to try it, thanks Lum!"
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation (helped by the etched glass). I would pick this one up frequently if it were distributed in my area."
"Overall-Ithaca nailed this one. Big floral aroma and taste. Too bad I can't get these in Tx, but will be drinking more of these tonight at my stag."
"O: I love the aroma, but the taste is a slight step behind. Still, a great DIPA. However, it doesn't change my top 5 DIPA list."
"0 ~ Yummy!"
"Overall well done but always better fresh from the tap."
"O: Second time I have had this beer and wish I could get it around here. A solid IPA that doesn't really have any flaws, solid all around."
"O-Overall this is a solid IPA from Ithaca. Well balanced and easy drinking."
"O/D - Very nice beer. I like good malt presence in an IPA and this beer fits well there. It has a bit of sweetness mixed with the bitterness in the finish which I thought was really nice. Glad I have a couple more on hand to enjoy."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is really excellent and really fresh tasting and nice. The bitterness is really nice as well. The hop malt balance here also tastes great."
"O - I enjoyed this beer, but i don't think it lives up to the hype. There are way to many awesome IPA's in California to rank this in the top among them. It was a good IPA, but not as well balanced as i hoped."
"Great local India Pale Ale, should be a staple for all New York beer drinkers. Bitter in the right ways, viscous, well hidden 7.5% Alcohol By Volume. This is not a super premium drink, but a great, cheap go-to choice for IPA drinkers in the area. Folks at Ithaca do good work. Would want one of these outside on a hot day."
"This is by far one of my favorite IPA's. I would by this by the case if it was more availible in my area"
"Drinks too easy, great AIPA, reminds me a lot of Hop Slam"
"Overall, this is a great beer. American IPAs are one of my favorite styles... mainly the west coasters but this one I will definitely remember. If you see it on tap or in bottle anywhere and you are a hop-head, certainly give it a try."
"I've had this bottled and on tap. Pours yellow-orange with a small white head. Floral hops on the notes with pine accents. Complex taste with the floral hops mainly up front, some citrus and spice in there, and a bready malt finish. Lightly carbonated. Light-medium mouthfeel, and crisp and drinkable. Not extreme at all for an IPA."
"O- Very nice. I would love to have this again."
"Overall excellent hoppy American IPA"
"Overall this is almost a perfect example of an IPA. Ithaca really brings it with this one, it lives up to the billing."
"Overall this was easily one of the most sessionable IPAs I have ever run across and really one of the best tasting. I am glad I got this and it was worth the wait."
"Overall: a very solid ipa from ithaca. although i think it is bordering a dipa it is great and i wish it was more readily available fresh"
"The smell just about knocked me out: it's called Flower Power for a reason, as the hops smell like flowers more than...hops. It has that same punch-in-the-face aroma as Nugget Nectar, where the hops are fresh and aggressive on both the nose and tongue. Great stuff."
"O: Delicious. For IPA lovers, this beer is a must."
"Overall - It was a good, not great, IPA. It was a great nose, but a little weak on the taste. I thought, though, it was very crisp and refreshing."
"UPDATE (4/24/13): snagged a fresh bottle yesterday and quite pleased with this beer. No cat piss odor, just a fruity smooth IPA. Very well done."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp carbonation bite on the tongue. Overall, this is a very enjoyable IPA. Although it's unbalanced, it's refreshing and goes down easily."
"O: I really liked this beer. It was an IPA that satisfied me with its juicy fruit hop character and balanced malt profile. This is a beer I could drink for a while. Great stuff."
"Notes: This American IPA is very well made and brings all the hop power and bitterness of a Double or Imperial IPA."
"Overall, I'm glad I traded for a sixer of this. I haven't had anything quite like it, an I've definitely had my share of Anerican IPAs. Solid brew."
"D – Very drinkable brew, great blend of malt and hops. Very easy for me to drink more than one of these. I would for sure seek this brew out again. Big thanks to lovindahops for this one. I recommend this brew!!!"
"Mouth smackingly good, bitter and focused with a true bite. Amongst a line-up that included Mongo, Big A, Hopsickle and Idiot IPA, this one stood out (I did grab a mongo growler to go)."
"Light to medium body, slick and oily with some minor carbonation tickling the tongue every now and then. Fairly easy to drink as the alcohol doesn't show up in the flavor or in the mouthfeel. A solid IPA, though it may have more pop in the aroma if the bottle had been fresher. May have to try to track down another newer bottle in the future and try it again."
"Incredible aroma. This beer achieves a fantastic and lasting floral hop aroma, but the bitterness was much less than I expected after smelling it. A great beer, but may disappoint those who like really bitter, resiny IPA's. One of the best aroma's I have ever seen come out of a bottle. If you want the smell of a Green Flash, but don't want that many IBU's, this is your beer."
"I will get it again, buy it again, and drink it again... its just not as good as I thought it was rumored to be."
"O I would recommend this beer and buy it again."
"O: This is a great beer recommended by a friend at a tasting, picked up a sixer and will definitely love everyone of them. This could be my year round hopslam"
"D- A very fun take on the IPA, very easy to drink and will return when able to!"
"So East Cost does have some hops!?! I am now a believer of the Flower Power. I think I will be leaving this one on my wants list for sure."
"Respectable, but I was rather disappointed with the simplicity of the flavor. I'll confess to being sensitive to bitter, but I just don't get much beyond it in this beer. Particularly disappointing given the lovely intro provided by the appearance and smell."
"It's pretty in the glass with great head. Slighly cloudy. Mild bite. Ithaca has proven once again that they can produce high quality goods."
"Bought a fresh 6 pack yesterday I grabbed a bottle and poured it into a pint glass. It gave me a nice two finger head that stuck around and laced its way down the glass as I drank the brew. The beer itself was a clear copper in color. The hops were up front in the nose citric and piney. The flavor was what I expected hop forward but with a underling malt sweetness. A good IPA balanced and drinkable the carbonation was spot on for the style. It had a medium feel in my mouth so it was filling to the tummy. I will drink it again from time to time now that I can get it."
"Well, at 7.5% it's a real easy drinker, and a nice IPA, just wasn't as good as I held it up to before I tried it. I would try it again no problems if there weren't new alternatives... all-in-all a very good beer, just not groundbreaking."
"O: This is, without a doubt, the beer that makes me glad to live near and work in Ithaca, NY. This is my go to beer. If I need to bring a six pack of something to a party - this would be it. I'm grateful I can get it whenever I want."
"This Ithaca brew pours a medium amber brilliant in color and capped with a brilliant soft billowing head that stays around and even laces thicker than most IPAs I have had. The smell is a blossom of resin, pine and citrus which is above my expectation. Upon my mouth this beer flows easily to easily with a sweet citrus beginning to a pine core and bitter dry ending. I like this complex IPA and its twist on the now crowded IPA category. The mouthfeel is just right and now I will have to try to make this growler last a little longer. Ithaca has a home run with this single IPA."
"O: A good beer, glad I made the purchase, but I do wish it was more like the samples I had at beerfest last night. The sweet hop flavor I had there was reminiscent of Heavy Seas Loose Cannon."
"I'm never sure how I feel about this beer. I like this more than out of the bottle, though. It does the tropical fruit flavors better than most, but it really tastes different than most IPAs. Well-made, though, without a doubt. Just not the kind of IPA I tend to go for."
"Overall: Yep, I would happily serve this to any of my friends. Excellent beer."
"I suspect this beer was just a touch too cold as I wasn't so into it at first but as it warmed it really started growing on me."
"Much respect for the bitterness, although it's not as fruity as I'd guessed it would be based on the aromas. Piney, yup. The hearty malt profile- more bready than sweet- may or may not be stifling the hops a bit. The malts linger as much as the pine, which for my personal taste detracts from the ""rememberability scale"". Still, a tasty brew that I'd recommend trying."
"Overall: This was a fresh bottle. I can see how others may think it is mediocre of they acquire a bottle that is a little dated from my previous experiences with this IPA. It is one of my favorites and if you ge the chance to have it fresh jump all over it! It makes a world of difference. This East Coast brewed West Coast Style IPA can hang with the best of them."
"O- This beer is exceptional from pour to finish i need barrels of this beer all year round..cheers!!"
"OVERALL: B+/A-"
"The alcohol is well hidden in this brew so beware, other then that a solid well made beer thats sure to please."
"I really enjoyed this one. I am a West Coast guy so it's really nice to try what the right coast is doing. Thanks to tsblack05 for this one. Highly recommended!!"
"It was back and forth with the flavor mutations. Each sip showing a different angle, focusing on changing ratios of what the ingredients offered. Flower Power is one of those beers that takes hold of my imagination, toying with it, to my delight. Oh, we will meet again soon."
"The cask conditioning here brought both positives and negatives to this, as it nicely opened up that beautiful full hoppy nose on this but also brought out the more aggressive aspects of the hop profile in the taste a bit too much. Overall though, there was definitely more to like than dislike here, as this remains a very solid IPA in my eyes."
"medium darkish amber with a cream colored head that holds and leaves lace. nose is perfumy. floral hops on top of some piney and tropical fruit notes and a nice, sweet, caramelly malt backbone. pretty standard concept, but executed very well. taste is intentionally lopsided with a big floral character leading the way, and a healthy amount of bitter that comes in about half way through to open up the taste buds for a little pine and a lot of balancing malt sweetness. medium body starts soft and ends dry. overall, a great beer. one of the northeast's best easily available ipas. always excellent on tap and a great way to cure the hop jones. another winner from ithaca."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I was not too impressed with this IPA. It tastes as if it didn't age well, even though I drank it before the best-before date. It has the usual IPA qualities of being filled with hops, citrus and caramely malts. But they just seem aged, old, rotten and skunked."
"O - Solid brew, good looks, smell, and taste. Don't know if I'd go out of the way to trade for it again, but I'd make this a regular buy if it was available locally."
"D- easy to finish. id drink this at the times im craving something on the more floral side. if thats not for you, then stay away. if you dig them, check it out."
"D: This seems very drinkable for 7.5%. Would probably be best at colder than cellar temps. I still doubt this beer is very hoppy fresh or that exceptional imo."
"drinkability: very solid IPA, a little balanced but mostly a hop bomb. would seek and drink again"
"The CPJ"
"The reveal - Ithaca Flower Power. I know I've seen this on the shelves when I've been back home in Ohio. I'll be picking up a 6er of this the next time I find it."
"Thanks Mike for this one."
"Taste is perfect for a double ipa. Smooth, crisp, super fresh taste. I absolutely love this beer! I can't believe this is my first time trying it."
"D- I could drink a six of this without loosing interest."
"D - Good drinkability, can't taste the alcohol. Very solid brew, but I wish it was more evened out, as the finish is what makes this beer get all around 4s from me."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Been wanting to try this one for a while, so I had high expectations. I've got to say....I wasn't let down. This is now definitely in my top 5 Ipa's easy."
"D: One of the best examples I've found. This particular IPA hits on all cylinders and is right up my alley. Will seek it out all year round."
"D: Great beer. A solid IPA with a complex hop flavor that's very smooth and easy to drink. Glad I picked this up on a whim."
"I would have another. This is one of the most well-balanced IPAs I've ever had. Citrusy aroma, earthy bitterness, floral balance at the end. This one has everything. I didn't have any preconceived expectations here, but it blew me away."
"Medium bodied for the style, just a touch of rawness and bite to it. Drinkability is world class, have to remind myself it's 7.5% and not something I could just drink one after the other even though it tastes good enough to do exactly that."
"Drinkability:Even though it sat in my cellar longer than it should have (3 months), the hops held up really well. What a fantastic IPA."
"Damn, this is one tasty beer. One of my favorite regular IPAs, and possibly my favorite from the east coast. Just a delicious beer. Enjoying every minute of this one."
"Edit- After having the rest of the six pack I had to bump up the drinkability, this beer is incredible."
"O-> Scary how drinkable and smooth this is. I would dare say sessionable/quaffable even with the 7.5% ABV....I slugged three without even blinking....Cheers Ithaca!"
"d: Nugget Nectar and Flower Power in the same month, what more could I ask for? For a 7.5% abv IPA it is very drinkable."
"This is certainly at the more aggressive end of the American IPA spectrum and is darn tasty."
"D- Fantastic. at 7.5% even better. Great IPA."
"Fresh from the brewery served chilled in a pint glass this beauty shows a clear light amber color with a modest white head but very nice spidery lacing. The aroma offers classic citrus/cat piss type hops with a slight brussel sprout edge. Nice. The flavor brings a more flowery hop but still carries plenty of pissy bite. Delicious. It has bright orange-grapefruit and as you go there is a fair pine edge with a biscuit idea to it as well. It's medium bodied, slightly syrupy but plenty drinkable. Carbonation is tastefully light. This is just a classic IPA that should satisfy any hop lover. I give it a solid ""A" and would welcome this refreshment on any occasion."
"This is a great IPA. The hop profile is great, and gives this brew a nice assertive bitterness. I would have to say that if you are a true hop head/beer lover you would love this brew. This is not a brew for a beginner. This was another excellent brew by Ithaca."
"Drinkability: A truly superior IPA and perhaps my new favorite. It is full of expressive hop flavors and is still quite drinkable despite an assertive bitterness. Certainly not a beginner's brew, but something that I think would appeal to all true beer lovers."
"D. Thought this was exceptionaly drinkable and could easy knock back a few in a night. Very refreshing and the great flavors from the hops make you want another sip dare i say gulp. Highly Recommended"
"Thanks to bumpkinbrewer for the bottles! Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a hazed pale orange and golden with copious off-white super-lacy head. Delightful orange, resin, tangerine and general citrus aroma. Flavors are right there with the aroma. Bright fresh floral and pungent clementine and sour orange peel citrus. Brisk, grassy and fresh. Nicely balanced with the right malt profile (not too much crystal malt). Medium bodied; slightly syrupy. Medium carbonation throughout. Decent, yet unspectacular IPA although quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: Goes down very well, although a bit basic."
"This is a really solid and highly drinkable brew. Every aspect of this comes together to create a beer worthy of it's (modest) hype. There's a good chance I'll still be making that trip to PA for a case of Flower Power."
"D: Just amazingly drinkable, fresh is best of course. Great balance and complexity."
"D- Too bad this one isn't around for very long! I wish this was an all year long beer! Fantastic and fresh! NY does it right!"
"Matt"
"This is my first bottle of Flower Power and I am certain it will not be my last. I have been looking for another 7-8% IPA to add to my fridge rotation and I think this is it! Bravo!"
"D - The drinkability is strong in this one. The alcohol is hidden well and the amount of bitterness that's left behind is very manageable. I'll be sad that I won't have any more in my fridge after this next one, but I think it's time for another!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Could definitely have a few of these. Wont overpower your taste buds (if you drink IPA's), but also wont leave you wanting..."
"D: Man, I'm not usually an East Coast IPA guy, but this is an outstanding beer - geography aside."
"D: This beer is quite drinkable considering all of the hoppy flavors and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"D = A pleasant surprise in the crowded world of IPA's. A very easy drinker with just the right amount of complexity to make it intereting. Friendly enough to pull in the novice IPA drinker to experience something new."
"Each sip evolves rapidly from a very sweet, very floral burst into a milder citrus and light malt body. There is a lingering sweetness from honey which is gradually balanced out by soft, buttering dryness on the tongue. Flower Power is crisp and clean, with nice citrus, floral, and fruit flavors from the cocktail of hops used in the boil and used to dry hop the beer. It is very refreshing since it focuses on the aroma and flavor characteristics of the hops rather than oily bitterness which many IPAs tend towards when they get hopped up a notch. Definitely try this one out on one of the remaining summer afternoons."
" I just had a Green Flash West Coast IPA and even though its not as pungent and bitter as that this still some of the best east coast IPA's like Dogfish Head 60 minute."
"This is just a solid IPA that I would enjoy again for sure. I now have gotten down with the growler Flower Power to the bottle and yeah they were both fantastic. I like what Ithaca did here with a complex IPA offering."
"D - I could have a couple, but it would not be my go to choice for IPAs."
"This beer pours a light golden orange color with an alabaster froth on the surface. The aromatics are strongly of fresh fragrant floral hops a touch of citrus notes along with it. Upfront the taste seems rather abrasive, but it smooths out near the end. The problem is that the hop bitterness leaves that woodsy taste lingering on the back of the tongue. This is a good and rather drinkable IPA, It's good when it's fresh, I wish there had been a better balance of flavor and hop, but all the components are there. Enjoyable beer, one of the better IPAs on the market."
"one of my fave ipa that you can get year round. It may not be the gretest ipa but it is the one i go to most often. Beautiful color, nose and taste. It is the perfect summer beer. Very citrusy , slight bitter after taste. At 7.5% it's very drinkable. I highly recommend eating a soft pretzel with this beer = heaven"
"D: A really nice offering from Ithaca. This can stand up to the West Coast hopheads any day."
"A very, very good IPA. I could drink these all day. I wish I had more access to it."
"In closing, I love this beer. If I had to drink one beer only for the rest of my life, Ithaca Flower Power IPA would be near the top of the list. I'm glad it's a New York State brew, thus giving me regular access. Please try it, and enjoy"
"I only wish that my bottle had been a bit fresher. It was still within the freshness date range on the bottle (thank you Ithaca for making it legible) but I am sure this is outstanding right after bottling."
"I was taken aback by this awesome IPA. It wasn't much to look at with very minimal head, but it exudes grapefruit awesomeness in the smell and taste. It's high ABV is well masked by all the citrus hoppiness going on. It's got an extra-medium body to it due to a very very low carbonation. Great beer, happy to have it."
"At 7.5% this is a bit more than sessionable but it tastes like a session beer. Crisp. Refreshing. Nowhere near hot with alcohol. No particular flavor punches you in your taste buds. Enjoyable and fresh!"
"D: I had high expectations going into this session and it did not disappoint. I think I'll go back to Schneider's and get some more before they run out!"
"I hate to do this, but it is just so apropos- this is Pliny light. Yeah, I said it. It taste good, I would buy a lot if I lived in NY."
"D: I love this beer, i am glad its a year round offering now and i intend to drink it often. If you have access to Ithaca beer i suggest you give it a shot. It goes down well with little biterness and at 7.5% very easy to drink. This has become a new fav. for me."
"Taste, good hop mouthfeel, hid the alcohol nicely. Was very similar to a citra pale homebrew I had just before it. Ample pine flavor. Extremely floral aspect to it (could be psychosomatic from the name). A straight forward, inspired by west coast ipa that does a decent job at mimicking a style that trend wise is still getting its feet wet on the East Coast."
" Cheers, Joe"
"A pretty solid IPA however you pretty much have to trade for it. Great flavor and not too boozy."
"Drinkabilty is high on this one."
"So far I'm three for three with my IPA voyage, each one making me wish they were available in my area. Flower Power is a beer that seems to be gaining popularity, and as a wonderful example of the style, it's easy to see why."
"Drink- I'm noticing the rest of the country has caught up to CA. I don't think I am a homer. Very nice IPA from the east coast."
"Tastes like it smells, only less acidy and more flowery. Green flowers, the kinds that drip with sap. Like, pinecone flowers. The malt is better, too, more biscuits and less syrup, and the whole thing goes down like a nitrous haze."
"I had forgotten that these are bottle conditioned, when I poured the last bits into my glass I started to get the bready taste some people describe, but that's purely from the yeast you just poured into your glass."
"D: Nice and drinkable could swig a few of these before I feel em."
"M/D: High marks here as well. Easy drinkin' and would definitely buy this frequently if it were available in my area."
"Drinkability: Great example of a ""piney"" IPA. I would buy it again, but would most likely drink this with food, something BBQ'd or spicy. Alone, it ruins my pallet in a good way, I wouldn't be able to taste much after 2 beers."
"Overall: This is kind of the epitome of IPAs to me. Very evident hoppiness, which I like, but kind of one-note. Not terribly interesting."
"Many reviewers have mentioned this beer was better on draft. I will have to keep my out for this one on draft."
"Final Thoughts - A very good IPA. Would purchase somewhat regularly if it were available to me. It still tasted pretty fresh after a couple months so I'd be curious what a 1-3 week old bottle would taste like."
"Not too slick/oily, goes down way too easy for 7.5% Abv. This is a nicely crafted IPA. The unreal nose perhaps let me down slightly in the taste department, but this is still one of my all-time favourite American IPAs. I'll try my best to stock up on this when possible."
"Overall, I put this up there with my favor IPAs. This might be a surprise to some but this is a tasty brew. Ended up buying a 6-pack of it in their bottle shop aftewards but odds are not as good as the fresh stuff."
"Very drinkable. Nice representation of the style. Although the flavors are big and aggressive, they do not cause palate fatigue. I could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Too bad I only bought one."
"I wish I had more so I could evaluate just how drinkable this one is."
"D - Not the best IPA around, but a good example of how to use floral hops in a beer. Goes down easy enough if you're a fan of IPAs. Could have a few in a night."
"Overall - For me, this is the best East Coast IPA available. Acquire and drink. You won't be disappointed."
"D: Very drinkable, light in a way. Tons of hops, more like an Imperial. Overall, a very, very good brew! Enjoyed this one!!"
"D - This is different than so many other American IPAs out there. Aggressively hopped, but with some different flavors (that Ahtanum isn't so common but it is good) and the bread flavors are a bit more like an English. Very solid IPA no matter how you look at it."
"D. Hop heads dream beer. I have had this out of the bottle and it was not as good. This is one of those ""fresher the better beers"""
"An interesting beer that reminds me of summer, but tastes great in the winter, too."
"This is the first Ithaca offering that I have tried and I am impressed!"
"good mouthfeel, and very easy to drink. I like well balanaced IPAs, and this fit the bill. not bitter at all."
"This is a nice IPA; good flavors and mouthfeel and has a nice sessionable quality to it. At 7.5% alcohol, this one could catch up with you if you session it, but it would be worth it. Very good stuff."
"D - Pretty high. I knocked it back VERY quickly. How can you go wrong with a hoppy monster on cask? Oh right, you can't. One of the best cask IPA's I have ever had. Great stuff."
"D: Very drinkable given how many hops are in this brew."
"This beer is better on tap, or, if bottled, (I would guess) at least extremely fresh (the several times I have had it in bottles it hasn't been fresher than this bottle, nor has it been better). The hops are beautiful, and they stick around in the aroma to remind you of what you're missing if you don't get all OCD and drink it straight off the delivery truck, if not right out of the fermentation tank."
"D: This is a really nice IPA, one that is readily available for me. I would seek this out and have more."
"D: A very nice, hop-forward IPA that goes light on the caramel malts. An easy drinking everyday IPA."
"What an interesting beer. Happy to have had a chance to try it. Good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Highly recommended."
"D: This is a solid IPA, tastes sort of like a west coast IPA. It is well balanced, the sweet malts and fruits compliment the bitters nicely."
"When I first had the power on draft when it first showed up in philly I was not that impressed, when it came back year round it has been nothing short of spectacular. Kudos to Ithaca for brewing a tasty ass IPA!!"
"Drinkability (4.5): This is incredibly drinkable for nearly being a DIPA. The huge flavors are still palatable in big gulps as there is little apparent ethanol. I have been drinking a lot of this due to having a whole case of best-when-fresh IPA, but still feel guilty like I should be savoring it. I'll be looking to try this on draft ASAP."
"Drinkability: This is really an all-day any-day kind of beer -- excellent smell and a set of flavors that really, really impress. ABV may catch up after a bit, but when a beer tastes this good, who cares? Cheers to Ithaca for this one."
"Pours a cloudy orange, with an eggshell head that sticks all over the glass. Smell is very grapefruit-like, with some of that great candy too. Tastes the same - a ton of tart citrusy hops, but it starts off sweet and finishes bitter. Very nice complexity. Easy to drink. A very nice, dynamic IPA."
"Solid drinkability. A few would be easy and enjoyable!"
"Pours a pale golden straw color, thin head that doesn't last. Smells of pine and citrus infusion. Pineapple and other tropical fruits. Tastes of sweet resin, balanced sweetness and complexity. Lots of stuff going on here but it seems to work. Mouthfeel is of slightly bitter hops, sweetness follows the hops. I could drink many of these, really solid IPA."
"medium bodied, medium-low carbed mouthfeel; good drinkability."
"Notes: This is Sweetwater IPA meets Hopslam...absolutely awesome tropical fruit/citrus flavors from the hops. Highly recommended"
"Drinkability is very solid. Nice beer, wish it was a little hoppier, but it is still very refreshing and tasty."
"A very hoppy ipa west coast style but made on the east coast."
"Drinkability-So smooth and flavorful for a for a pretty high 7.5% ABV IPA. I could drink nothing but this beer if necessary. Very much a West Coast style IPA. Don't these guys know they're brewing in NY? An outstanding IPA."
"Well done, Ithaca!"
"A world class IPA in my opinion... It's deep and dank with resiny piney hops and is better than 99% of the IPAs that I've had... Awesome brew..."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, can session this no problem and have it with a wide variety of foods. Not bad, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Mouthfeel is light but crisp and enjoyable. Overall Flower Power is a top notch IPA with lots of great citrus hop flavors and surely a beer I'll have again."
"T: Hops, obviously, hit you right away but are soon followed by a mellow pineapple taste. Finished nicely."
"D- I'm from PENNA and I could drink a case or two of this. This is a nice easy goin' IPA."
"D-If this were available in California, I would drink it all the time."
"Pours a hazy amber with huge white foamy head. The nose is exploding with citrus, grapefruit and pine hop aromas. Slight malt presence in the back. Very nice sticky lacing forms. Sip provides an excellent tasting IPA, hop forward and bitter right into the finish. Theres a smoothness in the middle where the malt characteristics shine. Medium bodied mouthfeel. High drinkability, a more citrusy IPA with plenty of flavour makes this very refreshing. Glad I picked up a six pack."
"D: More, more. I could drink a 6-er of this in a go, and go back for seconds."
"Alpine Nelson is better. Different but IMO better. this added 12/4/11. Flower Power is still amazing though."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with orange tinting. Nice rocky white head that was retained for a while. Smells like a pine forest with a couple fruit trees mixed in, good smell, you can tell it's going to be very bitter. It's very bitter. Almost too much of that piney-resin taste. I also picked up mandarin orange and some citric zest. There wasn't a lot of malt, almost none. Mouthfeel was very dry and sticky. Overall I enjoyed this beer but thought it could have had some better balance, but it delivers in the hops as an IPA should."
"D= Really glad I got to try this one wishing I had more of these."
"Drinkability - This was a easy to drink IPA with a slight piny aftertaste, Well blended fruits with refreshing hops."
"Hazy orange body with a nice 1 finger white head. Smells of mango, pineapple, resinous and some other fruits. Tastes sweet at first, a bit prickly citrus, bitter medium dry finish with some lingering bitterness on the roof of my mouth. Most ipa finish bitter on my tongue but not this one. Quite drinkable for the medium high abv. The smell is the best part for me. I'd pick this up again. $2.00 a single at BoTW Rochester ny."
"amazingly hoppy IPA without being too bitter. not the cleanest finish ala Pliny the Elder, but it still has enough of that citrusy punch to make this one of the best east coast IPAs to come by."
"MF/D- Medium bodied with a taste that lingers for a while on the palate. Very drinkable in the sense that I'd have no trouble enjoying a couple, but the palate killer this hop bomb is would probobly keep you from having more than that."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The bitterness in the finish is long and a bit off-putting, but it's made up for by the rest of the flavor and the well-masked alcohol. I feel this one is a little bit older than preferred, and I would like to pick up some fresh bottles to compare."
"Ithaca Flower Power is one groovy beer, man. And at a (surprising) 7 something percent alcohol, it's definitely no buzz kill. But it's not the kind of beer you sit around the drum circle waxing poetic about - it's the kind of beer you drink. Fast. And in great quantity. With great gratification. With an impatient urge to go out immediately and buy more."
"Medium in body with a sticky mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation as well. This one is highly, and dare I say dangerously drinkable. One of the more complex IPA's I've had, making it even more fun to drink."
"D: Nice drinker you could knock back a couple of pints of and be happy."
"D - After two your taste buds are shot but the ABV is pretty normal...I suggest you find this and drink it fresh...I had this super fresh and loved it so I ordered it somewhere else (a non-beer destination) and you could tell it had been on for a while...this is my review for the fresh beer and I did not factor the old one in...sorry for a short review but this one is a must try for people who enjoy tropical IPAs"
"Goes down easy but be careful of the ABV... One or two should be the max."
"A very good east coast IPA. Flavorful hops and not crushingly bitter. This is a great staple to go along with Cascazilla in their everyday lineup."
"Ithaca Flower Power IPA is a beer I've heard good things about, but only just now got to try. This is a very good IPA especially from an east coast brewery. You can definitely taste and smell the Centennial, Cascade and Amarillo hops in the beer, the grapefruit, peach, apricot and passionfruit flavors just sing. The only gripe I have is that the bitterness is just a bit harsh, it lingers just a bit too long into the aftertaste. The malt flavor and hint of caramel is very nice."
"(from notes late Nov)"
"D - Incredibly drinkable, hindered only by the higher ABV. If this was around 5% (and easier for me to find), I'd drink it all day long. Amazing beer, can easily contend with the top-tier West Coast IPAs."
"D- pretty good representation of a west coast IPA on the east coast"
"This is an awesome beer. A great west-coast style IPA from an east-coast brewery. Bravo, Ithaca!"
"drinkability is hurt by the heavier body but i enjoyed this beer very much and makes me want to search out more ithaca brews"
"beer is dated best by dec. so i know its past its prime, but man this thing still has something goin on. i wish i had it fresh because i can only imagine the review id be writing. as it stands, it still looks delicious in my long hammer ipa glass with a thick foamy head that sticks around for the long run. sweet hops emenate and immediately i know this will still be yummy. its got that nice creamy texture to it that makes me believe if i had more i could drink it forever. iso: fresh flower power :)"
"This beer is so freaking good. I have trouble finding it in the stores but when I do see it I always get it. Hop heads or ipa fans will definitely be pleased with this brew. The aroma and taste are so delicious and full of hop sweetness. Citrusy notes overwhelm this beer in a good way. Enjoy"
"D: I've wanted to try this beer for a while now, and I am so glad I finally had the opportunity. This is a very tasty beverage. I would definitely have it again."
"This is a beer for hop lovers. Tons of hop character without the face-puckering bitterness. It's an easy drinking beer that should be drunk fresh."
"D. A very refreshing IPA that is interesting, but not overly complex. I could see picking this up to celebrate a beautiful summer day, but a rainy late fall day is not exactly the right mood for this."
"M/D--I am not the world's biggest IPA fan; I'm slowly treading into that spectrum of the beer world, but if all good IPAs taste this good, I'll be picking up some more. I've got a Green Flash West Coast IPA that's up next."
"Overall, I'm glad I went back to this one. After reading some of the hype about getting this fresh, I saw it on tap at the bar, knew that it hadn't been on tap for very long at all, and realized that I had to give it a try fresh. It was definitely worth it. This is definitely one of the better East Coast IPAs that I've had and it can stand shoulder to shoulder with quite a few of the West Coast IPAs I've had (granted I haven't had Pliny the Younger or the Elder yet). If you're a hop head, you owe it to yourself to get this fresh. Cheers!"
"Wow. Hoptastic. I think I got a good fresh batch to sample. The smell---oh that smell! Pine mixed with tropical fruit. Really prominent. Pours a typical orange-amber with real nice head that settles to a lasting cap. Lacing is very nice. Taste is bitter with the pine and fruit coming through. The finish is lingering and long. I find the flavors balanced and quite harmonious Probably the best East Coast IPA I've had to date."
"D: Love this beer. Taste is fantastic and the hops really scream out of this one. Easy drink with a good body and balance to it. Recommend to get a few of these and give them a go."
"D - Drinks almost like a DIPA, which I like. Big, bold, balanced flavors without an insane bitterness make this a great IPA. One of my new favorites."
"Simply good beer."
"Halfway down the glass, there is still 1-finger of head, and the lacing now sticks completely to the side of the glass. I'm glad I waited to judge the appearance. The bitterness gets heavier on the tongue towards the bottom, yet not overwhelming at all, and the hop taste seems to get fresher. I'm guessing cascade or citra hops. Finishing the last sip, there is lacing that is now drying on the glass. Beautiful, delicious beer for the price. I would allow this to represent the East Coast for IPAs."
"Pours a hazy copper color, with a good 2 fingers of thick head and tons of lacing - great looking IPA. Huge hop aromas coming out of my pint glass, lots of fruits (apricot, grapefruit, mango) as well as some nice floral and pine scents. Taste is so fresh (it is only 2 weeks old), amazing citrus flavors as well as some earthiness, and just enough of a malt balance in the middle. Flower Power has a nice, crisp bitter (piney) finish that makes you keep coming back for more. I never miss an opportunity to pick up some flower power, especially when really fresh!"
"Overall, i absolutely loved this brew. I have had it before and was not as impressed but this time around it blew my socks off"
"Drinkability is quite good. If you can find it, treat yourself."
"Taste-Orange-rind/apricot, fresh hop flavor and bite, grapefruit-rind bitterness in the finish. Great body and character as well as a bit of a diffeent flavor profile for an IPA. A great match for hot wings or spicy tacos."
"The beer poured as a golden yellow color. About one finger white head. The aroma was very tropical with a very fruity smell of orange, pineapple, and perhaps other tropical fruits such as grapefruit. There was also an aroma of pine similar to Pliny the elder from Russian River brewing company. This beer was quite hoppy and it was very crisp. It had a clean and smooth unique taste and was very drinkable."
"This beer is pretty darn drinkable if you love hops. The well tempered finish really helps in this aspect. I had heard good things and bad things about this beer, and I am here to say that if you are a hophead and see a fresh sixer of this on the shelf of your local beer store, you need to buy it immediately."
"D - Well money talks and I haven't seen the case prices for it but I can already tell I can get Southern Tier 2xIPA for cheaper and I liked it the same. This is still one great IPA and if you can get your hands on it cheaper than most IPA's go for it. For me I have little options and it really wasn't worth the four dollar single. Nice beer."
"As I drink it starts to grow on me, a decent ipa that I would pick up occasionally if it was local. A nice extra."
"Light copper in color with a half inch of foamy head. The aroma is of huge hops. It starts out piney, then turns citrusy and finishes with a light tropical fruit and flower. The flavor follows the aromas through their progression, finishing both surprisingly light, yet bracingly bitter at the same time. If you are a hophead who likes American IPA's you should like this good example."
"for your palate. This one is a hop lovers dream."
"The taste has the grapefruit, light on some pine, some caramel malt sweetness in the background that gives it *some* balance. A little bit of bread when I swish the beer in my mouth. An *excellent* East coast IPA that does as well in the bottle as it did from the Growler sample I got in a past trade. Super drinkable beer and I'd recommend to grab some if you see some!"
"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers, a great example of an IPA. At 7.5% ABV, this is a dangerous beer to have around."
"Initial flavor of citrusy hops, tangerine and orange rind, some pine. Honey malt rides beneath, well balanced but firm hops. Pine sap lingers. Even mouthfeel, a tad slick. Tasty and drinkable, good beer."
"OVERALL: This is a flat-out outstanding beer. However, being a bit on the rich side and at 7.5%, it may be tough to down more than two or three of these in a sitting."
"pale yellow not too heady pour. aptly named, as the floral aroma is astounding! thick, nectarlike but clears easily. hop bitterness is crisp at the end, doesn't linger too long. by far the most fragrant of IPA's, and not your typical litchi fruit nose...loved it!"
"D - The bitterness without malt support makes this a tad less drinkable than it would be if the malt were either richer or more character-imparting."
"Pours a hazy orange amber that has a nice fluffy 2-finger head that has very good retention. After the head fell it left nice lacing. Also there were a lot of carbonation bubbles on the glass for the first few minutes. Smells very floral. Citrus and fruit notes such as apricot and pineapple are present. The taste is very good. The hops are definitely the star of the show, but they are not too strong. You can also taste apricot, pineapple, and citrus. Maybe a little hint of orange. The mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation with a body that is on the lighter side of medium. It also goes down pretty smooth. Drinkability is very good. I could drink many of these fine brews. Cant wait to try more beers from this company. Cheers."
"D: A very enjoyable IPA if/when you enjoy the pop of floral hops. Not sure about the comparison to Sculpin I've heard. Its in its own sub-category of IPAs."
"This is such a drinkable IPA. It's hoppy like it should be, but it's a crisp bitter hop that still retains the floral, grapefruit notes that you get from the nose. Over all, great drinking with fried foods."
"The mouth is thick, bordering on heavy for the style. Not filling though. Still, the drinkability is not bad as it is so freaking good. As another reviewer notes, the hops are in full flavor here, and not just manifesting bitterness, though it is bitter. Lots of fruit noted like grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and finishes sweet with notes of honey and apple. Excellent aftertaste, as the bitterness isn't tiring or scalding. This is a spectacular IPA. I would love some more of this. I think this is the standard for accessible, non-Imperialized IPAs. Highly recommend."
"Is a wonderful IPA. Glad I've had this in the past so I know what to expect from this brew. My previous experience with this beer was taken into consideration in the review because if it was based on this particular tap, it would have fell flat on its face."
"D- This beer is highly drinkable if you are a hop head. Being a hop head I was glad for this. After two beers though sadly your palate is wrecked for the rest of the night. The ABV is also well hidden and sneaks up on you. What a fantastic beer!!!"
"Overall I thought that this was a fantastic IPA. It really showcased both the hops bitterness and flavors."
"Pours a slightly cloudy light copper with some orange tint to the color. White head is initially two fingers in mu tulip but fades down to just a bit. Good lacing. Nose is light citrus with a bit of tropical fruits. Taste is might and sweet with a small amount of bitterness and some light citrus and tropical notes. Light and slightly bitter. Drinks pretty well, but nothing too special."
"This is now one of my favorite IPA's. Another great beer from Ithaca!"
"12oz. bottle poured into Arrogant Bastard pint glass. Pours a hazy amber with a thin white head leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine, maybe a little pineapple and quite sweet smelling. The flavour is more of the same plus some grapefruit and is much less sweet/malty than the smell which is a nice surprise. The beer is fairly lightly carbonated with a light-medium body. This is a very refreshing and tasty IPA and highly drinkable."
"Oh, and Florencio Avalos is 400 meters and counting down till freedom. I raise my glass to you and all trapped souls - may you find your way back topside quickly! What a night."
"Slightly hazy golden amber with a sizable head that hung around for some time. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Nice hoppy aroma. Plenty of citrus and pine. Slight hints of apricots and grass. Interesting hop profile. The flavor is plenty hoppy as well. I get grapefruit and pine sap with just a hint of herbs in the finish. The malt adds a little toastyness. The IBUs might not be at the extreme level, but the hop flavors really shine in this beer. The body is not that big or brassy, but it has such nice carbonation, makes it a pleasure to drink this beer. The ABV limits the drinkability a bit but otherwise this is a very solid IPA that will not shred the tastebuds."
"Very drinkable! One of the best East Coast IPA I have had the pleasure of enjoying!"
"I wouldn't expect an ABV on the higher end, such as it is, but it's quite drinkable. This is a tasty beer."
"Medium bodied, well carbonated, almost creamy. Super drinkable. If I weren't so full from two hot dogs and another beer I'd have ordered a second."
"Fresh Flower Power IPA it's been awhile since I've seen this, but this stuff is excellent fresh. Appears a pale copper hazed orange hue with an off white slight orange tinted cream colored head. Forms thick and lacing is patterned evenly as it dwindles down around the sides of my chalice. Aroma is full of citrus/pineapple and earthy hops, very nice smell with caramelized/biscuit malts sugar coated hops wafting my way. Pungent bitterness with sugar coated citrus/grapefruit/earthy hop blasts...a very nice east coast hoppy IPA. Probably one of the best versions I've come across in some time from the East Coast. Mouthfeel is nice medium bodied sharp carbonation, this would cut through either spicy foods or strong cheeses easily. Slightly oily textured hop content in the body gliding across the palate. Drinkability overall is excellent one of those effortless easy drinking IPAs that will surprise you with the alcohol content, up there with Bell's Two Hearted or Founders Centennial IPA."
"Very drinkable and very delicious. Tremendous job on this IPA."
"If you like the US IPA than get what you can! Do not understand why Ithaca's best seller is Apricot Wheat when this is part of their line up!"
"Overall, a really good IPA and something I would definitely get were it more available here. Definitely one of my new favorite single IPAs. Highly recommeneded."
"Going to blind taste test this with my growler of fresh Sculpin tomorrow and really give it a true test."
"I'm not about to kick this beer out of bed, but after the gorgeous hoppy, citrus-infused, tangy scent I was a bit let down at tasting it. It has some excellent hops bitterness that I look for in IPAs, but I expected something awe-inspiring after the hype I heard and the goodness I smelled. Alas. I still have a tasty, pretty (almost an umber color, great fluffy head that settles into fine lacing), easy to quaff IPA. Maybe it's just this batch? I'd kill to find this on tap somewhere to see if that changes the character enough. For all my criticisms, I'd still be happy to have this again and again... especially if the elusive flavors promised by the scent come through in the taste."
"The scent made me think I was about to have something really, really special. While the experience was not a Holy Grail encounter it was a good, hoppy experience. I'll definitely get this again. Perhaps if Ithaca irons out a few details this could be the first IPA I keep my eye out for when I want a hoppy experience."
"Cheers...."
"Pours a murky golden color with a finger of head and thick lacing. The aroma is a bit light but there is a hint of flora/tropical hoppiness. The flavor is also a bit light, and there is an empty bitterness there without much hop flavor. The body is appropriate for the style. Drinkability is average simply because the weaker flavor profile doesn't justify the higher ABV. Overall an unmemorable beer."
"Tasty IPA. Would love to have access to this over the summer up here in WI. Also, just realized that this is 7.5%... so, so well hidden! Fantastic."
"This beer is a touch too carbonated for me, the medium to light body is crisp but just a touch too sparkly. The finish is clean with respect to the malt but a medium bitterness lingers. A nice, flavorful beer that I would happily try again, hopefully someday I'll get it straight from the source. Road trip, anyone?"
"When these are fresh, it's one of my favorite IPAs available in the area. Great hop flavor and smooth, crisp drinking."
"D: An ipa that brings the hops and malt and shouldn't disappoint. Sweet upfront, quickly turning bitter and flowery on the finish. A great six pack investment for the hop head inside of you and certainly heads above 90% of others by style garnishing this an easy A."
"Overall, a very ""typical"" American IPA in the sense that it has all the characteristics you want in an American IPA, but it does an excellent job of it."
"Picked this up from the brewery while on vacation. Hazy orange-yellow pour with a decent head and great lacing. Big earthy, citrus, floral nose with hints of bread and squash. Specifically grapefruit and apricots. The unique taste is also very earthy with a sharp, resiny, bitter bite. Just enough sweet malts to add some balance, but the bitter hops are the star here. Drinkability is excellent with a nice crisp, dry finish. A unique and refreshing IPA."
"d = easy drinking, dont taste the abv of 7.5, feel like i could drink quite a few in a sitting, would not travel long distance for it, or put in my wants category, but would not begrudge if it was thrown in as an extra."
"Drinkability: Not too bad of a drinker. I thought this one was going to be a big winner when I first poured it and smelt it. The rest of this brew kinda went downhill from there. Still a solid brew that I would drink again if it was available locally to me."
"D- This is an outstanding beer. I can't believe I forgot I had this still. Well worth it even after ""best by"" date. Really wish I had another 6er of this."
"Drinkability - This one could be consumed relatively heavy, I could do a few and possibly a 6 pack fairly easy I am assuming. Can't seem to find the alcohol anywhere."
"D - I could down quite a few of these bad boys, the hop bill is dead on what I like."
"Great drinkability from a flavor stance, good from an alcohol stance. Why is his hitting me so hard? Whoa 7.5! This is a great version of the style. Nothing off, great balanced flavors."
"DB- A solid IPA for sure. I kind of wish the flavor was a tiny bit less floral and more tropical but it is still a nice, refreshing ale. I would recommend any hop enthusiast to try this beer."
"Wow, it's not very often that I can smell my beer at arm's length as I pour it into the glass, but that's the case here. And yet, that glorious hop aroma is not overwhelming or overpowering. My toungue is tingling but not at all fried. ABV is not listed on the label and I was SHOCKED to see on BA that it checks in at 7.5%. I feel like I could drink this all day."
"Notes: This beer is rather interesting because it seems to be backwards in mouthfeel for an IPA: it's really bitter right up front but finishes sweeter. Most IPAs now have that creeping bitterness that takes over the palate. This one starts off that way and then releases the palate to the other flavors. Well made and unique!"
"Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth - not much of a carbonated brew, but still lively and light-bodied, which was very delightful for me. Drinkability is quite easy due to its straight forward taste and smooth mouthfeel. I could definitely have two or three more glasses for a night."
"O - Comparing this in a tasting with Pliny and 2xIPA, this came in third. I'd had it before on tap, and loved it, so maybe I'll search out a keg for a followup review."
"D- Excellent. I could drink a ton of this. Sadly, I only have the one bottle."
"What a vastly underrated IPA. Deliciously hoppy and satisfying."
"D: A 7% beer that drinks like its 9% must suffer in drinkability. This is more like a DIPA in most aspects, except on paper. A solid and enjoyable IPA regardless."
"Nice golden color. Not as carbonated as I like and it showed with a light head on it. Well hopped but still smooth. Little heavy for my mouthfeel due to the lack of head but it's something I would drink again. Would love to find this on tap or to see if it could improve the head. Cask drawn would just continue to make this almost cloudy or too heavy. Little bit more head and this would be great."
"Very nice, fruity nose on this. A sweet fruity rather than the grapefruit that is typical. Real nice feathered light amber rich gold color with a nice big head that laced around nicely before leaving a thin film on the surface. Nothing much on the back end which I like although most may not."
"Drinkability -- Not a palate annihilator, but still quite bitter. Refreshing. Wasn't in love with the mouthfeel; perhaps it was the bottle I got, since i. Otherwise, a great regional IPA that I was glad to get a chance to try."
"D: Tiptoes the line between 'IPA' and 'DIPA'; at 7.5% you've gotta be careful and give this some respect. Good flavor and aroma. I'm not quite in love, nor completely at peace, but this hoppy (hippie?) beer deserves some attention. Recommended."
"O/D-For 7.5% the beer is very drinkable. The floral taste seems to never leave the palate. The beer has all the better aspects of my ideal IPA. Great fruits, some nice pine that leads to an underrated bitterness. The hops are so juicy and ripe and multidimensional. Everything from green grass to wet pineapple. Overall, after my second six-pack, I have begun to fall in love with the unique flavor this brew showcases."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, citrus, mainly grapefruit, but hints of orange, and hops. In the taste, hops, pine to start then ending a grapefruit like, and a clean maltiness. A small bitterness and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry grapefruit citrus in the aftertaste. Nice hops and a decent malt backing."
"Pours a bright orange hazy color with a thick creamy white head, with retention throughout. Immediate pungent smells of hop flowers and grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy without being extremely bitter in the aftertaste. Extremely drinkable with the right balance for a Western-Style American IPA. Easily the best ""below the radar"" American IPA out there."
"""You can drink this stuff flat and warm and it is still delicious."" says my buddy Joe."
"On tap at Capone's. This beer has a current average of B+???? Wow, one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Pours a nice clear body with a great head. Smells amazingly fresh. Citrus floral hoppy goodness. Tastes right on par for an amazing ipa. This may be the pliny of the east coast. Not quite the pliny standard but in the same league. Love this beer."
"This beer is a pale golden copper, mostly clear with maybe a hint of haze. The aroma is really good, similar to some Flossmoor IPA's, floral and fragrant with a sweet malty background. It tastes sweet upfront with nice caramel and biscuit, lots of bitterness in the aftertaste, so much as to give a little chalkiness in the mouthfeel. Light carbonation gives a somewhat fuller mouthfeel than the 7.5% ABV would imply, speaking of which 7.5% is pretty high for an IPA. But that doesn't hurt the drinkability, excellent stuff."
"Mildly syrupy and low carbonation make this drink like a double, as the abv can attest."
"d - A pretty good, smooth IPA. Easy to drink and not very bitter, it had a lot of enjoyable citrus and floral notes. Would try again."
"D- Moderately . A decent American IPA. Not my favorite, and one I prob. won't revisit too often, but still an OK beer."
"Strong butterscotch-like aroma. Murky rust to orange color. Bitter hoppy taste that is a little bit strong at first. Sort of thick in its feel. Leaves an aftertaste that is alkaline. Not much of a flavor, but a strong texture. Not one for all day, though it does conjure up images of my childhood in the 1970s rustbelt, but I am at a loss as to why..."
"If it was available in GA, I'd buy this once a week."
"d: very high, but I love IPAs, so I may be a bit biased"
"This is a beer I love fresh. With some age, it really drops off. Luckily, this is pretty fresh still and full of flavor. It's easy to forget that you are drinking beer when it smells so darned juicy and tropical."
"D - An excellent IPA that I will definitely buy over and over again."
"-really like this beer. more like an english ipa, and not huge on hops, but very drinkable for me. went well with the curry udon dish i made as well"
"So after I put up this review I was told by a very reliable source that all Flower Power has been unfiltered for a year now. Thanks for the clarification."
"8/2/10. 12 oz bottle with a ""best before"" date of Nov. Pours a dark amber/orange color. Good head with tons of lacing. The smell is exceptional. Lots of hops, grapefruit, floral and citrus aroma. The taste is excellent. Nice and bitter with more grapefruit and floral flavors. Finally got around to reviewing probably my favorite IPA. If you haven't had it yet, seek it out. Certainly an underrated IPA, but I don't think that it will be over-looked for too much longer. Fantastic brew."
"Overall-very well done, nice balance, good mix of flavors and it hides its alcohol very well, while I am still a hophead, I'm becoming more of a fan these balanced IPAs where the hops are just one layer and not overpowering, great job."
"This is a nice drinking beer, has nice floral hop concentration, is creamy, and at 7.5%, you can have a few."
"Notes: Extremely drinkable. One of the best IPA's I've come across. So happy I can actually buy it around here!"
"Drinkability: I've heard a lot about this beer and had to try it for myself- I'm glad I did, this is the best IPA I have tried as of yet. It's very hoppy, but it isn't a bitter assault on the tastebuds. This is a very tasty brew I will definitely look to try again in the future."
"D: Again, the only knock on this beer was the alcohol flavor that I noted. Otherwise, a solid IPA and one of the few from the East Coast that I've had that I earns that description."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle. Pours amber-orange with a decent white head that recedes to lace. Nose of hops, some caramel malt, and I am detecting some apricot and sage. This beer is super balanced, masking the alcohol perfectly. The hops and malt come together perfectly with good fruity notes of apricot and bitterness. The body is medium with average carbonation and a decent and enjoyably bitter finish. I am very impressed by this beer."
"I should mention that there is a big difference between the on-tap and bottled version of this. The bottled version would probably be in the 4.2-4.3 range."
"This is by far my favorite IPA to date. Incredibly floral and extremely smooth. It compares somewhat to Hop Wallop from Victory but is better. This beer also hides its potency very well and is very easy to drink. As the beer warms up its citrus tones begin to shine thru making it even more complex and delicious. Well done Ithaca!"
"M and D: The feel was average--a bit thin. The drinkability is higher than the average IPA for me, mostly because I could just keep coming back for melding of floral and fruity in a bitter beer. Well balanced, but still not my favorite."
"T- For an IPA, it has a very nice balance to it. It's hoppy, but not over the top. Good floral malty balance to it. It's very smooth."
"Pours a yellow-amber-orange combination with a one finger off-white head. Good lacing and solid retention. The aroma is awesome. Strong grapefruit and floral scents. You don't even need to get your nose in the glass to notice. Aroma stands out from all the IPA's I've tried. Good floral and grassy hops. A bit of citrus and tropical malts as well. Decent malt backbone and a nice bite to finish. Again, awesome aroma and the taste follows and does not disappoint."
"Beer is an attractive gauzy orange/amber. A white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is big and hoppy: flowery, resinous, with some grapefruit. The taste is very good. A nice initial hoppy burst with a sharp and crisp bitter finish. The hops are a nice mix of pine and citrus. The mouthfeel is good; the beer is fairly heavily carbonated and it is quite drinkable. Overall a very, very good big IPA. Not quite top of the heap, but there's a lot of competition in the IPA category. But almost top tier. Definitely one to have again. It would probably be even better on tap."
"This is a balanced IPA but, I prefer a more hop forward flavor profile. However, I don't taste any alcohol and that makes this pretty drinkable."
"D: first beer by Ithaca Beer Company and I am quite impressed. Hopefully I see some more of these come my way"
"D: A top notch IPA. Wish we could get this one down south. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Perfect as well. The ABV is hidden, and its smooth as silk going down. This is the best IPA i have ever had thus far."
"The only thing lacking on this beer is the smell, but I can live with it."
"I was fortunate enough to try a super fresh batch (2 weeks in the bottle) and I love this stuff. Flower Power is a great name because it describes a lot of the flavor and aroma perfectly. This is a great IPA, and I would surly recommend it to all IPA lovers."
"D - Easy drinking, well balanced IPA. I enjoy this and will enjoy the rest of the six pack I picked up but honestly I'm not blown away by this. I would drink this again but won't go nuts seeking it out."
"I am blown away by the Floral, Piney, AND citrusy aromas With a great hop bitterness, it is well balances in the malt arena. This is right up there with Pliny IMO."
"D- A solid IPA and very good. Easy to drink and to be honest I kind of over look this one."
"Slick tongue, nice weight, and hop flavors for thee!"
"Had this on tap at the Ithaca Beer Co storefront. This beer poured a hazy golden copper color with a fuzzy white head. The smell is very appetizing. It smells of cascade? hops and grapefruit. This beer is not overly bitter so the hops are either very well balanced with the malts or mostly late additions and dry hopped. A very good 'strong' beer. Next time I'm in town I'll get a growler of this to go."
"D - Not sure why this has a B+, as it's a nice hoppy IPA that doesn't seem to have any major deficiencies. You can tell there are a ton of different hop varieties in here, but it never seems overly busy or muddled."
"I think it's worth a try, and I am glad I got a six pack."
"Penny copper, color with nice slightly off-white head about 1/4 inch thick, slightly cloudy. Piney grapefruit aroma. Maybe amarillo? Rich up front malt balanced nicely with a fruity/grapefruit hop bite that finishes very smoothely. Well done. I will definately look for this again."
"MD-At 75 IBUs this beer is on my upper end of enjoyability. But if I am looking to go heavy on the hops I would consider this beer in the future."
"D - Very drinkable IPA. One of the better east coast IPAs I've tried."
"VERY drinkable. This is a standard bearer as far as drinkable American IPAs go IMO. Could easily crush three or four of these in a sitting."
"D: Great drinkability. I love the strong pine hops in this one. Glad I decided to bring home a 6 pack of these and could definitely drink this one all day."
"Poured a lovely orangey amber, a little bit of haze, with a pearly 1"" head that left ample lacing and retained wonderfully. The bouquet is a rich piny and citrusy balance and a LOT of it! Hugely aromatic and floral with a bit of earthy tones. A light honey/caramel backbone with ample citrus fruits and pine. I shan't drink less than a pint of this every time."
"Pours a deep orange with a tight white head. Lots of lacing down the glass. Smell is huge hoppy citrus and pine. Taste has refreshing bitterness with tons of grapefruit and pine, but mostly grapefruit. Little bit of malt, but really, an IPA is about the hops and this delivers. Surprisingly awesome for an east coast IPA, which I sometimes find too sweet."
"Now this is an American IPA! Quite a few malt-heavy IPAs from the East Coast give the region a bad name, but Ithaca makes one to contend with the Left Coast favorites. Well done."
"Ithaca Brewing has an interesting little gem with Flower Power. It's good. It reminds me of Ballast Point's Big Eye IPA. Perhaps they use a similar hop profile. I like the peach and orange combo. It's different. It would benefit from a stronger nose, and perhaps a little more bitterness. Just my preference for the style. This is definitely worth grabbing if you see it. Go on. Do it."
"So this one had a huge head on top. Pours a copper orange color with enormous, dense white head. No joke, it resembles Duvel and some others in the size, retention, and lacing here. Beautiful. Smells like a decent IPA, a bit piney-er of a focus than some other American IPAs. Taste is similar, piney hops with some clean bitterness and biscuit-y malt. Medium body, not as dry as some hop bombs out there, but smooth. Very drinkable, an IPA I would have no problem ordering or buying again. Just a clean, smooth, straightforward IPA. Good work here."
"Drinkability is good. I could drink a few of these, and it is a very inviting beer."
"Pours a beautiful red orange hue with a dense lingering finger of head. Each pout leaves nice lacing across my glass. Really like the way this one looks. The nose reveals a light fresh grassy and citrus aroma. The hops are certainly present in this beer, but not as overboard as many of todays IPAs. Again, grassy and lemon citrus tastes are prevelant but are well balanced. Alcohol is also detectable, and contributes to flower powers slick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation works well with this beer. I could have several more, but the clinging grassy bitterness would keep this from being a truly session-able beer (i know, its above 4% abv too.) Certainly think this is an above average IPA"
"Man...this is a great drinking beer. Very easy to throw back a few of these. Make sure you keep a few of these in your cooler for the summer!"
"Sweet malty, piney hops, resiny coating. Very good IPA. Not as wild as the West Coast IPA but still every bit as tasty."
"12 ounce bottle, best before June 2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy hops (oranges, apricots, tropical fruit), pine hops and honey. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the hops don't overpower the malty flavors (as the hops seem stronger in the aroma). With that being said, I think it's still a tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd buy this again and it's definitely worth a try if you haven't had this beer before."
"D- I would take it rather then leave it. Great price point two bucks during happy hour, sweet!"
"D: Potent but at the same time drinks fairly light for the kick it packs. I like this beer -a lighter drinking alternative to a double but still with a taste strong enough to bitch-slap you if you even look at a Bud Light..."
"Mildly hazy brassy apricot body. Two fingers of thick, dense, beige-white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Sugary caramel and cookie malt aromas underneath apricot, orange rind, pineapple, and light pine sap. Nice. Toasted malts up front. Herbal hop bitterness follows. Some tropical fruit mixes with sugar cookie batter mid-palate. Any sweetness is balanced by a dry, grapefruit-citrus, herbal-pine hop bitterness. Nice long appetizingly dry finish. Creamy feel in a medium body. Very nice!"
"Overall, a very solid IPA. It didn't hit it out of the ballpark for me, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be opposed to having it again."
"Thanks Adam!"
"Bronze with a frothy white head. Ripe citrus hop aroma, with a hint of biscuit-like grain. Hops dominate the flavor, with pine and citrus. Malt stays out of the way and lends a bit of body, and some sweetness as it warms. Fairly clean mouthfeel, with a nice dry finish. This is reminiscent of many west coast IPAs. Not an ""outside the box"" beer (usually a good thing in my opinion), but executed very, very well. One of my favorite IPAs from the East."
"The beer pours a clear light orangish-brown with a white head. The aroma is a mixture of resiny hops with some orange and grassy hop character as well. The flavor is resiny hops with a little bit of orange citrus. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice IPA but nothing too special."
"D: Not too low of an ABV (7.5%) although low for an IPA fan. The sweet floral hops flavor makes this very drinkable even for a casual IPA fan."
"...is it not enough that you dine in peace, among us who are violent men and are deprived of no fair portion, but listen to our conversation and what we say? there is no other vagabond and newcomer who is allowed to hear us talk. the honeyed wine has hurt you, as it has distraced others as well, who gulp it down without drinking in season."
"D- Satisfying and never will make you say I think I want something else, once you drink this beer it will be the only beer you will want to drink for the rest of the evening, no matter the surrounding's, bar, campfire, beach, ect. I mean anywhere and on the last note, thank you Ithaca for one of the best IPA's I have ever tasted!"
"D - Nice drinkable beer. Smooth enough to have a few without sacrificing the IPA character."
"Just had a standard pint glass from cask @ Teresa's and it was wonderful! Like the description above except obviously creamy and smoother. Need to upgrade my review 'cause this was just great."
"I just have to say again that i truly enjoy this beer... i am a hop head and this one comes in as one of my favorites. i'm drinking it now and am really impressed with the smell. i was around a non beer drinker friend yesterday who said he hates all beer. i told him to take a sip of this.. he did and his eyes lit up immediately and he yelled out ""that's good!!!!"".. gives to a bmc drinker and it will knock their socks off. i think it is a very friendly ipa as opposed to some of the others out there that you kinda have to work your palate up to.. this is not like that. i think this is super friendly.. too bad this is semi seasonal as it would may otherwise be a go to ipa over here!!"
"Pours a hazy a copper orange color. Nice foamy, medium dense head. Lots of thick sticky lacings. Big hoppy, Floral aroma with hints of pine. Medium body with ample carbonation that makes it very refreshing. Big hop flavor, with grapefruit, and dark fruit flavors. Lots of hoppy aftertaste. A very nice ale."
"My first experience with Ithaca Beer turned out to be a good one. This was a well done and nice tasting beer. What a nice bonus extra in a trade."
"F: Pretty dry and bitter, and leaves an anesthetized feel with all the spicy hop characteristics. Long bitterness, some orange peel now, musty fresh wet hop taste lingers, little spicy bitterness. It leaves some astringent flavors too that start to bombard the mouth. Lots of nice hops overall in the beer, nice a fresh tasting and hoppy. West Coast style."
"Excellent IPA, easily one of my top 5's."
"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and the flavors are sharp and well balanced. The alcohol is well hidden, and right where I like it for an IPA, right in the 6.5-8% abv is perfect I think. This is good, and if it were easier for me to get I would drink it pretty often."
"This is from one of the breweries I miss from my home area and this brew is as good as I remember. A job well done!"
"Note: I also used a 12oz of this in a beer bread. It resulted in a super bitter but delicious loaf!"
"D: High. Extremely high. Ithaca created a west coast style IPA with this one, and probably does it better than most west coast brewers do. The Flower Power is my favorite, if not the best IPA I've had to date. How is this beer only rated a B+?"
"Pours a nice slightly hazy copper color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malt notes, nice touch of citrus and pine notes. The taste is hoppy, with a nice touch of sweetness, slightly malty, with some citrus/pine notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice IPA."
"Drinkability: A very bitter and floral IPA. The bitterness prevents me from wanting more than one per sitting, but I would pick this up again as a single for a change of pace beer."
"If this were regularly available to me, I would have these often."
"Medium bodied, appropriately carbonated, Flower Power is a very easy drinker. All in all, a pretty great brew. Maybe a tad below Two Hearted and Sweetwater IPA, but that's nothing to be ashamed of."
"D- great pale ale here. One of my favs on draft for sure. Easy to drink and would drink all day."
"D- hands down... this is a great example of an american IPA. I reaize that there are not many reviews of this brew. I cannot advocate enough giving flower power a try. It really takes a stance being true to the concept of a bitter/sweet citrusy IPA. The flavor and make up of the brew is truly unlike any IPA that is out there. You can gulp it down with no problem. I wish I bought an additional growler to share with others. This is a heck of an IPA"
"Off the tap this beer was a cloudy, copper-orange color with a frothy two fingers of off-white colored head. The retention was good, the lacing great! The aroma was mostly of wood, Simcoe hops and a little bit of earthy malt. The flavors were dominated by herbal and floral hops with crystal malt in the middle and a lot of bitterness from the grapefruit/citrus zest finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation light. Very enjoyable for me, but definitely a beer for hops heads due to the high bitterness and undeniable hop dominance."
"Drinkability: I was originally not too impressed but as I'm drinking, this beer is definitely growing on me. Obviously that means more research is necessary!"
"d- really great, i'll drfinately pick up some more of this great ipa. it's really flavorful and goes down almost too easily, i wish i had some more chilling in the fridge."
" Definetly a smooth well crafted brew that is absolutely amazing. Glad this one made it to my end of town,willbe in my fridge at all times from this day forward!"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. A hazy orange liquid with a medium white head, minimal lacing. Big hop notes on the nose, grass mixed with tropical fruit, and a bit of citrus. The grassy hops are up front, very strong, they mellow out and let tropical flavors dominate. The finish lingers with a pleasant bitterness. A medium bodied IPA that I could drink all day long. Very disapointed I only bought a single."
"This beer poured a clear golden orange. It smelled of hops, malt, citrus and very floral. It tasted of pine, orange, grass, floral with some caramel malt undertones. It was pretty enjoyable actually. I have never had any of Ithaca's beers before so this seemed like a good one to try. I look forward to trying more the next time I am back on the East Coast."
"Drinkability - dangerously sessionable at 8%."
"D - Very tasty and surprisingly balanced given the bitterness. Provided it will be common in our market, this will be my everyday IPA."
"Nice mouthfeel. High carbonation and medium to light body gives this re-drink value, but it may not be for everyone."
"This is a pretty solid IPA and I'm glad I've got 5 more to have but, with that said, there are many others out there that I'd reach for first. Very good but not great!"
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"I really wish i could get this stuff on a regular basis. It would be my go-to IPA hands down."
"Served on tap at Clark's Ale House in Syracuse. Had everything a good IPA should have. Decent rocky head and lacing. Smell was a little more herb-ally pungent, even more so than the existing hops. Taste is a nice balance of floral complexity and earthy hops - very refreshing. Also offered a nice body that doesn't overbear your stomach. Excellent take on an IPA from an ever-growing brewery."
"D- Overall a really nice IPA with loads of hop flavor. A must have if you can find a fresh 6pack."
"It's one you could grab out of the fridge, never looking at the label and mistake it for any number of IPAs. A few years ago, I may have fallen in love with this brew, but there are so many good IPA's, this one just becomes one of many."
"D: Very good."
"D: This beer drinks pretty well. It reminds me of many west coast IPAs. I will definatly purchase this beer again."
"I bought it because the label looked sweet and the name sounded good, and it did not disappoint."
"D: No more than a growler per person on this one, your liver will thank you. Comes recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Wish this beer was available down in Baltimore as it would be my go to IPA whenever available."
"Overall it has a nicely tropical aroma and tastes great, but at 7.5% I'm definitely feeling it after only one."
"Overall very good IPA that I would definitely seek out again."
"Pours a hazy orange color with an inch high white head that fell quickly leaving little lacing int he tulip glass. Aroma is oxidization intitially, but there are some sweet malts buried beneath the citrusy hops. Big bitterness in this beer but it's awfully sweet as well. I guess you could say it's balanced, but in the way I typically don't enjoy. Just too much sweetness without enough piney, grapefruit flavor to even things out. Sweetness becomes cloying as it warms, almost like artificial candy sweetener. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Not bad, but one's enough."
"EDIT: I've had this again on 2/6/11, and I have to bump up the smell to perfect. This beer smells top-notch. such a huge hoppy aroma."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and goes down feeling watery. It's very easy to drink but doesn't really leave you wanting more. I liked this beer a lot better on tap. I felt that the smell and taste was much more dynamic. It's a west coast style beer but definitely not an equivalent replacement for one."
"I can't believe this beer is 8%. I rarely make a comment like that, because I'm used to abv being well hidden by a well crafted brew, but this is shocking. This had a unique hop character and was fun to drink, so it has that x factor to earn a 5 for drinkability."
"I found it highly drinkable and look forward to having again."
"D: The aroma is a bit of a tease, but the taste doesn't entirely disappoint - certainly a beer I could have again."
"An interesting beer and pleasant drink, but the batch I had made it seem more like a pale ale, which wasn't what I felt like that night."
"D - I like this one pretty well. It's not something I'd put in regular rotation, but I would mind a few every now & then. Worth a shot."
"Overall- Very smooth IPA! Solid, well balanced, and an easy drinker. Alc. is well masked."
" Overall I would say that Ithaca's Flower Power is one of the better IPA's I've had the pleasure of consuming. Though it falls a little short as far as appearance, it more than makes up for it in every important aspect. Though it's a bit pricey for the style, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again."
""
"D - Nice and super drinkable. A great east coast IPA."
" D- This beer has a nice full forward hop flavor making this a nice solid IPA."
"Good color, even better smell (multiple hints of citrus & pine) decent carbonation, but not overpowering. Flowery taste, followed by the pine & citrus notes. Great mouthfeel, not overcarbonated, a little sappyl leftover. Very hoppy at the end, almost like a double IPA. Really good beer- one of the best IPA's I've tasted."
"D- Highly recommended. Close to being a DIPA. Hoppy as hell with a nice malt finish."
"D - A solid IPA teetering on DIPA territory... Hides the 8% ABV very well... There's is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I'm not sure there is anything overly memorable either... I would gladly drink another if given an opportunity, but I can think of numerous IPAs that I'd prefer..."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory Pint. Best by February notched on the label. Poured a translucent honey-gold with a 2.5 inch bright white head that gradually receded into a rocky cap before settling into a solid skim. Delicate strings and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose is sweet citrus, a suggestion of cereal grains and a light, floral character. Taste consistent with nose; however, cereal grains disappear from the flavor profile, and a light, lingering bitterness comes out at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive background carbonation that falls short of prickly. Consistency also exhibits a little oiliness as well. This is a pretty tasty IPA I have to say. Great balance with a well-hidden abv at 8.00%. Well worth your time."
"D - A fantastic IPA that is in my top five for the style."
"Beautiful smell of hops - tea, flowers, sweet grass, stone fruit, and there you have the flavor too with the addition of silky sweet malts and lucious creamy mouthfeel. A burst of hops up front, in the middle, and on the finish, but silky smooth all the way."
"D - quite yummy, probably my favorite East Coast IPA that can easily rival any from the left. love this one."
"Best I've had from Ithaca thus far."
"While it could use a smidgen more malt, a solid everyday ipa with a bit different hop bill. Recommended."
"The first time I tried this beer it was to much for me to like. I have since grown to love IPA's and this one deserves to be in the top 5 for anyone that loves to drink IPA's. It has a great smell of flowers and fruits. It really has a strong hoppy taste to it and goes toward the border of overkill but stops short of it. It does have a good balance in its flavor and is easy to drink. I would suggest not to try this one if you are just starting to drink IPA's."
"Yeah, good beer. Nice hoppy American IPA."
"Pours a thick gold with heavy lacing all the way down. Wonderful sweet, floral aroma with biscuity hints. Not too syrupy, grapefuit pine dominating but with good malt balance. Good carbonation and very smooth- reminds of Cali-style IPA."
"This tastes incredible! I could drink this morning, noon, and night, for the next 40 years."
"Medium bodies with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, a very delicious IPA that I thoroughly enjoyed and would purchase again."
"This is a great IPA, possibly one of my top 5 that I have ever tried. Absolutely fantastic. Completely undeserving of the B+ average it gets here, which is complete blasphemy if you ask me. Although I hate with a burning passion the state in which this was brewed in (only because of the Yankee's) this is one thing that I adore the state for producing."
"A hop bomb without the harsh."
"Poured a fairly clear gold color with a short lived rocky and foamy white head that leaves some awesomely sporadic chunky lace. Aroma is super floral and citric. Smells super fresh and juicy. Taste is hop-juicy with a nice doughy yeasty deliciousness. Slight musty earthiness too it. Not too much in the malt department here. Feel is moderate with decent amount of carbonation. The hops do a good job of masking the 7.5."
"D: Comparable to Sculpin but not as clean on the taste and not as crisp in the mouth. Still enjoyable though and I'm glad I got to try this."
"Drinkability: a nice sessionable IPA. Easy to quaff. Worth giving this one a try."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA, with an almost English base beer accompanied by a slew of American hops. It's an interesting medley, though it also packs quite the punch at 8.0%. One definitely worth trying, and I can envision it being a go to beer ... if it were readily available. Lucky New Yorkers!"
"Had this IPA at Fat Head Brewery yesterday in North Olmsted Ohio. Poured into a pint glass this had a nice dark gold appearance with about 1/2 inch of head. Smell was inviting with the floral smell I was craving. Taste was spot on what I expected as it was similar to the smell. Drinks smooth with an even finish. I could drink a few of these. I would have to recommend this beer especially if your looking for that floral taste and aroma."
"D: Overall very enjoyable. A nicely balanced beer, and not a complete hop bomb. Very enjoyable, and something I will get again."
"Drinkability: A quality IPA. Good hops with a sweetness to provide some balance. Certainly a brew I will reach for again."
"D - Very drinkable. I lean more towards the west coast IPA's, but this is right there. A solid beer, one of my top ten from the east coast."
"Overall, very pleased with this and I will get it again being from upstate NY. Reminds me so much of Victory Hop Wallop yet is a much less expensive substitute in my area. I am surprised this is labeled as an IPA and not a DIPA. Very hoppy, floral, citrusy IPA as opposed to some of the more bitter and maltier versions out there. Recommended by this hophead for sure. Props to Ithaca on this one, I haven't picked up their beers too often since my college days but I am going to start."
"M-this is very smooth with a medium body, almost a syrupy texture with just the right amount of carbonation"
"good beer! very easy to drink and not over the top in an way. very balanced."
"D- Really a great IPA from a brewery that I didn't pay much attention to until recently."
"Something a bit raw-ish about it...Alcohol is masked reasonably well in flavor (didn't realize abv until putting review in, though doesn't exactly surprise me - and that might be it). There's a different sort of hoppiness to it. An interesting brew and a good change to something a bit different in an American IPA hop character brew."
"D-could've had three or four of these no problem. A very solid, boarding on great IPA."
"D: Goes down much faster than it should but I think one will suffice"
"Flower Power pours a brilliant orange color with a small, sticky snow white head. A booming bouquet of fresh, piney, slightly spicy, resinous hops greet the nose with a mild whiff of alcohol. Bright in the mouth and very well carbonated, a defined malt sweetness lay underneath an immense hop character. Weed, man...this offering is definitely, uh, inspired... Very drinkable for its size, honestly i had a couple last night and didn't even realize until now that this was 8%. Lingering bitterness leaves me wanting another sip constantly, not sessionable but 2 or 3 would suffice anyone's hop craving. New Jersey BA's...buy this quick its frrrresh."
"Recommended..."
"Edit: 11/5/2012 Keg purchased at home. This keg is really popping wih huge notes of pineapple and tropical fruits. It seems each time I drink this beer, I get new flavors. So complex."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good depth."
"I definitely thought this was a step above your run-of-the-mill IPA and woth a try for the IPA lover."
"Had this beer a second time and now i'm upping a couple of the categories."
"Always a fan of high abv completely unnoticed, you get it here. High velocity hop aroma and flavor, instantly made my top 5 APA list."
"EDIT: Trying a fresh bottle of this and it KICKS ASS! There's a dry and crisp finish with some teeth-melting hop bite. Never again will I have an old IPA. It just isn't worth it. Old review score was 3.65."
"Thin, quickly dissipating head lies on top of opaque honey-orange liquid. Mild fruit, flower aroma with hints of caramel. Hop bitterness predominates, lingers, doing a fair job of masking the 8% ABV. Unfortunately that's the best that can be said for the flavor of this IPA. You could drink a couple of these if the alternative is a mass produced offering that boasts ""triple hops"", but with the plethora of IPA's now available, why?"
"Slightly hazy yet bright golden orange in color with a frothy white head, leaves some of the best lacing ive ever seen. Smell is of grapefruity hops, slight notes of other citrus, piney and floral hops. Some malt presence. Taste follows scent, but bolder, almost Double IPA like profile. Grapefruity hops upfront, nice spicey and piney back end. Medium bodied, a little less smooth and sticky than other full flavored IPAs. Very good IPA, although lacks a little punch to be full forced, but still not mellow enough to be drank in session."
"D - A great Imperial IPA to me - at 8% it is above your normal Amerian IPA in my opinion. I find it smooth grant you and not intensely bitter, but it still makes the cut. The flavor is easy to drink while potent until the last taste. I will definitely have this again, it took 3 tastes to review this. I enjoyed this, but figure at 8.2% it has its limits."
"Drinkability: This beer was exactly what I expect from an ipa. It was rather enjoyable and one of the better ipas I have had. I think I will get this pretty rarely, because the sixer was at least a couple bucks more than some other first rate ipa. It is rather easy drinking."
"This is a really nice, unique, fresh IPA that has only a couple minor flaws keeping it from being amazing. Nice find, good price point, would gladly revisit."
"D - Finding it hard to believe this beer is 8%...very smooth and easy drinking. Tons of hop flavor - should make any hophead happy. Very good IPA, would love to have a couple more."
"Drinkability is fairly good, but the IPA category is stacked with monster beers. Given a choice, I would go with many other IPAs before buying this one."
"Listed at 7%abv. noticable alcohol warmth present on the finish. Overall this is a quality ipa that's above average."
"I've become a huge fan of Ithaca Brewing Co. I don't think I've had a bad brew from them yet, and Flower Power doesn't disappoint. I've had it a number of times now and it's always a pleaser."
"Overall, I don't mind hops bitterness, but this bitterness was more of like orange zest. Combine that with a more balanced, malty IPA and they don't exactly go together so well. I think this beer needed to be less balanced in order to cut the harsh bitterness."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA, with a lot to recommend it as a regular treat. While it is not my favorite IPA it is a good solid, well made IPA worth sampling and drinking and I certainly won't hesitate drinking it again should the opportunity arise."
"Relatively clear, filtered orange/gold body with frothy white head that leaves one big ring of lacing. Aroma is fairly strong, hoppy grass and grapefruit with a little grain and malt background. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and creamy, with mild carbonation and a light hop bite in the finish, very pleasant. Flavor has a fairly strong malt backbone, sweet and caramel with a pungent citrus and grassy hop aftertaste that lingers for a very long time. 8% ABV is also very well hidden. Not a hop bomb but just a nice, well balanced ""easy"" drinking IPA,"
"Drinkability? I could drink this non-stop until Planet X returns. Home run for Ithica."
"Good mouthfeel. Not really oily like some hoppy IPAs, in fact, the body balances on the lighter side. Good carbonation. Drinkability is quite high, as this is a very refreshing beer that doesnt knock out your tastebuds. I see why it is so popular!"
"Drinkability moderately drinkable, decent beer, awfully bitter and almost astringent in the finish. Bitterness seems slightly out of balance with the beer, not bad but not great."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn high. This is definitely my favorite beer from Ithaca thus far (mind that I haven't tried that many)."
"Lots of floral hoppiness aroma, some dry malt. Thinner body than the alcohol would bespeak. Somewhat milder hop bitterness, some pine, but lots of flower. Alcohol is completely unnoticeable. Flavor is a bit milder and more tame than aroma would suggest."
"The feel is refreshing in a hoppy way. The bite of this beer does take a bit to get used to. Going down well, this beer just slides down leaving only a mild bitterness. Not a bad IPA."
"Pours a light golden copper color with about a finger of long-lasting white head. Great aroma, big citrus and flowery hops absolutely dominate. Taste is excellent. Floral hops dominate upfront but then segue nicely to citrusy and resiny hops. There is a touch of maltiness but that is quickly overwhelmed by the very solid hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good with a medium body and moderate+ bitterness. Drinkability is good as well with the 8% ABV quite well hidden. This beer has just what I want in a good IPA. There is a great variety of complex hops flavor, a good malt backbone and a solid hop bitterness."
"Drinkability: Is this seriously 8%? I'm blown away by knowing this now, after I had no idea. I wouldn't have guessed it was this strong at all, as it ends up drinking too easily and is almost too tasty, with no semblance of alcohol to let you know. I hope to be grabbing 6-packs of this when I can. One of my new go-to IPAs. Get your hands on some if you can."
"Overall: I had it first at the brewery in Ithaca. I loved it then, and I can honestly say it is just as good from the bottle. Really wish this was available in TX."
"M/D - Exceptionally drinkable for the 8% abv, this could be a dangerous beer to have six of, because I would probably drink all six!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation levels work well with the beer. Overall a very smooth beer drinking experience. Alcohol is well hidden in the beer. This could easily be a beer to have more than one of in an evening."
"Did I say this was drinkable?! Incredibly smooth and easy going."
"a good beer,worth checking out."
"Excellent brew. Ithaca is now 2-2 as of 8/6/09 in my book. I have one more. Can't wait to try it."
"It's too bad this is a summer seasonal because I can definitely get use to this one. If you see this one and you like hoppy beers, this is definitely one to try!"
"D: Even though this is larger in abv, I love drinking this beer when it is uber fresh. Tongue smacking goodness!"
"Nice golden coppery color with a nice head. Nothing too big. Smells big of citrus and less of pine. Tastes nice. Very smooth. Not over the top like some of the super hoppy beers, but not very sweet like the Dreadknaught or Hopslam either. Very light feeling beer in my mouth, but I could definitely drink several of these. I probably wouldn't search this beer out, but might buy it on a whim if the mood hit me in the store. I'd love to try it on tap."
"This beer pours a clear, gorgeous copper color with a two finger of white head on top of it. Decent head retention that fades to a film, nice thin sheets of lacing left on the glass. Nose is of grapefruit citrus and piney homes with a slight bready malt presence. The taste is an extremely well balanced flavoring of strong floral and piney hops and a nice malt background. As the hops start to bite, the malts even it out so that the hops aren't too in your face. Enough bite to it to enjoy the IPA and well balanced malts that you aren't disappointed there isn't more bite. Medium body, medium carbonation, a bit oily up front but a crisp dry finish. I could easily sit with this one for a long time."
"I would love a fresher sample to taste. I think this beer warrants a higher score for sure. I remember this being much more enjoyable in the tasting mentioned earlier. Chalk this one up to having too much beer to taste and not getting to it sooner. Have to prioritize better in the future!"
"Pretty drinkable despite the bitterness, I like it."
"D: Very drinkable. 8% is very surprising, I would have never guessed."
"Highly recommend."
"Drinkability is quite good given the 8% abv, but I want for more flavor if I going to have more than just one or two. All in all, not a bad AIPA, but definately not in the class of some of the big boys yet. Good job Ithaca Brewing."
"EDIT: Just noticed this was 8%, so I can somewhat imagine why it was reminding me a little of DFH 120 Minute."
"The more beers I drink from Ithaca, the bigger fanboy I become. They make some of the best beers I have had all year. I definetly prefer this to a lot of the more common West Coast IPAs like Stone and Alesmith. Highly recommended beer and quite a bit on the underrated side. Well worth seeking out."
"GET YOUR HOP ON!"
"UPDATE: Had this one on tap at the Copper Mine Pub today (10/18/09) and found the hops to be much more pronounced. (Delicious! I have increased both my smell and taste scores by .5)"
"Pours a medium brown with a beige head. Nose has subtle grassy hops and sweet malts. Taste a bit light. Good nutty malt presence and mellow herbal hops. Light body holds a light carbonation. Decent session brew from Ithaca. May be a good IPA to serve from a beer engine."
"A very good beer that went down smooth. Easy to drink and the ABV is not a factor in the taste, so I could drink these all night. To me this is another session IPA which I recommend."
"Bottle. Pours a clear orange with a thick white head. Aroma of resiny hops, citrus, grassy and sweaty hops, and iced tea notes. Flavor is rather malty and sweet upfront with resiny hops in the finish. Very similar to Weyerbacher Double Simcoe actually. Some astringency in the palate. Decent IPA."
"Thanks, jjayjaye, for the opportunity"
"D - Perfect summer beer. A decent IPA."
"This is probably the best N.Y. state ipa I've ever had. Color is light a coppery yellow, pleasant hop smell. Good mouthfeel. This has the hop bitterness and malty lingering flavor that I look for. Comparable to Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, which is a mainstay in it's own right with me, I taste a little more bitterness with flower power though, which is good."
"This is a really god IPA, would be nice if it was available where I live."
"Nice deep orange amber color with 2 finger foamy head. Great smell of citrus, especially orange, west coast nose for sure. Very refreshing with a great hoppy flavor and a slight malt backbone in there. Extremely drinkable. I could really get myself in trouble with these. I had 2 pints easily and a third would have been no probelm. No hint of the 8% abv whatsoever. I will certainly buy this in bottles when readily available in this area. Very well done by Ithaca and I would highly recommend to those who enjoy a very nice IPA. Cheers."
"12 ounce bottle- pours golden with good clarity and head. Strong west coast hop presence- pine, citrus some aspirin character (amarillo hops?)- medium caramel malt background. But mostly a hop delivery IPA. Finishes nice and bitter. Very refreshing IPA."
"Thank you Lum for this one!!! I owe you!"
"Pours a glowing beautiful orange/amber color with a sweet creamy white head about 2-3 fingers. Sticky lacing follows all the way down on this one, good stuff. The smell is a little more on the malt side than the herbal citrus, hops, i was expecting but those come through also. Some earthy wood notes also, but really a complex nose on this one if an IPA. The flavor is full of malts and hops, really well balanced and flavorfull. The finish is great and has that wonderful bitterness that all IPA's should finish with. Full mouthful for an IPA, at 8% i was wondering why it wasn't listed as a DIPA, but this is really a full flavored IPA. And for the 8% content you couldn't really detect and was very easy drinking."
"The beer pours a deep golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is killer! It has a powerful citrus hop blast along with a really solid malt aroma (pale and Carapils). The hops smell so fresh. The taste is great as well. It's perfectly balanced in the West Coast style. It has the basic malt bill of pale and Carapils malts loaded to the gills with Cascade hops. It's wickedly bitter, yet so refreshing, even at 8%. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer that seemingly is better unfiltered, although it's not very hazy at all."
"This is a really good IPA, but between the slightly heavy body, and the prominent pungency, it loses a notch or two in drinkability. Still a nice IPA."
"Nice looking beer. Pours a deep gold with a decent head and respectable lacing. The smell is fantastic with floral hops. Great taste with citrus and floral hops up front that flows into a nice little bite of bitterness in the back. The malt backbone isn't prevalent, but you do get a nice bit of sweetness to provide balance to the beer. I really enjoy this beer and what is even better is the fact that it is exactly as advertised. Flower Power India Pale Ale is the perfect description. If you are looking for an IPA that isn't as strong on the bitterness but has a great floral hop characteristic this hits it. I am shocked that this beer is 8%. Easily one of my favorites in this category."
"Poured a nice copper color into a pint class from a bottle. Had a 2 finger head, which held some lacing at the top. Smelled almost like a west coast IPA, very impressive. Tasted great. Excellent hoppy taste with almost a subtle malty backbone, somewhat surprising. I was very pleased with this beer, as I have been disappointed with some other Ithica brews in the past. I highly recommend this."
"As good as this beer is, I probably won't buy it again, because if I want a good IPA, I'd probably go for something a bit weaker, like Stone IPA or Sierra Nevada Celebration (if it's out) or if I want something along these lines I might as well go the whole hog and treat myself to Stone Ruination."
"Clean and well balanced American IPA. A textbook, straight-ahead example of the style. An 8% beer that hides the alcohol and could easily catch up with you."
"Let me be (Im sure not the first) to invite Ithaca into NJ distribution."
"A 12 ounce bottle from a sixer courtesy of beertruth and muled back from NY for me by number1bum. We only see Flower Power in PA in the Ithaca mixed 12 pack (3 bottles per 12 pack) or once in a while on draft. Glad to have an entire sixer to myself. Freshest by July 2009. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass and appears a crystal clear rich amber color with about an inch of creamy light ecru foam. The foam leaves a thin lacing on the inside of my glass with each sip. Smell is of floral, herbacious and citrusy hops such as orange and grapefruit. Excellent aroma here! Tastes of toasted bisciut/caramel malts, white grapefruit juice, bitter orange peel, lemon and resinous pine. Hop oils are really noticeable with the slightest touch of warming alcohol. Very fresh tasting with a dry finish, medium body aa well as medium carbonation. All IPA lovers need to seek this one out."
"The taste isn't far behind. This is a delightful nouvelle IPA. There are tons of grapefruit acerbic and tart notes, some lemon, lots of orange blossom and citrusy tangerine, and wonderful hop oils seeping throughout the body of the beer. This is a smooth, creamy beer that has a very nice bready malt base that cuts away some of the hop sting. It isn't an entirely balanced beer, and it is a touch too light and thin in parts. The beer could use a little thickening up to really bring this to the next level. This is a delightful IPA with a tangy aftertaste that is a real palate cleanser. This is a dangerously deceptive 8% ABV beer, with no throaty burn or other boozy characteristics. I would seek this one out again. L'Chaim."
"It is a nice drinker but at 8% abv not a session beer. I would but this again"
"d: The tongue dryness thing turned me away from having more than one."
"drinkability is good here. The limiting factor would probably be the ABV but since it's not on the bottle you would not know it unless you knew it because it's really hidden in the taste."
"Aroma is bright, floral and full of hops and citrus. It really pulls you in. Taste is typical of an IPA, hoppy and floral, bitter, with a touch of malt. It's only a touch dry and easy drinking."
"Hazy copper orange color. Floral (duh) aroma with some hints of pine. Really hits the front of the tongue, kind of heavy mouthfeel. Really not that drinkable due to the hops being a bit over done. Could do with a tiny bit less bittering hop IMO. Not a bad beer, just nothing too special."
"Notes: Ithaca Beer Co hasn't failed to impress me yet. Rated it all 4's because frankly, it's a ""good"" beer. Another thing... at 8%, isn't that a bit much for a standard AIPA?"
"A bit over-carbonated for me but it keeps this beer feeling lighter than it really is. Well balanced and quite drinkable...mmm"
"D: If you're up for the bitterness, this one is crisp and light enough to session (though at 8% that might not be the best idea)."
"D- This is a really solid IPA deffinitely something I could drink regularly. It has enough hops for the hop heads and enough balance for a guy like me."
"I dug it , id check it out again"
"A nice, well rounded, yet unique IPA. definitely would be in my regular rotation if available... and I greatly wish I had more of this one. Could easily drink end on end without realizing... it's that solid and that drinkable."
"This beer poured a reddish brown with a two-finger head that lingered for a while. The smell is mostly hops with some pine and floral scents. The taste was also almost all hops hitting hard with a very small amount of malt sweetness. Tastes like some of the piney cascade hops Ithaca Beer seems to love and some more citrusy/floral ones. The taste hits hard but leaves the palate fairly clean. The mouthfeel is a little slick with a decent amount of carbonation to make for a pretty crisp feeling. This beer is pretty drinkable for an IPA, a lot of flavor out of the hops without any overwhelming bitterness."
"drinkability - mmm hops so if in the mood drink up"
"Very good IPA"
"D - Tasty, refreshing IPA."
"Overall an excellent IPA. Definitely easy on the palate. This would be a great introductory IPA for those of you trying to convert the unbelievers. A keeper for sure..."
"i would love to see what this could have been fresh. I will look forward to attempting again this summer."
"Drinkability- Fantastic beer. So drinkable and fresh I can imagine that this beer definitely would lose of bit after a couple months. Other than Brute, this is the tastiest Ithaca brew that that I've bee lucky enough to enjoy. Adam was right; this is a definite fridge stocker. Great beer!!"
"This drinks too easily. Wayyy too easily. Good stuff."
"M/D - Medium bodied with an excellent level of crispness. Very easy drinking."
"I could probably drink a six of these in a sitting over the course of a hot summer day and have no issues."
"D: Very drinkable because of the smooth feel, however I am not dying for another."
"Overall, this was a solid IPA. It wasn't anything special, but it was the perfect beer for today."
"(rated Feb 5, 2007)"
"D: A decent IPA. The abv is a bit daunting. A good enough beer in style with a big range."
"I didn't realize at first that this was 8%, which is pretty big for a standard IPA, but it made complete sense once I realized it. It definitely drinks a bit boozier and is fuller in the mouth than a typical IPA - it's getting to be halfway toward a DIPA, in my opinion. Whatever, this is good stuff. I will definitely be picking up more in the future."
"D: great example of the style. Could be a little maltier, but a nice beer regardless. Would definitely drink again."
"D: Probably not one of their offerings that I would run back to hurridly, but not horribly bad - maybe a little lighter on the perfume qualities, and I'd love it."
"D - Easily drinkable."
"D: Could easily be a session beer. I expected a bit more bite, but it was a pleasant change of pace. Glad I have a few more"
"HV"
"Overall a very interesting IPA. Sort of boundary gapping as it has all the flavors of an East coast IPA, but the bitterness on the finish is right up there with WC brews. Some West coast hop flavor in here, but not much. Certainly one of the more palateable IPAs on the east coast, and glad to have a few more of these to enjoy. Thanks again Lum, looking forward to trying the others! Good Beer."
"First sip reveals an average body and fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is not overly intense with some grainy malt up front that rolls to grassy and citrusy rindy hop flavor. Again not intense but there, lingering bitterness. Fairly easy drinking with no hint of ABV anywhere. A nicely crafted IPA, I could sit and have a few of these and not be bored."
"Cool looking name and bottle.. whats inside?, not so cool. An average IPA at best, a little too bitter for my liking making it quite unbalanced. This greatly affects the drinkability of this beer. Also, the alcohol flavor is way too prevalent and makes it tough to drink as well. There's better, there's worse, its decent."
"This is an all around tasty IPA from Ithaca. Easily sessionable if you watch out for the 8%. I have been thoroughly impressed with everything I've had from Ithaca and I believe this to be an underrated IPA. Thanks for another good beer Paul!"
"Drinkability is a little low in my opinion for this style due to the sweetness, but an overall good experience."
"Feel is medium, but thins out on the end. Fairly drinkable and worth a try, but don't go crazy searching it out."
"Flower Power is a lovely choice to drink with dinner, be it crab cakes, mac and cheese, or spicy (indian or thai food etc.). Yummy I love Flower Power. Its one of my top 5 IPAs. Taste factor is second only to Russian River's Blind Pig."
"Drinkability - Not bad considering the style and hoppiness. Long but clean finish."
"Flower Power is a very good IPA. Nothing overly unique, but great brewing techniques with a really good hop flavor. Definitely worth a try if you find it in your area."
"D: This beer is good all around and amazingly drinkable. I could kill this sixer tonight if I allowed myself. Smooth and tasty. You can't miss with this beer and Lum is on to something here. Worth pimping and totally worth drinking . . . in mass amounts. Don't drive though, kids."
"Superb feel and drinkability. Many thanks to a large glowing-eyed Ithacan dog for letting Daddy Lum get us some beers!"
"O - the higher abv is sneaky, go easy."
"Notes: I think I will buy this again.Nothing too complex,just an ok brew.Drinkable."
"This Flower Power went nicely with the cool evening air and music in the environemnt I enjoyed it in. Probably better suited as a cool-weather IPA, but not necessarily one worth seeking out again. It's worth a try."
"D_What started out nice, look and smell wise devolved into an utter mess. Just totally out of balance and wierd tasting. Unless given to me, I probably would not go back for a second taste"
"Drinkability is good, a pretty good ipa overall."
"a tasty ipa i indulge in as often as I can. it pours a golden copper with a nice white had that thins to a miniscus during the session. the aroma is floral as promised and the taste well in front of the malt flavor is the citrus with a nice sweet finish. the mouthfeel is medium full with soft carbonation, it's a nice ipa."
"D: Maybe, I'd drink another to see if this is a good batch but otherwise, I don't see myself revisiting this"
"Drinkability is solid. I really enjoyed this one."
"M & D: Moderate carbonation, very smooth. I thought this was a great easy drinking IPA. Great hop flavor without the in your face bitterness. Another great offering from Ithaca."
"D: Surprisingly, I liked this beer a lot more the second time around. I believe I poured this out the first time. I guess I need to be in a serious IPA mood for this offering. However, it is worth trying."
"had this one on tap at Delancy's in CT. poured a reddish amber copper, very clear, and head dissipated quickly. smells of floral lilac and pine. full-bodied malty, caramel and toasty on the malt side and floral, piney and grapefruit on the malt side. pretty rich. i would almost call this a hoppy (imperial) amber ale. i love the name and the logo. more flower to ya!"
"D-interestingly, when I brought this case home from the brewery, I didn't like it all that much, in fat I hated it. Now that it has mellowed I love it."
"I would certainly buy this beer if I came across it in my travels."
"Drinkability: Overall, a nice, slightly bitter IPA. I am not certain of the ABV, but it might come back and kick your ass if you're not ready. Aging this for another month or two may bring down the bitterness/slightly unbalanced factor."
"A little heavy for some at 7%, but overall, a very crisp, clean finishing example of an American IPA."
"overall it is a nice beer, but nothing special for an IPA due to the heavy hops and light malt. This may be due to the month late on the freshness. will try a fresher one soon."
"This one is a chore to drink for me. I did drink the whole bottle, but i would not go back for seconds. I prefer my ipas to be more balanced, and this one is just hop oils in a bottle. If that is your thing check this one out fresh."
"Decent IPA all around. Nothing spectacular, but pretty solid. Well worth a try."
"I heard it has a high abv but i cant detect it at all."
"Although, I am not a great IPA drinker, this one is the wine drinkers delight, with almost a aroma of Califonian style sauvignon blanc coming at you. The hops were well done and enjoyable tasting instead of just hopping for the sake of hopping, I'm told the alcohol is high in this but it doesn't show in the taste profile. I'm no hippie but I gave this one the peace sign."
"D: A decent drinker."
"Good IPA with an interesting hop profile. If ever in upstate NY I would pick this one up."
"Flower Power is one dimensional, but that one dimension is tasty. It's very much a hop heavy, IPA, but it's damn drinkable."
"I could easily put back a few of these in a sitting. The 7.5% is barely noticeable."
"This is a good looking beer - pours a hazy amber, with a light head. I couldn't pick up much of an aroma, but the flavor was pleasant: slightly floral, a little grapefruit on the finish. Solid taste of light malt. The hops are light - not particularly bitter, but good use of flavor and aroma hops, which gives it a faintly tropical character. This is not a classic IPA, like Avery or Acme, but light and drinkable. It's a beer you could serve to your non-hophead friends yet not be ashamed to put out for IPA fanatics either."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with 1 inch of thick cream colored head. Good retention and good creamy, sticky lacing. Definitely can tell this is an IPA, lots of hop smells of citrus fruits like grapefruit, pineapple, and orange peel, pine, as well as bread dough. Tastes of sweet grapefruit, pineapple, and orange and lemon zest up front with a nice caramel and biscuits malty backbone, dry hoppy pine needle, spicy finish. Medium in body, good carbonation. Sweet and bittering with a powerful hop presence, but still balanced. A really solid IPA that is easy to drink and doesn't seem too alcoholic so I'd definitely enjoy these often, and session."
"Pours a clear amber, pretty thick one finger off white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring, few lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, lots of grapefruit off the bat, some pineapple, bready malts, biscuits, lots of tropical fruit, light pine, some floral, nicely balanced nose. Taste is nice, some caramel, quite sweet up front, nice pineapple and grapefruit hit, lots of fruit, bit of pine, light alcohol, balanced finish, little on the sweet side though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty solid body, but could use a bit more punch."
"D- I enjoyed this offering and would buy it if were available locally. A good anytime beer that is good on most occasions where you just need a tasty beer."
"*Judging from the other reviews, the folks who really seemed to enjoy this one generally experienced it on-tap. Maybe that's just a coincidence but my guess is this is a brew that lends itself better to that particular serving method. Translation: order one at the bar if you find it!"
"A standard IPA that is worth a try of course. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is very watered down. It's certainly drinkable but I'd reach out for a plethora of other IPA's way before this one. Not bad, but not great either."
"Overall a very flaorful AIPA. Certainly a sweet-hop lovers delight."
"Perfect carbonation with a light to medium body. Once again, the slightly astringent finish detracts a bit. Nevertheless, this is a highly-hopped beer that never grows annoying. Drink it if you can find it."
"Had a 2 oz. sample poured from the tap at the brewery into a glass tasting glass (much better than the plastic cups that some breweries use). Color is a clear pale amber with a white head that dissipates. Slight lacing. Aroma is spicy, herbal, and a little fruity from the combination of simcoe and palisades hops. Flavor is clean, with an intense hop bitterness and a nice dry hop finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with good drinkability."
" I would have another."
"A nice mid level American IPA. I tried it twice amongst the incredible offerings at my beer bar in NYC. Doesn't quite stand up to an imperial or DFH or Loose Cannon, but it was quite nice. Definitely not turning my nose at it. Great stuff on tap."
"This beer pours a nice copper color from the bottle with a nice off white head that sticks to the sides of the glass. It has a good IPA aroma - nice fresh hops and some citrisy undertones mixed in with a bit of malt. The taste is pretty good. Sweet roasted malts with a citris taste followed by alot of hops capped off by a citrisy aftertaste. It has a good mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. It is fairly drinkable and a pretty good IPA."
"Pours a clear amber gold with an off white head. Nose is strong with pine resin and almost a touch of sweet apricots. Flavor is strong with hop attributes. Fairly strong sweet tone to it. Feel has a lot of bubble on the tongue but a fairly standard liquid feel. I say this is extremely drinkable, but more so if you like the hoppy brews. If you are not one who digs getting kicked in the mouth by a hop (not that this one is that extreme), then you might appreciate this one a little bit less."
"Overall: Another great brew provided by BeerTruth. Good tasting and easy drinking. What more can you ask for from a session brew."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, I didnt really like this one too much at all and would definitely not drink it again."
"Taste is extraordinary. Tropical notes, citrus notes, wrap themselves up in a resiny pine. But nothing overpowering...just pure harmony. This is avery intriguing brew and has popped up into one of my favorite IPA's recently. I dont remember it being this good 3 years ago. I could live off of this stuff and the occasional Stone, and Smuttynose. This stuff is well engineered and its the shit, thats all their is to it. So...Let's hear it for FLOWER POWER!!! 420!!!! YEYAAAEEAAAHHHH!!! I could...scratch that...will drink these all day and night. Beervana ravishing my pallete. Keep it comin'. Keep it comin'."
"D - This is a very good IPA very easy to drink a good session beer"
"D - Didn't knock my socks off, but I could easily throw back a few of these in one sitting. A good offering from Ithaca with a pretty solid hop profile."
"Pours a clear light amber color with less than a finger wispy white head that resists fading. A reasonable amount of lacing present. The smell is light yet hoppy with a mild piny aroma. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel and flavors are light also. Almost watery, a piny hop flavor sneaks through then becomes more prominent with the swallowing breath."
"Best before January 2008. Ambered gold with slight haze. Yellow-ecru head is tightly packed, sticky and persistent. More cedar-spruce than grapefruit-tangerine in the aroma, but it's a close fight. Floral, too, appropriately. Candied nasturtium and grapefruit pith flavors are undercut by a disappointing watery blandness. Meager bitterness comes back near the finish, but sadly it's too little and too late. Weak finish, and the mouthfeel is dull and virtually lifeless save for a sparkly and bitter bite near the end of the swallow. Decent, but only just."
"Golden orange hue with little head but with some lacing for a pleasing effect. Very hoppy, floral, citrusy (grapefruit, tangerine) nose (theres almost an ice-cream or sorbet smell if you really stick your nose into it). Really smells delicious but in the craft scene this type of presentation has become commonplace. Quite a sweet taste, with malty, fruity things happening, but bringing lots of hop flavor to bear. I would say this one is more about the hop character than bitterness, although the latter is still well represented. Some alcoholic tastes but its not really slamming me abv-wise so Id say its fairly drinkable as far as IPAs go. Dryness in the midrange for the style. Some buttery notes in the sweetness and in the mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Whether or not you are into the labeling is one thing, but the beer is quite tasty. If I were eating a meal with this Id want another one right away."
"D - This is a very well balanced IPA, hitting with both malt and hops. Still, not overly heavy and quite drinkable. Well done."
"On tap in the tasting room of the brewery and then later from a freshly filled growler. Dark amber with a nice head of light tan foam. Very attractive lacing on glass. Aromas are of fresh floral hops, with apricot and gapefruit tones. Good body with plenty of maltiness and a fantastic flowery/fruity taste that makes you want more. Taste is hoppy up front for sure but not so much that it is undesired. This is a very nicely balanced hop attack. Plenty of citrus fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, just what you would want to let the hops shine through. For a hop-head like myself this beer has a drinkability that is very good."
"Pours a golden orange,with a one finger plus white head. Not much retention, but decent lacing. Aroma is of earthy,piney hops,with a fruity edge. Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is of citrus,and pine,with a sweet fruit balance that made this one of the best IPA's I've had."
"Medium body, light carbonation crisp finish"
" this is a wonderful beer. Underrated and under the radar kind of like this brewery. By fresh by local is the key here, though I understand they distribute through a number of east coast distributers. Try this beer if you can and drink it in its hometown if possible. It is goregous!"
"NOTE: I see these guys are making a Belgian IPA-- it sounds like Ithaca Beer Company might be a name to watch."
"The taste is once again full of piny citrusy hops, malt, and a mild fruit profile. Has a good bitter finish. I find this brew to be very well made and a nice change to the other IPA's I've been drinking lately. But I don't find it highly drinkable."
"Why is Flower Power is a seasonal? If I lived in the distribution area, I'd pester the brewery to no end until they made this well-crafted IPA a regular offering. I wish I could run out and buy a sixer right now. Thanks to BeerTruth for the bottle."
"Light copper/amber body topped by an off white head of modest size but above average staying power. Honestly though, it's rare that I see an IPA I don't find attractive. I can smell hints of the aroma from a distance - lightly sweet floral scents call me closer. At the nose is a very interesting citrus aroma that screams kumquats. Light hints of spiciness in there to, but I can just taste the sweet rind of a kumquat as I anticipate sipping this beer. Very pleasing aroma, and a little different than most IPAs. he first sip has a bit of sweetness up front, then the bitterness and herbal NB flavor raise the eyebrows a bit. The sweet and soft aromas belie the assertive bitterness for sure. The bitterness gives way to a bit of sweetness for a brief moment before the palate seems to be freed from everything - it's clean. But then the herbal notes creep back in. A hint of mint, a bit of grass. For this much bitterness, I'd prefer a higher alpha hop than NB to cut down on the aftertaste. But hey, it gets me to drink the beer faster to get rid of the funky finish flavors. Hop burps start up quickly. They're better than the finishing notes for sure. Mouthfeel is solid and on par with the style. Drinkability isnt too bad, but a more pleasing finish would make me rush out and buy this one."
"D - Different than last year's offering, a little less floral and more fruity. Still, a welcome change. Probably Ithaca's most drinkable."
"Not a terribly drinkable beer in my opinion. I will finish this one and move on to something else, or perhaps to bed. The two of these left in the mixed 12-pack I bought will be for others to try and review."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I was quite impressed overall."
"Taste follows the nose closely -- this struck me as something like a lighter, more ""summery"" DFH 90 Minute. Hops take center stage, with floral tones leading the way. Grapefruit behind that, and then malt finally appears, lending some balance. Just enough bitterness to satisfy the hop-head without turning off average drinkers. Very light sweetness in an otherwise crisp finish makes this a good hot-weather IPA."
"Not sure of the ABV on this, but I got quite a buzz from just one."
"D- This a very good beer from the IBC. I feel that it gives some of the DIPA taste with the lightness of a straight IPA."
"Pours a beautiful amber. Clear enough, but not like glass, you know? A finger of dense white head lastes fairly long and leaves good lacing. Smells fruity and citrusy. And, no, I'm not going to be more specific than that. Tastes... Huh. Tastes so much better when it's fresh! Had some at the brewery and, wow, was that ever awesome. This has been in bottles for a while (who knows how long - there isn't a date! Still, the stuff I had at the brewery was 5 weeks ago. Hmm. Yeah, they had it in bottles then). So, tastes change and I'm getting used to Ithaca hop use (Cascazilla/Red, DIPA, Flower Power). Still... This reminds me, oddly, of drinking Shipyard's Fuggles IPA. Something about the bitterness profile, you know? Anyway, I think I liked it a lot more fresh. Sweeter, less bitter. Not a bad brew for a hot summer day but perhaps a bit sweet for that..."
"D- I need more complexity than this beer can offer me- an alcoholic hop tea."
"edit: Make sure you drink this beer fresh because it does lose a lot of great flavors over time. Luckily they use a ""Best Before"" date on their labels now."
"Golden color thats a bit foggy, but complimented with a nice foamy head. I thought it had a nice fruity aroma. Not a big hop taste  pretty full and creamy. A finish thats more on the bitter side. Very easy to drink. Some people may not like it because it is a little different and not what you would expect from an IPA, but overall I thought it was a nice beer."
"D: It's not bad. I've never seen this in anything but a 12-pack, so I'm not sure how easy it is to find. It's always a beer I just sort of wind up with. Not very hoppy as IPAs go, and in a blind taste test, I might even guess that it was an APA. Being only slightly fruity and piney/resiny mean it's mild, and that's OK with me. I don't think I'll ever seek it out, but when I buy the Ithaca 12-pack, I'm glad it's there. A good, easy-drinking ale."
"Medium thickness, slightly more watery than I'd like, but decent. Thickens as it warms up. A pretty smooth IPA. It's bitter toward the end, which may hinder repeat drinkings. But it's a solid IPA."
"Brew poured to an orange color, quote clear with a small to medium white head that had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is ok, nothing to really write home about but solid. I seem to pick up quite a bit of malt, seems to have a caramel scent along with a good hop (grapefruit) aroma. The taste is ok, not awe-inspiring as I do notice a strong hop taste that is more citrus like but does not seem to have enough oomph. Also picking up a good malt flavor, but to me it just seems that this brew is quite bland for what I was expecting from its name. Good brew, dont mind it in the mixed 12 pack and one I would get again, just not my favorite offering from Ithaca."
"Has a slight dark, golden body but looking very clean. Head is pretty small. The taste goes along with the name of the beer, and you can definitely taste 'flowers.' Goes down quite easy, is a respectful effort at an IPA. Enjoyable, yet would put it only at above average."
"Flower power throws a cloudy yellowish-orange with a ½ inch well disciplined white head. A massive hoppy aroma, with some grapefruit and earthy notes as well. The body is mildly carbonated and very creamy. A bitter hop blast is quickly introduced, and the lips are left slightly burnt. Biscuits and citrus-like tastings are delicate, yet enjoyable. Hops lovers bewarethis one is addicting. A simple, yet good definition of an IPA."
"D: Good level of carbonation. Besides the weird taste, which must be acquired, it was good. Wouldn't mind trying this on tap if I could."
"The brew itself is not mind-blowing, but remember, this is a summer seasonal. Sipping this while swimming and playing in a creek in the sun this summer was excellent. Very tame for an IPA, almost a ""Light IPA"" without being pejorative. Extremely sessionable."
"Overall, this is an alright brew, but not the hop bomb that I am looking for."
"The flavor delivers a nicely balanced combination of light, biscuity malt and delicate citrusy hops backed by a solid bitterness. It's yeasty fruitiness adds a layer of complexity to it, and it finishes drying with some residual sweet malt that slips quickly from the palate leaving a mild, dull bitterness behind."
"Last swigs: Refreshing Spree candy bite.. $7.99 a 6'er at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, NY."
"Except for the foofy label I couldn't find to much wrong with this beer. It poured a nice orange amber with a three finger head that laced nicely down the glass as I drank it. The aroma was of a sweet orange/bread malts and spicy hops. The taste was of sweet bread and buttery caramel. The bitterness came through with the hops in the end. The mouthfeel is slick at first and well carbinated. There is a gummy mouthfeel afterwards. Overall a middle of the road IPA."
"Drinkability was fine. By the end here, I'm ready to try a few others from the 12 pack before coming back to the other remaining Flower Power in there."
"Pours light orange with a short foamy head, not much retention but a little lacing. Smell is dominated by a nice light flowery hops, citrus notes. Taste is rather light, slightly smooth malts but really centered on the hops, not very bitter though. Very, very carbonated. Refreshing and light, a good light IPA for people who don't like heavy-duty hops."
"This one appears a fairly average amber color, with a fading white bubbly head. Smells a little weak for an IPA, but a nice hop aroma is there. Ehhh, I don't know about the taste. A little too sweet and malty. Really sweet actually. I don't know the ABV, but it seems pretty noticable, and really warming. Less hoppy than is desired. Mouthfeel is a little thick. All in all a little underwhelming. They make a great Nut Brown though."
"Overall the beer is delightfully sweet and munich malty. I'd classify it as more of a bock or american red. Sorry for the low scores, I have to rate it as an IPA, if I were to rate as a bock it would be much higher."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Huge hop taste, amorillo(?), though not overwhelmingly bitter. Quite sweet, lots of body, and crisp. Bitterness, while not real strong, lasts quite a while in the mouth. I like this, but there are lots of better IPAs out there."
"An interesting brew because of the highs and lows. Grapefruit aroma, lace in appearance, refreshing aggressive carbonation. However, a drying leaf aftertaste, bitter drying out grainy like the sucrose toothpaste. A bit of metallic, and a line of dark blood red like a radish in the head of the pour. I would try this on tap, but would want some food right away."
"Pours apricot. Didn't get much head out of it. Good and piney, tastes like is smells, but not overly so. Any easy going sort of IPA. The hops don't over-power the malts. A nice fruity touch as well. Pretty evenly balanced. Good body, with a slight alchohol tang at the end of it. Perhaps my bottle was nearing the end of it's optimal drinking time? Good and tasty, but not overly so."
"On-Tap @ Clarks in Syracuse. Dark red/amber with a nice head of khaki foam. Moderate lacing all over my English pint glass. Aromas are of fresh floral hops, with a sweet bready maltiness and a lovely flowery taste that lingers on the back of the tongue. Taste is quite hoppy up front with some citrus fruit flavors, and some floral accents as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and the drinkability is very good."
"Poured a dark orange colour with a moderate head. The floral aroma was well complimented with hints of citrus fruits and peaches. The taste was fruity as well. It did'nt have much of a hoppy bite that I was expecting. It was more tame. More of a beer for those who didn't like the Double IPA."
"Pours a deep copper with a two finger head that settles nicely leaving big globs of foam down the side of the glass,aromas of pine needles and some nuttiness.Taste is a hop heaven piney and resiny with nutty malt backbone very dry makes you want more.A soapiness in the finish may keep the drinkability a little lower but if you like hops you'll like this for sure,well made and highly drinkable well done."
"Draught: This one pours a very clear amber color. There was a small white head to it. The aroma was pretty good. Its main component was a flowery hopiness, with some spiciness also. The taste had a decent bitterness to it with a good medium malt backbone. Still, it really was more in between an IPA and an APA. Id still have another, however."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 3/4"" creamy light beige head, which fades, but laces well with foamy coating. An orangy amber brew, with a minimal aroma, which is more of malts than hops, unfortunately. Taste is initally light malts, which is taken over by a generic hops character. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both good, could certainly see this as a session brew, but nothing particularly outstanding in any aspect. A reasonable all-purpose brew."
"Pours orangy amber, moderate head, leads to a thin tiny buble film and some lacing. Piney, hop nose. Bready malt base, pleasant,but not overpowering hopping rate here. Fruity,and citric. Soft and well balanced IPA, actually seems British in style. This one will not to it for you if your looking for something wildly hoppy, but its a pleasant IPA/sessioner"
"Very smooth mouthfeel. Not scorchingly hoppy like some IPA's. In fact, this is quite malty. There is a hop presence at first, but it is replaced by a mildly sweet malt flavor by midsip. Not like any IPA I've ever had."
"A big thanks to Shippos for the bottle!"
" Overall: This was a rather disappointing IPA and not a very good example of its style. While very drinkable, this beer would never satisfy a true hophead. The body was also a bit too thin. This would be a good beer or those who are new to the style, but for us hop lovers, there are much better beers out there. This appears to be yet another average beer by a very average brewery. Nevertheless, this is a decent beer and makes for great hot weather drinking as it is quite refreshing and not too heavy on the palate."
"Low carbonation. Tiny white head formed after the pour and faded quickly leaving no lace. Hazy dark golden colored beer. Slightly floral hop and cereal malt flavor becomes bitter midway through and finishes slightly alcoholic. Mild aroma with only a pinch of hops and malty alcohol noticable. With a name like Flower Power I expected a light, more aromatic beer, not a big bitter IPA. Dissapointing."
"This I think would be an excellent choice to convert a non-BA with, especially one who favors sweeter white wines."
"Bottom Line: If this had been available at The Chapter House (or even on tap in the house) when I was in college, I still wouldn’t have graduated!"
"Like, wow, man, this is one mellow IPA! Not much in the way of aroma - this followed a HopDevil, so it had a helluva opening act to live up to, but still, very subdued for an American IPA. The hops are primarily in the flavor and bitterness - they add a pleasant but not overpowering floral/citric/spicy character to the toasty, slightly caramelly malt flavors. A lingering bittersweet flavor finishes it off. Because of the lack of full frontal citrus assault and medium body, you can drink a LOT of these. Not the first choice for a hophead by any mans; however, if your tastes lean toward a more restrained IPA, it's a fine choice."
"Pale gold, three quarter inch or so foamy white head. The aroma is a bit disappointing, lacking any hops. Flavor is good, though this is a relatively mild mannered IPA, in the English style. Light-moderate toasted malt provides the basis for this brew. Light leafy hops accent each taste without being over-the-top. Flower Power is best consumed with a clean palate, as it might be overwhelmed by following a hoppier beer. Good session brew or thirst quenching starter brew before moving on to something more substantial."
