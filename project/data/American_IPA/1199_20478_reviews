"This is a great beer nonetheless!"
""
""
"On tap at Ashley’s, poured into half pint. Slightly hazy golden color with thick white head that clings nicely. Really fresh smell - hop oils, fresh grass/hay, citrus. Flavors are briefly bready, but quickly yield to bitter citrus, grass, and pine. Medium bodied with higher carbonation and an oily but dry finish. Really enjoyed this."

"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Still pretty fresh with a distinct hop profile."

"Overall: This is my favorite IPA i have had from Founders; even better than Double Trouble. The fresh hop character to it is what makes it stand out and the citrus and malt notes round it out superbly. This is one of if not my favorite wet hop ale iv had. I just love that dank quality to it. Its spot on in this style as far as availability goes. Also, at 7.6% abv, this is in that perfect grey area between IPA and IIPA. That being said, i feel this bottle was past its prime with a very subtle malt skunkiness. I can only imagine how much better it is super fresh. When fresh i see myself easily scoring it 4.75. Its that good. Do yourself a favor and seek this out!"

"O - overall a great beer, has the unmistakeable wet hop flavor, very smooth and well balanced. I think the execution is great and it is a perfect example of a fresh wet hopped ale. I get excited every year for Sierra Nevada's fresh/wet hop offerings, and its good to enjoy another brewer's iteration."

"Look forward to having this beer again; fresh, complex, and refreshing taste throughout."

"Found a four pack tucked away at my local bottle shop.  9/30/2014 bottled date.  Overall a very good IPA - probably would have been even better fresher."

"Bursting with flavor! It will make your mouth sing alleluia while your brain takes a bath in dumbfounded glory. Oh sure, I could go into the mouthfeel, the various flavors etc. and try to sound like a real aficionado but that would be so far less appealing that just saying fan-freaking-tabulous! You will experience nirvana while trying to figure out if you can ever drink another beer again that doesn't pale in comparison."

"Awesome IPA.  Toss up between this and Double Trouble as to the best Founder's IPA but awe-inspiring all the same."
""
"The booze was here too but only could be felt once I finished this off and noticed the warming. It couldn't be tasted and was overshadowed by the earthy pine that lingered in the aftertaste. The slight dry-hopped bitterness combined with the balance and soft crystalline sweetness all combined for an amazing mouthfeel that made this irresistible. I loved this beer and am upset that I only have one bottle of this. Founders has a stud of a brew here in a category filled with other heavyweights. If you want to introduce someone to an IPA and what one is capable of, start here. If you love beer, you may want to finish here - balanced beers don't get much better than this."

"Light golden body with a small off white head and moderate lacing.  Citrusy hop aromas and faint malt presence fill the nose.  Taste is a big wave of citrusy hop flavor dominated by grapefruit and barely any malt presence to keep the hops in check.  Medium body and lower carbonation combined with a bitter hop finish and dry ending make this very drinkable.  Overall this is one of the better wet hop IPAs but a touch of balance to keep that bitterness in check could have elevated this one more."

"Tasty tropical fruits and resinous pine. Lots of pine! A great Fresh Hop Ale all around."
"Overall - This beer is all about complexity and balance. There's really alot going on here, and it's all very very good - hops are mostly floral, with plenty of citrus and tropical without being overly sweet. The flavors are so bold and organic, it's hard not to want to gulp this beer, as it's just so deliciously juicy and yet dry mid-palate... find and drink this fresh, a must try."

"Really great grapefruit aroma and taste.  Some pine and grass mixed in there too.  Pretty crisp, clean and has a slight hop bitterness as well.  Not at all what I was expecting but much better!  Glad I had the opportunity to crack one open; well done!"
"Bottled on 9/30/2014 and served in a tulip pint.  Pours a translucent gold with a loose, 1/8th inch, bright white head that quickly dissipates into a froth towards the edges.  Nose expresses grapefruit, floral notes and a hint of spice.  Taste consistent with nose; however, hops presence is a bit subdued.  There's also a pleasant malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an even, lightly crisp carbonation and minimal acidity.  Overall, a decent wet hop beer, but I was expecting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Harvest is a fine ale that hop cravers should greatly enjoy."
"Pours a golden straw colour with a nice white frothy head. The aroma is dank and piney, with hints of fresh mint; very nice. The palate is light to medium bodied with a pleasant fresh hop oily sensation. The flavour is tart with subtle citrus fruit, lemon zest, strong resinous pine, grass, fresh bitter herbs, and white pepper that gives a long bitter finish mingled with subtle malt. This is a very refreshing and distinctively robust wet hop ale."

"Different from other IPA in its mouthfeel and flavor profile. I await it's release each year, and the 2014 version holds true to form."
"big tropical aroma. taste is grapefruit, maybe a little pine. exactly what i'd expect a wet-hopped ale to taste like. phenomenal."
""
"They sure get a lot of flavor outta then hops, though I wouldnt necessarily say that its overwhelming wet-hopped in it's profile (as far as that wet/fresh ""green"" resinous/oily character goes), would be hard to distinguish from non-wet/fresh hopped beers. However, this is still a delicious IPA in its own right that I would seek after"
"Notes: Bottled 9/30/14"
"Awesome beer! The aroma is like a bouquet of pininess, while the taste is well-balanced and crispy."
""
""
"Nice present from the Mrs.... pours golden, smells  of deep dank hops, medium carbonation.  Its very hard to describe hop flavor but this had a floral multipart pallate with a great lingering flavor, strong lingering sweetness."
"Fresh herbal nose with a hint of melon. On tap pours brilliant gold with a ½” white foam cap. Very creamy palate with melon leading to a drying hop finish with a touch of astringency. Medium body and fine soft carbonation."
""
"Overall: A well crafted IPA that gives these beautifully fresh hops the treatment they deserve. Excellent, dank, and well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a clear gold with a thick, white head and lots of bubbles.  Malt in the nose reminds me of a blonde ale - pale and crackery.  Big aromas of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine.   The flavor is light on the malt - very subdued.  Hops flavor is big on tropical fruit and BO.   Alcohol is present.  Mouthfeel is solid and has a very mild carbonation.  An awesome example of a wet hop beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow with a thin fizzy head. The smell is pure hop with a lot of grapefruit coming through. The taste is bitter with some sweetness. The main concern is obviously for the hops and it creates a well balanced stage to show them off. A really well executed and tasting IPA."
""
""
"Had this poured out of the bottle into a pint glass, my third Founders review. The color is goldish-orange, lighter than I would have expected for such a well hopped beer.  The aroma and flavor are both strong plenty of pine and grapefruit, but less heavy than a lot of the genre. The taste gets you as soon as it enters your mouth really excellent."
""
""
"Overall-  My first wet hop ale and it was very good. Very dank with citrus/pine dominating the flavor at first, but balanced nicely by toasted malts.  A little too dry and citrus forward for my liking, but it more than satisfies my recent hop cravings."

"Overall was expecting more fruit and citrus. A bit too much on the bitterness. Pretty heavy brew overall. Halfway through the beer my palate acclimated to the bitterness and the beer tasted much more balanced. The first few sips were around a 3.75, the last few probably ranked in at around 4.25-4.5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well constructed IPA.  The malts actual do come into play early, despite a lighter color to the beer, but the hops do really provide the profile if this beer, just not a huge ""in-your-face"" profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I really love this beer, especially the taste. Hate the fact that it's seasonal, too. This is my favorite beer by Founders, and I implore them to offer it year-round. Perhaps that would take from the mystique. Today marks the 41st anniversary of Hall and Oates' Abandoned Luncheonette. No, I'm not in my upper 60's like they are; in fact, my mother is subdued in age to the group I'm most glad she introduced me to while growing up. What does all this mean? I have no idea. All I know is that this beer surpasses Founders' Centennial and All Day. For that alone, it should be on rotation. For reasons undefined, it's not. I take one sip and I hear Daryl crooning: She's gooooone, oh why, I better learn how to face it, she's gone. Yes, she is, but she was damn good while she lasted."
""
""
""
"Good beer, not sure I would buy it again at the price.  Also, the malt body is a bit over powering for my taste."

""

"41/50"

"Overall. Big juicy oily leafy green hops here. Sure to satisfy that hop craving."
""
""
""
""
""
"Worked hard to land a $76 case. Def more expensive and harder to find than last year! Great nose and likewise on the pour. Super grapefruit juicy hop taste. Overall like it but not absolute top tier for me. Thinking of throttling back on the brew scene til hopslam, sucks 12 ouncers et al hit in January."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression:  A very dry, very bright American IPA.  While bitter and a mouthful of hops, the light body and low malt character make this immensely drinkable.  Another winner from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a real treat, with an incredibly hop forward rush of flavors. I can smell a lot of tropical fruit on the nose. It has a soapy bubbly mouthfeel. I find that the finish lingers for some time, with a simultaneous presence of toasted malt and bitter reminiscence of the dank wet hop flavor. This beer has a cloudy, colloidal golden wheat color."

"Beautiful golden yellow colour.  Fine lacing and head in a snifter from draft at Al's of Hampden.  Weird medicinal taste mid palate.  Aroma light and floral.  Body very light.  At 7.6% this beer lacks a malty backbone and takes the concepts of hop forward to a place I do not like, sorry.  I did not even finish the glass."

"Overall, just a wonderful beer for those who love IPA but really love the subtlety of a balanced fresh hop one.  Amazing, wish it could be more than an October thing."

"Overall very drinkable but you still get a good amount of hop bitterness"

"The beer pours a bubbly white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a light amber that  borders on gold. The beer is clear and, therefore, obviously filtered. The smell has a strong tropical citrus and pine notes with a slightly bready note at the end that makes the smell rather sweet. The taste is similar to the smell. The taste starts off with a citrus and slightly piney hop taste with a slight malt sweetness at the end and in the aftertaste. The beer has a very hoppy aftertaste that lingers for a while. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a bit of carbonation. The beer also has a slightly sticky afterfeel. Overall, a fantastic beer and one worth getting again. The only regret is that it's not more widely available."

"Extremely hard to find as i checked at numerous places all october.  I luckily scored the only case one beer place received this year.  Bottled 10/1/14.  Smells great and unique.  Wonderful color and nice thick creamy head.  From the first sip you can tell this is the real deal......beautiful whole fresh hops.  Tastes of raw raw hops, fruity sweet, and canibus.  Each sip lingers and leaves you craving for more.  Forget pliny.  Get yourself a harvest ale.  Cheers and thank you founders for this work of art!"

"Overall:  Not at all what I was expecting.  I was expecting a much juicier, tropical/citrus hop bomb.  Bitterness is high, but body is light and crisp.  Non of the classic ale fruitiness.  If you told me this was a continental pilsner, I would have believed you."

"SO Juicy and fresh, this is one of the best wet-hopped beers I have ever had. Hard to get but well worth it, try some, you will love it."

"The beer pours golden yellow with a billowing white head, and the smell is immediate and intensely of mangoes and citrus, very inviting. Taste is much like the smell bright citrus and tropical fruits lots of flavor, very lovely. Mouthfeel is great, very smooth well carbonated, not boozy, a pleasure to drink. This beer is fantastic; a great appearance, great smell, lots of flavor and great texture, falls a little short in the finish though as it lacks a final punch. Fantastic beer; I will savor these."
""
"An amazing IPA. Smells of sweet citrus that mixes nicely with sweet malt. The beer is crystal clear. Less carbonation than what's typical of the style. Tastes of grapefruity hops. Malt is there too, leaving a bready/biscuity flavor. This is classic act from Founders."
""
""
"Zestoman"
"This beer ends great as well and leaves a lingering fruity hop note in the mouth. This is a great beer. The only downside I could see to this is that it comes pretty dear in expensive four packs, and that it is competing with Breakfast Stout for my money."

"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a fairly clear straw yellow color. There was a small white head and it left some lacing. The aroma is a bit milder. Some malts, citrus and earthy hops, and slightly musty. The taste is good. Nice malt body. Somewhat tart/bitter flavor. Some pine and lemon hops. Nice."

"Poured from 12 oz glass into large tulip glass. A slighty hazy golden ale with a finger or so of white head and minimal lacing. Aroma was a little muted. Not sure the age of the bottle I got, but it could have been on the shelf for a while. I couldn't find a date. Some citrus and pine combined with caramel. Taste was very good, but again the hops had probably faded a bit as they are not 'in your face'. Nice balance of sweet caramel and bitter hops with just a bit of citrus and pine flavor. Overall, its good but I was hoping for more from this. Its solid and I'll try it again, but hopefully a fresher bottle."

"taste is sweet and honey-like up front with (almost) an explosion of fruit and caramel sweetness at the end. wow. biscuit sweet up front, caramel sweet at the end. slightly bitter hop in the middle. this is awesome. and it's old? someone else nailed it saying ""lemon, orange and white grapefruit"". that is exactly how this one tastes, and he was speaking from an older bottle also. this one is awesome. extremely sessionable and a 7.6% on top of that!! I can drink this on all day!!!!"

"poured a golden yellow in color with slight orange highlights, a good thin chunky head that left good bead like lacing on the glass. It had a nice earthy leafy aroma upfront on the nose, hints of citrus, underlying grain notes and mild hop character. The hops came through more on the palate alongside some citrus notes, slight bitter flavor, bready grains and a touch of earthiness. The brew was light in body with a fair amount of carbonation and a clean crisp finish."

"I've never been a big fan of Founders' hop forward offerings, but this is extraordinarily good, and would hold up quite well even months after its bottling date. Granted, it's definitely best while its fresh, but this is perhaps my favorite everyday wet hopped beer if I've ever had one. Not their most complex offering, but it delivers the goods exactly as it should be."

"Surprise, surprise. Another great IPA from Michigan. California are you paying attention? This one caught me by surprise with how great it was. My first wet hopped IPA. Poured from a bottle into a stamddard pint glass. Generous head that quickly fades but leaves nice lacing on the glass. Nose is just a bit piney compared to other IPA's I've had. Maybe it's th wet hopped style. Very clear compared to other IPA's as well. Taste is fantastic. It's delicious. This is so good it's almost sessionable. Wow! I think this is better than Founders Centenntial IPA. I love this beer!"

"Overall I'm impressed once again by a Founders beer. This is a style I used to abhor (bad opinions or bad experience, I can't say for sure) but Founders is the brewery that finally won me over. Harvest Ale is in almost the exact style that I used to hate--high bitterness, floral/pine taste--but they've done it in a uniquely delicious and refreshing way that has changed the way I see beer once again."

"500th review!"

"Pours pale dirty gold with a ring of white foam. Pine grassy nose. Light malt, tasty, with an interspersed bitter. Even balanced flavor. Breadys, grains. Little citrus. Very nice - simple yet refined, and full of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A really nice, refreshing, fresh, hoppy ale. This falls somewhere between a pale ale and an IPA for me, with an abundance of hops. The mouthfeel is great -- this is a very drinkable beer. Very little alcohol is detectable. Honestly, I'd like to compare this to Zombie Dust with a slightly heavier malt profile."

"Liquid gold. I could do this review in one word, juicyfruit. Yesterday's 2 bottles were superb, and I'm glad I have 2 more. Beautiful golden color, nice wet hop aroma, distinct simcoe, and beautifully malted. What really stands out is the fresh hop citrus flavors that explode on the palate, balance the key here. Really perfect juicyfruit mix, lemon, pineapple, grapefruit finish. Very smooth and easy drinking, though the second does get a little sugary sweet in the finish. Amazing, last year I passed on this because I really didnt care for it the year before. This is my third four pak, the beer is even better now than one month ago as the fresh, green piney notes have dimmed, leaving the citrus to shine. One of this years best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: What more can be said - this is one of the finest IPAs out there"
""
"Poured a clearish orang with one finger head that left lace patches. A spicy, zesty, wet floral hop aroma with a good amount of caramel and bread malt as well. The balance on this beer is amazing b/c at times it's almost sticky sweet, then there is a bready fullness, almost chewey beer, and then it has this sharp, cutting hoppiness of grassy and wet hops. Really comes together and there's a crisp finish on the backend that is pleasing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty & well-made"
""
""
"Really a beautifully made beer. It's everything I hoped for. So easy to drink. I see where jay ashmore could say there are some shortbread cookies here. Dry but with the oils this has a fairly big mouthfeel. Delicious."
""
""
"World class"
""
"Pours golden with a nice lingering off white head. The nose is of hops, mostly grapefruit then followed by pine. Exceptionally well balanced and complex flavor, with the focus being on hop flavor rather than bitterness against a solid malt backbone. Hop grapefruit flavor is the most prevalent. Light medium body, well carbonated. Nice crisp finish with a lingering grapefruit flavor against a slight bitterness. The best IPA I have had to date. A wet hopping masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a wonderfully tasty beer, but not one I'm sure quite lives up to the comparatively increased effort it takes to get this one compared to say, Red's Rye, FBS, Founders Porter, etc. I'm actually pretty excited to see how my perception of the beer changes, if at all, as I work my way through the rest of the 4-pack."

"Thank you Founders. Keep up the good work!"

"A solid fresh hop beer. Lacks a little in the overall drinkability department and misses a bit on the malts, but the hops are mighty tasty. Definitely worth picking up a 4-pack/year at minimum."

"O: Another stellar offering from Founders. In my top five of all the ""wet-hop"" brews I've tried."
""
""
"O - okay, I don't remember this being so hard to find a few years back.. So if you see this grab it! its that good.. But still, if you can get this when its released, do it! One of the best Fall time Harvest ales ever created and remains a brilliant all-star in Founders' star studded yearly lineup. This is an ipa a brewery should be proud of and clearly after tasting it you'll see why. Top notch Harvest IPA."
""
"I was at a beer tasting and was talking about IPAs. A guy recommend I try this as a must. We searched the extensive cooler and inside the walk-in cooler behind the displays of beer was an open case with two 4 packs in it. I took it home. I poured in a stAndard pint Nice color with a generous white head. A nice citrus smell came to my nose. I took a taste. Awesome! A nice full bodied, hoppy, smooth bitter beer. Thank you stranger from the beer tasting. Go out and buy now!!"
"Love it. Want to make this 4 pack last."

"Decent medium body, slightly round, good carbonation level. I love a good wet hopped beer (or dry hopped, or not hopped, or... well I just really love good beer), and this is a pretty good one. Given Founders pedigree and the style, I was hoping for a bit more, though. That's like saying Peyton Manning 'only' had 250 and two touchdowns, though. Ultimately the bottom line is this is a very good beer. Just because I was hoping for phenomenal should not take away from the truth of that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid IPA all around and one of the smoothest IPAs I've had in a long time. Great Job Founders! Grab a 4-pack if you can and give it a try."

"O- This is an excellent beer. I wish I could have tried this a little fresher, but after about a month, it still tastes fresh. It's crisp and a great IPA. I would drink this year round if I had the opportunity."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, and slightly sticky on the back-end. Not quite as dry as I was hoping, but acceptable. Overall, this is a wonderful wet-hopped beer. I look forward to this sub-style each year, and this is one of the favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I may have gotten a slightly old bottle, considering this was a wet hop IPA and it tastes like a pale ale. But it's still delicious and refreshing."
"Pours a hazy light golden orange color with a finger length rocky head. Dissipates slowly into a thick, soapy lacing. Smells of grapefruit, lots of floral notes, pine, dank, sweet carmel undertones as well. Taste starts with the grapefruit, some pine, along with quite a bit of bitterness. Then in the middle, the malt mellows out the bitterness. Get a lightly toasted flavor as well as a good amount of carmel sweetness. Then on the back end that sweetness blends nicely with the fruit flavors that have lingered throughout. Get a bubblegum flavor, along with some grapefruit, floral, and pine, and dank. Bitterness lingers, but is mellow. Nice carbonation that makes the beer crisp, refreshing, and easy to drink. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Well done wet hopped IPA."
""
""
"The feel is a rather thin, and slick at times. There was some fizzy effervescence on the tongue but it seemed watery none the less."
""
""
""
"EDIT: Ohio gets this late, so my review should reflect that this 'fresh hop' beer isnt so fresh~"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a really great wet-hopped ale. There are a lot of different hop flavors in there, and it's fun to compare each sip to the last and feel it changing. It's really great, but I think it would have been perfect with a little less alcohol, and maybe just a little ""smaller."""
"pours a  clear  light amber,  billowing white head.  settles to a thin layer,a few thin rings on the glass.  smell:  grapefruit, floral, nectarines,  light biscuit.  taste:  sweet orange citrus,  peach,  leafy,  honey, acidic.  drying  but slightly sticky finish.  very nice.  early oct  bottling"
""
""
""
"I look forward to getting my hands on this beer every year. Unfortunately, this really doesn't live up to the greatness of past years. It truly deserved the hype. The fresh hop presence is subdued this time around. It's pleasant, but this is a very expensive beer in my parts. I'd take the far less costly fresh hop SN Celebration this year (it's excellent) over Founders even if Founders were the same price! Disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pouring this beer into a Dogfish Head tulip reveals a beautiful golden orange color with wonderful clarity. A snow white head settles into a white ring leaving minimal lacing. Intense aromas of grapefruit, pine resin, pineapple, and, well, wet hops fill your nose. Layers of hops coat the palate followed by a massive amount of citrus and a light touch of yeast. Great acidity makes your mouth water for more followed by the quintessential hop bitterness. A classic IPA that I wish was made year round, but you have to remember it's made with the first hops of the season. This is something to look forward to each year."
"This is really nice. I like the greenness of the hops in this. Not too bitter, either. Very well done."
""
""
""
"I bet this one is not considered one of the better years for this Harvest Ale. This is okay, but nothing like the exceptional beer that has been advertised in previous years."
""
"Pours a nice straw color, pretty clear and a very modest head. The smell is classic citrus hops, not too strong, but noticeable and nice. The taste follows suit. It tastes exactly how a good, solid American IPA should taste. It won't knock any socks off, but it's very good and you'd enjoy this any time. Reminds me of Sculpin."
""
""
"O- one of the cleanest and freshest tasting IPAs out there, loving the minty notes and so easy to drink, even at 7.6%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: for the hype I heard about this beer i was expecting like a dry(wet) hop blast in the face but it's not. A bit underwhelming but still a nice clean refreshing brew."
"O: The low level of bitterness makes this extremely drinkable. The hops have faded a bit unfortunately, but they’re still noticeable and the malt remains in check."
"Straw orange color with a one finger white head in the snifter. Some lacing throughout. Fresh hop aroma with pine, citrus and fresh cut grass. A little musty as well. The taste is similar but with a very modest, well balanced bitterness. It is tremendously smooth, sippable and leaves very little hoppy mustiness. It finishes crisp, and not overly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O One of my favorites of the style. Near perfect. It is so clean and fresh and bitter yet has some balance. Oh, so good."
""
""
""
""
"My recommendation: Fresh Hop beers are meant to be drank fresh. If you’re an IPA fan this is a must have and you have to get it soon! Terrific brew!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is another classic brew from Founder's. Very fresh and something I can easily and happily see myself enjoying over and over again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great food pairing beer or session/hang out beer. The hops don't come out to shine and define themselves, but it still is really nice drinking and hoppy."
""
""
""
""
"O- A superb example of fresh hops and very crisp and enjoyable to have on a sunny fall afternoon, just wish Michigan had more of those. A lot of hype behind this beer, think most of that is it's Founders and it's so seasonal and can be hard to find. Thought this was similar to Double Trouble but with more aromatic hops than bitter."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was expecting a little more, but a great fresh hop brew nonetheless."
"Overall- Enjoyed everything except the taste. Not sure if it was a bad bottle but it had a good deal of mustiness that I didn't care for, everything else was good for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Flat out phenomenal IPA. I feel this gets overlooked sometimes amidst the heavy hitters in Founders' portfolio. Don't make that mistake."
""
""
"12oz Bottle poured into a pint glass. Very small amount of head. It is a golden, hazy almost amber color. Has a nice citrus smell, but nothing over the top. The flavor is good. Some Orange, Citrus up front. It does have a bitter finish which lingers a little bit. This is not a heavy beer, its fairly medium for mouthfeel. Overall I feel this has a good balance of the citrus and bitterness,although I was not expecting the bitter to last as long after each sip, still a very drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
"O - As one would expect from Founders, this is a terrific beer. It is a little more bitter than I care for in an IPA. I like more citrus, but I will drink a lot of these while in season."
""
"Slightly hazy, straw colored. Kind of an uninspiring head with only splotchy lacing. Fortunately, things only get better. Wonderfully fresh hop aromas of citrus and resiny pine. Swirl the glass, take a whiff, and grapefruit rind becomes more apparent. One of the most aromatic IPAs I've had. Sharp bitterness greets the tongue, leading to a pithiness and dryness on the finish. 70 IBUs sounds about right. The malt body is well in the background, light and cracker-like. Bitter citrus rind and some resin are at the forefront. Mouthfeel hits all the right notes with respect to carbonation and hop oils. Having tried this, my enthusiasm for Sierra Nevada Celebration is admittedly dulled a bit - Founders Harvest truly showcases the beauty of fresh, wet hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color with a thick white head. Smells of pine and citrus. Mouthfeel of sticky chewy hops. Taste is of resinous piney hops with citrus flavors of tangerine and orange. Nice slightly bitter finish. Overall an awesome example of a freshly wet hopped ale. Will be anxiously awaiting this next year."

"Not as brightly flavored as I had hope but pungent hop flavor for sure. Medium bodied, light prickly carbonation, almost no malt presence whatsoever so you do really get to taste the hops. Lots of pine and bitter rinds flavor throughout, along with being super resinous. Bitterness is bold but oddly not overwhelming. Not balanced but one of the most pleasing and refreshing bitter flavors I've ever tasted. There is a touch of alcohol heat but that's probably because the malt presence barely exists. Overall a pretty nice beer. It's limited availability kind of sucks but still pretty good."
""
"Pours a deep amber with one finger of white head that dissipates quickly. The nose has a smell of grapefruit and some sweeter citrus fruits like orange, papaya, and mango. I get that same grapefruit and sweet citrus profile on the front of the tongue, which reminds me of Cigar City Jai Alai, but then it leaves a stinging bitterness with not much of a malt backbone to balance out the taste. The body is medium with a high carbonation that intensifies the sting you get from the bitterness. An interesting beer, and a good one, but not among my favorite IPAs."
"A masterpiece. What a single IPA should be."

"O - Great beer, except for the onion in the finish, which ruins it to a certain extent for me. I really appreciate the orange, mango, grapefruit mix though. Its worth a try."
""

"Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. A nice change of pace from the extreme-hopped IPAs that dominated the summer. This goes down easy, tastes very fresh, and is very refreshing. Very glad to get a 4-pack of this."
""
""
""
"Crisp golden color that's fairly transparent with limited thin white head. The lack of head from an appropriate pour was slightly odd. The smell is piney with citrus rind. The taste is near perfect. Enough brightness and citrus on the front that blends into a piney bitterness with a clean, crisp finish. You can tell this beer is fresh and it shines. Really hit the spot, and it's a top notch ale. You do get a hint of the booze on the finish too."

"UPDATE 11/7/14: First bottle of the 2014 release, bottled 9/30/14, purchased in Northampton last Wednesday for the same price as last year.   Little to change from the review above from last year, except the head was much thinner, half finger at best, and this one had fewer grassy notes early on.  Still very enjoyable and easy going."

"Overall (4.25): Sorta-lacking appearance aside, everything else about this beer is quite a bit above average to excellent. It kind of reminds me of older-school American IPAs that don’t focus so heavily on juicy-sweet citrus on the palate and put more into the bitterness—which is well-crafted, moderately complex, and very satisfying. This is a damn good beer and a great use of wet hops."
"Overall: Probably the best wet hopped IPA I've had to date, a must try for hop heads."
"Overall: Very well balanced and pleasant. The flavors are a bit more subdued than I was expecting, but it is well crafted with nothing negative in sight. For a bigger IPA, this is very refreshing and crisp. I could drink plenty of this one."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with herbal and spicy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid fresh hop quality in both the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a pretty good brew but not enough to separate into the category of limited specialty releases"
""
"Its a straightforward, well-crafted American IPA. None of this hoopla about wet hops or this or that, if you just consider it as an American IPA, this is a very well-balanced, drinkable and refreshing IPA. However- I'll have to be honest- as far as wet hop IPAs go, this is pretty tame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid IPA, very reminiscent of Jai Alai and Flower Power. The taste can't quite live up to the incredible aroma, but it's by no means poor. Buy it while it's fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very well balanced IPA. Another excellent seasonal from Founder's. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it's good. Founders, being who they are, set my expectations way too high. A really solid beer, but I can't put it in the 95-96 range that it has on BA. Definitely worth a shot."
""
"I often find that most breweries who produce a wet hopped beer feel the need to make it so hop-centric that the bitterness becomes more a focus than the actual hop flavor. Founders Harvest Ale is unfortunately no exception to this. If they could perhaps dial up the malts and create more balance and body in the beer, this could be fantastic."
""
" I loved this and thought it had just the right malt presence for a tremendous hop character that even showed off the herbal aspects of the hops as gently as possible alongside a terrific amount of fruit."
""
"Final Thoughts: So not the best wet-hop beer out there but worth a try fresh. Unfortunately the citrus in the aroma didn't manifest in the flavor. It's hard to knock a beer when it doesn't have any noticeable flaws but this one just didn't do it for me. At least it was reasonably priced. Would I drink it again? Maybe."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a damn good wet hop ale. Recommended to be drank asap!"
""
""
""
""
"Really love the Mouthfeel on this beer, For me the flavor and smell is to close to a dry hopped IPA.... I do not get the super fresh smell I expect from my wet hop beers. Still a great beer though. Give it a shot!"

"Rich, deep flavor. Nothing's jumping out, but everyone is playing together in harmony. Not too hoppy, but definitely ""wet"". 7.6 is definitely on the board, but it's so well disguised and it's super pleasant. You could down several of these and wonder which bus hit you!? ...I like this bus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was my first Harvest Ale, and was quite enjoyable! I look forward to having some more through out the season!"
""
"O - Well, this ended up being one of my first wet-hopped beers and it did not disappoint. Overall a very well balanced IPA. Would've preferred it to be a bit more hoppy, but that's just my personal preference. Will definitely be enjoying again in the near future, assuming I can find it again in my area"
"Overall - I thoroughly enjoy this beer, one of my top IPAs. I wish they could Harvest fresh hops all year long! I was lucky enough to score the last 4 pack in a local liquor store."
""
""
"O - A truly enjoyable fresh hopped IPA that Founders has brewed. I look for it every fall."
""
""
""
""
""
"This has one of the best feels of any IPA I've had. It's light bodied with a completely hidden ABV. Barely drying to keep you drinking. Founders always makes quality stuff, but this is several steps above quality. Price point is slightly high, but not out of this world. I will be getting more of this."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled 10/2/13 excellent! It ways in at 7.6% now. Pours a yellow orange, with a beautiful sticky one inch white head, not a ton of lace, but attractive stuff that does stick behind. Smell is very floral, mango, tangerine, hints of Marijuana, and pine. Taste is bigger than the nose would have expect, just delicious fresh hops, floral and tropical in the start and some dank marijuana and grapefruit in the finish. Body is large for a single IPA, almost an extra IPA to me, perfect amount of life, not really dry, and so dang drinkable. Going to drink many of these in the next month."
"Anytime you can get beer this fresh (less then two weeks old) is a good thing and it had a chance to mature. Sadly even in this crowded field that is the American IPA style this beer doesn't stand out as it should."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very well done wet hop ipa, not too bitter and not a huge malt presence makes for a pretty good balance. Hops are the star here for sure but no lingering bitterness despite the sticky hop resins. A great brew, I'm glad I got ahold of a four pack and I'd definitely grab more given the chance this fall."
""
"Mouthfeel is awesome also. Carbonation is mild and the light grain keeps it soft. Lots of hop oils and resin give this a huge sticky feel with a relatively mild bitterness. This gives it a medium body but keeps it highly drinkable."
""
"Founders Harvest Ale ---4/5."
""
""

"D - I first had this when it was considered a APA, with a considerably lower abv. Seems like such a more refined brew since then, with such clean hops and a balanced sweetness."

"Pours a lovely copper with a quickly dissipating thin white head. Nose of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine with some bready malt notes. Outstanding aroma. Bitterness throughout the palate. Grapefruit and pine are nicely balanced by a sweet malt. Finishes dry and lemony. Very smooth. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a well crafted wet hopped brew very much worth seeking out."

"Deep orange in body with white bubbly head that stays on top. Aroma of oranges and cream, grass, pineapple, and pine. Flavors of big citrus, grass, pine, mint, and a whitewash of booze with sour rind aftertaste. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The booze is a bit much and holds the beer back."

"Bottle from a trade with a friend back in Michigan. Pours clear bright golden with very little head. Fantastic hop aroma: citrus, honey, pine. Just takes your breath away. All hops on the flavor with a slick mouthfeel, the bitter pine and grapefruit combonation is extremely crisp on the palate. This is beer candy. Nice bitterness. Great fresh hop!"

"The aroma is strongly hoppy, with fruity, floral, spruce and herbal hop elements. Likewise the flavor is a complex mix of hoppy elements with only a faint malt base. The malt is certainly in here, however, because the flavor is only moderately bitter, even in the finish. The flavor is better, and less piney, than the aroma. A sessionable yet strong IPA."
""
"I had a 4-pack of fresher bottles this year. And this is better than I remember. Review and scores adjusted slightly."

"Bottled on 10/4/12 and poured into a snifter on 12/16/12, brew pours a clear and pale washed out yellow gold under a white head. An alluring nectar sweet hop forward aroma gently lifts into the nose with hints of lemon rind and pine. Lush hops glide through in the mouth feel with nonabrasive but dominating bitterness. Smooth flowing, incredibly well balanced IPA packed with all that hop goodness. An instant classic in my book. Can't help but think how great this would go with spicy Tex-Mex fajita tacos..."
"I like it because it's a nice change of pace from the typical ""pale ale"" I get in Georgia."

"Bottled 10/04/12. Pours an almost-clear golden color with an orange hue. Medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite citrusy with very mellow malt profile. Lovely, piney aroma with some nice orange and pineapple scents. Taste is just as it smells. I love how this one lacks in the malt department. Great for not being from the west side. Delicious, well-balanced bitterness with great pine and citrus flavors. Citrus rules here, but there is a hint of tropical hops. Great bitter finish with a bit of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a crisp, refreshing finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a great IPA that I wish I had readily available over here in California (I know it's greedy of me)."
""
"O: Very enjoyable with really nice hop aromas and flavors but still well balanced between the malts and hops so it is not overly bitter. The smell is very enticing and this beer does not disappoint. Definitely one of my favorite of the fresh hop IPAs available in the fall. Easy to drink and just about sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Another winner from founders. While I prefer some of their other IPA's, this is still a delicious and well crafted brew. The herbal/grassy notes work well for the holiday season."
""
"O: Good beer -- the thing is Troegs is doing this with Perpetual IPA at a lower price beer that's available all year long. And, I'd even take a six pack of Sculpin for $17 over a four pack or Harvest for $11. Good beer -- if you haven't tried then do so, but there's similar beer out there with a better value. I'd rather see Founders do an Ocktoberfest or Pumpkin Ale for there Fall seasonal."
""
"Medium body and carbonation, right on the money for an IPA. The best of the fresh hop beers of the year, I think, but maybe I’m not as crazy about this sub-style anymore as many others seem to be these days."
""
""
""
""
"D - Smells better than it tastes. It's just too... polite. It's reasonably accessible, but I'm not sure it shows me anything I haven't seen before. Disappointment here."
"Another great from Founders. Overall, a tasty and complex harvest ale. One of the best, if not the best autumn beer this year. Scoop some off the shelf if you still can. Can't wait till next year!"
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite Founders IPA. One of six or seven beers that I look forward to when the fall approaches, and high on that particular list."
""
"Overall: This is a pretty damn good IPA. The hop intensity isn't as much as say a SN Hoptimum but this may be on the level of a Maine Beer Co. Lunch which may be my favorite IPA. Another Founders brew that impresses. Founders is quickly becoming my brewery of choice. Well done."

"o - super fresh = super delicious."

"Bright clear gold in the glass with a creamy pure white head of fine bubbles, color is a bit light for an IPA. Fresh clean citrus hops are in the forefront of the smell with a bit of pale malt in the base. Well there is no doubting that this is an IPA as the taste is all hops. The west coast citrusy hops dominate upfront and all the way to the finish with lemon, orange and grapefruit flavors combined on top of enough malt to provide balance. The mouthfeel is right for an IPA with good body and carbonation, the hops provide great tingly liveliness and a puckeringly dry finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA, wet hop character provides assertive bitterness and the clean hop flavors are just great, I'm definitely pleased."
""
""
"O - Unbelievably fresh, which is exactly what you want in a wet hop IPA."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. There was such a floral blend of hops, with earth and citrus, while sweetness and light malts came in to cut and balance. This left the drinker feeling light and airy, and excited to sip. This was, however, disappointing. The flavoring was relatively one-dimensional, with huge, raw bitterness from start to finish. While this gave nice robustness to the palate, it really washed away many of the other balancing aromatics. The feel was equally as thin, and felt a little cheap off the lip, taking away further from the experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice beer, but I must say its up against some stiff competition. Beers like Celebration, chasing freshies and other wet hop IPAs make this one seem ordinary. It's good, not great."
"O- I think ""Decent"" best describes this brew. Very well done and subtle. Absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it's not really a beer to brag about having. Still wishing we had a 1/4 point rating system for reviews. This is probably more of a 3.85 than a 3.5."

"This was totally enjoyable. I could see this easily as one of my great summer beers"

"O-tasty fresh hop bomb that is a good drinker"
""
""
"bright blond body. head is white with good retention. aroma is a blend of citrus and pine in an american hop symphony. body is sweet enough to provide some backbone to a lot of bitterness. hop flavor is super piney. solid carb on a medium body. everything you would want and expect from a wet hopped brew. certainly worth picking up if you can get it fresh."
"O - This is a great use of the fresh, wet hops to give the beer a nice clean bite that hopheads will love. I like the nice thick resin that remains from using these hops and wish more breweries took the foray into this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dry from the hops and doesn't excite too much. I'll take an Odell."
"Filtered lighter orange, white head of a finger or two. Good lace and a decent bit of retention. Nose has some sweet malt with some piney/herbal hops right up front. Some citrus and grass. Taste has a sweet sugary, biscuity malt before more bitter citrus, pine and grassy bitterness. Juicy and good fruit notes. Lighter medium feel which is nice for the ABV, medium carbonation. Bitterness is moderate. A tasty, and relatively light harvest ale - very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation that foams the liquid slightly on the palate, creating a generally smooth flowing sip. Finish is dry."
""
"Overall, love it. Probably my favorite hopped up beer from Founders."
""
"O - I do not believe this is the freshest bottle but it still is a great hoped up harvest ale. Slides down almost to easy and I want more. Oh my these could get dangerous. Its worth a try if you like harvest ales, and you will not be disappointed with the hops profile because the flavor stands out the most, Cheers!"

"I've had these within a couple weeks of bottling the last two years and they are not nearly as juicy, hoppy, fruity as 2012.  too bad."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of a wet hopped beer, it's all about the fresh hops as it should be and the hops speak for themselves , you can tell that Founders used some high quality hops while brewing this beer. This beer had good drinkability, if I was really in the mood for hops I could see drinking two of these, they were pretty smooth and not overly bitter with more then enough flavor to hold my attention, I wish I could drink this all year round. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was spectacular, it had that dank and resinous hops aspect combined with a great bouquet of tropical fruits that seemed to steal the show, one of the best aromas I have ever encountered. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, after drinking a few of these I can't think of one single thing I didn't like or would change, this beer is great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's a little pricey, but it's worth every penny, if this was available year round it would be a regular in my fridge, I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes hoppy beers, I don't think fresh hopped beers can get much better then this one, it's for sure worth seeking out. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, it really delivered that huge punch of fresh hopped flavor and aroma that made this beer very enjoyable. Founders Harvest Ale, is now my favorite wet hopped beer, it's so damn good it's now my favorite hoppy beer from Founders, they really did an awesome job with this beer, it blew my mind with just how tasty this beer was, great job guys, with beers like this it's no wonder that Founder's is one of the best Brewery in the country, I highly recommend this one."

"I love this IPA, overwhelmed me, when i was expecting just another fresh hop IPA."
""
""
""
"Taste is rich and pungent hops, with more pineapple, grapefruit, and orange goodness. A firm malt counterbalance is in place here, too, resulting in a deliciously balanced IPA. As good an IPA as I've had. Will track down more of these!"

"O- damn good wet hop. Founders delivers, as usual"

""
"This beer is on the same level as High Tide, but is definitely a step down from Surly."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle with Bottled 10/04/12 on the neck. Pours a translucent golden yellow color with no head. Minimal lacing. Outstanding aroma of juicy tropical and citrus fruits. Pineapple, sweet orange, and mango. The taste is more of the fruits with some nice hop bitterness. Insanely drinkable. The ABV isn't that high (6.5) but I would have thought it was even lower than that. Some malt and floral hops at the finish along with bitter orange peel. Overall, damn good IPA worth seeking out."
""
"O: Very good beer. Easily the best fresh hop brew I've had this year."
"I will definitely be buying this one again. Great beer overall."

"Poured into a dogfish pint glass. Nice slightly hazy burnt yellow color, head dissipates rather quickly. Wonderfully citrusy smell, I know it will be good. I think wet hop IPAs are my new favorite style, why only once a year?!?! Just a great balanced and hoppy taste. Pretty light malt to let the nuanced hops really shine. Not a hop bomb, but just perfectly highlighted in this beer. I know founders has some solid beers, but this is definitely one of my favorites from them. So glad I was able to pick up 2 four packs of it. Can't wait to get more next year!"
""
"O: Once you get past the cat pee part of the nose, this is good stuff. Goes down pretty easy but with plenty of juicy, resiny hop flavor and bitterness for the hophead."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a really good wet hop beer. I am really glad to have this beer as a local beer. Great price point and really nice hop profile! Can go wrong with picking this 4pk especially if your a hophead."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: wow I love this stuff did not see that coming tastes fresh and crisp but still a hop forward well balanced ipa seems true to style. Bravo founders yet another one I will get again"
"Overall, not mind blowing, but better than the 3 Floyds Broo Doo, which is the only other wet hop ale I've had. Decent balance of hops bitterness and underlying malt, but it could be better."
""
"O: Surprisingly fresh after about a month and not what I expected from a brewer in the Midwest. But these days, fresh hop harvests can be shipped overnight so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. This can compete with all of the great West Coast fresh hop beers that I've tried. Phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was very pleased with this offering. It's just how I like my IPA's...hoppy with not too much malt. The smell and the flavor match very closely. This was my first beer from Founder's, but I'm excited to try some others."
"Citrus and floral smells. Resin and citurs tastes. Very delicious flavor, unique in the IPA world. drinks smooth. Really a great all around beer that I wish was available year round and in 6 packs."
""
"I'm really digging this beer, but why is it so under-carbonated? Drinkability and flavor are excellent, though the aroma and overall hop character would come through much more if there were some decent carbonation. More bubbles would make this beer an absolute knock-out IPA. (4)"
"Founders Harvest Ale pours surprisingly light. It's goldenrod in color and crystal clear, topped by a finger and a half or so of white foam. Head retention is pretty good, and does a nice job of coating the glass with lacing. The nose is wonderfully floral, with a strong grapefruit aroma supported by a secondary pineapple note. The flavor does allow the malt bill a little room to feature as well. Bready and more caramel flavors are both appreciable. The bitter bite is attention grabbing, but not palate scorching. As with the aroma, the finish features a strong grapefruit presence, offset by a subtle tropical fruit, pineapple flavor. The body isn't quite bone dry, but it's damn close. The carbonation falls just short of being lively enough to make the mouthfeel great. Founders Harvest Ale is a delightful IPA, better than Centennial in my opinion, and it's a shame it only comes around once a year."
""
""
"O - A very delicious and well balanced wet hop ale. I could drink this all day (and presumably pass out). Get it while its nice and fresh!"
""

"O: This beer is very drinkable while still delivering lots of hop flavors."
""

"I haven't reviewed a beer in a long time so please pardon my rust. I AM VERY EXCITE FOR THIS ONE! Poured a hazy amber/orange color with a 2 finger width foamy white head. The lacing stuck around for awhile. I pop the cap and pour. WOAH! Floral and citrusy hop flavors dominate. Taste is full of resiny hop juiciness.Very floral and citric with a nice tropical fruit touch at the end.Medium bodied beer with a nice crispy feel from the carbonation. Delicious and super drinkable despite the decent amount of bitterness. Fruity hop juice heaven."

"O: This is a winner, all I can say!!! does not dissapoint!"

"O: WOW again. This beer really surprised me. This kind of reminds me of Zombie Dust (sweeter ZD, I would say). Very well balanced as well. highly recommended."
""
""
"Make sure you drink a bit of this one each year; It very much fulfills the qualities of a harvest ale. High overall rating despite some low non-mouth-related numbers... because this one proves appearance doesn't always have much to do with it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This offering pours up a hazy gold with a thin white head and a small amount of lacing. The smell is a fairly strong floral aroma, very pleasant. Taste is a hint of sweet oranges upfront giving way to grapefruit and citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is quite nice with a decent amount of carbonation. Yet another excellent offering from Founders."
"Very refreshing, fresh hop taste, all in all the epitome of a harvest ale."
""
"A very nice autumnal IPA with grain, straw and pine. All around tasty."
"O - I would consider this the perfect ""light"" IPA. Super refreshing, easy to drink, fantastic flavor profile."
"This really takes off on the first sip, juicy piney and an incredible coating that leaves you wanting more. this is where the beer shines, a little underwhelmed when I smelled, but then I took a sip."
"O- This, Double Trouble and KBS are my top three brews that Founders offers...unfortunately all three are limited releases forcing me hunt and ration for these exceptional brews. Wow...only if one of these were year-round offerings. Founders never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another great beer out of Michigan. This is a great IPA, awesome hop burst for any hop head to enjoy."
""
"Bottled 10/04/2012, poured into a perfect pint glass. About a finger of white head disappears within a couple of minutes, leaves some lacing on the glass, not much. Color is a nice blend of light golden orange, some haze to it, but relatively clear; holds light well. Aroma at first introduces mild grapefruit and floral notes, but balances out with more a more mellow earthiness to it. I also get a bit of malt character. Taste is superb. It's like a much more hoppy All Day IPA, with added ABV. Mild hop flavors, sweetness, and well, no dry finish. Small amount of malt in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is very pleasant, even refreshing, with balanced carbonation and smoothness. Overall I really like this, but what Founders don't I enjoy. I guess this in the bottom half of Founders for me, but still great. I had it on tap at a tasting back in March or so and thought it was just OK. This is much better. I tend to enjoy Founders more in a bottle. I'll look for more of this, only grabbed two bottles last time. Cheers."
"Conclusion: I will buy again. This is an American IPA, no doubt about it. Good earthy IPA. I would thy this with some ginger bread cookies."
""
"Overall not a bad showing but not as epic as the usual founders beer. Nothing wrong with it and it is drinkable but also tastey and bold."
""
"O - A well-done IPA, although it's overly hopped for my taste. I prefer a more subtle hop flavor as in Two-Hearted, yet I recognize it's a nice rep for the style. Glad I tried it but a bit too hoppy for my desire."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer on tap and from the bottle. Love this beer. Has a great golden color with great lacing. Unreal smell with deep grapefruits, and in your face citrus. Taste also has really deep grapefruit, almost bitter. I just keep licking my lips after I take a sip. Overall, I just really enjoy this beer. I'm not the type of person to try and decipher every little flavor in a beer. I just know I enjoy this beer and can keep drinking it...plus it leaves a smile on my palate. Great beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery and fizzy, probably the downside of the beer. Leaves a sticky dry feeling afterwards. Drinkability excellent due to the clean taste and dry finish. Overall a fantastic beer in every way but mouthfeel."
"O: Overall, quite a delicious IPA. This is actually my first wet-hopped beer, and I'd have to say it tastes quite fresh. I would definitely call this one a go-to."
""
"O: The aroma of this beer is tremendous - tons of fresh hops. However, the flavor doesn't quite pack the same punch as I was expecting from the aroma. Also, the lack of carbonation is distracting."
"O: another Founders classic; a very easy-drinking beer. Look for it every year."
""
"O: Its a good beer and I'm glad I got to try it. A highlight among other wet hop ales I've tried this fall, this is right up there with WET."

"Overall, quite a variety of hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness is well represented. Very solid ipa!"

"O) Another solid seasonal from Founders. Glad to recommend this beer..."
"Overall: In a style where more and more good beers are emerging, this is still the king of the wet hop beers. Wonderful stuff."
"O- Decent IPA, not the best wet hopped ale I've had but then again not the worst. I would say that Harvest Ale doesn't quite live up to the hype."

"O- This is a great harvest ale, similar hop profile to their double trouble but fresher tasting and less intense."

"Beer pours a clear gold with a fluffy white head. Smell is fantastic! Tropical fruity hops and sweet malts come together to get my mouthwatering. This is what an IPA should smell like! The flavor is very nice, but a bit of a letdown after the awesome smell. The fruitiness doesn't come through as prominently as expected after the aroma, nor is it as sweet as I had anticipated. That said, it's still quite good, it's citrusy, grassy and a bit grainy with a light biscuity malt characteristic and a more-bitter-than-expected finish that lingers. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but it seems to be more in line with the 2010 version that I liked, but didn't love, than the 2011 version which absolutely blew me away. Last year's was a little sweeter and more fruity, which balanced out the grassy, grainy qualities of the beer a little better."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 10/4/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange zest, floral, herbal, light pine, grass, bread, and light lemon zest. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity and balance. Taste of huge pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, herbal, grass, pine, bread, and light lemon zest. Good amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pineapple, grass, floral, herbal, bread, pine, and light lemon on the finish for a good bit. Excellent complexity of hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance as well. Zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a sticky, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Overall this is an outstanding wet hopped IPA! Great hop flavor complexity and balance; extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. Highly enjoyable offering as expected."
"O – This is a delicious IPA. The hops just seem so juicy and resinous – I would imagine because they’re so fresh. I’ve been waiting for this one to come out since all the Oktoberfest beers started to show up. It was well worth the wait. Another smash from Founders."

"This is a great example of a fresh hop ale and one that I purchase every year. I finally decided to review. The nose is the best aspect of this beer. The fresh and bright aromas imparted by the hops are very attractive. I wish I could taste these same flavors as keenly as I'm able to smell them. However, this brew achieves excellent balance. I highly recommend Founders Harvest Ale."

"This was my first wet-hopped beer and I was pleasantly surprised. The difference between dry and wet hops is quite noticeable. Both similar, yet very different tastes. I enjoyed how fresh and pure this beer tasted - definitely a treat. I would like to get my hands on some more of this beer."
""
""
""
"O - A very fresh and vibrant wet hop IPA, but a little too malty for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium golden color with a decent white head that dissipates rather quickly. I can smell the citrus and pine as soon as I pop the top off of this one. Resinous, dank, grapefruit, and apricot aromas atop a sweet sugary base waft into my olfactory system. The flavor is a hint of bready and caramel malt up front before the palette is filled with hoppy goodness. Pine and resinous topped citrus and tropical fruit flavors tip the flavor balance well onto the hop side. Light to moderate hop bitterness. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. I felt this was a touch on the sweet side, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless."
"O-Yep this is a good one. I like that they've thrown some malt in here. Really helps the drinkability. Most fresh hop beers don't have the drinkability that this brew possesses."
""
""
"O- Great wet hop beer. Refreshing and delicious. Very enjoyable. However among the wet hop beers Surly Wet is still my favorite."
""
"O- Very good wet hop beer. Really enjoyed this beer and hope I can get another 4-pack."
""
""
"o: very nice offering and balanced so well. Challenging to track down but well worth it. Founders please increase the production of this quality brew."
""
""
""
""
"The is certainly worth seeking out."
""
"Mouthfeel: Light body, well carbonated and dissipating finish."
""
"O- one of the best wet hop ales I have had. A tropical domination makes harvest so much better than the other ones there. Bizarrely reminds me of a lagunitas sucks tropical theme in the beginning. So it's that good. Great job founders"
""
"O: A very good fresh hop beer. Good drinkability. Probably the best I've had other than this year's Wet with straight Simcoe."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours translucent golden with slight amber accents. The bright white one and a half finger head has excellent retention and abundant spider web-like lacing present along the side of glass. Adundant aroma of pineapple, citrus blossoms, and resin. Opens with citrus, sweet and juicy pineapple joined slightly sweet biscuity malt, finishes semi-dry with just the right amount of grapefruit rind bite. Medium-bodied, sticky, and oily mouthfeel with a perfect level of gentle carbonation. In my opinion, the most exceptionally well balanced wet hop IPA I've had the pleasure of enjoying. An annual must-have."
""
""
"O: Great beer, I can see why this sold out so quickly."
""
""
"O: Wow, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Tastes incredibly bright and fresh."
""
""
"A little too expensive for what it is, but what a great beer!! Founders always comes through!!"
"Yet another delicious beer from our friends at Founders."
""
"Overall: A fantastic wet hop ale. Not sure if I can choose between Wet, Broo Doo, and this. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"This style is often hit-or-miss but in this case, it's a hit!"
""
"Overall, a really stellar IPA. The fresh tropical hop notes really pop yet remain really drinkable. One of the better non local IPA's I've had in a very long time. Obviously the freshness helps a lot in that regard, but the flavor profile is really nice. A new favorite of mine. Vastly exceeded my expectations."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle, weak head with big bubbles disappearing in a moments notice. Bright, neon gold color. The beer in the taproom looked hazier, frothier, better. The nose is still the same from the bottle though, that is one dank aroma. The taste is all fresh hops. Citrus, mint, and some robust, roasted malt character. Medium-light body, but has a sticky feel. Overall, a beer with a sharp freshness and just the right amount of hop flavor without going overboard."
"O- The aroma and taste of this beer are fantastic. Not the most experience wet hop drinker here but overall this was great, defintiely knew it was fresh."
"O - Great IPA, I missed out on this one last year, so I was very glad to have the opportunity to grab a bit of it this year. Definitely recommend highly, a fairly attainable seasonal from Founders"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice juicy hop bomb full of citrus goodness. Not too bitter, so the hops show off their full flavor and not just their bittering ability. Very hard to find, so definitely pick it up if you can find it"

"i poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a hazy orange color body with a nice foamy head that lays nicely on top of the body. The smell is of nice earthy hops, very inviting to the nose. The taste is very nice blast of hop on the tongue and citrus. The mouth feel is very nice, leaves a nice after taste on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a damm good beer."
""
"Medium body, somewhat high carbonation, sticky, dry and lingering on the tongue. A fantastic harvest ale that holds up to Founders' standards."

"Overall, an excellent wet hopped beer. Great balance of malt and hops with a great blend of pine and citrus hop flavors. Not always easy to get but well worth it if you find some."

"Very nicely balanced and beautifully easy to drink. Fruity and round, with just enough mellow heat to warm your cheeks and make you think twice before having another. I think I'll have another."

"Great IIPA and wonderful fresh hops. As with most of the wet hop ales that come out in the fall this one ranks with the best"

"O-I would recommend a glass of water to accompany this one because of the bitter hops. Pretty good beer, I would buy again."

"O- Awesome beer. My first review of a founders beer and i can say i wish i lived in MI."

"Poured from a bottle into a brand spankin' new Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a hazy, translucent straw hue with a finger and a half crown of foam that dissipates after a minute or two, leaving some sparse lacing behind on the sides of the glass. The nose is a real winner. What a hop profile. Nearly absent of the citrus quality many IPA's have, this is real subtle and mellow, but hoppy nonetheless. The taste is neither piney nor a citrus bomb. Again, the hops are at the forefront, and while they're far from burgeoning, they're not meek either. It's just a perfect, mellow hop presence. The mouthfeel has a decent bitterness to it that trails off into a creamy finish. This is a real smooth beer, and one that I love, and anyone who wants a more sedate representation of the style would thoroughly enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color with a barely off white head. Decent retention and lacing. Smell is a bright, crisp citrus of pine, orange and resin almost spicy; super fresh. Taste is big on the pine and resin with a powerful initial bitterness, but is quite mild in the end. Overall if you are a big piney IPA fan the you might of found one of your favorites. Very good, but I prefer the tropical citrus ipas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA worth pounding for a whole evening."
""
" This harvest beer is wonderfully juicy with bitter flavor up front setting you up for a strong peppery orange rind combo and some tea-like herbal taste riding along. The flavor has a subtle tinge of mango and pine pokes through in places with a mild toastiness from the malt that only emerges momentarily til a light apricot mellow earhty flavor and fruit accent comes in. There is a slight touch of lemon oil with citrus juiciness, but the vegetal element of the hops is minor as it finishes. Overall -the best Harvest or wet hop whatever the style. the hop taste is so refreshing and only a mild amount of vegetal is introduced with very vibrant hops and enough balance to satisfy fans of the style without going toward 'hop assault'. This has that resiny hop tangy flavor after the swallow telling you it is a seriously hop forward beer."

"[94/100]"

"Overall this is a real solid Harvest ale/IPA here, and a great beer to have during the fall season. Not my favorite ""fresh hop"" beer but a real solid winner and worth revisiting fresh every year."

"Overall Impression- What is this wet-hopped attribute in these IPA's coming out? Something I enjoy! The best part of this wet hopped flavor is how clean and smooth it is. This harvest ale was fantastic and glad I was able to get one of the limited 4-packs from Lukas Liquor. Get some next year if you can, but always fresh!"
""
"Once again, Founder's Brewing comes through with flying colors!"
""
""
"This was an amazing extra! I want to get some of this right off the bottling line. This was a great harvest ale and an all around solid offering from founders. This brewery has yet to disappoint."

"A top notch offering from Founders. I know it is seasonal, but this beer deserves more love than it gets , it is excellent. Glad I was able to get my hands on more of it and will look forward to it next year."

""
""

"Again tremendous, in a way that for all its regularity from Founders, is never pedestrian."
""

"This is not my favorite IPA (Fat Head's Headhunter currently has that honor), but it is my favorite wet hop ale. It is really fresh, fruity, and intense without being overly bitter. Too bad it's so difficult to get."

"Overall: I thought everything about this was good, but no aspect truly overwhelmed me. It has been a few weeks since the release, so maybe it is a touch better fresh. Still very good, but the flavor was more of a flat bitterness than a strongly flavorful hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent example of a wet-hopped IPA"
""
"Oh man, this is a purty beer; kinda thang ah can cozy up to an swallah. Served with an average sized off white, foamy head that slowly settled and a lot of lace. Color is a clear amber with some large bubble trails. Aroma is super fresh and good. Flavor is like nose with big hops on top, then carbonic tang, little sweetness along with some malt earthiness. Body and carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, lasts a while, and has a suggestion of alcohol. Killer brew. Could drink a lot of this."
""
""
"O - The mild bitterness and sweet fruitiness make this beer pleasant to drink. The lighter body and lowish abv also make it a solid beer that I would enjoy drinking on any occasion."
""
"Overall - Really nice on all fronts, if not stand-out on any. I agree that it's one of the best fresh hop IPAs out there."

"O-I think it is one of the best wet hopped ales i have had, def up there. have three left want to share with friends but just don't know if i could part with any of them."

"Overall - Great beer. As I get close to the finish there is perfect lacing on the side of the glass for inches while a thin layer of white covers the remaining golden elixir. Very easy to drink and refreshing, but probably not one to take lightly."

"Very well done. I had this in the same week I had Surly Wet, and I have to say, I liked this one better. Great flavors and freshness, with great balance."

"I wish I'd picked up more than the couple of bottles I did, now. So clean, so easy to shotgun, this is a heady salute & the best wet-hop beer I've had to date. An elite IPA. Boody hell."

"O: This is a great fresh-hopped ale, it has a very crisp and refreshing taste and a nice, subtly hoppy style."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I had this beer one other time, but it wasn't nearly this fresh. It was good, but this is excellent. I enjoy Sierra Nevada & Weyerbacher's offerings, but the fruity/citrus character of this one takes it to another level."
"O: Nothing to fault here. Top shelf beer. One of the best harvest beers on the market and always a joy to drink."
"Overall, a very solid offering. Trying to compare it to Surly Wet due to a recent thread, but both beers stand apart on their own merit. will enjoy this beer several times in the next couple of days."
"This is a great wet-hopped ale, easily one of the better ones out there. Outstanding IPA from Founders."
"This is an exceptional beer. The sweetness at the close is poetic. The bitterness subtle yet extremely dry. I can't say enough about this IPA. Buy it at all costs and soon!"
"O: Overall I am really enjoying this. Just wish I got to try it super fresh. All in all a damn fine offering from Founders. 4.5"
"o - a damn good beer and very drinkable. i don't expect anything less from founders. worth seeking out."
"O: Founders Harvest Ale is another kick-ass IPA from Founders. There's not much more I can say. Seek it out and drink it. Bountifully."
"I recommend picking this up where you can find it. It probably won't be on the shelf for long, and even if it is; these wet-hopped beers go south too quickly."
"Light body beer with some light carbonation. Decently refreshing and easy to drink beer though."
"A pleasant change-up from the typical IPA that rewards with its complexity, yet doesn't chase away the casual drinker."
"O - Glad I got a chance to experience this wet hop ale. Heard many good things about it. I think if I tried this a bit fresher it would be off the charts. Wish this was available locally!"
"Pours a golden yellow color with a small head - not very much lacing going on here. In the aroma, I detect pineapple, flower petal, pine needles, and a bit of grassy, savory undertone. The latter note mentioned is slightly off putting. The taste is fantastic with fresh hops dominating - it starts off bright and ends with a bitter finish. Pleasant medium mouthfeel. Less dry than most IPAs. It's a hit!"
"O - Really enjoyable IPA. Founder's has always impressed me for their barrel aged beers. Now, they've showed me what they can do with hops. No wonder they're my favorite brewery!"
"O: This is so drinkable, the dryness of the backend keeps you taking sips until it disappears. A wonderful Wet Hop Ale."
"O: Very good IPA and probably the best wet hopped ale I've had. The hops provide a lot of aromas and flavors, but avoid being overly bitter."
"An excellent fresh hop ale. The nose is excellent and the taste is almost as good. They do a really great job of showcasing the extremely fresh hop flavors and aromas."
"Good IPA. Love how much the hops add to the beer without overpowering it too much. Although malt isn't showcased here it balances out the hops quite well. Quite delicious."
"O- A very nicely done IPA. On the sweet side of the hop profile, yet not cloying or sweet in the feel. Smooth, mild, calm and tasty sum this beer up. Another solid offering from Founders. Very easy to drink, too easy."
"Pours a very deep gold for an IPA, and reminds me of Belgian strong pale ales I've had in the past in color. Nose is crazy citrus, with a nice yeasty malty background. Flavor follows suit, with some sweet citrus and toffee and malt flavor. I could literally drink this beer all day if it came to Maryland. Great example of a wet hop IPA."
"O - Hop wise, this is one of the best harvest ales I have tried. Others have seemed more balanced. This is something that most hopheads would enjoy."
"O - This beer is so Awesome. The hops are so fresh tasting. The malt flavor is very mild & clean tasting so the hops are really the star here."
"This is probably the best wet-hopped beer I've had. Has the juiciness of wet hops without sacrificing a strong, griping hop flavor. This bottle was noticeably lacking in taste and aroma compared to one from the same batch I had a week ago, so drink it fresh!"
"Cheers!"
"D - Very tasty. I wish I had more."
"I poured this beer and from then on all I could smell was hops. It was a glorious experience. Very bitter and strong hop flavor that dominated the whole beer, but still kept the subtle nuances that you'd hope for. One of the best beers I've had in a long time."
"O.A great beer. Definitely something worth looking for. Like the seasonal aspect of beers like this. Something to look forward each Fall."
"Conclusion: Clean, seriously hoppy, tasty IPA from Founders. Is it worth 10-plus for a 4pk? Meh."
"it a good beer."
"*finish- sweetness increases to moderate, all others same as initial. Long finish length, watery mouthfeel, hits the back of the tongue."
"It's a fine beer and one I'm happy to have three more of. I'll probably drink them all tonight and sleep through my alarm in the morning."
"Overall: You can't go wrong with this brew. Yeah, it is a bit one-dimensional, but just so damn well done! So outrageously fresh and enjoyable. Immensely drinkable too! I could chug this all day. Plus, it is something everyone loves... even the lager-drinking European."
"Pretty impressed by this beer. I was apprehensive as it smells like Devil Dancer-lite, and if it tasted as such, I was going to like only marginally more than the disfavored Devil Dancer. I was pleasantly wrong. Citrus up front cuts into a decisive piney bitterness that quickly dissipates into a very pleasant crispness. It's something I could drink a whole lot of really quickly."
"Overall, another American IPA that has hit all the right notes for me, this could be my style."
"O - Easily one of the best hop characters I've experienced in a beer!"
"Probably one of my favorite wet hopped ales. Not surprising as Founders does little wrong."
"Poured into a pint glass from 12oz bottle. Pours a light amber-orange body with slight haze and small white head. Aroma bursts with notes of fresh fruit - orange, grapefruit, and some citrus - and has some bready notes as well. Mouthfeel is way lighter and smoother than expected. The hop is very restrained with notes of citrus and grapefruit hop lingering in the background. Very slight malt in the finish as well. Although, this beer is extremely smooth and masks the 6.5% abv very well. What a great Harvest Ale!"
"Drink- This is a good tasty little beer. Very smooth, balanced and crisp. The low IBUs matched with the citrus do a wonderful job together. Would love to have more of these."
"O- Fantastic IPA. One of the best that I've had as far as the smell is concerned."
"O – Like I said above, wish hop harvest was earlier in the year, this would be a fantastic spring beer, its so crisp and refreshing."
"A very hoppy smelling and tasting beer, it looks very good and smells very good as well, a hop lovers delight."
"O - What a great IPA, I wish it was around more often. I'd imagine this would be excellent on cask as well. C'mon Founders, send a Cask to this year's Nerax fest!"
"The appearance of this offering from Founders is a golden tone with a bright white head. It has a nose of lemon, pine and some subdued hops. While the taste has some spices such as sage and cloves. The citrus hops are also present, with more lemon and some grapefruit. MF is medium with a lower carbonation level. All in all, a pretty good beer, but not one of my favorites from these guys out of Michigan."
"D-I like my IPA's with a bit more body to them. This one definitely showcases the hops but I feel that it loses the complexity as the malt is barely there."
"Recommend try."
"O: Great drinking, well-balanced IPA. No one aspect is super powerful, it's just a great combination."
"Taste is just as good as the smell. Very crisp and citrusy. One of my favorite wet hop ales."
"O: A great beer, but not one that I could drink everyday. Wish it was slightly more like the aroma and not so bitter."
"Overall: upping all my scores based on last years (only landed a single 4 pack so guessing I got one that maybe got excess exposure to ga. Heat?)."
"Mouthfeel is medium body with a crisp semi-dry finish. Overall, a delicious freshly hopped ale. Founders does it again."
"-this is quite a sessionable IPA. there isn't a strong bitter finish and the flavor or body isn't too overpowering, making it a very drinkable and refreshing IPA"
"O: Overall this was very good. Great fall hop harvest seasonal. The hops were the star of the show as they should be."
"The beer is orange and mostly clear, with a small white head that leaves sparse lacing in it's wake. The aroma is of dank hops, with fresh citrus, herbal, and floral notes. Wonderful, though lacking strength. The taste...wow. Fabulous. So fresh. Glass almost gone already. Oops, got a little too excited there. Fresh hops, not much malt...superb. Founders Harvest Ale showcases hops brilliantly with this autumn release. A must try."
"Overall, this is a very nice example of a wet hopped ale and it's well worth picking up. It's also nice finding a seasonal ale that can make the most out of the hops while they're around and fresh from harvest."
"Genuine hop juice here. An outstanding effort to capture the essence of hops, while having enough malt backbone to stand on its own. Bravo."
"overall: i was a little underwhelmed on this one. a seasonal by founders carrys some clout with it, but this wasnt quite as good as others by founders. it drinks very easily and it has enough hop to it to make it an overall good beer. just dont get as excited for this one as backwoods bastard, KBS, etc. dont get me wrong tho, its worth a pick up if you love founders beer"
"This beer is really good, and founders should be proud. Though I am one who thinks many BA's fret too much over the age of their IPA, this is one that probably will fade noticeably, being a fresh hop ale that is still quite fresh. The hop flavor and aroma are both very bright. If single IPA's typically had this kind of hop flavor, with its relatively moderate bitterness, maybe I would be less into DIPA? If you like hops and can get this fresh (or even fresh-ish), you should."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this ale. It has layers of flavors that are pretty common with Founders and yet again did not disappoint me. A favorite as far as a seasonal brew for me."
"O: Overall I would pick up more of this if it were available in my area without hesitation. There is allot of complexity to the taste. Heck, I just enjoyed the burp after finishing this review."
"O - Refreshing, nice sharp lemon, but not overly harsh."
"I love this beer. The grapefruit is awesome and this is probably one of the best examples of wet hopping I have ever had. Drink fresh you wont be disappointed."
"This was the first wet hopped beer I ever tried and is still my favorite. They really do a good job of squeezing every bit of hoppy deliciousness out of the wet hops."
"O - Another solid performer from Founders. Picked up a 4-pack of this and will definitely look for another when I'm back in the US next. Too bad you can't store it, I'd love to hoard a bunch of this for summer."
"This is an outstanding example of a wet hopped ale. It's piney, resiny and really fresh. There is just enough malt to balance out the hops, but don't be fooled, the hops are the main attraction. Some citrusy tones would have really put this beer over the top. As it stands it is well worth seeking out."
"O: A great beer. A touch much on the grapefruit. Could've mellowed it a bit with pineapple or a touch more caramel malts, but that's hardly a downfall."
"I love wet hopped beers and this is great. More flavor than and IPA but less bitterness. Yum."
"O: Scary sessionable. I could drink this quickly and would, sadly, be done too soon only left to stumble my sweet ass to bed early. As usual, Founders rarely fails to impress. Solid beer."
"I picked up this beer on a strong recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Easy to drink through this four pack and will look for it again. The apricot flavors I picked up were certainly from the wet hops, but were not overly fruity - just real solid flavor."
"Overall – I’m really digging this beer. A unique IPA flavor profile for sure. I am glad I was able to pick up a four pack of this."
"O - This is a must try if you love fresh-hopped beers. This is as fresh as it gets. Well done as usual by Founders!"
"D: could run through quite a few of these. an excellent craft."
"As I poured it all I could smell was fruity hops, It smelled so delicious. Poured a bright golden brown that was slightly cloudy with a nice radiant white head that lingered longer than expected. The taste of this beer is extremely delicious. Great mouth feel that lets you enjoy the fruity hops that you get in the aroma. The flavors are a little more subdued than i had anticipated but not in an overly bad way. I think this beer had been talked up a little too much and I was overly anticipating the flavor. Still a very good beer and I will enjoy the whole 4 pack without a second thought."
"O - Overall, this is a very solid beer from Founders. Haven't had a beer from them I didn't like."
"DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!"
"Purchased from the Lager Mill in Frankenmuth, Michigan, at the encouragement of a sign stating ""limit 2 per customer"". Pours with a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving behind a good lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops without the familiar, dominating aroma of cascade (grapefruit). This is promising. The first sip, followed quickly by a gulp, is perfectly balanced. Seriously. The hop is there- there's no denying that this is an American IPA- but the malt backbone is just there like a great rhythm section behind the star singer. Very good."
"Picked this up along with devil dancer when I got my CBS. Pours with relatively small head into a stella glass. The smell dances on the nose, full of floral and hops. Smooth drinkability with hops hitting towards the end. Overall a great beer, worth picking up for any beer lover."
"O: Definitely a solid beer, but at the price point I think I can do a bit better. I would certainly drink this again, but wouldn't necessarily go far out of my way to get any. Worth a shot!"
"Overall this is exceptional and interesting like all of Founders' beers. A lot to take in here and a very enjoyable drink."
"O- Very good wet hopped beer. Maybe not the best I've had, but a very good beer. Can't wait to get into the rest of the 4 pack. Easily would drink this again!"
"O: Best wet-hopped IPA I’ve ever had. The nose blew me away, just like with many harvest ales I’ve tasted, but the palate was able to back it up this time. To be honest, this beer reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: clean, hoppy refreshment. This is something I could enjoy for bottles at a time."
"3.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 3.5"
"This is a delicious IPA. Not overly bearing on the hops as they are more fresh."
"Straw gold ale with a clean white head that lingers on top with no lace on top of light but not watery body that a bit bread and biscuit. Hop forward on top of the light body--singular hop spice and light citrus in nose. However, the light body lets the grassy and bitter taste shine. Hop is clearly on display--the lighter but not light mouthfeel is a frame for the picture perfect hops."
"O: A very good wet hopped beer, balanced and fresh."
"Pours super pale, collecting in a pale copper/orange with a small oily head that recedes to an ever-retained film. My obligatory wet-hopped comment: tobacco, I get it in every one, it's a nice association, got sharp bite. Big grapefruit here, cleaner than a lot with a slight BO flavor. Dry malt character with sharp prickly carbonation makes this a quite enjoyable wet-hopped IPA. Enjoy thoroughly."
"O: Great combination of flavors overall. Definitely enjoyed this beer and was very drinkable."
"This beer poured with a nice white head that was about the size of my finger. The color of this beer is a bright yellow, but with a slight haze to it. This one has a nice fresh piney smell along with a sweet pinneapple scent. Upon drinking right away there is a massive hop flavor along with a bit of lemon and grapefruit. This is a nice thin beer in the mouth and it leaves a pleasant taste between drinks. Overall this is a very good beer"
"Very nice balance and flavors."
"Overall a great fresh hop ale either on tap or out of the bottle. More lemon and pine than orange it seems it out of the bottle."
"The embodiment of fresh hops. Pours a straw yellow/golden color. Firm white head that dissipates quickly. Decent lacing. Smells unbelievable. Grass, herbs, lemon, and of course grapefruit. Taste is just as pleasing and follows suit with more grass & herbal notes, and yes, more grapefruit. Very drinkable and quenching. I loved this beer."
"O- This is a solid IPA from Founders, nothing mind blowing but solid, glad to have it once but see no reason to buy another four pack."
"O: For wet-hop IPA advocates, an ale to look forward to and seek out. Think fresh, green and delicious."
"O - Very nice wet hopped beer, so fresh and clean clean."
"O- A great wet hop beer from Founders, at 6% it is easily sessionable, but the hops will destroy your palate quickly!"
"Well done Founders! I just wish I didn't have to drive to six different stores just to end up with a 12 pack :("
"O- one awesome IPA. You did it again Founders. Now quit making all these 4 packs and give us this stuff (and FBS) in 6 packs!"
"M: nicely carbonated, medium body, and crisp"
"O: very satisfying and highly recommended, clean hop taste dominates soft malts, excellent ipa"
"A good not great fresh hop beer."
"O - A very good wet hopped IPA. Hop component is substantial but not overwhelming. I look forward to a 4 pack of this each year."
"O: Not blown away or anything, but a very solid, very drinkable IPA."
"This bottle pours a nice and golden pale color. It has an amazing pungent aroma right up front, grassy and full of pine and resin. It really almost seems to remind me of a wild yeasty and wheaty kinda of IPA. I will say that this is an amazing brew; i think founders did an amazing an here. I get the resinous of the hops and the overall freshness of the brew. The mouthfeel is great, a little heavy up front but goes down smooth making this an amazingly sessional beer. One thing i will say.. if this brew was made with another 3-4% alcohol content and made to an DIPA i would have so much more respect for this mammoth of a flavorful brew. I mean it has the feel and taste of a DIPA but i just feel like it would pack a bit more punch if an alcohol finish made the last impression."
"O: Not bad at all. Much more hop flavor than most wet hop beers. Blows away the seasonal Sierra Nevada offerings."
"Notes: Harvest ales can go anywhere… style, quality… in the (I)PA/wet-hopped range this is outstanding. Not too pricey, all things considered, and on this occasion this is something that flies off the shelves for a good reason."
"Overall this is one of the top tier wet hop beers. Incredibly pungent resinous hop flavor that packs a punch. Founders wipped an exeptional brew yet again!"
"overall decent beer"
"Overall, an excellent single IPA."
"Pours a hazy orange with a small white head. Leaves a great lace along the sides of the glass. This one smells amazing. Smells like beautiful, citrusy hops. Nothing else. Just hops, just the way I like it. Taste is has a strong bitterness from the hops, with a light malty backbone. Also tropical notes come out as the beer warms up a bit. This has an extremely crisp finish and is a very, very easy drinker. Overall a great offering from Founders. At 6.5% ABV this one is a very sessionable beer. I wouldn't have a problem drinking two 4 packs in a setting."
"Get it if you can."
"O: Overall a solid Ipa, all the flavors work well with each other with none overwhelming the other, I paid $3.99 for a single bottle which is a little to pricey for me , still it's worth a try."
"o: one of the best beers founders makes."
"a light colored brew, slightly yellow. Paler than I expected. moderate white head. Little lacing. smell is all hops, but a very dank aroma. Musty and earthy. Very nice. Taste is super bitter up front, but it is like something popped in my mouth and is all just juices. leaves my mouth soaked with bitter hop juice and grassy floral notes. moderate fizz, a bit lighter in body than I anticipated. Huge flavor and super bitter. Doesn't leave you dry. I could see this being a great beer to have quite a few of."
"Excellent brew. Very lively and hoppy. Unlike any other fall seasonal I have tried."
"I've had this beer before but, wow freshness certainly matters on this beer. Bottle says 9-22-11."
"o - Overall another awsome beer from Founders; I'm really surprised I've never gotten around to having this one. Tons of hops and has that great fresh wet hop smell, and very easy to drink; could definitely have had a few of them. Would love to have again."
"Overall: A very good IPA that is very forward on citrus hops but light on the overall bitterness."
"O- As of lately, I've been drinking anything Founders that I could find. As of yet, this is the best non stout Founders has to offer to me. All the characteristics of a hop bomb but not tiresome with quantity. I've always said that Alpine Nelson and Kern River Just Outstanding are the 2 best examples of single IPAs that I've ever had, but I'm throwing this on that list alongside the other two. It's fresh, tasty, and making me wish I bought more than 2 bottles. Amazing beer."
"D/O: Founder's Harvest Ale is a well-executed demonstration of fresh hop qualities positioned against a tight malty canvas. This would be a successful pale ale with almost any hop bill, such is the quality of the bready grain. Still, it is full of wonderful hop qualities that are both delicate and elevating. Apology accepted, Founder's, for Devil Dancer."
"(O) As a fresh, wet-hopped IPA, this one is one of the best. I do really like it and for my own sake and opinion I put this one up against my love for Surly Wet. I think I still prefer the Wet (will do a bit more of a comparison when the Wet comes out) but this is a solid beer and one that I really dig."
"Bottled just over a week ago. Who doesn't love seriously fresh IPAs? This one pours a mostly clear golden auburn topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises pine, sharp grapefruit, sharp cantaloupe, buttery caramel, and peach. The taste seems to focus heavily on the pine aspects, sharpening them even further than in the smell. The fruit isn't nearly as distinct, and the caramel has gone from buttery to spicy. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, but the pine character comes off a bit much for me, especially considering the fruity tones imparted by the smell. Still pretty tasty, though..."
"I did one of my crazy person shops today at my local craft beer warehouse. Grabbed a bunch of new exciting bottles and also tossed in a 12 oz of Founders Harvest, never having tried it before but hearing good things. I've also been knocking back a lot of imperial stouts and big IPAs lately, so the idea of a wet hopped ale sounded like the perfect respite for a fatigued palate. MAN, this did NOT disappoint. Founders just knocks it out of the park every time. Really beautiful hazy amber gold color pouring deliciously into a glass with a great crisp head and carbonation popping everywhere. Big, wet, juicy hop smell; piney, citrusy, grapefruity. But the kicker, totally balanced on the palate. That hop taste isn't overwhelming, the body incredibly light and crisp with a fair amount of bitterness and just enough malt to round it out. This feels like the prodigy child offspring of Centennial IPA which had a rounder more dense flavor and Dry-Hopped Pale Ale which has an aggressive hop scent. We got an easy drinker here, just under 7% ABV makes this one I can knock back a few of but still feel impressed with every sip. A super exciting version of Sierra Nevada, just absolutely jumping with flavor but still sessionable."
"Overall a very crisp beer with a well rounded fruity flavor from the fresh hops. This is one of my favorites for a reason!"
"This beer poured out as a copperish color with a big white foamy head on top. The smell of the beer was hoppy, as it should be. The wet hop aroma fills the nose with some floral and citrus notes. The taste of the beer has a great hoppy flavor but it fades into more of an earthy finish which kind of hinders my thoughts just a bit. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than the Double Trouble which I like and overall I think that this beer is very good."
"Quite drinkable. It was nice to experience an autumn beer with some good hops."
"I like this beer better than their Centennial IPA and has a more distinct hop taste than their Double Trouble IPA. Definitely not as bitter but this one definitely packs some hop bitterness on the tongue which is why they ended up calling an IPA intead of an APA. I know it can't be year round because its a Harvest Ale but they should definitely put this in 6 packs especially it being a pretty sessionable beer at 6.5 %."
"Wet-hopped for my enjoyment! A finger of soapy, bone-white head upon arrival with decent retention. Color was a hazy lemon-yellow. Nose was grapefruit-citrusy with an earthy undertone. Man, I really did what wet hopping will do for a beer! Mouthfeel was silky but with a pleasant hops bite, like a 1-2 combo to the palate. The bitterness was somehow muted, less sharp than many of its counterparts. The mellowing effects were immediate. I had thought that I had (finally) conquered my hop jones, but this was like mainlining. The finish was hoppy, sure, but with an earthy aspect that simply lingered."
"Tastes are wet hops, caramel, papaya, malt backbone, popcorn, salt, peppercorn, citrus, citrus peels, blended unripe fruit, rock sugar, earth, cane sugar, dryness, tea, edginess, flower pedals, coconut, and bananas and curds and cumin and spices and light fruit skins."
"O: I've had this fresh, and it's certainly better straight from the brewery, though it's still really tasty now. I look forward to this one each year, and recommend you do too."
"I'd like a bit more of an oily feel here, with the fresh hops and all. I think seirra's fresh hop beers do this exremely well. Clearly hopslam was made for this, but this beer finishes dry enough and yet has just enough body."
"Another great beer from Founders."
"Drink and Overall: Overall, I really like this beer. When in search of some flavor, without alot of weight, this would be a good choice. One of the better IPA's for every day drinking I have had in a while. Would put it up there with Bells Two Hearted and Founders Centennial."
"The taste is mostly hops. Besides the hops, there is a taste like grapfruit or some other citrus fruit. The bitterness is quite balanced with the sweetness. This feels light and lively in the mouth, with a fair amount of carbonation. I really like this beer and I'm looking forward to next years batch."
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice hop profile and some nice other flavors to blend with the hop. Lots of flavors but still super smooth and refreshing."
"D - Quaffable. I like most aspects better from the bottle than the cask. I think the extra carbonation enhances the taste and moutfeel."
"Pours hazy golden with a huge white fluffy head. The aroma is clean, sharp and hoppy, with a delicate citrusy character, some orange and lemon rind. The flavor has a delicate, perfumy orange, with a clean, crisp malt backbone, almost pilsner like, with a tinge of metal and sulfur. The bitterness is mild but steely. The mouthfeel is prickly and there is an ice creamy smoothness to the finish."
"Poured a nice yellow orange with a rocky white head that disapted quicly and left a small ring of bubbles that was fed by the carbonation. Smell is of citrus hops orange and lemon with a hint of pine. Taste is bitter up front with the hops orange and pine biting away and then it mellows out to a nice malty backbone but finishes hoppy and dry. Mouthfeel is soft and lively very well balanced and brings the hop frangrance forward. Drinkability was nice a good fall beer with plenty of hops but well balanced."
"Quite drinkable. It was nice to experience an autumn beer with some good hops."
"D: This is a nice IPA, fairly balanced yet the hops are quite present."
"Okay. I've got a cold; I have another IPA on the palate; I'm getting pretty sleepy. All of these certainly aren't working in Harvest Ale's favor. But it's a Founders product. KBS provided me first wet beer dream before I even knew my tastebuds could feel that way. So I give it minor sympathy points. Plus, it's a solid IPA. But there are MANY east coast IPAs that would take this beer into a dark alley and commit unspeakable acts upon it. That's all I'll say."
"Not the hop-marvel I expected from a brewery as accomplished as Founders, but I'll look forward to trying this variety again in 2011."
"D: Great brew and drinkable for the ABV. Great use of hops."
"This would probably be my first choice in a highly drinkable harvest ale. However the availability is very limited and it's a little pricey. Can't really give this over a 4. Such a sessionable beer though that is awesome on tap. Was the first beer I ever tried at Founders this fall."
"EDIT: Have had fresher bottles, this is amazing stuff, easily the most underrated beer in the Founder's portfolio."
"Fresh 4-pack. The flavors are intensified and even more delicious. Clementine and a lawnmower bag's worth of fresh cut grass. Green onions too. Up there with Double Trouble; hell it may surpass Double Trouble. Only knock on this beer is its hefty price tag. Hesitate to say ""I wish this was year round"". However, I think it's superb as just a once a year brew. A liquid gift in Autumn."
"Comments: Drink it fresh! Not a bad beer at all, and I'm not surprised as Founders and quality go hand in hand. Would love to try this extremely fresh and on tap!!!"
"I wish I had more so I could fully examine it's drinkability."
"D - I had no problem drinking the one I ordered, but I wouldn't order another one. I'm glad I tried it, as I enjoy most Founders brews, but if I want a good fresh-hopped beer, I'll look for a Celebration."
"Overall- Another great release from Founders. I'm a big fan of the wet hopped ales and look forward to this release every fall."
"Served from cask into a flared pilsner. Poured a golden yellow with a minimal pure white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and citrus/bitter hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus (not a hoppy kind), and bitter hops. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite excellent. Very well-balanced in flavor and aroma. Very nice hop profile going on here. Found myself drinking this one QUITE quickly due to the flavor and easy of drinking it. A definite must try rather it be on-tap or on cask for sure!"
"My first Founder's. Drinks great. I'm a big fan of the APA style and this one would be a regular for me if I could get it every day. I want more!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a decent frothy khaki head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of crisp citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The taste is nice smooth crisp citrus hops just in front of sweet caramel malts. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing with decent carbonation. This is a great wet hop beer, one I'd certainly have again."
"Overall, A well done wet hopped APA though not my favorite. Maybe some of the more delicate hop freshness was lost to the age of this one. I would definitely buy this again if it were within a month or two of bottling."
"Overall this is a great beer. Very nice!"
"The first was certainly enjoyable, but I wouldn't be following it up with another right away. It isn't quite balanced enough for me to think of it as an especially drinkable beer."
"D - I think this is a good APA. At first I thought this may have been an IPA. It goes down very easy and is refreshing. I would try this on again for sure."
"A very nice Harvest Ale. I know it can't be fresh, unless Founders made another batch, but this was the first time I saw it on shelves in my area so I picked up a 4-pack. Would love to try it fresh next year to see what flavors may have faded."
"Due to the late date of consumption, most of the profiles of this beer have left. With that said, this beer still tastes really solid, something that would be nice on a hot summer day."
"Orange/straw body with a thin white head that slowly fades away into a faint ring. Earthy, grapefruit/piney hops dominate the aroma. Some caramel/citrusy sweetness. Caramel malts and spicy hop flavor both well balanced. Slightly oily, astringent, and bitter. Excellent representation of the style - big bold flavors, yet still very drinkable."
"If you like hops, this is perfect for you."
"Not a bad beer by any means. Hop heads will really love this. Not for me though. Just to much bitterness and nothing else for balance. There are plenty other great Founders products that I will return to before this."
"Beer is medium in bodied and moderately bitter in the back. Its sweet and has great pine and citrus hop character in the midpalate, its a very nice beer. The finish isn't dry its well balanced and turns out to be a great APA. I really like this beer."
"A touch on the lighter side. A nice fall APA with good IPA flavor just not quite as big. Founder's has crafted a keeper in my book."
"D - As I always state for good brews I will have to seek out fresher but can't imagine the flavors would be much better. Even old it was a nice brew but not worth 4.25 for the single. 4 pack for 10 bucks sounds about right. Good beer."
"Thought this was good, but well behind Sierra Nevada for my favorite Fresh Hop/Harvest Ale. Founders uses just a little softer, fruitier hop combination that is very nice, but loses a little steam for me towards the end of the glass."
"Overall: Easily one of the best fresh-hopped beers I've tried. We are not going for IPA standards of hoppiness, which helps accentuate the more subtle and delicate flavors fresh hop brews can deliver. Many fresh hop IPAs feel like a mouth full of grass or meadow. This one, because it goes for a more subtle tone of a pale ale, creates a fantastic brew."
"Teh mouthfeel is fizzy and light almost like a lager, and the intense nose does not carry through to an intensity on the palate that one might expect. Instead the flavor up front is tobacco and green hops, a touch sweet with a bitter midpalate rather than a long bitter finish. The light touch on the palate, however, makes this brew very drinkable and refreshing. Very well done."
"A very good autumn IPA, a nice plethora of fresh hop flavor with a good malt backbone to it. The price is a real bummer though."
"This is a great harvest beer and I'm glad I was able to pick up a bottle while it was still fresh. I love this time of year, especially for the wet hop beers. Nice bright flavor and smooth finish. I'll be sure to pick up more next year."
"D: Really good. I wish I had another bottle."
"Founders is one of my favorite brewers already and I still haven't had some of their highest rated brews like Breakfast Stout. Kudos to the Michiganders!"
"SkÅL!"
"Not my favorite of the highly-hopped APA's of late - don't get me wrong, it's good. Just not what I prefer in an APA."
"Great beer. Thanks to Pipers Pub for serving it and tweeting it."
"Cheers.."
"Purchased this at Oak Tree Buy Rite in S. Plainfield, NJ. Into a pint glass, it poured a cloudy golden hue with one finger of white; good retention and lacing, and very little visible carbonation. Smelled of bitter herbs, grassy menthol, grapefruit peel, and slightly apple. The taste was initially bitter herbs, followed by apple maltiness and grapefruit, and then finishing off on a dry bitter peel note which lingered. As it warmed to room temperature, I detected more grapefruit in the finish as well. Smooth, creamy medium body. Excellent session pale ale, that is as well balanced as it is flavorful."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very smooth and drinkable beer overall. The fresh hops really come out and have a nice bright flavor to them. Very nice beer overall and a very good fresh hop ale."
"O: Nice beer. Pretty standard fare for Founders."
"DB- A very hoppy APA (whooda thunk it). To me it is comparable to the Centennial IPA but brings a better hop flavor to the table. Solid, drinks smoothly and easily."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. I am left wondering how great this beer would be if the bitterness were turned down a bit, because as of now, the bitterness really detracts from the beer's drinkability. Alcohol is hidden well, and the flavors are spot on."
"Don't get me wrong, not a bad beer, but too one-note. Also, too flat."
"I got a chance to try this side by side last week with the tap & firkin. This is the perfect beer to drink from a firkin, it was absolutely amazing. If you get a chance to try it from firkin, don't miss out. The tap wasn't nearly as good as the firkin or bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is really delicious. I would describe the fresh hopped ale as hops in HD. It seems like there was more depth and complexity than you typically get in a ""traditionally hopped"" beer. I will definitely seek this out again!"
"Easy on the palate, not too high in alcohol, no offensive lingering flavors. A rather drinkable beer."
"One of the better wet hop beers every year. Very easy to take and quite delicious."
"D= Really like this one it is one of my favorites by Founders. Goes down really nice looks like I have to make another trip to Mich."
"Overall: Just too much hops for me to enjoy more than one of these in a night. The hops do fade as the drink warms. That being said, I did enjoy the one I drank."
"Quality all the way"
"Easy drinking, with tons of flavor. I'm going back for more of this while it's available."
"I look forward to having this one next year. Definitely worth a six pack!"
"Great example for someone to try a fresh hopped ale, balanced and drinkable. Complex yet easy to quaff back."
"D - Pretty drinkable, enjoyable brew. Reminds me more of a IPA than an APA. Worth drinking for sure but I wouldn't go nuts trying to get it."
"drinks great, i wish this was readily available to me, because i drank my one and only bottle way too fast. im very glad i got to try this."
"D-This is a high quality offering from Founders with good balance and great drinkability."
"fairly clear orange color with a pure white foamy head. citrus (maybe grapefruit?) in the nose. taste is smooth with very little bitterness and a mild hop flavor. malt bill is minimal, but the beer is still very balanced. light mouthfeel. very high drinkability. This is a just a well-made balanced beer. nothing extreme about it and a nice change of pace once in a while when you want to go back to beer's ""roots."""
"Pours a hazy yellow color with orange notes and a white head. In the aroma, a small fresh hop and a mellow malt backing. In the taste, dry, pine like, fresh hops that ride the palate all the way through. A small hop bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. The nose was lacking, but but tastes great."
"Pours a light golden color, with two fingers of white head.  Smells are citrus hops at the front, with slight pine hops and malt.  Tastes are citrus hops followed by a slightly sweet malt middle and a hop finish that is abrupt. Very well balanced and drinkable.  "
"i prefer the bottle to this all the way. the bottle seems to have more grapefruit and citrus in general. this was more pine. good, but the bottle is better."
"Delicious and juicy, a nice wet hop ale."
"D: not a bad brew but I would have to say that I enjoy Centennial to this. Definitely worth trying. This bottle is about a month old, next year I will try getting it immediately after release to see if the hops give off different flavors/aromas."
"D: very drinkable for an American Pale Ale, I usually don't like overly hopped beers and this one is an exception"
"D: its almost a hybrid of a pilsner and an IPA with the easy of drinking of both."
"Not such a great looking beer, copper in color, loose head which doesn't hang around to long. Aroma is of flowery hops and juicy pine. What a hop bomb! Juicy flowery hoppy flavor, honey and clover, nice bitter bite at the end. Pretty basic on the malty side to allow the hops to really pop. Average mouthfeel nothing special going on there. I could easily put down a four pack of these gems. Highly tasty."
"This is a very drinkable brew. The 6.5% ABV might shy a few away, but for those hop heads out there, this is a great brew and session beer for many. Another great brew by Founders."
"I stlll wish I hadn't missed the keg at Black Sparrow. Thanks to the beer guy at Whole Foods in Indianapolis for bestowing the four pack he had on a latecomer to the Founders Harvest Ale party."
"D: Pleasnatly quaffable, an APA that comes across well in the bottle but is much stronger in the cask."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer and think its one of the best out there in terms of APA and wet hop ales. Very refreshing and not too heavy ABV."
"This is a clean pale beer with a thin lacy head that lingers nicely. This Harvest ale is as Aromatic as I expected. I did pick up lots of onion and some grapefruit hints. My first taste was awesome bitter that opened up on my tongue an assault of onion and grapefruit flavors of varying intensity. I like the soft dry finish, and I just had the necessary hop burp for this to be a good hoppy beer. This beer is smooth and very drinkable which is good for I have a liter growler of it to finish."
"I will say that at 6.5% ABV and 70 IBU's this beer would be more appropriately categorized as an IPA."
"D: A solid pale ale here, and a great beer to have a growler of. I thoroughly enjoyed my several pours."
"Very drinkable beer. This makes a very nice session beer, wish I had bought more than one bottle."
"Overall - Awesome. This is not the freshest bottle, yet im really enjoying it. Still tons of flavor and really a pleasure to drink. Hoepfully next year ill score a super fresh bottle cause this is boardline world class, im thinking fresh will push it over the edge."
"The palate is citrusy, grapefruity, quite floral and a bit lemony. Light in body, very crisp and dry with a nice punchy finish. This is a stellar fresh hop ale."
"D- This is one of the better beers I have ran into in quite some time. It is easy drinking, nothing too heavy on the alcohol, and doesn't rip my face off in terms of hops. I would gladly drink this nightly. Only one though."
"Very nice APA. Great hoppy flavor and presence. Quite tasty. Highly drinkable and enjoyable. This is certainly one of the best harvest ales I've stumbled across."
"D: I wish this were sold in 6ers, because at 6.5%, this is quasi-sessionable and deserves another couple of sleeves in the cardboard holster."
"D_Lots of flavor and low ABV. Very drinkable."
"Good clarity, nice straw color, lacking head. Aromas of pine needles and grain. Good balance and mouthfeel, crisp dry finish. Flavor is intense, fresh piney hops and a solid malt backbone. Bright citrus fruits linger on the palate. Refreshing, solid fresh hop beer."
"D - Really awesome beer. There are a lot of PAs to choose from...this is a solid offering. A bit on the pricey side for a PA (at least where I am)...but not a let down when you try it."
"2013 NOTE: Damn tasty again this year, with a nice mixe of citrus and piney hops; this batch seems very smooth with mild carbonation and each one went down quite easy. Another great session beer, I'm glad I went through two 4 packs as it was outstanding."
"Felt crisp and nicely carbonated. Medium bodied, and went down very smoothly. Could definitely see a four pack of these go down probably too quickly in a single sitting."
"D - Wish I had more. If I did, I'd still be drinking it. My only criticism with the drinkability is that I'm left with a slight bitter, which is expected, but I need some food or water to break up the bitter."
"My first wet hopped ale and from one of my favorite breweries, so I'm going into this with high expectations. Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a medium white head which subsides to a nice lacing. The aroma is strong with citrus fruits: lemon, grapefruit, and slight taste of orange. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. Lemon and grapefuit. Big hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma for a pale ale. There is almost no malt flavor in this beer, just a straightforward hop lovers delight. I even let the beer warm up to close to room temperature and still got no malt presence. This beer has the body of a pale ale and the hop presence of an ipa. I prefer my ipas with a little more complexity and malt presence, but this is still a good beer and ideal if you're craving a hop fix."
"Jake"
"Flavor is excellent as well. Tropical fruits, lemon orange, and a bit of a bready base. Pale malt, a tiny bit of caramel/biscuity flavors. Delicious brew, and the hop bill is unmatched compared to other APAs."
"Clear golden color with a thin white head. Aromas of grapefruit and pine, then vibrant orange and grapefruit citrus-hop flavors. A medium bodied beer with pleasant carbonation. The ABV is a reasonable 6.5% and it is a drinkable beer, but one or two would be my limit given the strong flavor profile."
"Almost like a lighter-bodied, wet-hopped and earthier, Alpha king. Side by side, I may have trouble choosing a winner. If you can get ahold of a fresh bottle of this, it is a must-try/revisit."
"Founders Harvest Ale in 12oz bottle. Picked up at Gary's Wine and Marketplace, Bernardsville location. Poured into shaker. Golden color with large white head. Strong fresh hop smell. Taste is hoppy but balanced with malt. Nice bitterness. Good drinkablity and mouthfeel for 6.5abv. Very good offering from Founders."
"Medium body and finishes like a summer camp memory."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey color with a short tight creamy head that settles into a solid ring. The aroma is of grapefruit hops; fairly fresh and juicy. The aroma is not as strong as I hoped but its nice. The flavor is all juicy hops with grapefruit being the main flavor though some light pine pops through. The hop profile focuses on the flavor not the bitter, which I enjoy. The malt is fairly light and takes a way backseat to the hops. The malt seems quite light for the style but it works. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation, finishes slightly bitter. This is a very yummy pale ale. Nice hop profile with a light malt makes this extremely drinkable. This beer showcases what hops can taste like without bashing the tastebuds. I could easily kill the 4 pack in a short amount of time."
"Pours more of an orange than typical copper or caramel color. Almost no head and no carbonation visible. Smells of grapefruit with some pine in the background, not huge floral notes coming out. Taste is fruity, grapefruit, mango, papaya; almost no bitterness with small malt presence noticable. Very tasty and drinkable beer, not one of the greatest but definitely good to very good."
"D/M: Very well crafted beer with good carbonation that sits well on the tongue. Everything blends together to make this a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours hazy golden orange with thick white head. Aroma is fresh hops, big dose of citrus with some pine. Flavor is fresh dry hops, pine, grapefruit, orange, lemon and a touch of malt. Finishes bitter and crisp. Moderately bitter with a nice dry finish. If you like hops, seek this one out."
"T- More butteriness, its getting kinda strange now. Bread crust and buttered dough form the base. Floral, lemony and leafy hops lend some bitterness to the finish."
"D - It's a shame this only comes around once year, because it certainly merits a regular spot in the fridge. A must try for hopheads as well as the more casual APA drinker."
"Mouthfeel is light-bodied with nice carb that straddles crisp and creamy. Just a touch too prickly. Also, the flavor drops off at the very end with some mild bitterness and slight watery absence of malt wallowing on. I love this beer every year, but it is a touch on the simple side. That's OK, actually perfect for a harvest ale. But it can't compare to Ballast Point Scuplin, even on a bad day."
"D: This is the fruitiest PA I've had yet, no doubt to the recently-harvested hops. I wish it wasn't sold in a 4 pack, considering I'll be trading half of it away. I could have easily had two more without destroying my palate."
"Pretty good, but at $12 a 4 pack the price is a bit steep...would rather have 64oz of Daisy Cutter for $9, than 48oz of this for $12 any day of the week..."
"Great except for the funk. I'm guessing they use Simcoe/Summit? Maybe Michigan grown ""C" hops have that character as well. Other than that, a beer that if it was cheaper and more readily available, I'd drink the fuck out of it."
"Pours a nice amber color with an inch and a half head that slowly dissipates. Smells like fall after a nice rain soaking all the leaves. Tastes like flowers. I have eaten flowers and this is what they taste like. This is damn tasty and very drinkable. Very overpriced though, 11.99 a four pack...could easily be 8.99 a six pack like founders year round brews but it was quite good."
"This is a so-so seasonal brew. I wouldn't go out of my way or trade for it, but it's not bad. There are a few other Octoberfest style beers that I like better this year (Weyerbacher, Victory)."
"D: Very good for a wet-hop harvest ale, competes with Sierra Nevada's offerings in my book as the best I have tried."
"I see this is listed as an APA here...thought it was an IPA...either way it is phenomenal for whichever category."
"IT IS A MUST TRY!"
"Perfectly clear, simple pale yellow gold color with a substantial capping of thick white foam lapping at the top but shifting away moderately quickly to a curtain of lace with some broken spotting. Nice aroma of freshly picked hops right off the vine. Quite green and dense with bittering citric floral pollen thats got a rounded lemony/white grapefruit sense to its nature. Taste is a bit more muted and paled down making for some excellent drinking as its rounded off muted maltyness of semi toasty biscuityness and paled doughyness compacts nicely nuder the crunchy citrus tones of the hops. Good balance as it allows just the right kind of grip to its bite in bitterness levels and flavors. The finish has a uniquely dirty, earthen edge as it adds that fresh off the vine out of the garden impression with its floral nuances. Feel is medium bodied with a clean round center capped with a earthy, floral bitterness of citrus as it ends"
"If the carbonation level is my favorite thing about a beer then I'm not gonna get it again. I don't get how it's rated so high. I was really looking forward to this but I guess I'll have to say it,"The emperor has no clothes."""
"It poured a smooth straw yellow. There was almost no head and the head that remained laced the rim of the glass. It was very translucent and not very cloudy. It smelled like an IPA more than a PA. Very hoppy and floral aromas were present from the get go. The mouthfeel was lackluster, probably because this bottle had plenty of time to sit. It was very drinkable and tasty. It drinks very well and smoothly. I'd recommend it."
"I sometimes get picky where you get to this, one of my favorite styles, but this one makes the cut."
"The balance of this beer makes it very drinkable; unfortunately, at $12 a four pack, it is not priced as a drinkable beer! Grab it when you can and save it for those occasions when you want that extra-tasty beer."
"D. Goes down quick and easy. I could use another one of these."
"T-"
"d- really nice, goes down so easily, very refreshing. yet another great offering from founders!"
"Drinkability is good, not great. Alcohol is not detectable, but the unbalanced bitterness does detract drinkability slightly."
"D: Very good and quite enjoyable. I wonder how I came across this beer so late last year as it is already nearly impossible to find this one already this year. Regardless, freshness is the key with this one as it is a much more impressive beer."
"Another good mark for Founders! Highly recommended."
"D= Great. You can drink these till the cows come hop that is if you can handle your booze."
"If there's a flaw in this beer, and I don't think there is, it's that it's a touch too sweet. It has a powerful, fruity, hop aroma. It has pineapple and citrus hop flavors, with enough of a malty backbone to make it work. It has a bitter finish with enough lingering fruit to balance it. I think this beer relies on fresh, tropical hop flavors that are very fashionable right now. I don't think it does anything to make anything new out of those flavors, and so I think this is a very good beer, but not a great beer."
"D - I think I could drink this all night every night. It has a crisp profile is very well balanced. The crisp hop profile is everything I hope for in a harvest ale."
"a very tasty beer. I will definitely be drinking this one again."
"I think I just found my new favorite pale ale."
"D: Hop profile is very wide and is matched by malts. Very crisp and refreshing."
"The taste is wonderful too. Since the guy I'm splitting this with is the real hophead and I'm more of a beginner to this category, I'm glad that he likes it as well. As mentioned before, I enjoy the lower bitterness while still maintaining the great hoppy flavor."
"D: While not one of Founders best offerings, the Harvest Ale is still a damn good brew and it is certainly very drinkable. The hop forward aroma and flavor, plus hop:malt ratio in this brew could make a strong case for IPA consideration."
"I will be stocking up on this beer every fall from now on. Makes me want to move to Grand Rapids, MI, so I can have this as fresh as possible whenever released."
"Pours a brilliant golden straw color with a nice 2 finger head. Some carbonation is visible as well as sticky lacing. Smells of hops, orange peels, lemons and musky dough. Taste is dry and bitter. Not much of the complexity that is noticeable in the aroma is present in the quaff. Mouthfeel is spot on with the carbonation and the crispness of the APA. A very solid brew from the brewers of founders, I would prefer to drink this in the fall months but great nonetheless."
"D- could drink a lot of these, though for the price I paid, I certainly won't be"
"Hop flavors and aromas mellow out pretty good with time on this one, so drink it fresh if you really want a hop wallup. Soaked a bottle up on 10/14/2009 and then another on 1/11/2010 for comparison. Becomes slightly more balanced with time as malt flavors are unveiled with the diminishing hop intensity. Still one heck of an herbal/grassy fresh hop flavor though 3 months later! Great wet hop brew, definitely need to try this!"
"The beer is poured a bright orange to yellow color with hints of amber along the sides of the glass. A quarter inch white colored head, thinning out to a light layer on top. A grassy and pine fragrance strikes the nose, with the feint scent of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon. A strong malt flavor, with a hearty bread flavor then halfway across the palate, a hop bitterness brining the flavors of grapefruit, grass, and pine dominate the taste. A slightly thin feel at the front, then gradually gains weight to become more of a medium bodied feel. This beer is drinkable, for a hophead, a strong bright color, an intense aroma, with palate abusing hop flavors. The textures inconsistency does bring the beer down."
"This is one hoppy smelling beer. Pours a clear amber/yellow/orange color with a nice white head. Smells of hops. Taste like hops. Must be hoppy! And yes, it is hoppy. Semi good lacing. I don't really pick up a whole lot of malt in this one. Fairly one sided but I expected that from this. Light to medium mouthfeel."
"Overall, this beer is very good, but I wonder if hops are dried before using them in beer for a reason. I love hoppy beers, but this one comes across a little too green to get top marks."
"Drinkability is ridiculous. This is a beer you could have many of with no problem at all."
"I missed this one last year. i will NEVER let that happen again. you want a fresh beer? this bad boy is the freshest, juiciest (can i say juiciest?) harvest out there right now. i snatch up these four packs like its going out of style now. if i had to find a flaw it would be that the appearance is very light. it smells of intense citrus, resin, and it is sticky. this is the beer that got my roommate off macros. he hasn't looked back. i feel like a proud dad."
"Poured hazy yellow color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly diminished with fair lacing. Solid balanced tart citrus hoppy and yeasty aroma. Light to medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium balanced bittersweet flavor with a medium smooth sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew."
"This beer pours an orange color with golden hues. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into decent lacing. This is a sharp looking beer. The aroma is as green as I've ever experienced. I think I can accurately describe it as smelling as if there are hop cones still submerged in the beer. And I'm actually surprised that there aren't. The malt bill is reminiscent of that of Founder's Centennial IPA, and Pale Ale, and that is alright by me. The taste is akin to the aroma. The leafy, grassy, hoppy character is very sharp, while the malt profile is nice and soft. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a great beer. If only someone could invent a hop that could be harvested year round so beers like this could be brewed year round. As is this will be one of my most looked forward to beers of the fall."
"D - I could drink these all night. While I don't consider myself a hophead, these could change that real fast."
"It's a shame that I wasn't able to experience Harvest Ale immediately after bottling. That said, it has held up remarkably well and is pleasing me to no end this morning. Hoppy beer is a fine way to start the day, spend the day and end the day. Good job Founders."
"J"
"I could and would drink a four pack of this a day, it's my favorite wet hopped beer and one of my favorite pale's, but that's just nitpicking, Founder's Harvest is Damn good beer, go get some. Cant wait till next year's release."
"This one went down smoothly and quickly, another great beer from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and recommend this to a hop lover where the flavor profile is nicely balanced where the hoppy bitter finish really is a nice change."
"D - The flavor is good and the smell brings a lot of fruit to the nose. Even the non-hop-loving girlfriend likes this one! A solid brew worth buying a four-pack or two of. A good brew all around I wish I had more of!"
"Bottle courtesy of bret27. Pours golden with an orange tinge and a wet, frothy, white head. Aroma is bright and tropical, with very mild cattiness (Simcoe?), oranges, and herbs. Flavor really isn't as hoppy as the aroma, some citrus notes but not much else. There is still a medium bitterness that lingers awhile. Body is light but not thin, carbonation is soft, finish is dry."
"Drinkability- Very tasty, but huge hop presence makes multiple bottle unlikely. Love the freshness."
"No flaws. A top tier American IPA."
"Like i said previously. This one is very high on the drinkability scale. Light fruity crisp and refreshing. I could definitely session this one. Founders is in the upper tier of breweries in the world. I knew this would be another great brew from them and i wasn't disappointed."
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of fisherman4. Pours a golden yellow with a thick white one finger head. Tight lacing. Nose- strong tropical fruits (pineapple, mango). Taste- more citrus hops blasting from the forefront. Leads to a chewy grapefruit middle and drying back end. Malts are only along for the ride on this one. More of a west coast style malt dryness to this so lighter bodied that really delivers the hops. Crisp refreshing carbonation that helps push through the hop resin. Tasty stuff"
"This was a clearly well-balanced beer. Too often when we get hopped beers, it becomes a hop bomb, and I am of the persuasion that interesting beers are interesting, but quaffable beers are paragon. The familiar grassy, floral smell of hops is present in the nose, but the taste was not dominated completely by hops. They were there, of course, but played well with the malt too and neither bashed you over the head. That's what I appreciated about this beer."
"Pours a translucent, honey golden color with a fluffy white head of small bubbles with not much retention or lacing. Nose is potent punch of grapefruit and grassy hops, slightly sweet, not much else. Very nice, excellent for an APA, though not very complex. Thick bodied with strong carbonation in the dry finish. Flavor throughout is heavy on oily grapefruit hops and earthy/grassy notes, with minimal presence of malt backbone. This is pretty great for an APA, about as much hops and flavor as you could hope for and finishes with a lingering bitter pungent citrus flavor. Overall, the flavor is a little too sweet for more to rate this higher, but this is one of my favorite harvest ales I've had this season."
"D: This is yummy, the fresher the better, makes me wish I had a kegerator so I could drink a few of these every night."
"Medium bodied, nice carbonation, with a bittersweet aftertaste. A very easy beer to drink. As usually is the case, this is another great beer from Founders."
"Purchased from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Pours a bright gold body with a white head. Aroma is dominated by piney and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Great hop flavor throughout which seems to ""build"" after the finish, much like the heat of a chili pepper. Very good drinkability."
"This is the best APA I have ever had, simply love it. Drinkability is at the top for me, I could drink this all the time if I could afford and find it."
"Drinkability? Get out of here! 6.5%abv and seriously, I could stay with this brew all.night.long! It is that satisfying to me. I put it in the upper echelon of American Pale Ales."
"Pours a very pale gold color topped with a thin lacy white head. Very fragrant and fills the nose with sweet juicy hop aromas. The flavor is very similar and the light body is filled with sweet juicy flavors from the wet hops. Light refreshing body with mild carbonation levels. The full hop flavor mellows and finishes with sweet hints of the hop bitterness."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color, full fluffy white head, good retention, lacing and oily residue after the sip. Smell is of grassy, floral and piney hops with a nice citrus and cereal grain presence throughout. Taste follows scent with a delicious combination of fresh grassy, floral, piney and citrus hops. Very nice grainy background with some asprin like tastes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly oily, slight grainyness to it. Very good, non extreeme beer from founders. Not quite as good as the Sierra Nevada Estate Harvest, which i find to be slightly more earthy, but better then the Sierra Wet Hop Harvest."
"Despite my love for hops, I usually ignore a lot of harvest ales in favor of pumpkin ales. Glad I didn't overlook this one this year."
"I like this beer quite a bit. It's nice to taste a hop focused APA that isn't dashing headlong into IPA territory."
"Cereal grains in the backround with some aspirin hop flavors. Bready too, with a bit of biscuits and caramel. So maybe cara 10L and 2-row? I dont know, but its simple, and delicious and I really enjoyed it."
"From Bruisin' Ales. Pours dark golden, with significant white head. Hoppy aroma, tad above average mouthfeel. Very drinkable tasty, though significant IBU, still some balance. Hop lead citrus lemon mint. Very good representative of an IPA, and one I would trust even to novices."
"Another solid offering from Founders--a pale gold color with fleeting head and lacing. Smell is largely floral and citrus hops... not too strong, but delicious. Taste follows the nose, with a nice bitter punch up front. Good stuff here. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, but nice dry finish with it. A good sessionable beer here."
"All around another excellent beer from Founders. It's just a shame this beer has such limited availability."
"Jordan."
"This beer's definitely worth trying. The problems that it has with mouthfeel are easily compensated for by its excellent flavor and smell."
"The head crests at about one finger, bleached white and mostly large to very large bubbles which helps it dissipate swiftly, moderate stickiness to the lacing. More dark yellow in color than light orange amber, has a gauziness which traps light inside despite the overall lighter hue. The hops-driven nose is more peat moss and forest floor scrub than grassy, more relaxed and less stiff than expected, orange peel, very light honey, more so pineapple, nectarine bite with softer apricot tones, pine oil, the malts very much in the background. Medium-bodied, here the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus leaps out at you. Resiny pine, more of the forest scrub, has a yeasty side that just manages to carve out a niche. Starts off dry and ends much drier, even as it adheres to your mouth walls it prickles and falls away. Again, little malt balance, a smooth residue at best. Comes across like it serves two masters, one make a big impression, the other stay true to your roots. Very good but not benchmark."
"Not something I can drink a lot of as it kills my palate, but very good for a one beer with a chicken dinner."
"D- While this wasn't the most impressive APA, it was damn good and extremely drinkable. I could put several of these back quickly."
"Review from notes taken on: 11/9/09."
"D: Starts off great -- really great -- but finishes badly. I'm mixed about this one."
"D- Very drinkable, almost like a session if it had lower abv. But thats just my opinion, I love these fresh hop beers. And this is a great one, one of the best imo."
"Pours a super pale golden hazed color with a bright white head forming thick, I was shocked at how light this beer poured. The nose was full of pungent fresh wet hops esepcially citrus/herbal/grassy tones, of course there is a light pale biscuit malt feature addeded in the nose as well. Pretty damn good bitterness balanced with enough pale biscuit malts just to take the edge of it, but as a whole it's a dank super hoppy harvest ale from our friends at Founders...damn I'm going to get some 12.99 4 packs at Giant Eagle this coming week a damn tasty fine beer that should be drank in number meant to be enjoyed with friends. I was buying this for a friend not familiar with the hops and he kept calling it the ""weed"" beer, by the way he was loving it. Mouthfeel was bitter dry clean finish, with ample carbonation and the drinkability factor was inasane for something so hoppy. I could have drank this one all night as my only Harvest Ale at the Sharp Edge where two different Founders beers were flowing on tap. I had two pints of Founders Centennial but I really liked the Harvest ale."
"D: A very flavorful APA with loads of citrus hops. Grassy, but not too much like some harvest ales. Quite drinkable. This is my second 4 pack, I liked it so much."
"d- its drinkable, wouldn't have more then a few at one time because of the hop oil taste on this one,"
"D - Very drinkable. Balanced, refreshing, great beer."
"Very tasty offering, very drinkable. If these characteristics are common to wet-hop ales, I'll be seeking these out regularly in the autumn."
"The body on this beer is moderatley carbonated, with a dry, bitter finish. Even though this is billed as a pale ale, its a sipper. Very bitter and with a solid body, this is a one or two pour deal."
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a hazy/murky bright orange almost yellowish with a one finger white head. The head starts to slowly dissolve and before I take my first sip it's nearly gone, just parts of it still floating at the top. Still it leaves a little lacing on the glass. The smell is probably one of the better smelling IPAs I've had yet this fall. Very hoppy, citrus but mainly a nice piney hop smell for me. The taste isn't as bitter as I was expecting, but not exactly smooth. Very hoppy, pine hops are there and the citrus hops are a bit more apparent than in the smell. The only real bitterness is in the aftertaste. Not a high ABV so this one I could do the four pack of in a night and it's that good I could. I great IPA from Founders but I didn't expect anything less."
"D-This is a great beer. A bit one dimentional (no malt) but if you like hop flavor without overpowering bitterness, than you'll like this beer."
"D- I find founders to make some of the most drinkable brews around, and this one makes this one surely makes the cut. However, I don't think this one's quite good enough to become one of my favorites..."
" Poured into a tumbler pint, great color, and head retention and aroma to die for. Taste again of pine woods and citrus spioe. Very well balanced with and excelent finish. so easy on the palate. A lingering rememberence like the season, of of the best of its class, my harvest for 2009. Cheers to Founders!"
"-Cheers."
"D: Top notch. A consistently solid harvest ale from Founders. It is up there among the best in the style."
"D- This beer is drinking so easy it's almost hard to put down the glass. I could make this a everyday beer but sadly it's not offered year around."
"What a great drinker. Probably the best wet-hop beer I've had yet."
"D: An exceptional brew that misses the not so pleasant grassiness that some harvest ales are overpowered with and instead delivers fresh, sumptuous citrus and floral hops on a delicious substantial caramel and pale malt cookie-like sweetness. Another big winner from Founders."
"notes: Founder's is one of my favorite breweries, and while this doesn't disappoint, it falls just outside my favorite Harvest ales."
"just a touch cloying for drinkability in the strict sense, but i'd be happy to take me time for more of these."
"D: I could easily down the next three from the four pack, easily drinkable. Because the pine flavors lingered so strong for so long, I drank mine slowly to get the most flavor I could, which was great."
"Between Hoppin Frog, Sierra Nevada, Southern Tier, and Founders, this has been an excellent Harvest Ale season. Another gem from Founders. Strong hoppyness smoothed out to a nice and juicy mouthfeel. Well worth checking out. Excellent beer."
"Good medium mothfeel, and I could probably drink a bunch of these. I love this spicy character."
"Would drink again, but it's too bad it's a seasonal. Would not be bad at all to drink on a fall day after some time outside playing football."
"D: Highly drinkable, this is like an IPA with less citrus character. However, taste here is very developed and complex nonetheless."
"Nose full of grapefruit. Mouth full of pure hop freshness. A sweet maltiness peaks through and lingers on the tongue to take the bite off the hops. A strong but not overwhelming bitterness lingers on the back of the palate, capped with a presence of pine. Light color- almost yellow. Medium body with a good bit of effervescence. Cream of the crop."
"A warm coppery leaning towards golden color with a fluffy white head. A sturdy sheet of lace sticks to the surface of the beer and glass. Powerful aroma of fresh hops with a nice mix of citrus and pine. The flavors are almost overwhelming in their intensity. The usual IPA flavors of grapefruit and pine are noticeable but there's an unusually strong fruitiness to this one. Hard to pin down really, it seems at times musty and yet also leans towards a tropical melon-like flavor. Very intriguing and different. The feel is pleasant, light and refreshing with a biting dryness on the finish. I could see this as a love it or hate it kind of beer but it has a very unique flavor profile that definitely makes it worth trying. I would definitely be happy to drink another."
"Straw body with a thin white head. Aroma is sigh-inducing with great pine, citrus, floral and peppery hop notes. What kind of hops are in this thing? It smells like fresh hops. Ever made hop tea? This aroma reminds me of hop tea. Flavor is very light - not much malt, average bitterness, then fades to a wet grassy note. A bit more sweetness and peppery hops appear after a few sips. Body is solid - carbonation is well balanced and enhances the flavor - the bitterness and the grassiness just linger. Hop burps provide a very pleasant hop flavor as well! Sweet! Drinkability is OK. Sort of like a heavy-bodied, over hopped pils."
"Pour is surprisingly light in color - yellowish orange.. a nice head but it settles quickly. Looks like a pilsner or such. Aroma is very fruity, grapefruit, lemon, and lots of hop. Flavor is also very fruity hop.. quite sweet but not in a iipa malty way, all sweetness from citrus flavor. This is really the first wet-hopped ipa i've had that sort of shows me what the real difference is between a wet or dry-hopped ipa (not that i've had tons of wet hop beers, that is). So its quite delicious. A nice light mouth (not watery) with crisp carbonation adds and increases the drinkability. I could down a ton of this stuff, especially say at a party or such. Perhaps it would be better-suited to summertime, though I suppose thats not possible."
"D- Easy to drink, well made APA."
"(D)- A solid beer that is easy to enjoy. However, I think that Founders' other Pale Ale/IPAs far exceed what this has to offer. This is simpler; more straightforward, but still a good one at that."
"D - This is drinkable and I would drink it again, but would not go out of my way to find it."
"Dangerously drinkable. If the abv was higher I would be in trouble. I'm torn between this and Broodoo. I guess I'll have to do a side by side."
"very drinkable and full of character."
"Hazy pale golden with a fine eggshell head that leaves crusty spiderweb lacing on the glass in big rings. Fresh and fruity dank sticky hops filled my nostrils the minute I cracked this one open like grapefruit and pine sap. The flavor lives up to the nose just fine and is bursting with juicy fresh hops that don't completely overwhelm the flavor but this is a hop bomb for sure. Medium light bodied with mild carbonation. A really fabulous brew when enjoyed fresh."
"I would actually prefer this beer if they backed off on the IBU's and give me more of that bursting hop flavor and irresistable aroma. Outside of the nose, I'm looking for an 'it' quality that just isn't quite there."
"D - This is a great pale ale. It reminded me instantly of Alpha King, which is a good thing. Another quality brew from Founders."
"I feel rather bad giving this beer a less-than-excellent rating, as it is the first thing I've had from Founders that was not top-notch. Hops flavor was a bit off - herbal hovering on grassy, with a flatly bitter finish. Perhaps the hops variety just isn't hitting the spot for me, but I found myself uninterested in going for a second bottle. Gave it a second try on the chance that the one particular bottle was a bit off, but the same. A sub-par beer for me."
"Poured a clear yellow/amber with a modest head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was hop citrus. The taste was citrus, but not in a heavy handed way. The malt was barely noticeable at first, but as the ale warmed, it came through. There was a slight needle aftertaste. The feel was medium bodied with reasonable carbonation. Drinkability was good. A very good beer, but based on price, this was a bit of a miss for Founders. Alpha King was far superior."
"This stuff is liquid crack. I wish I had a case but am extremely happy to have landed a four pack. Hopheads should seek this one out."
"this is a good beer, nothing that'll knock your socks off but still a really good beer."
"Drinkability: Its deliciously hoppy but not overly bitter. It drinks very easily. On the high end of the ABV scale for the style, but that will in no way stop you from drinking the four pack yourself during a game or something. One of the most expensive APAs though at around $10 a 4-pack."
"Overall, big fresh hop flavor and aroma-Another winner from Founder's"
"D: Very high. Gimme another and 1 more 4 pack."
"m&d: slightly slick and oily. light to medium bodied. Plenty of carbonation. Finishes dry. Very drinkable ABV, may not really be a session beer due to the dryness."
"overall a nice harvest ale..good seasonal transition beer..."
"Overall this is a very hoppy pale ale that I quite enjoyed. American pale ales are becoming more like IPA's and I like that. Good stuff from Founders yet again."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good for one or two. I'm not sure I could see having more than that in one session, however."
"Drinkability: Good, could burn through several of these... if there wasn't any two hearted to be had."
"The funky high powered hop flavor really shows what a fresh/wet hop beer should taste like. This is one worth seeking out if you have not yet tried it."
"D - I don't think I can this anything but a 5. I mean...the fresh hops are just so bright and intense. I only have one bottle. What a shame. This is awesome. It's classified as an APA on here. Why?"
"Another solid offering from Founders. Admittedly I think this should be called ""Cannabis Ale"" rather than Harvest, but to each their own."
"Tom and Analise!"
"Through the roof drinkability. As long as I can get this & the frehness is there, this a must purchase every time I cross the Mizzou State line! If not the best fresh hop beer I've had it is in the top 3..."
"Pours a pale golden to yellow/straw color with a large white head that has good retention. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The lack of depth in color was shocking for an APA, but the head and lacing that comes from the hops saved the score. Has a highly hopped aroma of grapefruit, flowers, and pine needles. That is about it from the aroma. The flavor is likewise one dimensional. This beer has one focus and that is to show off the hops. But can't we have some malt flavor? Bitter and astringent. A little hard to drink. The body is too light for so much hops and bitterness. Carbonation is ok. Not the easiest drinking beer unless you are a hophead. I understand what the brewer is doing here but I do not care that much for the effort."
"D-Pretty drinkable, but the distinct hop flavors may dissuade some imbibers."
"Overall, this is a really nice beer. I am starting to really enjoy the fresh hop beers and this one is no exception. I will be drinking this one again!"
"D- Really drinkable with tons of hoppy bitterness. If these were only a bit cheaper they would easily become a regular in my fridge."
"This beer is very good and is a great way to celebrate the harvest. It has a perfect balance of Malt and Hops."
"Overall- this is a good brew. i have to be an ass tho and give them nothing higher than a b+ for the fact of the four pack. they need to come out in 6er's!!"
"(reviewed by Daniel)"
"Notes: Well after so much good news from fellow BA's about this Harvest Ale I was motivated to try it when I saw it in the cooler. Had I known that it was pretty much an IPA I might have left it there. I am going to Founders Brewing Company next week in Grand Rapids, MI and so now I know that I do not need to order this one."
"D - Quite possibly the best pale ale that I've ever had. I regret only grabbing one 4 pack. I hope more shows up!"
"M/D - Pretty light mouthfeel, very enjoyable. I could drink this all day. I agree with some of the previous reviews saying this does not really fit in the APA category. It is closer to an IPA. There needs to be a fresh/wet hop category. I will definitely buy again soon while it's fresh. This is one meant to be drank fresh."
"D: Oh this one you can sit with for a long time. Great taste, great feel, not filling, and is blended well."
"A great beer from a great brewery. Make sure to get drink this as fresh as possible. This my friends is fresh hop juice."
"This guy pours a clear golden color with a soapy thin head. The smell is pretty much what I expected... wet hops. I get more of a vegetative smell than most APAs. I don't know how else to describe the taste other than ""wet"". I didn't think wet-hopping would make much of a difference but you can taste it. Unfortunately, I was expecting a bigger, bolder hop flavor for how fresh this beer is. Carbonation is also a bit higher than I'd like for this style. Overall this is a pretty drinkable and interesting ale but not one of Founders' best."
"D= I'm going to rate this one as a wet hop ale not an APA like it says I think harvest ales should have their own category. Really delicious and obviously a wet hopped beer. Perfect for what it is almost. A little increase in tyhe appearance and this would be awesome."
"I've got 3 more of these. I was hoping for something better and if one of the others deliver that I'll update this review."
"D: A very refreshing beer and easy to go through a four pack of in no problem. My biggest problem with the beer is that I did not buy more than one four pack. I guess I will just have to go back tomorrow."
"D: Highly drinkable! It's got a lot of good, fresh, earthy, hoppy flavor, but not so dank that it hurts the sessionability. Definitely something I wish was available year round as this is one of the better regular pale ales that I've had."
"Very drinkable beer, almost too drinkable."
"pours a blond mostly clear color with a nice full fresh head bottled on 92309..the smell is huge in this one i poured it and right away smelled pine and grapefruit and hop resins..the taste was awesome good it was fresh hops and pine just filling the taste buds with a grapefruit and pine resins the malt backbone in this one was a little light but still very tasty..it reminds me of a double trouble light version..really though this one is great it is a hop lovers ale not to be missed comes in a 4-pak @ 6.1% abv you can put these away and will..my advice buy 2.. 4-paks wont be around very long..highly recommended"
"Amber hues with a nice, fluffy white head with good retention and lacing. Aromas are heavy grapefruit hops. Fresh off the vine aromas...yum! Aromas are really strong with grapefruit. The citrus is massive and really fresh, like the hops were thrown in ten minutes before I drank it. Bitterness is huge and there is a good deal of pine, too. Medium mouth and high carbonation, carb being a Founders issue if you ask me. Easy to drink and lots of residuals."
"Overall, this is a knockout. I was skeptical about paying 15 bucks for a four pack, but it was justified and well worth it in the end. Simply amazing, no, the best APA I have had to date by leaps and bounds. WOW."
"One yummy freshly hopped up ale from Founders."
"D - Pretty drinkable pale ale...really good. Plenty of hop flavor, manageable 6.5% alcohol, smooth body. Very good - could easily be happy staying with this one for a night and finishing off the 4pk."
"Drinkability:Pretty interesting brew. Very heavy flavor and aroma."
"Well...worth a try."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a brilliant gold with less than a finger of white head. Massive piney hop aroma, almost too ""green"". Some bready malt in the aroma as it warms. Big hop profile in the flavor. Bursting with hop presence. More pine along with citrus. A bit vegetal however. Very drying hop finish. Lighter side of medium bodied. If you are looking for a blast of fresh hop flavor, this is your beer."
"The 2013 version was upped from 6.5% to 7.6%. Bigger is not always better. Bad change in my opinion. Still very good, but definitely not as good. If it remains this way next year, I will have to re-review and lower my score."
"A very drinkable harvest ale from Founders"
"Final thoughts: Pretty decent for a fresh hop IPA, lots of earthy spicey citrus pine hops and hop oils and resin tastes. Pretty bitter on the finish. The strange musty taste, the long lingering bitterness, and the fact that it seems like it's missing something, seem to take away from it a little. I really do feel like it's missing some specific hop variety, or some malt offset that it could use. I can enjoy this though, just very slowly."
"D - Very sessionable. Really enjoyed this one and along with Broodo, make up my favorite Harvest Ales."
"Because this beer had ""Founders"" on the label, I had high hopes for this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but a little more hops would do this beer justice."
"A very tasty brew, one you could drink for a night. Very light, but still hoppy an bitter enough for the name IPA."
"I really greatly enjoyed this bottle and imagine it is at least as good fresh. Well balanced and tasty, this is exactly what I look for in my APAs."
"A very drinkable beer - nice balance to the flavors. Another solid offering from Founder's."
"founders strikes again!!"
"EDIT: This beer is still drinking well well after the harvest season. It's not nearly as hoppy, but there's still something utterly delicious about it--sort of a sweet bready flavor."
"Light pale ale with great hop aroma. Very refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, too much carbonation, nice two-finger plus white foamy head, with tons of sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, citrus. The taste is sweet, hoppy, malty, nice touch of citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, not a fan of over carbonated brew's, but after it settled down it is tasty."
"Not bad but not world class either. Nice fresh hop beer but not any better than the Sierra Nevada version."
"D--Great for a session, the hop burps come quickly and are just as tasty as the beer. Could put back the 4 pack of this very easily. This might be a great introduction to craft beer, but not something I would pursue."
"Overall solid from top to bottom and one of the highlights for me in a long weekend of new beers. I would go for this one on a warm day anytime without hesitation,"
"Pours a quite foggy orange gold with a thinner light creme head. Nose is pungent pine and salty hops. Flavor is quite salty and intense. Not precisely the ""wet-hopped"" characters I would expect, but really: how wet can the hops be upon delivery to Michigan? Not hatin', just sayin'. On the powerfully salty hops with minor pine tones there seems like some obliterated lemon tang as well. Feel is smooth and slightly thick on liquid and the carbonation is middle of the road. This is super hoppy and I can dig it. But the label says ""wet-hopped ale"" and I would have never guessed so in a blind taste test."
"Very very refreshing"
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Notes: great pale. all the flavor and aroma benefits of hops without the bitterness. just perfect. i drank our last bottle of the year though so im sad"
"D - Hell yeah. Good beer to have around."
"D - Overall this is a pretty good beer I think I've drank IPAs with less hops than this beer but thats not really a bad thing worth trying sometime"
"Had this one chilling in the fridge for a couple few months now--wish I would have had it sooner so I could have bought more while it was around! Poured a very bubble pale golden with a thick white head that stayed pretty frothy awhile. It's got a strong hoppy scent. Whooo, it's got the feel of a pale but the punch of an IPA. A solid hop smack with plenty of citrus notes in it as well. It finishes delightfully dry with plenty of hop bitterness. Definitely a drinkable beer. Another fantastic brew from founders--highly recommend!"
"D- Very highly drinkable, it's too bad it only comes in 4 packs."
"Pours a pale golden color that is extremely fizzy. A fresh soapy citrus smell: lemon, lime and orange. A crisp and refreshing flavor of citrus and hops. Again, something clean and soapy comes to mind (Pinesol Lemon?). Very clean, light and sessionable with drinkability to the max."
"Very good."
"drinkability is good if you like grassy, hoppy beer. and with a ~6% abv i'd say that sessionable for me. it would be easy to have the whole 4 pack at once, but the price will keep me from doing that..."
"White fluffy giant head, golden yellow color that gives of scents of grass, citrus and sweetness. Taste is both hoppy and refreshing. Enjoyable, always interesting fresh hop beers. Always makes me think of how lucky I am to live in fresh hop land."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit oily."
"Wanted to really enjoy just couldn't get into this one, wondering if I drink too late."
"I'll have another..."
"Drinkability - a good authentic example of an American IPA. It's tasty and it kept my interest throughout. Good session choice."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a lighter golden color.with a huge white head, lots and lots of carbonation. Nose of citrus orange and grapefruit hops. Taste of some light pine, juicy grapefruit and balanced with some sweet malt. Pretty simple in taste. Pretty good brew overall and worth a shot!"
"A terrific fresh hop ale that I'll be picking up another case of next fall. You should too."
"D - This was a good beer, didn't quite balance out for my extreme tastes, but still a good beer"
"Mouthfeel is ok. This beer was way over cabonated at first though it seemed to fade to an acceptable level. Pretty solid APA, but Ive had better."
"Pours an attractive, warm apricot, hazy with ""floaties," and a thick white, fluffy head. Very nice. The smell is very appealing - grapefruit, orangeblossom, and pine resin. Taste is delicious. I think this may be somewhat aged, as the hop profile seems a bit muted. The citrus is light and tingley, with a sweet, syrupy honey swimming beneath. It is complex, balanced, and immensely enjoyable. This is a great pale ale."
"The aroma is hoppy with citrus, pine, and herbs. The malt is also there to balance it out. The appearance is hazy gold/orange with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma. Its simple but good. The palate is average for the style. Overall its a wonderful beer."
"Wow A cloudy bright golden color with a huge fluffy offwhite head that lasts forever,lots of sheeting and sticky lace,lively carbonation.Aroma of hops,pine,lemon,lime rind,and a sweetness that changes from faint honey to old fashioned rock candy.I knew this beer existed but never knew or read much about it,so I had no expectations,other than Founders usually is VERY GOOD. This stuff blew me away. WoW a sort of a grainy ultra light toast,with a fat piny/citrus taste,a faint note of honey,very faint,crisp lively mouthfeel leaves your lips a little sticky. Super Ultra Good, The Bomb !"
"D- Very easy to drink and also very solid."
"M/D - Medium bodied and incredible oiliness. Crisp and easy drinking."
"Overall, this is a easily drinkable beer but I agree with some of the previous reviews that it may be a bit much to try and have more than 1 in an evening. I will enjoy it again."
"An interesting pale ale for sure, but I really like this. Totally refreshing and easy to drink, but still satisfies the hop-head's need for bold bitterness. I would love to have year-round access to a beer like this. A nice, clean cut, American pale ale. One the ladies can feel safe about taking home to their mothers."
"Couldn't drink another one for a couple days, but a very refreshing beer."
"D-This one of my favorite fresh hop beers. I like this one a little warm (closer to 60degf). Either way it drinks great. Tons of flavor, without being overwhelming."
"Overall: Thanks to TheodorHerzl for this great beer. I like it a lot. It is probably the best Harvest Ale I have had this year."
"A: Thinnest layer of tightly packed foam, golden yellow - 4.00, S: Full fresh/green hop aroma, smells like a pine forest - 4.25, T: Sharp but not an extreme hop bit, pale malt backing, somewhat dry - 4.00, M: 3.50, D: Another success from Founders, this beer has just enough hop bite to border on the IPA line, full flavored and wonderfully done with the fresh hops - 4.50"
"Happy New Year!!!"
"Recommended..."
"Drinkability, very nice. While this is a hop lovers brew its more the flavor than the punch that makes this Harvest a pleaser indeed."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- It's a bit rugged in the mouth, with the carbonation ripping through the palate... however, considering the depth of flavor and bitterness here, it's appropriate. The sheer pleasure of enjoying a beer *this* fresh with regard to its hopping is enough of a treat, but this one really hits the mark in all categories."
" The taste started out gentle, with a typical crystal malt presence and a hint of biscuit. Quickly, a lip-smacking alpha acid presence from the hops rode from the middle to throughout the finish, delivering a nice bitterness that seemed more in the ballpark of an IPA than a regular Pale Ale. A bit of fruity sweetness was detected as well, similar to the aroma. Mouthfeel was excellent, equal parts resinous and crisp, perfectly carbonated, and refreshing. A bit thick for a Pale, but that's okay with me. Overall, an impressive brew that lives up to the Founders repertoire, and one I hope to encounter down the road."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with some darker, more syrupy hues of amber. Two fingers + of foamy white head has excellent retention and yields some nice lacing stick. Smells fresh; citrus, pine resin, floral hops, caramel, grainy malt, and honey. Tastes of citrus fruits like grapefruit and pineapple, along with some lemon and even a touch of pear mixing with honey, grains, and saltine crackers in the backbone. Finishes with a spicy hop kick along with pine. Medium in body with fabulous carbonation for the style. A great balance of sweet and bitter with some saltiness thrown in to keep the tongue active. Creamy yet crisp with some good lip smacking action, and really fresh tasting. After having a bottle of last year's batch last year around this time I thought it was more of a British style IPA, but this year I'm really impressed with it. Very easy to drink, tastes excellent, and could definitely be sessioned. Great stuff."
"Fresh and natural. Light, but heavy at the same time make this guy very easy to drink."
"Picked up a single at Abe's for $2.65. Pours a clear gold with a fluffy white head and lacing. Mmm. Smells like I just stuck my nose in a bag of hops. The flavor still allows a little bread crust malts through to provide balance. Otherwise, there's a nearly overwhelming pine and grapefruit taste. Frankly it could be more complex, like some of the great harvest ales out there, but this is still a tasty ale and finishes with a black pepper-tasting bitterness. Certainly on the drinkable side of wet-hopped beers."
"This one is a winner!!!"
"Drinkability- This is amazingly smooth despite it's strange faults. I could drink this all day long, and given a day at the bar, likely would. I need to head up to MI for a beer tour sometime soon in my life."
"The smell is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to flavorful. Quite lush in it's taste. A sweet citrus burst of crisp & clean lemony tartness wakens the first. As it coats the mouth in a full but not too thick way notes of pear, spices and warm malts make their presence known but none of them pushing their way to the front screaming ""Here I am"" but complimenting each other in the all kinds of magic complexities that Founders has mastered. The finish is balance of fruit juicy nectar's, class A hop bitters and a spicy malt warmth. Very drinkable all the way through."
"D- Easy drinking beer right here. So flavorful and fresh. Naturally sweet and zesty. I really loved this one."
"D, notes. This beer is very drinkable. Bitterness is not harsh or overpowering. Nice fresh hop character with some good earthiness."
"D-Very enjoyable except for the way it poured(in 08)....love the use of hops in this one... (09 notes) ..tough to find an APA much better than this.."
"A lemony citric brew with a firm malt backbone. Not bad at all - though the feel puts a bit of a dent in the drinkability for me."
"I think there is something to be said for a beer that stays within traditional concepts of what a beer is, but manages to be both unique, and incredible tasty. That is, this won't blow anyone's mind about what a beer can be (like a person trying their first DIPA), but it is still as enjoyable and complex as any ""extreme"" beer. Hence why I gave it such a high rating."
"Pours a light straw color with a billowing off white cloud of head. Smells like of floral hops, like grass and pine. Taste is similar to smel; pine up front, but quickly followed by the malt. Nothing really sticks in the taste, but incredibly drinkable."
"Overall this was a pretty unique beer, certainly not what I was expecting. The very slight tartness went surprisingly well with the other flavors, and the hop presence balanced out the sweet malt nicely. Worth a shot."
"D - Fresh and enjoyable... Very easy to enjoy... Sessionable even at 6.1% ABV... Looks great, but above average in all other respects... Not a classic, but definatley a brew I'd enjoy in the"
"on tap at Founders Harvest Ale Fest: Appearance is a hazy golden color with a medium sized off-white head with soe nice lacing. Wonderful fresh hop aroma that's mostly citrus with some floral otes. taste is mostly grapefruit,orange zest, and lemon with a nicely balanced malt sweetness. A very drinkable and refreshing beer"
"Overall a very tasty APA."
"D - Bud Light ain't got nothin on this. It's got a bite - I mean it's focusing on hops, why wouldn't it, but doesn't taste like Pine-Sol (Pine-Sol Heaven, son.)."
"Since i discovered Founders' Harvest it became my favorite pale. It already teases with a smell of freshly mowed grass while you're still opening the bottle and pouring the beer. Nice lacing. Not terribly bitter or has a terribly long finish but flavorful enough to keep your interest though the whole glass."
"12/31/08 Edit: Just had this on tap and it was even better. If reviewing this as on tap I'd raise both the taste & mouthfeel much higher. A really ""sweet"" beer on tap."
" highly enjoyable."
"Like all beers Founders makes, this is still recommended."
"D - With the exception of the carbonation, I found it enjoyable. I had high hopes for this one but I didn't think it was worthwhile; especially at $10 / 4 pack. I could get a Stone or Lagunitas IPAs for less."
"yum"
"D: an enjoyable beer but I prefer the Centennial and Pale Ale more."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head. Aroma dominated by hops but with a nice touch of malt. Flavor dominated initially by intensely bitter hops up front well balanced by a nice maltiness. Crisp and very drinkable."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Smuttynose shaker glass. Appears a slightly cloudy bright yellow color with a good two fingers of fluffy white foam. Aroma and taste is packed with hop notes such as citrus(grapefruit, bitter lemon) grass, caramel malt, pine and alcohol. Delicious! Medium in both body and carbonation. IMO, the tastiest harvest ale I've had and one I look forward to each release."
"D - Terrific flavor and a moderate alcohol means a pleasant drinking experience. Certainly worth picking up."
"On the full side of medium-bodied, Founder's Harvest is one of my favorites of the style I've tried to date. Truly citrusy and nicely carbonated, the drink is as quaffable an APA/AIPA (or whatever) as I've come across. Truly excellent."
"Drinkability: Another solid brew from Founders, and a really good wet-hopped ale - quite a way to celebrate the harvest. Alcohol's undetectable and only 6.5%, definitely enhancing drinkability. The stickiness is great, the mouthfeel soft and smooth, and the combination of hop oils - though lighter than many harvest ales (the SN is coming to mind) - is very pleasant and enjoyable. Pick up a four-pack of this one next season (as I imagine the hop glory is already starting to fade fast this season)."
"This is a truly refreshing hop based ale that offers some unique flavor combinations. It is a pleasant mix of tart and sweet with plenty of citrus. Caramel isn't noted but the beer draws sweetness form fruit flavors. Enjoyable!"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. big hoppy flavour aroma. if the carbonation was dropped a little this one would be great, but even as is it's pretty darn good."
"Pours a cloudy yellowish amber, pineapple juice colour, thick white head forms, great retention and drops a ton of lace chunks on the glass, very solid layer sticks around. Smell is great, very fresh and hoppy, a ton of pine and grapefruit, floral, pineapple, grainy, caramel, apricots, orange peel, very resiny and fresh. Taste is similar, pineapple and caramel, alcohol, pine, thick sugary malts, wheat, some floral, grapefruit finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Very fresh tasting, very hoppy nose, resiny, pretty damn nice. Good thing I have one at home! Thanks Russ!"
"Bright gold pour, good sized white head. Rather bubbly looking. Smell of grass, grain, hop pine. Mouthfeel is nice and not overly carbonated. Solid citrus, pine, with some malt and biscuit that makes this a pleasant surprise. Very solid, crisp and refreshing. Where was this when I finished mowing the lawn this summer? I think this would be better as a Spring release named something else."
"I love Founders, but I think I only like this beer. Still, it's quite nice and I'll plan on getting more next year."
"D: This is a drinkable, well-made beer, though not my favorite Founders. Still, a refreshing, lively brew."
"12oz bottle, from Capone's (Norristown, PA). Pours clear golden, capped with a large, frothy white head. Crisp grapefruit hop aroma, with some grassy notes, and a minimal amount of malt in the background. Flavor begins with caramel malt for an instant, then grapefruity and earthy hops hit the palate. The hops are not overly aggressive, and stick around for a lengthy finish. Decent example of the style."
"This offering was really good and is another solid contribution to the beer scene made by Founders. It didn't wow me though."
"I feel like I'm overrating it...I like it. But it's a far cry from stuff like Great Divide's Fresh Hop Harvest Ale."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one down quickly. Sessionable pale ale."
"Drinkability- This is definitely one of juiciest brews I've ever tried. It's not overly fruity per se, but it is juicy. Can't really explain it I guess. Fantastic Wet-Hopped brew that is #2 on my list of Harvest Ales right behind Broodoo. Glad that I finally found this and can't wait to polish off the other 3!"
"If you like IPA or aggressively hopped styles you must sample this Ale if you can get your hands on it - highly recommended!"
"D- This is a real nice drinker. I could easily have more than one at a time. It's strong hop flavor would also make it a nice one to cap off a multiple beer tasting. I'd definitely drink it again."
"What a tremendous wet hopped beer! This should be the standard. A diificult effort while working with fresh wet hops, Founders has again achieved greatness. This beer is more like a fresh resiny tea of hops than anything else I've tasted. This is a notch better than the Great Divide."
"Deeelightful"
"I'm reminded of Surly with this beer, in that it's not a ""big beer"" by most definitions, but possesses humongous flavor (btw, this bottle says 6.5%). By far my favorite ""American pale ale," but I wonder if it should even be compared to those many others? They're obviously going for something a bit more intense here. Nevertheless, Founders has yet to disappoint. I raise my glass in celebration of their distribution having finally reached North Carolina. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel was zestier than on tap."
"Unfortunately this one was only picked up as a single. Very enjoyable. Would really like another right about now."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with an enormous white head that goes vertical still after passing the rim of the glass. Big nose of fresh fruity hops, lots of piney/citrus juiciness as well as some strawberry and melon notes, very nice. Big hop flavor as well, 70 IBUS packs a very large punch when the freshness of the hops put on display. Its not overly bitter either just lots of clean, grassy hops for you to drool over. Light and crisp medium body, very well carbonation and quaff-able i had 2 before dinner last night and wished i had more in the fridge! I highly recommend for the the hop heads!"
"D- This is a very refreshing brew and is not hard to drink at all in spite of its heavy hop presence"
"Aromas of fresh hops run wild on this brew great pine and citrus smell filled my nose. The flavor is lighter than the nose suggests a good APA for sure. Easy drinking light and crisp on the tongue. With the flavors of light pine and sweet malts keeping this APA on track flavor wise. Good drinkability I could kick back a few of these with little effort."
"Poured into a pint glass a very hazy golden color with plenty of frothy white head that almost rolled out the top of the glass. Excellent head retention as I let this one sit around for a few minutes, and it died down very slowly. Aroma is spicy hoppy experience with plenty of fresh grapefruit, and pine. Absolutely perfect smell. Taste is very balanced with a piny spicy backbone. This one is full bodied and a nice sticky mouth feel. This is one of my faves I have had in a long while."
"only one vice , and thats with the bottle... its a screw off top... cmon founders lets go pop off.."
"D- Very tasty something Ill buy again probably wouldn't session cause it would kill my taste buds after any more than two."
"Pours with a HUGE frothy white head with plenty of stick. Body is a golden haze with orangish highlights. Scents of sweet grapefruit dominate the citrusy nose. Sweet caramel notes peek through a bit. Big citric hoppiness and phenols in the taste. Honey-like quality similar to hopslam. mmm juicy leafy hops. Decent carbonation, but a touch too much for my taste. My second taste of Founders (other being breakfast stout), and I am still impressed. The only drawback is that it is somewhat one-dimensional, the hops taking the show."
"The body is moderate and very easy to drink. Carbonation is a bit light. Kind of shocked at the ABV, truthfully. Overall a good beer but I would like more distinct flavors and nose. Drinkability is great though."
"Overall, I might try this beer again when next it's released, but I won't be paying $2.39 a bottle for it again this year."
"Hazy golden body. Lemon yellow highlights. A huge whipped head of white froth. Sticky lace is left in abundant qualities. Sweet, fragrant, flowery and citrusy aroma. Very nice and very reminiscent of Two Hearted Ale. Tasting this really takes me back. This is the closest experience I've had tasting a hoppy beer to the first time I sampled Two Hearted Ale in my basement bar 12 years ago with ZAP and Senior Shit. I'm just gonna take a guess that the hops for this bad boy are Centennial. It has that sourdough like malt and yeast contribution as the base. A little funky in that way.T he hops splash accents of orange marmalade, tangerine and grapefruit. The bitterness is not overboard, even though the bottle claims 70 IBUs. Carbonation is a bit overboard. Almost like some secondary reaction occurred that was not intended. But luckily it didn't impart any noticeable off flavors. This is pretty good. Solid. Nothing more though. And even though it reminds me of the first time I had Two Hearted, this is not Two Hearted."
"At an ABV of 6.5%, this is a dangerously drinkable ale; perhaps that is why it only comes in four packs."
"Mouth feel is fairly light , but quite lively due to the spicy nature of the beer. If you like fresh hops you have to try this beer."
"This is a get-me-another bitter APA."
"All and all it is a very tasty brew (wouldn't expect anything less from Founder's)"
"D - extremely tasty and extremely easy to drink."
"M/D: Nice, medium-bodied and highly drinkable. Ample carbonation and dryness, bringing you back for more! Well done, Founders folks! Great example for it's fresh hop style."
"Very attractive hazy dark straw color with a big frothy head and gobs of lacing. This beer looks perfect. It smells of malt and citrusy hops. This beer taste more complex than it smells - lots of orange pith and tropical flavors with a good malt backbone. Lighter bodied which works great with its crisp, easy drinking style. This beer is dangerously drinkable - nice stuff from Founders that I will be buying again."
"scooped a single from Grapes & Hops in Fayetteville, NC"
"12 ounce bottle, 6.5% ABV on label. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy light orange/yellow color with a huge (about 2 1/2 inch) frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops, I smell grapefruit, pineapple and a bit of peach. There's also some pine and grassy hops noticable too. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all citrusy, pine and grassy hops. Both the aroma and taste is good and hoppy, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick/oily with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very enjoyable to drink. It wouldn't be hard at all to finish a 4 pack of this. Overall I think this is a good brew, I'd definitely pick this up again."
"Not my favorite of the style, but a quality, tasty product from Founders."
"This is a great fresh hop ale. It's a good choice if you want the hop character of an IPA without the bitterness. Actually, thanks to the wet hopping, the hop character in this beer is better than in most IPAs. This is my first Founders beer (we don't get them here in VA), and it definitely makes me want to try more of their stuff. Anyway, a solid beer, and one that I'd recommend to any hop enthusiast."
"I like this a lot. Fresh-hoppy to the max."
"D: This is a pleasant treat. Kind of like a strong IPA that's a tad shy on the malt flavor, though the malt pronounces itself more as the beer warms. I'm not sure this is a brew you'd want to drink all night, but tasty as a starter."
"D: This beer has a lot to offer, very complex, a very different animal than a dry hopped beer, almost like wine, but with more carbonation of course. A beer worth returning to and a beer to covet when fresh, just a tad too acidic to be perfect but an otherwise joy to drink."
"D - I was expecting more of a one-dimensional brew, but was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of this harvest ale. This has an intriguing blend of aromas and flavors that kept me interested throughout the entire glass. Very unique and nicely done."
"D: This is a really refreshing drink that I could drink several of and not get bored."
"When you look at this beer in the bottle, you will see a light haze. As you pour this ale, you can't help but smell the fresh hoppy aroma. Everything about this beer feels fresh. It is enjoyable on every level of the experience. It leaves a tail that makes you want more."
"D: Subtlety is not what this beer is about when it comes to hops. It's not bad, but to my palate, some more balance would benefit this beer greatly."
"More like an IPA than a pale ale in my opinion, but it's still a damn fine beer."
"D: This is a hoppy clean and crisp drinking harvest."
"Great to finally try this beer,poured into a standard pint glass a hazed light golden with a frothy one finger white head.Awesome aromas of you guessed it fresh citric and and piney hop with a touch of sweetish biscuit.Fresh hops jump on the palate,fresh grapefruit and lemon pith with underlying pine needle,a firm slightly sweet malt base is there as well keeping everything in tune.Man I love this brew its fresh hop taste is awesome,my fridge beer for the time being."
"This is one of the best American pale ales I've had. Refreshing and delightful. This is masterful craft beer."
"Drinkability would be so darn High if I could get my hands on 50 cases of this stuff!"
"This is a very drinkable beer, and I could easily have more than just a few."
"One of my favorite harvest brews!"
""
"This is one of the best wet-hopped IPAs that I've ever tasted. If only hops could be harvested and made into wet hop ales all year long."
"Overall this may be the best fresh hop beer I have ever had. It reminds me almost of the Two Hearted by Bells which is a huge compliment in both appearance and nose. Wow, such a great, great beer. I wish they made this all year long. My opinion of Founders just keeps getting better and better."
"A very gentle pour produces a massive head that took a good five minutes to settle down before I could pour the rest of the beer into my pint glass. This golden yellow beer left sheets of lacing on the walls of my glass as well with staying power for the entire beer. The nose on this beer is hop oils all the way with varying scents of citrus and pine, and I also get more and more earthy undertones as the beer warmed. The flavor profile starts with a big rush of citrus flavor with bitter pine coming in quite quickly and just a touch of pale malt to balance out the hop flavors. The mouthfeel is slick and oily with medium carbonation with no alcohol present on the mouthfeel. The drinkability is very good on this beer and I probably could have killed my only four pack of this last night, but I am at least going to try to make them last through this month."
"A very solid beer all-around and a hop lovers delight. Founders is one of my favorite breweries where I have yet to sample a poor offerig. Pick up one of these four packs and I hope to see more of this in the future."
"Balanced very well, smooth and extremely drinkable, this harvest ale from Founders went down very well, IMO it blows their Centennial IPA out of the water. Cheers."
"It was gravity dispensed b/c the hand pull was not working properly. Same as tap but I felt it was a lot smoother, I think I was a little on the warm side which helped in tasting all the different flavors. I enjoyed it much more from the cask than tap."
"D: couldn't stop"
"The Drinkability was quite good. I had just one of them (hey, they had 19 beers on tap!) but it was a good way to start the night. It gave me a hop fix, but didn't burn me out."
"This drinks quite well with decent balance...for a truck rolling @ 70 IBUs, that is..."
"Founders has crafted an excellent Pale Ale and I am very happy to have been able to try this one and I will certainly purchase it again. If this were available year round I would always have it in my fridge. Most definitely recommended."
"Huge thanks to Warriorsoul for this gem! Poured inot a tulip. Pours a hazy dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Little lacing. Smell is the winner!! Extremely pungent aroma of stinky weed. Some citrus in there as well. It is absolutely killer! Wonderful bitter flavor. Lots of grapefruit, some lemon, and some pine. Just wonderful. Perfect beer for a hophead like me. Absolutely lovin this beer fresh!"
"Lately Fresh Hop Ales have been disappointing me somewhat, but I figured that if any brewery would impress me with theirs, it would be Founders. This Pale Ale poured a hazy golden color, with an average sized head...did not last very long, and eventually became a white lace...pretty pedestrian so far. Smelling this one right out of the bottle, I could tell I had something interesting. This one is busting at the seams with grapefruit and resiny hop smells. Pine, earth and more citrus also come to mind, but the hops are dominating. Tasting this beer is like turning the volume up on an amp to ten suddenly. The burst of hop flavor sort of rises on the palate, but tones down just as quickly. Again, the hops play the biggest part. The size of this beer is a notch or two above light, making it a good session brew. I should have gone for the four pack instead of the single with this beer. Rates amongst the top of the pack for fresh hop ales I have encountered. So much hop flavor, most IPA's and DIPA's pale in comparison. Cheers"
"packaged uniquely, just a plain white 4 pack with a sticker stuck on it. it looks good, has a huge white frothy head, its like a pure white cloud of awesomeness. color of the beer is a pale golden color. the smell is awesome, just wonderful piney hops are most dominate with sweetness also dominate. taste is really good, just a wonderful blend of hops and some light sweet maltiness. mouthfeel is great. just a really good beer, i'm fairly confident that founders can do no wrong."
"A nice APA from Founders. Sit down and have a few."
"The mouth feel is light and crisp. The carbonation really works for this beer, making easy to enjoy, while it does not fill. This will be a refreshing beer on ht days!! While I agree this is a bit tame for Founders, it is still a nice beer. Crisp, well balanced and tasty."
"In all, aged excellently"
"D: This a very light, crisp drinkable APA and a great beer for a hot summer in Georgia. Recommended."
"While Founders Harvest Ale grew immensely on me near its end it is all considered an average offering - especially for this brewery! I was at first a little disappointed by the fact that this isn't a hop-gloating, palate-violating hop bomb. I soon asked myself 'Why?'. It's not hard to appreciate this offering as being a well balanced, soft-spoken pale ale. Indeed, while the hops weren't in-your-face huge, they still made for a distinctive character. This was pleasant."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a cloudy hazy golden color ale with a huge white foamy head with perfect retention and no lacing. Aroma of bitter and citrus hops with some interesting floral notes. Taste is a mix between some floral hops notes with a bitter and citrus finish with some malt presence. Full body with limited filtration and good carbonation. Another fine ale from a brewer who consistently amaze me."
"This one is quite nice. Mouthfeel is a bit odd and this is not a typical APA but quite a treat. Thanks to jaustin for this..."
"As another reviewer mentioned, a light bodied beer probably great for a hot day. Refreshing. I am unsure if it is intended to have a bit more hop kick and my particular bottle had been aged too long, but I still enjoyed it."
"Pours a golden wheat amber orange in color body. It hosts an inch of off white foamy fuzz with decent staying power. Nose is a hoppy citrus freshness with a backround of oily mineral notes. On first sip you get a super juicy hop presence that is bursting with fresh orange and mellon rind. This is a very refreshing style of beer, it would be wonderful on a hot summer day. With the well hidden 7% alchol it has enough backbone to stand up but is just sessionable enough. Mouthfeel is realatively clean but does include a nice soft bitter richness hue on the mouth. Very drinkable and not the bop bomb that I might expect from a wet hop ale."
"I liked it so much I went and grabbed a case of it for myself."
"Pours cloudy orange with a bright white medium sized head. Smell is sweet orange and caramelly malt with a lively citrusy and fresh hop character. Taste is a bit of a muted, dull, malt with a citrusy orange like hop character. Mouthfeel was about average, and neither thin nor thick. Pleasant and mild hop flavor and bitterness overall. Nice, but I'm unable to tell that this is a fresh hop beer, and don't get that spicy, tingly hop flavor I get in some others. Still, a quality beer that I really enjoyed and am glad I got to try. Thanks for the awesome bonus, Andrew!"
"D- Not a huge fan of the type of hop they used to get all the fruits out of it. Still a good beer but seems like they could make something close to this year-round."
"D: Tremendously drinkable, with all the flavor of a double but the abv that callows you to go through many with no worries. Earthiness and grassiness from the wet hops make this a true treat."
"This was a very nice one. I drank this so fast I barely had time to review it. This is one fine tasting and perfectly drinkable beer! Mouthfeel and carbonation were very nice. Long, smooth, hop flavored finish."
"Goes down far too smooth, but that's par for the course with Founders."
"Pours a light golden color with a nice inch of head. Smell is nice ""green"" hops. Plenty of the citrusy and some piney hops. Taste is much the same, but this beer is incredibly balanced and a real smooth drinker. Refreshing and an easy drinker. This is a good beer."
"Drinkability is WAY too high. Except for the fact that by it's very nature, this beer will never be an early summer beer, I could see sitting out on the boat, sipping this throughout the afternoon, and getting into a LOT of trouble. I'm sure the fish would be twice their original size, in my versions of the tales..."
"D- This could be an easy session beer. This is the second beer i've had from founders and the second one I enjoyed."
"D-Wonderful...my most favorite harvest beer of 2007 (so far). As said...more ""hoppy"" than others....not so grassy...I like this variation more."
"Taste is fantastic. It actually does taste like ""wet hops"". Light citrusy flavor is simple with hop bitterness. I could drink 12 of these. The taste does not give away its 7% ABV tastes like it would be 5% at most. A great refreshing pale ale for those that do not want a bitter hop bomb."
"Much thanks to the pimpp!"
"Another wonderful brew from the magicians at Founder's who can do no wrong, IMO. A great IPA/hop harvest ale, besting many other stabs at the genre."
"Man do I love harvest beers! While this one is good, I wouldn't say it is the top one out there, but as usual, Founders can be relied upon. Pours golden with a decent head that settles to a ring. Aromas of apricot, orange marmalade, and a slight herbalness. Taste is similar, but with more subdued apricots, slightly more herbal, and with a bubblegum finish. Soft mouthfeel and super easy to drink. Delicious!"
"not bad for an over hopped usa ale."
"Overall: Not the best IPA in the world, but one that is an easy drinker nonetheless. My brother picked this one up for me as an extra little gift when purchasing the wonderful seasonal midwest brews. I'm happy he sent it as I enjoyed it, it will help me get thru the winter when there seems to be a lack of good IPA's here in Florida."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer presents with a medium body. The hops are fairly oily in a good way. The beer is an easy drinker. I would easily reccomend this beer to hop lovers."
"revisited this and was pleasantly surprised. huge, dense, rocky head that persists. golden yellow in color. the use of the paler malts in this really allows it to show off the fresh hops. wonderful aromas of honeyed, bready, flowery citrus, with the lemony and orangey citrus standing out. frothy in the mouth- just a bit of bready malts and a wonderfully smooth hop bitterness; balanced towards the latter. very well carbonated which gives it a crisp, lively mouthfeel, leaving me to want to drink this way faster than i should. very drinkable, i'd have someone unfamiliar with ipa's give this a shot."
"First off let me say that this is an excellent beer. It is everything a pale ale should be - balanced, hoppy, malty, and citrusy. Cloudy pale yellow in appearance with an aroma that is dominated by pine and citrus. There is definitely some floral notes in the aromoa as well. The taste is tart & bitter with a very clean, dry finish. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonated perfectly. I could drink this stuff constantly. This gives Two Hearted Ale a run for its money. Highly recommended."
"A very solid offering from Founders, one of my favorite American breweries."
"D - This is a good beer that is very drinkable. The big flavor assaults the taste buds so my limit would be one per sitting."
"Pours a murky burnt straw with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is pretty minimal, a bit here and there, but not much. Smell is very light and refreshing. Sweet citrus hops with a big white bread scent. Very light evergreen aroma with a bit of wet sawdust in the nose as well. Musty pine up front with some sour grapefruit flavors too. Pale malt and wheat tastes emerge midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is subtle and floral with some grassy notes. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a somewhat distracting carbonation. A fairly solid beer, but there are definitely better wet hop ales out there."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, carbonation is excellent, and very, very smooth. Extremely drinkable. 6.1% is perfect for this beer and adds to its drinkability. Overall, this is excellent."
"It may not be the perfect session beer, but it tries to be. I really enjoyed this and will save some for the warmer months."
"Drinkability is limited due to the thin body that simply cannot support the bitterness and the lack of malt presence to balance out the hop flavors. Not too bad, I guess, but i wish i had been drinking sierra nevada harvest ale instead."
"I was worried that the hop freshness may have started to die out in this one allready but was pleasantly surprised to see them holding up quite well. It's not quite up there with some of the other top Harvest Ales but is quite servicable and drinkable for the style."
"Drinkability: A decent beer, just notr my favorite of the harvest ales."
"Pours a cloudy, yet sunshiney yellow amber hue. Very hazey, but exploding with carbonation. Very thick foam of hea and sticky lacing. Just awesome. The aroma is exploding with a sunshines burst of fresh hops that hnt at pine and a flowerfield right nxt to a grapefruit grove. The taste starts of quickly with some rye like mals, but then swifty moves to the hops. Lots of citrusy ad grassy uv rays hitting the tongue. Complex biterness that slowly fades away. Very good APA, but better for indulgence than sessions."
"This beer is really damn easy to drink."
"This beer screams out of freshness to me. The fresh wet hops rule and I am glad I drank it when i did. Really need to get some more. Great beer."
"A slight biscuit flavour, muted fruitiness, and plenty of American hop notes round it off at the end. Medium bodied, somewhat slick (from the fresh hop oils?) and moderately carbonated."
"d: Could easily go through a 4 pack on a summers day. Just wished the hops could stick around to see the sun."
"Very bright, somewhat hazy yellow color. Odd for a pale ale it is such a bright yellow but it works. Deep grassy aroma. Full malty flavor with a great bitter blast. Slight citrusy flavor. Damn nice body. Very full-somewhat sweet in the finish. This is one of those beers I find myself wanting to gulp. Between the body and flavor I cant get enough. Damn enjoyable."
"Easy to drink, enjoyable and balanced pale ale."
"As a big fan of this brewery's beers, I didn't even know this one existed until I was perusing the Friar Tucks beer store. I picked up a 4 pak, that was extremely over priced. I poured into my Sam Adams special glass. First thought was, my it is a bit on the cloudy, chewy side. I either attribute this to being bottle conditioned or due to the hop fragments from ""wet hopping"". Great APA aroma, the usual citrus notes. I noticed that there was hardly any head to it, so I was anticipating a thin mouth feel. First sip was good and reminiscent of most APA's, nothing outstanding, but still very drinkable. Nice bitterness backed up by a decent malt bill, almost biscuity. Very light in color so if there is any crystal malt, its definitely on the low end of the Lovibond scale. A very drinkable beer but I think I prefer their Centennial IPA."
"Golden color with lots of floaters. Minimal head and no lacing. Smell is fresh hops, very floral and citrusy and even fills in with some piney notes for good measure. Taste is typical pale ale malty and biscuit flavors with a little more hops than normal. Taste is a little bit of a let down after the strong smell. Mouthfeel is a little oily. A nice beer from a quality brewer."
"Overall, like the flavor, but carbonation needed to be picked up a bit. I have a second bottle to try, and I will see if that is any different. Not bad, but plenty of other nice, hoppy ales out there."
"Another great beer from Founders, wish they would distribute in California, recommended if it is still on the shelves"
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Heavier texture and not as crisp as expected. Juicy and somewhat gelatinous in texture. Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation. Different and well done. I haven't been terribly fond of many of the recent wet hopped beers, but I enjoyed this one very much."
"What a great time of year for beer, all these wet hopped ale, plus winter seasonals, and gift packs, tough choices at the liquor store these days."
"Very nice wet hopped pale ale. Actually reminds me a bit of the Sierra Nevada Harvest fresh hop ale. Well worth seeking a bottle of this out."
"Pours a hazy golden tangarine with a finger of soapy white head that dies to a ring. Very big citrus hops in the nose. Earthy, grassy and a little pinapple like sweet malt smell. Taste starts of big hops but quickly becomes mild and balanced with a nice balance and refreshing finish. Crisp and refreshing in the mouth and a session beer for sure. Im impressed."
"Of all the 'wet hop' beers from this season, I enjoyed this the most. Very easy drinking."
"Overall- Let this 1 warm up a bit. The flavor really popped near the end of the glass. Definitely recommended for a hop lover like myself."
"A well made APA. Flavor profile is very unified and lacking in any harsh hop bitterness. Mild and easy to drink."
"drinkability: good"
"What stands out here is the overall impression from this brew: the length of flavors across the tongue, and the long, biting aftertaste are impressive. It's a strong showcase for the beauties of the hop. This is a significant, fall brew...perfect to whet the appetite before Thanksgiving dinner."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, and is a nice showcase of fresh hops, although I'd like something a little more malt-centric eventually, and thus a change of taste after two or so."
"D - Good pale, but not the most exciting Harvest Ale I've tasted. The hops seemed to lack some of the different fruit/aromatics that I was looking for.Still very good though."
"This beer is the reason that their is a hop shortage. Yet it is balanced very well with the malt"
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with less than a full finger fluffy white head that resists fading. A good amount of lacing present. The smell is really nice a great balance of roasty malt and fresh hopped pine and citrus. So far neither the appearance nor the smell is what i would expect from a APA...but as Jessica Simpson would say ""but i woneit"". Highly carbonated, the mouth feel is tangy and bright. Full flavored, the taste is bright and citrusy as well. A real nice drinker. Thanks, Pops!! While it waivers from style...Its a real celebration!!!"
"Another good brew from Founders. I've had quite a few of these this year and for some reason they're either hit or miss. They don't miss by much but they miss the mark of the better bottles. After my next few bottles I will update review if need be."
"Doesnt hold a candle next to a Sierra Nevada Harvest ale."
"d: While this was enjoyable, I doubt I'll buy anymore. Certainly worth trying and I'm glad I did. This is only the second wet-hopped beer I've tried and SN's Harvest Ale is far superior."
"Overall, a very good APA, at a very good double IPA price."
"D: This should be illegal."
"Good body, carbonation keeps things fairly clean. Bitterness lingers for a while. Well done."
"Pours a hazy golden color. A nice thick head settles quickly to some sticky lacing around the edges on my pint glass. Smells of citrus orange and grapefruit hops. Taste of some light pine, juicy grapefruit and balanced with some sweet malt. Some green leaf appeared as it warmed. Not complex, kind of simple in flavor. But never the less, very delicious. Mouth feel is light and has a nice carbonated fizz to it. Overall drinkability is very good. I like this one. Has enough going on to enjoy many through out the night. Recommended!"
"12 oz stubby. The beer is an oranged straw color with a 3 finger white head over top that is maintained by a massive stream of bubbles in the brew. The clarity on this one is moderate at best. The aroma is full of dank citrusy hop that are tempered by an orange fruityness and a spicy pepperyness. The caramel is towards the back in this one and the green quality is not apparent. The flavor is a little less hoppy than expected. The first flavor to hit is a vegetative citrus hop with an earthy bite to it. The orange and light caramel come through in the finish. This one just feels a little wanting to me, which is in stark contrast to the tap version I had last year. Moutfeel is moderate with a very light carbonation. Overall, this one is very drinkable with pretty good flavor. The mouthfeel is a little light on carbonation making it just a little less active than I was hoping. I know it is too early for this one to be on the down slope, but it just feels like it is not all it is meant to be. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but nothing like the tap version from last year or the previous harvest ale from another company I just sampled."
"D- This beer is a nice IPA. It is not a huge hop monster but it has nice flavor with a unique flavor to the hops. This is a nice session beer."
"Pours a dark hazy orangish yellow with a decent white head. The smell is amazing, the hop aroma jumps out. It is very rich and floral, very distinct as if the hops are still floating in the glass. The taste follows suit, very rich with the hops without the bitter bite seen in heavily hopped beers. This could be from this beer being wet hopped. It is also somewhat sweet, with a hoppy aftertaste that lingers. The mouthfeel is smooth, good balance in the characteristics. This beer is easy to drink, the hops aren't overpowering, but this is for the hopheads. This is one of my favorite pale ales. Enjoy."
"Thanks to Dan at South Bend City Wide Liquors for letting me know this had come in (along with Backwoods Bastard...mmmm). Pours straw to orange colored with little suspended sediment throughout and a tiny bubble head that settles to a thin film. I love it. Smells citrusy and delicious. Almost smells like a ripening fruit. Flavor is great. I'm not really as much as a hophead as I used to be, primarily because of how one-dimensional some of the big hoppy beers can be when they're not made well, but beers like this remind me why I was a hophead...and why, when well used, hops are so important to a beer. Here, they are the main feature and donate a strong, mediumly-bittered grapefruit and grass flavor on top of a slightly creamy malt body. Its a great tasting beer...subtle in its attack, but extremely well-constructed."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and solid carbonation. A sturdy pale ale that brings a wealth of flavor while at the same time being quite drinkable and refreshing. This is a darn tasty wet hopped brew and I'm glad to see this in bottles. Get on it and try this one while you can. Another solid brew from Founders."
"D - Very good APA. Great smell, and if I can smell it, it's got to be strong. I could have 3 of these a week."
"D- This is a pretty good fresh hop beer. I actually enjoy how simple this is."
"Overall this brew is smelly in a good way (thanks bassmantin). It's hops in liquid form. Get it!!!!"
"D- This is my first wet-hopped ale and it didn't quite meet my expectations. The hops are prominent and good, but I feel like the recipe might need some tweaking to improve the strength of the taste and the heat of the alcohol."
"A modestly light bitterness on the finish and mid palate and lacking the big citrus profile the nose suggested. More cereal grainy, toffee flavors come through than hop. A bit green with more stone fruit than citrus. Nectarine with zippy acicdity and carbonation. Finish is suprisingly lengthy. A beer that goes down very easy and has a real honesty too it that really makes this drinkable."
"D: Easily drinkable and very tasty."
"2010: Lacks the fresh hop punch that distinguishes harvest ales. Not one i'd scramble to find, but would drink it if available."
"Hazy, apricot-orange body with golden edges and a thick, creamy, glass-crawling beige head. Huge fresh hop nose. Pungent, resinous, oily, and herbal. Some citrus and pine in there too. Pineapple and caramel cookie malt aroma in the background. light toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness up front. Becomes more citrusy and soon explodes into juicy pineapple, powdered sugar malt sweetness, and, of course, resinous hop goodness. Good balance of numbing fresh hop bitterness and sugary malt in the long finish. Medium-bodied with a creamy feel. Very even and smooth carbonation. Delicious and I'm really glad to see this bottled!"
"Run out and grab one while you can. If you can."
"A nice quenching brew that fits better in the summer on a nice hot day. Easy to drink, smooth and tasty."
"I am glad I snagged this beer. I could easily find myself marveling at the entire grouping of bottles in one sitting, however tonight I am going to exercise restraint and save some for future enjoyment. Try this one. A powerful hops experience without any rough edges."
"Overall: A decent seasonal special by Founders, but not one of my favourites."
"for hop lovers this beer is a go. A seasonal brew and worth getting a hold of if you can. Great beer, very fresh and rewarding to say the least"
"On tap at brewpub. Wonderful grapefruit and grass smell and taste. Light brown in color. Lighter and sharper than IPA, with thinner body. This they should bottle! $3.50/pint or $5 including glass is reasonable. Limited time release and not available in bottles."
"Just released to the public for the first time yesterday. I had a couple of these among a few other beers at the HarvestFest party last night. I wasnt sure what style of beer it was supposed to be and was not able to talk much to anyone working there as the place was jam-packed. Fresh from the tap it had a nice copper color and good head retention. It tasted like a somewhat mild version of a pale ale. Brewed with the freshest hops (less than 24hrs off the vine), and you can taste it. A clean, fresh hoppy taste throughout. Maybe a little dry in the finish. I noticed a few citrus flavors, but nothing overpowering. It was somewhat difficult to really pull much of an aroma out of the glass, but I'll blame most of that on the atmosphere. The mouthfeel was maybe a little on the light side, but not watery by any means. Drinkability was great, I could have stayed and downed these all night if only my wallet was a little thicker. I'd like to try this one again soon. I wonder if they're bottling it or if its only available on tap?"
"I had quite a few of these last night at Founder's Harvest Party where they brought out this new beer. I would say it lies somewhere between the Centenial and the Dry Hopped in terms of hoppiness. But the hops here take a really nice dimension and the malts seem to sit back. The malt base is honeyish but not really sweet at all but slightly toasty. It's just there to prevent the hops from being too much. The hop flavor is strong from the beginning and lasts throughout the finish. There is some bitterness but moreso hoppiness with flavors of grapefruit, orange rinds, and estery notes. I don't think this was dry hopped but I could be wrong. Goes down very easily, the body is on the lighter side, but to me is the ultimate session beer."
