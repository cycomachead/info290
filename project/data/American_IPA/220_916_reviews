"Possibly my absolute favorite IPA"
""
""
"Very clear, tea color. Head runs away pretty quickly. The smell is a nice touch of citrus bitter and warm floral. The taste is about the same. Very enjoyable. It leaves a very dry and bitter remnant on the sides of the tongue. I'd get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell was tropical and great but the taste was thin and oniony. Pretty disappointed overall."
""
"We had this in a growler (it was a gift) and were surprised how much we liked it (not being IPA fans)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has held up surprisingly well for being a four month old IPA."
""
""
"SO far my favorite single IPA, at 6.2% its very very smooth and has a mellow taste.  I like it alot and its a great price."
""
""
"O: Solid IPA that's a great value at $8.99/sixer. Nothing spectacular, but it's tasty, bottle-dated, and inexpensive…and thus always a good option."
""
""
"Overall - Yet another California Hop Bomb, to be sure. The bitter and the sweet work well together. Nothing too original here but tasty all the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average IPA. Nice hops and a bit buttery in the aftertaste. Tasty but nothing too special."
""
"It's solid. I like it."
"definitely worth more than an 87!"
""
""
"An easy go-to choice in a crowded field of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Deep gold pour with rich off white head. Grass notes. Lite hop flavor. Lite mouthfeel and grassy tongue coating. Easy drinking IPA."
""
""
"I have no clue as to whether the character changes completely whether it's brewed in CA or in IL as I assume I'm getting it living in PA (enough abbreviations for you?) but it's solid if not exemplary."

"Simple but well made ipa. Very drinkable and widely available."

"pretty standard IPA but it's common and reliable. Something I'll take at a bar that doesn't have a great selection without drinking an adjunct or random subpar IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Minimal head.light lacing.clear Amber color with carbonation of bubbles floating upward .a nice hoppy finish..Prost"
"O: Overall I like this beer.  This would go well with pub fare no doubt so order them nachos!!!"
""
""
""
"This is a very nice IPA and for the price (about $16 for a 12 pack) it's a home run!"
"Absolute garbage, and so well distributed that it's always in your face.  A generic northern california IPA that is in every bar and every convenience store, but is actually a watery worthless ale.  I'm literally disappointed every time someone buys this.  A bland, filler beer that you might drink just to get drunk and not seem like a cheapskate for drinking PBR.  Avoid if you can."
""
"Pours reddish golden clear liquid with white foam head with almost no retention. Smells fruity, citrusy, flowery, fresh. Tastes very balanced bitterness with malt sweetness. More hops in the after taste. Feels low body with low carbonation. Overall a good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yummy yummy yummy, tastes good"
""
""
"A gloriously balanced, highly quaffable IPA.  It is truly luxurious on the palate and one sip begets another.  Also, its James McMurtry's favorite beer and he's one of the best musicians and songwriters, period.  So you should drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22 oz bottle to glass. Moderate hoppy scent with the usual west coast IPA pine/grassy undercurrent aroma. Colour is amber/yellow with light head. Taste like a typical American IPA. Not bad at all, but not special either. Light Mouthfeel goes down smooth. For the price I would have expected a little more bitter flavour and a little higher ABV. But it's still not bad."

"On draft at the Abbey in Providence RI. Nice color and nose, but underwhelming with the overall taste and flavor profile. Nothing wrong, but just average for me. Might also have been that I was expecting more."
"O-Solid IPA, try it."
""
""
"For all the hype I found this very disappointing,  not nearly as bitter as I was led to believe, way too balanced,  kind of like a middle of the road Democrat or centrist Republican -- neither here nor there."
"Bottle of lagunitas ipa drank."
""
""
""
"The only thing holding this beer back is the lack of alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic IPA. No frills beer from a great brewer."
"This isn't a bad beer but I don't see why I'd choose it over the great IPA options that we get in the PNW unless it was a really great deal and I needed a budget option, but it actually tends to be a little on the costly side."

"Overall: I would say this is a great beer by Lagunitas, but not as awesome as their Lil’ Sumpin’ Sumpin’ variety. This Lagunitas IPA is a nice go-to beer if you can’t find anything stronger or more robust. I found the only negative thing about this beer to be a lack of complexity. I usually look for a well-timed release of a variety of flavors each as strong as the last, but this one is sort of monotonic. Not bad, but just not excellent."

"Smooth and refreshing IPA. Minimal hoppy aftertaste"

""
""
"This is my goto IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a decent beer, nothing special. You can do better with an IPA but it's a great 12 pack."
""
"I really enjoyed this ipa. It is a great go to"
"Unfortunately this IPA has very little character. It's less flavorful and less hoppy than the Lagunitas Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""

"This is almost what I would call a ""light"" IPA.  The flavor is there but it seems like you have to work to get at it.  The color is a very light orange, almost like a Pilsner.  The smell has a light citrus note with a little warm bread in there.  The flavor is mild and fleeting although still fairly good.  Easy to drink.  It's not very complex though which for this style might be an issue.  I dunno.  There are better IPAs out there for sure but this one would work for a person that wants a very light IPA.  I wouldn't buy it again."
"I had it on tap. As someone stated earlier, it's a bit more watery for ipa's I'm used to. The color is a little lighter than most ipa's. I would pass on this if most other ipa's are available on tap. Not the biggest fan"
"Really enjoyed this easy-drinking beer.  The person who said this tastes like a sweaty snatch needs to stop feasting on sweaty snatches because it's affecting his tastebuds."
"Orange body. Orange like hop aroma. Has that signature Lagunitas scent. Hop forward taste, a bit watery, almost like a pale ale. Not that bitter. Again, a slightly watery feel, not the best.  Overall, I'd be happy to see this on tap, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Not bad. Nice amount of bitterness, easy biscuity finish. I can drink a six of these on a nice summer's night. Nothing that I would kill over, but definitely solid."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good I.P.A."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just another IPA. Nothing special."
"prost LampertLand"
"This is a fantastic ""starter"" IPA. Incredibly drinkable, I can't imagine anyone not liking this beer. Everything in balance, not sharp or bitter at all, and not overly citrusy.  If you have a friend who is new to craft beers, serve him this beer."
""
"Taste like an old sweaty snatch"
""
""
""
""
"Very solid IPA, nice flavor, after bite a bit harsh but overall a nice beer. It's in my regular rotation given the price. Nice value."
""
""
"Overall: In terms of UK availability, Lagunitas is one of the American breweries that is most likely to find some kind of representation outside of your typical craft-oriented bottle shop. If you're after a good, solid IPA then this would make a good go-to brew - perhaps not as 'homicidally hoppy' as the bottle blurb would have you believe, but definitely worth it for the sheer variety of the flavour palate. I look forward to trying more of the Lagunitas output."

"Overall there is a reason this beer is a staple ipa, great balance with nice bitter finish, great overall hop profile that doesn't go crazy, very enjoyable and tasty."

"First time I've had Lagunitas IPA, not bad. A very mellow IPA, easy to drink. A good entry level IPA."

"Gets better the more i drink this beer.  So i'll keep buying this beer.  Good job on this one."
"Have only had on tap. Love this brewery. People with a bent I can relate to. They have much better offerings.  It's decent, but not a top notch IPA."
""
"Great tasting beer,smooth hops allover!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: an excellent IPA with a lot of complexity usually found in higher ABV beers."
""
""

""
"Excellent IPA!  A regular purchase on-tap or in bottles.  Just the right amount of bitterness and very balanced..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I see why this one is so popular.  Very sessionable.  Nice doggie."
"Verdict: A very nice IPA from Lagunitas and when fresh, should definitely be a stand by choice. It is quenchable and quite refreshing without being overly bitter and punishing on the palate, definitely one of the better examples of a low IBU but distinctly west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice floral and citrus hop notes."
""
"an always go to beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for the style this one hits well. Don't listen to the haters, drink up!"
"Disgusting pine tree taste that is very much different from most west coast IPAs."
""
""
"This IPA suffers from ""beery beer syndrome"". It's got citrus and hops upfront, but they're light and don't have enough strength or depth to hold the flavor throughout the entire development. This gives you a beer that only has good flavor has soon as you swallow but immediately fades into a basic beer taste like Corona or the like. Not nasty, but not good. Would be a good starter IPA for those new to the style or craft beer in general, but won't impress anyone with any kind of drinking experience."
""
"Despite the generic label this is an exceptional IPA in the lower price range. I really try to keep this in my beer pantry at all times. One very solid product."
""
"Really solid IPA though was not unique and doesn't set it self apart from the pack, which is okay because overall a great enjoyable beer, just not remarkable in my opinion."
"Good IPA, has always been a go to"
"Overall - One of the most well-balanced IPA'S I have had. I really really enjoyed it. I guess your enjoyment depends on what you like in a finish and how persistent its aftertaste is. I thought it was awesome. Cheers!"
""
"O- A really nice and approachable American IPA.  If you are looking to take the plunge into more intense and flavorful craft beer, this wouldn’t be a bad place to start at all.  A really nice go-to IPA as well, as I could see this satisfying more seasoned craft beer drinkers as well as those that are newcomers. (4)"

"Pine-like.. Good IPA, smooth with excellent lacing"
" Great brew! I drink this one a lot and will continue to do so!"
""
""
""
""
"I've had this on draught and remember liking it better than what I'm getting from the bottle. Poured in a traditional ale glass, thin head, clear Amber in color. A lot of grapefruit, some pine. Tastes and feels a little thin, no lingering taste."
"Great smell. Taste not so much"
"Lah goo nee tass! Cheers!"
"uncomfortable feel in my experience"
""
"Unbelievable value for under 10$ a six pack. This is one of my goto IPAs"
""
""
""
"O. Very average ipa. Gets job done for lower abv but would only drink if need a session ipa.  Then again would prefer a dogfish 60 if doing that."

"Having this on tap at The Whip-In. Quite delectable"
""
""

"Great IPAd but a distinctive flavor note I couldn't describe"
""
"12 Oz bottle poured into point glass.   Gold/amber color puts with a 1 inch head. Moderate lacing on glass.   Grapefruit and pine smell.  Hops create a nice yang on the tongue but be is somewhat balanced by malt sweetness. Crisp, dry mouthfeel.   Overall a very good IPA."
"This is a nice refreshing IPA, with hints of citrus within the Hops. This is a beer that is nice to sip on while watching the football game!"
""
""

"Sampled on tap at The Taphouse in Red Deer. This is an extremely enjoyable IPA. Light, citrusy, and outdoorsy (if that makes any sense). I found this to be a balanced and refreshing IPA - I would not hesitate to pick up another!"

"Wow, lagunitas never Dissapoints. Readily available & high quality. I live in Indiana where 3 Floyds is most people's sought after brew. Lagunitas brew is always both easier to get ahold of, cheaper, and just as good if not better. This beer tastes nearly the same as gumballhead, however slightly more grapefruit than citrus. Smooth, all day drinking kind of beer or session. I can't think of any occasion or season this wouldn't be good. Awesome citrus/grapefruit taste, kind of a bready orange peel nose. Taste doesn't linger or coat the mouth, something that I look for in all beers, and leaves you wanting more after each taste. I thought I liked lil sumpin', but this is smoother and you don't get that alcohol Taste at the end like lil sumpin'. 10/10 in my book."

"My go to draft IPA because a lot of bars around me carry it on draft and I thoroughly enjoy it.  Big hop nose and great hop flavor with being overpowering.  I like the dry finish and love how I don't get sick of the taste even though it comes in at 6.2% and is quite hoppy. Will gladly enjoy on any occasion....yes please.  Salute."

"O: Excellent - a classic American IPA. Looks lovely, while the aroma and flavour stun the senses with a hop tsunami. Pine, citrus and caramel malt compete for your attention. Good body. Moreish and highly drinkable; I'm glad I've got more stashed away. A must-try beer."
""
"Had this today on tap, and like many others (two hearted comes to mind) it was much better than bottled. Very hoppy yet clean and crisp. I can see having a sixtel of this in the home bar."

""
""
"Solid ipa"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall:  This beer is a pretty good hop bomb.  Aroma stands out as its best attribute.  If you love a good balance of malt to compliment the bitterness you'll be disappointed with this one.  I wouldn't be disappointed to come home from work to a fridge full of this IPA."

"This beer is widely available, which tends to have a negative impact on the ratings.  I will tell you that this beer is excellent.  Sierra Nevada Pale is widely available and is one of the best pale ales out there.  This is a top 10 IPA.  This is my first IPA and I think one of the  mount rushmore IPA's that opened the floodgates for this category.  What I like best about it is that it is smooth compared to the one sided dominant hop profiles that seem to dominate the landscape to the detriment of the beer.  Yes, I love hops but all hops and no balance does not a beer make.  Lagunitas is delicious and is one of those rare beers that actually taste better from the bottle than on tap.  It is a top 10 IPA.  Nuff said."

"OVERALL: Another Quality Lagunitas Product that I will Recommend to Others and Purchase to Enjoy Again"

"Tap from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours dark gold with white head. Tastes of pine hops up front, followed by a dry and plain finish. Starts off strong and hoppy but ends like a typical and unexciting beer. Could be better."

"Pours a pale yellow with a thin fizzy head. The smell is all pine from the hops and a little bit of toasted smell coming from it. The taste was an initial big  pop from the hops which then mellowed into a very drinkable finish that I thought was quite delicious. The mouthfeel was also very pleasant. Not too thick for an IPA but with a consistent body. I liked this one a lot."
"Very well balanced IPA. I've had hundreds of these over the years. And this beer remains reliably good and drinkable after all that time."

"Lagunitas is a solid starter IPA for those trying to develop a palate for hoppier beers. It's not too exciting, and I probably wouldn't have it again for myself, but might bring a sixer to a party for my friends to try out. Many will also enjoy the 6.2% abv, but you can get Torpedo, which is arguably better and higher in abv, for a dollar cheaper."
""
"Based on Lil Sumpin, decided to try their IPA.  Good, but not as good as Lil Sumpin.  A little too bitter, but without the flavor."
""
"I can't believe over 1000 beers rated, and I haven't had Lagunitas IPA.  Well here goes.  Its listed as June 2014 on the bottome of the bottle, so its already 3-4 months old which is more than I usually will tolerate for IPA purchases.  With that said there is still plenty of hop notes in the smell, nice mix of piney/citrus combo going on.  Taste is very solid and standard classic American IPA.  It's not SUCKS citrus hop slam, but more piney and malt presence.  Mnimal bitter finish.    Overall I find this very solid and respectable.  Would purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""

"Easy to drink and a good dose of carbonation. This comes off well without being over the top with hops. 6.2% is on the low end for an IPA but it still a delicious beer."
""
"A good IPA but not fantastic. It is definitely more of an orange and lemon hoppiness than anything else, decent ABV and a pretty good choice."

"This is a great beer if you want a kinda dull version of sucks and sumpin sumpin. It has the lagunitas signature taste...and a lot of hops...but just not that super citrus defined hops the others have....its still really good just not as good as sumpin or suxks. I call this my quanity over quality brew...when I am low on funds I pick up a 12 pack of this!"

"O:  A good beer.  However, I think I'll stick with the Lagunitas offerings that have more malt. 3.75/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL.  this is a fine IPA and reasonably priced at $4.99 for 22 ounce bomber.  This beer strikes the right balance between malt and hops.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style and would not hesitate to buy this again."
""
""
"This is my go to beer no matter the season. It's clean, goes down easy, and smells great. It's one of the better IPAs I have had it's really dope. I suggest it to anyone looking to step away from store bought light beer and into a really quality beer."

"One of the better IPA's I had in a 12oz bottle. Really impressed by the ""not too dry"" finish. I could go down the list of usual appearance, aroma, etc... but I think all one has to do is read down the list of reviews for any answer they might need."

"I have had this on draft several times, really nice IPA with great depth of flavour, drink anytime."

"Another reliable IPA when nothing else is around. Nice head with hues of brown as it settles. Love the piney woods smell. Permeates the glass and surrounding area. Sticky lacing with good presentation. Light bitterness that seems spicy on the throat at times. Carbonation is barely perceivable. Tasty brew, cheers..."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 8, 2014... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... OCCASION: Camp summer #4 ends; no job for Shan though... APPEARANCE: orange amber body; diminishing, bubbly white head that leas beautifully arching lacing; strong cirrus swaths... AROMA: robust peach and pine cone--orange, melon, pineapple--grainy, demanding malts make this an intense, cagey meeting... PALATE: full-bodied, warming and thick--aggressive on the teeth and tongue; dry enough to slow sips; versatile ... TASTE: evenly balanced; with an intense hop bomb accompanying every sip; the intense pine comb produces ripples of orange, tangerine and mango and repercussions of the most palatably bitter ale ... OVERALL: in a three-way battle with Prism and Heavy Seas for roommate get-together IPA supremacy, Lagunitas asserts a dominant character--an irrepressible combination of drinkability and enjoyability...no doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had..."

"This is a workhorse IPA. While not a special occasion pour, it is worthy as a fridge stocker. A bit more subtle than Stone, a bit more aggressive than Sierra Nevada, it hits a nice balance. A drinkable IPA with enough hop bite to remind you it is indeed an IPA. This is my wife's house beer and there is always one in the fridge."
""
""
""

"Overall: Refreshing, straightforward, IPA. Definitely on the lighter side compared with some of its West Coast peers."

"I’ve had this many times before, but, having just joined the site, I decided to write a review this time. The beer is dated 6/3/14 (about two months old). It pours a straw yellow that borders on copper under certain lighting. The aroma is pleasant with a subtle citrus characteristic, but predominantly earthy resinous hops. The taste has more citrus than the nose would suggest and is full of orange and lemon zest. The beer finishes with a sturdy, resinous hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue for awhile. It is medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation, which suits the style well. Overall, a solid beer. At a reasonable price, it is a nice go-to beer."

"This is one of my staple beers in the frig. A thick head when poured, leaving nice lacing behind. Rich notes of pine and citrus on the nose. A medium-light mouthfeel, with a hint of alcohol on the finish. For hop fans like me, the biting tang left by the hop taste is refreshing."

"My cousin in law sent this one with me to try. Pretty good looking for an IPA, head grabs the glass which I like. It has that wonderful IPA smell, not strong but good. Delicious, as a non-IPA guy I enjoyed this very much, it has some flavor without the bitter aftertaste that I do not care for. An very easy drinking IPA that is not just for hop heads. Would buy, but not first option."

"Nice.  Plenty of hops on a thick base of malt. A little too malty for an IPA in my opinion, but it does make it quite sturdy good for all seasons.  Very tasty. I will to try it on tap somewhere soon. Yes I will have it agsin, over and over. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

"One of the best beers I've ever had! Nice IPA, but not very bitter. Also, the malt is either not too heavy, or its presence is not gross like other malt aspects in other beers that is lemon-like... this beer is Exceptionable! I like a hearty malt presence, as long as it isn't too too thick, or has a bad taste. This beer, if I'm not mistaken, skips the malt, and just lets the hops come through - all without being too bitter."

"The beer has a pale copper body with an inch of white head. Aromas of hops, a touch of citrus (grapefruit, orange), cracker. Hop forward with moderate bitterness mid to late palate. Light in body with a bit of stickiness on the palate. Simple and straightforward. Not one of the better hop offerings I have had from Lagunitas (fresh Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and Sucks are both delicious). Sometimes you eat the bar, sometimes the bar eats you..."
"One of my favorites for years now. Wonderful citrusy pine smell. Nice mouthfeel. better out of a keg, but not bad in a bottle. Hoppy with a good finish. Top 5 IPA in my book. Availability is excellent now that it's been around awhile, it's nice to know that I can get it at my local grocery store and not have to go all over to find it."

"Pours pale brown with thick white head and large carbonation bubbles. Excellent leaving. Smell is typical American IPA with virus strong citrus aroma with a hint of floral. Flavor is pretty much all hops, tastes a bit thin. Pretty good beer, but not sure I'll be buying a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"o. I expected more from this beer. Maybe because of all of the great beers I have had from Lagunitas. This one is not my favorite. Seems like a one trick pony - all hops, no layers or complexity. That being said, it is still better than most."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: A nice IPA, but nothing about it stands out."
""
""
""
""
""
"If only to be certain I wasn't creating an arbitrary set of standards, or , I got myself a Sierra Nevada, also on bottle, directly after. Unctuous, lovely mouthfeel, pine resin galore, balanced sweetness, the same old trusty standard. If it can be done at this size of a commercial level, I see no reason to cut Lagunitas the slack. Too bad."
"O: A really good American IPA. Not as forceful or bitter as some of the more lauded contemporary IPAs, but still very good nonetheless."

"This has a superb balance of the essential IPA characteristics. It's perfectly fruity, bready, and bitter. I'd place it near, if not at the top of, the class of American IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very light amber with nice white head and consistent lacing rings. Has slight carbonation bubbles ascending up the glass. Smells of ripe grapefruit and dried apricots. Taste is much the same. Apricots and dried citrus. Grapefruit. Mostly hop forward with little malt influence. Finishes dry with a dank, resinous hop mouthfeel. Overall, very enjoyable. Would be a good BBQ beer, maybe with some bold BBQ chicken. Cheers."

"This is a very classic IPA. It had a fairly large head when brought to my table. It has crisp citrus flavors, with a little bit of a hop aftertaste. I'm not sure of all the flavors, but they combine to create this delicious IPA that goes great with any type of food"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had the pleasure of visiting the Lagunitas brewery and tap room in Petaluma, CA on several occasions and I do enjoy their beers anywhere I can get them. If you're looking for a quality IPA this will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: I really don't know what it is about this beer but I love to drink it. There is no special flavor that stands out, maybe it is how balanced I find it? Bottom line, I love this beer and rate it higher than most people. I have this Lagunitas a lot and will continue to."

"I have enjoyed this particular beer on both tap and from the bottle. It is on tap at my restaurant so I often pour this guy as my shift beer. It gives a lot of head when serving from the tap however the appearance is remarkable. The golden orange brew smells great and goes down like water. The taste is of course far from water- a nice, hoppy, semi bitter IPA. Mouthfeel is almost 10 out of 10. I would recommend this to a friend any day."

Good hop aroma with a nice hoppy taste. Leaves that good hop aftertaste behind with a little bitterness. Which I like."

"Appearance is a golden copper with a finger of head that enjoyed some lengthy retention before receding and leaving layers of lace in its wake. The nose is a pleasant combination of hops and grapefruit. The flavor profile is well-balanced, but the body is a touch light for the style. The hop bitterness on the finish is also not quite as pungent as I like, even in a single IPA."
"O- I enjoyed this IPA. It was refreshing and light and just screamed summers at the lake! Sure, I've had better, but I've also had much worse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan of onion hop character, but I like the malt presence and citrusy and dank notes. Flavoring hops definitely dominate, which makes me happy."
""
""
"O: nothing out of this world, but solid and sessionable.... the most appealing element is simply how drinkable and NOT heavy or cloying it is... don't tell me I'm starting to dig Lagunitas..."
""
"O - Like I said, I grew up on this stuff, so to speak, but I still think it's objectively one of the best IPAs, especially West Coast style, out there. DRINK UP!"
""
""
"O - A fine example of the standard IPA, with a lot speaking for it, including a very reasonable price point. If Lagunitas were available in Indiana, this would be on my short list of go-to beers."

"O/D - Tamer than I expected, but highly drinkable as proven by the fact that I had 3 of these in one sitting. A good hop dose that wasn't over the top and a bit on the safe side for a California IPA. All things considered, I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"The color of the brew is copper with orange hues very slight trace of head which covers the the glass when agitated. The nose has elements of grapefruit, piney hops, and cinnamon/carmel. The taste is malt up front with a nice balanced hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated upfront followed by nice syrupy viscousness."

"Overall: Serviceable American IPA. Very sessionable. Would drink again, but doesn't do much to separate itself from the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very clear, straw color, modest head. The aroma is skunky hops, not overpowering, but solid. Unfortunately, the taste doesn't quite hold up. It's good, but a step below the smell. Crisp, dry, some subtle citrus hops... Mouthfeel is great in most ways, but it seems undercarbonated to me. All in all, a solid IPA that you'd be happy to drink any old time. Impressive for a beer that is so mass produced and widely available."

"I've had much more appealing IPA's but this is still just ok if not great in my opinion."
"Great hoppy IPA, the pint was that was clear gold....tasted similar to DFH 60 min. Not exactly like it tho. Had total of three pints and couldn't find a problem with any of them. Also the head lasted most of the way down.. Went great with the fish and chips. A Solid I.P.A. one of my favorites."

"This ale pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a thick white head that slowly gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is more subtle than most west coast ipas. It consists of a generous amount of citrus hops with a slight malt backbone and some pine and grass notes. This offering sips very clean, light and smooth with just enough mouth coating resin to make it very delicious. The flavor is much more forward than the aroma lets on with a substantial amount of citrus and pine resolving to a nice malty sweetness and finishing with a lasting hoppy bitterness. This is a very well crafted ipa and can stand up with Stone and Green Flash as some of the best widely available west coast ipas."

"Overall I love this beer, it however is not as daring and bold as some of Lagunitas limited releases, and is a pretty standard IPA. Every one I've had is nice and homogenous, they do a good job of making sure the batches are consistent. Tastes even better on tap I recommend visiting them, wacky but fun brewery."

"O: Balance is superb, great hop presence, both in bitterness and citrusy-sugariness. A lot of side notes play in the background that give this beer many layers, I just wish one stepped up and captured the show a little more. I’ve drank and seen this on tap many-a places. This is excellent for a basically ubiquitous IPA, but nothing special."

"O: Lagunitas boasts an IPA that's quite a treat. An absolute hop wallop that's perfect for any hophead. Understated malts add a semblance of balance in the end, but for the most part this is pure, unadulterated hoppy goodness that's easy-drinking and refreshing. Top notch."

"This is my favorite IPA. It's flavor is so pleasant and extremely drinkable. Though the ABV is not very high, compared to other IPA's, it is still a very pleasurable drinking experience. On a summer afternoon I could knock these back all day. Have tried it in bottles and was somewhat let down, but as a draft. Mm mm."

"Appears clear golden color with white foamy head that clings to the glass. Lacing adds rings to the glass as it empties. Smells of piney and resiney hops with some citrus. Clean malt bill in both taste and nose. Hops are showcase here and they do quit nicely. Feels light, dry, and extremely drinkable. Great example of the West Coast style. A pure treat."

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and bready malt. Body is full and tangy. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is long, dry and grapefruity. One of the better IPAs for me."

"Overall - Good beer. Flavorful, refreshing, definitely not my personal favorite but it's available year round and reliable in terms of its characteristics."
"I normally don't purchase this beer cause if it shows up an the shelf it dissapears!! So I jumped at the chance and it was well worth it! Say it with me ...Lah-goo-KNEE-tuss"
"Overall impression: A well crafted, balanced American IPA. Pretty tame even by Lagunitas current standards. Enjoyable but slips into the ""sea of same-ness"" with other American IPA's."

"Strong pine aroma is very nice, though a bit one dimensional. The taste does not live up to the smell. There is a grippy tannic quality that I would love in a good red wine, but not so much in an IPA. I could drink this again, but I would always be looking for something better."

""
"tastes great with forward hops and strong sour aferrtertaste, but balanced enough to have w a meal or have a few at a bbq. Distinctive lagunitas flavor. A great beer to just have in the fridge, interesting enough for serious beer folks but not too overpowering for folks who arent regular craft drinkers. A go-to that doesnt dissappoint!"

"This is a decent IPA. Forced to drink at a festival but enjoyed several. Light to medium color with tan head and minimal lacing. Smell is fruity and not too overbearing to affect the taste. Good overall taste with more aftertaste that is bitter. Overall this is a decent beer and will probably have again."

"Anyhoo... poured a light golden color but with an unexpected orange hue. The head faded quickly and left little lacing. Fragrance was quite hoppy but less than would be expected from an IPA, yet replacing that was almost a honeyed or floral scent. Accordingly, this beer tastes like an IPA, but with less hoppiness and in its place more of a honeyed or even floral character. The mouthfeel was light, at least as light (if not more so) than I expect from an IPA, despite the additional sweetness (which in my experience usually leaves a beer feeling more viscous or even ""oily""). Frankly, I quite liked it. If it were marketed as something other than an IPA, even given some creative name like the folks at Magic Hat give their beers and then by way of explanation ""American Bitter Ale"" or some such under it, I would probably have liked this beer even more. So as a beer unto itself, it is a good one, for sure. For an IPA proper, so-so. It's almost as if these guys were intimidated by the IPAs coming out of Stone Brewery and decided not to even try to make a hoppy beer. Or didn't want their beer considered too arrogant. I don't know. Try one for yourself. Either way, it's a good beer worth at least one try!"

"BD 291/13. Light amber pour with a very nice head and lacing that lasts. Nice nose of balanced pine and citrus hops against a sweet malt background. Light medium body with above average carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. The flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced. Toast malt, malt sweetness, citrus (mostly) hop flavor and a mild bitterness combine to produce a quite flavorful, but not over powering ale. The finish is crisp with a effervescent burst of sweet and tart flavor. A nice grapefruit flavor lingers. This IPA focuses on flavor, rather than bitterness and is outstanding."

"Overall, a very clean, very tasty IPA. I like the maltier taste than just a straight up dry IPA. Bitterness does compensate for the subtler hop flavors."

"First time I had this on draft (at Brew House in Chicago), I was slightly underwhelmed, but I think that was due to palate fatigue. Tonight, trying it fresh out of the gate, I really like it. Ample one-finger head, white in color, lots of tiny bubbles, and very good lacing all the way through the experience. The nose is piney, piney, piney, with hints of orange and lemon zest. On the palate, the obvious hops are prominent, as is a certain orange/grapefruit dank. Good mouthfeel. The malt takes a back seat, but that's OK -- makes for a more lean, crisp finish. On balance, I really like this IPA and now appreciate the hub-bub I missed first time around. Would do this again."

"7 ounce pour at Always Ron’s.  Beautiful straw color with a nose of fresh hops and a slight spiciness, perhaps from the hops. Easy drinking and smooth, the citrus hops rush over your tongue and leave you wanting more.  Nowadays, it’s hard to get too excited about an IPA, but Lagunitas shows why they are money….producing solid beers."
""
"If you haven't tried this, I would highly recommend you do so. You will not be disappointed."
"Overall- This seems as if its 88 days but it also seems like more of a bitter IPA than a juice bomb. Not bad but about above average. Worth a shot but I think almost anything by Lagunitas is."
""
""
""

"A very balanced and crisp citrusy IPA. Assertive with a traditional IPA recipe that was well executed to perfection."

"I continue to work my way through the Lagunitas roster, holding off on this one for a while and instead trying some of their bigger IPA offerings. Lately this beer is showing up across the province and tonight I finally had the bomber in my fridge, still pretty fresh after a few weeks. Color is darkish yellow falling just shy of orange, with a decent amount of whitish foam. Lagunitas has such a classic and unique character, allegedly due to inordinately warm fermentation temperatures, and this beer certainly captures that aspect in spades. Aroma is sweet grapefruit, lime, and tangerine citrus, very fruity and sweet with little discernible malt. You can taste the malt more clearly than you can smell it, although even here you have to concentrate. This is a hops delivery vehicle but said flavors are not uber-bitter and overpowering at all. The total package is fairly light, sweet, and fruity. Head was fairly impressive but carbonation on the low end, with a thinnish body and a subtle sweet malt background, maybe a hint of molasses and biscuit. Dangerously drinkable. Flavor starts with tons of mellow citrus pith, fresh orange juice and subdued but clearly detectable pine. There is then a bloom of pineapple and mango tropical fruit flavors along with fresh leafy green chlorophyll and some tree sap and resin in the wet finish. More of a showcase for hop flavors rather than the expected bitterness and it works on this level. Light, unassuming IPA but features some fresh flavors and a nice ""starter"" IPA for drinking in quantity."

"Oh, the Hype! they sell Lagunitas by the case all over the bay area, and I just recently had it on tap for the first time. It's not quite what I'd expect, it's pretty plain with a hint of sour and citrus, and lighter in color than most IPA's, I'm used to. It's better than average, but was expecting quite a bit more flavor."
""
""
""

""

"This was a really good, if not great, west coast IPA that poured a nice amber color with a thin white head. The aroma was fruity and floral with a good citrusy hop flavor followed by a bit of the caramel malt to balance. While not an overpowering IPA, the tastes are more subtle but easily drinkable and refreshing. I am a big fan of the Lagunitas beers and their IPA would be a good one to keep on hand."

""
""
""
""
"O: Solid, but not my favorite Lagunitas offering. Still, its great drinkability can't be overlooked. It reeks of an old-school IPA with its prominent sweetness and generic hop bitterness - however, it's good enough where I'd have no trouble putting it down again."

"O - Mixed bag here. Ultimately it's too syrupy for my palate. I've also had mixed experiences with this 12 pack, the last of which I have chosen for this review. A couple felt wonderful, but as I got used to it the sweetness just became too prevalent."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice full, thick, white head developed with great lacing and retention. Appearance was a clear golden orange.

"The earthy notes keep rolling into the taste. More of the pineapple is present, as is some mango and pine. Good hit of bitterness mid palate, turning to sweetness at the back of the mouth. Not a whole lot of malt is present, you get some hints of it but this one is mostly about the hops. Light to medium mouthfeel with a wet finish. It would be easy to pass this one by, but I always seem to come back to lagunitas. You get your money's worth here, I picked it up for 8.99 a six. It's easy enough to drink that a few is never out of the question."

"Lagunitas India Pale Ale (2013) - 6.2% ABV. Full flowery smell. Sage, cinnamon, coriander, and grass. Full head with excellent retention and lacing. Brass crystal clear body. Highly carbonated and very active. Bitter hops bite with just a hint of malt and oats. Flowery full bitter flavor. Not overpowering like many West Coast USA IPAs. More full flavored and rich. Good ale note mid-palate as the hops nose depletes. Brassy and a bit of skunk cabbage. A little pepper and coriander. Degrades to lemon grass and a crisp hops note. A lingering flower note in the aftertaste. Dry. Smooth. Well balanced. On the verge of IPA perfection. Very good. Highly recommended. Best example of the West Coast IPA breed while remaining fully accessible to the masses. Simply a great beer. 4.0 out of 5."

"This has been my favorite IPA for more than a year, but I am trying other IPA's and have found other that are equally interesting. I am glad that the Lagunitas IPA is becoming available on the East Coast, where the Victory Brewery ""Hop Devil"" is a strong contender, and the Great Lakes Commander Perry IPA is also s very strong alternative."

"Not a bad IPA but just a little one-sided.  It's all hop.  Bold, even brash citrus assault your palate and there is not much malt to protect you.  Funny though, I can smell biscotti and cookies, but just don't really appreciate those in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is fine - though the bitterness lingers.  Overall it's solidly built, but kinda not too polished.  It has stiff competition from the multitude of great IPAs available - try Harpoon!"

"This is a good-looking, good-smelling, good tasting beer. It's flavor profile is not overly complex but it manages to showcase all of the desirable aspects of the style. Its light body would allow me to drink a lot of these. Two thumbs up"
"O: I can understand why this is this best selling IPA in California. It's easy to drink, not too bitter and has a good amount of flavor. It's a good intro IPA to those that are ready to take the next step. It has no obvious flaws, but the flavors are muted in comparison to other California IPA's."

"This is a terrific IPA that has plenty to offer in the way of a well crafted hop experience.

The palate is full of enthusiasm."

"This is a solid IPA, right on the verge of greatness to me. There's almost nothing that warrants a complaint, but very little stands out as an exemplar of the style. This could easily be an every day IPA for me, and with a little more floral or fruity sweetness, it would be outstanding."
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a good two fingers of fluffy off white head. Smells strongly of hops. Lots of pine and earth notes. Slight malt aroma as well. Taste, right upfront there is a malt sweetness, not what I expected. This fades into a lingering resin-like bitterness in the finish. I'll be honest there's not much to the flavor in my opinion. Medium body and medium carbonation. For my taste there is a noticeable lack of hop flavor. Overall a decent beer, however slightly disappointing."

"Nationwide distribution of this beer has been impressive over the last several years. It can be found either on tap or in bottles at nearly any bar, East or West Coast. Cranking out this many IPA's its tough to keep the hop profile consistent but Lagunitas does a great job. Hopefully they can continue to provide this tasty offering."
""
"Overall, the beer is a better than average IPA, but there is nothing about this beer that makes me want to continually come back to it. It has a nice color to it, amber/orange, which produced a nice light foamy head. The beer had a nice hoppy aroma and the taste was the same, but it is just a straight forward IPA. No complexity to it, just simply straight forward. The beer was really easy to drink, which might have been the best quality of the beer, and it left a nice dry aftertaste. Good example of the style."

"Minimal head off of the pour nearly entirely disappates. Color is a nice golden amber. Piney hop aroma is inviting. The flavor is a burst of piney hops. The aftertaste is very freshly picked hops. It's like biting into a grapefruit. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth."
"Lagunitas beers face tons of competition here in Northern California. In the general vicinity are Moylan's, Marin, Bear Republic, Anderson Valley, and North Coast Brewing Companies. In my opinion Lagunitas makes a decent product but is just a notch below all of the above, still I do like to support them. This IPA poured a clear light copper and had a nice thick beige head. Lacing was smattered at the top of the glass, sheeted at the bottom half. Smell was on the restrained side however the the taste was full throttled. A blast of bitter citrusy hops greets the palate, mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. O.K. drinkability that actually grew on me as I emptied the glass. I would say it needs a bit more malt balance. Worth a try. I feel this beer has improved dramatically since my first introduction to it. It is now my go to IPA and one of the most drinkable by far. A perfect tasting IPA that invites you tto have one after the other. One of my three favorite domestic craft beers."
""

"O: Easy to drink with nice hop flavors and well hidden alcohol. I could enjoy more than one in a session and the beer is not overly bitter."

"Overall, solid beer. I would recommend it to anyone who likes craft beer. It is not the best IPA ever, but it really does the job.

"Pours a clear amber color with a 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are both very good.  Has a deep, fresh, citrus, piney aroma.  Very appealing.  Bready, malty taste, quickly followed by a nice piney hop burst.  Bitter, citrus aftertaste that persists.  Soapy but very appealing once again.  Very good IPA.  Definitely one of my favorites.  Seems fresher than the last one I had because I am rating it higher than what it was."

"Very low IBU for an IPA. Perhaps this is why it is so popular. It is more session-able than many true IPAs and thus, less threatening to the less adventurous beer drinker. This could explain its popularity. I believe that if you did a blind taste test next to really any other IPA, you would not choose Lagunitas."
""

"O-We've done it. This is what we were trying to achieve back in the 80's and 90's. A total and complete Hophead revolution. I still think we can push this further as to be able to find a beer like this in every favorite local restaurant or bar(in the bottle is fine,I'm not a radical or anything). A really enjoyable brew!"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/22/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of citrus hop notes with a light-moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, pine, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop flavors with light-moderate malt; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A really enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a very pleasant IPA, not hop-forward as many others and slightly lower ABV (6.2% vs. 7.2% in, say, Torpedo). More drinkable and sessionable than Torpedo, but 1) the lower ABV is deceptive, as it is closer than it may seem, 2) more malty and less floral, 3) SN 12s are 25% cheaper than Lagunitas IPA right now, with no promise of leveling out. I prefer this one for regular drinking (""thirst quenching"") but no so much that I would spend more for it (and limiting to one Torpedo is cheaper in the long run ;-) )."

"Mouthfeel was the thing that I really liked as it was creamy and a little chewy. This beer paired very well with the wings I had and it is a good everyday beer that won't offend with good availability and price point."

"An excellent example of what an IPA was before the hop and ABV arms race started. This almost reminded me of a classic English bitter, just stepped up a little. I just grabbed a single at the grocery store and rather wishing I'd picked up a 6 pack. This is one for regular drinking rather than a tasting night, and I mean that in a good way. Will definitely be getting this again."

"If you have been thinking about trying an IPA but were previously turned off by the ultra hoppiness of some of the other brews out there this is a great option. Mild on the hops, yet extraordinary on everything else. The perfect beer in this drinkers opinion. A must!"
""
""
""
""
""
"IPA pours a copper color, with a large lacing and lasting white head. There is a sharp floral and hoppy aroma. The taste has a nice floral bite, but is well balanced and the sweeter malty flavors are present. A bit too watery, and doesn't have the nice dry or hoppy aftertaste like other IPAS. Overall however it is still a nice tasting, and easier drinking IPA."
""
""
""
"A very good and easy drinking IPA. I like it a lot, but there are others that I like better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yes, it is an IPA. Yes, I was expecting hops. What I wasn't expecting is the lack of Lagunitas' characteristic flavor profile missing, for the most part. Clear golden color, nice lacing, sharp hop presence, with a bit less malt than expected. Malt is there in the nose a bit. Feel is ok, but a teeny bit thin for both the style and brewer. Glad I finally tried it, but will seek L for their standard bearers in the future."

"As noted in other posts, this beer has heavy pine and citrus notes. It pours a golden color with a 2 finger head from my kegerator. The aroma is hoppy and intoxicating, especially from your empty glass - it will leave you wanting another! This beer is best enjoyed on tap and cold. As I've stated earlier it can be an acquired taste for some. But just like a good bourbon or scotch, once that taste locks in you will want more and more and more. If in doubt, drink about a dozen pints and then lets talk."
""
"Overall: This is different than a lot of the IPAs I've had because the hops aren't overpowering and the beer isn't extremely dry. Different than what I'd expect for the style, worth a try if you'd getting a mix and match of IPAs to compare and contrast."

"Definitely THE beer of beer drinkers right now. I don't necessarily mean trendy but... The positive side of this I.P.A luckily outweighs my snobby previous remark. This I.P.A is smooth. Great head out of the bottle which dissipates rather quickly and activates the robust flavor of a spicy I.P.A but smooth enough for it to introduce this genre to beginners. Definitely a favorite of the college crowd. I enjoyed it and you will as well."

"Poured into McDonald's collector glass (I'm...not at my place right now). Clear and golden with lots of carbonation and a medium-thick white head that fades quickly to a thick rim of suds that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet citrus fruit with a bit of more standard hop smell in the background, over a hint of light crackery malt. Taste is smooth and clean, with lots of juicy hop flavor and a delicious wet malt/hop bitterness finish that almost forces you to take another sip. Flavor seems to be muted, but it's a great IPA. Not everything needs to be a hop bomb."

"Lagunitas is a world class brewery. This is a very good, basic IPA. Classics become so for a reason"
""
""
""
"A standard when it comes to a day in and day out IPA. The balance between malt and bitterness is very nice. The aroma is big, and transitions nicely the the flavor. There is just enough lingering bitterness to satisfy the hop heads, but not enough that it gets overbearing. Well done, indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good American IPA. The brew did not ""pop"" for me as did other offerings by Lagunitas but the taste and smell improve once the brew warms up a little bit. This would be a good IPA for someone who would like to try their first IPA but does not want anything 'too bitter'."

"on tap at hard times in Arlington VA. pours a golden color with light head. smell and taste are both loaded with hops on the front end with a nice refreshing bitter finish. very easy to down too. overall a solid American IPA that I could drink all day."

""
""
""
"Just a classic IPA. My go to IPA. It has the classic hoppy bitter flavor I crave. Leaves that great bitter hoppy taste in your mouth. Just a quintessential west coast IPA. Not too strong. Well balanced. A very drinkable IPA that still gives you the hoppy bitter flavor your crave."

"12oz bottle, pours golden with a frothy, off-white head that holds decent retention & leaves chunky lacing down the glass as it fades. Fruity aroma with citric grapefruit, floral hop, caramely malt, faint pine. Tastes are bready, caramely, grapefruity, piny, slight tropical, floral hops, nice balance. Medium bodied, finishes bitter with some astringency. Overall, I enjoy this one more and more each time I have it. It is a world-class American IPA."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a finger of white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet malt. Flavor is light citrus and tropical fruit, citrus and piney hops, sweet bready malt with an intriguing very light spicyness. Light to medium bodied. Flavors are not assertive, but well balanced. I would like a bit more hop assertiveness, but perhaps I did not get an absolutely fresh bottle (dating please…). A pleasant, low key American IPA."
""
""
""

"A fruity and sweet IPA with flavors of orange, lime and a grapefruit bitterness. The malt profile is rather understated with a biscuit mouthfeel. An aggressive IPA, packed with flavor and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In my book this beer goes down as one of the best flagship beers on the planet. Vibrantly hoppy and infinitely drinkable and quenching. The bitterness rests at just the right level. It's enough to keep it approachable but still challenge a green palate and introduce it to what a real beer can be. Excellent quality for the price too. Lagunitas built itself on this beer, and it's a rock-solid foundation."
""
""
""
"Overall – A tasty IPA that is fairly easy drinking without any one aspect being too overpowering producing a fairly well balanced brew."
""
"There's always a 6-pack of this in my 'fridge. This American IPA utilizes Belgian yeast to provide a smooth and robust American IPA. It's almost like a Belgian-style IPA. Fantastic Lagunitas signature style hops and malt character. Smooth and a nice clean finish."
"O - This is a very solid IPA. There are better out there but this one is sure not to disappointing, and doesn't come at a bad price either."
""
""
""
"Overall - Great brew, Lagunitas scores another win. If you like this style of hops in this brew you NEED to try Lagunitas SUCKS, you won't be sorry!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty damn good IPA, i will def be buying again, possibly on a semi regular basis as my local Krogers stocks them. One of my top 5 IPAs, but still no two-hearted..."
""
""
""
"This is a solid go-to IPA. Some would call it a benchmark by which other IPAs should be judged. Excellent floral notes in the aroma, and clean finish with every swig. The only thing keeping me from giving it a higher review is that I feel the flavor profile could benefit from a slightly higher alcohol content to give those aromas the extra punch they deserve."
""
"It is not bad at all. However, I was expecting something better."
""
"O: Well it started off great. Both the look and smell are fantastic on this beer and I couldn't wait to take a swig but the weakest part of the beer comes in the taste and mouthfeel. The taste isn't very balanced to me but still has a great hop profile that saves it. The mouthfeel needs some work as it almost kind of coats the inside of your mouth. Odd but this has the makings to be a stellar offering from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"another great lagunitas product."
""
""
"A completely different beer on tap.  It seems to be very common here in Florida. It's their go to IPA, it seems.  I was almost hesitant to order it since I've had it many times in bottle, and was never crazy about it.  Due to lack of options I ordered one.  It is a much better tasting beer on draught.   Thumbs up! This can be my go to IPA as well."
""
"O- A hop head's dream is what we have here. Not the most complex, but fairly balanced despite the huge hop presence. I truly amazing hop profile and a delight to drink. Would certainly have again. Just missed a little on the taste and feel for this to be a world class beer."

"12 oz bottle. Clear copper pour, thin off white creamy head and lots of sticky thick bands of lacing ... Aroma is citrusy grapefruit and light piney hops with a touch of caramel malts ... Taste is bitter and rindy with light piney and citrusy grapefruity hops, light sugar, sweet caramel malts and a nice punch of ibu’s ... Finish is dry with a lingering bitter dry hop and malty. .... Solid sessionable ipa abv hidden well ... Mouthfeel is lightly slick and oily."
""
""
"After all the hype I finally decided to try this beer, and sadly, it was a bit of a let down. Smell was slightly faint, but had pine and citrus aromas. Your typical west coast IPA, just not as bold. The taste was most of the same. It started out pretty well but sadly the taste dies too quickly. The balance between bitterness and flavor was definitely on the more bitter side, and I wouldn't even consider this a very bitter beer. It reminded me of a bitter, piney version of Corona, which isn't a particularly good thing. I think I'll just stick to Stone and Green Flash."
""
""
"One of the better “standard” easy to find IPAs out there, but does not stand out for me."
"O: Killer IPA, one of the better ones I've tasted in a while. Everything is in balance from aromas to fruit and hops. Everything this hophead needs. thx Lagunitas"
""
""
"Visually, the bottle looks like it came out of some brewery in a South American jungle. Big ""IPA"" in the center of the label that looks to be painted through a stencil, set on a tea-stained label with some red text that gives it flare and danger. Makes me think of palm fronds, machetes, machine guns, and cocaine production. Poured into a glass, it has a nice, almost-white head over an amber body. Fresh pine and tropical fruit on the nose. It smells clean and simple. Hops and fruit on the palate, grass, simple and not big, and a clean finish. Nice carbonation. It's not a huge beer, but it's nice and clean for the style, with really no bitter aftertaste, and the 6.2 ABV is nothing to balk at. I could see getting another sixer of this and doing some BBQ-ing. Goes great with pizza and hot wings, too!"

"O-I like Lagunitas brews and I like fruit-forward IPAs, but this one fell a little short for me. It wasn't a bad brew, but the tropical and citrus flavors felt more muddled than complex, and I just never got into it. Perhaps I had an old bottle because the whole thing tasted a little stale?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my old time sessionable ipas. Definitely not my favorite, nor the best, but an old reliable standby."
"O - For a easy to drink west coast IPA this one is rather enjoyable. I'm not totally in love with the hop profile of this one, with its slightly tangy and the lemon rind flavor it proves a little to much for me. But that is just being picky, so if you like a hoped forward west coast easy drinking IPA this one is for you . Cheers!"

Small-medium head. Just so full of flavor, super refreshing. Had two right in a row before I had to leave, or else I would have had six more. Highly recommend, one of the best IPAs or beers I have ever had."

"had this on tap at Guu's. was a pretty dark red for an ipa. had a pleasant hoppy aroma. Taste was a very nice balance of sweet hoppiness and maltiness. Quite a bit different than the hop bomb i was expecting. very smoothe, good mouthfeel, and after drinking two apparently there is some alcohol in there too! Overall, quite a unique ipa than what we usually get around here, nice to have a well-balanced versus hop-bomb ipa. look forward to more before the keg blows!"

"Low B"
""
"Clear yellow-orange pour with a two finger off-white head with great retention and lacing. Perfumey floral nose with hints of mango, orange peel, pine, lemon, and that odd, almost squashy smell I almost always seem to detect with Lagunitas beers. The taste is citrus dominated with hints of tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit along with pine, mango, caramel, and unfortunately, that squashy-pumpkin character again. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation and good balance between the sweet malt and bitter hops. The finish is crisp, tangy and dry. Overall this is a solid IPA, but I just can't get past that squash thing."

"O- Maybe it is the fact that we have long been spoiled with such an abundance of hops, but this just isn't a premier American IPA for me. The flavors are good, to be sure, but it isn't quite on-par with some of the others I have had in my life. It I wasn't judging within it's category, this would be scored much higher, but the competition is steep in the American IPA category, so this is only a little above average."

"A nice solid offering, definitely hop forward, but remains pretty well balanced throughout. Quite good, though at times feels a bit stale or leaning towards the heavier sappy flavours. Worth trying, a pretty well-made assertive IPA."

"Solid IPA. Every brewery seen to have one these days but its nice to find one with some malt character to it. Really hits the spot."

""
"Now, I'm not sure it's a GTO 420 big block flavor, as the billboard suggests, but I'd sure go again."
""
"O-Definitely a more malt balanced IPA. Lagunitas beers tend to be rather sweet, and this is no exception. I feel like some of their other beers are more balanced, this one seems a bit lacking, really needs more hop character and bitterness to balance the malt"

"Overall, interesting enough, this beer aged pretty well. If you're into experimenting with your cellar I'd recommend throwing one or 2 of these down there for 6-12 months. This beer is also great fresh but it was a cool idea that didn't turn out to be a failure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yes, I know this one is just about everywhere you go in California, but I'm totally fine with that, because I think this is a benchmark. Just a really great, basic IPA leaning towards the piney, hoppy side of things, like many CA IPA's do. There are definitely more exciting IPA's out there, but this one is a solid staple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The label states this is a ""special homicidally hoppy ale"". To me it is a hoppy, American pale ale. Either way, it is a very good ale that I highly recommend."

"12 oz bottle poured clear amber with a small head that leaves ample lacing. A woody, earthy hop aroma is followed by a flavor that is a bit more fruity and a lot more piney in tasting.  Moderately bitter, with a suitable hop/malt balance.  Good carbonation level. Disappointing for Lagunitas in general and for the brewer of Hop Stoopid in particular."
""
"Overall this is good."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Not what I was expecting based on my enjoyment of both Lagunitas Hop Stoopid and DayTime IPA. Would I drink it again? No."

"O: My first Lagunitas experience here. They recently made it to Nashville and I look forward to trying other styles. A great IPA all around here. Well balanced with fantastic hop flavors. This one ranks up there with the top IPA's in my book."

"Bottle. Dark golden/amber colored. Clear. Dark beige dense head. Lasting. Flowers, fruit, herbs and sweetness in the aroma. Flavour is malty and sweet with a herbal hoppyness. Is quite grassy. Well balanced and medium bodied. Is medium bitter in the end. Quite good one."

"All in all a class act, a great example of what an American IPA should taste like. It stands apart, but only because of it's great representation of a traditional IPA. It doesn't need anything too bizarre or cutting-edge to stand on it's own, and that is impressive. Could drink this everyday, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys hops on a traditional scale"
""
""
"O: Right up my alley tastewise. If you like an IPA that is semi sweet, then this is a good one to try. I originally had it on draught and had a few of them in one night because it was so good and not too hoppy/heavy for a session beer. Went back and bought a 22 oz. to fully enjoy it. As of right now, this makes for one of the best session IPAs I've had."

"O-I have been relatively underwhelmed by a number of lagunitas flavors, and this was no different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste improved for me as the beer warmed. I marked it up from a 3.5. The beer has a substantial bitterness, but it's pleasant, not over the top. Definitely worth another try."
"O- A super solid IPA that exemplifies the west coast approach."
""
""
""
""
""
"For the price, this is a nicely complex brew with some excellent hoppy characteristics. A great interpretation of the style"
"This is a very sessionable IPA and is quickly one of my favorites. I've never had just an okay beer from this brewery. They are always great. The balance on this one is amazing but such a fruity crisp bite from the hops is again very refreshing and makes this a very hopped but extremely drinkable beer which could some times be hard to pull off I can imagine. This one does just that. Excellent beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall there is nothing wrong with this beer, it is a pretty solid gold standard for a traditional Pacific coast IPA. Citrus, pine, grapefruit, lightly sweet malt. Fairly dry overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot of my friends, whose palate I respect, love this beer, so I had to try it. When I took my first sip I said ""It's like drinking a cactus!"" If you've ever eaten nopales, this is the liquid form. Very subtle IPA bitterness, but with a green sappy finish that I did not enjoy. I will definitely revisit this beer at some point, but for now I cannot give it high marks."
"O - overall a decent IPA not among my favorites but defiantly worthy."
""
""
""
"Overall-Nicely done. It is a brew worth buying again. It was a good feeling to pop this open after a long day's work and enjoy the balance of flavors."

"This one is a foam-bomb, or maybe I was careless too. Orangy-IPAy like them all it seems: Dark tannic orange. I'm getting a nose I can't easily find, but the old proboscid apparatus is a bit under the task anyhow. But taste is sweet malts, and fruit, mostly citrus and light pine that begins (the bitterness) mid to late and has a very pleasing sustain. I like the balance a good bit, but the first malt notes are a bit loud to me. Great mouthfeel, and creamy edges, this ones a pleaser. Overall a hit for me."

"O: Very solid IPA from Lagunitas. Very well balanced between the malt sweetness and bitter juicy hops. After having reviewed several of thier beers prior to this one, I'm starting to become more familiar with thier hop and flavor profile. This one was no let down, a tasty brew and imo a good starter ipa."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid IPA. I thought I reviewed this beer, but I guess I enjoyed way too many and didn't even remember to check my reviews page. Beer is reviewed and I will keep drinking more of it."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a solid IPA. Very tasty and went well with the food."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm surprised I like this beer as much as I do. It's VERY apricot and grapefruit heavy for me, but I still enjoy it... man, I don't quite understand that, being 'meh' on the two flavors. Regardless of that, this is a super solid beer that I'd probably try again, due to the awesome tea flavor."

"Overall a very well done west coast IPA, ticks all the boxes. The citrus hop really stand out in this, crisp clean and quite bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straightforward west coast-style IPA, on tap at Delta Grill in NYC. Not bad but not as good as Sucks or Leftovers or Hop Stoopid (I know those are doubles, so sue me). Golden orange color, a bit hazy, with a decent white head, fair retention and lacing. Grapefruit and piney hop aromas with a touch of sweetness, pretty familiar in the nose. Taste follows suit, somewhat more subdued hop character than I’d like, again, lots of grapefruit and pine, pineapple and orange, some malt sweetness underneath. Bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Smooth, medium bodied with medium carbonation, decently dry finish, just a little bitterness hanging around after. Good but not exceptional."
"O: this is good IPA, however, with the malts coming out as strong as they do, I'm just wondering is this an English or an American IPA? Anyhow, no big deal, I'd have it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Much to my estimated guess, this is a beginner quality IPA. Doesn't stand out from its pack but does have a nice pine and citrus. I would call this a good session IPA that is worth the money, if you can find it. If your looking for the ""wow factor", keep looking!"
""
""
"Pours golden with a nice creamy head. The head lingers a bit with good lacing on the glass. Fresh piney hop aroma. Good carbonation on the front and back of the tongue but somehow lesser in the middle. Good balance to the taste of this IPA - while the piney hop is present it is quickly balanced with a caramel malt with some lingering hop tingle."

"Mouthfeel: Medium-light body, refreshing."
"O – This is a pretty good IPA. The biggest gripe that I have is that the hops seem held back a tad in the flavor. I know it’s not a DIPA so I shouldn’t expect a bitter hop flood, but I expected a little bit more from Lagunitas. Still a very tasty and drinkable beer."
""
"Hmm... It's been a spell since I had one of these. It's better than I remember."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer and always have. One of the first craft IPA's I've ever had and remains a staple in my beer diet. Favorite IPA? No, but definitely up there and I think it deserves the hype for it's full and revolutionary character."
"O: I like this beer. One of my standards. Much better on tap than a bottle."

""
""

"Great beer..will be a regular in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall:  Drinks a lot like an East Coast IPA.  Hop aroma and flavors are all there, but well balanced with malt sweetness.  Could be a session beer, except the ABV will sneek up on you.  Recommended for all but the chronic hop heads."
""
""
""
""

"O: a very good ipa, delicious and drinkable, with well balanced citrus hops flavor and a touch of pine, a great go to ipa."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"I have usually liked Lagunitas offerings. This is a good IPA, but it is competing with a fair number of really good IPAs. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, even though it is a decent beer, as there are several IPAs locally that are both easier to find and better."
""
""
""
""
"O - middle of the road IPA, and now days, that is a crowded road indeed. On the plus side, its readily available, decently priced and fairly tasty. On the down side, there really are better IPAs out there, so I dont think Ill be drinking too many of these. If you see some and havent had it, get some."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, light copper with a soapy white head that settles to a thin cap. Lovely floral hop aromas of pine resin, grapefruit, and fresh-cut grass. More resinous, floral hops, lots of grapefruit and pine with a mild caramel and baked cracker malt profile. Mouthfeel is crisp and drinkable, with a medium body and solid carbonation. Overall a superb ""everyday"" IPA, and it's affordable to boot."
""
"Overall, I would prefer less hop aroma but overall, I like this beer and will definitely buy it again and again."

"O: Another solid IPA amongst the sea of solid IPAs. It's good, but nothing really stands out in comparison to the multitude of other IPAs on the market. Good price point, though, and easy to savor at 6.2%"
""
""
"This has nice crisp carbonation and a light body. Very drinkable. I'd get this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice from the options I have readily available."

""
"o - really solid ipa and one i'd go to again."

"This was the first Lagunitas beer that I tried, after this amazing IPA I fell in love with the Lagunitas Brewing company. This is a very hoppy yet smooth beer. This beer is one of those IPA's that is not as heavy and s full as most, so you can keep coming back for more. Overall this beer is highly recommended and is one of the better beers Lagunitas serves, even though I haven't had bad brew yet!!!!"

"The beer is solidly medium-bodied, perhaps even medium-heavy bodied at times. Carbonation is adequate enough to foam this up slightly on the palate, creating a simultaneously creamy-smooth mouthfeel. Slight ethanol burn in the back of the throat, somewhat surprising for a 6.2% IPA. Finishes pleasantly dry."

"O - Good solid example of what an IPA should be. I feel it could be pushed a bit further in terms of flavor. Overall a very good beer though."
""

"O. Very nice and floral IPA with a strong hoppy taste. For an everyday beer, it is quite fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"Had this while at the Giants game in San Francisco. Pours a clear, golden colour. tastes lightly hoppy with a slight malt finish. Pine and grass notes linger in there too. Nothing to amazing about this beer, but it beats the other alternatives at a ball game. that has to count for something."

"O - This lacked definition and sufficient flavor for me. Something about it is good, and I'd be happy enough to drink it across a session and not think about it, but it isn't memorable enough to make me want to buy it again. I had heard such good things."
"Pours a deep gold color with an large white head and good retention. Leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is of floral hops. Taste with nice malty backbone along with grassy and piney hop bitterness. This is a nice medium body IPA, the carbonation is great for the style. This is a good session beer, very drinkable without being overly hoppy."
""
""
""

"The cask version was even better and one of the best cask ales that I've had in a really long time. Get it if you can find it."
""
""
""

"This is one of my favorite IPAs. It's extremely consistent, delicious, and affordable."
""

"A real nice amber color pour with a creamy top. Eventhough it is 8.2% by volume it tastes a feels like a 6.0 beer but packs a nice whollop! I always buy 1 pt 6oz bottle along with the Imperial Stout for a nice night of beer drinking. All the beer from this brewery taste fresh and refreshing.. I just keep coming back to Lagunitas my favorite craft beer outside of Oregon where I live."
""

"O- Probably the only beer I've ever had from Lagunitas that I didn't like. No real character to this one at all. Reminds me of a Sam Adams IPA... all wet hay flavors and no real sence of citrusy punch and piney hops. A very droll IPA at best."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy orange color with a white head and nice lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel along with mild citrus hops. Taste is also caramel sweet at the beginning with a solid hop bitterness that doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer. Seems to be balanced but overall less hoppy than other west coast IPAs. Moderate body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Might be a good summer beer, but I would avoid it again."
""
"Cheers!"
"A relative newcomer to the area. Not sure how fresh this is, but its still impressive. A nice pine aroma up front. Perfect carbonation leads to a nice mouthfeel and a good sturdy malt presence. Just enought to carry the hops. A really easy, but engaging sipper. I'm going to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All this time enjoying Lagunitas brews and I haven't had their flagship, their single IPA. It's got a tiny head for the style, and a clear orange body. The aroma is a solid citrus and pine hop. The taste is good, it's that kind of transparent ""hop juice"" style IPA that I can down like water. The malts step completely to the side, letting the hops take the wheel. The hops aren't an aggressive driver, they drive 55 on the freeway. It's a great drive for everyone. The mouthfeel is mellow and slightly drying, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a great, drinkable IPA. It won't punch you in the face, but that's what Hop Stoopid is for."
""

"O: This is a tasty beverage. It's a beer I've had many, many times because we get it on sale at our local savemart frequently. Glad to finally sit down and review it. I really enjoy the malt character that holds this beer down. It works really well with most spicy food because it does a bit more than wash out your palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A fairly good IPA. I feel like it could benefit by scaling back a degree or two on the malt, which seem unusually high for the style. Still, it's a very drinkable brew, and one I'll buy from time to time, especially when options are limited."
"Straightforward west coast-style IPA, on tap at Delta Grill in NYC. Not bad but not as good as Sucks or Leftovers or Hop Stoopid (I know those are doubles, so sue me).

Smooth, medium bodied with medium carbonation, decently dry finish, just a little bitterness hanging around after. Good but not exceptional."
""
""
"edit: the more i drink this the more i like it. its familiar now, and in the context of so many other india pale ales, this one is really starting to stand out for me. especially on tap."
""
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle, note visible date. It is of a golden color, a one finger white head that dissipated into lacing. This beer has a nice citrus aroma, with some pine and sweet malt. Taste is not overpowering with hops, rather easy drinking, with notes of pear, pine, and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean, with moderate carbonation. This would be a good beer to have with poultry or fish, but not what I am looking for from IPA. It does not make a strong enough statement."
""
""

"D - One is enough. Too sweet and not hoppy enough for an IPA. Maybe an older bottle?"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Single finger head with lots of lacing on a clear golden with crimson hues body. Aroma is sugary and citrusy with a earthy note. The good are well represented in the flavor with citrus, earthy, butter and sweet notes. Fairly complex. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable IPA and one I could drink routinely."
""
"O- Nothing over the top...but for a standard IPA, I think it is excellent. What's more, this is one of the best flagship brews that I have sampled. Drinks much larger than a brew boasting a modest 6.2% ABV."
""
"Pours rich golden with good carbonation. Aroma is intense hops with fruity and floral bouquet. Initial flavor is very balanced, with the hops eventually overpowering the rich malt. Finishes with a lingering bitterness, but overall is VERY smooth for an IPA"
""
""
"I never thought I'd be so let down by a Lagunitas brew. It doesn't change the way I feel about them one bit though because literally everything else they do is gold. Bad bottle maybe??"

"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a nice dark straw hew with a small white head with nice lacing. Has a nice floral bouquet for the hops, very pleasant. The taste is definitely hoppy, with a bit of a bite. However, a light taste of malt is present. Beer seems to be carbonated well and goes down really smooth. Overall, a good IPA."
""
"Pours a light, bubbly, golden orange with a one-finger bright white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of juicy grapefruit, tropical fruit notes and a bit of malt. Mix of citrus and pine hops in the flavor profile. A bit muted for a fresh West Coast IPA. Begins with a mix or orange and grapefruit notes, followed by a bit of a sweet bready, silky malt before a quick pine finish. Semi-bitter. Nice drinkable, balanced blend."

"O: Good solid IPA. nice beer, as expected coming from Lagunitas."

"Bottle from The Wine Seller in A2. Pours a light golden hay color with a one finger white head on top. Great floral citrus aroma coming off the top, some pine, and a small bit of sweet citrus peel. Flavor follows with citrus rinds and a light sweetness on the palate to balance. Pale malts are present but this highlights the hops with a crisp finish. Relatively light bodied with high carbonation and a clean finish. Solid, solid IPA."

""
""
""
""
"There’s nothing to complain about with this. Full of hop flavor and well balanced, with a slick easy drinking body; you can’t go wrong with a sixer of this minor class from Lagunitas."
""
"A quintessential west coast IPA that I drink often. Well made, & consistent if it's fresh. Reasonably priced too."

"Taste is bitter right off - crisp, sharp resinous and a bit dry. Mouthfeel is very good, nice carbonation and light enough to drink a lot. Very classic west coast ipa."

""
""
""
""
""
"This is a vibrant golden-amber in the glass. Great hoppy aroma, grassy with some onions and crushed garlic—in a good way. (Thanks to Lagunitas Sucks for helping me pick up those notes.) It’s a West Coast IPA, definitely, with a hop bite that’s light and crisp with a sharp bitterness and a wonderful finish. This is a classic."
"Just tapped a horse keg of this brew. I wanted to get a keg of Stoopid but that was harder to get and mo money. This has many of the characteristics of Stoopid.. kind of it's little brother. The only thing I miss is the mouth feel which is lacking in this beer. Very much a refreshing IPA with a nice sharp carbonation typical of Lagunitas brews. Another good beer from a place that makes many great beers."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Having qualified my opinion -- the Lagunitas was a really pleasant surprise. Not nearly the hop bitterness I had expected, the hop character came through mostly as sweet and citrusy; I had trouble deciding between grapefruit or pineapple flavors, and settled somewhere in between. Very nice balance to the beer, and I found it an exceptionally refreshing brew."
""
""
"I am thoroughly enjoying this beer right now"
""
"Its got a little bit too much carbonation and its got a really dry finish, almost too dry."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lagunitas refers to this as a ""homicidally hoppy ale," which is false advertising. It seems a bit watered down, but the flavors are still very nice. A good brew for sure."
""
"Overall - This is a good beer. Nothing amazing, not their best product, but a good beer. I would certainly recommend it, especially to those like me who think California IPA's get a little carried away on the hops. TO a hop head this beer probably sucks, but i liked it."
""
""
""
"Lagunitas has a good, solid flavor, and has all the signs of a good IPA. I would definitely keep some in my fridge now and then as a go-to beer - if it were cheaper and more readily available around Pittsburgh."

"This brew poured out as a nice looking golden color with a thick white head on top. the lacing on the glass was pretty nice here. The smell of the beer was hoppy which is a good thing for the style. The taste of the beer was pretty solid, good bitter hops flowing nicely through this brew. The mouthfeel was pretty good, well carbonated and drinkable. Overall I think this is a pretty solid brew. I would drink it again."
""
""
"Overall this a very drinkable IPA. Doesn't have much over the top bitterness. A good intro to IPA's. Solid with some good value."
"O: Been awhile since I had a Lagunitas. Need to start buying from them more often. They do hops right. One of the best year round IPAs. On par with Racer 5, Union Jack."

"Overall a good solid beer."

"O: Still a great beer. Refreshing, simple, satisfying. One of the great California styles."

"Thin yellow. A foamy head of lasting presence. Waft of hop and pungent yet juicy, sweet citrus. Intense bite of bitterness on tongue, lemon juice finish which lasts along with a bitter dryness. This is a good ipa experience but i've had some more drinkable and smooth with the same hoppiness."

"Notes: I have nothing but good things to say about this but I am a huge hophead. Some of my buddies here on the east coast would call this one out of balance. I say beauty is in the eyes of the beer holder. I might seek alternatives if you're not a huge hops fan."
"O- This is a good beer. While it's flavors are standard it is executed well and is a reliable session ipa."
"Pours a fireburst orange with a nice creamy head that settles into fine whisp. Mild hoppy haze. Moderate herbal pine resin nose, with a little earthiness. This is a very drinkable IPA, hoppy and tasty without being aggressive. Very pleasant - bordering a pale ale, but this is a good thing."
"Nothing here folks. Time to move on."
"O: Just a delicious, fairly simple and direct IPA that would be especially great on a hot summer day."
"O-Very enjoyable IPA, nothing crazy, but great taste"
"O- a good, verging on great IPA, but could just use a little something extra."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a hazy gold/orange color. Very nice thick, off white head, very good retention and high marks for lacing. Aroma of this American IPA is wonderful highest marks. The nose is full of pine and citrus. The Hops are the star of the show with this brew. There is some slight grainy undertones that are able to sneak through the Hop Overload. The taste of the AIPA is as the nose suggests, lots of pine, citrus- Hops dominate the flavor. There is a malted grain backbone that gives way to a bitter, creamy smooth finish. This IPA is like drinking Silk. So So Smooth. You have heard of love making music? This is a love making beer- I will have this at the ready bedside the next time I take the wife to pleasure town. Very well balanced- Absolute treat for hop heads."
"O - Very good and enjoyable IPA. Not overly complex but that is exactly what makes it so good. I would recommend it."
"o - enjoyable and better than average for the style, but not breaking any new ground for me. would buy it again, though nothing stands out enough to make it worth seeking out."
"Taste is the same as the nose. Citrus, mostly grapefruit and some lemon zest, dominate the palate. Medium bodied and easy to session on IPA."
"Worth the buy."
"Just a well made beer."
"Overall I like this brew a lot. I think I could session it due to the decently low abv and the lightness of the body. Lagunitas has not let me down yet."
"I have to say I enjoyed this beer. Not a bad IPA."
"visit my website selfhatinghipster.com for more beer reviews, music, books and more..."
"This is the smoothest IPA I've tasted to date. It has an interesting flavor profile without overwhelming the palate. As an IPA, the level of 'hop' is balanced well by the addition of malt. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking to enjoy more than one IPA."
"Overall: Yeah, its a good IPA, to be sure. I'm just still stuck on why Lagunitas feels the need to have a nearly identical APA and IPA. I had both of them side-by-side and besides a few points on the SRM scale, their pretty damn similar. Good flavours all around, but half an ""overall"" point will be taken away for being unoriginal."
"Overall - ...its a very drinkable, well rounded IPA. I don't think its the best in its category, but its by no means average. Pour yourself a pint if you're an IPA fan (and even if you're not), its worth a try."
"Notes: Not a bad beer but I would have liked a bit more hop flavors. A little on the malty side with a fair bitter kick. Not exactly what I want in an IPA (especially one from California) but not bad overall."
"O: I’m near the end of my first 12 pack of this beer. I love it. It’s easy to drink, pleases the hop head in me, and is built incredibly well. I appreciate IPAs that pull off a really clean finish. This one does that. A new favorite IPA."
"Mouthfeel is light with a bit of a creamy texture to it. Overall, a fine IPA. Nothing thats going to destroy you palate with hops but still a nice refreshing hop forward beer."
"It's a decent bev, but there are way beter IPAs out there."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, prickly and dry on the tongue. Feels a bit watery and plain for an IPA, especially for a West coast brewery. There's too many better options out there."
"A nice, drinkable beer. I'd gladly drink this, but I won't pick it over many other IPAs. A good flagship nonetheless."
"Overall / Drinkability: As I expected, it went fast. I continue to be greatly impressed with this brewery - haven't had anything yet that disappointed. A good hoppy ale that isn't a bruising hop smackdown on my tongue, drinkable enough that I want another one, and it went well with food (Indian - Tikka Masala). A solid good beer."
"This pours hazy orange with light, fluffy head and active bubbles. There is only a little bit of lacing, but the retention is good. The nose is fresh and smells a lot like orange citrus with a little bit of graininess. There is enough of a crisp, bitter bite in the flavor…but a surprising amount of cereal malt in the aftertaste to balance it out. I like that the malt is presence, but not in a sweet syrupy way. This beer is very “approachable”. It’s easy to have a couple, and I feel like even a not-so-adventurous beer drinker could enjoy one. This is like a pumped up Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale, very west coast in style and appearance."
"Poured into my 13 oz tulip. A light orange yellow with a 2 inch fluffy white head. Smell is grapefruit, lemon, some grass, and pine. Taste is all that, maybe a little more pronounced than the smell gives. Drinks pretty easy, solid body and enough carbonation. It is a nice IPA. As always, a very good price."
"Overall, I wasn't impressed. I felt like there was not enough hops to make it stand out. The alcohol did not come through strongly, and I think that's a good thing. It's drinkable, and for many people, it would be a decent beer to have. I just feel that in the world of craft beer, there's way too many good IPAs to choose from that would kick this beer off a pedestal any day of the week."
"An excellent style done perfectly."
"Solid IPA. The hops should be the spotlight of this beer, and they were. A quick tart of bittering hops smooths out to the citruisy flavors of the later additions. A little heavy in body for an IPA my opinion, but it is a 6.2% beer, so we expect a little bit of thickness. Looks pretty good in the glass, empties back out decently well. Definitely not a bad example of the style, but not really something Id hop around with my five dollar bill trying to get the bartenders attention for."
"have had a few of these over the years so i reckon i might as well write one up. drinking a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. coppery-orange color with a decent inch of head that hasn't totally subsided halfway through the glass. i smell a much earthier hop coming off this ipa; damp pine needles maybe, and something a little sweet and tangy though not quite citrus. the taste reinforces the earth qualities and molasses with respectable bitterness. creamier mouthfeel that doesn't dry out until the end. i personally prefer the aggressive west coast citrus style, so this one ranks lower on my list."
"Such an amazing IPA. I had it on draft in San Diego over Labor Day weekend and waited to review it once I had it in a bottle. I am now a Lagunitas fan."
"Overall - I really think this is a solid IPA. Granted it starts out a bit on the sweeter side (which I prefer), you still get the nice bitterness and drying pine hops in the end and long into the finish. Really a nice IPA that I will enjoy again."
"O. A rather disappointing offering from a brewery that has made some beers I really enjoy drinking. I'll stick with Stone and Sierra Nevada whenever I want a west coast IPA."
"Overall: this was an enjoyable IPA, not a bad choice at all."
"Overall - This must be an old bottle. If not, how can this beer be one notch bellow it's outstanding family member Hop Stoopid? That A- beer has everything this B+ brew is missing (Aroma, mouthfeel, taste). I would love to try this beer on tap to give it justice!"
"There is something about this IPA that kept it from being great...maybe the small nose or the almost confusing, though not unpleasant, mix of hop flavor....I liked it but not one of my favorites."
"Pours a golden honey color that is fairly clear and not cloudy. Has a small white foam head that dissipates quickly. Smell isn't very strong. Hoppy notes and some grapefruit/citrus. Smell is light a fresh. Taste is slightly hoppy and piney, but not very strong. Bitterness apparent in the aftertaste but the flavors die out real fast. Beer is very carbonated but is very light and drinkable. Overall a decent beer but nothing special. Won't be rushing back for another 6 pack."
"O - Strikes me as an average IPA, not really standing apart from the crowd in any way. I'm not compelled to try it again."
"O: I am enjoying this brew quite a bit, actually. It's a very drinkable IPA with its own unique characteristics that aren't wholly different than your standard IPA. The best of both worlds, I'd say."
"Not a bad IPA. In my opinion it's a little different than most west coast IPAs, but its enjoyable and quite easy to drink."
"O- decent ipa def above avg. Good hop flavor ok nose not a great appearance"
"O - Overall a hit or miss. People talk so good about this beer, and some dislike it. I like me some lighter IPAs when it comes to session drinking, something like Ranger. However this beer is fantastic and should not be over looked. Reminds me of Big Eye IPA. Stay thirsty my friends."
"O: Definitely not your typical West coast IPA as the hop profile is clearly less prominent, but I found it to be tasty and refreshing. I'm a big fan of grapefruit/citrus IPA's so I quite enjoyed this one, though it did lack the ""punch"" of a higher quality IPA. Still, quite quaffable and definitely more approachable. Cheers!"
"I have thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every other beer I have had from Lagunitas, and I've had quite a few now, but this one still doesn't hit any spots for me. I highly recommend any reader who enjoys this beer, or beer at all, to try Hop Stoopid, their double IPA. At this time, it is my favorite beer and it wipes the floor with this one."
"O: Not a bad beer, but nothing special either. Pretty average."
"Overall this is a decent brew, but not exactly suited for my taste. I like my IPAs to be brutally bitter, and with more hop bite."
"Overall a really nice beer. Not as hoppy as I was expecting. A really nice, balanced beer though. I could drink a sixer of these unlike most other IPA's."
"The more I sip this one, the more I realize how balanced it is. It is certainly hop-forward, don't get me wrong, but the bitterness is reigned in just before it gets to be too much. Thirst-quenching and delicious, I'm glad I finally picked this up."
"O: An easy drinking IPA, that would likely be most enjoyed by those who enjoy their IPAs with the flavors of citrus and floral hops, along with malt."
"D: In a word. Decent. Nothing mind-blowing, very well rounded and pretty fun to drink but there are better beers for less money."
"Overall worthy, though."
"A nice beer, but not one of the great ones."
"D: not so drinkable with that weird taste that I can't get over with..."
"O: Very easy drinking beer. Perhaps too hyped. I was expecting the hops to have more impact but it's still a good beer. Buy this in bulk and share with friends. I'll defiantly keep this in mind."
"Purchased a 6pack at Total Wine & More for $7.99 - $1.00 coupon, $6.99 for a six pack. What a steal. Lagunitas keeps gaining favor in my mind & on my palate."
"This one was nice, but I could have rated it higher if the finish to the beer stayed up with its start"
"O - A good IPA, but not the best"
"O- It's a decent IPA, but it didn't live up to expectations for me. Good, but not great."
"O - Good IPA, but not the best. Wouldnt avoid this but probably wouldnt seek it out"
"$4.50 a 12oz bottle at Counter burger in west hartford."
"Overall this is a SOLID IPA at a good price. One to keep in the fridge."
"overall this is a really good American IPAs. one of the best i've had. lately breweries have been trying to go too hard and hop it up as much as possible. I like how Lagunitas keeps it real and makes a great, regular IPA"
"The CPJ"
"Overall a nice IPA, I'm going to give this beer a second shot however when I know a new shipment has come in to our local stores."
"O - Even with my knock on its freshness, this beer is still quite solid. Happy to see a full pint at a non DC-price."
"A great staple IPA; a good beer to have in the fridge for typical guests and beer lovers alike. I have many fond memories of drinking these @ A's games during my stint in Northern California. Nothing beats a Lagunitas IPA and booing the Yankees!"
"Solid IPA; not as exotic as many of the tropical/grapefruit/bitter-bombs out there now, but certainly deserves respect as a West Coast forerunner."
"This beer pours a pale amber color with two fingers of thick foamy white head that retain and lace amazingly. The aroma is strong with floral hops and some malty sweetness. The taste starts malty sweet and then becomes floral. The mouthfeel is balanced and finishes clean... Almost a little too clean. Overall a good IPA."
"Overall - Not bad, its too mild and bland. A stadard ipa really, but man the aftertaste is dry and bitter. Alot better ipa's out. This isnt terrible by any means just your standard style done before with nothing new brough to the table, and just a little to weak hop character."
"Mostly clear amber with a good two fingers of head from an easy pour. Plenty of lacing. Aroma is floral spicey hops. Taste is full bitter hops but with a fine malt backing. Less tongue abuse than many. Mouthfeel is great and carbonation is just right. Very crisp. Since Hop Stoopid came out I drink this less often. Much closer to a daily beer than H.S. and well recommended."
"appearance is golden with a finger high head that leaves a nice lacing. do i seem some sediment floating around in there? very pretty appearance. Smell is weaker than most west coast IPAs but in my opinion i prefer an IPA thats not overwhelmed by hops. Smells piney then citrusy. First thing i notice is the mouthfeel is very pleasing. This beer doesnt attack the back of your tongue and stay there like some IPAs. Floats softly across your palate. Taste is hoppy at first but then it is subdued by a sweet malt. great combination of the two. Doesnt leave a strong aftertaste. Wasn't expecting much from this brew but i am pleasantly surprised."
"O-solid IPA. Hoppy without anything too overwhelming. I could drink a lot of these."
"Poured a crystal clear amber color that looks very appetizing. The head fades fast but laces the glass and the carbonation stays powerful. The smell falls a bit short in comparison to other lagunita brews and lacks the signature scent that most of their hoppy beers have in fact its a bit of a turn off as its a bit pissy. The taste is good for an IPA but again lacks the hop mixture I am accustomed to. Bitterness is there but a bit muted a little dry but some sugar cane comes through at the end. Very citrusy with lemon rind and pearish qualities but no caramel sweetness. Overall good but I like maximus and sumpin sumpin much better."
"Overall Drinkability - A great balanced, mild IPA. Might be a good gateway IPA to get people into the style, if they've had poor experiences with hoppier, more 'arrogant' IPAs. Refreshing and laid back. Though after a couple of these hop teases, you might get in the mood for something with a bit more of a kick."
"A very pleasant IPA for hot summer days. Poured into a pilsner glass from the bottle, and it produced a one-finger thick head that reduced to lacing. It has a beautiful copper color and a pleasing citrusy aroma. Taste was bracing and bitter up front and smooth on the back end. I really enjoyed this beer. Compared to other IPAs I've had this summer I would rank it behind Bell's Two Hearted, above Heavy Seas and equal to 21st Amendment."
"Overall: A nice single IPA that doesn't crush your palate with hops. Particularly nice use of citrus."
"Clear and orange with about two fingers of fluffy white head. Sticky pine and melon in the nose. The fruity melon is more powerful than the pine but it doesn't over shadow it. Bread and caramel malts back up the hops. A lot of malt upfront, more than I expected. Creamy. A lot of biscuit, lightly toasted and caramel instantly followed by fruity melon and grapefruit that finishes bitter with only subtle amount of that sticky pine present in the nose. A fruitier flavor than expected from the nose. Smooth and creamy body that finishes with a solid bite but doesn't cloy."
"A pleasant ipa with some nice citrus and tropical fruit notes; not the raging hop monster i was anticipating. New Dogtown pale ale actually strikes me as more hop forward than this does."
"o - Overall a really nice IPA; something I would certainly have again. Nice mouthfeel and I enjoyed the fruit in the taste, especially the banana."
"this is a good-ass ipa with a subtle complexity(which i reckon lies in the malt bill) that makes you want to drink more."
"Will try again to see if my tastes change, but I doubt it'll be anytime soon."
"O- A solid IPA and another good offering from Lagunitas, this and Maximus are both definitely worth trying."
"O: My go to beer. Can find it on sale at any number of local markets, anytime for a dollar a beer. Just solid all around, always hits the spot."
"Bright, sharp, crisp and refreshing all are good descriptors here. Hop flavor explodes on the palate and manages a unique impact that is rivaled by few hop-forward brewers out there today. Malts compliment, rather than interfere, with the hop profile of the beer. An impressive IPA, to say the least. While Lagunitas sometimes cranks out beers too similar in profile at times (for me at least), this blueprint is indeed pretty tasty and a fresh IPA from Petaluma will always be welcome in my fridge. They know their way around a hoppy beer."
"O: Lagunitas flagship beer is simply not my favorite from them. A totally serviceable IPA but not one I typically order."
"O: With their upcoming expansion, I hope Lagunitas' IPA isn't a sign of things to come. I've always enjoy their suds, but this is about as middle of the road as you can get. Maybe an AIPA newcomer will dig this, who knows. As for me, I won't purposely return to it."
"Overall: A very solid IPA. Took me 5 minutes to drink, and I would have finished it faster if I wasn't typing."
"The hop flavors come through nicely. I like the Cascade hops and what I think is Chinook hops. This is a pretty good tasting beer. I recommend picking up a six pack for the summer."
"A good beer from them but I don't think it is there best."
"A straw tan IPA that could be mistaken for a much simpler beer. The nose has a good pine and citrus scent, which reminds you there is more to it. It has a surprisingly light mouth feel despite a steady carbonation. The taste has a weak malt backbone, but finishes with a good dryness. A pretty drinkable IPA."
"O: All around, a very good IPA. Highly recommend."
"-JH-"
"O: A balanced drinkable ipa. Possibly the quintessential West Coqst IPA, to judge all other IPA's on."
"O - An excellent IPA overall. Beyond the reasons mentioned above, it is great for two other reasons. First, it's cheap, at <$1.50/12oz. Secondly, it's widely distributed, so it's one of the very west-coast style IPAs that are available in MN."
"Very enjoyable, and the availability and price make this a favorite."
"D - I like this one, has a lot going on and some really good hops present."
"Drinkability: Super easy to drink. This beer will not impress someone looking for hops. However, this beer will be perfect for summer BBQ or hot night at the bar. I can say the beer style is between IPA and APA, lighter than IPA but more flavor and hop profile from APA. Well done Lagunitas. This beer reminds me of 3F Gumballhead except it has slightly stronger hop profile."
"O= as said above, better than the bottled version."
"overall, i can't ding this one too much. good middle-of-the-road IPA, great value as with all lagunitas offering. this one isn't one of their best however."
"Overall, a good IPA but not a great one. The maximus IPA from Lugunitas is more appreciated"
"O--A very good IPA. I usually like more bitterness, but this one is an easy drinker."
"Finish: Nice bitter hop still stuck in the palate with a little bit of stickiness on the lips"
"O: A very enjoyable drink, but it lacks the bitterness that I desire when reaching for an IPA. The bottle reads ""Savor the moment as the raging hop character engages the Imperial Qualities of the Malt Foundation in mortal combat on the battlefield of your palate."" I feel, however, that the sweet maltiness and the floral hops rather held hands and skipped around my palate. Enjoyable, but not the epic battle promised."
"a very floral beer. hops devour any other flavor that might be around in there which is nice sometimes but this one just didnt have much doing for me. had a ranger ipa right before and preferred that much more than this. not that this was really so bad. just a little simple profile"
"Besides Dogfish head's 90 min IPA, this is hands down my favorite IPA. Nice amber color with a decent head retention. Cascade hops shine through giving the beer a wonderful citrusy/ lychee fruit aroma. Nice hoppy flavor from start to finish without being overbearing. i have had this from the bottle and it is just as good. if you have not tried this brew then you need to get up and try it now!"
"O: A little below average for the style. I'll try it on tap someday and re-review in case this is a bad/old bottle (it may have been bottled in March 2009 for all I know)."
"a rather low abv now that see the specs. but pretty good for something that is so mass produced. a bit cloudy as it warms. orange near amber with about 2 fingers on the pour not much lace. i would expect more protein interaction but still not bad. nose of cannabis, grain husk, green pepper and subtle hints of a fruit boutique. palate is grain mineral bitter with a nice hint of black pepper spicy a bit of apple a bit of earth sweetness. a bit of resin."
"O: This is a very good sessionable IPA. I really enjoyed this one, will make this a regular in my rotation. Great for a sixer during a ball game."
"A lovely coppery gold with a dense off whit head that stays for quite a while and leaves a goodly amount of lace. Smell is piney with light citrus and caramel sweetness. Taste features a toasted caramel malt center with big overlay of grapefruit hoppiness. Drying but not quite astringent it still gives a good pucker and finishes with a lingering hop oil and presence and yummy whole grain bread and light biscuit coating of the mouth. Feel is smooth and gently carbonated. Just enough weight toe it it foster sipping. Goes down easily though and rather quickly. A good balance of abv kick and quaffability. Laginitas once again hits the nail in the head."
"Golden, maybe a tinge of red. Clear with plenty of long lived head and lace. Tropical fruit and pine resin aroma. Nice soft mouthfeel and medium body. A mild bit of acidity up front. Middle and finish of increasing bitterness. Some pineapple characteristics, but not the big citrus found in many West Coast IPAs. Leans toward the dry side."
"Taste follows smell...a bit lacking in the pine punch i was looking forward to though. Very refreshing, quite smooth, easy to drink...and at 6.2abv, a nice summer brew."
"Or should I say bitter and hoppy in a very good way. The malts and hops balance each other out to make a enjoyable IPA."
"This is such an awesome beer. I am love IPA's and it took me the longest time to love this beer. Nice balance hoppy but not over powering like most crap over hop IPA's. Nice sexy cooper look. No head but asides that great beer! It is now in my top 5 IPA's. Try it!"
"After having this about a dozen times out of the bottle, which was always very good, I finally was able to sample and review this one on-tap. As always, it's better on tap....freshe+...crisper. Deep golden yellow in color with a very slight hint of amber. Started with a big frothy head that slowly reduced to a solid white cap. Lots of sticky lacings. Aromas are a balance of citrus hops, papaya and sweet caramel malt with a biscuity undertone. Aroma is a little less hoppy than most IPAs. Medium bodied, well carbonated and a very resinous, tangy hop feel. Hop character shines in the flavor. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors from beginning to end, tropical papaya toward the end with a nice caramel malty /biscuity undertone. Finished clean and dry with a citrus hop aftertaste. Thoroughly enjoyed this IPA. Nice complexity. It never disappoints."
"O: A very pleasant balanced IPA. They hit all the right notes and didn't need to use aggressive hops to cover up their flaws. It's very drinkable."
"Super easy, great flavor, this is the easy mans drinking American IPA for sure."
"O: I've had this beer a few times and have always enjoyed it - hence the liter! I think its one of the more drinkable IPAs out there - not crushingly bitter, yet still good for a hop fix and some refreshment. A great summer IPA -"
"Mouthfeel is above average with a nice carbonation, medium body and semi slick feel. An ever present bitterness that pinches the sides of your tongue from start to finish drive this brew home. Refreshing in the spring heat of the day and well worth ordering another! Prost!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it's a pretty good IPA, not amazing but a good solid beer overall."
"O: This is my new go to beer and I think Lagunitas nailed it"
"Overall - I give this beer an average rating. If Lagunitas brought more of a depth of flavor to this IPA it would improve greatly."
"All in all though, a pretty muted IPA. I saw on the package that it was 49 IBU's, which struck me as low for style. That definitely does show. However, I do favor muted IPA over abrasive ones, so this isn't something that bothers me like it may bother some. So, I did enjoy this one."
"O: This is a nice offering from a solid brewery. A nice, easy drinking IPA. Definitely a summer sessionable beer. I would definitely buy again."
"D: Well I had two, but possibly cause the choices were bad. I like tasting IPA's to which i can compare with those that i reach for regularly."
"O: I've called this the ""west-coast DFH 60 Min"" in the past and don;t think much differently now. The 6.2% ABV is very manageable and allows enough sweetness to counteract those slick, oily hop acids and resins. Very reliable and enjoyable American IPA."
"D: I'd drink this every day. Very easy to drink with nice citrus hop flavors that don't overwhelm. Complex enough to make it fun to drink, but very easy to simply sit back and enjoy."
"O - I love this beer. It is so juicy, crisp and full of citrus hop kick. I just can't imagine a better drink on a hot day. This is what I want from an IPA. I'm fine with a more intense hop, but that cascade, grapefruit punch really sells it for me. Thank you, Lagunitas."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the rich color and big, well retaining head, and the sticky sweet, hoppy aroma. While there wasn’t anything about this brew that stood out, or grabbed the drinker’s attention, this was a well-balanced beer that fit the style nicely."
"For an IPA this readily available in California, and on the rise throughout the US, this one writes the book of what a good IPA should be. It covers all bases well, and more than satisfies this hop-head's craving for that little green fix."
"Overall, a really nice IPA from Lagunitas. I prefer Little Sumpin' Sumpin' to this, but this one is also a really nice beer and good value. I've had this three or four times now and I enjoy it every time. A really nice, well crafted west coast style IPA."
"Overall- Not quite what I was expecting... Let me down! Lagunitas has always had great ales and this one fell short. Not sure if I'm the only one that things this isn't an American IPA or not... I believe it is a English IPA for sure. Either way, VERY drinkable and I finished this within 30 minutes (which usually isn't the case for me drinking IPAs)."
"This is a fairly mediocre beer, however a good staple. I'm from PA and I'm not sure why so many people are drawn to this Lagunitas thing... everything I've had from them is mediocre."
"o) great beer. right up their with two-hearted. I think it's a little dryer than two hearted."
"A slightly bitter IPA. Not terribly ""hoppy", but good nontheless. Squatty bottle, which for no reason at all, I don't like. I found this to be better than their red. Flavorful, bitter, and crisp. Not my favorite, but not too bad. Wouldn't look for it, but wouldn't turn one down."
"I drank less than half and finished my meal drinking Atlanta chlorinated water instead."
"Another yummy Petaluma beer. IBUs are there, but muted by the overall balance. Not as compulsively drinkable as other brews from Lagunitas and maybe closer to an APA relative to their whole range. But I'd be happy with a 6 of this for any BBQ."
"Drink- It's a pretty standard IPA. Was not expecting much from a race track but what the hell it was a good beer to watch some ponies. I probably wont have it again, but nice flavors and not the worst IPA."
"O: Great IPA that adequately did justice to the Sheppard's Pies for dinner. Not the least bit overbearing, and I would drink this again."
"I've had some mixed experiences with this beer but if you can get it really fresh this is a great IPA, I'm guessing most people don't get it at it's prime but I feel this one is underrated."
"Enjoyed at the Lagunitas brewpub. On cask with the addition of Pacific Gem hops. Light and tasty. Very agreeable. Shines from a cask."
"O: This is a great IPA that adequately displays balance. A great beer to introduce someone to if they're IPA skeptics, though hoppy enough to keep IPA pros coming back."
"This is probably past it's prime, as I can taste staleness. Again,no bottling or best-by date, so I can't know for sure. Either way, this is the most unimpressive IPA I've had, outside of the appearance. Will try again if I can acquire a guaranteed fresh one."
"Poured from a tap into an 18oz mug. Nice amber color with a golden hue.Thick white foamy head about 1/2 slowly fades. Nice lacing. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Very light aroma. Some hoppy smell detected.Taste is pretty floral, slightly citrusy, and faily light on the hops."
"Overall: I've had better, I've had worse, its okay."
"A nice IPA, well done."
"Overall - A I felt the smell and taste to be a little lacking in full flavor. This may be one of the only times where I use balance as a criticism. But still, a good IPA"
"O: Had this beer a couple times before. A solid IPA. I definitely recommend it."
"Ever since i moved to California and this is on tap everywhere, I had to come back and adjust my rating. Def one of my fav Ipas. GET IT ON TAP!"
"Overall. A good IPA, but not incredibly remarkable."
"O- Easy drinking IPA with interesting flavors. Would love to taste a sixer of this one again."
"O - Awesome beer, very tasty, fresh and similar enough to Brewdog New Punk so it reminded me of home but not so similar I don't wish I could get some back in Scotland."
"O - I really enjoyed this one, I was a little let down as I was looking for another beer of which they were out of stock, so I took a chance. Enjoyed about 4 of these while watching the NCAA tourny - so these are definitely good session beers in my book. Good stuff"
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I can't believe I've waited so long to try it. It will definitely become a regular in my fridge."
"Pale glowing orange in body with white creamy head that leaves lacing. Awesome hop aroma with resin, grass, mint, citrus, and slight hop spice. A smooth ride ensues: citrus, grass, mint, light lemon, evergreens, fresh hop flavor, some resin, bitterness and finishes dry and refreshing with some citrus/alcohol on the sides of the tongue. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A refreshing, great tasting pale ale with West Coast flavors and surprising drinkability."
" Body is part creamy, part sticky, and very pleasant and appropriate for the style. This is one of the more approachable hoppy beers that still has a lot of character, and is a pleasure to drink. I can (and do) have several in an evening with no complaints."
"Taste is great-the hops shine through but it is balanced by the malts. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with mild carbonation. Perfectly acceptable for an IPA. Drinkability is great. I will have at least 5 more, just not today."
"This is my first brew from Lagunitas and it was a good first impression. A very hop forward IPA, as expected, especially in the nose. Lots of bright and appetizing citrus notes from the west coast hops. Palate has a little more balance from a decent malt presence. After a bit of a rough start, I noticed the taste really hit it's stride toward the end of the glass, so maybe I started a little too cold. Appearance is pretty typical of a hoppy pale ale, golden in color with a large and rocky head that had good retention and lacing. This tasty beer went down quickly. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other offerings."
"Very drinkable beer, not as overwhelmingly hoppy as some IPA's. Strong ABV for a sessions beer, but I could happily drink this all night and I will continue to buy it when it's on sale at liquormart."
"Final Thoughts - I have had quite a few IPA's and plan on having many more, this is not one of my favorites, but it is a good choice for someone who likes the IPA flavor without the strong hopp kick."
"Lagunitas produces a solid IPA by many standards And although this brew is a little more malt forward than my personal preference, it's overall quality and balance make it a solid choice."
"D: Definitely an all night drinker - very mild and drinker-friendly for a Cali IPA."
"D. A decent brew with good balance. Nice on the nose and tongue."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly assertive amount of carbonation."
"An easy drinking, understated west-coast IPA. Could definitely knock back a few of these, if not more."
"All in all a good beer, I had to come on here to find out the strength. As an aside I tried red Olives for the first time tonight and their saltiness complemented the dryness of this beer perfectly."
"Definitely a good example of an American IPA."
"It was a light amber/ copper color with a thin, bubbly, white head. Smells delicious, I noticed aromas of grapefruit with sugar, some caramel malt, and even a light scent of peach. When you take a sip you first experience some hoppy, pine bitterness, there is a grainy, bready flavor and some tropical fruit. The beer is light bodied with lots of soft carbonation (in a good way) and the falvor pleasantly lingers. I could drink plently of these, it's light but still full flavored and well balanced"
"Yep, a big west coast IPA. To much bitterness for me to enjoy more than one. Not bad, just not for me."
"D- Easty to drink as it goes down and the interesting flavors and aroma make this a better than ordinary IPA. It certainly has my interest to warrant getting more of this."
"D- I've had a few of these over the course of the week and I'm still on the fence about it. It's a good representation of an IPA, but nothing outstanding. For the same price I think I'll pick up something with a bit more oomf. That being said it is a crisp and refreshing IPA."
"I did enjoy this, but it's a little different from the IPA's I typically enjoy. Not a bad beer, but not exactly ""the class"" of the style either"
"Yeah, could drink a few of these, but I'd be hoping for something with more of a hop burst to follow it up."
"Mouthfeel is nice and balanced, although approaching thin at times. Drinkability is average due to singular nature of taste."
"Finger plus of creamy off-white foam, dimples across the surface but has the density to retain its presence nicely, same can be said for the thin but steady lacing streaks. Copper orange color with a metallic sheen, about as red as yellow in tint, tiny bubbles drift around here and there, highly transparent. Clean, brisk hoppy nose of tangerine, pink grapefruit zest, pine sap, damp brown earth and sour grasses, honey, lavender and a dab of chocolate not going to take the edge off, however, it's on the sweet side anyway, has apricot, peach, nectarine fruit but doesn't get tropical. Medium-bodied, has an undeniable firmness about it, the carbonation is thick and pops of languidly yet there to the very end. Offers as much mineral water and tonic water as it does lemon, grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus, stays dry, even in the face of the extract of the primary material. The pineapple, nectarine, papaya, peach fruit dry, short of concentrated. Glimmer of cocoa or coffee bean, otherwise little malt presence. The pine and flowers curiously seem short-lived too. It's almost like a sharpened knife blade but without any food on it, having not cut into anything yet. The thought keeps nagging at you that it's, umm, just a little boring."
"All in all (and let's be honest, this is the only few sentences that really matter), it's a great IPA! Where the appearance lack, the taste makes up for - and for most, that's what's important."
"Not bad for an IPA, very sessionable. Only thing bad about this beer, it lacks in strong hop profile."
"D: Pretty drinkable even with the tinge of the aftertaste. Overall, a decent selection. There are a number of IPA's I would prefer"
"I found myself drinking it much faster than I expected. Very impressed with this beer. Will most definitely purchase it again."
"Pours medium dark golden color with a good 1-1/2 inches of white creamy foam which string retention. Mild grassy smell, very light, hops aroma comes through. Taste is clean with a grapefruit, citrus hop throughout. Not overwhelming. Good carbonationn. Nicely drinkable IPA."
"Hmm--an interesting beer with a bit of age on it, although probably not exactly what was aimed for in its youth. You can feel the age, and that provides an interesting experience, but I think I'd prefer it fresh."
"Overall, this was a decent IPA but its nothing special and does not have much flavor to it."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a finger of fluffy white head. Appears to have alot of carbonation, some lacing. Nose is floral, citrus hops and slight auromas of malt. Taste is more malt-forward, bitter hops come out in the middle and into the finish. A different IPA than what i've had recently, being more hopbombs, so this is quite refreshing as a change. Medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. A decent beer but not the best from Lagunitas. (Hop Stoopid / Little Sumpin)."
"It's good, not great. Looked very inviting but it lacked any real distinguishing punch to separate it from other IPAs. Good flavor and feel but I would probably pass if offered other Lagunitas products in order to find something with a little more oomph."
"Lagunitas IPA is a great hopped up west coast IPA. Grapefruit and lemon pith in the nose, citrus rind in the taste. Lacing & etching on the glass after the half inch head leaves a nice soap ring around the glass. Clear light orange yellow. Short finish to the hops that then slowly unwinding into astringent bitterness. Better than average in every way that counts, it would be great to make this my regular session beer. Wonderful on tap at the Blind Pig in Champaign, IL."
"Solid IPA but kind of tame especially compared to others that Lagunitas puts out. Never had it before and thought what the heck, it's very fresh so I'll give it a shot but in hindsight I shoulda went with the equally fresh Little Sumpin' Sumpin'."
"D- Not a favorite, looks alright but the feel really drags this one down for me."
"The flavor is equally as clean, and the hop profile leans toward a crisp bitterness without as much hop flavor as you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. A light biscuit and graininess in the finish with lingering alpha acids. Mouthfeel is delicately carbonated with a juicy, medium-light body. Overall, this is a serviceable IPA. Not the best or brightest of the style by far, but it gets the job done in a pinch..."
"Pretty much a standard IPA. A decent, drinkable, IPA, but overall, not very complex or exciting."
"I'm going to try this IPA again with another batch and update this review."
"Drink ability is blah. I don't think I'd try this one again. If it was offered at a party and there was crappy beer, I'd take this."
"Very easy drinking IPA, I find this beer to be a solid, drinkable standby. They are gone before you know it."
"There is nothing bad about this IPA. I got into craft when it was spring. IPA's hooked me. This one in particular. Pours a golden honey, orange shades with a white bubbly head that recedes quickly. I can smell the pine resins and citrus from a ways away. Tastes very much the same. Maybe the citrusy pineapple more than the hoppy resins in the taste. Mouthfeel is pleasant ad this is one highly drinkable ale."
"not too bitter, pleasantly hoppy with some pine resins and grapefruit - medium bodied - goes down easy - a good one to end the night on."
"D - Goes down smoothly. For an American IPA, this is a very sessionable beer. Drinkable enough for a beginner hop-head, yet not too light or lacking on flavour."
"The beer pours a golden orange color with a small white head. The aroma is pine and pineapple hops with a little bit of malt mixed in. Definitely the aroma of a hop-forward, Lagunitas beer. The flavor is heavy on the pineapple, grass and pine. There is also a nice malt backbone featuring toffee, caramel and bready malts. Low bitterness and actually fairly well balanced. Easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice IPA."
"Mouthfeel: A medium bodied, easily sessionable, mild IPA."
"Pours a clear, dark golden (almost copper) color with small white head that goes away fast. Scent is very hoppy (I'm assuming this bottle is extremely fresh, because I don't normally get this good of scent from this particular IPA). I also get some very sweet citrusy grapefruit and light grassy notes. After tasting, this is definitely some fresh IPA I have here. Delicious hoppiness followed by seet malts and fresh grapefruit flavors. I also get a bit of orange and some grassiness toward the end. Finishes with bittering hops. This is by far the best Lagunitas IPA I've had. Mouthfeel is very crisp and full-bodied. Drinkability is high! Sometimes I wonder how fair it is rating these beers when it comes to IPAs and freshness issues. Because I would definitely not speak this way about the last Lagunitas IPA I had. If you find this beer fresh, buy it and drink it ASAP, because it probably falls off very quickly."
"Bought a 6-pack of this and poured into a clear pint glass. The pour is a little thin and gives a great gold to amber color, very clear and easy to see through. Gave quite a bit of great frothy white head. about and inch and a half. Leaves a bit of nice lacing. Also a bit carbonated. The smell is nice i can get a nice bit of hops and a bit of grain as well. Not too much malt, and maybe a bit of lemon. The taste is a little bland for me, at least for an IPA, i just would like a bit more punch, but not having that punch makes it very drinkable. Nice IPA overall i am quite a fan of Lagunitas, and look forward to a bit more of what they have to offer."
"M & D - pretty decent IPA. Hoppy, pine, floral, citrus. Just a tad sweet."
"d - Very solid IPA, I have no complaints."
"Definitely worth a try, a very tasty IPA from Lagunitas."
"D - Yet another winner from this brewery... A very tasty IPA with a bit of a sweetness on the finish. Highly recommended to any IPA fan and easily drinkable, offering just enough flavour that it won't overload the palette."
"Pours a deep reddish orange color with a thick yellowish white head and tons of good lacing. Smells of grassy, piney hops. Tastes of nice piney hops, some minimal malts, and a little citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Very crisp mouthfeel and easy to drink due to the moderate abv."
"I grabbed a pint of this beer at a bar without other craft options, but I think it is time that Lagunitas and I go our separate ways, as we don't seem to get along. On a side note, this reminds me of Troegs Scratch 37, which I also disliked, but to a lesser degree."
"As is, it doesn't impress me but if I come across fresher samples, I'll give it another go and see if a change in my review is needed."
"I've had many, both bottled and on tap, and this is one of the few that tastes much the same either way."
"For all of those reasons, this is about as easy to drink as a decently flavored West Coast IPA could possibly be."
"Drinkability: The low alcohol content and flavor palate makes this a pretty drinkable beer."
"The body is a touch thicker than I like, but its pretty inoffensive. Not as carbonated as I'd like either. It's pretty solidly drinkable, still. The ABV % is a nonfactor, and your palate won't get burnt out over the course of a session."
"D: This IPA is mediocre for the style, easy-drinking and not too strong. It offers some hints of West-coast hop qualities while ultimately displaying a balance of hops and malt flavors--just not at the same time. It is strikingly similar to Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA, with this smelling and tasting like an older, slightly off-batch of that other beer."
"Not a bad drinking beer, but it seems a little lean and not perfectly balanced. I thought it might be a little old, so checked the fresh beer only website to check - about a month and a half old - not too bad. But I will keep an eye open for a younger bottle and adjust this review if warranted."
"Expected a bit more of this beer."
"D: The light carbonation and great hop smell and flavor make this one eminently drinkable to me. Very good beer!"
"D: very good session IPA"
"Overall a good IPA. Not as hoppy as I expected from Lagunitas. Then again, this is probably the same recipe they've used for many years (since before the 'lupulin shift') and I think it's still a winner."
"Overall, this was a good IPA, i'll leave it at that...there wasn't anything SUPERB about it, but it was by no means a bad IPA, just nothing special, pretty standard, i would buy this again though, it was a nice mixup of my normal Stone IPA"
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent orange with a thin head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Nice lacing. Grapefruit, orange and some pineapple. Pretty tropical. Taste is a bit bitter with a nice mix of citrus and tropical fruits. Slightly metallic aftertaste. Pretty solid IPA with somewhat of a low ABV that helps make it drinkable. Worth buying again but there are better IPAs out there."
"I've run out of ways to describe my admiration for this brewery. Even their weakest beers are at very least serviceable and they've developed such a characteristic (read: hoppy) house character that tempts me to pack up and move to California. Or at least keep making the 2 hour drive and border crossing needed to ascertain their products."
"Defiantly recommend for those that like IPA's."
"Final Notes: A solid IPA. Probably not the best I've had, but it's very good nonetheless. My first beer from this brewery, look forward to trying some more."
"Drinks quite well for the style. Certainly something I'd be happy to grab a sixer of or recommend to friends who like IPAs."
"D: A little bitter for a standard IPA, it doesn't drink as easily as others I've had. Nothing prohibitive or unpleasant, just normal."
"A tasty, solid American IPA that would be a great match for a round of hot wings. Get Some!!"
"This was one of the first IPA's I ever enjoyed. Still very solid when fresh. Easy drinking, go to IPA!"
"This is a solid IPA with that bold hoppy IPA taste. I'm comparing it to Stone's IPA in one night, which not much can stand up to the huge hoppy flavor that Stone brings, but as it stands alone, it is really a fantastic example of an IPA. Could use a little more in the smell department but at least it looks pretty. Definitely sets the mood for what your about to enjoy"
"D: High. To be drunk in gallons (preferentially, sitting in a bar around the San Francisco bay :p)"
"Poured from a bottle, the beer presents with little to no head. A very nice dark gold/copperish color. There are strong smells of hops on the nose. The initial hop forward flavor is light, but directly followed by hops and light sour in the middle to back of the tongue. The beer is heavy, but smooth in the mouth. A crisp finish, this beer is very drinkable. Goes with lots of different kind of foods, it's a decent stand-by for those who like IPAs."
"I'm a huge fan of Lagunitas' APA, and this is nearly as drinkable, though it doesn't quite stack up compared to its heavy hitting CA IPA peers..."
"D - Hops dominate and are very thirst quenching. Whenever I'm parched and in search of a COLD brew, I yearn for a ""no-doubt"" hop ambassador ... this one fits the bill."
"Drinkability: this brew has officially become my default beer. Strong spicy hop profile and light on the malt, I love it. Near perfect IPA in taste. The two areas I would like to see some improvement on in this brew is in appearance and smell. Lagunitas needs to improve the head retention on this brew and possibly dry hop it to improve the smell. It's just too light on scent and head retention, that's what holding this awesome IPA back."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. What this beer lacks in characteristics it makes up for in an easy chug. I like this beer though it definitely is not the most interesting IPA I've ever had. I'm willing to believe Lagunitas can do even better than this. I'll try more of there beers and save this one for an August BBQ. On the other hand it's a good IPA for a beginner who may be frightened by a more potent elixir."
"Drink - An above average beer, but I think I'd rather be drinking their Hop Stoopid."
"Fine example of the style, and a pretty good value. Makes sense since that's what Lagunitas does."
"Beer is medium in body and has a decent amount of bitterness at the back, does not finish too dry. The forward is malty but not overly sweet. The midpalate is a little barren but the overall drinkability of this beer is quite good."
"D - I could see how someone who likes a good IPA would enjoy this. I can't get over the bitterness that still lingers in my mouth 20 minutes after I drank the beer. I just don't think IPAs are my style."
"VERY drinkable beer."
"D: Easy to drink, quite enjoyable. Would love to have fresher."
"Overall this is a great IPA that I will consider getting more often"
"d: this was my 1st time having this beer and i think it is a well balanced IPA. i'd love to drink this one again"
"Cheers!!"
"The best ""all around"" and well rounded beer, that is perfectly balanced between hops and malts. A good IPA is my beer of choice, but adding ridiculous amounts of hoops doesn't always make a beer better. Lagunitas gets it right. The perfect beer. Well, my perfect beer."
"pretty good. I'd pick other IPAs over this one, but its a very solid one. Easily available and perfect ABV. Won't be the last I have."
"Lagunitas Ipa is a beer that I can definitely enjoy on a hot summers day. This is one of my favorite Ipa when considering the cheap end of IPA'S.The apperance was a beautiful tint of orange with a nice foamy head. The smell was completely apricots for me. I enjoyed the taste of the rare fruits, and very subtle mouthfeel you get from this IPA. The drinkability for me is definitely on the high end, I really enjoy this beer."
"D - Solid regular drink for an IPA. Hops level is a little low, but that works for me in this case. The ""ester"" taste which I'm still working to identify in beers is pretty prevalent in this one and I think it works nicely."
"Really this is just a solid IPA, citrus and pine prevail in the hop flavor. There is a slight bite at the end, but nothing that hangs on. The smell is also pure grapefuit, Orange, and pine. Beautiful copper color. I could drink this one all day. For those guys that taste raisins in this beer, you got a funky one."
"D- Great drinkability. Bitter finish, extremely smooth, not gritty like some IPAs can be. Success from Lagunitas."
"D-- One was more than enough. Honestly thought very old. ABV was well hidden but there was a lot of carmel in this. No hop profile besides small bits in this."
"This beer pours a pale amber with little head that disappears rather quickly. The minimal aromatic qualities of this IPA are a slight hop presence, copper, and honey. The hops take on a larger role in the taste; dry and bitter up front and juicy mellow in the finish. Overall, a decent example of the style but I feel like, for a flagship beer from a pretty well known brewery, I should be more impressed with this beverage."
"Paired with some goat brie and whole wheat crackers. Poured into a pint glass, clear wheat colored yellow/gold. Thick white head, great retention and lacing, very pretty beer. Smell of citrusy hops. Taste clean and refreshing, light malt backbone then biting hops, citrus then dry floral in the finish. Very nice, not an overpowering IPA, very good session beer. Paired exceptionally well with the cheese."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is a nice light copper with a long-lasting white head. A bit of lace rings as it goes down. The nose is fairly strong on citrus rind. No real malt backing. The taste is some light citrus hops, orange and grapefruit. No malt. Definitely West Coast. Feel is nice and bitter and this drinks quite well. Love the below-6% abv on this."
"D: I like, but I wouldn't buy 6 and probably not order a second. Not hoppy enough, and too much alcohol esteriness for me to drink this frequently, but fairly good."
"Am such a big fan of the Hop Stoopid, I often forget about this beer these days. Still, if I had to pick only one IPA I could drink for the rest of my life, there's no doubt this would make the short list. It's that tasty and that easy to drink..."
"D - Drinkability is high. A powerful yet non-overwhelming flavor, crisp nose, and relatively low ABV makes this one go down fast and smooth. One of my favorite IPAs."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Easy to down and very tasty. One of the great session IPAs."
"The finish brings forward hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue along with a crispness and dryness."
"It's quite drinkable, but I wouldn't want more than a couple at a time. Hop Stoopid, although more bitter, is easier to drink, as is Red Racer (still my two favourite IPA's thus far)."
"Poured from a 12ozer into my Zatec Fluted glass. Glorious 3 fingers of soapy lookin, thick head (almost like I mixed bleach and ammonia). Smells like classic Lagunitas. Caramely toffee malts. Floral hops. A bit of citrus. Balanced. Taste is bright off the bat, citrus and pine, then melds into that malt backbone, followed up by a medium bitterness. Like a melding of a West Coast IPA and and English IPA. Creamy, un-Champagne like. Very guzzle-able."
"A solid IPA. It's so hard to ignore the hype USA beers get over here, to the point where you can tend to expect too much from US breweries. This beer doesn't blow me away in terms of how good Americans make IPAs. A pleasant nose of marmalade, soft malts, and a hint of pine. Bitterness is also fairly tame. This is a good beer, no doubt, it just isn't the hop bomb, jesus juice that some folks over here make US beers out to be."
"Yum. What more can I say than that. Lagunitas puts out a great product and this is no exception. As a beer the IPA is easy drinking but full flavoured. +1."
"This 6er is from Wine World in Panama City Beach, Florida. Lagunitas IPA from Lagunitas Brewing Company pours a pale copperish color into my pint glass. Smells like you'd expect an IPA to smell with malty hops. The taste is of flowery hops mixed with some maltiness. I generally prefer a more maltier IPA such as my Southern favorite Sweetwater IPA, but I must admit that this is a delicious beer. Most beer lovers know that Rogue beers have a unique yeast flavor. Lagunitas beers remind me of Rogue beers in that they also have a unique yeast strain at their brewery. Lagunitas is becoming one of my favorite breweries and I will seek them out when I can."
"D: Very drinkable. Makes sense to sell this in sixers as its eminently sessionable."
"Has a real nice amber color to it with not very much head. Medium lacing left of glass from the head. This brew smells really good. Hops don't stand out in the smell too much, and I also smell caramel and toffee, maybe even a little hint of chocolate. Citrus hops, but they aren't really that strong. you can really taste the sweet malts in this. I think its real good. The mouthfeel is good with medium carbonation and kind of light bodied. I would say that this beer is pretty drinkable, I would definitely drink this beer again."
"A good IPA. This is becoming routine Everything that is available in PA from Lagunita's is a slam dunk. I might have to make a trip to Cali soon."
"Drinkability - While nothing smacks you with originality, this is a damn quaffable beer. Very easy to drink, and honestly one I would bring to a party for friends to try. Nothing I would try again by myself, but good to know there is a ""beginner"" IPA out there I can give friends."
"Overall- A very nice beer that is sessionable and a fine example of a west coast ipa."
"It's interesting to note that Lagunitas uses short-neck bottles. Pours a hazy gold with a pretty bubbly little head. Nice lacing, too. Color is gold with just a hint of copper. Aroma is, at least at first, challenging for me to discern. All I can say is that it's got a faint hop nose, though I can't really get anything beyond that. Orange peel, perhaps. Maybe it will open up a little as it warms. Mouthfeel is lightly sticky and lightly carbonated, and the bitterness in this isn't as moderate as the Dogfish Head I had earlier tonight. Interestingly enough, I called that one a West-Coast style IPA from the East Coast. I kinda feel like this Lagunitas is an East-Coast style IPA from the West Coast. For me the taste is kind of inverted, especially for an IPA. Heavy malt sweetness starts things off, before hops finish things off. Sadly, the hops aren't pronounced for me, much like the aroma. They're just ... there. Maybe the aforementioned Dogfish Head fried my palate a little bit. Best way I can think of to describe the taste of Laguniatas is that of orange marmalade on white bread. It's less assuming than others in the style but a damn fine beer in it's own right. Looking forward to having this one again."
"Highly drinkable through the whole glass, with a taste that's memorably distinctive."
"This is a great tasting beer. Flavors are very clean. Middle of the road on bitterness but first class in hop flavor."
"D - Awesome! Very nice example of an IPA. One of the better ones I've had. Easy could drink a few of these with no problem. Not overly alcoholic at a little over 6% so it could be a nice session beer. Will buy again...Cheers!"
"D- The drinkability of this beer might be its greatest strength. I feel like I could put a few of these away on a hot day. I wonder whether my stubborn preference for Hop Stoopid has influenced my impressions of this beer. It is a very tasty IPA regardless."
"D: I enjoy this beer and buy it fairly often for the value, but I admit there are better beers out there that I'd pay a premium for."
"d = worth a try, might be your thing but i think ill keep trying some new ipas before i come back to this one."
"A big Slainte to you on this one."
"Overall, this is one of the better IPAs that I have had. I usually prefer those with a fruitier finish, but this IPA is among the smoothest I've had. I would highly reccomend this beer."
"D- Not an overpowering IPA. Nice hop flavor, but all around easy drinking beer. Hop heads will not be happy hear, reach for Hop Stoopid , but if you want a nicely balanced IPA for a drinking session this will be a nice beer."
"D-good, definitely unique"
"D - a fairly tasty offering with a nice hop mix, the feel is a little thin and not the typical dry I was expecting, still enjoyable and easy drinking, although I definitely prefer their Maximus IPA offering"
"Conclusion: The was the first beer I had from Lagunitas Brewing Co., and it's one of their finest works. This is a good place to start if you want to explore what this brewery has to offer, especially if you like IPAs."
"Impression: For the money this is a fantastic west coast IPA."
"D- why would you want to session hop flavored water?"
"Drink well my friends"
"Had this on the hand pump at the Brick Store Pub. It's amazing how nicely this beer lends itself to cask treatment. What a pleasant surprise! Pours slightly hazy to start, but clears a bit- probably just some chill haze. Grainy, rocky head that leaves some nice lacing. Gentle carbonation, but it's there. On the nose there are gentle aromas of grapefruit, orange, and sweet apple, and a hint of spiciness from the hops. The malt is purely background. The taste is gentle as well, nicely rounded. The hops are in the forefront, but they aren't absolutely dominant or too assertive. Nice citrus flavors coupled with some hoppy spiciness, and some sweet caramel malt. A bit coppery, right at the end. In the mouth it's grainy and hoppy, but the lovely understated carbonation and creaminess ties it together. Much softer version on cask , with hops that taste fresher, fruitier, and gentler. I really enjoyed this."
"Pretty bang-on for the west coast, big Cali-pimpin' style - nicely balanced, and large, but not overly so (the 'in charge' part may be disputable). Still, an equitably enjoyable IPA, one which I shall continue to revisit at will, even as more of its direct competitors assail our (ancient) shores."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight sweet malt, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, sweet malt, slight citrus, and hint of alcohol. Overall, good body, aroma, but not complex."
"Not too expensive either. I wil be on a kick to re-taste all Lagunitas' brews. I think this is one of my favs. I remember some being very malty. This should be fun."
"Conclusion: A really nice little IPA; the hops are front and center here. This isn't a stellar IPA, but it's a very good one. A little more complexity from the hop flavors, and maybe a bit more body/malt to match the firm hop bitterness, and we'd have a fantastic American IPA here...as it is, I could definitely see myself buying this. Thanks Heather, for the sample!"
"Taste, probably my least enthusiastic beer in the hoppy profile from these guys. The pale is far superior for me. Lots of grapefruit and copper bitterness. So much more dry hopping in the pale than this. Is nice that the abv stays under 6 on this one. Not overly complex, a reliable ipa at a good cost. Seems like lots of cascades here, maybe a smidgen of Simcoe."
"All in all, a pretty solid brew. I love west coast IPAs. This one is good, but not the best of the bunch."
"Lagunitas IPA is a beer I've had years ago, but wanted to revisit. It is much sweet than I remember, not necessarily all from caramel malt, but also from the amount of fruity esters contributed by the yeast and orange flavors from the hops. It was appropriately bitter, but didn't have the depth of flavor that other Lagunitas offerings have. It was tasty, but I think I'll stick with Lagunitas DIPA in the future."
"D: very sessionable beer"
"Smooth, thick mouthfeel, pretty carbonated and a real thirst quencher. Like any other typical west coast IPA but with a unique citrus character upfront."
"Some HopHeads will want more, this is very drinkable IMO. Too bad it's close to $18/six here in Canada."
"Overall, a solid IPA that is worthy of a try. To my knowledge, the shipment this beer arrived on in Halifax doesn't date that far back, so I don't know how much of an affect the storage of it at room temperature actually had on the beer. I would love to try this one again fresh and do a re-review if necessary. I still have their Maximus IPA and Hop Stoopid in my fridge and this one has left me looking forward to both."
"This is an excellent representation for this style, and by far one of my favorites. I wouldn't mind keeping a keg of this on hand at all times."
"Lagunitas IPA is just fine with me. I like IPA's, and this is an IPA's IPA. Enough hops to know that, yes, this is an India Pale Ale. Nothing really stood out, though - so if one can consider an IPA an average beer, there you go. If you're new to the style, then consider this a classic. (the label seems to hint at this idea, also.)"
"Overall a tasty and quite enjoyable IPA. A nice example of the west coast style."
"D- I want more from an IPA. I would consider this one a starter IPA. Its not terrible by any means I just think there are much better out there."
"drinkability: medium-bodied, mellow and notable hop flavor, yet slightly underwhelming; definitely drinkable, but not overly impressive."
"Overall: Solid IPA overall. Definitely not the best in the style but you could do worse."
"Pours a hazy orangish gold with a small but stubbornly sticky white head that clings to the glass like ivy on brick. Aromas are remarkably subdued for an IPA, and are almost entirely citrusy, but very interesting. The taste is not jarring. Rather, the hops are bracing for only a split second up front before strong caramel malts rush in to put out the fire. Overall this very well balanced and easily drinkable all on its own."
"Orange to light brown in color, rocky head. Smelled like a typical hoppy IPA but the taste kind of surprised me. I found it very sweet, a nice bright freshness, with a very restrained amount of hop bitterness. The hops are there, the pine/citrusy kind, but it's all-in-all pretty balanced (having tried the Hop Stoopid I was expecting something along those lines). I'd say this just squeaks into the IPA profile, a notch above a lot of APAs, but I liked it. Nice to see not all brewers trying to one-up others, this is actually pretty distinct but not over the top."
"D-A very easy drinking IPA with enough going in the taste to keep you interested. I could see having this one around in the fridge often. Well done, Lagunitas!"
"On tap at People's Republik in Cambridge. Served in a standard pint glass. Dull orange color, like a deep sunset. Moderate sized head with some good lacing. Smell was hoppy. Taste, on the other hand, was full of hops but in very moderate amounts. I really liked the route that Lagunitas took with this IPA. Make it hoppy enough for hop heads to enjoy, but smooth enough for an average IPA drinker to like. The perfect amount of hops for a beer, in my opinion. Just enough of the hop bite on the palate to remind you that you're drinking an IPA. I actually found myself thinking that I could drink a few of these, which is a great feeling. I think that Lagunitas has made an IPA that I actually enjoyed drinking for the first time in a while. Great job here."
"D-This is an extremely,sessionable beer."
"D- really drinkable. Flavors are balanced perfectly. Great drinking IPA"
"Drinkability: Overall, well put together easy drinkable IPA, I would buy this beer again, it represents the style very well."
"Aroma is hoppy, sweet, and citrusy, not overly strong, no malt present. The hop flavor is grapefruit, citrus and pine. Malt character is there but mild. Mouthfeel and carbonation seem appropriate. Bitterness does not linger. Overall this is a very nice"
"D - More of a drinkable IPA that reminds me of a Pale Ale really, just a touch more bitter. Not bad but for what it offers I might just go with a pale Ale instead. Worth a try but I wouldn't continue to buy it. It really needed more malt to balance it out."
"d: Very easy going down, just the right amount of bitterness. Very session-able. Excellent drinkable IPA."
"Pours a golden yellow color with an inch of head which is gone right away. Leaves a bit of lacing. The smell is citrus hops. I would know immediately that it's a west coast hops beer just from the smell. The taste is also big hops. Good, but LOTS of hops. Reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada's IPA. Very similar smell and taste. Mouth is full. Very representative IPA overall. Good beer if you enjoy hops."
"Overall this IPA is bright and fresh tasting. I very much enjoyed drinking it and would like to have it again."
"D- Pretty drinkable for an IPA. Nothing outstanding."
"A great drinking IPA. Great, although not complex hop flavor is given just enough malts to cling to without adding too much to the flavor so the hops can stand on their own. Smooth and refreshing, this is a great IPA you can easily drink several."
"Overall- decent IPA, nice taste, maybe a little harsh, could be brought into more balance. Not bad."
"D - Superb. Easy drinking and super tasty makes for a great beer."
"D: A nice easy drinking IPA that's not over the top hoppy, but not too sweet or malty either."
"D: Becoming one of my favorite American IPAs, this was a treat to have on tap at Lagunitas. Although it was great, it was not the best they had that day."
"This is a very drinkable brew and isn't too bitter. For an IPA this might be a little too soft when comparing it to some top IPA's (as far as hop bitterness goes). This is a very approachable brew, that drinks like a pale ale (very sessionable). A little light for an IPA, but I like it a lot. Good stuff."
"IBU: 45.6"
"How is it that I've never had this before? Hm. It pours a clear orange-amber topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises hoppy florals and citrus and some light toffee in the back. The taste holds notes of these elements, along with a good amount of bitterness and a stepped-up but o' citrus. The body is light, with a moderately active carbonation and a crsp, dry finish. Overall a nice IPA...nothing special and nothing bad. Good times."
"Amber with a healthy and frothy whie head. Leaves decent lacing. Aroma is subtle, sweet caramel and hops. Taste is more subtle than many if not most American IPAs (I consider this a compliment), smooth malts on the tongue, a modest hoppy bitterness going down makes this a full brew that finishes dry. Mouthfeel is pleasant, drinkability good. No superlatives, but this is one of my favorite everyday brews, and in a world full of IPAs that ought to say something."
"If you are looking for the most EXTREME hop experience money can buy, go elsewhere. If all you want is a very solid IPA at a good price, this one is for you."
"The consistancy of this brew is crisply carbonated and has an oily feel. This is well balanced and a solid IPA."
"Drinkability is very good. You know you're having a full-flavored beer, but the effects of the flavor are not cumulative as you drink it. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the cumulative effects of the alcohol content."
"Lagunitas IPA reminds me of the Grateful Dead's infamous ""Wall of Sound"" soundsystem. Everything is turned up to the max, but the clarity and balance of the sound (or in this case taste) is absoutly chrystal clear. The hops are exploding (but not overstated), the bitter and sweetness function together in perfect harmony, and the finish is truly sublime. You can pick out every amazing aspect of this beer with ease. It's all there, all good, and all fresh. Total homerun, I'll be buying this stuff forever."
"D-This was disappointing, and not on par with the other Lagunitas offerings I have enjoyed."
"All in all a very drinkable IPA, not overwhelming or over-powering, but it tastes really good and is a pleasure to drink. I would definitely get this again if it is being offered."
"I guess that a symptom of the American IPA in general is that they're going for too much hoppy flavor at the expense of everything else."
"D- This is an easy drinking IPA- a good intro to IPA for the uninitiated Lager Drinker."
"Drinkability - due to a good, but not too strong taste, and light mouthfeel, I would say that this definitely has good drinkability!"
"Taste: The smell makes it seem like the hops will be crazy overpowering but when you take a sip it is hoppy at first but there is a really nice malty sweetness to finish it off. I think this is great because the balance is really good but I know some people might be hoping for way more of a hop blast."
"light-medium bodied, very crisp and refreshing on a warm sunny day overlooking the seaside. This is a beer I could drink all day, really wish we got Lagunitas in OK."
"Served from tap into a RJ Rockers standard pint. Poured a nice golden yellow-orange with a one-finger white head. Lacing was excellent throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt with a low hop presence. The flavor was malt with slight hop notes. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a smooth IPA that was not overly hoppy like I would have hoped, but overall nicely put together. Definitely went down smoothly."
"Poured a very nice mid-copper with a bit of nice head and a bit of nice lacing. Very nice scent, a lot of hops in the nose, fairly neutral beyond the bitter, but with a nice sweet malt undertone. Wonderfully thick and malty beer with a great hop aftertaste that lingers for a very long time; a great clean hop taste as well. Goes down quite well."
"D- Pretty drinkable beer, could drink this almost as a session beer if I was in the mood for an IPA session"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for an IPA, considering I'm a former hophead who went to the dark side. It's not a hop bomb, which makes it an experience I can repeat again and again without hesitation."
"Pours a deep copper colour with thick, soapy white head. Lots of lacing too. Smell is of citrus hops and tons of sweet malt. The taste is quite malt forward for a west coast IPA, but it still has the nice hop taste. I wonder if the 6 pack I bought is a bit old because I'm not getting the same hop punch that I expected, but they didn't have date codes on the bottles, so I'll have to assume it was fresh. Very smooth and it goes down easy."
"Excellent West Coast IPA. Hoppy but with less IBU's than you'd expect. Very floral on the nose, citrus and fruity finish and hoppy enough for three fellas. Fell in love while living in Cali and easily one of my favorite three IPA's I've ever had."
"For some reason I've stayed away from this one... maybe the lack of date code or iffy distribution in my area (if the stoopid seems faded, that's a bad sign)... but this one seems to be fairly fresh, and really tasty. Will revisit."
"Despite the mouthfeel, this is an easy drinking IPA at only 5.7 ABV. Kudos to Lagunitas for not buckling to the current trends of dumping truckloads of Cascade hops into the boiling vats and raising the ABV to double digits."
"355ml bottle from Ormond Wine Co. in Ormond Beach, FL. Pours a fairly clear amber orange with a ring of white head and some lacing on the shaker. Smell and taste are seaweed, toffee sweetness, caramel, dark bread dough, lemon, lime (a bit sour), and a mild, citrus hop bitterness to end. Almost English in character, I'm wondering whether age has tamed this beer. Mouthfeel is silky, smooth, lighter than medium, nice bite midway, moderate bitterness through the finish. Very little aftertaste. For a West Coast IPA, I was expecting much more hops, a weaker malt base, and stronger IBU. Still, this is a solid, drinkable, and decently hoppy beer. Worth a try despite its flaws."
"taste coincides nicely with the aroma; a honey malt pokes through here. much lower on the bitterness than I would expect. as such, combined with the relatively lower alcohol content, it would be really easy to put back several of these. I could see it being a great way to introduce someone into west coast style beers."
"Finally got around to trying Lagunitas IPA, it is a solid beer. Not over-the-top hoppy, it's actually a little more balanced than I expected. Great pricing as always from Lagunitas too!"
"D: A sessionable IPA. Which is saying alot, for me, because most of the IPA's and DIPA's that I really like, are stronger and not really sessionable. This one is seems to be an excellent repeat performer. I would most certainly have this again."
"D. Highly quaffable - this beer doesn't jump up and down looking for attention - it just tastes good and is easy to drink. My first Lagunitas - a nice entree for sure."
"Its very drinkable and would be a great session beer. I will definitely be getting this one again. :-)"
"Drinkability: A fine little American IPA, it delivers pretty much what you'd expect from it."
"cheers"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, easy to kick back and have a few of these!"
"Pours to a 1/2 inch white head and ample lacing. Aroma is hop dominant as expected: grapefruit, muscat dessert wine and sweet malt. Flavor is also very hoppy and bitter, with intense grapefruit and white wine notes and balancing malt sweetness, Light-medium mouthfeel and ample CO2. Overall, an a intense west coast IPA that pulls no punches."
"Stunning IPA. Just wish you could buy it in Canada."
"Drinkability: This is one of the original American IPAs, and it drinks like it. Others have now surpassed it, but this beer does nothing wrong. A very easy drinking, everyday IPA."
"D: quite drinkable, as most IPAs are. This beer is far from anything exceptional. A good IPA."
"Went down pretty easy. It was good."
"The mouth feel is pleasant, medium bodied with carbonation that manages to be fairly strong, but not over-powering. This is a very enjoyable IPA, and while not an outstanding IPA that will really challenge your taste buds, with a very reasonable price this could very well be something to go back to as a reliable stand-by."
"D: yeah, this is definitely an interesting brew, certainly worth another some time soon."
"Pours burnt orange with a poof of frothy off-white head, leaving decent lacing. Smell is of mild citrus, earth, grain, hony. Taste brings the mild yet bright citrus hop notes upfront, honey like sweetness and bready as the backbone. Medium bodied. A decent IPA, nice clean bright flavors but nothing spectacular."
"Would definitely try again. Smooth yet appropriately crisp for mouthfeel. Looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"D: Highly drinkable, and with it's milder flavor profile this will probably be a good beer to get some of my friends drinking american craft beers. It is light a refreshing and would make a good summertime brew"
"D- Really nice, bitter, crisp, clean, really great IPA representation."
"This is a sessionable IPA. It's better when it's cold. It gets sweeter as it warms. The fairly low ABV allows more than three to be consumed before the alcohol kicks in."
"Verdict: Another typical 'Lagunitas' beer, Lagunitas IPA is solid, tasty, balanced, dank and very much a westcoast take on the American IPA. These guys must have a deal with the devil to be able to keep producing such solid beers at such an affordable price."
"On cask at Trappeze in Athens. Delicius grapefruity goodness meets the smoothness of real ale. Camra would be proud of this offering and the people of England couldn't handle these west coast hops. Amazingly easy to drink thanks in part to Lagunitas and also thanks to the wonders of cask conditioned ales."
"D: Great! Not overly hoppy whatsoever, and it was quite refreshing with the citrusy palate. Yum."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours clear and lighter cooper in color with nice thick, rocky head with good retention and great lacing. Smell was nice and of bitter citrus hops, though not as much citrus as you get from many other west coast IPA's. A bit of malty caramel as well. Taste I found to be a bit bland and average. It was pretty well balanced though if anything I found it to be too malty. Some bitter hops that were almost a little sprucey (with some citrus) but again, just a little too malty and not too bitter. Mouthfeel was right on and carbonation was great. Overall this was not a bad beer by any means, just not too memorable and I thought it may pass better for a pale ale instead."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink. It would be very easy to consume more than one of these in a single sitting. There's a good amount of hoppy flavor, but it's not in any way overpowering enough to requiring sipping."
"Wonderful beer, glad to have tried it. I expect to be adding this into my beer rotation."
"drinkability is so so - its just not an ipa that i would pick up again"
"D- Way too bitter for me to think about having more than one. I would probably not get this again if there were any suitable alternatives available. Not particularly bad, but nothing to right home about."
"Nothing disappointing, but nothing special either."
"This is my goto, everyday IPA. I love this beer and can down a 6-pack with everloving joy. I LOVE this IPA."
"A: Brass to copper in color, thin layer is espresso like head, active carbonation - 4.25, S: Solid malt base on the nose, some zesty hop aromas with a touch of bubble gum and Clementine, the nose is on the side of mild and I really have to tease some of the aromas from the beer - 3.50, T: Nicely balanced IPA, a firm caramel malt base with a some lemon zest, very nicely flavored beer though like the nose it is just a bit mild - especially for a West Coast IPA - 4.00, M: Smooth with a bit of creaminess - 4.00, D: A very drinkable IPA, though not a knock your socks off version it is a very well crafted beer - 4.50"
"drink- Love this IPA great with a slice, and has a decent abv which is fine with me."
"How refreshing. An IPA who's philosophy isn't ""More hops automatically means it's better"" like so many of the current crop of IPA/DIPAs. Not a hop bomb by any means, and nicely enjoyable because of it."
"D: this is a nice IPA with a significant malt profile, well balanced and easy to drink"
"Decent IPA, and is pretty sessionable, especially at the price point. Despite that there are so many better IPA's for just a few bucks more I don't really bother buying this anymore."
"Easy drinking stuff. Not a OMG beer or anything, but something that could easily be thrown down quickly if you aren't paying much attention."
"D - This was a pretty good IPA. Nothing about it stood out to me, but nothing disappointed me either. I was ready for something else after this, but that's not because it's bad - it just wasn't very exciting. Not bad, worth a try."
"A nice easy drinking American IPA with that isn't overly hoppy."
"An absolutely gorgeous pour ,mildly hazy orange with a dense white head that lasts forever, coating my glass with gorgeous lacework. Stellar in this aspect. The nose is solid, bright and mildly citrus-like with a blend of orange, pine and a little grapefruit. A subtle malt character is noticeable with a little toffee and biscuit, this has a mildly fruity English yeast character. These flavors are replicated on the palate, with an enjoyable bright citrus hop character up front with a low level of bitterness. Flavors of pine are present, along with a mellow malt character with toffee and a little honey, but there's something about this beer on cask that makes it stands out. Light in body with a soft and gentle carbonation, this beer finishes mildly sweet with a moderate bitterness. Thoroughly drinkable, I would not pass up on it again."
"D: Though I am a HUGE fan of Lagunitas, especially the lil sumpin sumpin and extra, I can't say I love this beer. I would welcome drinking it again to see if I like it under other circumstances, but I'm not a huge fan."
"Overall a very good beer but there are much better IPA's out there"
"Glad I didn't review this beer after the first time I had it almost a year ago. At that time, my opinion of it would've gone something like this: ""overrated and underhopped"" - again, glad I didn't review it at that time. NOW: Trying it again for the first time, this beer is amazing. It's everything I like in an IPA and more. Followed an Anchor Old Foghorn Barleywine with this magnificent IPA and it was like Heaven. (And I'd had a Hop Stoopid before the barleywine, so my palate was already exposed to a super load of hops for the eve). It's citrusy, piney, and oh so quaffable. A beautiful beer to look at and the aroma does not differentiate from the taste. Mouthfeel is awesome and the drinkability level is oh so high. My only thought on the reason the first sample underwhelmed is that it was old. The problem with Lagunitas' products is that there's no best by date anywhere (that I can find). So one never knows what one is getting: fresh or old . . . or should I say great or not-so-great? Happy to see this brewery arrive in town after a looong wait for Hop Stoopid and the rest of its excellent brews. STATUS: BREWERY REPUTATION VINDICATED!"
"It's a great tasting beer."
"From bottle to tulip. Pours a medium clear amber with moderate white head. lacing lingers throughout. Aroma is not as strong as some IPAs - taste is a bit different also - can definitely feel some orange/tangerine in there. Not in a bad way - seems to have more of a malt feel on the nose and taste - a bit of caramel malt. The best thing about this brew is it is very well balanced - good mouthfeel with nice finish - not too dry and not lingering on and on. Well made and very sessionable. Enjoyable and would purchase again"
"Overall, this is not a great IPA, in my opinion, but I have my reservations about the age of the bottle. I've never had a beer that tasting as fake as this, and I can't quite put my finger on why. I'm a big fan of Lagunitas, though, and I'll definitely try this again to see if I can get a better bottle."
"Lagunitas is predictable in the sense that if you predict it will be good, you'll probably be right. I will take the Pale over the IPA though."
"Purchased today and enjoying right now with a grilled burger dinner. Smell is great, piney and citrussy hops are present. Taste is very good. Not an overpowering IPA, it is very balanced. The mouth feel is excellent and the drinkability is great as well. Great to see this finally hit Vegas so I can drink more of it!"
"Overall, this is a pretty well put-together IPA. The flavor wasn't outstanding, but it was still good, and the nose was above average. Crisp, pretty flavorful, and pretty drinkable at 5.7% alcohol. Not ""homicidally hoppy"" as the label states, but a fair-priced, fairly tasty interpretation of the American IPA."
"Drinkability: A decent IPA, but there is something in the hop profile that hits my tastebuds the wrong way"
"D – I am not a fan of this stuff; Lagunitas has done so many better things, I can't see why this recipe is their full-time IPA."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and well carbonated."
"D= Nice Light IPA. Could be a session starter or a nice light lawnmower IPA."
"Purchased at the local Kroger in South Raleigh/Garner off of 70 and Timber. Sixer was $9.19 - great balance of hop and malt....seriously one of the better IPAs on the market today that is available at the freakin Kroger. Starts out with a citrusy aroma that is quickly forgotten after the first bite of this brew hits your tastebuds. YUM."
"D - good all around beer, nothing too in your face, maybe a bit too much bitter finish to session, but overall really nice."
"Poured to a orangish two fingered head. Ale itsself was brownish orange in color. Head didnt hang around very long. But it did leave some nice big chunks of head here and there. Also left some decent amounts of lacing. Smelled a little on the light side to me. Just that hoppy citrus. Tasted of citrus, pine. Also had a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Big chunks of head floated in your mouth as you drank from the glass. Good session beer. Alcohol content wasnt all that high as other IPAs. So you could drink a few of these and not get blasted."
"Notes: I don't usually re-review a beer simply because I got it via a different delivery method (i.e., bottle vs. on-tap). But this beer seemed to be significantly better than I remembered from the bottle (which I reviewed well over 2 yrs ago), so here's the growler review. . . ."
"D: A nicely balanced IPA that isn't an in your face beer. I had several pints of this, and would do so again in the future."
"A good solid brew with nothing to complain about really. I'm not the biggest IPA fan, granted I still like what I've tried so far, and this is pretty good. Makes me look forward to trying new IPAs."
"Skål!"
"D - A decent IPA that is sessionable. Nothing that will knock your socks off about but very palatable."
"D- Another nice offering from Lagunitas, an easily sessioned IPA."
"Once poured in a pint glass: Look: orange-amber color, white foamy head like a cloud, then, after a few minutes looks like fungus on the surface; Smell: Perfumed with citric hops, some mandarin and peach essences; Taste: Sweet malt and earth hops, the same essences of the smell, peach flavor predominates; Mouthfeel: Slightly dry and woody, medium bitterness, thick body and low carbonation; Drinkability: The most citric IPA i have taken."
"This beer glows orange. Leaves good lacing around the glass as it is consumed. It's very hoppy aroma is pleasant. Sticky hop juice, some sharp tropical fruits. Like the aroma, there's also a lot of ""hop juice"" in the flavor. Tropical, resiny, and citrusy. The malt flavor doesn't really come out in this beer. The low carbonation in this beer hurts its mouthfeel...could be a little crisp or carbonated. Regardless, this is an IPA for the hopheads out there. Like a lighter Little Sumpin' Extra, but with more prononced hop flavor."
"Drinkability: hand in hand this goes with sierra nevada pale ale as a go to bargain beer for sure. Its easy drinking and has a nice low abv. Go get some if you havent had this."
"Drinkability: this is quite drinkable to me. Bought this initially for a poker game and found it quite nice to imbibe over a session."
"A fairly subdued IPA, despite them calling it ""homocidally hoppy"" on the label. A nice pine needle hop twinge but plenty of crystal malt character too. Some more fruity characters as the beer warms come out. Overall a tame IPA that doesn't push the limits too much, but is very satisfying."
"D- This is one of my favorite more readily available IPAs. Definitley a session beer for those that like the bitter variety. When fresh, I could drink these all day."
"D: For all night imbibing. Incredibly drinkable, very palateable. Great recipe with my only complaint being the lack of any specific intensity. Also, the character of this brew really gets lost when consumed after another more powerful brew."
"Drinkability: This ended up not being a great pairing with the food I was eating, and to be honest, I cannot think of a meal for which I would go out of my way to grab this. Not undrinkable, but after having one I had the urge to grab a better IPA."
"good but not a great IPA, I've had much better from this brewer for a similar price. I'm not telling you not to drink this beer because it's good but beside hop stoopid it has something to be desired"
"This is a re-review/updated review and I was very surprised. I don't know if my palate was just fatigued the first time I had this or not, but this was excellent this time. I had abstained from drinking this beer for a few years because the first time (and only time until now) I had it I was unimpressed. However, it is truly a very good IPA and I will be drinking more of it in the future."
"Cheers!"
"D - I could see myself drinking this pretty often."
"Overall a solid IPA from the Petaluma crew that is widely available and a safe bet if ever in doubt."
"Notes: This is not my favorite IPA, but it is not a bad one by any means. This is just something to try if you want something you haven't had in a while and you just want to mix it up from your usuals."
"Overall: great solid American IPA and a fantastic score for the price. Likely to become one of my stock mainstay India Pale Ales."
"D- A really easy drinking IPA with a nice hoppy flavor."
"This beer wasn't at all bad but left something to be desired in the flavor and mouthfeel categories."
"Typical IPA dark orangish brown amber. Not much head for an IPA. I poured it pretty much straight in, and still only got a little bit of sticky white foam and minimal lacing. Fruity tangerine citrus is the overwhelming scent with some pine and sweet floral notes detectable. This IPA has a very srrong citrusy grapefruit tangerine flavor. Bitter herbal hoppiness comes through in the finish. Good IPA, but I've had better. Tone down the fruity a little."
"D: not like my go to ipa (surly furious) but very similar and boy can i drink some furious"
"Libation: Extremely drinkable, especially for an IPA. Goes down easy, one of the few true sessionable IPAs out there. This is a very nice, approachable IPA, not exceptionally complex, but it is interesting enough for more experienced drinkers. I'll be back."
"D: Goes down nicely. Definitely one I'll be buying again. Would go well with a burger."
"D: It's very mellow and straightforward, but mostly uneventful. I'm quite disappointed by this Lagunitas offering, but it's still a rather pleasant IPA with a good combination of hop varieties."
"A decent brew, but with so many other American IPAs available probably not one I will be returning to."
"M&D- mouth is a little thin but the carbonation is right on. It cones across as very normal at first but as u drink it you start to realize the very subtle complexities that come out. Very smooth and easy to drink for me but I'm not sure it would be good for a starter to the style. This brewery is becoming on of my favorites and I'm very glad we have access to it now"
"D- Another satisfying IPA with citrus hops in front."
"Would I buy more of it? - definitely, this is a very solid and very hoppy IPA. Well built and delicious."
"A thin, light-tan head exploding with CO2 bubbles. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with floral, citrusy hops. My mouth began to water instantly. The mouthfeel was medium and full of hops, more citrusy than anything else. Finish was nicely dry and refreshing. I shudder to think what an IIPA of theirs might be like. Yow!"
"One of my favorite IPAs that I can get year round. Lagunita's IPA is one of those brews I can come back to again and again and again and never get tired of it."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a clear amber color with a moderate cream head that leaves a sticky web of a lacing. Aroma is dominated by citrus and pine notes with caramel lying underneath them. Taste is the same, with the citrus and pine notes being more pronounced, and the caramel barely being noticable."
"As I pushed through the second and third rounds of this easy to drink beer, I just wanted more and more."
"Grabbed this one on tap in Georgetown the other night. Very nice, straightforward IPA. A lot of fruitiness, and a pretty nice, clean flavor that's fairly well balanced. Not really anything to complain about, this one's just straight up tasty, and I'd definitely get it again. One of the first Lagunitas brews I've had on-tap."
"Deep gold body, 1 finger white head, fairly quick dissipation, with minimal lacing. Bready malts in the nose, a bit of grapefruity hops, with same hops prominence in tastebuds. Decent carbonation with nice smooth mouthfeel, dry finish isn't too bitter. Goes good with spicy foods. Not the big hop bomb like other Lagunitas products, probably my least favorite of the IPA line."
"Copper in color, almost leaning towards brown or at least tinted with some brown. The head is respectable and leaves some nice traces as it fades. Grapefruity citrus presence dominates the nose with a little bit of pine needle accenting. Very disappointed with the flavor as an unpleasant, sterile metallic flavor is present and overpowers, or at least undermines, the pine and citrus hop characteristics. Could have used a little more malt to balance it out perhaps. Mouthfeel is fine though with good carbonation garnering some points. Overall, I could drink it but it needs to be tweaked a little more. Lagunitas is better than this beer and while I don't recommend this one I think their double IPAs are much better than this one might lead someone to think."
"D- I think that this is a very easy and enjoyable beer to drink. Not some crazy extreme standout. Just a solid balanced IPA, if you're into that sort of thing. Definetly not a hop bomb here."
"Nice orange color with a white cap, not much retention from the growler but a fair amount of lacing. Just as good a look as I remember. Nose and flavor are strongly hoppy, mostly citrics with some pine notes as well. Well-balanced - oh who the hell am I kidding? Don't get this one for the balance, get this one for the hops. Recommended."
"Clear, light amber pour with a white head that's not real tall, but has lots of retention. Yet another great beer from Lagunitas. Grapefruit, caramel malt, and a hint of pine in the smell. The grapefruit has been slathered in sugar and the malts really come through. However, the hops still power through. Really crisp finish and very sessionable."
"This is a very solid IPA. Lagunitas has really grown on me, and this is another good offering. Won't blow your socks off, but it's a good daily drinker."
"D- I'm enjoying this a lot. I'd find this very sessionable. Very balanced. I'd stock this regularly in my refrigerator if it were more available here."
"I felt the Lagunita's pale ale did a lot more for me."
"D: Very nice, approachable IPA, but complex enough for a more experienced drinker."
"Great IPA you can't not like it."
"D: Easy to drink IPA. Nothing real complex here, just a very nice IPA option."
"Overall, this is a nice IPA if not spectacular. There are IPAs I prefer over this one so I will probably not get again, but still worth a try."
"D- Drinks alright. But yet again, there is a market flooded with IPAs, and there is nothing drawing me back to this one again."
"This beer really surprised me. I've been reading a lot of IPA reviews and decided to give this one a shot even though there were others that rated higher. Wow!!! This is a good beer. Very drinkable, and a great session beer. Not a ton of hoppiness, and lacks the complexity of some other IPA's, but for sheer drinkability, the Lagunitas IPA is near the top of my list. Really seems more like an amped up Pale Ale. Nice beer."
"I'm a fan of Lagunitas so I'm looking forward to this one. Nice copper body with a light tan head. A big time hop aroma with lots of bitter citrus notes and spruce. Taste is great, could have been less carbonated and that might have bumped the score up a notch. Still nice, well balanced with grapefruit, orange and pine sap. Malt is there showing up but riding in the backseat. Great session IPA for any hophead. Not the most complex example but it doesn't need to be."
"First Lagunitas beer for me and I was moderately impressed. I didn't think ""oh wow"" but will definitely buy more of this beer."
"d-very drinkable, the hop taste without too much makes this one ideal to have more than one of, but I think there could have been a stronger hop profile in this one,"
"Since it is very thin it has greater drinkability, however, there are many other IPAs I would rather drink than this."
"D - Overall this is a great beer that is perfect for a session type beer but it seems more like a strong Pale Ale vs. an IPA as the hop presence seems a bit light. I really like the beer however!"
"Not overly impressed with this... If I get the chance to try it again, I probably will but as for now, I'm not impressed..."
"Delicious and ranks up there in my IPA's, has some qualities similar to an imperial... but not quite there."
"Overall it is a good west coast IPA with just enough bite to make it interesting."
"I love Lagunitas and they have once again produced one of my new favorites."
"From notes. Clear, copper, decent whtie head, spotty lacing, attractive. SMELL ir rich caramel maltiness early, increasing hop presence, but overall malt dominated. has legs. TASTE malt forward, but with moderately aggressive hoppy kick in the middle and finish. Some lingering bitterness, but fairly well balanced, if not especially complex. FEEL is a thick,rich, somewhat viscous texture with a pretty clean finish. Easy drinking and sessionable, if not particularly memorable."
" Update... after having another, it still has a bit of metal in the aftertaste. I'll say pass on this for a more drinkable 60 minute Dogfish. But still a good contender!"
"Drinkability: This is a sessioning type beer for me. One to take a six pack to a party or to drink watching a game. Tasty and incredibly drinkable."
"D- This is a fairly drinkable IPA but just does not seem to be balanced. The hops just don't meld well enough with the sweet, lightly fruity malt."
"D - Pretty high. This is a nice IPA overall."
"This is a top 5 IPA from what I've had so far. It was poured from a fresh tap and served in a great atmosphere. Very enjoyable pint."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Color was a cloudy light amber ( not sure if the cloudiness is from the beer or maybe I didn't wash the glass well enough). Smell is overwhelmingly grapefruit-let's hope this doesn't slice my tongue open. Taste is hoppy but not over the top-this has some nice balance."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, some notes of citrus. Taste is also very hoppy with some citrus notes. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"Overall, I dug this one and would reach for another. It's a hop bomb, but by no means a one-trick pony. Still plenty there to remind you that you aren't just gnawing on a grapefruit rind. Worth a try."
"At least the mouthfeel is alright. Dry, easy drinking, with no disgusting aftertaste. Too many good IPAs out there to be wasting time with a sixer of this one. Buy a single, be disappointed, then run back to Sweetwater or Stone."
"mid body. nice carbonation. good beer. may try again."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. A 2 finger white head leaves very little lacing. The Color is a clear gold. Smell is pretty much citrus hops and malt nothing major but a good overall smell. This a good tasting beer Citrus and floral hops up front with some tangy bitterness and malt on the finish. Mouth feel is nice, good carbonation for an IPA. This IPA will not blow you away but I find myself buying it more than most, it's a good everyday drinker."
"Overall, not what I expected at all but still very impressed. I'm going to have to bring this one around more often! Heard a lot about this beer and it held up."
"Review from notes taken on: 8/3/09"
"This brew was first Lagunitas I had that I did not care for. The beer starts off well enough, but it takes a bit of a nosedive the more you drink. The smell is of citrus--grapefruity and orangey hops with a solid malt backbone, and the taste is hoppy enough, however I've come to expect more from this brewery. Halfway through the bottle, as your palate becomes accustomed to the hops presence, the beer starts to taste sweeter and sweeter, so that by the time you're done with the first beer it's hard to tell you just finished an IPA. I think this has to do with the low resinous/aggressive hops used in this ale. The beer is probably a good ""starter beer"" for people who want to work their way up to some of the massive hop bombs (i.e. anything by Stone, Lagunitas's Hop Stoopid) but if you're looking for a beer to cool you off and remain bitter sip after sip, this is probably not for you."
"D - I could drink this regularly. Overall a great brew. Good taste. This brew could definitely make it into my rotation of regular beers that I drink."
"Drinkability: As a lighter bodied IPA it certainly makes for a refreshing drink. Generally an above average IPA that you could drink all night."
"Drinkability- Very good, almost dangerously so."
"D - Can you say sessionable IPA? This is delicious one at that."
"M&D- The feel was fine on this, I would say a small step below medium bodied with light but ample carbonation. There is some bitterness in the middle but it's rather light. The malts do a good job of washing the ipa tastes away leaving little in the dept. of lingering flavors. I had two pints of this stuff and could of went for more. A nice simple ipa that does not stray much. I still won't pick it up in a bottle though."
"Drinkability: I was a little confused by the smell, but afterward this beer was just what I expected it to be: a solid IPA with that signature Lagunitas flavor. There are better Lagunitas brews out there, just like there are better IPAs out there. This was solid, but I think I could easily find something better."
"Overall not bad, especially for the price."
"Overall I was expecting nothing less than a hop bomb from these boys and I was not let down. Worth a shot."
"This is an OK IPA, I'd probably drink it if a bar offered it but would not seek it out again."
"It might be possible that the bottle I got was maybe old or semi-skunked because this beer on tap rocks my world."
"Overall a really nice ipa, not excellent but definatley worth the time."
"Update Feb 2010: I'm adding some points. The beer is not all that spritzy and in fact is quite smooth and laces like mad. The retention is also very good. The beer isn't all that syrupy but very smooth, clean, sweet medium bodied. Yes, the malt could come on a bit stronger to balance out the vinous character in the beer, but this is a very good IPA. I think my first experience the bottle was a bit long in the tooth. This one seems much fresher."
"Slightly watery in consistency. Has great hoppy characters - spice and citrus with a floral background - perfume-like."
"D-I could session this wonderful hoppy beer. Very well done Lagunitas."
"Pours a clear orange amber color with a thinnish white head that dissipates, but never really goes away. Smells mostly of caramel. pine and citrus, with a slight mineral smell in there as well. Nothing overwhelming in the aroma, nothing offensive either. Taste is initially sweet caramel followed by a slight mineral, segue to some citrusy hops. Lingering citrus hop and sweet malt in the finish. Oily resinous mouthfeel, medium carbonation medium to thin body. Pretty standard IPA I could drink a few of these, but nothing mind blowing here."
"- solid all around, very drinkable beer, but more of a pale ale to me than an ipa."
"I was very pleased with this beer. The hop taste was more mild than the aroma indicated, but I liked the smoothness and biscuity notes. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy at the end, but overall a great IPA, and one I'll definitely be picking up on a regular basis."
"Overall: Damn this is a good one. And the pairing ideas in my head keep spinning: Mexican food with fresh salsa, Indian curries, thick grilled bison-cheeseburgers, a hearty sharp cheese plate...or by itself on a hot, humid summer day."
"very well balanced IPA (maybe closer to a pale ale). Although they claim it to be hoppier than it it. great bitterness and mouthfeel that begs to have another."
"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it was good but not on the IPA level in my opinion."
"After reading the bottle I'm excited to get this one into a glass. It pours a bright burnt orange thats very clear. The head was minimal but left amazing amoutns of sticky lace all around my glass. The aroma was hoppy but I got plenty of malt sweetness as well. The flavor was delicious. Almost perfect balance of biting hop bitterness and malt sweetness in every gulp. A vicious piney wallop hits on the finish. The beer has a medium body with mild carbonation. On par for style. I really enjoyed this beer. My tastes have started to come around to the bigger hop flavors so this was right up my alley. I can see myself picking this up again."
"D- easy to finish and id like another. ive been impressed with the way lagunitas has been doing hoppy beers."
"The smell is the only part of this beer to reflect it's IPA label. It doesn't even compare to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in hoppiness and bitterness."
"I don't know why I waited so long to try this brew. If you like IPA's, this one is worth trying. I'm definitely going to be utilizing this for my rotating fridge stock for IPA's. Nice brew."
"The nose is heavy on the citrus and the taste is similar--some caramel malt and a load of citrus go down all kinds of smooth. There's a bit of a bitter kick but just the right amount. This is a solid IPA that I'd drink fresh any day of the week."
"D - I can't help but feel this needs a little more hoppiness in the flavor. It's just a little too subtle overall, which keeps it in the B+ range. Still a solid offering though, and at 5.7%, it's a somewhat rare sessionable American IPA in a world where many domestic microbrewers are constantly pushing the ABV skyward with their IPAs and IIPAs."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability, I could finish my sixer and grab another."
"Drinkability: a great session, more drinkable then the dogfish 60 and other IPAS i've had. Tasty, on price point and refreshing. Killing a six pack of this would be a really simple operation. ABV is not all that high as well. Fantastic IPA"
"Notes: Well, I'm not all that impressed by this offering from Lagunitas. But, in all fairness, I am now doubting the freshness of this bottle after further investigating that astringency on the back half. As it is, it falls well short of my favorites in this top-heavy category. But, I will have to try and get my hands on a fresher bottle and re-review it, which will be hard because Lagunitas doesn't put dates on their damn bottles! Seriously people, it's time to start dating all IPA's!!!"
"D - As I said earlier...6 sips = 6 rings...this one was gone way too quickly...and easy drinking IPA that I would love to have few of on a good night"
"d- Oh yeah ;)"
"D- Super drinkable. Would drink 1000 in a night if I could."
"Notes - There is really no need to sip this beer."
"D: A good IPA, enjoyable, sessionable, but nothing spectacular. I could drink this all night long, but it's not quite good enough that I'd pass up trying something else."
"Drinkability- excellent IPA, I thoroughly enjoyed it. will drink it again and again"
"Pours a clear copper in color with about a half finger of bone white head. Good aroma, very hoppy. Grapefruit, pine and resins are dominant. Taste is good as well. Lots of sticky hops with a light clean malt character in the background. Pine are resin are the dominant hop flavors here but grapefruit is in the background. Strong bitterness offsets the hops nicely. Mouthfeel is good with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Solidly bitter and hoppy, very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Drinkability is good, as this one is very delicious."
"Drinkability: this is a pretty good IPA. this has more of a traditional IPA flavor/aroma compared to other IPA's that come from the West Coast, but overall a well brewed IPA."
"D- If I could find this fresh next time I'm out I will pick it up again. I feel kind of ripped off with picking up a bottle past it's prime but hey...what can you do when you don't have a freshness date on the bottle!"
"D: Very good brew, even if it was not what I was expecting it to be. Pleasant to drink."
"This is a very drinkable IPA. I do not see this one on the East coast all that often, but will have it again when I run into it."
"Poured a pale orange with a slight haze. great head and lacing. smells like a basic ipa, hops and a bit of citrus. Taste the same, a very basic hop taste. Feels nice though, nice and crisp, dry. Wasn't impressed. Did taste much better with some spicy food though. Would only buy again to pair with spicy food."
"A very thin head with an amber color. The aroma is alluring, rather heavy on hops would be my guess. For an IPA, it has a bit of a stronger Hop taste. Not bad, but not really blended with the whole. I like it, but I have had better."
"First IPA I've ever had on tap. The appearance is a bit more golden than your typical IPA. In fact, kind of looks like a Czech Pilsner. The smell and taste though, wow. I'd been avoiding this because my friend said it tasted like our homebrewed IPA (which was overwhelmingly bitter), but this beer is SOLID. Something different about it for an IPA. It's not overly hoppy, but crisp and almost lager-like. Very good all around. Definitely up there with the Stone's and Dogfish heads of the IPA world."
"There are better offerings out there, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"This isn't the best review, but this was the beer that made me realize that I liked hops. I won't say its the best, but before drinking this I would have never chosen an IPA. I'll compare it to Hendricks in the gin world. A good IPA for someone who doesn't think they like IPA's"
"An easy recommendation for a fine IPA."
"I like this beer a lot on a hot day. When looking for fine details of quality, I guess it is lacking, but this is just a simple, very drinkable IPA that I keep going back to. Lagunitas can do no wrong."
"I knew from the first nose this one wasn't going to be great. The initial pour looked good, nice creamy head nice color. But again the nose didn't interest me much. The first sip follows the nose, it tastes like it smells unfortunately. It's an IPA malt bomb that's a little bitter. Where did the head go? Half way thru the head is gone, no lacing at all, it turned into dishwater. A drinkable IPA to be sure, but in a sea of quality IPA's this one doesn't make it."
"Certainly a decent beer, but not up to the hype (at least the hype that I heard). Nicely balanced, but if you are looking for a ""west coast""-style hop bomb, this isn't it."
"D - Good drinkabiltiy as would not be a problem to drink but not overally impressive either."
"I'd drink it again but there are many IPAs better than this, but this would be a good introduction to someone new in the world of IPAs and other heavenly beers."
"Notes: For the price, really an excellent choice. I'd like to do a blind A/B this with and Dogfish Head 60 Minute and see what comes up as the favorite, as the Lagunitas instantly reminded me of the DFH 60."
"Overall, I think this is a great introduction to the style of American IPA. It won't blow anyone away with its power or hoppiness, but sometimes that's exactly what you want. Solid stuff and very likeable."
"Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. This is an easy beer to suck back and given that the hop bite is not through the roof sessioning is a real possibility."
"Poured a light amber with minimal head. Scent is filled with fresh hops. Taste has some citrus tang, a decent hop bite, and lasting malty taste. Minor carbonation and the malt aftertaste kinda just hangs there. A decent beer, but I have tried better on this trip to California."
"D - Very drinkable, with a pretty nice balance. A bit light on the hops maybe, but this isn't always a bad thing I guess. Goes down smooth and doesn't linger on the palate for too long. Could make for a good session brew."
"Overall: I don't want to badmouth this beer, so all I'll ask is ""is it an IPA""? I guess the brewer has the right to call anything whatever they'd like. Even so, calling this an IPA(homicidally hoppy even)is an insult to my beer intelligence. Whatever though. We have to rate the beer within it's given style, so the rating is going to suffer on this other wise great pale ale. I'll take a New Dog Town over this anyday!"
"Pours light amber with low carbonation and a weak head. Not much lacing to speak of. The smell is wonderful. Tons of grapefruity and citrusy hop goodness. Taste is very similar with the hops front and center. Not overly bitter and nicely supported by just enough malt. When the initial bitterness fades I also get some spicy notes. Mouthfeel seems lighter than your average IPA. I bet this would be a great session IPA."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth which is contributed from the light body of the beer. It makes it a very drinkable I.P.A., good summer beer for by the pool."
"I recall having a favorable impression of Lagunitas IPA the last time I had it (bottle) and so will give it another review next time I get a bottle of it."
"Very easy to drink especially for those not used to IPAs yet."
"A nice golden orange color with a small white head,light carbonation.Aroma of toasted grain,caramel,and resiny pine and floral hops. Flavor is balanced,quite malty at first then hoppy,spicy,floral and fruity it's hard to tell exactly what you are tasting and when with this beer,much sweeter as it warms. Medium body,crisp mouthfeel,and a good drinker,quite sessionable,and a pretty good IPA."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with spicy snacks or meals."
"D: Medium to high drinkability. Little objectionable elements in a fairly straightforward IPA. I might revisit this just to double check on the consistency of this bottle, but as is not something I would normally drink."
"-Bye"
"D- Relatively easy to drink IPA and not too powerful, good session for me."
"Respect your beer...JTF"
"D-pretty nice tasting beer for the price, has a clean after taste"
"D - Definitely drinkable and at 5.7% that works nicely."
"Feels slightly lighter than most."
"D- Relatively easy to drink. The bottle that I'm drinking was probably not cold enough when I poured it, but it still went down very smooth."
"[1-BOT;>]"
"D - An above average IPA but w/ so many good west coast hopped IPA's this would not be my first choice though"
"Overall, a great IPA for beginners like myself (those that don't like the pure bitter bombs)."
"Actually this beer is growing on me. I must have it the exact right temperature that everything was wrong. As it airs out and warms up it's becoming much more enjoyable and drinkable."
"Nice sized light tan head with a copper body. Very fruity aroma, grapefruit and tropical fruit. More of the same fruity character in the taste, with a little bit of pine and a nice bitterness on the finish."
"IPA pours a medium gold with a relatively small head that sticks around and laces down the pint glass. Faint herbal aroma, taste is deliciously balanced rich malt and pleasing bitterness that becomes very smooth on the aftertaste. Wow this sure is drinkable for an IPA, not too bitter but a ton of flavor. Recommended"
"Was at Harry's Bar in SF today and had it once again after having another brand which did not satisfy my tastebuds at all. But Lagunitas did the trick and I was free to semi-stagger home."
"This brew is very drinkable. I honestly think I found my new session beer. Very drinkable, and very affordable. I have never had a Lagunitas brew until tonight, and I have to say I am very impressed with this California brewery. Also, this makes me want to try a Hop Stoopid as soon as possible, as I've heard that one is better!"
"D: Drinkability is very high.With 5.70% ABV and a well rounded, non-palate crushing taste, this is a session beer. Price is also attractive."
"Pours a dark orange with a decent inch-sized white head on top. No retention or lacing. Pretty weak. Smells of flowers, oranges, honey, and biscuits. Mouthfeel is nice crisp. Flavor is very well-balanced. Slightly bitter right at the onset, but this gives way to a biscuity malty sweetness. Well done. I'm tasting some tart apples on the finish. This is a decent IPA. It's different than the big hoppy beers. Refreshing."
"D - Good, but could have stood to use more fruity hops and possibly boil longer to create caramelization."
"D - this is the IPA that broke my cherry and made me venture into the world of craft beer. I have had this on tap at my house so many times that my wife is tired of it. I am still a huge fan and probably will be as long as it's made."
"This is a hard one to put numbers to as an IPA. Seems more like a malty pale or even an amber? Its actually not a bad beer, just not something I'd seek out again...if I can remember."
"A very drinkable beer, good for the entire year round. If you are at a bar that has this beer, give it a try!"
"Drinkability: My first beer from Lagunitas. It wasn't as strong with hops as I was hoping, but I still have the Hop Stoopid and Maximus in the fridge to try. Perhaps this is a nice starting spot in their beer line."
"this beer is smooth and is very refreshing. i recommend it to any one who likes a solid i.p.a. it tastes kind of like a really good summit and i would drink it any day over a summit. and summit is a very good beer. over all if you are able to get your hands on a lagunitas i would take it. very tasty."
"This is a pretty well known beer and most people on this site have likely had the opportunity to sample it. It is a very solid IPA with a nice amber, yet hazy color. It has a traditional hoppy aroma. It is full flavored and does not leave a lingering after taste. It pairs well with food, especially BBQ."
"Comes out of the tap a dark, hazy, honey-golden with a fine-bubbled beige head. Aroma is richly hoppy, somewhat evergreen, promising a good IPA. Strongly evergreen flavor is richly hoppy, quite bitter but not overwhelmingly so, and subtly sweet; it gives the impression of drinking a pine tree - what a great IPA does! Texture is rich, lively and somewhat smooth. A must for anyone who loves hoppy beers."
"the pour was nice with a medium amber color with a decent amount of haze to it. Nice little head of white across the top dropped a nice lacing all along the sides and the bottom while getting stickier as it went down. Nice light hop notes, grapefruit and pineapple, with a light biscuit like malt aroma as it warms. Clean, crisp and refreshing flavor with a mellow carbonation and nice light body. Overall a very solid IPA with a nice and easy delivery. Something I would like to keep on tap as a god to beer."
"I really enjoy this IPA. Its nice and hoppy without falling into the trap of overdoing the hops. Not too bitter and with a nice floral character, this beer is great for relaxing on a warm spring afternoon."
"orangish honey color with a 2 inch white head which drops to a solid film with decent lacing. Smell is citrusy hops but not very powerful. Clean hops up front, pine and citrus; finishes dry with a bit of a bitter bite. If this was labeled a pale ale it would be spot on, but as an IPA it seems to be missing some punch. Great drinkability though, very sessionable. All in all, recommended but not if your looking for a strong IPA."
"A great session IPA from the dog. Sierra Pale, hittin the gym. Decent look, alright head, no aroma, crisp carbonation. A clean amber body provides sweet malt upfront, spicy, bitter hop slap at the end. Is that vinegar dipped Lychee? Pretty potent in flavor for a 5.7. Refreshing and light on the belly with a punch on the tongue. Kinda prickly...give my tongue the fuzzies. Another addition to the BBQ IPA family."
"Picked up a single at the Beer Stop for $2. 12 ounce stubby bottle poured into my shaker glass. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about an inch of off - white head. The head settles to a thin layer with in a few minutes leaving a slight lace on the inside of my glass. Smells of bread, orange, lemon, pineapple, light alcohol, and pine. Tastes of biscuits, lemon peel, pine, bready malt, and a touch of caramel. Medium in both body and carbonation. A simple, crisp, easy drinking IPA. I'll keep this on hand more often."
"Decent mouthfeel and carbonation, pretty drinkable."
"Final Thoughts - Lagunitas provides a decent standard IPA. The label on the front suggests extreme hop flavor (actually labeled ""homicidal""). It doesn't go quite that far but never the less a decent brew. Give it a shot."
"First time trying this and I have to say I was very impressed. Tasted very fresh. The first thing that came to mind for me was pineapple. Maybe suggesting a sort of cross between the floral and citrus notes of an IPA. Not too much bitterness at all. Like others have said, it is a little on the sweet side and not overly hopped. I would definitely get this again...seems like a nice session beer to have on-tap."
"Notes: This was an o.k. beer,but it felt a bit boring. I would have it again,but I would not go out of my way. It was well balanced yet the finish seemed a tad weak and watery."
"D: Very nice overall. If there were 4.25s available for scoring, I have a feeling I'd be giving this beer several of them. That said, it's more solid than spectacular, despite being quite good across the board."
"D- great balance, not heavy. Absolute session beer. I could drink these all day/evening, very solid IPA!"
"Overall this would be a decent lighter IPA for say, a summer time outing. It's not a bad IPA but its not a A+ either."
"The slightly rich amber hue leaves me hopeful. The smell is rather slight considering the first taste is hoppy with a nice touch of grapefruit. The mouthfeel lingers around the back of my throat. I like a beer flavor that can hold on and this does not disappoint. I could easily have several of these with buffalo wings or another spicy pub classic. The 5.70% means I could have three in a session."
"It has high drinkability and is not overly carbonated but just enough to make your mouth tingle. The bitterness isn't overwhelming and has potential to be a great introductory beer to someone beginning to get interested in IPAs."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable IPA."
"Not a terrible IPA, but run-of-the-mill for sure."
"An ok IPA from Lagunitas, it just doesn't tickle my fancy."
"D- Tasty IPA. I would have liked it to be a bit more malty and full feeling. I also would have liked more hop flavors rather than just bitterness."
"Decent brew with a nice sweet malt balance to the hops. Not alot of hops present for an IPA. Not somthing I'd seek out, but glad to try it."
"Feel is good but could be better, a little thin for my tastes, but I like thicker beers. Drinkability is very high, I could have a couple more of these."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured a clear, golden-amber color with less than an inch of bright, white head that left thick, sticky lacing. The nice floral hop aroma is not as strong as expected. A solid malt foundation carries the floral/citrus hops over the front of the tongue, while the sharp bittering hops cling to the back. Better body than a lot of IPAs, this beer is more than a hop delivery device. Very drinkable, not a tongue burner so sticking with this for several would be easy to do. If you're looking for a palate wrecker look elsewhere, if you a good, flavorful IPA that can hold up over time this is your IPA."
"Overall - decent, but by no means great."
"D-Decent beer and a nice IPA. Not fantastic, but pretty f-ing decent. Easy to drink with a bright and enjoyable hoppiness that is balanced quite appropriately."
"D: This is what I call a real West Coast IPA. One for the hopheads but taken slowly all can enjoy."
"Pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head that disipates rather quickly leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is a faint bouqet of hops, with classic notes of grapefruit. Aroma fades quckly after the initial burst from the formation of the head. Palate follows the nose, with a touch of sweet malt, but is a little underwhelming in flavor. A nice dry bittery hop finish which is nice, but the flavor profile is a little short. Light on the tongue. A touch more body would be nice. A garden-variety California IPA. Nothing to get too excited about, but will get the job done. The Toyota Camry of IPAs."
"Overall a very good beer from a very reputable brewing company."
"D: This would be a good IPA to drink more than one of. A fair smell and really not too bad of a flavor to put a few back in an evening. A little bland as far as IPAs go, especially West Coast IPAs, but still a good beer. This would make a great stepping off point into the world of IPAs."
"This beer left me disappointed. I expected some hop aroma and got none, and more hop flavor than was present. They say they used 43 varieties of hops and 65 malts. Perhaps they should stick to fewer varieties of hops and malts and let each one ""speak"" a little louder. Not a bad beer, but nothing really stands out, seems a bit muddled. Don't feel like I need to have it again."
"Notes: Very balanced and delightfully light. An IPA for everyday consumption, very nice."
"Moutfeel is very well balanaced and as for drinkability, although this isn't my favorite IPA of all time, I still recommend that you give it a go!"
"D - Since this one doesn't beat you over the head with hops, I find it to be very drinkable. Almost more like a pale ale. I'll definitely be picking up more of this solid, affordable beer."
"When the current beer world seems overrun with over-the-top hopping, this is an IPA that seems to do strong hops right without blowing you away with bitterness. I can pair this with a lot of full-flavored dishes."
"Beautiful amber color with about a finger of frothy, slightly off-white head that leaves sticky lace throughout the glass. Smells of floral and citrus. Tastes exactly how I would expect from the aromas--notes of citrus standing out in particular, leaving bitters all over my mouth. Light body, perfectly carbonated. This is a very pleasant American IPA; when it pours right, I just love this beer with a pizza."
"Drinkability Very nice beer. I could easily drink two pints of this stuff."
"D- Its balanced flavor helps make this an easy drinker. I'd drink it again, but I'm not going to seek it out."
"D: an ipa with this much diverse flavor and under 6% abv makes for a very drinkable beer"
"Overall: The tropical fruit flavors makes this IPA unique and it's kind of a breath of fresh air with all of the grapefruit/pine IPAs out there. Another good brew from Lagunitas."
"D--very generic at best. Lacks the boldness that good APAs have. Nothing in here is assertive. All the flavors are one dimensional."
"Drinkability is a bit above average."
"Overall, a solid, easy-to-drink IPA that I would definitely choose for again a session!"
"A decent brew, but nothing out of this world."
"Notes: lagunitas doesnt impress me as a whole. there are pales that fit the IPA bill better than this."
"(D) Definitely drinkable. This is a very delicious IPA. Not necessarily a standout in the vast world of IPAs but still a solid brew that can hold it's own."
"tastes a crisp, bitter and sweet, some citrus, pine, and some caramel, ends dry and nicely bitter."
"Drinkability: One of the better IPAs I've ever head. Since it is far less ""bitterly hopped"" than most IPAs, its much easier to drink one of these (as opposed to simply sipping). Very good."
"Drinkability: All in all, this is an enjoyable IPA that is priced very nicely (picked up a sixer of these for 7.49) and features all the right elements of a perfect IPA. I'm starting to enjoy these west coast IPA's more and more each day."
"Poured into tulip glass. Pours a hazy deep golden color with a half finger of tan foamy head. Good retention on the glass. Syrupy sweet smell, not nearly as hoppy as most ipa's I've had lately. Biscuitlike malts and citrus hops show through the caramel undertones. Smooth easy mouthfeel, very inviting. Very, very drinkable. Goes down very easy. Could session this beer all day long being only 5.7% ABV. Another great example from lagunitas."
"Poured a nice rich copper color with a big fluffy white head that dissipated rather slowly. The aroma was of fresh hops; citrusy with touch of pine. The flavor starts with a bit of malt up front then the hop takes over a provides great balance. The mouthfeel is very nice. The drinkability of this one is very high as the relatively low abv makes it one easy drinker."
"This is probably my second favorite beer of all time, coming up just behind Stone IPA. I love the way it tastes, love the smell, mouthfeel... The one main thing that keeps it out of the top spot is I wish it had an abv of about 6.7 to 6.9, but that me, i like my beers a little stronger than average."
"Most likely would chose another IPA over this one next time.. somewhat forgettable."
"Pours a nice amber, with minimal head. Lots of lacing though... Aroma is citrusy hops, with some pine hops in here as well. The aroma is too sticky sweet to get a good rating. The flavor is great for hops... the flavor is mainly hops, but I do get more malt than some of the raters prior... I like the beer, but it just doesn't seem very well balanced. A bit raw..."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"This one pours a slightly hazy copper color with a fluffy white head that settles quickly to a sticky white cap. Aroma here is one of citric hop without much else. Flavor is awesome...big hop punch that starts out very floral, and becoming more of a grapefruit and orange peel hop flavor. The slightest of bready malt flavors is detected in the background, as well as a little boozy alcohol warmth. Finish is crisp yet sticky, with hops lingering on the tongue for quite a while. Very quaffable and mildly carbonated. Huge hop profile...good stuff."
"Very quaffable, nice dark feel with a quenching refreshing taste."
"On tap at Papa Vito's in Davis. Poured into a frosted glass (gah!!) Yellow-orange, surprisingly light-colored, puffy white head. Aroma is grassy, fresh-smelling. Beer is too cold, so I let it warm up considerably before I drink. Taste is very fresh, citrus-filled, some piney hop notes. Bitterness comes in the finish with a fairly sweet malt base. Not overwhelming in bitterness. Medium bodied. Very tasty, almost surprisingly so, and refreshing...I haven't been impressed with Lagunitas otherwise so this is a nice find."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but I am a fickle drinker indeed."
"A surprising and unfortunately average offering from Lagunitas. Pours clear gold with an average white head. Decent pine and grapefruit aroma. Taste was disappointing. The resin is watery and the citrus is flat. Its there, but it tastes old or musty. Sorry."
"D: The big emphasis on the grassy/pine wasn't the best choice, but I can stand to look and feel a mouthful of this beer again."
"Poured a bottle into a pint glass. The color is a light copper...a little lighter than what I am used to seeing in an IPA. Pours a rather thin head that fades quickly. It's very clear and clean. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little faint. Some hops and pine with citrus notes, but not a strong an aroma as I like with IPA's. I had to give it a much deeper sniff than I really should have to. It actually tastes a little hoppier than it smells, which is good. It is still light on hops though. I think I taste a hint of grapefruit. It's got a mild bitterness that comes through. The taste, though not real strong, is well balanced. It's light bodied for an IPA, which makes it very easy to drink. Goes down smooth and leaves very little stick. Overall it's ""just ok"" for an IPA. Not as heavy on the hops as I would like."
"D - Not an outstanding example of the style, but perhaps somewhat more sessionable for that."
"A decent IPA. The aroma is really grassy even for an IPA. Overall I enjoyed it, but it didn't have the fully rounded taste that other IPAs like Stone's has. A pretty plain, average IPA. I'll probably stick to Stone and Dogfish Head."
"Im not sure why I often pass on Lagunitas, maybe its the bottles but I was impressed with this IPA."
"The big downfall is the slightly metallic tang -- you know the one that makes you feel like you sucked on tin foil? That one. It's not strong enough to deter me, but it's strong enough to notice (hence below average mouthfeel)."
"D - Easy drinking here. I like to give friends who aren't IPA drinkers this IPA, as I think it's quite accessible and might get them to begin to like the style."
"D - Not completely what I'd expect from an IPA but easily drinkable."
"D- This isn't a huge IPA, but rather a more drinkable, sessionable version. Some might argue it's a more of a pale, but I think it lives up to being an IPA. Drinkable? Hell yes."
"Had on tap at McCray's. Poured to a yellowish gold color, unlike the orange copper I was expecting. The anticipated citrusy nose and flavor were there, but slightly muted, as was the bitterness of the mouthfeel. This all led to a medium length, slightly bitter flavor which was nice and smooth. Not a bad beer at all, but still below other Lagunitas offerings."
"D- This is the first time I've had an ale from Lagunitas but if this is typical of the brewery I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings."
"A clear, reddish-orange pour is completed with a two-finger, thick and rolling light tan head. Retention is excellent, with fingers of lacing reaching toward the rim of the pint. Aromatically, the citrusy hops are exceptionally bold and pleasing up front. A second whiff reveals fine notes of grapefruit and malt. The taste is well balanced, with all the noticeable elements (malts, hops, spice, subtle caramel) mixed together to form an exceptionally tasty and obviously well-crafted brew. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied. There's not an overabundance of carbonation, but it's adequate. This IPA should satisfy the experienced hop-heads and beginners alike."
"Overall this is not one of the best west coast IPAs I've had but it's definitely a solid one. I probably wouldn't buy it over my midwest IPAs like Two Hearted, Crooked Tree, and Alpha King, but it's worthy of a try."
"The pinesol scent really threw me off."
"Drinkability: This one doesn't supplant Bridgeport IPA or Sweetwater IPA on my list of favorites, but for my taste it's probably the canonical example of a West-Coast IPA. A must-try for fans of the style."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with reddish hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is floral with faint hints of pine. It is quite mild for an IPA. The taste is like the aroma. It is nice, but more like a pale ale than an IPA. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, but rather mild for an IPA. I would certainly drink it again, however, when I am in the mood for a solid APA."
"First off it poured great golden color beautiful white head great lacing, very active bubbles. The smell caught me off gaurd I caught a wiff green olives and it has lasted the whole beer...I don't know if my smell has failed me or what but thats what I smell. The taste is great, kinda taste those olives. Mouthfeel is great some nice fizzies in there. I have been drinking this for a while and I will continue to do so."
"D: . My first Lagunitas brew and ""I like!"" I could drink a few of these with no problem."
"D- my go-to IPA when shopping at the local quickie mart. I enjoy this as a stand alone beer but like it even better with spicy foods. Try this at a Crawfish boil and your mouth will think its found Nirvana"
"Crystal clear copper orange. Bubbly white head that keeps decent retention, but light lacing. Nice piney, fruity aroma backed up by some sweetness. Slightly floral. West Coast IPA aroma all the way. Nice hoppiness, but perhaps a bit too light. Pale malts make up a decent backbone, but I'm still left wanting more hops. The aroma led me to believe this would have a solid hop presence, but this more like a pale ale rather than an IPA. However, there's a nice grapefruit and orange peel flavor with just a hint of pine. Yes, there's some bitterness and some citrus flavors going on, but nothing that blows me away. It's solid at best. I've had much better West Coast IPAs, but this one is still good."
"Had this on draft at Ed's No Name. It is a very solid IPA, nice copper color with a golden head, nice aroma of hops up front, and rich hoppy malts going down, and prolonged bitter after taste. Yum. It was drinkable to the point that I wolfed 3 pints in about an hour or so, and felt no worse for wear. Nothing really outstanding here but an all-around good IPA."
"Overall, a good beer. If your in the mood for a well priced, craft brewed IPA then this is a good choice."
"Overall a damn good IPA. Not the best in the world but really good. It was reasonably priced as well at $7.99 a six pack, which is about 2 bucks cheaper than normal at my local liquor store. At this price, this may be one of my go to IPAs. I'll pick it up again without hesitation."
"D - A very light and drinkable IPA and a very enjoyable beer."
"4.0 D: Good brew, really for hopheads like me though. Would like to see a little more balance."
"not my usual pick. was mixed in my 6 pack at the grocery store, i was lazy and didnt return it when at the register. i normaly dont like ipa's but this one rocked. smooth and refreshing it was right on ,dig? so if you see this beer try it, its real good."
"This is great IPA, but I really think it's missing something, though I can't put my finger on what. Needless to say if it had ""that special something"" it would be an exceptional IPA. 65 malts...wild. Can't wrap my head around how smooth the bitterness is, 100% late hopping, voodoo magic?"
"The bitterness seems to be a bit overpowering, making the beer slightly unbalanced. A good beer, but I like a more balanced IPA."
"Decently drinkable, but doesn't leave me craving another. Overall, a fairly mild interpretation of the style, but one that could, in my opinion, use more hops."
"cheers..."
"d. This is definitely a solid west coast IPA. The floral and citrus notes prevail with a subtle yet effective malt backbone to hold it together. Nothing extra-ordinary, but a good all-around IPA that i could easily drink a few of without it getting old."
"I'm not well versed in Lagunitas. A fairly new option here in Michigan, I've been trying to try as many varieties as I can. This IPA is absolutely delicious. Great hop presence and finishes with a delicious citrus dryness. The aroma is both floral and pine-like with some grapefruit as well. While there is a pronounced bitterness, that does not hinder the drinkability as the fruity balance is near perfect. Highly recommended."
"One of the better IPA's Ive tried. I wish we could more west coast IPAs on the east coast like this one, because this seems to be better tasting. Pours a nice golden red with a faint hops smell. Taste is very bitter but so full of hops its delicious. Finishes clean with a nice aftertaste. A great beer all around."
"Drink ability - This beer was very easy to dink but do to the weak hop profile in this beer I would not buy again. Would drink if some one gave it to me."
"Lagunitas has done a great job with this. It is a sessionable IPA that doesn't back down on flavor."
"Pours a nice brownish gold. Fluffy head that slowly fades away to a nice side clinging lace. The aroma is sweet and fruity -- very interesting smell for sure. Wonderful sweet and fruity taste. Just right balance between bitter and sweet. Great session ale and not your average IPA, very unique taste. Recommended."
"Very drinkable, if it is hot out this might work as a session brew."
"Drinkability here is very high for me- well balanced and this brew does not become tiresome. Great stuff!"
"This is definitely not the smoothness I think of from most IPAs, but it adds to the drinkability. A good session beer altogether."
"poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle, pours a clear amber colour with a thick white head that dissapated rather quickly. smells of piney hops and taste is very good with a nice hop bite up front. this beer is very drinkable I would reccomend it to anybody that enjoys ipas."
"D - Definitely a good choice for a session IPA. Well rounded, balanced, and tasty....if a bit average in flavor. Not a complex sipper, this is a highly drinkable IPA."
"Pretty well-balanced, but I was just not crazy about the flavor profile."
"Pours a copper color with a decent initial head and a pretty good amount of lacing ends up on the glass. The aroma is quite mild consisting of citrus fruits with hints of caramel and malt but hardly any hops. A semi-spiced caramel malt character comes out first in the flavor followed by a sour hoppy grapefruit taste. A wet finish for an IPA. Interesting mix of malts and hops but not necessarily what I look for in an IPA. Decent enough beer but I probably won't get it again."
"overall, this is a decent brew i enjoyed it"
"Drinkability- One of the better IPA's I have ever tried."
"reviewed on my phone"
"Overall: I tried to rate this with the serving temperature in mind and how I could imagine it being if it were cooler. All the great California IPA flavours were definitely there in spades and I'm sure this spoils all you Californians who can readily get it in bottles and on tap."
"Can't go wrong with this brew."
"Poured a clear, light copper in color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Collared into a slight laciness. Smelled of malt with a slight hint of hops. Taste was malts, some hops, on the sweet side. There was a very slight bitterness that was overpowered by the sugar. Light texture, not very heavy. This was disappointing as an IPA, but overall not a bad beer. A good beer for sitting around, and not looking for complexity."
"Don't get me wrong, this is way drinkable. Is this really an IPA though? I've had APAs with loads more flavor. For what it is, it's a damn decent brew and worth seeking out."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Decent flavor and low alcohol make this brew easily sessionable. Not the best IPA I've had, but certainly not the worst."
"I've also had their Maximus IPA, which I like even more, even with the increased price."
"Drinkable, oh ya. Not that big hop slam nor abv overkill. But rather a Three-Floyds take on a very drinkable IPA."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. It's well constructed with a solid taste and evenhanded elements."
"Poured golden amber, very clear with a one-finger head which disapated to a consistant thin ring. There were some sticky lacings left on the glass. The smell was of lemons and hops, crisp and clean on the palate. Medium bodied with the taste of grapefruit. Nice hop bite and a bitter hop finish, some malts mixed in. Nice rendition of an IPA."
"Drinkability suffers due to aftertaste. Overall this is just OK, & I'm looking for a Lagunitas to be impressed with."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers that will stay in your set of brands when you want something tried and true. Easy to drink for a very full flavored beer."
"CHEERS"
"A nice IPA but it needed more balance for it to achieve good scores from me. The ABV and lighter body makes it a more approachable AIPA."
"Drinkable and tasty, but ultimately just another good, not great IPA from California."
"Delicious IPA! The best of the three beers I tried on tap the other day at a local sports pub. It had a great appearance and mouthfeel. The taste was crisp and fresh. Nice hoppy flavor, but well balanced with the other grains. I would definitely have this beer again."
" ~ This is a very well crafted brew. I have to admit I wasn't expecting much but this California brewery has really gotten my attention. I'll definitely be sampling this one again."
"Well said."
"D: Easy drinking IPA. Could session this one, though the price is a bit steep out in these parts."
"Pours a dark golden color, just what you would expect. Head is somewhat airy, not thick. Strong smell of citrus and hops, very pleasing as you pour. Taste could definitely be a bit more, but definitely a good beer, and I will certainly have some more. There's better IPA's, but this is a good one."
"Poured a husky copper brown color with a huge head that died slowly, leaving a lace ring around the mug. A citric smell from the hops is easily prevelant, and so are some sweet malts like caramel. Rather basic in the flavor - citrus with a touch of sweetness (smooth balance) and a dry backbite from the hops. It is a good beer, but there are better IPAs and Lagunitas makes some of them."
"Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Would drink this again."
"Very good IPA, with a good price and availability."
"(o)(o)"
"MF&D - Medium bodied and very tasty. Very good example of a America IPA. Highly recommended."
"In light of this, I still detected a sweetish floral nose accompanied by a mildy hopped mouthfeel, one which did nothing fo the palate. Given the aforementioned temperature issue along with the fact that the tasting followed an Avery and Bear Republic (Racer 5), the Lagunitas IPA probably did not have a fair chance that night. In nay case, I've always enjoyed thie brewery and would definitely seek it out again under more objective circumstances. This one really needs to be treated well."
"Pours clear light caramel color with one inch off white foamy/creamy head that leaves rings of wavy lace. Smells tropical fruity malt with a citrus (grapefruit) hop undertone. Interesting. Decently balanced initial flavor transitioning to a delayed bitterness toward the back. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy and moderate carbonation. Overall a tasty beer to try with bread and some strongly flavored cheese."
"She's a goner. Bang!"
"Drinkability: A fine little American IPA, it delivers pretty much what you'd expect from it."
"Poured into pint glass, nice amber color with finger of head. Strong citrus on nose, lacing left in glass. Can't say it is my favorite IPA but would definitely drink again. Nice bitterness with the hops but not overwhelming as with some other IPAs I've had. I haven't had any other Lagunitas offerings and look foward to trying some of the other brews."
"Overall, I can offer my whole-hearted recommendation. Give it a try!"
"the last time i had this on tap i loved it. had it on tap again, but after trying many other ipa's this one seems kind of mild. i will drink it again. lagunitas does make a quality product, so don't let my quest for super hoppy beer disuade you from trying it."
"Pours a clear amber with a nice, rich head. The aroma is strongly malty.The flavor is mostly malt, though there is a bit of grassiness and earthiness in there. There is very little in the way of hop bitterness - this is a remarkably gentle beer for an IPA. The mouthfeel is decent, though tending toward the thin for such a malty beer. This is an IPA for people who don't like IPAs."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise. A very tasty IPA with easy qualities. Very sessionable."
"M/D - Medium bodied. Well carbonated which bring it to life in your mouth. A very good IPA."
"Real west coast vibe IPA but not mega overloaded with hops like a lot of the west coast breweries like to do. Great beer"
"B'ham UK"
"With an ale this worthy, I would tend to agree."
"D - I really enjoyed this IPA its one that I could drink all night long this one is worth trying"
"Not much aroma other than hops and malt.This is a average IPA. Drinkability is average. Not sure what the hype is over this IPA but its average to most West Coast IPAs, especially compared to PAC NW IPAs, Union Jack, Bear Republic, Stone and others."
"Brew pours orange with a sudsy white head. Lots of pine needles and tree sap in the aroma, mixed with some citrus fruits like tangerine and grapefruit. Lots of grapefruit in the taste, which is a little sweet, but is balanced by a dry, hoppy citrusy bitterness. Very smooth, not quite Bell's Two hearted, but a very good everyday brew for the hophead. Tasty, solid, bitter and damn drinkable."
"A good ipa with out over doing it"
"D- An excellent IPA that pairs well with a nice meal, a hot day, or a good friend. Very enjoyable."
"M/D: Medium bodied, relatively smooth, carbonation can be felt oh so slightly. Low alcohol plus no bad qualities equals a hit in terms of drinkability. With offerings like this, I'm glad to see Lagunitas around in NC. I would rank this one right up there with the IPA from AleSmith (not quite on the same level) but very close. Excellent beer in every sense."
"D- Relativly mild in comparison to other IPAs will not overwhelm the palate. Could have several of these in an afternoon before moving on to something else."
"Overall: In my bottle review I stated it was a good gateway IPA. I still stand behind that. To be a true winner for me they need to bump the IBU's up a bit. Still good in taste and pretty drinkable."
"D - I like this a lot - solid IPA with lots of hops and enough malt for balance."
"Update: Very tasty stuff on cask. More drinkable, restrained -- I think it works a bit better here. 3.95 for that serving style."
"What's with the boring name Lagunitas? No ""Maui Wowie IPA or rIPA Bong Hit? Well, anyway. I enjoyed this one in a pint glass chilled. Nose had a good mix of different hop aromas, piney, grassy, citrus and floral. Tastes nicely hopped with grapefruit and tangerine. Bitter on the palate but a clean finish."
"Not on par with other standout West Coast IPAs, but no slouch either. While I wasn't overly impressed by any certain characteristic, I wasn't hugely disappointed in one either. I will drink this again."
"Another old standard here. Hop aroma with some malt sweetness. Tastes very clean and crisp. Flavors of citrus tangerine and some crisp malt sweetness. It's a little pithy in the finish, but it's extremely refreshing. I love this beer, and since CostCo has been carrying it, it has become the new old faithful in our fridge."
"Overall this is a fine beer. A tasty IPA with good balance. Thinner than some I've had, and less hoppy than others (not a bad thing, though) but a solid brew. A good session beer to boot."
"In aroma, taste, and feel, though, it is utterly unbalanced and one-dimensional with essentially nothing but grapefruit smell and taste. It is bitter, of course, but has nothing else to balance it and the real problem for is that I taste absolutely nothing but grapefruit pulp. The feel is a bit rough and thin. This does nothing at all for me."
"This has a very smooth mouthfeel. A malty start gives away to a nice, citrusy finish and a little hop punch. Overall, very drinkable and one I'd recommend."
"Final thoughts - An awesome American IPA."
"Good drinkablilty on this one. I think it is more in keeping with the British style IPA, in terms of flavor and hop character. I would have this again, despite the sediment."
"A deep amber color, with a small off white head that dissolves away slowly. A malty fragrance hits the nose at first, then the striking aroma of grass, flowers, and citrus encircles the scent and dominates till the end. The taste has the malt at the front, with a hearty bread flavor. The the hops begin to take over with citrus at the start. That blends to a more earthy taste, that lingers on the palate. A light medium bodied feel, that thins out at the back. A slight tingle from carbonation, it leaves the palate with a clean dry feeling. This is a very good IPA, with strong aroma and taste, though a weak feel. That takes nothing away from this very good beer."
"Bottle smell is a heavenly hop aroma, citrusy and fresh. Pours to a translucent yellow bronze with a microbubble off-white head. Taste is fresh flowery hops and sweet malt followed with a sharp but not strong bitterness. The carbonation is perfect. This beer is very drinkable. The bottle says it all ""Life is uncertain, don't sip!"""
"After having a few Bells Two Hearted Ales a couple of days ago I swear that I was drinking the Tow Hearted Ale. Maybe Bells has a more citrusy hop flavor. This beer was orange to amber color with a off white head and it had nice lacing. The smell was more of piney hops and the taste added some grassy or earthy flavor. Not the over the top hoppy flavor of some IPA's. I noticed the malts also with caramel. Overall a nice IPA."
"I was excited to try this beer as I've heard some good things about it. It poured a very pretty coppery, caramel color with no head, just a negligible amount of froth that disappeared almost immediately. It had a sweet earthy hop scent that was very nice. But the taste is extremely hoppy. It hits your tongue with a prickly bitter taste and a strong bite that makes it almost painful to drink. The beer doesn't appear to be very carbonated but the combination with the hops is brutal. It's one of those beers that almost makes your mouth vibrate, which I found quite satisfying. The finish is grassy and allows you to recover from the initial sips. A fun beer to drink, especially if you're in the mood for a really strong hop flavor."
"D - Extremely refreshing and easy to drink."
"D - I would really have to be in the mood for this beer to have it. If you love hops i would definitely recommend it."
"This poured a clear copper with bits of sediment floating in it and a nice off-white head. It smelled like pine hops with some malt, like a somewhat typical IPA. It tasted strongly of pine hops but was balanced by some malt. It was watery with slight carbonation, and had a distinct but not-too-strong bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very good drink, but hardly different from Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"This beer pours a golden in color with slight shade of copper and a fine head that dissapates rather quickly. Several constant streams of tight bubbles trickle up the glass. The aroma is a nice balance of floral citrusy hops and sweet caramel malts. The flavor of hops is more pronounces with the sweetness of the malt being the first thing I taste but quickly gives way to a nice clean citrusy hop flavor. The mouthfeel is refreshing and medium bodied. Overall a very nice drinkable IPA, I'll have another please."
"(original date of review: 2/11/08)"
"As a side note, when I bought this the gentleman that owns the store told me that he thought Lagunitas was right there with Bell's in terms of quality brews. I will have to try more to decide this for myself. However, IPA vs. IPA, this is a good beer but doesn't even come close to Two Hearted."
"D - very easy to drink for an IPA."
"Translucent copper amber color with a lacing that hugs the glass - sticky icky. Citrus hop fragrance. The taste almost rivals the hoppiness of a DIPA but there is the stupendous balance of malted sweetness. This coats the mouth with a medium body and has a high drinkability in my book. I am going to have this around this spring and summer!"
"D: A good showing from lagunitas... just doesn't look like its a great one from the pour.. but it certainly tastes pretty solid."
"D: This is a great IPA, and at 5.7%, it could be sessionable. A damn fine brew from Lagunitas."
"You dont need me to tell you this. Buy it."
"Drinkability: Quite a good and tasty iPA. Nice dose of bitterness and hoppy flavors, and a balance that is borderline too hoppy, went down with ease."
"Another impressive offering from Lagunitas, a brewery that continually impresses me with the richness and detail in its wares. This is a strong, strongly hopped IPA, a bold insertion into any best-IPA discussion. This deserves mention. Really well done."
"Pours a nice clear orange color. Airy off-white head dissipates quickly. Has a good semi-spicy aroma. Nice flavor of spicy hops with some malt. Light-bodied and smooth. It's pretty crisp and refreshing, without the heavy 'pine-sap' feel of many American IPAs. Works nicely as a session beer. Will have this again."
"Knocked it off out of the bottle due to lack of glassware. I agitated it a little to release the citrus and botanical scent. The beer had a nice mouth-feel, bubbly and invigorating. The taste was standard IPA citrus and hops. The hops came on strong but balanced enough to make it a treat and not a burden. I could drink these all night."
"Poured into a snifter a crisp orange with a decent frothy head that quickly diminishes to a ring. Aroma is some pine hops and slight caramel, but slightly on the weak side. The taste is a great balance of sweet malts and citrus hops, very rich and plentiful both on the tongue and in the finish. The beer is very light, crisp and refreshing. While moderately enjoyable and definitely hoppy, it still seems a little too light for an IPA, more like a pale ale, but it is still enjoyable."
"Drinkability - not a big fan of the abundant medicinal quality, but it drinks okay otherwise."
"Great flavor! Not as hoppy as Dogfish Head 90 min, but still had a lot of good flavor. A great example of an IPA that isn't overly harsh or bitter. Very short head, beautiful amber colors. This is the third beer I've tried from Lagunitas and am growing ever more impressed."
"Well....I've done it again. I've screwed around and fell in love with another great brew.. Medium amber color with an oh-so-creamy-colored head that hangs in. Hoppity-Hops. I'm a fully converted hophead nowadays and this one has a perfectly balanced hop/malt flavor combined with some orange citrus and a clean taste that washes over the palate and leaves the mouth refreshed. I really was not aware of the greatness of the Lagunitas line and picked this up the first time by pure luck. All beer should be made this well and taste this great. Excuse me whilst I partake..."
"The mouth is slick and oily just like you like it. Easy to drink even if its a bit of a one trick pony. Great beer for any hop lover!"
"Orangeish amber pour with foamy offwhite head. Slightly subdued subtly sweet caramel, malt smell with a bigger note of hops come together and give it almost a candy like smell. Not quite the hop bomb in the nose I expected, but it's different, and nice still. Taste gives a candy like malt sweetness, and some hops, but not very aggressively so. I'd say its a mild IPA bitterness wise, and this is unique, very drinkable and a great IPA that I'd have again."
"D: Would be a good easy-drinking IPA in the summertime, good price as well, low in alcohol, but for me, there are better choices out there."
"Great IPA! Poured with a big frothy, foamy, textured head and some lace. Very nice slightly spicy aroma with a hint of earthiness. Ditto the flavor. Very clear dark amber color. Head lasts for a while. Very long hoppy finish. Not a citrusy hop character. This is the way I prefer it. Just a little bit of sweetness in the background for added depth. Job well done!"
"It's a good beer, but it's neither hoppy enough to get my interest, nor are the sweet tones varied enough (with fruit or something else) to really stand out. A solid, decent effort, though."
"Serving Type: 12oz bottle."
"A very decent IPA and one I wouldn't mind having again."
"pours a nice orange copper color with a two finger slightly off white head that holds very well with some nice lacing to go with it. strong aromas of pine, spice, and herbs. taste is exceptional, slightly sweet fresh grapefruit tartness and nicely hopped and slightly bitter. mouthfeel is medium, carbonation a tad light. very good beer, great taste."
"Drinkability is good, a very nice IPA."
"Excellent Beer. Not the best IPA I have ever had, but one of the tops for the price. Rates up there with Dogfish 60, Great Divide, and Ithaca Flower Power. Full bodied beer. Pleasant to drink. Typical, well hopped. My only hesititation was a twist off top! Now interesting enough, I needed to use a bottle opener to get it opened, but definitely a twist-off. Of course that has nothing to do with the beer quality, just used to microbrews with a pop-top. Try It!"
"D- Mmmmhmmm.... this is a good brew... drink up!"
"perfect aftertaste and boy did it tatse fresh, great experience, always fun finding these gem beers in littlehole in the wall late night food joints."
"D: The nice complementary nature of the hops and pale malts make this brew a little better than the sum of its parts. Unique and delicious with high sessionability to boot."
"More balanced than most IPA's. Hops are nice, but definitely not over the top. If you like IPAs with the hops turned down a bit this would be a beer for you."
"Drinkability: Packs a bit of a kick, so it doesn't make a fantastic session beer. But it goes well with food and I could easily drink one or two over the course of a ballgame."
"//edit: not changing any ratings given, but I'm now seeing a previous reviewer mentioning the grapefruit taste. That is closer to the sweet elements I picked out of it... I can see where he's coming from on that."
"Bottle from whole foods in san fran. Pours a hazy orange with a small white head. Citrus and hops are really strong and fresh in the nose. Grapefruit and apricot dominate the flavour, before leading to a refreshingly crisp finish. Holy crap, this is excellent stuff!"
"I tried this beer with a group of my buddies at work and we all came to the same conclusion, this beer tast just like grapefruit! This is ok as long as you are a grapefruit lover, however not one of us are. For the price you can get a much better IPA. If you want to save money, buy a bottle of grapfruit juice and add vodka!"
"Pours a clear amber with a nice crème head that falls but leaves lots of lace. The nose is that intense piney perfume. Flavor is hoppy, but a bit of a tart edge hits me and I can't say I like it that much. As I dwell on it, it seems almost wood like. Interesting? Yes. My favorite? No. Feel has a slightly higher level of carbonation to it that gives a bit of a bite and the liquid is well bodied. Overall this is a nice IPA, but that slightly woody tart thing that is going on kind of knocks it down a bit in my book."
"From a short, fat, 12oz bottle copped singly from Total Wine and More in Union, pours a beautiful golden-amber color with an impressive headgood start smell is very hoppy nice presence coming through crisp, clear, and inviting Taste was really great caramel and bready hoppiness with butter flavors crisp, clean, no bitterness awesome IPA first-ever brew from Lagunitas and was really impressed surprised I dont hear more from this company Drinkability was likewise great went down smooth without any acidic or bitter aftertones present A great example of the style one of the better American IPAs out there Definitely Recommended"
"pours a beautiful copper honey color with a big white cloudy head, lots of carbonation present. smells good, really good, flowery hop notes with piney hops mixed in. very complex smell, taste is good first it seems bitter, followed by a slight touch of sweetness, of course it is very hoppy, but a piney/bitter hop not, not so much as citrusy or flowery. mouthfeel is decent and drinkability is ok, its a little to bitter, atleast by itself, i'm sure paired with the right food it would be easier"
"D - Very drinkable! I could see drinking this all night. A good example of the style"
"-Oelergud"
"Thanks to Tom with the Carolina brewmasters club for sharing this with me at the christmas party. One of the first i tried that night so my palate wasn't shot yet. Nice hoppy flavor that could be a double IPA. Some fruit and citrus smell and taste. Medium copper color, easy to consume. Nothing too excitng, but no flaws either."
"Overall a pleasant IPA with nice balance and solid drinkability."
"not bottle conditioned. a serviceable, sessionable, but uninspired concoction. worth a try, but not really recommended."
"Supremely drinkable WC IPA, definitely want more than one or two of these. Underrated."
"D- This is a good session beer, very drinkable without being overly alcoholic."
"Drinkability: Tasty IPA. Hops flavors run perfectly with the malt. The balance in this brew enhanced its drinkability. Good session IPA."
"I like Lagunitas but I've never been crazy about their beers. Solid but not extraordinary has always been my impression. But having this fresh keg is a treat. An IPA I always thought was kind of average in it's style/category is actually really above my expectations. I think I finally get what others have been telling me for a long time. Excellent beer!"
"I really have always liked this IPA... really should be more of a presence in my fridge, but I tend to overlook... I will try and not make that mistake anymore. I really could session this one.. if I paced myself a bit."
"Overall this IPA didn't do it for me. A great a looker and smell, but the steering became loose and clunky after that. I must say, this ale is very reminiscent of an English IPA IMHO. The maltiness was more prevalent and the hops were toned down from what I expected from a California born IPA. Good, but not very good."
"D - Pretty disappointing, actually. Didn't live up to other IPA's I've had in the past, and the hop aroma and flavor was almost non-existent. I'd like to try a bottle sometime with a freshness date to re-evaulate, because I wasn't too impressed with this brew on tap."
"This pours a rich copper with a medium volume fluffy off white head. The head this after a bit but not bad. Nice sharp aroma, a bit dank and grassy melds with the citrusy hop. There is a distinct haze in the beer, like disticnt particles, not a big deal to me but there none the less. It is a nice drinking IPA as the malt is prevalent enough to balance. A good quaffer, would love to have this as a standard."
"Drinking a bomber of this that was gift. Poured it into a pint glass. It's a very inviting golden-copper with a rocky white head. Lots of sticky lacing on the side of glass. Aromas of piny hops, a nice woody smell, plus a bready, yeasty tone. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Flavors are complex, too: starts with a nice bite from the hops, then the bitterness on the middle of tongue. Finishes clean with a malty touch, then ultimately ends with a lingering hoppy bitterness. Moderate mouthfeel appropriate to the style. A very drinkable IPA - not your extreme, over-the-top hop bomb, but a steady, complex drink that's continually enjoyable."
"Strong enough to have a little buzz going after about two bottles."
"This beer has a striking new penny copper colour and throws off a nice soapy tan head. The nose is sharp and carries a bit of pine and mulched leaves and roots with sweet smelling malt layers and slight grapefruit underneath. Pretty mellow. The taste comes in sweet and bubbly with a wave of earthy dryness washing in behind it. Initially, there is a sweetness that stands out and slight vegetable flavours as well as the aforementioned pine come in behind. The mouthfeel is fizzy which works well in my opinion. A rather gentle dryness comes through in the finish. Overall this thing is very well balanced. There is nothing outrageous or exaggerated. All of the elements come together and make a tasty beer that is very drinkable and satisfying. I say well done."
"A good, solid IPA. Pours a coppery amber color, slightly cloudy with a medium sized slightly off white head. Head retention is fair and lacing is fairly light. Nice piney hops smell. The taste is good: piney and floral hops , crisp rather than oily taste and mouthfeel. The hops predominate but they are not overwhelming,. There is some balance here for the less enthusiastic hopheads. Didn't notice any strong citrus taste like many flavorful IPAs. Overall mouthfeel is fairly good, light but not too watery. Drinkability is good. This is a fairly mild but still hoppy IPA. At 5.7 abv, I would consider it sessionable. I have liked every Lagunitas beer I have had so far."
"Overall a very decent IPA...I suggest a trial"
"Pours a nice copper-amber color with a one-finger head. Aroma is mostly malt with a slight hints of hops. Taste is grassy and hoppy upfront with a toasty finish. It seems quite balanced for an IPA. A second sip confirms a nice hop bitterness in the back and toasty notes. I can't honestly say anything bad about this IPA. It reminds me more of a British IPA though. Balanced and sessionable."
"D - For how inoffensive it is, I'd say fairly high, I could put several of these back and not pay much attention to it. Would definitely pick it up over a water-lager if nothing else was available, but I can't say I'll be seeking it out again. I wouldn't recommend it nor would I bash it, it's take it or leave it here."
"A wonderful IPA. Up there with Speakeasy, Founders, and Stone."
"On the whole, this is a well balanced, inoffensive IPA. The color is a nice mellow orange with a cloudy, milky quality and an adequately frothy head. The aroma of this beer is probably the highlight. Taking a deep breath indicates how well balanced the beer really is. This beer is not overly hoppy, but is well balanced and rounds out well on the back-end."
"This poured a nice slightly cloudy dark orange with lots of head and lacing, quite nice. Smell was hoppy, with some malts in there too. Flavor was quite good, hops were dominant but there were malts in there as well balancing out this brew quite nicely. It is slightly smoother and easier to drink than most IPAs as the hops are not as aggressive. But still the hops are present enough to make this a good enjoyable IPA."
"Finish is well balanced with a bitter-sweet lingering. Easy goin down and a pretty decent IPA."
"Drinkability- For style this beer was pretty much spot on, not my favorite IPA, but a good one. I'm going to try some of the other Lagunitas products before I revisit this one again. I would drink it again."
"D - Had it before, will have it again. A nice IPA from the locals. Certainly worth having if you see it."
"Average across the board and completely what I was expecting. Poured a medium orange bronze colour with a a white, soapy head. Smelled of pine sap and grapefruit rind. Tasted of pine sap and grapefruit rind with a touch a maltiness. Another hoppy American IPA of which there are thousands (well, probably hundreds, but you know what I mean). Not a bad beer, but this style is simply so over-done. A decent American IPA nonetheless, provided you enjoy the style."
"Overall a very good American IPA with hops everywhere, but a significantly different taste than other IPAs, a very enjoyable different taste. I have 5 more to try and I look forward to them."
"The hops come to the front, as expected. Resin, but not excessivly, coats the mouth. Make sure this is the last beer of the night, because anything after it will not taste the same. Dry finish and very drinkable. Not one of the strongest IPA's I've had, but a good session beer for an IPA fan like myself."
"The drinkability on this one is pretty good for an IPA. In general, IPAs aren't very drinkable for me, but this one is pretty easy to handle for even moderately experienced beer drinkers. I would recommend this to anyone who likes amber ales and wants to try IPAs."
"Average American IPA in my opinion"
"Not too much to compliment or rip on this beer about.Both smell and taste yields to peach.It is smooth with that same peachy finish.I would recommend to try one time but not to get your hopes of it's a pretty average ale.Personally I would drink if offered but I doubt I would ever again purchase this product."
"D = A very nice beer indeed. I intended to sip and enjoy, but after 5 minutes, it went down just too easily. I didn't pair it with anything, so I have no recommendation on that as of yet, but I do have 5 more in the fridge."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is sweet malt and a good dose of citrusy hops. The taste is much like the smell in that it features a nice balance of malt and hops. Like most American IPA's, the hops certainly steal most of the spotlight. Overall, this is a very good IPA that is highly recommended for all the hop-heads out there."
"Worth a try, but if you are serious about your hops, stick with Two-Hearted or Racer."
"Resiny pine hop flavors leave a slick oily finish on the tongue. Grapefruit notes are detected in the bitterness. Caramel and biscuit malt notes fall in behind the oily hop profile. Slick mouthfeel with a nice twang of hop bitterness in the finish and a fruity aftertaste. All about the hops here. A very nice session ipa--one of the best out there."
"Usually if I can get this, I can get something I like even better...but I have on occasion had more than two of this beer and would gladly do so again."
"All in all an enjoyable IPA. A nice snappy but not overly abrasive bitterness balanced with enough malt character to keep the beer from being one-sided."
"Sampled at Stubbie, in Gainesville, FL. Attractive, spare labeling. Appearance is light copper in color, smallish head with decent retention and little lacing. Smell is very standard for an American IPA: pine, citrus. Taste is along the same lines, but the hop character is not ""juicy"" - rather, dry. Decently balanced as far as malt/bitterness. Medium body, well-carbonated. Decent IPA."
"music: napalm death - the great and the good"
"This brew poured a light brown, with a small vanishing head. Smooth malts and citrusy hops dominated the aromas- not too strong but definately there. Mouthfeel was light and very well carbonated. The hops had no real flavor here, maybe due to the lack of malts in the equation- they were simply just bitterness in liquid form. This brew seemed like it had been watered down, like a macro with some added hops- i was dissapointed. i had been looking for a lower ABV session IPA, and this one seemed to fit the bill- but no go."
"Poured clear amber with a small off white fizzy head that mostly diminished. Also, no indiction of lace left on glass. The aroma was subtle. Hints of cereal, toffee and grapefruit came through. The flavor began with a light sweet caramel and white bread that was balanced out with a dry and light hoppy bitter and acidic finish. The fizzy carbonation threw me off a little. Overall, this was not my bag and the label was deceiving. However, IMO this is a good IPA to recommend people who are starting to experiment with this style."
"served on-tap at rocks bar in chicago, this was a clear amber in color. nose was roasty, fruity, nutty, and resiny. pretty well-balanced between the medium malty sweetness and moderate hop bitterness. medium-bodied. definitely a pleasant find in your average chicago bar, though this place was much better than most. quite drinkable at 5.7% as well."
"For a West Coast IPA, I was really surprised with how well balanced this beer was. While it may not smack you in the face in ways that many of its counterparts do, it is still a flavorful and refreshing brew. This said, it definitely ranks as one of the most drinkable IPA's I have sampled and would be a perfect summertime session beer."
"D: A very drinkable IPA. It's tasty yet a bit in the light side. A great and refreshing IPA for a warm summer evening. This beer has a soft spot in my heart since it's one of the first craft beers that I fell for. Thursday afternoon 4:20's at the brewery in Petaluma were a great time and this beer was a big part of that."
"Haven't seen this on tap in Connecticut before and it was a happy experience. The color was similar to iced tea with a smallish head and reasonable lacing. Sweet floral pine aroma, even a little mint in there. The taste is a solid hops, tastefully sweet. It has a fairly thick consistency, but not heavy at all. Very nicely carbonated. There is a woodsy quality, a little beyond grassy, and a little tartness that leans toward peach flavor. Mildly dry hoppy aftertaste but seems pretty darn drinkable. Another hit from the Lagunitas crew!"
"D-A decent but not great IPA. The hops are the stronger flavour but there is enough of a balance. I would like a little more of both though in my IPAs. Usually places that sell this will serve better IPAs."
"I'm fairly sure it's domestic though. I'm curious as to why the salespeople thought it was Indian, was it the phrase ""From Petaluma to Bombay"" on the six-pack holder? Or perhaps just ""India Pale Ale"" I'm just not sure. In fact if your reading this review and you know something I don't feel free to let me know."
"This beer pours a foamy head. It is a nice golden amber color. The smell is a little hoppy and the mouthfeel lingers for a while on the top and back of the mouth. This beer is a little more on the malty side than hoppy side for an IPA. I will try again to see if it it was just batch I was tasting."
"My personal favorite beer."
"Good IPA, and one with an appropriately assertive hop presence."
"Pours a pale orange color with a white head that goes away quick. A dry hopped aroma, with very small grapefruit notes in the nose. Tastes a bit sweet and a bitter end. A little piney even. It has a dry bitter aftertaste, but very smooth. A nice IPA, a nice bitter, and yet, not to extreme."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin off white head,with excellent retention,and lacing.Aroma is a creamy citrus. Medium bodied,and crisp with just the right amount of carbionation. Taste was hopped just right for me. Sweet up front with a tangy grapefruit finish. Recommended!"
"Clear almost golden yellow with a sticky off-white head that rose up fast at first and lasted the whole glass. The smell is slightly hoppy and sweet. The taste is hoppy but not quite homicidally hoppy as the label indicates but it is bitter. The carbonation seems a little low but makes the drinkability go up. This stuff goes down smooth."
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered copper with amber tones. Large, foamy, off-white head lasts and leaves nice thick lacing. Aroma reveals citrus hops; grapefruit, pineapple, suds, cream. Distant malty backbone and yeasty notes  parmesan, esters. Mouthfeel is fizzy and crisp with a light-medium body. Flavor is warm and surprisingly malty  butter and cookie dough hold a strong presence along with floral hops, orange, and a tinge of grapefruit. Stronger bitter hops in the finish. Aftertaste is lightly bitter."
"12oz bottle. Pours a medium copper that is just about opaque with a decent head and excellent lacing. Decent aroma of hops. The taste is nicely hoppy, if just slightly restrained. I suppose you could call this a sessionable beer then. A pretty decent IPA for a pretty decent price."
"D: Since this beer is bitter and not as balanced as I prefer my IPAs, it makes it slightly more difficult to drink."
"With its moderate alcohol presence you could certainly sit down with a number of these. Personally I have always enjoyed mixing in a couple of these with my 6 to whatever beers during my session. I know we should not compare but given the choice -- I would pick up the Maximus."
"A light orange poured into the pint with a good inch of off-white, creamy head that diminished fairly quickly, but left great lacing. Aroma was a pleasant citrus note, but was gone too fast for something that enjoyable. Taste is a little sweet, with a fairly sharp bitter finish. A little watery, but not in a bad way. A good IPA that I could easily enjoy several of at a sitting without killing my palate."
"In spite of what might seem like an overly harsh review, this is a pretty drinkable IPA. Not my favorite for the style, but the relatively low ABV and fairly robust taste make it a sessionable IPA."
""
"I seemed to have a better impression of this beer from the bottle than on tap. From the tap, it displayed all of the golded-copper colors, read retention, citrus nose, and bready, hoppy, malty flavors that were found in the bottle, just in a more subdued manner. Still a wonderful IPA, just got lost in the shuffle for me when sampling from the keg."
"Drinkability - Pretty good. I wouldn't reccomend it for day-time drinking, but a nice beer at the end of the day."
"Aroma is of hops mostly, with some malt support. The initial taste is your atypical American IPA, but for some reason the mix of the hop and malt flavor leaves me with a slightly soapy taste in the mouth, kind of acidic as well. Leaves little aftertaste to speak of and slightly acidic feel. Maybe I had a soapy glass, I hope the next one is better."
"overall, probablynot my favorite. good at warmer temps in small quantities."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a fairly light honey color, clear with a nice white foamy head. Aromas are somewhat all over the place, where neither hops nor malts are taking the lead. Hops are certainly dominant in aroma, but just not descernable in terms of variety, it's just the smell of hops thats it. Malts are also coming through, but again, quite generic. On the palate, the hops are quite aggressive; when I had my first of this 6-pack I must have served it quite cold, but at a warmer temp, the hops are much more enjoyable. The finish isn't quite candy sweet like most IPAs, it finishes with a hop bite and doesn't hold back. I like the bitterness quite a bit, but there isn't a freshness to the hop flavor, due to this sample's uncertain age or the hops they use. When I had this beer for the first time, it was, I think the second IPA I ever drank (the first being spat out for it's bitterness), and one I really enjoyed. 200+ beers later and I'm still enjoying it and wish it was available locally."
"Pours a nice red amber with a one finger head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is mild citrus and floral hops. Taste is bitter floral hops with little of the citrus in the nose. Not too oily which helps mouthfeel. Good typical IPA, but nothing spectacular."
"Creamy and even bubbly. Has a nice thick feel but smooth as well. What a nice drink. Flowery, smooth, a little bitter. Easy easy drinker."
"This is a IPA for lightweights,it would be great for a person first getting into craft beer and ipa's.This is a mediocre beer from a great brewery.This beer needs some serious hops."
"***edit*** im keeping everything the same but appearance, i poured another and no suspended bits. im keeping the old review in case someone gets the same deal.."
"Overall a pretty good IPA one that I might share with friends who are not used to the hop bombs I frequently consume."
"Overall, it's a solid but completely unexceptional style example."
"Lagunitas' take on a regular IPA poured a golden orange with a few traces of yellow here and there. It had less than a quarter of an inch head of white foam that quickly dissipated into a few white rings and a barely any lace around the glass. It had an aroma of juicy fruits, a few citrus fruits, toasted malts, and a small whiff of floral hops at the end. When it warms up a great deal, a small scent of pine will emerge. It first started out with a mild crisp floral hop bitterness and then that was followed by the citrus fruits, a pinch of toasted malts, and a dash of pine. Just a common not over the top IPA. This is a light beer that happened to have a light dry aftertaste of floral hops and a slice of grapefruit. This beer is just a nice crisp affordable light beer that has session written all over it. Is it a ""special Homicidally hoppy ale?"" Not even close."
"Looked a nice amber. It was a nice IPA, but the hops profile just didn't do it for me. It was a little ""green"" overall. No rich citrus or spicy flavors, just an over powering grassy element. The bitterness was on-par and the body wasn't too heavy. Its a good IPA, but doesn't really stand out."
"Run of the mill, in my opinion."
"Mild stone fruit sweetness upfront with a lingering sharp bitterness that lingers on the palette. Not a pleasant bitterness like in hop devil or mojo ipa, i found this to be borderline unpleasant and this hinders drinkability. A very mediocre IPA at best imho."
"drinkability is good (I guess if I didn't already sample 5 other beers I might give this a higher rating?)."
"D - A smooth easy drinking IPA."
"THIRD TRIAL: This is a pretty good IPA overall. I enjoy a lot of Lagunitas beers, and this fits right in there with most of their others. It pours a hazy orange with a fair amount of sediment floating in it. The head doesn't stick around too long, but it leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is floral and very clean citrus hop. The flavor is similar, with a bit of sweet maltiness in the finish. For some reason, most of the Lagunitas beers I've had taste ""clean"". That's the best way I can put it... Not astringent, just very clean (almost like a cleaning product smells). The aftertaste leaves a bit of hop bitterness on your tongue, but not as much as I would have liked. Overall, this is a good IPA, not too special, but not average either."
"Well now, this could easily qualify as one of the best IPAs I've had. I'm going to look for it again and wonder how good this would be from the tap?"
"This is a beer I could sit down and drink. Not something that is going to burn your tastebuds out if you want to switch to something lighter later on in the night."
"Drinkability- Not bad. Considering the 5.7% ABV is fairly small for a IPA, you can definitely drink more than one. Maybe not the best IPA Ive had but still rather enjoyable. Ive had this same beer on tap from a cask and its a little better than the bottled version."
"Pretty much a standard mix of hops and malt for the style. The flavoirs are nice enough, though a bit more restrained than expected. Enjoyable, though when lined up with so many other West Coast IPA's, it's above average and nothing more, IPA. Not a ""wow""er, but tasty enough to enjoy and easty enough to have a couple!"
"If bitter is your bag, this is your beer. The malty front and general presentation aren't there with this beer, but it provides a swift kick in yer arse."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA, very drinkable, the citrus and biscuit pair well with the hops, which aren't overwhelming but definitely make an appearance."
"Could drink this all night long, just love the balance"
"D- very clean and fresh, easy drinking and mellow. great nose, depends on ocassion if i'd have another, worth a shot though"
"12 oz. bottle- color of bright amber, with a froth white head - nose of tar , resin , hopps , malt balanced , and slightly perfumey floral  taste of bright , tar , resin , hopps , grapefruit , and malt - body resiny harsh, and mildly carbonated aftertaste of resin , tar , grapefruit , and hopps"
"Lagunitas IPA pours a clear golden orange with an odd particulate in suspension in the bottle. There is a rich malty aroma, with herbal, tea like hops. It almost smells like fresh unfermented wort. Taste is more sweet and fruity maltiness, rounded with a heavy hop bitterness. Hops are citrusy and really balance the fruity malt flavor. As my friend Brian would say, I really dig this beer. So far the best offering from Lagunitas I've had (although I have a Hairy Eyeball and a Brown Shugga waiting for me in the fridge). I'm glad to see these beers on the East coast."
"D - I look for a touch more body and more flavor overall in an IPA. Still not a bad hop fix, just not a really, really solid IPA."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Appearance is the usual IPA colour, with lots and lots o' floaties in it. I should have been a little more careful with the pour, but no matter. Good offwhite head retention. Has that typical, but damn tasty west coast citrus/pine punch. I found the finish to be a little too astringent for my tastes. Good malts, medium body with oily hops helping it slide down the pipe. Overall a really solid west coast IPA. I bet this would be a damn fine session brew fresh on tap."
"The beer crystal clear and orange w/ a light head which dissapears fast. A good blend of hops and citrus flavors. A lot of bitter flavor in the fast finish. Not too hoppy andmid strong in flavor. Have not found it on tap but availible at most beer stores. A good IPA that won't break the bank account."
"This ipa is a nice orange with not much of a head but plenty of suspended mattter. The smell is the high point of this beer. Sweet, hoppy and some spice. The taste is bittersweet. A nice hop aftertaste caps of this beer well. I would drink this if it were available to me. A good sessionable IPA."
"Drinkamability: I have purchased more than a few 6ers of this brew (at $8.99), and find it to be extremely drinkable. For a buck more than SN Pale Ale, it provides a more distinct, slightly cleaner 'hop whallop"". That's a good name for a homebrew!"
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A dark amber color with a small, white head with quick retention, yielding a nice layering on the beer. A pleasantly hoppy smell that was not very overbearing but let you know that it was going to be a good IPA. Apparently the smell was not a good indicator of what the taste was going to be because my palette was attacked with God only knows how many IBUs. Very good; I enjoy hoppy beers, but I believe this APA may be closer to a double because the IBU content of it seems to be very high. I nice mouthfeel that was pleasant and very smooth as I drank it. Pretty drinkable beer; high IBU content make it that you can't really drink too mnay of these in a row unless you are a real hophead. After one of these, my stomach started churning from the hops, but they definitely tasted good when they were going down."
"Don't drink and review."
"Not bad, above average, but not the best I have ever had. However, this should be one that anybody can enjoy. The hops seem to be a little less agressive when the beer is closer to room temperature. Recommended."
"Crystal clear orange amber colour with a fluffy off-white head. Good retention and a bit of clumpy lacing. Aggressive pine resin aroma with sharp grapefruit, almost catty and maybe a bit spicy. If I imagine really hard I can smell just a hint of malt. Medium bitterness up front balanced by grainy malt. Piney hops cut through the middle, giving way to significant grassiness and leaving a lingering dry bitterness. The body felt just a little thin, along with the malt character, but this improved as it warmed. Carbonation was average, nearly lively, a little creamy. Pretty good stuff. I hadn't had this in quite a while - it didn't quite live up to memory, but still enjoyable."
"The orange beer pours nicely with a sturdy off-white head that leaves a thick, layerd lacing. The nose is very subtle hints of bread. The taste is spicy and grassy. The beer is a bit of a bite in the mouth. Drinkability is good. I believe it would make for a nice session ale. All things considered, this is a conservative IPA."
"The color is a beatuiful golden orange which emits a decent glow when held up to lighting. I immediately wanted to drink it once it was poured into my glass. Unfortunately I had a bit of a cold when I had this so my ability to smell wasn't up to par. But from what I could sense it had a pleasant, crispy and slightly fruity aroma. Taste proved to be rather pleasant as well. A standard IPA flavor with a little bit of fruity sweetness at first and finishing off with a not-too dry, slightly bitter after taste. To me this is a text book IPA. Easily enjoyed, but not too adventurous."
"D: Overall, the ale is enjoyable, with nice profiles that make me want to have another bottle or two."
"Pours a fiery orange with some golden hues when held to light. There are some little particles floating throughout the beer. Aroma isnt very strong. There is some citrus and floral hops noticeable in the nose along with a little caramel. Taste is citrusy and piney hops along with a little bit of malt and the beer finish a little dry on the palate. Pretty easy drinking beer. Above average IPA in my opinion."
"This doesn't deserve to be holding any craft IPA title, that's for sure."
"M&D - light bodied IPA with a nice bitter/sweet blend, nice but rather pedestrian in the world of quality IPA's"
"This just came available in my state and wow, what a pleasure. Boy, every microbrew has it's own distinct personality. This one pours a nice rocky head, leaves lacing all the way through. Has some light caramel flavors before a nice hoppy kickback shines through. What a great session beer, pouring an oft-copper color. I am just upset I only have one."
"Poured into a pilsner glass from a 12 oz bottle. It has a bready, almost fried smell mixed with a piny hop aroma. A little thin in the flavor. Nice taste but just not bold enough. It also sticks in your mouth creating a film of flem. Not bad overall, but not a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, I'm liking this pale ale more for what it lacks than what it has. It seems to be getting tougher and tougher to find a IPA with some hops that doesn't beat you up with unbalanced sharpness and dryness."
"About two years ago I reviewed this with a big thumbs down. I now believe that beer was past its prime. Upon further review, while this is not an exceptional ipa, its certainly a good one."
"Mouthfeel is medium light. I don't know how drinkable it is, in spite of the huge buttery quality it is still quite enjoyable, at least in small quantities."
"I have been trying to go through this case as slowly as possible to fully enjoy it. This is an excellent brew and I look forward to trying more from Lagunitas."
"Overall- A nice, mid level, IPA. Can't go wrong with this. A 6er would be quick and easy to polish off."
"D: Tasty, easy-to-drink and not filling. Its worth sticking with but personally, I prefer something a little more flavorful if I have another choice within the style."
"An above average example of an above average style."
"Over all, this was not what I expected. It's not all that strong in hoppiness for an American IPA, but even so I was not disappointed in the least. I don't think I'll set this next to Dogfish's offerings, but they are much more specialized and it'd be unfair to even put them in a match. This is a very good beer!"
"A tasty IPA that is recommended. The aggressive hops are balanced by the nice bit of malt. Very solid as are all of Lagunitas offerings."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber with a one finger head. No lacing to speak of. The smell is of malty breadiness. The tast is definitely malts up front with some hops in the middle and finishes malty. Mouthfeel is good not real dry. I could drink plenty of these but this is almost like an amber rather than an IPA to me. If your a hophead looking for a hop bomb this is not it. It is a good beer for what it is but just not the usual IPA."
"Pours a clear reddish orange, thick off white head forms, nice lacing and good retention. Smell is pine, floral, some caramel and spice, nice and hoppy. Taste is crystal malty, overly so, pine, some biscuit, very weak flavour, almost no finish at all. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Smell was nice but the flavour is almost non existant. Thanks biegaman!"
"Overall tasty and easy to drink, this could become a staple IPA in my fridge."
"In the mood for a hoppy sixer, this works. All about hop bitterness, but one isn't really enough."
"*Edit* I just read the bottle, which states: ""raging hop character [that] engages the Imperial Quanlities of the Malt Foundation in mortal combat on the battlefield of your palate."" Huh. I guess the malt in my bottle staged a strategic retreat or something."
"The drinkability is very good, a very well balanced brew. Prosit MK"
"Not very heavy and good, lively carbonation, this is a solid beer. Very balanced and a great session IPA."
"Recommended."
"Great hoppy taste+Low ABV=A very happy and easily inebriated Hoss."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Man this beer was better than I expected, I'll get it again."
"This is a good (not great) American IPA. ""Hopheads"" may consider it lacking, but the smoothness and balance make for easy drinking. No single ingredient stands out. I consider this a classic session IPA."
"D: This one is a relatively inexpensive keeper. Great for those nights after work where you want the taste of a great IPA, but not the effects of too high an alcohol content."
"Later - I've downgraded drinkability - just too one-sided for me, I need something with a little less hops, a little more balanced."
"Clear honey-colored with a thin orangey-beige head that barely rises and sinks quickly. Inviting aroma of caramely malt and fruity citrus hops. Flavor doesn't do justice to the aroma since hops anticipation is met with a thin initial flavor of bitter pine. Some biscuity malt shows a presence, but as that washes across the palette the piney hops grow, followed by a lingering citrus peel bitter. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, good carbonation level. Drinakability a little better than average, but not my favorite from this brewer. Thanks to BeerRun 13 for sharing this one."
"I'm glad I had this, but it didn't ""wow"" me like some other IPA's."
"Poured deep amber with an off-white head. Great head retention and lacing. Bready nose with aromatic hops filling in the gaps. Rye bread flavors, also freshly boiled wort and pine. Aftertaste is bitter but very restrained. Body is a bit thin and doesn't fully support the hoppyness. Hard water mouthfeel. Somehow the flavors don't really seem the combine very well, it's like the hops and malts are off doing their own thing. Pretty good IPA but not my first choice."
"Very crisp drinking."
"Really quite nice, a must try for the hop head."
"Bottle: Poured a clear orangey color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and lacing. Aroma of metallic hops with some caramel malt. Taste is a mix between sweet malt with some metallic hops and a bitter finish. Body is about average. Overall, this is an OK IPA but far from being great and lacking balance between malt and hops."
"Poured a hazy, deep amber color with moderate slightly off-white puffy head. Smell is loaded with piney and grassy hops, and is very impressive, Taste follows on the smell, with a nice sweet maltiness slowly presenting itself to balance the hops. Nice and creamy mouth sensation. An excellent beer. Great example of the style."
"A moderate hops aroma and only a slight pine and citrus present. 1/2"" frothy head, off-white. Amber color. Nothing spectacular with respect to taste of mouthfeel. Nothing really stood out with beer. A decent IPA that could be a good session beer."
"A good powerful IPA when you are in a hophead mood, good with strong-tasting foods, all in all a very good beer."
"Drinkability: Substantial, but very quenching. I'm a fan."
"The aroma is a promising start, and while the flavor is technically all there, it never manages to flow. It's not cacaphonous, but it does hit some off notes. The end result, though, leaves it nicely drinkable despite the halting flavor profile. So it might not be the first beer I grab from the fridge, but it won't be the last either."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Good one-finger head. Color was a light orange with moderate carbonation. Aroma was mildly citrus. Taste was mildly hoppy with a good malty background. Not nearly as hoppy as one would expect from a West Coast IPA but very drinkable, one of my regulars and an excellent session IPA."
"Medium body, coats the mouth well and the flavor seems to linger for a bit. Has a bit of crispness but still seems filling. Good beer overall, something I could drink several of and would come back to as well."
" Not nearly as hopped as many others of the style, but more hoppy than a traditional English IPA."
"D-Good average IPA nothing to special but it is a decent brew."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. It pours an oversedimented/hazed copper with a half-inch khaki head that leaves nice sheets of lacing. Mostly biscuity/caramelly malts and piney hops in the nose and a flavor that consists of this and a substantial, toasty/nutty malt background with piney/citric/resiny hops that leave a medium bitterness and give citric burps. It has a medium and smooth body with a medium finish and is overall a good, sessionable IPA."
"Very solid IPA by Lagunitas. Nothing spectacular, but definitely session material that would keep me interested. Definitely the most sediment/floaties I've seen in an IPA or just about any other beer for that matter. Don't know if that's typical of this brew, or just the bottle I got, but didn't detract from the beer at all...just something unique."
"Pours a pretty nice copper color with a white head with pretty nice retention. Smell is of caramel and sticky pine sap, floralness as it warms. Pine sap taste in the beginning, a little bit of biscuit in there as well. Hops are definately the lead role, piney, resinous, some citrus too. High carbonation, medium bodied. This is not the best IPA I've had, but it's a damn solid one, of which I could see myself drinking plenty of."
"Not as refreshing as some IPA's, but still a halfway easy drinker."
"D - Not my favorite IPA, but it is drinkable for those who don't seek a lot of complexity."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a dark gold/amber color with an off white head. Piney hop aroma floated out of the glass with a honeyed malt scent to accompany it. Flavor is very strongly hops, almost grassy. Malt comes in to balance this, and it's sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Not sure if I got this right, but seemed to be a little bit of diacetyl (buttery slickness) in there. Body and carbonation were both in the medium range, and there was a good bit of drying from the beer. I have had better IPAs, but this was pretty good, and I will probably keep it in regular rotation."
"Poured into pint glass, dark amber color with fluffy white head on top. Aroma is floral hops. Tastes like hop bitterness with malt to balance it and enough body to support. This isn't necesarily anything special, but it is a good value and a solid beer."
"Nice and chewy with bold grapefruit acidity that causes the mouth to pucker; has a nice sweet malt backbone, a very well balanced IPA"
"I recommend this IPA, and not just to hop worshippers. Delicious!"
"A very solid IPA from Lagunitas."
"This is a great IPA, balanced, hoppy enough to satisfy any conesseur. Cali keeps on doing it right."
"The taste was largely in keeping with the aroma. Bitter hops yielded slightly to malt  an effect that became more pronounced as the beer warmed. It finished dry and astringent, but not too much so."
"D-fairly good but I would switch here at Hoptown as there were many more enticing selections."
"Overall I really enjoyed this and would like more please."
"Pours a clear copper color with a thin white head that blankets the top. Some nice lacing left behind. I guess I should have been a little more cautious with the poor because I see all kinds of yeast floating in it. Smell is somewhat subdued with a light hoppy citrus scent thats gets a bit stronger as it warms. I may not smell much of the hops but I can taste them. Bitterness from start to finish...citrus and pine flavors mixed with some brown sugar and bready malts. Nice feel in the mouth. Slick from the hop oils and a dry, bitter finish."
"Nice orangy amber hugh. Slight cloudiness in the glass. Small white head with little lacing of the glass. Smelled floral citrus scent pleasant aroma. They said it was homicidally hoppy but it was not that bad. It was hoppy but not what they perceived. Well rounded taste. Nice hop notes thru out the glass. Good after taste and drinkability. Had a nice finish with the hops and citrusy tones. I would certainly drink it again if I get the chance. Good beer."
"Drinkability- Definitely a summer backyard beer. Nothing too overpowering but a real hoppy IPA. Very nice."
"If you like hops, you're going to appreciate this beer. It's not the most finely detailed IPA but it's chock full of hops, that's for sure! Around these parts it's almost a local ""lawmower"" beer that's found practically everywhere and a sure-fire brew anywhere you go."
"Servicable IPA, with a muted citrus hop fragerance. Lots of head and lace. Orange. Smooth if understated hoppy flavour, medium mouthfeel, creaminess,drying finish, and citrus aftertaste. Not bad at all as a beer on a summer night, not a knockout IPA."
"CRUX: DOGGONE GOOD! (Like the label says.) I much prefer the truly great Maximus (which, unfortunately, I can't obtain near me) but this is one sessionable, everyday drinking kinda IPA, and I enjoyed it."
"Not bad but I like a stronger hop presence in an ipa."
"I was expecting a decent IPA when I bought this, but I got even more than what I expected, especially after reading other reviews. It's not really really bold or anything, but it's a delicious beer from a brewery that really doesn't get enough credit. If you want a nice session beer and a nice smooth-drinkin' IPA for the summer, definitely buy it!"
"43 different hops?! That's crazy rediculous...yet, its not really a massively hoppy beer. Its bitter, sure, but I'm actually getting a lot from the 65 ""various malts"". An interesting ale if you're looking for something a little different from an IPA."
"Pours a typical IPA color with a fairly large off-white head that leaves some light lacing. A very sweet smelling IPA with other scents of hops (duh), heavy malts, a little bit of orange, and a little bit of lemon. Not the typical pine hop flavor I usually associate an IPA with more so of an earthen flavor, definitely very malty for an IPA, with a nice flavor of citrus to compliment everything. It leaves a fairly bitter taste (even for an IPA). Pretty drinkable beer, not exactly my favorite IPA but its still hoppy enough to placate my hop addiction."
"drinkability: good"
"Cloudy orange/copper color. Not just cloudy, but there are particles in here. Nothing to worry about. Thick rocky off-white head. Good head retention. Strong citrus and piney hop aroma. Good malt backbone followed by floral hop flavors that seem subdued compared to the aroma. Finishes dry, with some asprin like flavors. Pretty good, bitterness is not overwhelming. Not my favorite flavors in the hop department, but worth a shot."
"Overlal very drinkable, a real impressive brew from Lagunitas."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a medium body. The beer is a bit sweet for my taste. The beer is easy to drink. This is simply not my favorite IPA."
"Cute white head that didn't stick around to party. This ipa is a darker orange than usual to the style, but it doesn't mean it takes anything away from the taste. Very nice smelling.. little malt in the nose and the taste. This is not a bad thing, because it's nice to find an IPA that doesn't go overboard balancing large amounts of hops with large amounts of malts. Taste is hops towards the citrus, and I'm getting a little grapefruit sweetness here and there. Mouthfeel is a little below medium which fits perfectly considering the low-ish abv for the style. This also leaves the drinkability very high. Can't believe this is a west coast ipa!!!"
"This isn't the tastiest IPA out there, but it's decent bang for your buck and by no means bad. Fairly pretty goldenish color with not much going on in the nose- some hoppyness, a hint of pine. Taste is mostly bitter hops and definitely a strong pine presence. Also a good bang of sour fruityness that isn't my favorite thing ever. Mouthfeel is sticky and almost grainy. Overall a pretty good IPA- easy to drink, light, good during warm weather, just not the best out there."
"A good choice for a relative bargain IPA."
"Pretty average, typical IPA appearance. Smell was good with hoppy, citrusy aromas. Not as powerful as some IPA's though. Taste was also pretty good, but not too hoppy, actually seemed to have a pretty strong malt character in the finish. Mouthfeel was average. A pretty drinkable IPA, not as hoppy as I would like but that does make it a little less aggressive and more suited to those who don't love hops to the max."
"This is very drinkable brew but I'd say there were other more compelling IPAs out there to try."
"I would keep as a regular."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a finger of off-white head that sticks around for a minute or two, decent lacing left behind on the glass. Nose is filled with light floral hops over a slight caramel, simple but nice. Tastes is filled has a medium dosage of floral and piney hops, fairly bitter on the finish, pale malt, slightly bready, overall a standard well made IPA. Body is on the thin side and the carbonation is also a little low. Overall this is a decent beer, nothing exceptional, but a decent beer."
"A very well done IPA; one of the better ones I've had. I look forward to trying it again next time I'm in the states."
"Drinkability & Notes: At less than 6% alcohol, a great tasting beer, not too harsh on the tongue like some over the top IPAs, this is a great beer to have a few of, and I wish I had more than my one. Another great IPA from the west coast, keep up the good work, and I look forward to exploring the Lagunitas brewery further."
"Pours golden-copper with a big bubbly head and an ever-so-slight haze. The aroma is of fresh, bright, floral hops, with doses of lemon and evergreen. It's like smelling fresh hops. Not exactly a handfull, mind you, but they're there nonetheless. The palate opens up instantly bitter, followed swiftly by the interplay of malt and citric sweetness. The bitterness is solid but fades into a finish that is dominated mostly by hop flavor. Then -- surprise surprise! -- that bitterness perks back up nicely on the tongue to mingle with a nice hoppy aftertaste. This is a refreshing, flavorful IPA sure to impress any fan of the style."
"Almost orange in color with a nice white head, fades and leaves a nice lace to the end of the glass. Aroma is of grapefruit, bit piney and an ever slight hint of malt. Flavor is the citrus bite with mild malt middle and a dry crisp finish. A bit sticky feel in the mouth but overall enjoyable. A beer to enjoy all night long."
"Pours an orangy pale copper hue with a thin light beige head that forms a thin collar and hugs the glass nicely. Trace amounts of chill-haze. Very gassy. Light bready aroma with a healthy dosage of hop oils with a light, orangy citrus zip. Not overwhelming by any means in the flavor department. Some malty sweetness with just enough bitterness to cut it and keep it easy drinking. Hopping can take on a floral-like quality to it when savored deeply. A little overcarbonated. An easy sessioning mider IPA."
"Clear salmon tinted orange with a beautiful, full head of creamy foam. Butter and caramel, with loads of hop resin in the aroma, spruce and medicine jar. Malt is very lush and bold, creamy and full with a rich caramel, toffee and fruit flavor and I believe there may be some diecetyl, but in a desireable way. The hops are spicy and piney and could stand to be kicked up a notch or two, to be honest. I find it quite nice."
"All in all a good beer, but there are some things from laguntas that I like better. This is a good IPA if you are looking to have multiple IPAs in a session."
"A decent IPA. Accurate for the style, but nothing exciting. I'd have another one, but I wouldn't go searching for it."
"very drinkable, but a bit sweet and bitter for my taste. would accompany food well."
"Mouthfeel is medium, just a little oily. This brewery is far too underrated in almost all they do. I would gladly session this."
"I just can't understand why beers like this are the most popular beers in the lineup of their producers. There are really excellent pale ales and IPAs out there, ones that aren't just hop delivery vehicles, but beers. Thumbs down."
"This pours a clear orange-red amber color with a thick foamy head. The smell has a huge citrus aroma.It's like smelling a glass of grapefruit juice. It's a nice smell,but it's not hoppy. The taste,like the smell has a real citrus flavor. Unlike most American IPA's,this has almost no hop bitterness to it. The m/f of this beer is light,crisp and clear.This is a very refreshing beer. This is an American IPA that is very drinkable.The taste is great and the low alcohol helps make this an everday beer."
"Opinion: I remember really thinking that this was a pretty good beer in the past, and it is not bad now. The bitterness is a bit high for my taste so that it gives it a harsh edge. I am coming to the conclusion that my tastes are totally changing and that I really don't much care for bitter hoppy beers much anymore."
"The color is a hazy copper with plenty of chunks of sediment floating in the beer. Carbonation is good, and the head is creamy, off-white, and a bit on the small side. Aroma is all of citrussy hop, most reminiscent of pineapple. Taste is also dominated by citrussy hop, with an underlying sweet malt flavor. Crisp mouthfeel is dead-on. Overall, this is a perfect example of a good west coast IPA, but nothing sets this apart as great."
"Ranks right up there with any of the IPAs I've had lately. I really like they way the frutiness asserted itself up front. The only way you're not liking this; you don't like hops..."
"Appearance: Copper orange amber body lucious doughy looking thick off white head leaves lacing with each sip. Aroma: Citrus namingly grapefruit rinds along with a pine and grass tone and a touch of sweet caramelized malts to mix. Taste: Hop tea citrus zest and hop leaf along with a wave of bitterness and caramel toned malts not to the typical west coast IPA unique has it's own flavor especially the hop character comes off spicy to me. Mouthfeel: Med-light body range a bit slick glides on the palate nice IPA carbonation is natural and very smooth. Drinkability: Lick your lips force up a hop burp this is a solid west coast IPA enjoy very drinkable."
"I regularly choose this beer over the Smuttynose IPA and the Stone IPA when I want to have a few. Hop level to my palate is somewhere between those two others. Good stuff."
"The flavor is Hops up front with a toasted malt base. This is not an in your face bitter IPA but it is slightly piney; Medium in body and moderately carbonated."
"Overall, I am stunned this is a west coast IPA. Very sub par considering what I was hoping for. I might be disgruntled but it wasn't terrible, just average."
"Pours a golden orange color, some carbonation, small head, nice lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops and citrus. The taste is hoppy and sweet. Medium body. Very drinkable, not a bad IPA at that, but not in the class of other's I've had. Would recommend though."
"Body a bit above medium with a soft and creamy texture and superior drinkability. Why have I not had this before! Totally underrated."
"If you keep this IPA cool and dont let it get warm, it is very drinkable for most of the night."
"Carbonation was limited but the body was good. A better then average IPA."
"Kind of a stereotypical IPA, meaning that it meets my expectations. All in all a fine IPA."
"This looks decent (standard copper hue with decent head), smells good (slightly herbal, grassy and citric) and has pleasant carbonation. Something is sadly amiss with the coordination of the biscuity malt flavour and the clean grassy hop flavour though. The two clash. This beer is poorly integrated."
"Copper colored with a medium-fine off-white head. Aroma is weedy, green and piney, with just a touch of malty sweetness in the background. Strong, fresh citrus and pine hops in the nose, but a soft, almost English bitterness. Nice bright flavors of fresh American hops without being resiny or oily; balanced nicely by a subtle, flowery malt body. Soft mouthfeel with a fine carbonation; lengthy finish with plenty of citrusy hops. Nicely balanced; bright flavors. Nice IPA that sort of straddles the line between English and American style. Better fresh on tap; bottles are hit or miss."
"A really nice hoppy IPA, it makes up for what it lacks in balance by being big and interesting. Fun to drink, but maybe not something youd drink a lot of at once."
"Nicely balanced, will definately buy again."
"Overall, it's a good IPA. It's just not a great one, particularly when compared with some of the other American IPAs out there."
"Chill hazed golden amber with a thin lace ring. Earthy tree bark and mild hop oil aromas. Flavor is much more malty than hoppy, and for the first time in my life, I am drinking a west coast IPA that is a bit unbalanced in favor of the malts. For serious. What is this? To me this screams English IPA. Rather soapy with a mild hop bitterness yet bares a full, rich and malty backbone. Come to think of it, this is VERY soapy. Subtly carbonated mouthfeel makes it decently smooth and crisp. Still, not one I'll be going after again."
"I enjoyed drinking this one, but - I think - I would have preferred it to be more hoppy. There are better renditions of this style out there, and although the beer is good by many standards, I think I would reach for one of those before it. Although, I will probably return for this one again."
"Drinkability is good. It just seems like it's a toned down version of the Maximus. I'm not sure what's up with all the sediment though. Most of the Lagunitas bottles I've sampled have had lots of it."
"Poured a light copper colour with frothy, lacey head. Floral and grassy aroma. Taste is certainly dominated by hops with a bit of a tea flavour. Finish is a little dry and bitter. Low carbonation. It has a good hoppy flavour, but its a little bit thin"
"This is a very good, well balanced, and poundable IPA, and a fine representation of the style. Tasty and yummy. I would like to drink this all day. I just need to pick the day!"
"12oz bottle served in a pilsener glass. Big meal time head that chunks its way down the sides of the glass....this is a mean spirited beer with attitude. small carb bubbles meander to the top forming a finger of retaining head. Hoppy but with content...its not unchallenged like some. I tasted a solid malt foundation that is attacked by hoppy bitterness. Its a thoroughly enjoyable battle going on. nice oily slick mouthfeel, few bubbles to open the palate and there ya have it. Drink up. I had the cask version at the Carlsbad festival but I was a rook and didn't take notes....wont happen again."
"D: I ejoyed drinking this beer but I would look to a nother brewery for the upfront presence of hop aroma and bitterness I'm looking for in an IPA."
"nice caramel sweetness lingers, as the beer has a more robust texture"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Rolls over the tongue with ease. This is an IPA I could drink with ease that features a nice bitter kick throughout. Glad to see this at my local and have the chance to sample it with my buddy."
"A good IPA that goes down easily, or atleast my 6 pack did."
"Drinkability: Low abv makes this a good IPA if you are looking to have more than a few."
"Overall, a nice effort. Not my all-time favorite by any means, but a very solid beer."
"The beer pours a dark gold/orange color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice malt scent that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with citrus hop aroma. It's a little sweet smelling. The taste is decent as well. It has an over the top bitter flavor that is laid over a solid malt base. It is very hoppy all the way through to the finish. I'm not a big fan of these west coast IPA's. They really jack up the citrus hop qualities. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a pretty good IPA. I really prefer more malts and less citrus hops. They taste good in a hop mix, but when isolated and used in excess they can really ruin a beer. That's just my opinion."
"The pour is a slightly cloudy amber color with a fairly large head that leaves a disproportionately small amount of lacing. It smells like an American IPA, with pine, grass and citrus aromas. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and chewy like that of a porter or stout, but once you swallow, it feels thinner and more delicate. While you can taste cascade and/or other West Coast hops, the bitterness is very subtle for an American IPA. That, combined with soft, fruity and creamy malt backbone, make this taste more like an offering from Fuller's than a California brewer. There appears to be a theme going wih Lagunitas- Maximus, their I2PA, is also under-hopped, but this one works. This is not your typical West Coast IPA by any means, but it's surprisingly pleasing and very drinkable."
"The aroma is a mild citrus smell, but not the typical heavy grapefruit of other IPAs. The taste is very mild with a slight hoppiness. There is not much zing in the flavor which was different, but not bad."
"Good stuff but I've tasted better. This one started off really nice but seemed to lose some of its character as it sat."
"This is thhe only brew I've had from Lagunitas. Very impressive. This is my current favorite, over Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA."
"-UF"
"Poured a hazy orange colour, with a lacey white head. Aroma of sweet citrus fruits, pine and caramel. Big juicy and fruity taste. Some caramel sweetness, followed by a pronounced hop flavour. Bitter, dry and well balanced. Hops are not too in your face. Nice balanced brew. Smooth mouthfeel, great drinkability."
"Notes: Very nice balance. Medium body, malt isn't too sweet, isn't overly bitter, I would have like a little more hop flavor and aroma. Still good nontheless."
"Poured a rich, thick, deep golden amber. Upon inspection using backlighting it was cloudy with good size dark supended particles. There was a contiuous spring of rising carbonation. Virtually no head; a white wash with a falling lace with some stick. The nose was consistent with the taste - lengthy pine, slight citrus, cut grasses. The mouth was of medium body with a soft malt upfront. A slight bitter met the finish. A minute later a piney resin remained. To sum it up this was pine throughout."
"Taste: Creamy malt character, the hop finish feels prickly on the back of my tongue, which is pretty enjoyable. Low carbonation. A very decent IPA, certainly not the best I've ever had, but I wouldn't refuse another."
"A very nice I.P.A. Very, very hoppy, which we in the northwest absolutely love. Beautifully mahogany in appearance, this brew pours a minimal head that tends to linger. A bit in the bitter side, which is certainly a product of all those hops. A wonderful session beer, and more noteworthy that Lagunitas' other mainstream entry, The Kronic..."
"Medium to full bodied, acceptable drinkability, a good solid American IPA."
"amazing ipa. great. hoppy and sweet with mild bitterness which doesn't corrupt your palate. something nutty in the aftertaste, like hazelnut! light mouthfeel. give me more of this winner."
"Poured mine into a 16oz glass from a 12oz bottle. Head was about 1 1/2 fingers but dissipated pretty quickly (probably in 5 minutes). I am a big Pale Ale fan, and this had a stonger dose of hops than a Pale Ale, but not over the top. In other words, a true IPA fan might think this is a little mellow but for someone who wants to get into IPA and take a step to more hopped up beers, this is a good start."
"Hazy pale orange body. Yeast partials all over the place. light thin head. Aroma is very sweet, surprisingly malty. Some fruit citrus aroma present as well. Taste is a little bland for an IPA. This beer needs some serious flavor injection. Tasty upfront, but the finish is just dry with no complex flavor. Its just dry hops with mild citrus notes. A weird artificial sweetness in the aftertaste. There are much better IPA's out there."
"Poured a orange-copper hue into my pint glass, there was not much of a head. The taste starts out rather balanced between hops and malt, but the finish is a bit like I would imagine hop flavored cough medicine to be like. Overall an unremarkable IPA, not bad, but definitely not something to write a request for the homebrew version of. No need to try again in the bottle, maybe i'd give it a 2nd chance on draft."
"The initial malt flavor is completely covered by the hop bite within milliseconds. For an IPA, this is a good thing. The upfront malt could be described as slightly fruity. The bitterness is a continuation of the floral hop. Very long aftertaste that is entirely bitter. The richness of the beer is appropriate; I'd describe it as moderate. Carbonation is fine."
"I like Lagunitas' use of stubbie type bottles with their 6's, and this sample was poured out of one of those 12 oz brown bad boys. The appearance is a hazy copper, with a lot of suspended particles, a thin off-white head to cap it off. Lemon and tangerine mixed with grass and pine on the nose, some sweet caramel malt to hold it up, along with a little bit of smoky character. The flavour is okay, a decent balance of the malt backing up the stronger hop presence, but it doesn't really stand out much from the crowd either. Unless my tastebuds have already been shredded from two of these today already, and a Maximus earlier on. These hops really hit you in the pit of your stomach after a while. A sticky pine residue begins to form on the aftertaste over time, yet overall the mouthfeel is fairly average, not quite watery, but lacking in fuller body as well. If this were a local beer I would probably buy it more often, but at the hefty price tag of $16.99 CAN currency for a 6 of this Californian import I'll stick to Alley Kat's Full Moon Pale Ale and Tree's Hophead IPA for my regional hop fix."
"This poured bright and clear and was an orangey/copper color. A thin head of white creamy foam topped it off. Small bits of lace left on the glass throughout. The aroma is wonderful - with the sweetness of a Valencia orange with a touch of the bitter orange zest. I knew immediately after the first sip that this was an awesome beer. Very smooth with a mellow bitterness that has small traces of piney hops and citrus tartness. All of the flavors are blended extremely well. The body has a medium dry maltiness. Overall, this comes across as a high quality IPA. Beautiful on all counts."
"This is one tasty and easy to drink beer. Lots of flavors all balanced just perfectly. I love this stuff."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start, with a dry crisp finish. The tastebuds get the hops and citrus tones long after the finish. Nicely drinkable, a very pleasant IPA experience."
"Lots of malt flavors. The hops are around but they're not the highlight here."
"A nice rich bourbon color with a good deal of head that slowly recedes into a nice layer which leaves a coating of lace draping. The smell is less focused on the hops as you would expect from an IPA, and this beer actually smells very sweet, almost like cotton candy, or caramel. The taste is also heavy on some sort of sweetness, of sugar cooked in some form, but not burnt. There is the underpinning of hops that comes out in the aftertaste, and an overall presence of malt, but nothing spectacular. Its a good taste once you get used to it certainlly. The mouthfeel is not so great however. It is too watery, with almost no carbonation except a bit on the front of the tongue. I almost thought someone had watered my beer down. Its an alright beer, not a great IPA however."
"This is really an excellent IPA. I've had a couple better, but not many."
"This is a hazy orange liquid, topped with frothy, bubbly, lace-producing head. The aroma is earthy with a fleeting floral hoppiness. It certainly smells like an IPA, but its a restrained, quiet smellnot nearly as intense and over-powering as Id expect from a west-coast brewery. Theres a fruity, estery flavor, along with a nice malt backbone. Its a sweet-ish beer, with a nice finishing hop bite. Nothing spectacular, but this is a good drinking-brew."
"Beer is good. Happy let down beering."
"Perhaps because I accidently poured out the sediment at the bottom the appearence was somewhat diminished only because there were things floating in it. Still it poured a nice tawny gold with a thin slick of white head on the top. Smells were slight notes of syrupy hoppiness and a little honey baked malts. The taste was crisp and hoppy without too much malt flavor. Very tasty and not over the top."
"A solid IPA...pours a light gold with a decent head. Smell is mainly citrus from the hops...very nice on the nose. Tatse has the proper tang from the hops and starts with an initial touch of malt. Mouthfeel is medium in quality and finishes in a nice slightly dry way. Good drinkability...would definitely have another."
"I was suprised to see this beer on tap that I'd only come across once in California at none other than the Moan and Dove. Pours a pretty standard looking clear amber color with a bit of foamy head on top. Smell is pretty good, not in your face like a lot of the west coast IPAs. Taste is congruent with that. Instead of tongue-singeing hops there's a more balanced sweet grassy taste to this beer. A bit zesty, and floral. Mild sweet malts back up the hops. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel and great drinkabilty. A decent IPA for sure, but if you have the option, get the Maximus."
"The mouth feel is comfortable minimal carbonation not too syupy. Drinkability is good the carbonation blends in with the malty hops. The aftertaste lingers a hint of malt with hops."
"This poured into the pint glass a clear copper color with a dense 1 inch tan head. Light champagne bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass to reinforce the foam on top. The nose has a rich herbal character. Hints of grass, pine come from the glass. The taste has a balance of hops and malt. The first impression parallels that of the aroma, the herbal hops, but the middle of the profile delivers some of the malt (a hint of sweetness and body). A pleasant bitterness is apparent in the finish. Good medium body, with a slightly slick mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"Sort of a mild IPA, despite the sharp finish. Drinkable, low ABV IPA."
"Poures a deep copper with a fluffy head that leaves a light amount of lace,heavy pine aroma with a grapefruit note.Pney,resiny flavors going big on the hops thats for sure not much malt base but some nice flavors.There are better west coast IPA's out there this one seems way out of balance but still decent but wont look for again anytime soon."
"The IPA pours a dark gold, not quite clear, with a modest bubbly (but not foamy) off-white head. The aroma is slightly tart, lemony with some undercurrent of hops, but not much. The taste, too, is slightly acidic--but not well balanced, frankly. I think I'm getting fussy in my old age because this ale is not up to the traditional west coast standards."
"Overall, a fairly refreshing beer."
"Again, thanks Nickbagofdonuts for bringing back the goodies."
"Decent drinkability if you like American IPAs on the hoppy side."
"A quite decent IPA. Not my favorite style, but I consume a few every month, and this one is one of the better ones, when it comes to good drinking, session-type beers."
"Dark amber in color, thin head and no lacing. Smell is very malty with only a hint of hops here. Flavor is fairly blanaced with a moderate bitterness and spicy hop note. Light to medium bodied. I'll pass on this one in the future, there are so many other better options for an IPA."
"Consumed in September 2004 from a 22oz bomber purchased at the local store. Poured with a small head that was very quick to disappear. Light lacing around the edges of the top of my 24oz mug. Sort of a dark yellow coloring with a good amount of yeast floaters. Smells pretty damn good. Kinda like a garden. Tons of floral overtones. Hmmm, not bad, but not great. Pretty hoppy for a regular IPA. Taste a bunch of grapefruit. Lots of carbonation too. Maybe detect a bit of pine in which everyone describes. And a definite bitter aftertaste. Not a bad on though. Maybe a bit overpowering, but it's ok by me. Overall a pretty nice IPA. Not one of my favorites, but one I would buy again if my favorites were gone."
"ng"
"12 ouncer, twist off cap. No freshness dating to be found. Pours orangy copper, cloudy,tiny bubble film, leaving sheets of lacing. Nose is lemony, with pine. This is a fair AIPA, needs some more center malt and body to round it out a bit. Very citric hops all throughout. slight metalic note. Not terrible but needs some help."
"Not a very good example of the style, if you ask me. A pretty plain IPA. Pours more yellow than red/amber, which in my opinon is the color that an IPA should be. The smell is good, though a bit weak, and contains pine, hops, citrus, and a tinge of malt. The taste to me is watery and weak for an IPA. It has the hops, and a bit of bitterness along with the pine and grapefruit notes, but it has a watery metallic taste that I find in some macros. The mouthfeel is good, just not substantial enough for me. Since it has an ABV of only 5.7%, you can drink many of these. All in all, not a good example of the style, in my opinion. Purchase something else."
"Bottle. Typical American hoppyness, only this feels a bit tinny and a little short, lychee and pine, a bit rough around the edges. I seemed to find the tinny quality in most Lagunitas beers i've had, i wonder why this is. I liked this, but the mouthfeel probably let it down a bit."
"Overall this is a very good beer, but it is very much a west coast ale, very hoppy and fragrent, not much malt. If you like that style, then this is a must try."
"This IPA was orange/copper colored. It poured a decent head that left a nice trail down my glass. Smell was interesting, very piney. However the taste was not quite an IPA as advertised, but more the PA category. The taste was disappointing after pouring a attractive interesting smelling brew. The mouthfeel was fairly carbonated thus lively. But I was somewhat dissapointed with the taste. Not a bad beer but not one I would go out of my way for."
"A very happily hoppy brew. It is so hoppy that some may think it is bitter (the lass sitting next to me at the bar spit it back onto the bar when she had her first taste). It pours a amber in color with a quickly receding head which comes to collect on the edges of the glass. It would later on form a nice lace. Behind the hops were sour citrus notes and spice tastings. The finish is a bitter that leaves a nice bite on the tongue."
"Perfect IPA for when you crave IPA. Pours a lighter golen orangish red with off white head that grows to beautiful proportions then resides back down in the glass. The smell is a blast of citrusy hops with hints of pine and spices. The taste while hoppy and pleasant has some warming spice notes as well, the sweet malts are not to sweet and really bring out the hoppiness of the beer, hints of apple towards the end, medium bodied and calls you back for more, a staple at home."
"*Note that this is a revisit and update of what I fear was originally a review of an off bottle..."
"This is slowly becoming(when I can get it) one of my favourite West coast IPAs because like almost all Lagunitas beers it is hoppy with a great balance. The bitterness is somewhere between Bridgeport and Stone's with a very drinkable finish. I find that the US brewers who nail the American IPA style also make every other beer in the lineup well( this does not apply to Belgian style brewers such as Ommegang etc.)."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, and could have had more based on this, but the bitterness could become overbearing after a while"
"Pours a bright copper with lots of clinging head leaving distinct rings down the side of the glass. Moderate aroma of pine. The malts are sweet and ample, flavors of caramel and maple syrup. Some smooth bread and butter elements. Invisible yeast. Hops quickly settle in with good herbal and pine qualities. Resin lingers on the tongue, perhaps a fraction too long, but if this beer had any less hops it would probably be a pale ale and not an IPA. It's not the intensely bitter, high-abv hop monster that many Pacific IPAs can be. Much more mellow and as a result, more drinkable. Excellent, soft mouthfeel. A session IPA if there ever was one. A nicely done beer, all around."
"One of my good friends picked up a bottle of this for me during the recent Red Sox road trip out to San Fran. Surprisingly, it travelled very well. It smelled very hoppy and citrusy. It poured with a huge cloudy well-formed head, very impressive. Attractive body, clear copper. It has a smooth but robust mouthfeel. It has kind of a grapefruity/lemony presence. The finish is very dry and hoppy and leaves a pine and grapefruit residue behind. Not a bad IPA, I would have it again if it was available around here."
"I found this IPA to be a little too thick and creamy, I will call that its only real fault. While this detracts a little from the mouthfeel, I don't think it would stop me from having this again. I am happy to find one more good IPA in the area."
"This one pours a slightly hazy amber orange color with a decent sized white head. Not much retention or lacing going on here the head is only visible for the opening act. There are also plenty of yeasty morsels swimming around the brew. The smell is citrus hoppiness but not much else to be detected, a little under whelming. Taste is very hoppy with nice citrus grapefruit bitterness to it. Slightly sweet finish from the weak malt character here, the taste defiantly stands out more than the smell. Mouthfeel is near perfect its like a velvet hop carpet is rolled out over your palette. This is a very drinkable and sessionable brew. Overall better than average IPA with a good hop kick to it."
"I like the aroma and malt character of this beer quite a bit, but wish the hops were a bit more ""rounded."" The level of hopping is OK -- in the usual American IPA range -- but they come across as a bit harsh, perhaps due to water chemistry (I don't know, but I'd hazard a guess that there's too much sulfate in the water)."
"Very drinkable IPA, although it's stealthy beginning will briefly fool the tastebuds into thinking it's a little bit weak. This would be nice at the end of a hot day, and there will certainly be plenty of those in a month or two."
"This is a very drinkable beer that at only 5.7% ABV comes close to being a session beer."
"Drinkability: More believable as a pale ale in the Sierra Nevada tradition, but very drinkable. I've grown accustom to the ""outhop THIS, pal"" manifesto that is the west coast IPA, so I'm a bit underwhelmed by this. Perhaps a bit more in the English tradition, but still, a very well-made and drinkable brew."
"Looks a pretty standard deep gold, but with a big fluffy head. Has a mild aroma of piney, woody hops with a touch of fruity esters. Mild up front, tastes of pine & grapefruit. Bittering hops come through midway & give it a solid bitter finish. By the end of the glass, I really felt the beer had gotten too thin, seemed almost watery. I'm a fan of the bittering hops in this one, but would prefer much more in the hop flavor & aroma department."
"This is a highly hopped IPA that has tons of hop flavor. At the end it balances well, making this highly drinkable. I would like a little more from the aroma though."
"Lagunitas IPA is yet another great West Coast IPA and will more than adequately give hopheads their hop fix. Man oh man, Maximus must be a treat! I don't know how much longer I can let it sit in my beer fridge. As the baby brother though, this one is a doozy."
"Overall: It's a perfectly cromulent beer. I've had better, I've had worse. But since I'm not much of a hophead, I like a little malt sweetness to balance out the hoppiness. And this beer doesn't have that. Not one I'll be buying in the future."
"I like the beer and think it drinks nice, but it lacks the body and malt for an excellent IPA."
"The color is a clear medium copper. There is not a whole lot of head, but what is there is lingers for a while. There's a low, herbal hop aroma. It's sweet and malty with only medium bitterness. Nicely balanced but surprisingly reserved for the style."
"Orange copper medium thick body with a one inch thick head that left nice lace as it dissipated. Medium carbonation is just right for the style. Aroma is piney hops and alcohol. Taste lacks a lot of sweetness, and is unbalanced towards snappy hop bitterness with some astringency reminiscent of orange peel. The malts are biscuit like with a bit of a sour twang in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but gets better as the beer warms. A good IPA for a hophead."
"Wow this beer smells like it has not yet been fermented. A sweet wort smell, that is heavy on the crystal malt. A bit of spicy hop notes under the main smell, but not much. Pours a hazy copper color with a prodigious tan head that fades fairly quickly. Again there is a sweet malt flavor, that is reminiscent of sweet wort. The beer ends with a bit of bitterness. I must admit, this is quite a stretch to be labeled as an IPA, a pale ale perhaps but not an IPA. A light hop flavor and not enough bitterness, this is a bit of a disappointment. It is halfway interesting, just not close to what I was expecting. There is way too much residual sweetness and body in this beer, it just makes it too unbalanced. I will tell you one thing, the rest of this 6-pack will be used for making Brats. (4/3.5/3/3.5/3/3.35)"
"Bottle-conditioned, Clear deep golden hue with a sticky white head. Aroma is rather mild and could use more intensity. A solid malt base shows in the form of honey, caramel, butter. Hop profile is shy, citrusy, grassy and piney. Taste is more honey melted with pine. It's very bitter finally with resiny grapefruit aftertaste. Creamy medium body. When pouring the yeast depot, there's more orange character and it's far drier. Thanks Rodolito!"
"This here is one of my all-time favorites, even though it has the hop profile of a bitter Pale Ale as opposed to what I think of as a true IPA. Nonetheless...satisfying to all of the senses. Pours a slightly pinkish golden hue with a very nice, choppy, beige head. Good lacing, apparently moderate carbonation. The smell is mild, and is perhaps the weak link in an otherwise strong chain of features. Basically it is just piney/rindey Cascade hops with an interesting but understated malty sweetness underneath. The taste is what I like the best. A bready malt flavor makes an appearance, showing off a little bit of a buttery aspect. The hops soon take over, initially astringent, now lemony, and finally ultra-dry and piney. The mouthfeel is solid for the style and right up my alley. Slightly chewier than many hop-heavy beers, this brew has a nice alcoholic warmth and is perfect for chilly Spring and Fall evenings. Drinkability is maximal, and I will take this over most widely available IPAs any day."
"Golden light brown in colour. Bubbly white head that sticks around. Some serious lace. Reeks of hops, in a good way. Not much to say about the taste other than its loaded with hops. Leaves me wth a slight citrus twang. This brew is all about the hops, and thats what im expecting when i drink an ipa. Nice hop bite while it rests on my tongue. I could certainly knock back a few of these!"
"Not a bad IPA -- definitely not my favorite."
"This was a very well crafted brew. It poured a medium orange color with a great white head that left lace to the last drop. There was a grapefruit or orange zest scent that was very nice, along with a bit of hops. The taste was wonderful and a nice change of pace from many of the really dry hopped IPA's out there. This one still had the hop kick but with a great malt profile to balance things. This is s session IPA for sure and I will be buying this one again."
"I found this IPA to be quite tasty and easily quaffed. It maintained a fine balance between malt and hops that didn't let the taste profile get swept up in a tidal wave of bitterness. A nice, well crafted West Coast IPA."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle. The IPA was a slighly hazy light copper color, with a low stiff head. The smell was sweetish and kind of earthy and spicy, with a rather subtle floral hop bouquet...very nice although the hops could have been a tad more assertive. The taste was good, with a light maltiness and a well balanced bitter finish, with sublte citric notes. I like IPAs with citrus accents. The mouthfeel was good as well...very smooth and full. Overall a delicious and very drinkable IPA."
"This IPA poured out a deep yellow/amber colour with a frothy white head that died down rather quickly. The aromas were of freshly cut floral hops, hop oil, bready English malts, biscuits, and just a twang of boozy citrus hops on the finish. The taste is a lovely combo of floral hops and English malts in good proportion to one another. The mouthfeel is quite thick and almost ""stout-like"" for an IPA. This is definately one of the least hoppy and thickest/creamiest/smoothest west coast IPAs to ever cross the discerning palate of this BA. The drinkability was good, but the super creamy mouthfeel does get a bit ""coating"" or ""cloying"" after about half a glass or so...Overall this is a very ""different"" IPA from a brewery that has made a good first impression on me. Viva la California!"
"Drinkability: A solid West Coast IPA. Easy-drinking and refreshing. Try this one if you can."
"Very soft mouthfeel from the bottle-conditioning. Excellent moderate level of carbonation makes it very quaffable. Too bad about the lack of balance, really."
"Notes: Not a top tier IPA, but well worth a drink."
"A nice rich full body feel. It has a crisp feel in the mouth and a nice dry finish. Easy to drink with a dense quality. Order me another."
"I do think there is a time and a place for overly hoppy beers...just not in my world. The Lagunitas IPA is a strong, bitter beer. For some people this is just what the doctor ordered. For me, it's an invitation to have a Full Sail Pale Ale...."
"The head looks like a small blob of vanilla ice cream. The beer is dirty amber. Oh ya, there's hops in there. The nose is a noisy combination of grapefruit rind and library book. The malt tries to shoulder out the hops in the front, but fails miserably. Better luck in the middle, which turns sweetish, a little sugary, a bit caramely. The malt just doesn't have the sack to take on the hops, though. Finish is Cascade galore. The website claims this baby is made with 43 kinds of hop. I think it's true, but they meant to say ""tons", not ""kinds""."
"Nice golden pale color that is slightly hazy. Thin foam of head that goes away with time. Very hoppy bitter smell as expected. The taste is slightly malty with obvious amount of bitterness. The bitter smell and taste do not overpower the aromatic and flavorful qualities of the beer. Nice smooth, slightly sweet finish. Overall a good IPA."
"Dark Amber color, small foamy head. Aroma is fruity and grapefruity. A nice hoppy full-bodied IPA. Malts are nutty. Hops are spicy and citrusy. Hoppy without being too bitter. Good flavor. Aftertaste is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is hoppy, mostly bitter"
"This is a very hoppy beer, but unlike other west coast beers, it lacks an equally strong malty or sweet counterpunch. For some hop-heads, that might not matter. There is some sweetness up front, but it scuttles away almost immediately upon reaching the tongue, like a cockroach when the kitchen like is turned on."
"Dark ruddy amber, nice tight foamy head. The bartender at this place has presentation down to a T. Fresh grass and grove smell from the hops, and a very balanced and complimentary hop and malt taste. Its hard to find a balanced hop and malt IPA anymore. Nice bitter finish that means another drink. A nice self-perpetuating IPA."
"Drinkability: A good oily resin on the lips and burps with zing to them. What more can you ask for? I like the almost ""tingly"" feeling at the end and the oily bitterness that remained. A very good IPA and one that is sure to be a hit with the hop-heads out there."
"a big thanks goes to Gromit."
"Overall, a good IPA."
"This is a good IPA, but I may need to re-evaluate it."
"A hazy amber body with suspended soft-particulate is topped by a large off-white head of creamy foam. It drops at a leisurely pace to a solid 1/8"" surface covering and leaves some exceptional lacing about the glass. The aroma displays, not surprisingly, hops. They're piney, floral, and grassy over a sweetish, caramel-tinged malt - fresh, exciting, and welcoming without hitting you over the head! The body is medium; and it's quite creamy in the mouth due to a very fine, natural carbonation. In the flavor the hop bitterness and piney/resinous flavors hold the upper hand; forcing the sweet malt beneath into submission. It's well-balanced to the point of losing some character. But it's also balanced enough that the bitterness doesn't cake the mouth. (It may mask the tastebuds... but it doesn't cake the mouth in dryness!). An enjoyable beer that can be paired with any number of full-flavored dishes; and an excellent night-cap on cool summer nights when the sun has gone down and the moist air lays heavily in the back yard."
"The palate to this beer is flat with tea and honey. Back of the palate hop tannins become apparent. Finish is sweet and thick and wet."
"Overall i would recommend this beer on a hot summer day or night when you have friends over who want a new beer but not one so intense as to make them puckered up. I probably would not buy this beer again as there are hoppy pale ales in my area in which i can find the distinct bitterness in a more diverse flavor profile."
"Drinkability/notes: A well-crafted IPA. While I am not particularly a fan of heavily hopped beers, this one is quite well done  the hops are strong but not overpowering. An excellent introduction to the IPA style."
"Oh yeah baby, lots of Little Fernies a floatin in this beer, a hazy amber color the head modest, the texture frothy, the color and off white with a nice covering of lace. Sweet malt, light hop floral tone also noticed, quite sniffable, sweet malt start, the top moderate in feel. Finish has a definite acidic bite, the hops potent in their spicy bite, dry and long lasting aftertaste. A great beer from a great brewery got a couple of its bigger brother aging away, and that would be Maximus!"
"Thank you Morris729 for the bottle!"
"This beer is probably closer to an American Pale Ale than an IPA, because of its light hoppiness..but its a certainlly a tasty brew and well worth a try!"
"A very nice IPA. Lagunitas has created an IPA that does not create an overly strong taste for first time drinkers. The flowery hops are ever-present but not oppressively strong. This is a very drinkable beer that would go well with many different foods. Clever marketing descriptions and regional beer labeling create a nice overall package."
"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Not a bad IPA at all. Pours a murky golden amber color with a thick off-white head. The foamy head lasted quite a while. Nice lacing as well. Floral hops aroma. Flavor is very citrusy, and the hops are really not as bold as the glass progresses. Nicely bitter finish. Doesn't have the ""snap you with a wet towel"" hops that the great IPAs have but otherwise this beer is just fine."
"Bad ass hops here. Excellent hop nose as well. Very nice hop flavor. Smooth mouthfeel as well with a light body. The taste is very bitter as should be expected in an IPA. This is one of the better beers from Lagunitas. I enjoyed this one and will occasionally drink it again."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a huge thick and chunky white head that seems to last almost forever and leaves thick sheets of lace on the sides of the glass as you drink. Nose is floral and citrusy hops with only a faint hint of malt. Very inviting! Light to medium in body with a bit of a sticky mouthfeel. Only a small amount of sweet malts up front quickly overshadowed by bitter raw hop leaf flavors and notes of grapefruit rind. Finish is bone dry and hop resins are present in the lasting aftertaste. A very nice IPA, though I do prefer the Lagunitas Maximus IPA to this one."

"First Lagunitas product that I have tried. It is definitely on the hoppy side as declared in the little message on the bottle. Poured a decent head and dissipated over a minute or two. The beer has a pinkish copper color to it. It also has very fine pulp floating around, I'm guessing grapefruit since the beer has a pretty distinct grapefruit flavor. Definitely different than other IPA's I have tried. I say its a good tasting beer despite the fact that I'm not a huge hop fan. Average aftertaste and good drinkability."
"Orange amber in color. Ridden with particles. Hazy. Nice lace patterns left while drinking. Pungent, oily, flowery and sticky sweet maltiness on the nose. Very nice nose. The taste is more of the same...with a solid malt profile to handle the hop load. Hops are husky and resiny....herbal and flowery. Malt seems to be crystal/caramel based. Drinkability high. Overall a solid IPA. Yet another to add to the long list of IPAs I like from the West Coast."
"My second Lagunitas beer so far, and even after the excellent Pils, I’m very impressed yet again. I will have to check out some more offerings from this Brewery."
"It's got a nice glowing appearance:  gold with a hint of red and a big pillowy head that looks like it could float a quarter.  The hops fill your nose, leaving little room for any other aroma.  The taste matches the smell, with hops really dominating.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really have the malt flavor to back up the intense presence of the hops.  It has a slight metallic taste and is quite a bit dryer than the typical IPA.  The hop bitterness detracts from the drinkability.  It's not bad, but I'll choose other IPAs in the future."
"Pours a hazy but brilliant orange/amber color with a massive large bubbled off-white head.  Citrusy hop smell to get the mouth watering.  Definitely hoppy with citrus undertones that give it a grapefruit like overall taste.  It is a light bodied brew with a slightly sticky yet dry finish.  Has a lot of character, yet not highly complex.  Another note:  It still had a 1/2 finger head left with only 1 1/2"" of beer left in the glass!!!...and no, I didn't drink it extra fast ;-).  I'll give it a thumbs...uh...bottoms up.  Cheers!"
"Classic west coast hop-fest.  Pours clear gold with a thick white head.  Aroma and flavor are dominated by hops, with a little fruity malt fighting for attention.  SNPA con huevos."
"Not impressed with this brew. I couldn't pick out any one flavor in this beer and the after taste was to bitter for me, just nothing there. Not a very good IPA for my taste! But, that's me!"
"The label does not lie, 'homicidally hoppy ale', indeed.  This is a mighty fine beer. The appearance was mui appealing.  Very high head, light, foamy and sticky; topping a cloudy effervescent brew. Some nice lace on the way down the glass.  The veracity of the hops made it a bit like chewing on a piece of grapefruit rind, but that's part of the fun with this one.  There was a hint of malty sweetness up front, but it fades under pressure from the hops. I couldn't drink more than 2 at a time (I popped for a six-pack) but it's very well-suited for quaffing while you are kicking back and gnawing on some crusty bread."
"Slightly hazy copper color when poured from the 12oz. bottle. Minimal head that quickly dissipates. Citrus, grapefruity hop aroma. Fierce hop bitterness that mellows and becomes more estery as it warms. Semi-slick mouthfeel balanced by a prickly carbonation level. Good stuff...I could easily recommend this brew."
"A potent and bold IPA.  Muscular hop character.  Very hazey amber-orange swimming with sediments.  Citrus and floral signatures try hard to compete with an assertive bitterness.  Herbal and grass aromas intermix giving the perception of the outdoors captured in a bottle.  Prost!"
"Drink this before trying a Maximus - it will taste watery, but then so will most beers.  A really good IPA, it's a shame that it gets overshadowed by its brother brew.  Give this a try, an IPA to keep."
"One of the best IPAs I've had."
"This west coast IPA has a wonderfully pungent and citrusy nose, most likely from a combination of American 4 C (Cascade, Chinook, Columbus, Centennial) hops.  If you pour out the whole bottle you will have a VERY cloudy, almost nasty looking beer filled with yeast sediment.  It doesn't bother me at all, but be forewarned.  Assertive hop bitterness w/ a floral and pungent hop flavor... great malt backbone... smooth finish... GREAT IPA!!  OG: 1.057, IBU's 47, but it tastes MUCH bigger than that."
