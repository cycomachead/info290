"Hazy pale amber topped by a clingy white cap. Nose is herbal, leafy, citrus rind, touch of grain. Faintly tropical note suggests minimal usage of some new school hop probably mixed with a bunch of oldschool hops. Taste is okay - bitter citrus rind, leafy earthiness, ear wax, grapefruit. Pretty bitter and dry, slight astringent mouthfeel. Clean fermentation. Malt backbone feels somewhat substantial, but it's buried beneath a lot of bitterness. Not a great beer by any means, but nothing particularly bad about it. Can't say I'd want to drink it again."
"Cheers!!"

"Not so good in my opinion."

"Smooth and sweet, massive foamy head.  Big flavor, honey, mint, citrus, sugar, vanilla.  Slightly syrupy, but tightly carbonated.  Very good."
""
""
""
"Cloudy, almost murky, golden color.  Fluffy head that lasts all the way throughout the entire beer.  Smells citrusy, hoppy, a bit of pine or resin.  Very tasty IPA.  The hops are the main showcase of its flavor profile, but some citrusy grapefruit and resiny flavors balance it nicely.  Its brewed with some malt to keep it smooth.  This is enjoyable.  Highly recommended by me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very freshing beer with big hops."
""
""
"Great overall beer. The best new IPA I've tried in a few weeks."
""
""
""
""
"My current favorite go-to ipa. I like it slightly better than Sculpin, which is a pretty awesome ipa. If you like your ipa's to taste ""bright"" and be boozy yet frighteningly drinkable, this one's for you."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance 4.25, Aroma 4, Flavor 4, Palate 4, Overall 4"
""
""
"Sorry just don't like ipa's"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: so many IPAs I taste today feature citrusy or tropical fruit flavors; it was nice to get some pine character; not much complexity to it, but nice just the same;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a great beer from the get-go! Appearance is a huge cream-colored, long lasting head with lots of lace, and a clear, honey amber color. Aroma is equal parts grapefruit and resin with caramel malt and hints of cereal. Flavor’s just spot on balanced with perfect amounts of malt sweet, hop bitter, carbonic tang. Body is dialed in too. I want more!!"
"O- This is one of my go to beers. It is very nice and enjoyable. The price is right and the taste is right."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful light copper / dark orange color. Fantastic hop aroma - balanced and not  overwhelmingly bitter,  piney, floral, or citrusy. A perfect aroma if there ever was one. Tatse is  initially wonderful for hop lovers - more earthy and fruity than piney, then oh-so-slightly bitter towards the end, but more vegetative with citrus and floral undetones. Feel is perfect from my can poured into a slightly chilled pint glass. As close to perfection as I have tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber gold liquid topped by a quickly receding off white foam. Flowery-earthy, citrus and pine notes greet the nose. Tastes of mild grapefruit pith, unripe papaya, green apple, hints at pineapple. Moderate bitterness. Flavors and bitterness fade quickly into a biscuity malt which leaves the palate clean and refreshed. Medium body holds together well without faults. Overall this seems like a tasty, drinkable, enjoyably straightforward IPA that neither disappoints or distinguishes itself from many other excellent IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one really hits the spot on a warm day. I love it!"
""
"Meh, not really my thing. I guess this is for people who like their IPAs more bitter than flavorful."
""
"Great beer at a great price. This has become my go to beer.  The value of this beer is incredible. Quite bitter (which I love) but may not be everyone's favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Favorite IPA, top 5 for sure and 7.3 % ABV. Perfecto."
""
""
""
""
"Nice ipa. Just had my first and I am really enjoying this tasty treat"
""
"highest ba rated beer I've tried so far... I want to like it more but there are lower rated ipa's that i would take over this if made to choose. Taste is subjective so don't hate. still it's a really good beer."

"Poured into a Spiegelau (bottle date best by 5/6/15). I need to get better at picking the freshest IPAs... this might be a little off due to the fact that there are obviously fresher Hop Nosh to be had. Anyways. Really nice looking brew. Solid finger of foamy, eggshell head, slightly cloudy golden amber hue. Ample carbonation throughout. Up front bitterness on the nose, and a slight hint of pine. Kind of one note aroma. Some generic hop bitterness on the front of the tongue, bit of lemony citrus, a slight yeasty estery note (seemed out of place), just a hint of the 7.3% alcohol coming through as well. Refreshing mouthfeel, with a lingering bitterness. Clean, good I guess. Might try an ultra-fresh bottle to reconsider my review, but hard to justify that this is any different from all of the other IPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrific IPA. Citrus and pine hope with a solid malt backbone, complimenting sweetness with grapefruit in the aftertaste that lingers. Very smooth and well done."
""
"This is an exceptional IPA. Very floral and packs a great bitterness punch. Seems higher than the 82 IBU listed, but in a good way. Wicked good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Love this beer. It is a very solid IPA and i highly recommend it. I have had it in bottles and cans and for some reason the cans seem to taste even better yet"
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good, if I hadn't tried hop slam the same day this would have probably been even higher in my esteem. But I will buy this beer many more times"
""
"Overall: Nice balance in this but definitely weighs on the side of spicy hops and cedar."
"Delicious my first review and it's awesome"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark hazey orange with 2 finger head smell of citrus slight Pine taste the same over all good ipa but with these newer brews would be hard to go back to this"
"Very crisp and hoppy. Malty finish"
""
"Its ok. A little coney"
"This is a nice IPA with some malt balance.  Good clean flavors, grapefruit in particular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Holy cow.  This is an exceptional  IPA.  Very floral and packs a great bitterness punch.  Seems higher than the 82 IBU listed, but in a good way.  Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well  balanced IPA, Tastes like 5% IPA. This would make a great summer IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was surprised by this one. Great flavor, a little bitter which is what I am looking for in an IPA,  solid after taste. Worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer from Utah. Huh. But, here it is. Sold ipa goodness all around. A little heavy in grapefruit character. Tart and sweet play nicely off of on another. The finish isn't as dry as I like from my ipa's but I'm not kicking this out of bed. Not a west coast ipa, not east coast. I have no problem with the idea of picking this up again."
"*Overall: I am really impressed with this. Obviously, the IPA market is crowded, both what is on the shelves and in thousands of breweries, but I will likely look to have this in my fridge on a regular basis. Takes a lot to impress me this much with an IPA, but this is good."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a solid IPA though with the plethora on the market may get lost in the shuffle"
""
"A good IPA. I feel like I've had about 10,000 IPAs now, but this one was a good one. Hoppy, crisp, amber. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strange brew, lots of honey and hop notes. May have gotten and off brew as I'm looking at previous reviews."

"Outstanding IPA.  Without a doubt my favorite IPA.  Taste, smell, and look is top notch !!"

"Outstanding in body, aliveness, and pallette."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Great hop showcase, well-balanced.  A beautiful IPA."
""
"Have had the pleasure of tasting this on tap from the brewery, from a bottle and from a can. Very crisp and refreshing. Hop bite doesn't bite too hard and alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really freaking good. Bought two in a make your own six pack, I'll buy more. Delicious, refreshing, hoppy goodness. Hop Notch is Top Notch. Excellent."
""
""
""
"A very good IPA but not as notable as I had hoped given the reviews.  That's not a slight, as this is a very nice beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy but subtle, enjoyed the first one very much"
"Nice. Real nice. Four five"
""
"A very good IPA fresh, for sure. Mine are best before April 2, 2015."
""
"This is my preferred IPA"
""
"From can. Really great initial hoppy smell. Really hoppy and crisp. But the bitterness overwhelms the hops"
""
""
"Best before 2 27 2015.  Pours hazy golden from the can with about our finger of head.  Taste is awesome with the big hit of pine up front followed by subtle notes of citrus and some tropical fruit in the back.  Feels modest in the mouth with good carbonation.   Overall one of my go to ipa s any day of the week"
"Delicious fruity ipa with great aroma"
""
" A solid IPA. Really strong on the hops which is perfect for hops heads. I wish there was a bit more balance in the flavor, as I felt the hops slightly overwhelmed. However, I would look forward to trying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very drinkable IPA. It has a sweet, floral smell; it reminds me of white grape juice.  It has a sweet initial flavor and medium bitterness for an IPA.  It has a hazy golden appearance, with sediment in the bottle. This is definitely an IPA worth trying. As others mentioned, much better on draft."
""
""
""
"Nice body, citrus, piney... kind of like Hop Devil, and that's a good thing."
"Just a solid hoppy ipa."
""
""
"Tropical fruit tartness and creamy finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent on draft, bottled is underwhelming."
"A nice easy drinker ... draft is so much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really enjoyable IPA that, despite the name, doesn't blast you with hops, and sometimes that's just right. A nice, flavorful, easy drinking beer that will for sure be on my buy list once in awhile."
"Hoooray ! for IPA'S ,and hats off to Uinta Brewing for their spin it. If you are a fan of this style then Hop Nosh is a must try."

""
""
""
""

""
"Pours with a  furious, thick white head.  Golden orange in color.  Has a huge pine and floral aroma with light fruits and faint notes of caramel noticed.  Malt and grain up front but fine-tuned with a juicy hop bitterness and a perfumy ending.  I'm seeing more taste of Utah in my future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice, well balanced IPA.  I love both hop bombs and fruitier IPA's equally and this one does a nice job of incorporating both.  Up front is a citrus taste like lemon and grapefruit followed by a solid, but not overwhelming hoppy bitterness.  Extremely drinkable and still clocks in at a solid 7.3%abv this is one of my favorite IPA's and I'm glad it is now available in SC!"

"A very nice IPA.  Very hoppy so not for those that do not appreciate that quality in a craft beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful color on this beer from a 12oz bottle. Cloudy apricot color. Smell is hops with a side of hops. Taste is hops up front with a smooth malty finish. Just a good beer to drink. It drinks kind of like a double. Mouth feel is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely better in the can than the bottle. Not the most impressive IPA out there but a good west coast option. Very piney with that florescent green feeling"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, maize color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of citrus hops, resin, hint of alcohol, sweet malt, and slight pine.  Fits the style o of an American IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, resin, citrus hops, and a hint of caramel malt.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
""
"This Utah classic remains my fav West Coast style IPA- with the perfect balance of bitter pine and citrus hop flavor. Malt takes a back seat. 7.3 % ABV- so it's a potent IPA.  Hop Nosh is sold in both bottles and 12oz cans (2014) -no taste difference noted. I'm lucky it is available in the Eastern Mid-Atlantic (Total Wine)."
""
""
"This beer really surprised me.   Lots of hops  on the nose - citrus and floral.  Flavor follows the nose, but some caramel malt sweetness adds some balance.  This is a really good IPA."

"Overall - This is a West Coast style hop bomb to be sure. An interesting ale but I wish the malt backbone was a touch more pronounced. Not quite the balanced, full-bodied flavor of a Sierra Nevada of a Firestone pale ale but still very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is quite enjoyable, especially after it has time to settle in the pint glass.  It is a just a little too bitter and high in alcohol for me, but I am sure many will not agree.  After trying a few mild and gentle  4.0 % ABV beers from this brewery, this ale came as a surprise."

"A slightly amber golden color with about a finger of creamy looking head. Incredible lacing letting you know the history of each sip. Nice hop aroma; floral, citrus, a touch of pine are all accurate descriptors. On the palate malt shows up and balances the hops nicely with a slightly toasted, more biscuity flavor. A bit of caramel too. The pinnacle of a balanced IPA. Citrus comes through on  the tongue too. Overall very well balanced, dangerously easy drinking, and a great example of and american IPA. (Bonus points for being in a can :) )"
""
""
""
"Light copper color, good amount of bitter. Has a citrus nose with pine. Great beer."

"Really good. Never was a fan of APA's until I had this. Found a single bottle of it at my local grocery store. Figured i would try it out. Well worth it."
"Hop Nosh IPA has been a wonderful taste bud experience, I've enjoyed it thoroughly. I was shocked to see it was from salt lake city, I haven't tried much/anything else from there."
""
""
""
""
"the un-skunkd one was a pretty good hop bomb!"
""
""
""
""
"A pleasantly hoppy, and duly balanced IPA, the flavours all meshing nicely.  Any extra alcohol is well integrated, making this a warming and enjoyable tipple - Utah be representin'!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit much for my liking but no question it's a west coast style IPA.  Far from a session beer but enjoyable on a cool fall evening."
""
""
""

""
"O - A little too bitter in the finish for my liking but still at great IPA."

"Overall, really solid IPA.  Even though it doesn't have my favorite type of hop profile, the delicate balance really makes it great.  It doesn't go too far in the direction of being resiny and piney, and it doesn't go too far in the direction of being overly malty either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An absolutely top-notch IPA (pun intended). This is a west coast, hop bomb style IPA done right; superb balance, very drinkable; actually, dangerously drinkable at 7.3% ABV. A great bargain at $8.99 p/six as well!"

"Taste / Palate: The base malt adds some grainy bready maltiness and some sweetness which props up the fruity hops. The hops bring a full on blast of mango, peach and a touch of white grape up front. This quickly moves on to more bitter notes of citrus rind. It seems to finish quickly but a light pine like hop bitterness creeps back in on the tongue. The palate feels fairly full and we’ll carbonated. This as well as its 7.3% abv makes for a nice slow sipping beverage."

"Pours a hazy orangish brown with almost perfect head. Head retention diminishes but stays solid throughout. Nice lacing. The nose is very floral with bright citrus. The taste is smooth with balanced hop and malt. The finish explodes with the hops and trails off with the bitterness. Nice beer."

"This is an outstanding IPA....Love this style. Totally balanced, not to hoppy, clean, full of flavor. Took a chance on this one....glad I did."

"Overall: A solid American IPA.  Comparable to Sierra Nevada Torpedo, but slightly more bitter.  Good malt backbone, but a little ,more hop forward, and a bit heavy.  I think I can get better locally."
"I was very pleasantly surprised with this IPA! It is incredibly smooth and refreshing. On the nose I get bright citrus notes of tangerine and orange peel with a lighter grassy hint to freshen it up. I love how this IPA has elements of a good wheat beer. For Instance, it's appearance is slightly cloudy with a thick foamy head which gives off very citrusy aromas. It has a very smooth and creamy taste with wonderful notes of orange, vanilla, and pine to finish it off with that fresh bite every good IPA has. In my opinion, this beer is very skillfully done and an absolute pleasure to drink."

"Excellent IPA"
""

"While this was the first IPA that I liked. Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' was like this beer but a tad bit toned down. A lot less bitters (64 IBU rating). Check that beer out too!"

"O: Hop Nosh is a good IPA which taste like it is crafted with new hops varieties with all of the melon, berry, and grassy-herbal flavors. The flavors mesh moderately well which limits this beer's drinkability to some degree. It is a little hop-sweet in my opinion -- the honeydew melon quality is very strong and a little of it goes a long way."

"The Rest: Decent, but the balance I look for in a really good IPA was a bit lacking on on this one."

"O: A really nice, really solid American IPA. The flavor profile here is more or less great. Uinta continues to impress me."
""
""
""
"Probably a one and done, but Raul ain't too mad."
""
""
""
"This is listed at 7.3% but it drinks much more like an 8-9% double IPA with the heavy resin texture on the mouth. Nice appearance, a really nice hop profile on the nose, with some citrus, floral, pine resin all mixed together nicely IMO. This beer is very under-rated and its an outstanding IPA. Very flavorful with a nice full bodied balanced mouthfeel and a citrus/pine hop balance with only moderate bitterness in finish. Definitely a go-to option for American IPA fans and hop heads as this one is easy to find and always available. I highly recommend this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I don't like this one. It is bitter with no sweetness or citrus to balance it out. There was also a weird metallic taste and aftertaste. I would definitely pass on this one in the future."

"A very pleasant surprise from this little yellow can. The taste is very hoppy and clean. The smell was very fresh. And the ABV was high enough to pack a nice punch. I strongly recommend this beer, especially for IPA fans that don't like the sticky citrusy IPA. This IPA is mountain fresh."

""

"Wow.  Had in bottle and can.  I must say the can is 100xs .  Hop aroma is more intense.  Maybe freshness caused .  Very drinkable and easy to get. For my money really hard to beat.  Bitterness is perfect crisp on the tongue but cleans very nicely.  Carbonation is perfect.  Would love to try on tap"

""
"Verdict: A very nice IPA from Uinta. This can definitely changed my perception of this beer, perhaps before, all my experiences, including draft, were from older and less fresh kegs/cans/bottles, but I am very impressed with this when fresh. Bright, balanced and refreshing, everything one could ask for in an IPA."

"This hop nosh brew is great. First off the bottle Is nice, it has a little compass indented into it, a nice thing to appreciate for a couple seconds. This definitely tastes different from your IPA, smells different, and is a complete different experience. Very fruity taste and that is awesome, I've had in bottle and glass, glass is more flavoring and goes down a bit better while bottle is a bit stronger. Definitely recommend this beer for all"

"O - what can I say. This is an excellent IPA."

"OK, I'm a big DIPA fan but let's face it - at $14 a four-pack for top-tier craft DIPAs, you may want a reasonably-priced six-pack alternative. And sometimes, you'd like the DIPA sensory indulgence but don't really need 9-10% ABV. Here's where Hop Nosh (formerly ""Hop Notch"") comes in. At 7.5% it's classified as a regular IPA, but on the strong - robust end of that category. However, the taste, the aroma, the complexity, the hop-forwardness; all say ""DIPA."" Not as big or as bold as say, a 10% Great Divide Hercules, but at 82 IBUs, there's a lot of ""there"" there. And what's there is delicious. My local price on Hop Nosh is $9 a six-pack - $1.50 a can compared to $3.50 a bottle for Hercules. Hoppy, yeasty, bready - this is a fabulous IPA and a pretty darned good DIPA alternative at over 50% off. It's now one of my staples."

"Wow, what agreat beer. Nice orange-brownish color with a very nice expected head that dissipates at just the right speed. First flavor seems to be like hay, but quickly goes to a nice hoppy, crisp, clean finish. The carbonation is just right and leaves a clean, yet flavorful finish. Also, with the hay, a touch of citrus, maybe grapefruit??. Overall, one of the best beers I have had in awhile and will definitely seek this one out a gain. Great brewer. Keep up the good work"

"Overall: When I first had this a couple years ago my mind was blown and haven't had it since until now, and I gotta say, this is one of those beers that I enjoy as much as I did back then. Its very true to the style and everything I want in a IPA. Balanced between fruity and pine hops, and sweet malts. Very fresh aroma and taste. Not too bitter and goes down smooth. The price is right also. Hands down one of my favorites in the style, and this six pack is making me wonder why I don't have this more often. I will, let me tell you."

"P.S. My girlfriend HATES beer.. had her try a sip of this.. she stole the glass away.. yeah its that good"

""
"The beer drinks towards a small American barleywine. Not really the flavor profile I’m looking for in an IPA."
""
""
"The roasted malts start things out in the flavor but the floral and grassy hopes kick in pretty fast and tend to take things over. A nice bitter finale."

"Taste is heavy-duty, high alpha hops through and through. I get notes of sticky pine, citrus, and a lingering bitterness. Hop Nosh is a superlative hop bomb, and one I thoroughly enjoyed. Would love to try a brand new, fresh bottle one day, but meantime, this is a wonderful IPA, no doubt about it."

"Overall - Really a very nicely done ipa, I like the citrus and floral forward flavors here. The floral does not get grainy as it does in some others, and the lightly dry and bittering finish begs the next quaff. If you like citrus, tropical and floral hops, give this one a try."

"O--I've generally been impressed with Unita beers, but I've never had an IPA with them. I'm definitely impressed. IPAs generally aren't my style but I found this to be smooth and drinkable. Also of not. label artwork is great, despite the renaming.. I enjoyed mine from a bottle into a pint glass with a best before date of 7/7/14."
"Enjoy-"
"This is my first overall review, and just getting into the beer scene. Started home brewing 7 months ago, and really getting into IPAs."
"O-Nice drinker. Lacks the green hop aroma/taste that I enjoy, but has enjoyable malt/fruit flavors. It'd be easy to kick several back though."

"A great west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""

"This beer has a pretty drinkable feel and is medium bodied to give it enough of a feeling like this beer has substance but is still pretty light for the ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a chilled glass. Forms a one finger head, then beautiful clinging lacing. Hazy unfiltered medium amber color. The aroma is distinctive--not just grapefruit, but smells like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Reall exhilarating! The flavor starts out with malt and hops, then develops a strong bitter finish that us terrific. The mouth feel is medium thick, not quite chewy. Overall this is an outstanding IPA with a unique character."
"Body is a little weak and thin. it's not a huge downer tho. Overall the beer is tasty and I'll happily drink it anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Soon."
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a clear orangey amber with a big creamy eggshell head. The head has great retention and leaves big sticky lacing. The aroma is primarily floral and citrus hops with a nice caramel malt sweetness. The taste is mostly hops and little of the caramel malt. The beer is a little lighter on the palate than I would have expected but there is a good smoothness to it with just a little crisp hops bite on the finish. A great IPA."

" over all its a very good ipa and one that you should try,i enjoyed it a lot and would buy it again.now their is nothing that stands out about this beer either i guess i should point out but hey everything doesnt have to be earth shattering or ground breaking.i love ipa and this just gives me another ipa to put in my go to list."
""
"Pours a mostly clear amber with big off-white colored head. Lots of lace splattered on the glass as it slowly settles to a small cap. Smell: apricot, grapefruit, tropical fruit note, mini dank. Taste: pineapple, tropical note, citrus rind, sugary pale buried in lots of hop flavor and bitterness. Very nice."

"O- A nice everyday year-round IPA. Hope to get some on-tap or a fresher bottle sometime. I enjoyed the fruity aroma and the sweetness but wish the fruit was more apparent in the taste, which was more floral and piney. I know with IPAs the fruity flavors are the first to go so hopefully a fresher bottle would be more fruity."

""

"Perhaps I should rate it higher than 4.00 overall. Still, I would gladly suggest it to other beer lovers. It's also very good to have beginning beer learners try."

""
"poured a dark golden. aroma fresh, earthy. a little sugary, floral, citrus, all subtle but mingling. flavor has spice up front and wet. as it goes down, citrus, pineapple comes out, finishes pretty dry and bitter. this is overall a great easy drinking, not too bitter ipa, juicy"

"After finally learning to correctly pronounce the name (You-In-Ta), I settled into one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted. A perfect blend of piney and citrus notes, hop bitterness is fantastic. Lacing all up and down the glass, perhaps the most I've ever seen. I would inject this IPA directly onto my tongue 24 hours a day."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: spicy orange hop flavors are the centerpiece to this.... it's a refined brew, though it's taste, within the vast realm of IPAs, isn't particularly memorable.... a quite serviceable hoppy ale, nonetheless"
"Picked up a case at our biggest local distributer in PA with a 5/27/14 date. Noted name has changed to HOPNOSH fom Hop Notch. Loads of hoppy aromas and flavors. Fresh and clean with nice malty background. Loved it so much, opened a 2nd bottle. Have had this before. Always very good"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Looks great with golden color, great clarity and a fluffy white head with fantastic lacing. And great aroma with loads of citrusy hops. But the flavor was a let down. The hops just weren't assertive enough. And the mouthfeel was nothing special. A good beer but not a great IPA."
""
""
""
"Poured amber/honey color with thick foamy head - about 2 finger's width. Excellent lacing on side of the glass. Grassy, piney smell with hints of citrus. Piney hoppy bitterness upfront when tasting. There is a hint of citrus at the end, but the grassy hops persist throughout. The bitter aftertaste is not too strong and not too weak. Just right. There is a slight malty character in the middle, but it is not a major part of the beer. Even, though, this is an excellent IPA. I recommend all those who like hoppy beers to give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I stated with the earthy taste comment, I don't get a citrus feel as with other breweries. As far as a regular IPA goes, try it. Not bad, but in my opinion this beer reaches the level a beer should be but does not exceed it. But being diplomatic, we all have our little nuances and preferences we expect. Cheers. :)"
""
"O: One hoppy IPA. I prefer a bit more balance in mine. But if you are trying to get your hop fix in, this has a very nice hop profile. I'd drink it again, but not going to be my go to IPA."

"O - Hop Notch is a dandy of an American ipa. It's really a perfect example of an American ipa. In fact, I believe Uinta's hop notch is a perfect example of just how great American made craft beer is today. They not only brew in a way not many can pull off, but they are just producing some fine crafted brews these days. Hop Notch is a winner and some of the best stuff on the planet. Easy to find and available year round!? You bet ill be enjoying plenty of these."
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent IPA, one of my favorites in the style and from this particular brewery."
"12oz can with Enjoy by 3-14-14 stamped underneath the can. Pours a translucent orange color with over an inch of frothy white head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is piney and floral hops with some light citrus notes. The taste is floral hops with some pine as well. Cut grass, orange peel and almost a soapy floral taste. Bitter floral finish. Light alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation. Overall, its a decent beer but nothing special."
""
""
""
"While it doesn't have the je ne sais quoi of Sculpin or Lunch it's definately in that 1B IPA tier of Baxter Stowaway and the like. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love how this ale is dry, clean and crisp. But its leafy and grassy taste is a bit too prevalent to celebrate its only moderate citrusy smooth tones. Its an all-day, every-day beer that will find comfort in my glass at any time."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- From start to finish this beer satisfies and leaves me wanting to try out more beers this company has to offer."
"O- a solid, drinkable, IPA. Very well balance with hop flavor/bitterness and malt sweetness. One of my favorite IPAs to drink as it is very drinkable dispute the abv."

"After trying this wonderful IPA, I am going to peruse the other beers Uinta Brewing Company has to offer. I highly recommend this IPA to any hoppy people out there. Cheers!"

""

"Pours s lightly hazy dark golden color that borders on amber with a huge fluffy whit head that persists for quite a while. Aromas of citrus and pine with some faint green onions and a solid hit of bready caramel malt to back it up. The flavor is actually quite malt forward with lots of sweet bread and rich caramel and toffee notes. Pine, resin, and a bit of green onion flavor provides a bit of balance. Firm hop bitterness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy and resinous mouthfeel. My can shows a best before 1/25/14 I'm not sure when that means it was bottled, but I found this a bit malty for an IPA. Decent enough and drinkable, but I'd grab something else before this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, easy drinking, despite the kick, which is not overt. Up there with some of the best if you like juicy IPAs like Sculpin. 4.25"

"O - This is a solid brew for any IPA drinker. IMO, this should be considered a DIPA, the flavor and ABV state the same. Very nice piney notes accompanied by great resin, citrus undertones and dryness make this a good session beer. I will be having this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty darn decent IPA, not overwhelming but it has some nice citrus and pine hops characteristics that I like."
""
""
""
"This a pretty standard ipa. Certainly not offensive, but nothing special."
"This is a solid brew. Look and smell are better than the taste, though…and it feels better than the flavor reward. But, it does its job simply. The bitter end begs for food--a nice greasy burger is my suggestion."
""
""
"I'm gonna be honest with the beer world. All of the geeks who say Pliny is the greatest, or heady topper. Hop Notch is the best bang for your buck out of any beer. Go find 35 bucks in your couch cushin and buy a case. Stone or Bells couldn't carry this beers lunch. Unless you live in Vermont this is the king of ipa's. Don't let the generic label fool you. Your drinking Hop Notch your living high class. Peace my beer drinking brothers"

"Saw this beer at express lane tonight and on a hunch I bought it. The smell of this beer is fantastic. The taste is good going down but the taste lingers long after. This is a fantastic beer that is sold across us. I will defiantly be drinking this beer in the future. It pours nice with a thick head and the color is dark yellow."
"Went well with Paulina meats. Not the best IPA I've ever had but far from the worst. Would drink again, though would not pick it over a 90 min ipa or the like"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First time I had this and I was completely surprised how great this beer is. Very comparable to Pliny...yes it is that good. And for the price...7 a six pack at total wine. Can't beat that. It's a very fresh ipa that has the hints if rosemary, pine, and some Orange peel. You must do yourself a favor and try this if you havnt already...."

"Uinta was the bottled craft beer available at the Rio in Vegas. Poured into a juice tumbler (all I had in my hotel room). Slightly hazy gold color with a creamy foamy cap. Some large bubbles. Piney citrus aroma - orange, grapefruit, papaya. Mainly pine in the taste. A rock solid IPA. Enjoyable."

"Poured a nice clear amber with a half finger white head that receded to a ring of white and left nice lacing down the glass. It's a good looking American IPA, entirely true to style. Scents of citrus, mostly grapefruit and some pineapple, grassy hops, a bit of floral hops a very faint hint of pine and a bit of caramel malt sweetness. It's a good, standard West Coast IPA scent, very on style for an American IPA. Taste begins with piney hops, some floral hops sustained throughout, moving into some grapefruit pith on the middle of the sip. A nice caramel malt sweentess also balances the bitter hops in the background throughout the sip. Aftertaste is bitter with slight floral notes. As the beer warms the hop profile becomes dominated by grapefruit with slight floral notes. The flavor is like the aroma, very true to style, well crafted and hoppy, a good West Coast American IPA flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a bit drying a finish with a slight alcohol burn. Quite nice, true to style, with maybe a bit more alcohol burn than most American IPAs. Overall this is a very good American IPA, it fits the style perfectly and is just a nice good American IPA. Given it's price this will probably become my go-to IPA."
"TOTAL = 36/50"

""
""
"Got in a trade as an extra, but forget from who. THANKS! Pours a nice dark gold/orange/light copper hue with a small white head. Honestly, this thing smells fantastic. Great floral, pine, grapefruit, mango, pineapple coming off the nose. Such an unassuming bottle. A nice hop bitterness, with grapefruit up front and on the way down, with a definite lingering pine on the palate. Hop bite all the way through. Carbonation is lower than I expected. Really easy drinking, and could be mistaken for a session IPA. An unexpected surprise. Will have to seek out more from Uinta."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is my first foray into the world of Uinta beers, and it seems I've picked a good place to start. This IPA has the punch you in the face hop profile that so many love about the style, but uses hop profiles that prevent this from being a bitter bomb. I've made sure to get my fill of them while in Las Vegas, since alas Uinta doesn't distribute to the Kansas City area."
""
"O- If I saw this in a bar I would order it, but only if the options were limited. I only purchased one bottle just to try it. I was in the mood for a new IPA. I was not disappointed, but I wasn't blown away. It is a decent offering. Uinta is a nice brewery and I am glad to see their beers in New York now."
""
""
""
"Pours a darker straw color, very clear, decent head. The smell is a bit skunky and just a touch oniony, it's all hops, and pretty good, but not quite enough of the floral/citrus/fruity side for my tastes. The taste is very good, but same issue for me. Well made, well priced beer that I would drink again, but I wish the hop bill could be tweaked a little."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite enjoyable."
""
"Very good showing by Uinta. It looks like they can do that hop thing too."
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid beer. It packs a nice hoppy punch and sets you down softly. Nice hop finish lingers around - not too harsh - just right. This could make it to a new regular brew status. I do appreciate that it is 7.3% but hardly noticeable and brewed with renewable power. Watch out Sierra Nevada..."
""
""
"Ah, canned beers have come along way over the past few decades..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - ultimately, a solid IPA. I usually give a little extra love for craft beer in a can, for convenience, though this one may be limited due to the fact it's in a can."

"I have had this beer before buy had not done a full review, wanted to see how it stood up after each category rating. Outstanding looking and smelling beer that is tasty, but still has to much bitter followup for my personal taste. Overall a decent beer."

"Poured copper with a strong, fluffy buttercream/ivory head that really sticks around leaving thick, cloudy lacing. Smells of melons, grapefruit, and pine with some sourdough and peach. It's sharp and slightly tart, very piney, some lemon rind, good deal of bitterness in the middle, sweet lemon verbena and orange, quinine in the finish. Full and effervescent, sharp on the tongue. Overall very good in the beginning and kind of devolved into a bubbly, bitter drink."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, developed a great full head which lasted and laced well. Head had a creamy, off white appearance and the beer was slightly hazy with a dark golden color. Aroma was very hoppy with floral and citrus notes. Tasted floral and spicy with some grain noted and a good hop finish. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry lingering aftertaste."

"O: Solid stuff. Not blown away by it, but it's good."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - 4.75 - Great beer, amazing for the price (@ 6.99/6 pack). This will probably be my go to day to day IPA from now on. Maybe years from now I can just not worry about price at all but this one is so good anyway it doesn't matter."

"O-This is very solid beer and my favorite so far from Uinta. The hops are aggressive, but not harsh, and flavors are pretty tasty. The smell is particularly impressive and it is rather good-looking, too. This brew may lack the balance to compete with the best in the crowded field of IPAs, but I would certainly drink this again."

"By no means terrible, but disappointing and overpriced - while I still like this brewery, there is really no place for a sub-par IPA in today's craft beer market."
"Bottle: Poured a orangey/bright amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh citrus and light piney notes with lightly sweet malt backbone is quite enjoyable. Taste is a mix between some citrus notes with some light piney and fruity hoppy notes as well as a lightly sweet malt backbone (but no caramel malt which is nice). Body is quite full with good carbonation. Easy drinking with plenty of flavours."

"Pretty dang good IPA here actually from a brewery I haven't thought much about. The flavors are there, not overpowering, but present and clean. Very drinkable."
""
"Very good, solid IPA; worth having multiple times"
"Unita's IPA glides into the glass nice without a overabundant head. The liquid is a very clear golden color with a small amount of amber peeking through. The cap is an inch of white foam with decent retention and OK clinging ability. Smell is what you would expect, hopped up nicely with a big malty background. I can smell the alcohol pretty clearly. Some tropical fruit scent coming off and a bready malt bill. Taste is a very hop forward ale with a sweet side to it. The malts come first and than some alcohol, reminding me of some East coast DIPA'S. After that the hops form a bitter seal on the tounge and cling for a good amount. A grassy aftertaste is left and the alcohol stays. feel is right dead center medium and a bit syrupy. Easy drinking beer but a bit rough around the edges."

"Even though this was listed as an IPA, it felt like a Pale Ale from start to finish, Deceptively strong but also easy to quaff, this felt like a West Coast beer even though it wasn't from California. There's enough to like here and almost makes it stand above the crowd, but that's only because of how many good competitors are out there. This is worthy nevertheless and worth a try for any hophead that loves a beer that's tasty and well-balance. Easily the best offering Uinta currently on the shelf."

"A truly enjoyable brew. If I was an IPA lover, this would have an even higher rating from me."
"Overall - Solid brew, doesn't necessarily stand out in the vast sea of this style but still it is a solid brew and it is respectable. I wouldn't turn one down!"
""

"o: An exceptional IPA, very drinkable and refreshing. The ongoing pine nose keeps you alert to what you are drinking."
""
""

"Pours burn orange with a phenomenal white head and lace. Picture perfect. The smell is just ok. A bit hoppy and sweet. The taste is like the smell, not too overpowering and hit sweet and hops at times. There is a little tounge burn out going on here. Sort of tastes like a west coast IPA with a bit of the piney hops taste. It does have a creamy light feels. Overall, it's enjoyable but I'm not going to run out and grab more."

"Best by date of 10-25-13. Would like to try it in the canned version to rule out bad handling, etc."
""
""
""
"O: Nearly a world-class IPA; just falls a little short in the aroma department. Tilted more toward hop bitterness rather than flavor and aroma, maybe a slight resemblance to the unjustly derided ""East Coast IPA"" of 10-12 years ago, but it works well here."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass; clear golden orange with a medium fluffy white head that sticks as a disc of foam leaving delicate lacing. Smell is herbal and piney hops, overtop of subdued crackery malt. Taste has even more pronounced hop flavor; citrus peel, pine and herbal flavors meld, with a good but not strong biscuity malt presence. Alcohol is a bit noticeable at 7.3%, mouthfeel is clean and a bit spiky."

"Bitter, Bitter IPA. Not a fan of the Bitter aftertaste common in the IPA. However, This has some compliments worth stating in this category. The immediate taste is refreshing, hard to describe, but a grassy finish helps compliments the IPA immediate taste, but the aftertaste is still fairly bitter. I am usually extremely against IPA's but this is probably one I could manage with in this category, be it the pine and grass hint, or strong hops? unsure. Probably would not try again but would recommend if you enjoy IPA's. The best IPA for me but IPA is my least favorite style."

"I used to enjoy IPA's in just the colder months-thought they were kinda heavy for the summer. Fast forward to the last few years, the number of tasty not too heavy IPA's is enough to keep me from having to switch to a pilsner when it's 90 out. Big fan of this one."
"I for one am going to be drinking it as long as my local gas station carries it (@$10.99 a 6er. Kinda high, imo, but I'm glad they carry craft beers, so....)."

"Pours a dark orange color with finger and a half tannish white head that goes down slowly and leaves a blanket of lacing. Smells of light grapefruit, some pine, some grass, oranges, a resinous quality to it, some light bready notes as well as some carmel sweetness. Taste is pretty much like the smell. It starts with grapefruit, oranges, and lemon. Then the malt comes in and balances the beer fairly well. Lots of sweet breadiness. Then the hops of the more bitter variety come back. Lots of resinous pine, as well as some grapefruit and oranges. Nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel to accompany the resinous hops. Medium body. The bitterness lingers after each sip. Wouldn’t mind getting this again. Decent ipa that comes in cans."

"Pours a true amber with an orange tint and slight haze. What a looker this beer is with a thick head of foam that slowly fell to to some chunky lace and nice legs too. Nose is grapefruit, pine and grass. A great big whiff of bread but then the malt disappears for a minute behind some herbal and grassy dank. Malt presence in the nose is ultimately very soft, sweet caramel and cookie. Taste is delightful with ample malts, lots of oily piney hops, a little bit of sour grapefruit. This beer was like silk on the palate. Some said watery and I disagree. The malt was cultivated to perfection underneath the hops bitter and leaned into the dry finish with a sweetness on the back that was supple and full. Bitterness fades fast in the aftertaste as this one leaves smooth and the definition of dry. Hop Notch is top notch."

"Fantastic beer. The hop profile is not particularly complex, and the malt is clean, but deep tasting at the same time with lingering flavors of what I would call peach at the finish. The mouthfeel is utterly smooth and almost creamy. The ABV is pretty high, but you could never tell through taste. At $6.49 a six pack, I think I found my new favorite beer. Thank god it's not a seasonal. Now it comes in cans! I can't wait to try it."

"My first Uinta from Utah, I love the bottle you can get drunk and magnetize it and use it as compass since the glass is etched with cardinal directions. I've already drank half of the six pack and I'm really enjoying it so far, pours a brilliant copper color with slightly off white billowing head, leaves fine speckled lacing. Aroma big dank earthy citrus and a bit of the fine mary jane like resinous cannabis, light biscuit caramel malt backbone just barely present. Flavor upfront big juicy hops, pine, citrus, earthiness resinous flowing notes with a hint of malt in the backend, finishes semi dry I like the hops in this bottle. I will call it an almost west coast IPA, pretty damn good. Incredibly easy to guzzle, the hops don't linger with razor sharp bitterness yet have complex hop notes all day, I really dig the vibe I'm getting here. Resinous medium bodied hop oils glide well across my palate with sturdy carbonation, classic IPA."

"I utilized an aggro pour, causing the formation of a dense finger of tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was of resinous piney hops and having come from a high school no-hitter this afternoon, it reminded me of pine tar. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were notched up to the point of unmistakability. I now wonder where the demarcation line between an AIPA and a DIPA actually lies. It is somewhere around this brew. Great lacing began to form in my glass as I drank. Finish was actually only semi-dry, which is surprising, given the level of IBUs that this must register. If this measures up from a CAN, my cooler may have a new friend."

"Overall: I went back and forth on this brew, and waited until my last one from the six pack to review it. I couldn't decided whether this brew was something special or a pretty average IPA. I ended up in the middle of those two, this is better then many, but there are also many better. Not exactly a summer IPA, too heavy for a warm summer day of drinking, but nice to end an evening with a little pop."
""
"This was better than I expected. Both the malt and hop profile are a bit odd, but it's charming in its own way. It has a nice aroma that pulls things together. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but a little above average."

"O- Outstanding offering from Uinta. The 7.3 abv is well hidden and this IPA is highly drinkable. One might have a six pack without realizing they had gone too far. I regret looking at this beer for more than two years and turning my nose up because I thought it seemed to be too ""organic looking"" for me. I guess that is my fault for shopping for labels and not good brews."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/6/2013. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, tangerine, pine resin, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, pine resin, floral, light caramel, bread, grass, and floral earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine resin, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice flavor balance of pine/citrus hops with a light-moderate malt balance; and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, very sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Good complexity of hop flavors with a solid malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"This isn’t a huge hop blast of an IPA, but as we enter the warmer months, a beer like this is very enjoyable. It’s a very easy drinking beer that would be a great session beer if not for it’s relatively high alcohol content (of which there is virtually no sign in the taste). Even so, if you’re not going anywhere, you could do a lot worse than see the evening out with a few bottles of Hop Notch."
"Overall impression: Grapefruit bomb IPA. May not be for everyone but I love it. Glad Uinta finally made it to Ohio!"
""
"O - Was in VA looking for some awesome beer I cant get in SC. Didn't really see anything too recognizable (slightly disappointed) but I went with the Hop Notch (I had heard of unita but was not familiar with them). I'm glad I picked this one out - not my favorite IPA but I'd consider it a wonderful ""introductory"" ipa - not too overwhelming but extremely well balanced and drinkable."

"A clear copper in color with a small head. Aromas of pine and grapefruit. Taste begins with some toffee, then a big citrus rind flavor, finishing with pine-cone flavor. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a very nice IPA, its quite flavorful with plenty of hop punch."

""
""
""
"D - A very well rounded American IPA... Approachable enough for the masses and interesting enough for BAs... Goes down easily and hides the 7+% ABV rather well... Wouldn't be my first choice in the beer aisle, but it wouldn't be to far behind either... After a bad initial experience with Uinta, brews like Hop Notch are starting to win my respect back..."
""
"Poured a golden-amber into a clear glass mug. Had a quarter inch of fizzy head before it dissipated. Smells aggressively hoppy. Very bitter and well hopped but just on the edge of being over hopped and unpleasant. Decently crisp and tongue-numbing. 4/5 overall."
"Pours a cool, crisp amber just a few weeks after bottling into my SammySmith pint. The bright white head leaves lacing up and down clinging to the body. Thicky oiley hops dominate the nose, hints of candy pinnapple and biscuit malt finish. It's amazing how smooth this drinks! Sweet Citrus hops burst after a caramel opening. Mandrin oranges dance into piney bitterness and the backbone of malt sweetness delivers a nice, smooth easy drinking ale."
"O - Wonderful beer. Excellant flavor and aromas. Very close to a world class beer."
"There's a fluffy sort of lightness on the tongue, but with a good, firm body to it. Carbonation is consistent and makes for a nice, creamy flow. Resins add a little stickiness initially, but it really goes smooth."
"Citrus bomb that satisfies every time."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity. This leads to a mouthfeel that is slightly foamy, never prickly, but also somewhat smoothly stagnant. A bit more carbonation would do a good deal for this beer, or at least this bottle. Closes quite dry, with medium-level stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
"My only complaint with this beer is that the flavor doesn't linger longer. Luckily I was drinking this beer with dinner, and drier beers tend to shine with food."
"I absolutely loved this beer. Great anytime IPA. Citrus nose, nice bitter flavors with a malt backbone that smooths everything out. Not exactly session-able at 7%, but I can definitely crack a few of these in a row and be perfectly content. Great 'Everyman IPA'."
""
""
"Overall: A well-balanced beer; though not among my favorites, this beer is certainly an enjoyable example of the style"

"Eco friendly brewery that makes very quaffable beer. Hop Notch IPA is a good example of an IPA. Crisp, hoppy, and smooth malt finish.

"Pours a very clear orange-amber with a couple fingers of appealing, foamy white head that settles slowly and leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is of pleasant, orange-peel citrus, sweet, fresh-baked bread and the faintest hint of booze. Flavor is nice and well-rounded, with a fairly hop-bitter aftertaste like that of pine. Mouthfeel is appropriately medium-bodied. I loved the can, and can say I'm not disappointed with its contents."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the bottle into a pint glass, slightly chilled this sturdy IPA shows a slightly hazed amber color with a decent off-white fuzzy head and good weblike lacing. There's a beautiful caramel-pine and nutty oak aroma. The taste is intense pine hop softened by caramel-toffee sweetness and orange citrus bite. There's some herbal leafy ideas tossed in. I would say it's a bit cloying with a medium-plus body and somewhat syrupy in feel. The carbonation is gentle but does the job to cut through reasonably. Not bad at all, arguably a mighty big IPA."
""
""
""
"Add this to my list of good quality American IPAs to recommend. I won't seek it out unless I happen to find myself the southwest (I like to stick with local offerings once I've tried them), but it's a damned tasty IPA that is worth trying."

""
""

"Overall I'm glad I got to this fresh, as the it's nice as crisp. Reminds me slightly of Lagunitas Maximus somewhat. Been eyeing Hop Notch for some time now. Cheers."
"Really like this one ! Great aroma greets you right away. One of my absolute favorites, mouth feel is great. The bitterness is perfect, flavor overall is very complex. Wonderful color. HopNotch is about as good as it gets on IPA's. Chinook hops deep flavor, piney, slight citrus, wonderful overall!"
""
"Overall, I will buy this again. Uinta doesn't have a lot of great beers, they just have good beers. This one, along with Dubhe, are among the best from Uinta, in my book. If you're into highly hopped beers with a fresh and smooth taste, then I recommend checking this out. Cheers!"
""
"The taste is just a very good IPA. It is smooth with just the perfect amount of bitterness. I wouldn't say that there is anything remarkable but it is great representative of what an IPA should be. If IPAs are your thing then you will enjoy this beer."
""
"Pours a clear golden with slight tint of orange and one finger of head that sticks around a bit. Mouth-watering hoppy smells of fresh-cut grass and piney woods with a hint of citrus and light malt. Intense flavors of dank, grassy hops that approaches an oniony or garlicy character, but falls just short of that. Sweet from the begining, but also very bitter the whole time, so it finally finishes somewhat dry after the long bitter finish. Great American IPA, just a great beer."
""
""
""
"Once I popped the cap, the aroma hit me and I knew it was going to be a good one. Mainly citrus with a herbal finish. Plenty of hop bite, but this ipa has also has a good malt backbone. The bitterness of the hops lingers at the end, making me want more."

"Single Bottle from the Fridge Lancaster, PA. Excellent hop fragrance on opening. Clear Orange Pour. A bit on heavy on the malt balance for my taste, but a very good IPA. Nice citrus flavor. ""Best by"" date 4-2013, but I bet a fresher bottle may improve the flavor. Would like to try again."
" The flavor is spicy and bitter from hops up front with nice citrus taste with subtle herbal quality and light malt sweetness with a piney finish and semi-sweet middle with a nice yeast creaminess with adds to the flavor and there is still enough malt to provide a nice bitterness that is not too sharp as it finishes. Overall a great, drinkable IPA, very hop forward as is eexpected and this is a good example of the style overall."

"O – Good IPA, very drinkable, and has a lot of good citrus notes in it. Not a game changer, but a nice drinker nonetheless."
""
"Nice golden with a solid quilt of fine creamy foam. Smells classic west coast: resin, weed, pine, grapefruit and BO. Nice nose. Flavor is up front bitter with a malty (crackers, biscuit and some sweet english crystals) backbone. There is a good resin bitterness with a spicy flavor and some good midpoint purple kush. Medium on nearly full bodied with fine, moderated carb and a watery finish. Nice beer. I probably won't go out of my way for this one, but would drink on tap locally, particularly with a good spicy meal or pizza."
"Pours a clear deep gold with a finger and a half of foam. High carbonation stems from all sides of the glass, great lacing and retention, ten minutes now and it's kept much of it's shape. Signature compass bottle work, a bit on the carbonated side but overall a great looking beer. Still very impressed with the retention and lacing. Was able to smell the hops as I cracked the cap, meaning good things are coming my way. When I really get my nose in there there's strong floral piney hops, a very pronounced malt presence, and a hint of alcohol. A bit malty and weak on the citrus, but still a good smelling beer. Taste is, as expected, strong hops with a solid malt backbone. More citrusy notes come through on the taste with a touch of alcohol. Feel is crisp and medium bodied. Very bitter and easy to drink. Overall pretty good. Give it a go if you're able"

"Drinkability- I thought it was very good. I really enjoyed it. I would definitely love to have it again."
""

"Wow. This goes down entirely too easy for 7.3%! This IPA is a pleasing golden orange/amber color with a thin, lacy head and a fair to substantial amount of effervesence. It's fragrance is the most appealing quality and really knocked out of the park a blend of sweet caramel notes and lemony citrus hops, in tandem with elements of pineapple. It's light bodied for an IPA and tastes of white grapefruit and spruce, and it's unfortunately not as bold (nor does it have a lingering viscosity) as I'd prefer. There's also an acidic quality that that detracts from the overall mouthfeel, but all in all, this is a quality west coast IPA."

"12oz. bottle served at 51 degrees in a nonic. Best before 4/26/13 indicated on the label. Pours a light copper hue with a translucent clarity and a fizzy, 1.5 inch off-white head. Head eventually settles into a thin, consistent, soapy skim with strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. The nose on this exudes fresh, aromatic hops - grapefruit, piney notes, tropical fruit and a suggestion of Simcoe (yep - I get a little cat pee). Taste is a bit less fruity than suggested by the nose, but there's still some grapefruit characteristics as well as a light, earthy bitterness towards the back. Finish comes off as slightly watery. All this on a balanced, malty backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation that falls just short of lively, a slightly oily texture and a light alcohol bite at the finish. Overall, a fairly well-balanced IPA with a well-hidden abv. Pretty decent IPA overall, but I anticipated a little bit more based on the nose."

"Medium body with tiny bubbles ever so present hitting the tip of the tongue. Taste is so smooth... Perfect amount of bitterness that doesn't overpower or dominate but knocks on the palate. Awesome with Persian food. Ghorme sabzi stew never tasted finer..."

"Overall I wish I had gotten the sixer. Super excited this is coming out in a can which is great for my fishing (non-bottle) excursions and easier packing. Not to mention freshness factor. Easy drinking and just plain good. Yet another Uinta beer that I enjoy."
"Not a bad IPA, nice level of pine and pepper spiciness. Not sure I'd ever seek this one out again but I'm glad I tried it."
""
"Overall: This one has my full attention. An interesting brew and simply outstanding American IPA. Highly recommend."
""
"A real stand out of the American IPA style. Even at the higher abv, I love drinking a few of these with some tacos of some Thai food. It is hoppy as excepted, but not too bitter. Very well balanced. I wish I could get growers of this beer as it is a waste for how many bottles I go through."

"Overall/Comments: Excellent example of the traditional American IPA focusing solely on the hops. Very good beer that I would rank just below Stone IPA(my IPA gold standard). Picked this up while in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bottled on 8/29/12. Consumed on 12/24/12."

"Tasty. Alcohol hidden. Not as hoppy and flavorful as the top IPAs but decent."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy orange straw with a tiny head, but it leaves nice lacing. Smells of floral notes with a little bit of grain, very inviting. Tastes of nice earthy and citrus notes, nice bite yet some balance. Beer is carbonated perfectly, finishes nice for its light body. Overall, a very good beer."

"O: A very tasty offering, from Utah nonetheless. Hoppy and flavorful, overall a good beer for anyone who enjoys hoppy beer."

"WELL DONE; GIVE THIS IPA A GO!"

"O- Not a bad IPA for the price. Did not disappoint but is not anything spectacular."
""
""
"Pours a dark golden orange with two-finger soapy head and lace patches on top of a piney, resiny hop aroma with bits of citric and grape and mild bready, caramel malt. A great balance of citric/grape fruity hop flavors along with some sweet malt from caramel and body filling ""Bread"" - finishes a tad sharp and strong and not a perfect balance, though. Sturdier and hoppier than most IPAs and an enjoyable brew that is easy to drink."
""
""
"My favorite beer distributor recommended this to me (LOVE IPA's DIPA's) calling it the pliny killer. Anyone looking for a good full bodied beer try this. Will not disappoint"

"O: I had heard good things about this brew on Beer Advocate. And, it's true. It's really good. Again, I compare it to DC Brau, but this gets higher scores because DC Brau is littered with off-putting sediment. This is so clean, crisp and beautiful. I recommend this to anyone."

"Pours golden amber with orange hues; two finger bright white fluffy head. Above average retention and quite a bit of splotchy lacing. Citrus blossoms, grapefruit, and a hint of pine on the nose. Grapefruit rind bitterness right off the bat, met by some lightly sweet caramel malt and pineapple. Finishes crisp and dry with the return of bitter citrus rind. Lighter side of medium bodied, well carbonated, smooth and silky mouthfeel. Solid and enjoyable IPA."
""
""
""
""
"A good though not exceptional IPA, on tap at Capone's Restaurant. Big IBU, fruity and orange taste. Spider lace. Decent drinkability, however some bleach in the finish. Decent drinkability despite imperfections because of the hop complexity. Middling for all the great IPAs out there."
""
""
"As others have said, this beer pours a light Orange. Nose is impressive with a nice hop character. Taste is where this IPA shines. Very nice balance between strong hop and malt. Among the top 10% of IPAa on the market. The balanced flavor continues with somewhat more malt as it fades. The alcohol come through at the very end."
"This is a decent IPA that lives up to it's namesake ""Hop Notch""."

"12 oz single from Roth’s Sunnyslope Market in Salem. $1.39 Pours a slightly darker burnt orange then usual, with a large rocky dirty white head, that fades fast and leaves large amounts of lace down the glass. Slightly resinous hop aromas, with a good doze of caramel from the malts. A nicely balanced IPA in taste. Sure the hops are there but they are equaled by a strong caramel malt. Nice strong mouthfeel to this one. Overall a nice IPA and very drinkable."
""
""
"I really liked this beer. The color is a light orange with a bone white head. The 1st smell had a nice citrus nose to it, but there was also a bit caramel as well. The bosy was meduim with a nice malty backbone to it. The bitterness was definatly there but it was not asstrigent. I tend to liek a bit of a sweeter IPA so this one worked for me. I would drink it again."

"O-a solid IPA with good flavor but not among the elite of the style"
""
""
"Amber/orange color, mildly cloudy. Frothy, two finger thick pale yellow head with nice retention. Wonderfully aromatic, can smell it at first pour. Fresh lemon zest, crushed hops, citrus and roasted malts. Sweet, nutty overall aroma. Sour hop blast with softer and sweeter tones of fermented citrus fruits and brown sugar on the first sip. Balances out well no overwhelming flavor; a simply solid, full bodied IPA. Creamy, malty and hoppy overall mouthfeel with a hoppy finish."
""
""
"O: I'm quite impressed with this offering from Uinta. It's extremely well balanced and very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and I could definitely session with this beer. I'm a hop fiend, and this satisfies while still having a nice malt profile. Well done!"
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall, it was a decent beer but not an outstanding one of the style. The hops were pretty decent, but they felt overshadowed at times by the sweet maltiness. Not bad at all, but it didn't stand out to me in a competitive style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew doesn't follow. I saw the lable and immediately recalled fond memories. But then worried my memory exceeded potential. It didn't. This IPA's hop blend beats almost any other. Try it if you can find it. If you appreciate hops you'll love it!"
""
""
"A nice IPA that I imagine I’ll be going back to."

"O: a satisfying, well-crafted, citrusy IPA. Has a higher ABV than usual which is well-hidden in the taste and nose, but mars the mouthfeel."
"O: A nice IPA that stands firmly in the crowded room of IPAs. Nothing special, but worth a try"
""
"overall: With all the great IPA's, hard to rise above. This one does a bit though doesn't hit elite."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite beers to date. I had to knock a couple of points off because it's not as perfect as other IPA's I've had (from Stone), but it comes damn close. In particular, it'd be nice if there was more smell/taste from the malt/alcohol. I can only hope Uinta makes a special bomber edition at some point in the near future."
"O- Decent beer, nothing I'd go out of my way for but nothing I'd turn down either. A little different than what I was expecting but nothing that really stands out either. The 7.3% ABV makes it an easy drinker though."
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew for an ipa. It is overall a pretty decent brew but not something I would go out of my way for or continually purchase time after time. I am appreciative of the chance to try it and if given the opportunity to have a fresher bottle, I wouldn't hesitate."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Medium body and carbonation. Finish is dry and carries a nice hops bitterness. Excellent balance. Real solid IPA here fellas."
""
"Overall this is a decent beer. Again not as citrusy as i like, but a good balance of bitterness and sweetness."
"I was really excited to pick this one up, and it did not disappoint. 12oz bottle, pours a hazy golden copper, with a frothy ivory head, decent retention and lacing. Huge citrus nose, grapefruit rind, biscuity malt,pine. Tastes are fresh wet sticky resiny hop, grapefuit rind, pine, lingering oily bitterness. Mouth-feel is sticky and resiny, dry. Loved it!"
"Herbal hop bitterness and toasted malts up front. Hop bitterness becomes citrusier and spicy. Cookie, caramel, and biscuit malt sweetness fills out the palate. Pitchy, sappy bitterness into the finish. Lingering fruity sweetness and piny, resinous hops. Medium bodied, with a creamy feel. Very nicely done. The best IPA brewed in Utah? Maybe."
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a very nice IPA, but it seemed very one-dimensional. There wasn't much complexity in the hop flavors or smell. The appearance isn't all that great, even if I discount the sediment (because it is likely intentional). I would drink it again, but I wouldn't recommend it compared to the vast ocean of AIPA/IPA/IIPA's available."
""
""
""
"Lightly spicy bitterness, herbal and dry in the finish. Fairly malty, medium bodied with a bready heft to it. PIne and resiny herbals dominate the flavor. Moderate bitterness. A serviceable IPA but not all that memorable."
""
"music: minus the bear - infinity overhead"
""
"There is a heavier amber color to this one than I would have expected for the style. Nose seems almost non-existent. Very faint tones of earthy hops. Flavor profile is quite earthy. Much more than I was hoping for, if I am going to be honest. The beer is still pretty solid though. Heavy malt base with a well managed hop influence on top of it giving it a fairly thick body. It's a good beer, but not really my cup of tea...err...beer, for an IPA."
"O: This was really good IPA. Pretty hoppy at 82 IBUs but so smooth and drinkable. I usually prefer a little bit more dry hopping for smell, but the taste is what really counts. Tastewise, I really enjoyed everything about it. The hoppiness and fruit flavors were on point, but I was truly impressed by the malts in this one. It really feels like this beer is made in small batches with the freshest ingredients. I would definitely go out of my way to get this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A pretty nice IPA with a good balance between breadiness, sweetness, and hop. Well worth a try."
""
"Good beer from....UTAH!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is an excellent ipa -- do not over look, it holds its' own with Union Jack and Torpedo and others...."
"O: There is more hops flavor in this beer than almost any beer I've had; it would have been a thing of beauty and wonder if there had been more hops varieties than being so focused on the citrus hops. This is still a solid effort and I will look for other beers from Unita."
""
""
"D - Really enjoy this beer. The hop character with the malts really come together for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall all an enjoyable IPA extra credit for the easy to find and read born on date."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a complex hop profile that's slightly hindered by a prominent malt backbone. Nice balance of earthy and sweet notes with dry, piny bitterness giving way to tropical and citrus fruit flavor. Hints of grass, soil and pine needle countered by pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel. Underneath, there is a strong malt backbone with hints of caramel, toffee and biscuit. The hop profile is pretty nice but the strong malt presence overpowers it a bit too much for my liking."
"D: kind of struggling with this one, I'm not impressed. Kind of a bready malt bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at D's II. Nice orangish color with decent head that is white as clouds. Lacing sticky throughout!! Smells of hoppy goodness but has something missing. Crispy hops ride in early but slightly watery and lack of malt maybe? But could pound these and at 7% could get dangerous. I like a better mouth pop from ipa. Good but not great , easy going ipa!"
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, nice and mellow pine like hops. In the taste, pine hops with just a note of orange citrus hops, however a bit watery. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine and a small orange citrus hop in the aftertaste. Nice hops, mellow but good, a bit watery and thin, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"With such an high abv I suspected a lot of sugar went into it but the malts are subdued and truly balance the hops which I would consider to be mild given the eponymous prominence of the flower. I could drink a lot of these until I was too drunk to drink more; this I could say about many beers but it's the first one that counts the most and this is a beer I would gladly let take my sobriety."
""
""
"OVERALL: A great session IPA for the warmer months. Very refreshing, well balanced, flavorful brew. Well made, and a six pack is well worth the purchase. Bottled on 7-24, nice and fresh indeed."
"The mouthfeel is what gets me. It has a nice medium body approprite for the style, but the ending leaves a sticky impression."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA. Thank you for landing in PA."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light-medium nice carbonation, and again the alcohol bite makes me like it a little less. Overall, I probably enjoyed this a bit more than I was expecting. I really enjoyed the dank hop and mango/pineapple notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Reminds me quite a bit of Bell's Two-hearted Ale. Hop Notch has about the same ABV and has maybe a little more bitter hop taste. Less balanced, but good. I'd prefer Two-hearted. Hop Notch is almost as good for almost the same price."
""
""
""
"Overall I would get this again if I could find a sixer. A pretty stellar IPA."
""
"O - I really like this one for around $9/sixer. The beer is highly drinkable and well worth picking up if you have yet to enjoy it. It may not be as top-class as some of the more refined brews, but if you are looking for some quality hops at a fair price, look no further."
""
""
"Overall a decent IPA, but not one that I would eagerly seek out again. In some respects, it tastes more like an American pale ale rather than an IPA. I wish I could've had this when it was brand spanking new, to see if the two and one-half months of age had any impact upon its taste."
"Taste- YUMMY! light bodied, full of flavor, smooth clean finish. It has pine and lemony taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done Utah. I'm impressed. Did I mention grea value too.???"
"Jeff, you might want to check this one out at the magical gas station."

""
""
"overall this is a decent ipa.. i really liked the black ipa much more than this one, but as far as ipa's go this is pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: A super-clean IPA that is only limited in its approachability by high abv for style and aromatic hop qualities that are far outdistanced by bitterness. Malt qualities are superior to most, meaning that it tastes good but stays out of the way. Unfortunately in this case it just leaves more space for the potent dry-hopped qualities that just aren't there."
""
""
"Poured a glowing copper with a creamy off white head and exquisite lacing as I drank. Smell was a citrusy hoppiness, taste expanded to the citrus profile lemon essence and other complexities. Mouthfeel was smooth and a bit oily-surprisingly refreshing considering the abv. Overall very enjoyable and a great addition to my meal."
""
""
""
""
"O-this is a very tasty and hearty IPA. It has the sort of flavor that makes me want to buy a case of it for casual drinking situations. I recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"i usually prefer the crooked line from uinta, but the hop notch was not a bad brew. decent light amber color, respectable carbonation. the hop aromas leaned toward the earthy side, with elements of stone fruit (apricot, nectarine) poking around as well. malts come through without being sweet. i personally prefer more bitterness in this style, but it was not as if this ale finished sticky or sweet. felt lighter than the 7.3%, and i could see myself drinking these faster than most beers over 7%."
""
"Amber yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap that left lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Tart pineapple and sweet peach aromas with a sweet maltiness beneath. Smooth, delicate feel with rich carbonation that is suppressed nicely by the malty feel. Citrus hop flavors up front into the middle that gives way to pine hop bitterness from the middle to the end supported by a sweet malty backbone. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness. Nice balance of citrus and pine hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very well balanced IPA that is easy to drink and delivers a good amount of hop aromas and flavors without being overpowering. This isn’t nearly as bitter compared to other IPAs that have a similar hop profile."
"A well made IPA that I recommend."
"Poured from my home tap with a a bright yellow-orange color and a thick, foamy head, this beer has an aroma of light citrus and woodsy hops combined with a likewise light bready malt character. The flavor is more pronounced, with a bitingly bitter combination of dull grapefruit rind and grass, although there is also a mild malty presence to provide some semblance of balance. The mouthfeel is resinous and substantial, enhancing the bold, bitter flavor. Overall, this is a solid, bright IPA that impresses but doesn't stand out."
"O- Very impressive IPA, definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a surprisingly good IPA from a brewery that doesn't particularly stand out."
""
"12 oz bottle dated 5/12 poured into Weyerbacher Snifter glass. Appearance is copper with 1/2 inch head and good amount of lacing. Can't wait to try this one. Smell is citrusy grapefruit. Love the smell. Taste is smooth. Not as hop forward as I thought it was going to be from the smell. Pretty nicely balanced. The hoppier the better for me usually but this is a nice balanced easy drinking brew from Uinta. First beer ever from Utah and I am very pleased with it. High quality for a lower price. A beautiful thing. I will definitely be enjoying more of these...."
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, slightly pale copper-brown coloring with a foamy, light, frothy, off-white head. Aromas of wet, resiny, citrus hops with a subtle toffee backbone. Flavors are hop forward and rich, with a clinging resin and bitter character. Toffee backbone remains light, but strong enough to balance the strong hops profile. Very well blended and smooth, the beer has a slightly bitter, resiny aftertaste. Solid body, with a layered lacing on the glass as you drink. The finish is smooth and clean, with a touch of bitterness to give a slight drying feel. Very solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice IPA. Not the best, but damn tasty and refreshing. Really hits the grapefruit notes but still maintains a nice malt backbone."
""
"O: Very nice beer. A solid American style IPA. Well done Uinta. A victory for Utah brewing, I must say."
""
""
""
"O- scarily close to Two Hearted. Two Hearted is just smidge more refined, but this is really, really close. Good stuff."
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable, good-looking, drinkable beer. Stronger than a session beer, but I could easily throw down a bunch of these in a sesh (whilst getting quite drunk). A great example of a well-balanced, American IPA. Not outstanding, but definitely above average."
""
"Worth a test drive."
""
""
""
"O: An extremely well done IPA. Absolutely delicious."
"Overall, this is very good IPA, but hindered somewhat by the mere strength of the hop flavors, which do tend to dominate the flavor profile, and prove strong enough that in subsequent sips some of the sugary malt flavors are lost altogether, leaving only grapefruit rind and pine resin on the tongue. For hopheads, this will be a sure treat, but a greater sugar content would have balanced the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, so the truth is that I've been puttin back homebrew most of the night and my tastes buds are a little worn out. I can conceive a great hop profile built within the proper malt structure and the lacing shows me that proper brewing techniques were employed along with the freshest ingredients to craft an exceptional ale There Black IPA was money as well so you know these guys are doing it right. Grab something from Uinta, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice representation of the style. Crisp and refreshing and overall enjoyable."
""
"The body was a golden/orange color body with a small head on it. The smell was nice of pine and a hint of citrus. The taste was nice strong of bitter hops and pine flavor on the back of the tongue. Very nice mouth feel and overall a really good hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hazy amber body, and the relatively small, but durable, head gave this beer an attractive look. The smell was mostly citric hops with some overtones of hay. The taste had a crisp bitterness from the generous levels of hops, and the malt was biscuit like and light. The finish was citric and slightly spicy. If there was anything to dislike about this beer, it was the slightly metallic aftertaste. The body was medium thick,and allowed the hops to coat the tongue. This was well put together IPA for me."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good ipa, i usually lean towards more citrusy stuff, but this is a nice changeup. Grew on me very much throughout the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a rather clear marigold/goldenrod orange, muted hops but a hidden peanut butter & floral scent brings forward a bit of an iron/metallic taste with the taste. Otherwise it's pretty forward on the malts with a hop bitterness and not much else. Maybe it's because it's a couple of months old, but I'm not that hardcore about getting my ipa's straight off the bottling line. My sense is moreso that it's an ok ipa anyway; a rather straightforward summer thirst quencher. Still, i'm always a fan of trying something new, and Uinta isn't something I regularly get around here as it is."
"D: not bad, just nothing great. this style seems to be having more and more outstanding examples, so i really need to be wowed. just not the case here."
""
""
""
"O: When did Bell's move to Utah?"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"pours a golden amber, lively bubbles, off white head. The noses is grassy is and herbal with a decent caramel malt backbone. The flavor has some oily hop resign flavors, notes of meaty orange citrus, with a grassy herbal spice in the finish. The body is a touch syrupy but has an aggressive carbonation to balance out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, light, and refreshing with a dry finish."
"Nice a fruity and the malts add balance and flavor, this is a well executed beer that is very drinkable. Overall a very enjoyable beer that I will seek out again and recommend trying."

"O: Fantastic IPA, very fresh sample and an overall very tasty brew. What surprised me the most was how drinkable this was. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It was just okay. I was a bit let down by this one. Didnt have a vibrance or a flavor to make you say wow. Overly thick IMO and just unbalanced."
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice example of a IPA. It has a unique flavor like biting into a bitter orange creamsicle sprinkled with hop buds and nuts on a pine wood tongue depressor. I enjoyed it and will have it again."
""
"I'd probably buy it again, would love to have it on tap!"
""
"Pours a dull, clear golden color with an eggshell colored head. Head retention is excellent. A battle of pine and citrus in the bouquet. Grapefruit breaks throuh late. A nearly perfect mouthfeel that makes this IPA so very drinkable. Sweet grapefruit and a note of tangerine in the impressive flavor. Excellent IPA. Well done, Salt Lake City!"
"This is a great IPA, well balanced and full of flavor and aroma. Absolutely delicious."

"Overall a nice IPA, just wish is tasted more like it smells"
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good “west coast IPA” here; not as robust as I was expecting given the abv of 7.3%, but good nonetheless; perhaps a little too dry and resinous to be refreshing or a “lawnmower IPA” but good stuff."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this IPA. Nothing that I've never tasted before but very solid nonetheless. At the price tag, I will def buy this again."
"For some (great) reason I would love to enjoy this with a blue cheese, and fig spread."
""
""
""
"O: Very solid IPA, but beware that it behooves you to drink it fresh. I got this for a solid price ($9/6 pk.), but I don't know if this would be a go to IPA for me. Still pretty damn good regardless."
""
""
"O: Interesting brew, not your run of the mill IPA. Lot of flavors intertwined here, not one huge flavor dominating. I'm guessing a complex hop bill outside the usual C's. A few flavor notes I wasn't crazy about, but I would still recommend trying this at least once as its certainly unique."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely my kind of IPA. Lots of flavour and a great scent and appearance. My bottle was only a few weeks old and the flavours really popped. I saw it at stores for 6.99 for a 6 pack - seems like great value."
"O- Again and again I'm impressed by this brewery. I feel like Hop Notch is nothing over the top but by far one of my favorites to pick up a six pack of and I'm always glad to see it on a tap line."
"Overall: Solid IPA with few distinguishing qualities."
"Nice work UT! Slightly all over the place, I'd like to see more depth and character in this brew, but it's definitely one I wouldn't shy away from."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"An above average IPA. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one and would enjoy it again in the future."
"Pours an amber tinted copper with a big foamy white head that sticks around for a bit. Decent retention. Very hoppy aroma. Huge aroma of orange rind, hits you immediately as you open up the bottle and doesn't leave. Kind of one dimensional though. Initial sweet orange hits the tonge, this transitions into a more bitter orange rind middle, the bitterness builds and continues into the finish as it gets a little more earthy. Some of the sweet orange re-introduces itself in the finish. Medium body, sillky mouthfeel. Maybe a touch too bitter for my personal tastes but a fine IPA."
"one of the better india pales ive had in awhile. pours a reddish amber orangey color with a tall whte thick frothy head. smells resiny hops and red malts. flavor is very very citrusy. grapefruit, lemon peel, and piney hops. this is so complex and balanced. very refreshing for spring/early summer wearther, and a nice sturdy abv rounds out a very complete beer, and certainly the best ive had from uinta. feel is nice, medium to fuller bodied but very drinkable. i will be buying this one again"

"Mostly clean orange-amber color with a solid, sticky covering. Green, candy-like hops in the nose...lots of juicy citrus astringency, pineapple, and some faint grassiness. Juicy, oily hop flavor. Grapefruit and orange with some trailing pine in the back and a tropical flair. Something unfortunately comes across as metallic tasting, but I don't recall that in previous experiences. Medium bodied and appropriately bitter. Though the slight metallic notes knock it down a notch, this is this quite the tasty IPA."

"O - I picked this one up as a single at the recommendation of the guy at Downtown Wine in Harrisonburg. I was happy to find a seldom seen Utah Brewery with an IPA less than two weeks old. This was very good with the strong point probably being the nose. Good balanced flavor and goes down very easily for a 7.3% ABV. The bottle and label are also cool and they claim it is brewed with wind and solar renewable power. Definitely a beer worth trying if you come across a fresh one."
"Definitely worth a try if you enjoy a good IPA."

"O - Very nice IPA with fleshy grapefruit hops throughout the profile. Stays bitter through the finish."
"Overall, i cant recommend this IPA. I bought my last 6pk."
""
"O - An extremely good IPA. Strong, drinkable, tasty, and $7.99 a 6 pack. It doesn't get any better than this for the price."
"At least it doesn't have a bad flavor - just very little flavor."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber color with a finger of white head. Good hoppy aroma of dry pine, tangerine and yellow grapefruit peel. Biscuity malt on the back end. Flavor follows the nose with some light resin and a lingering hop flavor. Light body with average carbonation. Prickly mouthfeel. Overall a super solid IPA with a superb drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent IPA but the bitterness is a little too much considering the lack of underlying hop flavors. OK."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a small white head that receded mostly and left a bit of soapy lacing behind. I didn't get too much in the aroma, biscuity malts and a good mix of hops profiles. Not too flavorful either, I must say, light malts, crisp floral hops with some lemony pith coming through. A little bland overall, but that aside, this was definitely an easy drinker, and quite smooth going down. Pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent all around. I can't get over the vitamin thing on the nose, but other than that, there's a nice balance and some solid potential to knock a few back without fatigue. Great profile in the long run."

"DOA"

"Sweet and spicy on the front, with a wet, refreshing finish. The hops are nicely balanced out, and really just pleasing to the palate. Goes down smooth and easy, showcasing pine flavors without launching an assault on the tastebuds. The alcohol is well hidden. Plus, this IPA doesn't make use of the abundant, prickly carbonation that a lot of others tend to have. Smooth and delicious. Maybe a little bit too drinkable..."
"You'll like this one."
"O: i had hoped that the taste would be more in line with the scent, the bitter note was more extreme than i like to see in IPA's, i know this sounds way out of wack but this wasnt just a bitter note, it was like an all encompassing bitter flavor which just over powered the floral hop notes that hit in the middle, there are better beers out there IMO"
"Overall: A little more alcohol than needed or desired. While not great it's decent enough, it's an IPA that just holds it own in the vast sea of IPA's out there these days."
"A solid IPA, not much else to say."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Bottle dated 1/11/12. Very nice golden orange color with great head retention and lacing. It is quite clear with very little cloudiness. The smell is really interesting. Not as much citrus on the nose as I expected, although it is there, but accompanied by some vegetal notes, some herbal character, pineapple, and a subtle onion and garlic quality. The taste is more straightforward than the nose, but also has some complexity to it. A good amount of tropical fruit flavors balanced by some soft malt flavors a touch of pine and a mild medium bitterness. This was my first time trying this and I am glad I bought a six pack rather than a single bottle. Great IPA that is new to me."
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. A nice drinking, citrusy IPA - maybe not anything mindblowing but something I'd try again."
""
""
"Towards the end it takes on a little more bitterness, making the ibu count make more sense, but its always enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"This is a good IPA - clearly, I'm having trouble saying anything more specific about it. I enjoyed this single, but I don't think I'd buy a six-pack."
""
""
"A good, strong affordable bitter IPA that won't wreck your wallet. It walks a fine line between West Coast and East Coast IPA and DIPA. I respect this beer even if it doesn't unseat Torpedo IPA as my favorite in the category."
"I liked the initial full-on fresh power of the hops in this IPA but things ultimately finished a little too harshly for me to call this anything other than average to good. The aroma and overall feel are definitely high points of this though. I’d still say that it’s maybe worth checking out a single bottle of it before committing to a six-pack."
""
"O - Overall a very wonderful IPA. This would definitely rank somewhere in the middle/end of my top 10 IPA's."
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, it is fine on the palate, a little bitter on the finish and a little dry. Malt backbone is subdued, it is fine but nothing special about this beer."
""
""
"O: A very solid IPA right in that $10/6-pack arena which is good to see. This one was exactly one month old when I had it so I had it pretty fresh. Good beer, another nice IPA in the Southland at a great price."
"Definitely not loving this one - reminds me too much of an East Coast IPA - too sweet and malty. The hop is oily and in the mix, but just doesn't make its presence known like some of the better IPA's out there - too much sweet malt and crackery/bready yeast."
"A pretty good beer overall. I can’t get over how balanced this beer was."

"Bottle dated 1/11/12 poured to pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a 1 finger white head, some retention and some lacing. The nose is a pleasant mix of fruity character: lemon, grapefruit, pineapple, and floral hop tones. A hint of toasted malt on the back end. No alcohol detected. Again, the flavor starts with a strong fruity character with the floral pineapple, grapefruit, and almost tangerine type flavor. A bit of earthy hops. Medium bitterness. Malty sweet. Finishes with a lingering sweetness and nice hoppy flavor. Medium bodied and though hop-forward it was nicely balanced. Medium carbonation. Finishes crisp and tasty. Overall, I really appreciated this beer. As it warmed the flavors and aroma seemed enhanced. I would happily buy this again. Hides the alcohol well and is quite easy to drink."
""
"O - a fine example of the style."
""
"This is good enough, but I can't honestly say that it stands out from scores of other IPAs I've had. Definitely wouldn't turn down another one, but it's pretty forgettable, in my opinion."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 1/11/12. Pours a clear bright orange red, with a sticky one inch white head, tons of lace. Smell is tangerine, pine, grass, and grapefruit. Taste starts with sweet citrus and finishes with a burst of grapefruit. For a standard IPA it is a big body, a nice amount of life, not dry, and very drinkable. Thanks to my friend for noticing this yesterday, excellent beer."
"O: B+ beer for sure. Great sessionsable IPA. I can't believe tha the ABV is higher then 6% n this one. Very smooth."
""
""
""
"Overall a drinkable IPA, but nothing to get real excited about."

"Final thought - at 7.3% abv, don't drink to many, to fast! The single bottle price of $1.50 is nice as well!"
"This is a solid IPA. The malt character is present and forward. The hops are smooth and balanced. It's very enjoyable and very drinkable."
""
"This is a good East Coast IPA. Moderately floral Centennial hop flavors coupled with citrus and tropical fruit with a dash of pine resin thrown in, there's quite a a bit of hop flavor with a pleasant level of bitterness thrown in. Some sugar, maybe a little too simple and a little too much, with a little bread. A pleasing citrus rind bitterness and resin character is present on the finish, coating the palate and reducing the sweetness. Moderately peachy as well, especially as I keep drinking it, and as it warms up. While decent, the sweetness does get to be a bit much after a while. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this is quite pleasant on the palate with great flavors, but unfortunately, it's not quite my kind of IPA. I can't see drinking 2 or more bottles in a sitting, but it's still one I will pick up when I see it fresh, and after I've drunk down my cellar some. Recommended."
"O - Very good IPA. Enjoyable drink . I would be happy to have another."

"Overall: Another good Rocky Mountain area beer. Those guys in Utah love their snow and love their beer. So happy to get beers from out there here in MA. This is an IPA I could see myself enjoying from time to time. Crazy to think that this beer was also only bottled on 1/11/12."
""
"Overall: I really like this one, especially because it's not too citrusy. It's assertively bitter and green."
""
"Beautiful hop profile, but not as balanced and sweet as Two-Hearted. Only one step below it."
""
""
"Impressive! I’ve been hearing nothing but good things and after missing out on a batch of bottles at the store, I HAD to snag a growler before it disappeared and I’m glad I did. Very juicy IPA, incredibly drinkable and one I will definitely buy again in the future!"

"O- A good IPA that showcases a sweeter hoppy profile without being malt heavy. Very easy to drink, making having a few quite enjoyable. Not a bold IPA by any means."
"The beer pours a clear golden orange with a white head. A really weird aroma. Quite floral with a little bit of grass and pine. Slightly sweet malt aroma, mostly bread. The flavor is moderately sweet without a ton of hop flavor either. It's mostly grass and line with a touch of floral hops and citrus peel. Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation."
"Overall this is a very very good ipa."
"Pours a clear amber with a 1 inch beige head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Thin wispy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit, citrus zest, and some earthy herbal hops. A bit of an alcohol kick in the nose as well. Taste is of citrus zest, bitter grapefruit, herbal hops, with a subtle malt backbone. There is an assertive hop bitterness that sits on top of the tongue after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA but the bitterness is pretty harsh on this one in my opinion."
"A solid, serviceable IPA from Uinta. I guess I was expecting more of the typical hop character from this, especially out of a growler. Nonetheless, an enjoyable brew."
"Overall it was a very nice beer. Good hoppy flavor and finish. Mild sweetness. Still very drinkable and refreshing."
""
"O: While I do like this as a refreshing drinker, would like to see more hop flavor and bitterness on this one. Its still good...maybe I expected too much from this fresh bottle."

"Overall, very nice IPA , hop freshness, clean malt flavors, good stuff from uinta"
"Overall a really great surprise. I never expected this but it's really good. Definitely getting this one again."
""
"O - This was a pleasant surprise...very nice IPA. I've found some of the Uinta offerings, especially their IPA's and hoppier styles to be a bit too malty for my tastes and I was kinda expecting more of the same here, but this really breaks that mold. Nice hop flavors, adequate bitterness and malt that is present but kept in check. Definitely give this one a shot if you can find it."
""
"The is a pretty good IPA. The taste is a bit more muted than the nose and the hops don't really have a bite to them but the flavors and aromas are pleasant nonetheless."
"Overall, a solid IPA that I will certainly return to. Also feel the need to reissue the compliment to Uinta on freshness (dating and shipping); bottled and into my stomach in less than a week, certainly an impressive feat for a brewery in another state."

"Taste is deep in fresh hops. Mild hop bite but great hop characteristic...bitter and flavorful. There is a very big citrus aftertaste but it works well with this brew. Its a well balanced and refreshing ipa. Really good. I would not hesitte to buy this again."
"Very nice, crisp, vegetable taste to it. There's an aftertaste that is citrsy. Sweetish. This is nice and refreshing. A mild floralness to it."
"Overall - Initially the flavor disappointed me, but I came to appreciate its unified flavor profile. Nice hop character without being overpowering, but in terms of bitterness is more ""east coast"" than ""west coast"". In the spirit of Heavy Seas Loose Cannon or Bell's Two Hearted Ale - hoppy but not a tongue coating IBU bomb."
""

"I really enjoyed Uinta's Hop Notch IPA. It had a nice citrus and pine scent up front with floral notes. I thought it was reminiscent of one of my all-time favorites Maiden the Shade. At 7.3% ABV I was surprised by the smooth drinkability and that it didn't smack you in the face with alcohol. All in all a really balanced drinkable IPA that is smooth enough for the folks out there that aren't complete hop heads."
"Overall a nice American IPA, one I'd definitely buy again. Pretty sure this is the first beer from Utah I've ever had... looking forward to trying other styles from Uinta."

"Sort of thinnish head, around a finger’s worth of just off-white foam, moderately tight weave helps retention until there’s just a few islands left, the lacing is wispy but sticks alright. Exquisitely clear copper orange colored liquid, glistens in the glass, virtually no bubbles visible though. Playfully scented nose of hothouse flowers, pine sap, pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus and an erect spine of herbal hops and pepper, the apricot, peach, pineapple fruit more muted, in the end more sweet than bitter but not lacking in the latter, quietly worms its way into your nostrils like it owns the deed. Medium-bodied, places the bitterness and leafy hoppiness upfront for an initial puckering effect, then allows the general creamy mouth texture to take over, orange pekoe tea, licorice, pine, sourdough bread segue to fuller pineapple, mango, peach, apricot fruit. Pink and white grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange, citrus soup in your mouth. Carbonation has a keen prickle to it but neither broad nor especially long lived. Very clean finish, refreshing and tingly. Could drink a lot of these ice cold."

"Overall this is a great, drinkable, hoppy IPA. Among easily obtained IPAs, i'd put this one below only 2hearted. Good price point as well....seek this one out."
""
"overall - great hop profile, the hops shine in this one as they should, excellent ipa"
"Uinta Hop Knotch IPA: This Uinta offering is a hazy caramel in color with well developed head that makes it to the finish line. Good aroma of fruity hops. The flavor has the flowery hops shining through the malt sweetness, but the finish is a bit rough. This is a good middle of the road IPA."
"Really drinkable and tasty. Among the better IPAs I've had this year."
"Overall, a pretty solid IPA. A little more sweet fruit and less char in the flavor to better balance it and a little more body and this would be excellent."
"A traditional American IPA, with lots of bitterness that is reminiscent of chile peppers. Very light malt. The body is good with an appropriate level of carbonation."
"The taste doesn't disappoint either, with late breaking pine following a broad, balanced opening sip. Texture and aftertaste match the flavor well. This isn't your typical hop bomb, but is worth trying f ou even a moderate hop head. I find this complex but still easy to drink. Don't even mention the seven and a half percent that makes it almost a DIPA. Extremely impressive stuff from these Salt lake City brewers."
"Fruity and flavorful. Hopped up and moderatly bitter on the back end AIPA. Easy to drink and enjoy every sip of this one."
""
"O - Really nice IPA. I am very happy to have a pretty 'big' IPA that is still pretty balanced. I'd recommend to anyone."
"Bottled 11/17/11 The aroma is just a bomb of nectarine/peachy, citrusy, piney, floral goodness. Appearance is golden. Absolutely outstanding. Taste is very similar. soft pillowy notes of peaches and citrus, with slight pine. Overall this beer is a wonderful surprise and should hold me over for nugget nectar. I'd actually call this a nugget nectar substitute."
""
"O: I could drink this all day! Very refreshing! At 2 weeks old, this is amazing. Uinta beers continue to impress."
"This beer poured out as a copper color with a nice looking white creamy head on top. The smell of the beer was hoppy, it had plenty of floral citrus notes on the nose. The taste of the beer was full of bitter flavors from the hops used in this brew. The aftertaste had a light caramel flavor to it. The mouthfeel was clean and sharp feeling. Overall this beer was a good ipa, I would probably drink this one again I I came across it."
"The price is right on this beer. A little high in abv at 7.3% for my tastes (should be called a dipa imo) but it's a good, no great beer for $1.50 beer. A definite go-to for those cold nights. I've had much worse IPAs for double the price. Cudos to Unita."

"Really glad I picked this up and will seek out another 6."
"O - A very solid IPA from Uintas, the more of their beers I try, the more impressed I become. IPA fans, definitely seek this one out. Fist pump to the state for finally loosening their conservative alcohol laws which give brewers like Uintas an opportunity to really shine and prove their brewing ability."
"Bottled on 11/16/11.Poured into a standard pint a clear burnt orange with a tight formed 1/2 finger white head atop that settled into a soapy-like mass.Grapefruit aromas along with a bit of fresh cut grass show nice hop complexity,Amarillo-like sharp hop flavors like grapefruit and aspirin (wich I like),along with ha big shot of green herbalness,a caramel malt base does show thru a little.This a damn fine IPA,I admit Iam a little surprised at how well of a job Uinta did here."
"Damn. I hope this beer gets some love. This brings a great West Coast IPA flavor to the table. A nice hop bomb with a good pine and citrus feel. Gotta give this the surprise A, it is really flavored nicely and came out of nowhere. I hope it doesn't rot on the shelves and has a nice rotated production."
"WOW! This is an almost perfect IPA, color is slightly opaque with a one finger head. Smell is very resonant pine and floral. The taste is citrus mixed with pine and backed with a sweet malt background so as not to kill the tongue with bitterness. Mouthfeel is only described by one word, fresh. The alcohol doesn't really come off as hard as it should at 7%. This beer is truly deluxe, i'm keeping this one on hand perpetually for friends and family to try, DEF case worthy!"
""
"The aroma was classic hop bomb of an IPA from the first whiff. No, mention of the alcohol what so ever in this one from the aroma through. Lots of fresh citrus hop aromas coming right at you with a delicate balance of bitterness and a touch of sugar as well. Definitely some light sweet notes coming through on it, especially as it warmed up a touch. Very nice feel here, with a rich medium body that was full of carbonation, offering you a very nice creamy feel as it went down,"
""
"O - Love this IPA. Great one to always keep in the fridge."
""
""
"Overall- I will be buying this again. Good, easy drinking IPA. Solid. 4.5/5"
"D- Overall, this beer disappears way too quickly. So thirst quenching, and just the right balance of hops and malt. I would love to try this fresh, as it has been in bottles for nearly two months at this point. This being the first time I've tried it, it tastes fresh though. I've had a lot of wet hop beers lately, and this one has a similar quality to it."

"Pours a very nice slightly hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy off-white head, with a nice big oil slick in the middle of the glass, and some nice sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, a nice touch of citrus and pine notes. The taste is very nice, hoppy, nice blend of malts, with some citrus/pine notes. Medium Body, very nice bitter/dry finsh. This is a very tasty American IPA, goes down pretty nicely. Job well done Uinta!"
"O - A good overall IPA, nothing special. Decent hop flavor, but not as bold as I would prefer. I might give this one a 2nd chance, but if I don't oh well..."
"Good crisp clean moutfeel. Not a complex brew, but nails its flavors a good solid ipa I would recommend anytime. Very tasty beverage."
"Overall not bad, typical east coast style IPA mostly, malty and hop balance, long bitter spicy hop finish, nice hops overall on the flavor but nothing special, but the nose lacks a bit as well. Although it could have been a bit better."
"Overall - I look forward to having this again. It's nice to find a Diamond in the rough every once in a while."
"all 4's"
"O - This is a nice IPA. Would like to try it fresher maybe, as its a bit too malt heavy for my liking."
"D - Very drinkable. I could session with this even though it's toward the upper register for sessioners. Really nice beer. Clean, crisp. Well done, Unita."
"Overall: I'm somewhat conflicted. I started off thinking that I didn't much care for this one. As I drank a couple, it grew on me and I started picking up on some subtleties that I didn't notice at first. This is a well developed beer."
"O/D-This one is pretty damn good. A perfect 6-pack IPA. Love the flavor profile. The intensity of the hops sneak up on you in a good way. Not very familiar with Uinta, but this is a pretty good start. Definitely one of the better IPAs that come in a six-pack in my area."
"I am very impressed by this beer. The flavors just seem to slowly build and get nice and big without overpowering everything or fighting with each other. Great beer!"
"Overall: The only thing this IPA is lacking is balance. Other than that, it is nice, hoppy, refreshing and, if I'm not careful, I could move through a couple of these very quickly. Reminds me of DFH 60 Minute IPA."
"its good, but not great. with the plethora of real ""top notch"" IPAs available, this one falls to second tier."
"Overall: I really liked this one a lot. Now I need to decide which of the local IPAs I like best. This one is right up there. I am not sure noobs would be enjoy this amount of bitterness"
"Hoppy and tasty, this really is a ""top notch"" IPA. Nice big dose of bitter, almost resinous, grapefruit hops. High in alpha acids and the bitterness lingers throughout the taste. Touch of alcohol in the finish, but doesn't distract from some really nice fruity and hoppy flavors. Orange is definitely in the front briefly, only to be dismantled by the onslaught of resiny grapefruit hops. It makes a small comeback on the backside of the taste, just enough to balance everything out. A decent little bready malt bill works its way into the balance as well. Manages to be just as hoppy as a DIPA, but doesn't ever cross the line in its extremeness, making this a very drinkable brew. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and moderately carbonated, almost creamy with a craveable lingering bitterness. If you need an alpha acid fix but don't want to be completely floored by a higher ABV DIPA, this one is your beer. Very enjoyable, and my first from Uinta. Not the last either."
"12ox bottle from a six pack that cost me $7.99. Clear orange color, creamy head, good lacing. Smells like caramel and orange rind, not bad at all. Flavor is hoppy, citrus orange rind but has a pretty good malt backing to it. Overall, not bad and a good value but I am s biased towards west coast IPA's."
"O- Fantastic IPA! The 7.3% ABV hides very well and i will be picking up more of these for the low price of $7.35 a sixer"
"I'm a certified hop head. I'll be drinking many, many more of these."
