Huge floral aroma. Very flowery beer. Sharp resin bitter taste, followed by hints of floral notes and strong fruity citrus notes.","kkleu357","Yesterday at 09:59 AM"

The bready maltiness actually dominates on both the nose and tongue for me. The fruity and bitter elements from the hops are there but pretty subtle when compared to a lot of other west coast IPAs. This is a real quality brew, but, considering the cost, I'm not sure I'll come back to it anytime soon....a couple more bucks will get me a sixer of some other great stuff.","beermeplz","Mar 05, 2015"

In the taste and the aroma there's lots of citrus fruit notes with some apples and pears in there too, with a nice, bready, malt backbone. very crisp and finishes cream, overall a really top notch IPA, Tasty, smooth, balanced, no bitterness.","SteveB24","Feb 18, 2015"

I've come across it a few times since, with only a handful of times being this fresh. Will definitely go back out and pick more up tomorrow.

4.51,6.1,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"I've heard a lot of good things about Alesmith. As a recent Maryland transplant in California, I was very much eager to try any beer from this brewery. The beer poured a yellowish-amber hybrid with a good head--even if it dissipated relatively quickly. The aroma was a lot maltier than I expected with a distinct resinous hop note. The taste is sublime. The strong hopiness hits the palate first, but it is married with the malt to the point that it becomes one indistinguishable flavor--a very, very good thing. The balance of this IPA is impressive and has become a serious challenger to DFH 90 min for favorite IPA. I feel like I need to run out and get a 4-pack of DFH to compare immediately.","thomda11","Jul 02, 2014"

Tastes amazing..crisp and refreshing with.nicely balanced hops and malty sweetness. A perfect example of a west coast IPA. This one is now very close to the top of my list.","FFreak","May 01, 2014"

Tropical fruit comes through a bit more as well. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Carbonation is what you'd expect from an IPA. Overall this is a great west coast IPA.

Flavor is similarly bright and hoppy, with a really pleasant grapefruit/citrus taste. Very smooth in mouthfeel, like an English IPA, with a creamy, almost oily, finish. No coincidence: lace is already forming on the glass. This is a great Left Coast American IPA. Aggressive and strong, but delicious and pleasant enough to be a standard bearer for the category.","hreb","Dec 31, 2013"

Great head retention, great taste, cool orange-amber color, a very stylish and tasty beverage. A worthwhile beverage any day of the week. However, a 22 of it is $6 compared to $5 for Gigantic Brewery's IPA just down the road, which I much prefer due to notes of orange rather than a mad Pine-Sol aroma, so I've got to give it a 4/5 due to my being a local beer snob.","bsonk","Dec 03, 2013"

Alesmith’s IPA is bottle conditioned which poured a hazy golden copper with a great fruity aroma. What a great hoppy beer flavor without being too extreme. It has some malt in the background to give it a good balance and keeping it easy to drink. I hope it makes its way to Texas soon, as I need another one!","brurevu","Dec 02, 2013"

Absolutely first rate. I was surprised by the lack of carbonation thereafter. This is a fantastic IPA that I have wanted to taste for a long time, and finally got the chance after my local store stocked it. The mouthfeel and aftertaste scored lower for me because I expect carbonation, & the bitters at the back of my tongue seemed *just* a little slimy. But these are minor issues for a fantastic drink.

It is as if the beer has an identity crisis between being a juicy, west-coast IPA and a bitter, pine-forward English IPA.

My *undiluted* IPA poured a great gold color with a nice lace that rises above the liquid line slightly. The aroma was awesome: sweet, crisp and bitter cascade hops (those kinds that let you know immediately that you are dealing with California hops) hit the nose, couldn't ask for more in a fragrance. The taste was good too, sweet at first and bitter as it goes down. Leaves a nice bitter aftertaste, it isn't very balanced but the hops are so good I didn't mind much. The mouthfeel is good, very bubbly and overall this beer lived up to its high rating, try a bottle for yourself.","BearslikeBeers","Aug 23, 2013"

Nice carbonation which tells me this will be a refreshing ipa. Smells of resinous fruits like grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and pineapple. Also get some pine and like a bubblegum smell from the sweet malts. Taste is very much like it smells. starts with the resinous fruits such as pineapple and tangerine. Then in the middle there is a great balance of malt: get bready flavors as well as a creamy carmel sweetness. Then the finish is an incredible blend of the sweet, carmely malts and the resinous hop qualities. Get a prominent bubblegum flavor, as well as hints of pineapple, pine, grapefruit, and lemon. The bitterness gets more astringent as it goes through the flavor profile; however, the sweet and bready malts also get more prominent on the finish, so there is a nice balance at the end. A nice dry, crisp, clean finish. Medium body with a creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Wish I could get this more often. Just an incredible IPA.","brewskis","Aug 12, 2013"

Overall this is balanced too well for my taste, I like my ipas a lot more on the hoppy side, from a balanced point of view it's great","lordofstarside","Feb 10, 2013"

4.19,-1.4,4.25,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Poured out of the bottle and it looks like beer. Its been filtered and looks like any normal beer but one things stands out. The head retention. The fact that it does not look like it is going away says that this is going to be a sticky beer with tons of hop oils in the flavor. Lacing galore all over my glass. Am I wrong? the smell is no different. I get tons of sweet hop juice. Citrus hits the nose strong and it appears there is this sweet malt character as well. Amazing for such a filtered beer to have such a sweet citrus like smell. I know it sounds weird but most of the filtered IPAs I have had are bitter instead of smelling fruit like. Now for the taste. Not as much citrus in the flavor as I thought but its there and there is a hint of bitterness but overall, this is one tasty easy to drink IPA. For a standard IPA, its pretty darn tasty. Nothing mind blowing but this has hops in the west coast tradition. Lost of the m but when it comes to bitterness, it takes a back seat when the malts come in to mellow it out. So for the flavor I would say I get that citrusy earthy flavors most IPAs are known by. I was more intrigued by the smell though. Nevertheless, the mouthfeel for this beer does it justice. Its full bodied. Sticky and carbonated just right. Overall this is a great IPA for people that are not looking for a bitter hop bomb but for one that is looking for some nuances. Well done. Easy to drink and worth the 6 bucks I paid. Is it the best ever? No but for a standard IPA there will be very few this good. Try this out.","Vancoubeer","Feb 09, 2013"

4.17,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall (4.0): Thank god. It has been a long time since I’ve smelled a REALLY fresh hop bomb, and I’ve been missing it. It also looks and feels quite nice, but I found the flavor profile to be bit one-note. The malt is what it is, plain and dry, and the hops are mostly bitter and not as much flavor, which I was really looking for after the nose. It does what it does very well, but I was hoping for something more dynamic in the hop character. Still, very well-done.","fmccormi","Sep 19, 2012"
3.83,-9.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4," There's a little bit each of caramel and bready aromas, and those are met by a floral, sweet orange peel, citrus smell. The malt backbone is pretty much perfect. Again, some bready and some caramel notes. Enough of each to be appreciable, but both still subtle enough that they should, in theory,stay out of the way of the hops. The problem here is that the hops just don't quite deliver. There's a little bit of bitterness, but not the sharp bite I've come to look forward to from an IPA. Similarly, the orange-grapefruit citrusy close is nice, but not bold enough. The body, like the malt flavors, is spot on. There's a tiny bit of sturdiness, but it still definitely falls on the dry side of the spectrum. The carbonation could stand to have a little more life to it though. I've been holding off a while on trying Alesmith IPA due to the lack of bottle dating. I finally found some on draft, and I have to say, I'm a little bit underwhelmed.","axeman9182","Sep 18, 2012"

Flavor is sweet and honey like. Not particularly bitter, plenty of lemon and tangerine, but nothing particularly assertive. I think the malts are overpowering in this example, and the bitterness needs a bit of help queuing up. Medium bodied with nice, slightly hi and sharp carb and an off dry finish. Decent beer, and I'd suggest it to an IPA newcomer. I wouldn't suggest it to a tried hop-head. Too much malty sweetness is similar to the 90min IPA.","harrymel","Sep 05, 2012"

Sticky suds lace the glass as the beer is being drunk. The bouquet consists of pine, grass and lemon zest, with occasional notes of burning peat. It has a soft, wet mouthfeel that yields to a gentle carbonation scrub. A lot of pine flavor from start to finish. Less prominent grapefruit flavor, but the bitterness unique to grapefruit is present. It is well-balanced by the grain, and, thankfully, not overpowered by it. The pleasant mouthfeel rounds out the experience. Nothing to get terribly excited about, but a good IPA.","DocJitsu","Aug 11, 2012"

4.47,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5/5): AleSmith IPA is a solid, stellar example of a West Coast-style American India Pale Ale. It has what I look for in my favorite style of beer: high levels of grapefruit-like bitterness that resolves in a long and satisfyingly dry finish. Not too complex, just concentrates on delivering lots of hop flavor to satisfy my inner hop head. There is no noticeable alcohol presence and drinkability is high. This beer isn't necessarily what I would call "accessible", but for any craft beer drinker that's adventurous, doesn't mind high levels of bitterness, and is looking for a legitimately great example of the American IPA style I recommend this beer to them. A benchmark of the West Coast style IPA along with Green Flash WC IPA, Firestone Union Jack, Ballast Pt. Sculpin, and Port Wipeout (oh, and Stone IPA, too). It's in great company.

Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a sticky, soapy cap. Amazingly fresh aroma: grapefruit, pungent pineapple, ripe orange, and solid sweet caramel malt beneath. Bread and biscuit aromas grew as the temperature warmed. Smooth feel with a lightly tangy and resinous feel as the carbonation rolls through. Flavors are very similar to aromas: fresh, but pungent, citrus hop flavors with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Again, bready, biscuity flavors intensified as things warmed up. A bit of pine hop flavor at the finish that lingered for a while.","IronLover","Apr 21, 2012"

Pretty light body, with a clean and crisp finish. Dangerously drinkable, with only a suggestion of alcohol on the palate. The smell and flavour on this had me pulling this to my mouth more often than I should have for the bomber. Great hop profile, and an exceptional IPA overall.","liamt07","Jan 03, 2012"

Malts come through on the mid palate, and then the beer finishes with lingering dryness. Very long finish on this one. Not as aggressive as some of its San Diego IPA cousins, this medium to lighter bodied beer (given its size) lacks that big citrus hop explosion I have come to anticipate from West Coast IPAs.

My first thought was this might be a weaker IPA than I typically enjoy because of the soft/clear color and lack of a big nose. The taste was enjoyable, but I didn't pick up any distinctive characteristics. It’s a well-made beer and enjoyable to drink, but it doesn’t compare to other IPA in terms of overall hoppy satisfaction. It actually seemed to have more in common with a good pale ale than an IPA. I would love to try it again off a tap and see how it compares to my first experience.","mikechance","Jul 12, 2011"

Taste is very well balanced. Up front lots of pineapple juice and bubbles followed by fresh grapefruit juice, citrus hops, and some sweet caramel malt. Spicy, dry finish. Best IPA in the world? Pretty close but I might take Sierra Nevada Harvest over this one. But damn this is good.","DustinPowers74","Jul 09, 2011"

Citrusy and fruity, pithy, bitter and clean. The hops are not cloying or otherwise. Some pine flavor is produced and the malt is clean and simple allowing the hops to be the showcase.

Aroma is a floral punch, with citrus notes of grapefruit and a twinge of mango. This guy was floral the moment I opened the bottle, and is really a treat to smell. Taste follows suit, but adds tons of pine, and a great bitter kick. Malt backbone is perfect - the hops never get out of control, and all the hop-associated flavors are allowed to come out smoothly with each sip. Mouthfeel is great, as the carbonation is there just enough to keep everything moving around, but not too much as to get in the way of any of the awesome flavors. Drinkability is also off the charts due to the balance from start to finish. At 6$ a bomber where I got this, this has to be one of the best deals I can think of.","veinless","Jan 29, 2011"

Taste starts off with citrus flavors with a nice malty sweetness. Mouthability was smooth, medium bodied, and well-carbonated along with a nice head and laces that were left throughout. Other than taste, drinkability was the highlight of this beer as it consisted of a smooth nice malt characteristic for an American IPA.

4.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep copper color, with a light, filmy head. There are aromas of heavy hops, with very green/pine notes. The beer has a heavy hop-forward, front tongue flavor, which is extremely well balanced with sweet, citrus flavor. The beer is round and robust, yet crisp in mouth and with aftertaste. Sweet and robust on the aftertaste, with a crisp, light finish. This beer could be trouble, because it is so tasty, and so easy to drink. Fantastic beer!","GarthDanielson","Dec 29, 2010"

There is a nice hops bitterness on first taste but the bitterness doesn't linger as there is the perfect balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. This is as balanced of an IPA as I've ever tasted while managing to be not boring. I could drink this beer all day long.

My first comment was that this beer was a bit too sweet for an IPA and although it didn't make it undrinkable, but does take away from how I like this beer. It has a beautiful hazy orange color with just a light glazing of foam that easily dissipates. The aroma is strongly piney with a bit of fruity sweet note. The beer has great bitterness and hop qualities, that are resinous, pineapple, almost lychee like in it's tropical character.

4.13,-2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The most interesting aspect of this beer, besides the length of time that the lacing sticks around, is how the flavor changes as the beer warms up. It being a bomber and me being only one man, albeit thirsty, I took me a good 45 minutes to drink this down. The last 6-8oz at almost room temp came across as a completely different beer. All bitterness mellowed into the smooth caramel that I had smelled up front. Like a melting piece of butterscotch, I let this swish around in my mouth a lot long than my dinner guest would have liked. I have dubbed this beer "Two-Face", for having two distinct personalities, but not one of them unattractive in any way. I have always admired AleSmith for Speedway Stout, and now they rank in my two favorite categories.","milesmayhem","Nov 09, 2010"

Smells - pine up front, some citrus, a bit of Mr. Clean (but in a good way.) Some sweet caramely malt as well, but not overpowering. Very clean. Flavors are very piney and lemony. Again, reminiscent of Mr. Clean (though I've never had a sip of it.) Delicious clean finish, not much lingering bitterness. At 7.5 it's pretty bold for a single IPA, but only a gentle warmth lingers.

Aroma is big hop, pine, citrus, malt and a bit of old leather. Flavor is like nose and richer with just enough sweetness to balance the hops and carbonic acid. Body is very good and so is carbonation; both just right for this beer. Finish is like flavor, slowly tapering with good length and a little alcohol at the end. I would have rated it better but for its grapefruit characeteristics which I'm not all that fond of.","drpimento","Oct 24, 2010"

It's a mixture of faint pine with floral and fruity notes. There's citrus, but also a bit of mango. You can even smell some caramel malt. The malt is actually pretty abundant in the taste. I don't want to sound as if it's too much; it's just really well balanced. The hops were also pretty balanced. There's a pine, citrus, and floral note, but one doesn't really overpower the other. I really like that it had a hint of stickiness in the feel and carbonation was just right. No real alcohol presence. This is a really good IPA but may be a hair overpriced for what it is.","alkemy","Oct 07, 2010"

The malt backbone isn't really there to support this style of hopping. Not bad, just not balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and modestly carbonated.

Great nose - sweet grapefruit and tropical fruit esters. Taste is a muted version of the nose with some malt character in the mix and a slightly piny/medicinal character that comes out at the back (I'm thinking this may be an older bottle). Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild carbonation and a slightly watery consistency. Not a bad IPA at all; however, I think this was a bottle that was past it's prime.

A equally lovely layer of fluffy foam sits on top, slowly melting into the beer and leaving sticky lace. The aroma is full on American northwest hops. Grapefruit, orange and pine. I also detect just a bit of toasted malty sweetness. One sip and I can tell this is definitely a west coast IPA. Tons of hop flavor inundates my tongue. Grapefruit, pine, orange and some dank skunkyness. These hops taste fresh as hell and are delicious. The malt is WAY in the back but does a good job of holding up the hops and keeping this from being too much of a bruiser. Not as bitter as some west coast IPAs, I really am digging what this beer has to offer. The mouthfeel is medium with a very nice amount of carbonation and a clean dry finish. Very drinkable if you are into hops, and one of the finest, if not THE finest IPA I have ever had.","zoso1967","May 14, 2010"

A little bit of juicy tropical flavor shines through while pine and grapefruit dominate. The taste brings the aroma to full light with a biting wet hop mouthfeel and a crisp drinkable easy malt backbone. Perfectly balanced to my hophead tastes with a smell that will reel you in and keep asking for more, even when the 22oz runs dry.

The taste is similar with a crisp finish which adds to the drinkability. The bitterness of the hops lingers a little, but it fades quickly and completely enough to allow exceptional drinkability. The mouthfeel could have just a little more carbonation to allow for a slightly more airy texture. But it was good nonetheless. Exceptional beer.

4.41,3.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another surprise find at Table & Vine. I had read about the insane head on this beer but I still wasn't prepared, as soon as I opened it carbonation bubbles are clearly seen flying up in the bottle, I pour very slowly and it still reveals 50% towering white head, 50% very light orange beer with numerous carbonation bubbles flying everywhere, and a tiny bit of sediment also. The head slowly dissipates and crumbles into strange beastly shapes, leaves lacing down the glass like cotton candy. A city could be hidden in there. Smell is faint at first but comes out a bit more when the head calms down, smells much like the great tastes - floral hops, citrus/peach, tropical fruit and lemon notes. Tastes get better and more prominent with every sip. Very drinkable, alcohol barely detectable. The last pour (3rd overall) is much more hazy and full of sediment, other than that drinks about the same. Light and a good amount of carbonation. The great thing about this beer is that it has all the traits of your average IPA yet it is so much more than that, much more complex. I don't think it's A+ worthy because it didn't really WOW me, but it's really damn close. A must-try for IPA fans.","Chico1985","Dec 30, 2009"

The head never quit, and unless you pour the beer ultra slowly fully tipped, you will have to wait out the foamy thick billowing head from this beer. The beer is a bit cloudy with some fine particulates floating about. I will review this beer with more contemplation at a later time, but for now, the beer has the orange burst of an American IPA. It is not as grapefruity or acerbic or estery and oily from the hop. The hop quality seemed a bit dry and leafy but the nice orange burst was a treat.

The aroma hits me from a couple feet away, this is going to be a great IPA. I can smell the hops, grapefruity, floral goodness. The taste punches my tongue and I want it to keep beating me. This is a great beer. Have to say the only downside is that after a couple sips, my taste buds are destroyed. Either I stick with the hops or I will have to go to my backup session beer because this is so flavorful I can't taste anything else. The mouthfeel is what I would expect out of a good IPA, lightly carbonated with a medium body. The drinkability is great, I could drink a couple of these. However I would probably fall down after that because I can definitely feel the alcohol in this one. Great beer!","bigreduw64","Dec 18, 2009"

This head is a monster, I thought Sculpin was nuts. One hand head that retains like a freakin superhero. No points are deducted from this on appearance, there is nothing wrong here. Smell is good stuff. Large hints of pine, pineapple, citrus fruits like lemon and orange, more hops. This is certainly a hop bomb, the malts are there but no where in sight in the hose. I would give it a 5.0 but Sculpin's scent is a whole level above this. Taste is also a hop bomb, malts in there but it's mostly a nice blend of citrus hops, pineapple is amazing in this beer. Piney hops also present. Mouthfeel is appropriate, nice medium carbonation, moderate body, perfect for a huge IPA.

Its bold flavors and higher ABV put it at the border of DIPA country. A little more juice and it might have to defect.

Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is sticky/resinous, body is medium. I'm torn, I really wanted to love this one, but I just don't. I find it over carbonated, one dimensional and a little boring.

This beer creates a big 3 inch head that leaves some really sticky lacing tight lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma is very similar to any good west coast American IPA. Hops, hops and citrusy hops. The nose starts out with bright orange, a little lemon, and finished with just a bit of bitter white grapefruit rind. There is also just a light, mild, malty sweetness that lingers in the nostril at the tail of the aroma. The flavor is very similar but Grapefruit really is the dominant flavor. Rind bitterness, orange and just a bit of medical bitterness. I'm actually surprised with how much malt comes through. There is definitely a bit of a backbone to the hops. The mouthfeel is light leaving a great citrusy residue lingering on the palate. This really is a great brew. Glad I finally got the opportunity to try it.","hwwty4","Oct 21, 2009"

It has a really strong piney and citrus hop presence and hop oils etc, without even hinting at the slightly malt base. Slightly sweet taste to start but very dry to finish. It seems to go overboard on the carbonation too. I'm surprised how well it made the time on the shelf as it still has its great hop tastes, aromas, bitterness, and hasn't malted or sweetened and many beers like this would. It also has a lot of sediment that came from extra bottle conditioning over time, I assume, and probably left behind the ridiculous carbonation. I've had some better IPAs before, both WC and EC, but this one is still a good fallback if you can get it.

The aroma is a nice citrus/grapefruit hop aroma. Very juicy. The taste is of grapefruit hops, a bit of pine and asprin. There is a noticable malt presence but it takes a way backseat to the malt, can't really distinguish it in the flavor. A nice moderate feel with soft to tingley carbonation, which gives the brew a smooth feel. However, the asprin like characteristics lead to a very dry brew, which is a negative in my book.

A bit sweet, not as dry as some and definitely not as hoppy as some others (doesn't taste or smell dry-hopped).

The taste is all bittering hops in the fore. During the middle of the blush there is some slight aromatic hop presence, but the finish returns to that super bitter pine flavor.

Dense citrusy nose of pink and white grapefruit, mandarin orange and lemon citrus chunks, pine, crisply baked scones, the fruit scents tart but in no way over the top in striving for tropicality, nectarine, pineapple, peach, guava, powdery mocha from the malts, a floral musk fills the nostrils before it dissolves, extending presence. Medium-bodied, muscular without trying to take up too much room just for the sake of it. While dry and leaving a tacky residue behind, the grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus can be as sweet as it can be sour. Less pine, more general herbaceousness bitterness. The bready or yeasty component reduced. The florality a bit earthbound, yet, no less pungent. Apricot and peach more present as it warms.

The head of this beer was not too thick, some lacing on the glass, and the head subsided fairly quickly. The color is not quite see through, light amber. The aromas are of a typical west coast IPA, piney, not much flowery or fruity accents, just hop smells. This beer is pretty carbonated, I like the way that it evens out the beer. The IPA is bitter, has some toasty carmel malt backbone, but the aftertaste is all hops. This is textbook Cali IPA.","rmaste6282","May 14, 2009"

The nose is the most distinct pineapple aroma I've ever got from a beer. IPAs often give off vague fruity type aromas, but this one is very obviously pineapple to me. Wow. Bits of citrus and piney hops combine with the fruity pineapple to give this beer a robust, flavorful hop profile, backed by a nice sweet vanilla type malt bill. Pretty hearty, yet maintains a relatively lively mouthfeel and is quite drinkable. Wonder why we hardly ever get this beer out East while most of Alesmith's other offerings do come in... no matter, I still manage to have some in my fridge. Definitely a(nother) great west coast IPA.

Sure the flavors could be a bit more but I am not bitching. Everything going on in here is good or better. Mostly better than good.

Some toasty, caramel maltiness with lots of hops over it. Almost balanced, but the hops are huge and win out with a bitter finish. Very nicely drinkable, but you can still feel the alcohol. Medium, clean palate with soft carbonation. My one hang up is that there is a slight soapy note in the finish that tastes like a weird play between the hops and alcohol.

It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a super clean beer, that was bitter and delicious. It had great flavor and good body. It hid the alcohol well (high for a standard IPA), and is pretty easy to drink. It's not necessarily a balanced beer, but it shouldn't be.

4.83,13.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Wow. Excellent beer. I was trying to pick a solid beer for my 200th, and I went with an IPA, instead of a fancier style, in order to save something grander for number 250. However, this is a fabulous IPA. The beer looks great, sticky head, perfect amber-gold color for an IPA. The aroma is very clean. Hops are citric, floral and piney. Caramel malt is present and well-articulated. The flavor is exceptional, even in this highly competitive category. Alesmith knows how to use hops. The hop flavor is perfectly clean. There is some bitterness, but it's extremely pleasant and doesn't scald in the least. The malt is strong enough to bring out the flavors of the hops, without being cloying in the least. It's just extremely smooth. The citrus and floral hops balance very, very well with the malt. The mouthfeel is excellent, but there is a tiny bit of alcohol around the edges. The beer is exceptionally easy to drink. Alesmith makes great beer, and this is definitely one of them. My one qualm with this beer is that it is extremely close to being a DIPA rather than an IPA. I like for styles to be loose and allow innovation, but I almost wish that there was a hard and fast line for this division.","popery","Feb 11, 2009"

An absolutely delicious balance of honey & crystal malts backed by tons of juicy, floral, citric, and resinous hops. The aftertaste lingers for just the right amount of time and packs a potent bitterness level, while the medium body is perfectly carbonated thanks to the bottle conditioning. This has easily become one of my all-time favorite IPA's, and I cannot wait to try it again further down the road.","wagenvolks","Feb 02, 2009"

An nice 3 finger white, fluffy head then appears and will stick around with ya until your glass is empty. Each sip you take leaves a nice lace ring along the glass. The smell is of fresh hops that had an incredibley floral smell to them. One of the most unique smelling IPA's I've ever had. A touch of pine and citrus in there as well, for the record. The taste was suprisingly balanced. This isnt a hop-bomb by any means. A wonderful caramel malt backbone with a citric hop kick. Stong flavors of citrus here, espeically pineapple. Overall its pretty mellow for IPA standards but it will leave a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth, dont be fooled. A medium bodied beer with an oily, bitter aftertaste left behind. Given the higher ABV, which isnt noticeable, I'm giving this a 5 on drinkablitiy. The taste is so well balanced and unique I kept wanting to go back for more.

The Alesmith IPA pours a chill hazed orange brown color with a huge white "donut pillow" of a white head, im not sure if they planned to have the head cave in but god damn does it intensify the nose! The aroma of tons of fresh semi sweet hops fill the glass. The taste is much the same, smooth and very well balanced lots of strong pungent fresh hops battle in the mouth, good peppery spice esters emanate from the beers flavor as well as a solid biscuity yeast character from the bottle conditioning. Slightly woody with notes of maple syrup and brown sugar. Grapefruit blasts sneak in more and more as the bottle gets lower.

My feelings for this beer don't seem to exactly mesh with some of the other recent reviews, as far as hop presence and body go, so next time I'm in CA I'd love to try this fresh as this bottle came from Akron, OH and well, Ohio is Ohio (hey, it's the start of college football, I can be antagonistic if I want)","yourefragile","Aug 30, 2008"

It pours slightly darker than golden, but with a slight haze (probably because of the bottle-conditioning), and with a minimal head...but one that persists until the last drop. I would call it attractive. The aroma is good with some nice hops, yet there's a bit of something else (slightly tart/almost stinky) I'm not a huge fan of. I've had the same thing in some other beers too, and I don't think it's a flaw. I guess it's just some characteristic from ingredients and/or the brewing process I don't find especially pleasing. I do like the flavor more than the aroma. A clean, malty flavor provides the basic background for the hops to shine. I'm guessing there's a mix of hops used here...quite possibly some various C-hops. The finish is fairly dry with a lingering hop flavor and bitterness. Right now, I'm being reminded of Bear Republic's Racer 5 (which I also like...especially fresh on tap.)

After pouring the end of the bomber, it clouds up and is a nice hazy amber, and the body seemed to thicken up a bit.

It's nothing crazy, but is is extremely well balanced. Flavor is almost unnecessary to elaborate on. Nice pine levels with a tangy fruit tone. I mean this really just can't go anywhere else. Just frickin' smooth. Slightly noticeable tone of alcohol kicks it down just ever so slightly when it's at the wrong temperature. Just has to be chilled ever so properly. Leaves a nice burn in my chest as I sip. Consider it more of a warm fuzzy feeling. Feel has a very good liquid touch and the carbonation is nice as well.

Aroma is mainly citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some lemon peel, caramel malt and pine. Taste is mainly citrus and piney hops, and there's some caramel malt noticable too. Hoppy bitter finish lingers around for a little while. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, and a bit sticky. Carbonation is between moderate and high (but closer to moderate), it has a nice zippy feeling.

Smell is very fresh and inviting, not quite like the Yulesmith but pretty close. Sweet grapefruit and hints of tangerine with some piney hops also present. A light caramel malt background rounds it out. Taste is also pretty citrus fruit oriented. Grapefruit is the main culprit and there is less of a malt background here. Not a stand out but solid for sure. Mouthfeel is nice and bitter, almost resinous. Bigger than most IPA's with lively carbonation on the tongue and a slightly dry finish. Overall good drinkability.

Waiting around for a while but finally had to crack it open last night. Poured a very nice hazy amber with a nice thick and sticky three inches or more of head on top. The retention was fantastic and even when it finally did calm down some it still left behind lace that was so thick you could not even see the contents of the glass. Lots of carbonation was visible inside from the very beginning and the also a lot of sediment residing inside both the bottle and the glass. Smell was obnoxiously hopped with huge floral aromas of pine, orange, and grapefruit. A slightly sweet base was apparent, but totally overwhelmed by the hops. The taste was just absurd, such a good thick IPA.. Huge floral hop taste that was just sticky it tasted so fresh. A really huge hop presence with a ton of pine flavors and lots of sweet orange mixed in. Great medium body with a huge bitter dry and sticky finish. Great carbonation through out never let you down. This was just awesome and the bottle went in no time. No hint of the ABV at all which was very nice. Overall this was one of the best IPAs I have had, with definitely a west coast flavor to it. This is definitely a brew to be reckoned with and came off more of a double to me then anything else. But none the less it was fantastic and really a great experience. I will definitely be looking for more of this, and you should be too.","mikesgroove","Oct 25, 2007"

Aroma is sweet and strong with citrus, hint of pine. Initial taste is mostly overwhelmed by the sweetness, turning citrusy, then very dry from all the hops. There might be other components in there, but honestly when you dump that much hop-action in there, forget it. Aftertaste is very hoppy and long lasting. Light to medium body, very light carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden and drinkable. For the price I'd prefer something else, but maybe worth another drink down the line.","joekfsu","Oct 14, 2007"

A strong floral, earthy, and citrusy scent overwhelms the nose, then a slight mild scentof malt comes through. The taste starts with citrus and grassy flavors encircles the palate from front to back, surrounding a mild malty flavor in the middle. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy at the front the front, then thins out at the back. This beer is a hopheads delight, strong hoppy aroma and flavor, though more malt in the flavor and a more even mouthfeel would make this more drinkable.","cameraman","Sep 03, 2007"

The flavor of carapils and pale malts nearly offsets the hop bitterness, but instead creates a foundation for a truely great flavor. I wish that I could create the high alpha acid aroma that this brewer has perfected in this bottle. It's awesome. It goes down so damn smooth. This is near perfect as an IPA is concerned. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass IPA. It's got malt complexity. It's got hop character.

The complex flavors were abundant and very satisfying- big, in your face hop bitterness with a lot of piney, but not resinous flavor. Malts were surprisingly well represented and gave the brew a nice smooth sweetness and kept the hops at bay. The finish was the best part by far- huge hop flavor without the IBU explosion and lasting bitterness.

The first couple of times that I had had it were bad batches, with almost no carbonation, so I discounted my opinion, and would try again. I've had it about 3 other times since then, including the review beer, and aside from the appearance, it just doesn't do it for me.

I was expected a large west coat IPA bur rather got an excellent balance of the hop bitterness and the malty sweetness. I savored every drop of this one.

Taste is top notch. Hardly any bitterness on the tounge except towards the end. Big sweet citrus flavor with enough malt to balance this one out just right. I hardly detect any alcohol in this one which is shocking because 7.2% abv for an IPA is pretty high. Mouthfeel is light/medium with a fair amount of carbonation. Very fresh and crisp.

Just right, the perfect IPA that's still very very hoppy. The mouthfeel is nice, carbonated well, but the bubbles just fall to the back of your throat. It's got a good body too!!

Aroma was very nice: spicy and hoppy. The taste was very good, with a more complex malt profile than is normal for IPAs, I think. Many IPAs seem a bit one-dimensional to me. This one was very balanced. Certainly, fans of strong hops will be happy with it, but that's not all there is to this brew. Perhaps it was the salty food I was eating with it, but this beer seemed rather sweet--more so than any IPA I have tried previously. By no means is that a complaint, however. This was a very good beer.

There is a slight toasty caramel flavor to it. But as it warms up it turns to a bready flavor that blends the malt sweetness together with the hops. Very pleasant. The aromas transfer nicely to make up the body of the beer. Bready, caramelly sweet. Nice blend, very well balanced. there also seems to be some passion fruit to it that comes out. Very nice.

This beer is so balenced, it hides its strength very well. I brought this bottle back from CA, hopefully it makes its way out the the East Coast soon.","ericj551","Jan 29, 2007"

Excellent creamy lacing gets left all around the glass. Understated aroma of piney hops, with a whiff of grapefruit and some light sweet malt. Palate is damn near perfect - nice, citrusy hops meld with a tasty light and caramel malt profile. Finish is dry, lightly fruity, and sweet.

Im getting all facets of hop aroma here. Citurs, spice, earth, and flowers are all in line. Some nice honey aroma works its way through to represent the malt. Again a quality blend of hop flavor takes over as I drink also. Stong bitterness is sure to get your attention. Very resinous, and stinky from the lips to the tonsils.

A treat for this East coaster to try this fine brew on tap for my first Alesmith IPA experience. This one pours a typical medium shade of almond amber, with a fairly dull tan head and leaving splattered lacing upon a gentle swirl. the excitement starts with the crisp hoppy nose and the resiny hops that carry this brew across the tongue and taste buds.

I get some brief pine halted almost instantly by lots of caramel malt. What gives? Taste is dominated by citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and orange. Sadly none of these reach out and grab the dominant role. Malt is also very heavy, bordering something of an amber. It tastes good but honestly you probably have an IPA brewed in your backyard that does this as well. Mouth is smooth and nice.

First swig was a bit too hoppy and full for me, but as it warmed up towards the end of the large bottle the taste mellowed and didnt have a lot of bite like the first taste. Mouthfeel was not bad, a bit bubbly and spicey aftertaste.

Initial grapefruit hop bite followed by a nutty/toasted malt backing. Not as sweet as some IPAs, but different and very good. Finishes like orange juice does. Full and citrisy.

I know it's bottle conditioned but even the first four ounces out of the bomber were hazy. The head has small bubbles, lasts forever and is merenque-esque. The flavor is great, a full mouth of centennial (I think) hop flavor and bitterness nicely held up by a pedestal of malt sweetness and some mild alcohol warmth. The mod low carbonation makes for a smooth mouthfeel and keeps the hops from bowling over the rest of the flavors. This was a higly drinkable IPA.

Some malt is there; it's gotta be there, because the hop levels in this IPA are so strong that it could easily cross the "too much" line...but it doesn't! Credit due to the implied, understated, yet fully functional malt presence. Juicy, smooth mouthfeel; dry yet sweet; my tongue buzzes from hop astringency. Lovely. Just insanely drinkable.

4.58,7.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Pours a hazy, deep copper hue and makes a thick creamy white head that slowly diminishes into a thin layer of tiny dense bubbles which never fades. Dense Belgian lacing clings to the sides of my glass. Some pine and citrus aromas appear from a quick swirl of the glass, there's a hint of sweet malts as well. Flavor hits the tongue hard with a mouth-puckering strong bitterness and then the sweet malted backbone rushes in to bring a wonderful balance. Massive herbal and grassy hop flavors mixed with tart grapefruit citrus and pine with just the right ammount of caramel malt balance to make this one taste as good as a west coast IPA can taste. Bottle conditioning gives this a nice creamy texture on the palate and then closes with an astringent dry finish. A really well done IPA in the west coast style, I enjoy AleSmith IPA often.","kmcnair","Jan 14, 2006"

4.03,-5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste equally good; The hops flood the palate with crisp, spicy, bitter flavors that are balanced very well by the sweetness of the malt. I'm not a hop head, but appreciate this style of beer and think that this is an extremely well-rounded, full-bodied example of an IPA. The 7.25 alcohol content doesn't make an appearance in flavors, instead by way of cheerful warmth. I've run into a few IPAs that are simply too spicy and astringent; This one is full and smooth on the palate.","Tupperwolf","Dec 24, 2005"
4.63,8.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The hazy peach to orange color looks especially cool with my laptop screen providing backlight in my dark room. Fabulous head retention. The nose is big and complex: lots of pine, complimented by orange sherbet, caramel malts, and pepper. It starts out with assertive grapefruity hops, but as this warms up floral and hops come through alone with silky smooth sweet malts. Oh fucking hell- the second pour is even better. It now dons a big frothy head that's not going anywhere and the yeast is in the glass now which is fine by me. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but it doesn't interfere with the drinkability. This is pretty awesome.","goschool","Dec 24, 2005"

Wonderful drape of lace on the side of the glass as I pause to drink. Mouth wakening bitterness. There is a lot of grapefruit in the front of the flavor. Mild caramel and just a hint of Jolly Rancher orange candy on the finish. Loads of Chinook hop in this beer. The bitterness is pronounced, but not harsh. The mouth feel is lick, mildly oily. Great drinkability as the alcohol is well hidden.","carln26","Dec 17, 2005"

4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks again to Kmpitz2 for sharing. Looks IPAish with a copper-orange hue and a little haze. Has incredible head retention. Smells very citrusy and pine-ey with an almost balanced barley malt base, allowing the hops to dominate the nose. Flavors are sweet of malt and hop flavored all at once. The hop flavor shows more of a citrus (grapefruit, oranges, lemon rinds) with the pine-ey, grass-ey flavors showing more in the back of the throat and a little more subtle in strength. All hop flavors and aromas swirl around a solid, but not overbearing, malt base. Very smooth and silky to the mouth. A joy to drink.

Pours a one finger nearly white head over a very cloudy light apricot colored liquid. Smells potently of grapefuit. Pithy, some pine, and a kind of driftwood dryness. Flavor is biting hop grapefruit with too much crystal malt. Disjointed. I don't know if age could bring the hops and sweet together. I think the hops would fall apart before the crystal malt settles. Well, shucks, I'm focusing on trash-talk when I've actually got a quality beer in my hand. It's enjoyable. Just not the soothing beverage I was hoping would add to the lull in my turkey-infused body. The hops leave the medium mouthfeel dry and the carbonation is medium.","mentor","Nov 25, 2005"

Flavor is huge pine and citrus hops perfectly balanced by a massive and complex malt base that offers no turn offs. Alcohol is well hidden and offsets the sweet malts to offer drying as the bitterness lingers. I can't think of a way to improve this and expect the haze was a simple matter of a rough ride before the pour.","karst","Nov 05, 2005"

The nose is grapefruity with a slight pale malt sweetness that gets sweeter as it warms up. Mid palate it has a fairly full mouthfeel and a nice balance of citrusy hops and mild sweetness that comes through as sort of ripe orangey, almost juicy. Finishes cleanly though, not exactly crisp but clean enough, and it has a faint malt aftertaste. Outstanding hop flavors and nicely balanced, but could be a touch crisper.","bcm119","Oct 01, 2005"

It might be their yeast strand that really allows those hops to shine. This IPA is such a blast of crisp hops, that doesnt get muddled in a malt mud. That is why it is so good. This might be my best example of a true Am IPA. I flew back from Portland with about 20 bomber bottles of varied beers. They should have been all Alesmith IPAs.

At some point I could also swear I tasted chocolate malt or some kind of dark roasty malt, but I've since learned that they use "honey malt" in this one. Hop character is very agressive, but malt balance is very clean, leaving very little sweetness in the mouth. Mouthfeel is excellent and flavor makes drinkability a no-brainer.

Hop aroma of citrus and spice, nearly perfumy. Some maltiness comes through as well, but is more restrained. Bitterness is a little restrained to start, but is balanced very well by a biscuity, malty base, plenty of orange/citrus hop flavour. A bit of alcohol warmth shows up in the finish, where the bitterness really shines. Creamy, moderate carbonation and medium/full body.

Nice sweet malty flavors followed by a bitterness that a fine IPA should have. Fine example of a awesome American IPA. Once beers warms a bit with glass, no lacing is left on the glass.

Today has been one of those crap-tastic days where I just need something good and hoppy to slip into and forget about the day (aside from Paul Hackett resigning from the Jets...woo hoo!). This light sunset brew should do the trick, with a spicy hop aroma and some citrus and gummy bear in the nose as well. The flavor of this brew surprises me; so much malt! Granted, it's balanced well with the resinous sticky bitterness of the hops, but I would file this in the malty American IPA category, a list with few names. This rounds out to be a bitter brew, starting with the chalky, toasted maltiness at the start, to the slightly charred sweet citrus fruits in the middle, to the bitter hoppy finish. Still, the malt can be tasted throughout. Burps reveal the hops. Mmmm. Mouthfeel shows hardly any carbonation, and the thin lace on top died quickly...what's up with that?

There is a very slight alcohol warmth noticeable in the finish, along with a tantalizing lingering bitterness to lead you into the next sip. Medium body and quite smooth, not overly sweet, and quite dangerously drinkable. I did not suspect that this was a 7.5% brew. Nice lacing clung artfully to the glass until the last drop.

Big coniferous seeds in the forms of C-hops make the malt appear very subdued. Taste is fresh and rather complex for the style. Orange skin, earth, and piney bitterness. Finish is long, hoppy, very dry, green, but perhaps a bit too alcoholic for its relatively low strenght. Hoppy all the way through, no mistakes about it.

Hop resins aplenty in the mouth as this one continues on the same path as the nose indicated building on a sweet toasted caramel malt base with a blend of piney, floral, & citrusy hops.

When poured into my usual pint glass, it had an orange amber colored body with a 2-inch thick beige head and a lively natural carbonation. Head retention was excellent and there was a ton of lace left all around as the beer went down. Aroma was assertive with floral hops dominating the bouquet. The taste was a bit brash with a strong alcohol presence, which was not quite hidden under the hops as it should be. There were notes of citrus on the palette, but these were quite subdued. The hop bitterness was also relatively low; however they added a good deal of spicy character to the mix. The mouthfeel was appropriately dry and creamy for the style. Alcohol burn detracts a bit from drinkability. A nice solid IPA to be had here.","rajendra82","Apr 04, 2004"

The retention is good and it holds well before dropping to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. Wide rings and thin splashes of lace add to its appearance. The nose delivers bright piney, floral, and subtly citrusy hops atop a caramel-accented maltiness. The body is medium and its very fine, natural carbonation caresses the tongue before fading smoothly away. The flavor offers a brilliant balance of rich, sweet caramelish malt; subtle yeasty fruitiness; piney and citrusy hops; and a solid bitterness. It's alcohol never makes an appearance on the palate; and it finishes quite dry with it's bitterness lingering long after it's maltiness has subsided.

The aroma definitely tells you that this beer is going to focus on the hops, I get notes of apricot and a pungent hoppiness. The apricot is the strongest aroma component, I like it. The apricot translates to the taste of the beer, it adds a bit of a fruity backdrop that interacts with the fruitiness from the ale yeast. A nice hop bit in the finish, followed by a clinging bitterness as a reminder of the beer that was just on my tongue. This is a nice IPA, not as extreme as some but I really like the flavor and aroma that is packed into this beer.","Gueuzedude","Nov 25, 2003"

The smell was very strong on hops as expected, but they were a bit more pine like than I was expecting. There was also a nice toasty malt character peaking through as well. The taste was great, with a wonderful piney hop profile and just enough malt character to balance it out. The bottle-conditioning gave the mouthfeel a very smoothe character and not overly carbonated at all. If I had to compare this to any other IPA, it would be Stone IPA. This one leans more on the side of the pine flavors and is not quite as dry tasting as the Stone. Between these two, I think one would have an IPA for every occation.","Dmann","Oct 27, 2003"

4.83,13.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Brilliant copper colored beer, topped by a vanilla colored head that lasts an exceptionally long time. After the head fades to a thick rocky layer of foam, a sweet floral aroma becomes more evident. Very nice aroma. Wow, the taste is truly phenomenal, with a combination of malty sweetness, and hops so strong they seem to be both sweet and bitter all at once. Then comes the finish. The flavors seem to completely vanish, but then a slight piney bitterness is noticed lurking around, dragging a wisp of sweetness around with it. Mouthfeel is very solid, and this beer seems to just slide down the throat. Drinkability is also exceptional, as a bomber of this feels like much too small a serving. I opened this beer with high expectations, which is usually a recipe for disappointment. But this time, my expectations were exceeded, save for the length of time I thought I'd be spending drinking this wonderful IPA. I'm grateful to have gotten a bottle of this. Do what you must to get one of your own. It will be worth the effort. Wow.","aaronh","Sep 08, 2003"

Amazingly balanced and a big beer that doesn't feel like 7.25% until the bomber's gone and you stand up to dance around the lawn like a giddy little school girl. Cool bottle by the way too.

Oh, the aroma is ga-good. I detect the floral hops wonderfully, but a good presence of the malts, hints of caramel. Mercy, a good flavor as well, perhaps I should start my training as an alesmith. The hop bite is balanced so well by the malt presence and those tiny little bubbles that you read about on the bottle. Those little bubbles make the beer feel great in your mouth.

Pouring the rest of the bottle with the dregs makes for a much milder 2nd glass, but no less tasty. Finishes strong, dry & well balanced. Nice smooth body make for a highly drinkable beer.

As a complete hophead, I really enjoy the complex hopping of this beer. Light to medium bodied mouthfeel is crisp and quite appropriate for an IPA. Although this beer is not quite balanced (malt to hops) enough for a non-hophead to drink all night, if your into the hops you'll want more than just one of these.

4.88,14.8,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Golden-orange hued brew topped with a massive head that stays quite well. Impressive. The aroma is of ultra-piney hops with an underlying sweetness of malt and a little vanilla. Again, impressive. Oh, the taste! What perfection! Very hoppy with the piney and bitter hops, but so malty smooth at the same time! Sweet cereal-with-sugar type maltiness, and vanilla once again. Malty smoothness is mostly in front, the hoppiness shows up best in the middle, and in the finish it goes back to the malt. Hops are a little leafy and resiny in the aftertaste, quite pleasant. Wow, I've been waiting for a very long time to sample AleSmith's beers, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of the very best IPAs out there. If it's available to you, get it!

Aroma is resiny, with grapefruit and pine dominating. Flavor is not at all what I was expecting based off of the aroma... begins with a clean malty sweetness, that quickly gives way to a hefty dose of grapefruit, then finishes with a spicy herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is rough and oily, with a medium body. I think this one could use a little more malt balance, but nonetheless, it's a good IPA.","zerk","Feb 26, 2003"

Citric and piney, they are at once aggressive and understated. Just perfectly well-integrated into the beer.

Big piney hoppiness is all over the aroma in this one. Almost resiny/hoppy aromas make me want to tip this glass up as soon as possible. Initial tingly hoppiness hits the tongue before a quick biscuity malt burst that drowns all else out for a moment. The creamy biscuity malt becomes more and more apparent as the brew gets warmer. Excellently balanced brew with a great piney and citrusy hoppy flavors through the finish with some light, just right, lingering bitterness. Smooth with a great crispness. The medium bodied smoothness really comes out once the brew hits about 60° or so. Absolutely excellent brew, I could drink this stuff all day and probably will do so if I ever get out to their brewpub.

Quite floral with a crisp lemon like tone that also is slightly sweet, also nice malt tones, a complex and pleasing nose to be sure. Could that be actual hops floating around in suspension? Ambrosial front with lots of malt and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is devilishly hopped, satanically carbonated and dry as Hells kitchen.

For the style, I've come to expect big, lasting heads. The thin bitter hops are truly balanced by the nice big biscuity malt. Some IPAs have a complex hop flavor where they're more than just bitter, but the profile on this one leans more towards the bitter with subtle piney and malty citric notes. The pine gets stronger as the beer warms. I also picked up a nice organge fruit flavor as well that made this a pretty good beer.","aracauna","Oct 07, 2002"
