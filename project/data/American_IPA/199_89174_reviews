"Poured into pint glass.  Straw color, with a fluffy white head.  Moderate carbonation. I'm not sure that adding grapefruit improves Sculpin which, in my opinion, was pretty damn good to start with.  The extra citrus boost does give this brew a different character, but if I had a choice I'd stick with just plain Sculpin."
""
"Nice golden straw color pour into an ipa glass and just a very slight off white head that retreats to a layer of bubbles on top.  Lacing is spotty and sporadically travels down the glass edges.  Beautiful, grapefruit forward, sweetness arrives first with other citrus notes following.  Citrus flavors help through the the hop bitterness and the grapefruit really shines on the taste buds.  Decent bodied brew that is sweet and bitter but goes down so smoothly.  I find that I enjoyed this variation more than regular Sculpin, but I am a sucker for grapefruit forward ipas so I'm not surprised."

"Overall, this beer lives up to its reputation as a great IPA. The fruit provides a solid change of pace and cuts what would be a rather strong hops bitterness. In the end, this should please both the hop head and the beer drinker who likes fruit forward beers."
"Didn't really like the regular sculpin but this was great.   They should have just called it oceanspray - grapefruit really came through in a big way - and turned an otherwise good IPA into a great one."
""
"I can enjoy either a refreshing fruity beer or a good IPA, but this combination really didn't do it for me."
"Split this with some coworkers; thoroughly meh, mainly cause I'm not a big fan of the style, but more palatable than previous grapefruit beers and IPAs I've had in the past."
""
"Been waiting to try this one for a while. It does not disappoint. That nose is amazing!   Like a grapefruit in the face. Tastes quite refreshing with a nice hop bite at the end."

"Overall - good IPA that is better than regular Sculpin"

"I much prefer this to regular Sculpin. Very distinct nose and the extra fruity tartness really makes this. Top 10 IPA for me for sure."
""
""
"This beer is the polar opposite of Habanero Sculpin. Whereas Habanero ruins the building block beer to the point where it's basically undrinkable, Grapefruit builds on it to create something truly special. If you can find this stuff fresh, buy it and love your life."
""
"Not a fan of fruit beer but the fruit in this beer is an extension of the hop flavor/aroma. It totally works. Primo"
""
""
""
"I prefer regular sculpin. Chances are if like the slight bitterness of grapefruit then you will love the beer"
"Every time I go to take a sip, I get a waft of grapefruit smell before my lips hit the beer.  Nice."
""
""
"Take a world class citrusy and tropical, stone fruit backed, dry IPA and bury it under grapefruit juice and ruin the head retention. It's still good, but, I dunno, drink some grapefruit juice if this is what you want."
"Deep gold (6) with thin, off white head. Grapefruit nose. Balance between malt foundation and lemon grass and grapefruit flavors. Medium mouthfeel and a little tang on the tip of my tongue. Hard to make a great beer better. Congrats."
""
""
"O: Much better stylized version of Sculpin than the habanero. The grapefruit blended wonderfully with the natural tropical fruit flavors of the hops varieties, and added an extra kick of bitterness. Hats off."
""
"Dark straw to light amber appearance with a thin, full covering, fast breaking white head. Smell is off the charts incredible with pure ruby red grapefruit. There may be other aromas underneath the grapefruit but I can't detect them. Palate showcases a nice amount of citrus including grapefruit and lemon. Finishes clean and crisp with a nice lingering hit of hop bitterness. This is a great beer - I can't wait to try it on a hot summer day. I much prefer it to regular Sculpin."
""
""
"A tad bitter in finish and a tad artificial flavored.  Like some tang was spooned in and stirred."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious.......I can't believe that BP actually improved  Sculpin!!"

"$14.99/six Tulip glass.  Oddly no foam, no lacing, not much head depth. Otherwise fantastic but I found it more subtle than other tasters."

"I love IPAs particularly juicy tropical fruit varieties. So while I had high expectations I'm not a huge regular culpin fan. But I really liked this beer. Not something I would drink more than one of, but truly enjoyable aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"I hope that it's just my palate here. I remember Sculpin as something far tastier than this. If they build a satellite brewery back East, Sculpin might sell better as it will be fresher."
""
""
""
""
"Easily the best ballast point brew...way better than sculpin. Not fruity at all, just uses the grapefruit for the bitterness...genius. So glad this is a year round offering now."
""
""
""
"I love the regular Sculpin but did not like the grapefruit bitterness in this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love regular sculpin, and I'm not sure if this really improves on it.  However, it is still quite tasty and interesting.  The smooth finish is a nice surprise, and this beer is pack with citrus flavor.  Love to see creative twists like this."

"Every bit as good as its brother (Sculpin), but with a nice, refreshing citrus twist."
"Good, but I'd waited for it for a long time and wasn't that taken with it. I thought it would be a ""5" for me and it wasn't. Smells great, though."
""
"Nice looking color.  Suprised that there wasn't an extreme amount of either grapefruit or hop aroma.  The taste was of a fresh grapefruit, not overly bitter.  Maybe lacking just a little hop flavor."
""
"The feel of this beer has a very quenching, juicy feel and is almost a Capri Sun if Capri Sun made a beer. There is a nice medium body that drinks really easy and goes down well and really leaves a sweet juicy flavor in the aftertaste that is as pleasant as the taste of this beer itself."

"Nice clear copper color. Smells of juicy grapefruit and piney hops. Tastes as good as it smells, actually better. Got plenty of grapefruit flavor (and I mean real, juicy, ruby red grapefruit) in perfect balance with a strong IPA base. Smooth feel with character. Overall it is quite fantastic, especially if you're looking for a citrusy IPA."
"Hazy orange amber color with a decent long lasting off white head. Huge citrus and citrus hop notes with a fair amount of bready malt underneath. solid citrus flavor with faint sweet maltiness. Nice twist on a great ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a dream come true"
"This beer is the bomb."
""
""
""

"Nice golden color with good head retention. The arome was a fantastic fresh grapefruit smell. The taste was neither very grapefruity or a nice IPA flavor. Just the bitterness came through. Maybe the grapefruit and hops competed too much. Wanted to love it based on ratings and reviews, but not so great for me."
""
""
"o: The grapefruit appears mainly in a strong aroma, a lot of sharply bitter finishes, and a citrus aftertaste.  Different, but not particularly pleasing to this hophead.  I was hoping the grapefruit would enhance the Sculpin as advertised, but unfortunately I didn't find it so."
""
""
""
""
""
"High B (3.73)"
""
"This is by far one of my favorite beers. Possibly #1"
"Sculpin with a twist. Without reinventing notes from my initial Sculpin review, I'll insert the opinion that I get more bite on the palate, from beginning to end, which can only be attributed to the addition of grapefruit. I also detect a fresh bread characteristic from the malt that adds to the overall balance of the beer.  If you enjoy the original, you should appreciate the variance on this one, too. By incorporating grapefruit, Ballast Point did nothing to diminish the properties that worked with its predecessor. Although the original tasted better the first time I had it, I would be more inclined now to reach for this version as a result of the inevitable palate shift. Like Christopher Cross rocking an Earl Campbell jersey in the late 70's, this IPA has me ""Sailing""."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor profile is world class.  It is reasonably intense, somewhat complex and very well balanced.  It begins with pink grapefruit and slowly takes on an orange under flavor with a touch of mango.  The middle is a mild rind like bitterness with a balancing subtle biscuit sweetness.  The finish is somewhat crisp and a mild grapefruit rind bitterness lingers."
""
"This is a very unique beer. There's not much around I can compare it to. I have had one other IPA that incorporated grapefruit - but I can't quite remember who made it and it wasn't nearly as good as this one is. This is the kind of thing Dogfish Head usually comes up with. The grapefruit flavors are quite strong, yet well-tempered with the other flavors. How strong are they? I could definitely drink this beer at the breakfast table and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it contained 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. Very highly recommended."
"Its medium weighted feel dries wonderfully but also falls flat and still after its creamy-dry body lacks life quickly, again due to the citric acid that chases away the carbonation and head retention. But its deeply resinous bitterness is of pine, but more so of grass, herb and a distinct cannabis afterglow."
""
""
"Too much grapefruit and not enough Sculpin."
"Way too malty for my preference, could've had some age on it, didn't know bottle date."
"Overall - A shame this thing lacks some balls. The aroma had such massive potential, only to be let down by the utter lack of flavor. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but at the price it is, I surely have no desire to buy it again."

"Picked up a six pack of this delicious fruity ipa on a scorching hot spring day in southern California to keep the heat out my body. Dam good beer, definitely up there with BP's victory at sea. Try it, try it, try it!"
"If you haven't tried this, AND you like IPAs AND grapefruit, please try this.  I happen to like both IPAs and grapefruit, and it is a top 10 beer for me.  Perfectly balanced without that artificial fruit flavor your sometimes get from beer/fruit combos.  Try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably a bit past its prime, but an interesting experience.  The fruit juice does push the citrus forward, but it reduces the other hop elements.  The result is an interesting shandy of sorts, but with a definite IPA base.  Tasty.  I'd try again."
""

"Too much artificial grapefruit for me"

"I happen to think it's extraordinary.  I have really enjoyed every ballast point beer I have had so far and this one is out of the park.   The Julian date on the bottle reads 15057.  Pours very clear and orange with a bone white head of foam that held well and left handsome lacing. Nose is so authentic with grapefruit. it's heady with it,  then for perfume it has the scent of fresh orange.  A bit of twiggy and woody pine.    It smells so fresh and tantalizing.  Drinks like a an ocean breeze.  All that tantalizing citrus.  The orange is bright and light. The grapefruit is something wonderful.  It has all the flavor of a real grapefruit but none of the pucker or bitterness of it.   it's like they took all that flavor and sweetened it just enough.  The malt is elusive but a touch sweet with honey and so soft that it simply cascades over your tongue.  Mouthfeel approaches medium but is still wonderfully light with just enough weight from that honey malt to satisfy the palate in a very sensual way.      Right before the swallow is this breezy little spritz from carbonation that is so whimsical it made me laugh out loud.  It's as though you got a little sea mist at the back of your throat.  Perfect crisp finish that brings a little bit of the fruit rind a touch of bitterness to end this amazing beer.  It's  so good."

"Grapefruit hits the nose up front and lingers on the back of the tongue.  Delish."
"Wowsers. Whomever thought to put grapefruit in this world class ipa is a genius. Heady topper with grapefruit???now that would be one hell of a head to head contest. Amazing beer."
""
""
""
"This beer is actually better than the original Sculpin, imho. It has a lighter alcohol punch and a noticeably fruity (grapefruit, of course) base. Look: golden with little retention; smell: grapefruit; taste: grapefruit and hops but without the hop bitterness of the original Sculpin; feel: light and smooth; overall: one of the best IPAs I've ever had!"
""
""
"Big grapefruit and pine smell, with grapefruit juice and grapefruit rind winning the battle. The grapefruit masks most of the bitterness to give the beer a dry, yet robust and fruity finish. Very smooth and the alcohol is hidden. This is a very well-balanced beer."
""
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex IPA. There is a variety of flavors, and I would drink this again in small quantities."
""

"Hand-delivered from the west coast (thanks Mike) - been dying to try this.  12oz. bottle served in a tulip nonic.  Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white head.  Nose expresses bright citrus, candied fruit and a hint of zest.  Flavor profile begins with a light biscuity character, followed by an earthy/herbal dank hops presence and finishing with a hint of sweet citrus and some medicinal notes.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to the light side of the spectrum, with a lively carbonation and a kiss of acidity.  All and all, a great American IPA - well worth the wait."

"Delicious brew. Crisp orange color good head a lacing.let the grapefruit orange flavor roll around  in your mouth and on your tongue. Wonderful.  High price point but high class."
"Crystal-clear, filtered deep golden body with a frothy bone white head. Aroma is of grapefruit zest, citrus, pine, hints of white grape and tropical fruits. Grapefruit comes through way more in the flavor with crisp, tart, fruity grapefruit coming through in a big way. Really amazing how much this tastes like pure grapefruit. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and medium bodied. A great take on an already great IPA. Extremely impressive."

"This particular offering was on my personal bucket list and thought I would never have the chance to enjoy it unless I went to California. Thank you World of Beer Viera Florida. One word says it all for me, Wow ! I am a big fan of West Coast styles of IPA's, if you are a fan of this style and like grapefruit seek this one out. Cheers!"
""
"This was a winner right off of the pour.  It was a nice golden color with a fizzy white head.  As soon as I poured it I caught the aromas of citrus and grapefruit.  The smell was amazing.  The taste was also very clean, citrusy, and hoppy.  The hops and citrus combo on this beer is just about a perfect marriage.  I can see this being one of my summer go to beers from now on.  The grapefruit had a way of making this one of the cleanest feeling beers I have drank.  Very refreshing!"

"Yummy yum yum .. best grapefruit ipa"

"Crisp, bitter, clean, nicely aggressive:) Cheers!"

"Adding actual grapefruit to a beer that already has some big, hoppy, grapefruit flavors, kind of seems like cheating. I was skeptical at first, but after I have had this a few times, I am consistently impressed. This is great."
""

"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Poured a somewhat hazy dark yellow color, with a half inch head that quickly faded to a very thin film. Minimal lacing. The aroma was big grapefruit (as it should be), with some flowery and piney notes.  Just a tinge of malty sweetness in the background. The taste was identical to the smell - huge grapefruit -just awesome!  I got a little sweetness in the finish as well. The body was pretty heavy for an IPA- very nice, with a nice crisp finish and good carbonation on the tongue.  Overall, I like this better than regular Sculpin - damn tasty - wish I could find it as often in CO, ,would buy it all the time!"

"Good.  Had Sculpin and jalepeno before and slightly disappointed with grapefruit due to weird finish .  I still like.  It's almost like I got grapefruit seed sculpin.  Still good but disappointed."

"Half a finger of eggshell white foam, good amount of larger bubbles spread across the surface, below average retention, the lacing is broad but not especially thick. Unblemished, bright liquid of a coppery orange color, the random bubbles are fat and avoid beading. In the nose the citrus has more focus than raw sweetness, pink grapefruit supported by solid tangerine notes, floral with saline and pretzel accents, pineapple, nectarine and peach fruit scents likewise more apt to jab than give you a hug. Full-bodied, more dense than heavy, might benefit from more powerful carbonation. Still manages good crispness and the herbaceousness, pine sap and general savoriness give it more spine. For an element which is ever-present, the grapefruit shows restraint in that it willingly shares the stage. The finish displays the underlying caramel and toffee sweetness, particularly when it warms some. Apricot, peach, pineapple fruit there, again not a fruit-driven experience. As one might expect, and want, the grapefruit outlasts all else. Good drinkability, doesn’t wear you down."
"Smell the aroma and you are hooked."

"O: Not a ton to say about this one. It's sculpin plus a stronger grapefruit aroma/taste. Moreso in the aroma I think. Otherwise, not super bitter or super dry, but plenty bold with hop flavors."
"Overall - Aside from very realistic grapefruit notes in the beginning, this is not much different from regular Sculpin."
"Sculpin was one of the first beers that opened my eyes to what a world class IPA can be and this variation doesn't disappoint. Huge grapefruit flavors mixed with a tropical hop bitterness give this the complexity and drinkability that make it world class."
"The perfect hot day beer. Smell is all grapefruit, taste is all grapefruit (with some sculpin) and it all goes down incredibly smooth. Try to get this guy within 2 months and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed. Really is one of the best beers ever."
"Not a bad beer. But to me the grapefruit was overbearing. I think I'll pass on trying this one again."

"Sculpin is great beer no need for the  grapefruit"
"This is becoming my favorite IPA"
"The flavor is way off for me. More of a strong grapefruit peel flavor rather than grapefruit itself. It was a big miss for me."
"Good beer.  Very strong grapefruit finish.  Really enjoyed it."
"OVERALL: Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!  What else can I say?  This is a grapefruit bomb.  Unlike many other BAs, I'm not going to compare this to the regular Sculpin--which I dearly love--because it's a different beast altogether.  This is a beer for people who love grapefruit juice and citrus, and is meant to fully focus on its grapefruity aspects.  Another great beer from Ballast Point!"
"Grapefruit Sculpin pours a brilliant copper-gold, with a healthy head as white as snow.  Carbonation is moderately strong, and the head retention is excellent, displaying laced remnants of froth as the beer goes down. Absolutely incredible zesty citrus flavors come off the brew after a tentative breath. Quite literally smells like a thirst quenching grapefruit-orange breakfast juice, with some resinous hop elements hiding beneath the surface. A slight whiff of malty booze as well. Certainly seems like my kind of beverage! On to the tasting! Wow, I have to say, this really exceeds my high expectations based on the aroma. I can't believe how natural and fresh the juice aspect is, and how beautifully it is married to the resinous hop flavor. It's not unlike Hopslam actually, in its unique recipe and success in pulling it off. The finish has a nice bitterness to it, that is somewhat harsh and tart. Perfect. The feel of it is nice and light, almost like how you imagine juice to go down really, however, after a full gulp goes down, some warming makes you aware that it is indeed alcohol. Overall, this is sincerely a must try, not some novelty or anything of the sort. I need more!"
""

""
""
"I love this beer, it's like nothing I've tasted before. The grapefruit really mixes with the IPA characteristics. For a beer that I can get regularly, I'd highly recommend."
"Pours a light golden amber with big billowing head. Aroma is a fresh cut grapefruit, sweet honeydew, bright floral hops. The smell is flat out amazing. Taste is very light and refreshing from the start. Not overly bitter but rather sweet to an extent. Notes of grapefruit (obviously), clean and refined hop resin, melon, with only a light bitter after taste. A very clean and fresh feeling IPA that I could drink all day on a hot summer afternoon. Outstanding. Feels like a session IPA despite being 7% abv. I only wish Ballast Point made this year round."
""
""
"Not many aspects of this beer that could be improved. The initial taste of this beer is so incredibly juicy it's seriously one of a kind. A must have. A step up from the original Sculpin, if that's possible."
"I've been a stout/porter/sour drinker for a while now and tend to avoid IPA's. But this beer has renewed my faith. Excellent brew. Probably one of the best I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid"
""
""
"Wow...just awesome...so smooth and refreshing"
"The added grapefruit was noticed predominantly in the smell but not sure it added to an already exceptional IPA. This is an excellent beer because of its roots, not because of added grapefruit."

""
"Really surprised I liked an IPA as much as I did, but this is almost like grapefruit juice with a few fresh hops added. Crisp and refreshing."

"A great summer beer, but hard to pair with food.  I find it similar to the New Zealand Savignon Blancs.  So much citrus/grapefruit, they are delicious but can be troublesome to pair with food."
"I've been waiting awhile to grab this beer! So glad I was finally able to land it! It really is grapefruit in a bottle! I highly recommend this beer!! :)"
""
""
"O - good, but I prefer the regular Sculpin IPA more than this one. Glad to try it."
""
""
"I much prefer the original. Smells great but there is distinct difference between hop citrus and actual grapefruit juice. This tastes more like the latter. Still good but a bit more watered down, less hop flavor and resin."

"i should come right out and say that i prefer the regular sculpin to this one, it just doesnt need that fruit to make it interesting, refreshing, and memorable. that said, i love this edition of it. still crystal clear orangey in color with a bubbly lacy white head with superb retention. the fruit is so authentic, not sweet and sugary and concentrated like some of the shandy to hit the market recently, but true to the fruit, like the fresh juice of it, and it marries up excellently with the hop complexion of the base ipa, which has a lot of bitter citrus to it. the malt here i have always liked, honey malt seemingly, moderately sweet, lighter than medium bodied, but flavorful and fresh without getting into that caramel and darker crystal malt spectrum. it fits the hop profile brilliantly. i am surprised more acid isnt present from the fruit, but the acidity feels about the same as the base beer. cool accent flavor, as its real refreshing and not overly done. it also was one of the first ipa styles i have had my girlfriends parents actually like, so this was a hit in a number of crowds for us. my only critique really is that i cant buy this on the regular. nice brew, best use of grapefruit i have seen in an ipa, but i will take a sixer of regular sculpin still."
"Very well executed.  Much better than a typical shandy or radler."

"O - It's my first time drinking this and it is really good. Not as grapefruity as I thought it would be, which is nice because it does not become a flavored beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a let down. It was a little flat and watery. Hops were gone. Its clearly faded. I got this as an extra in a trade and I don't think it was fresh. It can't be that old because I don't think the beer came out that long ago. Wish there was a date on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn good beer.  I would be interested in seeing what bottle conditioning with some yeast could do to it, but as far as a west coast IPA goes this one is hard to top.  Absolute MUST TRY!"
""
"Expensive but well worth it, not something I would drink all the time as the grapefruit would get cloying but I enjoyed it."
"OVerall:  I purchased a bottle of Grapefruit Sculpin IPA for $5.99  USD in Glendale, CA/USA.  People who enjoy both grapefruit and IPA beer will enjoy Grapefruit Sculpin IPA."
""
""
"Awesome beer. Prefer over the normal sculpin, although it is hard to find."
""
""
"O: Overall the debate will go on, my preference sticks with the regular sculpin, even with an intense love affair with grapefruity hop beers. Hoppy forward but falls a bit when compared to sculpin. For disclosure im not really a fan of beers on tap, this one seems to suffer from its lack of carbonation that makes the flavor/hops  pop and pales in comparison to sculpin ipa  in bottle. If i get a chance to re-evaluate in bottle form i will adjust accordingly, but as of now, on tap, doesn't warrant an outstanding numerical value on any aspect."
""
"Full disclosure: Avid fan of the traditional Sculpin, and was highly doubtful you could improve upon that beer. All things considered, though, this variation manages to be incredibly excellent while also not taking away from the original. The grapefruit finish is not overbearing and complements (instead of taking over) the flavor profile that's already there. Instead of being ""Sculpin with some grapefruit," it's its own standalone beer. Too excellent and among the more interesting variations around."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is quite possibly the most refreshing beer I have ever had.  The way the citrus and hops come together is perfect."
""
"Mouthfeel is good.  It's a hard medium bodied beer with a nice long lingering flavor.  There's a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with just the right amount of acidity.  There's nice sweetness upfront, followed by some citrus bitterness, some acidity, and follows off with a nice dry bitter finish.  Really good all around beer.  I wouldn't drink it every day , but it's really enjoyable and has good drinkablity.  It's an IPA to kind of savor in my opinion and the grapefruit helps with that."
"I'm not a huge grapefruit guy but this was delicious. All of the ingredients work really well together. Found a single bottle of this for $2.99 and it was worth it. Another winner from Ballast Point."
""
"Delicious offering by Ballast Point. A must try for all hop heads. Especially those who love a biting citrus hop presence."
""
"Very grapefruit. First taste was best."

"This is interesting because the sum of the parts is greater than the overall impression.  I like the pieces quite a bit, but I don't love the beer.  I like it,  I even like it quite a bit.  But it's not something I'd tell everyone they need to try. Weird but true."
""
"Sure, there's booze in this and it could be felt by the time I polished this off but after savoring this, how could I not have another? I'm not a huge fan of adding flavors to beer but this was one of the few exceptions to that case as the grapefuit strongly enhanced the original version of this while complementing it perfectly. IPA's are a dime a dozen (as I always say) but hopheads and aficionados of quality brews would be wise to seek this out and pay the premium for this. This beer's certainly worth the praise and hype it's received."

"After being slightly disappointed by the Habanero Sculpin, the Grapefruit Sculpin was a great surprise. I could see some saying the grapefruit comes on too strong in this one, but I love it. A great twist on the already great Sculpin. Will definitely hoping to come across more of this in the future."

"Delicious grapefruit and hops blend! Very refreshing with its grapefruit finish."
""
""
"A very good beer, but prefer the regular Sculpin IPA.  Slightly sour grapefruit taste."
""
""
""
"World class, if you can, drink this, hoard this..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly resinous, a little still. Overall, good beer. I'd have to try it side by side with standard Sculpin to know which one I really prefer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good brew.  Not earth-shattering like I thought it would be....but then again, I'm still wishing Sculpin was the amazing first sip monster I discovered back in 2010.  Something changed and I don't know why.  But alas...this is a solid addition to the Sculpin variations and worth finding and enjoying."

"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent amber color with an inch of frothy white head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is grapefruit with some citrus and tropical fruit hops. Mango, orange, lemon and lime. The taste is grapefruit, lemon and lime upfront followed by some grainy malts. Finishes with more grapefruit and the lemon and lime. Very citrusy, and not just from the grapefruit although it is the main flavor. Light, oily mouthfeel. Overall, really good variant to Sculpin. My only gripe is I seem to not just get grapefruit but more of the lemon/like."
""
""
""
""
"Decent enough, glad I got a 6 of it"
""
""
"Overall: A nice IPA with nice drinkability. Notable for the fact that the flavors complement each other and lend to the style rather than detract. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really delicious, surprising beer. Most beers that advertise in their name a certain fruit or flavor go overboard on it and create something gimmicky and not all that great. This one lives up to the name, but subtly and deliciously."
"Nice variant of the original sculpin.  I was concerned this would be close to a radler sweetness, but no just the original Sculpin with a grapefruit nose and bitter aftertaste (no additional sweetness)."
""
"This is far worse than regular sculpin"
"Amazing! Aroma and taste had heightened grapefruit as I was hoping."
""
""
""
"Overall, a classic example of the sculpin ipa line. Good smell and appearance, but the flavor just doesn't keep up. I am not sure what I am missing here, but I expected more intense flavor from this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The fresh aroma of grapefruit peel remains assertive when tasted, though it leaves room for the IPA's hops blend to support it. Great malt balance. This beer would do well in flights, as I wanted a different style after having two of these."
""
""
"great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste of this beer just doesn't do it for me. Kinda reminds me of sprite and soap. Regular sculpin is much better."
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer. Had in bottle and I will buy again for sure"
""
"Great beer. Just wish they would tone down the grapefruit a little, because it's all  you can taste after a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict 4.25/5 . I really like this beer , but I would love a fuller body on this and not filtered out . Maybe change this into a double IPA in the future ? Still a great beer for hop heads like myself . Cheers !"
""
"Overall- A great beer with a lot of hype. Worth seeking and finding when its available and definitely worth the price, particularly considering the multitude of inferior brews for similar pricing. I'm not the biggest fan of the regular sculpin, although I've only had it once, but now I am interested in revisiting it. Will be getting this next time I see it and hope it becomes more available soon."

"O-  yep, I'll be having this again.  Sculpin is very good on it's own, but this is better."

""

"O - An excellent beer worth seeking out."
"Smell was amazing. First thing to really say about this beer. Didn't know I believed in the hype but boy I was wrong. An absolute perfectly balanced beer. Me being not a big fan of grapefruit I enjoyed ever last sip of it. Most grapefruit ipa are either way to bitter or taste to much like a hopped up shandy. But this beer is fantastic. Highly recommend"

"Bottled Feb 27 ....... 9 days old.. Straight Grapefruit once you let this beer warm up a little, Amazing..... the 7% isn't present... its all hops/grapefruit with a nice medium carbonation and medium/low malt presence, in VA its 16.99 for a 6-pack steep but I would purchase this year long if made available............. BALLAST POINT GET ON IT!!!!!!!!"
""
""
"Delicious taste, aroma, perfect clarity.  This is a legitimately great beer, and ridiculously easy to drink.  But as an IPA it is still more of a gimmick than something I could see myself coming back to again and again.  But is that just my prejudice against fruit beer talking, or is this actually too much of a gimmick to maintain my sustained interest?  Better buy a case and see how long it takes me to get through it."
"(12oz bottle) Every bit as good as when I had it on tap a few weeks back. The boosted grapefruit flavors works so well with the hops. Goes down almost too smoothly. One superb beer."
""
""
"Overall: An absolutely magnificent beer. Extraordinarily drinkable. The grapefruit is not gimmicky here- it's present, but at appropriate levels compared to the rest of the elements in this beer. I was struck by the way the smell opened with a fresh cut grapefruit and intense citrus hoppiness and the taste moved from citrus/herbal hops to a slight bitterness. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Similar as the original Sculpin IPA but with more grapefruit (and bitter). Delicious but I'm satisfied with the original."
""
""
""
"Deep orange color with a big white head and tons of sticky lacing.  Aroma is a wallop of grapefruit right to the olfactory.  I mean it's deep with grapefruit aromas.  Some light sweetness from the malt but the aromas are a bit one dimensional.  Taste is much the same with a big citrusy grapefruit profile.  Juicy grapefruit pulp, rind and pith with a touch of sweetness.  Prickly up front carbonation carries through a bitter and semi dry finish.  If I think of this as an IPA I appreciate it less as I feel the flavor comes from flavors not added by the hops.  If I don't think about that I think it's pretty good at what it sets out to do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow this is better than the normal sculpin. This is everything great about a WIPA. Subtle notes of grapefruit really mellow out the alcohol and compliment the backbone. Just a beautiful IPA. My favorite from them. 5/5 for me."
""
""
""
"There's been a lot of hype in the beer community about this one, and I've gotta say, I don't really get it. It's a fine tasting IPA - citrusy, but I'm not getting a ton of grapefruit. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but a rating of 96 needs to offer something a little bit more unique. Wasn't blown away by this one."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. I had hoped that it did not have any grapefruit in it. I hoped for a Amarillo, CTZ front forward beer than smell like grapefruit. The grapefruit works really well, in fact I think this beer would be more interesting if the grapefruit was not advertised. Also, impressed by how fresh this sample is, NJ is all stretch from SD,CA."
""
""
""
"Almost as good and sculpin.  The grapefruit adds a very nice citrus flavor and odor."
"Wave of cloying fruit, but dominated by dry citric acid like biting into a grapefruit peel"
"Pretty good but a tad artificial tasting. Great smell for sure. Could not drink more than one or two."
"The smell of the beer is amazing, loads of grapefruits and citrus."

"Great great great beer, not much else has to be said!"
"O: The grapefruit addition really asserts itself, to the point that it masks all the complexity and greatness of sculpin. So it definitely feels dumbed-down in that regard. If you're a sculpin purist, you will probably gripe about this. However, we are still left with a very tasty and crushable beer. If you love yourself some grapefruit or are just looking for a hedonistic drinking experience, this is very good stuff."
""
""
""
"I guess I'm just not that much into grapefruit in my IPA's. Solid beer though."
""
""
"Bottom Line: Good Brew!"
""
""
""
"Clear golden amber in color with white head.  If a friend blindfolded me and then held this beer up to my nose, I would tell him to cut me a piece of that grapefruit.  What a great smell for a beer!  Since a lot of hop varieties already produce grapefruit-y aromas naturally, I would consider the use of actual grapefruit in the brewing process to be a bit adulterous, but in this instance, I don't give a %#%^.  This is too delicious and enjoyable.  I consider standard sculpin' to be the bee's knees but from now on, if available, 10/10, I'm going for the grapefruit."
""
""
"I knew that it was gonna be good, but I honestly have to say that this is the absolute best beer that I've ever randomly picked up without actively seeking it out."
"A quite good beer, but a bit sweeter than I was expecting.  Definitely a beer to grab once in a while."
""
"I'll bet this beer is a 5 in the middle of a golf course in July"
""
""
""
""
"Taste:  Up front a sweet grapefruit flavor hits, which is complimented by the ""juiciness"" (for lack of a better work) of the hops.  On the backend, you get the distinct bitter taste of a grapefruit, which I love.  Note I am both a grapefruit and IPA person (I always toyed around the idea of making a amarillo/cascade IPA with actual grapefruit); this is one of the best IPAs I have tasted so far. IMHO, the grapefruit is a perfect compliment to the juicy/bitter nature of IPAs."
""
""
""
"They took my favorite IPA and somehow made it better.  I'll have to compare them side by side but wow this is something amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional beer.. A must try for an IPA lover"
"Delicious  and to be savored till the last drop..."
"Overall: Grapefruit Sculpin is pretty nice IPA, it has impressive balance that makes it drink like a DIPA. This beer is a pretty tasty hoppy beer, but if it tastes and good as it smells that would be awesome.  No flaws that I can find in the DIPA. Pretty tasty stuff by ballast point.  The grapefruit flavor and aroma are pretty authentic in this IPA."
""
"I don't want this thing to end. Ever."
"This is fantastic.  This is Sculpin taken up a few.  The juicy grapefruit hits you from the get go and sticks with you to the bitter end."
""
""
""
""
"A+. Great variation of a great beer."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs, much better than standard Sculpin and waaayyy better than the Habenero version"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great tasting IPA from Ballast point, super well balanced, taste like regular sculpin IPA, with more notes of grapefruit, cant really go wrong in that sense of the matter."
""
""
"I may be one of the only people who absolutely hated this beer.  All about the taste, it is just too overwhelming of grapefruit floral taste.  Seems perfumy in taste.  Mouthfeel and look are nice like regular sculpin and the grapefruit smell us nice.  Could use more citrus and tart taste from the grapefruit and less fruit/floral."
"If you're a die-hard fan of funky/floral IPAs, this may not be for you. If you straddle both sides though or tend to favor fruit on the palate, I can't recommend this highly enough."
""
""
""
"Outstanding fruit beer.  The Grapefruit was up-front and in your face.  Excellent for a change of pace from ordinary IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Will have to say this is the better of the 2 Sculpin spinoffs.  Nice fresh grapefruit compliment this beer really well and make it very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm extremely disappointed in this, I thorughly enjoy Sculpin and even the habanero variation.  But, this just doesn't taste like it should.  I would have just upped the grapefruity hops instead of whatever was added to get this flavor."
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to like this more, but lets be honest here, it is Sculplin with grapefruit added...I love love love Sculpin, and Sculpin with grapefruit is nice.  And as much as I enjoyed it, I almost felt like I was dupped.  Kind of like when Tide went to 'special ultra fantastic' tide with added specialness...It was probably still Tide, but marketing and packaging wanted to make a case for a change that I was not convinced was there.  Is this a good beer, yes, will I be disappointed when they discontinue it and just stick to Sculpin, not completely.  Try and it and see."
""
""
"Ugh, why am I not totally wild about this beer? Pours a nice copper color, lacing was pretty but the head was a little light. The flavor is definitely grapefruit forward and it had a hoppy kick in the end. I tried to picture myself sipping this down the shore vs in the midst of another snowstorm, it helped. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Clear golden orange color with a white head and thick lacing. Grapefruit and fresh cut grass dominate the aroma.  Lighter taste than the aroma suggests, with grapefruit up front, hop bitterness at the end, and a not much of a backbone.  It's good, but there are plenty of other IPAs out there that profile specific flavors just as well or better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wish there was a bit more grapefruit flavor.  It mixed in too well with the hops."
""
"Gratz Ballast. Love this one."

""
""
"Great beer, nice change to a great ipa!"
""
""
""
"Purchased a 64oz growler from Whole Foods. Pours a nice copper-orange with a velvety head. The smell is heavy fresh grapefruit. It's incredible. Taste is more of that delicious grapefruit juice and all the normal awesomeness of Sculpin. This is liquid heaven. So very glad I was able to get this and will go after it again. Excellent job, Ballast Point!"
""

"If you like Grapefruit, you're gonna love this brew! I'm really glad it has been added to Ballast Points roster in GA."

"I think comparisons are appropriate here and as a Sculpin enthusiast it is unavoidable. The grapefruit flavor here is just amazing but I do think it takes away from the classic Sculpin hops just a bit and the added bitterness clashes at times. That being said this might be the best, freshest feeling citrus flavor I have had in a beer and the aroma is astoundingly well done."
""
"Overall a well-balanced and delicious IPA. Maybe a bit too easy to drink as the first two are gone before I was even done this review. :)"

"Just had Pliny last night for the first time now Grapefruit Sculpin for the first time and I have to say aside from appearance, Grapefruit Sculpin has the upper hand. The flavor profile just dominates. Delicious."
""
""
"A perfect IPA. The original is amazing, but they have improved upon perfection. Bringing in actual grapefruit to accentuate the already, over the top, hop aroma is genius. What is left to be said? Amazing orange, slightly hazy appearance. Smell is malt and uhhhh, grapefruit! Taste is a sweet and bitter grapefruit hop bomb with a solid malt backbone. Some piney notes as well. Perfect mouthfeel. Very chewy and full. It's a perfect IPA in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  I like grapefruits so this beer was great.  Aroma and taste is all grapefruit.  Sculpin is already a great IPA so varieties are just as good."
"overall: this is dangerously tasty. you could drink a whole bunch and that 7abv would sneak up on you. , only reason i didn't rate it higher was because i feel like the grapefruit is the big reason i like it so much. finishes off just like regular sculpin."
""
"Serving type: On tap"

"4.25/5: One of the benchmarks for fruited IPAs"

"Wow, very impressed. Best west coaster I've had to date. Really enjoy this. Fruit forward, tons of citrus and a remarkable nose on it. Incredibly easy to crush too"
""
""
"I don't even think actual grapefruit juice smells this much like grapefruits. It's incredible."
""
"Delicious, easily the most juicy, citrusy ipa I've had."
"The grapefruit addition just dominates which is a plus and a minus. Can't argue with delicious though."
"A nice beer, but IMHO, regular sculpin doesn't need this sort of modification and/or enhancement. I'll stick with the original I think."
"Love fresh sculpin, the grapefruit flavor (lots in aftertaste) did not make this better, stick to the original"
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottle. Went down ok, but tasted like someone took a regular Sculpin and squirted grapefruit Mio into it or something. Grapefruit flavor did not taste natural. Still not a bad beer for a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew just took an already excellent beer and made it that much better. The Grapefruit Sculpin has such an enjoyable freshness to it, a great IPA to trick in the sun while doing yard work, or practicing your shot"

""
""
""

""
""
"After having liking but not loving Sculpin, I was excited to snare a few bottles of the Grapefruit version. It was hoppy, tangy and refreshing. My guess is that after a few of these, the grapefruit would get to be a little too much so maybe it's good that this beer is fairly limited! This was a solid beer."

"Overall, was not dissapointed. Clear to see why this is such a sought after beer. Definetly worthy of a 95+ rating."
"Bottle. Grapefruit Sculpin is clear, brig orange with a fluffy, bountiful head. Plenty of lacing. A powerful grapefruit aroma. Not just grapefruity hops, more grapefruit juice. Almost too grapefruity for me to believe it's not artificially flavored. Also smells slightly bready. If I smelled this without knowing what it was, I would not think it was Sculpin. Flavor is also dominated by grapefruit juice. I think regular Sculpin is very tropical fruit hoppy. This is not much like it. Grapefruit juice with grapefruit hops solely. I can tell the hops are citru buying to the flavor because the finish is very bitter. The lightest malt profile. Bitter finish. Medium bodied. Crisp carbonation. Not much like the OG original Hopfish. I'm skeptical because I feel as though this brew is using artificial flavoring for such a concentrated grapefruit flavor. Regardless, it's pretty yummy."
"Damn near perfect beer.  Huge citrus and floral notes.  An all day and warm weather beer for sure.  I would love to see this in a double or imperial IPA format."
""
"Good beer. Way too much carbonation but otherwise pretty good."

"The reviews confuse me.  Some people don't get much grapefruit while others say it smacks you in the face.  I'm in the second group.  The smell and taste are all grapefruit.  Now, this is what I asked for with this beer and that's what it delivers!  I've never gotten grapefruit taste from other IPAs, just the general citrus flavor.  This one is pure grapefruit juice!"
""
""
""
"One of the better IPA's that I've tried."
""

"Well balanced and great flavor.  Some bottles have more or less grapefruit flavors though.  Love this one"

"Reminds me of Fresca with a nice malt backbone, would crush this on a summer day.. Cans soon ?"
"if you mixed a bottle of this and a bottle of the regular sculpin together you would have a great beer! lol. too much grapefruit in this one for me, overpowering and taking away from the original"

"Strong grapefruit smell. Solid IPA. Found at Flying Saucers."
""
"Nice golden-orange color with awesome head and lacing that clings and holds on for dear life. Had this last night and I was not disappointed. This beer is so grapefruit forward that it is insane. The malt, hops and citrus come together so well, one of my all-time favorites !!"
""
"Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, bright, vibrant, orange-gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, off-white head that slowly recedes into a surface coating, leaving a decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit all over the nose, with a backbone of subtle cracker, and a bold ribbon of hops resin. Very inviting for a hophead. Flavors are very balanced, with a tart and sweet grapefruit character forward, with some more subtle citrus notes blending in the background, all on a roasted caramel and cracker backbone. The hops characteristics come through towards the end of the palate, with a sticky bitterness of pine pitch, moss, and cut grass. Very balanced, all on a smooth, lightly effervesced body. The aftertaste is much more hop heavy, with the resinous notes really taking the main stage, and the grapefruit stepping back into a supporting role. The finish is dry and sticky with the lingering hops dankness. This is a truly fantastic beer!"
"If you like grapefruit then you will like this. Almost covers all other hops, but the rind taste is fresh fresh."

"12 oz bottle. Just delivered to my store today. Bitter and hoppy citrus. There is a nice grapefruit citrus that isn’t there initially but builds. I’m most impressed by the fact that the grapefruit doesn’t seem to be added, the bitter citrus is definitely there, but is so well blended with the hops that I wouldn’t have thought it was added."

"Very similar to regular Sculpin with just a touch of grapefruit to compliment."

"Just a great brew if you like grapefruit, and maybe even if you don't since they synergize so well."

"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, fairly refreshing, bitterness doesn't linger too much."

"Perfect marriage of bitter citrus and citrusy hops"
""
""

"This is like sculpin on steroids. The sculpin is a bit muted while grapefruit is thrust to the forefront. It has large ruby red grapefruit goodness. It has a rich flavor of fleshy grapefruit without being too bitter or sweet. At times the big flavor is a bit obnoxious, but it is definitely delicious."

"O: Very, very interesting. Not sure I'd want to have more than 1 or 2 in a sitting, however, as I like my beers to taste like beer, and the grapefruit really predominates.  But overall this is really good."
"A really delicious ipa. A little surprised of the super high scores it's getting. Seems to have an artificial grapefruit flavor going on. Honestly, it reminds me of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Like if they hopped up Sunset Wheat or something. I like both beers really."
""
"The beer pours a clear light golden amber with a loose white head. The nose is straight grapefruit candy, we're talking izze grapefruit soda level of grapefruit penetration. However, the taste brings in more grain flavor and a bitter hoppy bite to balance out the grapefruit soda-like sweetness. This is very drinkable, raddler-on-steriods kind of, but well carbonated and has a modest bitterness. I definitely enjoyed this more than expected, kinda sad that I passed on it so many times previously."

"This delivers to what it claims to be. If you don't like grapefruit flavor in a beer, stay away! While this isn't my go to everyday IPA, this is fun and delicious! I would love to see this consistently. I would definitely rotate this into my line-up. I would pair this with old-fashioned fruit cake. The sweetness of the cake would help off-set the bitterness of the beer and grapefruit and any fruit in the cake would pair with the flavors of the beer. Another great option would be the Indian dish chicken tikki masala. Would love a little more carbonation to get it an even higher rating. It gets a 96.6 from me."

"I've been trying to get my hands on this for AWHILE now and was worried I would be let down considering the hype I had built up in my own mind behind it.  I was WRONG!  This beer is amazing.  The aroma is fantastic.  Nice citrusy finish but not overly so.  Perfect balance.  And mine was bottled 5 weeks ago.  I can only imagine how it tastes super fresh.  Highly recommended."

"O – Another great offering from Ballast Point, the grapefruit does however come off almost artificially strong on the nose. Thankfully it subsides and leads to a great drinking beer, nicely done. – 4.25"
"Very drinkable.  I could easily have a few of these in the same sitting."

"On tap at Al’s of Hampden. Pour is transparent golden yellow with a bubbly off white head. Nose has a fair bit of lemon pledge, faint grapefruit, a touch of soapy hop. Taste follows suit, tons of lemon pledge, very light bitterness, grapefruit tones in the finish. Bitterness picks up through the finish. Light bodied, moderate carb."

"Totally exceptional. Grabbed a sizer from bottleworks in seattle last week. Poured into my spiegleau glass. The aroma here is unbelievable. Gold, and orange in color with a light head. The flavor good be a little more bold but very good still. Grab some if you this. Yum!"
"Interesting twist on Sculpin. Strong grapefruit aroma. Not as much grapefruit in the taste as I had hoped for, but certainly present. Solid beer."
"Overall, an excellent beer, if I were a bigger fan of grapefruit in general I would have scored this higher."

"O:  I thought I could not love more than regular Sculpin.......I was wrong.  This beer is better in every way.  One reviewer noted how sippable it was......I totally disagree.  This beer is poundable and drinkable.........more so than it should be for 7%.  Having one only warms you up to really enjoy that second one.  After that they still go down oh so easily, but be wary of buzz.  This beer has firmly planted itself on the top of my favorites list......and that's hard to do, but it has.  Sheerly incredible."

"If you do like Sculpin and grapefruit however, you'd probably really enjoy."
""
""
""
""

"Verdict: A delicious take on Sculpin, which was already one of my favorite IPAs out there, the grapefruit is so prominent, yet it doesn't completely overtake the beer. Juicy, tangy, bitter and bursting with citrus, perfect for any hop head."
"The perfect summertime beer, too bad it's February right now."
""

"A great IPA in it's base Sculpin format. The grapefruit version is definitely a treat but not something I would search for."

"Grapefruit. Love the grapefruit. Love the Sculpin. This is really well done."

"Drank it fresh within just a few weeks of being bottled. It's super refreshing, a dry finish with plenty of bite. If you like the taste of grapefruit, this is a choice beer. If not, maybe still worth a try. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. Great summer beer if you like IPAs because it's not as malty or heavy."
"If you're like me and pull this app up while standing IN a liquor store trying to figure out what to buy, buy this beer! Grapefruit citrus dominates throughout, but also a gentle sweetness and a delicious malty dryness. Oh and hops, to lesser extent. This will definitely be my summer go to beer."
"Classic West Coast IPA look due to a clear, pale amber body and small, one finger thick, head.  The smell was very clearly highly laden with grapefruit, and the citrus just dominated the nose.  There were also hints of pine in the background of the smell.  The taste had citric, sour, and tart grapefruit flavors up front and center, with a hop bitterness providing a second potent punch.  Some sweet hard candy sugar poking through here and there.  Medium thin and slippery on the palette, this beer was easy to drink.  Alcohol was completely hidden, and the beer was very quenching.  I was thinking this was going to be just a regular IPA with hint of grapefruit, but this was so much more."
"sculpin with a persistent grapefruit rind finish, which anchors the whole product brilliantly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, well I'm mixed, as much as I love grapefruit, I also love Sculpin and I'm a little perturbed that the nose had pretty much none of it. The flavor was a bit better but still overpowered too much by the grapefruit and especially the rind on the back end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you are looking for sculpin with a hint of grapefruit then you might be displeased. This almost isn't even a beer halfway through the glass I say, it turned into straight grapefruit juice with maybe a hint of hop bite if any, very subtle. The aroma is amazing. I prefer the regular to this but it is tasty if you want grapefruit juice and not a beer."
""
""
""
"A very good idea and one that I like."
""
""
"Regular is solid and is with grapefruit as well worth a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Was nervous Ballast Point was fiddling with a VERY GOOD thing, but the extra hint and tartness of the grapefruit really works well.  Still an outstanding beer."
""
""
"Wow, what an eccentric beer, in a good way!  You need to be a grapefruit fan to enjoy it, however. The grapefruit flavor is perfectly strong.  It leaves an aftertaste that tastes like grapefruit peel. But it works! Leaves very little lacing on glass.  The smell is wonderfully, well, ""grapefruity"". There seems to be a theme here..."
"Poured a dull brass with a thinner white head atop.Obviously grapefruit in the nose but not overly sharp,some toasted grain is there as well.Not overly bitter and/or sharp on the palate just fresh and juicy frutiness from the grapefruit with a surprising toasted bready malty base.Love this beer,again not overly bitter but fresh and very drinkable for the size."
"Wow. Fresh grapefruit aroma and taste with slight sweetness at the end."
""
"Grapefruit is noticeable but not overwhelming"
""
""
"I find Balast Point's Sculpin IPA to be a bit too piney and dry for my palate, but the addition of grapefruit in this version really seemed to mellow out some of the base beer's pithy bitterness. While adding fruit juice to an already solid IPA might seem a bit hokey, in this case it created a really interesting and drinkable beer. I would love to have easy access to this when summer rolls around."
""
""
"Wow! The taste is the least bit bitter. The citrus makes a great taste. Best IPA hands down!"
"sculpin with a straight grapefruit juice, too much candied grapefruit for me, tastes a little artificial.  Would be nice on a hot sunny day, but I'll stick with the regular sculpin."
""
""
"That being said, It is NOT world-class..."

"Grapefruit in this beer is very potent... Solid beer.."
"12 oz bottle pour.  Great lacing and retention sticking to glass.  Smells of fresh ruby red grapefruit and hops.  Taste the bitter hop and citrusy grapefruit marrying together nicely!  Delicious!  I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty disappointing especially with so many exceptional reviews on BA. I just felt the grapefruit addition was too much of a hammer -- more subtlety to let the excellent base beer with all its hop nuances bust through and be enhanced rather than overshadowed by the hefty grapefruit juice character."
""
"Looks great, smells great...that's about it.  I've tried the Sculpins many times, draught, cans, bottles...I don't understand the ratings.  Overly bitter and one dimensional, not much going on.  Maybe it's better super fresh out in San Diego, but this isn't even close to as good as the best IPA's out there, never mind beyond outstanding."
""
"I love the regular Sculpin so when I saw the Grapefruit Sculpin, I had the buy a six pack. I'm glad I did, as this is delicious. A must try for the IPA fans who also enjoy the taste of grapefruit. I poured this into a Belgian Tulip glass for review. Small white head with generous sticky lacing. The aroma is outstanding. Initial blast of sweet grapefruit, followed by citrus hops. Great blend of grapefruit with a classic west coast IPA. Another well done beer by Ballast Point..."
"It's just damn tasty stuff. Grapefruit is forward but not to the point of being gimmicky. Beautifully blended with the rest of the beer. Highly recommended!"
"Overall an excellent SoCal IPA."
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic IPA and well worth its reputation and cost. The mix of flavors works very well and is something that Ballast Point should be very proud of. I highly recommend picking up a full six pack of this if you can."
""
""
"Overall: massively drinkable and very very tasty.  Love it."
""
""
"Spectacular IPA, perfect combo of grapefruit and grapefruit tasting hops. Taste buds will confused by two. And it still has the San Diego feel too.  I've done a similar one myself, and this is exactly how I wanted it to be."

"Ballast Point does it right.  Back when this was a rare, draft-only beer, its scored were huge.  Lesser, hype-ier breweries would have kept it rare, fearing the drop in acclaim that accompanies accessibility.  BP listened to the people, however, and gave this wonderful brew the full release it deserves."

"Really refreshing and surprising American IPA. Upon you first taste you get a strong citrus grapefruit taste that seems like it could carry through, but it blends and finishes with a crisp hop flavor at the end. Overall excellent beer."
""
""
"The bottles say that both of these offerings clock in at 7% abv, but I’d guess that the Grapefruit version was a little lower based solely on the taste.  I could drink too many of these on a hot summer day."
"Overall, I think I enjoy this more than the regular Sculpin… which is saying something because I'm not the biggest fan of grapefruit. For some reason, this beer makes grapefruit that much more enjoyable. Extremely drinkable; like a cocktail."
""
"Overall- A very interesting fruit infused IPA. Well done all the wat through. Grapefruit notes often show up in beers but this time it is actually the real deal. A must try if you can find it!"
""
"Pours clear light amber, mostly golden in color with a good frothy white head that has great retention. Smell is dominated by fresh crisp aromas of grapefruit. More citrus, apricot and peach notes meld with the dominate grapefruit for a fruit bomb if a nose. Taste has a good hop flavor of reminicant of apriocots, blood orange and semi sweet grapefruit work nicely with a moderate sweetness light bitterness and dry pith feel to create an all around nicely balanced fruity ipa."

"holy grapefruit batman! Sculpin wins again"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't decide whether I like this more or less than regular Sculpin, but it's a nice twist. The grapefruit isn't too prominent, and just lends a little fruity acid zest to the beer. Perhaps a little more refreshing than Sculpin, not quite as good from a pure hoppy perspective? Either way, if you like regular Sculpin, I highly recommend giving this a shot; compulsively drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love grapefruit and thought that the natural flavors would compliment Sculpin's hop profile nicely.  For some reason this doesn't quite work for me. The grapefruit comes across as overly sweet and a bit artificial.  Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"  PS...I love grapefruit"
"Like candied grapefruit Sculpin, this is amazing. I would drink this 9 times out of 10 over regular Sculpin, and I love that too. Halfway between copper & orange with a gigantic off-white fizzy head, and nice lacing to follow. Nose is dominated by the candied grapefruit, but there are other tropical fruits back there too. Amazingly fruity flavor profile, more of that juicy, candied grapefruit on top of the Sculpin we all know & love. Not as aggressively-hopped, but very much in balance. Lip-smacking good."
""
"Overall: I like this, but too much of a good thing can equal a bad thing. While I enjoy regular Sculpin I feel brewing this with Grapefruit is ruining a good thing. Now if they were to double Dry Hop this with say...Citra, then I might be a bigger fan. They nailed what I believe they intended this beer to be, just too much grapefruit that cancels some of the hops that make Sculpin what it is. All in all this brew is Worthy!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Must have for fans of grapefruit or citrusy IPAs.  Since I am one such individual, I agree this may well be better than sculpin."

"O- this is a summer drink a grapefruit shandy it is drinkable but i prefer regular Sculpin this is worth a try and i will still buy it from time to time but its just not my style as it was to artificial tasting"

""
""
""
"Postscript - I bought two of these, and enjoyed my second drinking much more, so I raised the taste and overall ratings slightly to account for maybe not being in the right mood on first drinking."

"Big Sculpin fan but have not had yet in 2015. Picked up 3 bottles of Sculpin reg, grapefruit and jalapeño. Will be interesting to try all 3, but orig is very good. Will try not to be influenced by previous but I think that will be hard to do... Started with gf and it absolutely is (grapefruit) from start to finish. Aroma is nice and strong gf but more sweet and florally than bitter. Big foam that quickly settled to a good layer. Seems easier drinking than the reg Sculpin, milder hops that allows the gf flavor to come through. Obvious well made beer like a 2 hearted, super smooth bringing out the intended flavor(s). The aroma remains strong while drinking, as I was drinking from a tulip glass, and leads right into the mouth with the same flavor. The sweet gf fades and you are left with a (good) bitter taste, more gf than hops. I liked that the gf was imparted well but it def overwhelms any hop flavor. You need to have an open mind in this one to enjoy. I would drink again but prob not buy more than one at a time."
""
""
"For me this tastes a little fake, like fruity pebbles or fresca. Still tasty of course I'm just not sure how only real fruit would make this insanely sweet fruity in an almost chemical way. Definitely still drinking it but it's not as great to me as some think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is similar to the original Sculpin, however the balance between pine and citrus has been tilted way to the favor of the citrus, which is not a bad thing.  Very good IPA, will try again."

"Overall:  I'm not as blown away by this as I thought I would be, but still a delicious IPA.  I picked up a bottle of regular Sculpin to do a side by side."
"Smells like a blend of grapefruit and fresh cut squash (butternut or acorn), so not exactly a pleasant smell.  Taste follows the smell, squash flavor present, a bit of IPA somewhere in there.  Not sure if I have a bad batch, but this is not good."

"Was excited to try this beer. Regular Sculpin I love. Grapefruits I love. Grapefruit rind? Not so much. And that's what this beer tastes like. Disappointed."

"This beer was absolutely killer. Hop-forward Sculpin taste up front, followed by a massive wave of citrus. Seriously tasted like drinking fresh grapefruit juice. Amazingly refreshing and a must-buy if you can find it fresh. Will be seeking this one out again for sure."
"Personally, I find sculpin to be one my favorite ipas. That being said I was extremely excited to try this variation. Overall a very nice beer. The only negative I noticed was that at times the grapefruit overwhelmed everything else instead of complimenting it. However, I still found this to be a delicious beer that I'm glad I got to try."

"Medium bodied with above average carbonation. Finishes dry with a grapefruit zest aftertaste.This is an outstanding beer in my opinion."
""
"This is a strange one. I grabbed a sixer accidentally thinking it was Sculpin (which I love). I dove in anyway and enjoyed it... initially. The flavors are so expertly balanced that I can see why this gets props, but the grapefruit, while interesting for one bottle, was not doing it for me AT ALL by midway through the second. I would drink one again, but would never crack a second in one session."
"Overall - A fantastic variation on a great beer. Give it a try."

"Bit on the sweet side. Middle has mandarin/orange rind notes. Was expecting a bit more from this as regular sculpin is great."

"Grapefruit dominates at first sip, then settles down to a very nice, balanced, tasty IPA"

""
""
"A nice twist on the original."
""
"On release, I was only able to get 2-12oz bottles from my craft beer store.  Initially, I thought this was fantastic.  Nice grapefruit flavor added bitterness to the already great Sculpin.  I found another store later that week that sold me a six pack.  After having 4 of these, I don't think it was as good as I initially thought it was.  The grapefruit kills all the nice stuff that Sculpin is.  A well balanced Sculpin now tastes like a grapefruit radler.  While still well done, I've revamped my rating to 4-ish from 4.5."

"Clear gold with a dense head of creamy foam.  Smells pretty much like pure, fresh grapefruit juice...vibrant and juicy.  Some leafy, floral hop notes come through as it warms.  Flavor has more depth - plenty of grapefruit for sure, but the hops bring some deeper tropical fruit, lemon, grass, and cracker-like grain.  The grapefruit remain amazingly fresh and bright, bringing a nice zesty, oily aspect that seems to blend well with the hops.  That being said, it is VERY grapefruity, going well beyond the limits of what hops can normally contribute.  Medium bodied, bitter, and pleasantly dry.  A quality IPA that really harnesses the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice quality, but still lets some of the base beer shine through (if only slightly)."

"Overall:  More of a novelty drink than an IPA, this is still a very enjoyable beer"

"Beautiful pour with clear golden color and a golden head in the Ommegang chalice. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft - North Park."

"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost the same as the regular Sculpin. Looks the same, orange with a good head. Aroma was all grapefruit like grapefruit juice. Flavor was super heavy grapefruit almost masking the hops. This was a cool beer but felt more like a novelty take and masked some of the flavors I enjoy in Sculpin."

"I am a huge fan of the original it is one of my top IPA's. I was a little unsure of what I would think of this varietal and I must say I am very pleased. It has a nice citrus fruit aroma and a subtle flavor addition that makes the beer unique. The base beer is still very much in this beer so fans of the original should really enjoy this. I will not say it is any better or worse than the original but a very nice take on the beer and I would rotate this one with the original year round if it were available."

"12 ounce bottle, Julian Date 14350 printed on label (bottled December 16, 2014).  Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half white head.  Head retention and lacing are both pretty good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pink grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a bit of bready malt.  It tastes like citrusy hops, pink grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit and bready malt.  There's also a lingering bitter finish.  Ballast Point was right when they named this beer, because it's all about the grapefruit!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink.  I think this is a pretty good brew, and if you like grapefruit then you'll really like this one!"

"Poured from a 12oz into my Spiegelau glass. No date on bottle, but the guy at Vintage Estate (best beer store in eastern OH bar none) told me it came in on 12/29. I trust them. Deep copper hue, with 3 fingers of white head with pretty big bubbles. Mucho lacing. There was literally a 3 foot radius aroma of grapefruit eminating from my glass throughout the consumption of this beauty. Also some aromas of citrus peel, some dank notes, and overall very clean! Big huge, juicy grapfefruit on the front of the palate. Clean and bitter bite on the end of the palate. Some funky (mosiac?) in the middle. Very hop forward, though there was enough of a malt foundation to carry it. Refreshing and clean, no major lingering aftertastes/etc. but it really kept the palate fresh. This was delicious and juicy. Love Sculpin, Grapefruit might be a +1... can't wait to find Habenero! Ballast Point. Find this!"

"Thanks to UncleJazz for the bottle.  Wow, this is a big blast of grapefruit and hops all very sweet and dripping with oranges, tangerines, mangoes and,obviously, grapefruit!

"Golden orange in color and pours with a beautiful fine head.  Nose is huge and impressive - brings to mind circus peanuts and grapefruit.  While the fruit is apparent in the nose, it blows you away upon sipping.  While the piney flavors are not very bitter, there is a pithiness to the grapefruit flavor.  Quite pleasant but I don't know that I want to have more than a few as I miss having more prominent hop flavor.  Mouthfeel and finish are very clean and refreshing.  All in all a very interesting and tasty beer."

"I haven't has a Sculpin in forever, but this beer brings back fond memories.  Like grapefruit juice, this smells bright, refreshing, pungent and bitter. Big hop character is present with tropical fruit, mango, peach, but really this is all about the grapefruit, pithy and zesty. The palate opens with a big grapefruit juice character, bright, refreshing and breakfast like. Moderately sweet, which hampers drinkability and takes away from the awesome hop profile, the mod palat is super juicy. Light in body and moderately carbonated, this beer has a long and bitter finish with a blend of grapefruit juice, honey and pine. This beer manages to be everything I hoped out would be but still disappoint. Recommended."

"Pours a clear light orange to yellow color with a large three finger white frothy head.  There is some carbonation and a little lacing.  The odor is indeed grapefruit, almost pink grapefruit, lemon peel, orange, some tropical fruits, slightly grassy.  The taste is citrus, grapefruit, orange, herbal, grassy, resin, pine, slight bitterness throughout."

"D - Sessionable.  Another winner from Ballast Point."
"Oh ya, pours great, decent off white foam head with minimal lacing. Nose billowed grapefruit and snippets of pine, finish was blissfully dry with no lingering sweetness - only pleasant bitterness...."

"I'm in love! That is, I love grapefruit, and this is liquid grapefruit. Intense grapefruit flavor and aroma, nice creamy mouthfeel with added astringency from the grapefruit. I can see why some people don't like this, it trades off the depth and complexity of sculpin for pure grapefruit flavor. If you like grapefruit, you will love this beer. If you don't, look elsewhere"

"I was unsure if Grapefruit Sculpin could live up to the name of the original. I can say with confidence that it has. This is fun drinking fruit-infused IPA, and one that is absolutely worth finding. Remember, that $15 six-pack price is still better value for money than that random $5 bomber."

"O - A perfect marriage of grapefruit and IPA. This one rocks on all fronts, but improving upon an already world-class, near-perfect IPA is bound to be a very, very difficult task. Between this and their 'regular' Sculpin, I'll pick their regular 10 times out of 10. Glad I got to try this one though."

"Hmmm. Wish I knew what was going on here. I have tried Sculpin a few times now and get little of what others are talking about. It seems too light bodied and subtle for me in comparison to like-style beers like Stone and Lagunitas.  So, perhaps the citrus bite of grapefruit will enhance it? It did, but not enough. Still too light bodied for my personal preference. I really enjoy so many of Ballast Point's offerings that this baffles me. Chalk it up to individual palate issues..."

"What's fascinating is how added grapefruit harmonizes and resonates with the beer's base flavors. Grapefruit is a common adjective of hoppy brew, but it's really just how your palate interprets and parses the spectrum of flavors in an hop-forward ale. Adding grapefruit proves there is some molecular similarity in how hopped ale and bitter citrus affect your palate. Bitter rind against tangy sweetness amplify the bitter-sweet duality inherent in beer...after reviewing IPA's for so long it's interesting how many times the first flavor that came to mind was grapefruit."

"Overall: This is Sculpin with all the great flavor added with a grapefruit taste. I never thought that Ballast Point could add to Sculpin's great flavor but I think the grapefruit enhances Sculpin's flavor. I tried Habanero Sculpin and the habanero heat overwhelmed the hop flavors and aromas of Sculpin but the grapefruit enhances Sculpin really well. While Sculpin is world class on its own grapefruit just enhances Sculpin. Definitely a must try for Sculpin lovers."
"I'm a fan of Sculpin, I'm a fan of Habanero Sculpin, I'm a huge fan of Grapefruit Sculpin. It's bursting with brightness, drippingly ripe, absurdly easy drinking, and just flat out good. I want some more of this right now."

"Bottle c/o the always generous daknole. Thank you my friend. Served side by side with regular Sculpin. Light golden body with a white head. Similar hop bill to the standard Sculpin with the addition of a huge grapefruit juice character. Fresh squeezed, tart, potent. Tasty beer."

"Poured a nice, slighty hazy amber body with a thin cap of white foam. Exactly what I expect from an IPA, nothing amazing, but still quite nice. Scents of tropical fruit especially pineapple and mango, pine resin, grapefruit peel and flesh, light pine resin and indeterminate citrus. Faint malt is also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a fairy grapefruit forward aroma, fitting the addition of grapefruit, with the same pine, tropical fruit and citrus that we have come expect from Sculpin. A wonderful aroma. True to form and what I expect from Sculpin. Flavor begins with a nice flavor of grapefruit zest and flesh, far more fresh and fruity than the normal hop-derived grapefruit. A hint of pine resin complements the grapefruit. The middle continues this fresh, grapefruit rich flavor, along with a bit of indeterminate, likely orange zest, citrus peel and moderate pine resin. Finish is rich in grapefruit flesh, peel, pith and medium amounts of pine resin. A light malt sweetness balances the hops and grapefruit throughout. Aftertaste is grapefruit flesh, rind and a moderate level of pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully refreshing IPA that takes a strong presence towards grapefruit due to the addition of grapefruit. It is wonderfully balanced and works well with the base flavors, particularly the pine resin, but also the malt. The fresh, bitter, fruity notes of the grapefruit peel are on full display and make the beer feel fresh and crisp. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium carbonation and a crisp, drying, resinous feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice, resinous IPA, the typical Sculpin, though notes of raw grapefruit also push through. Very nice. Overall this is a wonderful IPA. It takes the base Sculpin and adds a fantastic level of grapefruit to the base and balances it wonderfully in aroma and flavor. The resinous mouthfeel helps. Truly an excellent IPA that is full of fresh citrus and pine flavor. Highly recommended."

" The taste is excellent with the tangy citrus and grapefruit flavor very fresh and intense with a slight orange -like and mild floral hop quality with slight piney bitter taste. The hops are backed by a slight malt adding gentle sweetness with semi-toasted taste of malt and nicely bitter grapefruit flavor into the finish. This is a great IPA and the grapefruit is a natural flavor addition but actually enhances the original Sculpin, certainly does not detract from one of the best American IPA's"

"Final score: 4.30"
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation.This is a very grapefruit forward and a splendid one-off of an already amazing beer. If possible, I would tank this regularly. My opinion going in to this was that I question the ability to make an already world class ipa better. They actually pulled it off, the grapefruit really worked in this and I hope to cross paths with it again."

"Ewwwwww... looks as if I'm in the minority on this one. I know it says ""Grapefruit"" on the label but man oh man did they keep thier promise on that statement. Had a hard time pulling other flavors and such because of the overwhelming grapefruit quality in the beer. It was bitter (in a good way), the feel was good but to me had way too much grapefruit character going on which just lost me. I love grapefruit as well but I guess I thought I was gonna get an overload of grapefruit hops type of taste as apposed to an actual Grapefruit type of taste. It wasn't horrible but to me did not resemble the base sculpin in any way. To each thier own but I won't be buying again."

"Love dat fresh Sculpin. Didn't expect much from Grapefruit Sculpin but thought I would give it a test run. The aroma is dominated by a sweet candy citrus with honey and light floral hop aromas. The sweetness in the nose, thankfully, is the only thing that doesn't come through in the flavor. Grapefruit and orange citrus take center stage over a clean and smooth malt profile nicely balanced by a floral and citrus hop profile. While the candied grapefruit up front tastes a little fake, the perfectly bitter pith finish keeps me coming back. Crushable and refreshingly delicious, Grapefruit Sculpin is a great take on an already great IPA."

For a classic IPA, sculpin hangs with the big boys, this added grapefruit on top is literally the cherry on the sundae. ,very worth checking out,even if you don't like sculpin or grapefruit...heck I would say try it even if you don't like beer, this one might change your mind.  Great job!"

"Pith and pulp from grapefruit – I’m guessing of the ruby red variety – make for a very sharp, bright flavor in the fore, with a level of bitterness that seems higher than the documented 70 IBUs. It’s like biting right into a grapefruit rind and just going for it. Balance returns when pale, sugary malt and tropical hop notes, now seasoned with pineapple and peach, return at the finish."

"Overall, I'd have to rate this one higher than it's base beer brother. Sculpin is a very good IPA, but the addition of the grapefruit really makes this one explode out of the glass, especially when it comes to the taste. The only negative in my mind is that I feel like I've had beers before that accomplish this kind of sensation without the use of actual grapefruit, so in a weird way, the grapefruit feels like a crutch. Nonetheless, it's a great beer and one that I'll probably try to get more of next season."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and grapefruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grapefruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice citrus presence that make this one easy to drink."

" Sculpin is my favorite beer hands down and when I was visiting Diego me and my friend who lives around the corner decided to go get it started. I saw the grapefruit Sculpin on the menu and went for it. Was thinking it would be meh but it was actually amazing. It tasted exactly like Sculpin but with a bright grapefruit juice taste on the front end. Halfway throught the distinctive Sculpin flavor washed over my palate. If this was available in stores I would be running to get it. Would be the best summer beer ever. If you see this at the brewery get it immediately."
