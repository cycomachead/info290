3.87,-2.3,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Stone "Go To IPA"... should be an easy one, right? Let's see. Typical IPA appearance although perhaps a little more "golden" than might have been expected. Slightly hazy, but probably from dry-hopping, so no complaints there. The head retention and lacing seem quite good. On to the aroma: pungent, resinous, citrusy - actually quite dank... interesting. The flavor is also a bit pungent and resinous, as well as piney, but there's also much more citrus present than the nose let on (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon). I thought to myself, "if there's no malt going on beyond these hops, that'll still be OK for me", and it's kind of true - both for myself, and within the malt, which is somewhat biscuity but really just basic. Hmmm. I wish I hadn't thought that, because now I have a conundrum... is it OK with such a basic malt, or do I need more to support those intense hop flavors? Or does the malt allow those hop flavors to do what they want and just go to town? In the end I guess that's a question that really can't be answered. This has the bombastic hops of a bigger IPA, but the base of a much simpler IPA... it kind of leaves me looking for the malt of an "average" Stone IPA... but then I don't quite get the hops... so it's a trade-off - other than going to a bigger IPA (with much more alcohol) I'm a little bit stuck with one or the other... hmmm??? What I'll say then is that it's a welcome addition to the Stone line-up that has it's time and place. I'll gladly have more of these in the future, and I'll have plenty of other Stone IPAs as well, but for something like a 5 or 6 hour long deep sea fishing voyage these'll do just fine and I won't wake up as we return to dock covered in fish guts and empty crushed cans of Bud Light!

Super dry, light bodied, tannic almost. Alphas stick on the back of the tongue like bong resin. If it had some more malt character or less spicy bitterness, it'd rank a 5. Stone still cranks your palate with hops, no surprise there.","wwwyzzerdd86","Nov 17, 2014"

The taste was off from the scent though. It wasn't as hoppy and felt a little lacking though the middle. The beginning had lots of hops but dropped off quickly and lingered for a short while. For being what it is this is a solid beer that I could throw down all day if the occasion called for it. I will be picking up another pack soon.","Tylertut","Nov 13, 2014"

Nice foamy lace down the glass.  Nose is bitter and acidic.  No discernable malt character.  Mouthfeel is medium which is surprising given the thin appearance.  Taste is just a slight malt character followed by big citrus and pine hits.  Moderately bitter but finishes clean.  The second bottle was better.  Perfect for a hot summer day.  Let your friends quaff bud light while you enjoy big hop in a little beer!","wasso67","Nov 06, 2014"

4.26,7.6,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint glass for purposes of this review. A light harvest gold color with billowing sudsy head that tones itself down to a more manageable three fingers or so. After being absolutely blown away by other Stone IPAs, expectations are high. And they are met, although this brew is decidedly different from Stone IPA or Ruination (obviously). I Googled the tech specs and there are many hops in here, including a few experimental cultivars: Goes beyond the Centennial/Columbus/Chinook stalwarts that perform so admirably in the stronger Stones. Lives up to the session IPA billing and indeed could be the best exemplar of this substyle I've sampled to date. The drinker is greeted with lush vibrant aromas of melon, passion fruit, grapefruit, canned peaches, mango, grapes, and something more herbal and resinous as well, juniper or pine needles. A whole fruit bowl with added seasoning. Add orange, lemon, and pear to the palate and a very gentle malt body almost devoid of clear cut sweetness and you've got a highly drinkable yet potently flavorful winner. Vibrant fresh citrus and melon flavors, with that characteristic Stone herbal overtone as well. I hereby coin the term "melon forward". Light bodied, almost airy, with moderate carbonation and finishes dry, fruity, and floral. Wonderful stuff nearly beyond reproach. Maybe the body is TOO light? Maybe I'm reaching there.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 03, 2014"

Like I said this brew has all the hop flavors I seem to enjoy in my IPAs yet I could crush this beer like no other. I usually don't chain drink but this brew might actually encourage me! All in all, this brew is recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Oct 01, 2014"

Taste is big on hops and lacking on malt.  Not surprising since this a session IPA.  Unbalanced, but if you love hops maybe that's a good thing?  Pretty light bodied for an IPA, which again I think is intentional.  Very drinkable.  Overall a very good sessionable hoppy ale.","burnstar","Sep 29, 2014"

Aroma and Taste is citrus, a big blast of grapefruit pine aroma hits your senses but mellows out a bit, there is some grass and pale malt as well, mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, carbonation is there but mild. Finishes with a bit of floral, grapefruit pine, pale malt and mild bitterness. Not a very bitter brew and although its a session style brew the aroma seemed a bit overwhelming, an ok brew overall.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

3.4,-14.1,4,4,3,3,3.5,"I began with an aggro pour, resulting in a brief pseudo-cascade that settled into finger of dense, off-white head with limited retention. It did leave nice lacing in its wake as it fell, which was kind of nice. I would say that the color was more Yellow than Gold (SRM = 4 -5) and it had NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very citrusy, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was citrusy, all right, but it did not have the intensity of the nose. Therein lies my problem with these new "Session IPAs" - they rely on aromatic hops, but do not come with the bitterness expected in the style when it comes to taste, which is what really counts. The finish was kind of bitter, but until they develop a new style for this type of beer, I am not going to rate it terribly highly as an AIPA. I just found it to be unfulfilling as a whole.","woodychandler","Aug 10, 2014"

Its a big drinking ipa squeezed into a session like serving much like a 6'11" basketball player being squeezed into a smart car. Honestly its one and only drawback may be that the hopping is so aggressive and strong, as well its body fullness, it will be hard to pound this as a session like ipa. But it will still remain as a go to.","beerthulhu","Jul 31, 2014"

Anyway, off of my soapbox, this stuff pours a lightly hazy golden brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light caramel-drizzled biscuit, lime zest, pine resin, grass, and light menthol. The taste brings in more of the same, the lime, grapefruit, resin, and menthol combining for that characteristic Stone assault on the tastebuds. Fuck you, balance, I guess, but, hey, Stone's done good work with that mentality in the past, so what the hell do I know? Here, though, there's not enough to balance out any of the hops' attack, so it just comes across as too much for no real reason. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent enough IPA, but the hops here just go too far for the beer's own good, a position I've found myself in somewhat often lately when it's come to Stone...","TMoney2591","Jul 28, 2014"

The smell is strong hops, definitely some citrus, also some skunky, oniony aroma as well. The taste follows suit and is surprisingly strong for a lighter beer. However, there's a bitter aftertaste that sticks to your mouth and really detracts from the beer. Mouthfeel is good; it does not feel like a low abv beer. Overall, it's a VERY impressive showing in the session ipa catergory, that just suffers from too much bitterness in the finish. If that went away (and maybe the skunky side of the hops got toned down a tad), I would declare it the best bottled session ipa I've ever had.","dougfur","Jul 08, 2014"

The hop forward profile gives you a big, juicy, citrusy hop punch right up front, but with an almost completely clean finish. Speaking of the finish, that’s my only complaint with this beer; it cleans up so well that you actually miss the flavors that could be there. I don’t mind a clean finish per se, but the finish here sees the flavors completely disappearing, which makes it extremely drinkable and light feeling, but condemns it to only being a beer suitable for drinking while you’re out grilling in the sun. Pick some up if that’s the case, but outside of the aforementioned sun-baked-patio scenario, most drinkers seeking an IPA will want something more complex and robust.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

It's way more citral, floral, bitter, and hoppy than a beer with this low ABV should be. Think Ruination but with an off-putting pledge after taste.","Every1sgrudge","Jun 18, 2014"

Smells of strong pine, strong floral hops, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, and hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong bitterness and slight dryness.

Frothy head reduces to excellent lacing and thin frothing. All grapefruit, oranges, and hibiscus aromas. Smooth grapefruit and hops nose. Mid-palate it sours and the bitterness comes through. IPA style hops, Fresca overtones, and a little wheat nibble. Slight pine and crisp cloves on the back palate with bodl grapefruit lingering into the aftertaste. Very drinkable. Refreshing.

4.28,8.1,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured a clear amber yellow with a one finger white head that quickly receded to a ring of white foam. A nice looking light IPA appearance. Scents of citrus zest, grapefruit and pine resin upfront, with undertones of tropical fruit, orange, onion and cat urine and very faint hints of malt sweetness. A good West Coast IPA aroma profile, though nothing too out of the ordinary. Flavor is extremely bitter upfront, with pine resin and bitter citrus pith dominating. This moves into more forward flavors of bitter citrus pith and floral undertones with a bit less pine resin. Finish is again heavy on pine resin, along with bitter citrus pith and some floral notes. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, citrus pith and faint floral notes. A very aggressively hop-forward flavor profile with no discernible malt flavors. Great if you love hops, particularly the varieties used in West Coast IPAs, terrible and undrinkable if you don't. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a watery feel. Expected and true to form for a session IPA. Overall this is an excellent session IPA for those who love West Coast versions of the style. The aroma and flavor profiles are top notch and allow the hop character to shine through without any malt getting in the way. The mouthfeel is light and makes this one go down easy as well. A treat for hop lovers, terrible for anyone else.","Auraan","Jun 03, 2014"

Dank resinous earthy pine fills my nostrils. Bits of green onion and a hint of bread round things out in the aroma. The flavor is moderate earthy spicy pine hop flavor with a thin light bready malt beneath. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a thin somewhat watery mouthfeel. This one has light and refreshing down, I could probably drink a ton of these on a warm summer's day. Unfortunately, I don't think I would, the body for me is too light and I hate to say this, but I want more maltiness.

Smooth, easy to drink, the hops are not overpowering and that's the point with a IPA that is designed to be less hop heavy and boozy and more sessionable. Does an admirable job as the hop presence is good, light, citrusy, malts are ok with minor sweetness. Not bad but something that takes accustomed to as compared to other IPAs it is a bit thin. Worth a try and I enjoyed it.","clayrock81","Apr 20, 2014"

3.6,-9.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Regardless, it's definitely not as bitter or intense (or sweet) as many of Stone's other beers, and this really benefits from having something to munch on alongside its consumption. I found garlic brie to be a good complimentary side snack, as well as a rich chicken or fish soup on a warm day outside. It's inoffensive, and perhaps a bit overpriced for what it delivers, but I definitely enjoyed it overall.","magictacosinus","Apr 17, 2014"
3.53,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was nice example of a session IPA, but I felt like the green onion hop profile held it back from being as good as it could be and those green onion flavors kind of clashed with the tropical fruit hop flavors. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, very crisp, not too filling, and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think the carbonation might wear on me. It's smooth enough for a session IPA, but the flavors don't hold my attention like others in the style, so one or two would be my limit. What I like the most about this beer was the tropical fruit hop aspect and the appearance I thought they were both pretty good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the green onion hop aspect, it just isn't for me and I think it clashed with the other hop flavors. I don't think I would get this beer again, I think I would buy some All Day IPA instead. I might recommend this to people who like Session IPA's, but I don't think it's a must try. All in all this was a Solid Session IPA, but it had some aspects that held it back from being a great beer and stand out for the style. As it is I think it's falls right in the middle for session IPA's and it's for sure not my favorite Stone beer. Solid job, but I think with a little work this could be a standout for the style, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Apr 16, 2014"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Wow. Stone has done it again. Pours light straw golden color, with fairly decent head and nice lacing on the pint glass. Smell punches you for a session IPA. Big fruit nose, smells super fresh. Taste is phenomenal for what one would call a session brew. This would a great converter brew to offer a friend that isn't into the big DIPA's. Has the characteristics of a much bolder ABV brew in something that is very refreshing and sessionable. Mouthfeel is on point as well. Refreshing, not overly heavy and nice carbonation balance. Overall, an easy choice to buy again. Highly recommended.","tbraun1","Apr 15, 2014"

There's also a hint of citrus and an earthiness once you get past the urine smell. Taste is a bit biscuity, followed by some citrus - cat pee is not as present in the flavor profile. There's also a light, lingering earthy/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that falls just shy of prickly.

It is similar to others I've had in the style in that it is really hoppy and dry with little to no malt flavor holding it up. Good for a quicky hop infusion. I've never actually tried to "session" one of these types of beers, I think I'd rather have fewer beers with more flavors than more of a "one note" beer.","Mdog","Apr 13, 2014"

Two things will prevent this from being a true "Go To" IPA in my book: it isn't my personal favorite hop profile, and trying a second while taking down a pizza resulted in the spice/onion hop flavors coming out huge - which was not an improvement. Still, good and one that I'll gladly drink the rest of the six-pack.","macrosmatic","Apr 13, 2014"

Maybe it was old, maybe it was me, circumstances of a vast array can make you love or hate a beer or for anything for that matter. I consider myself someone who can handle the IBU's I like hoppy beers and had some monsters that I loved. Which brings me to my point, I tried Arrogant Bastard and hated it, this was before my reviewing days so I may revisit it. I have been hearing a lot from friends and various other sources that the Enjoy By series is something I should try, I have two 4/20/14's in the fridge as we speak, but today I also ran across a six pack of this stuff it was on sale for $10, so I figured what the hell, I can go home this weekend watch the Masters and try a variety of brews and since this one is only 4.5% something I can get into. Now to the review, wow, I was really impressed. It has a lot of wonderful hop flavor and aroma without too much assertive bitterness with a very pleasant drinkability. Its pale, not really an IPA more of just a PA but its really good and if it were in the $8-9 range I could see myself drinking this frequently, but as I said it was on sale for $10 and that was down from $12. At $12 I can find better stuff, it was worth seeking out, and the price point was good, today, but they need to work on that a bit. Which is my only complaint. I think the ratings above are close to right on, but I would maybe move it up to low 90's.","humuloner22","Apr 10, 2014"

Nice aroma of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit and lemon, hints of tropical fruit. Flavor is grapefruit centric citrus hops, a bit dank, lemon and grapefruit rind, light bready malt, finishes a bit thin, but with assertive lemon rind bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Nicely hopped for a session ale, but the hops seem a bit stark without the support of a more substantial body. As expected from Stone, well made and nicely hopped. I guess maybe session IPAs may not be a style for me, I'd just as soon have a higher ABV, more balanced IPA than a couple of lighter ones.

I don't quite understand the need for a session IPA when we have pale ales. Perhaps its because pale ales were becoming more like IPAs with more alcohol content and flavor. My biggest issue is the mouthfeel-its so thin it frustrates me at times, but at the same time I believe it might be very enjoyable in the summer when I want something flavorful but not too heavy. I'm just perplexed with the style at the moment because I think it shows remarkable craftsmanship to have such hop flavor in a low alcohol beer but at the same time pale ales are more complex in some regards.","thegodfather2701","Mar 29, 2014"

3.99,0.8,2.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): The taste, aroma, and feel of this beer are all quite nice—the one thing that’s seriously lacking is the appearance. Seriously. It looks good at first, albeit a little anemic in the body, and then has no endurance at all. But, hey, looks aren’t everything. The aroma is hands-down the strongest aspect of the beer, and the taste and feel are both solidly above average the taste slightly moreso, but not by much. Either way, I’d say this is a somewhat better stab at the “Session IPA” trend than others I’ve had, and worth paying about $10/sixer. Unfortunately, this was $12.99 for me, like most stone sixers, and at that price I’m not sure it’s worth getting more than once.","fmccormi","Mar 25, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of huge peach, mango, passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops with a fair amount of malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big peach, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an awesome session IPA! All around great complexity of bright hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 23, 2014"

Front of mouth is fairly tasteless with a little fizz and the finish is tarry pine on the roof of my mouth. Not much else going on.

I was looking forward to trying Stone's entry into the sessionable IPA arena. What a disappointment! This beer (or at least the batch I got) suffers from a serious case of isovaleric acid off flavor. Isovaleric acid compounds are usually due to using stale or poorly stored hops, and result in off flavors best described as "cheesy". Sadly this is the dominant flavor and aroma on offer here - nasty, stale cheese. Not pleasant in the least, and definitely not what I expected. Drain pour I'm afraid.","od_sf","Mar 21, 2014"

Solid bitterness, but the star of the flavour was the citrus character -- grapefruit and tangerine, pithy and fruity, with a hint of tropical fruits and slight hop spice in the finish.

Look it's about time Stone went extreme with a session IPA abv 4.5% check, almost fizzy and yellow...check, and a new hop addition process, hop-bursted session IPA...check. All of the qualities I've been looking for in a beer, hop flavor without all of the miles on the hepatocytes (liver cells). This is the palest colored ale I've seen from Stone really bordering a shade or two darker than most fizzy yellow beers, bright white billowing head evenly dispersed head with some retention. Calorically speaking this could be my new diet beer, forget Michelob Ultra I will take the Stone Go To IPA when I try to lose extra lbs. Aromatics offer up some very pleasant hop notes dank citric notes, bitter pith, a hint of pine even some garlic notes, very pale mild biscuit malts give it an edge of bready malts in the background. Flavor wise, watered down IPA, but I can take it garlic/vegetal hop notes citric bitter lemon rinds with pale biscuit malts barely breaking through with any sweetness all the fermented sugars had to be converted into the minimal alcohol level this beer does have. I wonder what the original gravity was on this brew? Hop bursting is a success, hop flavor is here, light cereal grains a hint of alcohol and lingering bitterness in the finish it's a few notes of genius in each sip...we all seek complexity this is great for brushing your teeth with hop water, but for sustaining hophead cravings it's like taking a placebo...about 30% off my hop cravings have been met. Mouthfeel slightly textured with hop oils and mineral water carbonation comes off on the higher end due to the lighter bodied low carb hop head beer, this feels like. Overall, I will continue to drink it, it joins the rotation of Founders All Day IPA, and the Lagunitas DayTime IPA (which I haven't had yet)...Founders gets my nod so far...in cans if I can find them.","WVbeergeek","Mar 10, 2014"

4.18,5.6,3.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Crystal clear yellow body beneath a small, sticky white head. Pungent ruby red grapefruit, peach, mango, and resinous pine aromatics. Super hoppy, chuggable, refreshing flavor. Dank, oily hop resins, zesty citrus, herbs, miscellaneous tropical fruits. Pretty much nothing in the malt department. Light bodied, bitter, and crisp. Lots of great hop character in a light, easy-drinking format...what's not to like? My only wish is that this was priced more like DayTime, which is a more reasonable $8 a sixer for your sessioning pleasure.","wedge","Mar 10, 2014"

However, like most other session IPAs I've had, the lack of malt body really detracts from the drinkability. It feels too watery and the hop astringencies build to borderline unpleasant levels. In all fairness these are the same criticisms I've had of the vast majority of session IPAs I've tried to date. If you are a fan of the style, this will probably hit the spot for you.","ryan1788a5","Mar 10, 2014"
